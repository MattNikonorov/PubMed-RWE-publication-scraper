From January 2000 to December 2007, 107 consecutive patients aged ≥75 years received radiotherapy with radical intent for PC. Eighty-one patients received radiotherapy in combination with a 6 months androgen suppression therapy. Variables considered were age, stage, co-morbidities according to the adult co-morbidity evaluation index (ACE-27) and performance status (PS). The median age was 79.1 years (range 76-87). The 23.4% of patients showed no co-morbidities, while the 46.7% had mild, 23.4% moderate, and 6.5% severe co-morbidities, respectively. All patients completed the planned radiation treatment. At a median follow-up of 37.8 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 78%. There was a better survival for patients with no or mild co-morbidities (p<0.0001) and a good PS (p=0.009). The actuarial disease-free survival at 60 months was 75.8%. Difference in acute and late toxicity rate was detected between ACE-27 classes for diarrhea and marginally for urinary toxicity, but no difference was detected for different age. We conclude that compliance with radiotherapy is good and rate of toxicity is acceptable in elderly patients. Increasing severity of co-morbidity may sufficiently shorten remaining life expectancy to cancel gains with radical radiotherapy. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.""","""['F Fiorica', 'M Berretta', 'C Colosimo', 'S Berretta', 'M Ristagno', 'T Palmucci', 'S Palmucci', 'A Lleshi', 'S Ursino', 'R Fisichella', 'D Spartà', 'A Stefanelli', 'A Cappellani', 'U Tirelli', 'F Cartei']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Arch Gerontol Geriatr""","""['Safety and feasibility of radiotherapy treatment in elderly non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.', 'Adjuvant radiotherapy on older and oldest elderly rectal cancer patients.', 'Adjuvant radiotherapy on older and oldest breast cancer patients after conservative surgery: a retrospective analysis.', 'Curative external beam radiotherapy in patients over 80 years of age with localized prostate cancer: a retrospective rare cancer network study.', 'Factors affecting recurrence rates after prostatectomy or radiotherapy in localized prostate carcinoma patients with biopsy Gleason score 8 or above.', 'Irradiation of localized prostate cancer in the elderly: A systematic literature review.', 'Systematic Review of the Relationship between Acute and Late Gastrointestinal Toxicity after Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Challenges of managing elderly men with prostate cancer.', 'Impact of comorbidity in elderly prostate cancer patients treated with brachytherapy.', 'Do comorbidity influences acute toxicity and outcome in elderly patients with endometrial cancer treated by adjuvant radiotherapy plus brachytherapy?']"""

Mesoporous silica was coated onto sodium yttrium fluoride upconversion nanocrystals to form a core-shell structure and then loaded with the photosensitizer zinc (II)-phthalocyanine into the porous silica. The nanoparticles displayed a uniform spherical shape with an average diameter of about 50 nm and showed good dispersibility in water. Intracellular uptake study in MB49 cells revealed a time- and concentration-dependent accumulation of these nanoparticles. Upon irradiation with 980-nm near-infrared light, their efficiency in activating the loaded zinc (II)-phthalocyanine to generate singlet oxygen molecules was confirmed in live cells. The cytotoxic effect of the released singlet oxygen from the nanoplatform was proven by cell viability assay, confocal microscopy, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, cytochrome c-releasing assay, and prostate-specific antigen-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, all of which showed a strong photodynamic effect of the nanoparticles on MB49 cells. This suggests the efficacy of sodium yttrium fluoride upconversion nanoparticles as a carrier for photosensitizers and their use in photodynamic therapy of cancer and some other diseases.

The degrees of cellular uptake of various copolymer fractions with narrow polydispersities were quantified. The copolymer charge was the predominant physicochemical feature in terms of cellular uptake. Fast and efficient uptake occurred in positively charged copolymers due to non-specific adsorptive endocytosis, whereas slow uptake of negatively charged copolymers was observed. The uptake of copolymers was also molecular weight dependent. The copolymers were internalized into the cells through multiple endocytic pathways: positively charged copolymers robustly engaged clathrin-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis and dynamin-dependent endocytosis, while weakly negatively charged copolymers weakly employed these pathways; strongly negatively charged copolymers only mobilized macropinocytosis. HPMA copolymer possessing 4 mol% of moderately hydrophobic functional groups did not show preferential uptake. All copolymers ultimately localized in late endosomes/lysosomes via early endosomes; with varying kinetics among the copolymers.

The purpose is to discern the efficacy of synthetic small molecule telomerase enzyme inhibitors (TEI) alone or in combination with other cytotoxic therapies in controlling metastatic osseous prostate cancer.  Methods:   C4-2B was pre-treated with a match or mismatch TEI for 6 weeks and then inoculated into nude mice subcutaneously or intraosseously. In a separate experiment, untreated C4-2B was injected into femur of nude mice. The mice were divided into seven systemic ""combination"" treatment groups of control, Ad-BSP-E1a virus, docetaxel, mismatch and match TEI. Serum PSA was followed longitudinally. Histology analyses and histomorphometry were performed. Repeated measure analysis was applied for statistical analysis and Bonferroni method was used in multiple comparisons.  Results:   In the pre-treated study, the PSA of match treated cells in subcutaneous or intraosseous model was significantly lower than mismatch TEI or PBS treated group (P < 0.05). Histology revealed increased fibrosis, apoptosis and decreased PSA staining in the match TEI treated subcutaneous xenografts. In the combination treatment study, the PSA was significantly lower in single/double treatment and triple treatment than control (P < 0.05). Histology revealed that triple therapy mice had normal femur architecture. Histomorphometrics revealed that the area of femur tumor and woven bone was significantly positively correlated (P = 0.007).  Conclusions:   Multiple lines of data point toward the efficacy of systemically administered telomerase inhibitors. Combining cytotoxic regimens with telomerase inhibitors could be beneficial in controlling prostate cancer. Clinical trials are warranted to explore the efficacy of TEI in prostate cancer.""","""['Yingming Li', 'Bahaa S Malaeb', 'Zhong-Ze Li', 'Melissa G Thompson', 'Zhi Chen', 'David R Corey', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Jerry W Shay', 'Kenneth S Koeneman']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Small molecule, oligonucleotide-based telomerase template inhibition in combination with cytolytic therapy in an in vitro androgen-independent prostate cancer model.', 'Conditionally replicating adenovirus therapy utilizing bone sialoprotein promoter (Ad-BSP-E1a) in an in vivo study of treating androgen-independent intraosseous prostate cancer.', 'Effective treatment of experimental androgen sensitive and androgen independent intraosseous prostate cancer with targeted cytotoxic somatostatin analogue AN-238.', 'Management of androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'P450-dependent enzymes as targets for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Knockdown of tankyrase 1 inhibits the progression of gastric adenocarcinoma via regulating human telomerase reverse transcriptase and telomeric repeat binding factor 1.', 'Pharmacological inhibition of noncanonical EED-EZH2 signaling overcomes chemoresistance in prostate cancer.', 'High fat diet increases melanoma cell growth in the bone marrow by inducing osteopontin and interleukin 6.', 'Telomeres and telomerase: from discovery to clinical trials.']"""

We first confirmed and extended the results of others showing that the inhibitory action of CLA on proliferation is dependent on the cell type as well as the structure of the isomer, the 10,12 isomer being a more potent inhibitor than the 9,11 isomer in the concentration range 25-100 microM. By Western analysis, we showed that 10,12 CLA downregulated FAS expression in all of the cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner, but the 9,11 isomer had no effect. Both isomers inhibited FAS enzyme activity, but 10,12 CLA was again more potent than the 9,11 isomer.

While relaxin is well known for its reproductive and antifibrotic roles, recent studies suggest that it is produced by cancer cells and acts on RXFP1 to induce growth and metastasis. Furthermore, more recently Silvertown et al. demonstrated that lentiviral production of a human gene-2 (H2) relaxin analog reduced the growth of prostate xenograft tumors. The authors proposed that the lentivirally produced peptide was an RXFP1 antagonist; however, the processed form of the peptide produced was not demonstrated. In this study, we have chemically synthesized the H2 relaxin analog, B-R13/17K H2 relaxin, and subjected it to detailed chemical characterization by HPLC, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. The biological activity of the synthetic peptide was then tested in three different cell lines. It was found to bind with 500-fold lower affinity than H2 relaxin to RXFP1 receptors over-expressed in HEK-293T cells where it acted as a partial agonist. However, in cells which natively express the RXFP1 receptor, rat renal myofibroblasts and MCF-7 cancer cells, it acted as a full antagonist. Importantly, it was able to significantly inhibit cell invasion induced by H2 relaxin in MCF-7 cells consistent with the results of the lentiviral-driven expression in prostate cancer cells. The relaxin analog, B-R13/17K H2, can now be used as a tool to further understand RXFP1 function, and serve as a template for drug design for a therapeutic to treat prostate and other cancers.""","""['Mohammed Akhter Hossain', 'Chrishan S Samuel', 'Claudia Binder', 'Tim D Hewitson', 'Geoffrey W Tregear', 'John D Wade', 'Ross A D Bathgate']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Probing the functional domains of relaxin-3 and the creation of a selective antagonist for RXFP3/GPCR135 over relaxin receptor RXFP1/LGR7.', 'Improved chemical synthesis and demonstration of the relaxin receptor binding affinity and biological activity of mouse relaxin.', 'Chimeric relaxin peptides highlight the role of the A-chain in the function of H2 relaxin.', 'Relaxin-3, INSL5, and their receptors.', 'International Union of Pharmacology LVII: recommendations for the nomenclature of receptors for relaxin family peptides.', 'Development of Novel High-Affinity Antagonists for the Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 1.', 'Total Chemical Synthesis of Palmitoyl-Conjugated Insulin.', 'The Novel AT2 Receptor Agonist β-Pro7-AngIII Exerts Cardiac and Renal Anti-Fibrotic and Anti-Inflammatory Effects in High Salt-Fed Mice.', 'Relaxin Inhibits the Cardiac Myofibroblast NLRP3 Inflammasome as Part of Its Anti-Fibrotic Actions via the Angiotensin Type 2 and ATP (P2X7) Receptors.', 'Expression and Characterization of Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 1 Variants.']"""

The aim of the present study was to characterize primary outgrowing prostate epithelial cells due to their basal or luminal characteristics and their potential for serving as androgen-responsible model. From fresh prostate cancer radical prostatectomy specimens, pieces of approximately 2-4 mm diameter were placed on top of transwell culture chambers, which were coated with matrigel and cultured in prostate epithelial selection medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The monolayer of outgrowing cells was incubated with a physiological concentration of 1 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT). One group was additionally cultivated without DHT and another group was treated with the 5-alpha-reductase-inbitors MK-368 and MK-905. From the monolayer of the outgrowing cells, RNA was isolated and the expression of androgen receptor (AR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Kallikrein 2 (KlK2), prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), cytokeratin (CK)5, and CK18 was determined by realtime quantitative PCR. The outgrowing cells from the prostate cancer tissue pieces could be characterized as epithelial cells with basal and transit amplifying characteristics as shown by co-expression of CK5 and CK18. In all cultures, a very low expression of the luminal cell marker genes AR, PSA and KLK2 was measured. The levels of PSCA were clearly higher with a broad variation. Upon cultivation without DHT or treatment with alpha-reductase inhibitors no regulation of AR, PSA and KlK2 was found.

This study was performed to test the hypothesis that enhanced expression of Ki-67, as a surrogate of cell proliferation, is a characteristic feature of prostate cancers occurring in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. The study cohort comprised 20 cases of prostate cancer in mutation carriers and 126 control sporadic prostate cancers. Of the combined sample cohort, 65.7% stained only within malignant tissues while 0.7% stained in both malignant and benign tissues (p<0.001). Significantly increased expression of Ki-67 occurred in prostate cancers with higher Gleason score (p<0.001). Elevated Ki-67 expression was identified in 71% of prostate cancers in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers and in 67% of the sporadic controls (p>0.5). Similar results were obtained when the data were analysed using a threshold set at 3.5 and 7.1%. This study shows that elevated expression of Ki-67 is associated both with aggressive prostate cancers and with high Gleason score irrespective of whether their occurrence is against a background of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations or as sporadic disease.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether androgen receptor (AR) and its signaling regulate hsp70-1 expression. Several lines of AR-positive (LNCaP, LAPC-4, and 22Rv1) and -negative (PC-3, DU145, WPE1-NB14 and WPE1-NB-26) human prostatic cells were used in the study. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) enhanced hsp70-1 expression in LNCaP cells. Expression of hsp70-1 in LNCaP cells was downregulated by the anti-androgens bicalutamide (Bic), and flutamide (Flut), and a newly identified AR signaling antagonist DL3. The downregulation of hsp70-1 by DL3 was also observed in LAPC-4 and 22Rv1 cells, but not in the four lines of AR-negative cells examined. Expression of hsp70-1 was also reduced by DL3 in PC-3 cells engineered with AR. On the other hand, knocking down AR in LNCaP cells by siRNA moderately reduced hsp70-1 level and abolished effects of DL3 on hsp70-1 expression. DL3 reduced hsp70-1 mRNA synthesis in cells and its in vitro gene transcription but did not significantly alter the stabilities of hsp70-1 mRNA and protein. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that AR bound to the promoter region of HSPA1B gene, which was reduced in cells treated with DL3 or Bic. These data suggest that AR and its signaling regulate hsp70-1 expression in prostate cancer cells and that HSPA1B could be an AR target gene.""","""['Shan Lu', 'Zongqin Tan', 'Matt Wortman', 'Shan Lu', 'Zhongyun Dong']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['A novel synthetic compound that interrupts androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Hedgehog/Gli supports androgen signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Increased expression of androgen receptor sensitizes prostate cancer cells to low levels of androgens.', 'Corepressive function of nuclear receptor coactivator 2 in androgen receptor of prostate cancer cells treated with antiandrogen.', 'The androgen receptor messenger RNA: what do we know?', 'The Role of Heat Shock Protein 70 Subfamily in the Hyperplastic Prostate: From Molecular Mechanisms to Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Proliferating cell nuclear antigen directly interacts with androgen receptor and enhances androgen receptor‑mediated signaling.', 'Identification of hub genes associated with RNAi-induced silencing of XIAP through targeted proteomics approach in MCF7 cells.', 'NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'High SPDEF may identify patients who will have a prolonged response to androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

We identified an RNA transcript with sequence homology to TRPM8 (melastatin-related transient receptor potential member 8) that was overexpressed in tumor vs. patient-matched non-tumor prostate tissues by RT-PCR differential display (DD). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that TRPM8 levels were higher in tumor than in non-tumor tissue from 31 of 40 (>75%) patients examined. Overexpression of TRPM8 was independent of changes in androgen receptor (AR) mRNA levels in tumor tissue. However, in studies with established cell lines, TRPM8 expression was detectable only in AR-positive, but not in AR-negative cells, and it was suppressed by steroid deprivation or anti-androgen bicalutamide (Casodex) treatment, suggesting the requirement of AR activity for TRPM8 expression in prostate cancer cells. TRPM8 mRNA was also detected in body fluids of men. Most importantly, its levels were significantly higher (p<0.001, n=18) in urine and blood of patients with metastatic disease than in those of healthy men. However, there was no significant difference (p>0.05, n=10) in its levels between prostate cancer patients with localized disease and healthy men. Together, these studies demonstrate that TRPM8 expression is androgen regulated in prostate cancer cells and that, while tissue TRPM8 mRNA levels can be used for detection of prostate cancer, urine and blood TRPM8 mRNA levels may prove to be useful for distinguishing metastatic disease from clinically localized prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis.""","""['V Uma Bai', 'Shalini Murthy', 'Kannagi Chinnakannu', 'Fred Muhletaler', 'Sheela Tejwani', 'Evelyn R Barrack', 'Sahn-Ho Kim', 'Mani Menon', 'G Prem Veer Reddy']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Evidence for specific TRPM8 expression in human prostate secretory epithelial cells: functional androgen receptor requirement.', 'TRPM8 in prostate cancer cells: a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker with a secretory function?', 'Prostate cell differentiation status determines transient receptor potential melastatin member 8 channel subcellular localization and function.', 'Higher tumor to benign ratio of the androgen receptor mRNA expression associates with prostate cancer progression after radical prostatectomy.', 'Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for prostate specific antigen in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'TRPM8 as an Anti-Tumoral Target in Prostate Cancer Growth and Metastasis Dissemination.', 'Molecular Characterization of Membrane Steroid Receptors in Hormone-Sensitive Cancers.', 'TRP Channels Interactome as a Novel Therapeutic Target in Breast Cancer.', 'TRPM8 Inhibition Regulates the Proliferation, Migration and ROS Metabolism of Bladder Cancer Cells.']"""

CXCR4 is co-expressed with POU5F1 in endodermal precursors and adult-tissue stem cells. CXCR4 is expressed in a variety of human tumors, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer. CXCR4 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for CXCL12 (SDF1) chemokine, and the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis is involved in proliferation, survival, migration, and homing of cancer cells. Integrative genomic analyses of CXCR4 gene were carried out to elucidate the mechanisms of CXCR4 expression in stem cells, because CXCR4 is a key molecule occupying the crossroads of oncology, immunology, gerontology and regenerative medicine. Human CXCR4 promoter region with binding sites for HIF1alpha, ETS1, NF-kappaB and GLI was not conserved in mouse and rat Cxcr4 orthologs. Proximal enhancer region with palindromic Smad-binding sites, FOX-binding site, POU-binding site, triple SOX17-binding sites, bHLH-binding site, TCF/LEF-binding site, and double GFI1-binding sites was almost completely conserved among human, chimpanzee, mouse, and rat CXCR4 orthologs. TGFbeta, Nodal, and Activin signals induce CXCR4 upregulation based on Smad2/3 and FOX family members, such as FOXA2, FOXC2, and FOXH1. CXCR4 is expressed in endodermal precursors due to the existence of triple SOX17-binding sites around the POU-binding site instead of the POU5F1-SOX2 joint motif. Because CXCR4 is downregulated by p53-GFI1 signaling axis, p53 mutation in cancer stem cells leads to CXCR4 upregulation. CXCR4 is also upregulated by TGFbeta and Hedgehog signals in tumor cells at the invasion front. Small molecule compound or human antibody targeted to CXCR4 will be applied for cancer therapeutics focusing on cancer stem cells at the primary lesion as well as metastasis or recurrence niches, such as bone marrow and peritoneal cavity.""","""['Masuko Katoh', 'Masaru Katoh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Transcriptional mechanisms of WNT5A based on NF-kappaB, Hedgehog, TGFbeta, and Notch signaling cascades.', 'Integrative genomic analyses of ZEB2: Transcriptional regulation of ZEB2 based on SMADs, ETS1, HIF1alpha, POU/OCT, and NF-kappaB.', 'Integrative genomic analyses on GLI1: positive regulation of GLI1 by Hedgehog-GLI, TGFbeta-Smads, and RTK-PI3K-AKT signals, and negative regulation of GLI1 by Notch-CSL-HES/HEY, and GPCR-Gs-PKA signals.', 'Human FOX gene family (Review).', 'Trafficking of normal stem cells and metastasis of cancer stem cells involve similar mechanisms: pivotal role of the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis.', 'Targeting HIC1/TGF-β axis-shaped prostate cancer microenvironment restrains its progression.', 'RNF12 is regulated by AKT phosphorylation and promotes TGF-β driven breast cancer metastasis.', 'Breast Cancer Cells Metastasize to the Tissue-Engineered Premetastatic Niche by Using an Osteoid-Formed Polycaprolactone/Nanohydroxyapatite Scaffold.', 'Identification of potential targets of triptolide in regulating the tumor microenvironment of stomach adenocarcinoma patients using bioinformatics.', 'The Role of the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 Chemokine Axis in Cancer.']"""

Notch-1 over-expression has been reported in prostate cancer metastases. Likewise, Notch ligand Jagged-1 was found to be over-expressed in metastatic prostate cancer compared to localized prostate cancer or benign prostatic tissues, suggesting the biological significance of Notch signaling in prostate cancer progression. However, the mechanistic role of Notch signaling and the consequence of its down-regulation in prostate cancer have not been fully elucidated. Using multiple cellular and molecular approaches such as MTT assay, apoptosis assay, gene transfection, real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, migration, invasion assay and ELISA, we found that down-regulation of Notch-1 or Jagged-1 was mechanistically associated with inhibition of cell growth, migration, invasion and induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, which was mediated via inactivation of Akt, mTOR, and NF-kappaB signaling. Consistent with these results, we found that the down-regulation of Notch-1 or Jagged-1 led to decreased expression and the activity of NF-kappaB downstream genes such as MMP-9, VEGF, and uPA, contributing to the inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Taken together, we conclude that the down-regulation of Notch-1 or Jagged-1 mediated inhibition of cell growth, migration and invasion, and the induction of apoptosis was in part due to inactivation of Akt, mTOR, and NF-kappaB signaling pathways.

A modular Phase I study of lenalidomide and paclitaxel in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) was conducted to assess PSA kinetics with lead-in lenalidomide and the feasibility of the combination.  Methods:   Men with metastatic CRPC with prior taxane chemotherapy were planned for single-agent ""lead-in"" lenalidomide for 21/28 days at dose-levels: -1 (5 mg), 0 (10 mg), +1 (15 mg), +2 (20 mg), +3 (25 mg); followed by lenalidomide at the same dose and schedule in combination with weekly intravenous paclitaxel 100 mg/m(2) over 3 h on days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days utilizing a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design.  Results:   Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 4/6 patients with first-cycle combination therapy at the 10 mg dose-level and 3/6 patients at the 5 mg dose-level of lenalidomide, respectively. These included Grade 3 neutropenia precluding planned paclitaxel therapy (n = 3), grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (n = 2), chest pain (n = 1) and pulmonary embolism (n = 1). With lead-in lenalidomide, two patients with lymph-node dominant CRPC had a PSA-decline and regression in lymph node disease, respectively.

To begin to address PIP function in vivo, we generated the PIP null mouse (Pip-/-). Additionally, to determine the effect of the loss of PIP on gene expression and to gain insight into some of the molecular mechanisms underlying PIP function, microarray analysis of the submandibular gland was also undertaken. Pip-/- mice developed normally with no overt differences in behaviour or gross morphology and were fertile. However, histological examination of 3-month-old Pip-/- mice sometimes showed enlarged submandibular lymph nodes, lymphocytic aggregations within the prostate lobes, and enlarged medulla in the thymus. Functional analysis of gene expression revealed sets of multiple differentially expressed genes associated with cell death and survival, lipid metabolism, inflammation, immune disease, and cancer, as a consequence of mPIP abrogation.

We previously reported that the inhibition of Akt by inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP(5)) results in anti-tumour properties. To further develop this compound we modified its structure to obtain more potent inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pathway.  Methods:   Cell proliferation/survival was determined by cell counting, sulphorhodamine or acridine orange/ethidium bromide assay; Akt activation was determined by western blot analysis. In vivo effect of compounds was tested on PC3 xenografts, whereas in vitro activity on kinases was determined by SelectScreen Kinase Profiling Service.  Results:   The derivative 2-O-benzyl-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (2-O-Bn-InsP(5)) is active towards cancer types resistant to InsP(5) in vitro and in vivo. 2-O-Bn-InsP(5) possesses higher pro-apoptotic activity than InsP(5) in sensitive cells and enhances the effect of anti-cancer compounds. 2-O-Bn-InsP(5) specifically inhibits 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) in vitro (IC(50) in the low nanomolar range) and the PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in cell lines and excised tumours. It is interesting to note that 2-O-Bn-InsP(5) also inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in vitro.

We investigated the proportion of FPs in a population-based randomised screening trial in Finland.  Methods:   Finland is the largest centre in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. We have completed three screening rounds with a 4-year screening interval (mean follow-up time 9.2 years) using a PSA cutoff level of 4.0 ng ml(-1); in addition, men with PSA 3.0-3.9 and a positive auxiliary test were referred. An FP result was defined as a positive screening result without cancer in biopsy within 1 year from the screening test.  Results:   The proportion of FP screening results varied from 3.3 to 12.1% per round. Of the screened men, 12.5% had at least one FP during three rounds. The risk of next-round PC following an FP result was 12.3-19.7 vs 1.4-3.7% following a screen-negative result (depending on the screening round), risk ratio 3.6-9.9. More than half of the men with one FP result had another one at a subsequent screen. Men with an FP result were 1.5 to 2.0 times more likely to not participate in subsequent rounds compared with men with a normal screening result (21.6-29.6 vs 14.0-16.7%).  Conclusion:   An FP result is a common adverse effect of PC screening and affects at least every eighth man screened repeatedly, even when using a relatively high cutoff level. False-positive men constitute a special group that receives unnecessary interventions but may harbour missed cancers.

The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu is one of the most important oncogenes in human breast cancer. Prepubertal exposure to endogenous estradiol and a phytoestrogen, genistein (Gen), has been shown to reduce future breast cancer risk. Gen downregulates tyrosine kinase regulated protein expression and reduces prostate cancer. In this study, the effects of prepubertal exposure to Gen on rat mammary carcinogenesis and the erbB2/Akt signal pathway were investigated. Prepubertal female Sprague-Dawley rats were daily exposed to Gen at 125 mg/kg (Gen-1) and 500 mg/kg (Gen-5) from postnatal days 22-28. Subsequently, the rats were given a single dose of 100 mg/kg 7.12-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene on postnatal day 42 to induce mammary tumor. The mRNA expression of erbB2 and amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), erbB2, phosphotyrosine protein, Akt, and p-Akt were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The activity of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) was detected by liquid scintillation counting. The percentage of rats with mammary tumors in breast cancer model (BCM), Gen-1, and Gen-5 was 71.43, 52.38, and 33.34%, respectively. The incidence of 7.12-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene-induced mammary tumors significantly decreased in Gen-5 compared with that in BCM. The mRNA levels of AIB1 and erbB2 and the protein levels of erbB2, p-Akt, and PCNA protein expression were downregulated for a long time in the mammary tumors in Gen-5 groups. The activity of PTK was also decreased for a long time. However, the total Akt protein expression did not change significantly among BCM, Gen-1, and Gen-5. Prepubertal exposure of Sprague-Dawley female rats to 500 mg/kg Gen can reduce later breast cancer risk and its protective effect is associated with persistent downregulation of the expression of erbB2, p-Akt, AIB1, and PCNA and with low PTK activity in the mammary tumor. Our results suggest that erbB2/Akt signaling plays a role in tumor formation and targeting erbB2/Akt signaling with prepubertal exposure to Gen may provide greater efficacy to the current therapies used to treat tumors.""","""['Jun-Hua Peng', 'Jun-Dong Zhu', 'Man-Tian Mi', 'Fu-Jun Li', 'Lin Cai', 'Ju-Zi Dong', 'Hua-Xin Zhang', 'Yong Zhao', 'Rong-Li Xue']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Prepubertal octylphenol exposure up-regulate BRCA1 expression, down-regulate ERalpha expression and reduce rat mammary tumorigenesis.', 'Prepubertal estradiol and genistein exposures up-regulate BRCA1 mRNA and reduce mammary tumorigenesis.', 'Prepubertal exposure to zearalenone or genistein reduces mammary tumorigenesis.', 'Genistein chemoprevention: timing and mechanisms of action in murine mammary and prostate.', 'Genistein studies in rats: potential for breast cancer prevention and reproductive and developmental toxicity.', 'Role of dietary bioactive natural products in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.', 'Targeting HER2 Positive Breast Cancer with Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Isoflavone intake inhibits the development of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene(DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in normal and ovariectomized rats.', 'Protective effects of prepubertal genistein exposure on mammary tumorigenesis are dependent on BRCA1 expression.', 'Role of dietary fatty acids in mammary gland development and breast cancer.']"""

Primary EMPD has a better prognosis, and the ability to distinguish between the 2 subsets has clinical relevance. Recent studies have suggested that immunostains, including cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, and BRST-2, distinguish between the 2 groups. We analyzed a large series of EMPD with an expanded immunohistochemical panel to assess its value in distinguishing primary from secondary disease.  Design:   Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 98 EMPD specimens from 61 patients (45 primary and 16 secondary) were immunostained with CK7, CK20, HER-2/neu, BRST-2, CDX2, androgen receptor (AR), and cyclin D1. The study included 44 women and 17 men (median age: 73 years). Median follow-up time was 47 months.  Results:   All EMPD specimens were vibrantly positive for CK7. The frequency of positivity for all EMPD samples was CK20 (28%), BRST-2 (40%), HER-2/neu (64%), CDX2 (10%), AR (16%), and cyclin D1 (76%). For primary EMPD, the frequency of positivity was CK20 (22%), BRST-2 (48%), HER-2/neu (65%), CDX2 (2%), AR (21%), and cyclin D1 (84%). For secondary EMPD, the frequency of positivity was CK20 (50%), BRST-2 (25%), HER-2/neu (60%), CDX2 (33%), AR (0%), and cyclin D1 (53%). Notably, all 6 of 7 cases of EMPD secondary to an anorectal adenocarcinoma tested were HER-2/neu negative and 5 of those 6 cases (80%) were CDX2 positive.  Conclusions:   The role of CK7, CK20, and BRST-2 in distinguishing primary and secondary EMPD is limited because CK20 and BRST-2 were positive in large subsets of both groups. An expanded immunohistochemical panel, including HER-2/neu and CDX2, may be useful in discriminating primary EMPD from EMPD secondary to anorectal adenocarcinoma but fails to distinguish primary EMPD from EMPD secondary to urothelial or prostatic malignancy. The consistent overexpression of HER-2/neu in primary EMPD suggests a role for trastuzumab therapy in patients with recurrent disease.""","""['John Perrotto', 'Jared J Abbott', 'Roger I Ceilley', 'Iftikhar Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Dermatopathol""","""['CDX2, cytokeratins 7 and 20 immunoreactivity in rectal adenocarcinoma.', 'Intestinal-type cervical adenocarcinoma in situ and adenocarcinoma exhibit a partial enteric immunophenotype with consistent expression of CDX2.', 'CK7, CK20, CDX2 and MUC2 Immunohistochemical staining used to distinguish metastatic colorectal carcinoma involving ovary from primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma.', ""Perianal Paget's disease: distinguishing primary and secondary lesions using immunohistochemical studies including gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 and cytokeratin 20 expression."", ""Extramammary Paget's disease: Summary of current knowledge."", 'Rectal Phenotype of Perianal Paget Disease: Rare Concomitant Phenomena.', ""A Case Report of Familial Extramammary Paget's Disease in Female Siblings."", ""Extramammary Paget's Disease: Diagnosis, Pathogenesis, and Treatment with Focus on Recent Developments."", ""Rare Anal Canal Cancer with Secondary Extramammary Paget's Disease (Pagetoid Spread) Complicated by Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin."", 'Modified peripheral and central Mohs micrographic surgery for improved margin control in extramammary Paget disease.']"""

Large numbers of environmental pollutants have been screened to identify such compounds; however, not until recently was 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane (TBECH) identified as the first potent activator of the human androgen receptor (hAR). TBECH has been found in beluga whales and bird eggs and has also been found to be maternally transferred in zebrafish.  Objectives:   In the present study we investigated interaction energies between TBECH diastereomers (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) and the hAR, and their ability to activate the receptor and induce prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression in vitro.  Methods:   We performed computational modeling to determine interaction energies between the ligand and the AR ligand-binding site, and measured in vitro competitive binding assays for AR by polarization fluorometry analysis. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to determine PSA activity in LNCaP and HepG2 cells.  Results:   We found the gamma and delta diastereomers to be more potent activators of hAR than the alpha and beta diastereomers, which was confirmed in receptor binding studies. All TBECH diastereomers induced PSA expression in LNCaP cells even though the AR present in these cells is mutated (T877A). Modeling studies of LNCaP AR revealed that TBECH diastereomers bound to the receptor with a closer distance to the key amino acids in the ligand-binding domain, indicating stronger binding to the mutated receptor.  Conclusions:   The present study demonstrates the ability of TBECH to activate the hAR, indicating that it is a potential endocrine disruptor.""","""['Hazem Khalaf', 'Anders Larsson', 'Håkan Berg', 'Robert McCrindle', 'Gilles Arsenault', 'Per-Erik Olsson']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""Environ Health Perspect""","""['The Effects of the Organic Flame-Retardant 1,2-Dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl) Cyclohexane (TBECH) on Androgen Signaling in Human Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'The brominated flame retardants TBECH and DPTE alter prostate growth, histology and gene expression patterns in the mouse.', 'TBECH, 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2 dibromoethyl) cyclohexane, alters androgen receptor regulation in response to mutations associated with prostate cancer.', '1,2-Dibromo-4-(1,2 dibromoethyl) cyclohexane (TBECH)-mediated steroid hormone receptor activation and gene regulation in chicken LMH cells.', 'A review of 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane in the environment and assessment of its persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity.', 'Occurrence of Halogenated Pollutants in Domestic and Occupational Indoor Dust.', 'Androgen receptor modulation following combination exposure to brominated flame-retardants.', 'rac-(1R,2R,4S)-1,2-Dibromo-4-(1R)-1,2-dibromo-eth-ylcyclo-hexa-ne.', 'Disruption of androgen receptor signaling in males by environmental chemicals.']"""

To treat recurrent disease, cell surface proteins that are specifically overexpressed on malignant cells may be useful for generating targeted therapeutics. Recent evidence suggests that neurotensin receptors (NTR) are recruited in advanced prostate cancer as an alternative growth pathway in the absence of androgens. In this study, we assessed the potential use of these receptors as targets by analyzing NTR expression patterns in human prostate cell lines and primary prostate tumor cell cultures derived from patient samples. In primary tumor cell cultures, NTR1 was upregulated in cells with a basal phenotype (cytokeratin 1/5/10/14+), whereas NTR2 and NTR3 were upregulated in cells with luminal phenotype (cytokeratin 18+). Similar patterns of NTR expression occurred in benign prostate tissue sections, implicating differentiation state as a basis for the differences observed in tumor cell lines.

ErbB3 binding protein 1 (EBP1), a putative repressor of AGR2, is attenuated in prostate cancer. We show that the anti-invasive effect of EBP1 occurs, at least in part, through its ability to inhibit AGR2 expression. Mechanistic investigations indicate that EBP1 downregulates Foxa1- and Foxa2-stimulated AGR2 transcription and decreases metastatic behavior. In contrast, EBP1 ablation upregulates AGR2 via Foxa1- and Foxa2-stimulated AGR2 promoter activity and increases metastatic behavior.

Using recombinant proteins, we show that FKBP51 stimulates recruitment of the cochaperone p23 to the ATP-bound form of Hsp90, forming an FKBP51-Hsp90-p23 superchaperone complex. In cells, FKBP51 expression promotes superchaperone complex association with AR and increases the number of AR molecules that undergo androgen binding. FKBP51 stimulates androgen-dependent transcription and cell growth, and FKBP51 is part of a positive feedback loop that is regulated by AR and androgen. Finally, depleting FKBP51 levels by short hairpin RNA reduces the transcript levels of genes regulated by AR and androgen.

Materials and methods:   Contrast-enhanced harmonic ultrasonography was performed in 103 patients suspected of prostate cancer before biopsy. Time intensity curves were reconstructed for systematic biopsy sites and sonographic abnormalities. The characteristics of the curves were described using hemodynamic indices including arrival time (AT), time-to-peak (TTP), and peak intensity (PI). The differences of hemodynamic indices between high-grade and low-grade cancer were analyzed and the correlations between the hemodynamic indices and biopsy Gleason score were studied.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 41 of 103 patients and there were significant differences in the hemodynamic indices between the biopsy sites of the non-malignant patients and prostate cancer lesions (p < 0.05). The prostate biopsies revealed 154 prostate cancer lesions, including 31 low-grade lesions and 123 high-grade lesions. The hemodynamic indices AT and TTP of high-grade tumors were significantly shorter than those of low-grade tumors (p = 0.001, 0.002). In addition, high-grade peripheral zone (PZ) tumors had higher PI than low-grade PZ tumors (p = 0.009).

Methods and materials:   Seventy-one men with a history of TURP were treated with EBRT for prostate cancer. The median time from TURP to EBRT was 15 months. The median EBRT dose was 70 Gy, and 21 men (30%) received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Acute GU toxicity and late GU toxicity were scored by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria and compared with a cohort of 538 men without prior TURP. The median follow-up for men with TURP and men without TURP was 40 months and 50 months, respectively (p = 0.7605).

PIP3 is bound by AKT which facilities its activation by PDK1. Activated AKT promotes cell survival and stimulates cell proliferation. Class IA PI 3-kinases are heterodimers consisting of a regulatory subunit p85 and a catalytic subunit p110. The p110alpha isoform has been shown to be mutated in a number of tumor types. A number of recent studies suggest that the p110beta isoform may be functionally relevant in prostate cancer. In this study we extend this work to include the examination of the expression and functional properties of p110alpha and p110beta in three different prostate cancer cell lines, DU145, LNCaP, PC3, as well as the non-tumorigenic but immortalized RWPE1 prostate epithelial cell line.  Methods:   Western blot analysis was used to measure protein expression and quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels. After targeted knockdown using isoform-specific siRNAs to reduce PI 3-kinase p110alpha or p110beta isoform expression, we measured downstream signally events such as phosphorylation of AKT, ERK 1/2, PDK, and FOXO, as well as biological consequences such as changes in apoptosis, and alterations in cell cycle progression.  Results:   In all three prostate cancer cell lines examined, targeted knockdown of p110beta, and not p110alpha, resulted in significantly reduced AKT, PDK, and FOXO phosphorylation. While knockdown of either p110 isoform resulted in an increase in apoptosis and a cell cycle arrest in G1 in the remaining non-apoptotic cells, these effects were much more pronounced with knockdown of p110beta.

Transgenic mouse models have proven useful for understanding mechanisms of prostate carcinogenesis. The characterization of genetically modified mouse PrCa models using high-throughput genomic analyses provides important information to guide appropriate experiment applications for such model.  Methods:   We have analyzed the transcriptome of the hormone refractory and highly metastatic Fetal Globin-SV40/T-antigen (Ggamma-globin-Tag) transgenic mouse model for PrCa compared to normal mouse prostate tissue. Gene expression patterns found in Ggamma-globin-Tag mouse prostate tumors were compared with publicly available human localized and metastatic prostate tumors (GEO accession # GSE3325) through hierarchical cluster analysis, Pearson's rank correlation coefficient, and Self Organizing Feature Maps (SOM) analyses.  Results:   Ggamma-globin-Tag tumors clustered closely with human metastatic tumors and gene expression patterns had a significant correlation (P < 0.01), unlike human localized primary tumors (P > 0.6). Bioinformatic analyses identified deregulated genetic pathways and networks in Ggamma-globin-Tag tumors, which displayed similarities to alterations in human PrCa. Changes in the expression of genes involved in DNA replication and repair (Rb1, p53, Myc, PCNA, DNMT3A) and growth factor signaling pathways (TGFbeta2, ERK1/2, NRas, and Notch1) are deregulated in the Ggamma-globin-Tag tumors, suggesting their key role in the oncogenic process. Identification of an enrichment of putative binding sites for transcription factors revealed eight transcription factors that may be important in Ggamma-globin-Tag carcinogenesis, including SP1, NF-Y, CREB, Elk1, and E2F. Novel genes related to microtubule regulation were also identified in Ggamma-globin-Tag tumors as potentially important candidate targets for PrCa. Overexpression of stathmin-1, whose expression was increased in human metastatic prostate tumors, was validated in Ggamma-globin-Tag tumors by immunohistochemistry. This protein belongs to the SV40/T-antigen cancer signature identified in previous studies in prostate, breast, and lung cancer mouse models.  Conclusions:   Our results show that the Ggamma-globin-Tag model for hormone refractory PrCa shares important features with aggressive, metastatic human PrCa.

Methods:   Data from two population-based case-control studies of prostate cancer among Caucasian and African-American men residing in King County, Washington were combined for this analysis. Cases (n = 1,458) were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1993 to 1996 or 2002 to 2005 and were identified through the Seattle-Puget Sound Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry. Controls (n = 1,351) were age-matched to cases and were identified through random digit dialing. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between haplotype-tagging SNPs and prostate cancer risk and disease aggressiveness. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the relationship between SNPs and prostate cancer recurrence and prostate cancer-specific death.  Results:   Nineteen SNPs were evaluated in the key MMR genes: five in MLH1, 10 in MSH2, and 4 in PMS2.

We explored associations between CNV of uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) genes from the 2B subclass, given their prostate specificity and/or involvement in steroid metabolism and PCA risk. We also investigated associations between SNPs in genes (HSD3B1, SRD5A1/2, and AKR1C2) involved in the conversion of testosterone to DHT, and in DHT metabolism and PCA risk. The population consisted of 426 men (205 controls and 221 cases) who underwent prostate-specific antigen screening as part of a PCA early detection program in Tyrol, Austria.  Results:   No association between CNV in UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 and PCA risk was identified. Men carrying the AA genotype at SNP rs6428830 (HSD3B1) had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.0 [95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.1-4.1] compared with men with GG, and men with AG or GG versus AA in rs1691053 (SRD5A1) had an OR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.04-3.13). Individuals carrying both risk alleles had an OR of 3.1 (95% CI, 1.4-6.7) when compared with men carrying neither (P = 0.005).

These enzymes, enhancing the elimination of carcinogens from the body, are known to be polymorphic. Therefore, we evaluated whether a possible association between glucosinolate intake and prostate cancer risk is modified by polymorphisms in GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTA1, GSTP1, or NOQ1 genes. A case-control study including 248 prostate cancer cases and 492 matched controls was nested in the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heidelberg cohort. At baseline, participants provided dietary and lifestyle data and blood samples, which were used for genotyping and measurement of serum glutathione S-transferase-alpha concentration. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by conditional logistic regression. We found an inverse association of glucosinolate intake with prostate cancer risk (adjusted odds ratio, 0.72 per 10 mg/d increment; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.96). Stratification by genotype showed significantly reduced risks for subjects with wild-type of NQO1 (C609T) compared with CT or TT carriers (P(interaction) = 0.04). Those with deletions in both GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes combined had a significantly reduced risk with increasing glucosinolate intake (P(interaction) = 0.01). There was no effect modification of glucosinolate intake and cancer risk by GSTA1 (G-52A) or GSTP1 (A313G) genotype, but serum glutathione S-transferase-alpha concentrations were inversely associated with prostate cancer. This study showed that the inverse association between glucosinolate intake and prostate cancer risk was modified by NQO1 (C609T) and GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletion polymorphisms.

The association of diabetes with prostate cancer outcomes is less clear. We examined the association between diabetes and outcomes after radical prostatectomy and tested whether associations varied by race and/or obesity.  Materials and methods:   This study is a retrospective analysis of 1,262 men treated with radical prostatectomy between 1988 and 2008 within the Shared Equal-Access Regional Cancer Hospital database. We examined the multivariate association between diabetes at surgery and adverse pathology, biochemical recurrence (BCR), and prostate-specific antigen doubling time at recurrence using logistic, proportional hazards, and linear regression, respectively. Data were examined as a whole and stratified by race and obesity.  Results:   Diabetes was more prevalent among black (22% versus 15%, P < 0.001) and more obese men (P < 0.001). Diabetes was associated with higher tumor grade (odds ratio, 1.73; P = 0.002), seminal vesicle invasion (odds ratio, 1.73; P = 0.04), but not BCR (P = 0.67) or PSADT at recurrence (P = 0.12). In the secondary analysis, among white obese men, diabetes was associated with 2.5-fold increased BCR risk (P = 0.002) and a trend toward shorter PSADT, whereas among all other men (nonobese white men and black men), diabetes was associated with 23% lower recurrence risk (P = 0.09) and longer PSADT (P = 0.04).  Conclusion:   In a radical prostatectomy cohort, diabetes was not associated with BCR. In the secondary analysis, diabetes was associated with more aggressive disease in obese white men and less aggressive disease for all other subsets.

Inherited variation in this region is associated with prostate cancer risk in the general population (21-58%), and specific alleles show a strong association in African-American men. This study was designed to evaluate associations between 8q24 risk alleles and clinical variables, such as pathologic stage, age at diagnosis, and recurrence, in a case series of African-American men.  Experimental design:   Peripheral blood DNA samples from 114 African-American men with prostate cancer, including 106 who had undergone radical prostatectomy, were genotyped for six single-nucleotide polymorphisms on three 8q24 regions. The presence of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms was compared with clinicopathologic and follow-up data after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   The mean age of diagnosis and follow-up time were 57.4 (+/-8.9) years and 49.1 (+/-31.6) months, respectively. Patients carrying the Broad11934905 A risk allele, which is specific for African ancestry, were more likely to have a higher pathologic stage (pT(3-4)) than individuals with the wild type (odds ratio, 4.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-14.14; P = 0.011). A trend toward increased frequency of and shorter time to biochemical recurrence was noted in patients with this risk allele on Kaplan-Meier unadjusted survival analysis (P = 0.076).  Conclusions:   The Broad11934905 polymorphism at 8q24, which is only found in people of African ancestry, is associated with an increase in non-organ-confined prostate cancer at prostatectomy.

However, epidemiologic evidence is limited and inconsistent.  Objectives and methods:   We used 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data to examine associations between serum concentrations of OC pesticides and prostate and breast cancers.  Results:   After adjustment for other covariates, serum concentrations of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) (p for trend = 0.02), trans-nonachlor (p for trend = 0.002), and dieldrin (p for trend = 0.04) were significantly associated with the risk of prevalent prostate cancer.

Objectives:   This study was performed to determine the association between coumaphos and other major cancer sites and to explore the consistency of the association with prostate cancer early (1993-1999) and later (2000-2005) in AHS follow-up.  Methods:   This study included 47,822 male licensed pesticide applicators.

Poisson regression was used to estimate rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of cancer for coumaphos exposure controlling for potentially confounding variables.  Results:   Approximately 8% of applicators reported use of coumaphos; 8.5% reported a family history of prostate cancer. Cumulative exposure to coumaphos was not associated with cancer risk overall or with any major cancer site including prostate. In men with a family history of prostate cancer, we observed a positive association between ever use of coumaphos and prostate cancer in both early (RR = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.19-3.62, p-interaction = 0.005) and later (RR = 1.46; 95% CI, 0.89-2.40; p-interaction = 0.11) periods of follow-up.

Evolving theory predicts that normal stem cells (NSCs) are transformed into cancer stem cells (CSCs) that then drive oncogenesis. In humans, arsenic is carcinogenic in the urogenital system (UGS), including the bladder and potentially the prostate, whereas in mice arsenic induces multi-organ UGS cancers, indicating that UGS NSCs may represent targets for carcino-genic initiation. However, proof of emergence of CSCs induced by arsenic in a stem cell population is not available.  Methods:   We continuously exposed the human prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cell line WPE-stem to an environmentally relevant level of arsenic (5 microM) in vitro and determined the acquired cancer phenotype.  Results:   WPE-stem cells rapidly acquired a malignant CSC-like phenotype by 18 weeks of exposure, becoming highly invasive, losing contact inhibition, and hyper-secreting matrix metalloproteinase-9. When hetero-transplanted, these cells (designated As-CSC) formed highly pleomorphic, aggressive tumors with immature epithelial- and mesenchymal-like cells, suggesting a highly pluripotent cell of origin. Consistent with tumor-derived CSCs, As-CSCs formed abundant free-floating spheres enriched in CSC-like cells, as confirmed by molecular analysis and the fact that only these floating cells formed xeno-graft tumors. An early loss of NSC self-renewal gene expression (p63, ABCG2, BMI-1, SHH, OCT-4, NOTCH-1) during arsenite exposure was sub-sequently reversed as the tumor suppressor gene PTEN was progressively suppressed and the CSC-like phenotype acquired.

Methods and materials:   Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at Duke University Medical Center from 1990 to 2007. The cohort was dichotomized according to prostate weight (≤40 and >40 g) and further divided by biopsy scheme: 6-9 (sextant) and 10-20 cores (extended). Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated within each prostate weight group and compared between biopsy schemes.  Results:   A total of 859 patients were included in the study. Patients with prostates >40 g were generally older and had higher PSA levels (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.036, respectively). Unilateral disease was more common in prostates >40 g both on biopsy (69% vs. 60%, P = 0.009) and on final pathology (21% vs. 14%, P = 0.017) despite larger total tumor volume (6.1 vs. 4.8 cc, P < 0.001). Low grade PCa was also more common in larger glands (P = 0.003). Overall, extended biopsy schemes performed better than sextant but the benefit was statistically significant only in prostates >40 g.  Conclusions:   Despite having higher tumor volumes, men with prostate weight >40 g were more likely to have unilateral PCa than those with smaller prostates.

Patients and methods:   We selected patients from the Dutch multicenter trial randomized between 68 Gy and 78 Gy, for whom toxicity data and dose data were available (n = 557). The absolute dose surface parameters of the delineated bladder were calculated. Next, we constructed three-dimensional dose maps of the area around the prostate, providing an approximate identification of the corresponding anatomic locations. The dose difference maps were constructed by subtracting the mean dose maps of the patients with and without late urinary obstruction. Selected local dose points were analyzed using Cox regression analysis.  Results:   Urinary obstruction was scored for 40 patients, including 19 of 296 patients who received 68-72 Gy and 21 of 261 patients who received 76-78 Gy. A total of 19 events occurred within 2 years after irradiation and 21 events after 2 years. The bladder surface receiving >or=80 Gy predicted (p <.01) the occurrence of obstruction within 2 years. The dose difference map indicated highly significant differences in the bladder neck situated in the trigonal region (p < .001) that were especially predictive of obstruction after 2 years and of the diagnosis of bladder neck obstruction.

Nuclear factor-kappa (NF-kappaB) is constitutively activated in prostate cancer, and gives cancer cells resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. To investigate whether Rg3 can suppress the activation of NF-kappaB, and thus increase susceptibility of prostate (LNCaP and PC-3, DU145) cells against chemotherapeutics, prostate cancer cell growth as well as activation of NF-kappaB was examined. We found that a combination treatment of Rg3 (50 microM) with a conventional agent docetaxel (5 nM) was more effective in the inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth and induction of apoptosis as well as G(0)/G(1) arrest accompanied with the significant inhibition of NF-kappaB activity than those by treatment of Rg3 or docetaxel alone. It was also found that NF-kappaB target gene expression of Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 was much more significantly enhanced, but the expression of Bcl-2, inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP-1) and X chromosome IAP (XIAP), and the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin B, D1 and E, and cyclin dependent kinases 2 and 4 was also much more significantly inhibited by the combination treatment. The combination of Rg3 (50 microM) with cisplatin (10 microM) and doxorubicin (2 microM) was also more effective in the inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth and NF-kappaB activity than those by the treatment of Rg3 or chemotherapeutics alone. These results indicate that ginsenoside Rg3 inhibits NF-kappaB, and enhances the susceptibility of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel and other chemotherapeutics.

In addition to cells of the immune system, it is also expressed in various human cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer. We demonstrated previously that synthetic TLR9 ligands induce matrix metalloproteinase-13-mediated invasion in TLR9-expressing prostate cancer cells in vitro. Other studies have suggested possible sex steroid regulation of the function of the various TLRs. The role of TLR9 in the pathophysiology of prostate or any cancer is, however, unknown.  Methods:   Expression of TLR9, androgen receptor (AR), or the estrogen receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta) were studied with immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer (n = 62) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 45) specimens. TLR9 staining scores were compared with tumor stage, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations before tissue sampling and with the staining scores of AR, ERalpha, and ERbeta.  Results:   TLR9 expression was statistically significantly increased in prostate cancer epithelium and stroma, as compared with the same cellular compartments in benign hyperplasia. Significantly increased (P = 0.04) TLR9 expression was detected in cancers with high Gleason score (>7, n = 23), as compared with lower Gleason scores (< or =7, n = 39). No statistically significant associations were detected between TLR9 expression scores and PSA concentrations or tumor staging. Prostate adenocarcinoma cells were all positive for TLR9, AR, and ERbeta but negative for ERalpha expression. In cancer stroma cells, increased TLR9 expression was associated with increased ERalpha expression.

Methods:   We used a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy to stably knock down PAK6 in PC3 and DU145 cells. Radiation sensitivities were compared in PAK6 stably knockdown cells versus the scrambled shRNA-expressing control cells.  Results:   PAK6 mRNA and protein levels in PC3 and DU145 cells were upregulated upon exposure to 6 Gy of radiation. After irradiation, an increased percentage of apoptotic cells and cleaved caspase-3 levels were demonstrated in combination with a decrease in cell viability and a reduction in clonogenic survival in PAK6-knockdown cells. In addition, transfection with PAK6 shRNA blocked cells in a more radiosensitive G2-M phase and increased levels of DNA double-strand breaks. We further explored the potential mechanisms by which PAK6 mediates resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of PAK6 caused a decrease in Ser(112) phosphorylation of BAD, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, which led to enhanced binding of BAD to Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) and release of cytochrome c culminating into caspase activation and cell apoptosis.  Conclusions:   The combination of PAK6 inhibition and irradiation resulted in significantly decreased survival of prostate cancer cells. The underlying mechanisms by which targeting PAK6 may improve radiation response seem to be multifaceted, and involve alterations in cell cycle distribution and impaired DNA double-strand break repair as well as relieved BAD phosphorylation.""","""['Min Zhang', 'Michael Siedow', 'Gregory Saia', 'Arnab Chakravarti']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Knockdown of p21-activated kinase 6 inhibits prostate cancer growth and enhances chemosensitivity to docetaxel.', 'PAK6 increase chemoresistance and is a prognostic marker for stage II and III colon cancer patients undergoing 5-FU based chemotherapy.', 'Group I p21-activated kinases regulate thyroid cancer cell migration and are overexpressed and activated in thyroid cancer invasion.', 'The role of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in inhibition of proliferation in human prostate carcinoma cells by raloxifene: an in vitro experiment.', 'Role of cell cycle in mediating sensitivity to radiotherapy.', 'Hyperactivation of p21-Activated Kinases in Human Cancer and Therapeutic Sensitivity.', 'PAK6 promotes homologous-recombination to enhance chemoresistance to oxaliplatin through ATR/CHK1 signaling in gastric cancer.', 'Targeting of p21-Activated Kinase 4 Radiosensitizes Glioblastoma Cells via Impaired DNA Repair.', 'Integration of immune and hypoxia gene signatures improves the prediction of radiosensitivity in breast cancer.', 'Gene Expression Profile of the Human Colorectal Carcinoma LoVo Cells Treated With Sporamin and Thapsigargin.']"""

Methods:   To identify demethylation hypersensitive site(s) in PMP24 5'-CGI, PC-3 cells with methylated 5'-CGI were treated with a low-dose of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) just sufficient to reactivate gene expression, referred as the limited demethylation approach. Gel shift assays and promoter analyzes were performed to demonstrate the role of the hypersensitive site in PMP24 gene regulation. Transfection of a methylated oligonucleotide corresponding to the hypersensitive site was conducted to determine the effect of site-specific methylation on the gene expression. Bisulfite sequencing analysis was performed to reveal the methylation status of PMP24 promoter in cultured cells and microdissected samples. In situ hybridization was applied to determine expression positivity of PMP24 mRNA.  Results:   A 5-aza-dC hypersensitive site encompasses two CpG dinucleotides in intron 1 was identified. Methylation of the first, but not the second, CpG dinucleotide of this site disrupted DNA-protein interactions and suppressed the gene expression. Using archival specimens, we found the first CpG dinucleotide of the hypersensitive site is hypermethylated with a loss of PMP24 mRNA expression in microdissected PCa cells when compared to normal prostatic epithelial cells.  Conclusions:   These findings support a critical role for a single intronic CpG dinucleotide in PMP24 gene regulation through DNA methylation.

Stable ternary complexes were obtained by generating affinity-matured PRL variants harboring an N-terminal tail from ovine placental lactogen, a closely related PRL receptor (PRLR) ligand. This structure allows one to draw up an exhaustive inventory of the residues involved at the PRL.PRLR site 2 interface, consistent with all previously reported site-directed mutagenesis data.

The model provides a molecular basis for the properties of the different PRL analogs designed to date, including PRLR antagonists. Finally, comparison of our 1:2 PRL.PRLR(2) structure with those of free PRL and its 1:1 complex indicates that the structure of PRL undergoes significant changes when binding the first, but not the second receptor. This suggests that the second PRLR moiety adapts to the 1:1 complex rather than the opposite.

We have characterized the promoter methylation profile of 82 genes in three prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, and DU145) and two normal prostate cell lines (RWPE1 and RWPE2). The methylation pattern was analyzed using a Panomics gene array system that consists of immobilized probes of known gene promoters on a nitrocellulose membrane. Methylation binding protein-purified methylated DNA was hybridized on the membrane and detected by the chemiluminescence method. We analyzed methylation profile in normal (RWPE1) versus cancerous cells and androgen receptor (AR)-sensitive (LNCaP) versus AR-negative cells (DU145 and PC3). Our study shows that >50% of the genes were hypermethylated in prostate cancer cells compared with 13% in normal cell lines. Among these were the tumor suppressor (RB, TMS1, DAPK, RBL1, PAX6, and FHIT), cell cycle (p27KIP1 and CDKN2A), transporters (MDR1, MLC1, and IGRP), and transcription factor (STAT1, CIITA, MYOD, and NPAT) genes. Relative methylation pattern shows that most of these genes were methylated from 5-fold to >10-fold compared with the normal prostate cells. In addition, promoter methylation was detected for the first time in target genes such as RIOK3, STAT5, CASP8, SRBC, GAGE1, and NPAT. A significant difference in methylation pattern was observed between AR-sensitive versus AR-negative cancer cells for the following genes: CASP8, GPC3, CD14, MGMT, IGRP, MDR1, CDKN2A, GATA3, and IFN.

Decreased membrane transport is a mechanism of resistance to gemcitabine. In order to facilitate gemcitabine uptake and prolong retention in the cell, a lipophilic pro-drug was synthesized (CP-4126), with an elaidic fatty acid esterified at the 5'position. CP-4126 was tested in cell lines resistant to cytarabine, another dCyd analog or gemcitabine. Activity of gemcitabine and the derivative was comparable in the parent cell lines, while in dCK deficient cells all compounds were inactive. However, inhibition of nucleoside transport increased the IC(50) for gemcitabine up to 200-fold, but not for CP-4126, underlining the independence of a nucleoside transporter. For in vivo evaluation, nude mice bearing a human xenograft were treated intraperitoneally every third day for five doses at the maximal tolerated dose. In melanoma, sarcoma, lung, prostate, pancreatic and breast cancer xenografts, gemcitabine and CP-4126 were equally and highly effective; in four other xenografts moderately but equally active. In contrast to gemcitabine, CP-4126 could be administered orally, with a schedule and dose dependent toxicity and antitumor activity. In a colon cancer xenograft, antitumor activity of orally administered CP-4126 was equal to the intraperitoneally administered drug. In conclusion, CP-4126 is membrane transporter independent.

This finding, if confirmed, would have a profound effect on the understanding and treatment of an incapacitating disease affecting millions worldwide. We have investigated CFS sufferers in the UK to determine if they are carriers of XMRV.  Methodology:   Patients in our CFS cohort had undergone medical screening to exclude detectable organic illness and met the CDC criteria for CFS. DNA extracted from blood samples of 186 CFS patients were screened for XMRV provirus and for the closely related murine leukaemia virus by nested PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers. To control for the integrity of the DNA, the cellular beta-globin gene was amplified. Negative controls (water) and a positive control (XMRV infectious molecular clone DNA) were included. While the beta-globin gene was amplified in all 186 samples, neither XMRV nor MLV sequences were detected.  Conclusion:   XMRV or MLV sequences were not amplified from DNA originating from CFS patients in the UK. Although we found no evidence that XMRV is associated with CFS in the UK, this may be a result of population differences between North America and Europe regarding the general prevalence of XMRV infection, and might also explain the fact that two US groups found XMRV in prostate cancer tissue, while two European studies did not.""","""['Otto Erlwein', 'Steve Kaye', 'Myra O McClure', 'Jonathan Weber', 'Gillian Wills', 'David Collier', 'Simon Wessely', 'Anthony Cleare']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Contamination of human DNA samples with mouse DNA can lead to false detection of XMRV-like sequences.', 'No evidence for XMRV in German CFS and MS patients with fatigue despite the ability of the virus to infect human blood cells in vitro.', 'Absence of xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus in UK patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Distribution of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) infection in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'XMRV, prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Fake Science: XMRV, COVID-19, and the Toxic Legacy of Dr. Judy Mikovits.', 'Chronic viral infections in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).', 'A Survey on Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) and Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-Related Virus (XMRV) Coinfection in Tehran, Iran.', 'Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-Related Virus (XMRV) and the Safety of the Blood Supply.', 'The saga of XMRV: a virus that infects human cells but is not a human virus.']"""

Although effective, the assumption that freezing serves as a ubiquitous lethal stress is challenged by clinical experience and experimental evidence demonstrating time-temperature-related cell-death dependence. The age-related transformation from an androgen-sensitive (AS) to an androgen-insensitive (AI) phenotype is a major challenge in the management of prostate cancer. AI cells exhibit morphological changes and treatment resistance to many therapies. As this resistance has been linked with alpha6beta4 integrin overexpression as a result of androgen receptor (AR) loss, we investigated whether alpha6beta4 integrin expression, as a result AR loss, contributes to the reported increased freeze tolerance of AI prostate cancer. A series of studies using AS (LNCaP LP and PC-3 AR) and AI (LNCaP HP and PC-3) cell lines were designed to investigate the cellular mechanisms contributing to variations in freezing response. Investigation into alpha6beta4 integrin expression revealed that AI cell lines overexpressed this protein, thereby altering morphological characteristics and increasing adhesion characteristics. Molecular investigations revealed a significant decrease in caspases-8, -9, and -3 levels in AI cells after freezing. Inhibition of alpha6beta4 integrin resulted in increased caspase activity after freezing (similar to AS cells) and enhanced cell death. These data show that AI cells show an increase in post-freeze susceptibility after inhibition of alpha6beta4 integrin function. Further understanding the role of androgen receptor-related alpha6beta4 integrin expression in prostate cancer cells responses to freezing might lead to novel options for neo-adjunctive treatments targeting the AR signaling pathway.""","""['J G Baust', 'D P Klossner', 'R G Vanbuskirk', 'A A Gage', 'V Mouraviev', 'T J Polascik', 'J M Baust']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Cryoablative response of prostate cancer cells is influenced by androgen receptor expression.', 'Hedgehog/Gli supports androgen signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Vitamin D(3) cryosensitization increases prostate cancer susceptibility to cryoablation via mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and necrosis.', 'Non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor and vitamin D agonist are involved in suppressing invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Investigation of Bladder Cancer Cell Response to Cryoablation and Adjunctive Cisplatin Based Cryo/Chemotherapy.', 'Breast Cancer Cryoablation: Assessment of the Impact of Fundamental Procedural Variables in an In Vitro Human Breast Cancer Model.', 'Assessment of Cryosurgical Device Performance Using a 3D Tissue-Engineered Cancer Model.', ""Re-purposing cryoablation: a combinatorial 'therapy' for the destruction of tissue.""]"""

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the indications of the suburethral mesh Invance, giving details on our preoperative evaluation and indication, surgical technique, and the correlation between preoperative findings and functional results.  Methods:   Between February 2006 and January 2009 27 patients underwent surgery. All of them had more than one year of follow up after prostatectomy, urodynamic study and preoperative cystoscopy. Continence was evaluated by the number of pads/day and the ICIQ-UI SF questionnaire. Through a perineal incision three titanium screws with a polipropylene suture were inserted in each ischiopubic rami, and a silicon/polipropylene mesh (Invance) is affixed to them, compressing the bulbar urethra. Patients were divided into two groups: good prognosis (1-2 pads/day without urodynamic anomalies in the filling phase) and bad prognosis (3 pads/day, history of radiotherapy or bladder neck incision, and urodynamic anomalies). Cure was defined as a patient not needing pads, and improvement was defined as decrease in the number of pads per day.  Results:   Median follow up after Invance was 18 months (4-38). Nine patients used one pad/day, 10 used two, and eight used three pads /day. Six cases had underwent previous bladder neck incision and three radiotherapy. Globally, 20 patients (74% ) were cured and five (19% ) had improved. Cure rate was 100% in the good prognosis group and 61% in the bad prognosis group (p=0.03). No intraoperative complications were registered. During the immediate postoperative period,one patient required cystostomy tube for 10 days. Seven patients (26% ) presented perineal discomfort; neither de novo urgency nor urethral erosion nor sling explants due to infection were registered.  Conclusions:   Invance is a safe technique that guarantees a high continence rate in selected patients.

To analyze functional outcomes regarding urinary incontinence (UI) after RP in our centre in the last ten years.  Methods:   We have performed a retrospective study of the 137 patients who had a radical prostatectomy (open retropubic or laparoscopic) on the General University Hospital of Elche from 1998 to 2008. Two patient groups were analyzed, patients who had surgery from 1998 to 2003, and those who had surgery from 2004 to 2008. Stress UI rates after RP were determined in both groups at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months following surgery with patient pad day usage. Urethrovesical anastomosis strictures were also analyzed in each group and their resolution.  Results:   15 patients were excluded from the initial 137 because cT3 stage was detected, remaining 122 prostatectomies with <cT2c stage in the study. Average age was 67 years (50-74). Mean preoperative PSA was 8.1 ng/ml (4.5-25). Biopsy Gleason score was < 6 in 70% (85/122) and 7-8 in 30 % (37/122). In the period between 1998 and 2003, 49 patients underwent surgery and results were: initially continent 28.5% (14/49), continent after one month: 6.1% (3/49), at 3 months: 12.2% (6/49), six months 8.1% ( 4/49) and at a year: 22.4%(11/49). 20.4% (10/49) remain with mild incontinence and moderate/severe 2% (1/49). In this period 78% of the patients remain continent and 22% incontinent. In the period 2004-2008, 73 radical prostatectomies were performed with the following continence rates: initial continence 44% (32/73), after one month 0 patients, 3 months 6.8 % (5/73), 6 months 12.3 % (9/73), a year later 24.6 % (18/73). Mild incontinence was observed in 8.2% ( 6/73) and moderate-severe in 4% (3/73). 88% of the patients achieved continence and 12% remain incontinent.

In this paper, we propose robust nonparametric tools for the description and analysis of microarray data based on the concept of functional depth, which measures the centrality of an observation within a sample. We show that this concept can be easily adapted to high-dimensional observations and, in particular, to gene expression data. This allows the development of the following depth-based inference tools: (1) a scale curve for measuring and visualizing the dispersion of a set of points, (2) a rank test for deciding if 2 groups of multidimensional observations come from the same population, and (3) supervised classification techniques for assigning a new sample to one of G given groups. We apply these methods to microarray data, and to simulated data including contaminated models, and show that they are robust, efficient, and competitive with other procedures proposed in the literature, outperforming them in some situations.""","""['Sara López-Pintado', 'Juan Romo', 'Aurora Torrente']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biostatistics""","""['Multivariate exploratory tools for microarray data analysis.', 'Hybrid particle swarm optimization and tabu search approach for selecting genes for tumor classification using gene expression data.', 'Testing the prediction error difference between 2 predictors.', 'Unsupervised clustering in mRNA expression profiles.', 'Power of the rank test for multi-strata case-control studies with ordinal exposure variables.', 'Band-based similarity indices for gene expression classification and clustering.', 'DepthTools: an R package for a robust analysis of gene expression data.']"""

Rab6C, a newly identified Rab6 subfamily member, has attracted recent attention because its reduced expression might confer a selective advantage to drug-resistant breast cancer cells. Here, we report that RAB6C is a primate-specific retrogene derived from a RAB6A' transcript. RAB6C is transcribed in a limited number of human tissues including brain, testis, prostate, and breast. Endogenous Rab6C is considerably less abundant and has a much shorter half-life than Rab6A'. Comparison of the GTP-binding motifs of Rab6C and Rab6A', homology modeling, and GTP-blot overlay assays indicate that amino acid changes in Rab6C have greatly reduced its GTP-binding affinity. Instead, the noncanonical GTP-binding domain of Rab6C mediates localization of the protein to the centrosome. Overexpression of Rab6C results in G1 arrest, and its specific depletion generates tetraploid cells with supernumerary centrosomes, revealing a role of Rab6C in events related to the centrosome and cell cycle progression. Thus, RAB6C is a rare example of a recently emerged retrogene that has acquired the status of a new gene, encoding a functional protein with altered characteristics compared to Rab6A'.""","""['Joanne Young', 'Julie Ménétrey', 'Bruno Goud']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Mol Biol""","""['Alternative splicing of the human Rab6A gene generates two close but functionally different isoforms.', ""Rab6A and Rab6A' GTPases play non-overlapping roles in membrane trafficking."", 'Rab6 is phosphorylated in thrombin-activated platelets by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism: effects on GTP/GDP binding and cellular distribution.', 'An evolutionary perspective on eukaryotic membrane trafficking.', 'Chapter 5: rab proteins and their interaction partners.', 'Rab6-mediated retrograde trafficking from the Golgi: the trouble with tubules.', 'Structural basis of ELKS/Rab6B interaction and its role in vesicle capturing enhanced by liquid-liquid phase separation.', 'Recurrent evolution of an inhibitor of ESCRT-dependent virus budding and LINE-1 retrotransposition in primates.', ""Multi-omic landscaping of human midbrains identifies disease-relevant molecular targets and pathways in advanced-stage Parkinson's disease."", 'Agent Repurposing for the Treatment of Advanced Stage Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Based on Gene Expression and Network Perturbation Analysis.']"""

Design:   A cross-sectional study (Study 1) assessed sociodemographic and TPB variables (extended by descriptive norm) in 2,426 German men (mean age 56.3 years) who differed in their past CS behavior. A subsample of Study 1 (former nonattenders and irregular attenders, n = 1,032) were followed up 12 months later (Study 2).  Main outcome measures:   The authors measured cross-sectionally the intention to undergo a CS examination within the next 12 months (Study 1), and longitudinally self-reported uptake of prostate and/or colorectal CS within the last 12 months (Study 2).  Results:   When sociodemographic variables were controlled, TPB variables predicted a substantial amount of CS-intention (Delta R2 = .49). Descriptive norm explained variance beyond the classic TPB variables and interacted significantly with subjective norm. Significant predictors of CS uptake were intention and subjective norm with the latter having a different effect in the two subgroups: a high subjective norm (assessed at T1) was associated with higher CS attendance in (former) nonattenders but lower CS attendance in irregular attenders in the following 12 months.  Conclusion:   Social norms play an important role in men's CS intention and behavior. For intention formation, descriptive norm is influential in addition to subjective norm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS; We generated an adenovirus encoding the PSA gene (AxCA-PSA) using the cosmid-terminal protein complex method. DC were infected with AxCA-PSA using the centrifugal method. The ability of CTL to lyse target cells expressing PSA, i.e the PSA-positive prostate cancer cell line, LNCap, and PSA-transduced autologous phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) blasts expressing PSA, was assessed using the 51Cr-release assay. The maturation of DC-PSA stimulated by BCG-CWS was assayed by flow cytometry. The cytotoxic activity enhanced by BCG-CWS was assessed by the 51Cr-release assay.  Results:   DC-PSA induced PSA-specific CTL with 85% cytotoxic activity against LNCaP (effector: target ratio, E:T, of 50:1). However, the cytotoxic activity against PSA-negative cells was very low. Anti-CD8 and anti-major histocompatibility (MHC) class I antibodies blocked PSA-specific cytotoxicity. The PSA-specific killing was reproducible against autologous PHA blast cells expressing PSA, independently of human leukocyte antigen haplotype. Furthermore, the combination of DC-PSA with BCG-CWS remarkably enhanced the PSA-specific cytotoxicity against PHA blasts expressing PSA (15-30% at an E:T ratio of 50:1).  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that DC-PSA can induce MHC class I-restricted PSA-specific CD8+ CTL responses and that DC-PSA matured by BCG-CWS enhance PSA-specific cytotoxicity.

Patients and methods:   In all, 973 laparoscopic RPs (LRPs) were performed or supervised by one surgeon between March 2000 and October 2007 for cT1-3 N0M0 prostate cancer, of which 510 included bilateral neurovascular bundle preservation. A CD technique was used in 240 men and a standard dissection (StD) technique was used in 270, considered the control group. The technique was extraperitoneal, used five ports and included preservation of the seminal vesicle tips. Thermal energy was not used posterior or lateral to the prostate in either group. Patient, operative and oncological outcome variables were compared using an independent-sample t-test if continuous or with Fisher's exact test for rates.  Results:   Patient and cancer characteristics before LRP were similar for the CD and StD groups, and there were no significant perioperative differences either. Positive margins occurred in 11.7% of the CD group and 11.1% of the StD group (P = 0.95). At a mean (range) follow-up of 11.7 (3-24) months for the CD group and 13.1 (3-24) months for the StD group, biochemical recurrence rates were 0% and 1.1%, respectively (P = 0.30). Potency (CD, 62%; StD, 61%; P = 0.89) and continence rates (StD, 97%; CD, 98%; P = 0.83) were comparable between the groups, but there was a statistically significant earlier return to continence in the CD group (P < 0.001 at 3 months).  Conclusions:   For carefully selected men there appears to be no compromise in cancer control with intrafascial dissection in the short term. However, equally there appears to be no significant improvement in potency after LRP.

This Commentary is a challenge to both the current paradigms and techniques to test chemicals for their potential toxicities. While, clearly, our scientific understanding of the mechanisms of chemical-induced toxicity and of the pathogeneses of all human diseases are not complete, the state of scientific understanding seems not only sufficient to know what we are now doing is not sufficient, but that it is adequate enough to make a new paradigm and technological change. Basically, the challenge includes the opinion that human exposure to chemicals, that are associated with one or more health endpoints (birth defects, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, reproductive and neurological dysfunctions), is the result of epigenetic , not mutagenic or genotoxic, mechanisms. In addition, it is postulated that the adult human stem cell should be considered the ''target'' cell for the important chemical-induced health effects. To test this hypothesis that altering the quantity and quality of adult stem cells by chemical exposures during in utero, neonatal, adolescent, adult and geriatric phases of life can lead to health consequences, it is recommended that 3-D in vitro cultures be used on male and female human adult stem cells from a few major organs (e.g., heart, brain, liver, lung, kidney, breast, prostate ). Altered stem cell biology (e.g., increase or decrease in the stem cell numbers in specific organs; altered apoptotic and differentiation frequencies), as well as measured cell-cell communication, should be seriously considered as toxicity endpoints.""","""['James E Trosko']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Hum Exp Toxicol""","""[""Commentary on ''Toxicity testing in the 21st century: a vision and a strategy''."", ""An integrated summary of commentary on the National Academy of Sciences report on ''Toxicity testing in the 21st century: a vision and a strategy''."", ""Commentary on ''Toxicity testing in the 21st century: a vision and a strategy''."", 'Factors to consider in the use of stem cells for pharmaceutic drug development and for chemical safety assessment.', 'Safety and nutritional assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed: the role of animal feeding trials.', 'Categorizing the characteristics of human carcinogens: a need for specificity.', 'Toxicants target cell junctions in the testis: Insights from the indazole-carboxylic acid model.', 'Environmental toxicants perturb human Sertoli cell adhesive function via changes in F-actin organization mediated by actin regulatory proteins.', 'The gap junction as a ""Biological Rosetta Stone"": implications of evolution, stem cells to homeostatic regulation of health and disease in the Barker hypothesis.']"""

Methods:   We describe the clinical presentation and management of a case of Cushing syndrome attributable to ectopic ACTH secretion from small cell cancer of the prostate.  Results:   In a 70-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes, congestive heart failure developed. He was found to have severe hypokalemia (serum potassium, 1.7 mEq/L) and a huge pelvic mass on a computed tomographic scan performed because of a complaint of urinary retention. Transurethral biopsy of the prostate showed features of small cell prostate cancer. Hormonal evaluation revealed a high urine free cortisol excretion of 6,214.5 microg/d (reference range, 36 to 137), confirming the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. A serum ACTH level was elevated at 316 ng/dL (reference range, 10 to 52). An overnight high-dose (8 mg orally) dexamethasone suppression test was positive (serum cortisol levels were 43.2 and 41 microg/dL before and after suppression, respectively), and magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland disclosed no abnormalities. A prostate biopsy specimen showed small cell prostate cancer with positive staining for ACTH. The tumor was found to be unresectable, and the poor condition of the patient did not allow for bilateral adrenalectomy. He was treated with ketoconazole and metyrapone, which yielded good temporary control of his Cushing syndrome (24-hour urine free cortisol decreased to 55.2 microg/d). He received 1 cycle of chemotherapy (etoposide and cisplatin), but he died 6 months later as a result of sepsis.  Conclusion:   Small cell prostate cancer is a rare subtype that can be associated with ectopic secretion of ACTH and severe Cushing syndrome.

Perceptible limits are a function of the size, depth, and hardness of abnormalities within a given prostate stiffness.  Methods:   To better understand the perceptible limits of the DRE, we conducted a psychophysical study with 18 participants using a custom-built apparatus to simulate prostate tissue and abnormalities of varying size, depth, and hardness. Utilizing a modified version of the psychophysical method of constant stimuli, we uncovered thresholds of absolute detection and variance in ability between examiners.  Results:   Within silicone-elastomers that mimic normal prostate tissue (21kPa), abnormalities of 4mm diameter (20mm(3) volume) and greater were consistently detectable (above 75% of the time) but only at a depth of 5mm. Abnormalities located in simulated tissue of greater stiffness (82kPa) had to be twice that volume (5mm diameter, 40mm(3) volume) to be detectable at the same rate.  Conclusions:   This study finds that the size and depth of abnormalities most influence detectability, while the relative stiffness between abnormalities and substrate also affects detectability for some size/depth combinations.

The frequency of false positive and false negative cases recommends local validation.  Methods:   The aim of this study was to detect newly diagnosed, false positive and false negative cases of cancer from hospital discharge claims, using four Spanish population-based cancer registries as the gold standard. Prostate cancer was used as a case study.  Results:   A total of 2286 incident cases of prostate cancer registered in 2000 were used for validation. In the most sensitive algorithm (that using five diagnostic codes), estimates for Sensitivity ranged from 14.5% (CI95% 10.3-19.6) to 45.7% (CI95% 41.4-50.1). In the most predictive algorithm (that using five diagnostic and five surgical codes) Positive Predictive Value estimates ranged from 55.9% (CI95% 42.4-68.8) to 74.3% (CI95% 67.0-80.6). The most frequent reason for false positive cases was the number of prevalent cases inadequately considered as newly diagnosed cancers, ranging from 61.1% to 82.3% of false positive cases. The most frequent reason for false negative cases was related to the number of cases not attended in hospital settings. In this case, figures ranged from 34.4% to 69.7% of false negative cases, in the most predictive algorithm.  Conclusions:   HDAD might be a helpful tool for cancer registries to reach their goals.

Aim. To ascertain post-treatment utilization of pharmacotherapies for erectile dysfunction (ED) using a population-based approach.  Methods:   We identified 38,958 men who underwent definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer during 2003-2006 from the MarketScan Medstat data.  Main outcome measures:   We compared the use of ED pharmacotherapy at baseline (up to 3 months prior) and up to 30 months following radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy (RT) for localized prostate cancer by utilizing National Drug Classification codes for phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5I), intracavernosal injectable therapies (IT), urethral suppositories and vacuum erection devices (VED). In adjusted analyses, we controlled for the effect of age, comorbidity, type of treatment, health plan and use of adjuvant hormone therapy on the use of pharmacotherapies. Results. Men undergoing RP vs. RT were younger with less co-morbid conditions. Utilization of PDE5I was up to three times greater for men undergoing RP vs. RT, 25.6% vs. 8.8%, (P < 0.0001) in the first post-treatment year, and usage of these agents was greatest for men undergoing minimally-invasive RP procedures. A higher percentage of men also used IT, suppositories and VED after RP vs. RT (P < 0.001). However, more men in the RT group received adjuvant hormonal therapy (39.53% vs. 5.25% for RP, P < 0.01). In adjusted analyses, men undergoing RP vs. RT were more than two times likely (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.98, 2.26) to use PDE5I post-treatment while men on adjuvant hormonal therapy were less likely to use PDE5I (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.70-0.79, P < 0.0001).

The significance of PSA may be different from one ethnic group to another. Radiologic findings may be helpful in detecting prostate carcinoma.  Methods:   We reviewed the findings of 348 prostate biopsies performed in a 4-year period. Of these, 278 cases were performed under ultrasound guidance and 70 were performed transrectally under digital guidance. PSA, PSA ratio, Gleason score and radiology findings were determined.  Results:   Forty-three percent of the cases were diagnosed as having adenocarcinoma. The mean age for cancer patients was 68.4 years. The mean PSA level for patients with carcinoma was 23.4 ng/mL compared to 11.2 ng/mL for benign cases. Carcinoma occurred in 11% (PSA <4 ng/mL); 48.7% (PSA=4-10 ng/mL); 50.6% (PSA= 10-30 ng/mL); 72% (PSA >30 ng/mL). The PSA ratio for cancer cases was 9.9% compared to 13.7% for benign cases. The average Gleason score for all cancers was 7 of 10. There was no relationship between PSA level and Gleason score. The higher the Gleason score, the higher the percentage of carcinoma present in the cores. Most of the carcinomas (100/122) showed hypoechoic areas on ultrasound exam, while heterogeneous areas favored a benign lesion in 54/76, with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 38%.  Conclusions and implications:   The higher the PSA, the greater the chance of having cancer. PSA has a low positive predictive value for prostate carcinoma. Twenty-eight percent of PSA >30 can be attributed to benign conditions. A PSA ratio <10 is suggestive of carcinoma.

Quality of life was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, distress was measured with the Distress Thermometer, and anxiety and depression were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. African-American and Caucasian men were matched on age, education, and stage of disease, and compared on emotional well-being, distress, anxiety, and depression.  Results:   The mean age of the 55 African-American was 63 years old. In non-matched comparison, African-American men had elevated levels of distress, anxiety, and depression similar to Caucasian men. African-American men reported high levels of clinically significant distress (>31%) and anxiety (>23%). However, after matching the African-American and Caucasian men, African-American men reported higher mean scores on emotional well-being (p<0.05) and a lower percentage of African-American men displayed clinically significant depressive symptoms (p<0.05) compared with Caucasian men.  Conclusions:   After matching the sample, African-American men seem to display a sense of resilience, demonstrating greater emotional well-being and a lower incidence of clinically significant depressive symptoms, compared with Caucasian men. This is consistent with cross-cultural research outside of prostate cancer. Continued research is needed to further elucidate the concept of resiliency in African-American men with prostate cancer.""","""['Christian J Nelson', 'Eliana M Balk', 'Andrew J Roth']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Assessing anxiety in Black men with prostate cancer: further data on the reliability and validity of the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC).', 'Uncertainty in prostate cancer.

These compounds exist in foods and are widely consumed. Resveratrol is a grape-derived stilbene, which possesses a wide range of health-promoting activities, including anticancer properties. Several other stilbenes structurally similar to resveratrol are also available in food, but their biological activities remain largely unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of resveratrol and its natural derivatives pterostilbene, trans-resveratrol trimethylether, trans-pinostilbene and trans-desoxyrhapontigenin on androgen-responsive human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. We found that these compounds exert differential effects on LNCaP cell growth, cell cycle and apoptosis. Trans-resveratrol trimethylether appeared to be the most potent compound among the stilbenes tested. Treatment of LNCaP cells with trans-resveratrol trimethylether resulted in G2/M blockage while other compounds, including resveratrol, induced G1/S arrest. Moreover, different from other compounds, trans-resveratrol trimethylether induced apoptosis. At the molecular level, the effects of these compounds on cell cycle correlated with induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A and B mRNA levels. Additionally, these compounds also inhibited both androgen- as well as estrogen-mediated pathways. These results provide mechanistic information on how resveratrol and its methylether analogs may act to contribute to potential antiprostate cancer activity.""","""['Thomas T Y Wang', 'Norberta W Schoene', 'Young S Kim', 'Cassia S Mizuno', 'Agnes M Rimando']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Nutr Food Res""","""['Mechanisms involved in resveratrol-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer-derived cell lines.', 'Antiproliferative effects of resveratrol and the mediating role of resveratrol targeting protein NQO2 in androgen receptor-positive, hormone-non-responsive CWR22Rv1 cells.', 'Molecular effects of soy phytoalexin glyceollins in human prostate cancer cells LNCaP.', 'Resveratrol and other Stilbenes: Effects on Dysregulated Gene Expression in Cancers and Novel Delivery Systems.', 'Biological activity of piceatannol: leaving the shadow of resveratrol.', 'Inhibition of miR-20a by pterostilbene facilitates prostate cancer cells killed by NK cells via up-regulation of NKG2D ligands and TGF-β1down-regulation.', 'Resveratrol Enhances the Anti-Cancer Effects of Cis-Platinum on Human Cervical Cancer Cell Lines by Activating the SIRT3 Relative Anti-Oxidative Pathway.', 'Inhibitory Effects of Pinostilbene on Adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes: A Study of Possible Mechanisms.', 'Antiparasitic Effect of Stilbene and Terphenyl Compounds against Trypanosoma cruzi Parasites.', 'A Systematic Review of the Potential Chemoprotective Effects of Resveratrol on Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity: Focus on the Antioxidant, Antiapoptotic, and Anti-Inflammatory Activities.']"""

This study compared clinical and pathological characteristics of screen-detected and clinically diagnosed prostate cancers and evaluated the effectiveness of PSA screening for early detection of prostate cancer in Nanjing. Between July 2004 and December 2005, 8,562 men aged ≥ 50 years were included for PSA screening. Participants with serum PSA ≥ 4.0 ng/ml were recommended for transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate needle biopsy (TRNB). During the same period, 82 consecutive clinically diagnosed prostate cancers were included as controls. The clinical and pathological features of the screened versus clinically diagnosed cancers were evaluated. A total of 719 (8.4%) of screened men had PSA levels ≥ 4.0 ng/ml. Biopsy was performed in 295 men, and 58 prostate cancers were detected. The biopsy rate, positive predictive value (PPV), and detection rate were 41.0, 19.7, and 0.68%, respectively. More screened patients were found with PSA levels <20 ng/ml (55.2 vs. 22.4%, P < 0.001), Gleason scores <7 (60.3 vs. 34.1%, P = 0.002), organ-confined tumors (87.9 vs. 26.8%, P < 0.001), and opportunities for radical prostatectomy (50.0 vs. 18.3%, P < 0.001) than that in clinically diagnosed patients. PSA screening is effective for early detection of prostate cancer in Chinese elderly men.

Materials and methods:   Twenty-six patients with a high clinical suspicion for prostate cancer and no prior treatment underwent DCE MRI examination at 3.0 T before biopsy. DCE MRI data were fitted to a pharmacokinetic model using three forms of AIF: an individually measured, a local population average, and a literature double exponential population average. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to correlate MRI with the biopsy results. Goodness of fit (chi(2)) for the three AIFs was compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.  Results:   Average volume transfer constant (K(trans)) values were significantly higher in tumor than in normal peripheral zone for all three AIFs. The individually measured and the local population average AIFs had the highest sensitivity (76%), whereas the double exponential AIF had the highest specificity (82%). The areas under the ROC curves were not significantly different between any of the AIFs (0.81, 0.76, and 0.81 for the individually measured, local population average, and double exponential AIFs, respectively). chi(2) was not significantly different for the three AIFs; however, it was significantly higher in enhancing than in nonenhancing regions for all three AIFs.

In ovarian cancer cells WWOX transfection abolishes tumourigenicity, suppresses tumour cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and induces apoptosis in non-adherent cells. One-third of ovarian tumours show loss of WWOX expression, and this loss significantly associates with clear cell and mucinous histology, advanced stage, low progesterone receptor expression and poor survival, suggesting that WWOX status affects ovarian cancer progression and prognosis. Genetic variation in other tumour suppressors (e.g. p53 and XPD) is reported to modify cancer progression/outcome, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the WWOX gene are reported to associate with prostate cancer risk. We previously identified polymorphic variants within WWOX, some of which have potential to affect its expression. We therefore examined a cancer modifier role for these WWOX variants. Eight SNPs, based upon location, frequency and potential to affect WWOX expression, were genotyped in 554 ovarian cancer patients (CGP samples), and associations with pathological and survival data were examined. The CGP samples demonstrated significant associations after Bonferroni correction between Isnp1 and both tumour grade (p(corr)=0.033) and histology (p(corr)=0.046), Isnp8 and tumour grade (p(corr)=0.032) and T1497G and progression-free survival (p(corr)=0.037).

PCa loses expression of CD44 standard (CD44s) that is present in benign epithelium, and overexpresses the novel splice variant isoform, CD44v7-10.  Methods:   Using retroviral gene delivery to PC-3M PCa cells, we expressed luciferase-only, enforced CD44s re-expression as a fusion protein with luciferase at its C-terminus or as a protein separate from luciferase, or knocked down CD44v7-10 by RNAi. Invasion, migration, proliferation, soft agar colony formation, adhesion, Docetaxel sensitivity, and xenograft growth assays were carried out. Expression responses of merlin, a CD44 binding partner, and growth-permissive phospho-merlin, were assessed by western blot.  Results:   Compared to luciferase-only PC-3M cells, all three treatments reduced invasion and migration. Growth and soft agar colony formation were reduced only by re-expression of CD44s as a separate or fusion protein but not CD44v7-10 RNAi. Hyaluronan and osteopontin binding were greatly strengthened by CD44s expression as a separate protein, but not a fusion protein. CD44v7-10 RNAi in PC-3M cells caused marked sensitization to Docetaxel; the two CD44s re-expression approaches caused minimal sensitization. In limited numbers of mouse subcutaneous xenografts, all three alterations produced only nonsignificant trends toward slower growth compared with luciferase-only controls. The expression of CD44s as a separate protein, but not a fusion protein, caused emergence of a strongly-expressed, hypophosphorylated species of phospho-merlin.  Conclusion:   Stable re-expression of CD44s reduces PCa growth and invasion in vitro, and possibly in vivo, suggesting CD44 alterations have potential as gene therapy. When the C-terminus of CD44s is fused to another protein, most phenotypic effects are lessened, particularly hyaluronan adhesion. Finally, CD44v7-10, although it was not functionally significant for growth, may be a target for chemosensitization.""","""['Kui Yang', 'Yaqiong Tang', 'Gabriel K Habermehl', 'Kenneth A Iczkowski']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Cell adhesion molecule CD44: its functional roles in prostate cancer.', 'Phenyl-methylene hydantoins alter CD44-specific ligand binding of benign and malignant prostate cells and suppress CD44 isoform expression.', 'In vitro and in vivo prostate cancer metastasis and chemoresistance can be modulated by expression of either CD44 or CD147.', 'CD44: structure, function, and association with the malignant process.', 'Involvement of CD44 and its variant isoforms in membrane-cytoskeleton interaction, cell adhesion and tumor metastasis.', 'Culture and identification of tumor stem cells from surgically resected colorectal cancer tissues.', 'Current Stem Cell Biomarkers and Their Functional Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer.', 'Downregulation of ATOH8 induced by EBV-encoded LMP1 contributes to the malignant phenotype of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Dual role of CD44 isoforms in ampullary adenocarcinoma: CD44s predicts poor prognosis in early cancer and CD44ν is an indicator for recurrence in advanced cancer.', 'Expression of CD44 in pancreatic cancer and its significance.']"""

Intravenous (i.v.) doses of 0, 2.74, 5.48 and 10.95 mg/kg/day (54.8, 109.6 or 219 mg/m(2)/day) were administered on a per day x 5 days (qd x 5) schedule. NLCQ-1 was formulated as a solution in sterile saline at 1.5 mg/ml. None of the dogs died during this 33-day study. With few exceptions, most of the clinical signs of toxicity were noted within 2 hr following dosing in the 10.95 mg/kg/day dose group. These observations included aggressive behaviour, ataxia, tachypnea, emesis, hypoactivity, excessive salivation, tremors, and involuntary urination and defecation. Aggressive behaviour was judged to be dose-limiting. No clinical signs of toxicity were noted during the 28-day observation period that followed the 5-day dose period. Findings in a functional observation battery examination were consistent with the clinical observations. No drug-related effects were noted on the body weight or food consumption values, and no drug-related changes were noted during ocular examinations made on these animals prior to scheduled necropsy or during examination of electrocardiogram recordings made at 15 min. and 2 hr after dosing on days 1 and 5. No definitive changes in haematology, clinical chemistry or coagulation values were noted in dogs treated with NLCQ-1. NLCQ-1 was detected in the plasma of treated dogs on days 1 and 5, up to 60 min. after dosing (2.74 and 5.48 mg/kg/day) and up to 8 hr after dosing (10.95 mg/kg/day). There was a dose-related increase in maximum plasma concentration of NLCQ-1 at 5 min. after dosing; comparable concentrations were noted on days 1 and 5. No definitive test article-related lesions were noted during microscopic evaluation of tissues from dogs in this study, although lesions noted at the injection site and in the vascular tissue, lungs, thymus, prostate gland, muscle, adrenal cortex and tongue may have resulted from treatment with this drug. Any drug-related toxicity noted was readily reversible and not cumulative. No sex difference was detected in the susceptibility to NLCQ-1-induced toxicity.""","""['Maria V Papadopoulou', 'William D Bloomer', 'Vincent R Torti', 'John G Page']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol""","""['Investigational new drug-directed, 5-day repeat dose toxicity study of 4-3-(2-nitro-1-imidazolyl)-propylamino-7-chloroquinoline hydrochloride (NLCQ-1, NSC 709257) administered with or without Taxol in Sprague-Dawley rats.', 'NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Coumarin (CAS No. 91-64-5) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies).', 'NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Promethazine Hydrochloride (CAS No. 58-33-3) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies).', 'Final report on the safety assessment of capsicum annuum extract, capsicum annuum fruit extract, capsicum annuum resin, capsicum annuum fruit powder, capsicum frutescens fruit, capsicum frutescens fruit extract, capsicum frutescens resin, and capsaicin.', 'NLCQ-1 (NSC 709257): exploiting hypoxia with a weak DNA-intercalating bioreductive drug.']"""

However, the reliability of transcriptome analyses is limited by the RNA quality.  Objective:   Identification of variables influencing the RNA quality in radical prostatectomy specimens.  Material and methods:   RNA was extracted using an automatic extraction method for 354 samples from 38 fresh frozen prostate slices, and by manual extraction for 28 samples from 5 slices. RNA quality was measured using the RIN method (RNA Integrity Number). Evaluation of tissue composition was performed by light-microscopy for each sample. Age, total operative time, estimated blood loss, prostate volume, prostate specific antigen (s-PSA) and postoperative Gleason score were registered. The independent variables were correlated to the RIN score in a multiple linear regression model, taking p < 0.05 as the significance limit.  Results:   The amount of blood loss during prostatectomy and the amount of stroma in the tissue sample both correlated negatively with the RIN score (p = 0.03 and 0.02). Automatically extracted samples which were exposed to heat according to the RNA extraction protocol, had lower mean RNA quality (5.5, 1.46 SD) than manually extracted samples, not exposed to heat (8.7, 0.86 SD), suggesting degradation by temperature sensitive RNases, mainly residing in the stroma.

A definitive RALP ""learning curve"" has not been defined and existing learning curves do not account for urologists without prior advanced laparoscopic skills. Therefore, an easily evaluable metric, the ""oncological experience curve,"" would be clinically useful to all urologists performing RALP. Positive surgical margin (PSM) status for all subjects undergoing RALP during the first 4 years of a single surgeon's experience was assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses and logistic regression identified predictors of PSM creation and their correlation with surgeon case volume. The oncological experience curve was defined as the case point at which only pT2 stage, not surgeon volume (and thus surgeon inexperience), predicted PSM in the logistic regression. A total of 469 consecutive subjects comprised our cohort. Overall pT2 and pT3 PSM rates were 20% and 40%, respectively. Preoperative prostate-specific antigen, pathologic stage, and year of surgery were associated with PSM occurrence. Pathologic stage exclusively correlated to PSM in pT2 specimens for the first time during the fourth year, after 290 subjects had been treated. pT2 PSM rate before and after Case 290 was 25% and 10%, respectively (p < 0.001). The oncological experience curve is a clinically meaningful measure to evaluate the RALP learning curve for non-fellowship-trained urologists.

Personal information, urological symptom history and anthropometrics were recorded, digital rectal examination performed, and 30 mLs of fasting blood collected for prostatic specific antigen and fatty acid (FA) analysis. Odds ratio (OR) of PCa risk was determined by unconditional logistic regression with the plasma FA 1st quartile as reference, controlling for age, education, waist-to-hip ratio, and family history.  Results:   Mean ages for 66 (22.6%) cases and 226 (77.4%) controls were 71.9+/-11.47 and 56.7+/-12.69 years, P<.001, and median (25th, 75th percentile) fasting plasma FA were 2,447 (2,087, 3,024) and 2,373 (2,014, 2,751) microg/mL, respectively.

Thirty-eight miRNAs showed increased expression in any prostate cancer cell line after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5azadC) and trichostatin A (TSA) treatments. Six of these also had decreased expression in clinical prostate cancer samples compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The study cohort comprised of 23,320 men participating in the screening arm of the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial during 1996-2004. Information on medication use was obtained from a comprehensive national prescription database. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for prostate cancer. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was compared between current users and non-users of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Compared with medication non-users, the overall prostate cancer incidence was decreased among statin users [HR 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.89]. The inverse association was dose-dependent with cumulative amount of statin use, and strongest for low-grade and early stage tumors. The incidence was nonsignificantly lower also among users of other types of cholesterol-lowering drugs (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.28-1.38), but without dose-dependence. Age-adjusted median serum PSA tended to be lower among users of cholesterol-lowering drugs, but the relative risk decrease among statin users was not related to decreased PSA.

IMRT optimization is computationally expensive and has therefore led to the use of heuristic (e.g., simulated annealing and genetic algorithms) approaches that do not encompass a global view of the solution space. We modify the traditional two-stage IMRT optimization process by augmenting the second stage via an accurate Monte Carlo-based kernel-superposition dose calculations corresponding to beam apertures combined with an exact mathematical programming-based sequential optimization approach that uses linear programming (SLP). Our approach was tested on three challenging clinical test cases with multileaf collimator constraints corresponding to two vendors. We compared our approach to the conventional IMRT planning approach, a direct-aperture approach and a segment weight optimization approach. Our results in all three cases indicate that the SLP approach outperformed the other approaches, achieving superior critical structure sparing. Convergence of our approach is also demonstrated. Finally, our approach has also been integrated with a commercial treatment planning system and may be utilized clinically.""","""['Hao H Zhang', 'Robert R Meyer', 'Jianzhou Wu', 'Shahid A Naqvi', 'Leyuan Shi', ""Warren D D'Souza""]""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['MCTP system model based on linear programming optimization of apertures obtained from sequencing patient image data maps.', 'Dose verification of an IMRT treatment planning system with the BEAM EGS4-based Monte Carlo code.', 'Evaluation of dose prediction errors and optimization convergence errors of deliverable-based head-and-neck IMRT plans computed with a superposition/convolution dose algorithm.', 'Direct aperture optimization for IMRT using Monte Carlo generated beamlets.', 'Improving IMRT-plan quality with MLC leaf position refinement post plan optimization.', 'A Treatment Planning Method for Better Management of Radiation-Induced Oral Mucositis in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer.']"""

However, a biological function is not simply controlled by an individual gene since genes function in a cooperative manner to achieve biological processes. In the study of human diseases, rather than to discover disease related genes, identifying disease associated pathways and modules becomes an essential problem in the field of systems biology.  Results:   In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect disease related gene modules or dysfunctional pathways based on global characteristics of interactome coupled with gene expression data. Specifically, we exploit interacting relationships between genes to define a gene's active score function based on the kernel trick, which can represent nonlinear effects of gene cooperativity. Then, modules or pathways are inferred based on the active scores evaluated by the support vector regression in a global and integrative manner. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are comprehensively validated by using both simulated and real data with the comparison to existing methods.  Conclusions:   By applying the proposed method to two cancer related problems, i.e. breast cancer and prostate cancer, we successfully identified active modules or dysfunctional pathways related to these two types of cancers with literature confirmed evidences. We show that this network-based method is highly efficient and can be applied to a large-scale problem especially for human disease related modules or pathway extraction.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that high vitamin D status protects men from prostate cancer and the active form of vitamin D, 1alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D) has anti-cancer effects in cultured prostate cells. Still, the molecular mechanisms and the gene targets for vitamin D-mediated prostate cancer prevention are unknown.  Results:   We examined the effect of 1,25(OH)2D (+/- 100 nM, 6, 24, 48 h) on the transcript profile of proliferating RWPE1 cells, an immortalized, non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line that is growth arrested by 1,25(OH)2D (Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0, n = 4/treatment per time and dose). Our analysis revealed many transcript level changes at a 5% false detection rate: 6 h, 1571 (61% up), 24 h, 1816 (60% up), 48 h, 3566 (38% up). 288 transcripts were regulated similarly at all time points (182 up, 80 down) and many of the promoters for these transcripts contained putative vitamin D response elements. Functional analysis by pathway or Gene Set Analysis revealed early suppression of WNT, Notch, NF-kB, and IGF1 signaling. Transcripts related to inflammation were suppressed at 6 h (e.g. IL-1 pathway) and suppression of proinflammatory pathways continued at later time points (e.g. IL-17 and IL-6 pathways). There was also evidence for induction of anti-angiogenic pathways and induction of transcripts for protection from oxidative stress or maintenance of cell redox homeostasis at 6 h.  Conclusions:   Our data reveal of large number of potential new, direct vitamin D target genes relevant to prostate cancer prevention. In addition, our data suggests that rather than having a single strong regulatory effect, vitamin D orchestrates a pattern of changes within prostate epithelial cells that limit or slow carcinogenesis.""","""['Pavlo L Kovalenko', 'Zhentao Zhang', 'Min Cui', 'Steve K Clinton', 'James C Fleet']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Differential expression and regulation of vitamin D hydroxylases and inflammatory genes in prostate stroma and epithelium by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in men with prostate cancer and an in vitro model.', 'microRNAs and DICER1 are regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in prostate stroma.', 'Effects of 1α,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 and testosterone on miRNA and mRNA expression in LNCaP cells.', 'Inhibition of prostate cancer growth by vitamin D: Regulation of target gene expression.', 'Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma?', 'SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Targets Host Selenoproteins and Glutathione Biosynthesis for Knockdown via Proteolysis, Potentially Disrupting the Thioredoxin and Glutaredoxin Redox Cycles.', 'Association of Vitamin D Deficiency and Insufficiency with Pathology in Hospitalized Patients.', 'Vitamin D Metabolites in Nonmetastatic High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients with and without Zoledronic Acid Treatment after Prostatectomy.', 'Effect of Menadione and Combination of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin\xa0on Cancer Stem Cells in Human Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Cell Line A549.', 'Is Vitamin D Deficiency Related to Increased Cancer Risk in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus?']"""

TH1 interacts with AR both in vitro and in vivo, decreases the stability of AR, and promotes AR ubiquitination in a ligand-independent manner. TH1 also associates with AR at the active androgen-responsive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter in the nucleus of LNCaP cells. Decrease of endogenous AR protein by TH1 interferes with androgen-induced luciferase reporter expression and reduces endogenous PSA expression.

Methods:   RNA from radical prostatectomy tumour specimens was analysed using cDNA-mediated, annealing, selection, extension and ligation (DASL) to determine mRNAs associated with TMPRSS2-ERG T1/E4 fusion and prognostic of biochemical recurrence. Differentially expressed mRNAs in T1/E4-positive tumours were determined using significance analysis of microarrays (false discovery rate (FDR) <5%). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression determined genes, gene signatures and clinical factors prognostic of recurrence (P-value <0.05, log-rank test). Analysis of two prostate microarray studies (GSE1065 and GSE8402) validated the findings.  Results:   In the 139 patients from this study and from a 455-patient Swedish cohort, 15 genes in common were differentially regulated in T1/E4 fusion-positive tumours (FDR <0.05).

The practiced gold standard for treating severe stress urinary incontinence has been the artificial urinary sphincter. No such consensus exists for mild to moderate incontinence. This paper is about an incontinence operation with the goal to support postprostatectomy sphincter laxity.  Methods:   The hypothesis of postprostatectomy sphincter laxity is new, as well as restoring continence by proximal relocation of the proximal corpus spongiosum. Abstracts dealing with these issues are summarized. Selected points of technique are highlighted, including modifications that have been made along the way. Lastly the first and last 20 patients treated in this series of 250 patients are compared in terms of operative indication, surgical technique and treatment outcome. Some definitions are added for clarity.  Results:   It could be demonstrated that the final position of the AdVance sling is retroluminal, i.e. 5-10mm dorsal/behind the lumen of the membranous urethra (=sphincteric urethra). Comparing the first 20 to the last 20, there were no treatment failures in the latter. A two year follow-up showed a continence rate of 65% in the first group, compared to a 85% continence rate in the second group taking into account the short median follow- up of 4.1.months in the latter. Tunneling the sling subcutaneously decreased postoperative loosening significantly.  Conclusion:   The AdVance sling is a safe method of treating mild to moderate postprostatectomy incontinence, with no erosions in this series of patients. The hypothesis of sphincter laxity seems to play a definitive role in the pathophysiology of male incontinence. Correction of this urethral support descent or ""prolapse"" seems to be highly effective. Further studies are needed to accurately define the exaxt mechanism of action of the AdVance sling.""","""['Peter Rehder', 'Gabriele Freiin von Gleissenthall', 'Renate Pichler', 'Berhard Glodny']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['The artificial urinary sphincter and male sling for postprostatectomy incontinence: Which patient should get which procedure?', 'Treatment of postprostatectomy male urinary incontinence with the transobturator retroluminal repositioning sling suspension: 3-year follow-up.', 'AdVance/AdVance XP transobturator male slings: preoperative degree of incontinence as predictor of surgical outcome.', 'Surgery for postprostatectomy incontinence: which procedure for which patient?', 'The male suburethral sling: remaining questions.', 'Impact of obesity on male urethral sling outcomes.', 'Artificial Urinary Sphincter for Postradical Prostatectomy Urinary Incontinence - Is It the Best Option?', 'Contemporary surgical devices for male stress urinary incontinence: a review of technological advances in current continence surgery.', 'Hypothesis That Urethral Bulb (Corpus Spongiosum) Plays an Active Role in Male Urinary Continence.', 'The artificial urinary sphincter and male sling for postprostatectomy incontinence: Which patient should get which procedure?']"""

For these tumors, nerves may provide a conduit for local cancer progression into the central nervous system. Although neural invasion is associated with poor outcome, the mechanism that triggers it is unknown.  Methods:   We used an in vitro Matrigel dorsal root ganglion and pancreatic cancer cell coculture model to assess the dynamic interactions between nerves and cancer cell migration and the role of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). An in vivo murine sciatic nerve model was used to study how nerve invasion affects sciatic nerve function.  Results:   Nerves induced a polarized neurotrophic migration of cancer cells (PNMCs) along their axons, which was more efficient than in the absence of nerves (migration distance: mean = 187.1 microm, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 148 to 226 microm vs 14.4 microm, 95% CI = 9.58 to 19.22 microm, difference = 143 microm; P < .001; n = 20). PNMC was induced by secretion of GDNF, via phosphorylation of the RET-Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Nerves from mice deficient in GDNF had reduced ability to attract cancer cells (nerve invasion index: wild type vs gdnf+/-, mean = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.75 to 0.77 vs 0.43, 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.44; P < .001; n = 60-66). Tumor specimens excised from patients with neuroinvasive pancreatic carcinoma had higher expression of the GDNF receptors RET and GRFalpha1 as compared with normal tissue. Finally, systemic therapy with pyrazolopyrimidine-1, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the RET pathway, suppressed nerve invasion toward the spinal cord and prevented paralysis in mice.  Conclusion:   These data provide evidence for paracrine regulation of pancreatic cancer invasion by nerves, which may have important implications for potential therapy directed against nerve invasion by cancer.""","""['Ziv Gil', 'Oren Cavel', 'Kaitlyn Kelly', 'Peter Brader', 'Avigail Rein', 'Sizhi P Gao', 'Diane L Carlson', 'Jatin P Shah', 'Yuman Fong', 'Richard J Wong']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['GFRα1 released by nerves enhances cancer cell perineural invasion through GDNF-RET signaling.', 'The G691S RET polymorphism increases glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor-induced pancreatic cancer cell invasion by amplifying mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.', 'Endoneurial macrophages induce perineural invasion of pancreatic cancer cells by secretion of GDNF and activation of RET tyrosine kinase receptor.', 'Role of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in perineural invasion of pancreatic cancer.', 'Emerging experimental models for assessing perineural invasion in human cancers.', 'Inflammation induced by tumor-associated nerves promotes resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in cancer patients and is targetable by IL-6 blockade.', 'CD51 Intracellular Domain Promotes Cancer Cell Neurotropism through Interacting with Transcription Factor NR4A3 in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Rapid cancer cell perineural invasion utilizes amoeboid migration.', 'Neurogenesis manifestations of solid tumor and tracer imaging studies: a narrative review.', 'Important Cells and Factors from Tumor Microenvironment Participated in Perineural Invasion.']"""

Our understanding of the molecular events by which reactive stromal fibroblasts-myofibroblast or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF)-affect the growth and invasion of prostate cancer remains unclear. Laser capture microdissection and cDNA microarray analysis of CAFs in prostate tumors revealed strong upregulation of phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (PGK1), an ATP-generating glycolytic enzyme that forms part of the glycolytic pathway and is directly involved in CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling. Normal fibroblasts overexpressing PGK1 resembled myofibroblasts in their expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin, vimentin, and high levels of CXCL12. These cells also displayed a higher proliferative index and the capability to contribute to prostate tumor cell invasion in vitro, possibly through expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 and activation of the AKT and ERK pathways.

Although it had been thought that androgen-insensitive cancers no longer relied on the androgen receptor (AR) for growth and survival, it is now clear that this is not the case. Because relapses are known to occur by many mechanisms that keep the AR functionally active, strategies to block AR accumulation in the nucleus may be therapeutically useful. Here, we report the discovery of a selective nuclear androgen receptor exporter (SNARE) that functions to exclude AR from the nucleus. SNARE-1 binds wild-type and mutant ARs and efficiently inhibits their transactivation activity and ability to induce PSA gene expression. SNARE-1 inhibits the androgen-sensitive growth of LNCaP cells and tumor xenografts. Quantitative subcellular localization studies suggest that SNARE-1 inhibits nuclear translocation of AR, but also facilitates export of nuclear AR that has been translocated by an agonist. Mechanistic studies indicate that SNARE-1 rapidly phosphorylates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Ser(650) of the AR. Additionally, SNARE-1 was found to promote ubiquitination of AR in LNCaP cells. Lastly, SNARE-1 functions as a tissue-selective AR inhibitor, as it fails to phosphorylate p38 MAPK in U2OS bone cells that are stably transfected with AR. In summary, SNARE-1 inhibits AR function by a mechanism that is distinct from clinically available antiandrogens, such that it might inform novel methods to block AR function in androgen-independent prostate cancer.""","""['Ramesh Narayanan', 'Muralimohan Yepuru', 'Adam T Szafran', 'Maria Szwarc', 'Casey E Bohl', 'Natalie L Young', 'Duane D Miller', 'Michael A Mancini', 'James T Dalton']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Prosaposin upregulates AR and PSA expression and activity in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP).', 'Androgen receptor is targeted to distinct subcellular compartments in response to different therapeutic antiandrogens.', 'Molecular cell biology of androgen receptor signalling.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Development of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs).', 'Androgen receptor agonists increase lean mass, improve cardiopulmonary functions and extend survival in preclinical models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.', 'Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) negatively regulate triple-negative breast cancer growth and epithelial:mesenchymal stem cell signaling.', 'Discovery and preclinical characterization of novel small molecule TRK and ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and inflammation.', 'The role of intracrine androgen metabolism, androgen receptor and apoptosis in the survival and recurrence of prostate cancer during androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

Using a variety of cancer cell lines, we show that inhibition of Ets-1 blocks tumor formation and cell proliferation in vivo and autonomous growth in culture. A screen of multiple diffusible growth factors revealed that inhibition of Ets-1 results in the specific downregulation of transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha), the proximal promoter region of which contains multiple ETS family DNA binding sites that can be directly bound and regulated by Ets-1. Notably, rescuing TGFalpha expression in Ets-1-silenced cells was sufficient to restore tumor cell proliferation in vivo and autonomous growth in culture.

However, clinical responses have been limited and viral mutants with higher potency are needed. Here, we report on the generation of a novel set of mutants with improved efficacy in prostate and pancreatic carcinoma models. Currently, no curative treatments are available for late-stage metastatic prostate or rapidly progressing pancreatic cancers.  Experimental design:   Adenovirus type 5 mutants were created with deletions in the E1ACR2 region for tumor selectivity and/or the E1B19K gene for attenuated replication in vivo; all constructs retain the E3 genes intact. Cell-killing efficacy, replication, and cytotoxicity in combination with chemotherapeutics were investigated in normal cells (PrEC and NHBE), seven carcinoma cell lines, and human (PC3 and DU145) and murine (TRAMPC, CMT-64, and CMT-93) tumor models in vivo.  Results:   The double-deleted AdDeltaDelta (DeltaE1ACR2 and DeltaE1B19K) mutant had high cell-killing activity in prostate, pancreatic, and lung carcinomas. Replication was similar to wild-type in all tumor cells and was attenuated in normal cells to levels less than the single-deleted AdDeltaCR2 mutant. AdDeltaDelta combined with the chemotherapeutics docetaxel and mitoxantrone resulted in synergistically enhanced cell killing and greatly improved antitumor efficacy in prostate xenografts in vivo. In murine immunocompetent in vivo models efficacy was greater for mutants with the E3B genes intact even in the absence of viral replication, indicating attenuated macrophage-dependent clearance.

We sought to determine the dose of oral 6-(4-bromo-2-thienyl) methoxy purin-2-amine (lomeguatrib), a pseudosubstrate inactivator of MGMT, required to render active protein undetectable 12 hours after dosing in prostate, primary central nervous system (CNS), and colorectal cancer patients.  Experimental design:   Lomeguatrib was administered orally as a single dose (20-160 mg) approximately 12 hours before tumor resection. Dose escalation was projected to continue until grade 2 toxicity or until complete inactivation of tumor MGMT was encountered. Total MGMT protein levels were quantified by ELISA, and active protein levels were quantified by biochemical assay. MGMT promoter methylation was determined in glioblastoma DNA by methylation-specific PCR.  Results:   Thirty-seven patients were dosed with lomeguatrib, and 32 informative tumor samples were obtained. Mean total MGMT level varied between tumor types: 554 +/- 404 fmol/mg protein (+/-SD) for prostate cancer, 87.4 +/- 40.3 fmol/mg protein for CNS tumors, and 244 +/- 181 fmol/mg protein for colorectal cancer. MGMT promoter hypermethylation did not correlate with total protein expression. Consistent total MGMT inactivation required 120 mg of lomeguatrib in prostate and colorectal cancers. Complete consistent inactivation in CNS tumors was observed only at the highest dose of lomeguatrib (160 mg).  Conclusions:   Total MGMT inactivation can be achieved in prostate, primary CNS, and colorectal cancers with a single administration of 120 or 160 mg lomeguatrib.

Knockdown of sCLU in prostate cancer cells stabilizes COMMD1 and I-kappaB, thereby sequestrating NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and decreasing NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Comparative microarray profiling of sCLU-overexpressing and sCLU-knockdown prostate cancer cells confirmed that the expression of many NF-kappaB-regulated genes positively correlates with sCLU levels.

Objective:   To report our analysis of the oncological outcome, side-effects and complications after (125)I-brachytherapy, based on 10 years of experience, as low dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy is an accepted, effective and safe therapy for localized prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Between April 1999 and December 2006, 734 consecutive patients were treated with clinically localized prostate cancer with a follow-up of >or=30 months. No patients received external beam radiotherapy and 43% received hormonal therapy before brachytherapy; this therapy was given for 3-4 months. All patients had LDR prostate brachytherapy administered by one radiation oncologist. Biochemical failure was defined according to the 'Phoenix consensus'.  Results:   The median follow-up for the 734 patients was 55 months; 26 had a clinical relapse and 11 died from prostate cancer; 20 patients died from other illnesses. The 10-year actuarial biochemical control was 92%, 84% and 65%, respectively (P < 0.001) for the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups. Multivariate Cox regression analyses identified Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level as independent prognostic factors for biochemical failure. The actuarial biochemical control with Gleason score was 88%, 76% and 67% for patients with a Gleason score of <or=6, 7 and >7, respectively (P < 0.001). The biochemical control was 90%, 80% and 42% for patients with a PSA level of <or=10, 10.1-20 and >20 ng/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). No patients reported incontinence after treatment. There was acute urinary retention in 22 (2.9%) patients. Logistic regression showed that the most significant factors correlating with the probability of catheterization were the pretreatment prostate volume and hormonal therapy.

Objective:   To determine whether there might be differences in bone mineral content (BMC) between men who develop life-threatening prostate cancer and those who do not, as bone is a common site of prostate cancer metastases.  Subjects and methods:   From 1973 to 1984, BMC was serially measured in 519 participants (778 observations) as part of a longitudinal study of ageing. We examined the association between serial BMC measurements with the development of overall and high-risk prostate cancer over the next one to three decades. For all prostate cancer cases, BMC was censored at the time of diagnosis.  Results:   During a median (range) overall follow-up of 21.1 (0.2-35.0) years after the last BMC measurement, 76 (14.6%) men were later diagnosed with prostate cancer (18 high-risk and 58 not high-risk). BMC declined with age to a greater extent in healthy controls than among men diagnosed with prostate cancer (P = 0.018, likelihood ratio test), and tended to decline less in high-risk than non-high-risk cases.  Conclusion:   The distribution of BMC was significantly different between men who did and did not develop prostate cancer, over an extended follow-up. Specifically, BMC appeared to decline to a greater extent with age among healthy controls than in men with prostate cancer, especially high-risk disease. The biology underlying the lesser decline in BMC among men with prostate cancer remains unclear, but suggests that host factors in the bony milieu might be associated with prostate cancer development and progression.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Shari M Ling', 'Anna Kettermann', 'Luigi Ferrucci', 'E Jeffrey Metter']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Serum testosterone is associated with aggressive prostate cancer in older men: results from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.', 'Low levels of prostate-specific antigen predict long-term risk of prostate cancer: results from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.', 'Association of energy intake with prostate cancer in a long-term aging study: Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (United States).', 'Understanding treatments for bone loss and bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer: a practical review and guide for the clinician.', 'Osteoporosis in men with prostate carcinoma receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: recommendations for diagnosis and therapies.']"""

Ligation of the DVC during RALP with an endovascular stapler has purported advantages of decreased apical positive surgical margin (PSM) rate, blood loss, and operative time when compared with suture ligation.  Patients and methods:   In all, 162 patients who underwent RALP between October 2005 and April 2008 by one surgeon (R.B.N.) were assessed. We retrospectively analysed two different treatment groups: group 1 underwent DVC ligation with a single suture, while group 2 underwent endovascular staple ligation.  Results:   Of the 162 patients evaluated, 67 had suture ligation (group 1) and 95 had staple ligation (group 2) of the DVC. Baseline patient characteristics (age, body mass index, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage) and tumour characteristics (specimen weight, tumour volume, pathological Gleason score and stage) did not differ between the groups. Estimated blood loss (494 mL vs 288 mL), time to dissect out, ligate and transect the DVC (30 min vs 24 min), apical PSM rate (13.4% vs 2.1%) differed significantly between groups 1 and 2 respectively, favouring staple ligation of the DVC.

Patients and methods:   From February 2006 to December 2008, 502 patients had retropubic RP (RRP) while concurrently 212 had robot-assisted laparoscopic RP (RALP) by one urologist. We prospectively compared the baseline patient and tumour characteristics, variables during and after RP, histopathological features and early urinary functional outcomes in the two groups.  Results:   The patients in both groups were similar in age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, and prostatic volume. However, there were more high-stage (T2b and T3, P = 0.02) and -grade (Gleason 9, P = 0.01) tumours in the RRP group. The mean (range) operative duration was 147 (75-330) min for RRP and 192 (119-525) min for RALP (P < 0.001); 110 cases were required to achieve '3-h proficiency'. Major complication rates were 1.8% and 0.8% for RALP and RRP, respectively. The overall positive surgical margin (PSM) rate was 21.2% in the RALP and 16.7% in the RRP group (P = 0.18). PSM rates for pT2 were comparable (11.6% vs 10.1%, P = 0.74). pT3 PSM rates were higher for RALP than RRP (40.5% vs 28.8%, P = 0.004). The learning curve started to plateau in the overall PSM rate after 150 cases. For the pT2 and pT3 PSM rates, the learning curve tended to flatten after 140 and 170 cases, respectively. The early continence rates were comparable (P = 0.07) but showed a statistically significant improvement after 200 cases.

Although controversial, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is widely used for screening and follow-up of prostate cancer, but because of its limited specificity and sensitivity, PSA is not an ideal test. We currently lack the necessary tools to differentiate between latent disease with little likelihood of clinical manifestation and aggressive tumours that are likely to metastasize and lead to potentially lethal disease. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation and plays essential roles in tumour initiation and progression. Currently, aberrant promoter hypermethylation has been investigated in specific genes from the following groups: tumour-suppressor genes, proto-oncogenes, genes involved in cell adhesion, and genes involved in cell-cycle regulation. Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) has been shown to be a biomarker for prostate cancer. Other genes, e.g. CD44, PTGS2, E-cadherin, CDH13, and cyclin D2 have been found to be prognostic markers for prostate cancer. In cell samples derived from the urine, the presence of the hypermethylation of either GSTP1 or RASS1a has been shown to be both sensitive and specific for detecting prostate cancer. Several studies have found that analysis of hypermethylation using a panel of tumour-suppressor genes yielded better results for detecting prostate cancer than the analysis of single-gene methylation. Hence, these different panels (e.g. GSTP1, APC, PTGS2, T1G1 and EDNRB) are of interest for detecting prostate cancer. Also, the methylation profile of multiple regulatory genes might be altered at the time of cancer relapse. Thus, preliminary results on the use of the methylation status of specific genes as potential tumour biomarkers for the early diagnosis and the risk stratification of patients with prostate cancer are promising.""","""['Veronique Phé', 'Olivier Cussenot', 'Morgan Rouprêt']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Interest of methylated genes as biomarkers in urothelial cell carcinomas of the urinary tract.', 'Promoter hypermethylation as an independent prognostic factor for relapse in patients with prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic information in prostate cancer with the help of a small set of hypermethylated gene loci.', 'The emerging roles of DNA methylation in the clinical management of prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative serum DNA GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation and the risk of early prostate-specific antigen recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Screening a novel six critical gene-based system of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in prostate adenocarcinoma patients with different clinical variables.', 'Identification of Pyroptosis-Related Gene Signatures and Construction of the Risk Model to Predict BCR in Prostate Cancer.', 'Screening key miRNAs and genes in prostate cancer by microarray analysis.', 'Alnus sibirica Compounds Exhibiting Anti-Proliferative, Apoptosis-Inducing, and GSTP1 Demethylating Effects on Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Methylation Analysis of P16, RASSF1A, RPRM, and RUNX3 in Circulating Cell-Free DNA for Detection of Gastric Cancer: A Validation Study.']"""

Runx2 is an essential transcription factor for bone formation and suppresses cell growth in normal osteoblasts but may function as an oncogenic factor in solid tumors (e.g., breast, prostate). Here, we addressed whether Runx2 is linked to steroid hormone and growth factor signaling, which controls prostate cancer cell growth. Protein expression profiling of prostate cell lines (i.e., PC3, LNCaP, RWPE) treated with 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or tumor growth factor beta (TGFbeta) revealed modulations in selected cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK inhibitors that are generally consistent with mitogenic responses. Endogenous elevation of Runx2 and diminished p57 protein levels in PC3 cells are associated with faster proliferation in vitro and development of larger tumors upon xenografting these cells in bone in vivo. To examine whether TGFbeta or DHT signaling modulates the transcriptional activity of Runx2 and vice versa, we performed luciferase reporter assays. In PC3 cells that express TGFbetaRII, TGFbeta and Runx2 synergize to increase transcription of synthetic promoters. In LNCaP cells that are DHT responsive, Runx2 stimulates the androgen receptor (AR) responsive expression of the prostate-specific marker PSA, perhaps facilitated by formation of a complex with AR. Our data suggest that Runx2 is mechanistically linked to TGFbeta and androgen responsive pathways that support prostate cancer cell growth.""","""['Margaretha van der Deen', 'Jacqueline Akech', 'Tao Wang', 'Thomas J FitzGerald', 'Dario C Altieri', 'Lucia R Languino', 'Jane B Lian', 'Andre J van Wijnen', 'Janet L Stein', 'Gary S Stein']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['TGF-beta signaling and androgen receptor status determine apoptotic cross-talk in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor and TGFbeta1/Smad signaling are mutually inhibitory in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen up-regulates epidermal growth factor receptor expression and binding affinity in PC3 cell lines expressing the human androgen receptor.', 'Attenuation of androgenic regulation by brefeldin A in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells.', 'Glutaminolysis is a metabolic route essential for survival and growth of prostate cancer cells and a target of 5α-dihydrotestosterone regulation.', 'The androgen receptor inhibits transcription of GPER1 by preventing Sp1 and Sp3 from binding to the promoters in prostate cancer cells.', 'Role of Runx2 in prostate development and stem cell function.', 'Identification of sequence-specific interactions of the CD44-intracellular domain with RUNX2 in the transcription of matrix metalloprotease-9 in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular profiling stratifies diverse phenotypes of treatment-refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of CD44 intracellular domain interaction with RUNX2 in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.']"""

QoL was assessed using the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and the prostate module PR25. Changes in mean QoL scores with time of >or= 10 points were considered clinically relevant.  Results:   Global QoL did not change statistically significant during CRT and was slightly above baseline levels during follow-up. CRT had a statistically significant negative short-term impact on role functioning, fatigue, and PR25 urinary symptoms. The scores recovered within 2 months to 1 year after CRT. Emotional functioning and social functioning scores slightly increased during and after CRT. Role functioning decreased by > 10 points at 60 Gy and urinary symptoms decreased by > 10 points at 40 and 60 Gy. All other differences were < 10 points. A high number of concomitant diseases and having no children were negative pretreatment predictors for long-term global QoL.

Methods:   Eligibility criteria included hormone refractory prostate cancer with a rising PSA at least 6 weeks after peripheral anti-androgen withdrawal, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1, and no prior chemotherapy. Fenretinide was administered orally at 900 mg m(-2) twice daily for 7 of every 21 days. PSA was measured before each cycle.

Methods:   Thirteen patients underwent dynamic (18)F-FDHT PET over a selected tumor. Concurrent venous blood samples were acquired for blood metabolite analysis. A second cohort of 25 patients injected with (18)F-FDHT underwent dynamic PET of the heart. These data were used to generate a population-based input function, essential for pharmacokinetic modeling. Linear compartmental pharmacokinetic models of increasing complexity were tested on the tumor tissue data. Four suitable models were applied and compared using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Model 1 consisted of an instantaneously equilibrating space, followed by a unidirectional trap. Models 2a and 2b contained a reversible space between the instantaneously equilibrating space and the trap, into which metabolites were excluded (2a) or allowed (2b). Model 3 built on model 2b with the addition of a second reversible space preceding the unidirectional trap and from which metabolites were excluded.  Results:   The half-life of the (18)F-FDHT in blood was between 6 and 7 min. As a consequence, the uptake of (18)F-FDHT in prostate cancer lesions reached a plateau within 20 min as the blood-borne activity was consumed. Radiolabeled metabolites were shown not to bind to ARs in in vitro studies with CWR22 cells. Model 1 produced reasonable and robust fits for all datasets and was judged best by the BIC for 16 of 26 tumor scans. Models 2a, 2b, and 3 were judged best in 7, 2, and 1 cases, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our study explores the clinical potential of using (18)F-FDHT PET to estimate free AR concentration. This process involved the estimation of a net uptake parameter such as the k(trap) of model 1 that could serve as a surrogate measure of AR expression in metastatic prostate cancer. Our initial studies suggest that a simple body mass-normalized standardized uptake value correlates reasonably well to model-based k(trap) estimates, which we surmise may be proportional to AR expression.

All these tumor cells displayed marked resistance to death caused by apoptotic stimuli like arachidonic acid and the BH3 mimetic EM20-25, which cause cell death through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). PTP desensitization and the ensuing resistance to cell death induced by arachidonic acid or EM20-25 could be ablated by inhibiting ERK with the drug PD98059 or with a selective ERK activation inhibitor peptide. ERK inhibition enhanced glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)-dependent phosphorylation of the pore regulator cyclophilin D, whereas GSK-3 inhibition protected from PTP opening. Neither active ERK in mitochondria nor pore desensitization was observed in non-transformed RWPE-1 cells.

Using a human prostate xenograft-mouse model, we observed that knocking down endogenous DAB2IP in human carcinoma cells led to the development of multiple lymph node and distant organ metastases. Moreover, we showed that DAB2IP functions as a scaffold protein in regulating EMT by modulating nuclear beta-catenin/T-cell factor activity.

Identification of factors specifically associated with risk for more aggressive PCa is urgently needed to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment of this common disease. To search for such factors, we compared the frequencies of SNPs among PCa patients who were defined as having either more aggressive or less aggressive disease in four populations examined in the Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) study performed by the National Cancer Institute. SNPs showing possible associations with disease severity were further evaluated in an additional three independent study populations from the United States and Sweden. In total, we studied 4,829 and 12,205 patients with more and less aggressive disease, respectively. We found that the frequency of the TT genotype of SNP rs4054823 at 17p12 was consistently higher among patients with more aggressive compared with less aggressive disease in each of the seven populations studied, with an overall P value of 2.1 x 10(-8) under a recessive model, exceeding the conservative genome-wide significance level. The difference in frequency was largest between patients with high-grade, non-organ-confined disease compared with those with low-grade, organ-confined disease.

Methods:   Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses were performed in 10 samples of normal prostates, 35 samples of BPH, 27 samples diagnosis of PIN (with low-grade PIN or high-grade PIN) and 95 samples of PC (with low, medium or high Gleason grades).  Results:   In NP, cytoplasm of epithelial cells were positive to c-IAP1/2 (80% of samples), c-IAP-2 (60%), ILP (20%), XIAP (20%); negative to NAIP and survivin. In BPH, epithelial cells were immunostained to c-IAP1/2 (57.57%), c-IAP-2 (57.57%), ILP (66.6%), NAIP (60.6%), XIAP (27.27%), survivin (9.1%).

In PC, epithelial cells were immunostained to c-IAP1/2, c-IAP-2, ILP, NAIP, XIAP (no Gleason variation) and survivin (increasing with Gleason).  Conclusions:   IAPs could be involved in prostate disorder (BPH, PIN and PC) development since might be provoke inhibition of apoptosis and subsequently cell proliferation. At the same time, different transduction pathway such as IL-1/NIK/NF-kB or TNF/NF-kB (NIK or p38) also promotes proliferation.

We aimed to assess whether certain preoperative clinical and pathologic characteristics correlate with pathologic outcome in high-risk prostate cancer patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP).  Methods:   A retrospective evaluation of patients with high-risk disease (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] >or=10 ng/dL with high volume disease or Gleason score >or=8) who underwent RALP between December 2004 and September 2008 was conducted. Patients were grouped based on favorable pathology, including organ-confined disease and negative surgical margins (group 1), and unfavorable pathology, including positive surgical margins and extracapsular extension (group 2). Preoperative PSA levels, transrectal ultrasonography findings, and biopsy reports were compared to final pathology data.  Results:   Of 69 high-risk patients, 37 (54%) had favorable postoperative pathology (group 1) and 32 (46%) had unfavorable pathology (group 2).

We sought to assess whether robot assistance would decrease the technical challenges and mitigate the considerable morbidity associated with the procedure.  Patients and methods:   Using institutional data, we identified six patients who underwent robot-assisted prostatectomy after definitive radiation therapy. For all patients, preoperative and postoperative quality of life were measured using the Sexual Health Inventory for Men and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). Further, intraoperative and postoperative complications were assessed.  Results:   Functional status of patients before robot-assisted salvage prostatectomy is compromised. Three of the six patients had extremely poor sexual function before surgery (EPIC sexual domain <50), and three-quarters had significant irritative symptoms (mean EPIC urinary irritation score 60.5). Surgery was performed safely with no intraoperative complications. Postoperative complications developed in three patients, all of whom were managed conservatively. Of the six patients, four (75%) remain free of disease; however, incontinence and erectile dysfunction were evident in all, to some degree.

We conducted a systematic meta-analysis of these studies to examine both the strength and the consistency of the association, and to explore sources of variability between studies. We searched 12 computerized literature databases for reports published before June 2008 and included any epidemiologic studies where the outcome was prostate cancer incidence or mortality, and the exposure was use of NSAIDs. Studies that met the inclusion criteria comprised 10 case-control and 14 cohort studies with a total of 24,230 prostate cancer cases. Studies that assessed the effect of aspirin use on total prostate cancer had a pooled odds ratio (POR) of 0.83 (95%CI: 0.77-0.89), whereas those that assessed the effect of aspirin on advanced prostate cancer had a POR of 0.81 (0.72-0.92). Studies that examined the effects of non-aspirin NSAIDs or all NSAIDs were less consistent but still suggestive of reduced risks. However, most reviewed studies were limited by exposure and disease misclassification, by inadequate information on dose and duration of use and by the possibility of screening and other biases. In conclusion, the epidemiologic evidence for a protective effect of aspirin and other NSAID use against prostate cancer is suggestive but not conclusive.

Patients with prostate, ovary, and skin cancer may develop auto-antibodies to the alpha(2)M* binding site which are receptor agonists whose presence indicates a poor prognosis. By contrast, antibodies directed against the COOH-terminal domain of GPR78 (anti-CTD antibody), are antagonists which down regulate pro-proliferative signaling and upregulate p53. Unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling plays an important role in cell survival and proliferation as well as apoptosis. We, therefore, studied the effect of anti-CTD antibody on UPR signaling in 1-LN and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Treatment of these cells, which express GRP78 on their cell surface, with this antibody significantly downregulated IRE1-alpha, PERK, and ATF6alpha-dependent UPR signaling. By contrast, the pro-apoptotic protein GADD153 was elevated. Anti-CTD antibody treatment also elevated apoptotic components, cleaved PARP-1, and Erdj5.

Results:   An elderly, male with a BMI of 32.49, clinically diagnosed as a case of giant BPH (prior negative prostate biopsy) with vesical stones and severe LUTS, was successfully managed by modified robot assisted laparoscopic technique of prostatectomy with removal of bladder stones.

However, results from recent prospective studies have been inconclusive. METHODOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the association between prostatitis, STDs, and prostate cancer among African American, Asian American, Latino, and White participants of the California Men's Health Study. Our analysis included 68,675 men, who completed a detailed baseline questionnaire in 2002-2003. We identified 1,658 incident prostate cancer cases during the follow-up period to June 30, 2006. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Overall, men having a history of prostatitis had an increased risk of prostate cancer than men with no history (RR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10-1.54). Longer duration of prostatitis symptoms was also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (P trend = 0.003). In addition, among men screened for prostate cancer (1 or 2 PSA tests), a non-significant positive association was observed between prostatitis and prostate cancer (RR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.75-1.63). STDs were not associated with overall prostate cancer risk. In racial/ethnic stratified analysis, Latinos reporting any STDs had an increased risk of disease than those with no STDs (RR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Interestingly, foreign-born Latinos displayed a larger risk associated with STDs (RR = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.16-3.02) than U.S. born Latinos (RR = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.76-3.02).  Conclusion:   In summary, results from this prospective study suggest that prostatitis and STDs may be involved in prostate cancer susceptibility.

Recently, several studies have tackled this challenge via a network-based approach, motivated by the observation that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend to lie close to one another in a network of protein-protein or functional interactions. However, most of these approaches use only local network information in the inference process and are restricted to inferring single gene associations. Here, we provide a global, network-based method for prioritizing disease genes and inferring protein complex associations, which we call PRINCE. The method is based on formulating constraints on the prioritization function that relate to its smoothness over the network and usage of prior information. We exploit this function to predict not only genes but also protein complex associations with a disease of interest. We test our method on gene-disease association data, evaluating both the prioritization achieved and the protein complexes inferred. We show that our method outperforms extant approaches in both tasks. Using data on 1,369 diseases from the OMIM knowledgebase, our method is able (in a cross validation setting) to rank the true causal gene first for 34% of the diseases, and infer 139 disease-related complexes that are highly coherent in terms of the function, expression and conservation of their member proteins. Importantly, we apply our method to study three multi-factorial diseases for which some causal genes have been found already: prostate cancer, alzheimer and type 2 diabetes mellitus. PRINCE's predictions for these diseases highly match the known literature, suggesting several novel causal genes and protein complexes for further investigation.""","""['Oron Vanunu', 'Oded Magger', 'Eytan Ruppin', 'Tomer Shlomi', 'Roded Sharan']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['A random set scoring model for prioritization of disease candidate genes using protein complexes and data-mining of GeneRIF, OMIM and PubMed records.', 'Prioritization of candidate disease genes by topological similarity between disease and protein diffusion profiles.', 'A computational method based on the integration of heterogeneous networks for predicting disease-gene associations.', 'The power of protein interaction networks for associating genes with diseases.', 'Network propagation: a universal amplifier of genetic associations.', 'Developing a label propagation approach for cancer subtype classification problem.', 'Network embedding framework for driver gene discovery by combining functional and structural information.', 'Predicting Drug-Gene-Disease Associations by Tensor Decomposition for Network-Based Computational Drug Repositioning.', 'AMEND: active module identification using experimental data and network diffusion.', 'A human proteogenomic-cellular framework identifies KIF5A as a modulator of astrocyte process integrity with relevance to ALS.']"""

While the sensitivity and specificity of this technique is high, we propose a probabilistic approach to deal with the intrinsic imaging uncertainty.  Material and methods:   Twenty-nine patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent a DCE-CT exam prior to radiotherapy. From a logistic regression on K(trans) values from healthy and diseased appearing prostate regions we obtained a probability function for the presence of tumor. K(trans) parameter maps were converted into probability maps and a stratification was applied at the 5% and 95% probability level, to identify low-, intermediate-, and high-risk areas for the presence of tumor.  Results:   In all patients, regions with high-, intermediate-, and low-risk were identified, with median volume percentages of 7.6%, 40.0%, and 52.1%, respectively. The contiguous areas that resulted from the voxel wise stratification can be interpreted as GTV, high-risk CTV, and CTV.  Conclusions:   K(trans) parameter maps from a DCE-CT exam can be converted into probability maps for the presence of tumor. In this way, the intrinsic uncertainty that a voxel contains tumor can be incorporated into the treatment planning process.""","""['Johannes G Korporaal', 'Cornelis A T van den Berg', 'Greetje Groenendaal', 'Maaike R Moman', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Uulke A van der Heide']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT for prostate cancer: relationship between image noise, voxel size, and repeatability.', 'Multiparametric MRI Tumor Probability Model for the Detection of Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy: Pathologic Validation and Comparison With Manual Tumor Delineations.', 'Tracer kinetic model selection for dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Focal therapy for prostate cancer: the technical challenges.', 'Coverage-based treatment planning to accommodate delineation uncertainties in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Functional imaging for radiotherapy treatment planning: current status and future directions-a review.', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound as support for prostate brachytherapy treatment planning.']"""

The technique has been associated with significant morbidity in a small proportion of patients.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a population based study of 75,190 men who underwent a transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in Ontario, Canada, between 1996 and 2005. We used hospital and cancer registry administrative databases to estimate the rates of hospital admission and mortality due to urological complications associated with the procedure.  Results:   Of the 75,190 men who underwent transrectal ultrasound biopsy 33,508 (44.6%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 41,682 (55.4%) did not have prostate cancer. The hospital admission rate for urological complications within 30 days of the procedure for men without cancer was 1.9% (781/41,482). The 30-day hospital admission rate increased from 1.0% in 1996 to 4.1% in 2005 (p for trend <0.0001). The majority of hospital admissions (72%) were for infection related reasons. The probability of being admitted to hospital within 30 days of having the procedure increased 4-fold between 1996 and 2005 (OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.0-7.0, p <0.0001). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.09% but did not change during the study period.

Materials and methods:   Data on 3,057 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1988 and 2008 was retrieved from our institutional prostate cancer database. Patients with data on tumor percent involvement, prostate volume and prostate specific antigen recurrence were included in analysis. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on prostate volume less than 35, 35 to 45 and greater than 45 cc. The variables tumor percent involvement, age at surgery, race, prostate specific antigen, pathological Gleason score, positive surgical margins, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion and surgery year were analyzed using the chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests to determine individual effects on prostate specific antigen recurrence. Tumor percent involvement and prostate specific antigen were evaluated as continuous variables. Significant variables on univariate analysis were included in multivariate Cox regression analysis to compare their effects on prostate specific antigen recurrence.  Results:   Tumor percent involvement significantly predicted prostate specific antigen recurrence in men with a small prostate (p = 0.006) but not in those with a prostate of greater than 35 cc. Black race was a marginally significant predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence in men with a medium prostate (p = 0.055). Age at surgery was a predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence in men with a larger prostate (p = 0.003). Prostate specific antigen, positive surgical margins, seminal vesicle invasion and pathological Gleason score 7 or greater predicted prostate specific antigen recurrence in men with all prostate sizes.

Repeat prostate specific antigen measurements after a period of observation or a course of empirical antibiotics are controversial in terms of the optimal approach to reduce the confounding impact on prostate cancer screening. This issue was analyzed in patients with a diagnosis of type IV or asymptomatic prostatitis (National Institutes of Health classification) and high prostate specific antigen.  Materials and methods:   We studied 200 men between 50 and 75 years old with a high prostate specific antigen (between 2.5 and 10 ng/dl).

In a prospective, double-blind trial they were randomized to receive placebo (49 patients, group 1) or 500 mg ciprofloxacin (49 patients, group 2) twice a day for 4 weeks. Prostate specific antigen was determined after treatment and all patients underwent transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate.  Results:   In group 1, 29 (59.18%) patients presented with a decrease in prostate specific antigen and 9 (31%) had cancer on biopsy, while in group 2 there were 26 (53.06%) patients with a decrease in prostate specific antigen and 7 (26.9%) with prostate cancer.

Under these conditions, neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of CaP cells occurs and neuropeptides released by neuroendocrine cells facilitate tumour progression. Pharmacological strategies aiming to prevent or delay NED during androgen ablation could, therefore, increase the effectiveness of the therapy. Mechanisms and pathways inducing NED in CaP are poorly understood and data are often discordant. In the present study, we used several CaP cell lines (androgen-responsive: LNCaP, PC3-AR, 22RV1 and -irresponsive: DU145 and PC3) to evaluate NED after androgen deprivation or treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). NED was determined by neuron-specific enolase and chromogranin A expression and by the occurrence of morphological changes in the cells. Androgen-deprivation conditions induced NED in LNCaP and PC3-AR, but not in 22Rv1, PC3 and DU145 cells. LNCaP and PC3-AR cells also became resistant to thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. In all the AR-positive cell lines, androgen deprivation caused a decrease in androgen receptor expression indicating that it is downregulated irrespective of NED induction. Treatment with EGF induced NED in DU145 cells and the EGF receptor inhibitor gefinitib prevented the process. On the contrary, no effect of EGF was demonstrated in LNCaP or 22Rv1 cells. CaP cell lines did not respond univocally to treatments inducing NED, suggesting that studies on this topic should be performed in a wide spectrum of cell models which can be more indicative of the tumour variability in vivo.""","""['S Marchiani', 'L Tamburrino', 'G Nesi', 'M Paglierani', 'S Gelmini', 'C Orlando', 'M Maggi', 'G Forti', 'E Baldi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Androl""","""['Epidermal growth factor-induced neuroendocrine differentiation and apoptotic resistance of androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation is involved in chemoresistance induced by EGF in prostate cancer cells.', 'Elevated circulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) levels are associated with neuroendocrine differentiation in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor and vitamin D agonist are involved in suppressing invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells.', 'Neuroendocrine pathogenesis in adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', '18F-DCFPyL (PSMA) PET as a radiotherapy response assessment tool in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer cells demonstrate unique metabolism and substrate adaptability acutely after androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Activity of New Synthetic (2-Chloroethylthio)-1,4-naphthoquinones in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Interplay of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 in Prostate Cancer: Beyond Androgen Receptor Transactivation.', 'Sodium bicarbonate transporter NBCe1 regulates proliferation and viability of human prostate cancer cells LNCaP and PC3.']"""

At that point, there are few treatment options available. Significant efforts have been made to identify biomarkers that will identify these more aggressive cancers to tailor a more vigorous treatment in order to improve outcome. Polycomb Group protein enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2) was found to be overexpressed in metastatic prostate tumors, and is considered an excellent candidate for such a biomarker. Scattered studies have found that EZH2 overexpression causes neoplastic transformation, invasion, and growth of prostate cells. However, these studies utilized different systems and cell lines, and so are difficult to correlate with one another.  Methods:   In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of the phenotypic effects of EZH2 in a panel of five prostate cancer cell lines was performed. By using multiple cell lines, and examining overexpression and knockdown of EZH2 concurrently, a broad view of EZH2's role in prostate cancer was achieved.  Results:   Overexpression of EZH2 led to more aggressive behaviors in all prostate cell lines tested. In contrast, downregulation of EZH2 reduced invasion and tumorigenicity of androgen-independent (AI) cell lines CWR22Rv1, PC3, and DU145, but not of androgen-dependent (AD) cell lines LAPC4 and LNCaP.  Conclusions:   Findings from this study suggest that AI prostate tumors are more dependent on EZH2 expression than AD tumors.

This study was undertaken to assess the prognostic role of tissue chromogranin A (CgA) expression in patients addressed to ADT as opposed to those who did not.  Methods:   Four hundred fourteen newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients, consecutively recruited in a single institution, entered the study. Two hundred fourteen patients received ADT early after diagnosis, 200 did not. Median follow-up was 85 months. CgA expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in prostate cancer needle biopsies.  Results:   In multivariate analysis after adjusting for Gleason score, serum PSA, disease stage and local treatments, tissue CgA expression in overall cases was significantly associated with a shorter survival (P = 0.009) but failed to be associated with PSA progression (P = 0.10). Dividing patients according to whether they received immediate ADT or not, tissue CgA was associated with a shorter time to PSA progression in ADT-treated patients (hazard ratios (HR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37-2.81, P = 0.0001), but failed to be associated in those who did not (HR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.58-1.30, P = 0.49), interaction test P = 0.007.

However, the reviewed studies were subject to methodological constraints that would obscure any potential relationship between prostate cancer and androgenic hormones. If prostate cancer risk is mediated by lifetime exposure to testosterone, then case-control studies that concentrate on endogenous sex hormones near the ages that prostate cancer is diagnosed would provide limited information on cumulative testosterone exposure across the lifespan. Alternately, early adulthood has been suggested as the most salient period to evaluate the influence of steroid physiology on prostate carcinogenesis. As such, an exhaustive literature search was completed to obtain testosterone values reported for study samples of younger men, along with prostate cancer incidences for the larger populations from which the study populations were sampled. A novel analytical method was developed to standardize, organize, and examine 12 studies reporting testosterone levels for 28 population samples.

Random bladder biopsies showed no malignancy, but a second TUR-P revealed urothelial carcinoma in the prostate and bladder neck. Computed tomography (CT) showed lymph node metastases from para-aortic to right/left external iliac and left obturator nodes, so clinical stage T3N2M0 carcinoma of the prostatic urethra was diagnosed. Given the presence of lymph node metastases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy using cisplatin 70 mg/m(2), ifosfamide 1.2 g/m(2) and docetaxel 70 mg/m(2) (PIT) was considered. After chemotherapy, CT showed complete response (CR) of all lymph nodes. Local control in the bladder was considered to be good, so total prostatectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was selected instead of total cystoprostatectomy.

The roles of stathmin1 in carcinogenesis of various cancers, including prostate and breast cancer, have been explored. However, its expression and roles in gastric cancer have not yet been described.  Methods:   Stathmin1 expression in paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 226 patients was analysed by immunohistochemistry. Roles of stathmin1 were studied using a specific small interfering RNA (siRNA).  Results:   The expression of stathmin1 was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis, TNM stages and vascular invasion, and negatively with recurrence-free survival, in the diffuse type of gastric cancer. The median recurrence-free survival in patients with a negative and positive expression of stathmin1 was 17.0 and 7.0 months, respectively (P=0.009). When the expression of stathmin1 was knocked down using siRNA, the proliferation, migration and invasion of poorly differentiated gastric cancer cells in vitro were significantly inhibited.

Methods:   In this study we used a specific antagonist of VEGF binding to the NRP1 b1 domain, EG3287, to investigate the functional roles of NRP1 in human carcinoma cell lines, non-small-cell lung A549, kidney ACHN, and prostate DU145 cells expressing NRP1, and the underlying mechanisms involved.  Results:   EG3287 potently displaced the specific binding of VEGF to NRP1 in carcinoma cell lines and significantly inhibited the migration of A549 and ACHN cells. Neuropilin-1 downregulation by siRNA also decreased cell migration. EG3287 reduced the adhesion of A549 and ACHN cells to extracellular matrix (ECM), and enhanced the anti-adhesive effects of a beta1-integrin function-blocking antibody. EG3287 increased the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agents 5-FU, paclitaxel, or cisplatin on A549 and DU145 cells, through inhibition of integrin-dependent cell interaction with the ECM.  Conclusions:   These findings indicate that NRP1 is important for tumour cell migration and adhesion, and that NRP1 antagonism enhances chemosensitivity, at least in part, by interfering with integrin-dependent survival pathways. A major implication of this study is that therapeutic strategies targeting NRP1 in tumour cells may be particularly useful in combination with other drugs for combating tumour survival, growth, and metastatic spread independently of an antiangiogenic effect of blocking NRP1.""","""['H Jia', 'L Cheng', 'M Tickner', 'A Bagherzadeh', 'D Selwood', 'I Zachary']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Small molecule inhibitors of the neuropilin-1 vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) interaction.', 'Characterization of a bicyclic peptide neuropilin-1 (NP-1) antagonist (EG3287) reveals importance of vascular endothelial growth factor exon 8 for NP-1 binding and role of NP-1 in KDR signaling.', 'VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) Induces NRP1 (Neuropilin-1) Cleavage via ADAMs (a Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) 9 and 10 to Generate Novel Carboxy-Terminal NRP1 Fragments That Regulate Angiogenic Signaling.', 'Neuropilin 1: function and therapeutic potential in cancer.', 'The interaction of Neuropilin-1 and Neuropilin-2 with tyrosine-kinase receptors for VEGF.', 'Neuropilin-1 promotes mitochondrial structural repair and functional recovery in rats with cerebral ischemia.', 'HNF4G accelerates glioma progression by facilitating NRP1 transcription.', 'PSMB5 overexpression is correlated with tumor proliferation and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'GATA3 Exerts Distinct Transcriptional Functions to Regulate Radiation Resistance in A549 and H1299 Cells.', 'Immune inactivation by neuropilin-1 predicts clinical outcome and therapeutic benefit in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.']"""

Steroidogenic enzyme mRNAs were quantified in hormonally manipulated human PC cell lines and xenografts as well as in human samples of normal prostate, locally confined and advanced PC, local nonmetastatic CRPC, and lymph node metastases. Overall, the majority of samples showed low or absent mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes required for de novo steroid synthesis. Simultaneous but low expression of the enzymes CYP17A1 and HSD3B1, essential for the synthesis of androgens from pregnenolone, could be detected in 19 of 88 patient samples. Of 19 CRPC tissues examined, only 5 samples expressed both enzymes. Enzymes that convert androstenedione to testosterone (AKR1C3) and testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT; SRD5A1) were abundantly expressed. AKR1C3 expression was negatively regulated by androgens in the experimental models and was increased in CRPC samples. Expression of SRD5A1 was upregulated in locally advanced cancer, CRPC, and lymph node metastases. We concluded that intratumoral steroid biosynthesis contributes less than circulating adrenal androgens, implying that blocking androgen production and its intraprostatic conversion into DHT, such as via CYP17A1 inhibition, may represent favorable therapeutic options in patients with CRPC.""","""['Johannes Hofland', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Natasja F J Dits', 'Jacobie Steenbergen', 'Geert J L H van Leenders', 'Guido Jenster', 'Fritz H Schröder', 'Frank H de Jong']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Intraprostatic steroidogenic enzymes - letter.', 'Distinct patterns of dysregulated expression of enzymes involved in androgen synthesis and metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer tumors.', 'A low carbohydrate, high protein diet suppresses intratumoral androgen synthesis and slows castration-resistant prostate tumor growth in mice.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'The DHEA-sulfate depot following P450c17 inhibition supports the case for AKR1C3 inhibition in high risk localized and advanced castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hormonal regulation of steroidogenic enzyme gene expression in Leydig cells.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of castration-resistant prostate cancer growth by genistein through suppression of AKR1C3.', 'Plasma Exosomal AKR1C3 mRNA Expression Is a Predictive and Prognostic Biomarker in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Intracrine androgen biosynthesis and drug resistance.', 'Abiraterone switches castration-resistant prostate cancer dependency from adrenal androgens towards androgen receptor variants and glucocorticoid receptor signalling.']"""

The criteria for metabolic syndrome were consistent with those defined by the NCEP-ATPIII-AHA/NHLBI statement.

Results:   Geometric mean PSA level increased linearly and significantly with increasing age and decreasing BMI (P < 0.001). Although the geometric mean PSA levels were lower in men with metabolic syndrome than in those without the condition, metabolic syndrome no longer retained a statistically significant association with PSA after the adjustment for age and BMI (P = 0.850). Among five metabolic components, higher waist circumference and fasting plasma glucose level were significantly associated with lower PSA (P = 0.021 and P = 0.001), whereas hypertension was significantly associated with higher PSA (P < 0.001), after complete adjustment for age, BMI, and other metabolic components.

Mutagenesis and functional studies confirm that SRC3 is a preferred coactivator for hormone-activated AR.

However, the regulatory mechanism for Mcl-1 expression in PCa cells remains elusive.  Results:   Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Mcl-1 expression was elevated in PCa specimens with high Gleason grades and further significantly increased in bone metastasis, suggesting a pivotal role of Mcl-1 in PCa metastasis. We further found that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a novel regulator of Mcl-1 expression in PCa cells. Inhibition of endogenous Mcl-1 induced apoptosis, indicating that Mcl-1 is an important survival factor in PCa cells. Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), the ""co-receptor"" for VEGF165 isoform, was found to be highly expressed in PCa cells, and indispensible in the regulation of Mcl-1.

VEGF165 induction of Mcl-1 may involve rapid activation of Src kinases and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3). Importantly, NRP1 overexpression and c-MET activation were positively associated with progression and bone metastasis in human PCa specimens and xenograft tissues.

Two DLTs (Grade 4 neutropenia) occurred at 550 mg/m²/day, and 425 mg/m²/d was declared the maximum tolerated dose. ENMD-1198 was absorbed rapidly with a T(max) of 1-2 h. Exposure to ENMD-1198 (C(max) and AUC₀₋₂₄ hr increased linearly with dose. The mean terminal half-life was 15 h. A 3-fold accumulation was found after multiple doses. Five patients achieved stabilization of disease for at least 2 cycles, three of whom (with neuroendocrine carcinoma of pancreas, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer) demonstrated prolonged stabilization ranging from 8-24.5 cycles.  Conclusion:   ENMD-1198 is well-tolerated with a pharmacokinetic exposure profile compatible with once daily dosing. The recommended phase II dose of ENMD-1198 is 425 mg/m²/d. Early evidence of prolonged disease stabilization in pre-treated patients suggests ENMD-1198 is worthy of additional investigation.""","""['Qing Zhou', 'Daniel Gustafson', 'Sujatha Nallapareddy', 'Sami Diab', 'Stephen Leong', 'Karl Lewis', 'Lia Gore', 'Wells A Messersmith', 'Anthony M Treston', 'S Gail Eckhardt', 'Carolyn Sidor', 'D Ross Camidge']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Significant antitumor activity in vivo following treatment with the microtubule agent ENMD-1198.', 'Phase I safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of ENMD-2076, a novel angiogenic and Aurora kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors.', 'Phase I trial of 2-methoxyestradiol NanoCrystal dispersion in advanced solid malignancies.', 'Phase I safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of 2-methoxyestradiol alone or in combination with docetaxel in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.', 'Therapeutic promises of 2-methoxyestradiol and its drug disposition challenges.', '2-Methoxyestradiol and Its Combination with a Natural Compound, Ferulic Acid, Induces Melanoma Cell Death via Downregulation of Hsp60 and Hsp90.', 'The Major Heat Shock Proteins, Hsp70 and Hsp90, in 2-Methoxyestradiol-Mediated Osteosarcoma Cell Death Model.', 'The resurgence of estrogens in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hypoxia inducible factor down-regulation, cancer and cancer stem cells (CSCs): ongoing success stories.', 'Oestrogens and oestrogen receptors in prostate cancer.']"""

We used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to measure the levels of the deletion in individual negative needle biopsies from 101 patients who had a repeat biopsy within a year with known outcomes. Using an empirically established cycle threshold (Ct) cutoff of 31, and the lowest Ct for each patient as diagnostic of prostate cancer, as well as the histopathologic diagnosis on second biopsy, we calculated the clinical performance of the deletion. The Ct cutoff at 31 gave a sensitivity and specificity of 84 and 54%, respectively, with the area under a receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.749. The negative predictive value was 91%. The assay was able to predict the presence of a missed tumor in 17 out of 20 men a year before diagnosis. This ancillary test appears to identify men who do not require a repeat biopsy with a high degree of certainty.

PSCA has been reported highly expressed in bladder cancer and been considered as a useful marker for diagnosis and progression of bladder cancer. To determine whether rs2294008 polymorphism is associated with risk of bladder cancer in Chinese populations, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 581 cases and 580 controls. Sixteen normal bladder tissues adjacent to tumors were used to evaluate the functionality of this polymorphism. We genotyped the rs2294008 polymorphism and assessed its association with risk of bladder cancer and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in normal bladder tissues. A significant increased risk of bladder cancer was found for rs2294008 CT/TT genotypes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.75) compared with the CC genotype. Furthermore, analysis of PSCA mRNA expression identified a clear correlation of rs2294008 with expression levels of PSCA mRNA.

Many definitions of biochemical recurrence are currently used in the research literature. We examined various definitions in a large clinical cohort to explore whether estimation differs by definition.  Materials and methods:   The cohort included 5,473 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 1985 to 2007 at our cancer center. Separate analysis was done with 12 definitions of biochemical recurrence used in published studies. Cox regression was done to estimate HRs for established predictors. Predictive accuracy was determined using the concordance index.  Results:   Depending on the definition the recurrence-free probability was 86% to 91% at 3 years and 81% to 87% at 5 years. HRs tended to be smaller for the most inclusive definitions but were fairly similar across all definitions. The univariate HR was 2.1 to 2.4 for log prostate specific antigen, 2.4 to 2.6 for clinical stage T2b vs T2a or less and 9.8 to 15 for biopsy Gleason grade 8 or greater vs 6 or less. Multivariate HRs were more homogeneous across the definitions. The concordance index was 0.79 to 0.83 and 0.83 to 0.87 for the preoperative and postoperative nomograms, respectively.  Conclusions:   Estimates of risk ratios and predictive accuracy are generally robust to the biochemical recurrence definition. For clinical research, groups using different definitions will come to similar conclusions on prognostic factors. The definition should be factored into studies comparing overall recurrence probabilities.""","""['Angel M Cronin', 'Guilherme Godoy', 'Andrew J Vickers']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Biochemical (prostate specific antigen) recurrence probability following radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy for clinically localized, high risk prostate cancer: critical analysis of risk assessment methods.', 'Standardizing the Definition of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy-What Prostate Specific Antigen Cut Point Best Predicts a Durable Increase and Subsequent Systemic Progression?', 'Impact of patient age on biochemical recurrence rates following radical prostatectomy.', 'Variation in the definition of biochemical recurrence in patients treated for localized prostate cancer: the American Urological Association Prostate Guidelines for Localized Prostate Cancer Update Panel report and recommendations for a standard in the reporting of surgical outcomes.', 'Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Biochemical Recurrence in Patients after Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: A Retrospective Study.', 'Association Between Surgical Stress and Biochemical Recurrence After Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Clinical Significance of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Preoperative Predictor of Oncologic Outcome in Very Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Predictive Factors and Oncologic Outcome of Downgrade to Pathologic Gleason Score 6⁻7 after Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Biopsy Gleason Score 8⁻10.', 'Free testosterone value before radical prostatectomy is related to oncologic outcomes and post-operative erectile function.']"""

This excessive variation is known as heterogeneity. We explored whether there is also heterogeneity among high volume surgeons with respect to cancer control after surgery.  Materials and methods:   The study cohort consisted of 7,725 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with open radical prostatectomy at 4 major American academic medical centers from 1987 to 2003 by 1 of 54 surgeons. We defined biochemical recurrence as serum prostate specific antigen 0.4 ng/ml or greater followed by a higher level. Multivariate random effects models were used to evaluate prostate cancer recurrence heterogeneity among surgeons after adjusting for case mix (prostate specific antigen, pathological stage and grade), surgery year and surgeon experience.  Results:   We found statistically significant heterogeneity in the prostate cancer recurrence rate independent of surgeon experience (p = 0.002). Seven experienced surgeons had an adjusted 5-year prostate cancer recurrence rate of less than 10% while another 5 had a rate that exceeded 25%. Significant heterogeneity remained on sensitivity analysis adjusting for possible differences in followup, patient selection and stage migration.

Univariate and age adjusted multivariate logistic regression was done to estimate the cancer RR in these prostate specific antigen groups. We calculated the prostate cancer rate at subsequent followups.  Results:   Median prostate specific antigen in black and white men was 0.7 ng/ml at age 50 years or less. The prostate cancer rate was not significantly different in the groups with prostate specific antigen less than 0.6 and 0.7 to 1.4 ng/ml in black or white men. Black and white men with initial prostate specific antigen in the 1.5 to 2.4 ng/ml range had a 9.3 and 6.7-fold increase in the age adjusted prostate cancer RR, respectively. At up to 9 years of followup initial prostate specific antigen 1.5 ng/ml or greater was associated with gradually increased detection at followup in black and white men.

Materials and methods:   A total of 2,132 patients were treated between June 2003 and January 2008. We excluded from study patients with prior treatment (115), missing data (83) and lymph node involvement (30). The remaining cohort (1,904) was compared based on clinical, surgical and pathological factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed comparing biochemical recurrence after robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy. A Cox proportional hazards model was generated to determine whether surgical approach is an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence.  Results:   There were 491 radical retropubic prostatectomies (25.9%) and 1,413 robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomies (74.1%) performed, and median followup was 10 months (IQR 2 to 23). On univariate analysis the robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group was slightly lower risk with lower median prostate specific antigen (5.4 vs 5.8, p <0.01), a lower proportion of pathological grade 7-10 (48.5% vs 54.7%, p <0.01) and lower pathological stage (80.5% pT2 vs 69.6% pT2, p <0.01). The 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was similar between the robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy groups on the whole as well as when stratified by pathological stage, grade and margin status. On multivariate analysis extracapsular extension (p <0.01), pathological grade 7 or greater (p <0.01) and positive surgical margin (p <0.01) were independent predictors of biochemical recurrence while surgical approach was not.

We compared inguinal hernia repair rates in patients treated with radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer relative to those of 2 nonsurgically treated groups of patients, namely individuals who underwent prostate biopsy or transurethral resection of the prostate, and a surgically treated group of patients who underwent pelvic lymph node dissection, within a large North American database.  Materials and methods:   Using the Quebec Health Plan database we identified 5,478 men treated with radical prostatectomy vs 6,933, 7,697 and 532 who underwent prostate biopsy, transurethral resection of the prostate or pelvic lymph node dissection, respectively, between 1990 and 2000. Kaplan-Meier plots graphically explored inguinal hernia repair rates. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses examined variables associated with inguinal hernia repair after either group. Covariates consisted of age, year of treatment and the Charlson comorbidity index.  Results:   The 1, 2, 5 and 10-year inguinal hernia repair rates after radical prostatectomy were 4.4%, 6.7%, 11.7% and 17.1%, respectively. For the same points after prostate biopsy the rates were 1.7%, 2.9%, 6.1% and 9.8% vs 1.7%, 2.6%, 5.5% and 9.2%, respectively, after transurethral resection of the prostate, and 0.8%, 2.4%, 4.9% and 9.3% after pelvic lymph node dissection (pairwise log rank tests p <0.001). On multivariable Cox regression analyses the rate of inguinal hernia repair was 1.9, 2.1 and 1.7-fold higher for patients who underwent radical prostatectomy vs prostate biopsy, transurethral resection of the prostate and pelvic lymph node dissection, respectively (all p <0.001).

Methods:   Paraffin-embedded section samples of breast cancer were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis to determine Par-4, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), c-erbB2, Ki67, p53 and bcl-2 expression. The correlation between Par-4 and the other biomarkers and clinical factors was determined by multivariate analysis.

But the role of Grp78 in the invasion of human hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported. In this article, we examined if Grp78 was associated with the invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma and explored the possible underlying mechanism.  Methods:   The Grp78 and FAK expression levels in 44 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were examined using immunohistochemistry. Grp78 overexpressing SMMC7721 cells were established by pcDNA3.1 (+)-Grp78 transfection and screened by G418. Grp78 and FAK levels in Grp78 overexpressing cells were down-regulated by siRNA transfection. The invasion status of tumor cells was evaluated by transwell assay in vitro, and chick embryo metastasis model in vivo. Cell spreading was determined by cell spreading assay, and quantitatively measured by Orisis software HUG. Grp78, pY397 FAK, pY576/577 FAK and FAK levels were detected by western blot. RhoA activity was detected by GST pulldown assay. The distribution of actin cytoskeleton was observed by fluorescent staining.  Results:   Grp78 expression levels in 44 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were negatively correlated with tumor grading, and positively correlated with portal invasion and intra-hepatic invasion. Overexpression of Grp78 in SMMC7721 cells promoted the invasion of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and this increase in tumor cell invasion was blocked by Grp78 siRNA knockdown. Our results also revealed that overexpression of Grp78 in SMMC7721 cells accelerated the process of cell spreading and promoted lamellipodia formation. Further analysis showed that overexpression of Grp78 in SMMC7721 cells increased pY397 and pY576/577 levels of FAK. Grp78 siRNA knockdown decreased FAK activation and activity. Our results also revealed that Grp78 overexpression in SMMC7721 cells decreased RhoA-GTP level, and Grp78 siRNA knockdown rescued RhoA-GTP level in Grp78 overexpressing cells, indicating Grp78 inhibited RhoA activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, overexpression of Grp78 in SMMC7721 cells increased phospho-p190RhoGAP level. FAK siRNA knockdown in Grp78 overexpressing cells reversed phospho-p190RhoGAP level. These data suggested that Grp78 inhibited RhoA activity by up-regulated phospho-p190RhoGAP level and Grp78 mediated p190RhoGAP phosphorylation is FAK dependent.  Conclusion:   Grp78 promoted the invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma both in vitro and in vivo.

The primary tumor was in the breast in (48.1%) of the patients, in the lung in (20.6%) in the prostate in (17.6%), and in other sites in (13.7%). Bone metastases were located in the spine (42.2%), pelvis (29.4%) limbs (21.6%), and other sites (6.8%). Pain relief was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) and also by analgesic requirement. Evaluation was performed before and at 2 weeks then every 4 weeks for 24 weeks after treatment. A total of 102 patients were evaluable for response; 50 in the SF group and 52 in the CF group.  Results:   There were no significant diferences in the frequency or duration of pain relief between the two study groups.

EMP discontinuation due to side effects was encountered more often in study 1 (45.9%) than in study 2 (27.8%). Among the adverse side effects gastrointestinal toxicity was most prevalent in both studies. One patient died of acute pulmonary embolism in study 1, but no one died in study 2. There were 6 cancer deaths in the gastrointestinal tract in study 1 but only 2 cancer deaths in study 2.  Conclusion:   Our data indicate that the overall PSA response rate was comparable between both studies. However, rates in overall toxicity and drug discontinuation were higher in study 1 than in study 2. We consider that study 2 is more promising for the treatment of previously untreated advanced prostate cancer, although the rate of adverse side effects is still high as compared with other hormonal therapies. In order to overcome the high toxicity rate, especially the gastrointestinal toxicity, we recently elaborated a method employing tailor-made medicine using SNPs of 1A1 gene in cytochrome P-450 for decreasing the rate of gastrointestinal toxicity. Using this method of patient selection, study 3 has been successfully launched on September 2005 with high drug compliance. Better clinical results are being accumulated.""","""['T Kitamura', 'M Suzuki', 'H Nishimatsu', 'T Kurosaki', 'Y Enomoto', 'H Fukuhara', 'H Kume', 'T Takeuchi', 'L Miao', 'H Jiangang', 'L Xiaoqiang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['EMP combination chemotherapy and low-dose monotherapy in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Safety and effectiveness of neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist plus low-dose estramustine phosphate in high-risk prostate cancer: a prospective single-arm study.', 'Prospective study of estramustine phosphate for hormone refractory prostate cancer patients following androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Dose escalation of oral vinorelbine in combination with estramustine in hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Estramustine phosphate withdrawal syndrome in relapsed prostate cancer: two case reports.', 'Cervical cancer immune infiltration microenvironment identification, construction of immune scores, assisting patient prognosis and immunotherapy.', 'PROTACs in Epigenetic Cancer Therapy: Current Status and Future Opportunities.', 'A review of recent advances on single use of antibody-drug conjugates or combination with tumor immunology therapy for gynecologic cancer.', 'The copper-associated protein STEAP2 correlated with glioma prognosis and immune infiltration.', 'Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) Combined With Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) for Platinum-Sensitive Recurrence Epithelial Ovarian Cancer With HRR Mutation: A Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial.']"""

These operations have been developed in our department in the late 1990 s and have since been performed in more than 1000 patients and certified as advanced surgery by the Japanese government in 2006.  Methods:   Adrenalectomy, radical nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy were carried out via a single minimum incision under the conditions of gasless, portless (without trocar ports), intact peritoneum and at low cost with reusable devices. The anatomic plane was separated through the incision and a wide working space was made extraperitoneally. New devices were made especially for this operation in our department, which are now commercially available. The results of the most recent consecutive cases (2005-2007) are evaluated. The results of adrenalectomy and radical nephrectomy performed by 12 operators including inexperienced doctors were compared with the initial results performed by 2 operators, mostly by one operator.  Results:   In the recent 60 cases of adrenalectomy, the average length of incision, operative time, estimated blood loss were 5.7 cm (5.6 cm in the initial 30 cases), 156 min (147 min) and 174 ml (139 ml), respectively. A complication was observed in one case, injury to the renal artery. Blood transfusion was not performed. Average days to oral feeding, to long walking (more than 100 m) and to possible minimal hospital stay were 1.3 days (2 days), 1.1 days (1.1 days) and 1.9 days (4.6 days), respectively. In the recent 80 cases of radical nephrectomy, the average length of incision, operative time, estimated blood loss were 6.6 cm (6.6 cm in the initial 80 cases), 192 min (186 min) and 315 ml (324 ml), respectively. Complications were not observed in any of the cases (2) and blood transfusion was performed in 1 case (3). Average days to oral feeding, to long walking (more than 100 m) and to possible minimal hospital stay were 1.1 days (1.4 days), 1.2 days (1.4 days) and 1.9 days (4.8 days), respectively. In the recent 50 cases of radical prostatectomy, the average length of incision and operative time were 5.9 cm and 261 min, respectively. Two complications (small rectal injuries) were observed and one blood transfusion was performed. Average days to oral feeding, to long walking (more than 100 m) and possible minimal hospital stay were 1.0 days, 1.0 days and 2.4 days, respectively. Wound pain was minimal and analgesics were generally not required on the second postoperative day in the above 3 operations. Although prophylactic antibiotics were not used in the recent cases of adrenalectomy and radical nephrectomy, surgical site infection was not observed.  Conclusion:   Minimum incision endoscopic surgery (MIES) in Japanese urology is a safe, reproducible, cost-effective and minimally invasive treatment option for adrenal tumor, renal cell carcinoma and prostate carcinoma.""","""['K Kihara', 'T Kobayashi', 'S Kawakami', 'Y Fujii', 'Y Kageyama', 'H Masuda']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Portless endoscopic radical nephrectomy via a single minimum incision in 80 patients.', 'Portless endoscopic adrenalectomy via a single minimal incision using a retroperitoneal approach: experience with initial 30 cases.', 'Sequential bilateral minimum incision endoscopic radical nephrectomy in dialysis patients with bilateral renal cell carcinomas.', 'Gasless single-port access endoscopic surgery in urology: minimum incision endoscopic surgery, MIES.', 'Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) adrenalectomy and partial nephrectomy: current Italian experience with two challenging surgical procedures.', 'Integrated image navigation system using head-mounted display in ""RoboSurgeon"" endoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Gasless minimum incision access used for extracorporeal orthotopic bladder substitution after laparoscopic radical cystectomy.', 'Choice of surgical access for retroperitoneoscopic ureterolithotomy according to the results of 3D reconstruction of operational zone agreed with the patient: initial experience.', 'Salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: outcomes and prognostic factors especially focusing on pathological findings.']"""

There is no consensus about how the pelvic lymphadenectomy should be performed for patients with cT2, Gleason score 7 or higher, PSA higher than 10 ng/mL. Scintigraphic studies of prostate lymph drainage show that many lymph nodes are not dissected according to the current recommendation of lymphadenectomy which could explain the high rate of cancer recurrence. The objectives of this work are an analysis of the local lymph node metastasis according to the preoperative data (digital examination, PSA and Gleason score) and a comparison between laparoscopic extended and limited pelvic lymphadenectomy, for staging, their technique and complications.  Methods:   Two groups were created for analysis. The indications for laparoscopic pelvic lymph-adenectomy are the following: preoperative PSA 10 ng/mL or higher, Gleason score 7 or higher and/or digital examination cT2. Patients with suspected distant metastasis were excluded. The first group is composed of the patients who under-went a limited laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy (LLPL) between January 1995 and December 2002. The medical data were analyzed retrospectively. The second group was created with patients who received extended laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy (ELPL). These data were consecutively collected between November 2006 and October 2007. LLPL was the extraction of the external iliac and obturator lymph nodes. ELPL included, additionally, dissection of the internal iliac lymph nodes as well as tissue medial to the genitofemoral nerve. Histopathological findings were compared with serum PSA, histopathological stage and preoperative biopsy. Complications, operating time, and number of extracted lymph nodes were also compared.  Results:   There were no significant differences in age, serum PSA or mean biopsy Gleason between two groups. The first group (LPLL) is composed of 381 patients and the second (ELPL), 163. The mean operating time was 72.5 minutes for LLPL and 84.3 for ELPL. The mean number of lymph nodes extracted was 13.8 (LLPL) and 31.1 (ELPL). Metastases were detected in 18.8% (LLPL) and 24.7% (ELPL). In 37.5% of cases, the metastasis occurred in lymph nodes outside from those dissected by LPLL. The rates of complications and conversion rate were not significantly different for the two groups.  Conclusions:   For patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, ELPL is associated with a higher rate of detection of lymph node metastasis outside of the field dissected in the LPLL. Pelvic lymphadenectomy, especially extraction of the lymph nodes of the internal iliac is important in patients with preoperative Gleason score 7 or greater and/or serum PSA greater than 10 ng/mL. Laparoscopic lymphadenectomy does not augment the rate of complications and is an excellent technique in prostate cancer staging.""","""['L F Arenas', 'C Füllhase', 'P Boemans', 'J Fichtner']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: high incidence of lymph node metastasis.', 'Laparoscopic extended pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer: description of the surgical technique and initial results.', 'Incidence of positive pelvic lymph nodes in patients with prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of < or =10 ng/mL and biopsy Gleason score of < or =6, and their influence on PSA progression-free survival after radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic lymphadenectomy.

The American Red Cross recommends that recipients of YF vaccine defer blood product donation for 2 weeks because of the theoretical risk for transmission from a viremic donor. On April 10, 2009, a hospital blood bank supervisor learned that, on March 27, blood products had been collected from 89 U.S. active duty trainees who had received YF vaccine 4 days before donation. This report summarizes the subsequent investigation by the hospital and CDC to identify lapses in donor deferral and to determine whether transfusion-related transmission of YF vaccine virus occurred. The investigation found that a recent change in the timing of trainee vaccination had occurred and that vaccinees had not reported recent YF vaccination status at time of donation. Despite a prompt recall, six units of blood products were transfused into five patients. No clinical evidence or laboratory abnormalities consistent with a serious adverse reaction were identified in four recipients within the first month after transfusion; the fifth patient, who had prostate cancer and end-stage, transfusion-dependent, B-cell lymphoma, died while in hospice care. Three of the four surviving patients had evidence of serologic response to YF vaccine virus.

Materials and methods:   Before prostatectomy, 38 men (mean age, 60 years) with prostate cancer underwent MRI of the prostate with multiplanar 2D turbo spin-echo T2-weighted sequences (total acquisition time, approximately 11 minutes 4 seconds) and a 3D T2-weighted sampling perfection with application optimized contrasts sequence with different flip angle evolutions (SPACE) (acquisition time, approximately 3 minutes 52 seconds). Two blinded observers in consensus reviewed 2D turbo spin-echo T2-weighted images and SPACE images for detection of peripheral zone cancer, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesicle invasion. The observers also assessed subjective image quality and measured the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of normal peripheral zone and tumor-to-peripheral zone contrast. Prostatectomy was used as the reference standard. The diagnostic accuracy of the two sequences was assessed with generalized estimating equations and McNemar tests. The agreement between sequences was assessed with kappa coefficients. A paired Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the subjective image quality, SNR, and tumor-to-peripheral zone contrast of the two sequences.  Results:   For tumor detection and diagnosis of extracapsular extension, there was substantial agreement between the two sequences (kappa = 0.79, kappa = 0.76) with no difference in sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy (p = 0.25-1), or image quality (p = 0.937). Images obtained with the 2D turbo spin-echo sequence had a significantly higher SNR ratio for normal peripheral zone (p = 0.0010), but SPACE images had significantly greater tumor-to-peripheral zone contrast (p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   In comparison with conventional multiplanar 2D turbo spin-echo MRI of the prostate, 3D T2-weighted SPACE MRI was associated with substantial time saving (nearly 8 minutes), had similar image quality and accuracy in the diagnosis of tumor and extracapsular extension, and had better tumor conspicuity.""","""['Andrew B Rosenkrantz', 'Jeffry Neil', 'Xiangtian Kong', 'Jonathan Melamed', 'James S Babb', 'Samir S Taneja', 'Bachir Taouli']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Uterine tumors: comparison of 3D versus 2D T2-weighted turbo spin-echo MR imaging at 3.0 T--initial experience.', 'Preoperative 3T MR imaging of rectal cancer: local staging accuracy using a two-dimensional and three-dimensional T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequence.', 'Preliminary clinical experience at 3 T with a 3D T2-weighted sequence compared with multiplanar 2D for evaluation of the female pelvis.', 'Clinical utility of optimized three-dimensional T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted sequences in spinal magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Pretreatment evaluation of prostate cancer: role of MR imaging and 1H MR spectroscopy.', 'Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v 2.1: Overview and Critical Points.', 'High-resolution 3D T2-weighted SPACE sequence with compressed sensing for the prostate gland: diagnostic performance in comparison with conventional T2-weighted images.', 'Model-based image reconstruction with wavelet sparsity regularization for through-plane resolution restoration in T2 -weighted spin-echo prostate MRI.', 'Abbreviated MR Protocols in Prostate MRI.', 'Automatic zonal segmentation of the prostate from 2D and 3D T2-weighted MRI and evaluation for clinical use.']"""

The parameters of each component comprise an amplitude and a relative velocity. Whereas the relative velocity of the slow component is significantly associated with the volume of benign tissue, both the amplitude and relative velocity of the fast component are significantly associated with the volume of tumor.

We analyzed tumor expression of apoptotic markers with respect to outcome in men with localized prostate cancer in two randomized controlled trials of radiotherapy dose escalation.  Methods and materials:   Between 1995 and 2001, 308 patients with localized prostate cancer received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and radical radiotherapy at our institution in one of two dose-escalation trials. The biopsy specimens in 201 cases were used to make a biopsy tissue microarray. We evaluated tumor expression of Bcl-2, p53, and MDM2 by immunohistochemistry with respect to outcome.  Results:   Median follow-up was 7 years, and 5-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) was 70.4% (95% CI, 63.5-76.3%). On univariate analysis, expression of Bcl-2 (p < 0.001) and p53 (p = 0.017), but not MDM2 (p = 0.224), was significantly associated with FFBF. Expression of Bcl-2 remained significantly associated with FFBF (p = 0.001) on multivariate analysis, independently of T stage, Gleason score, initial prostate-specific antigen level, and radiotherapy dose. Seven-year biochemical control was 61% vs. 41% (p = 0.0122) for 74 Gy vs. 64 Gy, respectively, among patients with Bcl-2-positive tumors and 87% vs. 81% (p = 0.423) for 74 Gy vs. 64 Gy, respectively, among patients with Bcl-2-negative tumors. There was no statistically significant interaction between dose and Bcl-2 expression.

We evaluated the impact of margin status on subsequent clinical progression and mortality.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of 11,729 patients who underwent prostatectomy between 1990 and 2006. Survival was estimated for patients with vs without a positive margin and compared using the log rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the impact of margin status on survival.  Results:   Overall 3,651 (31.1%) men were identified with a positive margin. Median postoperative followup was 8.2 years (IQR 4.4, 12.1). The 10-year biochemical recurrence-free rate for patients with and without a positive margin was 56% and 77%, respectively (p <0.001), while 10-year local recurrence-free survival was 89% vs 95% (p <0.001).

In this context, miR-21 was found to be overexpressed in different human cancers (e.g. glioblastoma, breast cancer). In addition, it is thought to be endowed with oncogenic properties due to its ability to negatively modulate the expression of tumor-suppressor genes (e.g. PTEN) and to cause the reversion of malignant phenotype when knocked- down in several tumor models. On the basis of these findings, miR-21 has been proposed as a widely exploitable cancer-related target. However, scanty information is available concerning the relevance of miR-21 for prostate cancer. In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-21 and its potential as a therapeutic target in two prostate cancer cell lines, characterized by different miR-21 expression levels and PTEN gene status.  Results:   We provide evidence that miR-21 knockdown in prostate cancer cells is not sufficient per se i) to affect the proliferative and invasive potential or the chemo- and radiosensitivity profiles or ii) to modulate the expression of the tumor-suppressors PTEN and Pdcd4, which in other tumor types were found to be regulated by miR-21. We also show that miR-21 is not differently expressed in carcinomas and matched normal tissues obtained from 36 untreated prostate cancer patients subjected to radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Overall, our data suggest that miR-21 is not a central player in the onset of prostate cancer and that its single hitting is not a valuable therapeutic strategy in the disease. This supports the notion that the oncogenic properties of miR-21 could be cell and tissue dependent and that the potential role of a given miRNA as a therapeutic target should be contextualized with respect to the disease.""","""['Marco Folini', 'Paolo Gandellini', 'Nicole Longoni', 'Valentina Profumo', 'Maurizio Callari', 'Marzia Pennati', 'Maurizio Colecchia', 'Rosanna Supino', 'Silvia Veneroni', 'Roberto Salvioni', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Maria Grazia Daidone', 'Nadia Zaffaroni']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Oncogenic microRNA-4534 regulates PTEN pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Upregulation of miR-153 promotes cell proliferation via downregulation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene in human prostate cancer.', 'miR-410-3p promotes prostate cancer progression via regulating PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Role of miRNA let-7 and its major targets in prostate cancer.', 'The important role of miR-770 as a novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for human cancer and other diseases.', 'A systematic method introduced a common lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in the different stages of prostate cancer.', 'Palindrome-Embedded Hairpin Structure and Its Target-Catalyzed Padlock Cyclization for Label-Free MicroRNA-Initiated Rolling Circle Amplification.', 'A novel platform using homobifunctional hydrazide for enrichment and isolation of urinary circulating RNAs.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Metal-organic frameworks-based biosensor for microRNA detection in prostate cancer cell lines.']"""

Aim:   We evaluate the effect of a complete pelvic floor rehabilitation program on both incontinence and erectile dysfunction, including climacturia, in a preliminary case series.  Main outcomes measures:   Pad usage and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) Questionnaire.  Methods:   Three male patients, previously submitted to nerve and bladder neck sparing radical prostatectomy, presented with urinary incontinence, climacturia and erectile dysfunction of new onset. We decided to manage those subjects with a pelvic-floor rehabilitation program consisting of active pelvic-floor muscle exercises, electromyography biofeedback for strength and endurance, electrical stimulation. The whole program lasted 4 months, with weekly sessions, including general advices on lifestyle changes. Pad usage for incontinence and IIEF-15 were used to assess symptoms before and after the procedure.  Results:   Before a complete rehabilitation program, pad usage was 1 per day in all the subjects, and the score for erectile function was set at 17 (range 15-20). After the procedure, all the patients experienced a satisfying urinary continence and an improvement in erectile function (mean IIEF score: 22, range 19-24). Similarly, climacturia seems to be subjectively reduced in all the subjects.  Conclusion:   Pelvic floor muscles exercises seem to result in an improved urinary continence and erectile function after radical prostatectomy. Since this is the first clinical case series dealing with this topic, our outcomes are encouraging and suggest the potential usefulness of such noninvasive treatment modality.""","""['Maria Chiara Sighinolfi', 'Massimo Rivalta', 'Alessandro Mofferdin', 'Salvatore Micali', 'Stefano De Stefani', 'Giampaolo Bianchi']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Pelvic floor muscle training for erectile dysfunction and climacturia 1 year after nerve sparing radical prostatectomy: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Effects of perioperative pelvic floor muscle training on early recovery of urinary continence and erectile function in men undergoing radical prostatectomy: a randomized clinical trial.', 'A clinical overview of the treatment of post-prostatectomy incontinence.', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'Beneficial effects of biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle training in patients with urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: A systematic review and metaanalysis.', 'Climacturia: what treatment options do we offer to those with and without concomitant erectile dysfunction?', 'Neglected side effects to curative prostate cancer treatments.', 'Pelvic Floor Muscle Training and Erectile Dysfunction in Radical Prostatectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial Investigating a Non-Invasive Addition to Penile Rehabilitation.', 'Climacturia: a comprehensive review assessing pathophysiology, prevalence, impact, and treatment options regarding the ""leak of pleasure"".', 'Orgasm-associated urinary incontinence (climacturia) following radical prostatectomy: a review of pathophysiology and current treatment options.']"""

Methods:   This was a cohort study of 559 men enrolled in a state-funded program for low-income patients known as Improving Access, Counseling, and Treatment for Californians With Prostate Cancer (IMPACT). Multinomial regression was used to compare types of treatments patients received from different providers.  Results:   Between 2001 and 2006, 315 (56%) participants received treatment from county hospitals and 244 (44%) from private providers.

Participants treated by private providers were more likely than those treated in county hospitals to be white (35% vs 10%, P < .01) and less likely to undergo surgery (29% vs 54%, P < .01). Multinomial regression analyses showed that participants treated by private providers were nearly 2(1/2) times more likely than those treated by public providers to receive radiotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-4.07) and >4(1/2) times more likely to receive primary androgen deprivation (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 2.15-10.36) than surgery.

Methods:   Haploid yeast cells were treated in suspension with platinum agents and nitrogen mustard alone or in combination with NSC compounds, and survival was measured by colony-formation assays. Sensitivity of ovarian and prostate cancer cells toward these treatments was evaluated using the MTS assay. Cell cycle progression was determined by flow cytometry.  Results:   The enhancement of cisplatin sensitivity by NSC109268 found in yeast was confirmed in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer lines and in prostate cancer cells. In yeast and in human carcinoma cells, a correlation of enhanced sensitivity with delaying S-phase progression was revealed.

Although it has been reported that abnormal activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin-dependent pathway is often observed in human prostate cancer, the involvement of the beta-catenin-independent pathway in this cancer is unclear. Abnormal expression of Wnt5a and beta-catenin was observed in 27 (28%) and 49 (50%) of 98 prostate cancer cases, respectively, by immunohistochemical analyses. Simultaneous expression of Wnt5a and beta-catenin was observed in only five cases, suggesting their exclusive expression. The positive detection of Wnt5a was correlated with high Gleason scores and biochemical relapse of prostate cancer, but that of beta-catenin was not. Knockdown and overexpression of Wnt5a in human prostate cancer cell lines reduced and stimulated, respectively, their invasion activities, and the invasion activity required Frizzled2 and Ror2 as Wnt receptors. Wnt5a activated Jun-N-terminal kinase through protein kinase D (PKD) and the inhibition of PKD suppressed Wnt5a-dependent cell migration and invasion. In addition, Wnt5a induced the expression of metalloproteinase-1 through the recruitment of JunD to its promoter region.

Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) expression becomes highly upregulated in PC cells after androgen withdrawal or chemotherapy, in which it functions as a cytoprotective chaperone to confer broad-spectrum treatment resistance. The purpose of this study is to elucidate anti-apoptotic pathways regulated by Hsp27 that are activated during PC progression. Using two-hybrid experiment, we found that Hsp27 was having a major role in the protein translational initiation process. Furthermore, using complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analysis, 4E binding protein 1 was identified as being proportionately and highly regulated by Hsp27. These data led us to analyze the protein synthesis initiation pathway, which is a prerequisite for cell growth and proliferation. Using northern and western blot analysis, we found that Hsp27 downregulation decreased eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) expression at the protein, but not mRNA, level. The cytoprotection afforded by Hsp27 overexpression was attenuated by eIF4E knockdown using specific eIF4E short interfering RNA (siRNA). Co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunofluorescence confirmed that Hsp27 colocalizes and interacts directly with eIF4E. Hsp27-eIF4E interaction decreases eIF4E ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. By chaperoning eIF4E, Hsp27 seems to protect the protein synthesis initiation process to enhance cell survival during cell stress induced by castration or chemotherapy. Forced overexpression of eIF4E induces resistance to androgen-withdrawal and paclitaxel treatment in the prostate LNCaP cells in vitro. These findings identify Hsp27 as a modulator of eIF4E and establish a potential mechanism for the eIF4E-regulated apoptosis after androgen ablation and chemotherapy.

Previous reports have indicated a trend of differing modalities of treatment chosen by African American and white men. We investigated the role of ethnicity in primary treatment choice and how this affected overall and cancer-specific mortality. METHODS By utilizing data abstracted from Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE), patients were compared by ethnicity, primary treatment, number of comorbidities, risk level according to modified D'Amico criteria, age, highest educational level attained, type of insurance, treatment facility, and perception of general health. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of the tested variables on primary treatment and mortality. Results African American men were more likely to receive nonsurgical therapy than white men with equivalent disease characteristics. Whites were 48% less likely than African Americans to receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared with surgery (P = .02) and were 25% less likely than African Americans to receive radiation therapy compared with surgery (P = .08). Whites with low-risk disease were 71% less likely to receive ADT than African American men with similar disease (P = .01). Adjusted overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality were not significantly different between whites and African Americans (hazard ratios, 0.73 and 0.37, respectively). Risk level, type of treatment, and type of insurance had the strongest effects on risk of mortality. CONCLUSION There is a statistically significant difference in primary treatment for prostate cancer between African American and white men with similar risk profiles. Additional research on the influence of patient/physician education and perception and the role that socioeconomic factors play in mortality from prostate cancer may be areas of focus for public health initiatives.""","""['Kelvin A Moses', 'Alan T Paciorek', 'David F Penson', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Viraj A Master']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Racial treatment trends in localized/regional prostate carcinoma: 1992-1999.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy as primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: data from Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE).', 'Differences in clinical characteristics and disease-free survival for Latino, African American, and non-Latino white men with localized prostate cancer: data from CaPSURE.', 'Racial differences in prostate cancer treatment outcomes: a systematic review.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Racial/ethnic disparities in the distribution and effect of type and number of high-risk criteria on mortality in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of Social Determinants of Health and Prostate Cancer Outcomes Among Black and White Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Impact of centralization of prostate cancer services on the choice of radical treatment.', 'Comparison of Characteristics, Follow-up and Outcomes of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer According to Ethnicity in the GAP3 Global Consortium Database.', 'Understanding Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Spot scanning proton therapy is a treatment delivery means that improves conformal coverage of the clinical target volume (CTV). Placement of individual spots within a target is dependent on traversed tissue density. Errors in patient alignment perturb dose distributions. Moreover, there is a need for a rational planning approach that can mitigate the dosimetric effect of random alignment errors. We propose a treatment planning approach and then analyze the consequences of various simulated alignment errors on prostate treatments.  Methods and materials:   Ten control patients with localized prostate cancer underwent treatment planning for spot scanning proton therapy. After delineation of the clinical target volume, a scanning target volume (STV) was created to guide dose coverage. Errors in patient alignment in two axes (rotational and yaw) as well as translational errors in the anteroposterior direction were then simulated, and dose to the CTV and normal tissues were reanalyzed.  Results:   Coverage of the CTV remained high even in the setting of extreme rotational and yaw misalignments. Changes in the rectum and bladder V45 and V70 were similarly minimal, except in the case of translational errors, where, as a result of opposed lateral beam arrangements, much larger dosimetric perturbations were observed.  Conclusions:   The concept of the STV as applied to spot scanning radiation therapy and as presented in this report leads to robust coverage of the CTV even in the setting of extreme patient misalignments.""","""['Jeff Meyer', 'Jaques Bluett', 'Richard Amos', 'Larry Levy', 'Seungtaek Choi', 'Quynh-Nhu Nguyen', 'X Ron Zhu', 'Michael Gillin', 'Andrew Lee']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Multifield optimization intensity-modulated proton therapy (MFO-IMPT) for prostate cancer: Robustness analysis through simulation of rotational and translational alignment errors.', 'Dosimetric changes resulting from patient rotational setup errors in proton therapy prostate plans.', 'Prospective MRI-based imaging study to assess feasibility of proton therapy for post-prostatectomy radiation.', 'Proton radiation for localized prostate cancer.', 'What can particle therapy add to the treatment of prostate cancer?', 'Analysis of the Rate of Re-planning in Spot-Scanning Proton Therapy.', 'Bevacizumab is an effective treatment for symptomatic cerebral necrosis after carbon ion therapy for recurrent intracranial malignant tumours: A case report.', 'Long-term Clinical Outcomes in Favorable Risk Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Proton Beam Therapy.', 'A Beam-Specific Optimization Target Volume for Stereotactic Proton Pencil Beam Scanning Therapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Validation of dose distribution for liver tumors treated with real-time-image gated spot-scanning proton therapy by log data based dose reconstruction.']"""

Our results indicate that after 72h of incubation, ergosterol peroxide and (22E)-ergosta-7,22-dien-5alpha-hydroxy-3,6-dione at micromolar concentrations exhibited an inhibitory effect on LNCaP and DU-145 cell growth (MTT assay), but the semisynthetic compound was the most active.

The interstitial and endocavity heating applicators, designed for delivering 3-D controllable hyperthermia within High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy implants, consist of linear and sectored arrays of ultrasound transducers with variable power control in both length and angle. A 3D biothermal model, which incorporates relevant anatomical structures and implant geometries based upon HDR treatment planning, has been developed to simulate the temperature distributions induced by these ultrasound applicators within the catheter implants. A temperature-based constrained optimisation algorithm was devised and integrated within the finite-element thermal solver to determine the optimal applied power levels. A temperature-expressed objective function and constraints were employed to limit maximum temperature (T(max)), maximise target coverage (T(target)), and minimise thermal exposure to normal tissue and surrounding organs. The optimisation-based treatment planning was applied on representative examples of clinical HDR implants for endocavity treatment of cervix (n = 3) and interstitial treatment of prostate (n = 3). Applicator positioning and orientation, T(max), and T(target), were varied, and temperature volume and thermal dose volume histograms calculated for each plan. The optimisation approach provided optimal applied power levels (4-24 independent transducer sections) leading to conforming or tailored temperature distributions for all cases, as indicated with improved temperature index T(90) in the target volume and negligible temperature and thermal dose (t(43,max) < 1 min) exposure in surrounding non-targeted tissues, such as bladder and rectum. The precision of the optimised power estimates was shown to be within <5% for a range of starting levels and were similarly convergent. The execution times of this optimisation (<16 min) and forward thermal treatment planning (<22 min) is sufficiently fast to be integrated into the clinical setting. This optimisation-based treatment planning platform for catheter-based ultrasound applicators is a useful tool to provide feedback for applicator selection (sector angle, number of transducer sections along length), positioning (angle or orientation), optimal initial power settings, and has potential to significantly improve the delivery of hyperthermia in conjunction with HDR brachytherapy.""","""['Xin Chen', 'Chris J Diederich', 'Jeffery H Wootton', 'Jean Pouliot', 'I-Chow Hsu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['Implant strategies for endocervical and interstitial ultrasound hyperthermia adjunct to HDR brachytherapy for the treatment of cervical cancer.', 'Endocervical ultrasound applicator for integrated hyperthermia and HDR brachytherapy in the treatment of locally advanced cervical carcinoma.', 'Method for MRI-guided conformal thermal therapy of prostate with planar transurethral ultrasound heating applicators.', 'Catheter-based ultrasound applicators for selective thermal ablation: progress towards MRI-guided applications in prostate.', 'Thermal ablation and high-temperature thermal therapy: overview of technology and clinical implementation.', 'A Novel Framework for the Optimization of Simultaneous ThermoBrachyTherapy.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided Focused Ultrasound in Neurosurgery: Taking Lessons from the Past to Inform the Future.', 'Magnetic resonance-guided interstitial high-intensity focused ultrasound for brain tumor ablation.', 'Theoretical investigation of transgastric and intraductal approaches for ultrasound-based thermal therapy of the pancreas.', 'Thermal therapy of pancreatic tumours using endoluminal ultrasound: Parametric and patient-specific modelling.']"""

Nevis is a small island located in the Eastern Caribbean. We report available data on screening prevalence and cancer mortality for four common cancers: cervical, breast, colon and prostate.  Methods:   Demographic information, screening utilization (when available) and cancer mortality statistics were obtained from the Charlestown Health Clinic and the annual reports from the Ministry of Health. Moreover physicians and key stakeholders were interviewed to assess current guidelines for cancer screening as well as to indicate areas of need.  Results:   Cervical cancer screening is under-utilized in Nevis. Between 2001 and 2007, the overall prevalence of Pap testing fluctuated minutely (mean: 6.87%, range: 6.06-7.41%). Systematic screening for breast, colon, and prostate cancer is not routinely performed, thus utilization rates are not available. Cancer mortality varied slightly between 2002 and 2006; prostate cancer had the highest overall crude mortality rate (30.6 deaths/100,000 persons). Physician interviews revealed that adherence to US and European cancer screening guidelines are inappropriate for their population of patients. Breast and prostate cancers are frequently diagnosed in these geographic areas before the age when cancer screening is currently recommended.

This led us to evaluate the effectiveness of blocking GRPR and of chemotherapy targeted to GRPR in androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC-3) prostate cancer cells, which exhibit different features of disease progression. Thus, we used a cytotoxic BN/GRP analog, AN-215, consisting of 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin (AN-201) linked to BN-like carrier peptide, and a BN/GRP receptor antagonist, RC-3095. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting revealed that mRNA and protein levels for GRPR increased in prostate cancer cells as compared with nonneoplastic RWPE-1 cells. Immunofluorocytochemistry and Western blot assays revealed that AN-215 was the most effective analog decreasing both the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor family members and the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2, which are associated to a poor prognosis.

The cytotoxicity of PE was shown by enhanced LDH release in LNCaP cells. The flow cytometry analysis revealed cell cycle arrests at G(0)/G(1) phase with huge amount of apoptotic LNCaP cells after treatment with PE for 48 h in a dose-responsive manner, which was also confirmed by TUNEL assay. From the results of decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, inactivation of phosphor-Akt, activation of phosphor-p38, phospho-Erk1/phospho-Erk2, the molecular action mechanism of PE to induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells was elucidated.

The presence of this effect makes any biochemical interpretation of the spectra unreliable. Recent theory has shed light on the origins of the 'dispersion artefact' which has been attributed to resonant Mie scattering (RMieS). In this paper a preliminary algorithm for correcting RMieS is presented and evaluated using simulated data. Results show that the 'dispersion artefact' appears to be removed; however, the correction is not perfect. An iterative approach was subsequently implemented whereby the reference spectrum is improved after each iteration, resulting in a more accurate correction. Consequently the corrected spectra become increasingly more representative of the pure absorbance spectra. Using this correction method reliable peak positions can be obtained.""","""['Paul Bassan', 'Achim Kohler', 'Harald Martens', 'Joe Lee', 'Hugh J Byrne', 'Paul Dumas', 'Ehsan Gazi', 'Michael Brown', 'Noel Clarke', 'Peter Gardner']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Mie scatter corrections in single cell infrared microspectroscopy.', 'FTIR microscopy of biological cells and tissue: data analysis using resonant Mie scattering (RMieS) EMSC algorithm.', 'RMieS-EMSC correction for infrared spectra of biological cells: extension using full Mie theory and GPU computing.', ""Resonant Mie scattering in infrared spectroscopy of biological materials--understanding the 'dispersion artefact'."", 'Resonant Mie scattering (RMieS) correction applied to FTIR images of biological tissue samples.', 'Amide I two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy of proteins.', 'A Non-Conventional Platinum Drug against a Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Line.', 'Domes and semi-capsules as model systems for infrared microspectroscopy of biological cells.', 'Evaluation of the Cytotoxic Effect of Pd2Spm against Prostate Cancer through Vibrational Microspectroscopies.', 'Space-resolved chemical information from infrared extinction spectra.', 'Synchrotron Radiation FTIR Microspectroscopy Study of Biomolecular Alterations in Vincristine-Treated WRL68 Cells at the Single-Cell Level.']"""

Transgelin, known as an ARA54-associated AR inhibitor, can suppress AR function in LNCaP cells. In addition to these effects, we aimed to elucidate the proapoptotic effects of the protein on LNCaP and its underlying mechanisms, especially the interaction between transgelin and p53. Cell counting, flow cytometric analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-dUTP nick-end labelling assays were applied to measure the proapoptotic effect of transgelin. Using western blotting of p53 and double immunofluorescence staining of p53 with transgelin, we show that transfection of transgelin results in increasing cytoplasmic translocation of p53 and upregulation of p53 expression. We also found an interaction between transgelin and p53 in vivo by mammalian two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays. The activation of the mitochondria-associated apoptosis pathway was observed in LNCaP cells after transfection with transgelin. These results are indicative of p53-mediated mitochondria-associated apoptotic effects of transgelin on LNCaP cells in addition to its known suppressive effects on the AR pathway.""","""['Zhe-Wei Zhang', 'Zhi-Ming Yang', 'Yi-Chun Zheng', 'Zhao-Dian Chen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Transgelin functions as a suppressor via inhibition of ARA54-enhanced androgen receptor transactivation and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Angiotensin type 2 receptor-mediated apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Emodin induces apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell LNCaP.', 'The Combination of Metformin and Valproic Acid Induces Synergistic Apoptosis in the Presence of p53 and Androgen Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation of apoptosis by a prostate-specific and prostate cancer-associated noncoding gene, PCGEM1.', 'Transgelin promotes ferroptosis to inhibit the malignant progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Mitochondria-actin cytoskeleton crosstalk in cell migration.', 'Bioinformatics analysis reveals the roles of cytoskeleton protein transgelin in occurrence and development of proteinuria.', 'Exercise-induced peptide TAG-23 protects cardiomyocytes from reperfusion injury through regulating PKG-cCbl interaction.', 'Transgelin, a p53 and PTEN-Upregulated Gene, Inhibits the Cell Proliferation and Invasion of Human Bladder Carcinoma Cells in Vitro and in Vivo.']"""

The ethnic origin and family antecedents of prostate cancer are established as risk factors. The genetic factors associated with environmental factors such as the nutrition also play a role in the development of the cancer. Epidemiological studies showed that the Asian populations exhibited an incidence of prostate cancer markedly subordinate by comparison with the Western populations. This would be explained partially by their important consumption of soy. Both main phytoestrogens of soy, the genistein and the daidzein, present anti-proliferative properties.  Methods:   For that purpose, we used different prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU 145, PC-3) and, by flow cytometry, we determined the concentration of phytoestrogens inducing a cell cycle arrest and the required time of incubation.  Results:   Then, the effects of 40microM genistein or 110microM daidzein for 48h were determined and studied on the expression of genes involved in the human cell cycle and angiogenesis and conducted by SYBR green quantitative PCR.

The aim of the present study was to prospectively assess long-term HRQOL 6 years after (125)I prostate brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   A total of 127 patients treated with (125)I brachytherapy for early-stage prostate cancer between December 2000 and June 2003 completed a HRQOL questionnaire at five time-points: before treatment and 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 6 years after treatment.

A change in a score of >/=10 points was considered clinically relevant.  Results:   Overall, the HRQOL at 6 years after (125)I prostate brachytherapy did not significantly differ from baseline. Although a statistically significant deterioration in HRQOL at 6 years was seen for urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, pain, physical functioning, and sexual activity (p <.01), most changes were not clinically relevant.

Methods and materials:   We performed four experiments of varying proton energies, aperture-to-isocenter distances, SOBP widths, and field sizes. Etched track detectors were used to measure the neutron dose equivalent at both an in-field (isocenter, beyond the protons' range) and out-of-field (30 cm lateral to the isocenter) location in air.  Results:   For a nonmodulated beam with all the protons stopping in the aperture and an aperture-to-isocenter distance of 30 cm, the H/D values measured at the isocenter were approximately 0.3 mSv/Gy for all snouts with a 100-MeV beam. The H/D values increased to 10.7, 14.5, and 15.1 mSv/Gy, respectively, for small, medium, and large snouts when the beam energy increased to 250 MeV. At the out-of-field location, H/D values increased from 0.1 to 2.7, 3.0, and 3.2 mSv/Gy, respectively, for small, medium, and large snouts. When the aperture-to-isocenter distance was changed from 10 to 40 cm, the H/D value at the isocenter dropped 70%. The H/D value doubled for the modulated beam relative to the nonmodulated beam. Open apertures reduced the neutrons produced in the nozzle, but increased those produced in the phantom.

Cancer patients who develop autoantibodies to the alpha2M* binding site in GRP78 have a poor prognosis since these antibodies are receptor agonists. The NF-kappaB family of transcription factors induces expression of genes affecting cell growth and differentiation. NF-kappaB1 plays a major regulatory role in controlling innate immunity and inflammation, whereas NF-kappaB2 plays a greater role in cancer cell proliferation. Here we report that treatment of prostate cancer cells with antibody directed against the carboxyl terminal domain of GRP78 inhibits alpha2M*-induced activation of NF-kappaB2 by approximately 50% while exerting a lesser effect of approximately 20% on NF-kappaB1 activation. Treatment of these cells nearly abolished alpha2M*-induced activation of IKKalpha involved in the activation of NF-kappaB2. This antibody also suppressed alpha2M*-induced phosphorylation of IKKalpha, IKKalpha/beta, IkappaBalpha, and IkappaBbeta as well as levels of NIK. Antibody treatment of cancer cells elevated pro-apoptotic p21WAF and p27kip while reducing cyclin D1 levels.

The definition of toxicity is normally regarded as the maximum or peak (P) grade of toxicity reported over the follow-up period. An alternative definition (integrated longitudinal toxicity (ILT)) is proposed which takes into account both the severity and the duration of the complication.  Methods and materials:   In this work, both definitions of toxicity were used to derive dose-volume constraints for six specific endpoints of late rectal toxicity from a cohort of patients who received prostate radiotherapy in the MRC RT01 trial. The dose-volume constraints were derived using ROC analysis for 30, 40, 50, 60, 65 and 70 Gy.  Results:   Statistically significant dose-volume constraints were not derived for all dose levels tested for each endpoint and toxicity definition. However, where both definitions produced constraints, there was generally good agreement. Variation in the derived dose-volume constraints was observed to be larger between endpoints than between the two definitions of toxicity. For one endpoint (stool frequency (LENT/SOM)) statistically significant dose-volume constraints were only derived using ILT.

Key findings:   After stimulation with quercetin, DU-145 cells exhibited stronger sensitization to TRAIL. Quercetin treatment enhanced TRAIL-induced activation proteins in the caspase pathway, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3, and caspase-9. Quercetin dose-dependently increased DR5 levels in prostate cancer cells, which was mediated by increased transcription and protein stability, but not mRNA stability.

Delay was defined as time in months between PB and RP.  Statistical analysis:   delay was analysed as a continuous variable or else categorised according to the median (6 months). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to define variables associated with extracapsular disease. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) was studied using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis.  Results:   Differences between delay groups < or = and > 6 months were significant only with regards to age (p = 0.041), considering both groups as comparable. Differences between groups related to pathological variables were not observed in any case. Mean followup was not significantly different between both groups (p = 0.112). The probability of extracapsular disease varied significantly depending on PSA, biopsy Gleason score and the percentage of positive cores, while multivariate analysis found no relationship with delay.

Treatment of methylated cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored TFF expression in cell lines not expressing TFF and increased expression significantly in low-expressing cell lines. In clinical samples, methylation of the promoter/enhancer regions of TFF1 and TFF3 was significantly lower in PC compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia. The present study shows an inverse relation between promoter methylation and expression of trefoil factors.

There is a strong need for novel agents in the treatment and prevention of HRPC. We have shown that flavokawain B (FKB), a kava chalcone, is about 4- to 12-fold more effective in reducing the cell viabilities of androgen receptor (AR)-negative, HRPC cell lines DU145 and PC-3 than AR-positive, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines LAPC4 and LNCaP, with minimal effect on normal prostatic epithelial and stromal cells. FKB induces apoptosis with an associated increased expression of proapoptotic proteins: death receptor-5, Bim and Puma and a decreased expression of inhibitors of apoptosis protein: XIAP and survivin. Among them, Bim expression was significantly induced by FKB as early as 4 hr of the treatment. Knockdown of Bim expression by short-hairpin RNAs attenuates the inhibitory effect on anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and caspase cleavages induced by FKB. These findings suggest that the effect of FKB, at least in part, requires Bim expression. In addition, FKB synergizes with TRAIL for markedly enhanced induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, FKB treatment of mice bearing DU145 xenograft tumors results in tumor growth inhibition and increases Bim expression in tumor tissues.

We reported previously that dominant-negative mutants of one of the telomeric proteins called TIN2 cause death of androgen receptor (AR)-negative but not AR-positive prostate cancer cells, raising the question of a possible role of AR in the structural stability of telomeric complexes. Consistent with this possibility, in the present study, we observed that the AR antagonist Casodex (bicalutamide) disrupted telomeric complexes in AR-positive LNCaP cells but not in AR-negative PC-3 cells. Immunofluorescent studies revealed colocalization of TIN2 and AR. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation studies showed association of AR with telomeric proteins. Furthermore, telomeric proteins were overexpressed in prostate cancer cells compared with normal prostate epithelial cells, and sucrose density gradient analysis showed co-sedimentation of AR with telomeric proteins in a shelterin-like mega complex. Together, these observations suggest an allosteric role of AR in telomere complex stability in prostate cancer cells and suggest that AR-antagonist Casodex-mediated cell death may be due to telomere complex disruption.""","""['Sahn-Ho Kim', 'Michelle Richardson', 'Kannagi Chinnakannu', 'V Uma Bai', 'Mani Menon', 'Evelyn R Barrack', 'G Prem-Veer Reddy']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Structural and functional association of androgen receptor with telomeres in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of androgen receptor-mediated transcription by RPB5 binding protein URI/RMP.', 'Prohibitin and the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit BRG1 are required for effective androgen antagonist-mediated transcriptional repression of androgen receptor-regulated genes.', 'Shelterin proteins and cancer.', 'Research progress on telomere binding proteins.', 'Saracatinib synergizes with enzalutamide to downregulate AR activity in CRPC.', 'Hormonal regulation of telomerase activity and hTERT expression in steroid-regulated tissues and cancer.', 'Prognostic value of TERF1 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Antithetic hTERT Regulation by Androgens in Prostate Cancer Cells: hTERT Inhibition Is Mediated by the ING1 and ING2 Tumor Suppressors.', 'Association between melanoma and exposure to sex hormones in puberty: A possible window of susceptibility (Review).']"""

Cells set in motion either repair mechanisms or programmed cell death pathways, depending on the extent of the damage and on their ability to withstand it. The RNA-binding protein (RBP) Sam68, which is up-regulated in prostate carcinoma, promotes prostate cancer cell survival to genotoxic stress. Herein, we have investigated the function of Sam68 in this cellular response. Mitoxantrone (MTX), a topoisomerase II inhibitor, induced relocalization of Sam68 from the nucleoplasm to nuclear granules, together with several other RBPs involved in alternative splicing, such as TIA-1, hnRNP A1 and the SR proteins SC35 and ASF/SF2. Sam68 accumulation in nuclear stress granules was independent of signal transduction pathways activated by DNA damage. Using BrU labelling and immunofluorescence, we demonstrate that MTX-induced nuclear stress granules are transcriptionally active foci where Sam68 and the phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II accumulate. Finally, we show that MTX-induced relocalization of Sam68 correlates with changes in alternative splicing of its mRNA target CD44, and that MTX-induced CD44 splicing depends on Sam68 expression. These results strongly suggest that Sam68 is part of a RNA-mediated stress response of the cell that modulates alternative splicing in response to DNA damage.""","""['Roberta Busà', 'Raffaele Geremia', 'Claudio Sette']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['The transcriptional co-activator SND1 is a novel regulator of alternative splicing in prostate cancer cells.', 'The RNA-binding and adaptor protein Sam68 modulates signal-dependent splicing and transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor.', 'Proteomic identification of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L as a novel component of SLM/Sam68 Nuclear Bodies.', 'Role of Sam68 in post-transcriptional gene regulation.', 'The RNA-binding protein Sam68 is a multifunctional player in human cancer.', 'DNA Damage Regulates the Functions of the RNA Binding Protein Sam68 through ATM-Dependent Phosphorylation.', 'pncCCND1_B Engages an Inhibitory Protein Network to Downregulate CCND1 Expression upon DNA Damage.', 'Effective targeting of breast cancer stem cells by combined inhibition of Sam68 and Rad51.', 'Stress Granules in the Anti-Cancer Medications Mechanism of Action: A Systematic Scoping Review.', 'Coordination of RNA Processing Regulation by Signal Transduction Pathways.']"""

The significance of FPM after radical prostatectomy is unclear. The implication is that FPM are surgically induced, may not represent true tumor extension beyond the prostate, and thus would not affect disease-free survival (DFS).  Methods:   Data were retrospectively reviewed from 2468 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between January 1996 and October 2008. The DFS probabilities were compared among different margin statuses (negative [NM], FPM, and extensively positive [EPM]) with the log-rank test. FPM was defined as less than/equal to 3 mm. EPM was greater than 3 mm. A multivariate Cox analysis was performed to evaluate the significance of FPM in patients with prostate cancer.  Results:   Of all patients, 2022 (82%) had NM, 344 (14%) had FPM, and 99 (4%) had EPM. Of the 1997 patients with pT2 disease, 1716 (86%) had NM, 229 (11.5%) had FPM, and 52 (2.6%) had EPM. The 10-year DFS for all patients was 84%, 64%, 38% for NM, FPM, and EPM, respectively (P < .0001). The 10-year DFS for organ-confined disease was 90%, 76%, and 53% for NM, FPM, and EPM, respectively (P < .0001). The risk of biochemical recurrence for all patients increases with worsening margin status. Margin status affects biochemical recurrence and depends on the Gleason grade on surgical pathology for all patients (P = .0005) and patients with pT2 disease (P = .0233).

Methods:   A total of 83 patients with localized prostate cancer, who received ADT, were prospectively studied on the basis of their blood samples at the baseline and after ADT for 6 months.  Results:   Before ADT, the IGF-1 level was correlated with the red blood cell (RBC) count (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis [rs]=0.315, P=.011), hemoglobin (rs=0.278, P=.018), and mean corpuscular volume (rs=0.266, P=.020), but such relationships disappeared after ADT. After ADT, the serum IGF-1 level increased compared with that at the baseline (21+/-6 vs 18+/-5 nmol/L, respectively, P<.001), but no change was observed in the serum GH level (P=.691).

Objectives:   This study was conducted to meet Korean and US regulatory requirements for the marketing of the generic 50-mg tablet formulation of bicalutamide. To this end, the pharmacokinetic properties of the new (test) formulation were compared with those of the currently marketed (reference) formulation. Tolerability was also evaluated.  Methods:   An open-label, randomized-sequence, single-dose, 2-period crossover study was conducted in healthy Korean male volunteers. Subjects received either the test or reference formulation of bicalutamide 50-mg tablets in the first period and crossed over to the alternative formulation in the second period. Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken over 672 hours after dosing. Plasma concentrations of bicalutamide were measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including AUC(0-672h), were determined by noncompartmental analysis. Log-transformed C(max) and AUC(0-672h) for the 2 formulations were compared. Tolerability was monitored based on laboratory tests, ECGs, vital signs, and physical examinations.  Results:   Of the 34 subjects initially enrolled, 33 completed the study. The mean (SD) age, height, and weight of participants were 25.8 (4.1) years, 173.6 (5.7) cm, and 68.9 (7.8) kg, respectively. The median T(max) was 36.0 hours for both formulations. The mean (SD) t(1/2), C(max), and AUC(0-672h) for the reference formulation were 135.4 (28.6) hours, 933.2 (169.2) microg/L, and 215,680.1 (48,753.4) microg x h/L, respectively. Corresponding values for the test formulation were 134.3 (30.7) hours, 946.7 (179.9) microg/L, and 221,708.8 (54,935.1) microg x h/L. The 90% CIs for the mean ratios (test/reference) of log-transformed C(max) and AUC(0-672h) were 0.97 to 1.06 and 0.98 to 1.07, respectively.

Official Cuban sources were used to calculate years of potential life lost (YPLL) due to mortality (based on life expectancy) and morbidity (based on the incidence, average duration, and severity of the disease), as well as years of potential life lost per death (YPLL/D) and the disability-adjusted life years (DALY), for each cancer type and location, by sex and age group.  Results:   The locations with higher YPLL were also those with the greatest total burden: lung, breast, prostate, colon and rectum, and cervix, and showed an upward trend for all cancer types and locations, except leukemia. The morbidity-related YPLL were concentrated in: breast, lung, prostate, colon and rectum, and cervix. In men, the highest mortality-related YPLL values were in the oral cavity and oropharynx, esophagus, stomach, lung, bladder, melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia; women were more affected by cancer of the colon and rectum.

Long term PRD observance and tolerance were assessed. Cancer specific survival was studied in function of PRD and time of PRD initiation.  Methods:   Twenty-six volunteers, age: 68+/-10 years with metastatic HRPC accepted a polyamine reduced diet and partial gut decontamination with oral neomycin or nifuroxazide (750 mg daily, one week out of two). Time from HRPC to PRD initiation was 10+/-8 months. WHO performance status, EORTC pain scale, body weight, blood counts and serum proteins were regularly assessed. Sixteen other HRPC patients eating a normal diet served as ""controls"".  Results:   Mean diet observance is 25+/-24 months. Tolerance is good. WHO performance status and EORTC pain scales were significantly improved respectively at 3 months (0.5+/-0.7 vs 0.7+/-0.9: p=0.03) and 6 months (0.5+/-0.8 vs 1+/-1.3, p=0.02) compared to initial values. Median cancer specific survival times after HRPC and PRD initiation are respectively 36 and 21 months. Eleven PRD patients started the diet before a 9 months cut-off period (after HRPC) and 15 patients after. Median cancer specific survival times for these two groups of patients are respectively 44 and 34 months, p=0.014. Median cancer specific survival times (after HRPC) for PRD patients compared to controls are 36 vs 17 months (p=0.004).  Conclusions:   Polyamine-reduced diet is well observed and tolerated. It seems to improve and/or maintain quality of life for HRPC patients. Early PRD initiation in HRPC is promising and may impact favorably cancer specific survival.

In prostate cancer, LN-positive diagnosis during pelvic LN dissection (PLND) potentially leads to the abandonment of radical prostatectomy (RP).  Objective:   To compare the overall survival (OS) and relative survival (RS; as an estimate for cancer-specific survival) in LN-positive patients with or without RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 1988 and 2007, a total of 35 629 men with prostate cancer were identified at the Munich Cancer Registry; of those, 1413 patients had positive LNs.  Intervention:   Of these 1413 LN-positive patients, prostatectomy was abandoned in 456 LN-positive patients, whereas 957 underwent RP despite the LN-positive finding.  Measurements:   Crucial analyses are based on 938 LN-positive patients (688 with RP and 250 without RP) with complete data regarding age, grade, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). OS (Kaplan-Meier estimates) and RS are presented, and Cox regression analysis was used to show the influence of predictors such as clinical stage, age at surgery, number of positive LNs, PSA level, grade, and extent of surgery.  Results:   Median follow-up was 5.6 yr. OS of patients at 5 yr and 10 yr was 84% and 64%, respectively, with RP and was 60% and 28%, respectively, with aborted RP. The RS of patients at 5 yr and 10 yr was 95% and 86%, respectively, with RP and was 70% and 40%, respectively, with abandoned surgery. There was an imbalance, however, in the number of positive LNs: 17.2% with RP had four or more positive nodes versus 28% in the patient group without RP. In the multivariate model, RP was a strong independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio: 2.04 [95% confidence interval, 1.59-2.63; p<0.0001]).  Conclusion:   LN-positive patients with complete RP had improved survival compared to patients with abandoned RP.

However, investment costs are much higher. This study provides an estimation and comparison of the costs of these therapies.  Methods:   Within an extensive analytical framework capital and operational costs, cost per fraction, and four tumor specific treatment costs are calculated for three facilities: combined carbon-ion/proton, proton-only, and photon.  Results:   Capital costs for the combined, proton-only and photon facilities are: euro 138.6 million, euro 94.9 million, euro 23.4 million. Total costs per year are: euro 36.7 million, euro 24.9 million, euro 9.6 million. Cost per fraction is: euro 1128 (euro 877-1974), euro 743 (euro 578-1300), euro 233 (euro 190-407). Cost ratio particle/photon therapy is 4.8 for the combined and 3.2 for the proton-only facility. Particle treatment costs vary from euro 10,030 (c-ion: lung cancer) to euro 39,610 (proton: head & neck tumors). Cost difference between particle and photon therapies is relatively small for lung and prostate cancer, larger for skull-base chordoma and head & neck tumors.  Conclusion:   Investment costs are highest for the combined carbon-ion/proton facility and lowest for the photon facility. Cost differences become smaller when total costs per year and specific treatment costs are compared. Lower fractionation schedule of particle therapy might further reduce its costs.""","""['Andrea Peeters', 'Janneke P C Grutters', 'Madelon Pijls-Johannesma', 'Stefan Reimoser', 'Dirk De Ruysscher', 'Johan L Severens', 'Manuela A Joore', 'Philippe Lambin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Particle radiation therapy using proton and heavier ion beams.', 'On the cost-effectiveness of Carbon ion radiation therapy for skull base chordoma.', 'Comparison of carbon ions versus protons.', 'The cost-effectiveness of particle therapy in non-small cell lung cancer: exploring decision uncertainty and areas for future research.', 'Assessment of early toxicity and response in patients treated with proton and carbon ion therapy at the Heidelberg ion therapy center using the raster scanning technique.', 'Health Economic Evaluation of Proton Therapy for Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Costs of Newly Funded Proton Therapy Using Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing in The Netherlands.', 'Particle beam therapy for nasopharyngeal cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Health Care Resource Utilization for Esophageal Cancer Using Proton versus Photon Radiation Therapy.', 'Inequality in Accessibility of Proton Therapy for Cancers and Its Economic Determinants: A Cross-Sectional Study.']"""

While some data indicate high bother from erectile dysfunction (ED) following prostate cancer treatments, other results suggest the life-saving nature of the treatment may mitigate ED concern.  Aim:   (i) To determine if sexual bother increases post radical prostatectomy (RP); (ii) To determine if men psychologically adjust to diminished erections; (iii) To identify baseline predictors of post-RP sexual bother.  Methods:   We identified 183 men treated with RP who completed inventories including Erectile Function Domain (EFD) and Sexual Bother (SB) preoperatively and at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Statistical analyses included repeated-measures analysis of variance and linear multiple regression.  Main outcome measures:   The EFD of the International Index of Erectile Function and the SB subscale from the Prostate-Health Related Quality-of-Life Questionnaire.  Results:   The mean age of the sample was 58 +/- 7 years. The mean EFD scores decreased from baseline to the 24-month time point (24.8 vs. 16.7, P < 0.01). The mean SB scores increased from baseline to the 12 month time point (4.3 vs. 6.7, P < 0.01), and remained stable from the 12 month to 24 month time points (6.7 vs. 6.3, P = not significant [ns]). This was true for men with ED (EFD < 24) and without ED. Only 7% of men with ED moved from being ""bothered"" at 12 months to ""no bother"" at 24 months. There were no significant baseline predictors of sexual bother; baseline variables tested were: age, race, marital status, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, EFD, sexual desire, and intercourse satisfaction. The change in EFD scores was the only significant predictor of SB scores.  Conclusions:   Sexual bother increases post-RP, even in men with ""good"" erections postoperatively, and includes shame, embarrassment, and a reduction in general life happiness. Because men do not seem to ""adjust"" to ED, referral or evaluation should occur early in this population.""","""['Christian J Nelson', 'Serkan Deveci', 'Jason Stasi', 'Peter T Scardino', 'John P Mulhall']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Decrease in Intercourse Satisfaction in Men Who Recover Erections After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Exploring the Optimal Erectile Function Domain Score Cutoff That Defines Sexual Satisfaction After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Can sexual bother after radical prostatectomy be predicted preoperatively?

However, the protective effect has been observed from few prospective studies. This study investigated the association of citrus consumption with cancer incidence among 42,470 Japanese adults in the Ohsaki National Health Insurance Cohort, which covered an age range of 40-79 years, and was followed up from 1995 to 2003 for all-cancer and individual cancer incidence. Citrus consumption was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs. During the 323,204 person-years of follow-up, 3,398 cases were identified totally. Citrus consumption, especially daily consumption, was correlated with reduced all-cancer incidence, the RRs were 0.89 (95% CI = 0.80-0.98) for total participants, 0.86 (0.76-0.98) for males and 0.93 (0.79-1.09) for females, as well as multiple cancers at individual sites, especially pancreatic (RR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.38-1.00) and prostate cancer (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.41-0.97).

The study objective was to evaluate the potential clinical significance and natural history of different disease categories by combining ERG/ETV1 gene rearrangements and PTEN gene loss status.  Methods:   We utilised fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) assays to detect PTEN gene loss and ERG/ETV1 gene rearrangements in 308 conservatively managed PCa patients with survival outcome data.  Results:   ERG/ETV1 gene rearrangements alone and PTEN gene loss alone both failed to show a link to survival in multivariate analyses. However, there was a strong interaction between ERG/ETV1 gene rearrangements and PTEN gene loss (P<0.001). The largest subgroup of patients (54%), lacking both PTEN gene loss and ERG/ETV1 gene rearrangements comprised a 'good prognosis' population exhibiting favourable cancer-specific survival (85.5% alive at 11 years). The presence of PTEN gene loss in the absence of ERG/ETV1 gene rearrangements identified a patient population (6%) with poorer cancer-specific survival that was highly significant (HR=4.87, P<0.001 in multivariate analysis, 13.7% survival at 11 years) when compared with the 'good prognosis' group. ERG/ETV1 gene rearrangements and PTEN gene loss status should now prospectively be incorporated into a predictive model to establish whether predictive performance is improved.

In this study, we examined the effects of small-molecule inhibitors of class IA PI3Ks to explore the contributions of different isoforms in cancer cells. Similar responses were seen in cancer cells with wild-type or activated mutant PI3K genes treated with p110alpha/delta or p110alpha/beta/delta inhibitors in cell viability assays. In contrast, PTEN-negative cell lines tended to be less responsive (4-fold overall) to an inhibitor of p110alpha/delta versus p110alpha/beta/delta. Combining a p110alpha/delta inhibitor with a p110beta inhibitor resulted in comparable potency to the p110alpha/beta/delta inhibitor. The disparity in efficacy was confirmed in vivo. Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis revealed that an inhibitor with insufficient potency against the p110beta isoform was less effective at inhibiting the PI3K pathway in PTEN-negative tumor xenografts.

TRPV2 transcript levels were higher in patients with metastatic cancer (stage M1) compared with primary solid tumors (stages T2a and T2b). Previous studies of the TRPV2 channel indicated that it is primarily involved in cancer cell migration and not in cell growth. Introducing TRPV2 into androgen-dependent LNCaP cells enhanced cell migration along with expression of invasion markers matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and cathepsin B. Consistent with the likelihood that TRPV2 may affect cancer cell aggressiveness by influencing basal intracellular calcium levels, small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of TRPV2 reduced the growth and invasive properties of PC3 prostate tumors established in nude mice xenografts, and diminished expression of invasive enzymes MMP2, MMP9, and cathepsin B.

However, an antibiotic brefeldin A (BFA) has been shown to exhibit the growth inhibitory effect on human cancer cells. We thus investigated if BFA might inhibit proliferation of androgen-responsive prostate cancer LNCaP cells and also explored how it would be carried out, focusing on cell cycle and androgen receptor (AR).  Methods:   Androgen-mediated cellular events in LNCaP cells were induced using 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as an androgenic mediator. Effects of BFA on non-DHT-stimulated or DHT-stimulated cell growth were assessed. Its growth inhibitory mechanism(s) was further explored; performing cell cycle analysis on a flow cytometer, assessing AR activity by AR binding assay, and analyzing AR protein expression using Western blot analysis.  Results:   DHT (1 nM) was capable of stimulating LNCaP cell growth by ~40% greater than non-stimulated controls, whereas BFA (30 ng/ml) completely inhibited such DHT-stimulated proliferation. Cell cycle analysis showed that this BFA-induced growth inhibition was associated with a ~75% reduction in the cell number in the S phase and a concomitant increase in the G1 cell number, indicating a G1 cell cycle arrest. This was further confirmed by the modulations of specific cell cycle regulators (CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1, and p21WAF1), revealed by Western blots. In addition, the growth inhibition induced by BFA was accompanied by a profound (~90%) loss in AR activity, which would be presumably attributed to the significantly reduced cellular AR protein level.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that BFA has a potent growth inhibitory activity, capable of completely inhibiting DHT (androgen)-stimulated LNCaP proliferation. Such inhibitory action of BFA appears to target cell cycle and AR: BFA led to a G1 cell cycle arrest and the down-regulation of AR activity/expression, possibly accounting for its primary growth inhibitory mechanism. Thus, it is conceivable that BFA may provide a more effective therapeutic modality for patients with hormone-dependent prostate cancer.""","""['Srinivas Rajamahanty', 'Catherine Alonzo', 'Shahrad Aynehchi', 'Muhammad Choudhury', 'Sensuke Konno']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biomed Sci""","""['Attenuation of androgenic regulation by brefeldin A in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells.', 'Involvement of p27Kip1 in G1 arrest by high dose 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Progression of LNCaP prostate tumor cells during androgen deprivation: hormone-independent growth, repression of proliferation by androgen, and role for p27Kip1 in androgen-induced cell cycle arrest.', 'DNA licensing as a novel androgen receptor mediated therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'Prevalence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Men and the Contribution of Androgen and its Receptor in Pathogenesis and Therapy.', 'In-silico activity prediction and docking studies of some flavonol derivatives as anti-prostate cancer agents based on Monte Carlo optimization.', 'Gene expression based inference of cancer drug sensitivity.', 'The Role of Imaging Biomarkers to Guide Pharmacological Interventions Targeting Tumor Hypoxia.', 'The DNA/RNA helicase DHX9 contributes to the transcriptional program of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Golgi reassembly and stacking protein 65 downregulation is required for the anti-cancer effect of dihydromyricetin on human ovarian cancer cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   From 2004 to 2007, at our institution, 95 men had RCP for invasive bladder cancer. We reviewed their clinicopathological variables, especially apical involvement, and the course of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels before and after surgery. We compared clinically significant and insignificant prostate cancers.  Results:   Of the 95 patients, 26 had incidental prostate cancer (mean age 68 years, range 53-80) on definitive histological examination. The mean (sd, range) preoperative PSA level in all 26 men was 3.6 (0.8, 0.2-14) ng/mL, but six of the 26 patients had preoperative PSA levels of >4 ng/mL and one other had suspicious findings on a digital rectal examination. Involvement of the apex was histologically confirmed in seven of the 26 patients (27%), including four with significant prostate cancer (P = 0.039). Preoperative PSA levels did not differ significantly between the seven patients with significant and 19 with insignificant prostate cancer, but seven patients with apical involvement had significantly higher PSA levels before RCP than the 19 who did not (P < 0.04). PSA levels after RCP remained below the limit of detection in all patients over a mean (range) follow-up 14.3 (3-32) months.  Conclusion:   In our series, preserving the apex of the prostate to decrease morbidity after RCP carried a 7.3% risk (seven of 95 patients) of leaving significant cancer in the residual prostatic tissue.

Protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme, gets overexpressed in prostate cancer and results in a resistance to chemotherapy. Telomerase, a reverse transcriptase, is highly activated in prostate cancer cells. Both of these enzymes can be considered as potential molecular markers for prostate cancer. The present study investigates the effects of natural isothiocyanate phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) in modulating the activities of PKC and telomerase in the androgen-independent human prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cell line. We observed that PEITC downregulated the antiapoptotic isoforms (PKC alpha and epsilon) efficiently and zeta moderately. Basal level of PKC delta, a proapoptotic form, was very poor and its modulation was not significant. PEITC also inhibited the activity of telomerase. Studies were conducted to measure the degree of apoptotic cell death induced either by PEITC alone or in combination with adriamycin or etoposide. Apoptosis was evident from the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, apoptotic index, and by the induction of caspases 3 and 8. PEITC exhibited remarkable efficacy in sensitizing PC-3 cells to undergo cell death by adriamycin and etoposide, which might prove to be of considerable value in synergistic therapy of cancer.""","""['Sutapa Mukherjee', 'Rathindra Kumar Bhattacharya', 'Madhumita Roy']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol""","""['Isothiocyanates sensitize the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs via modulation of protein kinase C and telomerase in cervical cancer cells.', 'Phenethyl isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis in p53-deficient PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases.', 'Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) promotes G2/M phase arrest via p53 expression and induces apoptosis through caspase- and mitochondria-dependent signaling pathways in human prostate cancer DU 145 cells.', 'Advances in molecular signaling mechanisms of β-phenethyl isothiocyanate antitumor effects.', 'Prostate cancer chemopreventive activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate through epigenetic regulation (review).', 'Co-administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with rottlerin in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Synergistic Interaction between 5-FU and an Analog of Sulforaphane-2-Oxohexyl Isothiocyanate-In an In Vitro Colon Cancer Model.', 'Phenethyl Isothiocyanate Suppresses Stemness in the Chemo- and Radio-Resistant Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Line MDA-MB-231/IR Via Downregulation of Metadherin.', 'Histone Methyltransferase Setd7 Regulates Nrf2 Signaling Pathway by Phenethyl Isothiocyanate and Ursolic Acid in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Dietary Phenethyl Isothiocyanate Protects Mice from Colitis Associated Colon Cancer.']"""

We, therefore, compared the growth potential of stem cells in 3D culture (where the conditions would favor a quiescent state) with monolayer culture that has previously been demonstrated to induce PSC division. We found a fundamental difference between cultures of primary, adult PSCs grown as monolayers compared to those grown as spheres. The first supported the expansion and maintenance of PSCs from single cells while the latter did not. In an attempt to determine the mechanisms governing stem cell control, several known stem cell activators (including IFNalpha, FGF2, anti-TGFbeta, and dihydrotestosterone) were studied. However, cell division was not observed. CD133+ cells derived from a prostate cell line did not grow as spheres from single cells but did grow from aggregates. We conclude that PSCs can be expanded and maintained in monolayer culture from single cells, but that PSCs are growth quiescent when grown as spheres. It is likely that the physical arrangement of cells in monolayer provides an injury-type response, which can activate stem cells into cycle.""","""['Shona H Lang', 'Elizabeth Anderson', 'Robert Fordham', 'Anne T Collins']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Stem Cells Dev""","""['The characterization of epithelial and stromal subsets of candidate stem/progenitor cells in the human adult prostate.', 'Kinetics of quiescent cord blood stem/progenitor cells with high proliferative potential in stem-cell expansion culture.', 'Editorial comment on: The characterization of epithelial and stromal subsets of candidate stem/progenitor cells in the human adult prostate.', 'An update on niche composition, signaling and functional regulation of the adipose-derived stem cells.', 'Exploring the origins of the normal prostate and prostate cancer stem cell.', 'Induction of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein by miR-200c-3p restores sensitivity to anti-androgen therapy in androgen-refractory prostate cancer and inhibits the cancer progression via down-regulation of integrin α3β4.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: The Role of CD133.', 'Keratin Profiling by Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Identifies Human Prostate Stem Cell Lineage Hierarchy and Cancer Stem-Like Cells.', 'A systematic review of the asymmetric inheritance of cellular organelles in eukaryotes: A critique of basic science validity and imprecision.', 'Are Adipose-Derived Stem Cells From Liver Falciform Ligaments Another Possible Source of Mesenchymal Stem Cells?']"""

Metastases of gastric carcinoma to the optic nerve are less frequently, and those of prostatic carcinoma very infrequently observed. A 66-year-old man presented with metastasis to the optic nerve with consequential vision loss to the level of light perception developed two years after prostatic surgery. Systemic therapy with methylprednisolone resulted in a satisfactory vision function recovery. According to literature data, prostatic carcinoma metastases to the optic nerve occur very rarely. In our patient with the optic nerve infiltration found on the first clinical examination, papillary edema was associated with the signs of optic nerve functional impairment (visual acuity, visual field, unilateral RAPD). An infiltrative process involving a distal portion of the optic nerve usually does not cause papillary alterations, and produces a clinical picture of retrobulbar optic neuropathy, such as that observed in our patient on the second clinical examination, showing the signs of optic nerve damage.""","""['Branimir Cerovski', 'Tomislav Vidović', 'Neda Stiglmayer', 'Smiljka Popović Suić']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""Coll Antropol""","""['Optic disc metastasis from pulmonary adenocarcinoma.', 'Bilateral ischemic optic neuropathy after transurethral prostatic resection: a case report.', 'Blindness from multiple cerebral gliomas mimicking metastatic brain disease.', 'Metastatic and paraneoplastic lesions of the optic nerve.', 'Iatrogenic pathology of the optic nerve.', 'Histological heterogeneity between primary and metastatic cancer in a pathologic confirmed case of isolated optic disc metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma.']"""
