Objective:   To examine relationships between perceived risk of cancer and behaviors during decision making for 3 screening tests.  Design:   Cross-sectional survey conducted between November 2006 and May 2007.  Setting:   Nationwide random-digit dial telephone survey.  Participants:   A total of 1729 English-speaking US adults aged 40 y and older who reported making a cancer screening decision (about breast, colon, or prostate tests) in the previous 2 y.  Measurements:   Participants completed measures of perceived risk, information seeking, and shared decision-making tendencies.  Results:   As perceived risk for cancer increased, patients were more likely to seek information about screening on their own (e.g., 35% of participants who perceived a high risk of cancer searched the Internet compared with 18% for those who perceived a low risk, P < 0.001) and in interactions with their physicians. As perceived risk increased, patients were also more likely to consult with more than 1 provider. Gender moderated the shared decision-making preference such that men with high perceived risks were more likely than women with high perceived risks to report they would have preferred more involvement in the decision (35% v. 9%, P = 0.001).  Limitations:   Cross-sectional data limit causal inferences.  Conclusions:   Higher perceived risk was associated with greater patient participation, as shown by more information seeking and greater desire for decisional involvement (moderated by gender). The results suggest that perceived risk of cancer could influence patient behavior when deciding about screening.""","""['Amanda J Dillard', 'Mick P Couper', 'Brian J Zikmund-Fisher']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""[""Deficits and variations in patients' experience with making 9 common medical decisions: the DECISIONS survey."", ""Patients' knowledge about 9 common health conditions: the DECISIONS survey."", ""Effects of media information on cancer patients' opinions, feelings, decision-making process and physician-patient communication."", 'Adherence and decision AIDS: a model and a narrative review.', ""The extent of patients' understanding of the risk of treatments."", 'Breast Cancer Screening and Perceptions of Harm among Young Adults in Japan: Results of a Cross-Sectional Online Survey.', 'Knowledge, attitudes, and practices on camel respiratory diseases and conditions in Garissa and Isiolo, Kenya.', 'Effect of Perceived Self-Vulnerability on Prostate Cancer Screening Uptake and Associated Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study of Public Health Facilities in Western Kenya.', 'The impact of coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on education: The role of virtual and remote laboratories in education.', 'Appraising risk in active surveillance of localized prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To identify deficits and variations in the patient experience of making common medical decisions about initiation of prescription medications for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or depression; screening tests for colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer; and surgeries for knee or hip replacement, cataracts, or lower back pain, as well as to identify factors associated with patient confidence in the decisions.  Setting:   National sample of US adults identified by random-digit dialing.  Design:   Cross-sectional survey conducted from November 2006 to May 2007.  Participants:   Included 2473 English-speaking adults age 40 and older who reported undertaking 1 or more of the above 9 medical actions or discussing doing so with a health care provider within the past 2 years.  Measurements:   Patients reported who initiated discussions and made the final decisions, how much discussion of pros and cons occurred, whether they were asked about their preferences, and their confidence that the decision ""was the right one.""  Results:   The proportion of patient-driven decisions varied significantly across decisions (range: blood pressure: 16% to knee/hip replacement: 48%). Most patients (78%-85%) reported that providers made a recommendation, and such recommendations generally favored taking medical action. Fewer patients reported that providers asked them about their preferences (range: colon cancer screening: 34% to knee/hip replacement: 80%) or discussed reasons not to take action (range: breast cancer screening: 20% to lower back surgery: 80%). Decision confidence was higher among patients who reported primarily making the decision themselves (odds ratio [OR] = 14.6, P < 0.001) or having been asked for their preference (OR = 1.32, P < 0.01) and was lower among patients whose patient-provider discussions included cons (OR = 0.74, P = 0.008).  Limitations:   Recall biases may affect patients' memories of their decision-making processes.  Conclusions:   DECISIONS participants reported wide variations in the proportion of discussions that included a conversation about reasons not to take action or a conversation about patients' preferences about what they would like to do. These factors appear directly related to patients' confidence that the decision was ""right.""""","""['Brian J Zikmund-Fisher', 'Mick P Couper', 'Eleanor Singer', 'Peter A Ubel', 'Sonja Ziniel', 'Floyd J Fowler Jr', 'Carrie A Levin', 'Angela Fagerlin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['How does feeling informed relate to being informed?

Objectives:   To evaluate the extent of informed decision making in patient-provider discussions for colorectal (CRC), breast (BrCa), and prostate (PCa) cancer screening.  Setting:   National sample of US adults identified by random-digit dialing.  Design:   Cross-sectional survey conducted between November 2006 and May 2007.  Participants:   English-speaking US adults aged 50 y and older who had discussed cancer screening with a health care provider within the previous 2 y.  Measurements:   Cancer screening survey modules that asked about demographic characteristics, cancer knowledge, the importance of various sources of information, and self-reported cancer screening decision-making processes.  Results:   Overall, 1082 participants completed 1 or more of the 3 cancer modules. Although participants generally considered themselves well informed about screening tests, half or more could not correctly answer even 1 open-ended knowledge question for any given module. Participants consistently overestimated risks for being diagnosed with and dying from each cancer and overestimated the positive predictive values of prostate-specific antigen tests and mammography. Providers were the most highly rated information source, usually initiated screening discussions (64%-84%), and often recommended screening (73%-90%). However, participants reported that providers elicited their screening preferences in only 31% (CRC women) to 57% (PCa) of discussions. Although more than 90% of the discussions addressed the pros of screening, only 19% (BrCa) to 30% (PCa) addressed the cons of screening.  Limitations:   Recall bias is possible because screening process reports were not independently validated.

Objective:   To determine adults' knowledge about information relevant to common types of medication, screening, or surgery decisions they recently made.  Setting:   National sample of US adults identified by random-digit dialing.  Design:   Cross-sectional survey conducted between November 2006 and May 2007.  Participants:   A total of 2575 English-speaking adults aged 40 y or older who reported having discussed the following medical decisions with a health care provider within the previous 2 y: prescription medications for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or depression; screening tests for colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer; or surgeries for knee/hip replacement, cataracts, or lower back pain.  Measurements:   Participants answered knowledge questions and rated the importance of their health care provider, family/friends, and the media as sources of information.  Results:   Accuracy rates varied widely across questions and decision contexts. For example, patients considering cataract surgery were more likely to correctly estimate recovery time than those patients considering lower back pain or knee/hip replacement (78% v. 29% and 39%, P < 0.001). Similarly, participants were more knowledgeable of facts about colorectal cancer screening than those who were asked about breast or prostate cancer. Finally, respondents were consistently more knowledgeable on comparable questions about blood pressure medication than cholesterol medication or antidepressants. The impact of demographic characteristics and sources of information also varied substantially. For example, blacks had lower knowledge than whites about cancer screening decisions (odds ratio [OR] = 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.43, 0.75; P = 0.001) and medication (OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.60, 0.97; P = 0.03) even after we controlled for other demographic factors. The same was not true for surgical decisions.  Limitations:   The questions did not measure all knowledge relevant to informed decision making, were subject to recall biases, and may have assessed numeracy more than knowledge.

Methods:   Patients with clinical T2b-T3bN0M0 disease (according to 1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] criteria) received radiation plus 2 transrectal ultrasound hyperthermia treatments. After the first 4 patients, 6 months of androgen suppression were allowed. The study was designed to assess absolute improvement in the 2-year disease-free survival rate compared with the short-term androgen suppression arm in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) study 92-02.  Results:   Thirty-seven patients received a total of 72 hyperthermia treatments. The mean cumulative equivalent minutes (CEM) T₉₀ 43°C was 8.4 minutes. According to the 1992 AJCC classification, there were 19 patients with T2b tumors, 8 patients with T2c tumors, 5 patients with T3a tumors, and 5 patients with T3b tumors. The median Gleason score was 7 (range, 6-9), and the median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 13.3 ng/mL (range, 2-65 ng/mL). Thirty-three patients received androgen suppression. At a median follow-up of 70 months (range, 18-110 months), the 7-year overall survival rate was 94%, and 61% of patients remained failure free (according to the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology definition for failure free survival). The absolute rate of disease-free survival at 2 years, which was the primary study endpoint, improved significantly (84%) compared with a rate of 64% for similar patients on the 4-month androgen suppression arm of RTOG 92-02. When Phoenix criteria (PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL) were used to define biochemical failure, 89% of patients were failure free at 2 years.

We previously have demonstrated that miR-125b stimulated the growth of prostate cancer (CaP) cells. In this study, we further determined the influence of miR-125b on the pathogenesis of CaP.  Methods:   To evaluate the effect of miR-125b on xenograft tumor growth, male athymic mice were subcutaneously injected with PC-346C-miR-125b cells that stably overexpressed miR-125b. Potential direct target transcripts of miR-125b were identified using a bioinformatics approach and three miR-125b targeted molecules were confirmed by means of biochemical analyses.  Results:   Enforced expression of miR-125b promoted tumor growth in both intact and castrated male nude mice. In an effort to define the molecular mechanism(s) mediating its tumor growth properties, we found that miR-125b directly targets eight transcripts, including three key pro-apoptotic genes: p53, Puma, and Bak1. Increasing the abundance of miR-125b resulted in a dramatic decrease in the levels of these three proteins in CaP cells. A direct repressive effect on each of these was supported by the ability of miR-125b to significantly reduce the activity of luciferase reporters containing their 3'-untranslated regions of each gene encompassing the miR-125b-binding sites. Additionally, we found that repression of miR-125b activity was able to sensitize CaP cells to different therapeutic interventions.  Conclusion:   Data obtained in this study demonstrate that miR-125b promotes growth of prostatic xenograft tumors by down-regulating three key pro-apoptotic genes.

Using HLA-DRB1*1501 (DR2b) transgenic mice, we have previously identified epitopes from two prostatic antigens, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). These antigens are implicated in the development of autoimmunity in the prostate and also are considered promising targets for prostate cancer immunotherapy. HLA-DRB1*1501 is the most common DR15 allele in Caucasians, while HLA-DRB1*1503 is the most common in African Americans. Hence characterization of peptide immunogenicity for these alleles is important for the development of prostate cancer immunotherapy in white and black patients.  Methods:   HLA-DRB1*1501 or HLA-DRB1*1503 transgenic mice were immunized with human PSA or PAP. Libraries of overlapping 20-mer peptides spanning the entire sequences of these proteins were screened by IFN-γ ELISPOT assay.  Results:   PSA and PAP peptides that were previously identified in HLA-DRB1*1501 tg mice were immunogenic in HLA-DR1503 tg mice and induced CD4 T-cell response against whole processed PSA or PAP respectively. However, the hierarchy of the immunodominance among the peptides differed significantly between strains. Using HLA-DRB1*1503 tg mice, a novel immunogenic and naturally processed 20-mer peptide, PAP (233-252) has been identified that showed no reactivity in HLA-DRB1*1501 tg mice.  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrate a disparity in CD4 T-cell immune reactivity to PSA and PAP between HLA-DRB1*1501 and -DRB1*1503 alleles in HLA transgenic mouse models.

Current direct thrombin inhibitors pose risks for bleeding in the cancer patients. We have developed an oral reversible direct thrombin inhibitor called FM19. FM19 inhibits thrombin-induced calcium mobilisation of PC3 cells with an IC50 of 15 μM with a 95% confidence interval of 7.3-31.6 μM. Thrombin stimulation increases PC3 cell invasion three-fold from 27.1 ± 11.4 to 66 ± 11.6. FM19 or bivalirudin reduces cell invasion at ≥0.1 μM (p≤0.02). After inoculation with PC3 cells, nude mice were treated with oral FM19 at 3 mg/ml in the drinking water. The treated mice did not have long bleeding times and only a 1.4-fold increase in their thrombin clotting time. However, with treatment, the mice have a reduced rate of tumour growth 0.26 ± 0.17 fold change/day vs. 0.55 ± 0.35 for untreated (p = 0.038), reduced fold change in tumour size 5.3 ± 0.47 to 8.9 ± 1.8 (untreated) (p=0.048), and reduced overall tumour weight 0.5 ± 0.31 g vs. 0.82 ± 0.32 g (untreated) (p=0.04).

Understanding CRPC prostate regrowth will provide opportunities for new cancer therapies to treat advanced disease.  Methodology/principal findings:   Elevated chemokine expression in the prostate stroma of a castrate resistant mouse model, Tgfbr2(fspKO), prompted us to look at the involvement of bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) in prostate regrowth. We identified bone marrow cells recruited to the prostate in GFP-chimeric mice. A dramatic increase in BMDC recruitment for prostate regrowth occurred three days after exogenous testosterone implantation. Recruitment led to incorporation of BMDCs within the prostate epithelia. Immunofluorescence staining suggested BMDCs in the prostate coexpressed androgen receptor; p63, a basal epithelial marker; and cytokeratin 8, a luminal epithelial marker. A subset of the BMDC population, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), were specifically found to be incorporated in the prostate at its greatest time of remodeling. Rosa26 expressing MSCs injected into GFP mice supported MSC fusion with resident prostate epithelial cells through co-localization of β-galactosidase and GFP during regrowth. In a human C4-2B xenograft model of CRPC, MSCs were specifically recruited. Injection of GFP-labeled MSCs supported C4-2B tumor progression by potentiating canonical Wnt signaling. The use of MSCs as a targeted delivery vector for the exogenously expressed Wnt antagonist, secreted frizzled related protein-2 (SFRP2), reduced tumor growth, increased apoptosis and potentiated tumor necrosis.  Conclusions/significance:   Mesenchymal stem cells fuse with prostate epithelia during the process of prostate regrowth. MSCs recruited to the regrowing prostate can be used as a vehicle for transporting genetic information with potential therapeutic effects on castrate resistant prostate cancer, for instance by antagonizing Wnt signaling through SFRP2.""","""['Veronica R Placencio', 'Xiaohong Li', 'Taylor P Sherrill', 'Gloria Fritz', 'Neil A Bhowmick']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Stromal transforming growth factor-beta signaling mediates prostatic response to androgen ablation by paracrine Wnt activity.', 'Quantification of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) at sites of human prostate cancer.', 'Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells promote growth and angiogenesis of breast and prostate tumors.', 'Loss of let-7 microRNA upregulates IL-6 in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells triggering a reactive stromal response to prostate cancer.', 'Wnt signaling in prostate development and carcinogenesis.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer - microenvironmental roles of adipose tissue.', 'Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Migrate toward Hormone-Insensitive Prostate Tumor Cells Expressing TGF-β via N-Cadherin.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor in Cross Talk Between Stromal Cells and Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.', 'Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells interact with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells to promote cancer progression and drug resistance.', 'Tumor-infiltrating mesenchymal stem cells: Drivers of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer?']"""

In the present study, we further investigated the potential effects of sildenafil on improving antitumor efficacy of DOX in prostate cancer. Cotreatment with sildenafil enhanced DOX-induced apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, which was mediated by enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, up-regulation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities, reduced expression of Bcl-xL, and phosphorylation of Bad. Overexpression of Bcl-xL or dominant negative caspase 9 attenuated the synergistic effect of sildenafil and DOX on prostate cancer cell killing. Furthermore, treatment with sildenafil and DOX in mice bearing prostate tumor xenografts resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth. The reduced tumor size was associated with amplified apoptotic cell death and increased expression of activated caspase 3.

Recent findings indicate that GRN is regulated strongly by the microRNA miR-107, which functionally overlaps with miR-15, miR-16, and miR-195 due to a common 5' sequence critical for target specificity. In this study, we queried whether miR-107 and paralogs regulated GRN in human cancers. In cultured cells, anti-argonaute RNA coimmunoprecipitation with downstream microarray analyses indicates that GRN mRNA is directly targeted by numerous miR-15/107 miRNAs. We further tested this association in human tumors. MiR-15 and miR-16 are known to be downregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Using pre-existing microarray datasets, we found that GRN expression is higher in CLL relative to nonneoplastic lymphocytes (P < 0.00001). By contrast, other prospective miR-15/miR-16 targets in the dataset (BCL-2 and cyclin D1) were not upregulated in CLL. Unlike in CLL, GRN was not upregulated in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) where miR-107 paralogs are not known to be dysregulated. Prior studies have shown that GRN is also upregulated, and miR-107 downregulated, in prostate carcinoma. Our results indicate that multiple members of the miR-107 gene group indeed repress GRN protein levels when transfected into prostate cancer cells. At least a dozen distinct types of cancer have the pattern of increased GRN and decreased miR-107 expression. These findings indicate for the first time that the mitogen and growth factor GRN is dysregulated via the miR-15/107 gene group in multiple human cancers, which may provide a potential common therapeutic target.""","""['Wang-Xia Wang', 'Natasha Kyprianou', 'Xiaowei Wang', 'Peter T Nelson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['MicroRNA-107 enhances radiosensitivity by suppressing granulin in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'miR-107 regulates granulin/progranulin with implications for traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disease.', 'Upregulation of microRNA-140-3p inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma through inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway by targeting GRN.', 'Variations in the progranulin gene affect global gene expression in frontotemporal lobar degeneration.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'Autophagy modulators influence the content of important signalling molecules in PS-positive extracellular vesicles.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'The Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of Circulating MicroRNAs in the Assessment of Patients With Prostate Cancer: Rational and Progress.', 'Screening key miRNAs and genes in prostate cancer by microarray analysis.', 'MicroRNA-107 enhances radiosensitivity by suppressing granulin in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.']"""

These include non-standardized reporting of endpoints such as urinary and erectile function, statistically unreliable estimates from low volume surgeons and perverse incentives, such as referring of high risk patients to radiotherapy. We recommend an alternative to the “name-and-shame” paradigm of public outcomes reporting: continuous quality improvement. Surgeons are given reports as to their own outcomes on a private basis, such that no-one else can see their data. This helps to build trust and to avoid perverse incentives. Such reports must be multi-dimensional and based on a comprehensive, patient-reported outcomes system.

Materials and methods:   A total of 72 patients with localized prostate cancer were prospectively studied based on blood samples before and after androgen deprivation therapy for 6 months. Serum pituitary hormones, androgens and prostate specific antigen were measured using highly sensitive assays.  Results:   After androgen deprivation therapy serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione and prostate specific antigen decreased compared with those at the baseline (all values p <0.001). No difference was noted between serum levels before and after androgen deprivation therapy in growth hormone (p = 0.098) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (p = 0.101). Each serum level of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and growth hormone after androgen deprivation therapy was not correlated with the serum levels of androgens or prostate specific antigen. The serum adrenocorticotropic hormone level after androgen deprivation therapy was correlated with the serum levels of testosterone (p = 0.002), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (p = 0.002), androstenedione (p = 0.006) and prostate specific antigen (p <0.001). Serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstenedione levels were also correlated with serum prostate specific antigen (p <0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively).  Conclusions:   In patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy the pituitary-adrenal axis mediated by adrenocorticotropic hormone has a central role in the regulation of androgen synthesis.

Level of evidence:   4. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Despite excellent surgical cancer control, up to 40% of patients will have biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer. Positive surgical margins (PSM) have been clearly demonstrated to be one of the main predictive factors for biochemical failure, disease progression and cancer mortality. However, decision of further management (adjuvant or salvage therapy) in patients with PSM remains controversial, and many debatable questions arise concerning the incidence of clinical progression and the impact of systematic adjuvant treatment on the cancer specific and overall survival. Analysis of the pathological and disease recurrence outcomes of our large cohort of patients treated by RP provides evidence that PSMs are associated with a poor prognosis in terms of PSA failure and need for salvage therapy. However, such a distinction between negative or positive margin cancers seems to appear clinically less relevant in locally advanced disease with seminal vesicle or high Gleason score≥8 due to the predominant significance of these two poor prognosis factors for prediction of PSA failure.  Objective:   To study the impact of positive surgical margins (PSMs) as an independent predictor of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.  Patients and methods:   From 2000 to 2008, 1943 men who underwent a radical prostatectomy at Henri Mondor Hospital and who did not receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy were included. Follow-up was recorded into a prospective database. Mean follow-up was 68.8 months. The biochemical recurrence-free survival (RFS), defined by a PSA>0.2 ng/mL, and the need for salvage therapy in univariate and multivariate models, were evaluated.  Results:   PSA failure was reported in 14.7% and PSMs were noted in 25.6%. In the overall cohort, PSM was significantly predictive for PSA failure (P<0.001; hazard ratio, HR, 2.6), need for salvage therapy (P<0.001; HR, 2.9) and specific deaths (P=0.006; HR, 3.7). The 5-year RFS was 84.4% in men with negative margins compared to 57.5% in the case of PSM. After stratification by pathological stage and Gleason score, margin status was significantly predictive for PSA failure in pT2 (P<0.001), pT3a (P=0.001) and/or Gleason score≤7 cancers (P<0.001), whereas the impact of PSM did not reach significance in pT3b (P=0.196), pT4 (P=0.061) and/or Gleason score≥8 cancers (P=0.115).

In recent years, several nomograms were developed in an effort to decrease the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies. The European SWOP-PRI and the North American PCPT are among the most popular. However, evidence on the relative predictive accuracy is lacking. A head-to-head comparison on the diagnostic accuracy of two previously validated prostate cancer risk predictors on biopsy confirmed the superiority of these tools over PSA alone. Moreover, in the studied population, the European SWOP-PRI proved to be more accurate than the North American PCPT-CRC.  Objective:   To compare the diagnostic accuracy of two previously validated prostate cancer risk predictors on biopsy.

The predictive accuracy of these online available nomograms was calculated based on the area under the curve derived from receiver-operator characteristic curves and then compared using the DeLong method.  Results:   Both tools were confirmed to be superior to prostate-specific antigen alone.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? It is known that urorectal fistulae is a serious but rare complication of the treatment of carcinoma of the prostate. This study adds a distinction between post-surgical fistulate and post-irradiation fistulae. Essentially most post-surgical fistulae are simple and relatively easily dealt with: the expectation is that the patient will return to normality; whereas post-irradiation fistulate are by their nature complex and much more difficult to treat with a much more uncertain long-term outcome. Complexity is discussed and defined.  Objective:   • To evaluate the management of urorectal fistulae (URF) in light of new technology in prostate cancer treatment, which has changed the nature of these URF and, therefore, the approach to treatment.  Patients and methods:   • Between 2004 and 2009 we repaired URF after treatment for prostate cancer in 40 patients with a minimum of 1-year follow-up since their last intervention. • In 23 patients (post-surgical group) the URF resulted from open, laparoscopic or robotic radical prostatectomy. In the other 17 patients (post-irradiation group) the URF resulted from either external beam radiation (EBRT) or brachytherapy (BT), or both, salvage cryotherapy or salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound (sHIFU). • In the 23 patients in the post-surgical group a transperineal repair was performed. In the post-irradiation group a transperineal repair was performed in three of the 17 patients. A transabdominal or abdominoperineal repair was performed in the remaining 14 patients, combined with salvage radical prostatectomy in those eight patients in whom a discrete prostate still existed, and in whom this was possible.  Results:   • The URF were cured in all patients. • A bladder-neck contracture (BNC) developed in two patients, one of whom is being managed by interval dilatation and the other of whom had a revision of his vesico-urethral anastomosis. Sphincter weakness incontinence required further treatment in eight patients by implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter. • A specific category of complex URF with cavitation was identified, which is particularly common after sHIFU following the combination of previous EBRT and BT, but which may result from the sequential application of any 'new technology'.  Conclusions:   • URF of any degree of complexity can be managed without the need for a transanorectal sphincter-splitting approach or a covering colostomy and without the need for an interposition flap when the circumstances are appropriate and the surgeon is sufficiently experienced. URF with cavitation and in the post-irradiation group are an exception and do require an interposition flap. • The role of salvage radical prostatectomy in patients with a URF who still have a prostate, needs to be defined. • We suggest that cavitation, BNC and extensive ischaemia due to the serial application of external energy sources confer 'complexity'. Post-surgical URF are simple except for those with cavitation or a BNC. Most post-irradiation URF are complex even in the absence of cavitation or a BNC.""","""['Anthony R Mundy', 'Daniela E Andrich']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Urorectal fistulae following the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Laparoscopic urorectal fistula repair: value of the salvage prostatectomy and review of current approaches.', 'Transperineal management for postoperative and radiation rectourethral fistulas.', 'Analysis of a Surgical Treatment for Persistent Urorectal Fistulas after Radical Cancer Surgery: A Comparison of Prostate Cancer and Rectal Cancer.', 'Posterior urethral complications of the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Functional and quality-of-life outcomes in patients undergoing transperineal repair with gracilis muscle interposition for complex rectourethral fistula.', 'Outcomes of gracilis muscle interposition for rectourethral fistulas caused by treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Urological complications after radiation therapy-nothing ventured, nothing gained: a Narrative Review.', 'Adverse Features of Rectourethral Fistula Requiring Extirpative Surgery and Permanent Dual Diversion: Our Experience and Recommendations.', 'Management of Medium and Long Term Complications Following Prostate Cancer Treatment Resulting in Urinary Diversion - A Narrative Review.', 'Urorectal fistula repair using different approaches: operative results and quality of life issues.']"""

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Previous reports showed controversial evidence supporting the role of sex steroids, mainly testosterone, in the etiology and pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PCa). The bioavailability of sex steroids is significantly regulated by sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In this context, SHBG levels have been shown to be significantly higher in PCa patients than in controls. Likewise, SHBG was reported to serve as an independent predictor for extra-prostatic extension of tumour [defined as cancer (≥pT3) with capsular penetration, seminal vesicle involvement, or lymph node invasion (LNI)] in patients with clinically localized PCa. The presence of non-organ-confined disease is significantly associated with higher biochemical recurrence rates. This study provides novel evidence that SHBG might serve as a significant multivariate predictor of extra capsular extension (ECE) in PCa patients submitted to radical prostatectomy, after accounting for preoperative clinically available variables such as patient's age, total PSA, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason sum, and BMI. Moreover, a clinical cut-off for circulating SHBG allows using this easily quantifiable molecule as a novel clinical parameter in PCa patients.  Objective:   • To examine the association between sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and extracapsular extension (ECE) in men treated with retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP).  Patients and methods:   • Preoperative serum SHBG levels were measured in a cohort of 629 consecutive European Caucasian men [mean (range) age of 64 (41-78) years] who underwent RRP. • No patient received any hormonal neoadjuvant treatment. SHBG levels were measured the day before RRP (08:00-10:00 hours) in all cases at the same laboratory. • Logistic regression models tested the association between predictors [including age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason sum, body mass index (BMI), and SHBG] and ECE. • Combined accuracy of predictors was tested in regression-based models predicting ECE at RRP. SHBG was included in the model both as a continuous and categorized variable (according to the most informative threshold level of 30 nmol/L).  Results:   • In all, 92 patients (14.6%) had ECE. The mean (standard deviation; median) serum SHBG levels were significantly higher in men with ECE compared with those with no ECE at 41.1 (14.7; 37.5) vs 36.4 (16.7; 34) nmol/L (P= 0.007; 95% confidence interval -8.00, -1.29). • Univariate analyses indicated that continuously coded SHBG was significantly [odds ratio (OR) 1.01; P= 0.03] associated with ECE, with a predictive accuracy of 60.1%. • At multivariate analyses, both continuous (OR 1.01; P= 0.03) and categorical SHBG (OR 3.22; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with ECE, after accounting for age, PSA level, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason sum, and BMI. • Addition of continuously coded SHBG slightly increased the predictive accuracy of the base model based on clinically established predictors from 63.3% to 65.5% (2.0% gain; P= 0.48). • In contrast, a model based on categorized-SHBG showed bootstrap-corrected predictive accuracy of 68.4% (5.1% gain; P= 0.044).

MRI and MRSI were performed in 54 patients (mean age: 63.9 years, mean PSA value: 11.4 ng/mL) and the ability of MRI/MRSI-directed TRUS biopsy was evaluated. A three-point score system was used for both techniques to distinguish healthy from malignant regions. Descriptive statistics and ROC analyses were performed to evaluate the accuracy and the best cut-off in the three-point score system. Twenty-two out of 54 patients presented cancer at MRI/MRSI-directed TRUS biopsy, nine presented cancer only in PZ, eight both in PZ and TZ, and five exclusively in TZ. On a patient basis the highest accuracy was obtained by assigning malignancy on a positive finding with MRSI and MRI even though it was not significantly greater than that obtained using MRI alone (area under the ROC curve, AUC: 0.723 vs 0.676). On a regional (n = 648) basis the best accuracy was also obtained by considering positive both MRSI and MRI for PZ (0.768) and TZ (0.822). MRSI was false positive in 11.9% of the regions. Twenty-eight percent of cores with prostatitis were false positive findings on MRSI, whereas only 2.7% of benign prostatic hyperplasia was false positive. In conclusion, the accuracy of MRI/MRSI-directed biopsies in localization of prostate cancer is good in patient (0.723) and region analyses (0.768).

Materials and methods:   A multi-bladed cutting device was developed, which consists of an adjustable box capable of accommodating a prostatectomy specimen up to 85 mm in size in the lateral direction, a ""plunger"" tool to press on the excised gland from the top to prevent it from rolling or sliding during sectioning, and a multi-bladed knife assembly capable of holding up to 21 blades at 4-mm intervals. The device was tested on a formalin fixed piece of meat and subsequently used to section a prostatectomy specimen. Histology sections were compared with T2-weighted MR images acquired in vivo before the prostatectomy procedure.  Results:   The prostatectomy specimen slices were very uniform in thickness with each face parallel to the other with no visible sawing marks on the sections by the blades after the cut. MRI and histology comparison showed good correspondence between the two images.  Conclusion:   The developed device allows sectioning of prostatectomy specimens into parallel cuts at a specific orientation and fixed intervals.

Hence, we inactivated the Id1 gene in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo to determine whether the Id1 gene has therapeutic potential in the treatment of prostate cancer. A modified small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to inactivate the Id1 gene in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC3 and its xenografts in nude mice. Downregulation of Id1 by siRNA was confirmed by real-time PCR. The changes of cell viability, apoptosis and senescence rate in PC3 were individually detected. The mRNA and protein expression of Id1, PCNA and MMP2 in xenografted tumors was further individually assayed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression of Id1 were obviously inhibited by the siRNA strategy in PC3 cells and their xenografts (P<0.01). The cell viability of PC3 was suppressed obviously (P<0.01); meanwhile, the apoptosis and senescence rates of PC3 were significantly increased by siRNA (P<0.01). Moreover, tumor growth was inhibited by the gene silencing of Id1. Two genes involved in proliferation (PCNA) and tumor invasion (MMP2) were found significantly decreased by siRNA in PC3 xenografts (P<0.01).

The structural basis of the BMD deficit and bone fragility is uncertain.  Objective and patients:   We investigated changes in bone microarchitecture in 26 men (70.6±6.8 yr) with nonmetastatic prostate cancer during the first year of ADT using the new technique of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography.  Design and setting:   We conducted a 12-month prospective observational study in the setting of a tertiary referral center.  Results:   After 12 months of ADT, total volumetric density decreased by 5.2±5.4% at the distal radius and 4.2±2.7% at the distal tibia (both P<0.001). This was due to a decrease in cortical volumetric BMD (by 11.3±8.6% for radius and 6.0±4.2% for tibia, all P<0.001) and trabecular density (by 3.5±6.0% for radius and 1.5±2.3% for tibia, all P<0.01), after correcting for trabecularization of cortical bone. Trabecular density decreased due to a decrease in trabecular number at both sites (P<0.05). Total testosterone, but not estradiol, levels were independently associated with total and corrected cortical volumetric BMD at the tibia.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The Polycomb protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) functions as an epigenetic gene silencer and plays a role in oncogenesis by promoting cell proliferation and invasion. EZH2 has been implicated in human PCa progression, because its expression is often elevated in hormone-refractory PCa. Here, we demonstrated that expression of EZH2 is lower in androgen-sensitive LNCaP PCa cells compared with Rf and C4-2 cells, two androgen-refractory sublines that are derived from LNCaP cells. Androgen ablation by castration increased the level of EZH2 proteins in LNCaP xenografts in mice. In contrast, treatment of LNCaP cells in culture with the synthetic androgen methyltrieolone (R1881) at doses of 1 nm or higher suppressed EZH2 expression. Moreover, our data suggest that androgen repression of EZH2 requires a functional androgen receptor and this effect is mediated through the retinoblastoma protein and its related protein p130. We further showed that androgen treatment not only increases expression of EZH2 target genes DAB2IP and E-cadherin but also affects LNCaP cell migration. Our results reveal that androgens function as an epigenetic regulator in prostatic cells by repression of EZH2 expression through the retinoblastoma protein and p130-dependent pathways. Our findings also suggest that blockade of EZH2 derepression during androgen deprivation therapy may represent an effective tactic for the treatment of androgen-refractory PCa.""","""['Laura R Bohrer', 'Shuai Chen', 'Timothy C Hallstrom', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['MicroRNA-101 negatively regulates Ezh2 and its expression is modulated by androgen receptor and HIF-1alpha/HIF-1beta.', 'Down-regulation of human DAB2IP gene expression mediated by polycomb Ezh2 complex and histone deacetylase in prostate cancer.', 'Developmental and androgenic regulation of chromatin regulators EZH2 and ANCCA/ATAD2 in the prostate Via MLL histone methylase complex.', 'Importance of Ezh2 polycomb protein in tumorigenesis process interfering with the pathway of growth suppressive key elements.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Emerging Role of YAP and the Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinicopathological Analysis of Expression of Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 2 in Canine Mammary Carcinoma.', 'Nuclear Receptor Coregulators in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.', 'Exploiting the tumor-suppressive activity of the androgen receptor by CDK4/6 inhibition in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.']"""

Herein, we sought to explore the effect of including PSA nadir into commonly used models on their accuracy to predict BCR after RP.  Methods:   This was a retrospective analysis of 943 and 1792 subjects from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) and Duke Prostate Cancer (DPC) databases, respectively. The discrimination accuracy for BCR of seven previously published models was assessed using concordance index and compared with and without adding PSA nadir level in SEARCH. Using data from SEARCH, we developed a new nomogram incorporating PSA nadir to other known predictors (preoperative PSA, pathological Gleason score, PSA nadir level, surgical findings, prostate weight, body mass index and race) of BCR and externally validated it in the DPC.  Results:   In SEARCH, the mean concordance index across all seven nomograms was 0.687. After the inclusion of PSA nadir, the concordance index increased by nearly 7% (mean=0.753). The concordance index of the new nomogram in SEARCH was 0.779 (bias-corrected=0.767), which was 5% better than the next best model. In DPC, the new nomogram yielded a concordance index of 0.778.  Conclusion:   The addition of postoperative PSA nadir to commonly used nomograms increased their accuracies by nearly 7%.

Objective:   • To assess the impact of primary surgical therapy on local control for patients with lymph-node-positive prostate cancer.  Methods:   • A retrospective analysis from January 1982 to January 2001 identified 192 patients treated by radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP, N= 87), hormonal ablative therapy (ADT, N= 74), or RRP plus adjuvant hormones (RRP + ADT, N= 31). • Statistical analyses were conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis test, chi-squared or Fisher's exact test, log-rank test and logistic regression with the statistical significance level set at P < 0.05.  Results:   • The incidence of local relapse in the three treatment groups (RRP, ADT and RRP + ADT) was 40.2%, 59.5% and 12.9%, respectively. • Among those with local relapse, the incidence of symptomatic local relapse (defined as local symptoms secondary to locally recurrent prostate cancer) was 25.7%, 75.0% and 50.0%, respectively. • Logistic regression analysis used to identify predictors of local relapse indicated that patients treated with ADT (OR = 1.96; P= 0.270) had higher odds of having a local relapse whereas patients treated with RRP + ADT (OR = 0.20; P= 0.032) had significantly lower odds of having a local relapse compared with patients treated with RRP (reference group) after adjusting for other significant predictors such as increases in serum PSA at diagnosis (OR = 1.09; P= 0.018) and biochemical failure after primary therapy (OR = 48.3; P < 0.001). • Logistic regression analysis used to identify predictors of symptomatic local relapse, among patients having had a relapse, indicated that patients treated with RRP + ADT (OR = 2.90; P= 0.322) had higher odds of having a symptomatic local relapse whereas patients treated with ADT alone (OR = 8.67; P < 0.001) had significantly higher odds of having a symptomatic local relapse compared with patients treated with RRP (reference group).

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Today, controversies continue with regards to the potential impact of obesity or increased body mass index (BMI) on actual pathological features of prostate cancer and/or clinical outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP). Moreover, a paucity of relevant data exist in the literature regarding Asian or Korean men. For the first time to our knowledge, the study demonstrated that although higher BMI was significantly associated with extracapsular extension of tumour, BMI did not significantly enhance ability to preoperatively predict extracapsular extension of tumour and was not significantly associated with PSA outcome as well as other objective pathological outcomes in Korean men undergoing RP, who are generally leaner than Western counterparts.  Objective:   • To investigate the impact of increased body mass index (BMI) on pathological features after radical prostatectomy (RP) in Korean patients.  Patients and methods:   • We reviewed the records of 1000 Korean patients who underwent RP for prostate cancer and assessed the differences in pathological outcomes and biochemical recurrence-free survival after RP according to BMI of subjects via univariate and multivariate analyses. • A multivariate logistics regression model, the performance of which was analysed from a receiver operator characteristics curve, was applied to assess the predictive capacity of variables shown to be significant predictors of adverse pathological outcome.  Results:   • Among our subjects, only 17 (1.7%) men had BMI ≥30 kg/m(2). After adjusting for various clinical variables, BMI (highest quartile vs others) was shown to be significantly associated with extracapsular extension of tumour (P= 0.014) and positive surgical margin (P= 0.019), but not with high pathological Gleason score (P= 0.912) and seminal vesicle invasion (P= 0.191). • Meanwhile, the addition of BMI to a multivariate model devised for preoperatively predicting extracapsular extension of tumour did not significantly increase predictive accuracy of the model (P= 0.319).

Patients and methods:   • We prospectively analysed 552 consecutive men with prostate cancer who underwent RRP and PLND (2006-2008). • All patients had detailed clinical and pathological data prospectively recorded in an electronic database. Drains were removed when the amount of lymph was < 20 mL in the previous 24 h. A CSL was defined as the presence of a symptomatic lymphocoele requiring treatment. Lymphorrhoea was defined as the total amount of lymph drained by the drains until their removal. • Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to test the association between all the predictors (age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, prostate volume, clinical stage, number of LNs removed, surgeon, pathological T and N stage) and the presence of CSL. • Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were also used to test the association between the available predictors and lymphorrhoea.  Results:   • The median (range) number of LNs removed was 20 (1-63). Both linear and logistic multivariable regression analysis showed that the number of removed LNs and age were the only two statistically significant predictors of total amount of lymphorrhoea and CSL after RRP and PLND (both P < 0.01). • Specifically, the risk of developing a CSL increased by 5% for every LN removed. Similarly, every year of age increased the risk of having CSL by 5%. • The most informative thresholds for predicting CSL were 65 years of age and 20 LNs removed. • External iliac lymphadenectomy resulted in a higher associated risk of lymphorrhoea and CLS relative to obturator LN removal (P= 0.001 vs P= 0.1, respectively).

In this study we designed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for posttranscriptional gene knock down of CD46, CD55 and CD59 aiming at to sensitize tumor cells to complement attack and thereby to better exploit complement for tumor cell destruction. Tumor cell lines of different origin, such as Du145 (prostate), BT474 (breast) and K562 (erythroleukemia) were selected for the study. FACS-analysis demonstrated that siRNA anti-CD46(301) reduced CD46 protein expression up to 80%, siRNA anti-CD55(255) diminished CD55 protein expression up to 49%, and CD59 protein expression was inhibited up to 82% by siRNA anti-CD59(1339). Time course experiments revealed a long-lasting silencing effect with >50% complement regulator inhibition up to day 13. Upon mCRP knock down, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was augmented by 20-30% for CD46, by up to 24% for CD55 and by up to 55% for CD59.

However, using the traditional deformable-model-based segmentation methods, it is difficult to capture intrapatient variation when the number of samples from the same patient is limited. This article presents a new deformable model, designed specifically for segmenting sequential CT images of the prostate, which leverages both population and patient-specific statistics to accurately capture the intrapatient variation of the patient under therapy.  Methods:   The novelty of the proposed method is twofold: First, a weighted combination of gradient and probability distribution function (PDF) features is used to build the appearance model to guide model deformation. The strengths of each feature type are emphasized by dynamically adjusting the weight between the profile-based gradient features and the local-region-based PDF features during the optimization process. An additional novel aspect of the gradient-based features is that, to alleviate the effect of feature inconsistency in the regions of gas and bone adjacent to the prostate, the optimal profile length at each landmark is calculated by statistically investigating the intensity profile in the training set. The resulting gradient-PDF combined feature produces more accurate and robust segmentations than general gradient features. Second, an online learning mechanism is used to build shape and appearance statistics for accurately capturing intrapatient variation.  Results:   The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on 306 images of the 24 patients. Compared to traditional gradient features, the proposed gradient-PDF combination features brought 5.2% increment in the success ratio of segmentation (from 94.1% to 99.3%). To evaluate the effectiveness of online learning mechanism, the authors carried out a comparison between partial online update strategy and full online update strategy. Using the full online update strategy, the mean DSC was improved from 86.6% to 89.3% with 2.8% gain. On the basis of full online update strategy, the manual modification before online update strategy was introduced and tested, the best performance was obtained; here, the mean DSC and the mean ASD achieved 92.4% and 1.47 mm, respectively.  Conclusions:   The proposed prostate segmentation method provided accurate and robust segmentation results for CT images even under the situation where the samples of patient under radiotherapy were limited. A conclusion that the proposed method is suitable for clinical application can be drawn.""","""['Qianjin Feng', 'Mark Foskey', 'Wufan Chen', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Deformable segmentation of 3D MR prostate images via distributed discriminative dictionary and ensemble learning.', 'A semiautomatic segmentation method for prostate in CT images using local texture classification and statistical shape modeling.', 'Object-constrained meshless deformable algorithm for high speed 3D nonrigid registration between CT and CBCT.', '3D meshless prostate segmentation and registration in image guided radiotherapy.', 'Locally-constrained boundary regression for segmentation of prostate and rectum in the planning CT images.', 'Boundary Coding Representation for Organ Segmentation in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Iterative Label Denoising Network: Segmenting Male Pelvic Organs in CT From 3D Bounding Box Annotations.', 'CT Male Pelvic Organ Segmentation via Hybrid Loss Network With Incomplete Annotation.', 'CT male pelvic organ segmentation using fully convolutional networks with boundary sensitive representation.', 'STRAINet: Spatially Varying sTochastic Residual AdversarIal Networks for MRI Pelvic Organ Segmentation.']"""

This common knowledge representation framework is an important pre-requisite to develop integrated meta-classifiers for disease classification. In this paper, we present a unified data fusion framework, Semi Supervised Multi Kernel Graph Embedding (SeSMiK-GE). Our method allows for representation of individual data modalities via a combined multi-kernel framework followed by semi- supervised dimensionality reduction, where partial label information is incorporated to embed high dimensional data in a reduced space.

Implicit features of morphology, such as contour smoothness or perimeter-to-area ratio, have been used in the context of computerized decision support classifiers to aid disease diagnosis. These features are usually specific to the domain and application (e.g., margin irregularity is a predictor of malignant breast lesions on DCE-MRI). In this paper we present a framework for extracting Diffeomorphic Based Similarity (DBS) features to capture subtle morphometric differences between shapes that may not be captured by implicit features. Object morphology is represented using the medial axis model and objects are compared by determining correspondences between medial axis models using a cluster-based diffeomorphic registration scheme. To visualize and classify morphometric differences, a manifold learning scheme (Graph Embedding) is employed to identify nonlinear dependencies between medial axis model similarity and calculate DBS. We evaluated our DBS on two clinical problems discriminating: (a) different Gleason grades of prostate cancer using gland morphology on a set of 102 images, and (b) benign and malignant lesions on 44 breast DCE-MRI studies. Precision-recall curves demonstrate DBS features are better able to classify shapes belonging to the same class compared to implicit features. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained to distinguish between different classes utilizing DBS.

Intra-operative dosimetry optimization requires reconstruction of the implanted seeds from multiple C-arm fluoroscopy images, which in turn requires estimation of the C-arm poses. We estimate the pose of the C-arm by two-stage registration between the 2D fluoroscopy images to a 3D TRUS volume. As single-view 2D/3D registration tends to yield depth error, we first estimate the depth from multiple 2D fluoro images and input this to a single-view 2D/3D registration. A commercial phantom was implanted with seeds and imaged with TRUS and CT. Ground-truth registration was established between the two by radiographic fiducials. Synthetic ground-truth fluoro images were created from the CT volume and registered to the 3D TRUS. The average rotation and translation errors were 1.0 degrees (STD = 2.3 degrees) and 0.7 mm (STD = 1.9 mm), respectively. In data from a human patient, the average rotation and lateral translation errors were 0.6 degrees (STD = 3.0 degrees) and 1.5 mm (STD = 2.8 mm), respectively, relative to the ground-truth established by a radiographic fiducial.

The current study sought to: (1) document levels of physical and mental health, and marital satisfaction, and (2) evaluate the relationship between physical and mental health with marital satisfaction in this understudied population.  Methods:   APC survivors who had undergone androgen deprivation therapy within the past year and their spousal caregiver participated in the study (N = 29 dyads). Physical and mental health was assessed using the MOS SF-36 Health Survey and marital satisfaction was evaluated using the Dyadic Adjustment Scale.  Results:   The Actor-Partner Interdependence Model revealed strong relations between physical and mental health with marital satisfaction for both survivor and caregiver (actor effects). Furthermore, caregiver physical and mental health was related with the survivor's marital satisfaction (partner effect).  Conclusions:   Levels of mental health and marital satisfaction were comparable to community-based and prostate cancer samples, while physical health was higher. Marital satisfaction between APC survivors and their spousal caregivers may be influenced by both physical and mental health functioning.

Recently, the level of polyamines (mainly spermine) has been shown to improve specificity even further. However, the in vivo detection of these polyamines (at 3.1 ppm) is hampered by signal cancellation as a result of J-coupling effects and signal overlap with choline (3.2 ppm) and creatine (3.0 ppm) resonances. At higher magnetic field strengths, the chemical shift dispersion will increase, which allows the use of very selective radiofrequency pulses to refocus J-coupled spins. In this work, we added selective refocusing pulses to a semi-LASER (localisation based on adiabatic selective refocusing) sequence at 7 T, and optimised the inter-pulse timings of the sequence for fully refocused detection of spermine spins, whilst maintaining optimised detection of choline, creatine and the strongly coupled spin system of citrate.""","""['D W J Klomp', 'T W J Scheenen', 'C S Arteaga', 'J van Asten', 'V O Boer', 'P R Luijten']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['Composite slice-selective adiabatic excitation for prostate MRSI.', 'A phase and frequency alignment protocol for 1H MRSI data of the prostate.', 'Proton spectroscopic imaging of the human prostate at 7 T.', 'Metabolite ratios in 1H MR spectroscopic imaging of the prostate.', 'Novel biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis by MRS.', 'Ultra-high-field MR in Prostate cancer: Feasibility and Potential.', 'Developments in proton MR spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Metabolism of prostate cancer by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).', 'Evolution of UHF Body Imaging in the Human Torso at 7T: Technology, Applications, and Future Directions.', 'Design of a forward view antenna for prostate imaging at 7\u2009T.']"""

At the same time, soy isoflavones have significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, which may help prevent the side effects of radiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that soy isoflavones could be useful when given in conjunction with curative radiation therapy in patients with localized prostate cancer. In addition to enhancing the efficacy of radiation therapy, soy isoflavones could prevent the adverse effects of radiation. We conducted a pilot study to investigate the effects of soy isoflavone supplementation on acute and subacute toxicity (≤6 mo) of external beam radiation therapy in patients with localized prostate cancer. Forty-two patients with prostate cancer were randomly assigned to receive 200 mg soy isoflavone (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2) daily for 6 mo beginning with the first day of radiation therapy, which was administered in 1.8 to 2.5 Gy fractions for a total of 73.8 to 77.5 Gy. Adverse effects of radiation therapy on bladder, bowel, and sexual function were assessed by a self-administered quality of life questionnaire at 3 and 6 mo. Only 26 and 27 patients returned completed questionnaires at 3 and 6 mo, respectively. At each time point, urinary, bowel, and sexual adverse symptoms induced by radiation therapy were decreased in the soy isoflavone group compared to placebo group. At 3 mo, soy-treated patients had less urinary incontinence, less urgency, and better erectile function as compared to the placebo group. At 6 mo, the symptoms in soy-treated patients were further improved as compared to the placebo group. These patients had less dripping/leakage of urine (7.7% in Group 1 vs. 28.4% in Group 2), less rectal cramping/diarrhea (7.7% vs. 21.4%), and less pain with bowel movements (0% vs. 14.8%) than placebo-treated patients.

In addition, carriers identified in a population-based cohort of all cases diagnosed with breast cancer in Israel in 1987-1988 allowed the estimation of the population frequency of this phenomenon.  Results:   In the clinic-based series of 1191 carriers of mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 belonging to 567 families, 22 males and females (1.85%) from 17 different families (3.0%) were found to harbor two different mutations. These included 18 individuals (1.51%) who concomitantly carried the 185delAG BRCA1 and the 6174delT BRCA2 mutations and four individuals (0.34%) who carried the 5382insC BRCA1 and the 6174delT mutations.

Methods and results:   Using a national registry in Sweden, we compared the rate of first-ever hospitalization and associated short- and long-term survival for HF, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and the most common forms of cancer on an age and sex-specific basis during 1988 to 2004 in 949 733 Swedish patients (1 162 309 hospital admissions in total). Annual incidence of first-ever hospitalization for HF, AMI, and cancer in Sweden were 484, 424, and 373 (lung, colorectal, prostate, and bladder cancer combined) per 100 000 men and 470, 280, and 350 (lung, colorectal, bladder, breast, and ovarian cancer combined) per 100 000 women age >20 years. The ratio of individual cases of HF to cancer was 1.37:1 (465 998 versus 340 738). Despite improvements in 30-day and 5-year survival (adjusted 7% and 6% increase per calendar year for men and women, respectively), HF was associated with unadjusted case-fatality rate of 59% within 5 years and 196 400 deaths versus 58% and 131 000 deaths in patients with cancer. During 10-year follow-up, HF was associated with 66 318 versus 55 364 premature life-years lost than all common forms of cancer in men. In women, the equivalent figures were 59 535 versus 64 533 premature life-years lost.

Objective:   To analyze the distribution of podoplanin expression in tumor stroma and its clinical and biologic significance.  Design:   We performed immunohistochemistry for podoplanin on tissue microarrays from 1350 cases of 14 common cancer types.  Results:   Two hundred eighty-seven of 662 cases (43%) showed podoplanin expression in the stromal cells within cancer nests. Stromal podoplanin expression in 14 common cancer types was significantly associated with tumor stage (P < .001), lymph node metastases (P < .001), lymphatic invasion (P = .02), and venous invasion (P < .001). The stromal cells positive for podoplanin were also positive for α-smooth muscle actin but negative for desmin, confirming a myofibroblasts phenotype. In contrast, myofibroblasts in inflammatory fibrotic lung diseases were podoplanin negative.

Toward this goal, we developed a lectin-directed tandem labeling (LTL) quantitative proteomics strategy in which we enriched sialylated glycopeptides by SNA, labeled them at the N-terminus by acetic anhydride ((1)H(6)/(2)D(6)) reagents, enzymatically deglycosylated the differentially labeled peptides in the presence of heavy water (H(2)(18)O), and performed LC/MS/MS analysis to identify glycopeptides. We successfully used fetuin as a model protein to test the feasibility of this LTL strategy not only to find true positive glycosylation sites but also to obtain accurate quantitative results on the glycosylation changes. Further, we implemented this method to investigate the sialylation changes in prostate cancer serum samples as compared to healthy controls. Herein, we report a total of 45 sialylated glycopeptides and an increase of sialylation in most of the glycoproteins identified in prostate cancer serum samples. Further quantitation of nonglycosylated peptides revealed that sialylation is increased in most of the glycoproteins, whereas the protein concentrations remain unchanged.

Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue with broad antitumor activity. In a phase 2 study of combined docetaxel and gemcitabine, the authors assessed its safety and activity in patients with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic CRPC.  Methods:   Eligible patients had untreated, metastatic CRPC with radiologic and/or biochemical evidence of progression after antiandrogen withdrawal with castrate testosterone levels, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 2, and adequate organ function; no previous chemotherapy was permitted. Patients received gemcitabine (800 mg/m²) Days 1 and 8 and docetaxel (75 mg/m²) on Day 8 every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for measurable disease. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was defined as a decline ≥ 50% in baseline PSA level.  Results:   Thirty-five patients with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic CRPC were enrolled. The median age was 67 years, and 60% of patients had an ECOG PS of 0. PSA responses were observed in 49% of patients. Among the patients who had measurable disease (n = 25), 3 patients (12%) had a confirmed, RECIST-defined partial response (PR); 4 patients (16%) had an unconfirmed PR; and 15 patients (60%) achieved stable disease. The most common adverse events included grade 1 and 2 fatigue (69%), alopecia (80%), and nausea/vomiting (54%). No treatment-related deaths were noted, but an unusually high incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed.  Conclusions:   The efficacy of combined gemcitabine and docetaxel in metastatic CRPC was similar to that observed with single-agent docetaxel.

To address these issues, we prospectively investigated the feasibility of using a double-balloon rectal catheter.  Methods:   The rectal catheter has inner and outer balloons that wedge the anus between them. Computed tomography (CT) examinations with and without the catheter were conducted in seven patients with localized prostate cancer treated by external-beam radiotherapy. The rectal wall sparing effect was evaluated using virtual three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans in each arm. To evaluate interfractional prostate motion, each patient underwent a series of four CT examinations consisting of a planning CT followed by three additional series of CT with and without a catheter during the course of radiotherapy.  Results:   Virtual plans demonstrated the reduction of the dose to the rectum by expanding the posterior wall to lie outside the high- to intermediate-dose area when a catheter was applied. Interfractional prostate motion in the anteroposterior direction was effectively reduced by catheter usage; the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the displacement was 1.3 ± 0.9 mm with a catheter as compared to 2.8 ± 1.8 mm without a catheter (P = 0.014), and the maximum displacement was successfully suppressed to 3 mm with a catheter compared to 6 mm without a catheter.

We sought to estimate the population prevalence of increased familial risk for breast, ovarian, endometrial, prostate, and colorectal cancers and hereditary cancer syndromes that include these cancers.  Methods:   Using the 2005 California Health Interview Survey data, a weak, moderate, or strong familial cancer risk was assigned to 33,187 respondents. Guidelines were applied to identify individuals with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer.  Results:   Among respondents without a personal history of cancer, familial breast cancer was most prevalent; 7% had a moderate and 5% a strong familial risk. Older individuals and women were more likely to report family history of cancer. Generally, whites had the highest prevalence, and Asians and Latinos had the lowest prevalence. Among women without a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer, 2.5% met criteria for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, and among individuals without a personal history of colorectal, endometrial or ovarian cancer, 1.1% met criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer.

To support patients in managing their illness, we implemented an online patient-nurse communication (OPNC) service, where breast and prostate cancer patients could ask questions and receive advice from oncology nurses.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to explore the use and content of patients' e-mail messages sent to oncology nurses and thus gain a ""snapshot"" of patients' experiences of living with cancer as expressed through these messages.  Methods:   Using qualitative content analysis, 276 messages from 60 breast and prostate cancer patients were analyzed. Messages were coded into categories and major themes. Both manifest and latent content was coded.  Results:   Four main themes emerged from patients' messages: (1) living with symptoms and side effects, (2) living with a fear of relapse, (3) concerns for everyday life, and (4) unmet information needs from health care providers.  Conclusions:   Patients used the OPNC service actively to pose questions and raise concerns related to symptom experiences, fear of relapses, and uncertainty in everyday life. However, patients also expressed experiences of being ""left in a void"" after being discharged from hospital and living with serious unmet informational needs.  Implications for practice:   The study demonstrated that online communication can provide patients with a space for otherwise unmet questions and worries and that they will seek support from nurses online when given the opportunity. Therefore, OPNC can be an important means and supplement to traditional health care in the effort to support patients to better manage their illness.""","""['Gro Hjelmeland Grimsbø', 'Arnstein Finset', 'Cornelia M Ruland']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""[""Cancer patients' expressions of emotional cues and concerns and oncology nurses' responses, in an online patient-nurse communication service."", ""Cancer patients' questions and concerns expressed in an online nurse-delivered mail service: preliminary results."", ""Men's perspectives on the impact of prostate cancer: implications for oncology nurses."", 'Coping issues among people living with advanced cancer.', 'Does vicarious traumatisation affect oncology nurses?

This study included consecutive 10 patients underwent salvage radiotherapy (RT) for biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after RP. Normal structures included the rectum, bladder, and femoral head. For each patient, four different treatment plans including four fields RT (4F-RT), dynamic conformal arc radiotherapy (DCAT), six fields RT (6F-RT), and DCAT with rectum hollow-out technique (DCAT-HO), were created to entire the prostate bed. The parameters of the maximum and mean doses received by organs at risk (OAR), target coverage, dose homogeneity for the planning target volume (PTV) were compared. All plans were considered to be clinically tolerable for PTV coverage and dose homogeneity. The rectum sparing at the high dose area for DCAT-HO was considered to be the most superior to those for other three techniques by comparison of the dose delivered to a 1%, 5%, and 10% volume of the rectum. In the simulation of dose escalation to 70 Gy with DCAT-HO, OAR met a requirement of the dose-volume constraints. However, in the simulation of dose escalation to 72 Gy, the rectum that receives 60 to 65 Gy and bladder that receives 65 Gy exceeded the optimal dose-volume constraints. DCAT-HO was considered to be one of the most appropriate techniques in 3D-CRT if dose escalation to 70 Gy might be needed in a setting of salvage RT after RP in the future.""","""['Natsuo Tomita', 'Hidetoshi Shimizu', 'Takeshi Kodaira']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a comparison of four consensus guidelines and dosimetric evaluation of 3D-CRT versus tomotherapy IMRT.', 'Treating lung cancer with dynamic conformal arc therapy: a dosimetric study.', 'Rectal dose reduction using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer: A combination of conformal dynamic-arc and five-static field technique.', 'Salvage radiotherapy for pT3 prostate cancer with PSA failure after radical prostatectomy.', 'Dose-escalated 3D conformal radiotherapy in prostate cancer.']"""

The dosimetric parameters such as Λ, g(L)(r) and F(r, θ) used in TG-43U1-based calculation for an iodine-125 ((125)I) brachytherapy-source were examined using Monte Carlo code Geant4. Clinical dosimetry parameters such as the D(90) were evaluated among a subgroup of 50 randomly selected patients who had been treated with permanent brachytherapy between January 2008 and December 2008 at the Tokyo Medical Center. The results show a slight difference in the dose rate constant Λ (within 1.0%). The radial dose function g(L)(r) exhibits a prominent difference in the region over 3 cm, and this difference is maintained within 2.9% in the region close to the source. The calculated values of F(r, θ) for the prostate medium were similar to values for water (within 1%), except in the longitudinal axis. A comparison of D(90) values shows a systematic dose overestimation of 2.8 ± 0.7 Gy in water, where the distribution of the differences can be seen with a spread of 1.8 ± 0.3% compared to that in prostate medium. It was concluded that the introduction of any kind of tissue correction for the TG-43U1-based calculation was not necessary to allow for the differences in elemental compositions and densities between water and prostate medium.

However, these comparisons did not account for differences in population age structures.  Objective:   To compare ages at diagnosis for non-AIDS-defining types of cancer that occur in both the AIDS and general populations, after adjustment for differences in age and other demographic characteristics between these populations.  Design:   Registry linkage study.  Setting:   15 HIV/AIDS and cancer registry databases in the United States.  Participants:   212 055 persons with AIDS enrolled in the U.S. HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study from 1996 to 2007.  Measurements:   Comparison of age-at-diagnosis distributions for various types of cancer in both the AIDS and general populations, after adjustment for age and other demographic characteristics.  Results:   The proportion of person-time contributed by older persons (age ≥65 years) was far smaller in the AIDS population (1.5%) than in the general population (12.5%). Reflecting this difference, the ages at diagnosis for most types of cancer were approximately 20 years younger among persons with AIDS. However, after adjustment for differences in the populations at risk, the median ages at diagnosis in the AIDS and general populations did not differ for most types of cancer (for example, colon, prostate, or breast cancer; all P > 0.100). In contrast, ages at diagnosis of lung (median, 50 vs. 54 years) and anal cancer (median, 42 vs. 45 years) were significantly younger in persons with AIDS than expected in the general population (P < 0.001), and the age at diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma was significantly older (median, 42 vs. 40 years; P < 0.001).  Limitations:   Information on other cancer risk factors, including cigarette smoking, was not available. Analysis was restricted to non-Hispanic white and black persons who had AIDS, which could limit the generalizability of the findings to other racial and ethnic groups or to persons with HIV but not AIDS.  Conclusion:   For most types of cancer, the age at diagnosis is similar in the AIDS and general populations, after adjustment for the ages of the populations at risk. Modest age differences remained for a few types of cancer, which may indicate either acceleration of carcinogenesis by HIV or earlier exposure to cancer risk factors.

Our objective was to compare the QoL impact of the three most common primary treatments on patients who were not receiving adjuvant hormonal treatment.  Patients and methods:   This was a prospective study of 435 patients treated with radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. QoL was assessed before and after treatment with the Short Form-36 and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite. Differences between groups were tested by analysis of variance. Distribution of outcome at 3 years was examined by stratifying according to baseline status. Generalized estimating equation models were constructed to assess the effect of treatment over time.  Results:   Compared with the brachytherapy group, the prostatectomy group showed greater deterioration on urinary incontinence and sexual scores but better urinary irritative-obstructive results (-18.22, -13.19, and +6.38, respectively, at 3 years; P < .001). In patients with urinary irritative-obstructive symptoms at baseline, improvement was observed in 64% of those treated with nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. Higher bowel worsening (-2.87, P = .04) was observed in the external radiotherapy group, with 20% of patients reporting bowel symptoms.  Conclusion:   Radical prostatectomy caused urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction but improved pre-existing urinary irritative-obstructive symptoms. External radiotherapy and brachytherapy caused urinary irritative-obstructive adverse effects and some sexual dysfunction. External radiotherapy also caused bowel adverse effects. Relevant differences between treatment groups persisted for up to 3 years of follow-up, although the difference in sexual adverse effects between brachytherapy and prostatectomy tended to decline over long-term follow-up.

In the present work, we describe a self-assembled polymeric nanoparticle (NP) platform to target and control precisely the codelivery of drugs with varying physicochemical properties to cancer cells. As proof of concept, we codelivered cisplatin and docetaxel (Dtxl) to prostate cancer cells with synergistic cytotoxicity. A polylactide (PLA) derivative with pendant hydroxyl groups was prepared and conjugated to a platinum(IV) [Pt(IV)] prodrug, c,t,c-[Pt(NH(3))(2)(O(2)CCH(2)CH(2)COOH)(OH)Cl(2)] [PLA-Pt(IV)]. A blend of PLA-Pt(IV) functionalized polymer and carboxyl-terminated poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymer in the presence or absence of Dtxl, was converted, in microfluidic channels, to NPs with a diameter of ∼100 nm. This process resulted in excellent encapsulation efficiency (EE) and high loading of both hydrophilic platinum prodrug and hydrophobic Dtxl with reproducible EEs and loadings. The surface of the NPs was derivatized with the A10 aptamer, which binds to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate cancer cells. These NPs undergo controlled release of both drugs over a period of 48-72 h.

Androgen-deprivation therapy (hormone therapy) is an effective treatment of this disease when progressed to an advanced stage. Despite impressive responses, such treatment when applied on a continuous basis is not curative and eventually culminates in androgen-independent disease. On the other hand, intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) was first conceived as a potential way of delaying progression to androgen-independence, in addition offering the possibility of reducing adverse effects and improving the quality of life. Although the validity of this approach has been confirmed in several clinical studies, the optimal scheduling of the cycles of on- and off-treatment remains to be explored. In the present article, we show that IAS lends itself to mathematical modelling with hybrid dynamical systems and that the model we have developed can be used to select the best strategy for keeping prostate cancer in an androgen-dependent state as long as possible. Our results also suggest that the current way of using IAS exceeds what is necessary for optimal control; in fact, we have found that to achieve optimal control, the amount of therapy (dose and duration of drugs) can be reduced by a factor of one half.""","""['Taiji Suzuki', 'Nicholas Bruchovsky', 'Kazuyuki Aihara']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Philos Trans A Math Phys Eng Sci""","""['Mathematical modelling of prostate cancer growth and its application to hormone therapy.', 'Nonlinear system identification for prostate cancer and optimality of intermittent androgen suppression therapy.', 'Endocrine treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Intermittent androgen deprivation for patients with recurrent/metastatic prostate cancer.', 'A new protocol for intermittent androgen suppression therapy of prostate cancer with unstable saddle-point dynamics.', 'Personalizing Androgen Suppression for Prostate Cancer Using Mathematical Modeling.', 'Intermittent Androgen Suppression: Estimating Parameters for Individual Patients Based on Initial PSA Data in Response to Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Predicting disease progression from short biomarker series using expert advice algorithm.', 'A partial differential equation model and its reduction to an ordinary differential equation model for prostate tumor growth under intermittent hormone therapy.', 'Quantitative mathematical modeling of PSA dynamics of prostate cancer patients treated with intermittent androgen suppression.']"""

Safety and efficacy in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms. Prospective study on 320 patients""","""Introduction:   Serenoa repens (saw palmetto) has been employed for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) for several years. Its mechanism of action is believed to be due to antiandrogenic, antiproliferative and antinflammatory properties. An association of Serenoa with the nettle ""Urtica dioica"" showing antiproliferative activity and the pine ""Pinus pinaster"" derivative, showing antinflammatory action, has been proposed in recent years. Such an action is hoped to act not only by reducing LUTS but also by preventing the development of prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   During the years 2007 and 2008, 320 patients suffering from LUTS were treated with an association of Serenoa repens 320 mg, Urtica dioica 120 mg and Pinus pinaster 5 mg, named IPBTRE. This treatment was administered to all patients for a minimal duration of 30 days to a maximum of a year, either alone or in association with antibiotics or alpha-blockers, if needed. Outcome analysis was based on evaluation of symptoms, prostate volume and maximum flow rate (Qmax).  Results:   From a careful analysis of the data collected in our database, the following observations can be made: ages varied between 19 and 78 years. The patients were affected by BPH in 46% of cases, chronic prostatitis syndrome in 43%, chronic genital-pelvic pain in 7% and other conditions in 4%, the absolute numbers being 147, 138, 22 and 7 patients, respectively. No untoward side effect was reported in any case. Variations in symptom score could be fully evaluated only in 80 of 320 patients (25%), of whom 68 (85%) reported a significant benefit, with special reference to an improvement of pain, urgency, strangury and nocturia. Data on variations in prostate volume, as measured by digital rectal examination, were available in 84 (26.5%) patients. No significant change was observed. Qmax after treatment was measured in 83 (26%) patients. It did not show significant changes from the initial values.  Discussion:   The association tested in our study appeared to be safe and well tolerated. No changes in flow rate and prostate volume were observed, but a marked reduction of LUTS was observed in 85% of evaluable cases, especially with regard to pain and irritative symptoms. Whether or not such an association may display a prevention of prostate cancer, may be investigated in additional studies.""","""['C Pavone', 'D Abbadessa', 'M L Tarantino', 'I Oxenius', 'A Laganà', 'A Lupo', 'M Rinella']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['Nutraceutical treatment and prevention of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Phytotherapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Observational database serenoa repens (DOSSER): overview, analysis and results.

Here, using a promoter-reporter assay and EMSA, we demonstrate that NF-κB regulates lzts2 transcription by directly binding to the lzts2 promoter, and that NF-κB-induced lzts2 transcription differs by cell types. Modulation of lzts2 expression by lentiviral techniques affected proliferation and tumorigenicity of several cancer cell lines such as breast, colon, prostate cancer, and glioma, but did not affect cisplatin sensitivity or cell migration.

Genome-wide screening of androgen target genes provides useful information to understand a global view of AR-mediated gene network in PCa. In this study, we performed 5'-cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) to determine androgen-regulated transcription start sites (TSSs) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on array (ChIP-chip) analysis to identify AR binding sites (ARBSs) and histone H3 acetylated (AcH3) sites in the human genome. CAGE determined 13 110 distinct, androgen-regulated TSSs (P<0.01), and ChIP-chip analysis identified 2872 androgen-dependent ARBSs (P<1e-5) and 25 945 AcH3 sites (P<1e-4). Both androgen-regulated coding genes and noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) were determined as androgen target genes. Besides prototypic androgen-regulated TSSs in annotated gene promoter regions, there are many androgen-dependent TSSs that are widely distributed throughout the genome, including those in antisense (AS) direction of RefSeq genes. Several pairs of sense/antisense promoters were newly identified within single RefSeq gene regions. The integration of CAGE and ChIP-chip analyses successfully identified a cluster of androgen-inducible miRNAs, as exemplified by the miR-125b-2 cluster on chromosome 21.

Hypoxia is a widespread feature of most solid tumors. Here, we studied the effects of hypoxia on PTHrP expression. We found that PTHrP is transcriptionally induced by prolonged (48 h) hypoxia in multiple human cancer and endothelial cell lines. Pharmacological up or downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) resulted in induction or reduction of PTHrP levels, respectively, implying that PTHrP hypoxic induction is mediated by HIF pathway. Analysis of PTHrP promoter revealed that both HIF-1α and HIF-2α subunits bind to specific hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE) within the P2 promoter of PTHrP. However, only HIF-2α can drive direct transcriptional activation, which can be abolished by mutation in the specific HRE. To the best of our knowledge, these results provide for the first time evidence that PTHrP is regulated by hypoxia in cancer and endothelial cells through the HIF-2 pathway. We suggest that HIF-2 induced by intratumoral hypoxia or by other genetic alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia of malignancy and cancer aggressiveness by stimulation of PTHrP expression.""","""['Michal Manisterski', 'Maya Golan', 'Sharon Amir', 'Yosef Weisman', 'Nicola J Mabjeesh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Opposite functions of HIF-α isoforms in VEGF induction by TGF-β1 under non-hypoxic conditions.', 'Topotecan inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor production and angiogenic activity induced by hypoxia in human neuroblastoma by targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and -2alpha.', 'Role of ETS transcription factors in the hypoxia-inducible factor-2 target gene selection.', 'Parathyroid hormone-related protein is induced by hypoxia and promotes expression of the differentiated phenotype of human articular chondrocytes.', 'Deletion of an intronic HIF-2α binding site suppresses hypoxia-induced WT1 expression.', 'Role of the Hypoxic-Secretome in Seed and Soil Metastatic Preparation.', 'Hypoxia inducible factor signaling in breast tumors controls spontaneous tumor dissemination in a site-specific manner.', 'From Good to Bad: The Opposing Effects of PTHrP on Tumor Growth, Dormancy, and Metastasis Throughout Cancer Progression.', 'Ascorbate modulates the hypoxic pathway by increasing intracellular activity of the HIF hydroxylases in renal cell carcinoma cells.', 'Hypoxic Microenvironment and Metastatic Bone Disease.']"""

After SNORD7 was already shown an inappropriate reference gene in preliminary experiments using total RNA pools, we studied the expression of the putative reference genes in tissue and normal adjacent tissue sample pairs from 76 men with untreated prostate carcinoma collected after radical prostatectomy. hsa-miR-130b and RNU6-2 showed no significantly different expression between the matched malignant and non-malignant tissue samples, whereas hsa-miR-16 was significantly underexpressed in malignant tissue.

Unlike in classical lipogenic tissues, this process has been implicated in membrane production required for rapid cell proliferation. Here, to gain further insight into the consequences of tumor-associated fatty acid synthesis, we have mimicked the lipogenic phenotype of cancer cells in Xenopus embryos by microinjection of RNA encoding the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c). Dramatic morphologic changes were observed that could be linked to alterations in Wnt and Hedgehog signaling, and ultimately to a distortion of the primary cilium. This is a sophisticated microtubular sensory organelle that is expressed on the surface of nearly every cell type and that is lost in many cancers. SREBP1c-induced loss of the primary cilium could be confirmed in mammalian Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and was mediated by changes in the supply of fatty acids. Conversely, inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in highly lipogenic human prostate cancer cells restored the formation of the primary cilium. Lipid-induced ciliary loss was associated with mislocalization of apical proteins, distortion of cell polarization, and aberrant epithelial tissue development as revealed in three-dimensional cultures of MDCK cells and in the developing mouse prostate. These data imply that tumor-associated lipogenesis, in addition to rendering cells more autonomous in terms of lipid supply, disturbs cilium formation and contributes to impaired environmental sensing, aberrant signaling, and distortion of polarized tissue architecture, which are all hallmarks of cancer.""","""['Nicolas Willemarck', 'Evelien Rysman', 'Koen Brusselmans', 'Griet Van Imschoot', 'Frank Vanderhoydonc', 'Katrien Moerloose', 'Evelyne Lerut', 'Guido Verhoeven', 'Frans van Roy', 'Kris Vleminckx', 'Johannes V Swinnen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Androgens, lipogenesis and prostate cancer.', 'Novel signaling molecules implicated in tumor-associated fatty acid synthase-dependent breast cancer cell proliferation and survival: Role of exogenous dietary fatty acids, p53-p21WAF1/CIP1, ERK1/2 MAPK, p27KIP1, BRCA1, and NF-kappaB.', 'Beta1-integrins in the primary cilium of MDCK cells potentiate fibronectin-induced Ca2+ signaling.', 'Primary cilium suppression by SREBP1c involves distortion of vesicular trafficking by PLA2G3.', 'Sensory cilia and integration of signal transduction in human health and disease.', 'Primary cilia and lipid raft dynamics.', 'Functional aspects of primary cilium in signaling, assembly and microenvironment in cancer.', 'Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 5 (SCD5), a Δ-9 fatty acyl desaturase in search of a function.', 'Ciliary signalling in cancer.', 'Mechanisms for nonmitotic activation of Aurora-A at cilia.']"""

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel plus prednisone with those of mitoxantrone plus prednisone in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with progressive disease after docetaxel-based treatment.  Methods:   We undertook an open-label randomised phase 3 trial in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had received previous hormone therapy, but whose disease had progressed during or after treatment with a docetaxel-containing regimen. Participants were treated with 10 mg oral prednisone daily, and were randomly assigned to receive either 12 mg/m(2) mitoxantrone intravenously over 15-30 min or 25 mg/m(2) cabazitaxel intravenously over 1 h every 3 weeks. The random allocation schedule was computer-generated; patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation, but the study team was masked to the data analysis. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00417079.  Findings:   755 men were allocated to treatment groups (377 mitoxantrone, 378 cabazitaxel) and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At the cutoff for the final analysis (Sept 25, 2009), median survival was 15·1 months (95% CI 14·1-16·3) in the cabazitaxel group and 12·7 months (11·6-13·7) in the mitoxantrone group. The hazard ratio for death of men treated with cabazitaxel compared with those taking mitoxantrone was 0·70 (95% CI 0·59-0·83, p<0·0001). Median progression-free survival was 2·8 months (95% CI 2·4-3·0) in the cabazitaxel group and 1·4 months (1·4-1·7) in the mitoxantrone group (HR 0·74, 0·64-0·86, p<0·0001). The most common clinically significant grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (cabazitaxel, 303 [82%] patients vs mitoxantrone, 215 [58%]) and diarrhoea (23 [6%] vs one [<1%]). 28 (8%) patients in the cabazitaxel group and five (1%) in the mitoxantrone group had febrile neutropenia.

We also determined the effect of marker registration on the measured SV displacement and its impact on margin design.  Methods and materials:   SV displacement was determined relative to marker registration by using 296 cone beam computed tomography scans of 13 prostate cancer patients with implanted markers. SV were individually registered in the transverse plane, based on gray-value information. The target registration error (TRE) for the SV due to marker registration inaccuracies was estimated. Correlations between prostate gland rotations and SV displacement and between individual SV displacements were determined.  Results:   The SV registration success rate was 99%. Displacement amounts of both SVs were comparable. Systematic and random residual SV displacements were 1.6 mm and 2.0 mm in the left-right direction, respectively, and 2.8 mm and 3.1 mm in the anteroposterior (AP) direction, respectively. Rotation correction did not reduce residual SV displacement. Prostate gland rotation around the left-right axis correlated with SV AP displacement (R(2) = 42%); a correlation existed between both SVs for AP displacement (R(2) = 62%); considerable correlation existed between random errors of SV displacement and TRE (R(2) = 34%).  Conclusions:   Considerable residual SV displacement exists in marker-based IGRT. Rotation correction barely reduced SV displacement, rather, a larger SV displacement was shown relative to the prostate gland that was not captured by the marker position. Marker registration error partly explains SV displacement when correcting for rotations. Correcting for rotations, therefore, is not advisable when SV are part of the target volume. Margin design for SVs should take these uncertainties into account.""","""['Monique H P Smitsmans', 'Josien de Bois', 'Jan-Jakob Sonke', 'Charles N Catton', 'David A Jaffray', 'Joos V Lebesque', 'Marcel van Herk']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Hybrid registration of prostate and seminal vesicles for image guided radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric implications of residual seminal vesicle motion in fiducial-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'A novel approach for evaluation of prostate deformation and associated dosimetric implications in IGRT of the prostate.', 'Seminal vesicle inter- and intra-fraction motion during radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A review.', 'ESTRO ACROP consensus guideline on the use of image guided radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Proximal seminal vesicle displacement and margins for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Comparison of prostate verification with implanted gold markers in tissue surrounding the prostate and pelvic bony anatomy for external beam radiation therapy following low-dose-rate brachytherapy: a prospective clinical trial.', 'Seminal vesicle interfraction displacement and margins in image guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Nitric oxide (NO) is a radiosensitiser of mammalian cells. NO-NSAIDs are a potential means of delivering NO to prostate cancer cells. This study aimed to determine the effect and mechanism of action of NO-sulindac and radiation, on prostate cancer cells and stroma, under normoxia (21% oxygen) and chronic hypoxia (0.2% oxygen). Using clonogenic assays, at a surviving fraction of 10% the sensitisation enhancement ratios of radiation plus NO-sulindac over radiation alone on PC-3 cells were 1.22 and 1.42 under normoxia and hypoxia, respectively. 3D culture of PC-3 cells revealed significantly reduced sphere diameter in irradiated spheres treated with NO-sulindac. Neither NO-sulindac nor sulindac radiosensitised prostate stromal cells under normoxia or hypoxia. HIF-1α protein levels were reduced by NO-sulindac exposure and radiation at 21 and 0.2% oxygen. Alkaline Comet assay analysis suggested an increased rate of single strand DNA breaks and slower repair of these lesions in PC-3 cells treated with NO-sulindac prior to irradiation. There was a higher level of γ-H2AX production and hence double strand DNA breaks following irradiation of NO-sulindac treated PC-3 cells. At all radiation doses and oxygen levels tested, treatment of 2D and 3D cultures of PC-3 cells with NO-sulindac prior to irradiation radiosensitised PC-3, with minimal effect on stromal cells. Hypoxia response inhibition and increased DNA double strand breaks are potential mechanisms of action.

We evaluated the association of changes in ALP within 90 days with OS in men with CRPC and bone metastases treated with docetaxel or mitoxantrone in the TAX327 trial.  Materials and methods:   Eligible patients included those with bony metastatic disease, baseline ALP ≥ 120 u/L (upper limit of normal) and ≥2 post-therapy measurements of ALP available. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and prognostic potential of change in ALP was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Surrogacy was calculated by the Likelihood Reduction Factor.  Results:   601 patients met the eligibility criteria. By day 90, 159 patients had ALP normalization (<120 u/L) and 442 patients did not normalize. Normalization of ALP remained prognostic for OS after adjusting for PSA decline ≥ 30% by day 90 (HR 0.79, 95% CI = 0.65-0.97, P = 0.022). Increase in ALP remained prognostic for OS when adjusting for PSA increase ≥ 50% by day 90 (HR 1.69, 95% CI = 1.33-2.14, P < 0.001). ALP changes did not meet criteria for surrogacy for OS.  Conclusions:   For men with CRPC, bone metastasis and high baseline ALP receiving docetaxel or mitoxantrone chemotherapy, normalization of ALP by day 90 was predictive of better survival independent of ≥30% PSA declines. An increase in ALP by day 90 was also predictive of poor survival independent of ≥50% PSA increase.

This study was conducted to determine the predictors of urinary morbidity with Cs-131 PB.  Methods and materials:   A cohort of 159 patients underwent PB with Cs-131 at our institution and were followed by using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) surveys to determine urinary morbidity over time. EPIC scores were obtained preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 and 4 weeks, and 3 and 6 months. Different factors were evaluated to determine their individual effect on urinary morbidity, including patient characteristics, disease characteristics, treatment, and dosimetry. Multivariate analysis of covariance was carried out to identify baseline determinants affecting urinary morbidity. Factors contributing to the need for postoperative catheterization were also studied and reported.  Results:   At 2 weeks, patient age, dose to 90% of the organ (D90), bladder neck maximum dose (D(max)), and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) predicted for worse function. At 4 weeks, age and EBRT continued to predict for worse function. At the 3-month mark, better preoperative urinary function, preoperative alpha blockers, bladder neck D(max), and EBRT predicted for worse urinary morbidity. At 6 months, better preoperative urinary function, preoperative alpha blockers, bladder neck D(max), and EBRT were predictive of increased urinary problems. High bladder neck D(max) and poor preoperative urinary function predicted for the need for catheterization.  Conclusions:   The use of EBRT plus Cs-131 PB predicts for worse urinary toxicity at all time points studied. Patients should be cautioned about this. Age was a consistent predictor of worsened morbidity immediately following Cs-131 PB, while bladder D(max) was the only consistent dosimetric predictor.

Specific endpoint analyses were prostate D90% (pD90%), rV100% > 1.3 cc, and overall time under anesthesia.  Results:   Final analyses included 91 patients, 43 GA and 48 IBCL. Absolute change in pD90% (ΔpD90%) between intraoperative and postoperative plans was evaluated. Using GA method, the ΔpD90% was -8.1 Gy and -12.8 Gy for I-125 and Pd-103 implants, respectively. Similarly, the IBCL technique resulted in a ΔpD90% of -8.7 Gy and -9.8 Gy for I-125 and Pd-103 implants, respectively. No statistically significant difference in ΔpD90% was found comparing methods. The GA method had two intraoperative and 10 postoperative rV100% >1.3 cc. For IBCL, five intraoperative and eight postoperative plans had rV100% >1.3 cc. For GA, the mean time under anesthesia was 75 min and 87 min for Pd-103 and I-125 implants, respectively. For IBCL, the mean time was 86 and 98 min for Pd-103 and I-125. There was a statistical difference between the methods when comparing mean time under anesthesia.  Conclusions:   Dosimetrically relevant endpoints were equivalent between the two methods. Currently, time under anesthesia is longer using the IBCL technique but has decreased over time.

We aimed to develop a nomogram to preoperatively predict the risk of AUR.  Methods:   Using the preoperative data of 714 consecutive patients who underwent I-125 prostate brachytherapy between 2005 and 2008 at our department, we modeled the probability of AUR. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the predictive ability of a set of pretreatment predictors and the additional value of a new risk factor (the extent of prostate protrusion into the bladder). The performance of the final model was assessed with calibration and discrimination measures.  Results:   Of the 714 patients, 57 patients (8.0%) developed AUR after implantation. Multivariate analysis showed that the combination of prostate volume, IPSS score, neoadjuvant hormonal treatment and the extent of prostate protrusion contribute to the prediction of AUR. The discriminative value (receiver operator characteristic area, ROC) of the basic model (including prostate volume, International Prostate Symptom Score, and neoadjuvant hormonal treatment) to predict the development of AUR was 0.70. The addition of prostate protrusion significantly increased the discriminative power of the model (ROC 0.82). Calibration of this final model was good. The nomogram showed that among patients with a low sum score (<18 points), the risk of AUR was only 0%-5%. However, in patients with a high sum score (>35 points), the risk of AUR was more than 20%.  Conclusion:   This nomogram is a useful tool for physicians to predict the risk of AUR after I-125 prostate brachytherapy.

We hypothesized that containing, or at least immobilizing, the CSCs in a nano-self-assembling material might help prevent prostate tumor progression or metastasis. CSCs were plated in three conditions: 1) placed in 1% concentration self-assembled peptide (SAP) preequilibrate with culture medium; 2) placed in 3% concentration SAP preequilibrate with culture medium; and 3) in nonadherent culture. All were grown for 14 days, after which the cells in both 1% and 3% concentrations were washed out of the SAP and grown for an additional 14 days. Here we report that CSCs from prostate cancer cell lines remained quiescent for more than 28 days when embedded in SAP. When the prostate CSCs were embedded in 1% and 3% SAP, most of the CSCs remained single cells 14 days after plating in a nonadherent plate; no prostaspheres could be detected 14 days after plating, suggesting that self-renewal was significantly suppressed. In the controls, prostate CSCs began to divide 1 day after plating in a nonadherent plate and prostaspheres were visible at day 10, indicating the active self-renewal property of the prostate CSCs. Our findings suggest that SAP can completely inhibit a prostate CSC from self-renewal while preserving its viability and CSC property.

We therefore performed a prospective study on 55 consecutive male symptomatic patients, aged from 54 to 81 years: 11 after radiotherapy, 17 after BCG and 27 after Mitomicyn C bladder instillations ,12 of whom in combination with bladder hyperthermia.?All subjects underwent bladder instillations with sodium hyaluronate 40 mg in 50 mL weekly for 8 to 24 weeks depending on the time needed to the resolution of the symptoms.?During the first 4 weeks 32 mg of dexamethasone were also instilled intravesically, mixed with hyaluronate, in order to obtain a stronger anti-inflammatory activity due also to its higher capacity of penetration in the bladder mucosa. The symptoms intensity was evaluated through a Visual Analogue Score (VAS) of the discomfort and pain perceived from 0 to 10, and bladder capacity was recorded with micturition diary before and after the treatment.?After 16 weeks VAS improved in every case of chemical cystitis from an initial mean value of 8.6 to a final mean value of 1(with 3 as a maximum value recorded). The difference was highly significant (p <0.001). Bladder capacity increased in all cases of chemical cystitis from a mean value of 56 to 276 mL with a highly significant improvement (p <0.001) and in all cases of post-actinic cystitis from a mean bladder capacity of 89 to a final mean value of 239 mL, with a significant improvement (p= 0.05). We did not observe any side effect due to our treatment. Therefore, we can conclude that bladder instillation with sodium hyaluronate for at least 8 weeks and dexamethasone in the first 4 weeks can solve the symptoms of iatrogenic cystitis secondary to chemo-immunotherapy or pelvic radiotherapy, without incurring in side effects.

Methods:   Subjects with an increasing PSA level suggestive of prostate cancer were enrolled in this study. FDG-PET/CT was performed prior to prostate biopsy and the findings were compared with the pathological results.  Results:   Fifty subjects with an elevated serum PSA level took part in this study. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of FDG-PET/CT in the prostate were 51.9% (27/52 areas), 75.7% (112/148 areas) and 42.9% (27/63 areas), respectively; those in the peripheral zone were 73.3% (22/30 areas), 64.3% (45/70 areas) and 46.8% (22/47 areas), respectively; and those in the central gland were 22.7% (5/22 areas), 85.9% (67/78 areas) and 31.3% (5/16 areas), respectively.

The 4 samples predicted to be negative by sequencing were negative with the CST antibody, however, one was positive with Dako; as a result we chose the CST antibody for our assay. The assay was validated on an automated platform using 50 formalin fixed and paraffin embedded colon, lung, prostate and breast adenocarcinoma cases.

We therefore used Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines established from prospectively collected peripheral blood samples to evaluate lung cancer risk in relation to three DNA repair assays: alkaline Comet assay, host cell reactivation (HCR) assay with the mutagen benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide and the bleomycin mutagen sensitivity assay.

In unconditional logistic regression analyses, statistically significantly increased lung cancer odds ratios (OR(adjusted)) were observed for bleomycin mutagen sensitivity as quartiles of chromatid breaks/cell [relative to the lowest quartile, OR = 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5-2.5; OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 0.7-3.1; OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.0-4.4, respectively, P(trend) = 0.04]. The magnitude of the association between the bleomycin assay and lung cancer risk was modest compared with those reported in previous lung cancer studies but was strengthened when we included only incident cases diagnosed more than a year after blood collection (P(trend) = 0.02), supporting the notion the assay may be a measure of cancer susceptibility.

One of the most commonly used methods to isolate a more aggressive sub-population of cells utilizes cell sorting based on expression of certain cell adhesion molecules. A recently established method we developed is to isolate these more aggressive cells based on their properties of increased invasive ability. These more invasive cells have been previously characterized as tumor initiating cells (TICs) that have a stem-like genomic signature and express a number of stem cell genes including Oct3/4 and Nanog and are more tumorigenic compared to their 'non-invasive' counterpart. They also have a profile reminiscent of cells undergoing a classic pattern of epithelial to mesenchymal transition or EMT. Using this model of invasion, we sought to investigate which genes are under epigenetic control in this rare population of cells. Epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation, are key events regulating the process of normal human development. To determine the specific methylation pattern in these invasive prostate cells, and if any developmental genes were being differentially regulated, we analyzed differences in global CpG promoter methylation.  Results:   Differentially methylated genes were determined and select genes were chosen for additional analyses. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase BMX and transcription factor SOX1 were found to play a significant role in invasion. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed the methylated gene list frequently displayed genes from the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Cells which have decreased levels of the targets BMX and SOX1 also display loss of STAT3 activity. Finally, using Oncomine, it was determined that more aggressive metastatic prostate cancers in humans also have higher levels of both Stat3 and Sox1.  Conclusions:   Using this method we can begin to understand which genes are epigenetically regulated in the invasive population compared to the bulk tumor cells. These aggressive sub-populations of cells may be linked to the cancer stem cell hypothesis, making their patterns of epigenetic regulation very attractive for biomarker analysis.""","""['Lesley A Mathews', 'Elaine M Hurt', 'Xiaohu Zhang', 'William L Farrar']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['The ETS factor ESE3/EHF represses IL-6 preventing STAT3 activation and expansion of the prostate cancer stem-like compartment.', 'Coexpression of gene Oct4 and Nanog initiates stem cell characteristics in hepatocellular carcinoma and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition through activation of Stat3/Snail signaling.', 'Expression of pluripotent stem cell reprogramming factors by prostate tumor initiating cells.', 'Aspects of the Epigenetic Regulation of EMT Related to Cancer Metastasis.', 'Promoter hypermethylation in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical significance of determining the hypermethylation of the RUNX3 gene promoter and its cohypermethylation with the BRCA1 gene for patients with breast cancer.', 'SOX1 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor by Repressing HES1 in Lung Cancer.', 'High Expression of PDLIM2 Predicts a Poor Prognosis in Prostate Cancer and Is Correlated with Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Immune Cell Infiltration.', 'The MRTF-A/miR-155/SOX1 pathway mediates gastric cancer migration and invasion.', 'Generation of High-Throughput Three-Dimensional Tumor Spheroids for Drug Screening.']"""

Methods:   Guided by a modified Stress-Coping Model, this study used multilevel modeling to analyze longitudinal data from a randomized clinical trial that tested a family-based intervention to improve QOL in couples managing PCa. Patients and partners from the usual-care control group (N = 134 dyads) independently completed the measurements at baseline, and at 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups.  Results:   Correlations of QOL between patients and partners over time were small to moderate. Patients' lower education level, partners' older age, higher family income, and localized cancer at baseline were associated with better QOL in couples. Over time, couples' QOL improved as their social support and cancer-related dyadic communication increased and as couples' uncertainty, general symptoms, and patients' prostate cancer-related sexual and hormonal symptoms decreased.  Conclusions:   Evidence indicates that couples' QOL during cancer survivorship is affected by multiple contextual factors (e.g., baseline demographics and time-varying psychosocial factors and symptoms).

Overall, PHS lowered the magnitude of the effect of hormones on cell growth in comparison to CTS.

Digital versatile disk (DVD) recordings were retrieved for scrutiny of the whole dissection process of Denonvilliers' fascia and its contiguous anatomic structures.  Results:   As highlighted in the attached video footage, for nearly all male patients (91%, n = 58), the boundaries of Denonvilliers' fascia could be clearly recognized by laparoscopy. Denonvilliers' fascia, varying in nature from a fragile translucent fibrous layer to a tough leathery membrane, manifests itself as a trapezoidal ""apron"" covering the glistening fatty tissues of the anterior mesorectum. Anterior dissection in TME can be efficiently continued downwards ""in front of"" Denonvilliers' fascia. When the prostate is reached, the natural surgical plane halts, and the dissection plane should be shifted to behind this fascia. In contrast, in female patients, Denonvilliers' fascia was much less obvious as a distinct fibrous layer than in male patients. The most appropriate term for the structure in between the rectum and vagina may be rectovaginal septum, in which there is no natural surgical plane, rather than Denonvilliers' fascia.

Syndecan-1 (SDC-1), a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, supports the integrity of the epithelial compartment. In tumor cells of epithelial lineage, SDC-1 is generally downregulated. This may result in perturbation of homeostasis and lead to progression of malignancy. Our studies have shown that the n-3 PUFA species, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), increases SDC-1 expression in prostate tissues of Pten knockout (Pten(P-/-)) mice/cells and human prostate cancer cells. We have now determined that DHA-mediated up-regulation of SDC-1 induces apoptosis. Bovine serum albumin-bound DHA and exogenous human recombinant SDC-1 ecotodomain were delivered to PC3 and LNCaP cells in the presence or absence of SDC-1 small interfering (si)RNA. In the presence of control siRNA, both DHA and SDC-1 ectodomain induced apoptosis, whereas SDC-1 silencing blocked DHA-induced but not SDC-1 ectodomain-induced apoptosis. Downstream effectors of SDC-1 signaling linked to n-3 PUFA-induced apoptosis involved the 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt/Bad integrating network. A diet enriched in n-3 PUFA decreased phosphorylation of PDK1, Akt (T308), and Bad in prostates of Pten(P-/-) mice. Similar results were observed in human prostate cancer cells in response to DHA and SDC-1 ectodomain. The effect of DHA on PDK1/Akt/Bad signaling was abrogated by SDC-1 siRNA.

However, complete eradication of PCa is unusual, and recurrent disease is evident within approximately 2 years in high-risk patients. Clinical evidence suggests that combining ADT with radiotherapy improves local control and disease-free survival in these patients compared with radiotherapy alone. We investigated whether vascularization of androgen-sensitive PCa xenografts changed after ADT and whether such therapy affected radiation response. CWR22 xenografts received combinations of ADT by castration (CWR22-cas) and 15 Gy of single-dose irradiation. At a shortest tumor diameter of 8 mm, vascularization was visualized by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging before radiation and 1 and 9 days after radiation. Voxel-wise quantitative modeling of contrast enhancement curves extracted the hemodynamic parameter K(trans), reflecting a combination of permeability, density, and blood flow. Tumor volumes and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were monitored during the experiment. The results showed that K(trans) of CWR22-cas tumors 36±4 days after ADT was 47.1% higher than K(trans) of CWR22 tumors (P = .01). CWR22-cas tumors showed no significant changes in K(trans) after radiation, whereas K(trans) of CWR22 tumors at day 1 decreased compared with pretreatment values (P = .04) before a continuous increase from day 1 to day 9 followed (P = .01).

KIT is highly expressed in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs)-the presumed cell of origin for GIST-as well as in haematopoietic stem cells, melanocytes, mast cells and germ cells. Yet, families harbouring germline activating KIT mutations and mice with knock-in Kit mutations almost exclusively develop ICC hyperplasia and GIST, suggesting that the cellular context is important for KIT to mediate oncogenesis. Here we show that the ETS family member ETV1 is highly expressed in the subtypes of ICCs sensitive to oncogenic KIT mediated transformation, and is required for their development. In addition, ETV1 is universally highly expressed in GISTs and is required for growth of imatinib-sensitive and resistant GIST cell lines. Transcriptome profiling and global analyses of ETV1-binding sites suggest that ETV1 is a master regulator of an ICC-GIST-specific transcription network mainly through enhancer binding. The ETV1 transcriptional program is further regulated by activated KIT, which prolongs ETV1 protein stability and cooperates with ETV1 to promote tumorigenesis. We propose that GIST arises from ICCs with high levels of endogenous ETV1 expression that, when coupled with an activating KIT mutation, drives an oncogenic ETS transcriptional program.

It results from the in frame deletion of exons 2-7 and the generation of a novel glycine residue at the junction of exons 1 and 8. This novel juxtaposition of amino acids within the extra-cellular domain of the EGF receptor creates a tumor specific and immunogenic epitope. EGFRvIII expression has been seen in many tumor types including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), breast adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer, but has been rarely observed in normal tissue. Because this variant is tumor specific and highly immunogenic, it can be used for both a diagnostic marker as well as a target for immunotherapy. Unfortunately many of the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against EGFRvIII have cross reactivity to wild type EGFR or other non-specific proteins. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody to EGFRvIII is not readily available to the scientific community.  Results:   In this study, we have developed a recombinant antibody that is specific for EGFRvIII, has little cross reactivity for the wild type receptor, and which can be easily produced. We initially designed a recombinant antibody with two anti-EGFRvIII single chain Fv's linked together and a human IgG1 Fc component. To enhance the specificity of this antibody for EGFRvIII, we mutated tyrosine H59 of the CDRH2 domain and tyrosine H105 of the CDRH3 domain to phenylalanine for both the anti-EGFRvIII sequence inserts. This mutated recombinant antibody, called RAb(DMvIII), specifically detects EGFRvIII expression in EGFRvIII expressing cell lines as well as in EGFRvIII expressing GBM primary tissue by western blot, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) and FACS analysis. It does not recognize wild type EGFR in any of these assays. The affinity of this antibody for EGFRvIII peptide is 1.7 × 10⁷ M⁻¹ as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  Conclusion:   This recombinant antibody thus holds great potential to be used as a research reagent and diagnostic tool in research laboratories and clinics because of its high quality, easy viability and unique versatility. This antibody is also a strong candidate to be investigated for further in vivo therapeutic studies.""","""['Puja Gupta', 'Shuang-Yin Han', 'Marina Holgado-Madruga', 'Siddhartha S Mitra', 'Gordon Li', 'Ryan T Nitta', 'Albert J Wong']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Biotechnol""","""['Production and characterization of a new antibody specific for the mutant EGF receptor, EGFRvIII, in Camelus bactrianus.', 'Isolation and characterization of a novel human scFv inhibiting EGFR vIII expressing cancers.', 'Generation of humanized single-chain fragment variable immunotherapeutic against EGFR variant III using baculovirus expression system and in vitro validation.', 'The EGFR variant III mutant as a target for immunotherapy of glioblastoma multiforme.', 'EGFRvIII as a promising target for antibody-based brain tumor therapy.', 'Antigen-Dependent Inducible T-Cell Reporter System for PET Imaging of Breast Cancer and Glioblastoma.', 'Application of blood brain barrier models in pre-clinical assessment of glioblastoma-targeting CAR-T based immunotherapies.', 'Exploring the role of epidermal growth factor receptor variant III in meningeal tumors.', 'EGFRvIII-specific CAR-T cells produced by piggyBac transposon exhibit efficient growth suppression against hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'T-Cell based therapies for overcoming neuroanatomical and immunosuppressive challenges within the glioma microenvironment.']"""

In this study, we showed that BMSCs have the ability to migrate toward various cancer cells, including prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and incorporating into the tumor mass. When infected with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene by lentiviral transduction, TK-BMSCs maintained their tumor tropism capabilities and significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous PC3 prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice, in the presence of prodrug ganciclovir (GCV). Xenogenic TK-BMSCs also survived and exerted a significant antitumor effect in an animal model bearing metastastic RIF-1 (fibrosarcoma) tumor in the presence of prodrug GCV. The present study demonstrated that overexpression of TK in BMSCs did not affect their multidifferentiation potentials and their specific homing capacities toward the tumor mass, and the TK-BMSCs alone did not cause any harmful side effects in vivo.

Results:   In all the normal samples tested, the results were negative; there was only a nonspecific cytoplasmatic response in the subepithelial glands (false positives). In the neoplastic tissue, 2 samples had a weak nuclear focal positivity for estrogen and progesterone receptors; all 15 subjects studied were negative for androgen receptors.  Conclusions:   Since our data show that sex hormone receptors are absent in the vocal cords, other theories must be considered to explain the fact that hormones influence the quality of the voice.

The non-COX-2 targets of celecoxib, however, are still a matter of research. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) has been implicated in prostate and colon carcinogenesis, but little is known about the potential role of LTB4 in celecoxib-mediated anticancer effect. In this study, we evaluated whether LTB4 was involved in celecoxib-mediated inhibitory effect on human colon cancer HT-29 cells and human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Our data showed that survival of both cell lines was obviously suppressed after celecoxib treatment for 72 h in a concentration-dependent manner. However, only in HT-29 cells, this inhibitory effect could be reversed by LTB4, which promoted survival of HT-29 cells rather than PC-3 cells. Consistent with these results, lioxygenase (LOX) potent inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) had a higher inhibitory effect on HT-29 cells than PC-3 cells. Additionally, ELISA results showed that celecoxib could suppress expression of LTB4 in both cell lines, whereas, inhibition of PGE2 was only detected in HT-29 cells.

We therefore investigated whether XMRV infection could be found in patients with prostate cancer from the southern United States, and we sought to verify the association with the R462Q.  Methods:   Prostate tissue specimens of 144 patients with prostate cancer from the southern United States were genotyped for R462Q by real time polymerase chain reaction allelic discrimination and were screened for XMRV proviral DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction specific for the env gene.  Results:   The R462Q polymorphism was found at an allelic frequency of 0.33. XMRV was detected in 32 (22%) of the 144 patients. Patients were significantly more likely to test positive for XMRV in both tumor and normal tissue rather than either alone (κ = 0.64). A positive result for XMRV was not significantly correlated with the R462Q polymorphism (P = .82) or clinical pathological parameters of prostate cancer, including Gleason score (P = .29).  Conclusions:   XMRV is detectable in normal and tumor prostate tissue from patients with prostate cancer, independent of R462Q.

However, with the advent of personalized medicine, a need for greater versatility in ligand-targeted drug design has emerged, where each tumor-targeting ligand should be capable of delivering a variety of therapeutic agents to the same tumor, each therapeutic agent being selected for its activity on a specific patient's cancer. In this report, we describe the use of a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting ligand to deliver multiple unrelated cytotoxic drugs to human prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells. We demonstrate that the PSMA-specific ligand, 2-[3-(1, 3-dicarboxy propyl)ureido] pentanedioic acid, is capable of mediating the targeted killing of LNCaP cells with many different therapeutic warheads.

Molecular imaging probes based on dual-receptor targeting peptide heterodimers exhibit improved tumor targeting efficacy for multi-receptor expressing tumors compared with their parent single-receptor targeting peptide monomers. Previously we have developed bombesin (BBN)-RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide heterodimers, in which BBN and RGD are covalently connected with an asymmetric glutamate linker (J Med Chem 52:425-432, 2009). Although (18)F-labeled heterodimers showed significantly better microPET imaging quality than (18)F-labeled RGD and BBN monomers in a PC-3 xenograft model which co-expresses gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) and integrin αvβ3, tedious heterodimer synthesis due to the asymmetric nature of glutamate linker restricts their clinical applications. In this study, we report the use of a symmetric linker AEADP [AEADP = 3,3'-(2-aminoethylazanediyl)dipropanoic acid] for the synthesis of BBN-RGD peptide heterodimer. The (18)F-labeled heterodimer ((18)F-FB-AEADP-BBN-RGD) showed comparable microPET imaging results with glutamate linked BBN-RGD heterodimers, indicating that the replacement of glutamate linker with AEADP linker did not affect the biological activities of BBN-RGD heterodimer. The heterodimer synthesis is rather easy and straightforward. Because tumors often co-express multiple receptors, the use of a symmetric linker provides a general method of fast assembly of various peptide heterodimers for imaging multi-receptor expressing tumors.""","""['Yongjun Yan', 'Kai Chen', 'Min Yang', 'Xilin Sun', 'Shuanglong Liu', 'Xiaoyuan Chen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Novel 64Cu Labeled RGD2-BBN Heterotrimers for PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', '(18)F, (64)Cu, and (68)Ga labeled RGD-bombesin heterodimeric peptides for PET imaging of breast cancer.', '(68)Ga-labeled NOTA-RGD-BBN peptide for dual integrin and GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.', '68Ga-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-7-triacetic acid-Glu-c(RGDyK)-bombesin7-14.', '64Cu-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-7-triacetic acid-Glu-c(RGDyK)-bombesin7-14.', 'Multifunctional self-assembled peptide nanoparticles for multimodal imaging-guided enhanced theranostic applications against glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Hybridization of tumor homing and mitochondria-targeting peptide domains to design novel dual-imaging self-assembled peptide nanoparticles for theranostic applications.', 'Current State of Radiolabeled Heterobivalent Peptidic Ligands in Tumor Imaging and Therapy.', 'Dual-modal in vivo fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging using a heterodimeric peptide.', 'A Tumor Vascular-Targeted Interlocking Trimodal Nanosystem That Induces and Exploits Hypoxia.']"""

Patients and methods:   Radiopaque fiducial markers (FMs) have been inserted into the prostate in a cohort of 33 patients. The ExacTrac/Novalis Body™ X-ray 6d image acquisition system (BrainLAB AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) was used. Corrections were performed in left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI) direction. Rotational errors around LR (x-axis), AP (y) and SI (z) have been recorded for the first series of nine patients, and since 2007 for the subsequent 24 patients in addition corrected in each fraction by using the Robotic Tilt Module™ and Varian Exact Couch™. After positioning, a second set of X-ray images was acquired for verification purposes. Residual errors were registered and again corrected.  Results:   Standard deviations (SD) of residual translational random errors in LR, AP, and SI coordinates were 1.3, 1.7, and 2.2 mm. Residual random rotation errors were found for lateral (around x, tilt), vertical (around y, table), and longitudinal (around z, roll) and of 3.2°, 1.8°, and 1.5°. Planning target volume (PTV)-clinical target volume (CTV) margins were calculated in LR, AP, and SI direction to 2.3, 3.0, and 3.7 mm. After a second repositioning, the margins could be reduced to 1.8, 2.1, and 1.8 mm.  Conclusion:   On the basis of the residual setup error measurements, the margin required after one to two online X-ray corrections for the patients enrolled in this study would be at minimum 2 mm.

Patients and methods:   Image acquisition followed 1 h after injection of 178-355 MBq (18)F-choline. An intraprostatic lesion (GTV(PET) [gross tumor volume]) was defined by a tumor-to-background SUV (standard uptake value) ratio > 2. A dose of 76 Gy was prescribed to the prostate in 2-Gy fractions, with a simultaneous integrated boost up to 80 Gy.  Results:   A boost volume could not be defined for a single patient. One, two and three or more lesions were found for 36 (55%), 22 (33%) and seven patients (11%). The lobe(s) with a positive biopsy correlated with a GTV(PET) in the same lobe in 63 cases (97%). GTV(PET) was additionally defined in 33 of 41 prostate lobes (80%) with only negative biopsies. GTV(PET), SUV(mean) and SUV(max) were found to be dependent on well-known prognostic risk factors, particularly T-stage and Gleason Score. In multivariate analysis, Gleason Score > 7 resulted as an independent factor for GTV(PET) > 8 cm(3) (hazard ratio 5.5; p = 0.02) and SUV(max) > 5 (hazard ratio 4.4; p = 0.04). Neoadjuvant hormonal treatment (NHT) did not affect SUV levels. The mean EUDs (equivalent uniform doses) to the rectum and bladder (55.9 Gy and 54.8 Gy) were comparable to patients (n = 18) who were treated in the same period without a boost (54.3 Gy and 55.6 Gy).  Conclusion:   Treatment planning with (18)F-choline PET-CT allows the definition of an integrated boost in nearly all prostate cancer patients - including patients after NHT - without considerably affecting EUDs for the organs at risk.

Experimental design:   Prostate needle biopsies from 15 men with high-grade (Gleason 8-10) prostate cancer and 15 age- and body mass index-matched controls were identified from a biospecimen repository. Benign epithelia from each patient were isolated by laser capture microdissection. RNA was isolated, amplified, and used for microarray hybridization. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the expression of specific genes of interest. Alterations in protein expression were analyzed through immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Overall patterns of gene expression in microdissected benign prostate-associated benign epithelium (BABE) and cancer-associated benign epithelium (CABE) were similar. Two genes previously associated with prostate cancer, PSMA and SSTR1, were significantly upregulated in the CABE group (false discovery rate <1%). Expression of other prostate cancer-associated genes, including ERG, HOXC4, HOXC5, and MME, were also increased in CABE by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, although other genes commonly altered in prostate cancer were not different between the BABE and CABE samples. The expression of MME and PSMA proteins on immunohistochemistry coincided with their mRNA alterations.  Conclusion:   Gene expression profiles between benign epithelia of patients with and without prostate cancer are very similar.

Yet little is known about whether patients with different types of cancer vary in their information needs and seeking behaviors. This study used population-based data to address this question.  Methods:   A sample was randomly drawn from the list of patients with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer reported to the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry in 2005. Patients completed a mail survey (N=2010); respective response rates were 68%, 64%, and 61%.  Results:   Colorectal cancer patients reported consistently less information seeking than breast and prostate cancer patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that differences by cancer type were not explained by sex or other demographics, disease stage, or treatment received. These differences were most pronounced among patients with early stage cancer.  Conclusion:   Cancer patients have myriad information needs and use a range of sources to satisfy these needs, but there appear to be important differences in information engagement by cancer type.

Methods and materials:   A total of 217 patients were randomized to either the hypofractionated (n=108) or the conventional (n=109) dose schedule. Most patients (n=156) underwent RT planning and RT using a two-dimensional computed tomography method. Efficacy using the clinical, radiologic, and prostate-specific antigen data in each patient was evaluated before RT and at predetermined intervals after RT until death. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity using the modified Late Effect in Normal Tissue-Subjective Objective Management Analytic (LENT-SOMA) scales was also evaluated before and at intervals after RT to 60 months.  Results:   The whole group has now been followed for a median of 90 months (range, 3-138). Of the 217 patients, 85 developed biochemical relapse (nadir prostate-specific antigen level+2 μg/L), 36 in the hypofractionated and 49 in the conventional group. The biochemical relapse-free, but not overall, survival at 90 months was significantly better with the hypofractionated (53%) than with the conventional (34%) schedule. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity persisted 60 months after RT and did not differ between the two dose schedules. Multivariate analyses revealed that the conventional schedule was of independent prognostic significance, not only for biochemical failure, but also for an increased risk of worse genitourinary symptoms at 4 years.

Methods and materials:   A total of 17 patients underwent treatment setup and were monitored using the Calypso system during radiotherapy. On average, the prostate tracking measurements were performed for 8 min/fraction for 28 fractions for each patient. For both patient couch shift data and intrafraction organ motion data, the systematic and random errors were obtained from the patient population. The planning target volume margins were calculated using the van Herk formula. Two intervention strategies were simulated using the tracking data: the deviation threshold and period. The related planning target volume margins, time costs, and prostate position ""fluctuation"" were presented.  Results:   The required treatment margin for the left-right, superoinferior, and anteroposterior axes was 8.4, 10.8, and 14.7 mm for skin mark-only setup and 1.3, 2.3, and 2.8 mm using the on-line setup correction, respectively. Prostate motion significantly correlated among the superoinferior and anteroposterior directions. Of the 17 patients, 14 had prostate motion within 5 mm of the initial setup position for ≥91.6% of the total tracking time. The treatment margin decreased to 1.1, 1.8, and 2.3 mm with a 3-mm threshold correction and to 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mm with an every-2-min correction in the left-right, superoinferior, and anteroposterior directions, respectively. The periodic corrections significantly increase the treatment time and increased the number of instances when the setup correction was made during transient excursions.  Conclusions:   The residual systematic and random error due to intrafraction prostate motion is small after on-line setup correction.

Methods and materials:   Follow-up consisted of scheduled clinic appointments at our institution or direct communication with the treating physicians for referred patients. Each proton radiotherapy plan used for treatment was directly compared to an IMRT plan generated for the study. Clinical target volumes and normal tissue volumes were held constant to facilitate dosimetric comparisons. Each plan was optimized for target coverage and normal tissue sparing.  Results:   Seven male patients were treated with proton radiotherapy for bladder/prostate RMS at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 2002 and 2008. Median age at treatment was 30 months (11-70 months). Median follow-up was 27 months (10-90 months). Four patients underwent a gross total resection prior to radiation, and all patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Radiation doses ranged from 36 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) to 50.4 CGE. Five of 7 patients were without evidence of disease and with intact bladders at study completion. Target volume dosimetry was equivalent between the two modalities for all 7 patients. Proton radiotherapy led to a significant decrease in mean organ dose to the bladder (25.1 CGE vs. 33.2 Gy; p=0.03), testes (0.0 CGE vs. 0.6 Gy; p=0.016), femoral heads (1.6 CGE vs. 10.6 Gy; p=0.016), growth plates (21.7 CGE vs. 32.4 Gy; p=0.016), and pelvic bones (8.8 CGE vs. 13.5 Gy; p=0.016) compared to IMRT.  Conclusions:   This study provides evidence of significant dose savings to normal structures with proton radiotherapy compared to IMRT and is well tolerated in this patient population.

Late complications were recorded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale, correlated against EUD and known physical predictive indicators.  Results:   EUD is an independent prognostic factor for Grade 2+ long-term rectal and bladder toxicity after radiation treatment to the prostate. Patients receiving an EUD >63.1 Gy to the rectum have a statistically significant (10% vs. 30%; p = 0.002) higher risk of developing Grade 2+ late complications.

Celastrol, a quinine methide triterpene extracted from a Chinese medicine (Trypterygium wilfordii Hook F.), has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy against various cancer cells, including prostate cancer, leukemia, and melanoma cells. However, ERα regulation by Celastrol has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the effects of Celastrol on the growth of breast cancer cells. We observed that Celastrol decreased expression of ERα at both the mRNA and the protein levels in MCF7 and T47D human breast cancer cells. Results from a luciferase assay showed that Celastrol decreased the transcriptional activity of ERα. Also, Celastrol treatment inhibited ERα target gene expression, including expressions of cyclin D(1), progesterone receptor (PR), and c-Myb leading to cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition of breast cancer cells.

In this report, we present the 10-year results.  Methods:   For this open-label randomised trial, eligible patients were younger than 80 years and had newly diagnosed histologically proven T1-2 prostatic adenocarcinoma with WHO histological grade 3 or T3-4 prostatic adenocarcinoma of any histological grade, and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus immediate androgen suppression. Treatment allocation was open label and used a minimisation algorithm with institution, clinical stage of the disease, results of pelvic-lymph-node dissection, and irradiation fields extension as minimisation factors. Patients were irradiated externally, once a day, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks to a total dose of 50 Gy to the whole pelvis, with an additional 20 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles. The LHRH agonist, goserelin acetate (3·6 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks), was started on the first day of irradiation and continued for 3 years; cyproterone acetate (50 mg orally three times a day) was given for 1 month starting a week before the first goserelin injection. The primary endpoint was clinical disease-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00849082.  Findings:   Between May 22, 1987, and Oct 31, 1995, 415 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups and were included in the analysis (208 radiotherapy alone, 207 combined treatment). Median follow-up was 9·1 years (IQR 5·1-12·6). 10-year clinical disease-free survival was 22·7% (95% CI 16·3-29·7) in the radiotherapy-alone group and 47·7% (39·0-56·0) in the combined treatment group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·42, 95% CI 0·33-0·55, p<0·0001). 10-year overall survival was 39·8% (95% CI 31·9-47·5) in patients receiving radiotherapy alone and 58·1% (49·2-66·0) in those allocated combined treatment (HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·45-0·80, p=0·0004), and 10-year prostate-cancer mortality was 30·4% (95% CI 23·2-37·5) and 10·3% (5·1-15·4), respectively (HR 0·38, 95% CI 0·24-0·60, p<0·0001). No significant difference in cardiovascular mortality was noted between treatment groups both in patients who had cardiovascular problems at study entry (eight of 53 patients in the combined treatment group had a cardiovascular-related cause of death vs 11 of 63 in the radiotherapy group; p=0·60) and in those who did not (14 of 154 vs six of 145; p=0·25). Two fractures were reported in patients allocated combined treatment.

To date, no study has elucidated the effect of long-term use of indwelling bladder catheter on serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and on the incidence of prostate cancer (CaP). The aim of the present study is to analyze the incidence of CaP in patients with long-term use of indwelling bladder catheter and determine some practice patterns on this issue.  Materials and methods:   The study comprised a retrospective analysis of data from 1,651 patients who had undergone transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy from July 2004 to June 2009. Among these patients, 198 (12%) were using an indwelling bladder catheter during the biopsy for at least 1 month. The incidence of CaP was recorded according to total PSA levels. Other variables such patient age, free/total PSA rate, PSA density, prostate volume, and duration of catheter use was also analyzed. Men with a digital rectal examination suspicious for cancer were not considered for analysis.  Results:   Median patient age was 71 years (37 to 89 years). Overall, 25% of patients presented a CaP diagnosis. CaP incidence according to the PSA levels was 0%, 18.9%, 24.5%, and 40.6% for patients with PSA ≤4.0, 4.1-10.0, 10.1-20.0, and >20.0 ng/ml, respectively. When prostate volume was analyzed together, we demonstrated that only 1 (2.4%) patient with PSA below 10.0 ng/ml and prostate volume >60 g had CaP. Median total PSA, PSA density, and prostate volume were statistically different between patients with and without CaP.  Conclusions:   Prostate biopsy should not be indicated for all patients with diagnosis of BPH and AUR who present an elevated PSA level. Patients with PSA below 10.0 ng/ml, and prostate volume >60 g should only undergo biopsy in selected cases.

Unfortunately, whilst accumulating clinical data have suggested that taxanes may prolong the survival in a subset of men with prostate carcinoma, the dose and duration of administration of these drugs are limited by their significant systemic toxicities due to a lack of tumour selectivity. In an attempt to improve both the water solubility and tumour-targeting properties of paclitaxel (Taxol®), we set out to develop a water soluble paclitaxel prodrug that is activated specifically by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) which is almost exclusively expressed in prostate tissue and prostate carcinoma making it an ideal molecular target for prodrug strategies. Using albumin as a drug carrier, we describe a novel albumin-binding prodrug of paclitaxel, EMC-Arg-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Tyr-Ser-Leu-PABC-paclitaxel [EMC: ε-maleimidocaproyl; PABC: p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl] that was synthesised by reacting EMC-Arg-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Tyr-Ser-OH with H-Leu-PABC-paclitaxel. This prodrug was water soluble and was bound to endogenous and exogenous albumin. Moreover, incubation studies with PSA demonstrated that the albumin-bound form of the prodrug was cleaved rapidly at the P1-P1' scissile bond releasing the paclitaxel-dipeptide H-Ser-Leu-PABC-paclitaxel. Last but not least, due to the incorporation of a PABC self-eliminating linker, this dipeptide was rapidly degraded to liberate paclitaxel as a final cleavage product within a few hours in prostate tumour tissue homogenates. Of note was that the albumin-bound form of the prodrug was approximately three-fold more active in killing PSA-positive LNCaP cells than paclitaxel. In addition, orientating toxicity studies in mice showed that the maximum tolerated dose of the novel paclitaxel prodrug was twice that of conventional paclitaxel. When tested in vivo in an orthotopic mouse model of human prostate cancer using luciferase-transduced LNCaP LLN cells, both paclitaxel and the new paclitaxel prodrug showed distinct antitumour efficacy on the primary tumour and metastases that was significantly better than the effect of doxorubicin which was used as a comparison and showed no antitumour efficacy. The new paclitaxel prodrug (3 × 24 mg paclitaxel equivalents) showed comparable antitumour activity on the primary tumour to paclitaxel at its maximum-tolerated dose (3 × 12mg/kg), reduced circulating PSA levels and demonstrated a better antitumour effect on lung metastases but not on bone metastases.""","""['Bakheet Elsadek', 'Ralph Graeser', 'Norbert Esser', 'Cynthia Schäfer-Obodozie', 'Khalid Abu Ajaj', 'Clemens Unger', 'André Warnecke', 'Tahia Saleem', 'Nagla El-Melegy', 'Hafez Madkor', 'Felix Kratz']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['In vivo evaluation of a novel albumin-binding prodrug of doxorubicin in an orthotopic mouse model of prostate cancer (LNCaP).', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of an albumin-binding prodrug of doxorubicin that is cleaved by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a PSA-positive orthotopic prostate carcinoma model (LNCaP).', 'Development of albumin-binding doxorubicin prodrugs that are cleaved by prostate-specific antigen.', 'Targeted prodrug approaches for hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Antitumour prodrug development using cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated activation.', 'Screening for new peptide substrates for the development of albumin binding anticancer pro-drugs that are cleaved by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to improve the anti tumor efficacy.', 'New PTX-HS15/T80 Mixed Micelles: Cytotoxicity, Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Distribution.', 'Enhanced anti-tumor activity of the Multi-Leu peptide PACE4 inhibitor transformed into an albumin-bound tumor-targeting prodrug.', 'KLK-targeted Therapies for Prostate Cancer.', 'The anti-tumor efficacy of 3-(2-Nitrophenyl) propionic acid-paclitaxel (NPPA-PTX): a novel paclitaxel bioreductive prodrug.']"""

Therefore a high PCA3 score should result in a high positive predictive value (PPV) and specificity for a positive biopsy.  Objective:   Our aim was to reevaluate, retest PCA3, and rebiopsy men with an initial PCA3 ≥ 100 and no PCa detected and compare the results with a random cohort of men with an initial PCA3<100.  Design, setting, and participants:   We invited men 63-75 yr of age with a PCA3 ≥100 for retesting and a control group with an initial PCA3 < 100 to participate in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, section Rotterdam.  Interventions:   Blood and urine sampling were used to determine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PCA3. Prostate biopsies were performed if the PSA was ≥2.5 ng/ml and/or the PCA3 score was ≥ 35.  Measurements:   We correlated the initial and reevaluated PCA3 scores. Our assessment of the PPV after rebiopsy was based on the newly determined PCA3 score.  Results and limitations:   After a mean study period of 19 mo, more cases of PCa were detected in rebiopsied men with initial PCA3 scores ≥ 100 than in the controls with PCA3 scores < 100 (30.0% vs 18.8%). Combining initial and rebiopsy data resulted in a PPV of 52.2% in men with PCA3 ≥ 100. Over time, changes in PSA and PCA3 levels were quite different.  Conclusions:   In spite of our rescreened population, PPV and specificity were comparable with all reported studies of men with PCA3 scores ≥ 100. These findings do not explain why these PCA3 scores were excessively high in spite of the absence of biopsy-detectable PCa.""","""['Monique J Roobol', 'Fritz H Schröder', 'Geert L J H van Leenders', 'Daphne Hessels', 'Roderick C N van den Bergh', 'Tineke Wolters', 'Pim J van Leeuwen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['PCA3: a molecular urine assay for predicting prostate biopsy outcome.', 'PCA3 molecular urine assay for prostate cancer in men undergoing repeat biopsy.', 'PSGR and PCA3 as biomarkers for the detection of prostate cancer in urine.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer gene 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Urinary PCA3 a Superior Diagnostic Biomarker for Prostate Cancer among Ghanaian Men.', ""Prostate Cancer Liquid Biopsy Biomarkers' Clinical Utility in Diagnosis and Prognosis."", 'In-Silico Integration Approach to Identify a Key miRNA Regulating a Gene Network in Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Low PCA3 expression is a marker of poor differentiation in localized prostate tumors: exploratory analysis from 12,076 patients.', 'A potential panel of four-long noncoding RNA signature in prostate cancer predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival and disease-free survival.']"""

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists have been reported to reduce AR activation in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells. To determine whether PPARγ ligands are equally effective at inhibiting AR activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer, we examined the effect of the PPARγ ligands ciglitazone and rosiglitazone on C4-2 cells, an androgen- independent derivative of the LNCaP cell line. Luciferase-based reporter assays and Western blot analysis demonstrated that PPARγ ligand reduced dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced increases in AR activity in LNCaP cells. However, in C4-2 cells, these compounds increased DHT-induced AR driven luciferase activity. In addition, ciglitazone did not significantly alter DHT-mediated increases in prostate specific antigen (PSA) protein or mRNA levels within C4-2 cells. siRNA-based experiments demonstrated that the ciglitazone-induced regulation of AR activity observed in C4-2 cells was dependent on the presence of PPARγ. Furthermore, overexpression of the AR corepressor cyclin D1 inhibited the ability of ciglitazone to induce AR luciferase activity in C4-2 cells. Thus, our data suggest that both PPARγ and cyclin D1 levels influence the ability of ciglitazone to differentially regulate AR signaling in androgen-independent C4-2 prostate cancer cells.""","""['Patrice E Moss', 'Besstina E Lyles', 'LaMonica V Stewart']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Thiazolidinediones regulate expression of cell cycle proteins in human prostate cancer cells via PPARgamma-dependent and PPARgamma-independent pathways.', 'The Androgen Receptor Regulates PPARγ Expression and Activity in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-independent repression of prostate-specific antigen expression by thiazolidinediones in prostate cancer cells.', 'Beyond peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma signaling: the multi-facets of the antitumor effect of thiazolidinediones.', 'Experimental evidence of persistent androgen-receptor-dependency in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The role of PPARγ in prostate cancer development and progression.', 'PPAR-γ Partial Agonists in Disease-Fate Decision with Special Reference to Cancer.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2D mediated lipid metabolism via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in prostate cancer.', 'PPAR-γ Modulators as Current and Potential Cancer Treatments.', 'Cancer and diabetes: the interlinking metabolic pathways and repurposing actions of antidiabetic drugs.']"""

Dose-volume histograms were generated for each set of prostate volumes obtained at preimplantation and postimplantion days 0, 14, and 28 to compute quality indices (QIs) and fractional doses at level x (FD(x)). A set of equations for QI, FD(x), and biologically effective doses at dose level D(x) (BED(x)) were defined to account for edema changes with time after implant.  Results:   There were statistically significant differences found between QIs of pre- and postimplant plans at day 0, except for the overdose index (ODI). QIs correlated with postimplant time, and FD(x) was found to increase with increasing postimplant time. With the effect of edema, BED at different dose levels showed less improvement due to the short half-life of (131)Cs, which delivers about 85% of the prescribed dose before the prostate reaches its original volume due to dissipation of edema.  Conclusions:   Results of the study show that QIs, FD(x), and BEDs at the level of D(x) changed from preneedle plans to postimplant plans and have statistically significant differences (p < 0.05), except for the ODI (p = 0.106), which suggests that at the time of (131)C seed implantation, the effect of edema must be accounted for when defining the seed positions, to avoid the possibility of poor dosimetric and radiobiologic results for (131)Cs seed implants.""","""['Than S Kehwar', 'Heather A Jones', 'M Saiful Huq', 'Ryan P Smith']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Effect of edema associated with 131Cs prostate permanent seed implants on dosimetric quality indices.', 'Optimum timing for image-based dose evaluation of 125I and 103PD prostate seed implants.', 'A dynamic model for the estimation of optimum timing of computed tomography scan for dose evaluation of 125I or 103Pd seed implant of prostate.', 'Planning based on postneedle volume with early dosimetric assessment is beneficial for Cesium-131 permanent prostate seed implantation.', 'Prescription dose in permanent (131)Cs seed prostate implants.', 'Edema-induced changes in tumor cell surviving fraction and tumor control probability in 131Cs permanent prostate brachytherapy implant patients.']"""

Results:   An inverse correlation between the two HRQoL domains, long-term global health (QL) and physical function (PF) scores, and the CCI score was observed, indicating an impact of comorbidity in these function areas. Selected pretreatment factors poorly explained the variation in functional HRQoL in the multivariate models; however, a statistically significant impact was found for the CCI (with QL and PF scores) and the presence of diabetes (with QL and emotional function).

Methods and materials:   Endorectal coil MRI scans of the prostate from 42 men were evaluated for dominant IPLs. The IPLs, prostate, and critical normal tissues were contoured. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans were generated with the goal of delivering 75.6 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions to the prostate, with IPLs receiving a simultaneous integrated boost of 3.6 Gy per fraction to a total dose of 151.2 Gy, 200% of the prescribed dose and the highest dose cohort in our trial. Rectal and bladder dose constraints were consistent with those outlined in current Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocols.  Results:   Dominant IPLs were identified in 24 patients (57.1%). Simultaneous integrated boosts (SIB) to 200% of the prescribed dose were achieved in 12 of the 24 patients without violating dose constraints.

Methods and materials:   596 patients underwent with curative-intent RT for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. By National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria, men were classified as having low-risk (30%), medium-risk (40%), or high-risk (30%) disease. The median RT dose was 72 Gy. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) was used in 45%. The idealized treatment time was defined as the total elapsed time (including weekends) to complete treatment if started on a Monday. Missed days of treatment, defined as the number of days beyond the idealized treatment time, was recorded for all patients. Missed days were added to the end of therapy resulting in a longer treatment time. Analysis was conducted for missed days and other standard prognostic variables against freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF).  Results:   The median number of missed days was 2 (range, -3 to 22). With a median follow-up of 51 months, men with 5 or more missed days had similar 4-year FFBF rates (79% vs. 83% in men with <5 missed days, p = 0.0809), especially in the subset of men receiving 74 Gy or greater (89% for both groups, p = 0.8008). Analysis of missed days was performed for the subsets of dose, ADT, and risk category. Men without ADT had a lower FFBF rate with more missed days (p = 0.0030), but this association was not seen in men treated to a dose of 74 Gy or greater (p = 0.7425). On multivariate analysis, dose (p = 0.0010), T stage (p = 0.0145), and prostate-specific antigen level (p < 0.0001) were associated with FFBF, but Gleason score (p = 0.1351) and missed days (p = 0.3767) were not.

Methods and materials:   A total of 306 patients treated between 1995 and 2007 in a radiation dose-escalation program fulfilled the National Comprehensive Cancer Network high-risk criteria. Median International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements radiation dose was 78 Gy (range, 66.0-84.1 Gy). Long-term androgen deprivation (LTAD) was administered in 231 patients, short-term androgen deprivation (STAD) in 59 patients, and no hormones in 16 patients. The Phoenix (nadir plus 2 ng/mL) consensus definition was used for biochemical control. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent prognostic impact of clinical and treatment factors. Median follow-up time was 64 months (range, 24-171 months).  Results:   The actuarial overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 95.7% and 89.8%, respectively, and the corresponding biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) was 89.5% and 67.2%, respectively. Fourteen patients (4.6%) developed distant metastasis. Multivariate analysis showed that Gleason score>7 (p=0.001), pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level>20 ng/mL (p=0.037), higher radiation dose (p=0.005), and the use of adjuvant LTAD vs. STAD (p=0.011) were independent prognostic factors affecting bDFS in high-risk disease. The 5-year bDFS for patients treated with LTAD plus radiotherapy dose>78 Gy was 97%.  Conclusions:   For high-risk patients the present series showed that the use of LTAD in conjunction with higher doses (>78 Gy) of radiotherapy was associated with improved biochemical tumor control.

Methods and materials:   A cohort of African-American prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiation therapy was observed for the development of ED by use of the five-item Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) questionnaire. Final analysis included 27 cases (post-treatment SHIM score ≤7) and 52 control subjects (post-treatment SHIM score ≥16). A genome-wide association study was performed using approximately 909,000 SNPs genotyped on Affymetrix 6.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).  Results:   We identified SNP rs2268363, located in the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene, as significantly associated with ED after correcting for multiple comparisons (unadjusted p = 5.46 × 10(-8), Bonferroni p = 0.028). We identified four additional SNPs that tended toward a significant association with an unadjusted p value < 10(-6). Inference of population substructure showed that cases had a higher proportion of African ancestry than control subjects (77% vs. 60%, p = 0.005). A multivariate logistic regression model that incorporated estimated ancestry and four of the top-ranked SNPs was a more accurate classifier of ED than a model that included only clinical variables.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide association study to identify SNPs associated with adverse effects resulting from radiotherapy. It is important to note that the SNP that proved to be significantly associated with ED is located within a gene whose encoded product plays a role in male gonad development and function. Another key finding of this project is that the four SNPs most strongly associated with ED were specific to persons of African ancestry and would therefore not have been identified had a cohort of European ancestry been screened.

Objective:   We evaluated the rate of PLND use and its lymph node count (LNC) over the last two decades. We also tested the relationship between LNC and the rate of pN1 stage.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 1988 and 2006, 130,080 RPs were recorded in 17 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registries.  Measurements:   The statistical significance of temporal trends was evaluated with the chi-square trend test. Separate univariable and multivariable regression analyses tested the relationship between predictors and two end points: (1) lack of LN staging (pNx) and (2) presence of LN metastases (pN1).  Results and limitations:   Stage pNx was recorded in 25.9% of patients, and pNx rate was higher in more contemporary years (30.1% in 2000-2006 vs 20.8% in 1988-1993; multivariable p < 0.001). When PLND was performed, an average of 7.4 LNs (median: 6) were removed. The average LNC decreased from 12.0 nodes (median: 12) in 1988 to 6.0 nodes (median: 4) in 2006. Overall pN1 rate was 3.4% and decreased from 10.7% to 3.1% between 1988 and 2006 (p < 0.001). LNC was an independent predictor of pN1 stage (multivariable p < 0.001).

""Low-risk"" was defined by the most inclusive criteria for imaging recommendations: prostate-specific antigen ≤10 ng/mL and Gleason score ≤6. We defined staging imaging as a bone scan, computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis or endorectal magnetic resonance imaging performed after the diagnosis of prostate cancer and before prostatectomy for the indication of ""prostate cancer."" Six-hundred seventy-seven patients were identified as having low-risk disease and comprised our study population.  Results:   Of the 677 patients identified as low risk, 328 (48%) underwent at least one preoperative imaging procedure despite the guideline recommendations. Two-hundred two of 677 (30%) patients were administered at least 2 of the 3 modalities, and 18/677 (3%) patients received all 3 imaging examinations before prostatectomy. Suspicious results from the CT (7/265%, 2.7%) or bone scan (21/241%, 8.7%) resulted in 27 patients undergoing additional radiographic imaging, none of which resulted in suspicious lesions requiring intervention or biopsy.

Irinotecan (20 mg/kg/day; days 1-3, 8-10) completely arrested xenograft growth with a small reduction in tumor volume and only minor weight loss of the hosts (7%); irinotecan (12 mg/kg; same schedule) + cisplatin (2.5 mg/kg/day; days 1 and 8) had a similar effect, but with lower weight loss. While the growth inhibition involved apoptosis, it was also associated with a marked increase in autophagy.  Conclusions:   Tumor tissue lines established via subrenal capsule xenografting provide models with clinical relevance and the present study suggests that irinotecan could be useful for therapy of refractory prostatic SCC, in particular in combination with cisplatin.""","""['Wei-Lin Tung', 'Yuwei Wang', 'Peter W Gout', 'Dean-Mo Liu', 'Martin Gleave', 'Yuzhuo Wang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Irinophore C™, a lipid nanoparticulate formulation of irinotecan, improves vascular function, increases the delivery of sequentially administered 5-FU in HT-29 tumors, and controls tumor growth in patient derived xenografts of colon cancer.', 'Experimental therapy of human prostate cancer by inhibiting MDM2 expression with novel mixed-backbone antisense oligonucleotides: in vitro and in vivo activities and mechanisms.', 'The combination effect of amrubicin with cisplatin or irinotecan for small-cell lung cancer cells.', 'Role of topoisomerase I inhibitors in small-cell lung cancer.', 'Irinotecan therapy for small-cell lung cancer.', 'Modeling Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Induced Prostate Cancer Dormancy and Its Clinical Implications.', 'Development of patient-derived xenograft models of prostate cancer for maintaining tumor heterogeneity.', 'Encapsulation and Enhanced Delivery of Topoisomerase I Inhibitors in Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes.', 'Autophagy, Warburg, and Warburg reverse effects in human cancer.', 'Next generation patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft models.']"""

Using the urethra as an anatomical reference point, it can be divided into three distinct zones known as the transition zone (TZ), peripheral zone (PZ) and central zone (CZ). The pathological conditions of benign prostatic hypertrophy and/or prostate adenocarcinoma are highly prevalent in this gland. This preliminary study set out to determine whether biochemical intra-individual differences between normal prostate zones could be identified using Raman spectroscopy with subsequent exploratory analyses. A normal (benign) prostate transverse tissue section perpendicular to the rectal surface and above the verumontanum was obtained in a paraffin-embedded block. A 10-µm-thick slice was floated onto a gold substrate, de-waxed and analysed using Raman spectroscopy (200 epithelial-cell and 140 stromal spectra/zone). Raman spectra were subsequently processed in the 1800-367 cm(-1) spectral region employing principal component analysis (PCA) to determine whether wavenumber-intensity relationships expressed as single points in hyperspace might reveal biochemical differences associated with inter-zone pathological susceptibility. Visualisation of PCA scores plots and their corresponding loadings plots highlighted 781 cm(-1) (cytosine/uracil) and 787 cm(-1) (DNA) as the key discriminating factors segregating PZ from less susceptible TZ and CZ epithelia (P < 0.001). Conversely, 1459 cm(-1) (lipids and proteins) and 1003 cm(-1) (phenylalanine) were identified as the key biochemical factor distinguishing TZ from CZ epithelia (P < 0.05). All stromal zones were discriminated by the protein/lipid region (1459 cm(-1) and 1100 cm(-1)) with DNA/RNA region (781 cm(-1) and 787 cm(-1)) only highlighted between PZ and CZ (P < 0.05).

Certain miRNAs have been shown to function as integral components of the p53 and/or retinoblastoma (Rb) regulatory networks. As such, miRNA dysregulation can have a profound effect on cancer development. Previous studies have shown that miR-449a is down-regulated in human prostate cancer tissue and possesses potential tumor suppressor function. In the present study, we identify miR-449a-mediated growth arrest in prostate cancer cells is dependent on the Rb protein. We show that mutant Rb prostate cancer cells (DU- 145) are resistant to cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence induced by miR- 449a, while overexpression of wild-type Rb in DU-145 sublines (DU-1.1 and B5) restores miR-449a function. In silico analysis of 3'UTR regions reveal a putative miR-449a target site in the transcript of Cyclin D1 (CCND1); an oncogene involved in directly regulating Rb activity and cell cycle progression. Luciferase 3'UTR reporter constructs and inhibitory oligonucleotides confirm that Cyclin D1 is a direct downstream target of miR-449a. We also reveal that miR-449a suppresses Rb phosphorylation through the knockdown of Cyclin D1 and previously validated target HDAC1. By targeting genes involved in controlling Rb activity, miR- 449a regulates growth and senescence in an Rb-dependent manner. These data indicate that miR-449a is a miRNA component of the Rb pathway and its tumor suppressor-like effects, in part, depends on Rb status in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Emily J Noonan', 'Robert F Place', 'Shashwati Basak', 'Deepa Pookot', 'Long-Cheng Li']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['miR-449a enhances radiosensitivity through modulating pRb/E2F1 in prostate cancer cells.', 'miR-449a Regulates proliferation and chemosensitivity to cisplatin by targeting cyclin D1 and BCL2 in SGC7901 cells.', 'MiR-449a Sponges Cyclin D1 Expression and Suppresses Phosphorylation of Retinoblastoma Protein against Osteosarcoma.', 'miR-20a and miR-290, multi-faceted players with a role in tumourigenesis and senescence.', 'Potential of the miR-200 Family as a Target for Developing Anti-Cancer Therapeutics.', 'microRNA-449a reduces growth hormone-stimulated senescent cell burden through PI3K-mTOR signaling.', 'Study on the role of SLC14A1 gene in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Relationship of microRNA locus with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a case-control study.', 'MicroRNA-449a inhibits cell proliferation and migration by regulating mutant p53 in MDA-MB-468 cells.', 'Detection of circRNA Biomarker for Acute Myocardial Infarction Based on System Biological Analysis of RNA Expression.']"""

L1-ORF1p expression was detected in nearly all breast tumors that the authors examined, and the protein was also present in a high percentage of ileal carcinoids, bladder, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, as well as in a smaller percentage of prostate and colorectal tumors. Tumors generally demonstrated cytoplasmic L1-ORF1p; however, in several breast cancers, L1-ORF1p was nuclear. Patients with breast tumors displaying nuclear L1-ORF1p had a greater incidence of both local recurrence and distal metastases and also showed poorer overall survival when compared with patients with tumors displaying cytoplasmic L1-ORF1p. These data suggest that expression of L1-ORF1p is widespread in many cancers and that redistribution from cytoplasm to nucleus could be a poor prognostic indicator during breast cancer.

The prostate-specific antigen/free testosterone (PSA/FT) ratio has been shown to be effective in clustering patients in prognostic groups as follows: low risk (PSA/FT ≤0.20), intermediate risk (PSA/FT >0.20 and ≤0.40) and high risk (PSA/FT >0.40 and ≤1.5). In the present study we explored the total PSA and FT distributions, and linear regression of FT predicting PSA in the different groups (PSA/FT, pT and pG) and subgroups (pT and pG) of patients according to the prognostic PSA/FT ratio.  Patients and methods:   The study included 128 operated prostate cancer patients. Pretreatment simultaneous serum samples were obtained for measuring free testosterone (FT) and total PSA levels. Patients were grouped according to the total PSA/FT ratio prognostic clusters (≤0.20, >0.20 and ≤0.40, >0.40), pT (2, 3a and 3b+4) and pathological Gleason score (pG) (≤6, = 7 >3 + 4, ≥7 >4 + 3). The pT and pG sets were subgrouped according to the prognostic PSA/FT ratio. Linear regression analysis of FT predicting total PSA was computed according to the different PSA/FT prognostic clusters for the: (1) total sample population, (2) pT and pG groups, (3) intraprostatic (pT2) and extraprostatic disease (pT3a/3b/4), and (4) low-intermediate grade (pG ≤6) and high-grade (pG ≥7) prostate cancer.  Results:   Analysis of variance always showed highly significant different PSA distributions for (1) the different PSA/FT, pT and pG groups; and (2) the pT and pG prognostic subgroups. Significant FT distributions were detected for the (1) PSA/FT and pT groups; and (2) the pT2, pT3a and pG ≤6 prognostic PSA/FT subgroups. Correlation, variance and linear regression analysis of FT predicting total PSA was significant for (1) the PSA/FT prognostic clusters, (2) all the pT2 and pT3a subgroups, and (3) the pT3b/4 subgroup with PSA/FT >0.20 and ≤0.40, and (4) all the pG subsets. Linear regression analysis showed that the slopes of the predicting variable (FT) were always highly significant for patients with (1) intraprostate and extraprostate disease, and (2) low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer.

We show that treatment with androgen can induce the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in both malignant and nonmalignant prostate epithelial cells. Although the fusion could be detected in malignant cells following 24-hour treatment, prolonged exposure to androgen was required to detect the fusion transcript in nonmalignant cells. We associated the fusion incidence with genetic factors, including androgen-induced gene proximity, androgen receptor exon1 CAG repeat length and expression of the PIWIL1 gene.

We present in vitro and in vivo evidence that the orphan GPRC6A receptor, a widely expressed calcium and amino acid sensing GPCR, transduces the non-genomic effects of testosterone and other steroids. Overexpression of GPRC6A imparts the ability of extracellular testosterone to illicit a rapid, non-genomic signaling response in HEK-293 cells lacking the androgen receptor. Conversely, testosterone-stimulated rapid signaling and phosphorylation of ERK is attenuated in bone marrow stromal cells derived from GPRC6A(-/-) mice and in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells after siRNA-mediated knockdown of GPRC6A.

Methods:   We used series of computed tomography data, which included the pretreatment scan, and between 21 and 43 in-room scans acquired on different treatment days, from 10 patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy at Morristown Memorial Hospital. Variations in femur rotation angles, thickness of subcutaneous adipose tissue, and physical depth to the distal surface of the prostate for lateral beam arrangement were recorded. Proton dose distributions were planned with the standard approach. Daily variations in the location of the prescription isodose were evaluated.  Results:   In all 10 datasets, substantial variation was observed in the lateral tissue thickness (standard deviation of 1.7-3.6 mm for individual patients, variations of >5 mm from the planning computed tomography observed in all series), and femur rotation angle (standard deviation between 1.3° and 4.8°, with the maximum excursion exceeding 10° in 6 of 10 datasets). Shifts in the position of treated volume (98% isodose) were correlated with the variations in the lateral tissue thickness.  Conclusions:   Analysis suggests that, combined with image-guided setup verification, the range compensator expansion technique prevents loss of dose to target from femur rotation and soft-tissue deformation, in the majority of cases.

Objective:   To compare the performance of the two available risk estimators incorporating PCA3 in the detection of PCa in the ""grey area"" of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/ml: the updated Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) calculator and Chun's nomogram.  Design, setting, and participants:   Two hundred eighteen patients presenting with an abnormal PSA (excluding those with PSA >10 ng/ml) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination were prospectively enrolled in a multicentre Italian study between October 2008 and October 2009. All patients underwent ≥12-core prostate biopsy.  Measurements:   PCA3 scores were assessed using the Progensa assay (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA). Comparisons between the two models were performed using tests of accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-ROC]), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Biopsy predictors were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. In addition, performance of PCA3 was analysed through AUC-ROC and predictive values.  Results and limitations:   PCa was detected in 73 patients (33.5%). Among predictors included in the models, only PCA3, PSA, and prostate volume retained significant predictive value. AUC-ROC was higher for the updated PCPT calculator compared to Chun's nomogram (79.6% vs 71.5%; p=0.043); however, Chun's nomogram displayed better overall calibration and a higher net benefit on decision curve analysis. Using a probability threshold of 25%, no high-grade cancers would be missed; the PCPT calculator would save 11% of biopsies, missing no cancer, whereas Chun's nomogram would save 22% of avoidable biopsies, although missing 4.1% non-high-grade cancers. The small number of patients may account for the lack of statistical significance in the predictive value of individual variables or model comparison.

Several studies have suggested that specific matrix production by the bone cells, such as collagen I, supports cancer cell invasion. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of collagen I (COL1) and fibronectin (FN) on cell adhesion, cell elasticity and cytoskeletal organization of prostate cancer cells. Two cell lines, bone marrow- (PC3) and lymph node-derived (LNCaP) were cultivated on COL1 and FN (control protein). By using a quantitative adhesion assay and time-lapse analysis, it was found that PC3, but not LNCaP, adhered strongly and were more spread on COL1. Next, PC3 and LNCaP were evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and flatness shape factor and cellular Young's modulus were calculated. The shape analysis revealed that PC3 were significantly flatter when grown on COL1 in comparison to LNCaP. In general, PC3 were also significantly stiffer than LNCaP and furthermore, their stiffness increased upon interaction with COL1. Since cell stiffness is strongly dependent on actin organization, phalloidin-based actin staining was performed and revealed that, of the two cell types as well as the two different matrix proteins, only PC3 grown on COL1 formed robust actin cytoskeleton. In conclusion, our study showed that PC3 cells have a strong affinity towards COL1. On this matrix protein, the cells adhered strongly and underwent a specific cell flattening. Moreover, with the establishment of PC3 contact to COL1 a significant increase of PC3 stiffness was observed due to a profound cytoskeletal rearrangement.""","""['Denitsa Docheva', 'Daniela Padula', 'Matthias Schieker', 'Hauke Clausen-Schaumann']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Mineralized human primary osteoblast matrices as a model system to analyse interactions of prostate cancer cells with the bone microenvironment.', 'The chemopreventive bioflavonoid apigenin inhibits prostate cancer cell motility through the focal adhesion kinase/Src signaling mechanism.', 'High dose fractionated ionizing radiation inhibits prostate cancer cell adhesion and beta(1) integrin expression.', 'The influence of GFP-actin expression on the adhesion dynamics of HepG2 cells on a model extracellular matrix.', 'Type I collagen receptor (alpha 2 beta 1) signaling promotes the growth of human prostate cancer cells within the bone.', 'Geometric Control of Cell Behavior by Biomolecule Nanodistribution.', 'Prostate cancer cells of increasing metastatic potential exhibit diverse contractile forces, cell stiffness, and motility in a microenvironment stiffness-dependent manner.', 'Inadequate tissue mineralization promotes cancer cell attachment.', 'Characterization of Collagen Fibers (I, III, IV) and Elastin of Normal and Neoplastic Canine Prostatic Tissues.', 'Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) links hypoxia to altered mechanical properties in cancer cells as measured by an optical tweezer.']"""

Here, we assessed whether treatment with RU486 in conjunction with an intratumor injection of Ad5IL-12 vector (a recombinant adenovirus expressing IL-12) could impact the TSLN microenvironment and prostate cancer progression.  Methods:   The human PC3, LNCaP or murine TRAMP-C1 prostate cancer cell lines were used to generate subcutaneous tumors in NOD.scid and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. Adjuvant effects of RU486 were looked for in combination therapy with intratumor injections (IT) of Ad5IL-12 vector in comparison to PBS, DL70-3 vector, DL70-3 + RU486, RU486 and Ad5IL-12 vector treatment controls. Changes in tumor growth, cell cytotoxic activity and populations of CD4+/FoxP3+ T regulatory cells (Treg) in the TSLN were evaluated.  Results:   Treatment of human PC3 prostate xenograft or TRAMP-C1 tumors with combination Ad5IL-12 vector and RU486 produced significantly better therapeutic efficacy in comparison to controls. In addition, we found that combination therapy increased the capacity of TSLN lymphocytes to produce Granzyme B in response to tumor cell targets. Finally, combination therapy tended towards decreases of CD4+/FoxP3+ T regulatory cell populations to be found in the TSLN.

These cells were further characterized using karyotyping, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and three-dimensional cultures in Matrigel.  Results:   The PZ-HPV-7 cell line possesses a typical epithelial morphology, expresses basal cell markers, and is capable of forming web-like structures with evidence of budding on Matrigel. PZ-HPV-7 is non-tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice by either subcutaneous injection or subrenal grafting. In contrast, the PZ-HPV-7T cells, derived from a xenograft tumor induced by co-inoculation with matrigel using subrenal grafting, possess a mesenchymal phenotype as well as luminal cell markers and are highly tumorigenic and metastatic in nude mice.

Results:   AGR2 is highly expressed in prostate cancer compared to benign tissue in particular also in low-grade tumors and PIN lesions.

The odds ratio (OR) of PCa (overall and by disease aggressiveness) was estimated by logistic and polytomous regression. Potential interactions between genotypes and dietary exposures were evaluated.  Results:   Data from 1,309 cases and 1,267 controls were analyzed. Carriers of the variant T allele (rs2287939) had an OR of 0.81 (95% CI 0.68-0.97) for less aggressive PCa, but no alteration in risk for more aggressive PCa. Red meat consumption was positively associated with PCa risk, and the association was stronger for more aggressive disease (lowest vs. highest tertile OR=1.55, 95% CI 1.10-2.20). No effect modification of AMACR polymorphisms by either dietary red meat or dairy intake on PCa risk was observed.

Materials and methods:   Thirty two patients, with histology-proven, localized or metastatic prostatic carcinoma (PCa), who were undergoing therapy with LHRH analogue or a combination of LHRH analog and peripheral androgen blockade, took part in the study. In addition, eight healthy volunteers were each tested twice for serum GRP to elicit a ""physiological"" standard value. Blood samples were taken periodically from each patient within an 18-month time frame.  Results:   We defined the standard value for GRP in the healthy participants as 0.852 ng/ml (mean + 2 SD) and observed that the GRP values for patients with PCa were significantly higher (P = 0.034). There was a positive correlation between PSA and GRP in patients with biochemical failure. CgA correlated with PSA development in the CRPCa patients. NSE values rose steadily over the study period, but with no correlation to PSA.  Conclusion:   Our data confirm that NE factors are elevated during hormonal treatment of prostate cancer. GRP is higher in PCa patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy and is possibly involved in the initiation of hormonal escape in PCa.""","""['Elmar Heinrich', 'Kai Probst', 'Maurice Stephan Michel', 'Lutz Trojan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Elevated serum progastrin-releasing peptide (31-98) in metastatic and androgen-independent prostate cancer patients.', 'Influence of abiraterone acetate on circulating neuromediators in chemotherapy-naïve castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate carcinoma: focusing on its pathophysiologic mechanisms and pathological features.', 'Endocrine treatment of prostate cancer: standard treatment and new perspectives.', 'Evaluation and clinical value of neuroendocrine differentiation in human prostatic tumors.', 'Neuron-specific enolase has potential value as a biomarker for 18FFDG/68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET mismatch findings in advanced mCRPC patients.', 'Activation of GRP/GRP-R signaling contributes to castration-resistant prostate cancer progression.']"""

We previously detected linkage between a broad region on chromosome 7q22-35 and Gleason score-a strong predictor of prostate cancer aggressiveness. To further clarify this finding and focus on the potentially causative gene, we undertook a fine-mapping study across the 7q22-35 region.  Methods:   Our study population encompassed 698 siblings diagnosed with prostate cancer. 3,072 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the chromosome 7q22-35 region were genotyped using the Illumina GoldenGate assay. The impact of SNPs on Gleason scores were evaluated using affected sibling pair linkage and family-based association tests.  Results:   We confirmed the previous linkage signal and narrowed the 7q22-35 prostate cancer aggressiveness locus to a 370 kb region. Centered under the linkage peak is the gene KLRG2 (killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G, member 2). Association tests indicated that the potentially functional non-synonymous SNP rs17160911 in KLRG2 was significantly associated with Gleason score (P = 0.0007).

Methods:   The PSMA × CD3 bsc diabody was generated from an anti-CD3 single chain Fv fragment (scFv) and the anti-PSMA scFv D7. It was expressed in E. coli and purified from the periplasmic extract and culture supernatant by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The binding properties were tested on PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells and PSMA-negative cell lines as well as on Jurkat cells by flow cytometry. For in vitro functional analysis, a cell viability test (WST-1) was used and activation of T-cells was determined by measuring the surface marker expression of CD25 and CD69. For in vivo evaluation, the diabody was administered in combination with human peripheral blood lymphocytes (Ly) in a C4-2 xenograft-SCID mouse model.  Results:   Specific binding of the PSMA × CD3 bsc diabody both to CD3-positive Jurkat cells and PSMA-expressing C4-2 cells was shown by flow cytometry. In vitro, the PSMA × CD3 bsc diabody proved to be a potent agent for retargeting CD4+ and CD8+ human lymphocytes to lyse C4-2 prostate cancer cells.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of RAL on epithelial PC growth using the two following in vitro models: the androgen-dependent cell line EPN which expressed both ERs; and a stabilized epithelial cell line derived from a prostate cancer specimen (CPEC), which expressed low levels of ERβ and lacked ERα. In EPN cells, there was an increase in the pre-G1 apoptotic peak and a reduction in the S phase of the cell cycle with G0/G1 arrest after E2 or RAL treatment; bcl-2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein levels were significantly reduced, while activated caspase-3 and Par-4 levels increased significantly after either E2 or RAL treatment; in addition, c-myc transcript was inhibited after 10(-6) M RAL treatment. A dose-dependent increase of metallothionein II gene RNA level was also induced by RAL in EPN. In CPEC, there was only a weak apoptotic peak associated with caspase-3 activation and Par-4 increase after either E2 or RAL treatment; while c-myc transcript level increased. RAL induced a rapid but transient phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in EPN cells but generated a sustained effect in CPEC. These findings suggest that RAL effects on PC growth control in vitro are cell-specific, depending on ERβ or ERβ/ERα relative expression levels.

In the current study, stromal cells from non-cancer (NP) and cancer (CP) were isolated from tissue specimens and co-cultured with NCCIT cells in a trans-well format to preclude heterotypic cell contact. After 3 days, the stromal cells were analyzed by gene arrays for microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA expression. In co-culture, NCCIT cells were found to alter the miRNA and mRNA expression of NP stromal cells to one like that of CP stromal cells. In contrast, NCCIT had no significant effect on the gene expression of CP stromal cells.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether leptin is associated with the motility of prostate cancer cells. We found that leptin increased the migration of human prostate cancer cells and expression of αvβ3 integrin on these cells. Leptin-mediated migration and increased integrin expression were attenuated by OBRl receptor antisense oligonucleotide (ODN). Activation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and NF-κB pathways after leptin treatment was demonstrated. Furthermore, leptin-induced integrin expression and migration activity were inhibited by specific inhibitors; small interfering RNAs (siRNAs); and mutants of the IRS-1, PI3K, Akt, and NF-κB cascades.

We examined the relative survival of the patients with organ-defined prostate cancer (TNM T1-2N0M0, UICC I-II) compared to the standardized age-adjusted rates of the normal male population.  Methods:   Epidemiological and clinical data from 4,124 patients with prostate cancer diagnosed from 1998 to 2007 were extracted from the cancer registry of the tumor center in Regensburg; 2,087 patients suffered from localized early cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the overall survival rates in the patient cohorts irrespective of primary cancer therapy. These rates were adjusted for the expected survival rates in a comparable set of individuals from the general population.  Results:   Eight years after diagnosis, patients with stage I and II localized prostate cancer had an approximately 10% relative increase in survival compared with the normal male population. This relative increase in survival was already observed 3 years after diagnosis.  Conclusion:   Patients with stage I-II localized prostate cancer have improved survival compared with the normal male population. This finding cannot be explained solely by the administration of prostate cancer treatments, which do not affect survival until 8-10 years after treatment, suggesting that men who participate in PSA testing may have a better overall health status.

The aim of our study was to assess the expression of mir-20a, let-7a, miR-15a and miR-16 in prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue and to investigate the relation between the expression of miRNAs and the clinicopathological features of PCa.  Patients and methods:   The study group comprised 138 patients: 85 patients with BPH and 53 patients with PCa. The total RNA was isolated from the tissue specimen core and miRNA expressions were quantified using a real-time RT-PCR method (TaqMan MicroRNA Assays). U6snRNA was used for the normalization of the miRNA expression.  Results:   miR-20a expression was significantly higher in the group of patients with a Gleason score of 7-10 in comparison with the group of patients with a Gleason score of 0-6 (p=0.0082). We found no statistical differences in the miRNA expressions (mir-20a, let-7a, miR-15a and miR-16) in the PCa tissue samples in comparison with the BPH tissue samples.  Conclusion:   Our result shows that the more dedifferentiated PCa cells have a higher expression of miR-20a and this supports the oncogenic role of miR-20a in PCa carcinogenesis.

Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) plays an important role in folate metabolism and is also an important source of DNA methylation and DNA synthesis (nucleotide synthesis). To assess the association and interaction of genotypic polymorphisms in MTHFR and lifestyle factors with prostate cancer in Taiwan, we investigated two well-known polymorphic variants of MTHFR, C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131), analyzed the association of specific genotypes with prostate cancer susceptibility, and discussed their joint effects with individual habits on prostate cancer risk. In total, 218 patients with prostate cancer and 436 healthy controls recruited from the China Medical Hospital in central Taiwan were genotyped for these polymorphisms with prostate cancer susceptibility. We found the MTHFR C677T but not the A1298C genotype was differently distributed between the prostate cancer and control groups. The T allele of MTHFR C677T conferred a significantly (p=0.0011) decreased risk of prostate cancer. As for the A1298C polymorphism, there was no difference in distribution between the prostate cancer and control groups. Gene interactions with smoking were significant for MTHFR C677T polymorphism. The MTHFR C677T CT and TT genotypes in association with smoking conferred a decreased risk of 0.501 (95% confidence interval=0.344-0.731) for prostate cancer.

We found that there were no obvious differences in cell proliferation between cells overexpressing hK7 and cells transfected with empty vector (p>0.05). Intriguingly, a Matrigel invasion assay revealed that hK7 remarkably increased the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells (p<0.01). Furthermore, hK7 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like changes in prostate carcinoma cells, as evidenced by scattered cellular growth, mesenchyma-like morphology, and up-regulated expression of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker.

We evaluated methods for addressing confounding in treatment and survival of patients with early-stage prostate cancer in observational data and compared findings with those from a benchmark randomized clinical trial.  Methods:   We selected 14 302 early-stage prostate cancer patients who were aged 66-74 years and had been treated with radical prostatectomy or conservative management from linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2003. Eligibility criteria were similar to those from a clinical trial used to benchmark our analyses. Survival was measured through December 31, 2007, by use of Cox proportional hazards models. We compared results from the benchmark trial with results from models with observational data by use of traditional multivariable survival analysis, propensity score adjustment, and instrumental variable analysis.  Results:   Prostate cancer patients receiving conservative management were more likely to be older, nonwhite, and single and to have more advanced disease than patients receiving radical prostatectomy. In a multivariable survival analysis, conservative management was associated with greater risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 to 2.00) and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.35 to 1.59) than radical prostatectomy. Propensity score adjustments resulted in similar patient characteristics across treatment groups, although survival results were similar to traditional multivariable survival analyses. Results for the same comparison from the instrumental variable approach, which theoretically equalizes both observed and unobserved patient characteristics across treatment groups, differed from the traditional multivariable and propensity score results but were consistent with findings from the subset of elderly patient with early-stage disease in the trial (ie, conservative management vs radical prostatectomy: for prostate cancer-specific mortality, HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.08 to 6.73; for all-cause mortality, HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.46 to 2.59).

Here, using in situ immunofluorescence (ISIF), P. acnes was found in 58 out of 71 (81.7%) tested cancerous prostate tissue samples, but was absent from healthy prostate tissues (20 samples) and other cancerous tissue biopsies (59 mamma carcinoma samples). Live P. acnes bacteria were isolated from cancerous prostates and cocultured with the prostate epithelial cell line RWPE1. Microarray analysis showed that the host cell responded to P. acnes with a strong multifaceted inflammatory response. Active secretion of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, from infected cells was confirmed. The host cell response was likely mediated by the transcriptional factors NF-κB and STAT3, which were both activated upon P. acnes infection. The P. acnes-induced host cell response also included the activation of the COX2-prostaglandin, and the plasminogen-matrix metalloproteinase pathways. Long-term exposure to P. acnes altered cell proliferation, and enabled anchorage-independent growth of infected epithelial cells, thus initiating cellular transformation.

However, the apoptotic mechanism of ursolic acid using primary malignant tumor (RC-58T/h/SA#4)-derived human prostate cells is not known. In the present study, ursolic acid significantly inhibited the growth of RC-58T/h/SA#4 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. Ursolic acid induced cell death as evidenced by an increased proportion of cells in sub-G1 phase, the formation of apoptotic bodies, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation. After ursolic acid treatment at concentrations above 40 μM, the activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were significantly increased compared that of control. Ursolic acid modulated the upregulation of Bax (pro-apoptotic) as well as the downregulation of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic). Ursolic acid also stimulated Bid cleavage, which indicates that the apoptotic action of caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage leads to the activation of caspase-9. Thus, the apoptotic effect of ursolic acid was involved in extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. In addition, ursolic acid increased the expression of the caspase-independent mitochondrial apoptosis factor (AIF) in RC-58T/h/SA#4 cells.

Level of evidence:   2b. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Historically, surgeons were reluctant to perform radical prostatectomy (RP) in LN positive disease. Nowadays, a shift towards multimodal treatment strategies in such patients, comprising RP with extended lymph node dissection followed by radiation and/or hormonal therapy can be detected. However, this change of paradigm is not supported by evidence derived from treatment guidelines. Retrospective studies on this topic, comprising small numbers of patients from the pre-PSA era in the US suggest a survival advantage, if RP is performed. Our analyses of cancer control rates between patients with discontinued vs. completed prostatectomy revealed a superior clinical progression free- and cancer specific-survival rate in those patients with completed prostatectomy. These results add knowledge on treatment outcome of a current patient population since previous retrospective studies include patients from the pre-PSA era.  Objective:   To assess the prognostic role of radical prostatectomy (RP) in lymph node (LN) positive patients with prostate cancer (PCa) in a contemporary RP cohort.  Patients and methods:   Between 1992 and 2004, 158 consecutive patients with clinically localized PCa and regional LN metastasis were identified. Fifty patients underwent LN dissection and discontinued RP, combined with early hormonal therapy (HT) (RP-), whereas, in 108 patients, RP was completed followed by adjunctive HT (RP+). Clinical progression-free- (CPFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were studied using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Disease characteristics and the impact of RP on CPFS and CSS were further assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. A matched pair analysis between RP- and RP+ patients was performed based on clinical and pathological factors.  Results:   Median follow-up was 98 months (interquartile range, 88-113). Five- and 10-year CPFS was 77% and 61% for RP+ patients vs 61% and 31%, for RP- patients (P=0.005), respectively. A similar trend was observed for CSS (84% and 76% for RP+ vs 81% and 46% for RP-; P=0.001). Type of treatment (RP- vs RP+) and number of positive LN were multivariate predictors of CPFS and CSS (all P≤0.05). In the matched pair analyses, RP+ patients showed superior CPFS and CSS (P<0.005).  Conclusions:   RP had a beneficial impact, resulting in the superior survival of patients with LN positive PCa after controlling for LN tumour burden in a contemporary RP series.

The current study derived population-based positive surgical margin cut-offs in order to help identify underperforming surgeons who may benefit from further courses and/or self study to improve outcomes.  Objective:   To characterize factors associated with positive surgical margins (PSMs) and derive population-based PSM cutoffs to evaluate surgeon performance in radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   SEER-Medicare data were used to identify 4247 men diagnosed with prostate cancer during 2004-2005 who underwent RP up to 2006. We performed logistic regression to assess the impact of tumour characteristics, surgeon volume and surgical approach on the likelihood of PSMs for pT2 and PT3a disease. Moreover, we derived 25th and 10th percentile cutoffs from binomial distribution equations.  Results:   Overall, 19.4% of men experienced PSMs with a pT2 vs pT3a PSM rate of 14.9% vs 42% (P<0.001). Extrapolating from our population-based results, a surgeon incurring more than three PSMs in 10 cases of pT2 disease performed below the 25th percentile. There was a trend for fewer PSMs with minimally invasive vs open RP (17.4% vs 20.1%, P=0.086), and the PSM rate also decreased over the study period from 21.3% in 2004 to 16.6% in 2006 (P=0.028) with significant geographic variation (P<0.001). In adjusted analyses, temporal and geographic variation in PSM persisted, and men with high (odds ratio 3.68, 95% CI 2.82-4.81) and intermediate (odds ratio 2.52, 95% CI 2.03-3.13) vs low-risk disease were at greater odds to experience PSMs. Notably, neither surgical approach nor surgeon volume was significantly associated with PSMs.  Conclusion:   Our population-based PSM benchmarks allow identification of under-performing outliers who may seek courses or video self-study to improve outcomes.

In total, a population of 71 men were screened for moderate to severe urinary symptoms 3 months or longer post-radiotherapy. Of these mean, 22 were recruited into the intervention from an eligible population of 43 symptomatic men. • Urinary symptoms were measured before the intervention and again after 4 months of follow-up through International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) and bladder diaries. • Health-related quality of life was measured in relation to cancer per se and prostate cancer specifically, and confidence to cope was measured by a self-efficacy questionnaire. • The self-management intervention comprised pelvic floor muscle exercises, bladder retraining, patient education and problem solving and coping strategies  Results:   • Lower urinary tract symptoms, as measured by the IPSS, showed a significant improvement, with a median score change of 5 (P < 0.005). • This was supported by objective changes in median bladder void volume of +7.5 mL (P < 0.05) and the median number of daily voids of -1 (P < 0.005). • In addition, decreases in emotional distress and problems associated with urinary function suggest that the intervention had a positive impact on health-related quality of life.

The aim of this study was to examine and compare the methods used for improving the diagnostic accuracy of PSA in a country with low incidence of prostate cancer.  Methods:   997 patients with prostate biopsy were included into study. Predictive models using PSA, PSA density (PSAD), free PSA/total PSA (f/tPSA), binary logistic regression (LR) analysis, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and decision trees (DTs) have been developed. For LR, ANNs and DTs, a validation group consisting of 241 cases was reserved.  Results:   193 (19%) biopsies out of 997 showed prostatic cancer. Median PSAD in patients with malignant and benign lesions were 0.21 and 0.16, respectively (p<0.001). According to 25% f/tPSA cut-off level, 18.4% of the patients with PSA<25% and 16.0% of the patients with PSA>25% had prostate cancer (p=0.423). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) values for PSA, PSA density, f/tPSA, LR, ANNs, and DTs were 0.587, 0.625, 0.560, 0.678, 0.644, and 0.698, respectively. ROC AUCs in the validation group for LR, ANNs and DTs were 0.717, 0.516 and 0.629 respectively.  Conclusions:   For cases with f/tPSA<25%, no increased probability for prostatic carcinoma was observed. Multivariate models have higher AUCs than PSA, PSAD or f/tPSA.

The standard treatment for tumour of the prostate is retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) which however is not morbidity-free, e.g. intraoperative bleeding, urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. This is why the interest of the scientific community has turned increasingly to mini-invasive surgical procedures able to achieve the same oncological results as the open procedure, but which also reduce the impact of the treatment on these patients' quality of life. The first step in this direction was laparoscopic prostatectomy described by Schuessler in 1992 and standardised by Gaston in 1997. However, the technical difficulty inherent in this procedure has limited its more widespread use. In May 2000 Binder and Kramer published a report on the first robot-assisted prostatectomy (RARP) using the Da Vinci system (da Vinci TM, Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). From the original experience, RARP, which exploits the advantages of an enlarged, three-dimensional view and the ability of the instruments to move with 7 degrees of freedom, the technique has spread enormously all over the world. At the time of writing, in the USA, RARP is the most common therapeutic option for the treatment of prostate tumour at localised stage.

In this study, we analyzed the mechanism to determine whether β-lap may warrant clinical evaluation as a radiosensitizer. β-Lap killed prostate cancer cells by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) metabolic bioactivation, triggering a massive induction of reactive oxygen species, irreversible DNA single-strand breaks (SSB), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) hyperactivation, NAD(+)/ATP depletion, and μ-calpain-induced programmed necrosis. In combination with ionizing radiation (IR), β-lap radiosensitized NQO1(+) prostate cancer cells under conditions where nontoxic doses of either agent alone achieved threshold levels of SSBs required for hyperactivation of PARP-1. Combination therapy significantly elevated SSB level, γ-H2AX foci formation, and poly(ADP-ribosylation) of PARP-1, which were associated with ATP loss and induction of μ-calpain-induced programmed cell death. Radiosensitization by β-lap was blocked by the NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol or the PARP-1 inhibitor DPQ. In a mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer, β-lap synergized with IR to promote antitumor efficacy. NQO1 levels were elevated in ∼60% of human prostate tumors evaluated relative to adjacent normal tissue, where β-lap might be efficacious alone or in combination with radiation.

Ectopic reexpression of PKD1 in metastatic prostate cancer cells reversibly suppressed expression of mesenchyme-specific genes and increased epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PKD1 increased expression of mesenchyme markers. Further, PKD1 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in a tumor xenograft model. PKD1 phosphorylates Ser(11) (S11) on transcription factor Snail, a master EMT regulator and repressor of E-cadherin expression, triggering nuclear export of Snail via 14-3-3σ binding. Snail S11 mutation causes acquisition of mesenchymal traits and expression of stem cell markers. Together, our results suggest that PKD1 functions as a tumor and metastasis suppressor, at least partly by regulating Snail-mediated EMT, and that loss of PKD1 may contribute to acquisition of an aggressive malignant phenotype.""","""['Cheng Du', 'Chuanyou Zhang', 'Sazzad Hassan', 'Md Helal Uddin Biswas', 'K C Balaji']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Endothelin-1 promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human ovarian cancer cells.', 'Opposite regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasiveness by periostin between prostate and bladder cancer cells.', 'Protein kinase D1 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma via E-cadherin/Snail regulation.', 'Role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in cell fate and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'Circulating and non-circulating proteins and nucleic acids as biomarkers and therapeutic molecules in ovarian cancer.', 'Membrane trafficking in breast cancer progression: protein kinase D comes into play.', 'Potential role for protein kinase D inhibitors in prostate cancer.', 'Afatinib Reverses EMT via Inhibiting CD44-Stat3 Axis to Promote Radiosensitivity in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'GTPBP4: A New Therapeutic Target Gene Promotes Tumor Progression in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer via EMT.']"""

Rapalogue resistance was not due to AKT or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. Expression of the homeobox gene Nkx3.1 was lost in Tsc1-deficient mPIN, and it cooperated with TSC1 loss in mPIN initiation in doubly mutant Tsc1:Nkx3.1 prostatic epithelial knockout mice.

Objective:   To evaluate the extent to which patients with advanced cancer continue to be screened for new cancers.  Design, setting, and participants:   Utilization of cancer screening procedures (mammography, Papanicolaou test, prostate-specific antigen [PSA], and lower gastrointestinal [GI] endoscopy) was assessed in 87,736 fee-for-service Medicare enrollees aged 65 years or older diagnosed with advanced lung, colorectal, pancreatic, gastroesophageal, or breast cancer between 1998 and 2005, and reported to one of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) tumor registries. Participants were followed up until death or December 31, 2007, whichever came first. A group of 87,307 Medicare enrollees without cancer were individually matched by age, sex, race, and SEER registry to patients with cancer and observed over the same period to evaluate screening rates in context. Demographic and clinical characteristics associated with screening were also investigated.  Main outcome measure:   For each cancer screening test, utilization rates were defined as the percentage of patients who were screened following the diagnosis of an incurable cancer.  Results:   Among women following advanced cancer diagnosis compared with controls, at least 1 screening mammogram was received by 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6%-9.1%) vs 22.0% (95% CI, 21.7%-22.5%); Papanicolaou test screening was received by 5.8% (95% CI, 5.6%-6.1%) vs 12.5% (95% CI, 12.2%-12.8%). Among men following advanced cancer diagnosis compared with controls, PSA test was received by 15.0% (95% CI, 14.7%-15.3%) vs 27.2% (95% CI, 26.8%-27.6%). For all patients following advanced diagnosis compared with controls, lower GI endoscopy was received by 1.7% (95% CI, 1.6%-1.8%) vs 4.7% (95% CI, 4.6%-4.9%). Screening was more frequent among patients with a recent history of screening (16.2% [95% CI, 15.4%-16.9%] of these patients had mammography, 14.7% [95% CI, 13.7%-15.6%] had a Papanicolaou test, 23.3% [95% CI, 22.6%-24.0%] had a PSA test, and 6.1% [95% CI, 5.2%-7.0%] had lower GI endoscopy).

The widely used PSA biomarker for PCa has poor sensitivity and specificity and often leads to false-negative and false-positive test results. Recently, sarcosine, proline, kynurenine, uracil, and glycerol 3-phosphate were found in higher concentrations in metastatic prostate cancer urine samples. By measuring all five of these metabolites, doctors may be better able to diagnose prostate cancer with high accuracy. However, there is no method reported for simultaneous detection of these compounds in urine samples. In this study, a novel method was developed to separate and quantify six urinary metabolites including creatinine in urine samples by using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separations of the analytes were carried out using a phenyl-hexyl column with 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile, respectively, under a gradient program. The six metabolites were detected in the multiple reaction monitoring modes with the ESI-positive mode. The linear range of the analytes was from 0.003 to 40 μmol/L. The limit of detection was from 0.05 to 4 nmol/L, and the limit of quantification ranged from 3 to 20 nmol/L. The factors affecting the separation and quantification of the six metabolites, such as mobile-phase and MS conditions, were also investigated.

Recent studies showed that a combination of taxane and ADI-PEG20, which induces caspase-independent apoptosis, is more effective than taxane monotherapy for prostate cancer. The main limitation of ADI from Pseudomonas plecoglossicida (PpADI) and of many other ADI enzymes lies in their pH-dependent activity profile. PpADI has a pH optimum at 6.5 and a pH shift from 6.5 to 7.5 results in an ∼80 % activity drop (the pH of human plasma is 7.35 to 7.45). In 2010, we reported a proof of concept for ADI engineering by directed evolution that resulted in variant M2 (K5T/D44E/H404R).

We analyzed the effect of combining the multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AEE788 and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) on adhesion and growth properties of prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods:   PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP cells were treated with AEE788, VPA or with an AEE788-VPA combination, and cell cycle progression investigated. Furthermore, tumor cell adhesion to vascular endothelium or to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins was evaluated, and integrin α and β subtypes were analyzed. Finally, effects of drug treatment on cell signaling pathways were determined.  Results:   AEE788 moderately and VPA strongly reduced tumor cell adhesion and growth. VPA impaired cell cycle progression and altered the expression level of the cell cycle regulating proteins cdk1, cdk2, cdk4, cyclin B, D1, cyclin E, p21, and p27. VPA also acted on the membranous, cytoplasmic, and gene expression pattern of various integrin α and β subtypes. AEE788 acted likewise, but more moderately. Combining AEE788 and VPA did not result in an additive anti-tumor effect.

Treatment of cells with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid or with PP2A-Cα siRNA inhibited ceramide-induced enhanced p27(kip1) protein expression and Akt dephosphorylation, and prevented Skp2 downregulation. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt attenuated ceramide-induced Skp2 downregulation and p27(kip1) upregulation. In addition, ceramide stimulated binding of the PP2A catalytic subunit PP2A-Cαβ to Akt as assessed by immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that PP2A is involved in the induction of p27(kip1) via inhibition of Akt pathway. Finally, whether PP2A can regulate p27(kip1) expression independently of Akt pathway was determined. Knockdown of PP2A-Cα with siRNA reduced p27(kip1) levels in the presence of Akt inhibitor.

Methods:   Between 2002 and 2008, 2,666 patients in Florida underwent MIRP. Surgical experience was defined as the number of procedures performed from the beginning of the study until each individual MIRP. Multivariable logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations assessed the relationship between SE and in-hospital complication and transfusion rates.  Results:   Overall AC and SE ranged from 1-171 and 1-500, respectively. Between 2002 and 2005, 94-100% of surgeons were considered as low AC tertile (≤15 MIRP) vs. 76-82% between 2006 and 2008. For the same time periods, low AC tertile surgeons performed 46-100 and 27-32% of all MIRPs respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models revealed 51 and 68% lower complication rates in patients operated on by surgeons of intermediate (17-76 MIRPs) and high SE (≥77 MIRPs) relative to surgeons of low SE (≤16 MIRPs).

While mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene frequently contribute to therapy resistance in other epithelial cancers, p53 mutations are relatively rare in RCC. To date, there is conflicting evidence as to whether p53 signaling and function are otherwise proficient or defective in tumors with wild-type p53. In this study, we assayed p53 function in a series of RCC cell lines and normal proximal epithelial tubule cells using two different MDM-2 antagonists, Nutlin-3a and MI-219. Most cell lines with wild-type p53 responded to MDM-2 antagonists as evidenced by induction of p53 and its target gene p21. RCC cell lines treated with MDM-2 antagonists consistently accumulated in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and this event was associated with inhibition of proliferation in RCC cell lines but not in normal proximal epithelial tubule cells. MDM-2 antagonists did not induce significant cell death in RCC cell lines, even with induction of p53-dependent pro-apoptotic genes. In contrast, MDM-2 antagonists caused significant cell death in LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. RCC cell lines with reduced p53, either by mutation or through ectopic expression of p53 shRNA, demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to cell death following sequential treatment with DNA damage and G2/M checkpoint abrogation.

The impact of altered PTK6 intracellular localization in prostate tumor cells has not been extensively explored. Knockdown of endogenous cytoplasmic PTK6 resulted in decreased PC3 cell proliferation and colony formation, suggesting that cytoplasmic PTK6 stimulates oncogenic pathways. In contrast, reintroduction of PTK6 into nuclei of PC3 cells had a negative effect on growth. Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PTK6 substrate Sam68 was detected in cells expressing nuclear-targeted PTK6. We found that mechanisms regulating nuclear localization of PTK6 are intact in PC3 cells. Transiently overexpressed PTK6 readily enters the nucleus. Ectopic expression of ALT-PTK6, a catalytically inactive splice variant of PTK6, did not affect localization of endogenous PTK6 in PC3 cells. Using leptomycin B, we confirmed that cytoplasmic localization of endogenous PTK6 is not due to Crm-1/exportin-1 mediated nuclear export. In addition, overexpression of the PTK6 nuclear substrate Sam68 is not sufficient to bring PTK6 into the nucleus. While exogenous PTK6 was readily detected in the nucleus when transiently expressed at high levels, low-level expression of inducible wild type PTK6 in stable cell lines resulted in its cytoplasmic retention. Our results suggest that retention of PTK6 in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells disrupts its ability to regulate nuclear substrates and leads to aberrant growth.

Because the Wnt/beta catenin pathway has been associated with aggressive prostate cancer, we have sought to further evaluate this pathway with respect to soy protein and prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Previously we have treated rat and human prostate cancer cell lines with soy protein isolates or purified genistein and used gene expression profiling and cross species analysis to identify genes with similar expression changes. One pathway that was identified included the Wnt/beta-cantenin pathway. Here the initial data are evaluated and extended with immunohistochemistry in human prostate cancer, and Western blotting, small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) inhibition and bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU) labeling in prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is modulated by both soy protein isolates and genistein in the genomic results. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated staining of Wnt pathway component molecules, in particular frizzled 3, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), and beta-catenin, in prostate tumors. Western blotting noted increased GSK3 and decreased expression of beta-catenin in soy treated prostate cancer PC3 cells. Supporting this finding, siRNA blocking of GSK3 accelerated growth whereas inhibition of frizzled 3 suppressed growth based on growth curves and BrDU labeling.  Conclusion:   Soy protein appears to regulate prostate cancer via the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. These data demonstrate that the effect of soy protein effect on prostate cancer may occur through the frizzled 3 receptor with activation of GSK3 leading to increased degradation of beta-catenin and cell growth.""","""['Michael A Liss', 'Michael Schlicht', 'Andrea Kahler', 'Ryan Fitzgerald', 'Taylor Thomassi', 'Amy Degueme', 'Martin Hessner', 'Milton W Datta']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Genomics Proteomics""","""['Use of cross species genomic profiling identifies pathways and genes differentially regulated in prostate cancer cells treated with soy protein isolates or purified genistein.', 'The Wnt receptor FZD1 mediates chemoresistance in neuroblastoma through activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.', 'Stably overexpressed human Frizzled-2 signals through the beta-catenin pathway and does not activate Ca2+-mobilization in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Roles and regulation of Wnt signaling and beta-catenin in prostate cancer.', 'Mediterranean Diet Food Components as Possible Adjuvant Therapies to Counteract Breast and Prostate Cancer Progression to Bone Metastasis.', 'Flavonoids as Epigenetic Modulators for Prostate Cancer Prevention.', 'Natural Compounds in Prostate Cancer Prevention and Treatment: Mechanisms of Action and Molecular Targets.', 'Genistein inhibits proliferation and induces senescence in neonatal mouse pituitary gland explant cultures.', 'Prostate cancer metastasis and soy isoflavones: a dogfight over a bone.']"""

Specifically, we found that ablation of p53 in fibroblasts enabled them to promote more efficiently the growth of tumors initiated by PC3 prostate cancer-derived cells. This stimulatory effect was dependent on the increased expression of the chemokine SDF-1 in the p53-deficient fibroblasts. Notably, fibroblasts harboring mutant p53 protein were more effective than p53-null fibroblasts in promoting tumor growth. The presence of either p53-null or p53-mutant fibroblasts led also to a markedly elevated rate of metastatic spread of the PC3 tumors. These findings implicate p53 in a cell nonautonomous tumor suppressor role within stromal fibroblasts, through suppressing the production of tumor stimulatory factors by these cells.

Materials and methods:   Of 202 patients who underwent endorectal magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging from January 2000 to December 2002 before radical prostatectomy 130 satisfied study inclusion criteria and were included in analysis. We compared imaging factors with potential predictive capability to biochemical recurrence data, including magnetic resonance imaging risk score based on local disease extent and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging index lesion characteristics, such as the number of voxels and degree of metabolic abnormality (magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging grade). We evaluated associations of these imaging variables with time to biochemical recurrence by Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for known predictors of biochemical recurrence, such as stage, grade and prostate specific antigen.  Results:   At a median 68-month followup there were 26 biochemical failures. Risk score, lesion volume and high grade voxels each correlated with time to biochemical recurrence. In a model combining clinical parameters risk score, lesion volume and at least 1 high grade voxel the magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging variables remained significant but the magnetic resonance imaging score dropped out.  Conclusions:   Index lesion volume on magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and high grade magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging voxels correlate with time to biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy even when adjusted for clinical data.

To better understand care coordination in the context of prostate cancer we examined how the delivery of prostate cancer care is partitioned across primary care providers and specialists.  Materials and methods:   We identified 105,961 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1992 and 2005 using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data. We assigned all health care for prostate cancer and nonprostate cancer diagnoses by provider specialty across 3 distinct phases of care, including initial, continuing care and end of life. We then identified service types and proportions of care across specialties.  Results:   Urologists provided most prostate cancer care (45.2%). Radiation oncologist involvement decreased from 27.4% of claims in the initial phase to 5.5% and 5.7% in the continuing care and end of life phases, respectively. Conversely medical oncology and to a lesser degree primary care captured a greater percent of ongoing prostate cancer care. In patients with prostate cancer 7,120,343 of 36,837,904 services (19.3%) were directly related to prostate cancer care. Primary care providers were responsible for 47% of overall health care in men with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Urologists provided most prostate cancer care while primary care providers were responsible for most overall health care in men with prostate cancer. In light of current reforms directed at improving care coordination urologists serve as a logical starting point to improve care delivery in the broader context of a medical home.""","""['Ted A Skolarus', 'David C Miller', 'Yun Zhang', 'John M Hollingsworth', 'Brent K Hollenbeck']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Survivorship: adult cancer survivors.', 'An opportunity for coordinated cancer care: intersection of health care reform, primary care providers, and cancer patients.', 'Health care policy reform: a microanalytic model for comparing hospitals in the United States and Germany.', 'Primary care and the maelstrom of health care reform in the United States of America.', 'Can the medical home reduce cancer morbidity and mortality?', 'Understanding Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Non-oncologist Physician Knowledge of Radiation Therapy at an Urban Community Hospital.', 'Determinants of quality prostate cancer survivorship care across the primary and specialty care interface: Lessons from the Veterans Health Administration.', 'Prostate cancer survivorship care in the Veterans Health Administration.', 'Physician visits and the timing of skeletal-related events among men newly diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer: A cohort analysis.']"""

We investigated the significance of skeletal muscle involvement by cancer in needle biopsies in predicting adverse outcomes at radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   From 2000 to 2009, we retrospectively identified 40 cases with Gleason score 6 adenocarcinoma involving up to 20% of 1 core, with skeletal muscle involvement. Outcomes of radical prostatectomy were compared with a control group of 82 cases with the same parameters without skeletal muscle involvement from the same period.  Results:   In radical prostatectomy specimens Gleason score greater than 6, extraprostatic extension and positive margins were found in 15.0%, 7.5% and 12.5% of patients in the study group, compared to 20.7%, 11.0% and 4.9% of patients in the control group, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between cases with or without skeletal muscle involvement on needle biopsy. The apical margin was the only positive margin in 4 of 5 study group cases with positive margins. In contrast, positive margins were randomly distributed in the control group.  Conclusions:   Limited cancer involvement of skeletal muscle in biopsy specimens should not be used as a contraindication for radical prostatectomy for otherwise resectable prostate cancer as most patients have organ confined disease and negative margins.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed annual caseload temporal trends in 34,803 patients who underwent surgery between 1999 and 2008 in Florida. Logistic regression models controlled for clustering among surgeons addressed the relationship of surgical experience, defined as the number of radical prostatectomies done since January 1, 1999 until each radical prostatectomy, with complications and transfusions.  Results:   During the study period the proportion of surgeons in the high annual caseload tertile (24 radical prostatectomies or greater yearly) and the proportion of patients treated by those surgeons increased from 5% to 10% and from 20% to 55%, respectively. Conversely complication and transfusion rates decreased from 14.3% to 9.2% and 12.6% to 6.9%, respectively. Radical prostatectomies done by surgeons in the high surgical experience tertile (86 or greater radical prostatectomies) decreased the risk of any complication by 33% and of any transfusion by 30% vs those in patients operated on by surgeons in the low surgical experience tertile (27 or fewer radical prostatectomies).  Conclusions:   The proportion of surgeons in the high annual caseload tertile and the proportion of patients treated by these surgeons steadily increased during the last decade.

An inverse association between haemoglobin A(1C) (HbA(1C)) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) also has been reported in previous studies that assessed the association cross-sectionally. To fully understand the relationship between diabetes and prostate cancer, it is essential to examine the association in a longitudinal design. The effect of plasma volume should also be considered in examining the PSA level. The aim of this study was to determine whether changes in HbA(1C) were associated with PSA levels, independent of plasma volume changes, as indicated by haematocrit and weight.  Methods:   We investigated 5917 Japanese men aged 50 and over who visited St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo for routine health check-ups in 2006 and 2007. We performed a multiple linear regression analysis to examine any association between changes in HbA(1C) and PSA over 1 year.  Results:   Adjusting for age, body mass index at baseline and changes in weight and haematocrit, the increases in HbA(1C) and PSA were concordant (5.7% increase per 1-unit HbA(1C) change; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-8.5%; p<0.001).

Methods and materials:   Sixty patients, irradiated for localized prostate cancer, underwent anorectal manometry and barostat measurements to evaluate anal pressures, rectal capacity, and rectal sensory functions. In addition, 30 untreated men were analyzed as a control group. In 36 irradiated patients, the anal wall and rectal wall were retrospectively delineated on planning computed tomography scans, and dosimetric parameters were retrieved from the treatment plans. Functional and dosimetric parameters were compared between patients with and without complaints, focusing on urgency, incontinence, and frequency.  Results:   After external beam radiotherapy, reduced anal pressures and tolerated rectal volumes were observed, irrespective of complaints. Patients with urgency and/or incontinence showed significantly lower anal resting pressures (mean 38 and 39 vs. 49 and 50 mm Hg) and lower tolerated rectal pressures (mean 28 and 28 vs. 33 and 34 mm Hg), compared to patients without these complaints. In patients with frequency, almost all rectal parameters were reduced. Several dosimetric parameters to the anal wall and rectal wall were predictive for urgency (e.g., anal D(mean)>38 Gy), whereas some anal wall parameters correlated to incontinence and no dose-effect relation for frequency was found.  Conclusions:   Anorectal function deteriorates after external beam radiotherapy.

To determine whether salvage radiotherapy (SRT) upon early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse is equivalent to immediate adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) post RP.  Material and methods:   130 patients receiving ART and 89 receiving SRT were identified. All had an undetectable PSA after RP. Homogeneous subgroups were built based on the status (±) of lymphatic invasion (LVI) and surgical margins (SM), to allow a comparison of ART and SRT. Biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) was calculated from the date of surgery and from the end of RT. The multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox Proportional hazard model.  Results:   In the SM-/LVI- and SM+/LVI- groups, SRT was a significant predictor of a decreased bDFS from the date of surgery, while in the SM+/LVI+ group, there was a trend towards significance. From the end of RT, SRT was also a significant predictor of a decreased bDFS in three patient groups: SM-/LVI-, SM+/LVI- and SM+/LVI+. Gleason score >7 showed to be another factor on multivariate analysis associated with decreased bDFS in the SM-/LVI- group, from the date of surgery and end of RT. Preoperative PSA was a significant predictor in the SM-/LVI- group from the date of RP only.  Conclusions:   Immediate ART post RP for patients with high risk features in the prostatectomy specimen significantly reduces bDFS after RP compared with early SRT upon PSA relapse.""","""['Tom Budiharto', 'Christiaan Perneel', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Sara Junius', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Pierre Scalliet', 'Laurette Renard', 'Evelyne Lerut', 'Kris Vekemans', 'Steven Joniau', 'Hendrik Van Poppel']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Early salvage radiation therapy does not compromise cancer control in patients with pT3N0 prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: results of a match-controlled multi-institutional analysis.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Adjuvant radiation treatment after prostatectomy.

This was a follow-up study to the original patterns of care for brachytherapy in Europe (PCBE).  Materials and methods:   A total of 1121 radiotherapy (RT) centres from 41 countries were asked to complete an online questionnaire on BT practices and resources. Countries with fewer than 50% of centres responding were excluded. Participating countries were divided into three groups based on gross domestic product (GDP); group I contained the countries with the highest GDP.  Results:   The response rate was 56% (633/1121 centres) with 30/41 countries (73%) meeting the inclusion criteria. Sixty percent of reporting centres provided brachytherapy. Responding centres treated an average of 138 (±10, 1 SD) patients with BT; in group I, the mean was 110/centre, an increase of 18% from 2002. CT-dosimetry increased to 61% of centres vs. 33% in 2002. HDR (high-dose rate) BT was the most commonly reported technique (65% of centres). Most BT interventions were for gynaecological tumors (59% of all cases), followed by prostate (17%), breast (9%), lung/bronchus (3%), and esophagus tumors(2%).  Conclusion:   Gynaecological BT remains the most common application, although both prostate and breast BT have increased. CT-based dosimetry has become increasingly common since 2002.

Osteoporosis is prevalent in men presenting with prostate cancer and also a common side effect of treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists, which are associated with decreased BMD and loss of lean body mass and suppress testosterone, unlike bicalutamide, which results in an increase in serum testosterone and oestrogen levels.  Patients and methods:   • Forty-two men with non-metastatic locally advanced prostate cancer and osteoporosis (T-score ≤-2.5) were treated with bicalutamide (150 mg) monotherapy. BMD was measured at baseline and 1 year. HRQL was assessed 3-monthly using the RAND 36-Item Health Survey and University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index questionnaires. Bone turnover markers, liver function tests, prostate-specific antigen, testosterone, oestradiol and haemoglobin were measured at baseline, at 3 weeks and 3-monthly thereafter. Arm anthropometry and dynamometry assessed fat mass, skeletal muscle mass and quadriceps strength.  Results:   • BMD was maintained (+2.1% lumbar spine, +1.2% total hip and +1.1% forearm). Prostate-specific antigen decreased by 88% at 3 months. Testosterone and oestradiol had increased at 1 year by 58% and 42%, respectively. No increase in bone turnover markers was seen over 1 year. Quadriceps muscle strength was maintained. General and prostate cancer-specific HRQL were maintained throughout the study, with no significant reductions in physical or sexual function. Adverse events included breast pain and gynaecomastia.  Conclusions:   • Bicalutamide preserves BMD, muscle strength and HRQL in osteoporotic men with non-metastatic locally advanced prostate cancer.

A cohort of 12,959 first-time screening-positive men (i.e. with biopsy indication) was compared with another cohort of 37,235 first-time screening-negative men. • Overall mortality rates (i.e. other cause than prostate cancer mortality) were calculated and the 120-day and 1-year cumulative mortality were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with a log-rank test for statistical significance. • Incidence rate ratios (RR) and statistical significance were evaluated using Poisson regression analyses, adjusting for age, total PSA level, screening centre and whether a biopsy indication was present, or whether a biopsy was actually performed or not.  Results:   • There was no statistically significant difference in cumulative 120-day other cause mortality between the two groups of men: 0.24% (95% CI, 0.17-0.34) for screening-positive men vs 0.24% (95% CI, 0.20-0.30) for screening-negative men (P= 0.96). This implied no excess mortality for screening-positive men. • Screening-positive men who were not biopsied (n= 1238) had a more than fourfold risk of other cause mortality during the first 120 days compared to screening-negative men: RR, 4.52 (95% CI, 2.63-7.74) (P < 0.001), adjusted for age, whereas men who were actually biopsied (n= 11,721) had half the risk: RR, 0.41 (95% CI, 0.23-0.73) (P= 0.002), adjusted for age. • Only 14/31 (45%) of the screening-positive men who died within 120 days were biopsied and none died as an obvious complication to the biopsy.

Method:   Individual TCP models based on the Single hit model of cell kill and on the linear-quadratic (LQ) model of cell damage, with and without repopulation, are considered. The tumor dose distributions in case of heterogeneous dose irradiation are described by a Gaussian distribution function on the basis of which a TCP expression is derived depending only on the mean dose to the tumor and its standard deviation and the TCP model parameters.  Results:   It is shown that in case of homogeneous dose to the tumor the plan ranking in terms of TCP is parameter invariant. In case of heterogeneous dose to the tumor there are cases when the plan ranking is parameter invariant and cases when the parameter invariance is violated. An interesting dependence of the extent of the parameter invariance violation on the model of cell kill as well as on the size and repopulation rate of the tumor is noted.

Forty-five patients underwent retropubic RP, while one underwent cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic bladder construction, due to bladder cancer.  Results:   Average patients age prior to surgery plus or minus standard deviation was 65.2 +/- 5.8 years. Average urPSA was 20.9 +/- 47.5 ng/ml (0.05 to 212 ng/ml, median 2.24 ng/ml).

However, most men are diagnosed with PCa at low-stage disease and die of unrelated causes during this period. Men diagnosed at stage IV are at much higher risk of dying of the disease. Therefore, stage IV rates at first diagnoses may be a surrogate marker of PCa-related mortality over a time span less than 10 years. The study objective is to examine the association between PCa screening and stage IV disease rates in new cases to explore potential benefits for PCa screening.  Materials and methods:   The percent of stages I, II, III, IV and unclassified PCa diagnosed in white males in 2005 was compared to PCa screening rates on a state-by-state basis. To consider access to medical care and socioeconomic status, median family income, degree of urbanization, urologist population density and health insurance status were included in the analysis.  Results:   PCa stage IV disease correlated inversely with PCa screening rates (r = -0.42, P = 0.006) where r is the correlation coefficient and P is the probability.

However, whether or not bufalin has inhibitory activity against the proliferation of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells is unclear. The aim of this study is to study the effects of bufalin on the proliferation of NSCLC and its molecular mechanisms of action. The cancer cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein expressions and phosphorylation in the cancer cells were detected by Western blot analysis. In the present study, we have demonstrated that bufalin suppressed the proliferation of human NSCLC A549 cell line in time- and dose-dependent manners. Bufalin induced the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by affecting the protein expressions of Bcl-2/Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3, PARP, p53, p21WAF1, cyclinD1, and COX-2 in A549 cells. In addition, bufalin reduced the protein levels of receptor expressions and/or phosphorylation of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, EGFR and/or c-Met in A549 cells. Furthermore, bufalin inhibited the protein expressions and phosphorylation of Akt, NF-κB, p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK in A549 cells.

Accordingly, androgen deprivation has been the most effective endocrine therapy for hormone-dependent prostate cancer. Here, we report a novel pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated and metabolism-based mechanism to reduce androgenic tone. PXR is a nuclear receptor previously known as a xenobiotic receptor regulating the expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. We showed that genetic (using a PXR transgene) or pharmacological (using a PXR agonist) activation of PXR lowered androgenic activity and inhibited androgen-dependent prostate regeneration in castrated male mice that received daily injections of testosterone propionate by inducing the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3As and hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (SULT)2A1, which are enzymes important for the metabolic deactivation of androgens. In human prostate cancer cells, treatment with the PXR agonist rifampicin (RIF) inhibited androgen-dependent proliferation of LAPC-4 cells but had little effect on the growth of the androgen-independent isogenic LA99 cells.

Methods and materials:   Patients consecutively presenting for primary radiotherapy (February 1997 to December 2002), having a clinical diagnosis of localized CaP, were evaluated for tumor stage using conventional staging and SPECT/CT (N=239). Distant metastatic uptake (mets) were identified by SPECT/CT in 22 (9.2%). None of the suspected mets could be clinically confirmed. Thus, all subjects were followed without alteration in disease management. The SPECT/CT pelvic images defined BTV for IGRT-DE (+150% brachytherapy dose) without (n=150) or with (n=89) external radiation of 45 Gy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria defined risk groups (RG). The median survivor follow-up was 7 years. Biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) was reported by clinical nadir +2 ng/mL (CN+2) criteria. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier, multivariate analysis, and Concordance-index models.  Results:   At 10-year analyses, overall survival was 84.8% and bDFS was 84.6%. With stratification by RG, CN+2 bDFS was 93.5% for the low-RG (n=116), 78.7% for the intermediate-RG (n=94), and 68.8% for the high-RG (n=29), p=0.0002. With stratification by pretreatment SPECT/CT findings, bDFS was 65.5% in patients with suspected mets (n=22) vs. 86.6% in patients with only localized uptake (n=217), p=0.0014. CaP disease-specific survival (DSS) was 97.7% for the cohort. With stratification by SPECT/CT findings, DSS was 86.4% (with suspected mets) vs. 99.0% (localized only), p=0.0001. Using multivariate analysis, the DSS hazard ratio for SPECT/CT findings (mets vs. localized) was 3.58 (p=0.0026). Concordance-index tests, based on all data, by CN+2 bDFS criteria were 0.710 for RG alone and 0.773 for SPECT/CT + RG.  Conclusions:   Through long-term outcomes we demonstrate statistically significant bDFS and DSS predictive value for pretreatment capromab pendetide SPECT/CT imaging in primary CaP.

Materials and methods:   The Urological Surgery Quality Collaborative comprises more than 60 urologists from 3 group practices. From May through September 2009 Urological Surgery Quality Collaborative surgeons collected a uniform set of data (eg prostate specific antigen, clinical stage) for men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. After categorizing the cancer of each patient as low, intermediate or high risk, we analyzed baseline use of staging studies across prostate cancer risk strata and Urological Surgery Quality Collaborative practice locations.  Results:   Of 215 men with prostate cancer 34%, 42% and 24% had low, intermediate and high risk cancer, respectively. Overall 44% and 43% of patients underwent staging with a bone scan or computerized tomography, respectively, and only 9% and 7% of these studies, respectively, were positive for metastases. Use of staging studies increased across risk strata as bone scans or computerized tomography were performed in 17% and 18%, 41% and 40%, and 88% and 86% of patients, respectively, with low, intermediate and high risk tumors (p<0.01). For men with low risk prostate cancer the use of bone scans and computerized tomography differed significantly across Urological Surgery Quality Collaborative practices (p<0.01) and for this group only 1 bone scan (and no computerized tomography) was positive for metastases.  Conclusions:   Use of staging evaluations varies by prostate cancer risk strata and across Urological Surgery Quality Collaborative practices. By feeding these data back to surgeons we may be able to improve practice patterns and avoid unnecessary studies in low risk patients. Attainment of this goal would establish the Urological Surgery Quality Collaborative as a viable infrastructure for collaborative quality improvement in urology.""","""['David C Miller', 'Daniel S Murtagh', 'Ronald S Suh', 'Peter M Knapp', 'Rodney L Dunn', 'James E Montie']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Regional collaboration to improve radiographic staging practices among men with early stage prostate cancer.', 'MUSIC: patterns of care in the radiographic staging of men with newly diagnosed low risk prostate cancer.', 'Improvement in clinical TNM staging documentation within a prostate cancer quality improvement collaborative.', 'Collaborative quality improvement.', 'Use of imaging tests for staging newly diagnosed prostate cancer: trends from the CaPSURE database.', 'Impact of choosing wisely on imaging in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Development and Validation of Dynamic Multivariate Prediction Models of Sexual Function Recovery in Patients with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: Results from the MUSIC Statewide Collaborative.', 'Protocol: A multi-modal, physician-centered intervention to improve guideline-concordant prostate cancer imaging.', 'Validity of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sexual Interest and Satisfaction Measures in Men Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Healthcare utilization in men with poorer sexual and urinary function recovery following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

The aim of the study was to investigate for which symptoms cancer patients consulted their general practitioner (GP).  Material and methods:   All newly diagnosed cancer patients and their GPs in the County of Aarhus, Denmark, participated in a 1-year questionnaire survey. The GPs answered questions about the patients' first presentation of cancer symptoms and the GPs' interpretation of these symptoms.  Results:   A total of 2,212 (83%) questionnaires were answered. The total number of reported symptoms was 3,208 corresponding to 1.7 reported symptoms per patient. The majority (57.6%) of patients presented only one symptom. Symptoms varied with the type of cancer. Patients with breast cancer and malignant melanoma mainly presented with diagnosis-specific symptoms. Patients with colorectal, lung and prostate cancer presented diagnosis-specific symptoms (change in bowel habits, cough and bladder dysfunction) as well as more non-specific symptoms (pain, weight loss and fatigue). The GPs interpreted the symptoms as alarm symptoms in 49%, as general symptoms in 24% and as non-cancer specific symptoms in 27% of the patients.  Conclusions:   In general practice, incident cancer patients often present with few and non-cancer specific symptoms. The fact that only half of the patients presented with alarm symptoms complicates the GPs' diagnostic work-up and the use of fast track for suspected cancer. Therefore, there is a need for alternative referral pathways for cancer patients with non-cancer specific symptoms.""","""['Tine Nørgaard Nielsen', 'Rikke Pilegaard Hansen', 'Peter Vedsted']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ugeskr Laeger""","""['Prostate-specific antigen testing in general practice: a survey among 325 general practitioners in Denmark.', 'Delay in diagnosis of lung cancer in general practice.', 'Symptom pattern and diagnostic work-up of malignancy at first symptom presentation as related to level of care.

Material and methods:   The study included 62 men scheduled for prostate biopsy at Skåne University Hospital Malmö, Sweden. Urine samples were obtained according to the Progensa™ uPCA3 assay. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to test associations between levels of biomarkers and prostate cancer.  Results:   According to pathological examination of core needle biopsies, PCa was found in 18 out of 62 patients.

A model using both markers did not increase prediction of event. Areas under the curve for uPCA3, tPSA and a model combining uPCA3 and tPSA did not differ significantly. No significant correlation was found between uPCA3 and tPSA or prostate volume.  Conclusion:   In this small set of mixed patients uPCA3 alone and tPSA performed equally well as diagnostic markers for PCa.

It is minimally expressed by the endothelial cells of gonadal blood vessels.  Methods:   We used immunohistochemical and immunoblotting techniques involving four separate FSH-receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies that recognize different FSH receptor epitopes and in situ hybridization to detect FSH receptor in tissue samples from patients with a wide range of tumors. Immunoelectron microscopy was used to detect FSH receptor in mouse tumors.  Results:   In all 1336 patients examined, FSH receptor was expressed by endothelial cells in tumors of all grades, including early T1 tumors. The tumors were located in the prostate, breast, colon, pancreas, urinary bladder, kidney, lung, liver, stomach, testis, and ovary. In specimens obtained during surgery performed to remove tumors, the FSH receptor was not expressed in the normal tissues located more than 10 mm from the tumors. The tumor lymphatic vessels did not express FSH receptor. The endothelial cells that expressed FSH receptor were located at the periphery of the tumors in a layer that was approximately 10 mm thick; this layer extended both into and outside of the tumor. Immunoelectron microscopy in mice with xenograft tumors, after perfusion with anti–FSH-receptor antibodies coupled to colloidal gold, showed that the FSH receptor is exposed on the luminal endothelial surface and can bind and internalize circulating ligands.

Here we report an additional 7 years of follow-up. This provides replication using an independent data set and allows estimates of the association between early PSA and subsequent advanced cancer (clinical stage ≥T3 or metastases at diagnosis).  Methods:   Blood was collected from 21,277 men in a Swedish city (74% participation rate) during 1974-1986 at ages 33-50. Through 2006, prostate cancer was diagnosed in 1408 participants; we measured PSA in archived plasma for 1312 of these cases (93%) and for 3728 controls.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 23 years, baseline PSA was strongly associated with subsequent prostate cancer (area under the curve, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.70-0.74; for advanced cancer, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.72-0.78). Associations between PSA and prostate cancer were virtually identical for the initial and replication data sets, with 81% of advanced cases (95% CI, 77%-86%) found in men with PSA above the median (0.63 ng/mL at ages 44-50).  Conclusions:   A single PSA at or before age 50 predicts advanced prostate cancer diagnosed up to 30 years later. Use of early PSA to stratify risk would allow a large group of low-risk men to be screened less often but increase frequency of testing on a more limited number of high-risk men.

In order to take full advantage of the VMAT delivery technique, one must select a robust inverse planning tool. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of VMAT planning techniques of three categories: anatomy-based, fluence-based and aperture-based inverse planning. We have compared these techniques in terms of the plan quality, planning efficiency and delivery efficiency. Fourteen patients were selected for this study including six head-and-neck (HN) cases, and two cases each of prostate, pancreas, lung and partial brain. For each case, three VMAT plans were created. The first VMAT plan was generated based on the anatomical geometry. In the Elekta ERGO++ treatment planning system (TPS), segments were generated based on the beam's eye view (BEV) of the target and the organs at risk. The segment shapes were then exported to Pinnacle TPS followed by segment weight optimization and final dose calculation. The second VMAT plan was generated by converting optimized fluence maps (calculated by the Pinnacle TPS) into deliverable arcs using an in-house arc sequencer. The third VMAT plan was generated using the Pinnacle SmartArc IMRT module which is an aperture-based optimization method. All VMAT plans were delivered using an Elekta Synergy linear accelerator and the plan comparisons were made in terms of plan quality and delivery efficiency. The results show that for cases of little or modest complexity such as prostate, pancreas, lung and brain, the anatomy-based approach provides similar target coverage and critical structure sparing, but less conformal dose distributions as compared to the other two approaches. For more complex HN cases, the anatomy-based approach is not able to provide clinically acceptable VMAT plans while highly conformal dose distributions were obtained using both aperture-based and fluence-based inverse planning techniques. The aperture-based approach provides improved dose conformity than the fluence-based technique in complex cases.""","""['Min Rao', 'Daliang Cao', 'Fan Chen', 'Jinsong Ye', 'Vivek Mehta', 'Tony Wong', 'David Shepard']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Single Arc Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy of head and neck cancer.', 'A VMAT planning solution for prostate patients using a commercial treatment planning system.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Utilising the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training System to Support Undergraduate Teaching of IMRT, VMAT, DCAT Treatment Planning, and QA Concepts.', 'Evaluation of fluence-based dose delivery incorporating the spatial variation of dosimetric leaf gap (DLG).', 'A fast optimization approach for treatment planning of volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Delivery parameter variations and early clinical outcomes of volumetric modulated arc therapy for 31 prostate cancer patients: an intercomparison of three treatment planning systems.']"""

The present study shows that diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a promising cancer-chemopreventive constituent of processed garlic, inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3 in prostate cancer cells in culture and in vivo. Exposure of DU145 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells to growth-suppressive and pharmacologically relevant concentrations of DATS (20 and 40 μmol/L) resulted in suppression of constitutive (DU145) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced (LNCaP) phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr(705)), which correlated with inhibition of Janus-activated kinase 2 phosphorylation. Constitutive and/or IL-6-induced nuclear translocation of pSTAT3 and STAT3 dimerization was also markedly inhibited on treatment with DATS in both cell lines. Inhibition of prostate cancer development in transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate mice by gavage of DATS correlated with a visible decrease in the levels of pSTAT3. Interestingly, the IL-6-mediated activation of STAT3 largely failed to confer protection against proapoptotic response to DATS in both cells. Likewise, DATS-mediated inhibition of cell migration was either not affected or minimally reversed by IL-6 treatment or ectopic expression of constitutively active STAT3. In conclusion, the present study indicates that DATS treatment suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells in culture and in vivo, but activation of this oncogenic transcription factor is largely dispensable for cellular responses to DATS. Ability of DATS to overcome STAT3 activation is a therapeutic advantage for this chemopreventive agent.""","""['Kumar Chandra-Kuntal', 'Shivendra V Singh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Sulforaphane inhibits constitutive and interleukin-6-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Garlic constituent diallyl trisulfide suppresses x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein in prostate cancer cells in culture and in vivo.', 'Transcriptional repression and inhibition of nuclear translocation of androgen receptor by diallyl trisulfide in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular mechanisms and targets of cancer chemoprevention by garlic-derived bioactive compound diallyl trisulfide.', 'STAT3 signaling in prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance: An oncogenic pathway with diverse functions.', 'Involvement of adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper 1 in diallyl trisulfide-induced cytotoxicity in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Effect of Diallyl Trisulfide on TNF-α-induced CCL2/MCP-1 Release in Genetically Different Triple-negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Role of hydrogen sulfide donors in cancer development and progression.', 'Diallyl Trisulfide Inhibits Leptin-induced Oncogenic Signaling in Human Breast Cancer Cells but Fails to Prevent Chemically-induced Luminal-type Cancer in Rats.', 'Prostate Cancer Disparity, Chemoprevention, and Treatment by Specific Medicinal Plants.']"""

Tumor cells that induce angiogenesis are a common characteristic of metastatic disease, and clinically, antiangiogenic therapies have shown value in the setting of advanced cancer. However, recent preclinical studies have suggested that exposure to antiangiogenic drugs can increase tumor invasiveness and metastasis, making it important to determine which contexts antiangiogenic therapy is most appropriate. We describe here the effects of cediranib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in a model of advanced prostate cancer metastatic to skeleton and brain. Treatment with cediranib decreased metastatic tumor burden in the brain and bone, decreased cerebral vasogenic edema, and improved survival, despite increasing the invasive histology of brain metastases. Short-duration cediranib treatment given at the time of tumor cell dissemination was sufficient to inhibit the establishment and subsequent growth of bone metastases, although brain metastases were subject to rebound growth after the discontinuation of cediranib. Distinct growth patterns at different organ sites in the same animal showed that certain tumor microenvironments such as bone may be most amenable to interventions by anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies. In addition, anti-VEGF treatment may be of utility in decreasing the rapid growth of solid brain metastases and vasogenic edema in patients with advanced cancer, leading to reduced morbidity and associated clinical benefit.""","""['Juan Juan Yin', 'Luhua Zhang', 'Jeeva Munasinghe', 'R Ilona Linnoila', 'Kathleen Kelly']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['The tyrosine kinase inhibitor cediranib blocks ligand-induced vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 activity and lymphangiogenesis.', 'Antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of cediranib in a preclinical model of renal cell carcinoma.', 'Stage-specific inhibitory effects and associated mechanisms of silibinin on tumor progression and metastasis in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model.', 'Cediranib: profile of a novel anti-angiogenic agent in patients with glioblastoma.', 'Current status of cediranib: the rapid development of a novel anti-angiogenic therapy.', 'Preclinical Solid Tumor Models to Study Novel Therapeutics in Brain Metastases.', 'Targeting Intercellular Communication in the Bone Microenvironment to Prevent Disseminated Tumor Cell Escape from Dormancy and Bone Metastatic Tumor Growth.', 'Circulating prostate cancer cells have differential resistance to fluid shear stress-induced cell death.', 'The landscape of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in sarcomas: looking beyond pazopanib.', 'EGR1 regulates angiogenic and osteoclastogenic factors in prostate cancer and promotes metastasis.']"""

Dose escalation improves local response rates but is limited by tolerance in normal tissues. A sphingosine analogue, FTY720 (fingolimod), a drug currently in phase III studies for treatment of multiple sclerosis, has been found to be a potent apoptosis inducer in prostate cancer cells. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we analyzed the impact of FTY720 on sphingolipid metabolism in hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer cells and evaluated its potential as a radiosensitizer on cell lines and prostate tumor xenografts. In prostate cancer cell lines, FTY720 acted as a sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) inhibitor that induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis in a manner independent of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. In contrast, γ irradiation did not affect SphK1 activity in prostate cancer cells yet synergized with FTY720 to inhibit SphK1. In mice bearing orthotopic or s.c. prostate cancer tumors, we show that FTY720 dramatically increased radiotherapeutic sensitivity, reducing tumor growth and metastasis without toxic side effects.

Participants were aged 50-71 years without a cancer diagnosis at baseline in 1995. Analysing 8134 cases of prostate cancer, Cox regression was used to estimate the association between offspring number and prostate cancer incidence while accounting for socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics.  Results:   When examining the entire cohort, there was no relationship between fatherhood and incident prostate cancer [hazard ratio (HR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86-1.02]. However, after stratifying for prostate cancer screening, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) unscreened childless men had a lower risk of prostate cancer (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.91) compared with fathers due to the interaction between PSA screening and fatherhood (P for interaction < 0.01). A trend for the lower risk of prostate cancer among unscreened fathers compared with childless men was seen for low-grade prostate cancer (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-1.01), high-grade prostate cancer (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37-1.04) and even fatal prostate cancer (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07-1.12).

Compared with patients who underwent ureteroscopic or extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsies, those who underwent percutaneous lithotripsy had significantly worse mean scores for all the SF-36 scales, except for body pain. Factors impacting HRQOL of the patients were age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and stone characteristics such as localization (in the kidney) and recurrence (multiple lithotripsies).  Conclusions:   Post-lithotripsy, patients have a favorable HRQOL compared with healthy volunteers.

While we and others have previously shown that the oncogenic Pim kinases stimulate survival of hematopoietic cells, we now examined their putative role in regulating motility of adherent cancer cells. For this purpose, we inhibited Pim kinase activity using a small molecule compound, 1,10-dihydropyrrolo[2,3-a]carbazole-3-carbaldehyde (DHPCC-9), which we had recently identified as a potent and selective inhibitor for all Pim family members.  Results:   We now demonstrate that the Pim kinase inhibitor DHPCC-9 is very effective also in cell-based assays. DHPCC-9 impairs the anti-apoptotic effects of Pim-1 in cytokine-deprived myeloid cells and inhibits intracellular phosphorylation of Pim substrates such as Bad. Moreover, DHPCC-9 slows down migration and invasion of cancer cells derived from either prostate cancer or squamocellular carcinoma patients. Silencing of Pim expression reduces cell motility, while Pim overexpression enhances it, strongly suggesting that the observed effects of DHPCC-9 are dependent on Pim kinase activity. Interestingly, DHPCC-9 also abrogates NFATc-dependent migration of cancer cells, implying that NFATc factors mediate at least part of the pro-migratory effects of Pim kinases.  Conclusions:   Altogether, our data indicate that DHPCC-9 is not only a powerful tool to investigate physiological effects of the oncogenic Pim family kinases, but also an attractive molecule for drug development to inhibit invasiveness of Pim-overexpressing cancer cells.""","""['Niina M Santio', 'Riitta L Vahakoski', 'Eeva-Marja Rainio', 'Jouko A Sandholm', 'Sanna S Virtanen', 'Michelle Prudhomme', 'Fabrice Anizon', 'Pascale Moreau', 'Päivi J Koskinen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Pim Kinases Promote Migration and Metastatic Growth of Prostate Cancer Xenografts.', 'Tricyclic Benzocdazulenes selectively inhibit activities of Pim kinases and restrict growth of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cells.', 'Rational Design of a Potent Pan-Pim Kinases Inhibitor with a Rhodanine-Benzoimidazole Structure.', 'PIM kinases: From survival factors to regulators of cell motility.', 'Pim kinases in hematological malignancies: where are we now and where are we going?', 'Pim Kinases: Important Regulators of Cardiovascular Disease.', 'Retraction statement: miR-944 inhibits metastasis of gastric cancer by preventing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition via MACC1/Met/AKT signaling.', 'Retraction statement: Ubiquitin ligase SMURF1 functions as a prognostic marker and promotes growth and metastasis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Stabilization of PIM Kinases in Hypoxia Is Mediated by the Deubiquitinase USP28.', 'Relationship between the transcriptional expression of PIM1 and local control in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas treated with radiotherapy.']"""

The present study revealed that androgen increases glucose utilization for de novo lipogenesis in LNCaP cells through the activation of HK2 (hexokinase 2) and activation of the cardiac isoform of PFKFB2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase). Activation of PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) by androgen increased phosphorylation of CREB [CRE (cAMP-response element)-binding protein], which in turn bound to CRE on the promoter of the HK2 gene resulting in transcriptional activation of the HK2 gene. Up-regulation of PFKFB2 expression was mediated by the direct binding of ligand-activated androgen receptor to the PFKFB2 promoter. The activated PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt signalling pathway in LNCaP cells contributes to the phosphorylation of PFKFB2 at Ser466 and Ser483, resulting in the constitutive activation of PFK-2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase) activity. Glucose uptake and lipogenesis were severely blocked by knocking-down of PFKFB2 using siRNA (small interfering RNA) or by inhibition of PFK-2 activity with LY294002 treatment.

In this study, both in vivo selection and in vivo screening of phage displaying foreign peptides were utilized to best predict peptides with the pharmacokinetic properties necessary for translation into efficacious in vivo imaging agents. An in vivo selection of phage display libraries was performed in SCID mice bearing human PC-3 prostate carcinoma tumors. Eight randomly selected phage clones and four control phage clones were fluorescently labeled with AlexaFluor 680 for subsequent in vivo screening and analyses. The corresponding peptides of six of these phage clones were tested as 111In-labeled peptide conjugates for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of PC-3 prostate carcinomas. Two peptide sequences, G1 and H5, were successful as in vivo imaging agents. The affinities of G1 and H5 peptides for cultured PC-3 cells were then analyzed via cell flow cytometry resulting in Kd values of 1.8 µM and 2.2 µM, respectively. The peptides bound preferentially to prostate tumor cell lines compared to that of other carcinoma and normal cell lines, and H5 appeared to possess cytotoxic properties.

Results:   Abrogation of CRAMP expression led to decreased proliferation, invasion, type IV collagenase, and the amount of phosphorylated Erk1/2 and Akt signaling in vitro.

Our objective was to determine the prevalence of FGFR3 mutations in a subset of prostate tumors. Next, determine the prevalence of FGFR3 mutations in PCa patients with coexistent tumors in other tissues.  Methods:   Primary and locally advanced prostate tumors (n =132) were collected at our medical center. From the 132 PCa patients, 28 (21%) were diagnosed with coexistent primary tumors (bladder, skin, pancreas, renal cell, gastric, colon, hepatic, and lung). Tumors were analyzed by FGFR3 mutation analysis on exon 7, 10, and 15, known to harbor the most frequent mutations.  Results:   The prevalence of FGFR3 mutations in patients with only PCa was 0%. Most PCa patients presented with coexistent bladder (n=12) and bladder and skin tumors (n =7).

FGFR3 mutations were detected in 9/15 (60%) analyzed bladder tumors.  Conclusions:   FGFR3 mutations were absent in the investigated prostate tumors, suggesting a minor role of these mutations in tumorigenesis.

However, the mechanisms determining the development of this phenotype are not well understood. Prostate cancer cells secrete several osteogenic factors including Wnt proteins, which are not only osteoinductive but also oncogenic. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to investigate the contribution of the Wnt signaling pathway in prostate cancer growth, incidence of bone metastases, and osteoblastic phenotype of bone metastases. The strategy involved overexpressing the Wnt antagonist, DKK-1, in the mixed osteoblastic and osteolytic Ace-1 prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Ace-1 prostate cancer cells stably expressing human DKK-1 or empty vector were established and transduced with lentiviral yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-luciferase (Luc). The Ace-1/vector(YFP-LUC) and Ace-1/DKK-1(YFP-LUC) cells were injected subcutaneously, intratibially, or in the left cardiac ventricle in athymic mice.  Results:   Unexpectedly, DKK-1 significantly increased Ace-1 subcutaneous tumor mass and the incidence of bone metastases after intracardiac injection of Ace-1 cells. DKK-1 increased Ace-1 tumor growth associated with increased phospho46 c-Jun amino-terminal kinase by the Wnt noncanonical pathway. As expected, DKK-1 decreased the Ace-1 osteoblastic phenotype of bone metastases, as confirmed by radiographic, histopathologic, and microcomputed tomographic analysis. DKK-1 decreased osteoblastic activity via the Wnt canonical pathway evidenced by an inhibition of T-cell factor activity in murine osteoblast precursor ST2 cells.

Gene expression analyses show that miRNA activity is stronger in PCs. This conclusion is consolidated by target protein expression. We simultaneously collected 6 independent miRNA expression datasets, where great inconsistency is present in the expression difference between PCs and NTs. The overall correlation between miRNA activity and expression is very weak. However, meta-analysis demonstrated that the expressions of 114 individual miRNAs agree with their activities. Additionally, we detected two other factors associated with higher miRNA activity in PCs. One is deregulation of some key miRNA-repression related genes, such as the over-expression of Dicer, TRBP and Ago2, and the under-expression of IRP1 in PCs. The other is that miRNA-mRNA binding site efficacy has significant positive correlation with miRNA activity, whereas no correlation with miRNA expression.

NAMPT has crucial roles for many cellular functions by regulating NAD(+)-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase. However, roles of NAMPT in cancer are poorly defined. In this study, we show that NAMPT is prominently overexpressed in human prostate cancer cells along with SIRT1. Elevation of NAMPT expression occurs early for the prostate neoplasia. Inhibition of NAMPT significantly suppresses cell growth in culture, soft agar colony formation, cell invasion and growth of xenografted prostate cancer cells in mice. NAMPT knockdown sensitizes prostate cancer cells to oxidative stress caused by H(2)O(2) or chemotherapeutic treatment. Overexpression of NAMPT increases prostate cancer cell resistance to oxidative stress, which is partially blocked by SIRT1 knockdown. We demonstrate that in addition to modulating SIRT1 functions, the NAMPT inhibition reduces forkhead box, class 'O' (FOXO)3a protein expression and its downstream anti-oxidant genes catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase. Our results suggest important roles of concomitant upregulation of NAMPT and SIRT1 along with increased FOXO3a protein level for prostate carcinogenesis and their contribution to oxidative stress resistance of prostate cancer cells. These findings may have implications for exploring the NAMPT pathway for prostate cancer prevention and treatment.""","""['B Wang', 'M K Hasan', 'E Alvarado', 'H Yuan', 'H Wu', 'W Y Chen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['NAMPT pathway is involved in the FOXO3a-mediated regulation of GADD45A expression.', 'Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase regulates cocaine reward through Sirtuin 1.', 'Regenerative Neurogenesis After Ischemic Stroke Promoted by Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase-Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Cascade.', 'The importance of NAMPT/NAD/SIRT1 in the systemic regulation of metabolism and ageing.', 'The regulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis by Nampt/PBEF/visfatin in mammals.', 'The Role of NAD+, SIRTs Interactions in Stimulating and Counteracting Carcinogenesis.', 'Chemistry-led investigations into the mode of action of NAMPT activators, resulting in the discovery of non-pyridyl class NAMPT activators.', 'NAD pool as an antitumor target against cancer stem cells in head and neck cancer.', 'Prediction of Cervical Cancer Outcome by Identifying and Validating a NAD+ Metabolism-Derived Gene Signature.', 'Integrating Pharmacogenomics Data-Driven Computational Drug Prediction with Single-Cell RNAseq to Demonstrate the Efficacy of a NAMPT Inhibitor against Aggressive, Taxane-Resistant, and Stem-like Cells in Lethal Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, this is an underestimate caused by (i) including in the 20% the years before the impact of the first screen becomes manifest, and (ii) not having full information for the follow-up years where the effects of the screening are most apparent. This paper provides a re-analysis of the results using time-specific measures, which avoid the first of these sources of error.  Methods:   Mortality rate ratios for follow-up years 1-12 were derived from the yearly numbers of prostate cancer deaths and numbers of men being followed in each arm of the ERSPC. To reduce statistical noise, they were based on moving three-year intervals, and a smooth rate ratio curve was fitted to the yearly data, in order to measure the steady state reduction in mortality and to identify the time at which it reached this level.  Results:   The re-analysis suggests that the sustained reduction in prostate cancer mortality may be more than 50%.  Conclusion:   Re-analysis of the ERSPC data suggests that if screening is carried out for several years, and if follow-up is pursued until the reduction becomes manifest, the reduction in mortality will be 50-60%. An analysis that includes the 2007-2008 follow-up data is required to quantify more precisely the impact of this intervention.""","""['James A Hanley']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Med Screen""","""['Screening for prostate cancer.', 'The efficacy of prostate-specific antigen screening: Impact of key components in the ERSPC and PLCO trials.', 'Contamination in control group led to no effect of PSA-based screening on prostate cancer mortality at 9\xa0years follow-up: Results of the French section of European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Screening and prostate cancer mortality: results of the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) at 13 years of follow-up.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Mammograms and Mortality: How Has the Evidence Evolved?', 'Disaggregating the mortality reductions due to cancer screening: model-based estimates from population-based data.', 'Recovering the raw data behind a non-parametric survival curve.', 'What do the screening trials really tell us and where do we go from here?', 'Measuring the mortality impact of breast cancer screening.']"""

Methods:   Twenty-one patients with untreated localized prostate cancer, diagnosed using transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy, were prospectively enrolled. Cancer laterality was based on the percentage of cancer and the highest Gleason score determined from biopsies. In addition to PET/CT, 3-dimensional (1)H-MRS of the entire prostate volume using a quantitative approach was performed. The imaging and histologic findings of 8 patients undergoing subsequent prostatectomy were compared on a sextant level. For each lobe and sextant, standardized uptake values (SUVs) and (choline + creatine + polyamines)-to-citrate (CCP/C) ratios were obtained from (11)C-acetate PET/CT and (1)H-MRS, respectively. The visual and quantitative findings on PET/CT and MRI data were compared with cancer laterality and aggressiveness based on the Gleason score and with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity and international risk group classification.  Results:   The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, on a lobar level using visual analysis, of (11)C-acetate PET/CT were 80%, 29%, 71%, respectively, and 89%, 29%, 79%, respectively, using contrast-enhanced MRI. The sensitivity and accuracy of (11)C-acetate PET/CT decreased to 64% and 63% and specificity increased to 62% when sextant analysis was performed. The agreement between prostate cancer laterality based on biopsy findings and visual interpretation of (11)C-acetate PET/CT and contrast-enhanced MRI was similar at 71%.

Despite increased protein levels, the oxidized forms of nuclear Trx1 were higher in prostate cancer cell lines compared to their benign counterparts, suggesting that nuclear redox imbalance occurred selectively in cancer cells. A growth-stimulating dose of androgen caused transient oxidation of Trx1 in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells only, suggesting a loss of both androgen- and redox-signaling mechanisms during cancer progression. Androgen-independent PC3 cells showed a significant increase in nuclear and cytoplasmic Trx1 protein levels, but a significant decrease in total Trx activity. Trx1 redox state and activity correlated with the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to pro-oxidant agents, and downregulation of Trx1 sensitized cancer cells to these agents.

Increasing evidence indicates that many cancers contain small populations of resistant, stem-like cells that have the capacity to regenerate tumors following chemotherapy and radiation, and have been linked to the initiation of metastases. Our goal is to discover natural product-based clinical or dietary interventions that selectively target cancer stem cells, inducing differentiation. We adapted an alkaline phosphatase (AP) stain to assay plant extracts for the capacity to induce differentiation in embryonic stem (ES) cells. AP is a characteristic marker of undifferentiated ES cells, and this represents a novel approach to screening medicinal plant extracts. Following a survey of approximately 100 fractions obtained from 12 species of ethnomedically utilized plants, we found fractions from 3 species that induced differentiation, decreasing AP and transcript levels of pluripotency markers (Nanog, Oct-4, Rex-1). These fractions affected proliferation of murine ES, and human embryonal, prostate, and breast carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner.

Pro-B3 inhibited both p300-dependent and agonist-induced AR transcription. We demonstrate that the p300-mediated AR acetylation is critical for the hormone responsiveness of AR. Interestingly, B3 treatment efficiently enhanced the antagonist activity of flutamide through suppression of p300 HAT activity, demonstrating that relative p300 activity is critical for the antagonist action.

Using a sandwich format, high sensitivity and selectivity were achieved by combining the lectin-based biosensor with the {lectin-Au-Th} bioconjugates featuring lectin and thionine (Th) labels linked to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for signal amplification. The proposed strategy demonstrated that mannose exhibited high expression levels in both normal and cancer cells, while sialic acid was more abundant in cancer cells as compared to normal ones. The results were in good agreement with those from fluorescent microscopy studies. The differences in the two glycan expression indicated that sialic acid could serve as a potential biomarker for early cancer detection. The lectin-based biosensor was also successfully used to quantify cancer cells and evaluate the average amount of sialic acid on single cell surface, which could supply significant information on glycan functions in cancer progression. Overall, the lectin-based electrochemical biosensor provides an effective pathway to analyze glycan expression on living cells and may greatly facilitate the medical diagnosis and treatment in early process of cancer.""","""['Xinai Zhang', 'Yingqiao Teng', 'Ying Fu', 'Lili Xu', 'Shengping Zhang', 'Bei He', 'Chuangui Wang', 'Wen Zhang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Microgravimetric lectin biosensor based on signal amplification using carbohydrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles.', 'Design and implementation of electrochemical cytosensor for evaluation of cell surface carbohydrate and glycoprotein.', 'Carbohydrate derivative-functionalized biosensing toward highly sensitive electrochemical detection of cell surface glycan expression as cancer biomarker.', 'Recent Progress in Lectin-Based Biosensors.', 'Glyconanotechnology.', 'Recent Development of Nanomaterials-Based Cytosensors for the Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Structure-function and application of plant lectins in disease biology and immunity.', 'Nonenzymatic Amperometric Aptamer Cytosensor for Ultrasensitive Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells and Dynamic Evaluation of Cell Surface N-Glycan Expression.', 'Lectins, Interconnecting Proteins with Biotechnological/Pharmacological and Therapeutic Applications.', 'Recent Progress in Electrochemical Biosensors for Glycoproteins.']"""

Cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) is defined as the lack of any detectable primary site after full evaluation, and accounts for approximately 3-5% of all newly diagnosed patients with malignancies. The aim of this report was to present the prognostic and predictive value of 8 serum tumor markers in this group of patients.  Methods:   The study involved 63 patients. On histological examination, all the patients were presented with metastatic tumors whose primary site (origin) could not be detected with noninvasive diagnostic techniques. Following the routine light microscopy, all histological findings were classified into one of the following three groups: plano-cellular carcinoma--8 patients; adenocarcinoma--33 patients; unclassifiable (undifferentiated) carcinoma--22 patients. In all the cases we evaluated 8 serum tumor markers: alpha-fetoproteins (AFP), chronic gonadotrophin beta submit, human (beta-HCG), neuron specific enolase (NSE), marker of malignant ovarian tumors (CA 125), prostate-specific antigene (PSA), marker of malignant brest tumor (CA 15-3), marker of malignant pancreas tumor and gastrointestinal tumor (Ca 19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) at the time of diagnosis. The patients on chemotherapy had the markers determined after the third and sixth chemocycle, i.e. at the time of illness progression observation, if present. The patients responding to chemotherapy with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) had the markers determined after three-month periods until the time of relapse or progression. Chemotherapy was applied in 32 patients (20 females and 12 males), aged 29-70 years, who met the inclusion criteria. The following chemotherapy regimen was used: doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 (day 1), cisplatin 60 mg/m2 (day 1), and etoposide 120 mg/m2 (days 1-3). The period between two chemotherapy cycles was three weeks, and maximum five weeks in the case of prolonged hematological toxicity.  Results:   Most commonly elevated were NSE values (82.54%), while AFP values were least commonly elevated (11.11%). Average survival time was 17.89 months (95% CI 12.96; 22.83). The probability of 24 months' survival was 0.228. The group of 32 patients treated with chemotherapy had 12 (37.5%) fatal outcomes in the observed period (72 months). Average survival time was 26.6 months (95% CI 19.5; 33.7). Average tumor marker values before and after the chemotherapy were significantly lower for NSE and CA 125. Survival was significantly better in cases of NSE and CA 125 decrease of more than 20%.  Conclusion:   Increased values of serum tumor markers are very often in CUP. The tumors show nonspecific overexpression of tumor markers. The NSE and CA 125 levels show good correlation with response to the given chemotherapy. However, a routine evaluation of commonly used serum tumor markers has not been proven of any prognostic and predictive assistance.""","""['Ivica Pejcić', 'Svetislav Vrbić', 'Sladjana Filipović', 'Mirjana Sćekić', 'Ivan Petković', 'Ljiljana Pejcić', 'Nebojsa Djenić']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Vojnosanit Pregl""","""['Evaluation of six tumor markers in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary.', 'Normal serum neuron specific enolase (NSE) value after the first cycle of chemotherapy: an early predictor of complete response and survival in patients with small cell lung carcinoma.', 'Chemotherapy in carcinomas of unknown primary site.', 'Liver metastases from cancer of unknown primary (CUPL): a retrospective analysis of presentation, management and prognosis in 49 patients and systematic review of the literature.', 'Metastatic cancers of unknown primary site.']"""

This study examined the patterns of change in dyadic communication between patients with prostate cancer and their partners, and also determined if certain factors affected their communication over time.  Method:   Using multilevel modeling, this study analyzed longitudinal data obtained from a randomized clinical trial with prostate cancer patients and their partners, to examine their communication over time. Patients and partners (N=134 pairs) from the usual-care control group independently completed baseline demographic assessment and measures of social support, uncertainty, symptom distress, and dyadic communication at baseline, and 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups.  Results:   The results indicated that (1) patients and partners reported similar levels of open communication at the time of diagnosis. Communication reported by patients and partners decreased over time in a similar trend, regardless of phase of illness; (2) phase of illness affected couples' open communication at diagnosis but not patterns of change over time; and (3) couples' perceived communication increased as they reported more social support, less uncertainty, and fewer hormonal symptoms in patients. Couples' demographic factors and general symptoms, and patients' prostate cancer-specific symptoms did not affect their levels of open communication.  Conclusions:   Perceived open communication between prostate cancer patients and partners over time is affected by certain baseline and time-varying psychosocial and cancer-related factors.

The 5b isoform is secreted by osteoclasts and has recently been advocated as a serum marker for bone metastasis in breast cancer patients. The 5a isoform, on the other hand, is not bone-derived and has been proposed to be a marker of activated macrophages and chronic inflammation. In this study, expression of TRAP protein and enzymatic activity in bone metastases from different primary sites was examined. TRAP activity was high in bone metastases from prostate cancer, intermediate in breast cancer, and low in lung and kidney cancers. The partially purified TRAP from breast cancer bone metastasis samples exhibited the enzymatic characteristics of purple acid phosphatase. Both 5a and 5b isoforms were expressed in bone metastases of different histogenetic origins, i.e. prostate, breast, lung and kidney, and also a novel previously unreported 42 kDa variant of the TRAP 5a isoform was identified in bone metastases. This novel TRAP 5a isoform was absent in human bone, indicating that the 42 kDa variant is specific to metastatic cancer tissue. Immunohistochemistry revealed that metastatic cancer cells were the predominant source of TRAP 5a, whereas tumor-associated macrophages and occasionally multinucleated giant cells in the tumor stroma preferentially expressed the proteolytically processed TRAP 5b variant. Our results indicate the presence of a previously unstudied variant of monomeric TRAP 5a in cancer cells, which may have functional and diagnostic implications. Moreover, the presence of TRAP-positive macrophages in bone metastases could, together with cancer cells and osteoclasts, contribute to the elevated levels of serum TRAP activity observed in patients with bone metastases.""","""['Serhan Zenger', 'Wentao He', 'Barbro Ek-Rylander', 'Daphne Vassiliou', 'Rickard Wedin', 'Henrik Bauer', 'Göran Andersson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Biogenesis of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoforms 5a and 5b in stably transfected MDA-MB-231 breast cancer epithelial cells.', 'The small chemical enzyme inhibitor 5-phenylnicotinic acid/CD13 inhibits cell migration and invasion of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase/ACP5-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.', 'A Novel Sandwich ELISA for Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase 5a and 5b Protein Reveals that Both Isoforms are Secreted by Differentiating Osteoclasts and Correlate to the Type I Collagen Degradation Marker CTX-I In Vivo and In Vitro.', 'Disease-specific expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoforms.', 'Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b as serum marker of bone metabolism in cancer patients.', 'RANK promotes colorectal cancer migration and invasion by activating the Ca2+-calcineurin/NFATC1-ACP5 axis.', 'Kockdown of ACP5 inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma progression.', 'Lung Cancer Cells Derived Circulating miR-21 Promotes Differentiation of Monocytes into Osteoclasts.', 'Intensive weight gain therapy in patients with anorexia nervosa results in improved serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 5a and 5b isoform protein levels.', 'Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP/ACP5) promotes metastasis-related properties via TGFβ2/TβR and CD44 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.']"""

The promoter location of the risk allele, and its ability to reduce promoter activity, suggested that the rs10993994 risk allele could result in lowered MSMB in benign tissue leading to increased prostate cancer risk.  Methodology/principal findings:   MSMB expression in benign and malignant prostate tissue was examined using immunohistochemistry and compared with the rs10993994 genotype. Urinary MSMB concentrations were determined by ELISA and correlated with urinary PSA, the presence or absence of cancer, rs10993994 genotype and age of onset. MSMB levels in prostate tissue and urine were greatly reduced with tumourigenesis. Urinary MSMB was better than urinary PSA at differentiating men with prostate cancer at all Gleason grades. The high risk allele was associated with heterogeneity of MSMB staining and loss of MSMB in both tissue and urine in benign prostate.  Conclusions:   These data show that some high risk alleles discovered using genome-wide association studies produce phenotypic effects with potential clinical utility.

We tested nearly 800 PCa samples, using a combination of real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The PCR reactions were simultaneously monitored for amplification of a single-copy human gene, to confirm the quality of the sample DNA and its suitability for PCR. Controls showed that the PCR assay could detect the XMRV in a single infected cell, even in the presence of a 10,000-fold excess of uninfected human cells. The IHC used 2 rabbit polyclonal antisera, each prepared against a purified murine leukemia virus (MLV) protein. Both antisera always stained XMRV-infected or -transfected cells, but never stained control cells. No evidence for XMRV in PCa was obtained in these experiments. We discuss possible explanations for the discrepancies in the results from different laboratories.

Objective:   We tested the hypothesis that significant differences in survival rates may exist among PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), radiation therapy (RT), and observation.  Design, setting, and participants:   We focused on 404,604 patients with clinically localized PCa within 17 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registries.  Measurements:   Competing-risks survival analyses were used to estimate cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) rates. Patients were stratified according to treatment type, age group, and PCa risk group (high risk: T2c and/or Gleason score 8-10; low to intermediate risk: all others).  Results and limitations:   The 10-yr CSM and OCM rates were 6.1% and 29.2%, respectively. In RP, RT, and observation patients, CSM rates were 3.6%, 6.5%, and 10.8% (p<0.001), respectively; OCM rates were 17.1%, 32.4%, and 48.9% (p<0.001), respectively. In low- to intermediate-risk patients, the lowest CSM (1.3-3.7%) and OCM (6.9-31.6%) rates within all age categories except octogenarians (8.9% and 62.8%, respectively) were recorded in RP. In high-risk patients, the lowest CSM (5.8-7.2%) and OCM (8.7-16.1%) rates in patients aged ≤69 yr were also recorded in RP. RT was equally favorable to RP in the 70-79 age category and appeared ideal in all octogenarian patients.  Conclusions:   Our results showed that RP provides the most favorable survival rates in most patients. The exception is octogenarian men, in whom RT provides the best results. Finally, the least-favorable outcomes were recorded after observation.

Background:   It was hypothesized that an e-mail-based intervention termed ""spaced education"" could reduce clinicians' inappropriate screening for prostate cancer.  Design:   The study was conducted as an RCT.  Setting/participants:   The study involved 95 primary care clinicians in eight Veterans Affairs medical centers from January 2007 to February 2009.  Intervention:   Participants were randomized into two cohorts: spaced education clinicians received four isomorphic cycles of nine e-mails over 36 weeks (zero to two e-mails per week), whereas control clinicians received no intervention. Each e-mail presented a clinical scenario and asked whether it was appropriate to obtain a PSA test. Participants received immediate feedback after submitting their answers.  Main outcome measures:   The primary outcome was the number and percentage of inappropriate PSA screening tests ordered. Inappropriate testing was defined as use of PSA for prostate cancer screening in patients aged >76 or <40 years. Appropriateness of screening was dichotomized based on patient age at time of screening. Patients with PSA testing for non-screening reasons were excluded using a validated protocol. Logistic regression with adjustment for patient clustering by clinician was performed. Analyses were conducted in 2009.  Results:   During the intervention period (Weeks 1-36), clinicians receiving spaced education e-mails ordered significantly fewer inappropriate PSA screening tests than control clinicians (10.5% vs 14.2%, p=0.041). Over the 72-week period following the intervention (Weeks 37-108), spaced education clinicians continued to order fewer inappropriate tests compared to controls (7.8% vs 13.1%, respectively, p=0.011), representing a 40% relative reduction in inappropriate screening.

Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a potent mitogen in many cell types, including osteoblasts. In human prostate cancer DU145 cells, FSK (1 μM) and FGF2 (10 ng/ml) increased BSP and Runx2 mRNA and protein levels at 3 and 12h, respectively.

Treatment of DU145 cells with FSK (1 μM) and FGF2 (10 ng/ml) increased the luciferase activities of constructs between -60LUC to -927LUC and -108LUC to -927LUC, including the human BSP gene promoter. Effects of FSK and FGF2 abrogated in constructs included 2bp mutations in the two cAMP response elements (CRE1 and CRE2). Luciferase activities induced by FSK and FGF2 were blocked by protein kinase A and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Gel mobility shift analyses showed that FSK and FGF2 increased the binding of CRE1 and CRE2.

Data on the efficacy of combining androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with 125I-TPPB in this group remain limited and consequently the guidelines of the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) provide no firm recommendations.  Methods/design:   Seed and Hormone for Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer (SHIP) 0804 is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, controlled study that will investigate the impact of adjuvant ADT following neoadjuvant ADT and 125I-TPPB. Prior to the end of March, 2011, a total of 420 patients with intermediate-risk, localized PCa will be enrolled and randomized to one of two treatment arms. These patients will be recruited from 20 institutions, all of which have broad experience of 125I-TPPB. Pathological slides will be centrally reviewed to confirm patient eligibility. The patients will initially undergo 3-month ADT prior to 125I-TPPB. Those randomly assigned to adjuvant therapy will subsequently undergo 9 months of adjuvant ADT. All participants will be assessed at baseline and at the following intervals: every 3 months for the first 24 months following 125I-TPPB, every 6 months during the 24- to 60-month post-125I-TPPB interval, annually between 60 and 84 months post-125I-TPPB, and on the 10th anniversary of treatment.The primary endpoint is biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS). Secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), clinical progression-free survival, disease-specific survival, salvage therapy non-adaptive interval, acceptability (assessed using the international prostate symptom score [IPSS]), quality of life (QOL) evaluation, and adverse events.

A rise in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, however, may be noticed in some patients during follow-up. The aim of this study was to determine whether the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) urinary test would help identify patients who were in need of a prostate biopsy.  Patients and methods:   The PSA of all patients undergoing PVP were analyzed. Patients with an elevated (above reference range) or rising PSA level (defined as > 0.75 ng/mL/year if the PSA was between 4.1 and 10 or a doubling time of less than 2 years) were offered a transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy. Before the biopsy procedure, all patients had a PCA3 test. The relationships between PSA, PCA3, and TRUS prostate biopsy findings were analyzed to determine sensitivity and specificity for the PCA3 test in this setting.  Results:   50 patients were identified. The mean age was 69.97 (range 57-83) years. The mean PSA level was 10.1 ng/mL (range 3.03-44.2 ng/mL). Six patients were found to have prostate cancer. Of those, five patients had a positive PCA3 test. One patient had a negative PCA3 test but positive biopsy findings. This gives a sensitivity of 83.3%, and a positive predictive value of 21.7%. The negative predictive value was 96%.  Conclusion:   The results suggest that a negative PCA3 test in our group of patients is a good predictor of negative biopsy results. The low positive predictive value may be an artefact of the group size.

Methods:   Model parameters from literature were used in this evaluation. The treatment techniques included external (standard fractionated, hypofractionated, and dose-escalated) three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy (I-125 seeds), and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (Ir-192 source). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the rectum, bladder, and urethra retrieved from corresponding treatment planning systems were converted to biological effective dose-based and equivalent dose-based DVHs, respectively, in order to account for differences in radiation treatment modality and fractionation schedule.  Results:   Results indicated that with hypofractionated 3D-CRT (20 fractions of 2.75 Gy/fraction delivered five times/week to total dose of 55 Gy), NTCP of the rectum, bladder, and urethra were less than those for standard fractionated 3D-CRT using a four-field technique (32 fractions of 2 Gy/fraction delivered five times/week to total dose of 64 Gy) and dose-escalated 3D-CRT. Rectal and bladder NTCPs (5.2% and 6.6%, respectively) following the dose-escalated four-field 3D-CRT (2 Gy/fraction to total dose of 74 Gy) were the highest among analyzed treatment techniques. The average NTCP for the rectum and urethra were 0.6% and 24.7% for LDR-BT and 0.5% and 11.2% for HDR-BT.  Conclusions:   Although brachytherapy techniques resulted in delivering larger equivalent doses to normal tissues, the corresponding NTCPs were lower than those of external beam techniques other than the urethra because of much smaller volumes irradiated to higher doses. Among analyzed normal tissues, the femoral heads were found to have the lowest probability of complications as most of their volume was irradiated to lower equivalent doses compared to other tissues.""","""['Rungdham Takam', 'Eva Bezak', 'Eric E Yeoh', 'Loredana Marcu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Dosimetric considerations to determine the optimal technique for localized prostate cancer among external photon, proton, or carbon-ion therapy and high-dose-rate or low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Dosimetry and radiobiologic model comparison of IMRT and 3D conformal radiotherapy in treatment of carcinoma of the prostate.', 'The radiobiology of prostate cancer including new aspects of fractionated radiotherapy.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'A treatment planning study of urethra-sparing intensity-modulated proton therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Influence of Urethra Sparing on Tumor Control Probability and Normal Tissue Complication Probability in Focal Dose Escalated Hypofractionated Radiotherapy: A Planning Study Based on Histopathology Reference.', 'External Validation of a Predictive Model of Urethral Strictures for Prostate Patients Treated With HDR Brachytherapy Boost.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Interfractional Variations for Post-prostatectomy Radiotherapy to the Prostatic Fossa-Relevance for the Frequency of Position Verification Imaging and Treatment Adaptation.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Interfractional Variations in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy-Implications for Imaging Frequency and Treatment Adaptation.']"""

Methods:   The iterative forward projection matching (IFPM) algorithm finds the 3D seed geometry that minimizes the sum of the squared intensity differences between computed projections of an initial estimate of the seed configuration and radiographic projections of the implant. In-house machined phantoms, containing arrays of 12 and 72 seeds, respectively, are used to validate this method. Also, four 103Pd postimplant patients are scanned using an ACUITY digital simulator. Three to ten x-ray images are selected from the CBCT projection set and processed to create binary seed-only images. To quantify IFPM accuracy, the reconstructed seed positions are forward projected and overlaid on the measured seed images to find the nearest-neighbor distance between measured and computed seed positions for each image pair. Also, the estimated 3D seed coordinates are compared to known seed positions in the phantom and clinically obtained VariSeed planning coordinates for the patient data.  Results:   For the phantom study, seed localization error is (0.58 +/- 0.33) mm. For all four patient cases, the mean registration error is better than 1 mm while compared against the measured seed projections. IFPM converges in 20-28 iterations, with a computation time of about 1.9-2.8 min/ iteration on a 1 GHz processor.  Conclusions:   The IFPM algorithm avoids the need to match corresponding seeds in each projection as required by standard back-projection methods. The authors' results demonstrate approximately 1 mm accuracy in reconstructing the 3D positions of brachytherapy seeds from the measured 2D projections.

The purposes of this article are to propose a new management strategy and to compare this strategy to the conventional isocenter shift method and the previously proposed MLC-shifting method.  Methods:   To cope with two target volumes (one moving and one immobile), the authors propose a new management strategy referred to as multiple adaptive plans (MAPs). This strategy involves the creation of a pool of plans for a number of potential prostate locations. Without requiring any additional hardware or software, the MAP strategy is to choose a plan from the pool that most closely matches the ""prostate position of the day."" This position can be determined by dual image registrations: One aligned to the implant markers in the prostate and the other aligned to the pelvic bones. This strategy was clinically implemented for a special patient with high risk prostate cancer and pathologically confirmed positive pelvic lymph nodes, requiring concurrent IMRT treatment of the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes. Because this patient had an abdominal kidney, small planning margins around the both targets were desired. Using 17 daily acquired megavoltage cone beam CTs (CBCTs), three sets of validation plans were calculated to retrospectively evaluate the MAP strategy as well as the isoshifting and MLC-shifting strategies.  Results:   According to the validation plans, MAP, isoshifting, and MLC-shifting strategies resulted in D95 of the prostate > 95% of the daily dose on 65%, 100%, and 100% treatment days, respectively. Similarly, D95 of the pelvic lymph nodal was > 95% of the daily dose on 100%, 75%, and 94% of treatment days, respectively.  Conclusions:   None of the above strategies simultaneously achieved all treatment goals. Among the three strategies, the MLC shifting was most successful. Validation plans based on daily CBCTs are useful to evaluate the effectiveness of the motion management strategies and to provide additional dose guidance if further dose compensation is needed.""","""['Ping Xia', 'Peng Qi', 'Andrew Hwang', 'Erica Kinsey', 'Jean Pouliot', 'Mack Roach rd']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Offline multiple adaptive planning strategy for concurrent irradiation of the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes.', 'Effect of MLC leaf width on treatment adaptation and accuracy for concurrent irradiation of prostate and pelvic lymph nodes.', 'An algorithm for shifting MLC shapes to adjust for daily prostate movement during concurrent treatment with pelvic lymph nodes.', 'Does pelvic irradiation play a role in the management of prostate cancer?', 'New approaches for effective and safe pelvic radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Centric Versus Bony-Centric Registration in the Definitive Treatment of Node-Positive Prostate Cancer with Simultaneous Integrated Boost: A Dosimetric Comparison.', 'Stability of daily rectal movement and effectiveness of replanning protocols for sparing rectal doses based on the daily CT images during proton treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Sensitivity of array detector measurements in determining shifts of MLC leaf positions.', 'Quantifying target-specific motion in anal cancer patients treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).', 'Management of prostate cancer patients with lymph node involvement: a rapidly evolving paradigm.']"""

Our goal was to determine if anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC is useful in the detection of prostate carcinoma.  Procedures:   Five patients with elevated PSA (1.1-20.5 ng/mL) after curative therapy for prostate carcinoma underwent 60 min dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) of the pelvis after IV injection of 193-340 MBq of anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC. Uptake was compared against PET scans in the same patients with the leucine analog, anti-1-amino-3-[(18)F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (anti-[(18)F]FACBC), at similar time points and validated via pathology, clinical, and imaging follow-up.  Results:   At 5 min, average (±SD) SUVmax of malignant lesions is 4.1(±1.3) for anti-2-[(18)F] FACPC and 4.3(±1.1) for anti-[(18)F]FACBC. Yet, blood pool activity at 5 min is significantly higher for anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC with average (±SD) lesion/blood pool SUVmax/SUVmean ratio of 1.4 (±0.5) vs. 3.0 (±0.9) for anti-[(18)F]FACBC. At 20 min, average (±SD) SUVmax of malignant lesions is 2.6 (±1.0) for anti-2-[(18)F]FACPC and 3.4 (±0.8) for anti-[(18)F]FACBC.

Prostate is an abundant source of nerve growth factor (NGF) that is secreted by malignant epithelial cells and utilized as an important autocrine factor for growth and metastasis. We previously showed that intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIg) contains natural antibodies against NGF, which inhibit growth and differentiation of the NGF-dependent cell line PC-12. In the present study, we examined the effects of these natural antibodies on in vitro migration or metastasis of two prostate cancer cell lines namely DU-145 and PC-3. Cancer cell migration was assessed using these cell lines in the upper chambers of Matrigel invasion chambers. The effects of IVIg and affinity-purified anti-NGF antibodies on cell migration through membrane into the lower chamber were assessed in dose/response experiments by a colorimetric method. Affinity-purified natural IgG anti-NGF antibody inhibited DU-145 migration by 38% (p = 0.01) and PC-3 migration by 25% (p = 0.02); whereas, a monoclonal anti-NGF antibody inhibited DU-145 migration by 40% (p = 0.01) and PC-3 migration by 37% (p = 0.02), at the same concentration. When IVIg was depleted of NGF-specific IgG by affinity chromatography, there was no significant inhibition of migration of the DU-145 and PC-3 cells at a concentration of 1 mg/well. Removal of the NGF-specific antibody from the IVIg was also demonstrated by a lack of effect on PC-12 cell differentiation.

However, despite initial remission, the cancer will inevitably recur. The present study was designed to investigate how androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells eventually survive and resume growth under androgen-deprived and antiandrogen supplemented conditions. As model system, we used the androgen-responsive PC346C cell line and its therapy-resistant sublines: PC346DCC, PC346Flu1 and PC346Flu2.  Methodology/principal findings:   Microarray technology was used to analyze differences in gene expression between the androgen-responsive and therapy-resistant PC346 cell lines. Microarray analysis revealed 487 transcripts differentially-expressed between the androgen-responsive and the therapy-resistant cell lines. Most of these genes were common to all three therapy-resistant sublines and only a minority (∼5%) was androgen-regulated. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment in functions involving cellular movement, cell growth and cell death, as well as association with cancer and reproductive system disease. PC346DCC expressed residual levels of androgen receptor (AR) and showed significant down-regulation of androgen-regulated genes (p-value = 10(-7)). Up-regulation of VAV3 and TWIST1 oncogenes and repression of the DKK3 tumor-suppressor was observed in PC346DCC, suggesting a potential AR bypass mechanism. Subsequent validation of these three genes in patient samples confirmed that expression was deregulated during prostate cancer progression.

These observations could be due to confounding, detection bias, or a biological effect of obesity. Genetic studies are less susceptible to confounding than observational epidemiology and can suggest how associations between phenotypes (such as obesity) and diseases arise. To determine whether the associations between obesity and prostate cancer are causal, we conducted a genetic association study of the relationship between a single nucleotide polymorphism known to be associated with obesity (FTO rs9939609) and prostate cancer. Data are from a population-based sample of 1550 screen-detected prostate cancers, 1815 age- and general practice matched controls with unrestricted prostate specific antigen (PSA) values and 1175 low-PSA controls (PSA <0.5 ng/ml). The rs9939609 A allele, which was associated with higher BMI in the sample, was inversely associated with overall (odds ratio (OR) versus all controls = 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85-1.02 p = 0.12 per allele) and low-grade (OR = 0.90; 0.81-0.99 p = 0.03 per allele) prostate cancer risk, but positively associated with high-grade cancer among cases (OR high- versus low-grade cancer = 1.16; 0.99-1.37 p = 0.07 per allele). Although evidence for these effects was weak, they are consistent with observational data based on BMI phenotypes and suggest that the observed association between obesity and prostate cancer is not due to confounding. Further research should confirm these findings, extend them to other BMI-related genetic variants and determine whether they are due to detection bias or obesity-related hormonal changes.

More than 80% of patients with prostate cancer harbor multiple geographically discrete cancer foci at the time of diagnosis. Emerging data suggest that these foci are molecularly distinct consistent with the hypothesis that they arise as independent clones. One of the strongest arguments is the heterogeneity observed in the status of E26 transformation specific (ETS) rearrangements between discrete tumor foci. The clonal evolution of individual prostate cancer foci based on recent studies demonstrates intertumoral heterogeneity with intratumoral homogeneity. The issue of multifocality and interfocal heterogeneity is important and has not been fully elucidated due to lack of the systematic evaluation of ETS rearrangements in multiple tumor sites. The current study investigates the frequency of multiple gene rearrangements within the same focus and between different cancer foci. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were designed to detect the four most common recurrent ETS gene rearrangements. In a cohort of 88 men with localized prostate cancer, we found ERG, ETV1, and ETV5 rearrangements in 51% (44/86), 6% (5/85), and 1% (1/86), respectively. None of the cases demonstrated ETV4 rearrangements. Mutual exclusiveness of ETS rearrangements was observed in the majority of cases; however, in six cases, we discovered multiple ETS or 5' fusion partner rearrangements within the same tumor focus.

Patients and methods:   We collected blood and medical histories from 428 male patients with non-testosterone-related cancer at three cancer centers. Serum was analyzed for total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), bioavailable testosterone (BAT), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) QoL questionnaire measured physical, social, emotional, and functional domains as well as sexual function. Exclusion criteria were prostate, testicular, or male breast cancer; known hypogonadism; and HIV.  Results:   Mean and median TTs were 337.46 and 310 ng/dL, respectively. The mean age of patients was 62.05 years. The crude prevalence of hypogonadism (ie, TT < 300 ng/dL) was 48%, and mean TT in hypogonadal patients was 176 ng/dL. The prevalences that were based on FT (ie, hypogonadal < 52 pg/dL) and BAT (ie, hypogonadal < 95 ng/dL) were 78% and 66%, respectively. The mean FT and BAT values in hypogonadal patients were 25 pg/dL and 45 ng/dL, respectively. Hypogonadal patients had decreased total QoL scores on FACT-P (P = .01) and decreased three-item sexual function subset (P = .003).  Conclusion:   The prevalence of hypogonadism was unexpectedly high. Measurement of FT or BAT detected a higher prevalence than TT alone, which confirmed previous studies.

However the few recognized models of human prostate epithelial cancer originate from metastases. To date, very few models are proposed from primary tumors and immortalizing normal human prostate cells does not recapitulate the natural history of the disease. By culturing human prostate primary tumor cells onto human epithelial extra-cellular matrix, we successfully selected a new prostate cancer cell line, IGR-CaP1, and clonally-derived subclones. IGR-CaP1 cells, that harbor a tetraploid karyotype, high telomerase activity and mutated TP53, rapidly induced subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, IGR-CaP1 cell lines, all exhibiting negativity for the androgen receptor and PSA, express the specific prostate markers alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase and a low level of the prostate-specific membrane antigen PSMA, along with the prostate basal epithelial markers CK5 and CK14. More importantly, these clones express high CD44, CD133, and CXCR4 levels associated with high expression of α2β1-integrin and Oct4 which are reported to be prostate cancer stemness markers. RT-PCR data also revealed high activation of the Sonic Hedgehog signalling pathway in these cells. Additionally, the IGR-CaP1 cells possess a 3D sphere-forming ability and a renewal capacity by maintaining their CSC potential after xenografting in mice. As a result, the hormone-independent IGR-CaP1 cellular clones exhibit the original features of both basal prostate tissue and cancer stemness.

Methods:   From November 2008 to January 2010, 295 men underwent EP-RARP at our institution. We retrospectively reviewed our database and stratified patients into four groups based on pathologic PW: Group 1, less than 30 g; Group 2, 30 g to less than 50 g; Group 3, 50 g to less than 80 g; and Group 4, 80 g or larger. We prospectively compared these groups with respect to patient age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, pathological stage, margin status, operative time, blood loss, transfusion rate and length of stay. Statistical analysis was performed using SYSTAT 13 software. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to compare the continuous variables among the groups. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical variables.  Results:   Of the 295 patients, 10, 182, 91, and 12 had a PW of less than 30 g; 30 g to less than 50 g; 50 g to less than 80 g; and 80 g or larger, respectively. A significant difference was found in age, prostate weight and prostate-specific antigen values among the four groups (p < 0.05). Patients in Group 4 had larger prostates, were older (mean age 65 years), had higher pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (median 5.85 ng/mL) and lower Gleason score (mean 6.2). Based on the D'Amico risk stratification, our study showed a trend toward higher risk disease, presence of extra capsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and positive margin status in Groups 1, 2 and 3 rather than in Group 4. No significant differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, transfusion rate, hospital stay, and postoperative complication rate were observed among the four groups.  Conclusions:   Da Vinci robot assisted laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy (EP-RARP) is feasible in patients with larger prostates, offering acceptable operative times, blood loss, hospital stay and complication rates. In our cohort of patients, we found pathologically smaller prostates are generally associated with higher Gleason score, higher risk group stratification and positive surgical margin status.

Results of a single institution randomized study""","""Introduction:   Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is a common treatment for localized prostate cancer. Despite a primary advantage of improved postoperative pain, patients undergoing RALP still experience discomfort. Belladonna, containing the muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine and scopolamine, in combination with opium as a rectal suppository (B & O) may improve post-RALP pain. This study evaluates whether a single preoperative B & O results in decreased postoperative patient-reported pain and analgesic requirements.  Materials and methods:   Patients undergoing RALP at Virginia Mason Medical Center between November 2008 and July 2009 were offered the opportunity to enter a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Exclusion criteria included: glaucoma, bronchial asthma, convulsive disorders, chronic pain, chronic use of analgesics, or a history of alcohol or opioid dependency. Surgeons were blinded to suppository placement which was administered after induction of anesthesia. All patients underwent a standardized anesthesia regimen. Postoperative pain was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) and postoperative narcotic use was calculated in intravenous morphine equivalents.  Results:   Ninety-nine patients were included in the analysis. The B & O and control groups were not significantly different in terms of age, body mass index, operative time, nerve sparing status or prostatic volume. Postoperative pain was significantly improved during the first two postoperative hours in the B & O group. Similarly, 24-hour morphine consumption was significantly lower in patients who received a B & O. No adverse effects secondary to suppository placement were identified.  Conclusion:   Preoperative administration of B & O suppository results in significantly decreased postoperative pain and 24-hour morphine consumption in patients undergoing RALP.""","""['Stephen Lukasewycz', 'Matt Holman', 'Paul Kozlowski', 'Christopher R Porter', 'Erin Odom', 'Chris Bernards', 'Nancy Neil', 'John M Corman']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Prophylactic belladonna suppositories on anesthetic recovery after robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy versus retropubic radical prostatectomy: a prospective assessment of postoperative pain.', 'Randomized controlled trial of postoperative belladonna and opium rectal suppositories in vaginal surgery.', 'Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: do minimally invasive approaches offer significant advantages?', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: conventional and robotic.', 'Pain in Multiple Sclerosis: Understanding Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management Through Clinical Vignettes.', 'Anaesthetic management for robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: the first UK national survey of current practice.', 'Preoperative Belladonna and Opium Suppository for Ureteral Stent Pain: A Randomized, Double-blinded, Placebo-controlled Study.', 'Successful implementation of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program shortens length of stay and improves postoperative pain, and bowel and bladder function after colorectal surgery.', 'Optimal pain management for radical prostatectomy surgery: what is the evidence?']"""

Nevertheless, optimal targeting of the prostate bed following surgery remains challenging. The Calypso 4D Localization System (Calypso Medical Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) is a target positioning device that continuously monitors the location of three implantable electromagnetic transponders. We describe our technique of ultrasound-guided placement of these transponders into the prostate bed for adjuvant and salvage RT.  Methods:   Seventeen patients presenting to Fox Chase Cancer Center for postoperative RT underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided placement of Calypso beacons. The three transponders were placed approximately 1 cm apart in a triangular fashion around the vesico-urethral anastomosis and in the retrovesicular tissue.  Results:   All patients were successfully implanted without periprocedural complications. Appropriate beacon position was confirmed by CT scan performed at the time of RT simulation. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was delivered at a dose of 68 Gy (range 64-68). Treatment was well-tolerated with no Grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Grade > 2 enteritis was not observed, and there were no cases of rectal bleeding. Genitourinary toxicity was noted in 10 patients and consisted of Grade 1 and 2 frequency and dysuria. No patient developed gross hematuria or urinary retention. All patients (9/9) with at least 6 months of follow up after treatment had an undetectable PSA.

We compare initial PSA outcomes in men undergoing Cs-131 prostate brachytherapy to men treated with I-125.  Patients and methods:   The first post-treatment PSA (obtained 3-6 months after the procedure) was compared in patients undergoing I-125 prostate brachytherapy to that of patients undergoing Cs-131 prostate brachytherapy at the same institution. Comparisons included the total cohort as well as low and intermediate risk patients.  Results:   Mean pre-treatment PSA was 6.9 ng/mL in the I-125 cohort, and 6.9 ng/mL in the Cs-131 cohort. Mean initial post-treatment PSA was 0.9 ng/mL (range < 0.1-4.6) in the I-125 cohort and 1.2 ng/mL (range < 0.1-23.5) in the Cs-131 patients.

Results:   In this study, we demonstrate that α-TEA induces the accumulation of cell surface membrane ceramide, leading to co-localization with Fas, DR5, and FADD, followed by activation of caspases-8 and -9 and apoptosis in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. α-TEA treatment leads to increased acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) activity by 30 min, peaking at 4 hrs, which is correlated with ASMase translocation from cytosol to the cell surface membrane. Functional knockdown of ASMase with either the chemical inhibitor, desipramine, or siRNA markedly reduces α-TEA-induced cell surface membrane accumulation of ceramide and its co-localization with Fas, DR5, and FADD, cleavage of caspases-8 and -9 and apoptosis, suggesting an early and critical role for ASMase in α-TEA-induced apoptosis. Consistent with cell culture data, immunohistochemical analyses of tumor tissues taken from α-TEA treated nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts show increased levels of cell surface membrane ceramide in comparison to tumor tissues from control animals.

We report the effect of three techniques of bladder neck reconstruction during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy on anastomotic leak, stricture formation, and continence recovery.  Patients and methods:   Between January 2005 to September 2009, 1900 consecutive patients underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) by a single surgeon. Of these, the first 214 underwent vesicourethral conventional anastomosis (CA); the next 303 men underwent anterior reconstruction (AR) only; and last 1383 men underwent total anatomic restoration (TR). Data elements included patient age, body mass index, preoperative biopsy Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen level, prostate volume, total operative time, console time, time for performing vesicourethral anastomosis, estimated blood loss, tumor stage, and margin status on final pathologic findings. Primary end points were rates of clinically significant anastomotic leaks, bladder neck contractures, and time to return of continence. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis of categoric variables. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for both univariate and multivariate analysis.  Results:   Clinically significant anastomotic leakage and bladder neck strictures were significantly fewer in the reconstructed groups (2.3% vs 1.0% vs 0.3% and 3.7% vs 1.3% vs 0.5% in the CA, AR, and TR groups, P < 0.01). Continence rates at 1, 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after RALP were also significantly better at all time points with AR and TR compared with CA alone (P < 0.001).

Sixty-one percent of respondents stated that patients should be told the complete truth about their disease. Ninety-six percent of respondents felt competent at breaking bad news and stated they would discuss emotions with patients.

EGCG has been found to disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential, induce vesiculation of mitochondria, and induce elevated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and apoptosis. EGCG in combination with low levels of Dox had a synergistic effect in blocking tumor cell growth. In vivo tumor modeling studies with a highly metastatic tumor line, PC-3ML cells, revealed that EGCG (228 mg/kg or 200 μmol/L) appeared to sensitize tumors to Dox. EGCG combined with low levels of Dox (0.14 mg/kg or 2 μmol/L) blocked tumor growth by PC-3ML cells injected intraperitoneally (ie, in CB17 severe combined immunodeficiencies) and significantly increased mouse survival rates. Similarly, relatively low levels of EGCG (57 mg/kg or 50 μmol/L) plus Dox (0.07 mg/kg or 1 μmol/L) eradicated established tumors (ie, in nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiencies) that were derived from CD44(hi) tumor-initiating cells isolated from PCa-20a cells. Flow cytometry results showed that EGCG appeared to enhance retention of Dox by tumor cells to synergistically inhibit tumor growth and eradicate tumors.

In this communication, we investigated the roles of both ErbB-2 signaling in matriptase zymogen activation and matriptase in ErbB-2-induced PCa malignancy. In a human PCa cell progression model, we observed that advanced PCa C-81 LNCaP cells exhibited an aggressive phenotype with increased cell migration and invasion capacity; these cells concurrently showed both enhanced ErbB-2 phosphorylation and increased matriptase zymogen activation compared with parental C-33 LNCaP cells. Moreover, ErbB2 activation, both ligand-dependent (eg, epidermal growth factor treatment) and ligand-independent (eg, overexpression), was able to induce matriptase zymogen activation in this cell line. Inhibition of ErbB-2 activity by either the specific inhibitor, AG825, in epidermal growth factor-treated C-33 LNCaP cells or ErbB-2 knockdown in C-81 LNCaP cells, reduced matriptase activation. These observations were confirmed by similar studies using both DU145 and PC3 cells. Together, these data suggest that ErbB-2 signaling plays an important role in matriptase zymogen activation. ErbB-2-enhanced matriptase activation was suppressed by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (ie, LY294002) but not by a MEK inhibitor (ie, PD98059). Suppression of matriptase expression by small hairpin RNA knockdown in ErbB-2-overexpressing LNCaP cells dramatically suppressed cancer cell invasion.

Methods:   Using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, we modeled the clinical data and disease follow-up data for 2272 men with clinically localized prostate cancer who had undergone laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The clinical data included the pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen level, biopsy Gleason grade, clinical stage, number of positive cores, and number of negative cores.

In our earlier studies, a tissue test for PCA3 appeared to have greater specificity for PCa. There, we performed a clinical evaluation of PCA3 mRNA assay in urine sediments after DRE enriched with prostate cells in a Chinese population. PCA3 mRNA was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (FQ-RT-PCR) in the urine sediments. PSA mRNA detected also by real-time FQ-RT-PCR was used to confirm the yield of prostate cells in the urine sediments beforehand and normalize PCA3 mRNA signals. The data were summarized in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to visualize the efficacy of ratio PCA3/PSA mRNA as a marker; sensitivity and specificity were calculated also. We also correlated the ratio PCA3/PSA mRNA to the biopsy results (including the presence or absence of malignancy and the Gleason score of the malignancy cases) and to the bone metastasis to evaluate its clinical value. The PCA3 mRNA expression (PCA3/PSA mRNA) in the PCa group was significantly higher than that in the BPH group. The AUC-ROC was 0.786 (95% CI: 0.683-0.889). When the cutoff value was set as 0.107, the sensitivity and specificity were 62.9% and 90.6%, respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the PCA3 urine test was 78.6% and 81.7%, respectively. No significant correlation was found between urine PCA3 expression and Gleason score or bone metastasis. Results indicated the clinical usefulness of the PCA3/PSA mRNA of urine sediments after DRE as a molecular marker in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer, which appears to be highly specific for PCa. As a non-invasive and sample accessible assay, the PCA3/PSA mRNA may therefore be useful as an aid in the diagnosis of PCa.""","""['Mo Shen', 'Wei Chen', 'Kaiyuan Yu', 'Zhanguo Chen', 'Wu Zhou', 'Xiaomei Lin', 'Zhiliang Weng', 'Chengdi Li', 'Xiuling Wu', 'Zhihua Tao']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['PCA3 sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection in patients with abnormal PSA and/or suspicious digital rectal examination.

No data were available in human prostate cancer. The present study was designed to assess SphK1 expression and activity in radical prostatectomy specimens and to research correlations with clinical features.  Materials and methods:   Transverse section of fresh tissue was obtained from 30 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic prostatectomy. SphK1 enzymatic activities of tumour and normal counterpart were determined. Relationships with PSA, Gleason sum, pathological stage, resection margin status and treatment failure were researched. SphK1 pattern of expression was then assessed on tissue microarray.  Results:   A significant 2-fold increase in SphK1 enzymatic activity(11.1 ± 8.4 versus 5.9 ± 3.2 (P<0.04)) was observed in cancer. The upper quartile of SphK1 activity was associated with higher PSA (16.7 versus 6.4 ng/ml, P = 0.04), higher tumor volumes (20.7 versus 9.8, P = 0.002), higher rates of positive margins (85.7% versus 28.6%, P = 0.01) and surgical failure (71.4% versus 9.5%, P = 0.003) than the lower three quartiles. Odds ratios (OR) for treatment failure showed a strong relationship with SphK1 activity (OR: 23.7, P = 0.001), positive resection margins (OR: 15.0, P = 0.007) and Gleason sum (≥4+3, OR: 8.0, P = 0.003). Tissue microarrays showed discrete epithelial expression that varied with Gleason sum with significant relationship between SphK1 expression and higher Gleason sum.

Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy of prostate cancer (PCa) detection by trained dogs on human urine samples.  Design, setting, and participants:   A Belgian Malinois shepherd was trained by the clicker training method (operant conditioning) to scent and recognize urine of people having PCa. All urine samples were frozen for preservation and heated to the same temperature for all tests. After a learning phase and a training period of 24 mo, the dog's ability to discriminate PCa and control urine was tested in a double-blind procedure. Urine was obtained from 66 patients referred to a urologist for elevated prostate-specific antigen or abnormal digital rectal examination. All patients underwent prostate biopsy and two groups were considered: 33 patients with cancer and 33 controls presenting negative biopsies.  Measurements:   During each ""run,"" the dog was asked to signal a cancer urine among six samples containing only one cancer urine and five randomly selected controls. Sensitivity and specificity of the test were assessed.  Results and limitations:   The dog completed all the runs and correctly designated the cancer samples in 30 of 33 cases. Of the three cases wrongly classified as cancer, one patient was rebiopsied and a PCa was diagnosed. The sensitivity and specificity were both 91%.  Conclusions:   This study shows that dogs can be trained to detect PCa by smelling urine with a significant success rate. It suggests that PCa gives an odor signature to urine.

The latest technological improvement is modulated rotational radiotherapy, where one single rotation of the treatment machine is used to conform the dose delivery to the target and spare organs at risk, requiring less than 2 min of beam-on time per treatment fraction.  Materials and methods:   We report herein our experience from the first 46 patients treated for prostate cancer, clinical stage T1-3 with rotational therapy (""RapidArc®"", Varian Medical systems) (RA). This patient group is compared to a group of 50 patients treated with a 5-field Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) technique over the same period. The comparison parameters include target coverage, dose to OAR, treatment time and number of monitor units. Daily-IGRT using implanted gold markers is used before and after treatment to investigate intra-fractional prostate displacement.  Results:   RA results in improved sparing of the rectum and achieves desired dose distributions with fewer monitor units and a shorter treatment time (<1.5 min versus up to 8.9 min with IMRT). This shorter treatment time also translates in a decreased risk of patient motion during treatment: daily-IGRT demonstrates reduced prostate motion (<3mm 3D vector) from 16.7% to 4.7% in RA patients. Only slight side-effects were seen in the two groups of patients.  Conclusions:   RA results in improved sparing of the rectum, however, at the expense of an increase in dose to the femoral heads in prostate patients. The treatment time is significantly reduced from 4.9 min on average with 5-field IMRT to 1.1 min with RA, which allows for a reduction of infractional prostate motion.""","""['Marianne C Aznar', 'Peter Meidahl Petersen', 'Ashildur Logadottir', 'Henriette Lindberg', 'Stine S Korreman', 'Flemming Kjær-Kristoffersen', 'Svend Aage Engelholm']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['High dose for prostate irradiation with image guided radiotherapy: contribution of intensity modulation arctherapy.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy: planning and evaluation for prostate cancer cases.', 'Intensity modulated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: rigid compliance to dose-volume constraints as a warranty of acceptable toxicity?', 'Benefit of intensity modulated and image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Australian & New Zealand Faculty of Radiation Oncology Genito-Urinary Group: 2010 consensus guidelines for definitive external beam radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma.', 'Cost and Toxicity Comparisons of Two IMRT Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Micro-Costing Study and Weighted Propensity Score Analysis Based on a Prospective Study.', 'Adaptive sequential plan-on-plan optimization during prostate-specific antigen response guided radiotherapy of recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Intercenter validation of a knowledge based model for automated planning of volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.

We assessed reproducibility in reporting prostate needle biopsy parameters among urologic pathologists using routine and digital microscopy in a consultation/second opinion-like setting. Four urologic pathologists evaluated a single core level from 50 diagnostically challenging needle biopsy specimens by routine microscopy and whole slide digital imaging. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement were calculated for primary and secondary Gleason grades, Gleason score, tumor quantitation (percentage and size in millimeters), and perineural invasion. Interobserver agreement for routine microscopy was excellent for primary Gleason grade (κ = 0.72) and good for all other parameters (κ ranging from 0.36 to 0.55). Whole slide digital imaging assessment yielded similar agreement for all parameters. Intraobserver agreement for primary Gleason grade and Gleason score was very good to excellent for all pathologists (all κ ≥ 0.65 and ≥ 0.73, respectively). Size of tumor in millimeters consistently displayed higher levels of agreement than percentage of tumor across media and pathologists. Digital assessment of routinely reported cancer parameters on prostatic needle biopsy for a given scanned core level is comparable to that of routine microscopy. These findings imply that histologic interpretation using dynamic whole slide images may accurately simulate routine microscopic evaluation in the consultation setting. Implementation of whole slide digital imaging in these scenarios may significantly reduce the workload of large referral centers in the near future and impact the manner in which pathologists seek second opinion consultation on challenging cases.""","""['Paula A Rodriguez-Urrego', 'Angel M Cronin', 'Hikmat A Al-Ahmadie', 'Anuradha Gopalan', 'Satish K Tickoo', 'Victor E Reuter', 'Samson W Fine']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Prostate needle biopsy examination by means of virtual microscopy.', 'Interobserver reproducibility of Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma: urologic pathologists.', 'Extended prostate biopsy scheme improves reliability of Gleason grading: implications for radiotherapy patients.', 'Utility of whole slide imaging and virtual microscopy in prostate pathology.', 'Gleason grading of prostate cancer in needle biopsies or radical prostatectomy specimens: contemporary approach, current clinical significance and sources of pathology discrepancies.', 'Region Segmentation of Whole-Slide Images for Analyzing Histological Differentiation of Prostate Adenocarcinoma Using Ensemble EfficientNetB2 U-Net with Transfer Learning Mechanism.', 'Validation of digital microscopy: Review of validation methods and sources of bias.', 'Dissecting the Business Case for Adoption and Implementation of Digital Pathology: A White Paper from the Digital Pathology Association.', 'Verification and Validation of Digital Pathology (Whole Slide Imaging) for Primary Histopathological Diagnosis: All Wales Experience.', 'Interchangeability of light and virtual microscopy for histopathological evaluation of prostate cancer.']"""

Our preliminary results show that DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells are radioresistant. In this study, we investigated the anticancer drug Epothilone B (EpoB) for the modulation of radiosensitivity in DAB2IP-deficient human PCa cells.  Methods and materials:   We used a stable DAB2IP-knock down human PCa cell line, PC3 shDAB2IP, treated with EpoB, ionizing radiation (IR), or the combined treatment of EpoB and IR. The modulation of radiosensitivity was determined by surviving fraction, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. For in vivo studies, the PC3shDAB2IP xenograft model was used in athymic nude mice.  Results:   Treatment with EpoB at IC(50) dose (33.3 nM) increased cellular radiosensitivity in the DAB2IP-deficient cell line with a dose enhancement ratio of 2.36. EpoB delayed the DSB repair kinetics after IR and augmented the induction of apoptosis in irradiated cells after G(2)/M arrest. Combined treatment of EpoB and radiation enhanced tumor growth delay with an enhancement factor of 1.2.  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated a significant radiation dose enhancement using EpoB in DAB2IP-deficient prostate cancer cells.

In Omsk more men were tested for PSA: 77% against 67 in Moscow. Men with higher education made PSA test more often (88 and 60%, respectively). Only 31% responders know why PSA test is made. Of men over 70 years of age in Moscow, 43% responders made PSA test for the first time at the age from 60 to 69 years, the rest patients made it at the age 70 years and older. In Omsk, 88% responders made PSA test at the age of 70 and older. In men aged 40-49 years a mean IPSS point was 4, QOL--3. The highest IPSS (20 points) and QOL (4 points) were registered in men over 70. Among the responders over 70 years old, 38% were sexually active. The results of our questionnaire survey demonstrate that age of the patients who undergo PSA test in Moscow and Omsk is over 70.

Materials and methods:   Twenty-four patients underwent 1.5 Tesla (T) endorectal MR imaging before radical prostatectomy with whole-mount step-section pathologic analysis of surgical specimens. For each patient, the T2w imaging containing the largest area of tumor was manually matched with the corresponding pathologic slice. The prostate was co-registered using a free-form deformation (FFD) algorithm based on B-splines. Registration quality was assessed through differences between prostate diameters measured in right-left (RL) and anteroposterior (AP) directions on T2w images and pathologic slices and calculation of the Dice similarity coefficient, D, for the whole prostate (WP), the peripheral zone (PZ) and the transition zone (TZ).  Results:   The mean differences in diameters measured on pathology and MR imaging in the RL direction and the AP direction were 0.49 cm and -0.63 cm, respectively, before registration and 0.10 cm and -0.11 cm, respectively, after registration. The mean D values for the WP, PZ and TZ, were 0.76, 0.65, and 0.77, respectively, before registration and increased to 0.91, 0.76, and 0.85, respectively, after registration. The improvements in D were significant for all three tissues (P < 0.001 for all).

Characteristic genomic abnormalities such as 8p loss, 8q gain, trisomy 7, and PTEN microdeletions may provide selective advantages to increase neoplastic transformation. Evidence suggests that telomere dysfunction is a plausible mechanism for some of these abnormalities on the basis of the break-fusion-bridge cycle that can lead to manifestations of genomic instability.  Methods:   In this study, we correlate telomere length measured by quantitative FISH in various prostatic histologies with markers of genomic instability and immunohistochemical measures of proliferation and oxidative stress.  Results:   We find that telomere shortening is correlated with abnormalities on chromosome 8, but not with trisomy 7 or abnormalities of the PTEN locus. There are associations with C-MYC aberrations in stroma with greater proximity to cancer and a correlation between telomere length in a number of prostatic histologies and the adjacent stroma, suggesting the importance of microenvironmental effects on telomere maintenance in the prostate. This finding was also supported by the finding of the correlation between telomere attrition and the levels of oxidative stress as measured by malondialdehyde staining in HPIN lesions close to cancer.  Conclusions:   Telomere attrition in the prostate gland is associated with particular genomic aberrations that contribute to the genomic instability characteristic of prostatic carcinogenesis. Correlations between various histologies and adjacent stroma telomere length suggest it is also may reveal microenvironmental effects within the prostate gland. Oxidative stress may contribute to telomere attrition in HPIN close to cancer.""","""['A M Joshua', 'E Shen', 'M Yoshimoto', 'P Marrano', 'M Zielenska', 'A J Evans', 'T Van der Kwast', 'J A Squire']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Evidence of multifocality of telomere erosion in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HPIN) and concurrent carcinoma.', 'Widespread telomere instability in prostatic lesions.', 'Decreased NKX3.1 protein expression in focal prostatic atrophy, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and adenocarcinoma: association with gleason score and chromosome 8p deletion.', 'DNA ploidy in prostate cancer: potential measurement as a surrogate endpoint biomarker.', 'Molecular biology of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'The Relationship between Telomere Length and Nucleoplasmic Bridges and Severity of Disease in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Integrative epigenome profiling of 47XXY provides insights into whole genomic DNA hypermethylation and active chromatin accessibility.', 'Race Differences in Telomere Length in Benign Prostate Biopsies and Subsequent Risk of Prostate Cancer.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'Obesity is Associated with Shorter Telomere Length in Prostate Stromal Cells in Men with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Although activated AR is required for androgen-induction of expression of both genes, effects of the IGF-I signaling pathways on the androgen-induction of PSA have not been studied.  Methods:   Human prostate stromal and epithelial cancer cells were treated alone or in coculture with steroid hormone and/or inhibitors. Gene or protein expression was analyzed by real time RT-PCR or Western blotting of lysates, nuclear extracts, or immunoprecipitated products.  Results:   In PrCa epithelial cells, endogenous IGF-I, significantly induced by R1881, was required for R1881-induction of PSA. Increased IGF-I correlated with accumulation of cytoplasmic dephospho β-catenin (CPDP β-catenin), a co-activator of AR signaling. Exogenous IGF-I enhanced R1881-induced PSA and accumulation of CPDP β-catenin in LAPC-4 cells. Functional depletion of IGF-I or IGF-I receptor diminished PSA induction. Induction of IGF-I reached a plateau while PSA consecutively increased. Inhibiting PI3K abolished R1881-induced Akt phosphorylation, CPDP and nuclear β-catenin and nuclear association of AR/β-catenin, consequently abrogating R1881-induced expression of IGF-I and/or PSA.  Conclusions:   By integrating androgen, IGF-I and β-catenin signaling pathways, these data reveal that androgen-induced PSA expression requires activation of AR and endogenous IGF-I or IGF-I/PI3K/Akt signaling, suggesting a positive feedback cycle for increased production of PSA associated with PrCa.""","""['Xunxian Liu', 'Renee Y Choi', 'Shayma M Jawad', 'Julia T Arnold']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Interleukin-4 enhances prostate-specific antigen expression by activation of the androgen receptor and Akt pathway.', 'PSA regulates androgen receptor expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Beta-catenin is involved in insulin-like growth factor 1-mediated transactivation of the androgen receptor.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Chronic over-nutrition and dysregulation of GSK3 in diseases.', 'Natural Functions of PLIN2 Mediating Wnt/LiCl Signaling and Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3)/GSK3 Substrate-Related Effects Are Modulated by Lipid.', 'Inhibition of IGF-1R diminishes transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor and its constitutively active, C-terminally truncated counterparts Q640X and AR-V7.', 'Inhibition of Plk1 represses androgen signaling pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Transcript expression of PRDX1-6 in PCa was evaluated in cancer gene microarray datasets, whereas protein expression was evaluated by immunoblotting in prostate cell lines, and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in prostate tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing tumor (n = 80) and control (n = 17) tissues. PRDX3 was also analyzed in TMAs containing PCa tissues from African-American and Caucasian patients (n = 150 per group). PRDX expression was correlated with patients' clinicopathologic characteristics.  Results:   Analysis of PRDX expression in cancer microarray datasets revealed consistent upregulation (tumor vs. normal) of PRDX3 and 4. All PRDXs exhibited elevated protein expression in PCa cell lines, compared with non-tumor cells. IHC revealed significant overexpression of PRDX3 and 4 in PCa, associated with age, increased prostate specific antigen (PSA), tumor stage, or Gleason score. High PRDX3 staining was associated with early age and elevated Gleason score at time of radical prostatectomy in African-American but not in Caucasian patients with PCa. PSA recurrence free survival in patients with low PRDX3 tumor expression was significantly longer in Caucasians compared to African-Americans, but no difference was detected for high expression.  Conclusions:   PRDXs exhibit differential expression in prostate tumors, with PRDX3 and 4 consistently upregulated.

Human prostasomes are proposed to function in regulation of sperm function, immunosuppression, and prostate cancer progression. Previously, we identified galectin-3 on the surface of prostasomes. Galectin-3 is a β-galactoside binding protein involved in immunomodulation, cell interactions, and cancer progression, including prostate cancer. Functional characterization of galectin-3 in a given biological environment includes identification of its target glycoprotein ligands.  Methods:   Candidate galectin-3 ligands in prostasomes were identified by tandem mass spectrometry of proteins that co-purified with galectin-3 during lactose affinity chromatography. Immunochemical and biochemical methods were used to investigate the association of Mac-2 binding protein (M2BP) with prostasomes.  Results:   Proteins identified by tandem mass spectrometry included M2BP, CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV, prolactin-inducible protein (PIP), olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4), and semenogelins I and II (SgI and SgII). M2BP is a known galectin-3 ligand that was not previously described in prostasomes. M2BP protein bands were detected in the testis, epididymis, vas deferens, prostate, seminal vesicle, and sperm extracts. In seminal plasma, M2BP was identified in the soluble fraction and in purified prostasomes. Surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence studies indicated that M2BP is present on the prostasome surface and on sperm, respectively.  Conclusions:   M2BP, CD26, PIP, OLFM4, and SgI and SgII are candidate glycoprotein ligands for galectin-3 in prostasomes.

Ethinyl estradiol is one of a class of chemicals known as""environmental estrogens"" that can affect the hormone activities and possibly reproductive function of wildlife and humans through exposure. The NTP conducted a series of studies on three such chemicals to detect if exposure over the course of multiple generations could have any cumulative effect on animals' reproductive systems or development of cancers. This report describes the results of a set of studies in which rats were exposed to ethinylestradiol for part or all of the study period and examined at the end of two years.  Methods:   The study consisted of three separate study components; in each, animals were exposed to ethinyl estradiol from the time of conception and through weaning through their mothers, who were given ethinyl estradiol in their feed.In one study we gave feed containing 2, 10, or 50 parts per billion (ppb) of ethinyl estradiol to groups of 50 male and female rats from conception through two years. In the second study, groups of 50 male and female rats were given the same feed concentrations up to 20 weeks following birth, followed by untreated feed for the remainder of the two years. In the third study groups of 50 male and female rats were exposed from conception through weaning, and then given untreated feed for the duration of the study. Control animals received the same feed with no ethinyl estradiol added. Enthinyl estradiol is known to cause cancer at higher dose levels; the concentrations given in this study were below the levels of detection by chemical analysis, to determine the possible effects of trace amounts in the environment. At the end of the study tissues from more than 40 sites were examined for every animal.  Results:   In all three study sets effects were seen in the uterus of female rats. The rates of squamous metaplasia increased in females exposed for two years and in females exposed from conception through weaning; endometrial hyperplasia and atypical focal hyperplasia of the uterus also were increased in females exposed for two years. Uterine stromal polyps were increased in female rats exposed from conception through 20 weeks after birth or from conception through weaning. Male rats exposed from conception through weaning had small increases in the rates of preputial gland tumors and three male rats in that study had rare mammary gland adenomas or carcinomas.

The specific aims of this work were to demonstrate the accuracy and repeatability of producing large volumes of thermal coagulation (>10 cc) that conform to 3D human prostate shapes in a tissue-mimicking gel phantom, and to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy with which numerical simulations predict these 3D heating volumes under carefully controlled conditions. Eleven conformal 3D experiments were performed in a tissue-mimicking phantom within a 1.5T MR imager to obtain non-invasive temperature measurements during heating. Temperature feedback was used to control the rotation rate and ultrasound power of transurethral devices with up to five 3.5 × 5 mm active transducer elements. Heating patterns shaped to human prostate geometries were generated using devices operating at 4.7 or 8.0 MHz with surface acoustic intensities of up to 10 W cm(-2). Simulations were informed by transducer surface velocity measurements acquired with a scanning laser vibrometer enabling improved calculations of the acoustic pressure distribution in a gel phantom. Temperature dynamics were determined according to a FDTD solution to Pennes' BHTE. The 3D heating patterns produced in vitro were shaped very accurately to the prostate target volumes, within the spatial resolution of the MRI thermometry images. The volume of the treatment difference falling outside ± 1 mm of the target boundary was, on average, 0.21 cc or 1.5% of the prostate volume. The numerical simulations predicted the extent and shape of the coagulation boundary produced in gel to within (mean ± stdev [min, max]): 0.5 ± 0.4 [-1.0, 2.1] and -0.05 ± 0.4 [-1.2, 1.4] mm for the treatments at 4.7 and 8.0 MHz, respectively. The temperatures across all MRI thermometry images were predicted within -0.3 ± 1.6 °C and 0.1 ± 0.6 °C, inside and outside the prostate respectively, and the treatment time to within 6.8 min. The simulations also showed excellent agreement in regions of sharp temperature gradients near the transurethral and endorectal cooling devices. Conformal 3D volumes of thermal coagulation can be precisely matched to prostate shapes with transurethral ultrasound devices and active MRI temperature feedback. The accuracy of numerical simulations for MRI-controlled transurethral ultrasound prostate therapy was validated experimentally, reinforcing their utility as an effective treatment planning tool.""","""['Mathieu Burtnyk', ""William Apoutou N'Djin"", 'Ilya Kobelevskiy', 'Michael Bronskill', 'Rajiv Chopra']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Method for MRI-guided conformal thermal therapy of prostate with planar transurethral ultrasound heating applicators.', 'Conformal thermal therapy using planar ultrasound transducers and adaptive closed-loop MR temperature control: demonstration in gel phantoms and ex vivo tissues.', 'Quantitative analysis of 3-D conformal MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy of the prostate: theoretical simulations.', 'Magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity ultrasound ablation of the prostate.', 'Catheter-based ultrasound applicators for selective thermal ablation: progress towards MRI-guided applications in prostate.', 'Deep learning prediction of non-perfused volume without contrast agents during prostate ablation therapy.', 'Twelve-month prostate volume reduction after MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the prostate.', 'Ultrasound-based triggered drug delivery to tumors.', 'Analytical estimation of ultrasound properties, thermal diffusivity, and perfusion using magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound temperature data.', 'Investigation of factors affecting hypothermic pelvic tissue cooling using bio-heat simulation based on MRI-segmented anatomic models.']"""

This study assessed the relationship between occupational and recreational PA and cancer risk among men in a population-based case-control study conducted in Montreal, Canada.  Methods:   Incident cases of cancer of the lung (n=857), colon (n=496), bladder (n=484), prostate (n=449), stomach (n=251), rectum (n=248), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=215), kidney (n=177), pancreas (n=116), melanoma (n=103), esophagus (n=99), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=54), and 533 population controls, were interviewed. Detailed lifetime occupational PAs were translated into metabolic equivalents. Participation in sports and outdoor activities was elicited.  Results:   Compared to those with low lifetime occupational PA levels, men with high occupational PA levels had decreased odds ratios (OR) for all cancer types. The strongest evidence was for cancers of the colon [OR: 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-0.99] and the prostate (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31-0.95).

Methods:   Malignant (PC3, DU145) and benign (RWPE1, BPH1) prostate epithelial cells were used. Phosphatase activity was measured using a commercial kit. Recruitment of the regulatory subunit, Bα, of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A-Bα) by TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) was monitored by coimmunoprecipitation. Blockade of TGF-β1 signaling in cells was accomplished either by using TGF-β-neutralizing monoclonal antibody or by transduction of a dominant negative TGF-β type II receptor retroviral vector.  Results:   Basal levels of TGF-β1 in malignant cells were significantly higher than those in benign cells. Blockade of TGF-β signaling resulted in a significant decrease in TGF-β1 expression in malignant cells, but not in benign cells. Upon TGF-β1 treatment (10 ng/mL), TGF-β1 expression was increased in malignant cells, but not in benign cells. This differential TGF-β1 auto-induction between benign and malignant cells correlated with differential activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Following TGF-β1 treatment, the activity of serine/threonine phosphatase and recruitment of PP2A-Bα by TβRI increased in benign cells, but not in malignant cells. Inhibition of PP2A in benign cells resulted in an increase in ERK activation and in TGF-β1 auto-induction after TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) treatment.

Materials and methods:   We used LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells (ATCC®) to evaluate the in vitro apoptotic effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors and their combinations with docetaxel as well as the molecular mechanisms. The DU145 xenograft model was used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of PXD101 combined with docetaxel.  Results:   Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or PXD101 inhibited the growth of hormone dependent LNCaP cells, and hormone independent DU145 and PC3 cells. It increased sub-G1 population and activated caspase-8, 9 and 3, indicating apoptosis induction. Pretreating DU145 cells with docetaxel followed by histone deacetylase inhibitors showed significant synergistic cytotoxicity compared with that of simultaneous co-treatment or reverse sequential treatment. Pretreatment with docetaxel followed by histone deacetylase inhibitors increased the apoptotic sub-G1 population, caspase activation and tubulin acetylation compared with that of docetaxel alone. Combination treatment decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl, and increased t-Bid, Bik and Bim. Combined docetaxel and PXD101 reduced tumor size with efficacy equivalent to that of a double dose of docetaxel alone in the DU145 xenograft model.  Conclusions:   These preclinical results indicate that the sequential combination of docetaxel and histone deacetylase inhibitors led to a synergistic increase in the death of hormone refractory prostate cancer cells via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways by modulating Bcl-2 family proteins and tubulin in vitro and in vivo.

To this end, novel cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) were designed for mediating intracellular uptake of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. The novel peptides were based on taking advantage of the nuclear localization properties of transcription factors in combination with a peptide that would bind putatively to cell surfaces. It was observed that adding a glutamate peptide to the N-terminus of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the Oct6 transcription factor resulted in a novel CPP with better uptake and better nuclear colocalization than any other peptide tested.  Results:   Uptake of the novel peptide Glu-Oct6 by cancer cell lines was rapid (in less than 1 hr, more than 60% of DU-145 cells were positive for FITC), complete (by 4 hr, 99% of cells were positive for FITC), concentration-dependent, temperature-dependent, and inhibited by sodium azide (NaN3). Substitution of Phe, Tyr, or Asn moieties for the glutamate portion of the novel peptide resulted in abrogation of novel CPP uptake; however none of the substituted peptides inhibited uptake of the novel CPP when coincubated with cells.

Small molecule therapeutics now being tested in humans can activate endoglin signaling. It is not known whether endoglin can regulate metastatic behavior, PCa tumor growth, nor what signaling pathways are linked to these processes. This study sought to investigate the effect of endoglin on these parameters. We used a murine orthotopic model of human PCa metastasis, designed by us to measure effects at early steps in the metastatic cascade, and implanted PCa cells stably engineered to express differing levels of endoglin. We now extend this model to measure cancer cells circulating in the blood. Progressive endoglin loss led to progressive increases in the number of circulating PCa cells as well as to the formation of soft tissue metastases. Endoglin was known to suppress invasion by activating the Smad1 transcription factor. We now show that it selectively activates specific Smad1-responsive genes, including JUNB, STAT1, and SOX4. Increased tumor growth and increased Ki67 expression in tissue was seen only with complete endoglin loss. By showing that endoglin increased TGFβ-mediated suppression of cell growth in vitro and TGFβ-mediated signaling in tumor tissue, loss of this growth-suppressive pathway appears to be implicated at least in part for the increased size of endoglin-deficient tumors. Endoglin is shown for the first time to suppress cell movement out of primary tumor as well as the formation of distant metastasis. It is also shown to co-regulate tumor growth and metastatic behavior in human PCa.""","""['Minalini Lakshman', 'Xiaoke Huang', 'Vijayalakshmi Ananthanarayanan', 'Borko Jovanovic', 'Yueqin Liu', 'Clarissa S Craft', 'Diana Romero', 'Calvin P H Vary', 'Raymond C Bergan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Endoglin-mediated suppression of prostate cancer invasion is regulated by activin and bone morphogenetic protein type II receptors.', 'Coculture with prostate cancer cells alters endoglin expression and attenuates transforming growth factor-beta signaling in reactive bone marrow stromal cells.', 'Genistein induces phenotypic reversion of endoglin deficiency in human prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of the TGF-β coreceptor endoglin in cancer.', 'Endoglin-targeted cancer therapy.', 'Correlation Between Endoglin and Malignant Phenotype in Human Melanoma Cells: Analysis of hsa-mir-214 and hsa-mir-370 in Cells and Their Extracellular Vesicles.', 'Endoglin in the Spotlight to Treat Cancer.', 'Endoglin: Beyond the Endothelium.', 'Endoglin Protein Interactome Profiling Identifies TRIM21 and Galectin-3 as New Binding Partners.', 'Opposing roles and potential antagonistic mechanism between TGF-β and BMP pathways: Implications for cancer progression.']"""

A human pilot study showed increased apoptosis after consumption of rye bran bread. In this study, we investigated the effect of high intake of rye whole grain and bran on prostate cancer progression as assessed by PSA concentration in men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Seventeen participants were provided with 485 g rye whole grain and bran products (RP) or refined wheat products with added cellulose (WP), corresponding to ~50% of daily energy intake, in a randomized controlled, crossover design. Blood samples were taken from fasting men before and after 2, 4, and 6 wk of treatment and 24-h urine samples were collected before the first intervention period and after treatment. Plasma total PSA concentrations were lower after treatment with RP compared with WP, with a mean treatment effect of -14% (P = 0.04). Additionally, fasting plasma insulin and 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion were lower after treatment with RP compared with WP (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively). Daily excretion of 5 lignans was higher after the RP treatment than after the WP treatment (P < 0.001).

Much of this research has been undertaken because the soybean is essentially a unique dietary source of isoflavones, a group of chemicals classified as phytoestrogens. The estrogen-like properties of isoflavones have also raised concern, however, that soyfoods might exert adverse effects in some individuals. There is intriguing animal and epidemiologic evidence indicating that modest amounts of soy consumed during childhood and/or adolescence reduces breast cancer risk. Evidence also suggests that soy reduces prostate cancer risk and inhibits prostate tumor metastasis, but additional clinical support for the chemopreventive effects of soyfoods is needed. Soy protein is modestly hypocholesterolemic and there is suggestive epidemiologic evidence that soyfoods lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) independent of effects on cholesterol. In clinical studies, soy favorably affects multiple CHD risk factors; however, with the exception of improved endothelial function, the data are too limited and/or inconsistent to allow definitive conclusions to be made. In regard to bone health, although recent clinical data have not supported the skeletal benefits of isoflavones, 2 large prospective epidemiologic studies found soy intake is associated with marked reductions in fracture risk. Soybean isoflavones also modestly alleviate hot flashes in menopausal women.

To explore the role of this phosphorylation on growth, we stably expressed wild-type and S81A mutant AR in LHS and LAPC4 cells. The cells with increased wild-type AR expression grow faster compared with parental cells and S81A mutant-expressing cells, indicating that loss of S81 phosphorylation limits cell growth. To explore how S81 regulates cell growth, we tested whether S81 phosphorylation regulates AR transcriptional activity. LHS cells stably expressing wild-type and S81A mutant AR showed differences in the regulation of endogenous AR target genes, suggesting that S81 phosphorylation regulates promoter selectivity. We next sought to identify the S81 kinase using ion trap mass spectrometry to analyze AR-associated proteins in immunoprecipitates from cells. We observed cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)9 association with the AR. CDK9 phosphorylates the AR on S81 in vitro. Phosphorylation is specific to S81 because CDK9 did not phosphorylate the AR on other serine phosphorylation sites. Overexpression of CDK9 with its cognate cyclin, Cyclin T, increased S81 phosphorylation levels in cells. Small interfering RNA knockdown of CDK9 protein levels decreased hormone-induced S81 phosphorylation. Additionally, treatment of LNCaP cells with the CDK9 inhibitors, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole and Flavopiridol, reduced S81 phosphorylation further, suggesting that CDK9 regulates S81 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of CDK9 also resulted in decreased AR transcription in LNCaP cells.

Materials and methods:   We examined an institutional database of all patients who received their first megavoltage radiotherapy for any type of cancer at the Liverpool and Macarthur Cancer Therapy Centres over the period 1997-2006. The database contains patient demographic data, dates, treatment sites and doses of radiotherapy. The treatment sites were entered as free text and were recoded into a limited number of sites; primary site, bone, brain, soft tissue, other and multiple, so that retreatment sites could be grouped for stratification and analysis. Multiple treatment sites that were part of a single treatment to a primary (for example, primary site and nodes) were recoded as 'primary'. The total retreatment ratio was defined as the number of episodes of radiotherapy divided by the number of cases in the cohort.  Results:   In the period 1997-2006, 7853 patients had received 9859 episodes of radiotherapy, giving a total retreatment ratio of 26 per 100 patients. In total, 6524 patients (83%) received only one episode of treatment and 1329 received two or more episodes of treatment. The average number of retreatments was 0.26. The tumour type with the highest mean number of retreatments was myeloma (1.05), followed by unknown primary (0.41), lung (0.34) and melanoma (0.32). The lowest mean number of retreatments was for the brain (0.06). The median time between treatment episodes was longest for breast cancer (12.5 months), then colorectal cancer (12.3 months), head and neck cancers (9.0 months), lung cancer (3.8 months) and prostate cancer (5.9 months).

Rectal dose-volume constraints, set as guidelines to reduce its incidence, vary among institutions. From a group of patients uniformly treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy, we correlated the incidence of late rectal toxicity with rectal dose-volume rectal constraints as described in three randomised trials for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Favourable-risk prostate cancer patients received a dose of 66 Gy in 22 fractions without hormonal therapy. Toxicity was prospectively assessed using Common Toxicity Criteria v3. The whole or part of the rectum and rectal wall were contoured as an organ at risk for all patients. The rectal constraints of the RTOG 0126, RTOG 0415 and the PROFIT trials were used to correlate with late rectal toxicity.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 58 months. Late rectal toxicity was 62, 20 and 18% for grades 0, 1 and 2/3, respectively. No statistically significant correlation was found between late rectal toxicity and the rectal constraints used in the three trials. The number of patients violating the recommended constraints was similar for the group with grade 2/3 toxicity and the group without any toxicity. Analysis derived from the actual dose-volume histogram dose parameters of this group of patients did not show a relationship between dose to volume of the rectum and late rectal toxicity that could generate a guideline of dose constraints.  Conclusion:   For this group of patients, despite the use of recognised dose-volume constraint guidelines of three trials, we were unable to establish a relationship between these constraints and the late rectal toxicity registered.

Beyond standard risk factors (age, digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, biopsy Gleason score, percentage of positive cores), five different PCA3 codings were used in logistic regression models to identify five distinct pathologic end points: (1) low-volume disease (<0.5 ml), (2) insignificant prostate cancer (PCa) according to the Epstein criteria, (3) extracapsular extension (ECE), (4) seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and (5) aggressive disease defined as Gleason sum ≥7. Accuracy estimates of each end point were quantified using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic analysis in models with and without PCA3.  Results and limitations:   PCA3 scores were significantly lower in low-volume disease and insignificant PCa (p ≤ 0.001). AUC of multivariable low-volume disease (+2.4 to +5.5%) and insignificant PCa models (+3 to +3.9%) increased when PCA3 was added to standard clinical risk factors. In contradistinction, regardless of its coding, PCA3 scores were not significantly elevated in pathologically confirmed ECE (p=0.4) or SVI (p=0.5), respectively. Higher PCA3 scores were associated with aggressive disease (p<0.001). Importantly, the addition of PCA3 to multivariable intermediate- and high-grade models did not improve prediction.

Recently, HDL, which transports sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), was reported to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) in cardiomyocytes. In this study, we examined the effect of HDL and S1P on Stat3 activation in prostate cancer cells and the involvement of S1P receptors in this process in three prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, LNCaP, and DU145).  Methods:   Discordial reconstituted(r) HDL containing POPC, apoA-1, and S1P were prepared by the cholate dialysis method. The phosphorylations of Stat3, ERK1/2, and Akt were detected by Western blotting. Cell migration and invasion were determined by wound-healing assay and matrigel invasion chamber assay.  Results:   HDL increased serine 727 phosphorylation of Stat3, but not tyrosine 705 only in DU145 cells. S1P and rHDL-S1P also induced the phosphorylation, but not rHDL without S1P. They also induced DU145 cells migration and invasion. PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, and pertussis toxin, a Gi inhibitor, attenuated HDL-, S1P-, and rHDL-S1P-induced Stat3 phosphorylation, whereas LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, had no effect. Concerning S1P receptors, S1P1 expression was much lower than S1P2 and S1P3 in DU145 cells. Both JTE013, a S1P2 antagonist, and VPC23019, a S1P1/S1P3 antagonist, attenuated HDL-, S1P-, and rHDL-S1P-induced Stat3 phosphorylations and cell migrations.

Therefore, inhibition of HDAC offers potential as an effective cancer treatment regimen. CG200745, (E)-N(1)-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N(8)-hydroxy-2-((naphthalene-1-loxy)methyl)oct-2-enediamide, is a novel HDAC inhibitor presently undergoing a phase I clinical trial. Enhancement of p53 acetylation by HDAC inhibitors induces cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in cancer cells. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of p53 acetylation in the cancer cell death caused by CG200745. CG200745-induced clonogenic cell death was 2-fold greater in RKO cells expressing wild-type p53 than in p53-deficient RC10.1 cells. CG200745 treatment was also cytotoxic to PC-3 human prostate cancer cells, which express wild-type p53. CG200745 increased acetylation of p53 lysine residues K320, K373, and K382. CG200745 induced the accumulation of p53, promoted p53-dependent transactivation, and enhanced the expression of MDM2 and p21(Waf1/Cip1) proteins, which are encoded by p53 target genes. An examination of CG200745 effects on p53 acetylation using cells transfected with various p53 mutants showed that cells expressing p53 K382R mutants were significantly resistant to CG200745-induced clonogenic cell death compared with wild-type p53 cells. Moreover, p53 transactivation in response to CG200745 was suppressed in all cells carrying mutant forms of p53, especially K382R. Taken together, these results suggest that acetylation of p53 at K382 plays an important role in CG200745-induced p53 transactivation and clonogenic cell death.""","""['Eun-Taex Oh', 'Moon-Taek Park', 'Bo-Hwa Choi', 'Seonggu Ro', 'Eun-Kyung Choi', 'Seong-Yun Jeong', 'Heon Joo Park']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Acetylation of p53 at lysine 373/382 by the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide induces expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1).', 'A novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, CG200745, potentiates anticancer effect of docetaxel in prostate cancer via decreasing Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL.', 'Inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) restore the p53 pathway in neuroblastoma cells.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors: signalling towards p21cip1/waf1.', 'Targeting histone deacetylases: development of vorinostat for the treatment of cancer.', 'A phase I/II study of ivaltinostat combined with gemcitabine and erlotinib in patients with untreated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Small Molecules Targeting HATs, HDACs, and BRDs in Cancer Therapy.', 'CG200745, a Novel HDAC Inhibitor, Attenuates Kidney Fibrosis in a Murine Model of Alport Syndrome.', 'Metformin and 4SC-202 synergistically promote intrinsic cell apoptosis by accelerating ΔNp63 ubiquitination and degradation in oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Renoprotective Effect of the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor CG200745 in DOCA-Salt Hypertensive Rats.']"""

Here, we assess, using ex vivo cultures of human prostate tissue, DDR caused by cytotoxic drugs (camptothecin, doxorubicin, etoposide, and cisplatin) and ionizing radiation (IR) in the context of normal tissue architecture. Using specific markers for basal and luminal epithelial cells, we determine and quantify cell compartment-specific damage recognition. IR, doxorubicin, and etoposide induced the phosphorylation of H2A.X on Ser(139) (γH2AX) and DNA damage foci formation. Surprisingly, luminal epithelial cells lack the prominent γH2AX response after IR when compared with basal cells, although ATM phosphorylation on Ser(1981) and 53BP1 foci were clearly detectable in both cell types. The attenuated γH2AX response seems to result from low levels of total H2A.X in the luminal cells. Marked increase in p53, a downstream target of the activated ATM pathway, was detected only in response to camptothecin and doxorubicin. These findings emphasize the diversity of pathways activated by DNA damage in slowly replicating tissues and reveal an unexpected deviation in the prostate luminal compartment that may be relevant in prostate tumorigenesis.

Clinical variables such as Gleason grade and stage are useful predictors of lethal cancer; however, the low predictive values of the common Gleason scores, changes in grading over time, and earlier diagnosis of patients due to screening limits their clinical utility. Identifying genetic variants associated with lethal prostate cancer could inform clinical decision making.  Methods:   We conducted a genome-wide association study, comparing lethal prostate cancer cases to cases surviving at least 10 years beyond their initial diagnosis. Genotyping was done with the Affymetrix 5.0 chip [∼500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and 1,483 copy number variants (CNV)] on DNA from participants in the Physicians' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (196 lethal cases, 368 long-term survivors). After excluding SNPs and individuals based on quality control criteria, logistic regression assuming an additive model was done using the PLINK software.  Results:   No SNP reached genome-wide significance (P ≤ 1 × 10(-7)); however, three independent SNPs had P < 1 × 10(-5). One top-ranked SNP replicated (P = 0.05) in an independent follow-up study.

Megadalton complexes of HA with proteoglycans create a hydrated connective tissue matrix, which may play an important role in tumor stroma formation. Through its colloid osmotic effects, HA complexes contribute to tumor interstitial fluid pressure, limiting the effect of therapeutic molecules on malignant cells. The therapeutic potential of enzymatic remodeling of the tumor microenvironment through HA depletion was initially investigated using a recombinant human HA-degrading enzyme, rHuPH20, which removed HA-dependent tumor cell extracellular matrices in vitro. However, rHuPH20 showed a short serum half-life (t(1/2) < 3 minutes), making depletion of tumor HA in vivo impractical. A pegylated variant of rHuPH20, PEGPH20, was therefore evaluated. Pegylation improved serum half-life (t(1/2) = 10.3 hours), making it feasible to probe the effects of sustained HA depletion on tumor physiology. In high-HA prostate PC3 tumors, i.v. administration of PEGPH20 depleted tumor HA, decreased tumor interstitial fluid pressure by 84%, decreased water content by 7%, decompressed tumor vessels, and increased tumor vascular area >3-fold. Following repeat PEGPH20 administration, tumor growth was significantly inhibited (tumor growth inhibition, 70%). Furthermore, PEGPH20 enhanced both docetaxel and liposomal doxorubicin activity in PC3 tumors (P < 0.05) but did not significantly improve the activity of docetaxel in low-HA prostate DU145 tumors.

Patients and methods:   Using the Surveillance Epidemiology and END Results Registry, we identified men who had a TURP subsequent to their diagnosis of prostate cancer, from 1998 or 1999. The outcome of interest was disease progression, as defined by the initiation of androgen-deprivation therapy or procedures indicating progressive urinary obstruction. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the adjusted odds of signal events related to disease progression adjusting for the concurrent effect of the covariates.  Results:   There were 29,361 men with prostate cancer and 2742 (9.3%) had a TURP after the diagnosis. These men had a mean age of 75 years and were unlikely to undergo definitive primary treatment. Men receiving TURP were more likely to undergo orchidectomy than men who did not have a TURP (odds ratio 1.64; 95% confidence interval 1.03-2.60) even after adjusting for differences in cancer-directed treatment, tumour stage and grade, prostate-specific antigen level, race, and age at diagnosis. These men were also more likely to have malignant urinary obstruction (ureteric and bladder outlet) than were men who did not have TURP.  Conclusion:   The requirement for TURP is an adverse prognostic marker even when this is adjusted for classical tumour characteristics. Although the exact reasons for this finding are unclear, consideration should be given to adjuvant treatment in patients undergoing TURP.""","""['Tracey L Krupski', 'George J Stukenborg', 'Kihyuck Moon', 'Dan Theodorescu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Palliative transurethral prostate resection for bladder outlet obstruction in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Oncological and safety profiles in patients undergoing simultaneous transurethral resection (TUR) of bladder tumour and TUR of the prostate.', 'Risk of prostate cancer and death after benign transurethral resection of the prostate-A 20-year population-based analysis.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update.', 'Simultaneous transurethral resection of bladder tumour and prostate: is it safe?', 'Metastatic prostate cancer with low PSA levels diagnosed after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate.', 'Commentary: The impact of palliative transurethral resection of the prostate on the prognosis of patients with bladder outlet obstruction and metastatic prostate cancer: A population-matched study.', 'Relationships between holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and prostate cancer.', 'Toxicity and outcomes after external beam irradiation for prostate cancer in patients with prior holmium laser enucleation of the prostate: Early experience.', 'The Impact of Palliative Transurethral Resection of the Prostate on the Prognosis of Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction and Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Population-Matched Study.']"""

A meta-analysis""","""Purpose:   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of simultaneous resection in the treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Patients and methods:   Combined published data from comparative studies on simultaneous transurethral resection of bladder tumor/transurethral resection of the prostate (TURBT/TURP) vs TURBT alone in NMIBC were analyzed, considering possible confounding factors. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as the primary effect size to estimate the outcome of overall tumor recurrence, recurrence in bladder neck/prostatic fossa.  Results:   In six eligible clinical trials, 483 patients were treated with simultaneous resection and 500 with TURBT alone. Within the follow-up period, tumor recurrence developed in 203 (42%) patients in the simultaneous resection group and 256 (51.2%) patients in the control group. The combined analysis indicated that the recurrence rate in the simultaneous resection group was statistically significantly lower than in the control group in the overall pooled data (combined OR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88, P = 0.003). Tumor recurrence of bladder neck/prostatic fossa developed in 37(7.7%) patients in the simultaneous resection group and 42 (8.4%) patients in the control group. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups (combined OR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.49, P = 0.74). Potential confounders, such as mean age, mean follow-up duration, multiplicity of tumor, and year of publication did not significantly influence the results.  Conclusion:   There was at least the evidence that simultaneous TURBT/TURP did not increase the overall recurrence rate and recurrence rate in bladder neck/prostatic fossa.

Paired (benign and tumor) samples were isolated from 23 Gleason Score 6 (GS 6) and 23 Gleason Score 8 and higher (GS 8+) radical prostatectomy specimens and subjected to 2D-DIGE analysis. Minimal fluorescent dye labeling was applied and electrophoresis performed with triple samples (paired benign and tumor; internal control) for each case of tumor. Nineteen differently abundant proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and further validated. One half of them were associated with glycolysis and the Warburg effect; these were upregulated in tumors. The upregulation correlated with tumor dedifferentiation and might be relevant for selection of therapeutic strategies. Among the other proteins, heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) was significantly upregulated in tumor tissue compared to its benign counterpart. Furthermore, lamin A was statistically highly discriminatory between low and high Gleason score tumors and might serve as a new biomarker of tumor differentiation and prognosis.""","""['Sergej Skvortsov', 'Georg Schäfer', 'Taras Stasyk', 'Christian Fuchsberger', 'Guenther Karl Bonn', 'Georg Bartsch', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Lukas Alfons Huber']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Proteome Res""","""['Profiling protein markers associated with lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer by DIGE-based proteomics analysis.', 'Characterization of proteins in human pancreatic cancer serum using differential gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Prohibitin identified by proteomic analysis of prostate biopsies distinguishes hyperplasia and cancer.', 'Proteomics for the identification of new prostate cancer biomarkers.', 'Mass spectrometry-based proteomics: the road to lung cancer biomarker discovery.', 'Potential Role of Seven Proteomics Tissue Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer in Urine.', 'LMNB1, a potential marker for early prostate cancer progression.', 'Discovery of surface biomarkers for cell mechanophenotype via an intracellular protein-based enrichment strategy.', 'Multiparametric MRI and Radiomics in Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Literature.', 'Exploiting the HSP60/10 chaperonin system as a chemotherapeutic target for colorectal cancer.']"""
