Here, we report that exposure of A549 human lung cancer cells to mifepristone caused an atypical induction of the cellular unfolded protein response, as evidenced by the time-dependent stimulation of RNA levels of the chaperone Grp94 and PDIa, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated receptors ATF6, PERK and eIF2 but not of their downstream target, transcription factor ATF4. This profile was very different from that of progesterone, which at the same dose as mifepristone, failed to induce all of the ER-stress-related genes examined, apart from PERK. Furthermore, XBP1, a transcription factor that is regulated predominantly by alternative splicing by the IRE1 receptor, remains unspliced and therefore inactive either by mifepristone or progesterone treatment. Finally, the pro-apoptotic molecules CHOP and BIM are only induced in the presence of tunicamycin in the culture medium. Tunicamycin, the most commonly used pharmacologic inducer of ER stress that triggers the canonical ER stress response, was used for comparison purposes. Our results suggest that mifepristone can elicit an atypical ER stress response when used at different doses and for different time points. The subsequent induction of UPR should be taken into consideration when this agent is being used either for therapeutic or for experimental uses.""","""['N Dioufa', 'E Kassi', 'A G Papavassiliou', 'H Kiaris']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Endocrine""","""['Mifepristone increases mRNA translation rate, triggers the\xa0unfolded protein response, increases autophagic flux, and\xa0kills ovarian cancer cells in combination with proteasome\xa0or lysosome inhibitors.', 'The kinase PERK and the transcription factor ATF4 play distinct and essential roles in autophagy resulting from tunicamycin-induced ER stress.', 'Dienogest regulates apoptosis, proliferation, and invasiveness of endometriotic cyst stromal cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress induction.', 'The Role of the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP Signaling Pathway in Tumor Progression During Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.', 'Unfolding anti-tumor immunity: ER stress responses sculpt tolerogenic myeloid cells in cancer.', 'Hypoxia activates the unfolded protein response signaling network: An adaptive mechanism for endometriosis.', 'Multiple Components of Protein Homeostasis Pathway Can Be Targeted to Produce Drug Synergies with VCP Inhibitors in Ovarian Cancer.', 'Impact of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) and its receptor (RAGE) on cancer metabolic signaling pathways and its progression.', 'Hypoxia induces miR-153 through the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway to fine tune the HIF1α/VEGFA axis in breast cancer angiogenesis.', 'Antiprogestins in gynecological diseases.']"""

We studied association, between serum leptin and carcinoma prostate in Asian (Indian) population and its association with obesity.  Material and methods:   30 prospective cases of cancer prostate and 30 age matched controls were included in this study. Body mass index (BMI) was estimated and categorized in 4 groups by WHO criteria. Waist hip ratio (WHR) was calculated and divided into three groups. Serum leptin was estimated by sandwich ELISA technique (DRG leptin ELISA kit, Marburg, Germany).  Results:   Both the groups were comparable for age, WHR and BMI. Serum leptin was significantly higher in patients with cancer prostate as compared to controls (median 14.18 ng/ml vs. 1.63 ng/ml; p< 0.001). The level of leptin was found to have positive correlation with BMI and WHR in controls (r=0.485, p=0.007; r=0.314, p=0.091, respectively) however, no correlation was observed in patients with cancer prostate (r=0.071, p=0.711; r=0.067, p=0.725, respectively). There was no correlation between leptin and PSA. The serum leptin level was not related to the Gleason's score and stage of the carcinoma.  Conclusions:   This study shows that Prostate cancer is associated with raised serum leptin which is independent of obesity and serum PSA. It hints the role of leptin in pathogenesis of this tumor. It may not be a surrogate marker of aggressiveness.

Here, we report that human RecQL4 helicase, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of a subset of cancer-prone Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, is highly elevated in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Increased RecQL4 expression was also detected in human prostate tumor tissues as a function of tumor grade with the highest expression level in metastatic tumor samples, suggesting that RecQL4 may be a potential prognostic factor for advanced stage of prostate cancer. Transient and stable suppression of RecQL4 by small interfering RNA and short hairpin RNA vectors drastically reduced the growth and survival of metastatic prostate cancer cells, indicating that RecQL4 is a prosurvival factor for prostate cancer cells. RecQL4 suppression led to increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) synthesis and RecQL4-suppressed prostate cancer cells underwent an extensive apoptotic death in a PARP-1-dependent manner. Most notably, RecQL4 knockdown in metastatic prostate cancer cells drastically reduced their cell invasiveness in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, showing that RecQL4 is essential for prostate cancer promotion. Observation of a direct interaction of retinoblastoma (Rb) and E2F1 proteins with RecQL4 promoter suggests that Rb-E2F1 pathway may regulate RecQL4 expression.

Studies of modified resveratrol may reveal features that affect its bioefficacy and bioavailability. We compared the anti-proliferative and gene regulatory activities of resveratrol with trimethoxy-resveratrol and triacetyl-resveratrol using cultured human prostate cancer (CaP) cells. LNCaP cells were incubated with resveratrol and its analogues. Changes in proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, apoptosis and prostate specific antigen (PSA) PSA were determined. DNA damage was assayed by phosphorylated-histone H2AX changes. Expression of total and serine-15-phosphorylated p53 and p53-inducible cell cycle regulatory protein p21 and ribonucleotide reductase subunit p53R2 involved in DNA repair were measured by immunobloting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Exposure to resveratrol or triacetyl-resveratrol activated p53, increased p21 and p53R2 and decreased PSA expression in LNCaP cells. These changes were attenuated by the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α. However, LNCaP cells exposed to trimethoxy-resveratrol showed induction of apoptosis, reduction in G₁ and prolongation of the SG₂M phases. Resveratrol and analogues were also studied in CWR22Rv1 (containing mutated p53) and p53-null PC-3 cells. CWR22Rv1 cells exposed to resveratrol and triacetyl-resveratrol showed a G₁S block, concomitant with increased p53 and p21 expression; however, identically treated PC-3 cells showed attenuated progression through the SG₂M phases. Trimethoxy-resveratrol did not affect CWR22Rv1 cell cycle but reduced and expanded PC-3 cells in the G₁ and SG₂M phases, respectively.

Large numbers of gene-expression datasets on different aspects of prostate tumorigenesis are available. We used these data to identify and prioritize candidate genes associated with the development of prostate cancer and bone metastases. Our working hypothesis was that combining meta-analyses on different but overlapping steps of prostate tumorigenesis will improve identification of genes associated with prostate cancer development.  Methods:   A Z score-based meta-analysis of gene-expression data was used to identify candidate genes associated with prostate cancer development. To put together different datasets, we conducted a meta-analysis on 3 levels that follow the natural history of prostate cancer development. For experimental verification of candidates, we used in silico validation as well as in-house gene-expression data.  Results:   Genes with experimental evidence of an association with prostate cancer development were overrepresented among our top candidates. The meta-analysis also identified a considerable number of novel candidate genes with no published evidence of a role in prostate cancer development. Functional annotation identified cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, and cell motility as the top functions associated with prostate cancer development. We identified 10 genes--CDC2, CCNA2, IGF1, EGR1, SRF, CTGF, CCL2, CAV1, SMAD4, and AURKA--that form hubs of the interaction network and therefore are likely to be primary drivers of prostate cancer development.

Patients and methods:   • In all, 57 patients underwent endorectal MRI at 1.5 T before radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer. • On T2W images and histological whole-mount analysis, the peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) were divided into upper and lower glands, as well as left and right halves, thus yielding four quadrants for each zone. • On histological analysis, the total number of tumour foci, their location and larger diameter were recorded. T2W alone, T2W + DWI, T2W + DCE and all three techniques combined were scored for the likelihood of tumour in each area and results were compared with whole-mount analysis. • The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(z)) was used to evaluate accuracy for tumour detection. The association between MR accuracy and Gleason score was statistically assessed.  Results:   • Of the 456 prostate octants analysed, 145 showed cancer on whole-mount analysis, 120 (83%) of them with a diameter assumed to correspond to a volume >0.2 cm³.

Patients and methods:   • Data on a subset of patients from a population-based case-cohort study was used to assess the effect of lymph node removal on prostate cancer-specific mortality. • The subset included in this report were those 281 patients from the parent study who were treated with prostatectomy and had a pelvic lymph node dissection and for whom we had a record of the number of nodes removed (the sub-cohort) and 41 patients fitting the same criteria who died of their prostate cancer within 10 years (the cases). • Study variables included number of lymph nodes removed, lymph node status, age, pre-treatment PSA, T category, Gleason score and use of hormonal therapy. • We ran a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis that accounted for the study design and allowed us to consider these patient and disease characteristics as potential confounders of the association of interest. • In a secondary analysis, the results were stratified by nodal status.  Results:   • The crude hazard ratio (HR), which is a measure of relative risk, was not statistically significantly associated with a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer mortality as the number of lymph nodes removed at PLND increased (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.91-1.03). • None of the variables considered as potential confounders had an impact on the crude HR. Using two cut points to categorize the number of lymph nodes removed, one at 4 or more removed and the other at 10 or more removed resulted in HRs indicating a risk reduction of 25% in both cases, although these results were not statistically significant. • When we analyzed the association by pathological nodal status, we observed a possible increase in risk in the node-positive group (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.86, 1.42), while those with negative lymph nodes may have benefited from increasing numbers removed (HR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.89,1.02).

In addition, treating PC-3 cells with rh-GDF-9 resulted in them becoming more adhesive. Both endogenous and exogenous GDF-9 was demonstrated to up-regulate focal adhesion associated proteins FAK and paxillin which contribute to promoted cell adhesion and motility. With the use of a Smad3 inhibitor, this effect was inhibited suggesting that GDF-9 signals via Smad3 to up-regulate expression of these proteins.

Members of the pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepine (PBOX) family of compounds exhibit anti-cancer properties in cancer cell lines (including multi-drug resistant cells), ex vivo patient samples and in vivo mouse tumour models with minimal toxicity to normal cells. Recently, they have also been found to possess anti-angiogenic properties in vitro. However, both the apoptotic pathways and the overall extent of the apoptotic response induced by PBOX compounds tend to be cell-type specific. Since the effect of the PBOX compounds on prostate cancer has not yet been elucidated, the purpose of this study was to investigate if PBOX compounds induce anti-proliferative effects on hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells. We examined the effect of two representative PBOX compounds, PBOX-6 and PBOX-15, on the androgen-independent human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line, PC3. PBOX-6 and -15 displayed anti-proliferative effects on PC3 cells, mediated initially through a sustained G2/M arrest. G2/M arrest, illustrated as DNA tetraploidy, was accompanied by microtubule depolymerisation and phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and the mitotic spindle checkpoint protein BubR1. Phosphorylation of BubR1 is indicative of an active mitotic checkpoint and results in maintenance of cell cycle arrest. G2/M arrest was followed by apoptosis illustrated by DNA hypoploidy and PARP cleavage and was accompanied by degradation of BubR1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, sequential treatment with the CDK1-inhibitor, flavopiridol, synergistically enhanced PBOX-induced apoptosis.

The RC-77T/E cells produced tumors in SCID mice whereas the RC-77N/E cells produced no tumor in SCID mice. These cells expressed androgen-regulated prostate-specific homobox gene, NKX 3.1, epithelial cell specific cytokeratn 8, androgen receptor (AR), prostate specific antigen (PSA), and p16. Chromosome analysis showed that both cell lines are similar; near diploid human male (XY) with most chromosome counts in the 45-48 range. However, RC-77T/E cell line has new marker chromosomes: M1B=del/t(4;?)(q28;?), M5=16q+ in addition to those observed in the RC-77N/E cell line (M1=del(4)(q28q34)+hsr in some, M1A=t(4q;?),M2=der(9?),M2A=del(M2p-),M3=iso(?), M4=der(22?)). This is the first documented case of the establishment of pair of non-malignant and malignant tumors derived from an African American prostate cancer patient. These models will provide novel tools to study the molecular and genetic mechanisms of prostate carcinogenesis, especially for high-risk African American men.""","""['Shaniece Theodore', 'Starlette Sharp', 'Jianjun Zhou', 'Timothy Turner', 'Hongzhen Li', 'Jun Miki', 'Youngmi Ji', 'Vyomesh Patel', 'Clayton Yates', 'Johng S Rhim']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['A novel neoplastic primary tumor-derived human prostate epithelial cell line.', 'Androgen and androgen receptor antagonist responsive primary African-American benign prostate epithelial cell line.', 'A telomerase-immortalized primary human prostate cancer clonal cell line with neoplastic phenotypes.', 'Immortalized and tumorigenic adult human prostatic epithelial cell lines: characteristics and applications.

The PC-3 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of oridonin solution and nanosuspensions for 12 hours, 24 hours, and 36 hours. MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay was performed to measure cellular viability and investigate the effect of oridonin on cell growth of PC-3. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining method was used to determine the effect of oridonin by fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry, respectively. Nanosuspension on early apoptosis of PC-3 cells was also evaluated. Oridonin significantly inhibited the growth of PC-3 cells after 12 hours, 24 hours, and 36 hours of treatment in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Compared with the same concentration of oridonin solution, oridonin nanosuspension enhanced the inhibition ratio of proliferation. The observation of propidium iodide fluorescence staining confirmed the MTT assay results. The cell proportion of PC-3 at the G2/M phase in the nanosuspension treatment group was upregulated compared with that of the control and oridonin solution groups. Both oridonin solution and nanosuspension promoted the early apoptosis of PC-3 cells. Furthermore, while improving the ratio of early apoptosis, oridonin nanosuspensions also enhanced growth suppression, and induced apoptosis of PC-3 cells. This shows great potential in the treatment of androgen-independent carcinoma of prostate by oridonin nanosuspensions.""","""['Zhen Zhang', 'Xiumei Zhang', 'Wei Xue', 'Yuna Yangyang', 'Derong Xu', 'Yunxue Zhao', 'Haiyan Lou']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Oridonin nanosuspension was more effective than free oridonin on G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cell line.', 'Studies on pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of oridonin nanosuspensions.', 'Oridonin triggers apoptosis in colorectal carcinoma cells and suppression of microRNA-32 expression augments oridonin-mediated apoptotic effects.', 'In vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of oridonin nanosuspension.', 'Oridonin nanosuspension enhances anti-tumor efficacy in SMMC-7721 cells and H22 tumor bearing mice.', 'Solubility and Bioavailability Enhancement of Oridonin: A Review.', 'Natural Diterpenoid Oridonin Ameliorates Experimental Autoimmune Neuritis by Promoting Anti-inflammatory Macrophages Through Blocking Notch Pathway.', 'Oridonin induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in hormone-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Discovery and development of natural product oridonin-inspired anticancer agents.', 'Oridonin ameliorates neuropathological changes and behavioural deficits in a mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis.']"""

In this study, we report on the in vivo antitumor efficacy of an efficacious albumin-binding prodrug of doxorubicin (PSA9) that incorporates p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) as a self-immolative spacer in addition to the heptapeptide, Arg-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Tyr-Ser-Leu, which serves as a substrate for PSA. The prodrug is cleaved very efficiently by PSA releasing H-Ser-Leu-PABC-doxorubicin and subsequently doxorubicin in PSA-positive cell lysates and prostate tumor homogenates as the final cleavage product. PSA9 at 3 × 6 mg kg(-1) doxorubicin equivalents (intravenous) was compared with conventional doxorubicin at equitoxic doses (at 3 × 3 mg kg(-1); intravenous) in an orthotopic mouse model of prostate cancer using LNCaP lentiviral luciferase-neomycin cells transduced with luciferase. Whereas doxorubicin did not show any efficacy against the primary tumor or metastases, the prodrug reduced the primary tumor by 30-50% and circulating PSA levels, and in addition, showed a pronounced reduction in lung and bone metastases by ∼77% and ∼96%, respectively, and a positive trend regarding the activity against liver and lymph-node metastases compared with control and doxorubicin-treated animals. The incorporation of PABC as a self-immolative spacer together with a PSA substrate demonstrates superior antitumor effects over doxorubicin attributed to an efficient cleavage by PSA releasing doxorubicin as the final active agent in prostate tumor homogenates. Using this approach for developing effective prodrugs against prostate cancer, is worthy of further preclinical optimization.""","""['B Elsadek', 'R Graeser', 'N Esser', 'C Schäfer-Obodozie', 'C Tsurumi', 'K Abu Ajaj', 'A Warnecke', 'C Unger', 'T Saleem', 'F Kratz']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Development of a novel prodrug of paclitaxel that is cleaved by prostate-specific antigen: an in vitro and in vivo evaluation study.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of an albumin-binding prodrug of doxorubicin that is cleaved by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a PSA-positive orthotopic prostate carcinoma model (LNCaP).', 'Development of albumin-binding doxorubicin prodrugs that are cleaved by prostate-specific antigen.', 'Human prostate cancer progression models and therapeutic intervention.', 'Targeted prodrug approaches for hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in bone with other sites: clinical characteristics, molecular features and immune status.', 'Screening for new peptide substrates for the development of albumin binding anticancer pro-drugs that are cleaved by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to improve the anti tumor efficacy.', 'Enhanced anti-tumor activity of the Multi-Leu peptide PACE4 inhibitor transformed into an albumin-bound tumor-targeting prodrug.', 'Cytosine arabinoside prodrug designed to bind plasma serum albumin for drug delivery.', 'TRIM24 Is an Oncogenic Transcriptional Activator in Prostate Cancer.']"""

So, colonoscopy and measurement of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) may be performed during a short term in a given patient. We aimed to evaluate whether colonoscopy affects serum PSA levels and to evaluate the relationship between prostate volume and elevation in serum PSA levels after colonoscopy. This study included 44 consecutive male patients, who underwent colonoscopy. The mean age of the patients was 56.05±9.27 years. The mean time required for colonoscopy was 30 min. Serum PSA levels were measured 48-72 hours before colonoscopy, immediately after performing laxative enema, and at 24-48th hour, the 7th day, and the 14th day after colonoscopy in each patient. The serum PSA level was elevated after enema and at 24-48th hour and 7th day after colonoscopy from the baseline (p<0.05), and declined to the baseline by 14th day. When the cut off value of 20 cm3 for normal prostate volume was taken into account, the serum PSA levels were significantly higher at the 24-48th hour and the 7th day in patients with larger prostate volume (>20 cm3) than those with normal prostate volume (p=0.013 and p=0.009). These results suggest that PSA is easily released by manipulations from the larger prostate. In conclusion, serum PSA levels were elevated during 7 days after colonoscopy.

Patients and methods:   Men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PC) starting continuous ADT were enrolled in this matched cohort study. Physical function was assessed with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), grip strength, and the timed-up-and-go (TUG) test, representing endurance and upper and lower extremity strength, respectively. Quality of life (QOL) was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Subjects were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.

Results:   We enrolled 87 patients on ADT, 86 PC controls, and 86 healthy controls; groups were similar in age (mean, 69.1 years; range, 50 to 87) and physical function. The 6MWT distance remained stable in the ADT group (P = .96) but improved in both control groups (P < .05). Grip strength declined in the ADT group (P = .04), remained stable in PC controls (P = .31), and improved in healthy controls (P = .008).

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? While epidemiological studies have shown a significantly lower incidence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate in Asia than the United States, several studies have demonstrated that Asian Americans present with more advanced stages, higher tumour grades, and worse mortality-incidence ratios than Caucasian Americans. This study, conducted in an equal access military healthcare system, reveals improved pathological and survival outcomes in Asian Americans compared to other races. This may indicate that worsened outcomes previously reported among Asian Americans diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate may be related to access to care, language barriers, socioeconomic status, or cultural factors.  Objective:   • To characterize the incidence, management and clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer (CaP) in a population of Asian Americans undergoing mandatory annual screening in an equal access healthcare system.  Patients and methods:   • Men registered into the military-based Center for Prostate Disease Research multi-institutional database from 1989-2007 with biopsy-proven CaP and categorized as Asian American, Caucasian or African American were included. • Demographic information, treatment modality, clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes were compared.  Results:   • In total, there were 10,964 patients; 583 (5.3%) were Asian Americans. Asian Americans had lower clinical stage (P < 0.001) but worse biopsy grade (P < 0.001) than other groups. They were more likely to choose radical prostatectomy (RP) (P < 0.001) and showed a higher percentage of organ-confined disease (P < 0.001). • Asian Americans had improved biochemical recurrence free (P < 0.01) and overall survival (P < 0.001) rates compared to African Americans or Caucasians treated with RP or external radiation therapy.  Conclusions:   • Asian Americans with CaP treated in an equal access healthcare system have improved pathological outcomes and survival characteristics compared to other races. • Asian ethnicity's negative impact on survival noted by others appears to be the result of factors other than the tumour's intrinsic behaviour, such as language barriers, socioeconomic status and cultural norms.""","""['Eliza M Raymundo', 'Kevin R Rice', 'Yongmei Chen', 'Jinxiu Zhao', 'Stephen A Brassell']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Association between race and oncologic outcome following radical prostatectomy for clinically organ-confined prostate cancer: a long-term follow-up study.', 'Pathological outcome and biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy in African-American, Afro-Caribbean (Jamaican) and Caucasian-American men: an international comparison.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Racial differences in prostate cancer treatment outcomes: a systematic review.', 'Pathology of premalignant lesions and carcinoma of the prostate in African-American men.', 'Clinical outcome and prognostic factors for Asian patients in Phase I clinical trials.', 'Competing risk of the specific mortality among Asian-American patients with prostate cancer: a surveillance, epidemiology, and end results analysis.', 'Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Diet, Lifestyle, Family History, and Screening Patterns.', 'Race and prostate imaging: implications for targeted biopsy and image-based prostate cancer interventions.', 'Prostate Cancer Disparities in Risk Group at Presentation and Access to Treatment for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders: A Study With Disaggregated Ethnic Groups.']"""

The novel discovery of non-endothelialized vessel-like channels in malignant tumors called vasculogenic mimicry has provided new insights about tumor behavior and also serves as a potential target for drug therapy. Although the association between vasculogenic mimicry and poor prognosis has been established in some tumors, there are only a few studies concerning prostatic carcinoma.  Methods:   Using a histochemical and immunohistochemical dual staining method for PAS-CD34 and special immunohistochemical staining for laminin, we studied the presence and pattern of non-endothelialized channels known as vasculogenic mimicry as well as the quantity of endothelialized vessels designated as microvessel density in usual paraffin sections of 20 low-grade and 20 high-grade prostatic adenocarcinomas by routine light microscopy.  Results:   We found a direct positive relationship between higher microvessel density and tumor grade (P<0.001), presence of vascular invasion (P<0.001) and percent of involved tissue (P<0.001); however, no such relationship was found with vasculogenic mimicry and only a weak correlation was noted between vasculogenic mimicry and perineurial invasion (P=0.03).  Conclusion:   Unlike other cancers and despite the results of in vitro studies on prostatic adenocarcinoma, we were not able to demonstrate a significant relationship between vasculogenic mimicry channels and histologic grading as one of the most important prognostic factors; however, this may be due to an inherent limitation of prostatic tissue imposed by abundant smooth muscle fibers stained by this method. On the other hand, microvessel density scoring appears to be an important, simple, and applicable histologic tool for prostatic cancer evaluation in daily practice.""","""['Seyed Ali Ahmadi', 'Mahnaz Moinfar', 'Katayoun Gohari Moghaddam', 'Moslem Bahadori']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Arch Iran Med""","""['Prognostic role of vasculogenic mimicry in colorectal cancer.', 'Microvessel density is not increased in prostate cancer: digital imaging of routine sections and tissue microarrays.', 'Correlation between neovascularisation and neuroendocrine differentiation in prostatic carcinoma.', 'Vasculogenic mimicry.', 'Vasculogenic mimicry and tumor angiogenesis.', 'TJP1 promotes vascular mimicry in bladder cancer by facilitating VEGFA expression and transcriptional activity through TWIST1.', 'Serum-Exosome-Derived miRNAs Serve as Promising Biomarkers for HCC Diagnosis.', 'Aberrant expression of MYH9 and E-cadherin in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and their relationship to vasculogenic mimicry.', 'Kaempferol Promotes Apoptosis While Inhibiting Cell Proliferation via Androgen-Dependent Pathway and Suppressing Vasculogenic Mimicry and Invasion in Prostate Cancer.', 'The clinicopathological significance of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C, leucine-rich repeated-containing G protein-coupled receptor, WW domain-containing oxidoreductase, and vasculogenic mimicry in invasive breast carcinoma.']"""

PC-3 (prostate); HepG2 (hepatoma) and A375 (melanoma) cancer cells all exhibited perchlorate-sensitive iodide uptake after infection with Ad-SUR-NIS, approximately 50 times higher than that of negative control Ad-CMV-GFP-infected cells. No significant iodide uptake was observed in normal human dental pulp fibroblast (DPF) cells after infection with Ad-SUR-NIS. Clonogenic assays demonstrated that Ad-SUR-NIS-infected cancer cells were selectively killed by exposure to (131)I. Ad-SUR-NIS-infected tumors show significant radioiodine accumulation (13.3 ± 2.85% ID per g at 2 h post-injection), and the effective half-life was 3.1 h. Moreover, infection with Ad-SUR-NIS in combination with (131)I suppressed tumor growth.

Small interfering RNA-mediated DR5 silencing rescued cells from sensitizing effects of platinum drugs on TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation and apoptosis, showing the functional importance of DR5 in the effects observed.

Results:   AR positively regulated mTOR activity in both low and high testosterone levels. TSC1 and TSC2, the two negative regulators of mTOR, may be involved since both were up-regulated by AR knockdown. Sub-baseline mTOR increased AR protein levels. However, this effect only occurred with low testosterone. More cells underwent apoptosis if AR function was inhibited during glucose deprivation, which significantly depressed mTOR activity.  Conclusion:   The compensatory increase of AR function due to a repressed mTOR signal is advantageous for survival. Disrupting this loop at the time of initiation of androgen deprivation therapy may delay, or even prevent, the recurrence of prostate cancer.""","""['Yue Wu', 'Rishi Raj Chhipa', 'Jinrong Cheng', 'Haitao Zhang', 'James L Mohler', 'Clement Ip']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Androgen receptor functions as a negative transcriptional regulator of DEPTOR, mTOR inhibitor.', 'Metformin represses androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancers by targeting androgen receptor.', 'Androgen deprivation and androgen receptor competition by bicalutamide induce autophagy of hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells and confer resistance to apoptosis.', 'Androgen suppresses proliferation of castration-resistant LNCaP 104-R2 prostate cancer cells through androgen receptor, Skp2, and c-Myc.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'PI5P4Kα supports prostate cancer metabolism and exposes a survival vulnerability during androgen receptor inhibition.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Transcription in Prostate Cancer.', 'Maternal High-Fat Diet Consumption and Chronic Hyperandrogenemia Are Associated With Placental Dysfunction in Female Rhesus Macaques.', 'Molecules targeting the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis beyond the AR-Ligand binding domain.', 'mTOR inhibitors for treatment of low-risk prostate cancer.']"""

The present study evaluated the efficacy of combining BCL-2 ODN and radiation in small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) cell lines.  Materials and methods:   The in vitro effect was determined using short term (cell viability) and long term (clonogenic) assays. Apoptosis, BCL-2 expression and intratumoural uptake of the FAM-ODN with or without prior radiation treatment were also evaluated. Combination of ODN and RT was also assessed in vivo.  Results:   Radiation was shown to increase intracellular and intratumoural penetration of oblimersen, confirming previous results obtained in prostate cancer xenograft models. Oblimersen decreased BCL-2 protein expression in vitro and in vivo. BCL-2 ODN sensitised H69 cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. Oblimersen increased radiation-induced apoptosis and decreased in vivo tumoural vascularisation.  Conclusion:   Oblimersen was shown to increase in vitro and in vivo effect of RT on SCLC cell lines.

Methods and materials:   For 21 patients treated with stereographic targeting marker-based online translation corrections, dose distributions with varying margins and gradients were created. Sets of possible cumulative delivered dose distributions were simulated by moving voxels and accumulating dose per voxel. Voxel motion was simulated consistent with measured distributions of systematic and random displacements due to stereographic targeting inaccuracies, deformation, rotation, and intrafraction motion. The method of simulation maintained measured correlation of voxel motions due to organ deformation.  Results:   For the clinical target volume including prostate and seminal vesicles (SV), the probability that some part receives <95% of the prescribed dose, the changes in minimum dose, and volume receiving 95% of prescription dose compared with planning were 80.5% ± 19.2%, 9.0 ± 6.8 Gy, and 3.0% ± 3.7%, respectively, for the smallest studied margins (3 mm prostate, 5 mm SV) and steepest dose gradients. Corresponding values for largest margins (5 mm prostate, 8 mm SV) with a clinical intensity-modulated radiotherapy dose distribution were 46.5% ± 34.7%, 6.7 ± 5.8 Gy, and 1.6% ± 2.3%. For prostate-only clinical target volume, the values were 51.8% ± 17.7%, 3.3 ± 1.6 Gy, and 0.6% ± 0.5% with the smallest margins and 5.2% ± 7.4%, 1.8 ± 0.9 Gy, and 0.1% ± 0.1% for the largest margins. Addition of three-dimensional rotation corrections only improved these values slightly. All rectal planning constraints were met in the actual reconstructed doses for all studied margins.  Conclusion:   We developed a system for margin validation in the presence of deformations. In our population, a 5-mm margin provided sufficient dosimetric coverage for the prostate. In contrast, an 8-mm SV margin was still insufficient owing to deformations.

The PC3/(CIC) cells are more resistant than the PC3/(BC) cells to chemotherapeutic drugs such as docetaxel which is used to treat prostate cancer. Thus these prostate CICs could lay dormant and persist even after chemotherapeutic drug treatment. Then when the chemotherapeutic drug is removed, they could potentially repopulate the original tumor site or metastize to a distant site. However, the prostate CICs were not significantly more resistant to drugs which target EGFR, NF-κB, Smo and the natural product genistein. Interesting the prostate CICs could be rendered more sensitive to docetaxel by inclusion of suboptimal doses of genistein, cyclopamine, and EGFR inhibitors. In contrast, addition of suboptimal amounts of genistein, cyclopamine, or EGFR inhibitors did not increase the sensitivity of the PC/(BC) cells to docetaxel. Similar results were observed when combination experiments were performed with cyclopamine and suboptimal doses of either genistein or docetaxel. The BC cells are usually more rapidly proliferating than the CICs. Thus the CICs are not as sensitive to docetaxel which targets replication. In contrast, the CICs could be rendered sensitive to docetaxel or cyclopamine by co-treatment with certain other drugs, including the natural product genistein which is present in the human diet of many people, especially Asians. Genistein is by itself only weakly toxic to prostate and other cancer cells. That is probably one of the big reasons that it can be used as a dietary supplement for prostate and breast cancers. It is clear from our studies that low doses of genistein can increase the sensitivity of prostate CICs to drugs such as docetaxel and cyclopamine, two drugs either used or under consideration for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['James A McCubrey', 'William H Chappell', 'Stephen L Abrams', 'Richard A Franklin', 'Jacquelyn M Long', 'Jennifer A Sattler', 'C Ruth Kempf', 'Piotr Laidler', 'Linda S Steelman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Adv Enzyme Regul""","""['Targeting the cancer initiating cell: the ultimate target for cancer therapy.', 'Preclinical antitumor activity of the oral platinum analog satraplatin.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Taxol synergizes with antioxidants in inhibiting hormal refractory prostate cancer cell growth.', 'A novel hydroxamic acid compound, BMD188, demonstrates anti-prostate cancer effects by inducing apoptosis.

However, tissue harmonic (H) mode available with new scanners has shown the improved image quality. The aim of this study was to perform a pre-clinical phantom evaluation of harmonic imaging as an alternative to B mode in prostate brachytherapy.  Methods:   Performance characteristics viz. dead zone, depth of penetration, geometric accuracy, spatial resolution, tissue to clutter ratio (TCR) and signal to noise ratio (SNR), were compared between two modes using an in-house phantom. Images were acquired under the same settings except the gain; which is higher for the H mode than that of B mode. A qualitative comparison between two modes was also performed using commercial CIRS053 phantom.  Results:   Dead zone, depth of penetration and geometric accuracy were respectively <1 mm, >8 cm and <1% for both modes. Relative TCR, SNR and the spatial resolution were improved in H mode compared with B mode. Images with CIRS053 phantom in H mode demonstrate sharper boundaries for prostate and urethra, freedom from background clutter, and better identification of the brachytherapy needles.  Conclusions:   This study indicates the superiority of H over B mode, in terms of spatial resolution, relative contrast, and overall image quality. Thus H mode has the potential benefit in prostate brachytherapy.

However, although the results of large RALP series are available, oncologic and functional outcomes as well as complications from low-caseload centres are lacking.  Objective:   To compare perioperative, oncologic, and functional outcomes from two consecutive series of patients with localised prostate cancer treated by retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) or recently established RALP in our hospital, which has a limited caseload.  Design, setting, and participants:   One hundred fifty consecutive patients were enrolled. Their data and outcomes were collected and extensively evaluated.  Intervention:   Seventy-five consecutive patients underwent RRP, and 75 consecutive patients underwent RALP, including all patients of the learning curve.  Measurements:   Patient baseline characteristics, perioperative and postoperative outcomes, and complications were evaluated. End points were oncologic data (positive margins, prostate-specific antigen [PSA]), perioperative complications, urinary continence, and erectile function at 3- and 12-mo follow-up.  Results and limitations:   The preoperative parameters from the two groups were comparable. The positive surgical margin (PSM) rates were 32% for RRP and 16% for RALP (p=0.002). For RRP and RALP, the PSA value was <0.2 ng/ml in 91% and 88% of patients 3 mo postoperatively (p=0.708) and in 87% and 89% of patients 12 mo postoperatively (p=0.36), respectively. Continence rates for RRP and RALP were 83% and 95% at 3-mo follow-up (p=0.003) and 80% and 89% after 12-mo follow-up (p=0.092), respectively. Among patients who were potent without phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-I) before RRP and RALP, recovery of erectile function with and without PDE5-Is was achieved in 25% (12 of 49 patients) and 68% (25 of 37 patients) 3 mo postoperatively (p=0.009) and in 26% (12 of 47 patients) and 55% (12 of 22 patients) 12 mo postoperatively (p=0.009), respectively. Minimal follow-up for RRP was 12 mo; median follow-up for the RALP group was 12 mo (range: 3-12). According to the modified Clavien system, major complication rates for RRP and RALP were 28% and 7% (p=0.025), respectively; minor complication rates were 24% and 35% (p=0.744), respectively.

Fibroblast growth factor 8b (FGF8b) is a mitogenic and angiogenic factor, which is expressed at an increased level in human prostate tumours and is associated with a poor prognosis. We studied the effect of FGF8b on tumour oxygenation and growth parameters in xenografts in comparison with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-expressing xenografts, representing another fast growing and angiogenic tumour model.  Methods:   Subcutaneous tumours of PC-3 cells transfected with FGF8b, VEGF or empty (mock) vectors were produced and studied for vascularity, cell proliferation, glucose metabolism and oxygenation. Tumours were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry, use of radiolabelled markers of energy metabolism ([18F]FDG) and hypoxia ([18F]EF5), and intratumoral polarographic measurements of pO2.  Results:   Both FGF8b and VEGF tumours grew rapidly in nude mice and showed highly vascularised morphology. Perfusion studies, pO2 measurements, [18F]EF5 and [18F]FDG uptake as well as IHC staining for glucose transport protein (GLUT1) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1 showed that VEGF xenografts were well-perfused and oxygenised, as expected, whereas FGF8b tumours were as hypoxic as mock tumours. These results suggest that FGF8b-induced tumour capillaries are defective. Nevertheless, the growth rate of hypoxic FGF8b tumours was highly increased, as that of well-oxygenised VEGF tumours, when compared with hypoxic mock tumour controls.

Material and methods:   This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of three novel tissue biomarkers for PC found through a search in the Human Protein Atlas database ( www.proteinatlas.com ): somatic cytochrome c (CYCS), intestinal cell kinase (ICK) and inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase subunit beta (IKBKB), and compared the results with AMACR. A tissue microarray was constructed from 40 consecutive radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens including benign prostatic tissue, atrophy, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and PC. Immunoreactivity was scored based on staining intensity and extent. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on malignant and benign frozen tissue samples from 32 RP specimens.  Results:   All four biomarkers showed a stronger expression in PC and HGPIN than in benign tissue (p < 0.001). The highest diagnostic accuracy for PC was achieved with ICK and AMACR at 97%. The area under the curve for CYCS, ICK, IKBKB and AMACR was 0.859, 0.997, 0.865 and 0.983, respectively. The presence of mRNA transcripts of the genes was confirmed by real-time PCR in benign and malignant prostatic tissue.  Conclusions:   AMACR is an accurate diagnostic tissue marker for PC.

In this study, we investigated the use of urine microscopy and cytological examination for early detection of bladder cancer in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).  Methods:   Male patients presented with LUTS to urology clinic were enrolled. Voiding symptoms were evaluated with international prostate symptoms score, and urine samples were collected for microscopy and cytological examination. Cystoscopy was performed in patients with microscopic hematuria, suspicious/malignant cells in urine or at the time of transurethral resection of prostate. Subjects, who had no indication and did not receive cystoscopy, were followed up in clinic for progress of symptoms, including gross hematuria and occurrence of bladder cancer.  Results:   Nine hundred and eighty-eight patients were enrolled during the period of 2005-2007. Fifty-two (5.26%) urine samples were documented as atypical, and 936 (94.7%) were negative. There was no suspicious or malignant cytology result in this series. Micro-hematuria was noticed in six patients (0.61%). The mean follow-up time was 29.1 ± 12.5 months. One (0.10%) patient had bladder cancer 44 months after the first visit in the cohort, who had micro-hematuria, atypical urine cytology, but normal cystoscopy before diagnosis.  Conclusion:   The prevalence rate of bladder cancer in male patients with LUTS is low.

Our aim was to identify the parameters that contribute to the absence of BCR in patients with PSM by performing a multivariate analysis.  Methods:   From a cohort of 1163 patients who underwent open RP over a 6-year period, 69 exhibited PSM. Of the 69, 39 had and 30 did not have a BCR during a 3-year follow-up. The analysis comprised preoperative and postoperative PSA serum levels, age, weight of the prostate, pathology tumor grade, time of BCR, number and location of PSM.  Results:   In the univariate analysis, the weight of prostate was statistically significantly associated with the odds of BCR (P = 0.027, 95% CI 1.00-1.06). Bladder neck and lateral locations of PSM were negatively associated with BCR, without exhibiting statistical significance in the multivariate analysis. Age was negatively associated with the odds of BCR whereas preoperative PSA, stage and Gleason score were positively associated, but did not exhibit statistical significance in both uni- and multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   A low weight prostate, younger age, bladder neck and lateral location of PSM seem to protect patients from having a BCR. On the other hand, preoperative PSA, stage of the disease and Gleason score do contribute to the occurrence of BCR.

TRPM8, a cationic TRP channel activated by cooling and menthol is upregulated in PC. However, the precise role of TRPM8 in PC is still unclear. Some studies hypothesized that TRPM8-mediated transmembrane Ca(2+) fluxes play a key role in cellular proliferation of PC cells. In contrast, other findings suggest that high TRPM8 levels may reduce the metastatic potential of PC cells. A detailed understanding of the response of TRPM8 channels to pharmacological modulators of their activity is relevant when considering potential therapies, targeting this ion channel to treat PC. We characterized the pharmacological and functional properties of native TRPM8 channels in four human prostate cell lines, PNT1A, LNCaP, DU145, and PC3, commonly used as experimental models of PC. PNT1A is a non-tumoral prostate cell line while the other three correspond to different stages of PC. Here, we show that cold- and agonist-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) responses in PC cells are much less sensitive to well-characterized agonists (menthol and icilin) and antagonists (BCTC, clotrimazole, and DD01050) of TRPM8 channels, compared to TRPM8 channels in other tissues, suggesting a different molecular composition and/or spatial organization. In addition, the forced overexpression of human TRPM8 facilitated the trafficking of TRPM8 channels residing in the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, leading to a marked potentiation in the efficacy of the different blockers. These results predict that blockers of canonical TRPM8 channels may be less effective in halting proliferation of PC cells than expected.""","""['Maria Valero', 'Cruz Morenilla-Palao', 'Carlos Belmonte', 'Felix Viana']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Pflugers Arch""","""['Novel role of cold/menthol-sensitive transient receptor potential melastatine family member 8 (TRPM8) in the activation of store-operated channels in LNCaP human prostate cancer epithelial cells.', 'Differential role of the menthol-binding residue Y745 in the antagonism of thermally gated TRPM8 channels.', 'Bidirectional shifts of TRPM8 channel gating by temperature and chemical agents modulate the cold sensitivity of mammalian thermoreceptors.', 'Modulation of thermoreceptor TRPM8 by cooling compounds.', 'TRPM8 biology and medicinal chemistry.', 'Validation of Six Commercial Antibodies for the Detection of Heterologous and Endogenous TRPM8 Ion Channel Expression.', 'Global Trends and Hotspots of Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 Research from 2002 to 2021: A Bibliometric Analysis.', 'Mutations of TRPM8 channels: Unraveling the molecular basis of activation by cold and ligands.', 'TRPM8 as an Anti-Tumoral Target in Prostate Cancer Growth and Metastasis Dissemination.', 'The cation channel TRPM8 influences the differentiation and function of human monocytes.']"""

TNF-α, determined by ELISA assays using culture medium, increased between 5 and 10 fold, 48 h following exposure to radiation, and radiation sensitization was comparable with that observed in cells in which TNF-α was constitutively expressed under cytomegalo viral (CMV) promoter using the plasmid vector (pCMV-TNF-α). This efficiency of induced TNF-α radiation sensitization was also observed in cervix (SW756) and prostate tumor (PC-3) xenograft models. IEX-1-driven TNF-α expression following external radiation exposure resulted in enhanced regression of tumor xenografts as compared with radiation alone. A feasibility of using radioactive Pd-103 seeds with GeneSeeds was further examined using PC-3 xenograft models. The data showed substantial tumor growth suppression following co-implantation with a metal seed containing Pd-103. Taken together, these results show the enhanced effect on tumor regression by treatment with radiation-inducible TNF-α expression in combination with radiation and support for the IEX-1 promoter as a useful regulator for temporal activation of radiation-sensitizing gene expression.""","""['M Jung', 'A Dimtchev', 'A Velena', 'A Dritschilo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Gene Ther""","""['Tumor-specific adenovirus-mediated PUMA gene transfer using the survivin promoter enhances radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Adenoviral TNF-alpha gene therapy and radiation damage tumor vasculature in a human malignant glioma xenograft.', 'Cloning and analysis of human UroplakinII promoter and its application for gene therapy in bladder cancer.', 'IEX-1: an unique protein in regulating apoptosis.', 'Radiation therapy: activation for gene transcription and the development of genetic radiotherapy-therapeutic strategies in oncology.', 'Impact of Systemic Autoimmune Diseases on Treatment Outcomes and Radiation Toxicities in Patients with Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy: A Matched Case-Control Analysis.', 'Assessment of Toxic Effects Associated With Dose-Fractionated Radiotherapy Among Patients With Cancer and Comorbid Collagen Vascular Disease.', 'Stimulating Innate Immunity to Enhance Radiation Therapy-Induced Tumor Control.', 'A local agreement pattern measure based on hazard functions for survival outcomes.', 'A model for cancer-suppressive inflammation.']"""

Methods:   After patients had undergone 6 months of antiandrogen therapy, we investigated the time-course changes in findings obtained from DWI compared to the findings obtained from T(2)-weighted (T(2)W) images, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics.  Results:   The time-course changes in T(2)W images, TRUS, and PSA kinetics following antiandrogen therapy in the present study were consistent with previous reports. In all patients, the posttreatment hypointense signals on DWI were attenuated. Identification of tumor location was difficult on the basis of changes in magnetic resonance imaging findings following antiandrogen therapy due to the remarkable reduction of the total prostatic volume. Three patients exhibited residual tumors that were easily visualized, and apparent diffusion coefficient values increased after treatment in these patients. However, in 1 patient with neuroendocrine differentiation during antiandrogen therapy, DWI findings revealed that the hypointense signal in the prostate became progressively more pronounced. However, this case showed a low PSA recurrence without remarkable changes in the T(2)W images.

Previous studies suggest that IL-6 promotes prostate cancer progression through the induction of an androgen-independent response. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms by which IL-6 regulates the gene expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in human prostate LNCaP carcinoma cells. (3)H-thymidine incorporation assays revealed that IL-6 treatment inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP cells. Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot assays indicated that IL-6 treatment enhanced PSA gene expression. Similar results were found in LNCaP cells that had been engineered to stably overexpress IL-6. Although forced overexpression of c-Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) induced PSA promoter activity, mutation of the MAZ response elements had little effect on IL-6-induced PSA promoter activity. Results from 5'-deletion reporter assays revealed that the effects of IL-6 appear to be mediated via an androgen enhancer region (24801 to 23933), which is dependent on the signal transducer and activator of the transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, and a region located at 2193 to 241 base pairs upstream of the translational initiation site of the human PSA gene, which did not respond to androgen or STAT3. Results of reporter assays, immunoblot assays, and ELISA revealed that the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors 17-allyamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and geldanamycin blocked IL-6-induced PSA gene expression. Those results suggest that IL-6 upregulates PSA gene expression and that Hsp90 plays a novel role in the activation of IL-6 on PSA gene expression in an androgen-independent manner.""","""['Ke-Hung Tsui', 'Yu-Fen Lin', 'Yu-His Chen', 'Phei-Lang Chang', 'Horng-Heng Juang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Androl""","""['Curcumin blocks the activation of androgen and interlukin-6 on prostate-specific antigen expression in human prostatic carcinoma cells.', 'Expression of interleukin-6 is downregulated by 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin in human prostatic carcinoma cells.', 'Constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappaB p50/p65 and Fra-1 and JunD is essential for deregulated interleukin 6 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Inflammation and prostate cancer: the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6).', 'Establishment of human prostate carcinoma skeletal metastasis models.', 'Shmt2: A Stat3 Signaling New Player in Prostate Cancer Energy Metabolism.', '16p11.2 transcription factor MAZ is a dosage-sensitive regulator of genitourinary development.', 'The inhibitory effects of capillarisin on cell proliferation and invasion of prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Elevated expression of ZNF217 promotes prostate cancer growth by restraining ferroportin-conducted iron egress.', 'Ginkgetin inhibits the growth of DU-145 prostate cancer cells through inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activity.']"""

Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has the potential to reduce toxicity by limiting the radiation dose received by the bowel and bladder. The present study compared the genitourinary and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in men treated with 3D-CRT+AD vs. IMRT+AD.  Methods and materials:   Between July 1992 and July 2004, 293 men underwent 3D-CRT (n = 170) or IMRT (n = 123) with concurrent AD (<6 months, n = 123; ≥6 months, n = 170). The median radiation dose was 76 Gy for 3D-CRT (International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements) and 76 Gy for IMRT (95% to the planning target volume). Toxicity was assessed by a patient symptom questionnaire that was completed at each visit and recorded using a Fox Chase Modified Late Effects Normal Tissue Task radiation morbidity scale.  Results:   The mean follow-up was 86 months (standard deviation, 29.3) for the 3D-CRT group and 40 months (standard deviation, 9.7) for the IMRT group. Acute GI toxicity (odds ratio, 4; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-11.7; p = .005) was significantly greater with 3D-CRT than with IMRT and was independent of the AD duration (i.e., <6 vs. ≥6 months). The interval to the development of late GI toxicity was significantly longer in the IMRT group. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate for Grade 2 or greater GI toxicity was 20% for 3D-CRT and 8% for IMRT (p = .01). On multivariate analysis, Grade 2 or greater late GI toxicity (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.3; p = .04) was more prevalent in the 3D-CRT patients.

To identify the mechanisms underlying the activation of prostate cancer cells by resistin.  Materials and methods:   Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining were performed to investigate the intensity of prostate epithelial resistin expression. Human full-length resistin gene (RETN) was transfected into the PC-3 cells using the pEGFP-N1 vector to assess the effect of overexpression of resistin in prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Various concentrations of human recombinant protein resistin were added to the hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145 for 48 h, and cell proliferation was assessed by a water-soluble tetrazolium salt assay.  Results:   Human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145 were found to express the human resistin mRNA. Resistin protein was strongly detected in high-grade prostate cancer tissue, whereas BPH or low-grade prostate cancer tissue revealed fainter expression of resistin. Cell proliferation was stimulated by both the full-length resistin gene overexpression and resistin treatment. Akt phosphorylation occurred after addition of resistin to PC-3 and DU-145 cells.

Patients and methods:   • The cohort included 3,525 patients aged ≥ 75 years with two or more PSA tests before a diagnosis of PCa. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate which variables at time of last PSA measurement were associated with death from PCa. • The rates of death from PCa after diagnosis in different PSA velocity groups were calculated.

Results:   • On multivariate analysis, men with a PSA velocity of PSA velocity ≥ 0.45 ng/mL/year had a 4.8-fold higher risk of death from PCa as compared to men with a PSA velocity of < 0.45 ng/mL/year (p value = 0.013). After a median 6.5 (up to 16.9) years of follow-up from diagnosis, 1.4% of the men with a PSA velocity < 0.45 ng/mL/year had died of PCa as compared to 8.7% of those with a PSA velocity ≥ 0.45 ng/mL/year. • The cumulative rate of death from PCa after diagnosis, stratified by a PSA velocity of 0.45 ng/mL/year, was statistically different (log rank test, P < 0.001).

Level of evidence:   4. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Nowadays more and more publications have been published about the topic prostate cancer aggressiveness and obesity with mixed results. However, most of the publications used the BMI as a marker for obesity, while the most metabolic active fat is the visceral fat. To learn more about these relations we measured and used the visceral fat in our paper.  Objective:   To examine if the periprostatic fat measured on computed tomography (CT) correlates with advanced disease we examined patients who received radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. Several USA reports found a positive association between obesity and prostate cancer aggressiveness. However, in recent European studies these conclusions were not confirmed. Studies concerning this issue have basically relied on body mass index (BMI), as a marker of general obesity. Visceral fat, however, is the most metabolically active and best measured on CT.  Patients and methods:   In 932 patients, who were treated with external radiotherapy (N=311) or brachytherapy (N=621) for their T1-3N0M0 prostate cancer, different fat measurements (periprostatic fat, subcutaneous fat thickness) were performed on a CT. Associations between the different fat measurements and risk of having high-risk (according to Ash et al., PSA>20 or Gleason score≥8 or T3) disease was measured.  Results:   The median age (IQR) was 67.0 years (62.0-71.0) and median BMI (IQR) was 25.8 (24.2-28.3). Logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, revealed a significant association between periprostatic fat density (PFD) and risk of having a high risk disease.

The case described herein is that of a woman with a missense mutation that results in the substitution of isoleucine for threonine at position 157. This variant of the mutation doubles the risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma two times and causes up to 9% of these cancer.

The screening procedures were initiated in a carrier who revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma. Genetic screening of the family diagnosed her daughter as the carrier of this mutation. Until now no active cancer disease has been recognized in the daughter. On the example of the presented case we discuss indications for screening in cases of positive family history.

Knockout of the miR processing enzyme, DICER, in LNCaP prostate cancer cells or tissue specifically in mice inhibited AR function leading to AIS. Since the only function of miRs is to bind to 3' UTR and inhibit translation of target genes, androgens might induce miRs to inhibit repressors of AR function. In concordance, knock-down of DICER in LNCaP cells and in tissues in mice induced the expression of corepressors, NCoR and SMRT.

What remains unclear is why this pain frequently becomes more severe and difficult to control with disease progression. Here we test the hypothesis that with disease progression, sensory nerve fibers that innervate the tumor-bearing tissue undergo a pathological sprouting and reorganization, which in other nonmalignant pathologies has been shown to generate and maintain chronic pain. Injection of canine prostate cancer cells into mouse bone induces a remarkable sprouting of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP(+)) and neurofilament 200 kDa (NF200(+)) sensory nerve fibers. Nearly all sensory nerve fibers that undergo sprouting also coexpress tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA(+)). This ectopic sprouting occurs in sensory nerve fibers that are in close proximity to colonies of prostate cancer cells, tumor-associated stromal cells and newly formed woven bone, which together form sclerotic lesions that closely mirror the osteoblastic bone lesions induced by metastatic prostate tumors in humans. Preventive treatment with an antibody that sequesters nerve growth factor (NGF), administered when the pain and bone remodeling were first observed, blocks this ectopic sprouting and attenuates cancer pain. Interestingly, reverse transcription PCR analysis indicated that the prostate cancer cells themselves do not express detectable levels of mRNA coding for NGF. This suggests that the tumor-associated stromal cells express and release NGF, which drives the pathological reorganization of nearby TrkA(+) sensory nerve fibers. Therapies that prevent this reorganization of sensory nerve fibers may provide insight into the evolving mechanisms that drive cancer pain and lead to more effective control of this chronic pain state.""","""['Juan M Jimenez-Andrade', 'Aaron P Bloom', 'James I Stake', 'William G Mantyh', 'Reid N Taylor', 'Katie T Freeman', 'Joseph R Ghilardi', 'Michael A Kuskowski', 'Patrick W Mantyh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Neurosci""","""['Breast cancer-induced bone remodeling, skeletal pain, and sprouting of sensory nerve fibers.', 'The majority of myelinated and unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers that innervate bone express the tropomyosin receptor kinase A.', 'A blocking antibody to nerve growth factor attenuates skeletal pain induced by prostate tumor cells growing in bone.', 'Involvement of acidic microenvironment in the pathophysiology of cancer-associated bone pain.', 'Bone cancer pain: causes, consequences, and therapeutic opportunities.', 'The acid-sensing nociceptor TRPV1 controls breast cancer progression in bone via regulating HGF secretion from sensory neurons.', 'The neural addiction of cancer.', 'Cancer-nerve interplay in cancer progression and cancer-induced bone pain.', 'Axon Guidance Molecules and Pain.', 'Activation of GDNF-ERK-Runx1 signaling contributes to P2X3R gene transcription and bone cancer pain.']"""

However, its function and implication in malignancies remain largely unknown. The present study aimed to examine the role of Ehm2 in breast cancer. We first constructed a hammerhead ribozyme transgene to knock down Ehm2 expression in breast cancer cells. The effect on growth, cell matrix adhesion, motility, and invasion following knockdown of Ehm2 was then investigated using in vitro models. Reduction of Ehm2 had inhibitory effects on in vitro growth and invasion of breast cancer cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that knockdown of Ehm2 induced apoptosis. Knockdown of Ehm2 also significantly decreased matrix metalloproteinase 9 mRNA and protein levels, as well as the corresponding enzymatic activity, and consequently led to a reduction of the invasion. The expression pattern of Ehm2 in a cohort of breast specimens (normal, n = 33; cancer, n = 127) was analyzed using both quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Increased expression of Ehm2 in breast cancer was seen at both mRNA and protein levels. Higher levels of Ehm2 transcripts were correlated with disease progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Disease-free survival of the patients with lower levels of Ehm2 was 135.8 (95% confidence interval, 125.1-146.5) months, significantly longer compared with 102.5 (95% confidence interval, 78.7-126.4) months of patients with higher levels of Ehm2 expression (P = 0.039).

Their dysregulation has been implicated in a variety of cancers. Previously, we showed that a subset of genes of the HOXC cluster is upregulated in primary prostate tumors, lymph node metastases, and malignant prostate cell lines. In the present study, we show that HOXC8 inhibits androgen receptor (AR)-mediated gene induction in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and HPr-1 AR, a nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line. Mechanistically, HOXC8 blocks the AR-dependent recruitment of the steroid receptor coactivators steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), and CREB binding protein to the androgen-regulated prostate-specific antigen gene enhancer and inhibits histone acetylation of androgen-regulated genes. Inhibition of androgen induction by HOXC8 is reversed upon expression of SRC-3, a member of the SRC/p160 steroid receptor cofactor family. Coimmunoprecipitation studies show that HOXC8 expression inhibits the hormone-dependent interaction of AR and SRC-3. Finally, HOXC8 expression increases invasion in HPr-1 AR nontumorigenic cells. These data suggest a complex role for HOXC8 in prostate cancer, promoting invasiveness while inhibiting AR-mediated gene induction at androgen response element-regulated genes associated with differentiated function of the prostate.

The specificity of PSA to indicate men with biopsy detectable prostate cancer can be improved by adding information obtained by new biomarkers, such as PSA isoforms. This improvement is needed to increase the efficacy of the screening procedure for the population-based as well as the individual screening. Various PSA isoforms, kallikreins and molecular markers have been validated in various cohorts from ERSPC of men with and without PCa in order to design the optimal diagnostic procedure for screening asymptomatic men. So far, most promising results have been obtained from the analysis of free PSA, proPSA, nicked PSA and hK2. The use of free PSA in addition to total PSA reduces the number of negative sextant biopsies at a PSA cut-off level of 3 ng/ml at initial screening with 30%, at the cost of losing 10% of detectable cancers that are predominantly well differentiated on histology. Further addition of PSA isoforms and hK2 only improve ROC curves in selected samples by a maximum of 5%. Molecular markers like PCA3 and TMPRSS2 in urine do not appear to be useful but they have been assessed insufficiently so far. The level of PSA at initial screening is highly predictive for the chance of being diagnosed with PCa later on in life. The changes in PSA over time after initial screening (like PSA-velocity and PSA-doubling time) are statistically different between men with detectable cancers versus those without (PSA-doubling time 5.1 versus 6.1 years), but this does not contribute significantly to population-based screening overall.

A sufficiently long lead-time needs to be achieved so that cancer can be detected while still curable. A very short lead-time may indicate poor sensitivity of the screening test, while a very long lead-time suggests overdiagnosis.  Material and methods:   In the first screening round, a total of 56,294 men aged 55-74 years were screened with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in five countries of the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) with an overall detection rate (prevalence) of 2.8% (1972 prostate cancers). Prostate cancer incidence among 92,142 men randomly allocated to the control arm of the trial was also assessed. Lead-time was estimated as the time required to accumulate a similar cumulative risk of prostate cancer in the control arm to the detection rate in the intervention arm, i.e. from the ratio of detection rate (prevalence of screen-detected cases) and expected incidence (cumulative risk).  Results:   Using a serum PSA cut-off of 4 ng/ml, the mean lead-time in the whole study population was estimated as 6.8 years (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 7.9-8.4). It was 8 years in The Netherlands, 6 in Sweden and Finland, 5 in Italy and 4 in Belgium. The mean lead-time was similar, 6-7 years, at ages 50-64 years, but close to 8 years among men aged 65-74 years. A lower PSA cut-off level of 3 ng/ml used in Sweden and The Netherlands prolonged the mean lead-time by approximately 1 year. Lead-time based on advanced prostate cancer only was slightly shorter, mean 5.3 years (95% CI 4.6-6.0). The lead-time for the second screening round was slightly shorter than that for the first (5.9, 95% CI 5.4-6.4), reflecting a similar relation between detection rate and control group incidence.  Conclusion:   The lead-time for prostate cancer found in ERSPC substantially exceeded that found for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening. One round of prostate cancer screening can advance clinical diagnosis by 4-8 years. Overdiagnosis or detection of non-progressive tumours may contribute substantially to the lead-time.""","""['Patrik Finne', 'Mahdi Fallah', 'Matti Hakama', 'Stefano Ciatto', 'Jonas Hugosson', 'Harry de Koning', 'Sue Moss', 'Vera Nelen', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Why are a high overdiagnosis probability and a long lead time for prostate cancer screening so important?', 'Detection rates of cancer, high grade PIN and atypical lesions suspicious for cancer in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'PSA levels and cancer detection rate by centre in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Epilogue: different approaches for prostate cancer screening in the EU?', 'Diagnostic Age, Age at Death and Stage Migration in Men Dying with or from Prostate Cancer in Denmark.', 'Use of Warfarin or Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Risk of Prostate Cancer in PCBaSe: A Nationwide Case-Control Study.', 'The Value of a New Diagnostic Test for Prostate Cancer: A Cost-Utility Analysis in Early Stage of Development.', 'Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and systemic immune-inflammation index versus circulating prostate cells to predict significant prostate cancer at first biopsy.', 'Geographic-Level Association of Contemporary Changes in Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer Incidence in the Era of Decreasing PSA Screening.']"""

Per material 2 of the authors assessed independently from each other whether standardised pre-defined topics were addressed, whether the content was correct and which approach was taken towards the decision-making process about uptake.  Results:   Twenty-three materials were included, of which 11 were released (shortly) after the results of 2 large randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of screening for prostate cancer had been published in March 2009. That a PSA-test result can be abnormal because of non-cancerous conditions (false positive) and that it may miss prostate cancer (false negative) was not addressed in 2/23 and 8/23 materials, respectively. The risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment was not mentioned in 6 out of 23. PSA-screening was presented as a usual thing to do in some materials, whereas other materials emphasised the voluntary nature of PSA-screening ('it is your decision'). The content of 19/23 materials was considered sufficiently informative according to the pre-defined criteria, 12/23 materials were considered supportive of informed decision-making by men.  Conclusions:   Most materials of not-for-profit organizations supplied adequate information about PSA-screening, whilst the degree of persuasion towards uptake reflected variations in opinions on men's autonomy regarding their own health.""","""['Ida J Korfage', 'Roderick C N van den Bergh', 'Marie-Louise Essink-Bot']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Difference in willingness-to-pay for prostate cancer screening between ill-informed and well-informed men: a contingent valuation survey.', 'Informed decision making on PSA testing for the detection of prostate cancer: an evaluation of a leaflet with risk indicator.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: are patients making informed decisions?', 'Prostate-specific antigen testing and prostate cancer screening.', 'American Cancer Society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010.', 'Systematic evaluation of written health information on PSA based screening in Germany.', 'Informed decision-making based on a leaflet in the context of prostate cancer screening.', 'Low health literacy and evaluation of online health information: a systematic review of the literature.', 'PSA-based prostate cancer screening: the role of active surveillance and informed and shared decision making.']"""

The incidence and predictive value of high grade PIN and LSPC for prostate cancer in subsequent biopsy following these diagnoses were evaluated.  Patients and methods:   Study group consisted of 56,653 screened men in the ERSPC centres of Finland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, who underwent 3-7 screening rounds at 2-4 year interval. Data for prostate cancer were obtained from the ERSPC central database. Data for high grade PIN and LSPC were gathered from each ERSPC centre. Detection rates of subsequent prostate cancer in the first re-biopsy after these diagnoses were determined.  Results:   The average cancer detection rate was 3.5%, 3.2% and 3.5% for the completed rounds 1, 2 and 3, respectively, in all five centres. Incidence of high grade PIN increased from 1.5% in the first round to 5.0% in the third round, varying among centres in the first round between 0.8% and 7.6%. The cancer detection rate in the first re-biopsy after the diagnosis of high grade PIN was 12.9%. Incidence of LSPC was 2.4%, 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% in the first, second, third and fourth round, respectively. The cancer detection rate at the first re-biopsy after the diagnosis of LSPC was in average 33.8%.  Conclusions:   Cancer detection rate was stable during the three screening rounds. The wide variation in frequency in particular of high grade PIN among the ERSPC centres suggests a considerable inter-observer variation. The average comparatively low detection rate of isolated high grade PIN in the first screening round may be screening-related, while its consistent increase during three screening rounds could be the consequence of a.o. previous screening and ageing of the population. The observed low risk of prostate cancer after isolated high grade PIN in this screening setting is in line with the current recommendation to abstain from early repeat biopsies after this diagnosis. The association of LSPC with high incidence of prostate cancer in re-biopsies confirms the need for early repeat biopsies and follow-up of these men. The low percentage of LSPC (<3% of biopsies) throughout all rounds is reassuring as it limits the biopsy burden in a screening setting.""","""['M Laurila', 'T van der Kwast', 'L Bubendorf', 'S di Lollo', 'C-G Pihl', 'S Ciatto', 'J Hugosson', 'L Määttänen', 'M J Roobol', 'P M Kujala']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Lesions predictive for prostate cancer in a screened population: first and second screening round findings.', 'PSA levels and cancer detection rate by centre in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Do prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density enhance the detection of prostate carcinoma after initial diagnosis of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without concurrent carcinoma?', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Interobserver Variability in the Diagnosis of High-Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia in a Tertiary Hospital in Northern Jordan.', 'Atypical Small Acinar Proliferation and High Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia: Should We Be Concerned?

Methods:   Individual data on men invited for the first and second screening rounds according to protocol (excluding early recalls and interval cancers) were obtained from the central database of the ERSPC (cut-off date 31st December 2006). Data were compared between and within centres for the core age group (55-69 at entry). The cancer detection rate (CDR) was compared with the expected background prostate cancer incidence rate in the absence of screening adjusted for the incidence rate in non-attenders and the control arm (IRS).  Results:   Mean PSA values in the age groups 55-59 years and 65-69 years showed little variation by centre, except for the Dutch centre, where an increase from 1.6 to 1.8 ng/ml and a decline from 2.9 to 2.5ng/ml was observed, respectively. Most tumours were detected at the PSA range 4.0-9.9 ng/ml, with a shift to more cancer detection at 3.0-3.9 ng/ml in the second screening round. There was high variability in the CDR between the centres in both the first (16-46 per 1000) and the second screening rounds (14-50 per 1000). Although the ratio CDR/IRS was less variable, it is somewhat lower in Italy and Switzerland (12 and 14,respectively) and higher in the Netherlands (28), than in most other centres and in Belgium the ratio increased markedly, from 20 to 44 between the first and second rounds.

Incidence has been uniformly increasing in the 24 countries with comparable data available, although in a few countries with very high rates (Sweden, Finland and The Netherlands), incidence has begun to fall during the last 3-4 years. The highest prostate cancer mortality rates are in the Baltic region (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Prostate cancer mortality has been decreasing in 13 of the 37 European countries considered - predominantly in higher-resource countries within each region - beginning in England and Wales (1992) and more recently in the Czech Republic (2004). There was considerable variability in the magnitude of the annual declines, varying from approximately 1% in Scotland (from 1994) to over 4% for the more recent declines in Hungary, France and the Czech Republic. There appears little relation between the extent of the increases in incidence (in the late 1990s) and the recent mortality declines. It remains unclear to what extent the increasing trends in incidence indicate true risk and how much is due to detection of latent disease. The decreasing mortality after 1990 may be attributable to improvements in treatment and to an effect of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. The increase in mortality observed in the Baltic region and in several Central and Eastern European countries appear to reflect a real increase in risk and requires further monitoring.""","""['F Bray', 'J Lortet-Tieulent', 'J Ferlay', 'D Forman', 'A Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Interpreting trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality in the five Nordic countries.', 'Trends in survival of patients diagnosed with male genital cancers in the Nordic countries 1964-2003 followed up until the end of 2006.', 'The changing pattern of kidney cancer incidence and mortality in Europe.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Changing demography of prostate cancer in Asia.', 'Use of Prospective Multiplex Immunohistochemistry to Redefine Tissue Pathways of Diagnostic Core Biopsy of Prostate.', 'Narrative review of Mediterranean diet in Cilento: longevity and potential prevention for prostate cancer.', 'Acute urinary retention and risk of cancer: population based Danish cohort study.', 'The European cancer burden in 2020: Incidence and mortality estimates for 40 countries and 25 major cancers.', 'Early detection of prostate cancer in firefighters: a register-based study of prognostic factors and survival.']"""

Noscapine inhibits tumor growth in nude mice bearing human xenografts of hematopoietic, breast, lung, ovarian, brain and prostate origin. Despite its nontoxic attributes, significant elimination of the disease has not been achieved, perhaps since the bioavailability of noscapine to tumors saturates at an oral dose of 300 mg/kg body weight. To enable the selective and specific delivery of noscapine to prostate cancer cells, we have engineered a multifunctional nanoscale delivery vehicle that takes advantage of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) overexpression in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate epithelia and can be tracked by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and near-infrared (NIR) imaging. Specifically, we employed the human-type 135 amino-acid amino-terminal fragment (hATF) of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a high-affinity natural ligand for uPAR. Noscapine (Nos) was efficiently adsorbed onto the amphiphilic polymer coating of uPAR-targeted nanoparticles (NPs). Nos-loaded NPs were uniformly compact-sized, stable at physiological pH and efficiently released the drug at pH 4 to 5 within a span of 4h. Our results demonstrate that these uPAR-targeted NPs were capable of binding to the receptor and were internalized by PC-3 cells. uPAR-targeted Nos-loaded NPs enhanced intracellular noscapine accumulation as evident by the ~6-fold stronger inhibitory effect on PC-3 growth compared to free noscapine. In addition, Nos-loaded iron oxide NPs maintained their T2 MRI contrast effect upon internalization into tumor cells owing to their significant susceptibility effect in cells. Thus, our data provide compelling evidence that these optically and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-trackable uPAR-targeted NPs may offer a great potential for image-directed targeted delivery of noscapine for the management of prostate cancer.""","""['Mohamed O Abdalla', 'Prasanthi Karna', 'Hari Krishna Sajja', 'Hui Mao', 'Clayton Yates', 'Timothy Turner', 'Ritu Aneja']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['Enhanced noscapine delivery using estrogen-receptor-targeted nanoparticles for breast cancer therapy.', 'Implications of nanoscale based drug delivery systems in delivery and targeting tubulin binding agent, noscapine in cancer cells.', 'Double-receptor-targeting multifunctional iron oxide nanoparticles drug delivery system for the treatment and imaging of prostate cancer.', 'uPAR-targeted optical imaging contrasts as theranostic agents for tumor margin detection.', 'uPAR as anti-cancer target: evaluation of biomarker potential, histological localization, and antibody-based therapy.', 'Reports of Plant-Derived Nanoparticles for Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Therapeutic Strategies Targeting Urokinase and Its Receptor in Cancer.', 'The Urokinase Receptor (uPAR) as a ""Trojan Horse"" in Targeted Cancer Therapy: Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Side-by-Side Comparison of uPAR-Targeting Optical Imaging Antibodies and Antibody Fragments for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery of Solid Tumors.', 'The Urokinase Receptor: A Multifunctional Receptor in Cancer Cell Biology.

We hypothesized that these reductions would lead to decreases in the use of ADT for indications that were not evidence based.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare database, we identified 54,925 men who received a diagnosis of incident prostate cancer from 2003 through 2005. We divided these men into groups according to the strength of the indication for ADT use. The use of ADT was deemed to be inappropriate as primary therapy for men with localized cancers of a low-to-moderate grade (for whom a survival benefit of such therapy was improbable), appropriate as adjuvant therapy with radiation therapy for men with locally advanced cancers (for whom a survival benefit was established), and discretionary for men receiving either primary or adjuvant therapy for localized but high-grade tumors. The proportion of men receiving ADT was calculated according to the year of diagnosis for each group. We used modified Poisson regression models to calculate the effect of the year of diagnosis on the use of ADT.  Results:   The rate of inappropriate use of ADT declined substantially during the study period, from 38.7% in 2003 to 30.6% in 2004 to 25.7% in 2005 (odds ratio for ADT use in 2005 vs. 2003, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.79). There was no decrease in the appropriate use of adjuvant ADT (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.19). In cases involving discretionary use, there was a significant decline in use in 2005 but not in 2004.  Conclusions:   Changes in the Medicare reimbursement policy in 2004 and 2005 were associated with reductions in ADT use, particularly among men for whom the benefits of such therapy were unclear.

Methods:   Baseline differences by coping style are presented for 628 breast and prostate cancer survivors who participated in the FRESH START trial, along with multivariable analyses on rates of uptake by coping style and arm assignment for those completing the 2-year trial.  Results:   At baseline, several differences were observed between fighting-spirits and fatalists, with the former significantly more likely to be white, younger, leaner, more-educated and at risk for depression, and less likely to consume 5+fruits and vegetables (F&V)/day (p-values<0.05). Improvements in physical activity were observed, with fighting-spirits exhibiting the greatest gains from baseline to Year-1, regardless of intervention type; but by Year-2, these differences diminished as fatalists gained ground. Moreover, fatalists who received standardized intervention material also charted steady improvements in F&V intake over the study period; by Year-2, 58.1% of fatalists achieved the 5-a-day goal vs 44.6% of fighting-spirits (p-value<0.05).

The stromal microenvironment at these sites is reactive and typified by altered phenotype, matrix deposition, inflammatory responses, and alterations in nerve density and biology. TGF-β1 is known to modulate several stromal responses; however there are few transgenic models to study its integrated biology. To address the actions of TGF-β1 in prostate disorders, we targeted expression of an epitope tagged and constitutively active TGF-β1 via the enhanced probasin promoter to the murine prostate gland epithelium. Transgenic mice developed age-dependent lesions leading to severe, yet focal attenuation of epithelium, and a discontinuous basal lamina. These changes were associated with elevated fibroplasia and frequency of collagenous micronodules in collapsed acini, along with an induced inflammation in nerve ganglia and small vessels. Elevated recruitment of CD115+ myeloid cells but not mature macrophages was observed in nerve ganglia, also in an age-dependent manner. Similar phenotypic changes were observed using a human prostate epithelium tissue recombination xenograft model, where epithelial cells engineered to overexpress TGF-β1 induced fibrosis and altered matrix deposition concurrent with inflammation in the stromal compartment. Together, these data suggest that elevated TGF-β1 expression induces a fibroplasia stromal response associated with breach of epithelial wall structure and inflammatory involvement of nerve ganglia and vessels. The novel findings of ganglia and vessel inflammation associated with formation of collagenous micronodules in collapsed acini is important as each of these are observed in human prostate carcinoma and may play a role in disease progression.""","""['David A Barron', 'Douglas W Strand', 'Steven J Ressler', 'Truong D Dang', 'Simon W Hayward', 'Feng Yang', 'Gustavo E Ayala', 'Michael Ittmann', 'David R Rowley']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Retroviral transduction of transforming growth factor-beta1 induces pleiotropic benign prostatic growth abnormalities in mouse prostate reconstitutions.', 'Promotion of angiogenesis by ps20 in the differential reactive stroma prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Keratinocyte-derived chemokine induces prostate epithelial hyperplasia and reactive stroma in a novel transgenic mouse model.', 'Reactive stroma in human prostate cancer: induction of myofibroblast phenotype and extracellular matrix remodeling.', 'Role of transforming growth factor-beta1 in prostate cancer.', '""Stromal cells in prostate cancer pathobiology: friends or foes?"".', 'The IL-4/IL-13 signaling axis promotes prostatic fibrosis.', 'RNA sequencing and integrative analysis reveal pathways and hub genes associated with TGFβ1 stimulation on prostatic stromal cells.', 'Elevated expression of the colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia dependent of epithelial-Gp130.', 'Natural Products for the Management of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Special Focus on Nanoparticles Based Studies.']"""

They appear to serve in a dual role. This includes the early recognition of these immunogenic membrane proteins that can serve as diagnostic markers, and the targeting of such markers for the destruction of the tumor, primarily thru ADCC.The monoclonals (mAbs) that we have developed against specific immunogenic tumor membrane proteins have been studied in detail. These tumor proteins, when first defined, were referred to as tumor associated antigens. With the ability of the mAbs to demonstrate therapeutic antitumor activity in those patients with relatively advanced malignancies, the term tumor specific was introduced. Monoclonals that we were able to develop from tumor specific proteins derived from colon and pancreas cancer were found capable of targeting those tumors to induce apoptosis. We were also able to define immunogenic membrane proteins from lung (squamous and adenoCa) as well as prostate neoplasms. Monoclonals developed from these tumor antigens are in the initial phases of investigation with regard to their specificity and antitumor activity.Mabs capable of targeting the malignancies noted above were produced following immunization of BALBc mice with the Tumor Specific Antigens. The hybridomas that were screened and found to express the antibodies of interest appeared for the most part as IgG2a's. It became apparent after a short period of time that stability of the Fab CDR loops as well as the therapeutic efficacy of the hybridoma mAbs could be lost. Stability was achieved by chimerization and or humanization. The resulting mAbs were found to switch their isotypes to an IgG1 subsequent to chimerization and or humanization, when expressed in CHO cells. The monoclonals, so produced, were not only more efficient in controlling tumor growth but minimized the development of a HAMA response.Because of 1) the specificity of this group of monoclonal antibodies in targeting well defined immunogenic proteins that were expressed on the tumor cell membrane,2) their lack of cross reactivity to normal tissue, 3) relatively low toxicity when delivered intravenously, 4) rapid targeting of tumor cell populations (4-6 hrs in vitro) and their 5) ability to destroy xenograft transplants (in vivo) within days of delivery, these mAbs were felt to be ideal for possible use in the treatment of patients with recurrent and or metastatic tumors.Initial clinical studies have been planned for following the filing of an IND. It is required by FDA that the potential effects of tumor control and toxicity be defined using the naked antibodies produced under GMP conditions, In those situations where patients with recurrent malignancies are to be studied we have come to realize that a number of factors can influence the response to monoclonal therapy. This includes the amount of shed antigen in the serum at the time of treatment that could initiate immune complex formation as well as the shedding of inhibitory material into the serum possibly effecting an immune response. As such we plan to eventually employ the therapeutic mAbs in combination with chemotherapy as a means of enhancing the immunogenicity of the tumor system being treated and to possibly weaken the malignant growth for easier destruction by the mAb. We will also look at the combination of mAbs with immunostimulants such as GMCSF and IL-2 (fusion proteins) and eventual conjugation of the mAbs with alpha and possibly B-emitters to help in targeting bystander cells.

There has been renewed interest in the potential therapeutic benefits of statins for cancer. Simvastatin, a widely used generic drug for preventing cardiovascular events, is well known for its effects on cellular proliferation and inflammation, two key processes that also determine the rate of tumor growth. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that statins have the potential to reduce the risk of many cancers, there are discrepancies over the pro- and anticancer effects of statins. In the current study, we sought to investigate the effects of simvastatin on the Akt pathway in prostate cancer cells with respect to the regulation of various cell functions in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Time- and dose-dependent effects of simvastatin on LNCaP (androgen-dependent) and PC3 (androgen-independent) cells indicate that treatment with simvastatin at concentrations as low as 25 μM was sufficient to inhibit serum-stimulated Akt activity. Akin to this, treatment with simvastatin significantly inhibited serum-induced cell migration, invasion, colony formation, and proliferation. Simvastatin-mediated effects on colony formation were rescued by adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active Akt (myristoylated Akt) in PC3 cell lines. A PC3 xenograft model performed in nude mice exhibited reduced tumor growth with simvastatin treatment associated with decreased Akt activity and reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.

The purpose of this study is to summarize long-term trends in the cancer burden and to provide up-to-date estimates of incidence and mortality rates from 2007.  Material and methods:   The Czech National Cancer Registry (CNCR) was instituted in 1977 and contains information over a 30-year period of standardized registration covering 100% of cancer diagnoses and the entire Czech population. The analysis of CNCR is supported by demographic data of the Czech Republic and by the Death Records Database as civil registration systems. The epidemiology of malignant tumours in the Czech population is available online at www.svod.cz.  Results:   All neoplasms, including non-melanoma skin cancer, reached a crude incidence rate of almost 736 cases per 100,000 men and 648 cases per 100,000 women in 2007. The annual mortality rate exceeded 263 deaths per 100,000 population; each year, more than 27,000 persons die of cancer. The overall incidence of malignancies has increased during the last decade with growth index + 26.4% (1997-2007) while the mortality rate has stabilized over this time span (growth index in 1977-2007: -2.5%). Consequently, the prevalence has significantly increased in the registration period and in 2007 it exceeded 400,000 cases. In addition to the demographic ageing of the Czech population, the cancer burden is increased by the growing incidence of multiple primary tumours (recently more than 11% of the total incidence). The most frequent diagnoses include colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer. Although some neoplasms are increasingly diagnosed at an early stage (e.g. proportion of stage I + II in female breast cancer: 71.9%, skin melanoma: 81.3%), in general early diagnostics is insufficient in the Czech Republic. This is the case even for highly prevalent colorectal carcinoma (only 43.2% of incident cases recently diagnosed at stage I or II).  Conclusion:   The Czech Republic is well equipped with high-quality and functional facilities for collecting and analysing population-based data on malignant tumours. The data survey has enabled the priorities of cancer management in the Czech Republic to be defined. This will undoubtedly lead to a sustained reduction in late diagnosed cases and a reduction in the remarkable regional differences in diagnostic efficiency.""","""['L Dusek', 'J Muzík', 'E Gelnarová', 'J Fínek', 'R Vyzula', 'J Abrahámová']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Klin Onkol""","""['Trends in lung cancer mortality in the Czech Republic 1950-1995 and predictions up to the year 2009.', 'The incidence of cancer in the Czech Republic from 1973 to 1989: cancers with non-parallel trends in age groups.', 'Notified cases of imported transmisssible infections in the Czech Republic.', 'The prevalence of bronchial asthma is increasing and mortality varies.', 'History of pediatric hematology-oncology in the Czech Republic.', 'Body composition changes during and after curative chemotherapy in patients with testicular cancer.', 'The Epidemiology and Trend of Cancer in Jordan, 2000-2013.', 'Association of Germline CHEK2 Gene Variants with Risk and Prognosis of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.', 'Palliative care among elderly cancer patients: Own experience.', 'MicroRNA expression profile associated with response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer patients.']"""

Here, we highlight two significant characteristics of miRNAs: (1) they are secreted from the producing cells and (2) they can deliver the gene silencing signals between living cells in vitro and in vivo. The circulation of miRNAs in human body fluids can be provided with a logical explanation by our discovery that the release of miRNAs is actively controlled through a ceramide-dependent machinery associated with exosome secretion. This finding can contribute to the development of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for a variety of diseases.

We demonstrate here that tumor-producing TGF-β1 induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in prostate cancer cells, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α has opposite functions in TGF-β1 regulation of VEGF expression under non-hypoxic conditions. The promoter response of VEGF to TGF-β1 was upregulated by the transfection of HIF-2α or siHIF-1α but downregulated by HIF-1α and siHIF-2α. Both HIF-1α and HIF-2α were induced by TGF-β1 at mRNA and protein levels, however, their nuclear translocation was differentially regulated by TGF-β1, suggesting its association with their opposite effects. VEGF induction by TGF-β1 occurred in a Smad3-dependent manner, and the Smad-binding element 2 (SBE2, -992 to -986) and hypoxia response element (-975 to -968) in the VEGF promoter were required for the promoter response to TGF-β1. Smad3 cooperated with HIF-2α in TGF-β1 activation of VEGF transcription and Smad3 binding to the SBE2 site was greatly impaired by knockdown of HIF-2α expression. Moreover, the VEGF promoter response to TGF-β1 was synergistically elevated by co-transfection of Smad3 and HIF-2α but attenuated by HIF-1α in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, TGF-β1 was found to increase the stability of VEGF transcript by facilitating the cytoplasmic translocation of a RNA-stabilizing factor HuR. Collectively, our data show that tumor-producing TGF-β1 induces VEGF at the both transcription and post-transcriptional levels through multiple routes including Smad3, HIF-2α and HuR. This study thus suggests that autocrine TGF-β1 production may contribute to tumor angiogenesis via HIF-2α signaling under non-hypoxic conditions, providing a selective growth advantage for prostate tumor cells.""","""['K S Chae', 'M J Kang', 'J H Lee', 'B K Ryu', 'M G Lee', 'N G Her', 'T K Ha', 'J Han', 'Y K Kim', 'S G Chi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Irradiation-induced regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor in six human squamous cell carcinoma lines of the head and neck.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha are expressed in kaposi sarcoma and modulated by insulin-like growth factor-I.', 'Effects of geldanamycin on HIF-1alpha mediated angiogenesis and invasion in prostate cancer cells.', 'Multiplicity of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors and their connection to the circadian clock in the zebrafish.', 'HIF-1 versus HIF-2--is one more important than the other?', 'LINC00152 induced by TGF-β promotes metastasis via HuR in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'The Synergistic Cooperation between TGF-β and Hypoxia in Cancer and Fibrosis.', 'PHD2 attenuates high-glucose-induced blood retinal barrier breakdown in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells by regulating the Hif-1α/VEGF pathway.', 'Anti-Cancer Activity of Phytochemicals Targeting Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 Alpha.', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2a Expression Is Positively Correlated With Gleason Score in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Ectopic expression of N-cadherin in nonmetastatic, androgen-dependent prostate cancer models caused castration resistance, invasion and metastasis. Monoclonal antibodies against the ectodomain of N-cadherin reduced proliferation, adhesion and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, these antibodies slowed the growth of multiple established CRPC xenografts, blocked local invasion and metastasis and, at higher doses, led to complete regression. N-cadherin-specific antibodies markedly delayed the time to emergence of castration resistance, markedly affected tumor histology and angiogenesis, and reduced both AKT serine-threonine kinase activity and serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion.

We generated docetaxel resistant derivatives of the androgen independent prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145. Docetaxel rapidly induces DU-145 cell death via apoptosis and the drug resistant cells were produced by periodically exposing proliferating DU-145 cultures to small doses of docetaxel. In PC-3 cells docetaxel induces delayed cell death via mitotic catastrophe evident by profound multinucleation and formation of giant cells. Mononucleated progeny of the giant PC-3 cells shows significant resistance to docetaxel. Gene expression profiling of these docetaxel resistant PC-3 cells revealed sets of docetaxel inducible and constitutively expressed genes associated with major cancer pathways. A contradictory overlap with DU-145 docetaxel resistant cells was also found. Analyses suggested significant changes associated with apoptotic function, DNA repair, cell growth, survival and proliferation, metabolism, maintenance of cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix formation. These cellular processes often contribute to drug resistance and our study identified a set of genes managing this phenotype. Additional analyses of the drug resistant PC-3 cells using shRNA constructs determined direct relevance of Cyclin G2 to docetaxel resistance as well as prevention of multinucleation, whereas the knockdown of upregulated CYP1B1 showed no effect on either of these processes. Downregulated GBP1 was explored by ectopic overexpression and even though GBP1 has a potential to mediate resistance to docetaxel, it was not utilized in PC-3 cells.

In the current study, we demonstrate that ligation of prostate cancer cell surface GRP78 by its natural ligand, activated α(2)-macroglobulin (α(2)M*), results in a 2-3-fold up-regulation in the synthesis of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The PSA is secreted into the medium as an active proteinase, where it binds to native α(2)M. The resultant α(2)M·PSA complexes bind to GRP78, causing a 1.5-2-fold increase in the activation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, S6K, and Akt, which is coupled with a 2-3-fold increase in DNA and protein synthesis.

We analyzed a selection of phytoestrogens for their potential agonistic or antagonistic activity on ERRγ. In transiently transfected PC-3 and U2-OS cells equol stimulated the transcriptional activity of ERRγ and enhanced its interaction with the coactivator GRIP1. The agonistic effect of equol was abolished by 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Equol induced a conformational change in the ERRγ ligand-binding domain. Based on structural models of the ERRγ ligand-binding domain, we were able to introduce mutations that modulated the agonistic potential of equol.

Androgen ablation by castration is an effective therapy for prostate cancer, whereas eventually most of the tumors convert from a hormone-sensitive to a hormone-refractory disease state and grow even in a low androgen environment (e.g., 0.1nM 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) like the castration-resistant stage. Androgen ablation results in hypoxia, and solid tumors possess hypoxic environments. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, which is composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β/ARNT subunits, functions as a master transcription factor for hypoxia-inducible genes. Here, we report that hypoxia enhances AR transactivation in the presence of 0.05 and 0.1nM DHT in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1α inhibited hypoxia-enhanced AR transactivation. Its inhibition by HIF-1α siRNA was canceled by expression of a siRNA-resistant form of HIF-1α. HIF-1α siRNA repressed hypoxia-stimulated expression of the androgen-responsive NKX3.1 gene in the presence of 0.1nM DHT, but not in the absence of DHT. In hypoxia, HIF-1α siRNA-repressed AR transactivation was restored in mutants in which HIF-1α lacked DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, a dominant negative form of HIF-1α canceled hypoxia-enhanced AR transactivation, and HIF-1β/ARNT siRNAs had no influence on hypoxia-enhanced AR transactivation.

We previously reported that mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) increases during the NE differentiation process. The goal of this study was to find whether MnSOD up-regulation is enough to induce NE differentiation. Several human prostate cancer LNCaP cell clones stably overexpressing MnSOD were characterized and two were selected (MnSOD-S4 and MnSOD-S12). MnSOD overexpression induces NE morphological features as well as coexpression of the NE marker synaptophysin. Both MnSOD clones exhibit lower superoxide levels and higher H(2)O(2) levels. MnSOD-overexpressing cells show higher proliferation rates in complete medium, but in steroid-free medium MnSOD-S12 cells are still capable of proliferation. MnSOD up-regulation decreases androgen receptor and prevents its nuclear translocation. MnSOD also induces up-regulation of Bcl-2 and prevents docetaxel-, etoposide-, or TNF-induced cell death. Finally, MnSOD-overexpressing cells enhance growth of androgen-independent PC-3 cells but reduce growth of androgen-dependent cells. These results indicate that redox modulation caused by MnSOD overexpression explains most NE-like features, including morphological changes, NE marker expression, androgen independence, inhibition of apoptosis, and enhancement of cell growth.

Bone metastases can undermine skeletal integrity long before the onset of symptoms.

ZOL has shown significant reductions in SREs and pain compared with placebo in patients with bone metastases from advanced prostate cancer in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.  Methods:   Patients from a placebo-controlled, Phase III trial of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer, randomized to receive ZOL 4 mg (n = 214) or placebo (n = 208) for ≤ 24 months, were stratified by pain or no pain at baseline.

Results:   ZOL significantly reduced the mean pain scores compared with placebo at 3, 9, 21, and 24 months (P ≤ .03 for each point) and reduced the annual incidence of SREs. Among patients without baseline pain, ZOL decreased the percentage of patients with ≥ 1 SRE by 39% and reduced the annual incidence of SREs by 49% compared with placebo. ZOL delayed the onset of bone pain in those patients without pain at baseline compared with placebo.

In the preliminary studies, in vitro cytotoxicity of PKBA was investigated against eight human cancer cell lines viz., IMR-32, SF-295 (both neuroblastoma), PC-3 (prostate), Colo-205 (colon), MCF-7 (breast), OVCAR-5 (ovary), HL-60, Molt-4 (both leukemia) and their respective IC(50) values were found to be 5.95, 7.11, 15.2, 14.5, 15, 15.9, 8.7 & 9.5μg/ml, respectively. For determining the mechanism of cell death in HL-60 cells, PKBA was subjected to different mechanistic studies. DNA relaxation assay of PKBA revealed inhibition of both topoisomerases I & II. The fragmentation analysis of DNA revealed typical ladders indicating the cytotoxic effect to be mediated by induction of apoptosis. The morphologic studies of PKBA showed the presence of true apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis was confirmed further by flow-cytometric detection of sub-G(1) peaks and enhanced annexin-V-FITC binding of the cells. The activation of apoptotic cascade by PKBA in HL-60 cells was found to be associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of initiator and executioner caspases and cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). In vivo studies of PKBA revealed anti-tumoral activity against both ascitic and solid murine tumor models.

It also suppresses the proliferation of many cancer cells; however, the antiproliferative mechanism(s) remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated a growth-suppressive mechanism of NAC action in androgen-independent prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells. NAC (≥ 1mM) inhibited the proliferation of PC-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, NAC treatment suppressed the activation of NF-κB induced by IKK-β as detected by the NF-κB reporter gene assay. NAC exerted a biphasic effect on the intracellular ROS levels depending on incubation time; the antioxidant effect was seen within 2h after NAC treatment, however, a pro-oxidant effect was evident after 48 h treatment. In addition to these effects, NAC treatment elicited a dose- and time-dependent increase in the Cyr61 expression that was accompanied by an increase in its mRNA and blocked by cycloheximide pretreatment. Importantly, NAC treatment caused an early but transient activation of Akt and Erk1/2. The NAC-induced increase in Cyr61 protein levels was suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor (Ly294002) and, to a lesser extent, MEK/Erk1/2 inhibitor (PD98059). Taken together, our data suggest that the antiproliferative effect of NAC is partially mediated by intracellular ROS production, the inhibition of NF-κB activity, and the activation of PI3K- and/or MEK/Erk-related intracellular signaling pathways, which lead to up-regulation of Cyr61 expression.""","""['Yoon-Jin Lee', 'David M Lee', 'Chang-Ho Lee', 'Sue-Hak Heo', 'Seong Youn Won', 'Jae-Hyuk Im', 'Moon-Kyun Cho', 'Hae-Seon Nam', 'Sang-Han Lee']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Toxicol In Vitro""","""['Production of Cyr61 protein is modulated by extracellular acidification and PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells.', 'Pro-oxidant and antioxidant effects of N-acetylcysteine regulate doxorubicin-induced NF-kappa B activity in leukemic cells.', 'Cyr61 expression influences cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis via PI3K pathway in human ovarian carcinoma cells.', 'Cyr61 is a potential prognostic marker for prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic Potential of N-Acetylcysteine for Wound Healing, Acute Bronchiolitis, and Congenital Heart Defects.', 'N-Acetylcysteine: A Review of Clinical Usefulness (an Old Drug with New Tricks).', 'N-Acetylcysteine (NAC): Impacts on Human Health.', 'Newly Developed Self-Assembling Antioxidants as Potential Therapeutics for the Cancers.', 'Arginine Deiminase Induces Immunogenic Cell Death and Is Enhanced by N-acetylcysteine in Murine MC38 Colorectal Cancer Cells and MDA-MB-231 Human Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro.', 'The role of the voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv2.1 in prostate cancer cell migration.']"""

Here we proposed a new delivery system to avoid BP accumulation into the bone, thus improving extra-skeletal bioavailability. In this work, we used the zoledronic acid (ZOL), a third generation bisphosphonate, able to induce apoptosis at micromolar concentration. We developed ZOL-containing self-assembly PEGylated nanoparticles (NPs) based on ZOL complexes with calcium phosphate NPs (CaPZ NPs) and cationic liposomes. PEGylation was achieved by two different strategies. CaPZ NPs were covered with PEGylated liposomes (pre-PLCaPZ NPs); alternatively, CaPZ NPs were previously mixed with cationic liposomes and then PEGylated by post-insertion method (post-PLCaPZ NPs). The NPs were fully characterized in terms of mean diameter and size distribution, morphology, ZOL loading, antiproliferative effect on different cell lines. Pre-PLCaPZ NPs showed the best technological characteristics, with a narrow size distribution and a high ZOL loading. Moreover, on different cancer cell lines, these NPs enhanced the antiproliferative effect of ZOL. Finally, in an animal model of prostate cancer, a significant reduction of tumor growth was achieved with pre-PLCaPZ NPs, while the tumor was unaffected by ZOL in solution.""","""['G Salzano', 'M Marra', 'M Porru', 'S Zappavigna', 'A Abbruzzese', 'M I La Rotonda', 'C Leonetti', 'M Caraglia', 'G De Rosa']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Pharm""","""['New self-assembly nanoparticles and stealth liposomes for the delivery of zoledronic acid: a comparative study.', 'Transferrin-Targeted Nanoparticles Containing Zoledronic Acid as a Potential Tool to Inhibit Glioblastoma Growth.', 'Nanoparticles for the delivery of zoledronic acid to prostate cancer cells: a comparative analysis through time lapse video-microscopy technique.', 'Zoledronic acid: an unending tale for an antiresorptive agent.', 'Impact of PEGylated Nanoparticles on Tumor Targeted Drug Delivery.', 'Apigenin Loaded Lipoid-PLGA-TPGS Nanoparticles for Colon Cancer Therapy: Characterization, Sustained Release, Cytotoxicity, and Apoptosis Pathways.', 'Hybrid Self-Assembling Nanoparticles Encapsulating Zoledronic Acid: A Strategy for Fostering Their Clinical Use.', 'Advances in Nanoliposomes for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Liver Cancer.', 'Developing Actively Targeted Nanoparticles to Fight Cancer: Focus on Italian Research.', 'The Phospholipid Research Center: Current Research in Phospholipids and Their Use in Drug Delivery.']"""

Aim:   The article aims to study the role of VED in patients following prostate cancer therapy.  Results:   Alternative therapies such as VED have emerged as one of the primary options for patients refractory to oral therapy. VED has also been successfully used in combination treatment with oral therapy and penile injections. More recently, there has been interest in the use of VED in early intervention protocols to encourage corporeal rehabilitation and prevention of postradical prostatectomy veno-occlusive dysfunction. This is evident by the preservation of penile length and girth that is seen with early use of the VED following radical prostatectomy. There are ongoing studies to help preserve penile length and girth with early use of VED following prostate brachytherapy and external beam radiation for prostate cancer. Recently, there has also been interest in the use of VED to help maintain penile length following surgical correction of Peyronie's disease and to increase penile size prior to implantation of the penile prosthesis.

Dosimetric feedback in real time was applied, for the first time to our knowledge, in interstitial photodynamic therapy. The dosimetry software IDOSE provided dose plans, including optical fiber positions and light doses based on 3-D tissue models generated from ultrasound images. Tissue optical property measurements were obtained using the same fibers used for light delivery. Measurements were taken before, during, and after the treatment session. On the basis of these real-time measured optical properties, the light-dose plan was recalculated. The aim of the treatment was to ablate the entire prostate while minimizing exposure to surrounding organs.

However, recent studies have focused primarily on pulsed delivery of the laser radiation and at relatively low pulse rates. The objective of this study is to demonstrate faster optical stimulation of the prostate cavernous nerves using continuous-wave (cw) infrared laser radiation for potential diagnostic applications. A thulium fiber laser (λ=1870 nm) is used for noncontact optical stimulation of the rat prostate cavernous nerves in vivo. Optical nerve stimulation, as measured by an intracavernous pressure (ICP) response in the penis, is achieved with the laser operating in either cw mode, or with a 5-ms pulse duration at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 Hz. Successful optical stimulation is observed to be primarily dependent on a threshold nerve temperature (42 to 45 °C), rather than an incident fluence, as previously reported. cw optical nerve stimulation provides a significantly faster ICP response time using a lower power (and also less expensive) laser than pulsed stimulation. cw optical nerve stimulation may therefore represent an alternative mode of stimulation for intraoperative diagnostic applications where a rapid response is critical, such as identification of the cavernous nerves during prostate cancer surgery.""","""['Serhat Tozburun', 'Christopher M Cilip', 'Gwen A Lagoda', 'Arthur L Burnett', 'Nathaniel M Fried']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biomed Opt""","""['Subsurface near-infrared laser stimulation of the periprostatic cavernous nerves.', 'Temperature-controlled optical stimulation of the rat prostate cavernous nerves.', 'Continuous-wave infrared subsurface optical stimulation of the rat prostate cavernous nerves using a 1490-nm diode laser.', 'Continuous-wave laser stimulation of the rat prostate cavernous nerves using a compact and inexpensive all single mode optical fiber system.', 'Noncontact stimulation of the cavernous nerves in the rat prostate using a tunable-wavelength thulium fiber laser.', 'Radiant energy required for infrared neural stimulation.', 'Photons and neurons.', 'Irradiation of 850-nm laser light changes the neural activities in rat primary visual cortex.']"""

Currently, the most widely known KLK is KLK3 or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) that has applications in clinical diagnosis and monitoring of prostate cancer. The KLK gene family encompasses the largest contiguous cluster of serine proteases in humans which is not interrupted by non-KLK genes. This exceptional and unique characteristic of KLKs makes them ideal for evolutionary studies aiming to infer the direction and timing of gene duplication events. Previous studies on the evolution of KLKs were restricted to mammals and the emergence of KLKs was suggested about 150 million years ago (mya). In order to elucidate the evolutionary history of KLKs, we performed comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of KLK homologous proteins in multiple genomes including those that have been completed recently. Interestingly, we were able to identify novel reptilian, avian and amphibian KLK members which allowed us to trace the emergence of KLKs 330 mya. We suggest that a series of duplication and mutation events gave rise to the KLK gene family. The prominent feature of the KLK family is that it consists of tandemly and uninterruptedly arrayed genes in all species under investigation. The chromosomal co-localization in a single cluster distinguishes KLKs from trypsin and other trypsin-like proteases which are spread in different genetic loci. All the defining features of the KLKs were further found to be conserved in the novel KLK protein sequences. The study of this unique family will further assist in selecting new model organisms for functional studies of proteolytic pathways involving KLKs.""","""['Athanasia Pavlopoulou', 'Georgios Pampalakis', 'Ioannis Michalopoulos', 'Georgia Sotiropoulou']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Evolution of the plasma and tissue kallikreins, and their alternative splicing isoforms.', 'Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) as emerging therapeutic targets: focus on prostate cancer and skin pathologies.', 'Activation profiles and regulatory cascades of the human kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'Tissue kallikrein proteolytic cascade pathways in normal physiology and cancer.', 'Genetic polymorphisms in the human tissue kallikrein (KLK) locus and their implication in various malignant and non-malignant diseases.', 'In Silico Identification and Analysis of Proteins Containing the Phox Homology Phosphoinositide-Binding Domain in Kinetoplastea Protists: Evolutionary Conservation and Uniqueness of Phox-Homology-Domain-Containing Protein Architectures.', '""In the light of evolution:"" keratins as exceptional tumor biomarkers.', 'Co-option of the same ancestral gene family gave rise to mammalian and reptilian toxins.', 'Androgen-Binding Protein (Abp) Evolutionary History: Has Positive Selection Caused Fixation of Different Paralogs in Different Taxa of the Genus Mus?', 'Fibrinolytic Serine Proteases, Therapeutic Serpins and Inflammation: Fire Dancers and Firestorms.']"""

Recent studies implicate microRNAs (miRNAs) as important agents in melanoma and other cancers. To investigate the role of miRNAs in melanoma, we subjected human melanoma cell lines to miRNA expression profiling, and report a range of variations in several miRNAs. Specifically, compared with expression levels in melanocytes, levels of miR-211 were consistently reduced in all eight non-pigmented melanoma cell lines we examined; they were also reduced in 21 out of 30 distinct melanoma samples from patients, classified as primary in situ, regional metastatic, distant metastatic, and nodal metastatic. The levels of several predicted target mRNAs of miR-211 were reduced in melanoma cell lines that ectopically expressed miR-211. In vivo target cleavage assays confirmed one such target mRNA encoded by KCNMA1. Mutating the miR-211 binding site seed sequences at the KCNMA1 3'-UTR abolished target cleavage. KCNMA1 mRNA and protein expression levels varied inversely with miR-211 levels. Two different melanoma cell lines ectopically expressing miR-211 exhibited significant growth inhibition and reduced invasiveness compared with the respective parental melanoma cell lines. An shRNA against KCNMA1 mRNA also demonstrated similar effects on melanoma cells. miR-211 is encoded within the sixth intron of TRPM1, a candidate suppressor of melanoma metastasis. The transcription factor MITF, important for melanocyte development and function, is needed for high TRPM1 expression. MITF is also needed for miR-211 expression, suggesting that the tumor-suppressor activities of MITF and/or TRPM1 may at least partially be due to miR-211's negative post transcriptional effects on the KCNMA1 transcript. Given previous reports of high KCNMA1 levels in metastasizing melanoma, prostate cancer and glioma, our findings that miR-211 is a direct posttranscriptional regulator of KCNMA1 expression as well as the dependence of this miRNA's expression on MITF activity, establishes miR-211 as an important regulatory agent in human melanoma.""","""['Joseph Mazar', 'Katherine DeYoung', 'Divya Khaitan', 'Edward Meister', 'Alvin Almodovar', 'James Goydos', 'Animesh Ray', 'Ranjan J Perera']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['miR-148 regulates Mitf in melanoma cells.', 'KCa1.1, a calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha 1, is targeted by miR-17-5p and modulates cell migration in malignant pleural mesothelioma.', 'MicroRNA miR-196a controls melanoma-associated genes by regulating HOX-C8 expression.', 'The Tumor Suppressor Roles and Mechanisms of MiR-491 in Human Cancers.', 'KCNMA1-related refractory status epilepticus responding to vagal nerve stimulation: Case report and literature review.', 'TRPM2 Channels: A Potential Therapeutic Target in Melanoma?', 'Critical Considerations for Investigating MicroRNAs during Tumorigenesis: A Case Study in Conceptual and Contextual Nuances of miR-211-5p in Melanoma.', 'MicroRNA as a Diagnostic Tool, Therapeutic Target and Potential Biomarker in Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma Detection-Narrative Review.', 'Current understanding of epigenetics role in melanoma treatment and resistance.', 'Multi-modal molecular programs regulate melanoma cell state.']"""

The purpose of our study was to analyze the postoperative PSA characteristics of men without prostate cancer who underwent a RCP for bladder cancer.  Methods:   The demographic, clinical and pathologic data were reviewed on 138 men who underwent RCP for bladder cancer from 1994 to 2008. Patients with known or incidentally discovered prostate cancer on final pathology were excluded from this study, and postoperative serum PSA values were reviewed in the remaining men.  Results:   The median age of the study population was 64 years (range 40-84). At a mean follow-up of 40.7 months, 137 (99.3%) of patients had an undetectable serum PSA. The one (0.7%) case in which serum PSA was not undetectable underwent an apex-sparing prostatectomy at the time of cystectomy.  Conclusions:   Serum PSA should remain undetectable for men with benign prostate pathology undergoing complete prostatectomy at the time of RCP. Elevated serum PSA following complete RCP in men with bladder cancer and pathologically confirmed benign prostate findings is rare. If the serum PSA is undetectable 3 months after RCP with benign prostate pathology, there is no need for continued PSA monitoring.

However, ARHI expression, function, and mechanisms of action in prostate cancer have not been reported. Here, we report that ARHI mRNA and protein levels were downregulated in prostate cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of ARHI inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and induced apoptosis. Further studies on a new mechanism of ARHI downregulation showed a significant inverse relationship between ARHI and miR-221 and 222, which were upregulated in prostate cancer cell lines. Transfection of miR-221 and 222 inhibitors into PC-3 cells caused a significant induction of ARHI expression. A direct interaction of miR-221 or 222 with a target site on the 3'UTR of ARHI was confirmed by a dual luciferase pMIR-REPORT assay. Finally, we also found that genistein upregulates ARHI by downregulating miR-221 and 222 in PC-3 cells. In conclusion, ARHI is a tumor suppressor gene downregulated in prostate cancer, and overexpression of ARHI can inhibit cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion. This study demonstrates for the first time that prostate cancer cells have decreased level of ARHI which could be caused by direct targeting of 3'UTR of ARHI by miR221/222.

Currently, there is no consensus or guideline to help physicians approach these patients. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate physicians' behaviors in evaluating elderly patients with UUWL and to compare the diagnostic strategy of internists and geriatricians. From January of 2008 to December of 2009, medical records of all elderly patients admitted to Taipei Veterans General Hospital with UUWL were obtained for study. All diagnostic procedures used during admissions were evaluated and the final diagnosis for each patient was obtained. Overall, data of 136 patients (mean age: 79.8±6.3 years, 80.9% males) were obtained for study with their mean weight loss of 8.6±6.4 kg. Among them, 79 (58.1%) patients were admitted to the geriatric evaluation and management unit (GEMU) and 57 (41.9%) patients were admitted to the general medical wards. There were no statistically significant differences in terms of age, sex, mean age and average weight loss between these two groups.

Tumor markers are commonly used, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (80.9%), prostate specific antigen (PSA) (81.8%), and carbohydrate 19-9 (CA 19-9) (65.4%). Imaging studies were also commonly used diagnostic tools, including gastrointestinal endoscopy (70.6%), colonoscopy (42.6%) and computerized tomography (44.1%). Compared with internists, geriatricians were more likely to order PSA testing (70.5% vs. 89.4%, p=0.021). In contrast, internists were more likely to order CA-199 (75.4%% vs. 58.2%, p=0.045), and to arrange gastrointestinal endoscopy than geriatricians (82.4% vs. 62.0%%, p=0.013).

Our previous genome-wide association study associated 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC); 1 was a functional SNP (rs2294008) in prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), but the loci of the other 2 were not investigated.  Methods:   We performed high-density mapping to explore a linkage disequilibrium status of the 2 SNPs at chromosome 1q22. A DGC case-control study was conducted using DNA from 606 cases and 1264 controls (all Japanese individuals) and validated using DNA from Japanese (304 cases, 1465 controls) and Korean (452 cases, 372 controls) individuals. The effects of SNPs on function were analyzed by reporter assays and analyses of splice variants.  Results:   A region of a strong linkage disequilibrium with the 2 SNPs contained mucin 1 (MUC1) and other 4 genes and SNPs significantly associated with DGC (rs2070803: P = 4.33 × 10(-13); odds ratio [OR], 1.71 by meta-analysis of the studies on the 3 panels) but not with intestinal-type gastric cancer.

Few longitudinal studies have investigated the effect of comorbid diabetes on general and cancer-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) in prostate cancer. Our study found that men with prevalent diabetes (pre-prostate cancer diagnosis) generally had the poorest general HRQL, urinary control and sexual function scores over time, independent of treatment.

OBJECTIVE • To investigate the association between prostate cancer, diabetes, and long-term general and cancer-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) in a cohort of men with non-metastatic prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS • We used data from self-administered surveys to assess the HRQL of men with localized or locally advanced disease at 6 (baseline), 12, 24, and 60 months after initial diagnosis. • We examined changes in general and cancer-specific HRQL with repeated measures analyses using a mixed-model approach. RESULTS • In total, we evaluated 1811 men, including 13% with prevalent (pre-prostate cancer diagnosis) diabetes, 12% with incident (post-prostate cancer diagnosis) diabetes, and 75% who never reported being diagnosed with diabetes. • Generally, men with prevalent diabetes had the poorest scores on general HRQL and non-diabetic men the best scores, independent of treatment. • Similarly, men with prevalent diabetes had the lowest urinary control and sexual function scores over time, while men without diabetes had the highest scores.

Within the prostate, testosterone is converted to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) via the action of 5α-reductase enzymes. DHT is the primary prostatic androgen and promotes the growth and survival of normal, hyperplastic and malignant prostate tissues. Throughout the different stages of PCa [prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), localised, recurrent, and metastatic] there is an increase in expression of 5α-reductase enzymes, particularly in localised high-grade carcinoma. Specifically inhibiting 5α-reductase may reduce the production of DHT in the prostate while maintaining other endogenous hormone levels. Clinical studies have shown significant PCa risk reduction by blocking this pathway with 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs). However, this comes at a risk, albeit low, with sexual side effects, gynaecomastia and cardiac failure. In addition, one study has shown a slight, but significant, risk of high-grade PCa. The currently available evidence does not support the routine use of 5α-reductase inhibitors to prevent PCa in the general population.

Materials and method:   In the proposed coarse-to-fine planning scheme, a conventional inverse planning with organ specific parameters is first performed. The voxel penalty scheme is then ""switched on"" by allowing the prescription dose to change on an individual voxel scale according to the deviation of the actual voxel dose from the ideally desired dose. The rationale here is intuitive: when the dose at a voxel does not meet its ideal dose, it simply implies that this voxel is not competitive enough when compared with the ones that have met their planning goal. In this case, increasing the penalty of the voxel by varying the prescription can boost its competitiveness and thus improve its dose. After the prescription adjustment, the plan is re-optimized. The dose adjustment/re-optimization procedure is repeated until the resultant dose distribution cannot be improved anymore. The prescription adjustment on a finer scale can be accomplished either automatically or manually. In the latter case, the regions/voxels where a dose improvement is needed are selected visually, unlike in the automatic case where the selection is done purely based on the difference of the actual dose at a given voxel and its ideal prescription. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using a head and neck and a prostate case.  Results:   An inverse planning framework with the voxel-specific penalty is established. By adjusting voxel prescriptions iteratively to boost the region where large mismatch between the actual calculated and desired doses occurs, substantial improvements can be achieved in the final dose distribution. The proposed method is applied to a head and neck case and a prostate case. For the former case, a significant reduction in the maximum dose to the brainstem is achieved while the PTV dose coverage is greatly improved. The doses to other organs at risk are also reduced, ranging from 10% to 30%. For the prostate case, the use of the voxel penalty scheme also results in vast improvements to the final dose distribution. The PTV experiences improved dose uniformity and the mean dose to the rectum and bladder is reduced by as much as 15%.  Conclusion:   Introduction of the spatially non-uniform and adjustable prescription provides room for further improvements of currently achievable dose distributions and equips the planner with an effective tool to modify IMRT dose distributions interactively. The technique is easily implementable in any existing inverse planning platform, which should facilitate clinical IMRT planning process and, in future, off-line/on-line adaptive IMRT.""","""['Pavel Lougovski', 'Jordan LeNoach', 'Lei Zhu', 'Yunzhi Ma', 'Yair Censor', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Physically constrained voxel-based penalty adaptation for ultra-fast IMRT planning.', 'Clinical knowledge-based inverse treatment planning.', 'IMRT dose shaping with regionally variable penalty scheme.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Intensity modulated radiotherapy with dynamic multileaf collimator.

While LINE-1 expression is suppressed in the most somatic human cells, LINE-1 elements are activated in human cancer. Recently, high accumulation of LINE-1-encoded ORF1p and ORF2p in endothelial cells of mature human blood vessels was described. Here, we demonstrate that LINE-1 de novo retrotransposition events lead to a reduction of endothelial cell proliferation and migration in a porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cell model. Cell cycle studies show a G0/G1 arrest in PAE cells harboring LINE-1 de novo retrotransposition events. Remarkably, in in situ analysis LINE-1-encoded ORF2p was not detectable in tumor blood vessels of different human organs while vascular endothelial cells of corresponding normal organs strongly expressed LINE-1 ORF2p. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that LINE-1 de novo retrotransposition influences selectively the expression of some angiogenic factors such as VEGF and Tie-2. Thus, our data suggest that LINE-1 de novo retrotransposition events might suppress angiogenesis and tumor vascularisation by reducing the angiogenic capacity of vascular endothelial cells.""","""['Ferya Banaz-Yaşar', 'Gyde Steffen', 'Jessica Hauschild', 'Birthe M Bongartz', 'Gerald G Schumann', 'Süleyman Ergün']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Histochem Cell Biol""","""['Prognostic value of LINE-1 retrotransposon expression and its subcellular localization in breast cancer.', 'Distinct mechanisms for trans-mediated mobilization of cellular RNAs by the LINE-1 reverse transcriptase.', 'Inhibition of LINE-1 Retrotransposition by Capsaicin.', 'Nucleic acid chaperone properties of ORF1p from the non-LTR retrotransposon, LINE-1.', 'Protein-nucleic acid interactions of LINE-1 ORF1p.', 'mRNA Vaccines: Why Is the Biology of Retroposition Ignored?', 'Distinct subcellular localization and potential role of LINE1-ORF1P in meiotic oocytes.', 'Expression of a LINE-1 endonuclease variant in gastric cancer: its association with clinicopathological parameters.', 'Prognostic value of LINE-1 retrotransposon expression and its subcellular localization in breast cancer.', 'Histochemistry and cell biology: the annual review 2010.']"""

Methods:   Forty five patients received a total of 73 doses of (186)Re-HEDP during a period of pain relapse without extra-osseous disease progression. All patients were under stable regimen of zoledronic acid, far off other therapeutic manipulations. Imaging studies regarding a modified estimation of bone scan index, were applied; the value of the largest bony lesion (called mBSI), provided that it also corresponded to the most prominent site of osseous pain was taken into account, and a new semi-quantitative index called Double Product Value (DPV), equal to pre-therapy pain score times mBSI was entered in the result analyses, to investigate any possible correlations with response endpoints.  Results:   Favourable response occurred in 35/47 evaluated therapeutic doses of (186)Re-HEDP (74.5%; excellent response in 12 doses, 25.5%).

Uncertainties remain about its use, particularly with increasing recognition of serious side effects. In animal studies, androgens protect against colonic carcinogenesis, suggesting that androgen deprivation may increase the risk of colorectal cancer.  Methods:   We identified 107 859 men in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1993 through 2002, with follow-up available through 2004. The primary outcome was development of colorectal cancer, determined from SEER files on second primary cancers. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the influence of androgen deprivation on the outcome, adjusted for patient and prostate cancer characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Men who had orchiectomies had the highest unadjusted incidence rate of colorectal cancer (6.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3 to 7.5), followed by men who had GnRH agonist therapy (4.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI = 4.0 to 4.9), and men who had no androgen deprivation (3.7 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI = 3.5 to 3.9). After adjustment for patient and prostate cancer characteristics, there was a statistically significant dose-response effect (P(trend) = .010) with an increasing risk of colorectal cancer associated with increasing duration of androgen deprivation. Compared with the absence of these treatments, there was an increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with use of GnRH agonist therapy for 25 months or longer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.53) or with orchiectomy (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.14 to 1.66).

We have shown previously that LIHR does not preclude safe endoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy (EERPE).  Methods:   EERPE is the standard approach to radical prostatectomy in our unit. Between 2001 and June 2009 we encountered 92 patients who had previously undergone LIHR who underwent our standard technique of EERPE other than modification of port placement and development of the extraperitoneal space. We recorded our standard perioperative/postoperative dataset. Twelve-month follow-up data were available from 75 of 92 patients with 6-month follow-up of the remaining 17.  Results:   Fifty-nine patients had undergone previous unilateral total extraperitoneal hernioplasty (TEP): 16 bilateral TEP, 15 unilateral transabdominal extraperitoneal hernioplasty (TAPP), and 2 bilateral TAPP. Although we needed to modify our technique, there was no increase in our operative time (153 minutes). Where indicated, we were able to perform bilateral nerve sparing and pelvic lymphadenectomy on the contralateral side to the LIHR. There were no major complications and no blood transfusions. Our positive margin rate, continence, and potency rates did not differ from our series of 2000 consecutive EERPEs. Ninety-four-point-seven percent of men had an undetectable PSA at 12 months.

The preservation of the NVB during radical prostatectomy improves the postoperative recovery of sexual potency. The accompanying blood vessels in the NVB can serve as a macroscopic landmark to localize the microscopic cavernous nerves in the NVB.  Methods:   A novel, robotic transrectal ultrasound probe manipulator (TRUS Robot) and three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction software were developed and used concurrently with the daVinci surgical robot (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) in a tandem-robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (T-RALP).  Results:   After appropriate approval and informed consent were obtained, 3 subjects underwent T-RALP without associated complications. The TRUS Robot allowed a steady handling and remote manipulation of the TRUS probe during T-RALP. It also tracked the TRUS probe position accurately and allowed 3-D image reconstruction of the prostate and surrounding structures. Image navigation was performed by observing the tips of the daVinci surgical instruments in the live TRUS image. Blood vessels in the NVB were visualized using Doppler ultrasound.  Conclusions:   Intraoperative 3-D image-guided navigation in T-RALP is feasible. The use of TRUS during radical prostatectomy can potentially improve the visualization and preservation of the NVB.

Participants drew upon four main discourses when discussing the impact of surgical treatment on their sense of masculinity: masculine identity and sexual activity, ED as a normative experience, mental resilience and vulnerability. Penetrative sex was constructed as central to a masculine identity, but inability to achieve this was normalised in terms of the ageing process. Stereotypically masculine qualities of emotional control and rationality were drawn on in describing their reaction to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer but they also experienced a new-found sense of physical vulnerability.

Inpatient costs of these and other SREs represent an estimated 49%-59% of total costs related to SREs. However, information on payer costs for hospitalizations associated with SREs is limited, especially for costs associated with specific SREs by tumor type.  Objective:   To examine costs from a payer perspective for SRE-associated hospitalizations among patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastasis secondary to prostate or breast cancer.  Methods:   Patients with SRE hospitalizations were selected from the MarketScan commercial and Medicare databases (January 1, 2003, through June 30, 2009). Sampled patients had at least 2 medical claims with primary or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for prostate cancer, breast cancer, or multiple myeloma and at least 1 subsequent hospitalization with principal diagnosis or procedure codes indicating bone surgery, pathologic fracture, or spinal cord compression. For patients with prostate cancer or breast cancer, a diagnosis code for bone metastasis was also required. If secondary diagnoses or procedure codes for SREs were present in the claim, they were used to more precisely identify the type of SRE for which the patient was treated, resulting in 3 mutually exclusive categories: spinal cord compression with or without pathologic fracture and/or surgery to the bone; pathologic fracture with or without surgery to the bone; and only surgery to the bone. Related readmissions within 30 days of a previous SRE-associated hospitalization date of discharge were excluded to minimize the risk of underestimating costs. Mean health plan payments per hospitalization, measured as net reimbursed amounts paid by the health plan to a hospital after subtracting patient copayments and deductibles, were analyzed by cancer type and type of SRE.  Results:   A total of 555 patients contributed 572 hospitalizations that met the study criteria for prostate cancer, 1,413 patients contributed 1,542 hospitalizations for breast cancer, and 1,361 patients contributed 1,495 hospitalizations for multiple myeloma. The mean age range was 61 to 72 years, and the mean length of stay per admission was 5.9 to 11.6 days across the 3 tumor types. The ranges of mean health plan payment per hospital admission across tumor types were $43,691-$59,854 for spinal cord compression, with or without pathologic fracture and/or surgery to the bone; $22,390-$26,936 for pathologic fracture without spinal cord compression, with or without surgery to the bone; and $31,016-$42,094 for surgery to the bone without pathologic fracture or spinal cord compression.

In this study, we investigated the growth inhibitory, antiandrogenic, and pro-apoptotic effects of 13 pure compounds found in the pomegranate in androgen-dependent LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Cells deprived of steroid hormones were exposed to increasing concentrations (1-100 μM) of pomegranate compounds in the presence of 0.1 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and the inhibition of cell growth was measured by WST-1 colorimetric assay after a 4 day exposure. Four compounds, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), delphinidin chloride, kaempferol, and punicic acid, were found to inhibit DHT-stimulated cell growth at concentrations of 10 μM and above. These four pomegranate compounds inhibited DHT-stimulated androgen receptor nuclear accumulation and the expression of the androgen receptor-dependent genes prostate specific antigen and steroid 5α-reductase type 1 at concentrations ≥10 μM. We determined the possible contribution of apoptosis to the observed decrease in cell growth and found that three compounds, EGCG, kaempferol, and, in particular, punicic acid, induced DNA fragmentation after a 24 h treatment, at concentrations in the 10-100 μM range. Punicic acid, an important fatty acid in pomegranate seeds, was further found to induce intrinsic apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway. In conclusion, punicic acid, the main constituent of pomegranate seed (70-80%), exhibited potent growth inhibitory activities in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, which appear to be mediated by both antiandrogenic and pro-apoptotic mechanisms.""","""['Jihane Gasmi', 'J Thomas Sanderson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Agric Food Chem""","""['Jacaric acid and its octadecatrienoic acid geoisomers induce apoptosis selectively in cancerous human prostate cells: a mechanistic and 3-D structure-activity study.', 'Punicic acid is an omega-5 fatty acid capable of inhibiting breast cancer proliferation.', 'Pomegranate extracts potently suppress proliferation, xenograft growth, and invasion of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Ellagic acid, pomegranate and prostate cancer -- a mini review.', 'Pomegranate for Prevention and Treatment of Cancer: An Update.', 'Natural flavonols: actions, mechanisms, and potential therapeutic utility for various diseases.', 'Kaempferol, Myricetin and Fisetin in Prostate and Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', ""Delphinidin and Its Glycosides' War on Cancer: Preclinical Perspectives."", 'Punicic Acid Triggers Ferroptotic Cell Death in Carcinoma Cells.', 'White button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) disrupts androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells and patient-derived xenograft.']"""

The EMSY gene is located in the prostate cancer linked chromosome region at 11q13.5. The aim of this study was to screen EMSY for sequence variants and to evaluate its association with the risk of prostate cancer. We performed a Finnish population-based case-control study with 923 controls, 184 familial prostate cancer cases and 2,301 unselected prostate cancer cases. Variants were screened using sequencing and validated using the TaqMan assay and High Resolution Melting analysis. A total of 27 sequence variants were found, and 17 of them were novel. A rare intronic variant, IVS6-43A>G (minor allele frequency of 0.004), increased the prostate cancer risk in familial cases (odds ratio [OR] = 7.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-45.5; p = 0.02). Further analysis with clinicopathological data revealed that the variant is associated with aggressive unselected cases (prostate specific antigen ≥ 20 μg/L or Gleason grade ≥ 7), based on both case-control (OR = 6.0; 95% CI = 1.3-26.4; p = 0.03) and case-case analyses (OR = 6.5; 95% CI = 1.5-28.4; p = 0.002). In addition, all variant-positive familial cases had aggressive cancer. Our results indicate that the intronic variant IVS6-43A>G increases the familial and unselected prostate cancer risk in a Finnish population and contributes to the aggressive progression of the disease in a high-penetrance manner.

Few studies have examined the impact of weight gain during adulthood on prostate cancer risk and mortality and these have reported conflicting results. We analysed data from 20,991 Norwegian men who participated in two phases of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study in 1984/1986 (HUNT-1, when aged at least 20 years) and 1995/1997 (HUNT-2). Weight and height were measured at both HUNT-1 and HUNT-2, allowing each man's change in weight and body mass index (BMI) to be computed. During a median of 9.3 years of follow-up after the end of HUNT-2, 649 (3%) men developed prostate cancer. We observed no increase in prostate cancer incidence amongst men who put on weight between HUNT-1 and HUNT-2. In multivariable models, including adjustment for weight at HUNT-2, the hazard ratio (HR) for prostate cancer per one standard deviation, SD (6.2 kg) gain in weight was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]=0.87-1.10, p-trend=0.70) and per one SD gain in BMI (1.9 kg/m(2) ) was 0.99 (95% CI=0.90-1.10, p-trend=0.88). Amongst men diagnosed with prostate cancer (any stage), there was no evidence that gain in weight before diagnosis was positively associated with subsequent all-cause mortality (HR per one SD increase in weight=0.98; 95% CI=0.81-1.19, p-trend=0.86).

In this report, we offer evidence that a critical support of IGF-I in prostate cancer is mediated by its ability to suppress BMP4-induced apoptosis and Smad-mediated gene expression. Suppression of BMP4 signaling by IGF-I was reversed by chemical inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, or mTOR; by enforced expression of wild-type PTEN or dominant-negative PI3K; or by small hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of mTORC1/2 subunits Raptor or Rictor. Similarly, IGF-I suppressed BMP4-induced transcription of the Id1, Id2, and Id3 genes that are crucially involved in prostate tumor progression through PI3K-dependent and mTORC1/2-dependent mechanisms. Immunohistochemical analysis of non-malignant and malignant prostate tissues offered in vivo support for our model that IGF-I-mediated activation of mTOR suppresses phosphorylation of the BMP-activated Smad transcription factors. Our results offer the first evidence that IGF-I signaling through mTORC1/2 is a key homeostatic regulator of BMP4 function in prostate epithelial cells, acting at two levels to repress both the proapoptotic and pro-oncogenic signals of BMP-activated Smads. We suggest that deregulation of this homeostatic control may be pivotal to the development and progression of prostate cancer, providing important implications and new potential targets for the therapeutic intervention of this malignancy.""","""['Reema S Wahdan-Alaswad', 'Kyung Song', 'Tracy L Krebs', 'Dorjee T N Shola', 'Jose A Gomez', 'Shigemi Matsuyama', 'David Danielpour']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Retraction: Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Suppresses Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells by Activating mTOR Signaling.', 'Critical role of a survivin/TGF-β/mTORC1 axis in IGF-I-mediated growth of prostate epithelial cells.', 'Inhibition of mTORC1 kinase activates Smads 1 and 5 but not Smad8 in human prostate cancer cells, mediating cytostatic response to rapamycin.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-I inhibits transcriptional responses of transforming growth factor-beta by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent suppression of the activation of Smad3 but not Smad2.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins.', 'The anticancer effects of curcumin via targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway.', 'Perinatal Nutritional and Metabolic Pathways: Early Origins of Chronic Lung Diseases.', 'Retraction: Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Suppresses Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells by Activating mTOR Signaling.', 'mTORC1 loss impairs epidermal adhesion via TGF-β/Rho kinase activation.', 'Survivin and Tumorigenesis: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Strategies.', 'Repulsive guidance molecule B inhibits metastasis and is associated with decreased mortality in non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

A 150-pair case-control study was designed from RP patients who developed systemic progression (SP) within 6 years of RP (cases) and men who were free of disease at least 8 years after RP (controls). The cases and controls were matched on conventional prognostic clinical parameters. TOP2A and MIB-1 levels were assessed by immunohistochemical methods, and ERG status was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The prognostic abilities of TOP2A and MIB-1 were significantly better in ERG(-) patients, and TOP2A was superior to MIB-1. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, the TOP2A and MIB-1 scores exhibited AUCs of 0.81 and 0.78 for ERG(-) patients, versus 0.67 and 0.68 for ERG(+) patients, respectively. Clinical parameters attained an AUC of 0.65 in ERG(-) patients and 0.54 in ERG(+) patients. When both markers were incorporated into a model for ERG(-) patients, the AUC increased to 0.83, with TOP2A showing a stronger association with SP than MIB-1. The time to SP was significantly associated with TOP2A; higher 5-year SP rates were observed in patients with higher TOP2A protein levels.

Experimental design:   Atu027 compared with vehicle or control small interfering RNA lipoplexes was tested in two experimental lung metastasis models (Lewis lung carcinoma, B16V) and spontaneous metastasis mouse models (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, mammary fat pad). Different dosing schedules (repeated low volume tail vein injections) were applied to obtain insight into effective Atu027 treatment. Primary tumor growth and lung metastasis were measured, and tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and histology. In vitro studies in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were carried out to provide an insight into molecular changes on depletion of PKN3, in support of efficacy results.  Results:   Intravenous administration of Atu027 prevents pulmonary metastasis. In particular, formation of spontaneous lung metastasis was significantly inhibited in animals with large tumor grafts as well as in mice with resected primary mammary fat pad tumors. In addition, we provide evidence that an increase in VE-cadherin protein levels as a downstream result of PKN3 target gene inhibition may change endothelial function, resulting in reduced colonization and micrometastasis formation.

CADM-1, CADM-3, and CADM-4 have been shown to act as tumor suppressor genes in multiple cancers including prostate cancer. However, CADM-2 expression has not been determined in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   The CADM-2 gene was cloned and characterized and its expression in human prostatic cell lines and cancer specimens was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and an immunohistochemical tissue array, respectively. The effects of adenovirus-mediated CADM-2 expression on prostate cancer cells were also investigated. CADM-2 promoter methylation was evaluated by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCR.  Results:   We report the initial characterization of CADM-2 isoforms: CADM-2a and CADM-2b, each with separate promoters, in human chromosome 3p12.1. Prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and DU145, expressed negligible CADM-2a relative to primary prostate tissue and cell lines, RWPE-1 and PPC-1, whereas expression of CADM-2b was maintained. Using immunohistochemistry, tissue array results from clinical specimens showed statistically significant decreased expression in prostate carcinoma compared with normal donor prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and normal tissue adjacent to tumor (P < 0.001). Adenovirus-mediated CADM-2a expression suppressed DU145 cell proliferation in vitro and colony formation in soft agar. The decrease in CADM-2a mRNA in cancer cell lines correlated with promoter region hypermethylation as determined by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCR. Accordingly, treatment of cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine alone or in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A resulted in the reactivation of CADM-2a expression.  Conclusions:   CADM-2a protein expression is significantly reduced in prostate cancer.

In addition, the low sensitivity of prostate cancer to chemotherapy makes it difficult to treat this condition. The serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 plays an important role in cell cycle progression and apoptosis inhibition, resulting in prostate tumorigenesis. Therefore, Pim-1 inhibition has been expected to be an attractive target for developing new anti-cancer drugs. However, no small compounds targeting Pim-1 have progressed to clinical use because of their lack of specificity. Here, we have reported a new cell-permeable Pim-1 inhibitory p27(Kip1) peptide that could interfere with the binding of Pim-1 to its substrates and act as an anti-cancer drug. The peptide could bind to Pim-1 and inhibit phosphorylation of endogenous p27(Kip1) and Bad by Pim-1. Treatment of prostate cancer with the peptide induces G(1) arrest and subsequently apoptosis in vitro. However, the peptide showed almost no growth inhibitory or apoptosis-inducing effects in normal cells. The peptide could inhibit tumor growth in in vivo prostate cancer xenograft models. Moreover, the peptide treatment could overcome resistance to taxol, one of the first line chemotherapeutic agents for prostate cancer, and a combination of the peptide with taxol synergistically inhibited prostate cancer growth in vivo.

A select combination of three dietary phytoestrogens containing 8.33 μM each of genistein (G), quercetin (Q) and biochanin A (B) was found to be more potent in inhibiting the growth of androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) as well as DU-145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells in vitro than either 25 μM of G, B or Q or 12.5+12.5 μM of G+Q, Q+B or G+B. Subsequent mechanistic studies in PC-3 cells indicated that the action of phytoestrogens was mediated both through estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent and ER-independent pathways as potent estrogen antagonist ICI-182780 (ICI, 5 μM) could not completely mask the synergistic anticancer effects, which were sustained appreciably in presence of ICI. G+Q+B combination was significantly more effective than individual compounds or their double combinations in increasing ER-β, bax (mRNA expression); phospho-JNK, bax (protein levels); and in decreasing bcl-2, cyclin E, c-myc (mRNA expression); phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK, bcl-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (protein levels) in PC-3 cells. Phytoestrogens also synergistically stimulated caspase-3 activity. Our findings suggest that selectively combining anticancer phytoestrogens could significantly increase the efficacy of individual components resulting in improved efficacy at physiologically achievable concentrations.

The mass screening of CaP, which has been performed since Jan 2008 in Binh Dan hospital (Ho Chi Minh City) aims to evaluate the effect of CaP mass screening in Vietnam. The details of CaP treatment from 1999 to now in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) were also used for evaluation and comparison.  Materials and methods:   From the first quarter of 2008, we started a free CaP screening program in HCMC. There were 408 cases during first round of results. When inspecting CaP treatment, all papers and studies of CaP at Binh Dan hospital from 1999 were analyzed, including 1,775 CaPs treated.  Results and discussions:   A total of 408 subjects were screened during the CaP program. Prostate biopsies were carried out on 87 men (21.3%) based on PSA values and DRE results. Ten of these biopsied men (2.5%) were diagnosed with CaP, mostly with Gleason's scores of 5 to 7 and in an early clinical stage. In reviewing CaP treatment from 1999 to 2009, complete androgen blockade/maximal androgen blockade (MAB/CAB) was widely used, while chemotherapy and radiotherapy were not routinely used. Open and laparoscopic total prostatectomy remarkably increased due to the many efforts of CaP screening. The number of CaP cases has now reached and overtaken the number of bladder cancer cases in our hospital. Similarly, early diagnosis rates have increased in parallel with radical treatment.  Conclusion:   Our initial outcomes reflected a low prevalence of CaP in general (2,5%), but a high occurrence of medium grade lesions (Gleason 7) among patients who tested positive for CaP. On one hand, this observation highlights the value of the CaP screening programs in alerting doctors/people and detecting more cases in the early stages of development. On the other hand, the benefit of a mass screening program for CaP is not proven. Meanwhile, selective CaP screening takes advantage of diagnosis and treatment in our country.""","""['Chuyen Vu Le', 'Oanh Quang Dao', 'Linh Ngoc Khac Tran']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Rising HIV infection rates in Ho Chi Minh City herald emerging AIDS epidemic in Vietnam.', 'Prostate cancer screening perspective, Malaysia.', 'Prostate cancer screening and mortality: comparison of recent randomized controlled clinical trials.', 'Re: Prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment after the introduction of prostate-specific antigen screening: 1986-2005.', 'Prostate-specific antigen testing and prostate cancer screening.', 'Hospital-based prostate cancer screening in vietnamese men with lower urinary tract symptoms: a classification and regression tree model.', 'Cancers in Vietnam-Burden and Control Efforts: A Narrative Scoping Review.', 'The incidence, mortality, and risk factors of prostate cancer in Asian men.', 'The Clinical Efficacy of Prostate Cancer Screening in Worldwide and Iran: Narrative Review.', 'Prostate cancer screening in Europe and Asia.']"""

When low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients were independently removed from the model the c-index was 0.64, 0.65 and 0.55, respectively. • The c-index for the full model using the categorical nomogram risk scores was 0.67. Similar to the D'Amico model, the c-index improved to 0.69 when intermediate-risk patients were removed from the model.

Studies have suggested a link between Sirt1 and circadian rhythms, the disruption of which has been linked to cancer. Interestingly, a decreased production of the pineal melatonin has been shown to deregulate the circadian rhythm machinery and increase cancer risk. Furthermore, disruption in melatonin production and circadian rhythmicity has been associated with aging. Here, we challenged our hypothesis that melatonin will impart antiproliferative response against PCa via inhibiting Sirt1. We demonstrated that melatonin significantly inhibited Sirt1 protein and activity in vitro in multiple human PCa cell lines, and melatonin-mediated Sirt1 inhibition was accompanied with a significant decrease in the proliferative potential of PCa cells, but not of normal cells. Forced overexpression of Sirt1 partially rescued the PCa cells from melatonin's antiproliferative effects, suggesting that Sirt1 is a direct target of melatonin. Employing transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice, we also demonstrated that oral administration of melatonin, at human-achievable doses, significantly inhibited PCa tumorigenesis as shown by decreases in (i) prostate and genitourinary weight, (ii) serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)/IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) ratio, (iii) mRNA and protein levels of the proliferation markers (PCNA, Ki-67).

Experimental studies have provided evidence that it plays a role in prostate tumorigenesis and tumor progression. To study how increased FGF-8 affects the prostate, we generated and analyzed transgenic (TG) mice expressing FGF-8b under the probasin promoter that targets expression to prostate epithelium. Prostates of the TG mice showed an increased size and changes in stromal and epithelial morphology progressing from atypia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mouse PIN, mPIN) lesions to tumors with highly variable phenotype bearing features of adenocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and sarcoma. The development of mPIN lesions was preceded by formation of activated stroma containing increased proportion of fibroblastic cells, rich vasculature, and inflammation. The association between advancing stromal and epithelial alterations was statistically significant. Microarray analysis and validation with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that expression of osteopontin and connective tissue growth factor was markedly upregulated in TG mouse prostates compared with wild type prostates. Androgen receptor staining was decreased in transformed epithelium and in hypercellular stroma but strongly increased in the sarcoma-like lesions. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that disruption of FGF signaling pathways by increased epithelial production of FGF-8b leads to strongly activated and atypical stroma, which precedes development of mPIN lesions and prostate cancer with mixed features of adenocarcinoma and sarcoma in the prostates of TG mice.

This invasiveness is in contrast to normal mesenchymal cells that retract on contact with another cell. Why cancer cells are defective in contact inhibition of locomotion is not understood. Here, we analyse the dynamics of prostate cancer cell lines co-cultured with fibroblasts, and demonstrate that a combinatorial code of Eph receptor activation dictates whether cell migration will be contact inhibited. The unimpeded migration of metastatic PC-3 cells towards fibroblasts is dependent on activation of EphB3 and EphB4 by ephrin-B2, which we show activates Cdc42 and cell migration. Knockdown of EphB3 and EphB4 restores contact inhibition of locomotion to PC-3 cells. Conversely, homotypic collisions between two cancer cells results in contact inhibition of locomotion, mediated by EphA-Rho-Rho kinase (ROCK) signalling. Thus, the migration of cancer cells can switch from restrained to invasive, depending on the Eph-receptor profile of the cancer cell and the reciprocal ephrin ligands expressed by neighbouring cells.""","""['Jonathan W Astin', 'Jennifer Batson', 'Shereen Kadir', 'Jessica Charlet', 'Raj A Persad', 'David Gillatt', 'Jon D Oxley', 'Catherine D Nobes']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Nat Cell Biol""","""['Cancer cells exploit the Eph-ephrin system to promote invasion and metastasis: tales of unwitting partners.', 'Regulation of contact inhibition of locomotion by Eph-ephrin signalling.', 'Ephrin-independent regulation of cell substrate adhesion by the EphB4 receptor.', 'Rac-dependent trans-endocytosis of ephrinBs regulates Eph-ephrin contact repulsion.', 'Homotypic receptor-receptor interactions regulating Eph signaling.', 'The Ephrin tyrosine kinase a3 (EphA3) is a novel mediator of RAGE-prompted motility of breast cancer cells.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast: Role in Prostate Cancer Progression to Metastatic Disease and Therapeutic Resistance.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Heterogeneity, Activation and Function: Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'A computational modeling approach for predicting multicell spheroid patterns based on signaling-induced differential adhesion.', 'The role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in tumorigenesis of gastric cancer.']"""

However, fiducials that are typically used for conventional photon radiotherapy cause large dose perturbations in patients who receive proton radiotherapy. A proposed solution has been to use fiducials of lower atomic number (Z) materials to minimize this effect in tissue, but the effects of these fiducials on dose distributions have not been quantified. The objective of this study was to analyze the magnitude of the dose perturbations caused by select lower-Z fiducials (a carbon-coated zirconium dioxide fiducial and a plastic-coated stainless steel fiducial) and compare them to perturbations caused by conventional gold fiducials. Sets of phantoms were used to assess select components of the effects on dose. First, the fiducials were assessed for radiographic visibility using both conventional computed tomography (CT) and an on-board kilovoltage imaging device at our proton therapy center. CT streak artifacts from the fiducials were also measured in a separate phantom. Second, dose perturbations were measured downstream of the fiducials using radiochromic film. The magnitude of dose perturbation was characterized as a function of marker material, implantation depth and orientation with respect to the beam axis. The radiographic visibility of the markers was deemed to be acceptable for clinical use. The dose measurements showed that the perpendicularly oriented zirconium dioxide and stainless steel fiducials located near the center of modulation of the proton beam perturbed the dose by less than 10%, but that the same fiducials in a parallel orientation near the end of the range of the beam could perturb the dose by as much as 38%. This suggests that carbon-coated and stainless steel fiducials could be used in proton therapy if they are located far from the end of the range of the beam and if they are oriented perpendicular to the beam axis.""","""['Joey Cheung', 'Rajat J Kudchadker', 'X Ronald Zhu', 'Andrew K Lee', 'Wayne D Newhauser']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Investigation of dose perturbations and the radiographic visibility of potential fiducials for proton radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'Monte Carlo simulations of the dosimetric impact of radiopaque fiducial markers for proton radiotherapy of the prostate.', 'Microscopic gold particle-based fiducial markers for proton therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Fiducial markers and spacers in prostate radiotherapy: current applications.', 'Prostate cancer: image guidance and adaptive therapy.', 'Experimental Comparison of Fiducial Markers Used in Proton Therapy: Study of Different Imaging Modalities and Proton Fluence Perturbations Measured With CMOS Pixel Sensors.', 'Managing treatment-related uncertainties in proton beam radiotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of MR-derived synthetic-CTs for MR-only proton treatment planning.', 'Value of Three-Dimensional Imaging Systems for Image-Guided Carbon Ion Radiotherapy.', 'Knowledge of endoscopic ultrasound-delivered fiducial composition and dimension necessary when planning proton beam radiotherapy.']"""

SDF1α activation of CXCR4 induces signaling pathways that have been implicated in prostate metastasis and progression to an advanced disease. The pathways of CXCR4 and PTEN converge, leading to the promotion and regulation of tumorigenesis, respectively. However, loss of PTEN may permit CXCR4 to progress prostate cancer to an advanced disease. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of PTEN in CXCR4-mediated tumorigenesis. When screening advanced metastatic prostate cancer cell lines for PTEN, we observed a loss of expression in PC3 and LNCaP cells whereas Du145 expressed wild-type PTEN. All three cell lines were positive for surface expression of CXCR4. Reconsitution of PTEN induced a mesenchymal to epithelial like morphologic change and inhibited CXCR4-mediated migration and proliferation in PC3 cells. Downregulation of PTEN by siRNA enhanced the CXCR4-mediated migratory behavior of Du145 cells. By Western blot analysis, we observed that PTEN inhibited basal AKT phosphorylation but not ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PTEN-expressing cells. Upon CXCR4 stimulation, PTEN inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation but not phosphorylation of AKT. The CXCR4-mediated migration of PC3 cells was through the ERK1/2 pathway, as confirmed by chemical inhibitors. On the basis of these studies, we suggest that loss of PTEN permits CXCR4-mediated functions in prostate cancer cells through the ERK1/2 pathway.

An IMRT plan with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) was created with dose prescriptions of 42 Gy to the pelvic target volume, a boost to 60 Gy to the MRL-positive lymph nodes, and 72 Gy to the prostate.  Results:   All MRL-positive lymph nodes could be identified on the planning CT. This information could be used to delineate a boost volume and to individualize the pelvic target volume for elective irradiation. IMRT planning delivered highly acceptable radiotherapy plans with regard to the prescribed dose levels and the dose to the organs at risk (OARs).  Conclusion:   MRL can be used to select patients with limited lymph node involvement for pelvic radiotherapy. MRL-guided delineation of a boost volume and an elective pelvic target volume for selective high-dose lymph node irradiation with IMRT is feasible. Whether this approach will result in improved outcome for these patients needs to be investigated in further clinical studies.""","""['Hanneke J M Meijer', 'Oscar A Debats', 'Martina Kunze-Busch', 'Peter van Kollenburg', 'Jan Willem Leer', 'J Alfred Witjes', 'Johannes H A M Kaanders', 'Jelle O Barentsz', 'Emile N J Th van Lin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Ferumoxtran-10 MR lymphography for target definition and follow-up in a patient undergoing image-guided, dose-escalated radiotherapy of lymph nodes upon PSA relapse.', 'Value of PET/CT and MR lymphography in treatment of prostate cancer patients with lymph node metastases.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to prostate and pelvic nodes-is pelvic lymph node coverage adequate with fiducial-based image-guided radiotherapy?', 'Lymphotropic nanoparticle-enhanced MRI in prostate cancer: value and therapeutic potential.', 'Prostate cancer: what treatment techniques for which tumors?

Aberrant androgen receptor activation due to androgen receptor mutation is an important mechanism of androgen independence. We determined the effectiveness and mechanism of 17α-estradiol (Sigma®) in blocking aberrant androgen receptor activation due to androgen receptor mutation.  Materials and methods:   We used LNCaP and MDA Pca-2b prostatic tumor cells (ATCC®) containing a mutated androgen receptor and WT estrogen receptor β to test 17α-estradiol inhibition of aberrant androgen receptor activation of prostate specific antigen gene expression and cell growth. Cotransfection analysis was used to further elucidate the mechanism of 17α-estradiol action. Xenograft animals with an LNCaP prostate tumor were prepared to study the in vivo effect of 17α-estradiol on tumor growth inhibition.  Results:   In LNCaP cells 17α-estradiol produced a dose dependent inhibition of cyproterone acetate (Sigma) or dihydrotestosterone induced prostate specific antigen gene expression. In MDA Pca-2b cells 17α-estradiol inhibited cortisol (Sigma) induced prostate specific antigen expression and blocked dihydrotestosterone and cortisol induced cell proliferation in LNCaP and MDA Pca-2b cells, respectively. Cotransfection analysis showed that 17α-estradiol inhibition of aberrant androgen receptor activation of prostate specific antigen gene expression was medicated via estrogen receptors. In xenograft mice with LNCaP prostate cancer 17α-estradiol but not 17β-estradiol (Sigma) significantly inhibited tumor growth, although each estrogen tended to decrease tumor growth.  Conclusions:   Results suggest that 17α-estradiol with less classic estrogenic activity is a potential therapeutic agent for androgen independent prostate cancer due to androgen receptor mutation.""","""['Yaming Qiao', 'Lu Wang', 'Li-Qun Cai', 'Chen Tan', 'Julianne Imperato-McGinley', 'Yuan-Shan Zhu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Suppression of DHT-induced paracrine stimulation of endothelial cell growth by estrogens via prostate cancer cells.', 'Receptor isoform and ligand-specific modulation of dihydrotestosterone-induced prostate specific antigen gene expression and prostate tumor cell growth by estrogens.', '17alpha-estradiol inhibits LAPC-4 prostatic tumor cell proliferation in cell cultures and tumor growth in xenograft animals.', 'Antiandrogenic effects of novel androgen synthesis inhibitors on hormone-dependent prostate cancer.', 'Estrogen receptor beta in prostate cancer: friend or foe?', 'Identification of a prognosis-related ceRNA network in cholangiocarcinoma and potentially therapeutic molecules using a bioinformatic approach and molecular docking.', 'Androgen actions on endothelium functions and cardiovascular diseases.', 'Study of NGEP expression in androgen sensitive prostate cancer cells: A potential target for immunotherapy.', 'Suppression of DHT-induced paracrine stimulation of endothelial cell growth by estrogens via prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential effects of estrogen receptor ligands on regulation of dihydrotestosterone-induced cell proliferation in endothelial and prostate cancer cells.']"""

These strictures are sometimes recalcitrant to dilation and urethrotomy alone. We present our experience with the Urolume® stent for prostate cancer treatment related stricture.  Materials and methods:   A total of 38 men with posterior urethral stricture secondary to prostate cancer treatment were treated with Urolume stenting. Stents were placed in all men after aggressive urethrotomy over the entire stricture. A successfully managed stricture was defined as open and stable for greater than 6 months after any necessary secondary procedures.  Results:   The initial success rate was 47%. After a total of 31 secondary procedures in 19 men, including additional stent placement in 8 (18%), the final success rate was 89% at a mean ± SD followup of 2.3 ± 2.5 years. Four cases (11%) in which treatment failed ultimately requiring urinary diversion (3) or salvage prostatectomy (1). Incontinence was noted in 30 men (82%), of whom 19 (63%) received an artificial urinary sphincter a mean of 7.2 ± 2.4 months after the stent. Subanalysis revealed that irradiated men had longer strictures (3.6 vs 2.0 cm, p = 0.003) and a higher post-stent incontinence rate (96% vs 50%, p < 0.001) than men who underwent prostatectomy alone but the initial failure rate was similar (54% vs 50%, p = 0.4).  Conclusions:   Urolume stenting is a reasonable option for severe post-prostate cancer treatment stricture when patients are unwilling or unable to undergo open reconstructive surgery. Incontinence should be expected.

A needle biopsy was diagnosed as an unclassified spindle cell sarcoma, and 2 cycles of adriamycin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy were given, followed by radical prostatectomy. The prostatectomy specimen revealed a high-grade sarcoma with fascicles of highly cellular spindle cells and numerous mitoses with hemorrhage and necrosis. In areas, the tumor also contained sheets of loosely cohesive epithelioid cells with rhabdoid tumor component. Both spindle and rhabdoid tumor cells were positive for vimentin, CD34, and progesterone receptor and negative for desmin and cytokeratin immunostainings. The rhabdoid tumor cells retained INI1 expression. The tumor recurred in the bladder, and the patient died of sepsis.

Current criteria for insignificant prostate cancer use a tumor volume threshold of less than 0.5 ml for the index tumor. In this study we reassess this tumor volume threshold for clinically insignificant prostate cancer using an independent data set.  Materials and methods:   The rate of insignificant prostate cancer was calculated by modeling lifetime risk estimates of prostate cancer diagnosis in screened and nonscreened participants in a randomized prostate cancer screening trial. Using lifetime risk estimates 50.8% of screen detected prostate cancer was calculated to be clinically insignificant and the 49.2% largest tumor volume of 325 prostatectomy specimens was used to determine the threshold tumor volume for insignificant prostate cancer. Because stage and grade represent the strongest determinants of cancer aggressiveness, we also calculated the tumor volume threshold for insignificant cancer after the selection of patients with organ confined prostate cancer without Gleason pattern 4/5. The analyses were performed for total tumor volume and for index tumor volume.  Results:   The minimum threshold tumor volume of the index tumor and total tumor was 0.55 and 0.70 ml, respectively. After accounting for tumor stage and grade we obtained a threshold volume for the index tumor and total tumor of 1.3 and 2.5 ml, respectively.  Conclusions:   We confirmed the original value of the index tumor volume threshold of 0.5 ml for insignificant prostate cancer, and we demonstrated that clinically insignificant prostate cancer may include index Gleason score 6, pT2 tumors with volumes up to at least 1.3 ml.

Materials and methods:   The Center for Prostate Disease Research database was queried for all men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1989 to 2009. The patients were stratified into age quartiles and by race. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare clinicopathological features across patient stratifications. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare biochemical recurrence-free, prostate cancer specific and overall survival.  Results:   Of the 12,081 men evaluated 3,650 (30.2%) were 70 years old or older. These men had a statistically significant higher clinical stage, biopsy grade and prediagnosis prostate specific antigen velocity (p < 0.0001). For those patients who underwent prostatectomy, pathological stage, grade and surgical margin status were all significantly higher in men 70 years old or older.

In the 2 to 10 ng/ml prostate specific antigen range the AUCs (95% CI) were 0.58 (0.49, 0.67) for free prostate specific antigen, 0.53 (0.44, 0.62) for [-2]proenzyme prostate specific antigen, 0.67 (0.59, 0.75) for %free prostate specific antigen, 0.57 (0.49, 0.65) for %[-2]proenzyme prostate specific antigen and 0.59 (0.51, 0.67) for phi. Only %free prostate specific antigen retained independent predictive value compared to the traditional risk factors.  Conclusions:   Free prostate specific antigen retained independent diagnostic usefulness for prostate cancers detected through prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination screening.

Human prostate cancer cells (C4 2b) were injected into immunocompromised mice using an intratibial injection model to create mixed lytic/blastic lesions. RANK-Fc, a recombinant RANKL antagonist, was injected subcutaneously three times a week (10mg/kg) to inhibit RANKL and subsequent formation, function and survival of osteoclasts. Inhibition of BMP activity was achieved by transducing prostate cancer cells ex vivo with a retroviral vector expressing noggin (retronoggin; RN). There were three treatment groups (RANK-Fc treatment, RN treatment and combined RN and RANK-Fc treatment) and two control groups (untreated control and empty vector control for the RN treatment group). The progression of bone lesion and tumor growth was evaluated using plain radiographs, hindlimb tumor size, (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose and (18)F-fluoride micro PET-CT, histology and histomorphometry. Treatment with RANK-Fc alone inhibited osteolysis and transformed a mixed lytic/blastic lesion into an osteoblastic phenotype. Treatment with RN alone inhibited the osteoblastic component in a mixed lytic/blastic lesion and resulted in formation of smaller osteolytic bone lesion with smaller soft tissue size. The animals treated with both RN and RANK-Fc demonstrated delayed development of bone lesions, inhibition of osteolysis, small soft tissue tumors and preservation of bone architecture with less tumor induced new bone formation. This study suggests that combined inhibition of the RANKL and the BMP pathway may be an effective biologic therapy to inhibit the progression of established mixed lytic/blastic prostate cancer lesions in bone.""","""['Mandeep S Virk', 'Farhang Alaee', 'Frank A Petrigliano', 'Osamu Sugiyama', 'Arion F Chatziioannou', 'David Stout', 'William C Dougall', 'Jay R Lieberman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Bone""","""['Influence of simultaneous targeting of the bone morphogenetic protein pathway and RANK/RANKL axis in osteolytic prostate cancer lesion in bone.', 'Mixed metastatic lung cancer lesions in bone are inhibited by noggin overexpression and Rank:Fc administration.', 'RANKL acts directly on RANK-expressing prostate tumor cells and mediates migration and expression of tumor metastasis genes.', 'Targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK) ligand in prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Targeting RANK/RANKL in the treatment of solid tumours and myeloma.', 'Osteoclasts directly influence castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'The bone microenvironment promotes tumor growth and tissue perfusion compared with striated muscle in a preclinical model of prostate cancer in vivo.', 'Integrated and Functional Genomics Analysis Validates the Relevance of the Nuclear Variant ErbB380kDa in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Bone morphogenetic protein signaling in musculoskeletal cancer.', 'Bone Tumor Environment as a Potential Therapeutic Target in Ewing Sarcoma.']"""

Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound, inhibits AR function and reduces the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a notable target gene of AR. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which resveratrol inhibits AR function. Although the protein levels of AR were decreased by resveratrol treatment for 24h, the decrease could not fully account for the suppression of AR function. The total and the nuclear AR levels were not affected after incubation with 10μM resveratrol for 3h, whereas resveratrol inhibited the binding of AR to the enhancer region of PSA and decreased the acetylation of AR even at this early phase. Inhibition of transcription by resveratrol was weaker in the AR acetylation site mutant than in the wild-type. In later phase (24h) after incubation with resveratrol, the ligand-induced nuclear accumulation of AR was markedly decreased by resveratrol. These data show that resveratrol inhibits DNA binding of AR, presumably by decreasing its level of acetylation and suggest that acetylation of AR is involved in its accumulation in the nucleus.""","""['Naoki Harada', 'Kiyotaka Atarashi', 'Yohei Murata', 'Ryoichi Yamaji', 'Yoshihisa Nakano', 'Hiroshi Inui']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Resveratrol inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-mediated androgen receptor signaling and represses tumor progression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination of resveratrol and antiandrogen flutamide has synergistic effect on androgen receptor inhibition in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor activity at the prostate specific antigen locus: steroidal and non-steroidal mechanisms.', 'Prostate specific antigen gene regulation by androgen receptor.', 'Resveratrol--a prostate cancer chemopreventive agent?', 'Integrin αvβ3 in the Mediating Effects of Dihydrotestosterone and Resveratrol on Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation.', 'Steroid Receptor Signallings as Targets for Resveratrol Actions in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', ""Differential Methylation and Acetylation as the Epigenetic Basis of Resveratrol's Anticancer Activity."", 'Androgen receptor as potential therapeutic target in metastatic endometrial cancer.', 'Molecular insight into the differential anti-androgenic activity of resveratrol and its natural analogs: in silico approach to understand biological actions.']"""

Since the variant is located outside of a protein-coding region, the target genes driving tumorigenesis are not readily apparent. Two genes nearest to this variant, MSMB and NCOA4, are strong candidates for mediating the effects of rs109939934. In a cohort of 180 individuals, we demonstrate that the rs10993994 risk allele is associated with decreased expression of two MSMB isoforms in histologically normal and malignant prostate tissue. In addition, the risk allele is associated with increased expression of five NCOA4 isoforms in histologically normal prostate tissue only. No consistent association with either gene is observed in breast or colon tissue. In conjunction with these findings, suppression of MSMB expression or NCOA4 overexpression promotes anchorage-independent growth of prostate epithelial cells, but not growth of breast epithelial cells. These data suggest that germline variation at chromosome 10q11 contributes to prostate cancer risk by influencing expression of at least two genes.

We aimed to measure the proportion, quality and relevance of oncology-related articles, and to relate this output to their associated disease burden. By incorporating the impact factor(IF) and Eigenfactor™(EF) into our analysis we also assessed the relationship between these indices and the output under study.  Methods:   All publications in 2007 were retrieved for the 26 most common cancers. The top 20 journals ranked by IF and EF in general medicine and oncology, and the presence of each malignancy within these titles was analysed. Journals publishing most prolifically on each cancer were identified and their impact assessed.  Principal findings:   63260 (PubMed) and 126845 (WoS) entries were generated, respectively. 26 neoplasms accounted for 25% of total output from the top medical publications. 5 cancers dominated the first quartile of output in the top oncology journals; breast, prostate, lung, and intestinal cancer, and leukaemia. Journals associated with these cancers were associated with much higher IFs and EFs than those journals associated with the other cancer types under study, although these measures were not equivalent across all sub-specialties. In addition, yield on each cancer was related to its disease burden as measured by its incidence and prevalence.  Conclusions:   Oncology enjoys disproportionate representation in the more prestigious medical journals. 5 cancers dominate yield, although this attention is justified given their associated disease burden. The commonly used IF and the recently introduced EF do not correlate in the assessment of the preeminent oncology journals, nor at the level of individual malignancies; there is a need to delineate between proxy measures of quality and the relevance of output when assessing its merit.

Methods:   The study population consisted of 104 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer (group I), 55 male patients with other cancers (group II), 30 male patients with nonmalignant diseases (group III) and finally 15 patients with benign prostate hypertrophy (group IV). The square-shaped regions of interest are placed centrally on the scrotum and then on the lateral femoral soft tissue. Then the simple ratios of the scrotal and femoral soft tissue mean counts (S/Bg) were calculated. The statistical significance of differences among the groups in terms of scrotal uptake was determined.  Results:   Group I showed increased scrotal uptake relative to the other groups. The mean uptake ratios (S/Bg±standard deviation) were 3.49±1.42 in group I, 2.89±0.70 in group II, 2.87±0.75 in group III, and 2.91±0.60 in group IV. This ratio was significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer than the normal group (P=0.024), the group with benign prostate hypertrophy (P=0.004), and the patients with other cancers (P=0.004).  Conclusion:   Our results showed that technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy, as a routine for detecting metastatic disease or performed for other purposes, could give clues for a hidden prostate cancer.

Standard Mus musculus laboratory mice lack a functional XPR1 receptor for XMRV and are therefore not a suitable model for the virus. In contrast, Gairdner's shrew-mice (Mus pahari) do express functional XPR1. To determine whether Mus pahari could serve as a model for XMRV, primary Mus pahari fibroblasts and mice were infected with cell-free XMRV. Infection of cells in vitro resulted in XMRV Gag expression and the production of XMRV virions. After intraperitoneal injection of XMRV into Mus pahari mice, XMRV proviral DNA could be detected in spleen, blood, and brain. Intravenous administration of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector pseudotyped with XMRV produced GFP(+) CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells. Mice mounted adaptive immune responses against XMRV, as evidenced by the production of neutralizing and Env- and Gag-specific antibodies. Prominent G-to-A hypermutations were also found in viral genomes isolated from the spleen, suggesting intracellular restriction of XMRV infection by APOBEC3 in vivo. These data demonstrate infection of Mus pahari by XMRV, potential cell tropism of the virus, and immunological and intracellular restriction of virus infection in vivo. These data support the use of Mus pahari as a model for XMRV pathogenesis and as a platform for vaccine and drug development against this potential human pathogen.""","""['Toshie Sakuma', 'Jason M Tonne', 'Karen A Squillace', 'Seiga Ohmine', 'Tayaramma Thatava', 'Kah-Whye Peng', 'Michael A Barry', 'Yasuhiro Ikeda']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['Evolution of functional and sequence variants of the mammalian XPR1 receptor for mouse xenotropic gammaretroviruses and the human-derived retrovirus XMRV.', 'Evaluation of cellular determinants required for in vitro xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus entry into human prostate cancer and noncancerous cells.', 'Infection, viral dissemination, and antibody responses of rhesus macaques exposed to the human gammaretrovirus XMRV.', 'The mouse ""xenotropic"" gammaretroviruses and their XPR1 receptor.', 'The human retrovirus XMRV in prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines-Facts and Hypotheses on Fragmentation and Encapsulation.', 'SARS-CoV-2 and miRNA-like inhibition power.', 'Skin fragility in the wild-derived, inbred mouse strain Mus pahari/EiJ.', 'The saga of XMRV: a virus that infects human cells but is not a human virus.', 'Gammaretrovirus-specific antibodies in free-ranging and captive Namibian cheetahs.']"""

Drugs that enhance or inhibit tubulin polymerization can destroy this dynamic process, arresting cells in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. Although drugs that target tubulin generally demonstrate cytotoxic potency in the subnanomolar range, resistance due to drug efflux is a common phenomenon among the antitubulin agents. We recently reported a class of 4-substituted methoxybenzoyl-aryl-thiazoles (SMART) that exhibited great in vitro potency and broad spectrum cellular cytotoxicity. Evaluation of the in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities of 3 SMART compounds, SMART-H (H), SMART-F (F), and SMART-OH (OH), with varying substituents at the 4-position of aryl ring, demonstrated that they bind potently to the colchicine-binding site in tubulin, inhibit tubulin polymerization, arrest cancer cells in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle, and induce their apoptosis. The SMART compounds also equipotently inhibit the growth of parental and MDR-overexpressing cells in vitro, indicating that they can overcome multidrug resistance. In vivo antitumor efficacy studies in human prostate (PC-3) and melanoma (A375) cancer xenograft models demonstrated that SMART-H and SMART-F treatments resulted in %T/C values ranging from 4% to 30%. In addition, in vivo SMART-H treatment for 21 days at the higher dose (15 mg/kg) failed to produce any apparent neurotoxicity. These studies provide the first in vivo evidence and proof-of-concept that SMART compounds are similarly efficacious to currently FDA approved antitubulin drugs for cancer treatment, but they can circumvent P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance.""","""['Chien-Ming Li', 'Zhao Wang', 'Yan Lu', 'Sunjoo Ahn', 'Ramesh Narayanan', 'Jeffrey D Kearbey', 'Deanna N Parke', 'Wei Li', 'Duane D Miller', 'James T Dalton']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Polymer conjugate of a microtubule destabilizer inhibits lung metastatic melanoma.', 'Pharmacokinetic optimization of 4-substituted methoxybenzoyl-aryl-thiazole and 2-aryl-4-benzoyl-imidazole for improving oral bioavailability.', 'Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics of 4-substituted methoxybenzoyl-aryl-thiazoles.', 'Novel tubulin polymerization inhibitors overcome multidrug resistance and reduce melanoma lung metastasis.', 'A novel bis-indole destabilizes microtubules and displays potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity in prostate cancer.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Stable Colchicine-Binding Site Tubulin Inhibitors 6-Aryl-2-benzoyl-pyridines as Potential Anticancer Agents.', 'New Paracyclophanylthiazoles with Anti-Leukemia Activity: Design, Synthesis, Molecular Docking, and Mechanistic Studies.', 'Potent USP10/13 antagonist spautin-1 suppresses melanoma growth via ROS-mediated DNA damage and exhibits synergy with cisplatin.', 'Recent development of leucyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors as antimicrobial agents.', 'The Melding of Drug Screening Platforms for Melanoma.']"""

However, when incubated with this agent many solid tumor cell lines do not undergo apoptosis. The current study reveals a novel mechanism whereby ABT-737 when added to apoptosis-resistant cancer cells has profound biologic effects. In PV-10 cells, a renal cell carcinoma that does not die after ABT-737 treatment, this agent induces a two-fold change in the transcription of nearly 430 genes. Many of these induced mRNA changes are in secreted proteins, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-11 and chemokines CXCL2 and CXCL5, or genes associated with an ""inflammatory"" phenotype. Strikingly, these gene changes are highly similar to those changes previously identified in cellular senescence. Brief exposure of apoptosis-resistant renal, lung and prostate cancer cell lines to ABT-737, although not capable of inducing cell death, causes the induction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and inhibition of cell growth consistent with the induction of cellular senescence. Evidence indicates that the induction of senescence occurs as a result of reactive oxygen species elevation followed by low-level activation of the caspase cascade, insufficient to induce apoptosis, but sufficient to lead to minor DNA damage and increases in p53, p21, IL-6 and 8 proteins. By overexpression of a dominant-negative p53 protein, we show that ABT-737-induced cellular senescence is p53-dependent. Thus, in multiple cancer types in which ABT-737 is incapable of causing cell death, ABT-737 may have additional cellular activities that make its use as an anticancer agent highly attractive.""","""['Jin H Song', 'Karthikeyan Kandasamy', 'Marina Zemskova', 'Ying-Wei Lin', 'Andrew S Kraft']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['The combination of BH3-mimetic ABT-737 with the alkylating agent temozolomide induces strong synergistic killing of melanoma cells independent of p53.', 'ABT-737 induces expression of the death receptor 5 and sensitizes human cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'Cucurbitacin-I inhibits Aurora kinase A, Aurora kinase B and survivin, induces defects in cell cycle progression and promotes ABT-737-induced cell death in a caspase-independent manner in malignant human glioma cells.', 'Small molecule inhibition of the Bcl-X(L)-BH3 protein-protein interaction: proof-of-concept of an in vivo chemopotentiator ABT-737.', 'Targeting multiple arms of the apoptotic regulatory machinery.', 'Synergistic cytotoxicity of perifosine and ABT-737 to colon cancer cells.', 'Senescence in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells and Atherosclerosis.', 'BH3-mimetics: recent developments in cancer therapy.', 'Apoptosis - Fueling the oncogenic fire.', 'Executioner caspases and CAD are essential for mutagenesis induced by TRAIL or vincristine.']"""

Based on anatomical evidence and requirements of the treatment procedure, a warped and tapered ellipsoid was found suitable as the a-priori 3D shape of the prostate. By transforming the acquired endorectal transverse images of the prostate into ellipses, the shape fitting problem was cast into a convex problem which can be solved efficiently. The average whole gland error between non-overlapping volumes created from manual and semi-automatic contours from 21 patients was 6.63 ± 0.9%. For use in brachytherapy treatment planning, the resulting contours were modified, if deemed necessary, by radiation oncologists prior to treatment. The average whole gland volume error between the volumes computed from semi-automatic contours and those computed from modified contours, from 40 patients, was 5.82 ± 4.15%. The amount of bias in the physicians' delineations when given an initial semi-automatic contour was measured by comparing the volume error between 10 prostate volumes computed from manual contours with those of modified contours. This error was found to be 7.25 ± 0.39% for the whole gland. Automatic contouring reduced subjectivity, as evidenced by a decrease in segmentation inter- and intra-observer variability from 4.65% and 5.95% for manual segmentation to 3.04% and 3.48% for semi-automatic segmentation, respectively. We characterized the performance of the method relative to the reference obtained from manual segmentation by using a novel approach that divides the prostate region into nine sectors. We analyzed each sector independently as the requirements for segmentation accuracy depend on which region of the prostate is considered. The measured segmentation time is 14 ± 1s with an additional 32 ± 14s for initialization. By assuming 1-3 min for modification of the contours, if necessary, a total segmentation time of less than 4 min is required, with no additional time required prior to treatment planning. This compares favorably to the 5-15 min manual segmentation time required for experienced individuals. The method is currently used at the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) Vancouver Cancer Centre as part of the standard treatment routine in low dose rate prostate brachytherapy and is found to be a fast, consistent and accurate tool for the delineation of the prostate gland in ultrasound images.""","""['S Sara Mahdavi', 'Nick Chng', 'Ingrid Spadinger', 'William J Morris', 'Septimiu E Salcudean']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['3D prostate segmentation in ultrasound images based on tapered and deformed ellipsoids.', 'Semiautomatic 3-D prostate segmentation from TRUS images using spherical harmonics.', 'Semiautomatic segmentation for prostate brachytherapy: dosimetric evaluation.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'A review of automatic lung tumour segmentation in the era of 4DCT.', 'A Fusion Biopsy Framework for Prostate Cancer Based on Deformable Superellipses and nnU-Net.', 'Automatic zonal segmentation of the prostate from 2D and 3D T2-weighted MRI and evaluation for clinical use.', 'Ultrasound prostate segmentation based on multidirectional deeply supervised V-Net.', 'Prostate zonal segmentation in 1.5T and 3T T2W MRI using a convolutional neural network.', 'Prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound using magnetic resonance imaging priors.']"""

Level of evidence:   1b. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? In general the literature suggests that there is a need for improvement in aiding men diagnosed with early prostate cancer in their decision making about treatment options and that our understanding of this process is inadequate. There is limited data analyzing the reasons why these men decide between potentially curative or observational treatments and data evaluating patients' views before and after definitive therapy are scarce. This study begins the process of understanding the reasons underlying a patient's final treatment decision. Being a prospective study, it looks at the thought processes of these men before treatment during the time the decision is made. It also documents how satisfied patients are with their choice after their treatment and whether they would choose the same treatment again.  Objective:   To identify the reasons for patients with localised prostate cancer choosing between treatments and the relationship of procedure type to patient satisfaction post-treatment.  Patients and methods:   768 men with prostate cancer (stage T1/2, Gleason≤7, PSA<20 ug/L) chose between four treatments: radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, conformal radiotherapy and active surveillance. Prior to choosing, patients were counselled by a urological surgeon, clinical (radiation) oncologist and uro-oncology specialist nurse. Pre-treatment reasons for choice were recorded. Post-treatment satisfaction was examined via postal questionnaire.  Results:   Of the 768 patients, 305 (40%) chose surgery, 237 (31%) conformal beam radiotherapy, 165 (21%) brachytherapy and 61 (8%) active surveillance. Sixty percent of men who opted for radical prostatectomy were motivated by the need for physical removal of the cancer. Conformal radiotherapy was mainly chosen by patients who feared other treatments (n=63, 27%). Most men chose brachytherapy because it was more convenient for their lifestyle (n=64, 39%). Active surveillance was chosen by patients for more varied reasons. Post-treatment satisfaction was assessed in a subgroup who took part in the QOL aspect of this study. Of the respondents to the questionnaire, 212(87.6%) stated that they were satisfied/extremely satisfied with their choice and 171(92.9%) indicated they would choose the same treatment again.  Conclusion:   Men with early prostate cancer have clear reasons for making decisions about treatment. Overall, patients were satisfied with the treatment and indicated that despite different reasons for choosing treatment, they would make the same choice again.""","""['Carmel N Anandadas', 'Noel W Clarke', 'Susan E Davidson', ""Patrick H O'Reilly"", 'John P Logue', 'Lynne Gilmore', 'Ric Swindell', 'Richard J Brough', 'Guy D Wemyss-Holden', 'Maurice W Lau', 'Pradip M Javle', 'Vijay A C Ramani', 'James P Wylie', 'Gerald N Collins', 'Stephen Brown', 'Richard A Cowan;North West Uro-oncology Group']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Early prostate cancer-which treatment do men prefer and why?', 'Choice between prostatectomy and radiotherapy when men are eligible for both: a randomized controlled trial of usual care vs decision aid.', 'Why patients choose prostatectomy or brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer: results of a descriptive survey.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy, or radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer: study design and diagnostic and baseline results of the ProtecT randomised phase 3 trial.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Steering a Tendon-Driven Needle in High-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy for Patients with Pubic Arch Interference.', 'Development and Validation of Dynamic Multivariate Prediction Models of Sexual Function Recovery in Patients with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: Results from the MUSIC Statewide Collaborative.', 'Psychological predictors of delayed active treatment following active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer: The Patient REported outcomes for Prostate cARE prospective cohort study.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy as monotherapy for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer: long-term experience of Swedish single-center.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer (mirage): a phase iii randomized trial.']"""

Patients were considered 'untreated' if no ZA was given, 'early ZA-treated' if ZA was initiated before skeletal complication (SC) occurrence or 'late ZA-treated' if one or more SC was documented before or at ZA initiation. Patients were classified with short (≤ 90 days), medium (91-180 days) or long (>180 days) treatment persistence. Assessments included follow-up duration (FUP) and risk of developing one or more SC.  Results:   Among eligible patients, 847 were untreated, 243 were early ZA-treated and 218 were late ZA-treated.

Standard logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazard models that assess the combined effect of multiple variants on disease risk assume multiplicative joint effects of the variants, but this assumption may not be correct. The risk model chosen may affect the predictive accuracy of genomic profiling. We investigated the discriminative accuracy of genomic profiling by comparing additive and multiplicative risk models. We examined genomic profiles of 40 variants with genotype frequencies varying from 0.1 to 0.4 and relative risks varying from 1.1 to 1.5 in separate scenarios assuming a disease risk of 10%. The discriminative accuracy was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Predicted risks were more extreme at the lower and higher risks for the multiplicative risk model compared with the additive model. The discriminative accuracy was consistently higher for multiplicative risk models than for additive risk models. The differences in discriminative accuracy were negligible when the effect sizes were small (<1.2), but were substantial when risk genotypes were common or when they had stronger effects.

Changes in the IVDT curves before and after target replacement were measured. Two clinical treatment sites, pelvis and prostate, were selected to study the dosimetric impact of this variation. Dose was recalculated on the MVCTs with the planned fluence using IVDT curves acquired before and after target change. For the cases studied, target replacement resulted in an overall difference of less than 5%, which can be significant for hypo-fractionated cases.

We also checked the MUs for the RapidArc plans by using independent software (RadCalc).

The average agreement was 94.4% for the DTA approach and 96.3% for the gamma index approach. In high-dose areas, the discrepancy between calculations and ion chamber measurements using the QUASAR phantom was within 4.5% for prostate cases. For the RadCalc calculations, we used the average SSD along the arc; however, for some patients the agreement for the MUs obtained with RadCalc versus Eclipse was inadequate (discrepancy > 5%). In these cases, the plan was divided into partial arc plans so that RadCalc could perform a better estimation of the MUs. The discrepancy was further reduced to within ~4% using this approach.

In this paper, we present a dose calculation algorithm that approaches these goals. By decomposing the infinitesimal pencil beam (IPB) kernel into the central axis (CAX) component and lateral spread function (LSF) and taking the beam's eye view (BEV), we established a non-voxel and non-beamlet-based dose calculation formula. Both LSF and CAX are determined by a commissioning procedure using the collapsed-cone convolution/superposition (CCCS) method as the standard dose engine. The proposed dose calculation involves a 2D convolution of a fluence map with LSF followed by ray tracing based on the CAX lookup table with radiological distance and divergence correction, resulting in complexity of O(N(3)) both spatially and temporally. This simple algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the CCCS method. Without pre-calculation of beamlets, its implementation is also orders of magnitude smaller than the conventional voxel-based beamlet-superposition (VBS) approach. We compared the presented algorithm with the CCCS method using simulated and clinical cases.

This study focuses on the IL-6/ERK transduction pathway, its relationship with NF-κB, and the consequences of dysregulation in the development of prostate pathologies such as benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses for IL-6, gp-130, Raf-1, MEK-1, ERK-1, p-MEK, ERK-2, p-ERK, NF-κB/p-50 and NF-κB/p-65 were carried out in 20 samples of normal prostate glands, 35 samples of BPH, 27 samples with a diagnosis of PIN (low-grade PIN or high-grade PIN), and 95 samples of PC (23 with low, 51 with medium and 21 with high Gleason scores).  Results:   Immunoreaction to IL-6, gp-130, ERK-1, ERK-2, p-ERK and NF-κB/p50 was found in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in normal prostate samples; p-MEK was found in the nucleus of epithelial cells; but not expression to Raf-1, MEK-1 and NF-κB/p65. In BPH, all of these proteins were immunoexpressed, while there was increased immunoexpression of IL-6, gp-130, p-MEK, ERK-1, ERK-2 and NF-κB/p50 (cytoplasm). In PC, immunoexpression of IL-6 and gp-130 were similar to that found in BPH; while immunoexpression of Raf-1, MEK-1, p-MEK, ERK-1, ERK-2, p-ERK, NF-κB/p50 (nucleus and cytoplasm), and NF-κB/p65 (nucleus and cytoplasm) was higher than in BPH.  Conclusion:   Translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus in PC and high-grade PIN could be stimulated by the IL-6/ERK transduction pathway, but might also be stimulated by other transduction pathways, such as TNF-α/NIK, TNF/p38, IL-1/NIK or IL-1/p38. Activation of NF-κB in PC could regulate IL-6 expression. These transduction pathways are also related to activation of other transcription factors such as Elk-1, ATF-2 or c-myc (also involved in cell proliferation and survival). PC is a heterogeneous disease, where multiple transduction pathways might alter the apoptosis/proliferation balance. Significant attention should be give to the combination of novel agents directed towards inactivation of pro-inflammatory cytokines than can disrupt tumour cell growth.""","""['Gonzalo Rodríguez-Berriguete', 'Angela Prieto', 'Benito Fraile', 'Yosra Bouraoui', 'Fermín R de Bethencourt', 'Pilar Martínez-Onsurbe', 'Gabriel Olmedilla', 'Ricardo Paniagua', 'Mar Royuela']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur Cytokine Netw""","""['TNF/IL-1/NIK/NF-kappa B transduction pathway: a comparative study in normal and pathological human prostate (benign hyperplasia and carcinoma).', 'The p38 transduction pathway in prostatic neoplasia.', 'Role of IAPs in prostate cancer progression: immunohistochemical study in normal and pathological (benign hyperplastic, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer) human prostate.', 'TNF-alpha/IL-1/NF-kappaB transduction pathway in human cancer prostate.', 'Recent insights into NF-κB signalling pathways and the link between inflammation and prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy of Buzhong Yiqi decoction on benign prostatic hyperplasia and its possible mechanism.', 'Unravelling the Role of Kinases That Underpin Androgen Signalling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Effective Targeting of Raf-1 and Its Associated Autophagy by Novel Extracted Peptide for Treating Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Growth and differentiation factor 15 and NF-κB expression in benign prostatic biopsies and risk of subsequent prostate cancer detection.', 'Localization of interleukin-6 signaling complex in epithelialized apical lesions of endodontic origin.']"""

In South Africa white men have the highest incidence of prostate cancer (PCa), coloured (mixed ancestry) men have an intermediate incidence, and low incidences are reported for black and Asian men. It has been suggested that ethnic differences in incidence and mortality of PCa are related to genetic variations in genes that regulate androgen metabolism. We investigated the role of genetic variants in the androgen metabolism genes and the probability of developing PCa in South African coloured and white men. Methods. Genotype and allele counts and frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP3A5, CYP3A4 and CYP3A43 were assessed in coloured men (160 case individuals, 146 control individuals) and white men (121 case individuals, 141 control individuals). Results. A genetic association indicating an increased probability of developing PCa was observed with the G allele of the SNP rs2740574 in CYP3A4 in coloured men, the A allele of rs776746 (CYP3A5) and the G allele of rs2740574 (CYP3A4) in white men, and the G allele of rs2740574 and the C allele of rs501275 (CYP3A43) in the combined ethnic groups analysis. In addition, we identified allele combinations (termed haplotypes) with significantly higher frequencies in the PCa case individuals than in the control individuals. Conclusions. The findings support the role of variants in genes that regulate androgen metabolism and the probability of developing PCa.

Thus, it is a promising target for therapeutic intervention. In the present study, the cytotoxic action of the Akt inhibitor Erufosine (ErPC3) was analyzed in prostate cancer cells and compared to the cytotoxicity of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Moreover, the efficacy of combined treatment with Akt inhibitors and ionizing radiation in prostate cancer cells was examined.  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145, and LNCaP were treated with ErPC3 (1-100 µM), LY294002 (25-100 µM), irradiated (0-10 Gy), or subjected to combined treatments. Cell viability was determined by the WST-1 assay. Apoptosis induction was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide in a hypotonic citrate buffer, and by Western blotting using antibodies against caspase-3 and its substrate PARP. Akt activity and regulation of the expression of Bcl-2 family members and key downstream effectors involved in apoptosis regulation were examined by Western blot analysis.  Results:   The Akt inhibitor ErPC3 exerted anti-neoplastic effects in prostate cancer cells, however with different potency. The anti-neoplastic action of ErPC3 was associated with reduced phosphoserine 473-Akt levels and induction of apoptosis. PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells were also sensitive to treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. However, the ErPC3-sensitive PC3-cells were less susceptible to LY294002 than the ErPC3-refractory LNCaP cells. Although both cell lines were largely resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis, both cell lines showed higher levels of apoptotic cell death when ErPC3 was combined with radiotherapy.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that constitutive Akt activation and survival are controlled by different different molecular mechanisms in the two prostate cancer cell lines - one which is sensitive to the Akt-inhibitor ErPC3 and one which is more sensitive to the PI3K-inhibitor LY294002.

UTR mRNA and protein, evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively, were expressed at high levels only in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. In order to investigate UTR changes occurring in human prostate tumorigenesis, we have also evaluated the expression of UTR in vivo in 195 human prostate tissue samples. UTR was always expressed at low intensity in hyperplastic tissues and at high intensity in well-differentiated carcinomas (Gleason 2-3). Moreover, we have evaluated the effects of an antagonist of UTR, urantide on migration and invasion of LNCaP cells. Urantide induced a dose-dependent decrease of motility and invasion of LNCaP cells whose characteristic ameboid movement seems to be advantageous for their malignancy. These effects were paralleled by down-regulating the autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and the integrin surface expression on LNCaP cells.

Kriging was used to predict average uranium concentrations within tracts. The relationship between uranium and standardized cancer incidence ratios was modeled among tracts with substantial groundwater use via linear or semiparametric regression, with and without stratification by the proportion of African Americans in each area.  Results:   A total of 134,685 cancer cases were evaluated. Tracts with ≥50% groundwater use and uranium concentrations in the upper quartile had increased risks for colorectal, breast, kidney, prostate, and total cancer compared to referent tracts.

Methods:   We reviewed the charts of 3,087 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center between 2000 and 2008; of which 1,747 patients had data sufficient for analysis. Prostate specimens were processed as whole mount between 2000 and 2003 and then via systematic sampling from 2003 to 2008, with tumor volume measured by planimetry in the whole-mount group and tumor volume estimated by percent tumor involvement in the systematic sampling group.  Results:   Tumor volume estimates were higher with SS than with WM. There were significant associations between larger tumor volume and adverse pathological outcomes, regardless of pathologic method (all with P<0.001). Controlling for other pathologic parameters, tumor volume was an independent predictor of PGS, EPE, and SM in logistic regression models (P<0.001 for TV in all models). Tumor volume was demonstrated to be an independent predictor of BCR in the WM group (1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11, P=0.013), though tumor volume was not a significant predictor of BCR in the SS group.

The best characterized are TU-1 and TU-1A: TU-1 is responsible for producing plasma SHBG, while TU-1A is transcribed and translated in the testis. Transcription of the recently described TU-1B, -1C, and -1D has been demonstrated in human prostate tissue and prostate cancer cell lines, as well as in other human cell lines such as HeLa, HepG2, HeK 293, CW 9019 and imr 32. However, there are no reported data demonstrating their translation. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether TU-1A and TU-1B are indeed translated in the human prostate and whether 5' UTR exons 1A and 1B differently regulate SHBG translation.  Results:   Cis-regulatory elements that could potentially regulate translation were identified within the 5'UTRs of SHBG TU-1A and TU-1B. Although full-length SHBG TU-1A and TU-1B mRNAs were present in prostate cancer cell lines, the endogenous SHBG protein was not detected by western blot in any of them. LNCaP prostate cancer cells transfected with several SHBG constructs containing exons 2 to 8 but lacking the 5'UTR sequence did show SHBG translation, whereas inclusion of the 5'UTR sequences of either exon 1A or 1B caused a dramatic decrease in SHBG protein levels. The molecular weight of SHBG did not vary between cells transfected with constructs with or without the 5'UTR sequence, thus confirming that the first in-frame ATG of exon 2 is the translation start site of TU-1A and TU-1B.  Conclusions:   The use of alternative SHBG first exons 1A and 1B differentially inhibits translation from the ATG situated in exon 2, which codes for methionine 30 of transcripts that begin with the exon 1 sequence.""","""['Tomàs Pinós', 'Anna Barbosa-Desongles', 'Antoni Hurtado', 'Albert Santamaria-Martínez', 'Inés de Torres', 'Jaume Reventós', 'Francina Munell']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Identification, characterization and expression of novel Sex Hormone Binding Globulin alternative first exons in the human prostate.', 'The untranslated exon B of human surfactant protein A2 mRNAs is an enhancer for transcription and translation.', ""Differentially expressed three non-coding alternate exons at 5' UTR of regulatory type I beta subunit gene of mouse."", ""The Functional Meaning of 5'UTR in Protein-Coding Genes."", 'Unique regulation of expression of human aromatase in the placenta.', 'The elusive MAESTRO gene: Its human reproductive tissue-specific expression pattern.', 'Identification of microRNA profiles in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells during metastatic progression.']"""

Surgery is often required to control symptoms. It has been hypothesized that long-term administration of a nonamplifiable pure androgen might decrease prostate growth, thereby decreasing or delaying the need for surgical intervention.  Objective:   To test the hypothesis that dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a nonamplifiable and nonaromatizable pure androgen, reduces late-life prostate growth in middle-aged men.  Design:   Randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN12605000358640) SETTING: Ambulatory care research center.  Participants:   Healthy men (n = 114) older than 50 years without known prostate disease.  Intervention:   Transdermal DHT (70 mg) or placebo gel daily for 2 years.  Measurements:   Prostate volume was measured by ultrasonography; bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; and blood samples and questionnaires were collected every 6 months, with data analyzed by mixed-model analysis for repeated measures.  Results:   Over 24 months, there was an increase in total (29% [95% CI, 23% to 34%]) and central (75% [CI, 64% to 86%]; P < 0.01) prostate volume and serum prostate-specific antigen level (15% [CI, 6% to 24%]) with time on study, but DHT had no effect (P > 0.2). Dihydrotestosterone treatment decreased spinal BMD (1.4% [CI, 0.6% to 2.3%]; P < 0.001) at 24 months but not hip BMD (P > 0.2) and increased serum aminoterminal propeptide of type I procollagen in the second year of the study compared with placebo. Dihydrotestosterone increased serum DHT levels and its metabolites (5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol and 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol) and suppressed serum testosterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels. Dihydrotestosterone increased hemoglobin levels (7% [CI, 5% to 9%]), serum creatinine levels (9% [CI, 5% to 11%]), and lean mass (2.4% [CI, 1.6% to 3.1%) but decreased fat mass (5.2% [CI, 2.6% to 7.7%]) (P <0.001 for all). Protocol-specific discontinuations due to DHT were asymptomatic increased hematocrit (n = 8), which resolved after stopping treatment, and increased prostate-specific antigen levels (n = 3; none with prostate cancer) in the DHT group. No serious adverse effects due to DHT occurred.  Limitation:   Negative findings on prostate growth cannot exclude adverse effects on the natural history of prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   Dihydrotestosterone treatment for 24 months has no beneficial or adverse effect on prostate growth but causes a decrease in spinal but not hip BMD. These findings have important implications for the wider use of nonsteroidal pure androgens in older men.

Patients and methods:   Long-term CRC survivors (≥5 years) from five completed NSABP trials (Protocols C-05, C-06, C-07, R-02, and R-03) at 60 study sites were recruited and surveyed using preventive health care items from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). A 3:1 comparison cohort case-matched by age, sex, race, and education was created from the 2005 NHIS. Contingency tables and multivariate models were used to compare cohorts and determine predictors of preventive care and cancer surveillance.  Results:   A total of 708 patients in protocol LTS-01 (681 patients with colon cancer, 27 patients with rectal cancer) completed the interview: 57.1% male, mean age 66.2 years (standard deviation=10.6), median survival 8 years. Patients in the LTS-01 protocol were more likely to have a usual source of health care (97.7% v 93.8%, P<.0001), have received a flu shot in the past 12 months (67.5% v 44.3%, P<.0001), and have undergone cancer screening by Pap smear (67.3% v 54.8%, P<.0001), mammogram (80.4% v 70.7%, P<.0001), and prostate-specific antigen test (84.5% v 74.5%, P<.0001) than patients in the NHIS cohort. For CRC surveillance, 96.5% of patients in protocol LTS-01 had a colonoscopy, 88.2% had a carcinoembryonic antigen test, and 66.4% had a computed tomography scan in the previous 5 years. Health insurance was the best predictor of cancer screening for all three methods (odds ratio=2.6 to 4.5). No factor was uniformly associated with CRC surveillance.

Here we report that the lipid peroxidation end product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) significantly potentiates the anti-tumor effects of the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) in the PC3 prostate cancer cell model. Panobinostat and HNE inhibited proliferation of PC3 cells and the combination of the two agents resulted in a significant combined effect. Cell cycle analysis revealed that both single agents and, to a greater extent, their combined treatment induced G2/M arrest, but cell death occurred in the combined treatment only. Furthermore, HNE and, to a greater extent, the combined treatment induced dephosphorylation of Cdc2 leading to progression into mitosis as confirmed by α-tubulin/DAPI staining and phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) analysis. To evaluate possible induction of DNA damage we utilized the marker phosphorylated histone H2A.X. Results showed that the combination of panobinostat and HNE induced significant DNA damage concomitant with the mitotic arrest. Then, by using androgen receptor (AR)-expressing PC3 cells we observed that the responsiveness to HNE and panobinostat was independent of the expression of functional AR.

The anatomical schema is a helpful tool to document PCa extension for clinical and research purposes. To achieve electronic documentation and analysis, an appropriate documentation model for anatomical schemas is needed. For this purpose we developed cMDX.  Methods:   The document architecture of cMDX was designed according to Open Packaging Conventions by separating the whole data into template data and patient data. Analogue custom XML elements were considered to harmonize the graphical representation (e.g. tumour extension) with the textual data (e.g. histological patterns). The graphical documentation was based on the four-layer visualization model that forms the interaction between different custom XML elements. Sensible personal data were encrypted with a 256-bit cryptographic algorithm to avoid misuse. In order to assess the clinical value, we retrospectively analysed the tumour extension in 255 patients after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   The pathology report with cMDX can represent pathological findings of the prostate in schematic styles. Such reports can be integrated into the hospital information system. ""cMDX"" documents can be converted into different data formats like text, graphics and PDF. Supplementary tools like cMDX Editor and an analyser tool were implemented. The graphical analysis of 255 prostatectomy specimens showed that PCa were mostly localized in the peripheral zone (Mean: 73% ± 25). 54% of PCa showed a multifocal growth pattern.

However, most EOC patients still suffer relapses, and there is an immediate need for the development of novel and more effective therapeutic modalities against this deadly disease. Recently, the nonpeptide bradykinin (BK) antagonist 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorocinnamoyl-(o-2,6-dichlorobenzyl)-l-tyrosine-N-(4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidyl) amide (BKM-570) was shown to cause impressive growth inhibition of lung and prostate tumors, displaying superior in vivo inhibitory effects than convential chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we investigated BKM-570 cytotoxic effects in two EOC cell lines, derived from different EOC histopathologies: a clear cell carcinoma (TOV-21), and an endometrioid carcinoma (TOV-112). We showed that BKM-570 effectively inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer cells, as its cytotoxic effects were comparable to those of cisplatin, and were independent of the functional status of BK receptors. Moreover, BKM-570 synergized with cisplatin in inhibiting EOC cell growth. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of the antiproliferative action of this BK antagonist in EOC cells, we performed gene expression profiling in TOV-21 and TOV-112 cells following treatment with 10 μM BKM-570 for 24 h. BKM-570 displayed similar cytotoxic effects in the two cell lines analyzed, as genes with previously shown involvement in apoptosis/antiapoptosis and cell adhesion were proportionally upregulated and downregulated in both cell lines, whereas genes involved in basic cellular mechanisms, including cell growth and maintenance, metabolism, cell cycle control, inflammatory and immune response, signal transduction, protein biosynthesis, transcription regulation, and transport, were predominantly downregulated upon treatment.

The reduction in or the loss of the cell-cell adhesion often characterizes epithelial tumor initiation and progression. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the LH-RH analogue Leuprorelin acetate (LA), alone or associated with Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), on the expression of the adhesion proteins E-cadherin, α-, β- and γ-catenin in androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3 and DU-145) prostate cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting on cells treated for 48 h with LA (10-11 or 10-6 M) and 10-9 M DHT, alone or combined. RESULTS. In LNCaP cells, all the above mentioned molecules are expressed. PC-3 cells lack α-catenin, while DU-145 cells only express β- and γ-catenin. In both LNCaP and PC-3 cells two truncated forms (97 and 35 kDa) of E-cadherin are present other than the functional protein (120 kDa). In LNCaP cells, no significant changes in E-cadherin (120 and 97 kDa) level were produced by DHT, while the 35 kDa fragment was reduced by 34%. LA increased the full length E-cadherin (26-30%) as well as the two fragments (30-49%). The addition of DHT to LA significantly reduced the analogue-induced E-cadherin raising. In LNCaP cells β- and γ-catenin were up-regulated either by DHT (24% and 20%, respectively) or LA (up to 18% and up to 40%, respectively), while the expression of α-catenin was not modified. The combined DHT/LA treatment results in a less marked increase in β- and γ-catenin levels. In PC-3 cells no changes in adhesion molecule expression were produced by LA treatment, while in DU-145 cells the analogue determined an appreciable reduction in β- (20%) and γ-catenin (up to 35%) levels.  Conclusions:   The up-regulation of E-cadherin, β- and γ-catenin in LNCaP cells by LA may be considered as another feature of the direct antitumor LH-RH analogue activity, as it may contribute to the maintenance/restoration of the normal architecture of prostate epithelium. The LA-induced modifications of catenins in DU-145 cells are worth some further investigations.""","""['D Angelucci', 'F Iacopino', 'G Sica']""","""[]""","""2007""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['Leuprorelin acetate affects adhesion molecule expression in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Apoptosis-related gene expression affected by a GnRH analogue without induction of programmed cell death in LNCaP cells.', 'In vitro modulation of tumor progression-associated properties of hormone refractory prostate carcinoma cell lines by cytokines.', 'Reduction of E-cadherin levels and deletion of the alpha-catenin gene in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Leuprorelin acetate affects ERK1/2 activity in prostate cancer cells.']"""

Measures:   Content analyses were conducted with 83 interviews. The interview tapped into the following domains: barriers, risk perception, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, and intentions.  Results:   57 men regarded their health as very important, while 47 had never utilized cancer screenings. Barriers were divided into emotional/cognitive versus organizational/structural. Sixty-four men did not utilize cancer screenings because of lack of symptoms, 22 feared a positive result, 20 had more pertinent health issues, and 18 assumed that their physicians would screen for cancer ""automatically.""  Conclusions:   Mainly emotional/cognitive barriers were seen as important for nonutilization, especially the absence of symptoms. Following the reasoning of social-cognitive models, a first step to enhance utilization rates would be to enhance risk perception.""","""['Wolfgang Hannöver', 'David Köpke', 'Hans-Joachim Hannich']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Public Health Nurs""","""['Barriers to prostate cancer screening: psychological aspects and descriptive variables---is there a correlation?', 'Development and validation of health beliefs model scale for prostate cancer screenings (HBM-PCS): evidence from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.', 'Risk perception and concern among brothers of men with prostate carcinoma.', 'Psychosocial consequences of prostate cancer: 30 years of research.', 'The physician-patient working alliance.', 'Prostate care and prostate cancer from the perspectives of undiagnosed men: a systematic review of qualitative research.', ""Men's perspectives of prostate cancer screening: A systematic review of qualitative studies."", 'Understanding preventive behaviors among mid-Western African-American men: a pilot qualitative study of prostate screening.']"""

Management of high-risk disease with robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is controversial. We examined biochemical recurrence in a selected cohort of high-risk patients who were undergoing RALP.  Patients and methods:   Men with high-risk prostate cancer who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing, nonsalvage RALP by a single surgeon without adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy of any kind were identified. High risk was defined by preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >10 ng/dL, Gleason score ≥8 on final pathologic evaluation, or stage ≥pT(3). Postoperative PSA value ≥0.2 ng/dL defined biochemical recurrence.  Results:   A total of 73 men were identified. There was no significant difference in surgical margin positivity (38% overall) or prostate size between recurrence and nonrecurrence cohorts. Biochemical failure was significantly associated with higher pathologic Gleason score (P = 0.0085) but not pathologic stage (P = 0.22) or preoperative PSA level (P = 0.18). With follow-up to 85 months (mean 31.8 mos), biochemical recurrence-free survival was 77% with mean time to recurrence of 7.7 months. Recurrence occurred significantly earlier than later (P < 0.001).

Since curative-intended therapies are bound up with the risk of severe adverse events, identification of new prognostic markers in PC is essential in individualized clinical treatment. The Smarcc1 protein, a part of the intranuclear SWI/SNF complex, is up-regulated in PC, and has been suggested to be implicated in tumour dedifferentiation, progression and biochemical recurrence. This makes Smarcc1 a possible candidate marker for PC survival.  Material and methods:   Immunohistochemistry was used to measure protein expression levels of Smarcc1in on a tissue microarray containing specimens from 100 patients suffering from clinically localized PC treated with no intention to cure and followed to death.  Results:   The median age at diagnosis was 75.5 years (55-95 years) and the median survival time was 5 years (0.01-15 years). In total, 41 patients (41%) died of PC. Statistically, there was no significant association between Smarcc1 immunostaining (negative/positive) and Gleason score (p = 0.7/0.8) or the clinical T stage (p = 0.9). Positive staining for Smarcc1 in patients with clinically localized PC correlated with a prolonged disease-free survival as opposed to negative staining (p = 0.025).

How this affects the burden of treatment-related side-effects is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment related morbidity following radical prostatectomy in men participating in the Göteborg randomised population-based prostate cancer screening trial.  Methods:   In 1995, 20,000 men aged 50-64 years were randomly allocated (1:1) to biennial PSA-screening or to a control group not invited. A subset of prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2001 and 2008 responded to questionnaires preoperatively and at 18 months postoperatively. The primary endpoint was patient-reported frequencies of erectile dysfunction as measured by the validated International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaire and urinary incontinence as assessed by use of pads. Analyses were made according to intention to screen.  Findings:   After 14 years of follow-up, a total of 1849 men were detected with prostate cancer (1138 screened versus 711 controls, excluding 7 cancers detected at autopsy in the control group). Overall, 1047 received treatment with curative intent and radical prostatectomy was performed in 829 cases (79.2%). In this study, 294 of these men participated (205 screened and 89 controls). Of preoperatively potent men 79.1% (91/115) in the screening-group and 90.7% (49/54) in the control-group became impotent or sexually inactive 18 months postoperatively, whereas 14.3% (29/203) of screened men and 20.5% (18/88) of controls were considered postoperatively incontinent (regular use of pads). Extrapolated data yields that 120/10,000 more men become impotent and 25/10,000 more men will have the need of pads among men invited to regular PSA screening. The 'cost' per life saved at the same follow-up of screening is four men impotent and less than one man incontinent.  Interpretation:   Despite the relatively high risk of erectile dysfunction and incontinence following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, the excess burden of permanent side-effects after population-based screening can be regarded as relatively low, when related to the number of men saved from prostate cancer death. These data can be useful when calculating the harms and benefits of screening.

Perhaps, the most prevalent antimicrotubule strategy involves docetaxel administration at its maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). Although the goal is to obtain total eradication of cancer cells, debilitating toxicities are presented by docetaxel therapy, including myelosuppression, immunosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity and peripheral neuropathy. In addition, solubility limitations necessitate infusion of high-doses intravenously once or twice a week followed by a rest period, which allows recovery of normal proliferating cells to counter-balance efficacy. An emerging notion is that more of a toxic drug at its MTD is not necessarily better. It is likely that combinatorial antimicrotubule therapy with drugs occupying different sites on tubulin may enhance efficacy while reducing toxicity. Here we show that bromonoscapine (EM011), a microtubule-modulating noscapine analog, displays synergism with docetaxel as seen by cell viability and proliferation assays. Cell-cycle data demonstrated that lower dose-levels of docetaxel (25nM) in combination with EM011 caused an additive increase in proapoptotic activity. Since docetaxel alone caused severe mitotic arrest followed by mitotic slippage and endoreduplication, we strategized a sequential treatment regime that involved initial pretreatment with docetaxel followed by addition of EM011 to maximize mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis. In vivo studies with docetaxel and EM011 in combination showed a marked inhibition of tumor growth compared to docetaxel or EM011 as single-agents. Our studies suggest the potential usefulness of EM011 in the clinic to enhance docetaxel activity. This would reduce toxicity, thus improving the quality of life of docetaxel-treated patients.""","""['Vaishali Pannu', 'Prasanthi Karna', 'Hari Krishna Sajja', 'Deep Shukla', 'Ritu Aneja']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Prostate cancer: Synergistic sequential enhancement of docetaxel.', 'A novel microtubule-modulating agent induces mitochondrially driven caspase-dependent apoptosis via mitotic checkpoint activation in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular cycloencapsulation augments solubility and improves therapeutic index of brominated noscapine in prostate cancer cells.', 'Drug-resistant T-lymphoid tumors undergo apoptosis selectively in response to an antimicrotubule agent, EM011.', 'Efficacy and Safety of Combined Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) and Docetaxel Compared with ADT Alone for Metastatic Hormone-Naive Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Paclitaxel and docetaxel in prostate cancer.', 'Clinically Applicable Inhibitors Impacting Genome Stability.', 'Noscapine chemosensitization enhances docetaxel anticancer activity and nanocarrier uptake in triple negative breast cancer.', 'The Noscapine Chronicle: A Pharmaco-Historic Biography of the Opiate Alkaloid Family and its Clinical Applications.', 'Synergistic combination of novel tubulin inhibitor ABI-274 and vemurafenib overcome vemurafenib acquired resistance in BRAFV600E melanoma.', 'Ginger phytochemicals exhibit synergy to inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation.']"""

Because of mostly inconsistent results of epidemiological studies, we examined the association between intake of HCA and prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   In the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort, detailed information on diet, anthropometry, and lifestyle was assessed between 1994 and 1998. Dietary HCA intake was estimated using information on meat consumption, cooking methods, and preferred degree of browning. During 104,195 person-years of follow-up, 337 incident cases of prostate cancer (123 advanced cases) were identified among 9,578 men with valid dietary information. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between intake of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-3,4,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) and prostate cancer.  Results:   Men in the highest quartiles of PhIP, MeIQx, and DiMeIQx intake, respectively, had no increased risk of prostate cancer compared with men in the lowest quartiles (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.66-1.22 [PhIP]; 1.06, 0.77-1.45 [MeIQx]; 0.98, 0.72-1.34 [DiMeIQx]).

We examined the effects of lycopene and fish oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveillance for low-burden prostate cancer. We hypothesized that lycopene or fish oil supplements would down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) gene expression, respectively, reflecting putative proliferation (IGF-1) and inflammatory (COX-2) pathways relevant to carcinogenesis.  Methods:   We conducted a 3-month randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene expression profiles (assessed by qRT-PCR) among men with favorable-risk prostate cancer receiving either 30 mg/day lycopene, 3 g/day fish oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acids) or placebo.  Results:   Among 69 men (22 assigned to lycopene, 21 to fish, and 26 to placebo), there was no difference in the change from baseline to the 3 months in IGF-1 expression level between the placebo and lycopene arms (p = 0.93) nor in COX-2 expression between the placebo and fish arms (p = 0.99).  Conclusion:   Compared to placebo, 3-month intervention with lycopene or fish oil did not significantly change IGF-1 and COX-2 gene expression in the normal prostate microenvironment in men with low-burden prostate cancer.

The UPN represents a key factor in the maintenance of cellular homoeostasis as a result of its fundamental function in the regulation of intracellular protein degradation. Members of this network have a role in the biology of haematological and solid tumours. Tumour cells and normal epithelial cells from 22 prostatectomy specimens were isolated by laser microdissection. Prostate biopsy samples from healthy individuals served for technical calibration and as controls. Transcript levels of eight selected genes with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (labelling target proteins for proteasome degradation) and two genes belonging to the proteasome-multienzyme complex itself were analysed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The proteasome genes PSMC4 and PSMB5 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L were significantly and coherently upregulated in PCA cells compared with the corresponding adjacent normal prostate tissue. Transcription of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 was significantly higher in organ-confined tumours (pT2) compared with non-organ-confined cancers (pT3). The results indicate a role for PSMC4 and PSMB5 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L in prostate tumourigenesis, whereas SMURF2 downregulation could be associated with clinical progression. NEDD4L and SMURF2 both target transforming growth factor (TGF)-β for degradation. This reflects the pleiotropic role of the TGF-β signalling pathway acting as a tumour suppressor in normal and pre-cancerous cells, but having oncogenic properties in progressing cancer.

Here, we have identified a critical role for RB in protecting against tumor progression through regulation of targets distinct from cell cycle control. In analyses of human prostate cancer samples, RB loss was infrequently observed in primary disease and was predominantly associated with transition to the incurable, castration-resistant state. Further analyses revealed that loss of the RB1 locus may be a major mechanism of RB disruption and that loss of RB function was associated with poor clinical outcome. Modeling of RB dysfunction in vitro and in vivo revealed that RB controlled nuclear receptor networks critical for tumor progression and that it did so via E2F transcription factor 1-mediated regulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression and output. Through this pathway, RB depletion induced unchecked AR activity that underpinned therapeutic bypass and tumor progression. In agreement with these findings, disruption of the RB/E2F/nuclear receptor axis was frequently observed in the transition to therapy resistance in human disease.

Accordingly, preclinical studies suggest the potential of β-PDGFR as a therapeutic target in metastatic PCa. However, a ligand responsible for β-PDGFR activation in PCa was unknown, and recent clinical trials with imatinib mesylate showed limited success due to normal tissue toxicity. Similarly, in spite of mounting evidence indicating the significance of matriptase in PCa, little is known about its substrates or molecular actions during PCa progression. Here, we identified PDGF-D as a ligand for β-PDGFR in PCa and discovered matriptase as its regulator. Matriptase activates PDGF-D by proteolytic removal of the CUB domain in a 2-step process, creating a hemidimer, followed by growth factor domain dimer (GFD-D) generation.

To determine the heat generation capability of MWNTs, the absorption spectra and temperature rise during heating were measured. Higher optical absorption was observed for MWNTs in water compared with water alone. For identical laser parameters, MWNT-containing samples produced a significantly greater temperature elevation compared to samples treated with laser alone. Human prostate cancer (PC3) and murine renal carcinoma (RENCA) cells were irradiated with a 1,064-nm laser with an irradiance of 15.3 W/cm(2) for 2 heating durations (1.5 and 5 minutes) alone or in combination with MWNT inclusion.

We now investigate whether LRES also occurs in prostate cancer across this 4-Mb region and whether differential DNA methylation of 2q14.2 genes could provide a regional panel of prostate cancer biomarkers.  Methods:   We used highly sensitive DNA methylation headloop PCR assays that can detect 10 to 25 pg of methylated DNA with a specificity of at least 1:1,000, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to investigate regional epigenetic remodeling across 2q14.2 in prostate cancer, in a cohort of 195 primary prostate tumors and 90 matched normal controls.  Results:   Prostate cancer cells exhibit concordant deacetylation and methylation of histone H3 Lysine 9 (H3K9Ac and H3K9me2, respectively), and localized DNA hypermethylation of EN1, SCTR, and INHBB and corresponding loss of H3K27me3. EN1 and SCTR were frequently methylated (65% and 53%, respectively), whereas INHBB was less frequently methylated.  Conclusions:   Consistent with LRES in colorectal cancer, we found regional epigenetic remodeling across 2q14.2 in prostate cancer.

We evaluated the associations between intake of phytoestrogens (isoflavonoids/lignans/coumestrol) and fiber (vegetable/cereal) and risk of ovarian cancer.  Methods:   In 1991-1992 a prospective population-based cohort study among Swedish women was conducted, including 47,140 women with complete dietary questionnaire data.

Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to estimate multivariate risk ratios, 95% CI for associations with risk of ovarian cancer.  Results:   We found no association between intake of phytoestrogens or fiber and overall ovarian cancer risk. In addition, we found no statistically significant association between intake of specific food items rich in phytoestrogens (berries, nuts, beans/soy, and crisp or whole-grain bread) and ovarian cancer risk overall. Fiber and coumestrol was inversely associated with borderline ovarian cancer, but not with invasive ovarian cancer.

Although hormone-refractory disease is unresponsive to androgen-deprivation, androgen receptor (AR)-regulated signaling pathways remain active and are necessary for cancer progression. Thus, both AR itself and the processes downstream of the receptor remain viable targets for therapeutic intervention. Microarray analysis of multiple clinical cohorts showed that the serine/threonine kinase Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) is both highly expressed in the prostate and further elevated in prostate cancers. Using cellular models of prostate cancer, we have determined that androgens (a) directly increase the expression of a CaMKKβ splice variant and (b) increase functional CaMKKβ protein levels as determined by the phosphorylation of both CaMKI and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), two of CaMKKβ's primary substrates. Importantly, inhibition of the CaMKKβ-AMPK, but not CaMKI, signaling axis in prostate cancer cells by pharmacological inhibitors or siRNA-mediated knockdown blocks androgen-mediated migration and invasion. Conversely, overexpression of CaMKKβ alone leads to both increased AMPK phosphorylation and cell migration.

Expression of p75(NTR) is lost as prostate cancer progresses and is minimal in several metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. NSAIDs induce p75(NTR) through activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, with a concomitant decrease in cell survival. Here, we show that treatment with R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen induces expression of the NSAID-activated gene-1 (Nag-1) protein, a divergent member of the TGF beta (TGF-β) family, in PC-3 cells. Using the selective pharmacologic inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB202190, and p38 MAPK-specific siRNA (small interfering RNA), we show that Nag-1 induction following NSAID treatment is mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. p75(NTR)-specific siRNA pretreatment shows that Nag-1 induction by NSAIDs is downstream of p75(NTR) induction. Decreased survival of NSAID-treated cells is rescued by p75(NTR)-specific siRNA but not by Nag-1 siRNA. Transwell chamber and in vitro wound healing assays demonstrate decreased cell migration upon NSAID treatment. Pretreatment of PC-3 cells with p75(NTR) and Nag-1-specific siRNA shows that NSAID inhibition of cell migration is mediated by Nag-1 and p75(NTR).

The clinical process involves selection of target locations in a pre-operative image volume and registering these to an intra-operative volume. Registration inaccuracies inevitably lead to targeting error, a major clinical concern. The analysis of targeting error requires a large number of images with known ground truth, which has been infeasible even for the largest research centers.  Methods:   We propose to generate realistic prostate imaging data in a controllable way, with known ground truth, by simulation of prostate size, shape, motion and deformation typically encountered in prostatic needle placement. This data is then used to evaluate a given registration algorithm, by testing its ability to reproduce ground truth contours, motions and deformations. The method builds on statistical shape atlas to generate large number of realistic prostate shapes and finite element modeling to generate high-fidelity deformations, while segmentation error is simulated by warping the ground truth data in specific prostate regions. Expected target registration error (TRE) is computed as a vector field.  Results:   The simulator was configured to evaluate the TRE when using a surface-based rigid registration algorithm in a typical prostate biopsy targeting scenario. Simulator parameters, such as segmentation error and deformation, were determined by measurements in clinical images. Turnaround time for the full simulation of one test case was below 3 minutes.

It is shown that the proposed approach significantly enhances the contrast of the fiducial markers and produces results where these markers are clearly visible. The main theoretical contribution consists in designing an algorithm that enhances the contrast of small structures in noisy images; the parameters of this algorithm are not empirically selected, but determined via a maximum search over a contrast metric. From a practical standpoint, the proposed method has direct applications in the current clinical workflow involving manual marker detection.

The comet assay is a phenotypic measure of the combined effects of sensitivity to a mutagen exposure and repair capacity. In this paper, we evaluate the association of the DNA repair kinetics, as measured by the comet assay, with prostate cancer risk. In a pilot study of 55 men with prostate cancer, 53 men without the disease, and 71 men free of cancer at biopsy, we investigated the association of DNA damage with prostate cancer risk at early (0-15 min) and later (15-45 min) stages following gamma-radiation exposure. Although residual damage within 45 min was the same for all groups (65% of DNA in comet tail disappeared), prostate cancer cases had a slower first phase (38% vs. 41%) and faster second phase (27% vs. 22%) of the repair response compared to controls. When subjects were categorized into quartiles, according to efficiency of repairing DNA damage, high repair-efficiency within the first 15 min after exposure was not associated with prostate cancer risk while higher at the 15-45 min period was associated with increased risk (OR for highest-to-lowest quartiles=3.24, 95% CI=0.98-10.66, p-trend=0.04). Despite limited sample size, our data suggest that DNA repair kinetics marginally differ between prostate cancer cases and controls. This small difference could be associated with differential responses to DNA damage among susceptible individuals.""","""['O Kosti', 'L Goldman', 'D T Saha', 'R A Orden', 'A J Pollock', 'H L Madej', 'A W Hsing', 'L W Chu', 'J H Lynch', 'R Goldman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mutat Res""","""['Radiosensitivity and repair kinetics of gamma-irradiated leukocytes from sporadic prostate cancer patients and healthy individuals assessed by alkaline comet assay.', 'Quantification of DNA repair capacity in whole blood of patients with head and neck cancer and healthy donors by comet assay.', 'Assessment of genotoxic effects related to chronic low level exposure to ionizing radiation using biomarkers for DNA damage and repair.', 'Understanding cancer development processes after HZE-particle exposure: roles of ROS, DNA damage repair and inflammation.', 'DNA damage and repair measured by comet assay in cancer patients.']"""

Differences in the absorption coefficient between gold and soft tissue, as a function of photon energy, predict that maximum enhancement should occur in the kilovoltage (kV) range, with almost no enhancement at megavoltage (MV) energies. Recent studies have shown that GNPs are not biologically inert, causing oxidative stress and even cell death, suggesting a possible biological mechanism for sensitization. The purpose of this study was to assess GNP radiosensitization at clinically relevant MV X-ray energies.  Methods and materials:   Cellular uptake, intracellular localization, and cytotoxicity of GNPs were assessed in normal L132, prostate cancer DU145, and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Radiosensitization was measured by clonogenic survival at kV and MV photon energies and MV electron energies. Intracellular DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and DNA repair were determined and GNP chemosensitization was assessed using the radiomimetic agent bleomycin.  Results:   GNP uptake occurred in all cell lines and was greatest in MDA-MB-231 cells with nanoparticles accumulating in cytoplasmic lysosomes. In MDA-MB-231 cells, radiation sensitizer enhancement ratios (SERs) of 1.41, 1.29, and 1.16 were achieved using 160 kVp, 6 MV, and 15 MV X-ray energies, respectively. No significant effect was observed in L132 or DU145 cells at kV or MV energies (SER 0.97-1.08). GNP exposure did not increase radiation-induced DSB formation or inhibit DNA repair; however, GNP chemosensitization was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with bleomycin (SER 1.38).  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated radiosensitization in MDA-MB-231 cells at MV X-ray energies. The sensitization was cell-specific with comparable effects at kV and MV energies, no increase in DSB formation, and GNP chemopotentiation with bleomycin, suggesting a possible biological mechanism of radiosensitization.""","""['Suneil Jain', 'Jonathan A Coulter', 'Alan R Hounsell', 'Karl T Butterworth', 'Stephen J McMahon', 'Wendy B Hyland', 'Mark F Muir', 'Glenn R Dickson', 'Kevin M Prise', 'Fred J Currell', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'David G Hirst']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Gold nanoparticles in combination with megavoltage radiation energy increased radiosensitization and apoptosis in colon cancer HT-29 cells.', 'Octaarginine-modified gold nanoparticles enhance the radiosensitivity of human colorectal cancer cell line LS180 to megavoltage radiation.', 'Modeling gold nanoparticle radiosensitization using a clustering algorithm to quantitate DNA double-strand breaks with mixed-physics Monte Carlo simulation.', 'Radiosensitization by gold nanoparticles.', 'Roadmap to Clinical Use of Gold Nanoparticles for Radiation Sensitization.', 'X-ray and MR Contrast Bearing Nanoparticles Enhance the Therapeutic Response of Image-Guided Radiation Therapy for Oral Cancer.', 'Methodological and Cellular Factors Affecting the Magnitude of Breast Cancer and Normal Cell Radiosensitization Using Gold Nanoparticles.', 'Gold-Nanoparticles-Enhanced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species in Cells at Spread-Out Bragg Peak under Proton Beam Radiation.', 'Application of nano-radiosensitizers in combination cancer therapy.', 'The Role of Functionalization and Size of Gold Nanoparticles in the Response of MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells to Ionizing Radiation Comparing 2D and 3D In Vitro Models.']"""

Data on urinary and erectile outcomes, however, are lacking.  Objective:   In this study, we examined whether between-surgeon variation, known as heterogeneity, exists for urinary and erectile outcomes after RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Our study consisted of 1910 RP patients who were treated by 1 of 11 surgeons between January 1999 and July 2007.  Intervention:   All patients underwent RP at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.  Measurements:   Patients were evaluated for functional outcome 1 yr after surgery. Multivariable random effects models were used to evaluate the heterogeneity in erectile or urinary outcome between surgeons, after adjustment for case mix (age, prostate-specific antigen, pathologic stage and grade, comorbidities) and year of surgery.  Results and limitations:   We found significant heterogeneity in functional outcomes after RP (p<0.001 for both urinary and erectile function). Four surgeons had adjusted rates of full continence <75%, whereas three had rates >85%. For erectile function, two surgeons in our series had adjusted rates <20%; another two had rates >45%. We found some evidence suggesting that surgeons' erectile and urinary outcomes were correlated. Contrary to the hypothesis that surgeons ""trade off"" functional outcomes and cancer control, better rates of functional preservation were associated with lower biochemical recurrence rates.  Conclusions:   A patient's likelihood of recovering erectile and urinary function may differ depending on which of two surgeons performs his RP. Functional preservation does not appear to come at the expense of cancer control; rather, both are related to surgical quality.""","""['Andrew Vickers', 'Caroline Savage', 'Fernando Bianco', 'John Mulhall', 'Jaspreet Sandhu', 'Bertrand Guillonneau', 'Angel Cronin', 'Peter Scardino']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Does the surgeon really matter?

Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess associations between type 2 diabetes and hypertension and changes in serum PSA levels.  Methods:   In 1990, a randomly selected cohort of Caucasian men, ages 40-79, from Olmsted County, MN completed questionnaires ascertaining demographic characteristics, current medical conditions and medications biennially, with 633 men undergoing blood draws. Men with a physician diagnosis of diabetes or hypertension at baseline, or who reported using medications to treat these conditions prior to baseline were considered exposed. Men with at least two serum PSA measurements (n = 569) were included in this analysis. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the annual percent change in serum PSA levels associated with diabetes and hypertension, adjusting for baseline age.  Results:   The overall mean change in serum PSA levels was 3.6% per year and increased with age (P = .009). Men with diabetes experienced less annual change in serum PSA levels (1.1%) than did non-diabetic men (3.7%), adjusting for age (P = .02). Age-adjusted change in serum PSA levels differed little by hypertension status (3.7% vs. 3.6%; P = .49).  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that Caucasian men with type 2 diabetes experience smaller increases in serum PSA levels as they age compared to men without diabetes.

Methods:   We evaluated differences between HFPC and sporadic cancers, in the pattern of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP17A1, CYP19A1, VDR genes, and the CAG repeat from AR, controlling for dietary intake and lifestyle habits in a regionwide population.

The presence of an antiviral defense system based upon interferon induction has been suggested for the testes. I suggest that a similar system is also present in the prostate. Prostate cell lines (or tissue) can be tested directly for expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). However, enhanced expression should be induced by IFN inducers such as bispecific oligonucleotides having double stranded regions or poly I:C. RNA can be extracted and RT-PCR performed using commercially available primers for gamma interferon. Evidence for the presence of an interferon based anti-viral system would be indicated not only by interferon expression, but also its enhanced expression following exposure to the inducers.

We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Snail transcription factor, an inducer of EMT, promotes tumor aggressiveness utilizing ARCaP prostate cancer cell line. An EMT model created by Snail overexpression in ARCaP cells was associated with decreased E-cadherin and increased vimentin. Moreover, Snail-expressing cells displayed increased concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, in vitro and in vivo. Real Time PCR profiling demonstrated increased expression of oxidative stress-responsive genes, such as aldehyde oxidase I, in response to Snail. The ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine partially reversed Snail-mediated EMT after 7 days characterized by increased E-cadherin levels and decreased ERK activity, while treatment with the MEK inhibitor, UO126, resulted in a more marked effect by 3 days, characterized by cells returning back to the epithelial morphology and increased E-cadherin.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of the COMPASS system for both off-line and potential online procedures for the verification of IMRT treatment plans.  Methods and materials:   COMPASS has a dedicated beam model and dose engine, it can reconstruct three-dimensional dose distributions on the patient anatomy based on measured fluences using either the MatriXX two-dimensional (2D) array (offline) or a 2D transmission detector (T2D) (online). For benchmarking the COMPASS dose calculation, various dose-volume indices were compared against Monte Carlo-calculated dose distributions for five prostate patient treatment plans. Gamma index evaluation and absolute point dose measurements were also performed in an inhomogeneous pelvis phantom using extended dose range films and ion chamber for five additional treatment plans.  Results:   MatriXX-based dose reconstruction showed excellent agreement with the ion chamber (<0.5%, except for one treatment plan, which showed 1.5%), film (∼100% pixels passing gamma criteria 3%/3 mm) and mean dose-volume indices (<2%). The T2D based dose reconstruction showed good agreement as well with ion chamber (<2%), film (∼99% pixels passing gamma criteria 3%/3 mm), and mean dose-volume indices (<5.5%).

Objective:   Our aim was to explore PCa risk reduction in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from the Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin (CombAT) study, in which biopsies were undertaken for cause.  Design, setting, and participants:   CombAT was a 4-yr randomized double-blind parallel group study in 4844 men ≥50 yr of age with clinically diagnosed moderate to severe BPH, International Prostate Symptom Score ≥12, prostate volume ≥30 ml, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 1.5-10 ng/ml. Men underwent annual PSA measurement and digital rectal examination (DRE), and prostate biopsies were performed for cause.  Intervention:   All patients took tamsulosin 0.4 mg/d, dutasteride 0.5 mg/d, or a combination of both.  Measurements:   The primary end point was incidence of PCa. Secondary end points included postbaseline prostate biopsy rates and Gleason score of cancers.  Results and limitations:   Dutasteride (alone or in combination with tamsulosin) was associated with a 40% RRR of PCa diagnosis compared with tamsulosin monotherapy (95% confidence interval, 16-57%; p=0.002) and a 40% reduction in the likelihood of biopsy. There were similar reductions in low- and high-grade Gleason score cancers. The biopsy rate in the groups receiving dutasteride trended toward a higher diagnostic yield (combination: 29%, dutasteride: 28%, tamsulosin: 24%). One limitation was the lack of a standardized approach to PCa diagnosis and grading.  Conclusions:   Dutasteride, alone or in combination with tamsulosin, significantly reduced the relative risk of PCa diagnosis in men with BPH undergoing annual DRE and PSA screening. Consistent with the increased usefulness of PSA for PCa detection, men receiving dutasteride had a numerically lower biopsy rate and higher yield of PCa on biopsy.

Methods:   The expression of GST-Raf1-RBD recombinant protein, a specific binding domain of active Ras (GTP-Ras), was induced by IPTG in JM109 bacterium. SDS-PAGE and coomassie brilliant blue staining were performed using cleaved product of the bacterium to determine the expression of the fusion protein. GST-pull down essay was designed to detect the level of active Ras in PGA1 and vector transfected, respectively and in the native PC-3M-1E8 cells. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of downstream proteins of Ras signal pathway which may be related to the function of PAG1. Phalloidine labeled by tetramethylrhodamine-5-(and-6) isothiocyanate (TRITC) was used for the staining of intracellular F-actin, Laser passing confocal microscopy was adopted for observing change of the cell morphology and the arrangement of F-actin.  Results:   After IPTG induction, the GST-Raf1-RBD recombinant protein, with a molecular weight of 33 000, was noticed to be highly expressed in JM109 bacterium. GST-pull down assay revealed that the expression level of active Ras markedly decreased after PAG1-transfection while the total Ras remained unchanged. The expression of p-ERK and cyclin D1 in the PAG1-transfected cells decreased in accordance with the level of active Ras. However, the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p-Akt didn't show any variation. Additionally, the structure of F-actin was turbulent and the pseudopodia of cells diminished conspicuously after PAG1-transfection. There was a high expression of PAG1 in normal human prostate tissue, however, the positive rate of PAG1 immuno-staining decreased in cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma, correspondent with increasing of the grading index of cell differentiation established in the Gleason grading system for the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma.  Conclusions:   An over-expression of PAG1 in PC-3M-1E8 cells effectively suppresses the activation of Ras and ERK, as well as the cyclin D1 expression, leading to an inhibition of the proliferation ability of tumor cells. The turbulence of F-actin and reduction of pseudopodia of cells result in an impairment of cell mobility, invasiveness and metastatic capability.

Methods:   Utrasound-guided needle biopsies were carried out in 50 clinically suspicious cases of prostatic carcinoma. For each case, one additional core was sampled from the most suspicious area, fixed in glutaraldehyde and examined under electron microscopy.  Results:   In the 50 cases of prostatic needle biopsies studied, there were a total of 42 cases with histologic findings of prostatic carcinoma. Thirty-one cases showed features corresponding to Gleason's score 3 to 5. In contrast to that seen in benign prostatic hypertrophy, the ultrastructural findings of the tumor cells commonly seen in prostatic carcinoma included the centrally located giant nucleoli, a direct contact with stroma, and formation of cytoplasmic microcyst. Occasionaly, there were mitotic figures seen, accompanying with fibromyxoid change of the peritumoural stroma. Amongst the 31 cases of Gleason's score 3 to 5 prostatic carcinoma, 29 cases (93.5%) demonstrated cytoplasmic prostasomes and storage vesicles. Similar to their counterparts in benign prostatic cells, prostasomes and storage vesicles in prostatic carcinoma cells were formed in the Golgi apparatus and released into the lumen by apocrine excretion and exocytosis.  Conclusions:   Electron microscopy is helpful in distinguishing between benign and malignant prostatic lesions.

Equol (7-hydroxy-3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-chroman), a metabolite of the soya isoflavone daidzein, is produced via the formation of the intermediate dihydrodaidzein, by human intestinal bacteria, with only approximately 30-40% of the adult population having the ability to perform this transformation following a soya challenge. Inter-individual variation in conversion of daidzein to equol has been attributed, in part, to differences in the diet and in gut microflora composition, although the specific bacteria responsible for the colonic biotransformation of daidzein to equol are yet to be identified. Equol is a unique compound in that it can exert oestrogenic effects, but is also a potent antagonist of dihydrotestosterone in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest that equol is more biologically active than its parent compound, daidzein, with a higher affinity for the oestrogen receptor and a more potent antioxidant activity. Although some observational and intervention studies suggest that the ability to produce equol is associated with reduced risk of breast and prostate cancer, CVD, improved bone health and reduced incidence of hot flushes, others have reported null or adverse effects.

Emerging evidence in the literature suggests a high prevalence of suboptimal vitamin D (as defined by serum 25(OH)D levels of <32 ng/ml) as well as an association between lower serum levels and higher mortality in cancer. We investigated the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation as a means for restoring suboptimal levels to optimal levels in cancer.  Methods:   This is a retrospective observational study of 2198 cancer patients who had a baseline test prior to initiation of cancer therapy at our hospital to evaluate serum 25(OH)D levels between Jan 08 and Dec 09 as part of their initial nutritional evaluation. Patients with baseline levels of < = 32 ng/ml (n = 1651) were considered to have suboptimal serum 25(OH)D levels and were supplemented with 8000 IU of Vitamin D3 (four 2000 IU D3 capsules) daily as part of their nutritional care plan. The patients were retested at their first follow-up visit. Of 1651 patients, 799 were available for follow up assessment. The mean serum 25(OH)D levels were compared in these 799 patients across the 2 time points (baseline and first follow-up) using paired sample t-test. We also investigated the factors associated with response to vitamin D supplementation.  Results:   Of 2198 patients, 814 were males and 1384 females. 1051 were newly diagnosed and treated at our hospital while 1147 were diagnosed and treated elsewhere. The mean age at presentation was 55.4 years. The most common cancer types were breast (500, 22.7%), lung (328, 14.9%), pancreas (214, 9.7%), colorectal (204, 9.3%) and prostate (185, 8.4%). The mean time duration between baseline and first follow-up assessment was 14.7 weeks (median 10.9 weeks and range 4 weeks to 97.1 weeks). The mean serum 25(OH)D levels were 19.1 ng/ml (SD = 7.5) and 36.2 ng/ml (SD = 17.1) at baseline and first follow-up respectively; p < 0.001. Patients with prostate and lung cancer had the highest percentage of responders (70% and 69.2% respectively) while those with colorectal and pancreas had the lowest (46.7% each). Similarly, patients with serum levels 20-32 ng/ml at baseline were most likely to attain levels > 32 ng/ml compared to patients with baseline levels < 20 ng/ml.  Conclusions:   The response to supplementation from suboptimal to optimal levels was greatest in patients with prostate and lung cancer as well as those with baseline levels between 20-32 ng/ml. Characteristics of non-responders as well as those who take longer to respond to supplementation need to be further studied and defined.

Here we investigate the properties of our panel in men subject to clinical work-up before biopsy.  Methods:   We applied a previously published predictive model based on the kallikrein panel to 262 men undergoing prostate biopsy following an elevated PSA (≥ 3 ng/ml) and further clinical work-up during the European Randomized Study of Prostate Cancer screening, France. The predictive accuracy of the model was compared to a ""base"" model of PSA, age and digital rectal exam (DRE).  Results:   83 (32%) men had prostate cancer on biopsy of whom 45 (54%) had high grade disease (Gleason score 7 or higher). Our model had significantly higher accuracy than the base model in predicting cancer (area-under-the-curve [AUC] improved from 0.63 to 0.78) or high-grade cancer (AUC increased from 0.77 to 0.87). Using a decision rule to biopsy those with a 20% or higher risk of cancer from the model would reduce the number of biopsies by nearly half. For every 1000 men with elevated PSA and clinical indication for biopsy, the model would recommend against biopsy in 61 men with cancer, the majority (≈80%) of whom would have low stage and low grade disease at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   In this independent validation study, the model was highly predictive of prostate cancer in men for whom the decision to biopsy is based on both elevated PSA and clinical work-up.

ADT increases fat mass leading to insulin resistance and diabetes, and accelerates bone loss causing increased fracture risk. Given the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease and reduced bone density in ADT-naïve men with prostate cancer, the benefits of ADT have to be carefully weighed against its side effects, especially as a diagnosis of prostate cancer does not alter the life expectancy for most men. Men commencing ADT should be counselled about and be carefully monitored for these and other ADT-induced complications, which include fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hot flushes and anaemia. ADT-associated side effects should be prevented and treated in order that ADT-induced toxicity does not outweigh its benefits. Future clinical trials are needed: first, to better define the effects of ADT on survival in men with localized prostate cancer or with biochemical prostate-specific antigen recurrence; second, to delineate ADT-associated harm, especially with respect to cardiovascular events and fractures; and third, to test the efficacy of interventions designed to minimize ADT-related adverse outcomes.

Patients and methods:   ET-1 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry on archival needle biopsies (NBs) from 94 patients (49 pT2 and 45 pT3a) who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for clinical T1-T2 PCa. Each sample was analysed independently by two pathologists blinded to the clinical data.  Results:   In univariate analysis, high ET-1 expression in NBs, pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >10 ng/ml, percentage of positive biopsy cores and NB Gleason score ≥7 were significantly associated with ECE as determined on subsequent RP. No significant association was found between clinical stage and ECE. In multivariate analysis, there was a significant association with high ET-1 expression in NBs (p = 0.006), pre-operative PSA level >10 ng/ml (p = 0.049), and NB Gleason score ≥7 (p = 0.002). These three pre-operative factors combined provided the best model for predicting ECE with 93.3% sensitivity, 49% specificity, 62.5% positive predictive value, 88.9% negative predictive value. The combination yielded a higher concordance index (0.760 vs 0.720) and offered a higher log partial likelihood than the same model without ET1 (112.8 vs 105.7, p = 0.01).  Conclusions:   ET-1 expression was strongly associated with ECE and, when combined with pre-operative PSA level and Gleason score, improved the predictive accuracy of pre-operative NBs.

Patients and methods:   • A retrospective analysis of the Center for Prostate Disease Research National Database (comprised of five US military hospitals and one civilian centre) was performed for patients with PSA relapse (≥ 0.2 ng/mL) after radical prostatectomy who had no additional therapy until the time of radiographic metastatic disease. • We investigated factors influencing metastasis and all-cause mortality using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis.  Results:   • There were a total of 346 men who underwent radical prostatectomy between May 1983 and November 2008 and fulfilled the entry criteria. All patients had information on survival and 190 men had information on metastasis. Among patients with survival data (n= 346), 10-year OS was 79% after a median follow-up of 8.6 years from biochemical recurrence. • Among men with metastasis data (n= 190), 10-year MFS was 46% after a median follow-up of 7.5 years. • In Cox regressions, four clinical factors (Gleason score, pathological stage, time to PSA relapse and PSA doubling time), as well as age, were predictive of OS and/or MFS in univariate analysis, although only PSA doubling time (≥ 9 vs 3-8.9 vs <3 months) remained independently predictive of these outcomes in multivariate analysis (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   • This multicentre multi-ethnic dataset shows that OS and MFS can be extensive for men with PSA-recurrent prostate cancer, even in the absence of further therapy before metastasis. • This unique patient cohort, the second largest of its type after the Johns Hopkins cohort, confirms that PSA doubling time is the strongest determinant of OS and MFS in men with PSA-recurrent disease. • Longer follow-up and more events will be required to determine whether other variables may also contribute to these outcomes.""","""['Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Yongmei Chen', 'Sally I Elsamanoudi', 'Stephen A Brassell', 'Mario V Da Rocha', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'David G McLeod']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The natural history of metastatic progression in men with prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy: long-term follow-up.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'PSA doubling time as a predictor of clinical progression after biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Long-term biochemical disease-free and cancer-specific survival following anatomic radical retropubic prostatectomy.

Level of evidence:   4. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy still represents an issue for urologists as the indications to perform it depend oft from the personal clinical experience. Moreover, until now data concerning bilateral and unilateral laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy have been limited. This study states that bilateral laparoscopic intrafascial nerve-sparing technique results in superior functional outcomes when compared with unilateral nsLRP and it suggests to prefer a bilateral nerve-sparing technique in younger patients with low-risk, organ-confined prostate cancer.  Objective:   To evaluate the surgical and functional outcomes in bilateral and unilateral nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (nsLRP).  Patients and methods:   Between January 2005 and May 2009, 457 nsLRP were performed at our clinic. In all, 250 patients underwent a bilateral nsLRP and 207 patients underwent an unilateral nsLRP. One surgeon performed all the operations. All patients presented at biopsy a localized prostate cancer. Demographic data and perioperative and postoperative measurements and outcomes were compared.  Results:   The operative times for bilateral nsLRP and unilateral nsLRP were 165 ± 45 min and 130 ± 25 min, respectively. The mean intra-operative blood loss was 450 ± 300 mL and 270 ± 160 mL in the bilateral and unilateral nsLRP groups with a transfusion rate of 3% and 1%, respectively (P = 0.013). Conversion to open surgery was never deemed necessary. Postoperatively, the mean Gleason Score after nsLRP and distribution of tumour stages was similar in the two groups, and the frequency of positive margins in both groups did not present any statistically significant difference. At 12 months, a complete continence was reported in 97% of patients who underwent a bilateral nsLRP and in 88% of patients of the unilateral nsLRP group. At that time, 69% in the bilateral nsLRP and 43% in the unilateral nsLRP groups reported the ability to engage in sexual intercourse.

The role of sex hormones (SHs) in this regard remains controversial.  Aims:   To determine the impact of SA and SHs on PC development.  Methods:   In a multicentric hospital-based case-control study, 194 newly diagnosed PC patients along with 317 age-matched controls were studied. Sociodemographic and medical characteristics of participants were recorded. History of vasectomy and sexually transmitted infection (STI), marital status, age at first intercourse, premarital sex, and the current frequency of sexual intercourses per month (SPM) were evaluated. Total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), estradiol (ES), sex hormone binding globulin, and albumin were also measured. Logistic regression model was used to identify independent risk factors for PC.  Main outcome measures:   (i) The association between SA, SHs, and the risk of PC; (ii) The correlation between SHs and SA; (iii) The interaction between SHs and SA and established risk factors for PC and erectile dysfunction in determining the risk of PC; and (iv) The correlation between SHs and SA in determining the risk of PC in different decades of life.  Results:   Vasectomy, STI, and marital status did not differ significantly between two cohorts. Controls reported premarital sex more commonly than cases (P < 0.001). Cases had the first intercourse at older age (P = 0.03) and had less SPM (P < 0.001). TT, FT, and ES were higher in controls (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, TT, calculated FT, SPM >4, and age at time of marriage <24 were protective against PC. The protective effect of high SA and SHs increased as patients' age increased.  Conclusions:   High SA as well as TT and FT were protective against PC. Their protective role enhances by each decade of increasing age.

A sharp decrease in MSX2 was found in primary prostate cancer cells, 22Rv1, when compared with the non-malignant counterparts, followed by a gradual increase in more aggressive prostate cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the MSX2 protein was upregulated and predominantly expressed in the nucleus in aggressive prostate cancer cell line, C4-2b, compared with the less aggressive 22Rv1. Consistent with the in vitro results, MSX2 nuclear expression was significantly higher in nodular hyperplasia when compared with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), while MSX2 nuclear expression in prostate adenocarcinoma was higher than that in high-grade PIN. Importantly, MSX2 expression was increased significantly in tumors with metastasis compared with those without metastasis.

Methods:   The authors examine the two-step decision-making strategy: (1) Use cine-MV imaging and online-updated characterization of prostate motion to detect target motion that is potentially beyond a predefined threshold and (2) use paired MV-kV 3D localization to determine overthreshold displacement and, if needed, reposition the patient. Two levels of clinical implementation were evaluated: (1) Field-by-field based motion correction for present-day linacs and (2) instantaneous repositioning for new-generation linacs with capabilities of simultaneous MV-kV imaging and remote automatic couch control during treatment delivery. Experiments were performed on a Varian Trilogy linac in clinical mode using a 4D motion phantom programed with prostate motion trajectories taken from patient data. Dosimetric impact was examined using a 2D ion chamber array. Simulations were done for 536 trajectories from 17 patients.  Results:   Despite the loss of marker detection efficiency caused by the MLC leaves sometimes obscuring the field at the marker's projected position on the MV imager, the field-by-field correction halved (from 23% to 10%) the mean percentage of time that target displacement exceeded a 3 mm threshold, as compared to no intervention. This was achieved at minimal cost in additional imaging (average of one MV-kV pair per two to three treatment fractions) and with a very small number of repositionings (once every four to five fractions). Also with low kV usage (approximation 2/fraction), the instantaneous repositioning approach reduced overthreshold time by more than 75% (23% to 5%) even with severe MLC blockage as often encountered in current IMRT and could reduce the overthreshold time tenfold (to < 2%) if the MLC blockage problem were relieved. The information acquired for repositioning using combined MV-kV images was found to have submillimeter accuracy.  Conclusions:   This work demonstrated with a current clinical setup that substantial reduction of adverse targeting effects of intrafraction prostate motion can be realized.

The low energy photons emitted by these sources make the dosimetry sensitive to variations in tissue atomic number due to the dominance of the photoelectric effect. This work reports dose to a small mass of water in medium D(w,m) as opposed to dose to a small mass of medium in medium D(m,m).  Methods:   Mean adipose, mammary gland, and breast tissues (as uniform mixture of the aforementioned tissues) are investigated as well as compositions corresponding to one standard deviation from the mean. Prostate mean compositions from three different literature sources are also investigated. Three sets of MC simulations are performed with the GEANT4 code: (1) Dose calculations for idealized TG-43-like spherical geometries using point sources. Radial dose profiles obtained in different media are compared to assess the influence of compositional uncertainties. (2) Dose calculations for four clinical prostate LDR brachytherapy permanent seed implants using 125I seeds (Model 2301, Best Medical, Springfield, VA). The effect of varying the prostate composition in the planning target volume (PTV) is investigated by comparing PTV D90 values. (3) Dose calculations for four clinical breast LDR brachytherapy permanent seed implants using 103Pd seeds (Model 2335, Best Medical). The effects of varying the adipose/gland ratio in the PTV and of varying the elemental composition of adipose and gland within one standard deviation of the assumed mean composition are investigated by comparing PTV D90 values. For (2) and (3), the influence of using the mass density from CT scans instead of unit mass density is also assessed.  Results:   Results from simulation (1) show that variations in the mean compositions of tissues affect low energy brachytherapy dosimetry. Dose differences between mean and one standard deviation of the mean composition increasing with distance from the source are observed. It is established that the 125I and 131Cs sources are the least sensitive to variations in elemental compositions while 103Pd is most sensitive. The EBS falls in between and exhibits complex behavior due to significant spectral hardening. Results from simulation (2) show that two prostate compositions are dosimetrically equivalent to water while the third shows D90 differences of up to 4%. Results from simulation (3) show that breast is more sensitive than prostate with dose variations of up to 30% from water for 70% adipose/30% gland breast. The variability of the breast composition adds a +/- 10% dose variation.  Conclusions:   Low energy brachytherapy dose distributions in tissue differ from water and are influenced by density, mean tissue composition, and patient-to-patient composition variations. The results support the use of a dose calculation algorithm accounting for heterogeneities such as MC. Since this work shows that variations in mean tissue compositions affect MC dosimetry and result in increased dose uncertainties, the authors conclude that imaging tools providing more accurate estimates of elemental compositions such as dual energy CT would be beneficial.""","""['Guillaume Landry', 'Brigitte Reniers', 'Lars Murrer', 'Ludy Lutgens', 'Esther Bloemen-Van Gurp', 'Jean-Philippe Pignol', 'Brian Keller', 'Luc Beaulieu', 'Frank Verhaegen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['The difference of scoring dose to water or tissues in Monte Carlo dose calculations for low energy brachytherapy photon sources.', 'Monte Carlo study of LDR seed dosimetry with an application in a clinical brachytherapy breast implant.', 'Brachytherapy dosimetry of 125I and 103Pd sources using an updated cross section library for the MCNP Monte Carlo transport code.', 'Recommendations of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine regarding the impact of implementing the 2004 task group 43 report on dose specification for 103Pd and 125I interstitial brachytherapy.', 'American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) recommendations for transperineal permanent brachytherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Improving radiation physics, tumor visualisation, and treatment quantification in radiotherapy with spectral or dual-energy CT.', 'VOXSI: A voxelized single- and dual-energy CT scenario generator for quantitative imaging.', 'Multi-energy computed tomography and material quantification: Current barriers and opportunities for advancement.', 'Quality Assurance Procedures based on Dosimetric, Gamma Analysis as a Fast Reliable Tool for Commissioning Brachytherapy Treatment Planning Systems.', 'Feasibility and clinical value of CT-guided 125I brachytherapy for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma after first-line chemotherapy failure.']"""

The objectives of this study were to characterize the MR imaging features, locations, and extent of metastatic skull tumors to determine the frequency of the symptomatic disease, and to assess patient outcomes. Between September 2002 and March 2008, 175 patients undergoing routine head MR imaging were found to have metastatic skull tumors. Contrast-enhanced study with fat suppression was used in some cases when required. Classification of metastases was simplified to three yes/no questions: first, with regard to location (either in the calvarium or in the cranial base); second, with regard to distribution within the plane of the cranial bone (either ""circumscribed"" meaning clearly demarcated and confined to one bone, or ""diffuse"" and likely to spread across a suture to another bone); and third, with regard to invasion (""intraosseous"" in cranial bones only, or ""invasive"" spreading from the skull, either out into the scalp or inward to the dura and perhaps further in). Primary sites were breast cancer (55%), lung cancer (14%), prostate cancer (6%), malignant lymphoma (5%), and others (20%). The mean time from primary diagnosis to skull metastasis diagnosis was 71 months for cases of breast cancer, 26 months for prostate cancer, 9 months for lung cancer, and 4 months for malignant lymphoma. Calvarial circumscribed intraosseous metastases were found most frequently (27%). The patients were mainly asymptomatic. However, some patients suffered from local pain or cranial nerve palsies that harmed their quality of life. Treatment, mainly for symptomatic cases, was by local or whole-skull irradiation. Metastatic skull tumors are not rare, and most are calvarial circumscribed intraosseous tumors. MR images contribute to understanding their type, location, and multiplicity, and their relationship to the brain, cranial nerves, and dural sinuses.

Troglitazone (TGZ), a thiazolidinedione ligand of PPARγ, has been recently described as possessing antitumoral properties. We studied the effects of TGZ on proliferation, growth arrest and apoptosis in PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells and its interaction with the signaling pathways of the activated EFG receptor (EGFR). We observed that TGZ, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, inhibited the growth of PC-3 cells independent of PPARγ. In addition, TGZ induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We demonstrated that cell proliferation was stimulated by EFG in a dose- and time-dependent manner and was inhibited by TGZ. The analysis of the main intracellular signaling pathways downstream of the activated EGFR, PI3K-Akt, ERK1/2 cascades and IκBα revealed that TGZ reduced the phosphorylation levels of EGFR and of their downstream inter-mediators which mediate EGF stimulated proliferation.

The number of vaccination cycles varied widely, from 3 to 112. The severity of adverse events was scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3, and events with a grade of >3 were defined as SAEs and were evaluated by the Institutional Safety Evaluation Committee.

The 6 vaccine-related SAEs, all grade 3, consisted of skin reactions at each injection site, cellulitis around the injection site, edemas of the head and neck regions, colitis, rectal bleeding and bladder-vaginal fistulae. Both cellular and humoral responses to the vaccinated peptides were highly boosted in all 6 of these patients, indicating the involvement of augmented immune responses in these SAEs. The clinical responses in these 6 patients consisted of 2 partial responses and 4 stable diseases.

Due to this, inhibitors for a number of key signaling molecules in these pathways such as PI3K, Akt, mTOR, Raf and ERK are currently in clinical trials. In the current study, we investigated the effects of specific inhibition of these signaling molecules, alone or in combinations, on prostate cancer cells. Our study showed that integration of Akt-mTOR and MAPK signaling by PI3K was essential for the EGF-stimulated TRAMP cell migration, proliferation, survival and invasion as well as PC3 and LNCaP C4-2 (C4-2) colony/foci formation. Adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active Akt (Ad-myrAkt) in PC3 cells resulted in significant increase in number of foci. Even though PI3K inhibition significantly reduced foci formed by C4-2 cells, none of the Akt, ERK or mTOR inhibitors showed any significant inhibition. This indicated that functional redundancies and/or feed back loops between Akt-mTOR and MAPK signaling exist in prostate cancer. Further studies on cotargeting these signaling molecules revealed that combined inhibition of Akt (or mTOR) and ERK, but not Akt and mTOR, resulted in significant reduction in number of foci formed by the C4-2 cells.

As cataracts have been linked to these metabolic abnormalities, an increased risk of cataract may be another adverse consequence of ADT use.  Methods:   Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database, we estimated risk of cataract associated with ADT among 65,852 prostate-cancer patients. ADT treatment was defined as at least one dose of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or orchiectomy within 6 months after prostate cancer diagnosis. The outcome measure was a first claim of cataract diagnosis identified in Medicare claim files. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for the effects of ADT treatment, controlling for confounders.  Results:   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist use was associated with a modest increase in cataract incidence (HR 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.12). Orchiectomy was also associated with an increased risk of cataract among men with no history of cataract prior to prostate cancer diagnosis (HR 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.47).  Conclusions:   In the first systematic investigation of the association between ADT and cataract, our results suggest an elevation in the incidence of cataract among ADT users. Further study, preferably prospective in design, is needed to provide additional evidence to support or refute these findings.""","""['Jennifer Beebe-Dimmer', 'Hal Morgenstern', 'Karynsa Cetin', 'Cecilia Yee', 'Monina Bartoces', 'Vahakn Shahinian', 'Jon Fryzek', 'John Acquavella', 'Kendra L Schwartz']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Ann Epidemiol""","""['Fracture after androgen deprivation therapy among men with a high baseline risk of skeletal complications.', 'Timing of androgen deprivation therapy use and fracture risk among elderly men with prostate cancer in the United States.', 'Risks of Major Long-Term Side Effects Associated with Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Stroke related to androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer and dementia risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Potential Ophthalmological Side Effects Induced by Anti-Neoplastic Regimens for the Treatment of Genitourinary Cancers: A Review.', 'Oestradiol levels and superoxide dismutase activity in age-related cataract: a case-control study.', 'Effects of 17β-estradiol on proliferation, cell viability and intracellular redox status in native human lens epithelial cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between 1993 and 2005, 742 consecutive patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy with either adjuvant (n = 556; median radiation dose, 70.2 Gy) or salvage (n = 186; median radiation dose, 72 Gy) intent.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 99 months, the 8-year risk of Grade 2 or greater and Grade 3 late urinary toxicity was almost identical (23.9% vs. 23.7% and 12% vs. 10%) in the adjuvant and salvage cohorts, respectively. On univariate analysis, acute toxicity was significantly predictive of late Grade 2 or greater sequelae in both subgroups (p <.0001 in both cases), and hypertension (p = .02) and whole-pelvis radiotherapy (p = .02) correlated significantly in the adjuvant cohort only. The variables predictive of late Grade 3 sequelae were acute Grade 2 or greater toxicity in both groups and whole-pelvis radiotherapy (8-year risk of Grade 3 events, 21% vs. 11%, p = .007), hypertension (8-year risk, 18% vs. 10%, p = .005), age ≤ 62 years at RT (8-year risk, 16% vs. 11%, p = .04) in the adjuvant subset, and radiation dose >72 Gy (8-year risk, 19% vs. 6%, p = .007) and age >71 years (8-year risk, 16% vs. 6%, p = .006) in the salvage subgroup. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent predictive role of all the covariates indicated as statistically significant on univariate analysis.  Conclusions:   The risk of late Grade 2 or greater and Grade 3 urinary toxicity was almost identical, regardless of the RT intent. In the salvage cohort, older age and greater radiation doses resulted in a worse toxicity profile, and younger, hypertensive patients experienced a greater rate of severe late sequelae in the adjuvant setting.

Methods:   Psychosocial assessments were administered to a sample of 175 men at baseline, and 2 years later. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships between social support, perceived stress and HRQOL, while controlling for possible covariates that may affect HRQOL (e.g., age, time since diagnosis, medical comorbidities, etc.).  Results:   Higher levels of social support at baseline predicted higher levels of HRQOL at 2-year follow-up after controlling for relevant covariates and baseline levels of HRQOL. This relationship was partially mediated by level of perceived stress at baseline. Furthermore, men perceiving high levels of social support reported significantly higher HRQOL compared with men perceiving low levels of social support.  Conclusions:   Results indicate positive social relationships contribute to improved HRQOL in patients who have undergone treatment for localized prostate cancer. One pathway through which social support can benefit HRQOL is through lower perceptions of stress.

Methods:   Among 7839 men who received radiation with or without a median of 4 months of HT for PC from 1991 to 2006, 495 (6.3%) had CAD-induced CHF or MI and formed the study cohort. Of these men, 250 (50.5%) had been revascularized before treatment for PC. Cox regression was used to determine whether HT increased the risk of all-cause mortality, and whether revascularization altered this risk, after adjusting for known PC prognostic factors and a propensity score for revascularization.  Results:   Median follow-up was 4.1 years. Neoadjuvant HT was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (28.9% vs 15.7% at 5 years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-2.64; P = .01). Men who received HT without revascularization had the highest risk of all-cause mortality (33.3%; adjusted HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.01-2.18; P = .047), whereas men who were revascularized and did not receive HT had the lowest risk of all-cause mortality (9.4%; adjusted HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.93; P = .028). The reference group had an intermediate risk of all-cause mortality (23.4%) and was comprised of men in whom HT use and revascularization were either both given or both withheld.

Though excellent potency rates are widely reported, few studies address a return to baseline function. We analyze validated sexual health-related quality-of-life outcomes by a strict definition, a return to baseline function, and compare them to less stringent, yet more frequently referenced, categorical definitions of potency.  Methods:   Patients undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy from April 2001 to September 2007 completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. We defined a return to baseline as a recovery to greater than one-half standard deviation of the studied population below the patient's own baseline (clinically detectable threshold). We compared these outcomes to a categorical definition of potency involving intercourse frequency. To limit confounders, we performed subset analyses of preoperatively potent men who received bilateral nerve preservation. Factors predictive of return to baseline function were assessed in multivariable analysis.  Results:   A total of 568 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age and follow-up were 57.2 years and 16.9 months, respectively. Using the categorical definition, 85% of preoperatively potent men with bilateral nerve preservation were ""potent"" at 24 months; however, only 27% returned to their baseline sexual function. In multivariable analyses baseline function, number of nerves spared, and age were independent predictors of a return to baseline function.

The current front-line treatment for patients with CRPC is the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel (administered every 3 weeks). Until now, it is the only agent that has been shown to prolong survival in CRPC. The approval trial for docetaxel found a median overall survival of 19.2 months for patients receiving docetaxel plus prednisone compared to 16.3 months for patients receiving mitoxantrone plus prednisone (p=0.0094). Mitoxantrone plus prednisone is often utilized for its palliative benefits, but two randomized trials failed to demonstrate a survival advantage.""","""['William D Figg nd', 'William D Figg']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Cabazitaxel: a novel second-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prednisone plus cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel treatment: a randomised open-label trial.', 'Critical appraisal of cabazitaxel in the management of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Practical guide to the use of chemotherapy in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Docetaxel: a review of its use for the first-line treatment of advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Elevated expression of UBE2T exhibits oncogenic properties in human prostate cancer.']"""

However, such agonists are characterized by poor pharmacokinetic properties, often requiring repeated administration or special formulations. Therefore, the development of novel peptide analogs with enhanced in vivo stability could potentially provide therapeutic alternatives. The pharmacological evaluation of a bioactive peptide [Des-Gly¹⁰,Tyr⁵(OMe),D-Leu⁶,Aze-NHEt⁹]GnRH, analog 1, is presented herein and compared with leuprolide. Peptide stability was evaluated using mouse kidney membrane preparations, followed by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based approach that afforded identification and quantification of its major metabolites. The analog was significantly more stable in vitro in comparison with leuprolide. In vitro and in vivo stability results correlated well, encouraging us to develop a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic mouse model, which facilitated efficacy measurements using testosterone as a biomarker. Analog 1, an agonist of the GnRH receptor with a binding affinity in the nanomolar range, caused testosterone release in mice that was acutely dose-dependent, an effect blocked by the GnRH receptor antagonist cetrorelix. Repeated dosing studies in mice demonstrated that analog 1 was well tolerated and had potency similar to that of leuprolide, based on plasma and testis testosterone reduction and histopathological findings. Analog 1 also shared with leuprolide similar significant antiproliferative activity on androgen-dependent prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells. On the basis of pharmacokinetic advantages, we expect that analog 1 or analogs based on this new design will be therapeutically advantageous for the treatment of cancer and endocrine disorders.""","""['Theodora Katsila', 'Evangelos Balafas', 'George Liapakis', 'Patrizia Limonta', 'Marina Montagnani Marelli', 'Konstantinos Gkountelias', 'Theodore Tselios', 'Nikolaos Kostomitsopoulos', 'John Matsoukas', 'Constantin Tamvakopoulos']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs and their conjugates on gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor--positive human cancer cell lines.', 'In vivo evaluation and in vitro metabolism of leuprolide in mice--mass spectrometry-based biomarker measurement for efficacy and toxicity.', 'Enzymatic stability, solution structure, and antiproliferative effect on prostate cancer cells of leuprolide and new gonadotropin-releasing hormone peptide analogs.', 'AEZS-108 : a targeted cytotoxic analog of LHRH for the treatment of cancers positive for LHRH receptors.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors as molecular therapeutic targets in prostate cancer: Current options and emerging strategies.', 'On the design principles of peptide-drug conjugates for targeted drug delivery to the malignant tumor site.', 'Evaluation of the Biological Properties and the Enzymatic Stability of Glycosylated Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Analogs.', 'GnRH-(1-5) transactivates EGFR in Ishikawa human endometrial cells via an orphan G protein-coupled receptor.']"""

We utilized a method estimating tumor growth and regression rate constants from serial PSA measurements, and assessed its potential in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC).  Experimental design:   Patients were enrolled in five phase II studies, including an experimental vaccine trial, representing the evolution of therapy in mCRPC. PSA measurements obtained before, and during, therapy were used. Data analysis using a two-phase mathematical equation yielded concomitant PSA growth and regression rate constants.  Results:   Growth rate constants (g) can be estimated while patients receive therapy and in such patients g is superior to PSA-DT in predicting OS. Incremental reductions in growth rate constants were recorded in successive trials with a 10-fold slower g in the most recent combination therapy trial (log g = 10(-3.17)) relative to single-agent thalidomide (log g = 10(-2.08)) more than a decade earlier. Growth rate constants correlated with survival, except in patients receiving vaccine-based therapy where the evidence demonstrates prolonged survival presumably due to immunity developing subsequent to vaccine administration.  Conclusion:   Incremental reductions in tumor growth rate constants suggest increased efficacy in successive chemotherapy trials. The derived growth rate constant correlates with survival, and may be used to assess efficacy. The PSA-TRICOM vaccine appears to have provided marked benefit not apparent during vaccination, but consistent with subsequent development of a beneficial immune response. If validated as a surrogate for survival, growth rate constants would offer an important new efficacy endpoint for clinical trials.""","""['Wilfred D Stein', 'James L Gulley', 'Jeff Schlom', 'Ravi A Madan', 'William Dahut', 'William D Figg', 'Yang-Min Ning', 'Phil M Arlen', 'Doug Price', 'Susan E Bates', 'Tito Fojo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Tumor growth rates derived from data for patients in a clinical trial correlate strongly with patient survival: a novel strategy for evaluation of clinical trial data.', 'Phase II trial of bevacizumab, thalidomide, docetaxel, and prednisone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen kinetics as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a review.', 'Rational indication for docetaxel rechallenge in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Current vaccination strategies for prostate cancer.', 'External validation of a tumor growth inhibition-overall survival model in non-small-cell lung cancer based on atezolizumab studies using alectinib data.', 'Circulating tumor DNA: Opportunities and challenges for pharmacometric approaches.', 'Progression in immunotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of efficacy and tolerability of adjuvant therapy for resected high-risk stage III-IV cutaneous melanoma: a systemic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis.', 'Mapping lesion-specific response and progression dynamics and inter-organ variability in metastatic colorectal cancer.']"""

Objective:   We hypothesized that polymorphisms in estrogen synthesis and estrogen targets (i.e., CYP19 and ERα) would be linked to interindividual variation in CRPC risk, docetaxel response, and overall survival in men with CRPC.  Materials and methods:   Patients with CRPC (n=115) treated with docetaxel, single-agent thalidomide (n=42), or healthy controls (n=289) were genotyped for the CYP19 R264C (rs700519) and the ERα PvuII T>C (rs2234693) and XbaI A>G (rs9340799) polymorphisms.  Results:   Patients carrying two copies of ERα polymorphisms had shorter progression-free survival on docetaxel than other patients (median survival difference ≥ 3.1 months; P ≤ 0.036). When the analysis was limited to nonobese patients, the relationship between the ERα XbaI A>G polymorphism and PFS improved (median survival difference = 3.5 months; P = 0.0078). The CYP19 R264C variant was related to the duration of survival after docetaxel in patients who were >70 years old (median survival difference =10.6 months; P=0.041). Both ERα polymorphisms were also associated with increases in CRPC risk [P ≤ 0.032; double variants vs. wild-type odds ratio ≥ 2.6], and the association with the ERα PvuII T>C also improved in those men who were <70 years old (P = 0.0073; odds ratio = 3.0).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that estrogen-related genetic variation affects docetaxel clinical response and that this relationship is dependent on age and body-type in men with CRPC.

Methods and materials:   Between June 1992 and October 2006, 97 patients with extraprostatic prostate cancer received permanent seed implant BT. Extraprostatic disease was defined by one or more of the following: positive seminal vesicle biopsy (n=56), positive lymph node dissection (n=8), or a clinical tumor stage of T3 (n=48). Treatment consisted of BT alone with (103)Pd or (125)I (n=4); HT and BT (n=3); BT and EBRT (n=2); or trimodality therapy with HT, BT, and EBRT (n=88). Median followup was 69 (range, 23-182) months. Freedom from biochemical failure (FBF) rates were calculated using the Phoenix criteria.  Results:   The 7-year actuarial FBF, freedom from distant metastases, disease-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 67%, 82%, 96%, and 81%, respectively.

Since aging is one major risk factor for carcinogenesis, and genomic instability is a hallmark of malignant cancers, we investigated the expression of progerin in human cancer cells, and whether its expression contributes to carcinogenesis. Using RT-PCR and Western blotting, we detected the expression of progerin in prostate PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP cells at mRNA and protein levels. Ectopic progerin expression did not cause cellular senescence in PC-3 or MCF7 cells. PC-3 cells progerin transfectants were sensitized to DNA damage agent camptothecin (CPT); and persistent DNA damage responses were observed, which might be caused by progerin induced defective DNA damage repair.

To address this question, we studied the hypothesis that Hes1, human homolog of Drosophila Hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) 1, is a transcriptional repressor of δ-catenin expression and plays an important role in molecular carcinogenesis.  Results:   We identified that, using a δ-catenin promoter reporter assay, Hes1, but not its inactive mutant, significantly repressed the upregulation of δ-catenin-luciferase activities induced by E2F1. Hes1 binds directly to the E-boxes on δ-catenin promoter and can reduce the expression of δ-catenin in prostate cancer cells. In prostate cancer CWR22-Rv1 and PC3 cell lines, which showed distinct δ-catenin overexpression, E2F1 and Hes1 expression pattern was altered. The suppression of Hes1 expression, either by γ-secretase inhibitors or by siRNA against Hes1, increased δ-catenin expression. γ-Secretase inhibition delayed S/G2-phase transition during cell cycle progression and induced cell shape changes to extend cellular processes in prostate cancer cells. In neuroendocrine prostate cancer mouse model derived allograft NE-10 tumors, δ-catenin showed an increased expression while Hes1 expression was diminished. Furthermore, E2F1 transcription was very high in subgroup of NE-10 tumors in which Hes1 still displayed residual expression, while its expression was only moderately increased in NE-10 tumors where Hes1 expression was completely suppressed.

Employing a DNA oligonucleotide that is covalently conjugated to the detection antibody and a complementary RNA oligonucleotide which is appended with a fluorophore and a quencher, degradation of the RNA in the DNA-RNA duplex by RNase H is exploited for fluorescent signal generation. Iterative cycles of DNA-RNA duplexation and subsequent degradation of the RNA in the duplex by RNase H further lead to amplification of the detection signal in OLISA. Moreover, the use of antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates enables multiplexing of OLISA, which is successfully demonstrated by tethering DNA molecules to detection antibodies and by performing assays for three common cancer markers including α-fetoprotein, prostate-specific antigen, and carcinoembryonic antigen.

Background:   In 2009, it was projected that over 230,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. While treatment options vary, these options result in changes within the man that can affect his quality of life. Research has shown that often spouses play a central role in men's choice of treatment and in maintaining men's quality of life. In addition, spouses are the major providers of emotional support and physical care. However, little is known about how men without partners cope with prostate cancer. Prior research seldom addresses how diagnosis and treatment for prostate cancer affects the quality of life of men without partners.  Methods:   Because very little is known about the needs of men without partners managing prostate cancer, qualitative analysis of data obtained during semi-structure interviews provided respondents with an opportunity to share the lived experience of prostate cancer. A semi-structured interview was conducted with selected, consenting men. The sample was drawn from the ongoing R01 study of men with prostate cancer (PROSTQA).  Results:   The sample for this study included 17 unpartnered prostate cancer survivors. The ages of participants ranged from 47 to 72 with a mean age of 63. The participants had between zero and two co-morbidities with an average of one co-morbidity per participant. The sample was 82% Caucasian and 17% Black. A total of 35% of the participants reported ""some college"" (n = 6), 30% graduated from college (n = 5), and 23% went to graduate school (n = 4). One participant reported that he was a high school graduate and one had less than a high school education. Five themes emerged from the data: going it alone, diagnosis and prostate cancer treatment decision-making, sources of information and support, the aftermath of prostate cancer, and coping strategies.  Conclusions:   This study provides information about unpartnered men's prostate cancer experience. This information will help health care professionals to meet the needs of unpartnered more effectively and help them to assist men as they adapt to living with this chronic illness.""","""['Meredith Wallace Kazer', 'Janet Harden', 'Matthew Burke', 'Martin G Sanda', 'Jill Hardy', 'Donald E Bailey;PROSTQA Study Group']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""[""'What is this active surveillance thing?'

We examined patients' beliefs related to efficacy of regular checkups for detection, potential negative treatment effects, and perceived curability of cancer. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables, medical care measures, clinical factors, and lifestyle.  Results:   In a fully adjusted model, not believing that most cancers can be cured was associated with an increased risk of death from any cause (Hazard Ratio = 1.62; 95% confidence interval = 1.11, 2.38).

In addition, high levels of PRL in plasma correlate with increased risk of breast cancer, especially among postmenopausal women. Several isoforms of PRL exist in human circulation, including a 16 kDa isoform that is an N-terminal fragment of the full-length 23 kDa PRL. 16 kDa PRL has been shown to be anti-angiogenic in vitro and in vivo, and to reduce formation of tumors from prostate, colon and melanoma cancer cell lines. Here we explore the effect of 16 kDa PRL expression in vitro and in vivo using two breast cancer cell line models (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and also the HCT-116 colon cancer cell line. In all three cell lines, 16 kDa PRL expression inhibited cell proliferation in vitro compared to empty vector controls. In vivo results were markedly different between the two types of cell lines. HCT-116 cells expressing 16 kDa PRL exhibited reduced vascularization and tumor formation, consistent with published results. The breast cancer cell lines expressing 16 kDa PRL also exhibited inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo but no reduction in tumor size or formation. These results suggest that the effects of 16 kDa PRL on tumor formation may vary across tissue types. The unique sensitivity of breast cancer to PRL as a mitogen and/or additional factors in the mammary gland environment (e.g. local hormone/mitogen concentration) may play a dominant role in tumor formation in vivo, thus outweighing the anti-angiogenesis effects and in vitro reduction in cell proliferation induced by 16 kDa PRL.""","""['J M Faupel-Badger', 'E Ginsburg', 'J M Fleming', 'L Susser', 'T Doucet', 'B K Vonderhaar']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Vasoinhibins, N-terminal mouse prolactin fragments, participate in mammary gland involution.', 'Prolactin overexpression by MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells accelerates tumor growth.', 'Global profiling of prolactin-modulated transcripts in breast cancer in vivo.', 'Should prolactin be reconsidered as a therapeutic target in human breast cancer?', 'Role of prolactin and vasoinhibins in the regulation of vascular function in mammary gland.', 'The Value of Prolactin, a Panel of Cytokines, and the Soluble Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 in the Prediction of Rapid Progression and Shorter Survival during Palliative Chemotherapy of Colorectal Cancer Patients.', 'Cathepsin D Inhibits Angiogenesis in Pituitary Neuroendocrine Tumors.', 'hiPSC-derived neural stem cells from patients with schizophrenia induce an impaired angiogenesis.', 'Human Prolactin Point Mutations and Their Projected Effect on Vasoinhibin Generation and Vasoinhibin-Related Diseases.', 'Pubertal high fat diet: effects on mammary cancer development.']"""

We aimed to assess the influence of HDRB on prostate volume and, hence, prostate dosing via subsequent EBRT.  Methods and materials:   Fifteen men had both pre- and post-HDRB CT performed followed by EBRT. After deidentification, the clinical target volume (CTV) was defined on each CT by a single-blinded observer. Volumes were compared for the pre- and post-HDRB scans in each patient. Radiotherapy planning was performed using the prebrachytherapy volumes aiming for the planning target volume (PTV) to be covered by 43.7Gy. After soft-tissue coregistration, this plan was also applied to the postbrachytherapy volumes.  Results:   Median volume increase was 35.4% for the CTV after HDRB. No patient experienced a decrease in CTV volume (range, 0-79% volume increase; p-value<0.001). Median volume increase was 26.1% for the PTVs, with no volume decrease observed (range, 8-56%; p<0.001). PTV proportion achieving dose target (V43.7Gy) decreased by median of 7% (range, 0-21.5%; p=0.004). The minimum dose to the PTV (D(100)%) decreased by a median of 6Gy (range, 0.5-16Gy; p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Insertion of HDRB catheters exerts substantial acute volumetric distortion on the prostate.

SC was shown to down-regulate various angiogenetic (VEGF), proliferative (Cyclin D₁, anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) gene products in these cells. SC also increased the number of annexin V-positive apoptotic bodies and the sub-G1 DNA contents of the cell cycle undergoing apoptosis through caspase-3 activation in both LNCaP and MCF-7 cells. We further confirmed that caspase-3 plays an important role in SC-induced apoptosis in LNCaP and MCF-7 cells through the use of the caspase-3 inhibitor. Moreover, we observed that SC potentiated paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells and sauchinone is a major active constituent of SC, which could induce apoptosis in the cells.

Methods:   We evaluated 1617 patients with prostate cancer who received LHRH-agonist monotherapy in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Cancer Registry between January 2003 and December 2006. Patients who had undergone surgery and/or radiation were excluded. Patients were grouped according to their dosing regimen: calendar-based, intermittent dosing, and T-based. Cox proportional hazard-regression analysis was used to estimate the hazards ratio (HR) for treatment failure.  Results:   A total of 692 patients who received an LHRH agonist as primary monotherapy for prostate cancer fit our criteria. Calendar-based dosing was used in 325 patients; 252 received T-based dosing and 115 received intermittent dosing. On multivariate analysis controlling for demographic and prostate cancer-related variables, the T-based dosing group showed a significantly lower relative risk of treatment failure (HR = 0.65, P = .02). The intermittent-dosing group trended toward a lower risk treatment failure (HR = 0.80, P = .3). Among the variables analyzed, only a Gleason score >8 (HR = 2.05, P = .01) and a pretreatment prostate-specific antigen >20 (HR = 2.00, P <.01) were associated with a higher risk of treatment failure.  Conclusions:   During the time period studied, T-based and intermittent dosing regimen of LHRH agonist had lower rates of early castrate resistance compared with standard calendar dosing, based on measurements for early androgen resistance.""","""['Jeremy M Blumberg', 'Eric O Kwon', 'T Craig Cheetham', 'Fang Niu', 'Charles E Shapiro', 'Judith Pacificar', 'Ronald K Loo', 'Stephen G Williams', 'Gary W Chien']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Hormone therapy dosing regimen affects development of castration resistance.', 'Determining dosing intervals for luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists based on serum testosterone levels: a prospective study.', 'Resistance to luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Incomplete testosterone suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists: does it happen and does it matter?', 'Time to normalization of testosterone after withdrawal of long time LH-RH agonist therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Comparative analysis of six months formulation of LHRH analogues for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Maximal testosterone suppression in prostate cancer--free vs total testosterone.', 'Investigating prostate cancer tumour-stroma interactions: clinical and biological insights from an evolutionary game.', 'Hormone therapy dosing regimen affects development of castration resistance.']"""

However, its long-term treatment is hindered by the acquired resistance which is not fully understood. Our previous study indicated that the transcriptional activity of RA receptor (RAR) is enhanced by association of MED25 with CREB-binding protein (CBP) through the PTOV domain, which is also present in prostate tumor over-expressed protein 1 (PTOV1). Here, we show that MED25 and PTOV1 reciprocally regulate RAR transcriptional activity through competitive bindings to CBP and opposite regulation of CBP recruitment to the RA-responsive gene promoter. Finally, we demonstrate that MED25 and PTOV1 differentially modulate RA sensitivity in cancer cells depending on their expression levels, suggesting a potential molecular mechanism underlying RA resistance which frequently emerges during cancer treatments.""","""['Hye-Sook Youn', 'Ui-Hyun Park', 'Eun-Joo Kim', 'Soo-Jong Um']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['The role of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 in cancer progression.', 'MED25 is distinct from TRAP220/MED1 in cooperating with CBP for retinoid receptor activation.', 'Zyxin cooperates with PTOV1 to confer retinoic acid resistance by repressing RAR activity.', 'Epigenetic patterns of the retinoic acid receptor beta2 promoter in retinoic acid-resistant thyroid cancer cells.', 'Enhancement of Calu-1 human lung carcinoma cell growth in serum-free medium by retinoids: dependence on AP-1 activation, but not on retinoid response element activation.', 'SGK2, 14-3-3, and HUWE1 Cooperate to Control the Localization, Stability, and Function of the Oncoprotein PTOV1.', 'High expression of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 (PTOV1) is a potential prognostic biomarker for cervical cancer.', 'Depleting PTOV1 sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer cells to chemotherapy through attenuating cancer stem cell traits.', 'Prostate Tumor Overexpressed-1 (PTOV1) promotes docetaxel-resistance and survival of castration resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 in cancer progression.']"""
