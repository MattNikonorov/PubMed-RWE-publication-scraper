Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 1 (LRIG1) is an endogenous inhibitor of growth factor signaling and a proposed tumor suppressor. Publicly available gene expression datasets indicate that LRIG1 may be overexpressed in prostate cancer. In our study, the expression of LRIG1 protein in prostate cancer was evaluated for the first time. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays from two different patient series: 355 Swedish patients diagnosed by transurethral resection and 293 American patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. In the Swedish series, high expression of LRIG1 correlated with Gleason score, T-stage, tumor cell proliferation, vascular density and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation. Among the 256 Swedish patients, followed by watchful waiting, high LRIG1 expression was significantly associated with short overall and prostate cancer-specific survival. In contrast, in the US series, high LRIG1 expression was significantly associated with long overall survival. In vitro cell experiments showed that LRIG1 was induced by androgen stimulation, and its expression inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation. Thus, LRIG1 expression was an independent marker for poor survival in the untreated patient series, perhaps as a secondary marker of androgen receptor and/or EGFR activation. On the contrary, LRIG1 was a marker for good prognosis after prostatectomy, which might be due to its growth inhibiting properties. We propose that LRIG1 is an important determinant of prostate cancer growth, and the implications of its expression on patient outcome depend on the clinical and biological circumstances.""","""['Marcus Thomasson', 'Baofeng Wang', 'Peter Hammarsten', 'Anna Dahlman', 'Jenny Liao Persson', 'Andreas Josefsson', 'Pär Stattin', 'Torvald Granfors', 'Lars Egevad', 'Roger Henriksson', 'Anders Bergh', 'Håkan Hedman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['LRIG1, a regulator of stem cell quiescence and a pleiotropic feedback tumor suppressor.', 'Low levels of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor in nonmalignant and malignant prostate tissue predict favorable outcome in prostate cancer patients.', 'LRIG2 in contrast to LRIG1 predicts poor survival in early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.', 'Decreased RECK expression indicating proteolytic imbalance in prostate cancer is associated with higher tumor aggressiveness and risk of prostate-specific antigen relapse after radical prostatectomy.', 'LRIG and cancer prognosis.', 'Paradoxical Behavior of Oncogenes Undermines the Somatic Mutation Theory.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Transcription in Prostate Cancer.', 'LRIG1, a regulator of stem cell quiescence and a pleiotropic feedback tumor suppressor.', 'LRIG1 expression and colorectal cancer prognosis.', 'LRIG1 is a pleiotropic androgen receptor-regulated feedback tumor suppressor in prostate cancer.']"""

In a prospective cohort study of 51,529 health professionals aged 40-75 years at baseline, we evaluated long-term aspirin use and the incidence of total, high-grade (Gleason 8-10, n = 488), regionally advanced (T3b-T4 or N1, n = 228) and lethal prostate cancer (M1, bony metastases or prostate cancer death, n = 580) from 1988-2006. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate risk associated with frequency (days/week), quantity (tablets/week), recency and duration of aspirin use after multivariable adjustment for confounders and other predictors of prostate cancer risk. A total of 4,858 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer during the 18-year study period. Men taking ≥ 2 adult-strength aspirin tablets a week had a 10% lower risk of prostate cancer (p-for-trend = 0.02). For regionally advanced cancer, we observed no significant associations with aspirin use.

Analytical approaches to address bias from more frequent prostate-specific antigen screening among aspirin users did not yield different conclusions.

In the present study, we examined the brain pathoanatomy of a monozygous twin of a large Hungarian SCA2 family with pathologically extended CAG repeats in both SCA2 alleles. This unique patient was in the initial clinical stage of SCA2 and died almost 3 years after SCA2 onset. Upon pathoanatomical investigation, we observed loss of giant Betz pyramidal cells in the primary motor cortex, degeneration of sensory thalamic nuclei, the Purkinje cell layer, and deep cerebellar nuclei, as well as select brainstem nuclei (i.e., substantia nigra, oculomotor nucleus, reticulotegmental nucleus of the pons, facial, lateral vestibular, and raphe interpositus nuclei, inferior olive). All of these degenerated brain gray matter structures are known as consistent targets of the underlying pathological process in heterozygous SCA2 patients.

Such a network could help improve standards of care throughout the region, providing patients, practitioners and health authorities with a means of identifying high-quality units and providing a system of quality control and audit.

CARM1 catalyzes methylation of diverse protein substrates. Prior attempts to purify the full-length mouse CARM1 protein have proven unsatisfactory. The full-length protein expressed in Escherichia coli forms insoluble inclusion bodies that are difficult to denature and refold. The presented results demonstrate the use of a novel HaloTag™ technology to purify full-length CARM1 from both E. coli and mammalian HEK293T cells. A small amount of CARM1 was purified from E. coli; however, the protein was truncated on the N-terminus by 10-50 amino acids, most likely due to endogenous proteolytic activity. In contrast, substantial quantities of soluble full-length CARM1 were purified from transiently transfected HEK293T cells. The CARM1 from HEK293T cells was isolated alongside a number of co-purifying interacting proteins. The covalent bond formed between the HaloTag and the HaloLink resin allowed the use of stringent wash conditions without risk of eluting the CARM1 protein.

Methods:   Consecutive patients undergoing robotic RP for prostate cancer were prospectively evaluated. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire was administered pre- and postoperatively to all patients. Patients were then grouped by AU status. A linear mixed model was used to compare the rate of recovery in incontinence (UIN), irritative (UIR), and sexual domain scores between the two groups. A t-test was used to compare UIN, UIR, and sexual domain scores at specific time points.  Results:   A total of 229 patients underwent robotic RP and filled out a preoperative and at least one postoperative EPIC questionnaire.

It has a critical role in prostate cancer (PC) including Pten loss-driven carcinogenesis, but the molecular basis of this remains unclear. We investigated the effect of GRP78 and its putative client proteins, including androgen receptor (AR) in clinical PC. Expression of GRP78 and key Hsp70-hsp90 client proteins (HER2, HER3, AR and AKT) were studied in an incidence tissue microarray (TMA) of prostate cancer. The relationship of GRP78 and AR was further tested in in vitro cell models (LNCaP and its derived LNCaP-CR subclone) and a matched TMA of hormone-naïve (HNPC) and castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In vitro and in vivo expression of GRP78 and client proteins were assessed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively, using the weighted histoscore method. Significant co-expression of GRP78, pAKT, HER2, HER3 and AR was observed in PC. Abnormal AR, GRP78 and pAKT expression have significant impact on patient survival. GRP78 expression in AR(+) tumours was significantly higher than in AR(-) tumours. In keeping with our clinical data, activation of AR by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) potently activated GRP78 expression in both LNCaP and LNCaP-CR cells. For the first time, using a matched HNPC and CRPC TMA, enhanced cytoplasmic and membranous GRP78 expression was observed in CRPC. Future prospective studies are therefore warranted to validate GRP78 as prognostic marker and therapeutic target, in the context of the AR and pAKT status. In summary, GRP78 is co-expressed with Hsp70-hsp90 client proteins. Up-regulated expression of AR and GRP78 expression in untreated prostate cancer predicts a less favourable outcome.

Results:   Four SNPs in the regions of the APOE, LOC100129500, TOMM40, and EPC2 genes reached genome-wide significance for associations with one or more CSF biomarkers. SNPs in CCDC134, ABCG2, SREBF2, and NFATC4, although not reaching genome-wide significance, were identified as potential candidates.  Conclusions:   In addition to known candidate genes, APOE, TOMM40, and one hypothetical gene LOC100129500 partially overlapping APOE; one novel gene, EPC2, and several other interesting genes were associated with CSF biomarkers that are related to AD.

Methods:   REDUCE was a 4-year international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Inclusion criteria were men between 50 and 75 years of age, a serum prostate-specific antigen level of 2.5-10.0 ng/ml (50-60 years) or 3.0-10.0 ng/ml (>60 years), and a single, negative prostate biopsy (6-12 cores) within 6 months before enrollment.

Results:   A total of 134 Asians, including 57 Japanese, were randomized to the study treatment. During the study period, the incidence of prostate cancer in the placebo and dutasteride groups was 19.6% (11/56) and 9.3% (5/54), respectively (relative risk reduction, 54%; 95% confidence intervals, -27 to 83%, P = 0.12), in the Asian subpopulation. Fewer tumors with the Gleason scores of 7-10 and 8-10 were detected among dutasteride-treated men. Although the incidences of drug-related sexual adverse events were higher in the dutasteride group, only in rare occasions did they lead to drug discontinuation.

Presented at the 2009 Joint Spine Section Meeting. Clinical article""","""Object:   Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy to cause death in men, with metastases to the spine being the most common site of metastatic burden. A retrospective observational study was performed to determine survival of patients in whom spinal metastasis from prostate cancer had been diagnosed.  Methods:   The patient population was obtained from the Prostate Clinical Research Information System (CRIS) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Patients were observed over a period of 19 years, between June 1990 and April 2009. Clinical covariates were studied in their relationship to overall survival, the primary outcome, by using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.  Results:   Of a total of 9010 patients in the Prostate CRIS database, 333 were identified as having developed spinal metastases. The median overall survival after diagnosis of spinal metastasis was 24 months (95% CI 21-28 months). The estimated 1-year overall survival was 73% (95% CI 67%-77%). In 85% of patients, at least 1 additional site of metastasis was documented. Among 28 patients who had no additional sites of metastases, the median survival was 55.9 months, whereas an increasing burden of disease was associated with shorter survival (p = 0.0001). The association was observed regardless of whether the metastatic burden was characterized as the presence of additional (nonspinal) bone metastasis, the presence of additional nonbone metastasis, or as the number of concomitant metastatic sites (all p = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, a higher prostate-specific antigen level at the diagnosis of spinal metastasis, a longer duration between the diagnosis of prostate cancer and spinal metastasis, and the presence of additional metastasis at the time of diagnosis of spinal metastasis (all p = 0.0001) were independently associated with a shorter overall survival.  Conclusions:   The results of this study are important for oncologists, neurosurgeons, and primary care physicians who have patients with prostate cancer that metastasizes to the spine, because these results can be used to form a prognosis and guide the physician in making appropriate decisions regarding the patient's treatment. Future work should include building a predictive model that accurately determines survival in patients with metastatic disease, because this would guide the physician in devising the most appropriate treatment plan for each patient.""","""['Dan Michael Drzymalski', 'William K Oh', 'Lillian Werner', 'Meredith M Regan', 'Philip Kantoff', 'Sagun Tuli']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Neurosurg Spine""","""['Factors associated with improved survival following surgical treatment for metastatic prostate cancer in the spine: retrospective analysis of 29 patients in a single center.', 'Sarcopenia Predicts Overall Survival in Patients with Lung, Breast, Prostate, or Myeloma Spine Metastases Undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), Independent of Histology.', 'A Novel Nomogram for Survival Prediction of Patients with Spinal Metastasis From Prostate Cancer.', 'A systematic review of clinical outcomes for patients diagnosed with skin cancer spinal metastases.', 'Contemporary spinal oncology treatment paradigms and outcomes for metastatic tumors to the spine: A systematic review of breast, prostate, renal, and lung metastases.', 'Differentiation of Bone Metastasis in Elderly Patients With Lung Adenocarcinoma Using Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms.', 'Bone Metastases and Health in Prostate Cancer: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Implications.', 'Risk of Myelopathy Following Second Local Treatment after Initial Irradiation of Spine Metastasis.', '3D Printing and Bioprinting to Model Bone Cancer: The Role of Materials and Nanoscale Cues in Directing Cell Behavior.', 'Outcomes of Patients With Spinal Metastases From Prostate Cancer Treated With Conventionally-Fractionated External Beam Radiation Therapy.']"""

An additional advantage of this cell type is that it is possible to target specific antigens through the activation of receptors, such as FcR (the receptor for the IgG Fc fragment) and TLR (toll-like Receptor). Thus, the uptake capacity of DCs can be improved, thereby increasing antigen presentation. This, in turn, would lead to an enhanced immune response, and, in some instances, the tolerance/anergy of immune effector cells present in cancer patients could be reverted. Here we studied various nanotargeting systems, including liposomes and gold nanoparticles of a peptide-based immunotherapeutic vaccine for the treatment of androgen-responsive prostate cancer. Building blocks of the immunogenic peptide consisted of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), also known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) peptide (B- and T-cell epitope), in tandem with a T-helper epitope corresponding to the 830-844 region of tetanus toxoid. Three new peptides with several modifications at the N-terminal (palmitoyl, acetyl, and FITC) were synthesized. These peptides also contained a Cys as C-terminal residue to facilitate grafting onto gold nanoparticles. To target different antigen formulations to human DCs, the Fc was activated with a cross-linking spacer to generate a free thiol group and thus facilitate conjugation onto gold nanoparticles, liposomes, and peptide. Our results show that gold nanoparticles and liposomes targeted to FcRs of human DCs are effective antigen delivery carriers and induce a strong immune response with respect to nontargeted LHRH-TT-nanoparticle conjugates and a superior response to that of naked antigens. In addition, dual labeling using gold and FITC-peptide allowed DC tracking by flow cytometry as well as transmission electron microscopy. Nanoparticles were observed to show a homogeneous distribution throughout the cytoplasm. These results open up a new approach to the development of a novel strategy for cancer vaccines.""","""['Luis J Cruz', 'Felix Rueda', 'Begoña Cordobilla', 'Lorena Simón', 'Leticia Hosta', 'Fernando Albericio', 'Joan Carles Domingo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Effect of TLR ligands co-encapsulated with multiepitopic antigen in nanoliposomes targeted to human DCs via Fc receptor for cancer vaccines.', '""Pathogen-mimicking"" nanoparticles for vaccine delivery to dendritic cells.', 'Targeting dendritic cells with antigen-containing liposomes: a highly effective procedure for induction of antitumor immunity and for tumor immunotherapy.', 'Nanotechnology-based manipulation of dendritic cells for enhanced immunotherapy strategies.', 'Targeting nanoparticles to dendritic cells for immunotherapy.', 'An Overview of Nanomaterial Applications in Pharmacology.', 'Fc-engineered antibodies with immune effector functions completely abolished.', 'Gold Compounds and the Anticancer Immune Response.', 'Design and Encapsulation of Immunomodulators onto Gold Nanoparticles in Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Mimicking Pathogens to Augment the Potency of Liposomal Cancer Vaccines.']"""

Methods:   The clinical diagnosis was based on the end-fire transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings and later confirmed by CT. The patient had several surgical scars and radiation-induced effects in the lower abdomen, therefore the placement of a percutaneous sovrapubic catheter was considered hazardous. The placement of a transurethral catheter was impossible because of firm meatal stenosis due to previous penile partial amputation and growing tissue that suggested local recurrence of penile cancer.  Results:   Transurethral placement of a 8 Fr catheter was possible under radiologic/ultrasound control using a hydrophilic glidewire. The definitive treatment also included percutaneous transperineal drainage and placement of a 8 Fr pig-tail drain under TRUS. Subsequent surgical treatment of the penis showed low grade superficial squamous cell carcinoma. Management and follow-up of prostatic abscess is based on TRUS imaging. After 4 years of follow-up, abscess recurrence was observed and treated with a urethral catheter and antibiotics.  Conclusion:   Urethral stenosis due to penile cancer is a predisposing factor in the development of prostatic abscesses. Placement of a bladder catheter and percutaneous drainage of the abscess are the mainstays of treatment. In malignant urethral stenosis, the conservative management of a prostatic abscess is safe and efficacious in a long-term follow-up.

The aim of this study is to evaluate if the use of saturation needle biopsy technique may increase this rate.  Materials and methods:   From January 2004 to June 2006, 780 patients with hypoecogenic nodule at TRUS and/or PSA values between 2.5 and 10 ng/ml, underwent TRUS 10-core prostate needle biopsy, performed by the same operator Isolated HGPIN was detected in 26 cases (3.3%).

In this study, the mechanism(s) of oligo-arginine peptide in prostate cells was further analyzed. The length of the oligo-arginine peptide appears to be critical for the efficiency of uptake by prostate cells: poly (11)-arginine (R11) > poly (9)-arginine (R9) > poly (13)-arginine peptide (R13). The uptake of R11 peptide by prostate cells is mediated by macropinocytosis as evidenced by the fact that uptake can be blocked by a macropinocytosis inhibitor. However, the use of an inhibitor for carbohydrate chain elongation of glycosaminoglycan or inhibitors for carbohydrate synthesis of glycoprotein via either O-link or N-link showed minimal effects on R11 uptake. Nevertheless, pentosan sulfate (PentS) or dextran sulfate (DS) exhibited the highest inhibitory effect on R11 uptake in several prostate cells treated with various soluble glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or anionic polymers. It is known that laminin receptor has been characterized as a PentS binding partner. Knocking down 37LRP (laminin receptor precursor) expression in prostate cells showed a reduction in their ability to uptake R11 peptides. In conclusion, laminin receptor is one of the initial binding site(s) responsible for R11 peptide uptake in prostate cells.""","""['Jian Zhou', 'Wei Liu', 'Rey-Chen Pong', 'Guiyang Hao', 'Xiankai Sun', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Novel Application of Cell Penetrating R11 Peptide for Diagnosis of Bladder Cancer.', 'In vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging of integrin α2β1 in prostate cancer with cell-penetrating-peptide-conjugated DGEA probe.', 'Enhanced transdermal delivery of lornoxicam by nanostructured lipid carrier gels modified with polyarginine peptide for treatment of carrageenan-induced rat paw edema.', 'Current Understanding of Physicochemical Mechanisms for Cell Membrane Penetration of Arginine-rich Cell Penetrating Peptides: Role of Glycosaminoglycan Interactions.', 'On the importance of electrostatic interactions between cell penetrating peptides and membranes: a pathway toward tumor cell selectivity?', 'Membrane Internalization Mechanisms and Design Strategies of Arginine-Rich Cell-Penetrating Peptides.', 'Bifidobacterium dentium-derived y-glutamylcysteine suppresses ER-mediated goblet cell stress and reduces TNBS-driven colonic inflammation.', 'Hexokinase II-derived cell-penetrating peptide targets mitochondria and triggers apoptosis in cancer cells.', 'Inhibiting bladder tumor growth with a cell penetrating R11 peptide derived from the p53 C-terminus.', 'Intracellular Delivery of Molecular Cargo Using Cell-Penetrating Peptides and the Combination Strategies.']"""

Recruitment occurred in community urology practices in Washington State, hospital-based urology clinics affiliated with the University of Southern California, and Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. Eligible study participants included men over age 21 diagnosed with local stage prostate cancer between May 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006.  Results:   Fifty-two percent of survey respondents (379) reported using one or more types of CAM. Of the patients, 51% used one CAM method, 26% used two methods, and 23% used three or more methods. The most commonly reported category was mind-body therapies (65%). Only 43% of patients discussed their CAM use with a health professional; of those, 20% informed their primary care physician and 30% told the doctor managing their prostate cancer care.

Single-cell Raman spectra are acquired from irradiated and unirradiated cultures up to 5 days post-irradiation. Principal component analysis is used to distinguish the uniquely radiation-induced spectral changes from inherent sources of spectral variability arising from cell cycle differences and other known factors. We observe uniquely radiation-induced spectral changes which are correlated with both the irradiated dose and the incubation time post-irradiation. The spectral changes induced by radiation arise from biochemical differences in lipids, nucleic acids, amino acids and conformational protein structures between irradiated and unirradiated cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first use of RS to observe radiation-induced biochemical differences in single cells, and is the first use of vibrational spectroscopy to observe uniquely radiation-induced biochemical differences in single cells independent of concurrent cell-cycle- or cell-death-related processes.""","""['Q Matthews', 'Ag Brolo', 'J Lum', 'X Duan', 'A Jirasek']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Biochemical signatures of in vitro radiation response in human lung, breast and prostate tumour cells observed with Raman spectroscopy.', 'Variability in Raman spectra of single human tumor cells cultured in vitro: correlation with cell cycle and culture confluency.', 'A Raman spectroscopic study of cell response to clinical doses of ionizing radiation.', 'Single-hit mechanism of tumour cell killing by radiation.', 'Ionizing radiation-induced bystander effects, potential targets for modulation of radiotherapy.', 'Toward Gene-Correlated Spatially Resolved Metabolomics with Fingerprint Coherent Raman Imaging.', 'Understanding radiation response and cell cycle variation in brain tumour cells using Raman spectroscopy.', 'Raman Spectroscopy Revealed Cell Passage-Dependent Distinct Biochemical Alterations in Radiation-Resistant Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Raman profile alterations of irradiated human nasopharyngeal cancer cells detected with laser tweezer Raman spectroscopy.', 'Discrimination of radiosensitive and radioresistant murine lymphoma cells by Raman spectroscopy and SERS.']"""

Aims:   We sought to estimate survival from first VTE in consecutive patients with known malignancy receiving extended low molecular weight heparin therapy.  Methods:   Five hundred and fifty-nine consecutive patients presenting to the Thrombosis Unit Registry at Auckland City Hospital between January 1997 and October 2006 were observed. Events were confirmed by standard imaging procedures. The diagnosis date and site of VTE as well as the type of malignancy were recorded.  Results:   Mean follow up was 21.4 months. Overall median survival from VTE was 13.5 months. Six-month, one-, two- and five-year survivals were 64%, 53%, 43% and 33% respectively. Survival was longest for haematological malignancy at 44.4 months, followed by prostate, bowel, breast (metastatic breast), lung and pancreatic malignancy at 29.4, 27.4, 15.5 (6.2), 2.4 and 1.9 months respectively. Median survival varied with thrombotic location from 31.1 months for upper limb/jugular deep vein thrombosis reducing to only 10.1 months for iliocaval/abdominal deep vein thrombosis, but this did not reach statistical significance. Survival from cancer diagnosis was also determined.  Discussion:   The 1-year 53% survival in cancer patients with VTE treated using extended low molecular weight heparin is longer than that reported from large registry and population studies in which specific patient information and therapeutic regimens are unknown. Survival is critically determined by tumour type and correlates with tumour stage in women with breast cancer.

Design:   We conducted a 12-month prospective observational study at a tertiary referral centre.  Patients and measurements:   We investigated changes in abdominal fat distribution and insulin resistance in 26 men (70.6±6.8 years) with nonmetastatic prostate cancer during the first year of ADT.  Results:   Twelve months of ADT increased visceral abdominal fat area by 22% (from 160.8±61.7 to 195.9±69.7 cm(2) ; P<0.01) and subcutaneous abdominal fat area by 13% (from 240.7±107.5 to 271.3±92.8 cm(2) ; P<0.01). Fat mass increased by 14% (+3.4 kg; P<0.001) and lean tissue mass decreased by 3.6% (-1·9 kg; P<0.001). Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) increased by 12% (2.50±1.12 to 2.79±1.31, P<0.05). There was no change in fasting glucose or glycated haemoglobin levels. Total testosterone (TT) was inversely associated with visceral fat area independent of oestradiol (E2), but E2 was not associated with visceral fat area independent of TT. Visceral fat area, not TT or E2, was independently associated with insulin resistance.  Conclusions:   ADT for prostate cancer results in accumulation of both visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat. Increased visceral fat area appears more closely linked to testosterone than oestradiol deficiency. Increased insulin resistance may arise secondary to visceral fat accumulation, rather than as a direct result of sex steroid deficiency.""","""['E J Hamilton', 'E Gianatti', 'B J Strauss', 'J Wentworth', 'D Lim-Joon', 'D Bolton', 'J D Zajac', 'M Grossmann']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)""","""['Androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer: how should the side effects be monitored and treated?', 'Increased risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in men with prostate carcinoma who receive androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Factors impacting all-cause mortality in prostate cancer brachytherapy patients with or without androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular mortality: an inconvenient truth.', 'Plasma metabolomics in male primary and functional hypogonadism.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer Influences Body Composition Increasing Risk of Sarcopenia.', 'Gaining metabolic insight in older men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer (the ADT & Metabolism Study): Protocol of a longitudinal, observational, cohort study.', 'Diabetes and the Prostate: Elevated Fasting Glucose, Insulin Resistance and Higher Levels of Adrenal Steroids in Prostate Cancer.', 'On the Need to Distinguish between Insulin-Normal and Insulin-Resistant Patients in Testosterone Therapy.']"""

The cooperation of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) with androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway has been documented to contribute to this dominance. HBx, a multifunctional viral regulator, has been documented to induce promoter hypermethylation and low expression of tumor suppressor genes via activation of DNA methyl-transferase (DNMT) in hepatocarcinogenesis. In prostate cancer, hypermethylation of AR promoter is associated with loss of AR expression. However, the relationship among HBx, DNMTs, the methylation status of AR and AR expression in HBV-associated HCC is still unknown. In this report, we found that HBx correlated with high levels of AR in HCC cases and induced AR expression by stimulating its transcription in liver cell lines. HBx correlated with high expression of DNMTs in HCC cases too. Both in vivo and in vitro, however, the expression of AR was not associated with its promoter methylation status, and the methylation status of AR was not regulated by DNMTs. AR expression is higher in peritumoral tissues than in tumors, as well as being higher in HBV-associated HCC than in HBV-negative cases. Therefore, HBx-induced high expression of AR plays a role during hepatocarcinogenesis, but is not involved with its promoter methylation or DNMTs.

Furthermore, along with the use of a generated recombinant GDF-9 protein, these cells were then analyzed for any changes in their invasiveness and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated genes. GDF-9 was shown to promote the invasiveness of PC-3 cells together with an induction in the expression of genes including SNAI1, RhoC, ROCK-1, and N-cadherin, while reducing levels of E-cadherin. These expression changes are characteristic of the onset of EMT, and resulted in the cells having a more mesenchymal-like morphology. Treating these cells with activin-like kinase-5 (ALK-5) inhibitor, demonstrated that GDF-9 induced up-regulation of these molecules was ALK-5 dependant.

The consequence of AC overexpression is the ability to convert ceramide, which is often produced as a proapoptotic response to stress, to sphingosine, which can then be converted to the prosurvival molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate. In addition to their ability to metabolize ceramide produced in response to stress, we show here that prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing AC also have increased lysosomal density and increased levels of autophagy. Furthermore, pretreatment with 3-methyladenine restores sensitivity of these cells to treatment with C(6) ceramide. We also observed increased expression of the lysosomal stabilizing protein KIF5B and increased sensitivity to the lysosomotropic agent LCL385. Thus, we conclude that AC overexpression increases autophagy in prostate cancer cells, and that increased autophagy enhances resistance to ceramide.""","""['L S Turner', 'J C Cheng', 'T H Beckham', 'T E Keane', 'J S Norris', 'X Liu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Acid ceramidase controls apoptosis and increases autophagy in human melanoma cells treated with doxorubicin.', 'Acid ceramidase upregulation in prostate cancer cells confers resistance to radiation: AC inhibition, a potential radiosensitizer.', 'Novel off-target effect of tamoxifen--inhibition of acid ceramidase activity in cancer cells.', 'Acid ceramidase upregulation in prostate cancer: role in tumor development and implications for therapy.', 'Acid ceramidase, an emerging target for anti-cancer and anti-angiogenesis.', 'Potential role of autophagy induced by FLT3-ITD and acid ceramidase in acute myeloid leukemia chemo-resistance: new insights.', 'Impaired autophagic flux and dedifferentiation in podocytes lacking Asah1 gene: Role of lysosomal TRPML1 channel.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Acid ceramidase controls apoptosis and increases autophagy in human melanoma cells treated with doxorubicin.', 'Ablation of Acid Ceramidase Impairs Autophagy and Mitochondria Activity in Melanoma Cells.']"""

Methods:   Tumor tissues and non-neoplastic tissues at variable distances from the tumor foci were retrieved from 25 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded prostatectomy specimens and subjected to DNA extraction. The methylation levels were assessed by means of different assay technologies.  Results:   Significantly increased methylation levels in cancer specimens were found for all promoter regions (GSTP1: 21/25, 84%; RARβ2: 24/25, 96%; APC: 21/25, 84%; PITX2: 20/25, 80%) and in most samples containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Several samples showed increased RARβ2 and APC methylation in adjacent non-neoplastic tissue. An association between the methylation extent of GSTP1, APC and RARβ2, respectively, and primary Gleason grade was detectable. GSTP1 methylation was also associated with extraprostatic tumor extension.  Conclusion:   GSTP1, APC, RARβ2 and PITX2 methylation occur frequently in prostate cancer, making these markers sensitive tools for the detection of neoplastic lesions in the prostate. For RARβ2, the results suggest a kind of methylation field effect which could be helpful for the detection of prostate cancer.

Therefore, we investigated the FGFR3 mutation status in a comprehensive series of prostate tumors.  Methods:   102 archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostate tumors of patients treated with radical prostatectomy [with a low-grade subgroup (Gleason score ≤6) of 29 patients] as well as 29 incidental prostate tumors [low-grade tumors (Gleason score ≤6); n = 22] and 16 benign prostatic hyperplasia samples obtained by transurethral resection of the prostate were investigated. After microdissection and DNA isolation, all FGFR3 mutation hotspots discovered in human malignancies were analyzed using the SNaPshot(©) approach or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.  Results:   All cases could successfully be analyzed by SNaPshot; 80 cases were investigated using RFLP. No mutation in FGFR3 could be detected in any of the analyzed cases.  Conclusion:   The most recently reported FGFR3 mutations in low-grade prostate tumors could not be verified in our series. There were also no mutations in prostate tumors from patients with concomitant bladder tumors as reported previously.

Current risk stratification schema identify patients with low-risk disease who are presumed to be most suitable for AS. However, some men with higher risk disease also elect AS; outcomes for such men have not been widely reported.  Patients and methods:   Men managed with AS at University of California, San Francisco, were classified as low- or intermediate-risk based on serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason grade, extent of biopsy involvement, and T stage. Clinical and demographic characteristics, and progression in terms of Gleason score, PSA kinetics, and active treatment were compared between men with low- and intermediate-risk tumors.  Results:   Compared to men with low-risk tumors, those with intermediate-risk tumors were older (mean, 64.9 v 62.3 years) with higher mean PSA values (10.9 v 5.1 ng/mL), and more tumor involvement (mean, 20.4% v 15.3% positive biopsy cores; all P < .01). Within 4 years of the first positive biopsy, the clinical risk group did not differ in terms of the proportions experiencing progression-free survival, (low [54%] v intermediate [61%]; log-rank P = .22) or the proportions who underwent active treatment (low [30%] v intermediate [35%]; log-rank P = .88). Among men undergoing surgery, none were node positive and none had biochemical recurrence within 3 years.  Conclusion:   Selected men with intermediate-risk features be appropriate candidates for AS, and are not necessarily more likely to progress. AS for these men may provide an opportunity to further reduce overtreatment of disease that is unlikely to progress to advanced cancer.""","""['Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Joan F Hilton', 'Adam C Reese', 'Harras B Zaid', 'Sima P Porten', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'Maxwell V Meng', 'Kirsten L Greene', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Outcomes of initially expectantly managed patients with low or intermediate risk screen-detected localized prostate cancer.', 'Active surveillance for the management of prostate cancer in a contemporary cohort.', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network® Favorable Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer-Is Active Surveillance Appropriate?', 'Comparison of Pathological and Oncologic Outcomes of Favorable Risk Gleason Score 3 + 4 and Low Risk Gleason Score 6 Prostate Cancer: Considerations for Active Surveillance.', 'Identifying intermediate-risk candidates for active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'Fifteen-year results of the ProtecT study-commentary.', 'Comparison of Outcomes of Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Versus Low-Risk Localised Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Spatial Profiling of the Prostate Cancer Tumor Microenvironment Reveals Multiple Differences in Gene Expression and Correlation with Recurrence Risk.', 'Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Data.', 'MRI-guided focused ultrasound focal therapy for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer: a phase 2b, multicentre study.']"""

We report an anticancer effect and mechanism of GL against human prostate cancer cells. Treatment with GL significantly inhibited the viability of human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (androgen-dependent) and its androgen-independent variant (C81) with an IC(50) of ∼1 μM (24-h treatment), at pharmacologically relevant concentrations standardized to its major active constituent z-guggulsterone. The GL-induced growth inhibition correlated with apoptosis induction as evidenced by an increase in cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation and sub-G(0)/G(1)-DNA fraction, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The GL-induced apoptosis was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. The induction of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bak and a decrease of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bcl-2 were observed in GL-treated cells. SV40 immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Bax-Bak double-knockout mice were significantly more resistant to GL-induced cell killing compared with wild-type cells. It is interesting to note that a representative normal prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC) was relatively more resistant to GL-mediated cellular responses compared with prostate cancer cells. The GL treatment caused the activation of JNK that functioned upstream of Bax activation in apoptosis response. The GL-induced conformational change of Bax and apoptosis were significantly suppressed by genetic suppression of JNK activation. In conclusion, the present study indicates that ROS-dependent apoptosis by GL is regulated by JNK signaling axis.""","""['Dong Xiao', 'Yan Zeng', 'Lakshmi Prakash', 'Vladmir Badmaev', 'Muhammed Majeed', 'Shivendra V Singh']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['Guggulsterone-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells is caused by reactive oxygen intermediate dependent activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase.', 'Targeting beta-catenin signaling to induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells by z-guggulsterone and Gugulipid extract of Ayurvedic medicine plant Commiphora mukul.', 'Caspase-dependent apoptosis induction by guggulsterone, a constituent of Ayurvedic medicinal plant Commiphora mukul, in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells is mediated by Bax and Bak.', 'Guggul for hyperlipidemia: a review by the Natural Standard Research Collaboration.', 'GUGULIPID: a natural cholesterol-lowering agent.', 'Potential of guggulsterone, a farnesoid X receptor antagonist, in the prevention and treatment of cancer.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Googling the Guggul (Commiphora and Boswellia) for Prevention of Chronic Diseases.', 'Role of traditional Islamic and Arabic plants in cancer therapy.', 'Potential therapeutic targets of Guggulsterone in cancer.']"""

The GI(50) values for eighteen of the compounds were below 10 μM in at least one cell line. Two cancer cells (MCF-7 and HT-29) proved to be the most sensitive to five compounds (1b, 2b, 3b, 4b and 5b), with growth inhibition in the nanomolar range, and compounds 1b, 3b, 7b, 8b and 9b gave values of less than 1 μM. In addition, all of the aforementioned compounds exhibited lower GI(50) values than some of the standard chemotherapeutic drugs used as references. The results also reveal that the nature of the aliphatic chain (methyl is better than benzyl) at the selenium position and the nature of the heteroatom (Se better than S) have a marked influence on the antiproliferative activity of the compounds. These findings reinforce our earlier hypothesis concerning the determinant role of the selenomethyl group as a scaffold for the biological activity of this type of compound. Considering both the cytotoxic parameters and the selectivity index (which was compared in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells), compounds 2b and 8b (with a selenomethyl moiety) displayed the best profiles, with GI(50) values ranging from 0.34 nM to 6.07 μM in the five cell lines tested. Therefore, compounds 2b and 8b were evaluated by flow cytometric analysis for their effects on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. 2b was the most active, with an apoptogenic effect similar to camptothecin, which was used as a positive control. Both of them provoked cell cycle arrest leading to the accumulation of cells in either G(2)/M and S phase.

Several studies have demonstrated a reduction in penile size after open radical retropubic prostatectomy. The objective of this study is to describe changes in penile length after after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP).  Patients and methods:   We performed a randomized, open label, multicenter study in men with normal erectile function who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. We evaluated changes in measured stretched penile length (SPL), a secondary end point of the study, in a subset of men from a single site who underwent RALRP by one surgeon. They were randomized to either intraurethral alprostadil 125 to 250 μg daily or oral sildenafil citrate 50 mg daily for 9 months. SPL was measured from pubic bone to coronal sulcus using a semirigid ruler before surgery and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, and 11 months.  Results:   A total of 127 patients were enrolled and 94 completed the 11-month follow-up. The mean patient age was 56.5 years. Baseline mean SPL (cm) before surgery was 11.77 and decreased to 11.13 at 1 month (P<0.0001). A trend toward recovery of SPL was seen at 3 and 6 months. Mean SPL was not significantly different from baseline at 9, 10, and 11 months.  Conclusions:   This report describes changes in SPL over time after RALRP for prostate cancer.

Methods:   We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2006-2008, and identified 1,670 survivors and 18,197 controls. Specific cancer sites included prostate, colorectal, female breast, and gynecologic (cervical, ovarian, uterine). Covariates included age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, marital status, health insurance, and physical and mental health. Gender stratified logistic regression models associated survivorship with each health behavior.  Results:   4.9% of men and 7.7% of women reported a cancer history. In adjusted regression models, male survivors were similar to gender matched controls, while female survivors had comparable tobacco and alcohol use but had more physical inactivity than controls (OR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8). By site, breast cancer survivors were more likely to be physically inactive (OR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0) and gynecologic cancer survivors were more likely to report current tobacco use (OR 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.8).

The choice of treatment largely depends on their baseline health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE). By consensus, physicians recommend treatment if the patient's HALE is ten or more years. However, the estimation of HALE is difficult. Although subjective by nature, self-rated health (SRH) is a robust predictor of mortality. We studied the usefulness of SRH in estimating HALE in patients who are considering treatment for LPC.  Methods:   A total of 144 LPC patients from a large urology private practice in Norfolk, Virginia, were surveyed before they had chosen a treatment option.  Results:   HALE determined by SRH correlated well with objective health measures and was higher than age-based life expectancy by an average of 2 years. The observed difference in life expectancy due to SRH adjustment was higher among patients with a better socioeconomic and health profile.  Conclusions:   SRH is an easy-to-use indicator of HALE in LPC patients. A table for HALE estimation by age and SRH is provided for men aged 70-80 years. Additional research with larger samples and prospective study designs are needed before the SRH method can be used in primary care and urology settings.""","""['Ravinder Mohan', 'Hind A Beydoun', 'May A Beydoun', 'Myra Barnes-Eley', 'John Davis', 'Raymond Lance', 'Paul Schellhammer']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""[""Patients' Survival Expectations With and Without Their Chosen Treatment for Prostate Cancer."", 'Disability-Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) for 315 Diseases and Injuries and Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE) in Iran and its Neighboring Countries, 1990-2015: Findings from Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.', 'Describing the population health burden of depression: health-adjusted life expectancy by depression status in Canada.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Competitive morbidity ant its impact on life expectancy: evaluation and inclusion in the therapeutic decision regarding localized prostatic cancer.', 'Antimicrobial Peptide Brevinin-1RL1 from Frog Skin Secretion Induces Apoptosis and Necrosis of Tumor Cells.', 'Self-reported health and survival in older patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma.', 'Cost-effectiveness of the long-term use of temozolomide for treating newly diagnosed glioblastoma in Germany.', 'Question order sensitivity of subjective well-being measures: focus on life satisfaction, self-rated health, and subjective life expectancy in survey instruments.', 'Healthy life expectancy and the correlates of self-rated health in Bangladesh in 1996 and 2002.']"""

Discussion of all treatment options should be undertaken, with the patient having the opportunity to meet a clinical oncologist and urological surgeon. Treatment options include active surveillance, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and surgery. Low-dose rate brachytherapy involves the permanent insertion of radioactive seeds (half-life 60 days) under ultrasound guidance. It is a good option for many men as impotence and incontinence rates are lower than for surgery and it has reduced hospital costs and time off work and high rates of relapse-free survival (90-95% in low-risk disease). External beam radiotherapy offers a good treatment for men with more locally advanced disease and men who do not want to undergo an anaesthetic. New developments allow higher doses of radiotherapy to be given with reduced relapse rates and reduced toxicity to neighbouring structures such as bowel and bladder. High-dose rate brachytherapy involves the temporary insertion of applicators into the prostate so that a high energy source can temporarily be fed into different positions in the prostate, ensuring a high dose to the prostate gland but minimising dose to the bladder and bowel.

Methods:   Cell proliferation was examined using sulforhodamine B assay. Cell-cycle progression, Ca(2+) mobilization and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)) were detected using flow cytometric analysis. Protein expression was detected using Western blot.  Results:   WJ9708012 displayed an antiproliferative and apoptotic activity in human hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells with IC(50) values of 6.4 and 5.3 μmol/L in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. WJ9708012 induced a prompt increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) level and activation of protein kinase C (PKC)-α. The cleavage of μ-calpain was also induced by WJ9708012. Furthermore, WJ9708012 induced cell-cycle arrest at G(1)-phase associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 expressions. It also caused a rapid and time-dependent decrease of phosphorylation level of mTOR (Ser(2448)), 4E-BP1 (Thr(37)/Thr(46)/Thr(70)) and p70S6K (Thr(389)), indicating the inhibition of mTOR-mediated translational pathways. The ER stress was activated by the identification of up-regulated GADD153 and glucose-regulated protein-78 protein levels. The subsequent mitochondrial stress was also identified by the observation of a decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expressions, an increased truncated Bid and Bad and a loss of ΔΨ(m).  Conclusion:   WJ9708012 induces an increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and activation of PKC-α.

To examine the potential impact of health care reform on stage at diagnosis, we analyzed the relationship between stage at diagnosis and insurance status for patients who were nearly elderly (55-64 years old) and younger elderly (65-74 years old). We examined patients diagnosed with 8 common cancers from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2007, using data from the National Cancer Database, a hospital-based cancer registry jointly sponsored by the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons, which includes approximately 70% of all malignant cancers in the United States treated at 1400 facilities throughout the United States. Cancer site-specific multivariable log binomial models were used to generate risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates for advanced stage of disease at diagnosis (stage III or IV vs stage I) by insurance category, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and area level education. The final analytic cohort contained 843,177 patients. For each cancer site, uninsured and Medicaid-insured patients had the highest proportion of American Joint Committee on Cancer stages III and IV cancers at diagnosis, and those with private insurance and Medicare plus supplemental insurance the lowest. Risk ratios (95% CI) for uninsured patients compared with privately insured patients were 1.75 (1.64-1.86) for prostate, 1.12 (1.11-1.14) for lung/bronchus, 2.08 (1.98-2.17) for breast, 1.25 (1.22-1.27) for colorectal, 1.51 (1.40-1.64) for uterine corpus, 1.91 (1.73-2.12) for urinary bladder, 1.80 (1.62-2.01) for melanoma, and 1.37 (1.24-1.51) for thyroid cancers. Lower RRs (95% CI) observed for patients with Medicare coverage alone were 1.23 (1.17-1.29) for prostate, 1.05 (1.03-1.06) for lung/bronchus, 1.41 (1.33-1.48) for breast, 1.08 (1.05-1.10) for colorectal, 1.20 (1.11-1.31) for uterine corpus, 1.54 (1.40-1.70) for urinary bladder, 1.13 (1.01-1.26) for melanoma, and 1.10 (1.01-1.21) for thyroid.

Results:   PBOX-15 treatment was associated with significant cell kill and increased radiosensitivity in all three cell lines tested. The number of surviving cells in response to the combined treatment was significantly less than PBOX -15 alone in 22Rv1 cells. In these cells, radiosensitisation correlated with induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest by PBOX-15. The compound sustained its activity and increased HIF-1Α expression under hypoxic conditions. PBOX-15 prevented onset of hypoxia-induced radioresistance in hypoxic prostate cells and reduced the surviving fraction of irradiated hypoxic cells to levels similar to those achieved under aerobic conditions.  Methods:   Clonogenic assays were used to determine sensitivity of a panel of cancer cell lines (22Rv1, A549, U87) to PBOX-15 alone or in combination with a single 2Gy dose fraction. Induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was investigated in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells.

Management depends on the accurate estimation of disease both at initial diagnosis and in its subsequent course. In the present study, we evaluated the diagnostic utility of positron emission tomography with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in patients having prostate cancer. The findings were compared with the results of bone scan (BS) for the detection of bone metastases. Sixteen patients (age range, 55-83 years) with confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer were included in the prospective study. Three patients had undergone bilateral orchidectomy, 1 had hormonal therapy, 9 had undergone both, and 3 had no therapy. All the patients underwent wholebody BS and FDG-PET within 1 week. Interpretation of BS and FDG-PET were performed qualitatively. Osseous abnormalities detected by both methods were compared. Involvement of the disease in other sites as seen on FDG-PET was also noted. BS detected 197 osseous lesions, whereas FDG-PET could detect 97 (49%) bone lesions. However, in 3 patients without any prior therapeutic intervention, FDG-PET results were superior or equivalent to that of BS. FDG-PET also detected extensive involvement of the disease in the bone marrow in 4 patients, lymph node metastases at various sites in 8, liver metastases in 2, and lung metastases in 1 patient. FDG-PET could demonstrate less number of osseous metastases in comparison with BSs, but the results have to be interpreted in the background of prior treatment administered and the tumor biology of the lesion. It is evident that FDG-PET could detect the unknown soft tissue involvement of the disease with good sensitivity, which might play an important role in the management of prostate cancer. Overall, in the absence of novel PET tracers, both skeletal scintigraphy and FDG-PET imaging can play a complimentary role in the management of prostate cancer.""","""['B P Tiwari', 'S Jangra', 'N Nair', 'H B Tongaonkar', 'S Basu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Indian J Cancer""","""['PET scan for prostate cancer.', '18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and bone scintigraphy for detecting bone metastases in patients with malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract.', 'Comparison of (18) F-FDG-PET-CT and Bone Scintigraphy for Evaluation of Osseous Metastases in Newly Diagnosed and Recurrent Osteosarcoma.', 'Metabolic activity in bone metastases of breast and prostate cancer were similar as studied by 18F-FDG PET/CT.

The 2003 Medicare Modernization Act reduced reimbursements for AST by 64% between 2004 and 2005, but the effect of this large reduction on use of AST is unknown.  Methods:   A cohort of 72,818 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1992-2005 was identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. From Medicare claims data, indicated AST was defined as 3 months or more of AST in the first year in men with metastatic disease (n = 8030). Non-indicated AST was defined as AST given without other therapies such as radical prostatectomy or radiation in men with low-risk disease (n = 64,788). The unadjusted annual proportion of men receiving AST was plotted against the median Medicare AST reimbursement. A multivariable model was used to estimate the odds of AST use in men with low-risk and metastatic disease, with the predictor of interest being the calendar year of the payment change. Covariates in the model included age in 5-year categories, clinical tumor stage (T1-T4), World Health Organization grade (1-3, unknown), Charlson comorbidity (0, 1, 2, ≥ 3), race, education, income, and tumor registry site, all as categorical variables. The models included variations in the definition of AST use (≥ 1, ≥ 3, and ≥ 6 months of AST). All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   AST use in the low-risk group peaked at 10.2% in 2003, then declined to 7.1% in 2004 and 6.1% in 2005. After adjusting for tumor and demographic covariates, the odds of receiving non-indicated primary AST decreased statistically significantly in 2004 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.70, 95% confidence interval = 0.61 to 0.80) and 2005 (OR = 0.61, 95% confidence interval = 0.53 to 0.71) compared with 2003. AST use in the metastatic disease group was stable at 60% during the payment change, and the adjusted odds ratio of receiving AST in this group was unchanged in 2004-2005.

A biobank information management system stores the clinical/phenotypic data of the sample donor and sample related information. The clinical/phenotypic data is potentially sourced from the donor's electronic health record (EHR). The study evaluates the reuse of openEHR archetypes that have been developed for the creation of an interoperable EHR in the context of biobanking, and proposes a new set of archetypes specifically for biobanks. The ultimate goal of the research is the development of an interoperable electronic biomedical research record (eBMRR) to support biomedical knowledge discovery.  Methods:   The database of the prostate cancer biobank of the Irish Prostate Cancer Research Consortium (PCRC), which supports the identification of novel biomarkers for prostate cancer, was taken as the basis for the modelling effort. First the database schema of the biobank was analyzed and reorganized into archetype-friendly concepts. Then, archetype repositories were searched for matching archetypes. Some existing archetypes were reused without change, some were modified or specialized, and new archetypes were developed where needed. The fields of the biobank database schema were then mapped to the elements in the archetypes. Finally, the archetypes were arranged into templates specifically to meet the requirements of the PCRC biobank.  Results:   A set of 47 archetypes was found to cover all the concepts used in the biobank. Of these, 29 (62%) were reused without change, 6 were modified and/or extended, 1 was specialized, and 11 were newly defined. These archetypes were arranged into 8 templates specifically required for this biobank. A number of issues were encountered in this research. Some arose from the immaturity of the archetype approach, such as immature modelling support tools, difficulties in defining high-quality archetypes and the problem of overlapping archetypes. In addition, the identification of suitable existing archetypes was time-consuming and many semantic conflicts were encountered during the process of mapping the PCRC BIMS database to existing archetypes. These include differences in the granularity of documentation, in metadata-level versus data-level modelling, in terminologies and vocabularies used, and in the amount of structure imposed on the information to be recorded. Furthermore, the current way of modelling the sample entity was found to be cumbersome in the sample-centric activity of biobanking.  Conclusions:   The archetype approach is a promising approach to create a shareable eBMRR based on the study participant/donor for biobanks. Many archetypes originally developed for the EHR domain can be reused to model the clinical/phenotypic and sample information in the biobank context, which validates the genericity of these archetypes and their potential for reuse in the context of biomedical research. However, finding suitable archetypes in the repositories and establishing an exact mapping between the fields in the PCRC BIMS database and the elements of existing archetypes that have been designed for clinical practice can be challenging and time-consuming and involves resolving many common system integration conflicts. These may be attributable to differences in the requirements for information documentation between clinical practice and biobanking. This research also recognized the need for better support tools, modelling guidelines and best practice rules and reconfirmed the need for better domain knowledge governance. Furthermore, the authors propose that the establishment of an independent sample record with the sample as record subject should be investigated. The research presented in this paper is limited by the fact that the new archetypes developed during this research are based on a single biobank instance. These new archetypes may not be complete, representing only those subsets of items required by this particular database. Nevertheless, this exercise exposes some of the gaps that exist in the archetype modelling landscape and highlights the concepts that need to be modelled with archetypes to enable the development of an eBMRR.""","""['Melanie Bettina Späth', 'Jane Grimson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Med Inform""","""['Standardized and flexible health data management with an archetype driven EHR system (EHRflex).', 'Archetype-based data warehouse environment to enable the reuse of electronic health record data.', 'Facilitating secondary use of medical data by using openEHR archetypes.', 'Archetype-based electronic health records: a literature review and evaluation of their applicability to health data interoperability and access.', 'Barriers to cross--institutional health information exchange: a literature review.', 'Understanding the Nature of Metadata: Systematic Review.', 'Nutrition Information in Oncology - Extending the Electronic Patient-Record Data Set.', 'Composite CDE: modeling composite relationships between common data elements for representing complex clinical data.', 'Archetype Development Process: A Case Study of Support Interoperability among Electronic Health Record in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Modeling EHR with the openEHR approach: an exploratory study in China.']"""

All cancers were organ confined at and surgery.  Conclusions:   Men with isolated HGPIN have a continued risk of developing prostate cancer during long-term follow-up, regardless of the changes in the serum PSA level. Collectively, the relatively high likelihood of organ confinement and clinically significant cancer suggest empiric DIBx every 2-3 years could be a valuable tool in the follow-up of men with isolated HGPIN found by extended core biopsy.""","""['Guilherme Godoy', 'George J Huang', 'Trushar Patel', 'Samir S Taneja']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.

If XMRV is indeed able to replicate in humans, then one might predict that XMRV would have developed resistance to human innate antiviral resistance factors such as APOBEC3G (hA3G). In fact, we observed that XMRV and MLV are both highly sensitive to inhibition by hA3G and equally resistant to inhibition by murine APOBEC3. While several human prostate cancer cell lines were found to lack hA3G, stable expression of physiological levels of hA3G rendered these cells refractory to XMRV replication.

Material:   We retrospectively analyzed data collected from 10/2000 to 05/2009 for 730 consecutive patients who underwent RP for clinically localized or locally advanced prostate cancer (cT1-cT3) in our institution. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of greater than 0.1 ng/ml, with rising PSA at two consecutive dosages. Postoperative survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method after D'Amico's group stratification. The accuracy of the model was evaluated using the Harrell's concordance index. The impact on outcomes of preoperative PSA and pathological features was evaluated using a monovariate and multivariate Cox analysis.  Results:   Median follow-up was 30 months [interquartile range: 13-51]. The overall 3-year and 5-year probability of freedom from BCR was 85% (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 81-88%) and 78% (95% CI, 74-83%), respectively. For low, intermediate, and high-risk group, the 5-year freedom from BCR was 92% (95% CI, 88-97%), 73% (95% CI, 65-81%) and 44% (95% CI, 28-59%), respectively (p<0.001). Harrell's concordance index was 0.71. Surgical margins were positive in 31% of all cases. In a multivariate analysis, preoperative PSA, pathological tumor stage, Gleason score and surgical margins status predicted BCR after RP.  Conclusions:   We externally validated the ability of the D'Amico's risk group stratification to predict disease progression following RP in European patients.

Lifestyle changes might lessen the metabolic, cardiovascular, and osseous side effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Urologists supplied 10 consecutive patients initiating ADT with a tool-kit (information brochure, practical guidance on diet and exercise, recipe booklet, and lifestyle diary). The urologists completed a total 4 questionnaires, at study initiation, one at the patients' first and second visits, and one at study completion.  Results:   Overall, 91 urologists completed all questionnaires; 585 patients (median age, 75 years) were seen at the first visit, and 511 patients at the second. Patient response rate to the first questionnaire was 62% and 56% to the second. After the first visit, 82% of respondents reported being very glad or glad to receive the kit; among those having read the practical guidance (301/362), 57% had started implementation and 36% intended to do so. After the second visit, 76% were satisfied with the tool-kit and 84% were implementing guidance. Clinician satisfaction rate was 82%: benefits were improved patient dialogue (62%), follow-up (55%), and better explanation of side effects (51%). Only 14 clinicians were not pleased by the tool kit. Their main criticisms (too long, tedious, not tailored to individual needs) matched those of patients.  Conclusions:   Written detailed guidance on diet and physical exercise for patients about to receive ADT met a genuine need and was well perceived by both clinicians and patients.

Objective:   To evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRX302 in men with moderate to severe BPH.  Design, setting, and participants:   Eligible subjects were refractory, intolerant, or unwilling to undergo medical therapies for BPH and had International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) ≥12, a quality of life (QoL) score ≥3, and prostate volumes between 30 and 80 g. Fifteen patients were enrolled in phase 1 studies, and 18 patients entered phase 2 studies.  Interventions:   Subjects received intraprostatic injection of PRX302 into the right and left transition zone via a transperineal approach in an office-based setting. Phase 1 subjects received increasing concentrations of PRX302 at a fixed volume; phase 2 subjects received increasing volumes per deposit at a fixed concentration.  Measurements:   IPSS, QoL, prostate volume, maximum flow rate (Q(max)), International Index of Erectile Function, serum PSA levels, pharmacokinetics, and adverse events were recorded at 30, 60, 90, 180, 270, and 360 d after treatment with PRX302.  Results and limitations:   Sixty percent of men in the phase 1 study and 64% of men in the phase 2 study treated with PRX302 had ≥30% improvement compared to baseline in IPSS out to day 360. Patients also experienced improvement in QoL and reduction in prostate volume out to day 360. Patients receiving ≥1 ml of PRX302 per deposit had the best response overall. PRX302 had no deleterious effect on erectile function. Adverse events were mild to moderate and transient in nature. The major study limitation was the small sample size.

Studies on somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have become an important aspect of cancer research because these mutations might have functional consequences and/or might serve as biosensors for tumor detection and progression. We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome (16,569 bp) from 30 prospectively collected pairs of macrodissected cancerous and benign cells from prostate cancer patients and compared their genetic variability. Given recent concerns regarding the authenticity of newly discovered mtDNA mutations, we implemented a high-quality procedure for mtDNA whole-genome sequencing. In addition, the mitochondrial genes MT-CO2, MT-CO3, MT-ATP6, and MT-ND6 were sequenced in further 35 paired samples from prostate cancer patients. We identified a total of 41 somatic mutations in 22 out of 30 patients: the majority of these mutations have not previously been observed in the human phylogeny. The presence of somatic mutations in transfer RNAs (tRNAs) was found to be associated with elevated PSA levels (14.25 ± 5.44 versus 7.15 ± 4.32 ng/ml; p = 0.004). The level and degree of heteroplasmy increased with increasing tumor activity. In summary, somatic mutations in the mitochondrial genome are frequent events in prostate cancer.

Current treatments are mostly ineffective against advanced-stage prostate cancer and are often associated with severe side effects. Driven by these factors, we report a multifunctional, nanotechnology-driven, gold nano-popcorn-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) assay for targeted sensing, nanotherapy treatment, and in situ monitoring of photothermal nanotherapy response during the therapy process. Our experimental data show that, in the presence of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells, multifunctional popcorn-shaped gold nanoparticles form several hot spots and provide a significant enhancement of the Raman signal intensity by several orders of magnitude (2.5 × 10(9)). As a result, it can recognize human prostate cancer cells at the 50-cells level. Our results indicate that the localized heating that occurs during near-infrared irradiation can cause irreparable cellular damage to the prostate cancer cells. Our in situ time-dependent results demonstrate for the first time that, by monitoring SERS intensity changes, one can monitor photothermal nanotherapy response during the therapy process. Possible mechanisms and operating principles of our SERS assay are discussed. Ultimately, this nanotechnology-driven assay could have enormous potential applications in rapid, on-site targeted sensing, nanotherapy treatment, and monitoring of the nanotherapy process, which are critical to providing effective treatment of cancer.""","""['Wentong Lu', 'Anant Kumar Singh', 'Sadia Afrin Khan', 'Dulal Senapati', 'Hongtao Yu', 'Paresh Chandra Ray']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Am Chem Soc""","""['Popcorn-shaped magnetic core-plasmonic shell multifunctional nanoparticles for the targeted magnetic separation and enrichment, label-free SERS imaging, and photothermal destruction of multidrug-resistant bacteria.', 'Gold nano-popcorn attached SWCNT hybrid nanomaterial for targeted diagnosis and photothermal therapy of human breast cancer cells.', 'What potential does plasmonics-amplified synergistic immuno photothermal nanotherapy have for treatment of cancer?', 'SERS nanosensors and nanoreporters: golden opportunities in biomedical applications.', 'Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy for prostate cancer diagnosis: A review.', 'Recent Progress of Gold-Based Nanostructures towards Future Emblem of Photo-Triggered Cancer Theranostics: A Special Focus on Combinatorial Phototherapies.', '18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles (GNPs) for Plasmonic Photothermal Ablation of Cancer: A Review.', 'Effect of H2O2 @CuONPs in the UV Light-Induced Removal of Organic Pollutant Congo Red Dye: Investigation into Mechanism with Additional Biomedical Study.', 'Advanced nanomaterial for prostate cancer theranostics.', 'Green Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles Using Plant Extracts as Beneficial Prospect for Cancer Theranostics.']"""

Before metastasis can occur there is transition of the sessile epithelial cancer cells to become motile and invasive mesenchymal phenotypes by an important albeit transient process called Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The cascade of molecular events triggered by this process is clinically relevant as they are associated with cancer stem-like cells (CSC), decreased senescence and eventual drug resistance phenotype. We interrogated some EMT markers that have been implicated in primary and bone metastasis of PCa using archived patient samples. Using an immunohistochemical approach, E-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB1, Notch-1, PDGF-D and NF-κB were analyzed. Cases were microscopically scored using intensity (0, +1, +2, +3) and percentage of positive cells. Data was statistically analyzed using Fisher's Exact Test. Aberrant expression of EMT markers E-cadherin, Vimentin, PDGF-D, NF-κB, Notch-1 and ZEB1 was observed in PCa (primary tumor specimen) and bone metastasis tissues. The aberrant expression pattern varied according to the location within the tumor with higher expression was observed more at the invasive tumor front (ITF) vs. the center of the tumor. Notch-1 was significantly over-expressed in bone metastasis compared to primary PCa (p=0.057). The expression levels, intensity and % of positive cells of the remaining markers were not statistically significant in PCa vs. bone metastasis. In conclusion, protein expression analysis revealed the existence of EMT phenotype in the PCa and bone metastasis. Variation in the aberrant expression patterns at the invasive tumor front indicates the role of EMT markers in tumor invasion. Our results suggest that Notch-1 could play a role in PCa bone metastasis. Studies in larger patient cohorts are warranted before these EMT molecular markers can be translated to the clinical use.""","""['Seema Sethi', 'Jill Macoska', 'Wei Chen', 'Fazlul H Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Transl Res""","""['Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Clinical significance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in prostate cancer.', 'Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'The novel role of Yin Yang 1 in the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in cancer via the dysregulated NF-κB/Snail/YY1/RKIP/PTEN Circuitry.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Insights into Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters: A Barometer for Treatment Effects and Prognosis for Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Interaction between prostate cancer stem cells and bone microenvironment regulates prostate cancer bone metastasis and treatment resistance.', 'High Expression of PDLIM2 Predicts a Poor Prognosis in Prostate Cancer and Is Correlated with Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Immune Cell Infiltration.', 'Inhibition of Cell Proliferation and Metastasis by Scutellarein Regulating PI3K/Akt/NF-κB Signaling through PTEN Activation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor-α Subunit Targeting Suppresses Metastasis in Advanced Thyroid Cancer In Vitro and In Vivo.']"""

Dysregulated CD44 expression characterizes most human cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). PCa loses expression of CD44 standard (CD44s) that is present in benign epithelium, and overexpresses the novel splice variant (v) isoform, CD44v7-10. We studied CD44 in PCa for more than a decade, and in a series of papers, established its functional significance. Using retrovi-ral gene delivery to PC-3M PCa cells, we expressed luciferase-only, enforced CD44s re-expression as a fusion protein with luciferase at its C-terminus or as a protein separate from luciferase, or knocked down CD44v7-10 by RNAi. Invasion, migration, proliferation, soft agar colony formation, adhesion, Docetaxel sensitivity, and xenograft growth assays were carried out. Compared to luciferase-only PC-3M cells, all 3 treatments reduced invasion and migration. Growth and soft agar colony formation were reduced only by re-expression of CD44s as a separate or fusion protein but not CD44v7-10 RNAi. Hyaluronan and osteopontin binding were greatly strengthened by CD44s expression as a separate protein, but not a fusion protein. CD44v7-10 RNAi in PC-3M cells caused marked sensitization to Docetaxel; the 2 CD44s re-expression approaches caused minimal sensitization. In limited numbers of mouse subcutaneous xeno-grafts, all 3 alterations produced only nonsignificant trends toward slower growth compared with luciferase-only controls. In further work, we tested the effects of the anti-growth compound silibinin, a milk thistle derivative. Using a luciferase promoter construct to test for CD44 promoter activity, silibinin significantly and dose-dependently inhibited promoter activity at physiologic doses. Total CD44 RNA and CD44v7-10 RNA were significantly decreased; both were also decreased at the protein level. Phenyl-methylene hydantoins (PMH), guanidine alkaloids derived from Red Sea sponges, have the ability to increase cell-cell adhesion in prostate cancer cells and reduce invasion. Expression of CD44 total mRNA and CD44v7-10 were markedly decreased by PMH and its S-ethyl derivative. The oncogenic mi-croRNAs, miR-373 and miR-520c, which interact with CD44, were studied in prostate cancer cells and human tissues. We found that they bound the 3' untranslated region of the CD44 RNA, and suppressed CD44 in prostate cancer, by preventing the translation of CD44 RNA, rather than by degrading the RNA. Thus, stable re-expression of CD44s reduces PCa growth and invasion in vitro, and possibly in vivo, suggesting CD44's potential as gene therapy. Finally, CD44v7-10 may be a target for chemosensitization, and plays a role in nutraceutical abrogation of tumor development. In vivo effects of CD44 alteration still need to be investigated by use of orthotopic or renal capsule xenografts, which confer a different stromal microenvironment than that of the subcutaneous grafts.""","""['Kenneth A Iczkowski']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Transl Res""","""['Stable alterations of CD44 isoform expression in prostate cancer cells decrease invasion and growth and alter ligand binding and chemosensitivity.', 'Phenyl-methylene hydantoins alter CD44-specific ligand binding of benign and malignant prostate cells and suppress CD44 isoform expression.', 'Silibinin suppresses CD44 expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Involvement of CD44 and its variant isoforms in membrane-cytoskeleton interaction, cell adhesion and tumor metastasis.', 'CD44: structure, function, and association with the malignant process.', 'Evaluation of CD44 Expression in Prostatic Adenocarcinoma: An Institutional Study.', 'The v8-10 variant isoform of CD44 is selectively expressed in the normal human colonic stem cell niche and frequently is overexpressed in colon carcinomas during tumor development.', 'Zinc finger protein‑like 1 is a novel neuroendocrine biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Stem Cells: From an Insight into the Basics to Recent Advances and Therapeutic Targeting.', ""Proteome profiling of cerebrospinal fluid reveals biomarker candidates for Parkinson's disease.""]"""

However, most of the disease-related mutational data are currently buried in the biomedical literature in textual form and lack the necessary structure to allow easy retrieval and visualization. We introduce a high-throughput computational method for the identification of relevant disease mutations in PubMed abstracts applied to prostate (PCa) and breast cancer (BCa) mutations.  Results:   We developed the extractor of mutations (EMU) tool to identify mutations and their associated genes. We benchmarked EMU against MutationFinder--a tool to extract point mutations from text. Our results show that both methods achieve comparable performance on two manually curated datasets. We also benchmarked EMU's performance for extracting the complete mutational information and phenotype. Remarkably, we show that one of the steps in our approach, a filter based on sequence analysis, increases the precision for that task from 0.34 to 0.59 (PCa) and from 0.39 to 0.61 (BCa). We also show that this high-throughput approach can be extended to other diseases.  Discussion:   Our method improves the current status of disease-mutation databases by significantly increasing the number of annotated mutations. We found 51 and 128 mutations manually verified to be related to PCa and Bca, respectively, that are not currently annotated for these cancer types in the OMIM or Swiss-Prot databases. EMU's retrieval performance represents a 2-fold improvement in the number of annotated mutations for PCa and BCa. We further show that our method can benefit from full-text analysis once there is an increase in Open Access availability of full-text articles.

Previous studies have suggested that Cyr61 may be a marker for a more aggressive phenotype. In this study, we evaluated the association between Cyr61 staining intensity and subsequent recurrence after surgical treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   A study of 229 men with recurrence and 229 controls matched on age, race, pathologic stage, and Gleason sum nested in a cohort of men who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer, utilizing immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarray (TMA) sections, was conducted. Odds ratios (OR) of recurrence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.  Results:   Recurrence was identified in 12.2% of cases, and in 24.0% of controls that had at least 1 TMA spot containing cancer with a staining intensity of 3 (P = 0.001). Taking into account age, pathologic stage and grade, presurgery prostate-specific antigen concentration, and calendar of surgery as a measure of tissue block storage time, men with a Cyr61 staining intensity of 3 were 56% less likely to recur than men with a lower staining intensity (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.22-0.90).  Conclusions:   High Cyr61 staining intensity in adenocarcinoma was associated with a lower risk of recurrence after surgical treatment of prostate cancer independent of pathologic tumor characteristics.

HMGA1 is significantly overexpressed in and associated with high grade and advance stage of prostate cancer (PC). The oncogenic role of HMGA1 is at least mediated through chromosomal instability and structural aberrations. However, regulation of HMGA1 expression is not well understood. Identification of microRNA-mediated HMGA1 regulation will provide a promising therapeutic target in treating PC.  Experimental design:   In this study, we examined the functional relation between miR-296 and HMGA1 expression in several PC cell lines and a large PC cohort. We further examined the oncogenic property of HMGA1 regulated by miR-296.  Results:   Here we report that miR-296, a microRNA predicted to target HMGA1, specifically represses HMGA1 expression by promoting degradation and inhibiting HMGA1translation. Repression of HMGA1 by miR-296 is direct and sequence specific. Importantly, ectopic miR-296 expression significantly reduced PC cell proliferation and invasion, in part through the downregulation of HMGA1. Examining PC patient samples, we found an inverse correlation between HMGA1 and miR-296 expression: high levels of HMGA1 were associated with low miR-296 expression and strongly linked to more advanced tumor grade and stage.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that miR-296 regulates HMGA1 expression and is associated with PC growth and invasion.""","""['Jian-Jun Wei', 'Xinyu Wu', 'Yi Peng', 'Guizhi Shi', 'Olca Basturk', 'Ximing Yang', 'Garrett Daniels', 'Iman Osman', 'Jiangyong Ouyang', 'Eva Hernando', 'Angel Pellicer', 'Johng S Rhim', 'Jonathan Melamed', 'Peng Lee']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""[""Editor's Note: Regulation of HMGA1 Expression by MicroRNA-296 Affects Prostate Cancer Growth and Invasion."", 'MicroRNA-214 suppresses growth, migration and invasion through a novel target, high mobility group AT-hook 1, in human cervical and colorectal cancer cells.', 'Pancreatic cancer cells-derived exosomal long non-coding RNA CCAT1/microRNA-138-5p/HMGA1 axis promotes tumor angiogenesis.', 'MicroRNA-137, an HMGA1 target, suppresses colorectal cancer cell invasion and metastasis in mice by directly targeting FMNL2.', 'H19 promotes the migration and invasion of colon cancer by sponging miR-138 to upregulate the expression of HMGA1.', 'High mobility group A: a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'miR-638 suppresses proliferation by negatively regulating high mobility group A1 in ovarian cancer cells.', 'Next-Generation Biomarkers in Multiple Myeloma: Understanding the Molecular Basis for Potential Use in Diagnosis and Prognosis.', 'HMGA1 promotes gastric cancer growth and metastasis by transactivating SUZ12 and CCDC43 expression.', 'Differential expression of miRNAs as biomarkers for predicting the outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients.', 'miRNAs as biomarkers for early cancer detection and their application in the development of new diagnostic tools.']"""

We investigated whether serum levels of different forms of soluble uPA receptor (suPAR) are associated with survival and in particular with prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality.  Methods:   Using time-resolved fluorescence immunoassays, we measured intact suPAR [suPAR(I-III)] and intact plus cleaved suPAR [suPAR(I-III) + suPAR(II-III)] and thus calculated the amount of suPAR(II-III) in serum samples from 375 men participating in a prostate cancer screening trial. A total of 312 men were free of prostate cancer and 63 men had prostate cancer diagnosed at the time of screening. The cohort was followed for 15 years. We assessed survival using Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   The mean age at blood sampling was 64 years. In total, 152 men died during follow-up. SuPAR(I-III) and suPAR(II-III) were significantly positively associated with mortality (P = 0.001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). In a Cox regression model adjusting for age and prostate cancer status, an increase in suPAR(I-III) and suPAR(II-III) by 1-unit (ln-scale) was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.26 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-4.35] and 2.53 (95% CI 1.56-4.10), respectively. There was a trend towards an increased risk of death from prostate cancer in screening-detected prostate cancer patients with increased values of either suPAR form. However, this difference was not significant and the association disappeared after adjusting for age, tumour stage, tumour grade and prostate-specific antigen. Being in the highest quartile of any of the suPAR forms was associated with a highly significant increased risk of cardiovascular death, with HR adjusted for age of 3.27 (95% CI 1.38-7.73) for suPAR(I-III) quartile 4 versus quartile 1. Conclusions. High concentrations of serum suPAR(I-III) and suPAR(II-III) were associated with poor overall survival. The association was particularly strong for death from cardiovascular disease. No similar association was found for prostate cancer after adjustment for other prognostic factors.""","""['A Kjellman', 'O Akre', 'O Gustafsson', 'G Høyer-Hansen', 'H Lilja', 'U Norming', 'T Piironen', 'M Törnblom']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Intern Med""","""['Increased urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor in serum of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Circulating soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor predicts cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and mortality in the general population.', 'Prognostic value of intact and cleaved forms of the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor in a retrospective study of 518 colorectal cancer patients.', 'The urokinase plasminogen activator system: a rich source of tumour markers for the individualised management of patients with cancer.', 'Urokinase-type plasminogen activator system and breast cancer (Review).', 'Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (suPAR) as a Biomarker of Systemic Chronic Inflammation.', 'Multifaceted Role of the Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator (uPA) and Its Receptor (uPAR): Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Therapeutic Applications.', 'Soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor contribute to chemoresistance in leukemia.', 'Pathway-Specific Aggregate Biomarker Risk Score Is Associated With Burden of Coronary Artery Disease and Predicts Near-Term Risk of Myocardial Infarction and Death.', 'PET imaging of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) in prostate cancer: current status and future perspectives.']"""

Controls were 137 neighborhood and age match men without prostate cancer by PSA and digit examination. Analysis comprised an exploratory stage to identify potential risk factors, defined as variables associated with case status at the P < 0.20 level in conditional logistic regression. A second stage included all potential risk factors in multiple conditional logistic regression analysis, retaining those associated with prostate cancer at the P < 0.05 level. Potential risk factors for prostate cancer in exploratory analysis included family history of prostate cancer, history of other cancer, prostatitis, alcohol consumption, pipe or hookah smoking, walking to work, duration of occupational physical activity, intensity of occupational physical activity, body mass index, and older age. Multivariate analysis found intensity of occupational physical activity, prostatitis, and older age as independent predictors of increased risk for prostate cancer in this Iranian population. Our study confirms several recognized risk factors for prostate cancer, contributes evidence to the discussions of other hypothesized risk factors, and points to potentially new factors.

Although work in preclinical models suggests that β1 integrins may stimulate metastasis of a number of cancers, expression of the β1 subunit alone has not been shown to be a useful prognostic indicator in human cancer patients. Here we have demonstrated that the α2β1 integrin suppresses metastasis in a clinically relevant spontaneous mouse model of breast cancer. These data are consistent with previous studies indicating high expression of α2β1 integrin in normal breast epithelium and loss of α2β1 in poorly differentiated breast cancer. They are also consistent with our systematic analysis of microarray databases of human breast and prostate cancer, which revealed that decreased expression of the gene encoding α2 integrin, but not genes encoding α1, α3, or β1 integrin, was predictive of metastatic dissemination and decreased survival. The predictive value of α2 expression persisted within both good-risk and poor-risk cohorts defined by estrogen receptor and lymph node status. Thus, the α2β1 integrin functionally inhibits breast tumor metastasis, and α2 expression may serve as an important biomarker of metastatic potential and patient survival.""","""['Norma E Ramirez', 'Zhonghua Zhang', 'Aasakiran Madamanchi', 'Kelli L Boyd', ""Lynda D O'Rear"", 'Abudi Nashabi', 'Zhengzi Li', 'William D Dupont', 'Andries Zijlstra', 'Mary M Zutter']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Biphasic α2β1 Integrin Expression in Breast Cancer Metastasis to Bone.', 'Autocrine semaphorin3A stimulates alpha2 beta1 integrin expression/function in breast tumor cells.', 'Loss of the α2β1 integrin alters human papilloma virus-induced squamous carcinoma progression in vivo and in vitro.', 'Altered integrin expression and the malignant phenotype: the contribution of multiple integrated integrin receptors.', 'β1-integrins signaling and mammary tumor progression in transgenic mouse models: implications for human breast cancer.', 'Low Expression of TSTD2 Serves as a Biomarker for Poor Prognosis in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma.', 'Molecular Modeling Insights into the Structure and Behavior of Integrins: A Review.', 'Non-coding RNA regulation of integrins and their potential as therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'Matrix from urine stem cells boosts tissue-specific stem cell mediated functional cartilage reconstruction.', 'Gene Expression Patterns of Osteopontin Isoforms and Integrins in Malignant Melanoma.']"""

Contrast mixed mode examination vs. only contrast enhanced ultrasound examination""","""Purpose:   To evaluate the different ultrasound techniques for quantification of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in an experimental rat prostate carcinoma model.  Method and materials:   Prostate carcinoma (MLLB-2) cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of male rat (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany, 180 to 220 g body weight). Following 18 days of subcutaneous tumor growth 9 rats underwent CEUS examination. Real time CEUS was performed after a bolus injection of SonoVue (0.2 ml, Bracco, Italy) via the lateral tail vein using a high end ultrasound system (Siemens Sequoia 512®/Acuson, Mountain View) with an 15 Mhz probe. Two different CEUS techniques, pure contrast (pc) and contrast with background (cbg) examination, were analyzed (CPS-software). Exported signal intensity (SI)-time curves and the normalized area under the curve (AUC) for the active tumor tissue, whole tumor and necrosis were compared.  Results:   The mean normalized AUC for the active tumor tissue and the whole tumor was 0.84 and 0.5 in the pure contrast examination group and 0.49 and 0.3 for the contrast examination with background signal. Therefore the signal intensity of the pc group was in every examination significant higher than of the cbg group (p < 0.02). The advantage of using the additional background information is to detect the anatomic landmarks in the solid tumor model in comparison to the pure contrast enhanced ultrasound examination.  Conclusion:   The complete extension of the tumor is much easier to detect with the cbg technique due to orientation of the anatomic landmarks. As the signal intensity of the pc group is always significant higher we recommend this technique for quantification of contrast enhanced ultrasound, especially for the follow up of tumor microcirculation.""","""['P M Paprottka', 'C C Cyran', 'P Zengel', 'J von Einem', 'B Wintersperger', 'K Nikolaou', 'M F Reiser', 'D A Clevert']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Clin Hemorheol Microcirc""","""['Comparison of consecutive bolus tracking and flash replenishment measurements for the assessment of tissue hemodynamics using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in an experimental human squamous cell carcinoma model.', 'First results of endocavity evaluation of the microvascularization of malignant prostate tumors using contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) including perfusion analysis: first results.', 'Osteocutaneous free flaps: a critical analysis of quantitative evaluation of bone microcirculation with contrast-enhanced high resolution ultrasound (hrCEUS) and TIC analysis.', 'Quantitative evaluation of microvascular blood flow by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of the pediatric brain.', 'Spatial Characterization of Tumor Perfusion Properties from 3D DCE-US Perfusion Maps are Early Predictors of Cancer Treatment Response.', 'Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction improved the antiangiogenic effect of Endostar in triple-negative breast carcinoma xenografts.', 'Quantitative Three-Dimensional Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging: First-In-Human Pilot Study in Patients with Liver Metastases.', 'Reducing tumor growth and angiogenesis using a triple therapy measured with Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).', 'Visualization, imaging and new preclinical diagnostics in radiation oncology.']"""

Objective:   To determine the proportion of older men who are sexually active and to explore factors predictive of sexual activity.  Design:   Population-based cohort study.  Setting:   Community-dwelling men from Perth, Western Australia, Australia.  Participants:   3274 men aged 75 to 95 years.  Measurements:   Questionnaires from 1996 to 1999, 2001 to 2004, and 2008 to 2009 assessed social and medical factors. Sex hormones were measured from 2001 to 2004. Sexual activity was assessed by questionnaire from 2008 to 2009.  Results:   A total of 2783 men (85.0%) provided data on sexual activity. Sex was considered at least somewhat important by 48.8% (95% CI, 47.0% to 50.6%), and 30.8% (CI, 29.1% to 32.5%) had had at least 1 sexual encounter in the past 12 months. Of the latter, 56.5% were satisfied with the frequency of activity, whereas 43.0% had sex less often than preferred. In cross-sectional analyses, increasing age, partner's lack of interest, partner's physical limitations, osteoporosis, prostate cancer, diabetes, antidepressant use, and β-blocker use were independently associated with reduced odds of sexual activity. Living with a partner and having a non-English-speaking background were associated with increased odds. In longitudinal analyses, higher testosterone levels were associated with increased odds of being sexually active. Other factors were similar to the cross-sectional model.  Limitations:   Response bias may have influenced findings because sexuality can be a sensitive topic. Attrition may have resulted in a healthier-than-average sample of older men.  Conclusion:   One half of elderly men consider sex important, and one third report being sexually active. Men's health problems were associated with lack of sexual activity. Key modifiable risk factors include diabetes, depression, and medication use. Endogenous testosterone levels predict sexual activity, but the role of testosterone therapy remains uncertain.

As a result, age often plays a role in treatment choice. However, the relationships among age, disease risk, and prostate cancer-specific survival have not been well established.  Patients and methods:   We studied men in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database with complete risk, treatment, and follow-up information. High-risk patients were identified by using the validated Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score. Competing risks regression was used to identify the independent impact of age on cancer-specific survival. We also analyzed the effect of local treatment on survival among older men with high-risk disease.  Results:   In all, 26% of men age ≥ 75 years presented with high-risk disease (CAPRA score 6 to 10). Treatment varied markedly with age across risk strata; older men were more likely to receive androgen deprivation monotherapy. Controlling for treatment modality alone, or for treatment and risk, age did not independently predict cancer-specific survival. Furthermore, controlling for age, comorbidity, and risk, older men with high-risk tumors receiving local therapy had a 46% reduction in mortality compared with those treated conservatively.  Conclusion:   Older patients are more likely to have high-risk prostate cancer at diagnosis and less likely to receive local therapy. Indeed, underuse of potentially curative local therapy among older men with high-risk disease may in part explain observed differences in cancer-specific survival across age strata.

Experimental design:   We performed an association study between six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the CCL2 gene and prostate cancer clinicopathologic variables in a large hospital-based Caucasian patient cohort (N = 4,073).

We analyzed overexpression of c-Src in naïve mouse prostate epithelium and observed no change in tubule formation frequency or histologic structure. However, when enhanced c-Src expression is coupled with enhanced expression of androgen receptor (AR), it results in a strong activation of Src kinase activity accompanied by activation of the MAPK pathway, and enhanced AR activity. Similar to the pathology induced by constitutively active c-Src(Y529F), the tubules progress to frank carcinoma with invasion and display markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

In the prostate, AKR1C3 is up-regulated in localized and advanced prostate adenocarcinoma, and is associated with prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness. Here we propose a novel pathological function of AKR1C3 in tumor angiogenesis and its potential role in promoting PCa progression.  Methods:   To recapitulate elevated AKR1C3 expression in cancerous prostate, the human PCa PC-3 cell line was stably transfected with an AKR1C3 expression construct to establish PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants. Microarray and bioinformatics analysis were performed to identify AKR1C3-mediated pathways of activation and their potential biological consequences in PC-3 cells. Western blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and an in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assays were applied to validate the pro-angiogenic activity of PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants identified by bioinformatics analysis.  Results:   Microarray and bioinformatics analysis suggested that overexpression of AKR1C3 in PC-3 cells modulates estrogen and androgen metabolism, activates insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and Akt signaling pathways, as well as promotes tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness. Levels of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and Akt activation as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and secretion were significantly elevated in PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants in comparison to PC3-mock transfectants. PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants also promoted endothelial cell (EC) tube formation on Matrigel as compared to the AKR1C3-negative parental PC-3 cells and PC3-mock transfectants. Pre-treatment of PC3-AKR1C3 transfectants with a selective IGF-1R kinase inhibitor (AG1024) or a non-selective phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002) abolished ability of the cells to promote EC tube formation.  Conclusions:   Bioinformatics analysis followed by functional genomics demonstrated that AKR1C3 overexpression promotes angiogenesis and aggressiveness of PC-3 cells. These results also suggest that AKR1C3-mediated tumor angiogenesis is regulated by estrogen and androgen metabolism with subsequent IGF-1R and Akt activation followed by VEGF expression in PCa cells.""","""['Mikhail G Dozmorov', 'Joseph T Azzarello', 'Jonathan D Wren', 'Kar-Ming Fung', 'Qing Yang', 'Jeffrey S Davis', 'Robert E Hurst', 'Daniel J Culkin', 'Trevor M Penning', 'Hsueh-Kung Lin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 mediated prostaglandin D2 metabolism augments the PI3K/Akt proliferative signaling pathway in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Increased expression of type 2 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/type 5 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C3) and its relationship with androgen receptor in prostate carcinoma.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibitors of type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C3): overview and structural insights.', 'AKR1C3-dependent lipid droplet formation confers hepatocellular carcinoma cell adaptability to targeted therapy.', 'Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 inhibitor enasidenib synergizes daunorubicin cytotoxicity by targeting aldo-keto reductase 1C3 and ATP-binding cassette transporters.', 'Downregulation of Dihydrotestosterone and Estradiol Levels by HEXIM1.', ""Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib Counteract Anthracycline Resistance in Cancer Cells Expressing AKR1C3."", 'Selective inhibition of aldo-keto reductase 1C3: a novel mechanism involved in midostaurin and daunorubicin synergism.']"""

The objective of this study was to determine relationships between polymorphisms in the GSTM1, T1 and P1 genes with risk of symptomatic BPH and response to standard therapy. The study population comprised 160 symptomatic BPH patients with BPE (benign prostatic enlargement) and LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms) and 200 age-matched controls.

In rare cases there can be a complete displacement of the urethral anastomosis region. Treating this obstruction poses a technical challenge. Therapy includes open reconstruction of the bladder neck, continent stoma but also often only a suprapubic urinary diversion. A problem occurs when precisely this diversion has to be removed.  Case report:   We report on a 68-year-old patient who, due to recurrent post operative and post radiogenic anastomotic strictures, has been fitted with a suprapubic urinary drainage device. Following an infection that spread locally, the patient developed symphysitis that had to be treated surgically. As a result, it became necessary to switch the urine drainage system. As a result of a perineal puncture of the urethra and scarring obliteration into the bladder it was possible to establish a transurethral catheter. The needle was guided by means of endoscopic view and transrectal ultrasound.  Conclusion:   This case demonstrates a method to re-establish a transurethral urinary diversion in cases of complete anastomotic strictures.""","""['R Gleichmann', 'P Gasirabo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Vesicourethral anastomotic stricture following radical prostatectomy with or without postoperative radiotherapy.', 'Perineal salvage prostatectomy for radiation resistant prostate cancer.', 'Management of Urethral Stricture and Bladder Neck Contracture Following Primary and Salvage Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Obliterative vesicourethral strictures following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: reconstructive armamentarium.', 'Salvage radiotherapy in rising PSA after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Epidemiologic studies suggested that there were differences in cancer recurrence in breast and prostate cancer contingent on anesthetic regimens. In this study, we identify a possible mechanism for these epidemiologic findings on the basis of μ opioid receptor (MOR) regulation of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumorigenicity in cell and animal models.  Methods:   We used human lung tissue and human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and evaluated MOR expression using immunoblot and immunohistochemical analysis. LLC cells were treated with the peripheral opioid antagonist methylnaltrexone (MNTX) or MOR shRNA and evaluated for proliferation, invasion, and soft agar colony formation in vitro and primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in C57BL/6 and MOR knockout mice using VisEn fluorescence mediated tomography imaging and immunohistochemical analysis.  Results:   We provide several lines of evidence that the MOR may be a potential target for lung cancer, a disease with high mortality and few treatment options. We first observed that there is ∼5- to 10-fold increase in MOR expression in lung samples from patients with NSCLC and in several human NSCLC cell lines. The MOR agonists morphine and [D-Ala(2), N-MePhe(4), Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) increased in vitro LLC cell growth. Treatment with MNTX or silencing MOR expression inhibited LLC invasion and anchorage-independent growth by 50%-80%. Injection of MOR silenced LLC lead to a ∼65% reduction in mouse lung metastasis. In addition, MOR knockout mice do not develop significant tumors when injected with LLC in comparison with wild-type controls. Finally, continuous infusion of the peripheral opioid antagonist MNTX attenuates primary LLC tumor growth and reduces lung metastasis.  Conclusions:   Taken together, our data suggest a possible direct effect of opiates on lung cancer progression, and provide a plausible explanation for the epidemiologic findings. Our observations further suggest a possible therapeutic role for opioid antagonists.""","""['Biji Mathew', 'Frances E Lennon', 'Jessica Siegler', 'Tamara Mirzapoiazova', 'Nurbek Mambetsariev', 'Saad Sammani', 'Lynnette M Gerhold', 'Patrick J LaRiviere', 'Chin-Tu Chen', 'Joe G N Garcia', 'Ravi Salgia', 'Jonathan Moss', 'Patrick A Singleton']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Anesth Analg""","""['Overexpression of the μ-opioid receptor in human non-small cell lung cancer promotes Akt and mTOR activation, tumor growth, and metastasis.', 'Low doses of methylnaltrexone inhibits head and neck squamous cell carcinoma growth in vitro and in vivo by acting on the mu-opioid receptor.', 'The Mu opioid receptor promotes opioid and growth factor-induced proliferation, migration and Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in human lung cancer.', 'Targeting the mu-Opioid Receptor for Cancer Treatment.', 'Opioid Receptor-Mediated and Non-Opioid Receptor-Mediated Roles of Opioids in Tumour Growth and Metastasis.', 'Involvement of the Opioid Peptide Family in Cancer Progression.', 'Voltage-gated sodium channels: from roles and mechanisms in the metastatic cell behavior to clinical potential as therapeutic targets.', 'Esketamine opioid-free intravenous anesthesia versus opioid intravenous anesthesia in spontaneous ventilation video-assisted thoracic surgery: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Mapping the Evidence for Opioid-Mediated Changes in Malignancy and Chemotherapeutic Efficacy: Protocol for a Scoping Review.', 'Mu opioid receptor mRNA overexpression predicts poor prognosis among 18 common solid cancers: A pan-cancer analysis.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   We prospectively studied 106 consecutive low-risk PCa patients (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≤10 ng/ml, clinical stage T1c-T2a, and biopsy Gleason score 6) who underwent a PCA3 urine test before radical prostatectomy (RP).  Measurements:   Performance of AS criteria (biopsy criteria, PCA3 score, PSA density, and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] findings) was tested in predicting four prognostic pathologic findings in RP specimens: (1) pT3-4 disease; (2) overall unfavourable disease (OUD) defined by pT3-4 disease and/or pathologic primary Gleason pattern 4; (3) tumour volume <0.5 cm(3); and (4) insignificant PCa.  Results and limitations:   The PCA3 score was strongly correlated with the tumour volume in a linear regression analysis (p<0.001, r=0.409). The risk of having a cancer ≥0.5 cm(3) and a significant PCa was increased three-fold in men with a PCA3 score of ≥25 compared with men with a PCA3 score of <25 with most AS biopsy criteria used. There was a trend towards higher PCA3 scores in patients with unfavourable and non-organ-confined disease and Gleason >6 cancers. In a multivariate analysis taking into account each AS criterion, a high PCA3 score (≥25) was an important predictive factor for tumour volume ≥0.5 cm(3) (odds ratio [OR]: 5.4; p=0.010) and significant PCa (OR: 12.7; p=0.003). Biopsy criteria and MRI findings were significantly associated with OUD (OR: 3.9 and 5.0, respectively; p=0.030 and p=0.025, respectively).

Design, setting, and participants:   In a noncomparative phase 2 study, 96 patients with primary/secondary/concurrent CIS of the urinary bladder were randomized to sequential MMC plus BCG or to BCG alone after TUR.  Intervention:   Patients received six weekly instillations of MMC followed by six weekly instillations of BCG or six weekly instillations of BCG, 3 wk rest, and three further weekly instillations of BCG. Complete responders received three weekly maintenance instillations at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 mo in accordance with the initial randomization.  Measurements:   End points were complete response (CR) rate at the first control cystoscopy 16-18 wk after start of treatment, disease-free interval, overall survival, and side effects.  Results and limitations:   Ninety-six patients were randomized, 48 to each treatment group. Ten patients were ineligible, and three did not start treatment. In all randomized patients, CR rates on MMC plus BCG and BCG alone were 70.8% and 66.7%, respectively. In 83 eligible patients who started treatment, CR rates were 75.6% and 73.8%, respectively.

However, this relationship is not well explored in men with prostate cancer. Limited data suggest men with prostate cancer may experience less ED bother than men with ED who do not have prostate cancer, implying that ED and depressive symptoms may not be associated in men with prostate cancer.  Aim:   To determine if ED is associated with depressive symptoms in men with prostate cancer.  Main outcome measures:   Assessments of quality-of-life (The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy [FACT-P]), anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), and erectile function. Erectile function was measured with one question from the FACT-P similar to that used by the Massachusetts Male Aging Study.  Methods:   Men with prostate cancer, and naïve of hormone treatment, completed the study questionnaires at a single time point.  Results:   The average age of the 339 men was 67±10 years. The average time since diagnosis was 3.9±3 years. When answering the question, ""I am able to have and maintain an erection"" on a 1 to 5 scale (5 representing the best function), the mean score was 2 indicating ""a little bit."" On univariate analysis, erectile function and depression were associated, r=-0.12, P<0.05. Other variables associated with depression were marital status, r=0.11, P<0.05; anxiety scores, r=0.56, P<0.01; and social support, r=-0.42, P<0.01. On multivariate analysis, erectile function remained a significant predictor of depression, beta=-0.10, P<0.05.  Conclusions:   Erectile function was associated with depressive symptoms in both univariate and multivariate analysis, indicating that ED is independently associated with depressive symptoms even though patients were approximately 4 years post diagnosis.

To ensure better treatment decisions, we developed a nomogram to predict the probability of IPC.  Materials and methods:   The study population consisted of 1,471 patients who were treated at multiple institutions by radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant therapy from 1995 to 2008. We obtained nonrandom samples of n = 1,031 for nomogram development, leaving n = 440 for nomogram validation. IPC was defined as pathologic organ-confined disease and a tumor volume of 0.5 cc or less without Gleason grade 4 or 5. Multivariate logistic regression model (MLRM) coefficients were used to construct a nomogram to predict IPC from five variables, including serum prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score, positive cores ratio and maximum % of tumor in any core. The performance characteristics were internally validated from 200 bootstrap resamples to reduce overfit bias. External validation was also performed in another cohort.  Results:   Overall, 67 (6.5%) patients had a so-called ""insignificant"" tumor in nomogram development cohort. PSA, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score, positive core ratio and maximum % of biopsy tumor represented significant predictors of the presence of IPC. The resulting nomogram had excellent discrimination accuracy, with a bootstrapped concordance index of 0.827.

Much research work highlights the importance of gene selection and gains good results. However, the minimum sets of genes derived from different methods are seldom overlapping and often inconsistent even for the same set of data, partially because of the complexity of cancer disease. In this paper, cancer classification was attempted in an alternative way of the whole gene expression profile for all samples instead of partial gene sets. Here, the three common sets of data were tested by NIPALS-KPLS method for acute leukemia, prostate cancer and lung cancer respectively.

Data from the Swedish Cancer Register on prostate cancer incidence between 1980 and 2007 and published data from the Gothenburg branch of the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer (ERSPC), a population-based PSA screening study, were used in two models of changes in incidence of prostate cancer as a proxy for uptake of PSA testing in all 24 Swedish counties. The estimated annual PSA testing, irrespective of previous years' exposure, reached a peak of 12% of all men in 2004 and decreased thereafter to 6% in 2007 and varied from less than 5 to 20% between counties. Under the assumption that men who underwent annual PSA testing were previously unexposed to PSA testing, the cumulated uptake of PSA testing in men aged 55-69 years in Sweden increased from zero in 1997 to 56% in 2007. Our study shows that it is possible to estimate uptake of PSA testing in the population from the prostate cancer incidence pattern.

Some have recommended that a PSAV>0.35 ng/ml/year should prompt a prostate biopsy in men with a low serum PSA (<4 ng/ml) and benign DRE. However, less is known about the utility of this PSAV cutpoint for the prediction of treatment outcomes among men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   Between 1992 and 2007, 339 men underwent RP at our institution with a preoperative PSA<4 ng/ml, benign DRE, and multiple preoperative PSA measurements. PSAV was calculated by linear regression analysis using all PSA values within 18 months prior to diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed, and biochemical progression rates were compared between PSAV strata using the log-rank test.  Results:   The preoperative PSAV was >0.35 ng/ml/year in 124 (36.6%) of 339 men. Although there were no significant differences in clinico-pathological characteristics based upon PSAV, men with a PSAV>0.35 ng/ml/year were significantly more likely to experience biochemical progression after RP at a median follow-up of 4 years (P=0.022).  Conclusions:   In this low-risk population with a preoperative PSA<4 ng/ml and benign DRE, approximately 1/3 had a preoperative PSAV>0.35 ng/ml/year.

Methods:   Hundred men with clinically localized prostate cancer scheduled to undergo robotic prostatectomy were enrolled in the study following a standard consent process. The study protocol consisted of providing four urine samples. Voided urine obtained following digital rectal examination (DRE) pre-operatively (Vl), catheterized urine without DRE (V2), and l0-day and 6-week postoperative voided (V3 and V4) urine samples were collected and analyzed. These four urine specimens underwent target capture, transcription-mediated amplification, and hybridization in order to quantify both PCA3 and PSA mRNA. The PCA3 score was calculated as the ratio of PCA3 to PSA.  Results:   Informative rates (sufficient mRNA for analysis) for VI, V2, V3 and V4 were 91, 85, 0 and 2%, respectively. There was no significant associations with pathological stage, Gleason score >6. Higher PCA3 scores at V1 correlated with increased risk for perineural invasion (P = 0.0479).  Conclusions:   Informative PCA3 scores can be obtained from post-DRE voided urine as well as catheterized urine without a DRE.

FLT is a thymidine analogue which can be labelled with 18F. PET with 18F-FLT enables to non-invasively image and to quantify the proliferation fraction of tumours. Proliferation dependent accumulation of FLT has been demonstrated for a variety of solid and haematologic neoplasms including lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and malignant lymphoma. Furthermore, FLT has been suggested as surrogate marker for the assessment of response to treatment, especially when targeted drugs are utilized. PET imaging in particular has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool to accurately characterize tumour oxygenation. The great promise of PET/CT is its potential as a single imaging modality for whole body staging that provides anatomical and biological information on the disease as a whole. It allows a more precise estimation of the hypoxic tumour volume as well as comparisons on a voxel-by-voxel basis (parametric mapping). PET and PET/CT with hypoxia tracers thus offer the potential to optimize and individualize therapy for patients suffering from cancer. PET- and PET/CT-studies using 11C- or 18F-labeled choline derivates recently have shown promising results for re-staging prostate cancer in patients with biochemical recurrence and advanced prostate cancer. In patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after primary therapy the detection rate of 11C-choline-PET/CT shows a positive relationship with serum PSA-levels. In these patients 11C-choline PET/CT allows not only to diagnose but also to localize recurrent disease with implications on disease management (localised vs. systemic therapy).

This study was designed to determine whether similar accumulation of Ep-ICD is a common event in other epithelial cancers.  Methodology and results:   Ten epithelial cancers were immunohistochemically analyzed using Ep-ICD and EpEx domain-specific antibodies. The subcellular localization of EpEx and Ep-ICD in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line CX-1 was observed using immunofluorescence. Nuclear and cytoplasmic Ep-ICD expression was increased in cancers of the breast (31 of 38 tissues, 82%), prostate (40 of 49 tissues, 82%), head and neck (37 of 57 tissues, 65%) and esophagus (17 of 46 tissues, 37%) compared to their corresponding normal tissues that showed membrane localization of the protein. Importantly, Ep-ICD was not detected in the nuclei of epithelial cells in most normal tissues. High nuclear and cytoplasmic Ep-ICD accumulation also occurred in the other six epithelial cancer types analyzed - lung, colon, liver, bladder, pancreatic, and ovarian. A concomitant reduction in membrane EpEx expression was observed in a subset of all cancer types. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed nuclear Ep-ICD distinguished breast cancers with 82% sensitivity and 100% specificity and prostate cancers with 82% sensitivity and 78% specificity. Similar findings were observed for cytoplasmic accumulation of Ep-ICD in these cancers. We provide clinical evidence of increased nuclear and cytoplasmic Ep-ICD accumulation and a reduction in membranous EpEx in these cancers.

The emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies has dramatically changed the speed of all aspects of sequencing in a rapid and cost-effective fashion, which can permit an unbiased, quantitive and in-depth investigation of small RNA transcriptome. In this study, we used high-throughput Illumina sequencing to comprehensively represent the full complement of individual small RNA and to characterize miRNA expression profiles in both the androgen dependent and independent Pca cell line. At least 83 miRNAs are significantly differentially expressed, of which 41 are up-regulated and 42 are down-regulated, indicating these miRNAs may be involved in the transition of LNCaP to an androgen-independent phenotype. In addition, we have identified 43 novel miRNAs from the androgen dependent and independent PCa library and 3 of them are specific to the androgen-independent PCa. Function annotation of target genes indicated that most of these differentially expressed miRNAs tend to target genes involved in signal transduction and cell communication, epically the MAPK signaling pathway. The small RNA transcriptomes obtained in this study provide considerable insights into a better understanding of the expression and function of small RNAs in the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer.""","""['Gang Xu', 'Jinyu Wu', 'LingLin Zhou', 'Binghua Chen', 'Zhongsheng Sun', 'Fangqing Zhao', 'Zhihua Tao']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Expression profile analysis of microRNAs in prostate cancer by next-generation sequencing.', 'Genome-wide expression profiling reveals transcriptomic variation and perturbed gene networks in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Integration of cap analysis of gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis on array reveals genome-wide androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'The genomic landscape of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Selection of endogenous control and identification of significant microRNA deregulations in cervical cancer.', 'Prostate cancer small extracellular vesicles participate in androgen-independent transformation of prostate cancer by transferring let-7a-5p.', 'Loading of ""cocktail siRNAs"" into extracellular vesicles via TAT-DRBD peptide for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The MYH9 Cytoskeletal Protein Is a Novel Corepressor of Androgen Receptors.', 'Emerging roles and mechanisms of microRNA‑222‑3p in human cancer (Review).']"""

The retroviral/retrotransposon gene machinery consists mainly of Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs-1) and Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) that code for their own endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT). Interestingly, RT is typically expressed at high levels in cancer cells. Recent studies report that RT inhibition by non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) induces growth arrest and cell differentiation in vitro and antagonizes growth of human tumors in animal model. In the present study we analyze the anticancer activity of Abacavir (ABC), a nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitor (NRTI), on PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines.  Principal findings:   ABC significantly reduces cell growth, migration and invasion processes, considerably slows S phase progression, induces senescence and cell death in prostate cancer cells. Consistent with these observations, microarray analysis on PC3 cells shows that ABC induces specific and dose-dependent changes in gene expression, involving multiple cellular pathways. Notably, by quantitative Real-Time PCR we found that LINE-1 ORF1 and ORF2 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated by ABC treatment.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate the potential of ABC as anticancer agent able to induce antiproliferative activity and trigger senescence in prostate cancer cells.

Current diagnostic methods cannot predict metastatic PCa at a curable stage of the disease. Identification of metabolic pathways involved in the growth of bone metastases therefore has the potential to improve PCa prognostication as well as therapy.  Methodology/principal findings:   Metabolomics was applied for the study of PCa bone metastases (n = 20) in comparison with corresponding normal bone (n = 14), and furthermore of malignant (n = 13) and benign (n = 17) prostate tissue and corresponding plasma samples obtained from patients with (n = 15) and without (n = 13) diagnosed metastases and from men with benign prostate disease (n = 30). This was done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for sample characterization, and chemometric bioinformatics for data analysis. Results were verified in a separate test set including metastatic and normal bone tissue from patients with other cancers (n = 7). Significant differences were found between PCa bone metastases, bone metastases of other cancers, and normal bone. Furthermore, we identified metabolites in primary tumor tissue and in plasma which were significantly associated with metastatic disease. Among the metabolites in PCa bone metastases especially cholesterol was noted. In a test set the mean cholesterol level in PCa bone metastases was 127.30 mg/g as compared to 81.06 and 35.85 mg/g in bone metastases of different origin and normal bone, respectively (P = 0.0002 and 0.001). Immunohistochemical staining of PCa bone metastases showed intense staining of the low density lipoprotein receptor and variable levels of the scavenger receptor class B type 1 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme reductase in tumor epithelial cells, indicating possibilities for influx and de novo synthesis of cholesterol.  Conclusions/significance:   We have identified metabolites associated with PCa metastasis and specifically identified high levels of cholesterol in PCa bone metastases.

Here, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the expression levels of 459 human kinase genes in 5681 samples consisting of 44 healthy and 55 malignant human tissues. Defining the tissues where the kinase genes were transcriptionally active led to a functional genomic taxonomy of the kinome and a classification of human tissues and disease types based on the similarity of their kinome gene expression. The co-expression network around each of the kinase genes was defined in order to determine the functional context, i.e. the biological processes that were active in the cells and tissues where the kinase gene was expressed. Strong associations for individual kinases were found for mitosis (69 genes, including AURKA and BUB1), cell cycle control (73 genes, including PLK1 and AURKB), DNA repair (49 genes, including CHEK1 and ATR), immune response (72 genes, including MATK), neuronal (131 genes, including PRKCE) and muscular (72 genes, including MYLK2) functions. We then analyzed which kinase genes gain or lose transcriptional activity in the development of prostate and lung cancers and elucidated the functional associations of individual cancer associated kinase genes.

We hypothesized that the efficacy of treatment will be enhanced by individualized vaccination regimens tailored by simple mathematical models.  Methodology/principal findings:   We developed a general mathematical model encompassing the basic interactions of a vaccine, immune system and PCa cells, and validated it by the results of a clinical trial testing an allogeneic PCa whole-cell vaccine. For model validation in the absence of any other pertinent marker, we used the clinically measured changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels as a correlate of tumor burden. Up to 26 PSA levels measured per patient were divided into each patient's training set and his validation set. The training set, used for model personalization, contained the patient's initial sequence of PSA levels; the validation set contained his subsequent PSA data points. Personalized models were simulated to predict changes in tumor burden and PSA levels and predictions were compared to the validation set. The model accurately predicted PSA levels over the entire measured period in 12 of the 15 vaccination-responsive patients (the coefficient of determination between the predicted and observed PSA values was R(2) = 0.972). The model could not account for the inconsistent changes in PSA levels in 3 of the 15 responsive patients at the end of treatment. Each validated personalized model was simulated under many hypothetical immunotherapy protocols to suggest alternative vaccination regimens. Personalized regimens predicted to enhance the effects of therapy differed among the patients.  Conclusions/significance:   Using a few initial measurements, we constructed robust patient-specific models of PCa immunotherapy, which were retrospectively validated by clinical trial results.

Since March 2009, all PSA tests were reported with specific interpretative comments including a recommendation for referral to urology for a PSA >2.5 ng ml(-1). All PSA tests were performed on campus since institution of these recommendations were analyzed, and charts reviewed for all patients not seen in urology with a serum PSA >2.5 ng ml(-1). Of the 2884 non-urology patients that had a serum PSA drawn between March 2009 and February 2010 at UTSW, 293 patients had a serum PSA >2.5 ng ml(-1). Of these, 39 patients had known prostate cancer and were seeing an oncologist. There were 59 patients seeing urologists outside the institution. A total of 195 patients were not seen by an urologist and only 11 patients were recommended to see one but did not make an appointment. There were 151 patients with more than one PSA in the system, and of these 103 had a rise in PSA with a median rise of 0.53 ng ml(-1) per year.

One potential source of error is when joint health state (JS) utilities are rated higher than the embedded single state (SS) utilities. Knowing when and in whom this occurs can improve cost-effectiveness analyses.  Methods:   Men (n = 323) were surveyed at the time of prostate biopsy. Time tradeoff SS and JS utilities for prevalent prostate cancer (PCa) health states were collected. JS utilities assessed included those most prevalent for PCa. ""Inconsistency"" was defined in the following 3 ways: (1) any size rank order violation; (2) total number of violations; and (3) differences greater than 1 standard deviation (SD). Regression analysis assessed independent patient characteristics associated with inconsistent responses.  Results:   Aggregate JS utilities were consistent. At the individual level, 36% to 41% of responses violated rank order and 12% to 14% were larger than 1 SD. In all, 69% of respondents had at least 1 JS inconsistency, and 24% had >1 SD inconsistencies. Being married and feeling anxious were independently correlated with giving all types of inconsistent ratings, and lower education correlated with making >SD errors. SS utilities, and not JS utilities, were significantly lower for the inconsistent group. ""Correcting"" JS inconsistencies decreased aggregate utilities 1 to 9 units.  Conclusions:   Inconsistent JS utilities for PCa are prevalent in men at biopsy. Being married, more anxious, and having less education are correlated with inconsistencies. It is the SS utilities, rather than the JS utilities, that differ between consistent and inconsistent raters.

In this study, we designed a novel fusion peptide, BSD352, containing three functional domains: a protein transduction domain from HIV transactivating regulatory protein (TAT) followed by the BH3 domain of the p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (TAT-BH3), an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor peptide (SP5.2), and an anti-basic fibroblast growth factor peptide (DG2). These different domains in BSD352 were linked together by a linker sequence corresponding to a PSA hydrolytic substrate peptide. The BSD352 fusion peptide could be selectively cleaved by PSA in PSA-producing LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, the BSD352 fusion peptide was efficiently transduced into tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, and the BH3 domain was found to induce tumor cell apoptosis by elevating the expression of Bax, cytochrome C release, and caspase-9 cleavage. Moreover, the SP5.2 and DG2 domains in the BSD352 fusion peptide also exhibited in-vitro endothelial cell growth inhibition and in-vivo antiangiogenic activities. Direct injection of BSD352 into an established LNCaP xenograft tumor in mice inhibited tumor growth, whereas a synergistic effect was observed with the combined use of wild-type BH3, SP5.2, and DG2 functional domains. These results suggest that BSD352 could be beneficial for the treatment of accessible prostate tumors and may provide a complementary strategy for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Bin Li', 'Li-Jun Zhang', 'Zhou-Liang Zhang', 'Min Long', 'Ji-Hong Ren', 'Fang Lin', 'Xi Wang', 'Jun-Xia Wei', 'Ke Dong', 'Hui-Zhong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Suppression of LNCaP prostate cancer xenograft tumors by a prostate-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase, prostatic acid phosphatase.', 'Monomethylated selenium inhibits growth of LNCaP human prostate cancer xenograft accompanied by a decrease in the expression of androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).', 'Inhibition of human prostate cancer xenograft growth by 125I labeled triple-helix forming oligonucleotide directed against androgen receptor.', 'Targeted prodrug approaches for hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Remodelling of the tumour microenvironment by the kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'Making smart drugs smarter: The importance of linker chemistry in targeted drug delivery.', 'Extracellular vesicle-enclosed miR-486-5p mediates wound healing with adipose-derived stem cells by promoting angiogenesis.', 'KLK-targeted Therapies for Prostate Cancer.', 'A prostate-specific antigen-dependent fusion polypeptide inhibits growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.']"""

Methods:   We reviewed the records of 233 prostate cancer patients irradiated after prostatectomy between 1987 and 2002. Ninety-nine patients were treated with a volumetric 3-dimensional conformal approach and 134 patients were treated conventionally. Acute and late GI and GU toxicity was recorded and the relationships between dosimetry parameters and comorbidities and toxicity were examined.  Results:   Acute grade 2 to 3 GI toxicity was more common in the conventionally versus conformally treated patients (83% vs. 61%, P=0.01). The rates of acute grade 2 to 3 GU toxicity were not significantly different between the techniques. There were no acute grade 4 events. Most patients had no late GI toxicity (73% conformal and 75% conventional) and no late GU toxicity (64% conformal and 59% conventional). In an actuarial analysis, the 5-year rates of grade 2 to 4 GI and GU complications were not different between the treatment techniques. Two patients treated conventionally had late grade 4 complications. Hemorrhoids predicted for late GI toxicity, and renal stones and preirradiation urinary incontinence predicted for late GU complications. Delivery of 50 Gy to more than 38% of the rectal volume, 40 Gy to more than 58%, or 30 Gy to more than 72% was associated with an increased risk of late GI complications. Eighty-seven percent of the late GI complications occurred in patients with at least grade 2 acute GI toxicity.  Conclusions:   For prostate cancer patients treated with postoperative radiation, limited toxicity is seen with conventional or conformal techniques. The similar rates of toxicity between techniques may have been because of higher conformal median doses -70 Gy versus 62 Gy.

It remains unclear whether NO can inhibit the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. EMT induction is mediated, in part, by the constitutive activation of the metastasis-inducer transcription factor, Snail and EMT can be inhibited by the metastasis-suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and E-cadherin. Snail is transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB and in turn, Snail represses RKIP transcription. Hence, we hypothesized that high levels of NO, that inhibit NF-κB activity, may also inhibit Snail and induce RKIP and leading to inhibition of EMT. We show that treatment of human prostate metastatic cell lines with the NO donor, DETANONOate, inhibits EMT and reverses both the mesenchymal phenotype and the cell invasive properties. Further, treatment with DETANONOate inhibits Snail expression and DNA-binding activity in parallel with the upregulation of RKIP and E-cadherin protein levels. The pivotal roles of Snail inhibition and RKIP induction in DETANONOate-mediated inhibition of EMT were corroborated by both Snail silencing by siRNA and by ectopic expression of RKIP. The in vitro findings were validated in vivo in mice bearing PC-3 xenografts and treated with DETANONOate. The present findings show, for the first time, the novel role of high subtoxic concentrations of NO in the inhibition of EMT. Thus, NO donors may exert therapeutic activities in the reversal of EMT and metastasis.""","""['Stavroula Baritaki', 'Sara Huerta-Yepez', 'Anna Sahakyan', 'Iordanis Karagiannides', 'Kyriaki Bakirtzi', 'Ali Jazirehi', 'Benjamin Bonavida']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Dual role of NO donors in the reversal of tumor cell resistance and EMT: Downregulation of the NF-κB/Snail/YY1/RKIP circuitry.', 'Inhibition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in metastatic prostate cancer cells by the novel proteasome inhibitor, NPI-0052: pivotal roles of Snail repression and RKIP induction.', 'The novel role of Yin Yang 1 in the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in cancer via the dysregulated NF-κB/Snail/YY1/RKIP/PTEN Circuitry.', 'Novel therapeutic applications of nitric oxide donors in cancer: roles in chemo- and immunosensitization to apoptosis and inhibition of metastases.', 'Pivotal roles of snail inhibition and RKIP induction by the proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 in tumor cell chemoimmunosensitization.', ""Nitric Oxide Prevents Glioblastoma Stem Cells' Expansion and Induces Temozolomide Sensitization."", 'Targeting Nitric Oxide: Say NO to Metastasis.', 'Downregulation of iNOS/NO Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Metastasis in Colorectal Cancer.', 'The Nitric Oxide Donor Zn(PipNONO)Cl Exhibits Antitumor Activity through Inhibition of Epithelial and Endothelial Mesenchymal Transitions.', 'A Stochastic Binary Model for the Regulation of Gene Expression to Investigate Responses to Gene Therapy.']"""

We pursue integrated diagnostic quality MRI functionality with radiotherapy systems to boost the possibilities of image guidance by providing images with superior soft-tissue contrast during treatment. However, the use of MR images in radiotherapy can be hindered by geometrical distortions due to magnetic field inhomogeneity problems. A method for fast correction of these distortions is presented and implemented. Using a 20 cm square phantom containing a regular grid, a measure of residual deformation after correction is established. At very low gradient strength (which leads to large deformations) a maximum displacement of 2.9 mm is shown to be reduced to 0.63 mm. Next, the method is applied in vivo to the case of pelvic body contour extraction for prostate radiotherapy treatment planning. Here, again with low gradient strengths, distortions of up to 6 mm can be reduced to 2 mm. All results are provided within a lag time of 8 ms. We discuss implications of image distortions for MRI-guided photon and proton radiotherapy separately, since the dose-depth curves in these treatments are very different. We argue that, although field inhomogeneities cannot be prevented from occurring, distortion correction is not always necessary in practice.

Immunologic response was monitored by measuring levels of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors and peptide-specific immunoglobulin G. In another ITK-1 phase I trial for advanced prostate cancer, the vaccination schedule was skipped or discontinued in all three patients receiving the highest dose (5 mg/peptide) because of injection site reactions. This trial was therefore ended without enrollment for the highest dose, and data were analyzed by intention to treat.

The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) was a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of finasteride in 18,882 men. Clinical data and blood and tissue specimens were collected at baseline and throughout the study, offering an opportunity to create a program project to investigate hypotheses related to the biology underlying the PCPT findings as well as the etiology and risk of prostate cancer. The transition of the randomized PCPT into this translational and epidemiologic scientific investigation required extensive planning and coordination. Five individual but interrelated projects were brought together with the underlying program theme of the genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors associated with the risks of overall and high-grade prostate cancer and how these factors affected the efficacy of finasteride in preventing cancer. All projects with serum-based measures use a single, shared, nested case-control sample of participants so that each subject provides a more complete biomarker and genetic profile for the evaluation of joint effects of these factors. Strengths of this program include the following: 1) the control group contains only men who are negative for biopsy-detected cancer, 2) the statistical methods to evaluate associations of risk factors with disease are shared across all projects, 3) the large number of cancer cases with fully characterized genetic, metabolic, and behavioral exposures, 4) a central pathology core histopathologically classified the prostate cancer, and 5) cancer cases identified during the PCPT reflect the characteristics of cases currently being detected in the prostate-specific antigen screening era, leading to contemporary and highly relevant results.

In secondary analyses, prostate cancer risk was found to increase as a function of the number of metformin prescriptions received (one to seven prescriptions: RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.80-1.37; seven to eighteen prescriptions: RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.99-1.69; eighteen to thirty-six prescriptions: RR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.81; more than thirty-six prescriptions: RR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.03-1.89).

A panel of four kallikrein markers (total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, and kallikrein-related peptidase 2) is a highly accurate predictor of biopsy outcome. The clinical significance of biopsy-detectable cancers in men classified as low-risk by this panel remains unclear.  Methods:   The Malmö Diet and Cancer study is a population-based cohort of 11,063 Swedish men aged 45 to 73 providing a blood sample at baseline during 1991-1996. The Swedish Cancer Registry was used to identify 943 men diagnosed with prostate cancer by December 31, 2006. PSA testing was low. We assessed the predictive accuracy of our published statistical model to predict subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis in men with a total PSA level of 3.0 ng/mL or more at baseline.  Results:   Compared with total PSA and age, the full kallikrein panel enhanced the predictive accuracy for clinically diagnosed prostate cancer (concordance index 0.65 vs. 0.75; P < 0.001). For every 1,000 men with a total PSA level of 3 ng/mL or more at baseline, the model would classify as high-risk 131 of 152 (86%) of the cancer cases diagnosed clinically within 5 years; 421 men would be classified as low-risk by the panel and recommended against biopsy. Of these, only 2 would be diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer (clinical T3-T4 or metastases) within 5 years.  Conclusions:   Men with a PSA level of 3 ng/mL or more but defined as low-risk by the panel of four kallikrein markers are unlikely to develop incurable prostate cancer.

Nonmalignant IBC-10a cells expressed low levels of ras/RPS2 and elevated pre-let-7a-1/let-7a/let-7f miRNA, whereas the reverse occurred in malignant PCa-20a and PC-3ML cells. Stable transfection of IBC-10a cells with pBABE.ras and pBABE.RPS2 induced ras, c-myc, and RPS2 expression, whereas the levels of let-7a/let-7f miRNA dropped to near zero. Conversely, in pBABE.pre-let-7a-1 transfected PCa-20a and PC-3ML clones, let-7a/let-7f increased whereas ras, RPS2, and c-myc dropped greater than 5-fold. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, antibody ""supershift"" assays and immunoprecipitation assays revealed that RPS2 specifically binds pre-let-7a-1 to block RNA processing. Immunoflourescent studies and Northern blots confirmed that RPS2 complexes with pre-let-7a-1 (i.e., in episomal structures) to block processing to let-7a/let-7f, indicating RPS2 may prevent let-7a miRNA expression to indirectly promote oncogene expression. Functional studies further showed that the colony-forming ability (CFA) and invasive activities of IBC-10a cells were significantly enhanced in pBABE-ras.IBC-10a and pBABE-RPS2-IBC-10a clones. Conversely, with the ""knockdown"" of ras and RPS2 in malignant PC-3ML cells (i.e., in pLKO.TRC.shRNA.ras.PC3-ML, pLKO.TRC.shRNA.RPS2.PC-3ML transfected cells), there was both a loss of these functions and a loss of tumorigenesis in SCID mice. Likewise, with the overexpression of let-7a/let-7f in pBABE.pre-let-7a-1.PC-3ML clones (and PCa-20a clones), CFAs, invasive activities in vitro, and tumorigenesis in vivo were significantly reduced.

Chemotherapy, androgen ablation, and androgen antagonist treatments have proven to have significant effects in the early stages of prostate cancer, whereas advanced prostate cancer is resilient to such treatments. The androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor, is the major drug target of prostate cancer therapy. Transition to the androgen-independent stage involves the activation of signaling pathways, AR gene mutations, and other mechanisms. Higher basidiomycetes mushrooms have been used since ancient times in folk medicine to treat a diversity of diseases, including cancer. The present study evaluates the antiandrogenic activity of different Coprinus comatus strains in their ability to interfere with AR function. The authors found that the most active extract was C comatus strain 734 extracted with hexane (CC734-H). This extract was able to (1) inhibit AR-mediated reporter activity, (2) inhibit the proliferation and viability of the LNCaP cell line, and (3) inhibit the colony formation of the LNCaP cell line, in comparison to the DU-145, PC-3, and MDA-Kb2 cells. In addition, CC734-H was able to reduce AR levels and prostate-specific antigen gene expression in the LNCaP-treated cell line.

Patients and methods:   A total of 306 patients with localized prostate cancer were randomized. No androgen deprivation was allowed. The primary endpoint was biochemical relapse according to the modified 1997-American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and Phoenix definitions. Toxicity was graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1991 criteria and the late effects on normal tissues-subjective, objective, management, analytic scales (LENT-SOMA) scales. The patients' quality of life was scored using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item cancer-specific and 25-item prostate-specific modules.  Results:   The median follow-up was 61 months. According to the 1997-American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology definition, the 5-year biochemical relapse rate was 39% and 28% in the 70- and 80-Gy arms, respectively (p = .036). Using the Phoenix definition, the 5-year biochemical relapse rate was 32% and 23.5%, respectively (p = .09).

The levels of adrenal androgens in prostate cancer tissues after ADT were similar to those in untreated PCa. Especially, DHEA was the most existing androgen precursor in PCa tissues after ADT.

Methods:   We evaluated %fPSA performance in 1077 men who had undergone initial extended prostate biopsy. The men were categorized according to their PSA level into 2 groups (>4.0 and ≤4.0) ng/mL.

Men in the lowest quintiles of each pro-oxidant exposure received a score of four (the highest score), while those in the highest quintile received a score of zero (the lowest score). In contrast, scoring for all anti-oxidants was performed in the opposite way. Total oxidative balance score was calculated by summating all individual scores of pro- and anti-oxidative variables, with higher values indicating a higher antioxidant status.  Results:   The average oxidative balance score was similar between prostate cancer cases and men in the subcohort: 25.2 and 25.3, respectively. There was no association between oxidative balance score and overall risk of prostate cancer with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.00, 1.02, 1.03, 0.97 and 1.01 for increasing quintiles of the score (p-trend=0.71). There were also no associations for non-advanced or advanced disease, or when analysis was restricted to incident cases that arose after two years of follow-up (n=508). In general constituents of the score were not associated with prostate cancer, except for red meat intake (HR=1.44; 95%CI 1.06-1.95 comparing Q5 vs. Q1) and lycopene (HRs of 0.7-0.8 for increasing quintiles).  Conclusion:   Our findings do not support an association between oxidative balance score and risks of overall prostate cancer or advanced disease.""","""['Ilir Agalliu', 'Victoria A Kirsh', 'Nancy Kreiger', 'Colin L Soskolne', 'Thomas E Rohan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Measures of combined antioxidant and pro-oxidant exposures and risk of overall and advanced stage prostate cancer.', 'Lower prostate cancer risk in men with elevated plasma lycopene levels: results of a prospective analysis.', 'Effects of long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution on respiratory and cardiovascular mortality in the Netherlands: the NLCS-AIR study.', 'Hypothesis: oxidative stress score as a combined measure of pro-oxidant and antioxidant exposures.', 'The role of oxidative stress in prostate cancer.', 'Association of Dietary Inflammatory Index and Dietary Oxidative Balance Score with All-Cause and Disease-Specific Mortality: Findings of 2003-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.', 'The association between oxidative balance score and periodontitis in adults: a population-based study.', 'Vitamin E Intake and Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Association Between Red and Processed Meat Consumption and Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Consumption of red meat and processed meat and cancer incidence: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.']"""

Previous studies largely performed at tertiary care centers with relatively young, racially homogenous cohorts found a short PSADT on recurrence after RP portended a poor prognosis.  Methods:   We performed a Cox proportional hazards analysis to examine the correlation between postrecurrence PSADT and the interval from recurrence to OS and prostate cancer-specific mortality among 345 men in the SEARCH database who had undergone RP from 1988 to 2008. We examined the PSADT as a categorical variable using the clinically significant cutpoints of <3, 3-8.9, 9-14.9, and ≥15 months.  Results:   A PSADT of <3 months (hazard ratio 5.48, P = .002) was associated with poorer OS than a PSADT of ≥15 months.

Objectives:   To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in urine from diverse clinical contexts and to explore potential clinical applications.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 101 subjects were enrolled in 2008 from urologic oncology clinics to form three study groups: 44 PCa free, 46 confirmed PCa, and 11 negative prostate biopsies. The PCa-free group included females, healthy young men, and post-radical prostatectomy (RP) patients. The confirmed PCa group was composed of patients under active surveillance, scheduled for treatment, or with metastatic disease.  Measurements:   Urine was collected after attentive digital rectal exam (DRE) and coded to blind group allocation for laboratory test. RNA from urine sediments was analyzed using a panel of four TMPRSS2:ERG fusion markers with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).  Results and limitations:   Our fusion markers demonstrated very high technical specificity and sensitivity for detecting a single fusion-positive cancer cell (VCaP) in the presence of at least 3000 cells in urine sediments. In clinical analysis, there were no fusion-positive samples in the PCa-free group (0 of 44 samples), while there were 16 of 46 (34.8%) fusion-positive samples in the confirmed PCa group. The fusion incidence varied significantly among the three PCa subgroups. The clinical sensitivity increased to 45.4% in cancer patients prior to treatments. The fusion markers were detected in 2 of 11 (18.2%) biopsy-negative patients, suggesting potentially false negative biopsies. This study is not prospective and is limited in sample sizes.

Several lines of evidence suggest that aspirin might also reduce risk of other cancers, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract, but proof in man is lacking. We studied deaths due to cancer during and after randomised trials of daily aspirin versus control done originally for prevention of vascular events.  Methods:   We used individual patient data from all randomised trials of daily aspirin versus no aspirin with mean duration of scheduled trial treatment of 4 years or longer to determine the effect of allocation to aspirin on risk of cancer death in relation to scheduled duration of trial treatment for gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal cancers. In three large UK trials, long-term post-trial follow-up of individual patients was obtained from death certificates and cancer registries.  Results:   In eight eligible trials (25 570 patients, 674 cancer deaths), allocation to aspirin reduced death due to cancer (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·68-0·92, p=0·003). On analysis of individual patient data, which were available from seven trials (23 535 patients, 657 cancer deaths), benefit was apparent only after 5 years' follow-up (all cancers, hazard ratio [HR] 0·66, 0·50-0·87; gastrointestinal cancers, 0·46, 0·27-0·77; both p=0·003). The 20-year risk of cancer death (1634 deaths in 12 659 patients in three trials) remained lower in the aspirin groups than in the control groups (all solid cancers, HR 0·80, 0·72-0·88, p<0·0001; gastrointestinal cancers, 0·65, 0·54-0·78, p<0·0001), and benefit increased (interaction p=0·01) with scheduled duration of trial treatment (≥7·5 years: all solid cancers, 0·69, 0·54-0·88, p=0·003; gastrointestinal cancers, 0·41, 0·26-0·66, p=0·0001). The latent period before an effect on deaths was about 5 years for oesophageal, pancreatic, brain, and lung cancer, but was more delayed for stomach, colorectal, and prostate cancer. For lung and oesophageal cancer, benefit was confined to adenocarcinomas, and the overall effect on 20-year risk of cancer death was greatest for adenocarcinomas (HR 0·66, 0·56-0·77, p<0·0001). Benefit was unrelated to aspirin dose (75 mg upwards), sex, or smoking, but increased with age-the absolute reduction in 20-year risk of cancer death reaching 7·08% (2·42-11·74) at age 65 years and older.  Interpretation:   Daily aspirin reduced deaths due to several common cancers during and after the trials. Benefit increased with duration of treatment and was consistent across the different study populations.

We examined relationships between histopathologic diagnoses, false-positive test group, and participant and screening test characteristics.  Methods:   The PLCO ovarian cancer screening arm included 39,105 women aged 55-74 years assigned to annual CA-125 and TVU. Histopathologic diagnoses from women with false-positive tests and subsequent surgery were reviewed in this analysis: all CA125+ (n=121); all CA125+/TVU+ (n=46); and a random sample of TVU+ (n=373). Demographic and ovarian cancer risk factor data were self-reported. Pathologic diagnoses were abstracted from surgical pathology reports. We compared participant characteristics and pathologic diagnoses by category of false-positive using Pearson χ2, Fisher's exact, or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests.  Results:   Women with a false-positive TVU were younger (P<0.001), heavier (P<0.001), and reported a higher frequency of prior hysterectomy (P<0.001). Serous cystadenoma, the most common benign ovarian diagnosis, was more frequent among women with TVU+ compared to CA-125+ and CA-125+/TVU+ (P<0.001). Benign non-ovarian findings were commonly associated with all false-positives, although more frequently with CA-125+ than TVU+ or CA-125+/TVU+ groups (P=0.019). Non-ovarian cancers were diagnosed most frequently among CA-125+ (P<0.001).

AGR2 has been implicated in a number of human cancers. In particular, AGR2 has previously been found to be one of several genes that encode secreted proteins showing increased expression in prostate cancer cells compared to normal prostatic epithelium.  Methods:   Gene expression levels of AGR2 were examined in prostate cancer cells by microarray analysis. We further examined the relationship of AGR2 protein expression to histopathology and prostate cancer outcome on a population basis using tissue microarray technology.  Results:   At the RNA and protein level, there was an increase in AGR2 expression in adenocarcinoma of the prostate compared to morphologically normal prostatic glandular epithelium. Using a tissue microarray, this enhanced AGR2 expression was seen as early as premalignant PIN lesions. Interestingly, within adenocarcinoma samples, there was a slight trend toward lower levels of AGR2 with increasing Gleason score. Consistent with this, relatively lower levels of AGR2 were highly predictive of disease recurrence in patients who had originally presented with high-stage primary prostate cancer (P = 0.009).

Decreased expression of selenium-binding protein 1 has been reported in cancers of the prostate, stomach, colon, and lungs. No information, however, is available concerning the roles of selenium-binding protein 1 in uterine leiomyoma.  Methods:   Using Western Blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, we examined the expression of selenium-binding protein 1 in uterine leiomyoma and normal myometrium in 20 patients who had undergone hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma.  Results and discussion:   The patient age ranged from 34 to 58 years with a mean of 44.3 years. Proliferative endometrium was seen in 8 patients, secretory endometrium in 7 patients, and atrophic endometrium in 5 patients. Two patients showed solitary leiomyoma, and eighteen patients revealed 2 to 5 tumors. Tumor size ranged from 1 to 15.5 cm with a mean of 4.3 cm. Both Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry showed a significant lower level of selenium-binding protein 1 in leiomyoma than in normal myometrium. Larger tumors had a tendency to show a lower level of selenium-binding protein 1 than smaller ones, but the difference did not reach a statistical significance. The expression of selenium-binding protein 1 was the same among patients with proliferative, secretory, and atrophic endometrium in either leiomyoma or normal myometrium.

In order to determine if difference exists according to the hormonal treatment duration, a literature-based meta-analysis was performed.  Methods:   Relative risks (RR) were derived through a random-effect model. Differences in primary (biochemical failure, BF; cancer-specific survival, CSS), and secondary outcomes (overall survival, OS; local or distant recurrence, LR/DM) were explored. Absolute differences (AD) and the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated. Heterogeneity, a meta-regression for clinic-pathological predictors and a correlation test for surrogates were conducted.  Results:   Five trials (3,424 patients) were included. Patient population ranged from 267 to 1,521 patients. The longer hormonal treatment significantly improves BF (with significant heterogeneity) with an absolute benefit of 10.1%, and a non significant trend in CSS. With regard to secondary end-points, the longer hormonal treatment significantly decrease both the LR and the DM with an absolute difference of 11.7% and 11.5%. Any significant difference in OS was observed. None of the three identified clinico-pathological predictors (median PSA, range 9.5-20.35, Gleason score 7-10, 27-55% patients/trial, and T3-4, 13-77% patients/trial), did significantly affect outcomes. At the meta-regression analysis a significant correlation between the overall treatment benefit in BF, CSS, OS, LR and DM, and the length of the treatment was found (p ≤ 0.03).

Design and setting:   Search of the Media Doctor Australia media-monitoring website for stories about newly reported cancer interventions, including drugs, diagnostic tests, surgery and complementary therapies, that had been collected from June 2004 to June 2009 and rated for quality using a validated rating instrument. A mixed-methods approach was used to analyse data and story content. Data from the website on stories about other new health interventions and procedures were compared.  Main outcome measures:   Differences in quality scores between cancer-related news stories (""cancer stories"") and other stories, and between types of media outlet; differences in how cancer was reported in terms of cancer type, morbidity, mortality, and in the use of hyperbole and emotive language.  Results:   272 unique cancer stories were critically reviewed by Media Doctor Australia. Cancer stories had significantly higher scores for quality than other stories (F=7.1; df=1; P=0.008). Most cancer stories concerned disease affecting the breast or prostate gland, with breast cancer appearing to be over-represented as a topic relative to its incidence. Pairwise comparisons showed statistically significant superiority for broadsheet newspaper stories over online stories (F=12.7; df=1; P<0.001) and television stories (F=10.7; df=1; P=0.001). Descriptions of morbidity and mortality were variable and often confusing in terms of numbers, time periods and locations. Literary devices including hyperbole and emotive language were used extensively, mostly by the researchers.

Up to now, little is known, however, if methylseleninic acid (MSA) has the anticancer effect on lung cancer or not. The objective of this study is to detect the effect of MSA on proliferation inhibition and apoptotic induction for human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line L9981, and to explore the molecular mechanisms.  Methods:   The changes of proliferation, clone formation, apoptotic level and cell cycles were detected in L9981 by trypan blue staining, clone formation suppression test, and flow cytometry before and after treating with different concentration of MSA. The expression level of proliferative-related and apoptotic-related genes was also determined in L9981 by flow cytometry.  Results:   (1)The proliferation ability of L9981 was remarkably inhibited at the concentration of 0.5μmol/L of MSA (P < 0.05), and the cells were arrested at G0/G1 phase after treating with the same concentration. (2)Apoptosis of L9981 was remarkably induced by MSA at the concentration of 2.5μmol/L (P < 0.05). (3)The clone formation ability of L9981 was significantly suppressed by MSA at the concentration of 5.0μmol/L (P < 0.05). (4)The expression levels of P53, P21, Fas, FasL and Bax were remarkably up-regulated after treatment with MSA.  Conclusions:   (1)MSA can significantly suppress the proliferation and clone formation ability of human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line L9981, and also induce apoptosis of L9981.

Among the enzymes required for the production of gangliosides, sialyltransferases have received much attention in terms of their relationship with cancer. In our previous report, ganglioside GD1a and sialyl paragloboside (SPG), a neolacto-series ganglioside, were much more abundant in PC3 and DU145 cells, castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, as compared with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells and normal prostate epithelium. GD1a is synthesized from GM1 by α2,3 sialyltransferase (ST3Gal) I and mainly by ST3Gal II. The enzyme to synthesize SPG is ST3Gal VI. The high production of GD1a and SPG in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells was correlated with the high expression of ST3Gal II and VI, respectively. The expression of ST3Gal I and II was mildly induced by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), and PMA-induced expression of ST3Gal I and ST3Gal II was inhibited by NF-κB decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) but not by AP-1 decoy ODN. Among the five mammalian homologs of the NF-κB family, RelB RNAi most effectively inhibited the expression of ST3Gal I and ST3Gal II. The expression of ST3Gal VI was also most effectively inhibited by RelB RNAi. The amount of GD1a and SPG was significantly reduced by RelB siRNA treatment in PC3 cells. Thus, the production of GD1a and SPG in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells was indirectly controlled by NF-κB, mainly by RelB, through the transcriptional regulation of ST3Gal I, II, and VI.""","""['Koji Hatano', 'Yasuhide Miyamoto', 'Norio Nonomura', 'Yasufumi Kaneda']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Androgen-regulated transcriptional control of sialyltransferases in prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of ganglioside GD1a synthesis suppresses the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts.', 'Mammalian sialyltransferase ST3Gal-II: its exchange sialylation catalytic properties allow labeling of sialyl residues in mucin-type sialylated glycoproteins and specific gangliosides.', 'Characterization of mouse sialyltransferase genes: their evolution and diversity.', 'Sialyltransferases in cancer.', 'Glycosylation Changes in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Prognostic and predictive value of ALDH1, SOX2 and SSEA-4 in bladder cancer.', 'Extracellular vesicles in prostate cancer: a narrative review.', 'Bisecting-GlcNAc on Asn388 is characteristic to ERC/mesothelin expressed on epithelioid mesothelioma cells.', 'Prospects for Using Expression Patterns of Paramyxovirus Receptors as Biomarkers for Oncolytic Virotherapy.']"""

Here, we report that chetomin, an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factors, is a potent enhancer of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. TRAIL or chetomin alone weakly induced apoptosis, but the combination of chetomin and TRAIL synergistically induced apoptosis in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. The combination of chetomin and TRAIL induces the activation of caspase-3, -8, -9 and -10. Among the apoptotic factors related to the TRAIL pathway, chetomin markedly decreased the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, but other IAP family members, TRAIL receptors and Bcl-2 family members were not altered by chetomin. Using XIAP siRNA instead of chetomin, down-regulation of XIAP sensitized PC-3 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Conversely, transient transfection of XIAP reduced the apoptotic response to combined treatment with chetomin and TRAIL. Treatment with chetomin induced a rapid decrease in XIAP protein levels but had no effect on XIAP mRNA levels. Since chetomin-mediated XIAP down-regulation was completely prevented by proteasome inhibitors, it was suggested that chetomin induces the degradation of the XIAP protein in a proteasome-dependent manner. Additionally, chetomin also sensitized renal cancer Caki-1 cells and bladder cancer UM-UC-3 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via down-regulation of XIAP. Co-treatment of chetomin and TRAIL did not enhance apoptosis in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

The results showed that 351 (96.2%) of RRP patients' demographic data were captured and 321 (87.9%) of RRP patients were staged. According to the international standards of CoC for an academic institution, the requirement is to capture 100% of all cancer cases and stage at least 90% of them. As for data completeness, 317 (86.7%) of RRP details were captured as compared to the CoC standard requirement of 90%.  Conclusions:   The existing manual cancer registry does not fully meet the CoC standards. Hence, the registry increased sources of case-finding and used active case-finding.

Methods:   Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and real time polymerase chain reaction were used to assess UGT2A1 gene expression in various human tissues. A glucuronidation assay measured by reverse phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine UGT2A1 activity.  Results:   UGT2A1 was expressed in aerodigestive tract tissues including trachea, larynx, tonsil, lung, and colon; no expression was observed in breast, whole brain, pancreas, prostate, kidney, liver, or esophagus. UGT2A1 exhibited highest expression in the lung, followed by trachea >tonsil >larynx >colon >olfactory tissue. Cell homogenates prepared from wildtype UGT2A1(75Lys308Gly) overexpressing HEK293 cells showed significant glucuronidation activity against a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including, 1-hydroxy-benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol, and 5-methylchrysene-1,2-diol. No activity was observed in UGT2A1 overexpressing cell homogenate against substrates that form N-glucuronides, such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), nicotine, or N-OH-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (N-OH PhIP). A significant (P<0.05) decrease (approximately 25%) in glucuronidation activity (Vmax/KM) was observed against all polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons substrates for the UGT2A1(75Lys308Gly) variant compared with homogenates from wildtype UGT2A1(75Lys308Gly); no activity was observed for cell homogenates overexpressing the UGT2A1 variant for all substrates tested.

These autoantibodies are a negative prognostic factor in prostate cancer and, when purified, stimulate tumor cell proliferation in vitro. It is unclear, however, whether these immunoglobulin Gs are merely a biomarker, or whether they actually promote the tumor growth in vivo. We immunized C57Bl/6 mice with recombinant GRP78 and then implanted the B16F1 murine melanoma cell line as flank tumors. We used the antisera from these mice for in-vitro cell signaling and proliferation assays. The immunodominant epitope in patients with cancer was well represented in the antibody repertoire of these immunized mice. We observed significantly accelerated tumor growth, and shortened survival in GRP78-immunized mice compared with controls. Furthermore, antisera from these mice, and purified anti-GRP78 immunoglobulin G from similarly immunized mice, stimulate Akt phosphorylation and proliferation in B16F1 and human DM6 melanoma cells in culture. These studies show a causal link between a humoral response to GRP78 and the progression of cancer in a murine melanoma model.

The immunological and clinical effects of vaccination with recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein combined with CpG as adjuvant were evaluated.  Experimental design:   In a phase I clinical study, patients with advanced prostate cancer were vaccinated with recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein (100 μg) mixed with CpG 7909 (2.5 mg) every 3 weeks intradermally for 4 doses. Objectives of the study were the safety of the vaccine and changes of specific humoral and cellular immunological responses to NY-ESO-1 in relation to detectable NY-ESO-1 expression in the individual tumor.  Results:   All 12 baseline sero-negative patients developed high-titer NY-ESO-1 antibody responses. B-cell epitope mapping identified NY-ESO-1 p91-110 to be recognized most frequently by vaccine-induced antibodies. Two patients developed significant antibody titers against the adjuvant CpG. NY-ESO-1-specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell responses were induced in 9 patients (69%). Five of these 9 patients did not express NY-ESO-1 in the autologous tumor. Postvaccine CD8+ T-cell clones recognized and lyzed HLA-matched tumor cell lines in an antigen-specific manner.  Conclusion:   Our data provide clear evidence for the capacity of NY-ESO-1 protein/CpG vaccine to induce integrated antigen-specific immune responses in vivo and to efficiently prime CD8+ T-cell responses in NY-ESO-1 antigen-negative patients.

Basically two types of DIC are distinguished: (1) chronic (compensated) - with alteration of laboratory values and (2) acute (non-compensated) - with severe clinical manifestations: bleeding, shock, acute renal failure (ARF), transient focal neurologic deficit, delirium or coma. Chronic DIC related to metastatic neoplasia is caused by pancreatic, gastric or prostatic carcinoma in most of the cases. Incidence rate of DIC is 13-30% in prostate cancer, among those only 0.4-1.65% of patients had clinical signs and symptoms of DIC. In other words, chronic DIC is developed in one of eight patients with prostate cancer. DIC is considered as a poor prognostic factor in prostatic carcinoma. The similar clinical and laboratory findings of TTP-HUS (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - hemolytic uremic syndrome) and DIC makes it difficult to differentiate between them. A 71 years old male patient with known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, significant carotid artery stenosis, gastric ulcer and alcoholic liver disease was admitted to another hospital with melena. Gastroscopy revealed intact gastric mucosa and actually non-bleeding duodenal ulcer covered by clots. Laboratory results showed hyperkalemia, elevated kidney function tests, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, increased liver function tests, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia and elevated international normalized ratio (INR). He was treated with saline infusions, four units of red blood cells and one unit of fresh frozen plasma transfusions. Four days later he was transported to our Institution with ARF. Physical examination revealed dyspnoe, petechiae, hemoptoe, oliguria, chest-wall pain and aggressive behavior. Thrombocytopenia, signs of MAHA (fragmentocytes and helmet cells in the peripheral blood), normal INR, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ARF suggested TTP-HUS. Hemodialysis and six plasmaferesis (PF) were carried out. After the fifth PF, skin manifestations of thrombotic microangiopathy occurred on the feet. Clotting analysis revealed elevated D-dimer (>5 μg/mL), normal fibrinogen (3.2 g/L), a slightly raised INR (1.36) and activated partial prothrombin time (APTT) (45.8 sec), normal reticulocyte (57 G/L) and a slightly low platelet count (123 G/L), which proved to be chronic DIC. Therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was started. Elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (109.6 ng/mL) suggested prostatic carcinoma. Prostate biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma (Gleason: 4+4 for left lobe and 3+3 for right lobe). Elevated alkaline phosphatase suggested metastases in the bone, which were confirmed by bone scintigraphy. Combined androgen blockade (CAB) was started. After three months follow-up our patient's status is satisfactory. PSA is in the normal range (4.6 ng/mL). Thrombocytopenia of uncertain origin with normal or raised INR, APTT, elevated D-dimer, normal fibrinogen and reticulocyte count prove the diagnosis of chronic DIC. This process warrants searching for metastatic neoplasia. Due to the relatively low serum levels of circulating procoagulant factors (e.g. tissue factor), therapeutic dose of LMWH can be used with good efficiency in chronic DIC with low risk of bleeding. Severe DIC as a complication of metastatic prostate cancer can be treated by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or CAB in combination with ketokonazole and concomitant use of supportive treatment.

Objective:   To assess the external validity of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculator (www.prostatecancer-riskcalculator.com) for the probability of having a positive prostate biopsy (P(posb)).  Design, setting and participants:   The ERSPC risk calculator was based on data of the initial screening round of the ERSPC section Rotterdam and validated in 1825 and 531 men biopsied at the initial screening round in the Finnish and Swedish sections of the ERSPC respectively. P(posb) was calculated using serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), outcome of digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound and ultrasound assessed prostate volume.  Measurements:   The external validity was assessed for the presence of cancer at biopsy by calibration (agreement between observed and predicted outcomes), discrimination (separation of those with and without cancer), and decision curves (for clinical usefulness).  Results and limitations:   Prostate cancer was detected in 469 men (26%) of the Finnish cohort and in 124 men (23%) of the Swedish cohort. Systematic miscalibration was present in both cohorts (mean predicted probability 34% versus 26% observed, and 29% versus 23% observed, both p<0.001). The areas under the curves were 0.76 and 0.78, and substantially lower for the model with PSA only (0.64 and 0.68 respectively). The model proved clinically useful for any decision threshold compared with a model with PSA only, PSA and DRE, or biopsying all men. A limitation is that the model is based on sextant biopsies results.  Conclusions:   The ERSPC risk calculator discriminated well between those with and without prostate cancer among initially screened men, but overestimated the risk of a positive biopsy.

In a prospective trial, we tested whether image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can safely deliver escalated nodal doses while treating the prostate with hypofractionated radiotherapy in 5½ weeks.  Methods and materials:   Pelvic nodal and prostatic image-guided IMRT was delivered to 53 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high-risk patients to a nodal dose of 56 Gy in 2-Gy fractions with concomitant treatment of the prostate to 70 Gy in 28 fractions of 2.5 Gy, and 50 of 53 patients received androgen deprivation for a median duration of 12 months.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 25.4 months (range, 4.2-57.2). No early Grade 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.3.0 genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were seen. The cumulative actuarial incidence of Grade 2 early GU toxicity (primarily alpha blocker initiation) was 38%. The rate was 32% for Grade 2 early GI toxicity. None of the dose-volume descriptors correlated with GU toxicity, and only the volume of bowel receiving ≥30 Gy correlated with early GI toxicity (p = 0.029). Maximum late Grades 1, 2, and 3 GU toxicities were seen in 30%, 25%, and 2% of patients, respectively. Maximum late Grades 1 and 2 GI toxicities were seen in 30% and 8% (rectal bleeding requiring cautery) of patients, respectively. The estimated 3-year biochemical control (nadir + 2) was 81.2 ± 6.6%. No patient manifested pelvic nodal failure, whereas 2 experienced paraaortic nodal failure outside the field. The six other clinical failures were distant only.  Conclusions:   Pelvic IMRT nodal dose escalation to 56 Gy was delivered concurrently with 70 Gy of hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy in a convenient, resource-efficient, and well-tolerated 28-fraction schedule.

These distributions can be used to identify areas of elevated or diminished biological effect. The location of such areas might be influenced in intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) optimization.  Methods and materials:   Because Monte Carlo studies to investigate the LET distribution in patients have not been undertaken so far, the code is first validated with simulations in water. The code was used in five patients, for each of them three planning and delivery techniques were simulated: passive scattering, three-dimensional modulation IMPT (3D-IMPT), and distal edge tracking IMPT (DET-IMPT).  Results:   The inclusion of secondary particles led to significant differences compared with analytical techniques. In addition, passive scattering and 3D-IMPT led to largely comparable LET distributions, whereas the DET-IMPT plans resulted in considerably increased LET values in normal tissues and critical structures. In the brainstem, dose-averaged LET values exceeding 5 keV/μm were observed in areas with significant dose (>70% of prescribed dose). In noncritical normal tissues, even values >8 keV/μm occurred.  Conclusion:   This work demonstrates that active scanning offers the possibility of influencing the distribution of dose-averaged LET (i.e., the biological effect) without significantly altering the distribution of physical dose. On the basis of this finding, we propose a method to alter deliberately the LET distribution of a treatment plan in such a manner that the LET is maximized within certain target areas and minimized in normal tissues, while maintaining the prescribed target dose and dose constraints for organs at risk.""","""['Clemens Grassberger', 'Alexei Trofimov', 'Anthony Lomax', 'Harald Paganetti']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Reoptimization of Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Plans Based on Linear Energy Transfer.', 'Linear energy transfer-guided optimization in intensity modulated proton therapy: feasibility study and clinical potential.', 'Linear energy transfer incorporated intensity modulated proton therapy optimization.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Imaging issues specific to hadrontherapy (proton, carbon, helium therapy and other charged particles) for radiotherapy planning, setup, dose monitoring and tissue response assessment.', 'Proton linear energy transfer and variable relative biological effectiveness for adolescent patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.', 'Linear Energy Transfer and Relative Biological Effectiveness Investigation of Various Structures for a Cohort of Proton Patients With Brain Tumors.', 'Osteoradionecrosis of the Jaw Following Proton Radiation Therapy for Patients With Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Comparing biological effectiveness guided plan optimization strategies for cranial proton therapy: potential and challenges.', 'Treatment-planning approaches to intensity modulated proton therapy and the impact on dose-weighted linear energy transfer.']"""

Methods and materials:   In this study 296 consecutive men were treated with IMRT for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Most patients received treatment to the prostate with or without proximal seminal vesicles (90%), to a median dose of 76 Gy. Concurrent androgen deprivation therapy was given to 150 men (51%) for a median of 4 months. Late toxicity was defined by Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 as greater than 3 months after radiation therapy completion. Four groupings of DVH parameters were defined, based on the percentage of rectal or bladder tissue receiving 70 Gy (V(70)), 65 Gy (V(65)), and 40 Gy (V(40)). These DVH groupings, as well as clinical and treatment characteristics, were correlated to maximal Grade 2+ GU and GI toxicity.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 41 months, the 4-year freedom from maximal Grade 2+ late toxicity was 81% and 91% for GU and GI systems, respectively, and by last follow-up, the rates of Grade 2+ GU and GI toxicity were 9% and 5%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, whole-pelvic IMRT was associated with Grade 2+ GU toxicity and age was associated with Grade 2+ GI toxicity. Freedom from Grade 2+ GI toxicity at 4 years was 100% for men with rectal V(70) ≤ 10%, V(65) ≤ 20%, and V(40) ≤ 40%; 92% for men with rectal V(70) ≤ 20%, V(65) ≤ 40%, and V(40) ≤ 80%; and 85% for men exceeding these criteria (p = 0.13). These criteria were more highly associated with GI toxicity in men aged ≥70 years (p = 0.07). No bladder dose-volume relationships were associated with the risk of GU toxicity.

Methods and materials:   A total of 165 patients were treated for prostate cancer using external beam radiation therapy up to a dose of 45 Gy, followed by an HDR brachytherapy prostate radiation boost. Between July 1997 and Nov 1999, 64 patients were treated with an HDR boost of 600 cGy × 3 fractions; and between June 2000 and Nov 2005, 101 patients were treated with an HDR boost of 950 cGy × 2 fractions.

Methods:   Data was gathered from annual reports of Macao Cancer Registry of Health Bureau in 2003 - 2007, and demographic statistics of Statistics and Census Bureau Macau SAR Government in 1997 - 2006. Both International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10(th) Revision (ICD-10) were used to classify the diseases and causes of death. Excel 2003 was used for data input and data was analyzed with crude rate, velocity of increase of crude rate and cumulative risk.  Results:   The average crude incidence rate of cancer was 237.2 per 100 000 among the Macao population, with age standardized incidence rate as 194.4 per 100 000;and crude mortality rate as 101.0 per 100 000. Lower gastrointestinal cancer had the highest crude incidence, with the crude incidence rate of prostate cancer rapidly increasing. Respiratory cancer and breast cancer appeared to be the highest crude incidences in both men and women, with the crude mortality rate (25.0 per 100 000) of respiratory cancer the highest. 72.9% of the tumors occurred at the age of 50 and above. However, 81.1% of the tumors occurred at 50 years old and above in men, with the occurrences of tumors of women distributed more evenly. Breast cancer and epithelial tumor commonly occurred in adolescents and young adults while respiratory cancer mostly seen in adulthood and the elderly. Residents were usually diagnosed of cancer at 61.0 years of age and death occurred at 70.5 year old. The prognosis of cancer of men was worse than women's. The worst prognosis of cancer was seen in liver and esophagus, with death occurred within 1 year after diagnosis was made. Breast cancer had the highest cumulative incidence rate, but respiratory cancer had the highest cumulative mortality rate. Both cumulative rates of incidence and mortality in women were lower than in men.  Conclusion:   The increase of crude cancer incidence rate was fast among Macao residents, but relatively slow with crude mortality rate. Respiratory and lower gastrointestinal tumors took the majority while prostate and breast cancer were by no means unimportant, which also called for tertiary prevention.

Cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) are a phytochemical-rich fruit containing a variety of polyphenolic compounds. As flavonoids have been shown to induce apoptosis in human tumor cells, this study investigated the hypothesis that cranberry-mediated cytotoxicity in DU145 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells involves apoptosis. The results showed that induction of apoptosis in these cells occurred in response to treatment with whole cranberry extract and occurred through caspase-8 mediated cleavage of Bid protein to truncated Bid resulting in cytochrome-C release from the mitochondria. Subsequent activation of caspase-9 ultimately resulted in cell death as characterized by DNA fragmentation. Increased Par-4 protein expression was observed, and this is suggested to be at least partly responsible for caspase-8 activation. Proanthocyanidin-enriched and flavonol-enriched fractions of cranberry also increased caspase-8 and caspase-9 activity, suggesting that these compounds play a possible role in apoptosis induction. These findings indicate that cranberry phytochemicals can induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in vitro, and these findings further establish the potential value of cranberry phytochemicals as possible agents against prostate cancer.""","""['Malcolm A MacLean', 'Bradley E Scott', 'Bob A Deziel', 'Melissa C Nunnelley', 'Anne M Liberty', 'Katherine T Gottschall-Pass', 'Catherine C Neto', 'Robert A R Hurta']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nutr Cancer""","""['American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) extract affects human prostate cancer cell growth via cell cycle arrest by modulating expression of cell cycle regulators.', 'Cranberry phytochemical extracts induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells.', 'In vivo inhibition of growth of human tumor lines by flavonoid fractions from cranberry extract.', 'Anticancer activities of cranberry phytochemicals: an update.', 'Cranberries: ripe for more cancer research?', 'Proanthocyanidin-enriched cranberry extract induces resilient bacterial community dynamics in a gnotobiotic mouse model.', ""Prostate apoptosis response-4 and tumor suppression: it's not just about apoptosis anymore."", 'Cranberry extract initiates intrinsic apoptosis in HL-60 cells by increasing BAD activity through inhibition of AKT phosphorylation.', 'Dietary feeding of freeze-dried whole cranberry inhibits intestinal tumor development in Apcmin/+ mice.', 'Effects of cranberry extracts on gene expression in THP-1 cells.']"""

The mean PSA nadir was 0.28 ng/ml. The 114 patients consisted of two groups: 44 patients treated with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (group 1), and 70 patients treated without neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (group 2). The mean PSA nadir achieved in group 1 was 0.19 ng/ml versus 0.34 ng/ml in group 2 (n.s.). The occurrence rates of treatment-related toxicities were similar in both groups.  Conclusion:   In patients with localized prostate cancer, HIFU therapy resulted in comparable immediate cancer control. The present results indicate that combined treatment using hormonal therapy and HIFU does not have a synergistic effect on the PSA nadir.""","""['Yutaka Fujisue', 'Haruhito Azuma', 'Teruo Inamoto', 'Kazumasa Komura', 'Piyush K Agarwal', 'Hiroshi Masuda', 'Toshikazu Watsuji', 'Yoji Katsuoaka']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['The correlation of PSA-nadir PS recurrence after total HIFU-ablation in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Experience with high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy for management of organ-confined prostate cancer: critical evaluation of oncologic outcomes.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound for prostate cancer: comparative definitions of biochemical failure.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: 5-year experience.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   In total, 1,116 prostate cancer patients with known BMI, diagnosed between 2003 and 2006, were identified from the population-based cancer registry held by the Comprehensive Cancer Centre East, The Netherlands. Of these, 504 patients underwent a radical prostatectomy. Patients were categorized as normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2)), or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)). Multivariable proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for age, prediagnostic PSA levels, and pathological characteristics were used to evaluate BMI as a prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Overall, clinical and biopsy characteristics did not significantly differ among BMI groups. Pathological characteristics after radical prostatectomy did not significantly differ among BMI groups, except for tumor stage, which was highest in obese patients (P = 0.017). For patients treated with radical prostatectomy, 5-year risk (95% Confidence Intervals) of biochemical recurrence was 30% (23-37%) for normal weight, 32% (25-39%) for overweight, and 25% (9-41%) for obese patients (log rank P = 0.810). BMI was not an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence in multivariable proportional hazards regression analyses (HR 0.99 per kg/m(2), 95% CI: 0.93-1.06).

Selenomethionine (SeMet), Se-methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys), methylseleninic acid (MeSeA), selenite and selenate in the concentration range 5-100 μM were incubated with cells for 24 h and the induction of cell death was measured using flow cytometry. The amounts of total selenium in cell medium, cell lysate and the insoluble fractions was determined by ICP-MS. Speciation analysis of cellular fractions was performed by reversed phase, anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography and ICP-MS detection. The selenium compounds exhibited large differences in their ability to induce cell death in the three cell lines and the susceptibilities of the cell lines were different. Full recovery of selenium in the cellular fractions was observed for all Se compounds except MeSeA. Speciation analysis showed that MeSeA was completely transformed during the incubations, while metabolic conversion of the other Se compounds was limited.

In this work, several key aspects related to the technology and irradiation techniques necessary to clinically implement this treatment modality are addressed by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The Zubal phantom was used to model a prostate radiotherapy treatment, a challenging site due to the depth of the prostate and the presence of bony structures that must be traversed by the x-ray beam on its way to the target. It is assumed that the concentration levels of the enhancing agent present in the tumor are at or below 10 mg per 1 g of tissue. The Monte Carlo code PENELOPE was used to model a commercial x-ray tube having a tungsten target. X-ray energy spectra for several combinations of peak electron energy and added filtration were obtained. For each energy spectrum, a treatment plan was calculated, with the PENELOPE Monte Carlo code, by modeling the irradiation of the patient as 72 independent conformal beams distributed at intervals of 5° around the phantom in order to model a full x-ray source rotation. The Cimmino optimization algorithm was then used to find the optimum beam weight and energy for different treatment strategies. It is shown that for a target dose prescription of 72 Gy covering the whole tumor, the maximum rectal wall and bladder doses are kept below 52 Gy for the largest concentration of contrast agent of 10 mg per 1 g of tissue. It is also shown that concentrations of as little as 5 mg per 1 g of tissue also render dose distributions with excellent sparing of the organs at risk. A treatment strategy to address the presence of non-uniform distributions of the contrast agent in the target is also modeled and discussed.""","""['H M Garnica-Garza']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A monte carlo comparison of three different media for contrast enhanced radiotherapy of the prostate.', 'Contrast-enhanced radiotherapy: feasibility and characteristics of the physical absorbed dose distribution for deep-seated tumors.', 'Feasibility of external beam radiation therapy to deep-seated targets with kilovoltage x-rays.', 'Monte Carlo modeling of converging small-field contrast-enhanced radiotherapy of prostate.', 'Utilization of the estimating method of patient dose in diagnostic X-rays.', 'Combined Megavoltage and Contrast-Enhanced Radiotherapy as an Intrafraction Motion Management Strategy in Lung SBRT.', 'Nanoscale radiation transport and clinical beam modeling for gold nanoparticle dose enhanced radiotherapy (GNPT) using X-rays.', 'Nanoparticles for Radiation Therapy Enhancement: the Key Parameters.']"""

However, PSA levels are affected by a number of factors apart from neoplasia. Notably, around 40% of the variability of PSA levels in the general population is accounted for by inherited factors, suggesting that it may be possible to improve both sensitivity and specificity by adjusting test results for genetic effects. To search for sequence variants that associate with PSA levels, we performed a genome-wide association study and follow-up analysis using PSA information from 15,757 Icelandic and 454 British men not diagnosed with prostate cancer. Overall, we detected a genome-wide significant association between PSA levels and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at six loci: 5p15.33 (rs2736098), 10q11 (rs10993994), 10q26 (rs10788160), 12q24 (rs11067228), 17q12 (rs4430796), and 19q13.33 [rs17632542 (KLK3: I179T)], each with P(combined) <3 × 10(-10). Among 3834 men who underwent a biopsy of the prostate, the 10q26, 12q24, and 19q13.33 alleles that associate with high PSA levels are associated with higher probability of a negative biopsy (odds ratio between 1.15 and 1.27). Assessment of association between the six loci and prostate cancer risk in 5325 cases and 41,417 controls from Iceland, the Netherlands, Spain, Romania, and the United States showed that the SNPs at 10q26 and 12q24 were exclusively associated with PSA levels, whereas the other four loci also were associated with prostate cancer risk.

Though almost 80% of cases of metastatic PCa present bone metastasis, our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern this metastatic dissemination remains fragmentary. The main objective of the present study was to identify microRNA (miRNA) genes that regulate metastatic PCa.  Experimental design:   miRNA expression profiling was done in human prostate cell lines to identify dysregulated miRNA components of advanced PCa. miR-203 expression was assessed in prostate carcinoma cell lines and clinical specimens by real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. To assess the biological significance of miR-203, miR-203 was reexpressed in bone metastatic PCa cell lines followed by in vitro and in vivo functional assays.  Results:   miR-203 expression is specifically attenuated in bone metastatic PCa suggesting a fundamental antimetastatic role for this miRNA. Reintroduction of miR-203 in bone metastatic PCa cell lines suppresses metastasis via inhibition of several critical steps of the metastatic cascade including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and motility. Ectopic miR-203 significantly attenuated the development of metastasis in a bone metastatic model of PCa. Importantly, miR-203 regulates a cohort of pro-metastatic genes including ZEB2, Bmi, survivin, and bone-specific effectors including Runx2, a master regulator of bone metastasis.

This article asks whether it subverts immunoregulatory pathways governing tumor microenvironments, and has an impact on patient outcome.  Experimental design:   We microdissected epithelium and stroma from cancerous and normal prostate specimens from 126 prostatectomized patients, of whom 76 had received NHT, to detect cytokine/chemokine gene expression levels by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Confocal microscopy was used to identify cytokine/chemokine cell sources, and immunostainings to characterize lymphocyte subsets whose prognostic effects were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analyses.  Results:   NHT boosted the expression of IL-7 in the stroma and that of IFNγ-inducible protein-10/CXCL10 in the glandular epithelium of normal prostate tissue, and restored the CD8(+) lymphocyte depletion occurring in PCa, whereas it significantly increased the CD4(+) lymphocyte infiltrate. Lymphocytes, mostly with CD8(+) phenotype, expressed the T-cell intracellular antigen-1, granzyme-B, and perforin, typical of cytotoxic-effector T cells. NHT also induced thymus and activation-regulated chemokine/CCL17 production by monocytes/macrophages in the prostate and draining lymph nodes, and increased the number of their Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)(+)CD25(+)CD127(-) T regulatory (Treg) cells. The χ(2) test disclosed the lack of association (P = 0.27) between NHT and the high intratumoral CD8(+)/Treg ratio indicative of a good prognosis.  Conclusions:   Androgen withdrawal regulates cytokine/chemokine gene expression in normal prostate and lymphoid tissues, and this probably favors both CD8(+) and Treg infiltrates, leaves their intratumoral balance unchanged, and thus has no impact on disease-free survival.""","""['Carlo Sorrentino', 'Piero Musiani', 'Paolo Pompa', 'Giuseppe Cipollone', 'Emma Di Carlo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Immunomagnetic quantification of circulating tumor cells as a prognostic factor of androgen deprivation responsiveness in patients with hormone naive metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The relationship between proangiogenic gene expression levels in prostate cancer and their prognostic value for clinical outcomes.', 'Effect of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation on circulating prostate cells in the bone marrow of men undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative androgen-deprivation therapy for clinical stage T3 prostate cancer.', 'Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in the management of prostate cancer: a surgical and radiation therapy review.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.', 'First-line pembrolizumab plus androgen deprivation therapy for locally advanced microsatellite instability-high prostate cancer in a patient with Muir-Torre syndrome: A case report.', 'Cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms shaping the immunosuppressive landscape of prostate cancer.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Interleukin-30 suppresses IGF1 and CXCL5 and boosts SOCS3 reducing prostate cancer growth and mortality.', 'Influence of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on the PD-L1 Expression and Immune Activity in Prostate Cancer Tissue.']"""

This study evaluates the effectiveness of bladder-filling instructions in achieving a consistent and reproducible bladder volume at the time of planning CT and daily during the course of radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer. It also assessed the rate of bladder filling before and at the end of radiotherapy.  Methods:   30 men attending for radiation therapy planning for prostate cancer received written and verbal bladder-filling instructions. They had their bladder volume assessed using a bladder ultrasound scanner post-void, immediately prior to planning CT scan and then daily immediately prior to treatment while in the therapy position. The inflow was calculated using the void and full bladder volumes and the time for the bladder to fill.  Results:   The mean bladder volume at the time of planning was 282 ml (range 89-608 ml, standard deviation (SD) = 144.5 ml). This fell during treatment, with a mean value for all treatments of 189 ml (range 11-781 ml, SD = 134 ml). During radiotherapy, 76% (828/1090), 53% (579/1090) and 36% (393/1090) of bladder volumes had >50 ml, >100 ml and >150 ml difference, respectively when compared with their volume at the time of planning.

The role of KLF4 in prostate cancer etiology remains unclear. We have recently reported that small double-stranded RNA can induce gene expression by targeting promoter sequence in a phenomenon referred to as RNA activation (RNAa). In this study, we examine KLF4 levels in prostate cancer tissue and utilize RNAa as a tool for gene overexpression to investigate its function. Expression analysis indicated that KLF4 is significantly downregulated in prostate cancer cell lines compared with nontumorigenic prostate cells. Meta-analysis of existing cDNA microarray data also revealed that KLF4 is frequently depleted in prostate cancer tissue with more pronounced reduction in metastases. In support, tissue microarray analysis of tumors and patient-matched controls indicated downregulation of KLF4 in metastatic tumor samples. Logistic regression analysis found that tumors with a KLF4 staining score less than 5 had a 15-fold higher risk for developing metastatic prostate cancer (P = 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-79.0). In vitro analysis indicated that RNAa-mediated overexpression of KLF4 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival and altered the expression of several downstream cell-cycle-related genes. Ectopic expression of KLF4 via viral transduction recapitulated the RNAa results, validating its inhibitory effects on cancer growth. Reactivation of KLF4 also suppressed migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells. These results suggest that KLF4 functions as an inhibitor of tumor cell growth and migration in prostate cancer and decreased expression has prognostic value for predicting prostate cancer metastasis.""","""['Ji Wang', 'Robert F Place', 'Vera Huang', 'Xiaoling Wang', 'Emily J Noonan', 'Clara E Magyar', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Long-Cheng Li']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Downregulated Krüppel‑like factor\xa04 expression is associated with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic alterations of Krüppel-like factor 4 and its tumor suppressor function in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Absence of myeloid Klf4 reduces prostate cancer growth with pro-atherosclerotic activation of tumor myeloid cells and infiltration of CD8 T cells.', 'Klf4 transcription factor is expressed in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells.', 'Long non-coding RNA LINC00673 silencing inhibits proliferation and drug resistance of prostate cancer cells via decreasing KLF4 promoter methylation.', 'KLF4 targets RAB26 and decreases 5-FU resistance through inhibiting autophagy in colon cancer.', 'KLF4 transcription factor in tumorigenesis.', 'Modulating the expression of tumor suppressor genes using activating oligonucleotide technologies as a therapeutic approach in cancer.', 'Antitumor Activity of Small Activating RNAs Induced PAWR Gene Activation in Human Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'Small Activating RNAs: Towards the Development of New Therapeutic Agents and Clinical Treatments.']"""

Consequently, there is a requirement to establish the effects of vorinostat on tumor growth within bone. Breast (MDA-231) and prostate (PC3) cancer cells were injected into tibias of SCID/NCr mice and the effects of vorinostat on tumor growth and osteolytic disease were assessed by radiography, micro-computed tomography, and histologic and molecular analyses. Vorinostat-treated and control mice without tumors were also examined. Tumor growth in bone was reduced ∼33% by vorinostat with inhibited osteolysis in the first few weeks of the experiment. However, osteolysis became more severe in both the vehicle and vorinostat-treated groups. Vorinostat increased the expression of tumor-derived factors promoting bone resorption, including PTHrP, IL-8, and osteopontin. After 4 weeks of vorinostat therapy, the non-tumor-bearing contralateral femurs and limbs from vorinostat-treated tumor-free SCID mice showed significant bone loss (50% volume density of controls). Thus, our studies indicate that vorinostat effectively inhibits tumor growth in bone, but has a negative systemic effect reducing normal trabecular bone mass.

Our recent results indicated that sodium ionophore monensin is one of the most potent and cancer-specific inhibitors in a systematic sensitivity testing of most known drugs and drug-like molecules in a panel of prostate cancer cell models. Because monensin has been extensively used in veterinary applications to build muscle mass in cattle, the link to prostate cancer and androgen signaling was particularly interesting. Here, we showed that monensin effects at nanomolar concentrations are linked to induction of apoptosis and potent reduction of androgen receptor mRNA and protein in prostate cancer cells. Monensin also elevated intracellular oxidative stress in prostate cancer cells as evidenced by increased generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and by induction of a transcriptional profile characteristic of an oxidative stress response. Importantly, the antiproliferative effects of monensin were potentiated by combinatorial treatment with the antiandrogens and antagonized by antioxidant vitamin C. Taken together, our results suggest monensin as a potential well-tolerated, in vivo compatible drug with strong proapoptotic effects in prostate cancer cells, and synergistic effects with antiandrogens. Moreover, our data suggest a general strategy by which the effects of antiandrogens could be enhanced by combinatorial administration with agents that increase oxidative stress in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Kirsi Ketola', 'Paula Vainio', 'Vidal Fey', 'Olli Kallioniemi', 'Kristiina Iljin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['6-(3,4-Dihydro-1H-isoquinoline-2-yl)-N-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl) nicotinamide-26 (DIMN-26) decreases cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis and downregulation of androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Salinomycin inhibits prostate cancer growth and migration via induction of oxidative stress.', '5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol supports human prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation through androgen receptor-independent signaling pathways: implication of androgen-independent prostate cancer progression.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Investigation of the TLR4 and IRF3 signaling pathway-mediated effects of monensin in colorectal cancer cells.', 'Chemical Interrogation of Nuclear Size Identifies Compounds with Cancer Cell Line-Specific Effects on Migration and Invasion.', ""LRRK2 and idiopathic Parkinson's disease."", 'Targeting Cytoprotective Autophagy to Enhance Anticancer Therapies.', 'Molecular and Functional Links between Neurodevelopmental Processes and Treatment-Induced Neuroendocrine Plasticity in Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Methods:   The VMAT optimization problem is formulated as a large-scale convex programming problem solved by a column generation approach. The authors consider a cost function consisting two terms, the first enforcing a desired dose distribution and the second guaranteeing a smooth dose rate variation between successive gantry angles. A gantry rotation is discretized into 180 beam angles and for each beam angle, only one MLC aperture is allowed. The apertures are generated one by one in a sequential way. At each iteration of the column generation method, a deliverable MLC aperture is generated for one of the unoccupied beam angles by solving a subproblem with the consideration of MLC mechanic constraints. A subsequent master problem is then solved to determine the dose rate at all currently generated apertures by minimizing the cost function. When all 180 beam angles are occupied, the optimization completes, yielding a set of deliverable apertures and associated dose rates that produce a high quality plan.  Results:   The algorithm was preliminarily tested on five prostate and five head-and-neck clinical cases, each with one full gantry rotation without any couch/collimator rotations. High quality VMAT plans have been generated for all ten cases with extremely high efficiency. It takes only 5-8 min on CPU (MATLAB code on an Intel Xeon 2.27 GHz CPU) and 18-31 s on GPU (CUDA code on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card) to generate such plans.

The goal of this work is to develop an enhanced treatment plan evaluation tool which incorporates biological parameters and retains spatial dose information.  Methods:   A software system is developed which provides biological plan evaluation with a novel combination of features. It incorporates hyper-radiosensitivity using the induced-repair model and applies the new concept of dose convolution filter (DCF) to simulate dose wash-out effects due to cell migration, bystander effect, and/or tissue motion during treatment. Further, the concept of spatial DVH (sDVH) is introduced to evaluate and potentially optimize the spatial dose distribution in the target volume. Finally, generalized equivalent uniform dose is derived from both the physical dose distribution (gEUD) and the distribution of equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (gEUD2) and the software provides three separate models for calculation of tumor control probability (TCP), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and probability of uncomplicated tumor control (P+). TCP, NTCP, and P+ are provided as a function of prescribed dose and multivariable TCP, NTCP, and P+ plots are provided to illustrate the dependence on individual parameters used to calculate these quantities. Ten plans from two clinical treatment sites are selected to test the three calculation models provided by this software.  Results:   By retaining both spatial and biological information about the dose distribution, the software is able to distinguish features of radiotherapy treatment plans not discernible using commercial systems. Plans that have similar DVHs may have different spatial and biological characteristics and the application of novel tools such as sDVH and DCF within the software may substantially change the apparent plan quality or predicted plan metrics such as TCP and NTCP. For the cases examined, both the calculation method and the application of DCF can change the ranking order of competing plans. The voxel-by-voxel TCP model makes it feasible to incorporate spatial variations of clonogen densities (n), radiosensitivities (SF2), and fractionation sensitivities (alpha/beta) as those data become available.  Conclusions:   The new software incorporates both spatial and biological information into the treatment planning process. The application of multiple methods for the incorporation of biological and spatial information has demonstrated that the order of application of biological models can change the order of plan ranking. Thus, the results of plan evaluation and optimization are dependent not only on the models used but also on the order in which they are applied. This software can help the planner choose more biologically optimal treatment plans and potentially predict treatment outcome more accurately.""","""['Bo Zhao', 'Michael C Joiner', 'Colin G Orton', 'Jay Burmeister']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Assessment and quantification of patient set-up errors in nasopharyngeal cancer patients and their biological and dosimetric impact in terms of generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD), tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP).', 'Response-probability volume histograms and iso-probability of response charts in treatment plan evaluation.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'The linear-quadratic transformation of dose-volume histograms in fractionated radiotherapy.', 'Voxel-based analysis in radiation oncology: A methodological cookbook.', 'Plan evaluation indices: A journey of evolution.', 'Optimization of radiotherapy fractionation schedules based on radiobiological functions.', 'Three-dimensional dose prediction and validation with the radiobiological gamma index based on a relative seriality model for head-and-neck IMRT.', 'A brachytherapy plan evaluation tool for interstitial applications.']"""

We investigated whether illness intrusiveness differs across life domains among survivors with diverse cancers. Intrusiveness should be highest in activities requiring physical/cognitive functioning (instrumental domain). Intrusiveness into relationship/sexual functioning (intimacy domain) should be higher in prostate, breast, and gastrointestinal cancers than in others.  Methods:   Cancer outpatients (N = 656; 51% men) completed the Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale (IIRS) during follow-up. We compared IIRS Instrumental, Intimacy, and Relationships and Personal Development [RPD] subscale and total scores across gastrointestinal, lung, lymphoma, head and neck, prostate (men), and breast cancers (women), comparing men and women separately.  Results:   Instrumental subscale scores (M(men) = 3.05-3.80, M(women) = 3.02-3.63) were highest for all groups, except prostate cancer. Men with prostate cancer scored higher on Intimacy (M = 3.40) than Instrumental (M = 2.48) or RPD (M = 1.59), p's < .05; their Intimacy scores did not differ from men with gastrointestinal or lung cancer. Women collectively showed higher Instrumental (M = 3.39) than Intimacy (M = 2.49) or RPD scores (M = 2.27), p's < .001, but not the hypothesized group difference in Intimacy.  Conclusions:   Post-treatment survivors continue to experience some long-term interference with activities requiring physical and cognitive functioning. Sexual adjustment may be of special concern to men when treatments involve genitourinary functioning.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Ongoing monitoring with the IIRS to detect lifestyle interference throughout survivorship may enhance quality of life.

Gap junctions composed of Cxs have an essential role in intercellular communication, adhesion and cell differentiation. Several studies investigated the role of connexin43 (Cx43) in different carcinomas; however, none investigated its prognostic role in prostate cancer. Cx43 expression and relationship with established prognostic features were assessed in a cohort of 102 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma. Cx43 expression in prostate cancer was significantly associated with established features indicative of worse prognosis, such as follow-up time (P < 0.001) and preoperative PSA (P < 0.007). Patients with lower Cx43 expressions in tumours have shorter follow-up time, which indicated shorter disease-free survival and higher preoperative PSA values. Furthermore, tumours with positive surgical margins (P < 0.001) showed significantly lower Cx43 expression compared with tumours without this feature. In univariate (P < 0.001) and multivariate (P = 0.014) analyses, decreased Cx43 expression was found to be a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence free-survival. Study results show the association of decreased Cx43 expression with prostate cancer progression. Moreover, Cx43 could serve as an additional prognostic marker and used together with traditional prognostic markers might help in further stratifying the risk of disease progression in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['G Benko', 'B Spajić', 'A Demirović', 'G Stimac', 'B Kru Sbreve Lin', 'D Tomas']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Expression and prognostic role of syndecan-2 in prostate cancer.', 'Lymphovascular invasion is an independent prognostic factor in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Preoperative PSA level significantly associated with interval to biochemical progression after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic markers in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Connexins, important players in the dissemination of prostate cancer cells.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition: The history, regulatory mechanism, and cancer therapeutic opportunities.', 'Expression of NEDD9 and connexin-43 in neoplastic and stromal cells of gastric adenocarcinoma.', 'Cx43 Present at the Leading Edge Membrane Governs Promigratory Effects of Osteoblast-Conditioned Medium on Human Prostate Cancer Cells in the Context of Bone Metastasis.', 'Direct Intercellular Communications and Cancer: A Snapshot of the Biological Roles of Connexins in Prostate Cancer.', 'Facets of Communication: Gap Junction Ultrastructure and Function in Cancer Stem Cells and Tumor Cells.']"""

Both receptors are expressed in human prostate tissue and have different action profiles. ERalpha is positively correlated with the malignancy of prostate cancer, while ERbeta may protect against abnormal prostate cell growth. 17β-Estradiol (E2), at least in part, induces cancerous transformations by causing deleterious mutations through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim was to study the effect of E2 on oxidative stress and the expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and antioxidant enzymes in several prostate cancer cell lines with different ERalpha/ERbeta ratios. The cell prostate lines with a lower ERalpha/ERbeta ratio had lower oxidative stress, which could be partially explained by the increased expression of antioxidant enzymes and UCPs. Moreover, the action of E2 on the expression of antioxidant enzymes and UCPs was dual and dependent on the ERalpha/ERbeta ratio. Treatments with 0.1 nM E2 in cell lines with high ERalpha/ERbeta ratio produced a decrease in antioxidant enzymes and UCPs levels, with an increase in ROS production. These effects disappeared when the treatment was done in the presence of an ERalpha antagonist (MPP). In the cell lines with greatest levels of ERbeta and the lowest ERalpha/ERbeta ratio, E2 treatment caused the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes and UCPs with a look-up decrease in ROS production. These effects were reversed when the cells were treated with E2 in the presence of an ERbeta antagonist (R,R-THC). On the whole, our results suggest a dual E2 effect; increasing or decreasing oxidative stress in part by modulation of UCPs and antioxidant enzymes according to the abundance ERbeta and ERalpha/ERbeta ratio in prostate cancer cell lines.""","""['A M Miró', 'J Sastre-Serra', 'D G Pons', 'A Valle', 'P Roca', 'J Oliver']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['The ERalpha/ERbeta ratio determines oxidative stress in breast cancer cell lines in response to 17beta-estradiol.', 'Genistein modulates oxidative stress in breast cancer cell lines according to ERα/ERβ ratio: effects on mitochondrial functionality, sirtuins, uncoupling protein 2 and antioxidant enzymes.', 'ERβ-dependent neuroglobin up-regulation impairs 17β-estradiol-induced apoptosis in DLD-1 colon cancer cells upon oxidative stress injury.', 'Xenoestrogen regulation of ERα/ERβ balance in hormone-associated cancers.', 'Role of estrogen receptor alpha and beta expression and signaling on cognitive function during aging.', 'Estrogen Receptor β Participates in Alternariol-Induced Oxidative Stress in Normal Prostate Epithelial Cells.', 'Micronutrients Selenomethionine and Selenocysteine Modulate the Redox Status of MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Sexual hormones regulate the redox status and mitochondrial function in the brain.

BTG2 bearing the mutant (20)LxxLL(24) motif bound to AR equally efficient as the wild-type BTG2, while BTG2 bearing the mutant (92)LxxLL(96) motif failed to interact with AR. Functional studies indicated that ectopic expression of BTG2 caused a significant inhibition of AR-mediated transcriptional activity and a decreased growth of prostate cancer cells.

This study was undertaken to determine the factors influencing the current use of ADT after PORT amongst Canadian radiation oncologists.  Methods:   An institutional survey was emailed to the Genito-urinary Radiation Oncologists Group of Canada (GUROC), designed to assess the likelihood of prescribing ADT in early and delayed PORT scenarios with variations in disease prognosticators. Analysis used descriptive statistics.  Results:   Majority (94%) do not routinely advocate ADT with PORT. With early PORT and undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA), respondents (n = 53) indicated that Gleason Score 8-10 (89%), pT3b disease (80%) and high risk D'Amico category (76%) were important considerations. With early PORT and a detectible PSA, important considerations were PSA doubling time (90%), high risk disease (85%), pT3b category (82%) and time to relapse (TTR) of < 3 months (90%). Similar patterns were observed in the context of delayed PORT with importance given to TTR and PSA velocity. Category pT3b was consistently perceived as a poor prognosticator. The majority of respondents prescribe ADT for > 6 months (72%) or > 24 month (48%).  Conclusions:   Wide variation was identified among respondents in the importance given to pathological, clinical and biochemical parameters and in considering therapy duration when prescribing ADT with PORT.

Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a retrovirus that has been the subject of intense debate since its detection in samples from humans with prostate cancer (PC) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Controversy has arisen from the failure of some studies to detect XMRV in PC or CFS patients and from inconsistent detection of XMRV in healthy controls.  Results:   Here we demonstrate that Taqman PCR primers previously described as XMRV-specific can amplify common murine endogenous viral sequences from mouse suggesting that mouse DNA can contaminate patient samples and confound specific XMRV detection. To consider the provenance of XMRV we sequenced XMRV from the cell line 22Rv1, which is infected with an MLV-X that is indistinguishable from patient derived XMRV. Bayesian phylogenies clearly show that XMRV sequences reportedly derived from unlinked patients form a monophyletic clade with interspersed 22Rv1 clones (posterior probability >0.99). The cell line-derived sequences are ancestral to the patient-derived sequences (posterior probability >0.99). Furthermore, pol sequences apparently amplified from PC patient material (VP29 and VP184) are recombinants of XMRV and Moloney MLV (MoMLV) a virus with an envelope that lacks tropism for human cells. Considering the diversity of XMRV we show that the mean pairwise genetic distance among env and pol 22Rv1-derived sequences exceeds that of patient-associated sequences (Wilcoxon rank sum test: p = 0.005 and p < 0.001 for pol and env, respectively). Thus XMRV sequences acquire diversity in a cell line but not in patient samples. These observations are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that published XMRV sequences are related by a process of infectious transmission.  Conclusions:   We provide several independent lines of evidence that XMRV detected by sensitive PCR methods in patient samples is the likely result of PCR contamination with mouse DNA and that the described clones of XMRV arose from the tumour cell line 22Rv1, which was probably infected with XMRV during xenografting in mice.

We suspected that the kit itself might have been contaminated with small traces of endogenous MLV genome or XMRV and attempted to evaluate the quality of the kit in two independent laboratories. We purchased four one-step RT-PCR kits from Invitrogen, TaKaRa, Promega and QIAGEN in Japan. To amplify the partial gag gene of XMRV or other MLV-related viruses, primer sets (419F and 1154R, and GAG-I-F and GAG-I-R) which have been widely used in XMRV studies were employed. The nucleotide sequences of the amplicons were determined and compared with deposited sequences of a polytropic endogenous MLV (PmERV), XMRV and endogenous MLV-related viruses derived from CFS patients. We found that the enzyme mixtures of the one-step RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen were contaminated with RNA derived from PmERV. The nucleotide sequence of a partial gag region of the contaminant amplified by RT-PCR was nearly identical (99.4% identity) to a PmERV on chromosome 7 and highly similar (96.9 to 97.6%) to recently identified MLV-like viruses derived from CFS patients. We also determined the nucleotide sequence of a partial env region of the contaminant and found that it was almost identical (99.6%) to the PmERV.

A more recent study indicated that this infectious retrovirus can be detected in 67% of patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), but only very few healthy controls (4%). However, several groups have published to date that they could not identify XMRV RNA or DNA sequences in other cohorts of CFS patients, while another group detected murine leukemia virus (MLV)-like sequences in 87% of such patients, but only 7% of healthy controls. Since there is a high degree of similarity between XMRV and abundant endogenous MLV proviruses, it is important to distinguish contaminating mouse sequences from true infections.  Results:   DNA from the peripheral blood of 112 CFS patients and 36 healthy controls was tested for XMRV with two different PCR assays. A TaqMan qPCR assay specific for XMRV pol sequences was able to detect viral DNA from 2 XMRV-infected cells (~ 10-12 pg DNA) in up to 5 μg of human genomic DNA, but yielded negative results in the test of 600 ng genomic DNA from 100,000 peripheral blood cells of all samples tested. However, positive results were obtained with some of these samples, using a less specific nested PCR assay for a different XMRV sequence. DNA sequencing of the PCR products revealed a wide variety of virus-related sequences, some identical to those found in prostate cancer and CFS patients, others more closely related to known endogenous MLVs. However, all samples that tested positive for XMRV and/or MLV DNA were also positive for the highly abundant intracisternal A-type particle (IAP) long terminal repeat and most were positive for murine mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase sequences. No contamination was observed in any of the negative control samples, containing those with no DNA template, which were included in each assay.  Conclusions:   Mouse cells contain upwards of 100 copies each of endogenous MLV DNA. Even much less than one cell's worth of DNA can yield a detectable product using highly sensitive PCR technology. It is, therefore, vital that contamination by mouse DNA be monitored with adequately sensitive assays in all samples tested.""","""['Brendan Oakes', 'Albert K Tai', 'Oya Cingöz', 'Madeleine H Henefield', 'Susan Levine', 'John M Coffin', 'Brigitte T Huber']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Retrovirology""","""['Multiple sources of contamination in samples from patients reported to have XMRV infection.', 'An endogenous murine leukemia viral genome contaminant in a commercial RT-PCR kit is amplified using standard primers for XMRV.', 'No evidence of murine-like gammaretroviruses in CFS patients previously identified as XMRV-infected.', 'Distribution of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) infection in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'Lack of evidence for a role of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and/or chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Characterization of a new case of XMLV (Bxv1) contamination in the human cell line Hep2 (clone 2B).', 'Fake Science: XMRV, COVID-19, and the Toxic Legacy of Dr. Judy Mikovits.', 'A trip down memory lane with Retrovirology.', 'Murine Endogenous Retroviruses Are Detectable in Patient-Derived Xenografts but Not in Patient-Individual Cell Lines of Human Colorectal Cancer.', 'Transmission, Evolution, and Endogenization: Lessons Learned from Recent Retroviral Invasions.']"""

This virus has been identified in the US in prostate cancer patients and in those with chronic fatigue syndrome. However, with the exception of two patients in Germany, XMRV has not been identified in prostate cancer tissue in Europe. Most putative associations of new or old human retroviruses with diseases have turned out to be due to contamination. We have looked for XMRV sequences in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin- embedded prostate tissues. To control for contamination, PCR assays to detect either mouse mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or intracisternal A particle (IAP) long terminal repeat DNA were run on all samples, owing to their very high copy number in mouse cells.  Results:   In general agreement with the US prevalence, XMRV-like sequences were found in 4.8% of prostate cancers. However, these were also positive, as were 21.5% of XMRV-negative cases, for IAP sequences, and many, but not all were positive for mtDNA sequences.  Conclusions:   These results show that contamination with mouse DNA is widespread and detectable by the highly sensitive IAP assay, but not always with less sensitive assays, such as murine mtDNA PCR.

Nonetheless, the expression status and functional significance of IKBKE in human glioma remain unexplored. For the first time, we have demonstrated that mRNA and protein levels of IKBKE were robustly up-regulated in glioma cell lines and human primary glioma tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that 53.5% (38/71) paraffin-embedded archived glioma specimens exhibited high levels of IKBKE expression. Intriguingly, there was no significant difference in IKBKE expression among different grades of glioma. To understand the biological function of IKBKE in the development and progression of human glioma, glioma cells lines ectopically over-expressing IKBKE were established and tested for their responsiveness to apoptotic inducers. Our data showed that IKBKE over-expression inhibited cell apoptosis induced by UV irradiation or adriamycin and, in contrast, shRNAi-mediated suppression of IKBKE increased the sensitivity of glioma cells to the apoptotic inducers. Importantly, we found that up-regulated IKBKE could induce the expression of Bcl-2 through activating NF-κB signalling, and that, specifically, we identified IκB as a critical component for this signalling cascade. The current study suggests that up-regulation of IKBKE may represent an important molecular hallmark that is biologically and clinically relevant to the development and progression, as well as the chemo- and radio-resistance, of the disease.""","""['Hongyu Guan', 'Heng Zhang', 'Junchao Cai', 'Jueheng Wu', 'Jie Yuan', 'Jun Li', 'Zhengsong Huang', 'Mengfeng Li']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['Tumor necrosis factor-alpha induces the expression of DR6, a member of the TNF receptor family, through activation of NF-kappaB.', ""Rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) inhibits the constitutive nuclear factor-{kappa}B signaling pathway in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B-cell lines: role in sensitization to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis."", 'The function of multiple IkappaB : NF-kappaB complexes in the resistance of cancer cells to Taxol-induced apoptosis.', 'Transcriptional regulation of pro-apoptotic Par-4 by NF-kappaB/p65 and its function in controlling cell kinetics during early events in endometrial tumourigenesis.', 'Advances in IKBKE as a potential target for cancer therapy.', 'Multilevel proteomic analyses reveal molecular diversity between diffuse-type and intestinal-type gastric cancer.', 'The role of TBK1 in cancer pathogenesis and anticancer immunity.', 'Hippo Pathway in Regulating Drug Resistance of Glioblastoma.', 'CYT387, a potent IKBKE inhibitor, suppresses human glioblastoma progression by activating the Hippo pathway.', 'Modular network mechanism of CCN1-associated resistance to HSV-1-derived oncolytic immunovirotherapies for glioblastomas.']"""

We therefore investigated whether butein, a tetrahydroxychalcone, could inhibit RANKL signaling and suppress osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL or tumor cells. We found that human multiple myeloma cells (MM.1S and U266), breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231) and prostate tumor cells (PC-3) induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts, as indicated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells, and that butein suppressed this process. The chalcone also suppressed the expression of RANKL by the tumor cells. We further found that butein suppressed RANKL-induced NF-κB activation and that this suppression correlated with the inhibition of IκBα kinase and suppression of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB. Finally, butein also suppressed the RANKL-induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner.

Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the human breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer cell lines examined expressed moderate levels of surface ICAM-1 and DAF, whilst a normal breast cell line expressed only minimal levels. When CVA21 was combined with doxorubicin hydrochloride, synergistically enhanced cell death was observed when CVA21 was administered both simultaneously or 24 h prior to doxorubicin hydrochloride exposure. Doxorubicin hydrochloride had no effect on CVA21 replication. Through the use of an orthotopic (MDA-MB-231-luc) xenograft SCID mouse model of human breast cancer we showed that a single intravenous injection of CVA21 in combination with an intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin hydrochloride resulted in significantly greater tumor reduction compared to either agent alone. Overall, these findings highlight the exciting potential of CVA21, administered in combination with doxorubicin hydrochloride, as a new therapeutic regimen for cancer.""","""['Kathryn A Skelding', 'Richard D Barry', 'Darren R Shafren']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Systemic targeting of metastatic human breast tumor xenografts by Coxsackievirus A21.', 'Potent oncolytic activity of human enteroviruses against human prostate cancer.', 'Oncolysis of vascular malignant human melanoma tumors by Coxsackievirus A21.', 'Applications of coxsackievirus A21 in oncology.', 'Oncolytic coxsackievirus therapy as an immunostimulator.', 'Engineering Oncolytic Coxsackievirus A21 with Small Transgenes and Enabling Cell-Mediated Virus Delivery by Integrating Viral cDNA into the Genome.', 'Combining Oncolytic Viruses and Small Molecule Therapeutics: Mutual Benefits.', 'Immuno-Oncolytic Viruses: Emerging Options in the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.', 'The Interaction of Viruses with the Cellular Senescence Response.', 'Application of Viral Vectors for Vaccine Development with a Special Emphasis on COVID-19.']"""

Methods:   We studied low-income, uninsured men in IMPACT, a state-funded public assistance program, who had died since its inception in 2001. Of the 60 men who died, we included the 35 who completed a spirituality questionnaire at program enrollment. We abstracted sociodemographic and clinical information as well as treatment within IMPACT, including zolendroic acid, chemotherapy, hospice use, and palliative radiation therapy. We measured spirituality with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being questionnaire (FACIT-Sp) and compared end-of-life care received between subjects with low and high FACIT-Sp scores using chi-squared analyses.  Results:   A higher proportion of men with high (33%) versus low (13%) spirituality scores enrolled in hospice, although our analysis was not adequately powered to demonstrate statistical significance. Likewise, we saw a trend toward increased receipt of palliative radiation among those with higher spirituality (37% vs. 25%, P=0.69). The differences in end-of-life care received among those with low and high spirituality varied little by the FACIT-Sp peace and faith subscales.

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a family of PPARγ activators and type 2 anti-diabetic drugs, exhibit anti-tumor apoptotic effects in human PCa cell lines. Likewise, pharmacological inhibitors of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a metabolic enzyme highly expressed in PCa, induce apoptosis in prostate and other cancer cells. Here, we show positive correlation between PPARγ and FASN protein in PCa cell lines and synergism between TZDs and FASN blockers in PCa cell viability reduction and apoptosis induction. Combined TZDs/FASN has enhanced anti-tumor properties in both androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent PC-3 and DU-145 cells when compared with single drug exposure. Low concentrations (5-10 μM) of the TZD drug rosiglitazone failed to alter cell viability but, paradoxically, upregulated lipogenic genes [PPARγ, FASN, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and acetyl-Co A carboxylase-1 (ACC1)], which diminish the apoptotic effects of rosiglitazone. The mean IC50 in all cell lines was 45 ± 2 μM for rosiglitazone compared with significantly lower 5 ± 1 μM for rosiglitazone plus the FASN blocker cerulenin, and 10.2 ± 2 μM for rosiglitazone plus the cerulenin synthetic analog C75. The IC50 for the combined rosiglitazone and FASN blockers contrasts with the relatively higher IC50 for rosiglitazone (45 ± 2 μM), the TZD drug troglitazone (13 ± 2 μM), cerulenin (32 ± 1 μM), or C75 (26 ± 3 μM) when these drugs were used alone.

These findings have led to increased concern for the over detection and overtreatment of prostate cancer. Active surveillance for prostate cancer allows one to limit prostate cancer treatment with concomitant risks of treatment-related morbidity to the men who will benefit the most from aggressive therapies. Several tools have been developed in treated and surveyed men to assist physicians in selecting men with potentially indolent tumors amenable to active surveillance. Recent published results describe institutional experiences with active surveillance and delayed selective therapy for men with low-grade, early prostate cancer. Although median follow-up from these studies is relatively short, the outcomes appear favorable. Data from these reports provide information for selecting men for this approach, as well as for following them over time and determining triggers for further intervention.

Celastrol induces apoptosis by means of proteasome inhibition and suppresses prostate tumor growth. However, the detailed mechanism of action remains elusive. In the current study, we aim to test the hypothesis that celastrol suppresses AIPC progression via inhibiting the constitutive NF-κB activity as well as modulating the Bcl-2 family proteins.  Methodology/principal findings:   We examined the efficacy of celastrol both in vitro and in vivo, and evaluated the role of NF-κB in celastrol-mediated AIPC regression. We found that celastrol inhibited cell proliferation in all three AIPC cell lines (PC-3, DU145 and CL1), with IC₅₀ in the range of 1-2 µM. Celastrol also suppressed cell migration and invasion. Celastrol significantly induced apoptosis as evidenced by increased sub-G1 population, caspase activation and PARP cleavage. Moreover, celastrol promoted cleavage of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and activated the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa. In addition, celastrol rapidly blocked cytosolic IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation of RelA. Likewise, celastrol inhibited the expression of multiple NF-κB target genes that are involved in proliferation, invasion and anti-apoptosis. Celastrol suppressed AIPC tumor progression by inhibiting proliferation, increasing apoptosis and decreasing angiogenesis, in PC-3 xenograft model in nude mouse. Furthermore, increased cellular IκBα and inhibited expression of various NF-κB target genes were observed in tumor tissues.  Conclusions/significance:   Our data suggest that, via targeting the proteasome, celastrol suppresses proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis by inducing the apoptotic machinery and attenuating constitutive NF-κB activity in AIPC both in vitro and in vivo. Celastrol as an active ingredient of traditional herbal medicine could thus be developed as a new therapeutic agent for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.""","""['Yao Dai', 'Jeffrey Desano', 'Wenhua Tang', 'Xiaojie Meng', 'Yang Meng', 'Ezra Burstein', 'Theodore S Lawrence', 'Liang Xu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Celastrol, a novel triterpene, potentiates TNF-induced apoptosis and suppresses invasion of tumor cells by inhibiting NF-kappaB-regulated gene products and TAK1-mediated NF-kappaB activation.', 'Celastrol, a triterpene extracted from the Chinese ""Thunder of God Vine,"" is a potent proteasome inhibitor and suppresses human prostate cancer growth in nude mice.', 'Betulinic Acid-Mediated Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer Cells Involves p53 and Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Pathways.', 'Celastrol as an emerging anticancer agent: Current status, challenges and therapeutic strategies.', 'Targeting inflammatory pathways by triterpenoids for prevention and treatment of cancer.', 'Evolution of Natural Product Scaffolds as Potential Proteasome Inhibitors in Developing Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Induction of the ER stress response in NRVMs is linked to cardiotoxicity caused by celastrol.', 'Terpenoids as Potential Geroprotectors.', 'Natural Compounds in Prostate Cancer Prevention and Treatment: Mechanisms of Action and Molecular Targets.', 'Natural Plants Compounds as Modulators of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.']"""

Stable lentivirus short hairpin interfering RNA-mediated depletion of RalA and RalBP1 in PC3 human prostate cancer cells inhibited bone metastasis after intracardiac inoculation. Depletion of RalBP1 diminished orthotopic tumor growth of PC3 cells and inhibited spontaneous metastasis from this site. Interestingly, the expression of wild-type or RalA mutants deficient in RalBP1 binding was effective at rescuing the reduced metastatic capacity of RalA-depleted PC3 cells, suggesting that RalA depletion does not reduce this solely by diminished interaction with RalBP1. To determine whether the role of RalBP1 in metastasis is relevant beyond prostate cancer, we studied the requirement of RalBP1 expression in an experimental metastasis model of human bladder cancer, a tumor type with high RalBP1 expression. Depletion of RalBP1 in UMUC3 cells resulted in decreased lung colonization while having a minimal effect on subcutaneous tumor growth.

Fusion of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 promoter to the ERG oncogene results in constitutive high level expression of ERG which promotes prostate cancer invasion and proliferation. Here, we report the characterization of multiple alternatively spliced T/E fusion gene isoforms which have differential effects on invasion and proliferation. We found that T/E fusion gene isoforms differentially increase NF-κB-mediated transcription, which may explain in part the differences in biological activities of the T/E fusion isoforms. This increased activity is due to phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 on Ser536. Tissue microarray immunochemistry revealed that p65 phospho-Ser536 is present in the majority of prostate cancers where it is associated with ERG protein expression. The T/E fusion gene isoforms differentially increase expression of a number of NF-κB associated genes including PAR1, CCL2, FOS, TLR3, and TLR4 (Toll-like receptor). TLR4 activation is known to promote p65 Ser536 phosphorylation and knockdown of TLR4 with shRNA decreases Ser536 phosphorylation in T/E fusion gene expressing cells. TLR4 can be activated by proteins in the tumor microenvironment and lipopolysacharide from Gram (-) bacteria.

FUS has recently been shown to be recruited by noncoding RNAs to the regulatory regions of target genes such as cyclin D1, in which it represses transcription by disrupting complex formation. Here we show that FUS has some characteristics of a putative tumor suppressor, as its overexpression promoted growth inhibition and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, whereas its knockdown increased cell proliferation. This effect was reproducible in vivo, such that increasing FUS levels in tumor xenografts led to dramatic tumor regression. Furthermore, FUS promoted conditions that favored cell-cycle arrest by reducing the levels of proliferative factors such as cyclin D1 and Cdk6 and by increasing levels of the antiproliferative Cdk inhibitor p27. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that FUS expression is inversely correlated with Gleason grade, demonstrating that patients with high levels of FUS survived longer and were less likely to have bone metastases, suggesting that loss of FUS expression may contribute to cancer progression.

Methods:   Use cases were developed followed by infrastructure and content application. The program was provided on a personal desktop computer with a touch screen monitor. Participant responses to the query component of P3P determined the content of the multimedia educational and coaching intervention. The intervention was tailored to race, age, and personal factors reported as influencing the decision. Prepilot usability testing was conducted using a ""think aloud"" interview to identify navigation and content challenges. These issues were addressed prior to deployment in the clinic.

Results:   Prepilot testing included 4 men with a past diagnosis of LPC who had completed therapy. Technical navigation issues were documented along with confusing content language. A total of 30 additional men with a recent diagnosis of LPC completed the P3P program in clinic prior to consulting with a urologist regarding treatment options.

Growth in prostate cancer spending continues to outpace that for overall health expenditures, garnering nearly $7 billion annually.  Methods:   We identified patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 2003 using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data. Patients were sorted into 12 cohorts based on their diagnosis year. We price-adjusted and tallied all prostate cancer-related Medicare payments for the first 2 years after diagnosis. We characterized the impact of a service by quantifying its contribution to the variation of per capita spending over time. We further assessed whether leading services contributed to spending growth by price or usage.  Results:   Per capita Medicare expenditures increased by 20% from $8933 to $10,734. Decreases in inpatient expenditures ($3499 to $1504, P value for trend <.001) were offset by growth in physician spending ($3317-$6062, P value for trend <.001). Androgen deprivation (41.6%) and radiation therapy (19.9%) accounted for the majority of spending growth through increases in quantity. Depending on the service, quantity, as opposed to price, was responsible for 59.0% to 76.4% of the observed spending growth.  Conclusions:   Medicare spending for prostate cancer care increased by 20% and was fueled by increasing usage of physician services, including androgen deprivation and radiation therapy. Payment reform and bolstering the evidence base can potentially improve the efficiency of prostate cancer care.""","""['Yun Zhang', 'Ted A Skolarus', 'David C Miller', 'John T Wei', 'Brent K Hollenbeck']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Area-level variations in cancer care and outcomes.', 'Long-term medical-care costs related to prostate cancer: estimates from linked SEER-Medicare data.', 'The economic burden of prostate cancer, California, 1998.', 'Issues in health care: interventional pain management at the crossroads.', 'Medicare in interventional pain management: A critical analysis.', 'Significant financial differences of chemical and surgical androgen deprivation in a contemporary cohort.', 'Innovative Diagnostic Methods for Early Prostate Cancer Detection through Urine Analysis: A Review.', 'Risk factors for metastatic prostate cancer: A sentinel event case series.', 'New serum biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Effects of androgen deprivation on cerebral morphometry in prostate cancer patients--an exploratory study.']"""

The main limitation in contemporary brachytherapy is faulty seed placement, predominantly due to the presence of intra-operative edema (tissue expansion). Though currently not available, the capability to intra-operatively monitor the seed distribution, can make a significant improvement in cancer control. We present such a system here.  Methods:   Intra-operative measurement of edema in prostate brachytherapy requires localization of inserted radioactive seeds relative to the prostate. Seeds were reconstructed using a typical non-isocentric C-arm, and exported to a commercial brachytherapy treatment planning system. Technical obstacles for 3D reconstruction on a non-isocentric C-arm include pose-dependent C-arm calibration; distortion correction; pose estimation of C-arm images; seed reconstruction; and C-arm to TRUS registration.  Results:   In precision-machined hard phantoms with 40-100 seeds and soft tissue phantoms with 45-87 seeds, we correctly reconstructed the seed implant shape with an average 3D precision of 0.35 mm and 0.24 mm, respectively. In a DoD Phase-1 clinical trial on six patients with 48-82 planned seeds, we achieved intra-operative monitoring of seed distribution and dosimetry, correcting for dose inhomogeneities by inserting an average of over four additional seeds in the six enrolled patients (minimum 1; maximum 9). Additionally, in each patient, the system automatically detected intra-operative seed migration induced due to edema (mean 3.84 mm, STD 2.13 mm, Max 16.19 mm).  Conclusions:   The proposed system is the first of a kind that makes intra-operative detection of edema (and subsequent re-optimization) possible on any typical non-isocentric C-arm, at negligible additional cost to the existing clinical installation. It achieves a significantly more homogeneous seed distribution, and has the potential to affect a paradigm shift in clinical practice.

Materials and methods:   In MDA-MB-231 breast and PC3 prostate cancer cells, mRNA levels were analyzed by real-time PCR and protein expressions were assessed by flow cytometry or western blot. Caspase-8 and -3 levels, cell size, and changes in nuclear morphology were recorded using the ArrayScan microscope and 84 apoptosis-related genes were screened with the RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array.  Results:   In serum starved MDA-MB-231 cells, a TF/FVIIa-sensitive upregulation of apoptosis markers was recorded. Similarly, TRAIL-induced apoptosis was negatively regulated by TF/FVIIa (10 and 100 nM) and TF/FVIIa/FXa but not by active-site inhibited FVIIa. FVIIa, moreover, decreased the transcription of DAPK1 and thereby diminished the association between DAPK1 and FADD in the caspase-8 activating death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). TF/FVIIa regulation of caspase-8 and DAPK1 was dependent on PI3-kinase/AKT and independent of the protease activated receptors (PAR) 1 and 2. Despite of receptor expression and functional signaling, both PAR-agonist treatment and PAR-blocking antibodies in combination with FVIIa failed to influence the anti-apoptotic signal.  Conclusions:   We hereby report that TF/FVIIa-induced signaling governs the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis by reducing the levels of DAPK1 in the DISC independently of PAR1 and PAR2. This implies the conceivable involvement of cell surface components other than the PARs and entails the search for TF-dependent regulators of DAPK1 transcription.""","""['M Aberg', 'M Johnell', 'M Wickström', 'A Siegbahn']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Thromb Res""","""['Simvastatin induces apoptosis in human breast cancer cells in a NFkappaB-dependent manner and abolishes the anti-apoptotic signaling of TF/FVIIa and TF/FVIIa/FXa.', 'Formation of tissue factor-factor VIIa-factor Xa complex induces activation of the mTOR pathway which regulates migration of human breast cancer cells.', 'Formation of tissue factor-factor VIIa-factor Xa complex promotes cellular signaling and migration of human breast cancer cells.', 'Microarray studies of factor VIIa-activated cancer cells.', 'Emerging insights in tissue factor-dependent signaling events.', 'Tissue factor (coagulation factor III): a potential double-edge molecule to be targeted and re-targeted toward cancer.', 'The Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan Syndecan-1 Triggers Breast Cancer Cell-Induced Coagulability by Induced Expression of Tissue Factor.', 'The Tissue Factor Pathway in Cancer: Overview and Role of Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans.', 'Tissue factor as a new target for tumor therapy-killing two birds with one stone: a narrative review.', 'Activation of PAR2 by tissue factor induces the release of the PTEN from MAGI proteins and regulates PTEN and Akt activities.']"""

Detection bias arising from higher PSA screening rates among statin users vs. non-users could produce an inverse association for advanced disease. Thus, we conducted simulations to assess whether this source of bias is explanatory.  Methods:   3000 datasets with 100,000 men without prostate cancer were simulated for populations with high (65%) or low (15%) PSA screening. We investigated three scenarios: RR(true)=1.0, 0.75, and 0.5 for statins and advanced disease (1.0 for localized). We set the statin prevalence to 10% and varied the percentage of users who were PSA screened (0-100%). We assumed an annual total prostate cancer incidence of 1%, with risk in screened men twice that of unscreened men, and an advanced stage at diagnosis in 20% and 40% of cases in screened and unscreened men, respectively.  Results:   As PSA screening and statin use became more coincident, the RR(observed) for local and total prostate cancer was biased upward from the RR(true) of 1.0, especially when the prevalence of PSA screening was low. However, in all simulated scenarios, there was little downward bias for advanced disease (e.g., if RR(true)=1.0 and 70% of statin users and either 65% or 15% of the population overall was PSA screened, then RR(observed)=0.98 for both).  Conclusions:   Given our assumptions, this simulation suggests that this source of detection bias is unlikely to explain the reported inverse association between statins and advanced prostate cancer, but may explain the positive association for total prostate cancer that has been reported in some studies.""","""['Alison M Mondul', 'Brian Caffo', 'Elizabeth A Platz']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Statin use and risk of prostate cancer and high-grade prostate cancer: results from the REDUCE study.', 'Outcomes of Screening for Prostate Cancer Among Men Who Use Statins.', 'Statin drugs, serum cholesterol, and prostate-specific antigen in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2004.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence-Based Analysis.', 'Prostate cancer association studies: pitfalls and solutions to cancer misclassification in the PSA era.', 'Longer-term Lipid-lowering Drug Use and Risk of Incident and Fatal Prostate Cancer in Black and White Men in the ARIC Study.', 'The current evidence on statin use and prostate cancer prevention: are we there yet?', 'Statin Use in Prostate Cancer: An Update.', 'LDL-lowering therapy and the risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials and 36 observational studies.', 'Statin use and risk of prostate cancer: Results from the Southern Community Cohort Study.']"""

Methods and materials:   The plans of 8 patients with HRPCa treated with HT were compared with IMPT plans with two quasilateral fields set up (-100°; 100°) and optimized with the Hyperion treatment planning system. Both techniques were optimized to simultaneously deliver 74.2 Gy/Gy relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) in 28 fractions on planning target volumes (PTVs)3-4 (P + proximal seminal vesicles), 65.5 Gy/Gy(RBE) on PTV2 (distal seminal vesicles and rectum/prostate overlapping), and 51.8 Gy/Gy(RBE) to PTV1 (pelvic lymph nodes). Normal tissue calculation probability (NTCP) calculations were performed for the rectum, and generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) was estimated for the bowel cavity, penile bulb and bladder.  Results:   A slightly better PTV coverage and homogeneity of target dose distribution with IMPT was found: the percentage of PTV volume receiving ≥ 95% of the prescribed dose (V(95%)) was on average > 97% in HT and > 99% in IMPT. The conformity indexes were significantly lower for protons than for photons, and there was a statistically significant reduction of the IMPT dosimetric parameters, up to 50 Gy/Gy(RBE) for the rectum and bowel and 60 Gy/Gy(RBE) for the bladder.

In comparison to B. mori fibroin, A. mylitta fibroin not only provided better cell adhesion, but also improved cell viability and proliferation. Yield coefficient of glucose consumed to lactate produced by cells on 3D A. mylitta fibroin was found to be similar to that of cancer cells in vivo. LNCaP prostate cancer cells were also cultured on 3D A. mylitta fibroin and they grew as clumps in long term culture.

In this approach, iron oxide core nanoparticles were obtained by precipitation of iron salts in the presence of ammonia and provided β-cyclodextrin and pluronic polymer (F127) coatings. This formulation (F127250) was highly water dispersible which allowed encapsulation of the anti-cancer drug(s) in β-cyclodextrin and pluronic polymer for sustained drug release. The F127250 formulation has exhibited superior hyperthermia effects over time under alternating magnetic field compared to pure magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) and β-cyclodextrin coated nanoparticles (CD200).

Methods:   The alterations of DMBT1 expression after treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor in 2 prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC-3) were analyzed by genome microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 36 prostate cancer tissues and 16 benign prostatic tissues were evaluated with reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry for DMBT1 expression.  Results:   Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated expression of DMBT1 in PC3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells. Downregulation or loss of DMBT1 mRNA and protein expression was observed in prostate cancer, but not in benign tissues.

Results:   Single focus prostate cancer was identified in 106 radical prostatectomies. Median patient age was 59 years. Median prostate specific antigen was 5.1 ng/ml.

Materials and methods:   A total of 238 men with prostate cancer met active surveillance eligibility criteria and were analyzed for progression with time. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate predictors of progression. Progression was evaluated using 2 definitions, including no longer meeting 1) full and 2) modified criteria, excluding prostate specific antigen greater than 10 ng/ml as a criterion.  Results:   Using full criteria 61 patients progressed during followup. The 2 and 5-year progression-free probability was 80% and 60%, respectively. With prostate specific antigen included in progression criteria prostate specific antigen at confirmatory biopsy (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.14-1.46, p <0.0005) and positive confirmatory biopsy (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.01-3.04, p = 0.047) were independent predictors of progression. Of the 61 cases 34 failed due to increased prostate specific antigen, including only 5 with subsequent progression by biopsy criteria. When prostate specific antigen was excluded from progression criteria, only 32 cases progressed, and 2 and 5-year progression-free probability was 91% and 76%, respectively. Using modified criteria as an end point positive confirmatory biopsy was the only independent predictor of progression (HR 3.16, 95% CI 1.41-7.09, p = 0.005).  Conclusions:   Active surveillance is feasible in patients with low risk prostate cancer and most patients show little evidence of progression within 5 years.

Materials and methods:   We followed 2,111 men who underwent brachytherapy a median of 6 years (range 2 to 17). Median prostate specific antigen was 7 ng/ml. Of the men 1,455 (68.9%) had clinical stage T2a or less and 1,428 (67.6%) had Gleason score less than 7. A total of 1,171 patients (55.5%) received (125)I, 221 (10.4%) received (103)Pd and 719 (34.1%) received supplemental external beam irradiation combined with (103)Pd. Post-implant dosimetry was done 30 days after implantation with doses converted to the biologically effective dose. Prostate biopsy was done 2 years after permanent prostate brachytherapy in 586 men (27.8%). Survival functions were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression with proportions tested by the log rank test.  Results:   The 12-year biochemical freedom from failure rate was 78.6%, and stage, Gleason score, prostate specific antigen and biologically effective dose were significant predictors (p = 0.007, <0.001, 0.005 and <0.001, respectively). In 964 patients at low risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 88.1% and significant predictors were hormonal therapy (p = 0.030), prostate specific antigen (p = 0.026) and biologically effective dose (p = 0.003). In 499 patients at intermediate risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 79.2% with biologically effective dose a significant predictor (p <0.001). In 648 men at high risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 67% and significant predictors were hormonal therapy, Gleason score and biologically effective dose (p = 0.036, <0.001 and 0.012, respectively). The local failure rate was 7.3% with biologically effective dose a significant predictor (p <0.001). Prostate biopsy was positive in 21 of 121 cases (21.5%) for a biologically effective dose of 150 Gy2 or less, in 14 of 248 (5.6%) for greater than 150 to 200 Gy2 and in 3 of 193 (1.6%) for greater than 200 Gy2 (p <0.001). The 12-year freedom from metastasis rate was 95.2% with Gleason score a significant predictor (p <0.001). Cause specific survival at 12 years was 94.5% with Gleason score and biologically effective dose significant predictors (p <0.001 and 0.027, respectively).

Since data used to create the calculator came from an unreferred population that underwent mainly sextant biopsy, to our knowledge its usefulness in the contemporary urology practice is unknown.  Materials and methods:   We performed the same multivariate logistic regression used to derive the prostate cancer risk calculator in a cohort of men from the Stanford Prostate Needle Biopsy Database who underwent initial prostate needle biopsy using an extended 12-core scheme.  Results:   Our predictions of overall prostate cancer risk did not differ significantly from those of the calculator. Prostate specific antigen, abnormal digital rectal examination and family history were independent risk factors. However, our model predicted a much greater risk of high grade disease than the prostate cancer risk calculator. Prostate specific antigen, abnormal digital rectal examination and age were independent risk factors for high grade disease.  Conclusions:   The difference between our estimated risk of high grade prostate cancer and that of the prostate cancer risk calculator can be potentially explained by 1) differences between the cohorts (referred vs unreferred) or 2) the difference in grading, ie grading accuracy due to the difference in biopsy schemes or to temporally related grade shifts.

Several enzymes hydrolyze ECs to reduce endogenous EC concentrations and produce eicosanoids that promote cell growth. In this study, we determined the effects of EC hydrolysis inhibitors and a putative EC, 2-arachidonylglyceryl ether (noladin ether, NE) on proliferation of prostate carcinoma (PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP) cells. PC-3 cells had the least specific hydrolysis activity for AEA and administration of AEA effectively inhibited cell proliferation. The proliferation inhibition was blocked by SR141716A (a selective CB1R antagonist) but not SR144528 (a selective CB2R antagonist), suggesting a CB1R-mediated inhibition mechanism. On the other hand, specific hydrolysis activity for 2-AG was high and 2-AG inhibited proliferation only in the presence of EC hydrolysis inhibitors. NE inhibited proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner; however, SR141716A, SR144528 and pertussis toxin did not block the NE-inhibited proliferation, suggesting a CBR-independent mechanism of NE. A peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662 did not block the NE-inhibited proliferation, suggesting that PPARγ was not involved.

Patients and methods:   • In total, 500 consecutive patients underwent RALP between 2005 and 2009 carried out by two surgeons. Using an ethically-approved database, prospective data collection of demographic, surgical, oncological and functional outcomes (patient reported) was performed, with up to 4 years of follow-up. • The learning curves of both surgeons were analyzed and, in addition, the first 100 and last 100 patients were compared to determine the effect of surgeon experience.  Results:   • The mean age of the patients was 61.5 years and mean preoperative prostate-specific antigen was 7.0 µg/L. Clinical stages were T1 in 63.2%, T2 in 33.8% and T3 in 3.0% of patients. Median (range) operating time was 170 (63-420) min and median (range) blood loss was 200 (20-3000) mL, with significant improvements for both surgeons with increasing experience (P < 0.001 and P= 0.029, respectively). • Pathological stages were pT2 in 53.4%, pT3a in 41.6%, pT3b in 4.0% and pT4 in 0.6% of patients. Overall, the positive margin rate (PMR) was 24.0% and stage-specific rates were 16.1%, 30.4%, 55.0% and 100.0% for pT2, pT3a, pT3b and pT4 disease, respectively. In the last 50 cases performed by each surgeon, the PMRs for pT2 and pT3a disease were 8.0% and 19.1% (surgeon 1) and 12.9% and 23.5% (surgeon 2). • At 12 months of follow-up, 91.3% of patients were continent and, by 48 months of follow-up, 75% of men with preoperative potency who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing RALP were potent.

The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect of different radiation fractionation schemes on tumor cell killing, assuming a realistic distribution of tumor oxygenation.  Methods and materials:   A probability density function for the partial pressure of oxygen in a tumor cell population is quantified as a function of radial distance from the capillary wall. Corresponding hypoxia reduction factors for cell killing are determined. The surviving fraction of a tumor consisting of maximally resistant cells, cells at intermediate levels of hypoxia, and normoxic cells is calculated as a function of dose per fraction for an equivalent tumor biological effective dose under normoxic conditions.  Results:   Increasing hypoxia as a function of distance from blood vessels results in a decrease in tumor cell killing for a typical radiotherapy fractionation scheme by a factor of 10(5) over a distance of 130 μm. For head-and-neck cancer and prostate cancer, the fraction of tumor clonogens killed over a full treatment course decreases by up to a factor of ∼10(3) as the dose per fraction is increased from 2 to 24 Gy and from 2 to 18 Gy, respectively.  Conclusions:   Hypofractionation of a radiotherapy regimen can result in a significant decrease in tumor cell killing compared to standard fractionation as a result of tumor hypoxia.

Recently, dosimetric studies have demonstrated the potential for achieving similar dosimetry with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) compared with HDR brachytherapy. Here, we report our technique, PSA nadir, and acute and late toxicity with SBRT as monotherapy and post-EBRT boost for PCa using HDR brachytherapy fractionation.  Patients and methods:   To date, 38 patients have been treated with SBRT at the University of California-San Francisco with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Twenty of 38 patients were treated with SBRT monotherapy (9.5 Gy × 4 fractions), and 18 were treated with SBRT boost (9.5 Gy × 2 fractions) post-EBRT and androgen deprivation therapy. PSA nadir to date for 44 HDR brachytherapy boost patients with disease characteristics similar to the SBRT boost cohort was also analyzed as a descriptive comparison.  Results:   SBRT was well tolerated. With a median follow-up of 18.3 months (range, 12.6-43.5), 42% and 11% of patients had acute Grade 2 gastrourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity, respectively, with no Grade 3 or higher acute toxicity to date. Two patients experienced late Grade 3 GU toxicity. All patients are without evidence of biochemical or clinical progression to date, and favorably low PSA nadirs have been observed with a current median PSA nadir of 0.35 ng/mL (range, <0.01-2.1) for all patients (0.47 ng/mL, range, 0.2-2.1 for the monotherapy cohort; 0.10 ng/mL, range, 0.01-0.5 for the boost cohort). With a median follow-up of 48.6 months (range, 16.4-87.8), the comparable HDR brachytherapy boost cohort has achieved a median PSA nadir of 0.09 ng/mL (range, 0.0-3.3).

Set-up using direct prostate localization on CBCT scans is compared to set-up using internal markers.  Material and methods:   20 patients with prostate cancer were enrolled in the study. After each daily session, a set of 2D-2D and 3D images were acquired. The images isocenter was compared to reference images isocenter. For the set-up error analysis the systematic error, μ, and the set-up uncertainties, Σ and σ, were determined for the translational shift in the three directions, lat, lng and vrt. The set-up errors and uncertainties were calculated in the same way for rotations around the three axes, lat, lng and vrt.  Results:   Set-up uncertainties were evaluated for four different set-up methods. The systematic error uncertainties were found to be in the range 0.38-1.14 mm and for the random error 0.79-1.48 mm. For rotations the uncertainties ranges were 0.38-1.59° and 0.91-2.18° for systematic and random uncertainties, respectively. Set-up uncertainties, using internal markers or prostate itself to position the target in the isocenter, were comparable.

In this study, we evaluated the prophylactic efficacy of an active immunization protocol against prostate cancer associated antigens mPSCA and mSTEAP1 in experimental prostate cancer. Two antigen delivery platforms, recombinant DNA and MVA vectors, both encoding either mPSCA or mSTEAP1 were used in diversified DNA prime/MVA boost vaccination protocol. Antitumour activity was evaluated in TRAMP-C1 subcutaneous syngeneic tumour model and TRAMP mice. DNA prime/MVA boost immunization against either mPSCA or mSTEAP1, delayed tumour growth in TRAMP-C1 cells-challenged mice. Furthermore, simultaneous vaccination with both antigens produced a stronger anti-tumour effect against TRAMP-C1 tumours than vaccination with either mPSCA or mSTEAP1 alone. Most importantly, concurrent DNA prime/MVA boost vaccination regimen with those antigens significantly decreased primary tumour burden in TRAMP mice without producing any apparent adverse effects. Histopathological analysis of prostate tumours from vaccinated and control TRAMP mice revealed also that mPSCA/mSTEAP1 based-vaccination was effective at reducing the severity of prostatic lesions and incidence of high-grade poorly differentiated prostate cancer. Suppression of the disease progression in TRAMP mice was correlated with decreased proliferation index and increased infiltration of T-cells in prostate tissue.

The expression of p27 is subject to multiple mechanisms of control involving several transcription factors, kinase pathways and at least three different ubiquitin ligases (SCF(SKP)², KPC, Pirh2), which regulate p27 transcription, translation, protein stability and subcellular localization. Using a chemical genetics approach, we have asked whether this control network can be modulated by small molecules such that p27 protein expression is restored in cancer cells.  Results:   We developed a cell-based assay for measuring the levels of endogenous nuclear p27 in a high throughput screening format employing LNCaP prostate cancer cells engineered to overexpress SKP2. The assay platform was optimized to Z' factors of 0.48 - 0.6 and piloted by screening a total of 7368 chemical compounds. During the course of this work, we discovered two small molecules of previously unknown biological activity, SMIP001 and SMIP004, which increase the nuclear level of p27 at low micromolar concentrations. SMIPs (small molecule inhibitors of p27 depletion) also upregulate p21(Cip)¹, inhibit cellular CDK2 activity, induce G1 delay, inhibit colony formation in soft agar and exhibit preferential cytotoxicity in LNCaP cells relative to normal human fibroblasts. Unlike SMIP001, SMIP004 was found to downregulate SKP2 and to stabilize p27, although neither SMIP is a proteasome inhibitor. Whereas the screening endpoint - nuclear p27 - was robustly modulated by the compounds, SMIP-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were not strictly dependent on p27 and p21 - a finding that is explained by parallel inhibitory effects of SMIPs on positive cell cycle regulators, including cyclins E and A, and CDK4.  Conclusions:   Our data provide proof-of-principle that the screening platform we developed, using endogenous nuclear p27 as an endpoint, presents an effective means of identifying bioactive molecules with cancer selective antiproliferative activity. This approach, when applied to larger and more diverse sets of compounds with refined drug-like properties, bears the potential of revealing both unknown cellular pathways globally impinging on p27 and novel leads for chemotherapeutics targeting a prominent molecular defect of human cancers.""","""['Elizabeth Rico-Bautista', 'Chih-Cheng Yang', 'Lifang Lu', 'Gregory P Roth', 'Dieter A Wolf']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Biol""","""['The F-box protein SKP2 mediates androgen control of p27 stability in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.', 'Molecular pathway for (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'HER2-targeting antibodies modulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 via multiple signaling pathways.', 'E3 Ubiquitin Ligases as Molecular Targets in Human Oral Cancers.', 'Skp2-mediated MLKL degradation confers cisplatin-resistant in non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'Small-molecule compounds inhibiting S-phase kinase-associated protein 2: A review.', 'Targeting the untargetable: RB1-deficient tumours are vulnerable to Skp2 ubiquitin ligase inhibition.', 'Establishment of high-throughput screening HTRF assay for identification small molecule inhibitors of Skp2-Cks1.', 'Targeting the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System for Cancer Therapeutics by Small-Molecule Inhibitors.']"""

The purpose of this study was to analyze the relevance of PTOV1 expression to identify aggressive tumors derived from 12 different histological tissues. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 182 biopsy samples, including 168 human tumors, were analyzed for PTOV1 and Ki67 expression by immunohistochemistry. Tumors of low and high histological grade were selected from lung, breast, endometrium, pancreas liver, skin, ovary, colon, stomach, kidney, bladder, and cerebral gliomas. One TMA with representative tissues without cancer (14 samples) was used as control. PTOV1 expression was analyzed semiquantitatively for the intensity and percentage of positive cells. Ki67 was evaluated for tumors proliferative index. Results show that PTOV1 was expressed in over 95% of tumors examined. Its expression was significantly associated to high-grade tumors (p = 0.014). This association was most significant in urothelial bladder carcinomas (p = 0.026). Overall, the expression of Ki67 was associated to high-grade tumors, and it was significant in several tumor types. PTOV1 and Ki67 were significantly co-overexpressed in all tumors (p = 0.001), and this association was significant in clear cell renal carcinoma (p = 0.005).

Modulation of estrogen receptor signaling using selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) offers an alternative approach for BPH management. Using human BPH-derived stromal cells and tissue explants in culture we evaluated two SERMs, DL-2-[4-(2-piperidinoethoxy)phenyl]-3-phenyl-2 H-1-benzopyran (BP) and Ormeloxifene (Orm) in comparison to Tamoxifen (Tam) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT). BP, OHT and Tam were more effective than Orm in reducing stromal cell proliferation of human BPH. BP was either equipotent or more effective than OHT and Tam in increasing estrogen receptor(ER)-ß, TGFß1, Fas and FasL, and in decreasing ER-α, AR, EGF-R and IGF-I expressions in BPH stromal cells. BP, Tam and Orm (1.0 mg/Kg) reduced rat prostate weights by almost same extent as Finasteride (Fin, 5.0 mg/Kg); however combination treatment (SERM+Fin) was more effective. BP was exceptionally efficient in reducing IGF-1 and cleaving PARP while combination treatments more effectively increased bax:bcl-2 ratio. Fin reduced acinar diameter and prostatic DHT level but increased testosterone, estradiol (E(2)) and E(2)/T+DHT ratio. SERMs, especially BP, reduced epithelial cell height drastically without significantly altering steroid hormone levels and E(2)/T+DHT ratio. Combination treatment reduced both acinar diameter and epithelial cell height with modest increase in E(2), T and E(2)/T+DHT. The study reveals the potential of SERMs per se for BPH management, and more effectively in combination with a 5α-reductase inhibitor.

However, currently commercially available POCT devices are mainly limited to the qualitative detection of protein markers. In this study we demonstrate the successive miniaturization of a sensitive and fast assay for the quantitative detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) using a well established and clinically approved homogeneous time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay technology (TRACE®) on a commercial plate-reader system (KRYPTOR®). Regarding the initial requirements for the development of POCT devices we applied a 30-fold assay volume reduction (150 µL to 5 µL) to achieve a reasonable lab-on-a-chip volume and a 24-fold and 120-fold excitation pulse energy reduction to achieve reasonable pulse energies for low-cost miniature excitation sources. Due to highly efficient optimization of key POCT parameters our miniaturized PSA assay achieved a 30% increased sensitivity and a 2-fold improved limit of detection compared to the standard plate-reader method. Our results demonstrate the successful implementation of key parameters for a significant miniaturization and for cost reduction in the clinically approved KRYPTOR® platform for protein detection.

Although resveratrol possesses chemopreventive properties against several cancers, the molecular mechanisms by which it inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis have not been clearly understood. The present study was carried out to examine whether PI3K/AKT/FOXO pathway mediates the biological effects of resveratrol.  Methodology/principal findings:   Resveratrol inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT and mTOR. Resveratrol, PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 and Wortmannin) and AKT inhibitor alone slightly induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These inhibitors further enhanced the apoptosis-inducing potential of resveratrol. Overexpression of wild-type PTEN slightly induced apoptosis. Wild type PTEN and PTEN-G129E enhanced resveratrol-induced apoptosis, whereas PTEN-G129R had no effect on proapoptotic effects of resveratrol. Furthermore, apoptosis-inducing potential of resveratrol was enhanced by dominant negative AKT, and inhibited by wild-type AKT and constitutively active AKT. Resveratrol has no effect on the expression of FKHR, FKHRL1 and AFX genes. The inhibition of FOXO phosphorylation by resveratrol resulted in its nuclear translocation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity. The inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway induced FOXO transcriptional activity resulting in induction of Bim, TRAIL, p27/KIP1, DR4 and DR5, and inhibition of cyclin D1. Similarly, resveratrol-induced FOXO transcriptional activity was further enhanced when activation of PI3K/AKT pathway was blocked. Over-expression of phosphorylation deficient mutants of FOXO proteins (FOXO1-TM, FOXO3A-TM and FOXO4-TM) induced FOXO transcriptional activity, which was further enhanced by resveratrol. Inhibition of FOXO transcription factors by shRNA blocked resveratrol-induced upregulation of Bim, TRAIL, DR4, DR5, p27/KIP1 and apoptosis, and inhibition of cyclin D1 by resveratrol.  Conclusion/significance:   These data suggest that FOXO transcription factors mediate anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of resveratrol, in part due to activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway.""","""['Qinghe Chen', 'Suthakar Ganapathy', 'Karan P Singh', 'Sharmila Shankar', 'Rakesh K Srivastava']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Resveratrol inhibits growth of orthotopic pancreatic tumors through activation of FOXO transcription factors.', 'Resveratrol enhances antitumor activity of TRAIL in prostate cancer xenografts through activation of FOXO transcription factor.', 'Apigenin inhibits prostate cancer progression in TRAMP mice via targeting PI3K/Akt/FoxO pathway.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation of FOXO protein stability via ubiquitination and proteasome degradation.', 'Resveratrol, Epigallocatechin Gallate and Curcumin for Cancer Therapy: Challenges from Their Pro-Apoptotic Properties.', 'A novel panel of clinically relevant miRNAs signature accurately differentiates oral cancer from normal mucosa.', 'Mechanism of Resveratrol-Induced Programmed Cell Death and New Drug Discovery against Cancer: A Review.', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'The role of Wnt/mTOR signaling in spinal cord injury.']"""

HIF-1α is often upregulated in tumors leading to more aggressive tumor growth and chemoresistance, therefore representing an important target for antitumor intervention. We previously reported that zinc downregulated HIF-1α levels. Here, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms of zinc-induced HIF-1α downregulation and whether zinc affected HIF-1α also in vivo.  Methodology/principal findings:   Here we report that zinc downregulated HIF-1α protein levels in human prostate cancer and glioblastoma cells under hypoxia, whether induced or constitutive. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms showed that zinc induced HIF-1α proteasomal degradation that was prevented by treatment with proteasomal inhibitor MG132. HIF-1α downregulation induced by zinc was ineffective in human RCC4 VHL-null renal carcinoma cell line; likewise, the HIF-1αP402/P564A mutant was resistant to zinc treatment. Similarly to HIF-1α, zinc downregulated also hypoxia-induced HIF-2α whereas the HIF-1β subunit remained unchanged. Zinc inhibited HIF-1α recruitment onto VEGF promoter and the zinc-induced suppression of HIF-1-dependent activation of VEGF correlated with reduction of glioblastoma and prostate cancer cell invasiveness in vitro. Finally, zinc administration downregulated HIF-1α levels in vivo, by bioluminescence imaging, and suppressed intratumoral VEGF expression.  Conclusions/significance:   These findings, by demonstrating that zinc induces HIF-1α proteasomal degradation, indicate that zinc could be useful as an inhibitor of HIF-1α in human tumors to repress important pathways involved in tumor progression, such as those induced by VEGF, MDR1, and Bcl2 target genes, and hopefully potentiate the anticancer therapies.""","""['Lavinia Nardinocchi', 'Valentina Pantisano', 'Rosa Puca', 'Manuela Porru', 'Aurora Aiello', 'Annalisa Grasselli', 'Carlo Leonetti', 'Michal Safran', 'Gideon Rechavi', 'David Givol', 'Antonella Farsetti', ""Gabriella D'Orazi""]""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Targeting hypoxia in cancer cells by restoring homeodomain interacting protein-kinase 2 and p53 activity and suppressing HIF-1alpha.', 'Topotecan inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor production and angiogenic activity induced by hypoxia in human neuroblastoma by targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and -2alpha.', 'Aldose reductase inhibition prevents hypoxia-induced increase in hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by regulating 26 S proteasome-mediated protein degradation in human colon cancer cells.', 'Role of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha versus HIF-2alpha in the regulation of HIF target genes in response to hypoxia, insulin-like growth factor-I, or loss of von Hippel-Lindau function: implications for targeting the HIF pathway.', 'Cytotoxic/tumor suppressor role of zinc for the treatment of cancer: an enigma and an opportunity.', 'Zinc enhances the cell adhesion, migration, and self-renewal potential of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells.', 'The role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) modulation in heavy metal toxicity.', 'HIPK2 in Angiogenesis: A Promising Biomarker in Cancer Progression and in Angiogenic Diseases.', 'FBXO30 functions as a tumor suppressor and an E3 ubiquitin ligase for hZIP1‑mediated HIF‑1α degradation in renal cell carcinoma.', 'ZnT2 Is Critical for TLR4-Mediated Cytokine Expression in Colonocytes and Modulates Mucosal Inflammation in Mice.']"""

However, biological and biochemical functions of ERG in prostate cancer (CaP) remain to be elucidated. This study suggests that ERG activation plays a role in prostaglandin signaling because knockdown of ERG expression in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion containing CaP cells leads to altered levels of the 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD), a tumor suppressor and prostaglandin catabolizing enzyme, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) . We demonstrate that HPGD expression is regulated by the binding of the ERG protein to the core promoter of this gene. Moreover, prostaglandin E2 dependent cell growth and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression are also affected by ERG knockdown.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) have antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on prostate cancer cells and their implication in silence AR signaling may have potential therapeutic use. We aimed to study the inhibitory effects of the corepressor SMRT (Silencing Mediator for Retinoid and Thyroid hormone receptors) which forms a complex together with nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) and with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) on AR activity. The androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell line C4-2 both AR-positive, and androgen-insensitive DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines were treated with two HDACIs, sodium butyrate (NaB) and/or trichostatin A (TSA). We amplified immunoprecipitated DNA by conventional PCR and in the following step we used the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis coupled with quantitative PCR for monitoring NaB induced formation of AR-SMRT/N-CoR complex binding on the PSA promoter. The co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed increase in AR-SMRT formation in NaB treated cells. Simultaneously, the Western blot analysis showed a significant decrease in AR protein expression. Furthermore, we estimated the reduced presence of HDAC2 and HDAC3 proteins by NaB and TSA treatment in AR-negative DU145 cell line. In conclusion, the inhibitory effect of NaB on AR gene expression seems to be specific and unique for prostate cancer AR-positive cell lines and corresponds with its ability to stimulate AR-SMRT complex formation.

The study findings are drawn from participant observations conducted at 16 PCSGs in British Columbia, Canada and 54 individual interviews that focused on men's experiences of attending group meetings. Men's communication and interactions at PCSGs provide important insights for how men talk about and conceptualize health and illness. For example, biomedical language often predominated at group meetings, and men used numbers and measures to engage with risk discourses in linking prostate cancer markers to various treatment options and morbidity and mortality rates. Many groups afforded opportunities for men to interact with health care providers as a means to better understand the language and logic of prostate cancer management. The health literacy skills fostered at PCSGs along with specific group-informed strategies could be mobilized in the men's subsequent clinical consultations. Consumer discourses and strategies to contest power relations with health care professionals underpinned many men's search for prostate cancer information and their commitment to assisting other men. Key were patients' rights, and perhaps responsibility, to compare diverse health products and services in making decisions across the entire trajectory of their prostate cancer.

We hypothesize that comparison between recent and more historical cases could introduce biases due to stage and grade migration upon time.  Design:   We reviewed 544 margin-free specimens from patients treated for clinically localized prostate cancer by radical prostatectomy between 2000 and 2005. One hundred and ninty-two patients that underwent biochemical recurrence after surgery were matched with 352 patients without progression, according to pretreatment prostate specific antigen, Gleason score, pathologic stage, and follow-up duration (at least 36 months).  Results:   The reassessment led to histopathologic reclassification of standard prognostic variables in 15% of cases, including modifications in the Gleason score (n = 63), pathologic stage (n = 12), and margin status (n = 30). Most discrepancies with the initial reports are explained either by differences in the scoring system upon time, or by the exam of additional tissues sections. The impact of reclassification led to increase adverse prognostic factors more frequently in the group of patients with progression (Chi(2), P < 0.0001).

CDKN1B also harbors single nucleotide polymorphisms; the T/G transversion at nucleotide 326 (the V109G variant) has been reported to be protective in breast, hereditary prostate, and pancreatic tumors. Association of CDNK1B mutations or polymorphisms with sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) has not been investigated yet.  Objective and design:   We screened germline DNA from 84 patients affected by sporadic MTC and 90 healthy age- and gender-matched controls for CDKN1B mutations or polymorphisms by PCR amplification and sequencing of the amplicons. We also tested all germline and 50 tumor tissue DNA for RET proto-oncogene mutations. Computed tomography, ultrasound scans, and serum calcitonin were carried out before surgery and during the follow-up and associated with CDKN1B polymorphism and disease remission.  Results:   The T/G transversion at nucleotide 326 was the only DNA variation detected. The overall frequency of the T/G and G/G alleles in combination was 46.4%. This variant (V109G) was correlated with post-operative calcitonin levels in the normal range and biochemical remission. Conversely, the wild-type (T/T) allele was associated with post-operative calcitonin levels above normal and a higher risk to develop clinical recurrence and distant metastases. Somatic RET mutations were significantly associated with a more aggressive behavior especially in wild-type allele-bearing patients.

It encodes SRD5A2 enzyme, which catalyses testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is the main active structure binding with androgen receptor (AR). After the activation of AR, it further regulates a series of target genes in androgen metabolism pathway. However, no clear consensus has been reached on the association between the SRD5A2 V89L, A49T and TA repeat polymorphisms and prostate cancer (PCa) risk. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of 31 association studies with 14,726 PCa cases and 15,802 controls. We found no association between PCa and 89L compared with 89V allele [odds ratio (OR) = 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.06, P(heterogeneity) = 0.44]. The 49T allele showed a significantly elevated effect on the high stage (Stages III-IV) of PCa risk both under the dominant genetic model (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.44-3.15, P(heterogeneity) = 0.65) and in the contrast T versus A allele (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.41-3.02, P(heterogeneity) = 0.69). There was a significantly decreased association between PCa and long TA repeat as compared versus short TA repeat (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-1.00, P(heterogeneity) = 0.79). No significant between-study heterogeneity was found in all subjects under four genetic models (dominant model, recessive model, allele comparison and homozygosity comparison) for these three polymorphisms, respectively, so the fixed effects model was used to pool the result. Our result indicated that carriers of 49T might improve the risk of PCa in higher stages (Stages III-IV), carriers of long TA repeat might decrease the risk of PCa and 89L may not be an important risk factor for PCa. However, due to the limited sample sizes, this meta-analysis did not achieve sufficiently conclusive results.

HRPC is almost incurable, although most HRPC cells still express androgen receptor (AR) and depend on the AR for growth, making AR a prime drug target. Here, we provide evidence that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, is a direct antagonist of androgen action. In silico modeling and FRET-based competition assay showed that EGCG physically interacts with the ligand-binding domain of AR by replacing a high-affinity labeled ligand (IC(50) 0.4 μM). The functional consequence of this interaction was a decrease in AR-mediated transcriptional activation, which was due to EGCG mediated inhibition of interdomain N-C termini interaction of AR. Treatment with EGCG also repressed the transcriptional activation by a hotspot mutant AR (T877A) expressed ectopically as well as the endogenous AR mutant. As the physiological consequence of AR antagonism, EGCG repressed R1881-induced PCa cell growth. In a xenograft model, EGCG was found to inhibit AR nuclear translocation and protein expression. We also observed a significant down-regulation of androgen-regulated miRNA-21 and up-regulation of a tumor suppressor, miRNA-330, in tumors of mice treated with EGCG.

The aim of this work was to analyze the inter-observer contouring uncertainties of target volumes and organs at risks (oars) in localized prostate cancer radiotherapy using CBCT images. Furthermore, CBCT contouring was benchmarked against other image modalities (CT, MR) and the influence of subjective image quality perception on inter-observer variability was assessed.  Methods and materials:   Eight prostate cancer patients were selected. Seven radiation oncologists contoured target volumes and oars on CT, MRI and CBCT. Volumes, coefficient of variation (COV), conformity index (cigen), and coordinates of center-of-mass (COM) were calculated for each patient and image modality. Reliability analysis was performed for the support of the reported findings. Subjective perception of image quality was assessed via a ten-scored visual analog scale (VAS).  Results:   The median volume for prostate was larger on CT compared to MRI and CBCT images. The inter-observer variation for prostate was larger on CBCT (CIgen=0.57±0.09, 0.61 reliability) compared to CT (CIgen=0.72±0.07, 0.83 reliability) and MRI (CIgen=0.66±0.12, 0.87 reliability). On all image modalities values of the intra-observer reliability coefficient (0.97 for CT, 0.99 for MR and 0.94 for CBCT) indicated high reproducibility of results. For all patients the root mean square (RMS) of the inter-observer standard deviation (σ) of the COM was largest on CBCT with σ(x)=0.4 mm, σ(y)=1.1 mm, and σ(z)=1.7 mm. The concordance in delineating OARs was much stronger than for target volumes, with average CIgen>0.70 for rectum and CIgen>0.80 for bladder. Positive correlations between CIgen and VAS score of the image quality were observed for the prostate, seminal vesicles and rectum.  Conclusions:   Inter-observer variability for target volume delineation in prostate cancer is larger for CBCT-based contouring compared to CT and MRI. This factor of influence needs to be considered when defining safety margins for CBCT-based Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART).""","""['Carola Lütgendorf-Caucig', 'Irina Fotina', 'Markus Stock', 'Richard Pötter', 'Gregor Goldner', 'Dietmar Georg']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Inter- and intra-observer variability in contouring of the prostate gland on planning computed tomography and cone beam computed tomography.', 'Evaluation of inter-observer variability of bladder boundary delineation on cone-beam CT.', 'Intra- and inter-observer variability in contouring prostate and seminal vesicles: implications for conformal treatment planning.', 'Target-volume and critical-organ delineation for conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer: experience of French dose-escalation trials.', 'Prostate Bed Delineation Guidelines for Postoperative Radiation Therapy: On Behalf Of The Francophone Group of Urological Radiation Therapy.', 'Assessment of intrafraction motion and its dosimetric impact on prostate radiotherapy using an in-house developed position monitoring system.', 'Evaluation of generalization ability for deep learning-based auto-segmentation accuracy in limited field of view CBCT of male pelvic region.', 'Utility of deformable image registration for adaptive prostate cancer treatment.

Material/methods:   Eight patients treated with HT were replanned with two-field IMPT (2fIMPT) and five-field IMPT (5fIMPT), using a small pencil beam size (3 mm sigma). The prescribed dose was 74.3 Gy in 28 fractions on PTV1 (prostate) and PTV2 (proximal seminal vesicles), 65.5 Gy on PTV3 (distal seminal vesicles) and on the overlap between rectum and PTVs.  Results:   IMPT and HT achieved similar target coverage and dose homogeneity, with 5fIMPT providing the best results. The conformity indexes of IMPT were significantly lower for PTV1+2 and PTV3.

OARs mean doses were typically reduced by 30-50% by IMPT. NTCPs for the rectum were within 1% between the two techniques, except when the endpoint was stool frequency, where IMPT showed a small (though statistically significant) benefit.

Overexpression of the hypoxia-responsive gene class III β-tubulin (TUBB3) has been associated with docetaxel resistance in a number of cancer models. We propose that administration of docetaxel to prostate patients has the potential to reduce the hypoxic response through HIF1A down-regulation and that TUBB3 down-regulation participates in sensitivity to docetaxel.  Methods:   The cytotoxic effect of docetaxel was determined in both 22Rv1 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines and correlated with HIF1A expression levels under aerobic and hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia-induced chemoresistance was investigated in a pair of isogenic docetaxel-resistant PC3 cell lines. Basal and hypoxia-induced TUBB3 gene expression levels were determined and correlated with methylation status at the HIF1A binding site.  Results:   Prostate cancer cells were sensitive to docetaxel under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic cytotoxicity of docetaxel was consistent with a reduction in detected HIF1A levels. Sensitivity correlated with reduced basal and hypoxia-induced HIF1A and TUBB3 expression levels. The TUBB3 HIF1A binding site was hypermethylated in prostate cell lines and tumor specimens, which may exclude transcription factor binding and induction of TUBB3 expression. However, acquired docetaxel resistance was not associated with TUBB3 overexpression.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that the hypoxic nature of a tumor may have relevance as regard to their response to docetaxel. Further investigation into the nature of this relationship may allow identification of novel targets to improve tumor control in prostate cancer patients.""","""['James C Forde', 'Antoinette S Perry', 'Kevin Brennan', 'Lynn M Martin', 'Mark P Lawler', 'Thomas H Lynch', 'Donal Hollywood', 'Laure Marignol']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""[""Hypoxia induces class III beta-tubulin gene expression by HIF-1alpha binding to its 3' flanking region."", 'ABCC4 Decreases docetaxel and not cabazitaxel efficacy in prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Gene expression analysis in prostate cancer: the importance of the endogenous control.', 'HIF1α expression under normoxia in prostate cancer--which pathways to target?', 'Tumor cell hypoxia and the hypoxia-response signaling system as a target for prostate cancer therapy.', 'βIII-Tubulin Gene Regulation in Health and Disease.', 'Repurposing FDA approved drugs as radiosensitizers for treating hypoxic prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of Taxane Resistance.', 'Hsa-miR-210-3p expression in breast cancer and its putative association with worse outcome in patients treated with Docetaxel.', 'Effects of hypoxia on human cancer cell line chemosensitivity.']"""

Results showed that a narrow size distributed nanosuspension composed of unchanged crystalline state with a mean particle size of 515±18 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.12±0.03 and a zeta potential of -23.1±3.5 mV was obtained. In the in vitro dissolution test an accelerated dissolution velocity and increased saturation solubility could be shown for the MD nanosuspension.

Lymph node specimens were also stained immunohistochemically with an antibody PSA after RP.  Results:   Pathological examination detected lymph node metastases from 3 cases, and real-time PCR further identified lymph node micrometastases from 14 cases with no pathological evidence of nodal involvement. The expression level of PSA mRNA and PSMA mRNA were statistically significant in patients with histological confirmed lymph node metastases and micrometastases detected by real-time PCR despite the lack of histological evidence, and the expression level of PSA mRNA and PSMA mRNA in aspirate were higher than the lymph node between the group A and group B.  Conclusions:   Although residual foci of atrophic prostate cancer cells in resected lymph nodes after NHT can be difficult to diagnose by pathological examination, the present results show the usefulness of quantitative real-time PCR targeting PSA and PSMA mRNA for detected micrometastatic tumour foci in pelvic lymph nodes from fine needle aspiration biopsy of lymph nodes before RP.""","""['Wei-mu Xia', 'Ding-yi Liu', 'Wen-long Zhou', 'Ming-wei Wang', 'Jian Wang', 'Ying Wang', 'Shu-jun Wang', 'Yu-sheng Xu', 'Yong-feng Ye', 'Li Zhang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi""","""['Significance of micrometastases in pelvic lymph nodes detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy after neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.', 'Implications of prostate micrometastases in pelvic lymph nodes: an archival tissue study.', 'Detection of micrometastatic prostate cancer cells in the lymph nodes by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is predictive of biochemical recurrence in pathological stage T2 prostate cancer.', 'Significance of micrometastases in prostate cancer.', 'Significance of micrometastases in pelvic lymph nodes from patients with localized prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   From 2003 to 2009, the medical records of patients who were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer were retrospectively reviewed. The data collected included: age, digital rectal examination, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, clinical T stage, and bone isotope scan. Patients were divided into two groups according to the results of bone isotope scan; positive group and negative group. A univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was used to analyze the results.  Results:   Of the 106 patients, 98 had a complete data collection and were entered into the study. The median age of the patients was 70.5 years and patients with a positive bone scan was 74 years, significantly higher than for patients with negative scans (69 years) (p=0.02). Bone metastasis was detected in 39 cases (39.7%). In all patients with clinical T1-2 stage, a Gleason score of <8 and PSA≤20 ng/mL, the bone isotope scans were negative. In univariate analysis, PSA (>20 ng/mL) and Gleason score (>7) were independently predictive of positive bone scan, while clinical stage was not.

Towards this goal, we characterized the relevance of tumour necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (ADAM17) for such targeted therapeutics. ADAM17 is one of the several metalloproteinases that play a key role in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling and has recently emerged as a new therapeutic target in several tumour types. In the present study, we analysed the expression profile of ADAM17 in a variety of normal and cancer cells of human origin and found that this protein is over-expressed on the surface of several types of cancer cells compared to the normal counterparts. Furthermore, we analysed the presentation of a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-restricted epitope from ADAM17 protein to specific T cells established from normal donors as well as ovarian cancer patients. Our analysis revealed that the HLA-A2-restricted epitope is processed efficiently and presented by various cancer cells and not by normal cells.

Material:   in seven intermediate/high risk patients, T2WI, T1WI and DWI MRI imaging showed evidence of one DIL in four patients and two DILs in three patients in the peripheral zone of the prostate. The planning strategy was to deliver median doses of 80, 90, 100 and 120 Gy to PTVDIL while delivering 71.4 Gy/28 fractions (EQD(2)=75 Gy) to the remaining portion of PTV. A higher priority was assigned to rectal constraints relative to DIL coverage. Rectal NTCP calculations were performed using the most recently available model data.  Results:   the median dose to DIL could safely be escalated to at least 100 Gy (EQD(2,α/β=10)=113 Gy) without violating safe constraints for the organs at risk. Typical rectal NTCP values were around or below 1-3% for G3 toxicity and 5-7% for G2-G3 toxicity. For the 100 Gy DIL dose boost strategy, mean D95% of DIL and PTVDIL were 98.8 Gy and 86.7 Gy, respectively. The constraints for bladder, urethra and femoral heads were always respected.  Conclusions:   IGRT by Helical Tomotherapy may permit the safe escalation of EQD(2,α/β=10) to at least 113 Gy to DILs without significantly increasing rectal NTCP compared to plans without dose escalation.

Risk of migration was estimated using multiple MR. Acute urinary toxicity was scored using the international prostate symptom score (IPSS). Late gastro-intestinal (GI) and genito-urinary (GU) toxicity was scored using the Radio Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) score, biochemical failure (BF) was defined as an elevation of prostate specific antigen (PSA) above nadir plus 2 ng/ml after radiotherapy.  Results:   One hundred men were enrolled in the study. Ninety completed radiotherapy with the stent as fiducial. No migration of the stent was seen, but three cases of dislocation of the stent to the bladder were observed. Acute urinary toxicity based on IPSS was comparable to toxicity in patients who had gold markers (GM) as fiducials. Removal of the stent was associated with a high frequency of urinary retention. Late GI and GU toxicity and BF were comparable to those of other studies, but longer observation time is needed.  Conclusions:   This study reports the first clinical results of using a prostate stent as fiducial. No migration of the stent observed. Dislocation of the stent to the urinary bladder was observed in three cases, requiring removal of the stent and insertion of a new fiducial.

This study constituted an extension of our published work relating to the identification and relative quantification of potential clinical biomarkers in BPH and prostate cancer (PCa) tissue specimens. The proposed MudPIT approach encompassed the use of three distinct yet complementary liquid chromatographic chemistries. High-pressure size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used for the prefractionation of serum proteins followed by their dialysis exchange and solution phase trypsin proteolysis. The tryptic peptides were then subjected to offline zwitterion-ion hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ZIC-HILIC) fractionation followed by their online analysis with reversed-phase nano-ultraperformance chromatography (RP-nUPLC) hyphenated to nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry using an ion trap mass analyzer. For the spectral processing, the sequential use of the SpectrumMill, Scaffold, and InsPecT software tools was applied for the tryptic peptide product ion MS(2) spectral processing, false discovery rate (FDR) assessment, validation, and protein identification. This milestone serum analysis study allowed the confident identification of over 1955 proteins (p ≤ 0.05; FDR ≤ 5%) with a broad spectrum of biological and physicochemical properties including secreted, tissue-specific proteins spanning approximately 12 orders of magnitude as they occur in their native abundance levels in the serum matrix. Also encompassed in this proteome was the confident identification of 375 phosphoproteins (p ≤ 0.05; FDR ≤ 5%) with potential importance to cancer biology. To demonstrate the performance characteristics of this novel MudPIT approach, a comparison was made with the proteomes resulting from the immunodepletion of the high abundant albumin and IgG proteins with offline first dimensional tryptic peptide separation with both ZIC-HILIC and strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography and their subsequent online RP-nUPLC-nESI-MS(2) analysis.""","""['Spiros D Garbis', 'Theodoros I Roumeliotis', 'Stavros I Tyritzis', 'Kostas M Zorpas', 'Kitty Pavlakis', 'Constantinos A Constantinides']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Comparison of alternative analytical techniques for the characterisation of the human serum proteome in HUPO Plasma Proteome Project.', 'Shotgun proteome analysis utilising mixed mode (reversed phase-anion exchange chromatography) in conjunction with reversed phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.', 'Zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (ZIC-HILIC and ZIC-cHILIC) provide high resolution separation and increase sensitivity in proteome analysis.', 'Development of hydrophilic interaction chromatographic hyphenated techniques and their applications.', 'Strong cation exchange (SCX) based analytical methods for the targeted analysis of protein post-translational modifications.', 'Bottom-Up Proteomics: Advancements in Sample Preparation.', 'Comprehensive plasma proteomic profiling reveals biomarkers for active tuberculosis.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Protein Footprinting for Higher-Order Structure Analysis: Fundamentals and Applications.', 'Review of Three-Dimensional Liquid Chromatography Platforms for Bottom-Up Proteomics.', 'Increased plasma CD14 levels 1 year postpartum in women with pre-eclampsia during pregnancy: a case-control plasma proteomics study.']"""

Methods:   Between 1995 and 2006, 500 patients underwent rectal resection for malignancies at a single institution. Thirty-six patients (7.2%) developed an anastomotic leakage postoperatively. Fifteen of these patients (41.6%) died during the follow-up period. A self-administering questionnaire including the International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Function Index, Short Form-12 Health Survey, International Prostatic Symptom Score, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form, Vaizey Incontinence Score and Wexner Constipation Score was sent to all 21 alive patients. Patients with rectal cancer resection without leakage served as controls for each case and were matched by sex, age (±5 years), type of resection, and neoadjuvant therapy (yes/no).  Results:   Sixteen patients (76.2%) were available and were included in the analysis. The median follow-up time was 106.8 months (32.4-170.4). Fecal incontinence, constipation, and sexual function did not differ significantly between patients and controls (p = 0.1973, 0.1189, 0.8519, respectively). By contrast, urinary continence was impaired significantly in the leakage group (p = 0.0430) but not in control patients. The Quality of Life assessing Short Form-12 Health Survey reached no significant difference between both groups (p = 1.0000 and 0.1973).

In the present study, we intend to silence the IKKα expression in prostate cancer cells using synthetic siRNAs and examine their biological effects on tumor cell invasiveness and growth.  Methods:   Three synthetic siRNAs targeting different regions of the IKKα mRNA were designed, and the silencing effect was determined in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Numerous studies, including wound-healing assay, migration assay, invasion assay, cell attachment assay, cell proliferation, and cell cycle analysis, were conducted to investigate the biological effects of the IKKα siRNAs on prostate cancer cells.  Results:   We have identified potent siRNAs that can silence the IKKα up to 74%. Inhibition of IKKα reduced the wound healing, migration, invasion and cell attachment capabilities of prostate cancer cells. Similar anti-invasive effects were also observed in the presence of RANKL. However, silencing of IKKα only showed a negligible effect on cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution.  Conclusion:   This study presents compelling evidence that IKKα plays a major role in prostate cancer invasion and metastasis, but not in cell proliferation.

The aim of this study has been to analyze whether 33% radius should be considered the recommended area to assess BMD in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   This is a retrospective study where BMD was assessed by DXA at 33% radius, lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck (cDXA) in 141 prostate cancer patients. Twenty-eight patients were hormone naïve while 113 were subjected to androgen suppression (AS) during the mean period of 29 months. Osteoporosis was diagnosed when T-score was lower than -2.5 and osteopenia when it ranged between -1 and -2.5.  Results:   The osteoporosis rate was 29.8% at 33% radius, 23.4% at femoral neck, 19.9% at lumbar spine, and 12.8% at total hip. The overall osteoporosis rate at cDXA was 29.1%. Osteoporosis was detected in 52.2% at 33% radius and 36.2% at cDXA. Normal BMD was found in 17.7% at 33% radius and 34.8% at cDXA. The 33% radius was the only site where a significant increase in the osteoporosis rate was detected in patients subjected to AS compared to those hormone naïve (33 and 13.8%).

Methods:   Within a 10-year period prior to the modification of GS, 856 patients (mean age 64.2 years) underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). The grade of agreement between GS in biopsy and definitive histology was calculated by Kappa statistics (κ). Univariable and multivariable influence of different preoperatively available parameters on disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed. The mean follow-up period was 39 months.  Results:   Concordance between GS in biopsy versus RP samples was 58% (κ-value 0.354) and was improved by an increased number of biopsy cores. Undergrading in biopsy was present in 38% and not significantly enhanced by an extended time-period between biopsy and RP (threshold 90 d). PSA level, clinical tumour stage, fraction of positive cores (dichotomized at 34%), cases of RP per year and institution (dichotomized at 75), and GS independently influenced DFS. An upgrading to GS ≥ 7 was found in only 5.7% of patients presenting with GS 2-4 in the biopsy. Independent from definitive histology, patients with GS 2-4 had a significantly better prognosis compared to patients with a higher GS.  Conclusions:   The present study shows an independent prognostic impact of GS in biopsy samples classified according to the previous classification.

If physicians are not aware of these issues, informed screening counseling cannot take place.  Methods:   Two questionnaire versions (""group"" and ""time"") presented 4 conditions: 5-y survival (5Y), 5-y survival and annual disease-specific mortality (5YM), annual disease-specific mortality (M), and 5-y survival, annual disease-specific mortality, and incidence (5YMI). Questionnaire version ""time"" presented data as a comparison between 2 time points and version ""group"" as a comparison between a screened and an unscreened group. All data were based on statistics for the same cancer site (prostate). Outcome variables were the recommendation of screening, reasoning behind recommendation, judgment of the screening's effectiveness, and, if judged effective, a numerical estimate of how many fewer people out of 1000 would die if screened regularly. After randomized allocation, 65 German physicians in internal medicine and its subspecialities completed either of the 2 questionnaire versions.  Results:   Across both versions, 66% of the physicians recommended screening when presented with 5Y, but only 8% of the same physicians made the recommendation when presented with M (5YM: 31%; 5YMI: 55%). Also, 5Y made considerably more physicians (78%) judge the screening to be effective than any other condition (5YM: 31%; M: 5%; 5YMI: 49%) and led to the highest overestimations of benefit.  Conclusion:   A large number of physicians erroneously based their screening recommendation and judgment of screening's effectiveness on the 5-y survival rate.

Methods and materials:   Twenty consecutive patients receiving single fraction HDR brachytherapy underwent kilovoltage cone-beam CT in the treatment room before treatment. If catheter displacement was apparent, catheters were adjusted and imaging repeated. Both sets of kilovoltage cone-beam CT image sets were coregistered off-line with the CT data set used for planning with rigid fusion of anatomy based on implanted fiducials. Catheter displacement was measured on both sets of images and dosimetry calculated.  Results:   Mean internal displacement of catheters was 11mm. This would have resulted in a decrease in mean volume receiving 100% of prescription dose (V(100)) from the planned 97.6% to 77.3% (p<0.001), a decrease of the mean dose to 90% of the prostate (D(90)) from 110.5% to 72.9% (p<0.001), and increase in dose to 10% of urethra (urethra D(10)) from 118% to 125% (p=0.0094). Each 1cm of catheter displacement resulted in a 20% decrease in V(100) and 36% decrease in D(90).

Methods and materials:   Nineteen biochemically failed brachytherapy patients were matched to 74 dosimetric and clinically equivalent nonfailures. The median followup time for the entire study population was 9.4 years. Eligibility requirements included a Day 0 intraprostatic D(90) of 100% or greater and V(100) of 90% or greater, absence of androgen deprivation therapy, and no evidence of distant metastasis in biochemically failed patients. A 5-mm annulus was constructed around the perimeter of each prostate. D(90) and V(100) at the anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, right lateral, and left lateral aspects of the annulus were evaluated for patients with biochemically controlled and failed disease. Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) was defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.40ng/mL or less after nadir. D(90) and V(100) parameters were compared between the controlled and failed groups using logistic regression. Predictors of biochemical failure were identified using Cox regression.  Results:   No statistically significant differences in prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, percent positive biopsies, or intraprostatic dosimetry were observed between the controlled and failed patients. The D(90) and V(100) at the anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, right lateral, and left lateral aspects of the annulus were not statistically different between biochemically controlled and failed groups.

Objective:   To evaluate the predictive ability of serum bone markers for mortality risk in PCa patients with bone metastases.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a survival analysis in relation to bone markers in a subgroup of 52 patients treated with zoledronic acid (4 mg every 4 wk for 15 mo) in a prospective, multicentre trial during 2002-2005, about 4 yr after the end of the trial.  Measurements:   Serum levels of total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, amino-terminal procollagen propeptides of type I collagen (PINP), cross-linked N-terminal (NTx) and cross-linked C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (ICTP), C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen, prostate-specific antigen from the last visit of the treatment study, and clinical data were related to the overall survival (OS) status of patients in the follow-up. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses with internal bootstrapping validation and concordance index calculations were performed.  Results and limitations:   Out of the 52 patients followed, 34 died within a median follow-up of 13.8 mo, and 18 patients were alive at a median follow-up of 43.8 mo. The patients who died within the follow-up period had significantly higher concentrations of ICTP, NTx, and PINP than the surviving patients. Cox regression models with clinical data and bone markers showed that ICTP and PINP were most predictive for mortality risk in addition to the occurrence of skeletal-related complications and the continuation of treatment with zoledronic acid. Internal validation confirmed the reliability of the results, although the sample size was small.

Methods:   Single cell cloning and spheroid culture studies were used to identify a population of cancer stem-like cells in the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell line PC3.  Results:   We demonstrate that, under standard culture conditions, ~10% of PC3 cells form holoclones with cancer stem cell characteristics. These holoclones display high self-renewal capability in spheroid formation assays under low attachment and serum-free culture conditions, retain their holoclone morphology when passaged at high cell density, exhibit moderate drug resistance, and show high tumorigenicity in scid immunodeficient mice. PC3 holoclones readily form spheres, and PC3-derived spheres yield a high percentage of holoclones, further supporting their cancer stem cell-like nature. We identified one gene, FAM65B, whose expression is consistently up regulated in PC3 holoclones compared to paraclones, the major cell morphology in the parental PC3 cell population, and two genes, MFI2 and LEF1, that are consistently down regulated. This molecular profile, FAM65Bhigh/MFI2low/LEF1low, also characterizes spheres generated from parental PC3 cells. The PC3 holoclones did not show significant enriched expression of the putative prostate cancer stem cell markers CD44 and integrin α2β1. PC3 tumors seeded with holoclones showed dramatic down regulation of FAM65B and dramatic up regulation of MFI2 and LEF1, and unexpectedly, a marked increase in tumor vascularity compared to parental PC3 tumors, suggesting a role of cancer stem cells in tumor angiogenesis.  Conclusions:   These findings support the proposal that PC3 tumors are sustained by a small number of tumor-initiating cells with stem-like characteristics, including strong self-renewal and pro-angiogenic capability and marked by the expression pattern FAM65Bhigh/MFI2low/LEF1low.

No data are available on familial clustering of CUP. We hypothesize that familial clustering of CUP with other cancers may be informative of the primary sites.  Patients and methods:   A total of 35,168 patients with CUP were identified in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, and risks between family members were calculated for concordant (CUP-CUP) and discordant (CUP-any other cancer) cancers using standardized incidence ratio (SIR).  Results:   Familial cases of CUP accounted for 2.8% of all CUP cases in the offspring generation. Familial SIR for CUP was 1.69 when a sibling was diagnosed with CUP. As to discordant associations between siblings, CUP was associated with lung (SIR, 1.87), kidney (SIR, 1.82), liver (SIR, 1.67), ovarian (SIR, 1.45), colorectal (SIR, 1.26), and breast (SIR, 1.15) cancers and melanoma (SIR, 1.26). Upper aerodigestive tract, bladder, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were additionally associated with CUP. Notably, CUP was associated with families of kidney, lung, and colorectal cancers.  Conclusion:   The present data show that CUP is not a disease of random metastatic cancers but, instead, a disease of a defined set of cancers. The association of CUP with families of kidney, lung, and colorectal cancers suggests a marked genetic basis and shared metastatic mechanisms by many cancer types. Familial sites shared by CUP generally match those arising in tissue-of-origin determinations and, hence, suggest sites of origin for CUP.

Materials and methods:   On the basis of published ERSPC data, we modeled the cumulative hazard function using a piecewise exponential model, assuming a constant hazard of 0.0002 for the screening and control groups for years 1 to 7 of the trial and different constant rates of 0.00062 and 0.00102 for the screening and control groups, respectively, for years 8 to 12.

A significant difference in their expression was see in hyperplastic and neoplastic prostates tissues (16.14 ± 0.17 and 30.72 ± 0.85, respectively) for PSMA and (34.39 ± 0.53 and 17.85 ± 1.21, respectively) for PSA. Study of prostate tumor profiles showed that the profile (PSA+, PSMA-) expression levels decreased between normal prostate, benign prostatic tissue and primary prostate cancer. In the other hand, the profile (PSA-, PSMA+) expression levels increased from normal to prostate tumor tissues. PSMA overexpression was associated with high intratumoral angiogenesis activity. By contrast, high PSA expression was associated with low angiogenesis activity.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that these markers are regulated differentially and the difference in their expression showed a correlation with malignant transformation. With regard to the duality PSMA-PSA, this implies the significance of their investigation together in normal and pathologic prostate tissues.""","""['Awatef Ben Jemaa', 'Yosra Bouraoui', 'Sataa Sallami', 'Ahmed Banasr', 'Nawfel Ben Rais', 'Latifa Ouertani', 'Yassin Nouira', 'Ali Horchani', 'Ridha Oueslati']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['PSA-PSMA profiles and their impact on sera PSA levels and angiogenic activity in hyperplasia and human prostate cancer.', 'Cellular distribution and heterogeneity of Psa and Psma expression in normal, hyperplasia and human prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-PSA clones controlled by full Akt phosphorylation (T308+,S473+) recapitulate molecular features of human prostate cancer.', 'Insight into the heterogeneity of prostate cancer through PSA-PSMA prostate clones: mechanisms and consequences.', 'Monoclonal antibodies and prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Rapamycin and Low-dose IL-2 Mediate an Immunosuppressive Microenvironment to Inhibit Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'The Transcriptomic Profiles of ESR1 and MMP3 Stratify the Risk of Biochemical Recurrence in Primary Prostate Cancer beyond Clinical Features.', 'Characterization of the Tumor Microenvironment and the Biological Processes with a Role in Prostatic Tumorigenesis.', 'KLK3 in the Regulation of Angiogenesis-Tumorigenic or Not?', 'Molecular Imaging in Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer Patients: Current Aspects and Future Trends.']"""

Analyzing our large series of PET cancer screening data, correlations with cancer detection rates according to general cancer risk factors and PET detection survey were reviewed, and the selection bias of the medical examinees was determined.  Methods:   19189 examinees who underwent PET cancer screening were enrolled. Using logistic-regression analysis, we analyzed correlations between smoking history/drinking history/cancer family history and detection rates of thyroid cancer/breast cancer/colorectal cancer/lung cancer, which are the main malignancies detected in PET cancer screening. In addition, we evaluated seeking bias of examinees, analyzing correlations between the presence of cancer risk factors and prior screening checkups at other institutions to our PET cancer screening using a matched case-control study.  Results:   Cancer detection rates by FDG-PET were 1.17% (224/19189), being much higher than those of standard cancer mass screenings. In males, statistically significant correlations were seen between lung cancer and smoking, and between prostate cancer and a family history of prostate cancer, but not between the detection rates of three other types of cancer (thyroid cancer/lung cancer/colorectal cancer) and other cancer risk factors. In females, detection rates of four types of cancer (thyroid cancer/lung cancer/colorectal cancer/breast cancer) were significantly higher in the examinees without cancer risks, and subgroup analysis according to types of cancer did not indicate significant correlations either. The matched case-control study evaluating seeking bias indicated that a significant proportion of the examinees with cancer risks had undergone prior cancer screening at other institutions.  Conclusions:   Our study indicated that there was significant seeking bias for prior screening of examinees, with this accounting for the fact that this study did not find a significant correlation between cancer risks and cancer detection rates. The results of our study indicated that PET cancer screening can provide high cancer detection rates.""","""['Koji Shibata', 'Masami Arai', 'Masaaki Matsuura', 'Kimiichi Uno', 'Teruhiko Yoshida', 'Toshimitsu Momose', 'Kuni Ohtomo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['Who wants cancer screening with PET?

To better understand this phenomenon, tumor biologists have sought to elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to the development of virulent prostate cancer. The recent discovery that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) functions as an important oncogene involved in prostate cancer progression reflects the success of this effort. Cav-1 is a major structural coat protein of caveolae, specialized plasma membrane invaginations involved in multiple cellular functions, including molecular transport, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. Cav-1 is aberrantly overexpressed in human prostate cancer, with higher levels evident in metastatic versus primary sites. Intracellular Cav-1 promotes cell survival through activation of Akt and enhancement of additional growth factor pro-survival pathways. Cav-1 is also secreted as a biologically active molecule that promotes cell survival and angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment. Secreted Cav-1 can be reproducibly detected in peripheral blood using a sensitive and specific immunoassay. Cav-1 levels distinguish men with prostate cancer from normal controls, and preoperative Cav-1 levels predict which patients are at highest risk for relapse following radical prostatectomy for localized disease. Thus, secreted Cav-1 is a promising biomarker in identifying clinically significant prostate cancer.""","""['Paul G Corn', 'Timothy C Thompson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Manag Res""","""['Caveolin-1: a novel biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Development of an immunoassay for serum caveolin-1: a novel biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'The role of caveolin-1 in prostate cancer: clinical implications.', 'Tumor cell-secreted caveolin-1 has proangiogenic activities in prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative serum caveolin-1 as a prognostic marker for recurrence in a radical prostatectomy cohort.', 'Caveolin-1, a Key Mediator Across Multiple Pathways in Glioblastoma and an Independent Negative Biomarker of Patient Survival.', 'Impact of Endocytosis Mechanisms for the Receptors Targeted by the Currently Approved Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs)-A Necessity for Future ADC Research and Development.', 'Association of Caveolin-1 Expression With Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Differential expression of Annexin 2, SPINK1, and Hsp60 predict progression of prostate cancer through bifurcated WHO Gleason score categories in African American men.', 'Overexpression of caveolin-1 attenuates brain edema by inhibiting tight junction degradation.']"""

In some of them, there is previous suspicion but in others this finding is completely incidental. We present 7 cases of prostate cancer detected in 100 patients who underwent bipolar transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate due to regular indications. The aim of this paper is to describe patient's characteristics, postoperative outcome, analyze TURP as a diagnostic tool and evaluate therapeutic options for prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   One hundred patients with bladder outlet obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) underwent TURP in FUCDIM between June 2007 and August 2009. In 7 of them, prostate adenocarcinomas were detected. None of the patients underwent TURP only because of increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Results:   Mean preoperative PSA was 7.6 ng/ml (r= 0.72 -27 ng/ml), 39% of the patients had PSA < 4 ng/ml; 33 (40%) had undergone previous biopsies and 36% of them had 2 or more previous biopsies. Prostate cancer detection global rate was 7%, 3 cases were incidental findings (low PSA and low-risk tumors), 3 patients had increased PSA and several previous biopsies with negative results and 1 had low PSA and aggressive tumor (Gleason 4+3).  Conclusions:   TURP patients with prostate cancer are a heterogeneous group. TURP can be both diagnostic and therapeutic when facing patients with obstructive symptoms, high PSA and negative prostate biopsies. There are several therapeutic alternatives for TURP patients with cancer, taking into consideration tumor grade and stage, age, life expectancy and will of the patient. Bipolar TUR, in selected patients, allows to offer optional active surveillance (in these patients PSADT is very useful) and if cancer is not found, it eases the follow up of these patients. Active treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) is indicated in T1a patients with life expectancy longer than 10 years, and in the majority of T1b patients.""","""['Tristán Dellavedova', 'Rolando Ponzano', 'Laura Racca', 'Federico Minuzzi', 'Mariana Domínguez']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['Delayed diagnosis of prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation after laser TURP.', 'Does laser ablation prostatectomy lead to oncological compromise?', 'Clinical study on prostatic cancer detected incidentally by transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'Primary malignant melanoma of the prostate: case report and review of the literature.', 'Urinary morbidity and incontinence following transurethral resection of the prostate after brachytherapy.', 'Transfer Learning for Adenocarcinoma Classifications in the Transurethral Resection of Prostate Whole-Slide Images.', 'Incidental prostate cancer in transurethral resection of the prostate specimens in the modern era.', 'Synergistic interaction of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis on prostate cancer risk.', 'Standard surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia is safe for patients over 75 years: analysis of 100 cases from a high-volume urologic center.']"""

Conventional RT-PCR revealed the expression of OXR2 in all studied samples obtained either from normal prostates or BPH ones while neither preproorexin (ppOX)nor OXR1 mRNA were detected. In adenomatous prostates, expression levels of OXR2 were 30- to 40-fold higher compared to controls. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of OXR2 protein in the studied samples and its expression levels were 4-fold higher in tissue samples from BPH. In normal glands, presence of OXR2-like immunoreactivity was found in the apical parts of epithelial cells as well as in smooth muscle cells of the stroma. Immunostaining for OXR2 was more intense in sections obtained from BPH. Immunohistochemistry did not detect the expression of OXR1-like protein. OXA serum concentrations were lowered in BPH patients (mean ± SE 56±4 ng/ml, n=12; P<0.01) and unaltered in prostate cancer (79±7 ng/ml, n=18) compared to the controls (69±2 ng/ml, n=16).

These findings suggest that both OXA and OXR2 may be involved in the pathogenesis and/or maintenance of BPH.""","""['Witold Malendowicz', 'Marta Szyszka', 'Agnieszka Ziolkowska', 'Marcin Rucinski', 'Zbigniew Kwias']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Effects of changes in energy homeostasis and exposure of noxious insults on the expression of orexin (hypocretin) and its receptors in the brain.', 'Orexin B inhibits proliferation and stimulates specialized function of cultured rat calvarial osteoblast-like cells.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 in patients with prostate carcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Increased expression of NKX3.1 in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The physiological role of orexins.', 'Does Orexin B-Binding Receptor 2 for Orexins Regulate Testicular and Epididymal Functions in Normal and Cryptorchid Dogs?', 'The Anti-tumoral Properties of Orexin/Hypocretin Hypothalamic Neuropeptides: An Unexpected Therapeutic Role.', 'Potential role of orexin A binding the receptor 1 for orexins in normal and cryptorchid dogs.', 'Orexin expression in different prostate histopathologic examinations: Can it be a marker for prostate cancer?

However, few current pathway enrichment analysis methods account for the sub-pathways or structures of the tested pathways. We present a sub-pathway-based enrichment approach for identifying a drug response principal network, which takes into consideration the quantitative structures of the pathways.  Result:   We validated this new approach on a microarray experiment that captures the transcriptional profile of dexamethasone (DEX)-treated human prostate cancer PC3 cells. Compared with GeneTrail and DAVID, our approach is more sensitive to the DEX response pathways. Specifically, not only pathways but also the principal components of sub-pathways and networks related to prostate cancer and DEX response could be identified and verified by literature retrieval.""","""['Xiujie Chen', 'Jiankai Xu', 'Bangqing Huang', 'Jin Li', 'Xin Wu', 'Ling Ma', 'Xiaodong Jia', 'Xiusen Bian', 'Fujian Tan', 'Lei Liu', 'Sheng Chen', 'Xia Li']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Bioinformatics""","""['Identifying novel prostate cancer associated pathways based on integrative microarray data analysis.', 'Construction of a reference gene association network from multiple profiling data: application to data analysis.', 'Cross-species global and subset gene expression profiling identifies genes involved in prostate cancer response to selenium.', 'Quantification of variation in expression networks.', 'Co-expression analysis of metabolic pathways in plants.', 'Identifying subpathway signatures for individualized anticancer drug response by integrating multi-omics data.', 'Disease Pathway Cut for Multi-Target drugs.', 'A comparison of mechanistic signaling pathway activity analysis methods.', 'High throughput estimation of functional cell activities reveals disease mechanisms and predicts relevant clinical outcomes.', 'MinePath: Mining for Phenotype Differential Sub-paths in Molecular Pathways.']"""

We first evaluate the growth inhibition effect of HDAC inhibitors in prostate cancer cells, which is accompanied by induction of p21(WAF1) expression and accumulation of acetylated histones. And we found that the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells is strongly inhibited by treatment with HDAC inhibitors. In parallel, E-cadherin level is highly up-regulated in HDAC inhibitor-treated prostate cancer cells. And siRNA knockdown of E-cadherin significantly diminishes the anti-invasion effect of HDAC inhibitors, indicating that E-cadherin overexpression is one of possible mechanism for anti-invasion effect of HDAC inhibitors. Furthermore, specific downregulation of HDAC1, but not HDAC2, causes E-cadherin expression and subsequent inhibition of cell motility and invasion. Collectively, our data demonstrate that HDAC1 is a major repressive enzyme for E-cadherin expression as well as HDAC inhibitor-mediated anti-invasiveness.""","""['Nam Hyun Kim', 'Su-Nam Kim', 'Yong Kee Kim']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Valproic acid inhibits prostate cancer cell migration by up-regulating E-cadherin expression.', 'Type-specific roles of histone deacetylase (HDAC) overexpression in ovarian carcinoma: HDAC1 enhances cell proliferation and HDAC3 stimulates cell migration with downregulation of E-cadherin.', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma regulates E-cadherin expression and inhibits growth and invasion of prostate cancer.', 'Potential Application of 5-Aryl-Substituted 2-Aminobenzamide Type of HDAC1/2- Selective Inhibitors to Pharmaceuticals.', 'Tumor suppressor maspin as a rheostat in HDAC regulation to achieve the fine-tuning of epithelial homeostasis.', 'Identification of Promising Drug Candidates against Prostate Cancer through Computationally-Driven Drug Repurposing.', 'Reversible epigenetic alterations regulate class I HLA loss in prostate cancer.', 'Exploring novel capping framework: high substituent pyridine-hydroxamic acid derivatives as potential antiproliferative agents.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Design of Fluorescent Coumarin-Hydroxamic Acid Derivatives as Inhibitors of HDACs: Synthesis, Anti-Proliferative Evaluation and Docking Studies.']"""

Patients and methods:   Four dose levels of S (mg/m(2)/day) and C (mg/m(2)/day) were evaluated in adult patients with advanced solid tumors: 60/1650, 80/1650, 60/2000, 70/2000; a course consisted of 28 days with sequential administration of S (days 1-5) and C (days 8-21) followed by one week rest.  Results:   Thirty-seven patients were treated, 24 in the dose escalation and 13 in the expansion phase; at the MTD, defined at S 70/C 2000, two patients presented dose limiting toxicities: lack of recovery of neutropenia by day 42 and nausea with dose skip of C. Most frequent toxicities were nausea (57%), diarrhea (51%), neutropenia (46%), anorexia, fatigue, vomiting (38% each). Two partial responses were observed in platinum sensitive ovarian cancer and one in prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   At S 70/C 2000 the combination of sequential S and C is tolerated with manageable toxicities; its evaluation in platinum and fluorouracil sensitive tumor types is worthwhile because of the easier administration and lack of nephro- and neurotoxicity as compared to parent compounds.""","""['Elisa Gallerani', 'Jean Bauer', 'Dagmar Hess', 'Steffen Boehm', 'Cornelia Droege', 'Sandrine Jeckelmann', 'Monica Miani', 'Richard Herrmann', 'Silvia Marsoni', 'Sabine Sperka', 'Cristiana Sessa']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Dose escalation study on oxaliplatin and capecitabine (Xeloda) in patients with advanced solid tumors.', 'A phase I study of the oral platinum agent satraplatin in combination with oral vinorelbine in patients with advanced solid malignancies.', 'Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of protein kinase C-alpha antisense oligonucleotide ISIS 3521 administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with advanced cancer.', 'Capecitabine: a review.', 'Capecitabine: have we got the dose right?']"""
