Radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy that targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) shows promise and is an area of active investigation. J591 is a deimmunized IgG monoclonal antibody developed to target the extracellular domain of PSMA. Preclinical and early phase clinical studies using radiolabeled J591 have demonstrated efficacy in targeting tumor cells and decreasing levels of prostate-specific antigen. Radiolabeled J591 is well-tolerated, nonimmunogenic, and can be administered in multiple doses. The dose-limiting toxicity is reversible myelosuppression with little nonhematologic toxicity. Future studies will include approaches to optimize patient selection and incorporate novel strategies to improve the success of anti-PSMA radioimmunotherapy.""","""['Scott T Tagawa', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Shankar Vallabhajosula', 'Stanley J Goldsmith', 'Joseph Osborne', 'Dan Matulich', 'Kristen Petrillo', 'Sarojben Parmar', 'David M Nanus', 'Neil H Bander']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Phase I trial of 177lutetium-labeled J591, a monoclonal antibody to prostate-specific membrane antigen, in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Phase 1/2 study of fractionated dose lutetium-177-labeled anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen monoclonal antibody J591 (177 Lu-J591) for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Biodistributions of 177Lu- and 111In-labeled 7E11 antibodies to prostate-specific membrane antigen in xenograft model of prostate cancer and potential use of 111In-7E11 as a pre-therapeutic agent for 177Lu-7E11 radioimmunotherapy.', 'Radioimmunotherapy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer with ¹⁷⁷Lu-DOTAhuJ591 Anti Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Specific Monoclonal Antibody.', 'Targeted systemic therapy of prostate cancer with a monoclonal antibody to prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Rationale for Prostate-Specific-Membrane-Antigen-Targeted Radionuclide Theranostic Applied to Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma.', 'Development of Cancer Immunotherapies.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted theranostics: past, present, and future approaches.', 'PSMA targeting in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: where are we and where are we going?', 'Evaluation of the efficiency of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Chemotherapy is one of the treatment alternatives for hormone refractory metastatic PCa. However, current chemotherapeutic regimens provide palliative benefit but relatively modest survival advantage primarily due to chemo-resistance and upregulated antiapoptotic machineries in PCa cells. Therefore, blocking the mechanisms responsible for suppression of apoptosis might improve current chemotherapeutic regimens. In this study, we show that CC chemokine receptor-9 (CCR9) and its natural ligand CCL25 interaction upregulates antiapoptotic proteins (i.e., PI3K, AKT, ERK1/2 and GSK-3beta) and downregulate activation of caspase-3 in PCa cells. Significant downregulation of these CCR9-mediated antiapoptotic proteins in the presence of a PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin), further suggests that the antiapoptotic action of CCR9 is primarily regulated through PI3K. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of etoposide was significantly inhibited in the presence of CCL25, and this inhibitory effect of CCL25 was abrogated when CCR9-CCL25 interaction was blocked using anti-CCR9 monoclonal antibodies. In conformation to these in vitro studies, significant reduction in tumor burden was found in mice receiving CCL25 neutralizing antibodies and etoposide together as compared to both as a single agent. These results suggest that the CCR9-CCL25 axis mediates PI3K/AKT-dependent antiapoptotic signals in PCa cells and could be a possible reason for low apoptosis and modest chemotherapeutic response. Therefore, targeting CCR9-CCL25 axis with cytotoxic agents may provide better therapeutic outcomes than using cytotoxic agents alone.""","""['Praveen K Sharma', 'Rajesh Singh', 'Kristian R Novakovic', 'John W Eaton', 'William E Grizzle', 'Shailesh Singh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['CCL25/CCR9 interaction promotes the malignant behavior of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'CCR9-CCL25 interaction suppresses apoptosis of lung cancer cells by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'CCR9-CCL25 interactions promote cisplatin resistance in breast cancer cell through Akt activation in a PI3K-dependent and FAK-independent fashion.', 'CCR9 and CCL25: A\xa0review of their roles in tumor promotion.', 'CCR9 in cancer: oncogenic role and therapeutic targeting.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'HER2-Specific Peptide (LTVSPWY) and Antibody (Herceptin) Targeted Core Cross-Linked Micelles for Breast Cancer: A Comparative Study.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'CCL25/CCR9 interaction promotes the malignant behavior of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Therapeutic potential of an anti-CCR9 mAb evidenced in xenografts of human CCR9+ tumors.']"""

We aim to identify genetic alterations and changes in expression of these genes in PC.  Methods:   PC cell lines, xenografts as well as clinical specimens were screened for mutations using denaturating high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing, and for expression alterations by using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Only known single nucleotide polymorphisms, but no mutations, were found in these genes. JHDMA2 mRNA expression was slightly increased (P < 0.05) in PC compared with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), whereas the expression of GASC1 was slightly higher (P < 0.05) in castration-resistant PC (CRPC) compared with untreated PC or BPH. The mRNA expression of LSD1 was not altered in PC. The expression of LSD1 protein was somewhat, although not statistically significantly (P = 0.0521) lower in CRPC compared with untreated PC. In prostatectomy specimens, the level of LSD1 protein expression was associated with low pT-stage (P = 0.0402), but not with Gleason score or progression-free survival.

These cells carry a number of defined markers: they are cd133 and cd44+ve and express high levels of alpha2beta1 integrin. In this study we have, for the first time, assessed matched primary and bone marrow biopsies from prostate cancer patients for the distribution of cells carrying these and a number of other putative stem cell markers.  Methods:   Eleven matched (primary and bone metastasis) specimens from prostate cancer patients were assessed for the presence of cd133, cd44, alpha2beta1 integrin, CXCR4, c-met, alpha6 integrin, and nestin using immunohistochemistry and stain intensity and distribution scored.  Results:   In the bone metastases, tumor cells staining positively for cd133 were detected at low frequency in approximately 50% of samples. Staining for nestin was confined to endothelium. Positive staining of tumor cells for the other antigens was present at variable frequency in >70% of metastases with the exception of CXCR4 which was absent from all but 2 specimens. Where positive staining of tumor cells was present in the metastasis, cells staining for each antigen were present in the matched primary with the exception of cd44 which was absent in all but 2/11 matched primary tissues.

This study aimed to elucidate whether Rheb promotes proliferation of prostate cancer cells and can act as a potent therapeutic target in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines and human prostatic tissues were examined for the expression of Rheb. The effects of forced expression or knockdown of Rheb on cell proliferation were also examined. Semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR were performed to evaluate mRNA expression. Western blotting was used to examine protein expression. Cell count and WST-1 assay were used to measure cell proliferation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to assess the cell cycle.  Results:   Rheb mRNA and protein expression was higher in more aggressive, androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145, and C4-2, compared with the less aggressive LNCaP. Rheb expression was higher in cancer tissues than in benign prostatic epithelia. Forced expression of Rheb in LNCaP cells accelerated proliferation without enhancing androgen receptor transactivity. Attenuation of Rheb expression or treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin decreased proliferation of PC3 and DU145 cells, with a decrease in the activated form of p70S6 kinase, one of the main targets of mTOR.  Conclusions:   Rheb potentiates proliferation of prostate cancer cells and inhibition of Rheb or mTOR can lead to suppressed proliferation of aggressive prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. Rheb and the mTOR pathway are therefore probable targets for suppressing prostate cancer.""","""['Takashi Kobayashi', 'Yosuke Shimizu', 'Naoki Terada', 'Toshinari Yamasaki', 'Eijiro Nakamura', 'Yoshinobu Toda', 'Hiroyuki Nishiyama', 'Toshiyuki Kamoto', 'Osamu Ogawa', 'Takahiro Inoue']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Androgens induce prostate cancer cell proliferation through mammalian target of rapamycin activation and post-transcriptional increases in cyclin D proteins.', 'A cross-talk between the androgen receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor leads to p38MAPK-dependent activation of mTOR and cyclinD1 expression in prostate and lung cancer cells.', 'Growth hormone (GH) receptors in prostate cancer: gene expression in human tissues and cell lines and characterization, GH signaling and androgen receptor regulation in LNCaP cells.', 'Mammalian target of rapamycin: a new target in prostate cancer.', 'Key mediators of intracellular amino acids signaling to mTORC1 activation.', 'HDAC6 Negatively Regulates miR-155-5p Expression to Elicit Proliferation by Targeting RHEB in Microvascular Endothelial Cells under Mechanical Unloading.', 'Associations between Statin/Omega3 Usage and MRI-Based Radiomics Signatures in Prostate Cancer.', 'Development of an autophagy-related gene expression signature for prognosis prediction in prostate cancer patients.', 'Overexpression of RHEB is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Will targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling work in hematopoietic malignancies?']"""

Our aim was to assess if the susceptibility of prostate cancer cells to apoptosis induced by either chemotherapeutics or radiotherapy was altered by changes in the ECM.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and DU145 (androgen independent) cells were treated with chemotherapeutics (ceramide and docetaxel) or radiotherapy in the presence or absence of fibronectin, laminin, or vitronectin. Cell death was assessed using Trypan blue cell counting and apoptosis was confirmed by measuring PARP cleavage by Western immunoblotting (WIB). To identify a mechanism of action, changes in the abundance (WIB) or association (immunoprecipitation followed by WIB) of key proteins was also assessed.  Results:   We found that fibronectin, but not laminin or vitronectin activated a survival pathway that protected DU145 but not LNCaP prostate cancer cells against ceramide and docetaxel-induced apoptosis but not that induced by radiotherapy. This survival effect involved the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and beta1 integrin receptors and was associated with an increase in the recruitment of the beta1 integrin to a complex containing the IGF-IR and protein receptor for activated C kinase (RACK-1) and an increase in the abundance of a MAPK-phosphatase-1 (MKP-1).  Conclusions:   Changes in the ECM associated with disease progression may contribute to resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs but not to radiation therapy.

The purpose of the current trial was to determine the tissue and blood effects of high-dose silybin-phytosome in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Subjects with localized prostate cancer planning for a prostatectomy were eligible to enroll. Six patients received 13 g of silybin-phytosome daily with six additional participants serving as control subjects.  Results:   Patients in the treatment arm received silybin-phytosome for 14-31 days (mean was 20 days) prior to surgery. Silibinin blood levels were measured 1 hr after the first silybin-phytosome dose with a mean value of 19.7 microM. Trough silibinin levels were assessed at the end of the trial with an average concentration of 1.2 microM. In contrast to the high peak levels of silibinin observed in blood, the highest silibinin level observed in the harvested prostate tissue was 496.6 pmol/g. There were no significant differences noted in baseline and post-treatment blood levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3. One of the treated patients developed a grade 4 post-operative thromboembolic event. The other observed toxicities in the treatment group were mild: four subjects had diarrhea and one had asymptomatic grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia which was transient.  Conclusions:   High-dose oral silybin-phytosome achieves high blood concentrations transiently, but low levels of silibinin are seen in prostate tissue.

Tumor growth is angiogenesis-dependent and the formation of new blood vessels is associated with the increased expression of angiogenic factors. Prostasomes are secretory granules produced, stored and released by the glandular epithelial cells of the prostate. We investigated the expression of selected angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors on the surface of prostasomes of different origins as well as the direct effect of prostasomes on angiogenesis.  Methods:   VEGF, endothelin-1, endostatin, and thrombospondin-1 were determined on prostasomes from seminal fluid and human prostate cancer cell lines (DU145,PC-3,LNCaP) using different immunochemical techniques. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were incubated with seminal and DU145 cell-prostasomes and with radioactive thymidine. The effect of prostasomes on angiogenesis was judged by measuring the uptake of labeled thymidine. The presence of any deleterious effects of prostasomes on the endothelial cells was investigated using thymidine assay and confocal laser microscopy.  Results:   VEGF and endothelin-1 were determined on malignant cell-prostasomes (no difference between cell lines) but not determined on seminal prostasomes. The same applies for the expression of endostatin but with much higher expression on malignant cell-prostasomes with obvious differences between them. Seminal and DU145 cell-prostasomes were found to have anti-angiogenic effect which was more expressed by DU145 cell-prostasomes.

Under normal conditions, in the absence of a ligand, the AR is localized to the cytoplasm and is actively transported into the nucleus upon binding of androgens. In advanced prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, an increased sensitivity to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), enabling the cells to proliferate under sub-physiological levels of androgens, has been associated with increased stability and nuclear localization of the AR. There is experimental evidence that the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase is involved in estrogen and AR stability. As demonstrated in the following study by immunoprecipitation analysis, GSK-3beta binds to the AR forming complexes in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK-3beta activity by pharmacological inhibitors like the maleimide SB216761, the chloromethyl-thienyl-ketone GSK-3 inhibitor VI or the aminopyrazol GSK-3 inhibitor XIII in cells grown in the presence of DHT triggered a rapid nuclear export of endogenous AR as well as of green fluorescent AR-EosFP. The nuclear export of AR following GSK-3beta inhibition could be blocked by leptomycin B suggesting a CRM1-dependent export mechanism. This assumption is supported by the localization of a putative CRM1 binding site at the C-terminus of the AR protein. The results suggest that GSK-3beta is an important element not only in AR stability but also significantly alters nuclear translocation of the AR, thereby modulating the androgenic response of human PCa cells.""","""['Stefanie V Schütz', 'Marcus V Cronauer', 'Ludwig Rinnab']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β counteracts ligand-independent activity of the androgen receptor in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta activity is required for androgen-stimulated gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines: are GSK inhibitors therapeutically useful?', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export sensitizes malignant cells to cytotoxic and targeted agents.', 'Androgen receptor transcriptional activity is required for heregulin-1β-mediated nuclear localization of the HER3/ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase.', 'Re-Expression of ERα and AR in Receptor Negative Endocrine Cancers via GSK3 Inhibition.', 'Transportin-2 plays a critical role in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of oestrogen receptor-α.', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β in Cancer Biology and Treatment.', 'A nuclear shift of GSK3β protein is an independent prognostic factor in prostate cancer.']"""

Furthermore, Par-4 protein has been shown to function as an effector of cell death in response to various apoptotic stimuli that trigger mitochondria and membrane receptor-mediated cell death pathways. In this study, we investigated how Par-4 modulates TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant Caki cells. Par-4 overexpressing cells were strikingly sensitive to apoptosis induced by TRAIL compared with control cells. Par-4 overexpressing Caki cells treated with TRAIL showed an increased activation of the initiator caspase-8 and the effector caspase-3, together with an enforced cleavage of XIAP and c-FLIP. TRAIL-induced reduction of XIAP and c-FLIP protein levels in Par-4 overexpressing cells was prevented by z-VAD pretreatment. In addition, the surface DR5 protein level was increased in TRAIL-treated Par-4 overexpressing cells. Interestingly, even though a deletion of leucine zipper domain in Par-4 recovered Bcl-2 level to basal level induced by wild type Par-4, it partly decreased sensitivity to TRAIL in Caki cells. In addition, exposure of Caki/Par-4 cells to TRAIL led to reduction of phosphorylated Akt levels, but deletion of leucine zipper domain of Par-4 did not affect these phosphorylated Akt levels.

Material and methods:   Using patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with iodine-125 ((125)I) or palladium-103 ((103)Pd) as an example, it is shown how a patient, if necessary or wished by him, can, by wearing commercially available X-ray protection shorts, reduce radiation exposure of family members in such a way that at a distance r from the patient a given dose per year is not exceeded.  Results:   The computational procedures necessary for the determination of the individual periods of wearing X-ray protection clothing are provided in the form of formulae and graphics. All considerations and calculations can also be applied to other radiotherapeutic interventions involving the use of (125)I, (103)Pd or other gamma-sources.  Conclusion:   If necessary, a patient with permanent radioactive implants can reduce radiation exposure of family members by wearing special X-ray protection clothing for a limited period of time.

The purpose of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for AR activation by Vav3. We found that interaction between N-terminus and C-terminus of AR is essential for its elevated activity stimulated by Vav3. The DH and PH domains of Vav3 are involved in direct interaction with AR. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of AR and Vav3 are elevated and their nuclear localization is further stimulated by DHT in androgen-independent LNCaP-AI cells relative to their parental androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Vav3 is colocalized with AR, phospho(P)-Akt, and HER2 with a short term stimulation by EGF and DHT. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocks colocalization of Vav3 with P-Akt. Consistently, EGF and DHT stimulate Vav3 and AR interaction and enhance PI3K-Akt signaling. Mutation of tyrosines to phenylalanines in the acidic domain or deletion of the SH2 and SH3 domains significantly enhances Vav3 ability for AR activation, while deletion of the DH domain abolishes this activity. Given that an elevated interaction of Vav3 with AR, P-Akt, and HER2 in both cytoplasm and nucleus upon the short-term of DHT stimulation, our data suggest that Vav3 may enhance non-genomic AR activity via PI3K-Akt signaling in addition to AR transcriptional activity and further support a role in androgen-independent growth in prostate cancer.""","""['Yin Liu', 'Xiaoyang Wu', 'Zhongyun Dong', 'Shan Lu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Vav3 oncogene is overexpressed and regulates cell growth and androgen receptor activity in human prostate cancer.', 'Vav3, a Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor, increases during progression to androgen independence in prostate cancer cells and potentiates androgen receptor transcriptional activity.', 'A novel nuclear role for the Vav3 nucleotide exchange factor in androgen receptor coactivation in prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of prostate cancer cell survival after inhibition of AR expression.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Fatty acids homeostasis during fasting predicts protection from chemotherapy toxicity.', 'Inhibition of Vav3 gene can promote apoptosis of human gastric cancer cell line MGC803 by regulating ERK pathway.', 'Genome-wide association study of susceptibility loci for breast cancer in Sardinian population.', 'Vav family exchange factors: an integrated regulatory and functional view.', 'Inhibition of Vav3 could reverse the drug resistance of gastric cancer cells by downregulating JNK signaling pathway.']"""

Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, androgen ablation fails to permanently arrest cancer progression. As androgens like testosterone are withdrawn, prostate cancer cells lose their androgen sensitivity and begin to proliferate without hormone growth factors. In this study, we constructed and analyzed a mathematical model of the integration between hormone growth factor signaling, androgen receptor activation, and the expression of cyclin D and Prostate-Specific Antigen in human LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. The objective of the study was to investigate which signaling systems were important in the loss of androgen dependence. The model was formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations which described 212 species and 384 interactions, including both the mRNA and protein levels for key species. An ensemble approach was chosen to constrain model parameters and to estimate the impact of parametric uncertainty on model predictions. Model parameters were identified using 14 steady-state and dynamic LNCaP data sets taken from literature sources. Alterations in the rate of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase expression was sufficient to capture varying levels of androgen dependence. Analysis of the model provided insight into the importance of network components as a function of androgen dependence. The importance of androgen receptor availability and the MAPK/Akt signaling axes was independent of androgen status. Interestingly, androgen receptor availability was important even in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Translation became progressively more important in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Further analysis suggested a positive synergy between the MAPK and Akt signaling axes and the translation of key proliferative markers like cyclin D in androgen-independent cells. Taken together, the results support the targeting of both the Akt and MAPK pathways. Moreover, the analysis suggested that direct targeting of the translational machinery, specifically eIF4E, could be efficacious in androgen-independent prostate cancers.""","""['Ryan Tasseff', 'Satyaprakash Nayak', 'Saniya Salim', 'Poorvi Kaushik', 'Noreen Rizvi', 'Jeffrey D Varner']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase is overexpressed in the conditioned medium and the extract of LNCaP lineaged androgen independent cell lines and facilitates prostate cancer progression.', 'Role of coordinated molecular alterations in the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer: an in vitro model that corroborates clinical observations.', 'Androgen regulation of the messenger RNA encoding diazepam-binding inhibitor/acyl-CoA-binding protein in the human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP.', 'Sex steroid hormone metabolism and prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in prostate cancer.', 'Toward a genome scale sequence specific dynamic model of cell-free protein synthesis in Escherichia coli.', 'Galeterone and The Next Generation Galeterone Analogs, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3β Exert Potent Therapeutic Effects in Castration-/Drug-Resistant Prostate Cancer Preclinical Models In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'Reduced order modeling and analysis of the human complement system.', 'JuPOETs: a constrained multiobjective optimization approach to estimate biochemical model ensembles in the Julia programming language.', 'Steroid hormone receptors and prostate cancer: role of structural dynamics in therapeutic targeting.']"""

However, because of the multiple effects of different BMPs, no final conclusions have been made as to the role of BMPs in PCa. In our studies, we have focused on BMP-7 because it is involved in prostate morphogenesis, and its expression is regulated by androgens. The objective of our study was to determine BMP-7 expression in PCa metastases and investigate the effects of BMP-7 on PCa cells. Our results show that BMP-7 is expressed in metastatic PCa and its levels are increased in castration-resistant PCa versus androgen-dependent PCa, whereas the expression of BMP-7 is decreased in primary PCa versus normal prostate. Our in vitro results show that BMP-7 inhibits proliferation of androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells, stimulates androgen receptor signaling, increases the expression of differentiation-associated genes, and decreases the levels of some wingless-regulated transcripts. Interestingly, these effects were not detected in C4-2 castration-resistant PCa cells. In vivo expression of BMP-7 in castration-resistant C4-2 cells did not alter proliferation when these cells were grown subcutaneously, but their growth was inhibited in the bone environment. In summary, our results show that BMP-7 is expressed at the highest level in advanced castration-resistant PCa cells and that the inhibitory effects of BMP-7 are dependent on the differentiation status of PCa cells and the tumor microenvironment.

Similarly, prostate cancer (PCa) cells express the annexin II receptor and seem to use the stem cell niche for homing to the bone marrow. The role of the niche is thought to be the induction and sustenance of HSC dormancy. If metastatic PCa cells occupy a similar or the same ecological niche as HSCs, then it is likely that the initial role of the HSC niche will be to induce dormancy in metastatic cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the binding of PCa to annexin II induces the expression of the growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6) receptors AXL, Sky, and Mer, which, in the hematopoietic system, induce dormancy. In addition, GAS6 produced by osteoblasts prevents PCa proliferation and protects PCa from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.

Instead of adding a smoothing item to the objective function, we add the total number of monitor unit (TNMU) requirement directly to the constraints which serves as an important factor to balance the fluence map optimization and leaf sequencing optimization process at the same time. Consequently, we formulate the fluence map optimization models for the trailing (left) leaf synchronized, leading (right) leaf synchronized and the interleaf motion constrained non-synchronized leaf sweeping schemes, respectively. In those schemes, the leaves are all swept unidirectionally from left to right. Each of those models is turned into a linear constrained quadratic programming model which can be solved effectively by the interior point method. Those new models are evaluated with two publicly available clinical treatment datasets including a head-neck case and a prostate case. As shown by the empirical results, our models perform much better in comparison with two recently emerged smoothing models (the total variance smoothing model and the quadratic smoothing model). For all three leaf sweeping schemes, our objective dose deviation functions increase much slower than those in the above two smoothing models with respect to the decreasing of the TNMU.

Follow-up started from the date of prostate cancer diagnosis to the end of first 12 calendar months after diagnosis. The relative risks of suicide and cardiovascular death were calculated as standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) comparing corresponding incidences among prostate cancer patients with those of the general US male population, with adjustment for age, calendar period, and state of residence. We compared risks in the first year and months after a prostate cancer diagnosis. The analyses were further stratified by calendar period at diagnosis, tumor characteristics, and other variables.  Results:   During follow-up, 148 men died of suicide (mortality rate = 0.5 per 1000 person-years) and 6845 died of cardiovascular diseases (mortality rate = 21.8 per 1000 person-years). Patients with prostate cancer were at increased risk of suicide during the first year (SMR = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2 to 1.6), especially during the first 3 months (SMR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4 to 2.6), after diagnosis. The elevated risk was apparent in pre-prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (1979-1986) and peri-PSA (1987-1992) eras but not since PSA testing has been widespread (1993-2004). The risk of cardiovascular death was slightly elevated during the first year (SMR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.12), with the highest risk in the first month (SMR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.89 to 2.22), after diagnosis. The first-month risk was statistically significantly elevated during the entire study period, and the risk was higher for patients with metastatic tumors (SMR = 3.22, 95% CI = 2.68 to 3.84) than for those with local or regional tumors (SMR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.42 to 1.74).

Recent studies suggest that gossypol, a bioactive phytochemical produced by cotton plants, is a promising agent against prostate cancer. The current studies were undertaken to examine the chemotherapeutic efficacy of gossypol on human prostate cancer cell lines and prostate tumor-initiating cells. Gossypol reduced the viability of three prostate cancer cell lines (LAPC4, PC3, and DU145) with an IC(50) between 3 and 5 micromol/L. Additionally, gossypol was effective at inhibiting prostate tumor-initiating cell-driven tumor growth in a nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient xenograft model. Our integrated molecular profiling approach encompassing proteomics, activated transcription factors, and genomics suggests that the decrease in viability was associated with increased DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis. Exposure of DU145 cells to gossypol (1-10 micromol/L) resulted in the activation of 13 proteins and 7 transcription factors, and the expression of 17 genes involved in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. These studies show for the first time that gossypol treatment induces DNA damage and activates p53.

We detected point mutations in Keap1 gene, leading to nonconservative amino acid substitutions in prostate cancer cells. We found novel transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms of Keap1 inactivation, such as promoter CpG island hypermethylation and aberrant splicing of Keap1, in DU-145 cells. Very low levels of Keap1 mRNA were detected in DU-145 cells, which significantly increased by treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine. The loss of Keap1 function led to an enhanced activity of Nrf2 and its downstream electrophile/drug detoxification pathway. Inhibition of Nrf2 expression in DU-145 cells by RNA interference attenuated the expression of glutathione, thioredoxin, and the drug efflux pathways involved in counteracting electrophiles, oxidative stress, and detoxification of a broad spectrum of drugs. DU-145 cells constitutively expressing Nrf2 short hairpin RNA had lower levels of total glutathione and higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Attenuation of Nrf2 function in DU-145 cells enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation-induced cell death. In addition, inhibition of Nrf2 greatly suppressed in vitro and in vivo tumor growth of DU-145 prostate cancer cells.

One such strategy, telomerase interference, exploits the high telomerase activity in cancer cells and reprograms telomerase to encode ""toxic"" telomeres. To date, telomerase interference has been tested in human cancer cells xenografted into mice, an approach that does not recapitulate spontaneous malignancy and offers few insights about host toxicities, because human telomerase is targeted in a mouse host. To address these limitations, we designed and validated two new gene constructs specifically targeting mouse telomerase: mutant template mouse telomerase RNA (MT-mTer) and small interfering RNA against wild-type mouse telomerase RNA (α-mTer-siRNA). Using lentiviral delivery in mouse prostate cancer cells, we achieved α-mTer-siRNA-mediated knockdown of wild-type mTer (80% depletion) and concurrent overexpression of MT-mTer (50-fold). We showed that the two constructs effectively synergize to reprogram murine telomerase to add mutant instead of wild-type telomeric repeats, resulting in rapid telomeric uncapping (5-fold increase in DNA damage foci). This, in turn, led to rapid and significant apoptosis (>90% of cells) and growth inhibition in vitro (90% reduction in viable cell mass) and in vivo (75% reduction in tumor allograft wet weight). In summary, we have shown that mouse cancer cells are vulnerable to direct telomerase interference using novel murine telomerase-targeting constructs; this approach can now be used to study the true therapeutic potential of telomerase interference in mouse spontaneous cancer models.""","""['Tong Xu', 'Yucheng Xu', 'Chun-Peng Liao', 'Roy Lau', 'Amir Goldkorn']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Assembly of mutant-template telomerase RNA into catalytically active telomerase ribonucleoprotein that can act on telomeres is required for apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human cancer cells.', 'Antitumor activity of systemically delivered ribozymes targeting murine telomerase RNA.', 'ATM mediates cytotoxicity of a mutant telomerase RNA in human cancer cells.', 'siRNA targeting telomerase--effective tool in anti-cancer therapy?.', 'Overcoming the immortality of tumour cells by telomere and telomerase based cancer therapeutics--current status and future prospects.', 'Telomere and Telomerase Therapeutics in Cancer.', 'Circulating tumor cell telomerase activity as a prognostic marker for overall survival in SWOG 0421: a phase III metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer trial.', 'Cancer cells cyclically lose and regain drug-resistant highly tumorigenic features characteristic of a cancer stem-like phenotype.', 'Prostate tumor cells with cancer progenitor properties have high telomerase activity and are rapidly killed by telomerase interference.', 'A cancer detection platform which measures telomerase activity from live circulating tumor cells captured on a microfilter.']"""

Yet the use of finasteride remains low, likely because of the risk of adverse effects. We sought to determine whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels could identify a high-risk subgroup for which the benefits of finasteride treatment outweigh the potential harms. PATIENTS AND METHODS Raw data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial were used to model chemopreventive treatment strategies: treat all men, treat no men, or treat a high-risk subgroup based on PSA level. We weighted the benefits (reduction in cancer rate) and harms (treatment rate) of each strategy using numbers-needed-to-treat thresholds-the maximum number of men a clinician would treat with finasteride to prevent one cancer. Results Of 9,058 men, 1,957 were diagnosed with prostate cancer during the 7-year study. For the end point of all cancers, including both for-cause and end-of-study biopsies, the optimal strategy is to treat all or nearly all men. To reduce risk of cancers detected through routine care, treating men with PSA > 1.3 or > 2 ng/mL is optimal. For example, treating only men with PSA > 2 ng/mL reduced the treatment rate by 83% and resulted in a cancer rate only 1.1% higher than treating all men. CONCLUSION Clinicians wishing to reduce the risk of any biopsy-detectable prostate cancer should recommend finasteride to all men. Clinicians who believe that it is unnecessary to prevent all cancers, but that preventing those readily detectable by screening would be desirable, would be best off recommending finasteride only to a high-risk subgroup.""","""['Andrew J Vickers', 'Caroline J Savage', 'Hans Lilja']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Optimizing finasteride chemoprevention.', 'Chemotherapy: Optimizing finasteride chemoprevention for prostate cancer.', 'Five-alpha-reductase Inhibitors for prostate cancer prevention.', 'Long-term effects of finasteride on prostate specific antigen levels: results from the prostate cancer prevention trial.', 'Does the level of prostate cancer risk affect cancer prevention with finasteride?', 'The effect of finasteride on the prostate gland in men with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen levels.', 'Prostate cancer prevention and finasteride.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagic and apoptotic cell death, and immune activation by a natural triterpenoid in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Possible association between androgenic alopecia and risk of prostate cancer and testicular germ cell tumor: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Decision analysis of dutasteride use for patients with negative prostate biopsy.', 'Ganoderic Acid DM: An Alternative Agent for the Treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer.', ""Chinese urologists' views of practice patterns in the diagnosis and treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: a nationwide survey.""]"""

METHODS Data were analyzed from 36 clinical sites that contributed data to the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) registry. Distribution of primary treatment use was measured over time. Prostate cancer risk was assessed using the D'Amico risk groups and the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score. Descriptive analyses were performed, and a hierarchical model was constructed that controlled for year of diagnosis, cancer risk variables, and other patient factors to estimate the proportion of variation in primary treatment selection explicable by practice site. Results Among 11,892 men analyzed, 6.8% elected surveillance, 49.9% prostatectomy, 11.6% external-beam radiation, 13.3% brachytherapy, 4.0% cryoablation, and 14.4% androgen deprivation monotherapy. Prostate cancer risk drives treatment selection, but the data suggest both overtreatment of low-risk disease and undertreatment of high-risk disease. The former trend appears to be improving over time, while the latter is worsening. Treatment varies with age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status. However, treatment patterns vary markedly across clinical sites, and this variation is not explained by case-mix variability or known patient factors. Practice site explains a proportion of this variation ranging from 13% for androgen deprivation monotherapy to 74% for cryoablation.

Differentiation of MCF10A cells into three-dimensional acini results in the redistribution of maspin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but does not result in secretion. Addition of an efficient conventional signal peptide to maspin directs it into the secretory pathway and results in glycosylation but not secretion. We further show that maspin in the cytoplasm of MCF10A cells is a soluble monomeric protein that is not detectably associated with the cytoskeleton or other extractable components.

In this study, we analyzed clinical characteristics of patients with prostate cancer diagnosed in France in 2001 with a focus on therapeutic management of localized prostate cancers.  Patients and methods:   A total of 2181 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 2001 from 11 French counties covered by a cancer registry were analyzed. A descriptive study of the clinical characteristics of patients was performed. Parameters studied included age, county, TNM stage, PSA value, Gleason score, D'Amico prognostic group, Charlson's comorbidity index and initial treatment modalities. For localized cancers, multivariate logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with radical prostatectomy.  Results:   The proportion of localized prostate cancer (T1 or T2) was 86.6 %. The use of invasive curative treatment (radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy) was 58.4 % for localized cancers. Significant differences in therapeutic management were found between counties. Radical prostatectomy was associated with age at diagnosis, D'Amico prognostic group and the presence of comorbidities.

We present preliminary results following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment for organ-confined prostate cancer.  Methods:   SBRT was performed on 304 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer: 50 received 5 fractions of 7 Gy (total dose 35 Gy) and 254 received 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy (total dose 36.25 Gy). Acute and late toxicity was assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire was used to assess QOL. Prostate-specific antigen response was monitored.  Results:   At a median 30-month (26 - 37 month, range) follow-up there were no biochemical failures for the 35-Gy dose level. Acute Grade II urinary and rectal toxicities occurred in 4% of patients with no higher Grade acute toxicities. One Grade II late urinary toxicity occurred with no other Grade II or higher late toxicities. At a median 17-month (8 - 27 month, range) follow-up the 36.25 Gy dose level had 2 low- and 2 high-risk patients fail biochemically (biopsy showed 2 low- and 1 high-risk patients were disease-free in the gland). Acute Grade II urinary and rectal toxicities occurred in 4.7% (12/253) and 3.6% (9/253) of patients, respectively. For those patients with a minimum of 12 months follow-up, 5.8% (12/206) had late Grade II urinary toxicity and 2.9% (6/206) had late Grade II rectal toxicities. One late Grade III urinary toxicity occurred; no Grade IV toxicities occurred. For both dose levels at 17 months, bowel and urinary QOL returned to baseline values; sexual QOL decreased by 10%.  Conclusions:   The low toxicity and maintained QOL are highly encouraging.

We therefore described and compared symptoms, care needs and types of cancer sites in 2002 compared to 2007 and analysed the relationships between these factors.  Methods:   The study was population-based with a cross-sectional design and was carried out in medical, surgical and oncology wards in two acute care hospitals with no advanced palliative home care service. In 2002, 82 one-day-inventories were done (1 352 patients) compared to 142 one-day-inventories in 2007 (2 972 patients). Symptoms, care needs and cancer site were registered according to a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression models were used to analyse associations between symptoms, care needs and cancer site.  Results:   The proportion of palliative cancer patients had decreased during a five year period (14% vs. 11%, p<0.01). The patients were older in 2007 (74 vs. 70 years, p<0.001) and had more symptoms and care needs per patient (2.6 vs. 1.6, p<0.001). The most common symptoms were pain and deterioration and the most common cancer sites were prostate and colorectal cancer in both samples. Associations between symptoms, care needs and cancer site were mostly weak. Deterioration was associated with colorectal cancer, whereas pain was not associated with any specific cancer site. In haematological malignancies there was a high occurrence of infections and a high need of blood transfusions and infusions. Stomach/oesophagus cancers were significantly associated with nausea, nutritional problems and need of infusions while unknown primary malignancies were associated with abdominal surgery and infusions.  Discussion:   Although we do not know all the causes for hospitalization, this study indicates that more focus should be on the symptoms instead of the specific cancer diagnosis. The findings also indicate that many palliative cancer patients' problems would be suitable for advanced palliative home care instead of acute hospital care.""","""['Anna Sandgren', 'Bengt Fridlund', 'Per Nyberg', 'Peter Strang', 'Kerstin Petersson', 'Hans Thulesius']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""[]"""

In prostate cancer, however, the expression of AnxA2 is lost in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and reappears in the high-grade tumors, suggesting a complex regulation of AnxA2 in the prostate microenvironment. Since a majority of the biological functions of AnxA2 are mediated by its interaction with other proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to search for novel interactors of AnxA2. Our studies revealed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), a member of the STAT family of transcription factors, is a binding partner of AnxA2. We confirmed AnxA2-STAT6 interaction by in vitro co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies and demonstrated that AnxA2 interacts with phosphorylated STAT6. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that AnxA2 is associated with the STAT6 DNA-binding complex, and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that AnxA2 upregulates the activity of STAT6. Upon interleukin-4 treatment, AnxA2 stabilizes the cytosolic levels of phosphorylated STAT6 and promotes its nuclear entry. These findings suggest that AnxA2-STAT6 interactions could have potential implications in prostate cancer progression.

Alpha 1 antitrypsin is a highly polymorphic anti-elastase enzyme, especially active in the protection of alveoli and liver. In the present study, we observed the distribution of two deficient alleles PiZ and Pi S in COPD patients. We extracted the DNA from 157 prostate cancer cases, 200 COPD patients, 170 BPH and 370 healthy controls. The polymorphisms were studied by PCR-RFLP technique. The mutant genotype (Leu/Leu) of HPC/ELAC-2 was present in 9.6, 7.6 and 5.9% of BPH, cancer cases and healthy controls, respectively. Higher risk of Ser/Leu as well as Leu/Leu had shown when compared to healthy controls. That was about 1.5 and 1.7-fold (OR = 1.55; 95% CI = 0.96-2.51; OR = 1.70; 95% CI = 0.74-3.92), respectively. Risk was found to be increased in smokers and those consuming non-vegetarian diet. Our results suggest that the HPC/ELAC-2 polymorphisms, especially in localized cases, could help to predict prostate cancer risk and confirm its high prevalence of the leu/leu allele in north Indian population. Considering heterozygous PiZ genotype, we obtained an OR of 3.82 (P = 0.03).

However, radioresistance occurs in nearly 30% of patients treated with potentially curative doses. Therapeutic synergy between radiotherapy and androgen ablation treatment provides a promising strategy for improving the clinical outcome. Accordingly, the androgen deprivation-induced signaling pathway may also mediate radiosensitivity in PCa cells. The C4-2 cell line was derived from the androgen-sensitive LNCaP parent line under androgen-depleted condition and had acquired androgen-refractory characteristics. In our study, the response to radiation was evaluated in both LNCaP and C4-2. Results showed that C4-2 cells were more likely to survive from irradiation and appeared more aggressive in their resistance to radiation treatment compared with LNCaP, as measured by clonogenic assays and cell viability and cell cycle analyses. Gene expression analyses revealed that a set of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair were differentially regulated in LNCaP and C4-2 in response to radiation, which was also consistent with the radiation-resistant property observed in C4-2 cells. These results strongly suggested that the radiation-resistant property may develop with progression of PCa to androgen-independent status.

From these remaining cases we identified one case with NDRG1 rearrangement. We did not observe any associations with pathologic parameters or clinical outcome. This is the first study to describe the frequency of SLC45A3-ERG fusions in a large clinical cohort. Most studies have assumed that all ERG rearranged prostate cancers harbor TMPRSS2-ERG fusions. This is also the first study to report concurrent TMPRSS2 and SLC45A3 rearrangements in the same tumor focus, suggesting additional complexity that had not been previously appreciated. This study has important clinical implications for the development of diagnostic assays to detect ETS rearranged prostate cancer. Incorporation of these less common ERG rearranged prostate cancer fusion assays could further increase the sensitivity of the current PCR-based approaches.""","""['Raquel Esgueva', 'Sven Perner', 'Christopher J LaFargue', 'Veit Scheble', 'Carsten Stephan', 'Michael Lein', 'Florian R Fritzsche', 'Manfred Dietel', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Mark A Rubin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is fused to ERG in prostate cancer.', 'Loss of SLC45A3 protein (prostein) expression in prostate cancer is associated with SLC45A3-ERG gene rearrangement and an unfavorable clinical course.', 'ETS family-associated gene fusions in Japanese prostate cancer: analysis of 194 radical prostatectomy samples.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Etiology of oncogenic fusions in 5,190 childhood cancers and its clinical and therapeutic implication.', 'Systematic Analysis of Cellular Signaling Pathways and Therapeutic Targets for SLC45A3:ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Comprehensive assessment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase in localized and metastatic prostate cancer reveals targetable alterations.', 'Diagnostic utility of immunohistochemical markers alpha methyl acyl coA racemase (AMACR) and Ets related gene (ERG) in prostate cancer.', 'Profile of chimeric RNAs and TMPRSS2-ERG e2e4 isoform in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   Sarcosine was measured in urine samples from 106 PCa patients and 33 patients with no evidence of malignancy (NEM), confirmed by 8-12 core prostate biopsies, after standardised digital rectal examination, as well as from 12 healthy men and women. The results were related to the clinicopathologic data on prostate volume, tumour stage, Gleason score, and prostate specific antigen (PSA).  Measurements:   Sarcosine in urine was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a commercial amino acid assay and was normalised to urine creatinine. Nonparametric statistical tests and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to assess the diagnostic performance.  Results and limitations:   The median sarcosine-creatinine ratio in urine was 13% lower in PCa than in NEM patients. Sarcosine values were not associated with tumour stage (pT2 vs pT3) or grade (Gleason score <7 vs > or = 7). ROC analyses proved that the discrimination between PCa and NEM patients was not improved by sarcosine in comparison with total PSA, but it was significantly worse than the percent free PSA.

Seeds of strength 0.39mCi were placed in a modified peripheral loading pattern to deliver 145Gy to the target volume. MR images consisted of 3-4mm thick axial slices with no gap. The image sets were anonymized and randomized to minimize contouring bias, then contoured by a single radiation oncologist. Contours were reoriented about their center of mass to align the prostate long axis with the superior-inferior (S-I) direction; prostate volumes and dimensions in the left-right (L-R), anterior-posterior (A-P), and S-I directions through the center of mass were calculated.  Results:   The average relative edema volume was 1.18±0.14 (1standard deviation) on Day 0 and 1.01±0.15 on Day 30. Between Days 0 and 30, the edema resolved linearly with time on average.

What disclosed that PCA3 mRNA is prostate cancer specific and shows increased expression in prostate cancer. It could be a reliable molecular marker in prostate cancer diagnosis. Exon 3-based real-time FQ-RT-PCR may prove useful in prostate cancer diagnosis, given that the associated primer would span only exons 1 and 3, relative to other models spanning exons 1 to 4. A shorter amplicon would not only enhance the efficiency of real-time FQ-RT-PCR, but may also simplify the quantification of PCA3 mRNA.""","""['Zhihua Tao', 'Mo Shen', 'Yanbo Zheng', 'Xiaolu Mao', 'Zhanguo Chen', 'Yibing Yin', 'Kaiyuan Yu', 'Zhiliang Weng', 'Hui Xie', 'Chengdi Li', 'Xiuling Wu', 'Yuanping Hu', 'Xiaohua Zhang', 'Ouchen Wang', 'Qitong Song', 'Zhixian Yu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['The diagnostic value of PCA3 gene-based analysis of urine sediments after digital rectal examination for prostate cancer in a Chinese population.', 'Differential display code 3 (DD3/PCA3) in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Long noncoding RNA PCA3 gene promoter region is related to the risk of prostate cancer on Chinese males.', 'New targets for therapy in prostate cancer: differential display code 3 (DD3(PCA3)), a highly prostate cancer-specific gene.', 'The use of PCA3 in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative Real-Time Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes in Peripheral Blood Samples of Hypertension Patients.', 'Prostatic aspirated cellular RNA analysis enables fast diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer antigen 3 moderately improves diagnostic accuracy in Chinese patients undergoing first prostate biopsy.', 'Function of PCA3 in prostate tissue and clinical research progress on developing a PCA3 score.', 'Association of short tandem repeat polymorphism in the promoter of prostate cancer antigen 3 gene with the risk of prostate cancer.']"""

The experience of the Urology Clinic of Prof. Dr. Th. Burghele Clinical Hospital""","""Introduction:   radical prostatectomy remains a real challenge for most of the urologists. Our study's objective is bringing into discussion the main aspects related to the technique we use, the intra and post-operatory complications, as well as the short-term analysis of the results in PC treatment using RP in the Prof. Dr. Th. Burghele Clinical Hospital - Clinic of Urology.  Material and methods:   between 1999 and 2007, 59 patients with PC, aged 48-74, were operated in our clinic. We began to recommend prostate biopsy (PB) to all patients with PSA higher than 4 ng/ml and, in the last years, higher than 2,5 ng/ml. A change in our attitude is related to the PB. At the beginning, we tried to perform ""targeted"" punctions, ultrasound guided especially in suspect zones, afterwards, we performed randomised punctions at all the patients, no matter the aspect of TRUS and we have increased the number of punctions accordingly to the prostate volume (minimum 6 punctions, maximum 12). The most used was the 10 core punction. The T classification, according to the clinical diagnosis, of the 59 operated patients: T1 cT1 a-b--4 cases; cT1 c--39 cases; T2 cT2 a--12 cases; cT2 b-c--4 cases. The RP surgical technique was the classic one, described by P.C. Walsh--the first surgical step, in all cases was lymphadenectomy.  Results:   of all the patients that went through RP, 56 cases are still in our records. We can consider healed 24 patients with PC, followed for 3 years post-surgery, because they had no need of therapy and the PSA is maintained below 0.02 ng/ml. The Gleason score--between the pre-operatory established diagnosis by punction and the anatomic-pathological examination of the piece, there were some differences: the concordance was in 48% of the cases; in 39% of the patients, the biopsy specimen had a lower Gleason score than the surgery specimen, and in 13% a higher score, the most common error was caused by sampling. The correlation between the pre-operatory evaluated clinical stage and the pathological clinical stage was of 57%. The most important late postoperative complications of RP were: urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In our study, we have recorded late postoperative: complete urinary incontinence in 4 cases (6.7%), erection was maintained after bilateral preservation of neurovascular bandelets in 90% of cases and after unilateral preservation in 71% of cases. Due to the short following period, we can't say if the operated patients by us had a benefit regarding the general surviving period; The personalized interpretation of the increase of serum PSA levels after surgery represents a possible problem regarding the indication of complementary treatment.""","""['V Ambert', 'B Braticevici', 'D Damian', 'I Chira', 'V Iconaru', 'T Radu', 'T Constantin']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""J Med Life""","""['Cribriform morphology predicts upstaging after radical prostatectomy in patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer at transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided needle biopsy.', 'Functional and oncological outcome of salvage prostatectomy of locally recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy.', 'Combined reporting of cancer control and functional results of radical prostatectomy.', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'A Critical Analysis of the Current Knowledge of Surgical Anatomy of the Prostate Related to Optimisation of Cancer Control and Preservation of Continence and Erection in Candidates for Radical Prostatectomy: An Update.']"""

Method:   the study was based on the Airtum database, which collects and checks data from all the Airtum registries. The present study was based on 20 general and 2 specific populationbased cancer registries. Overall, we analysed 818,017 incident cases and 342,444 cancer deaths for the time period 1998-2005. Seventy percent of the analysed population was from the North of Italy, 17% from the Centre, and 13% from the South. A joinpoint analysis was carried out to detect the point in time where the trend changed; trends are described by means of the estimated annual percent change (APC), with appropriate 95% confidence intervals. Crude and standardized incidence and mortality rates were computed for 36 cancer sites, for both sexes, three age-classes (0-49, 50-69 and 70+ years), and three geographic areas (North, Centre, and South of Italy). Specific chapters are devoted to long-term trends (1986-2005), differences among age-groups, and international comparisons.  Results:   In 1998-2005, cancer mortality for all sites showed a statistically significant decrease among men (APC - 1.7) and women (- 0.8). Mortality significantly decreased in both sexes for stomach cancer, rectum cancer, liver cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Mortality also decreased among men for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, oesophagus, lung, prostate, urinary bladder, and leukaemia. Among women mortality decreased for cancers of the colon, bone, breast, and uterus not otherwise specified. An increase in mortality was recorded for lung cancer among women (+1.5) and melanoma among men (+2.6). Incidence for all cancers together (except non-melanoma skin cancers) increased among men (APC +0.3) and remained stable among women. Cancer sites which showed increasing incidence were thyroid and melanoma in both sexes, colon, testis, soft tissue among men, and lung and Hodgkin lymphoma among women. For several cancer sites incidence decreased, e.g., stomach and Kaposi sarcoma (men and women), upper aerodigestive tract, oesophagus, lung, urinary bladder, myeloma and leukaemia (men), gallbladder, cervix uteri and ovary (women).  Conclusions:   this monograph presents a detailed description of cancer incidence and mortality trends in Italy. It is based on the Italian Network of Cancer Registries which presently covers about one-third of the whole Italian population.

Methods:   Data from 140 men with prostate cancer enrolled in a Phase 2 clinical trial of selenium to prevent prostate cancer progression were analyzed to determine association between aspirin, other NSAIDs, or statin use with baseline serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and PSA velocity (rate of PSA change over time) using repeated measures over an average follow-up time of 3.2 years. Multiple linear regression and mixed effects models were used to model the association of medication use with PSA at baseline and with PSA velocity, respectively.  Results:   Baseline PSA levels were significantly lower in aspirin users compared to non-users (5.17 ng/ml vs. 7.58 ng/ml, P = 0.001). This association was statistically significant in never smokers (aspirin users vs. non-users: 4.19 ng/ml vs. 8.24 ng/ml, P = 0.004) but not in ever smokers (aspirin users vs. non-users: 5.52 ng/ml vs. 7.3 ng/ml, P = 0.101). Statin and other NSAID use was not associated with baseline PSA. Aspirin, statin, or other NSAID use at baseline demonstrated a non-significant negative association with PSA velocity.  Conclusion:   These findings support an effect of aspirin use on PSA, particularly among never smokers. However, they do not suggest a protective effect on the disease and support previous findings that aspirin use may mask accurate measurement of PSA warranting consideration of washout procedures prior to testing.""","""['Amit M Algotar', 'Patricia A Thompson', 'James Ranger-Moore', 'M Suzanne Stratton', 'Chiu-Hsieh Hsu', 'Frederick R Ahmann', 'Raymond B Nagle', 'Steven P Stratton']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Chronic use of NSAIDs and/or statins does not affect PSA or PSA velocity in men at high risk for prostate cancer.', 'Aspirin, NSAIDs, and risk of prostate cancer: results from the REDUCE study.', 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of prostate cancer in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.', 'Influence of regular aspirin intake on PSA values, prostate cancer incidence and overall survival in a prospective screening trial (ERSPC Aarau).', 'Aspirin and urologic cancer risk: an update.', 'Decreased biochemical progression in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer using a novel mefenamic acid anti-inflammatory therapy: A randomized controlled trial.', 'Modern urology perspectives on prostate cancer biomarkers.', 'Statins and Metformin Use Is Associated with Lower PSA Levels in Prostate Cancer Patients Presenting for Radiation Therapy.', 'Patient Specific Characteristics Are an Important Factor That Determines the Risk of Acute Grade ≥ 2 Rectal Toxicity in Patients Treated for Prostate Cancer with IMRT and Daily Image Guidance Based on Implanted Gold Markers.', 'Postdiagnostic Statin Use and the Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.']"""

Statins are a class of inhibitors of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a key enzyme in synthesis of cholesterol. Epidemiological studies have shown that statin use decreases the incidence of advanced prostate cancer. We explored the idea that treatment of atorvastatin, a commonly prescribed statin for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, induces autophagy in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The atorvastatin-induced autophagic process in prostate cancer PC3 cells was determined by detection of cellular level of LC3-II, an autophagosomal marker, via immunoblotting and immunofluorescent staining.  Results:   Atorvastatin treatment of PC3 cells for 40 hrs increased expression of LC3-II by more than 10 fold in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of the cells with pepstatin A and E64-d, the autophagic protease inhibitors, dramatically increased atorvastatin-dependent LC3-II expression level, suggesting that atorvastatin induces autophagic flux. In addition, atorvastatin treatment caused rapid death of PC3 cells. Atorvastatin-induced autophagy and rapid cell death were reversed by addition of geranylgeraniol, not farnesol, into culture medium, indicating that atorvastatin-mediated inhibition of geranylgeranyl biosynthesis causes autophagy and cell death. Furthermore, atorvastatin did not induce autophagy or cell death in normal prostate RWPE1 cells, and induced only a minor autophagic response in AR-positive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   Our studies demonstrate that statins induce autophagy and autophagy-associated cell death in PC3 cells, likely through inhibition of geranylgeranylation, and suggest that autophagic response to statins may partially underlie the protective effects of statins on prostate cancer progression. Importantly, these findings highlight additional mechanisms by which statins might be used for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Ankur Parikh', 'Chandra Childress', 'Kelly Deitrick', 'Qiong Lin', 'Daniel Rukstalis', 'Wannian Yang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Inhibition of autophagy enhances anticancer effects of atorvastatin in digestive malignancies.', 'Atorvastatin induces autophagy in prostate cancer PC3 cells through activation of LC3 transcription.', 'Cell killing and radiosensitizing effects of atorvastatin in PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Statins, autophagy and cancer metastasis.', ""Autophagy: cancer therapy's friend or foe?"", 'Regulation of Autophagy via Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism in Cancer.', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma as a Metabolic Disease: An Update on Main Pathways, Potential Biomarkers, and Therapeutic Targets.', 'The cholesterol transport protein GRAMD1C regulates autophagy initiation and mitochondrial bioenergetics.', 'Hexokinase 2 Is a Pivot for Lovastatin-induced Glycolysis-to-Autophagy Reprogramming in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Novel Effects of Statins on Cancer via Autophagy.']"""

Methods:   High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration was measured using a high-sensitivity immunoturbidometric assay in sera collected at years 2, 4, and 6 from 50 men in the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT).

Results:   The observed RR due to an ICC < 1 was calculated by e((ln true RR*ICC)) for a range of true RRs. The 4-year ICC was 0.66. Measuring hsCRP once and assuming no other error, if the true RRs were 1.50, 2.00, and 3.00 when comparing high with low concentration, then the observed RRs would be 1.31, 1.58, and 2.06, respectively.

However, androgen ablation or castration fail to target androgen-independent cells implicated in disease etiology and recurrence. Mechanistically different to castration, this study shows beneficial proapoptotic actions of estrogen receptor-beta (ERbeta) in BPH and PCa. ERbeta agonist induces apoptosis in prostatic stromal, luminal and castrate-resistant basal epithelial cells of estrogen-deficient aromatase knock-out mice. This occurs via extrinsic (caspase-8) pathways, without reducing serum hormones, and perturbs the regenerative capacity of the epithelium. TNFalpha knock-out mice fail to respond to ERbeta agonist, demonstrating the requirement for TNFalpha signaling. In human tissues, ERbeta agonist induces apoptosis in stroma and epithelium of xenografted BPH specimens, including in the CD133(+) enriched putative stem/progenitor cells isolated from BPH-1 cells in vitro. In PCa, ERbeta causes apoptosis in Gleason Grade 7 xenografted tissues and androgen-independent cells lines (PC3 and DU145) via caspase-8. These data provide evidence of the beneficial effects of ERbeta agonist on epithelium and stroma of BPH, as well as androgen-independent tumor cells implicated in recurrent disease.

We present a case of a man who presented with breast skin changes that mimicked inflammatory breast carcinoma with specialized testing ultimately giving a diagnosis of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma. A 78-year-old man presented with left breast redness and swelling. Examination revealed an erythematous rash with subcutaneous edema over the left hemithoracic area. A breast ultrasound showed no focal mass, and a breast core biopsy had no evidence of tumor. A skin biopsy showed metastatic carcinoma in dermal lymphatics, and the tumor was found to have no estrogen or progesterone receptors or HER2 expression. Computed tomography scans, positron emission tomography, and a nuclear bone scan revealed widespread skeletal metastases. The patient received a 3-month course of capecitabine and cyclophosphamide with no improvement in his skin lesions. Subsequent immunohistochemical staining on the tumor specimen was positive for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and alpha-methyl-CoA-racemase, confirming a diagnosis of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma. He received leuprolide and bicalutamide and demonstrated significant improvement with near-complete resolution of his skin lesions and a decrease in his PSA level.

The correlation between acute and late toxicity (incidence and severity) was assessed.  Results:   Multivariate analysis showed that age </=65 years (p = .06) and use of the three-dimensional, six-field technique (p <.0001) correlated significantly with greater acute rectal toxicity. The three-dimensional, six-field technique (p = .0002), dose >70 Gy (p = .014), and radiotherapy duration (p = .05) correlated with greater acute urinary toxicity. Acute rectal toxicity (p <.0001) was the only factor that correlated with late rectal injury on multivariate analysis. Late urinary toxicity correlated with acute urinary events (p <.0001) and was inversely related to the use of salvage radiotherapy (p = .018). A highly significant correlation was found between the incidence of acute and late events for both rectal (p <.001) and urinary (p <.001) reactions. The severity of acute toxicity (Grade 2 or greater) was predictive for the severity of late toxicity for both rectal and urinary events (p <.001).

Patients who met the Phoenix definition of biochemical failure (nadir + 2 ng/mL(-1)) were identified. If the PSA subsequently fell to ≤0.5 ng/mL(-1)without intervention, this was considered a PSAb. All others were scored as true PSAf. Patient, tumor and dosimetric characteristics were compared between groups using the chi-square test and analysis of variance to evaluate factors associated with PSAf or PSAb.  Results:   Median follow-up was 54 months. Of the 1,006 men, 57 patients triggered the Phoenix definition of PSA failure, 32 (56%) were true PSAf, and 25 PSAb (44%).

Methods and materials:   In the present study, patients treated with CK underwent repeat planning for nine fixed-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using identical contour sets and dose-volume constraints. To calculate the dose falloff, the clinical target volume contours were expanded 30 mm anteriorly and posteriorly and 50 mm uniformly in other directions for all patients in the CK and IMRT plans.  Results:   We found that all the plans satisfied the dose-volume constraints, with the CK plans showing significantly better conformity than the IMRT plans at a relative greater dose inhomogeneity. The rectal and bladder volumes receiving a low dose were also lower for CK than for IMRT. The average conformity index, the ratio of the prescription isodose volume and clinical target volume, was 1.18 +/- 0.08 for the CK plans vs. 1.44 +/- 0.11 for the IMRT plans. The average homogeneity index, the ratio of the maximal dose and the prescribed dose to the clinical target volume, was 1.45 +/- 0.12 for the CK plans vs. 1.28 +/- 0.06 for the IMRT plans.

Previously, we reported cloning of prosaposin (PSAP) and its genomic amplification and/or overexpression in several androgen-independent metastatic PCa cell lines and lymph node metastases. PSAP is the lysosomal precursor of saposins, which serve as activators for lysosomal hydrolases involved in the degradation of ceramide (Cer) and other sphingolipids.  Results:   Our current data show that, in metastatic PCa cells, stable down-modulation of PSAP by RNA-interference via a lysosomal proteolysis-dependent pathway decreased beta1A-integrin expression, its cell-surface clustering, and adhesion to basement membrane proteins; led to disassembly of focal adhesion complex; and decreased phosphorylative activity of focal adhesion kinase and its downstream adaptor molecule, paxillin. Cathepsin D (CathD) expression and proteolytic activity, migration, and invasion were also significantly decreased in PSAP knock-down cells. Transient-transfection studies with beta1A integrin- or CathD-siRNA oligos confirmed the cause and effect relationship between PSAP and CathD or PSAP and Cer-beta1A integrin, regulating PCa cell migration and invasion.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that by a coordinated regulation of Cer levels, CathD and beta1A-integrin expression, and attenuation of ""inside-out"" integrin-signaling pathway, PSAP is involved in PCa invasion and therefore might be used as a molecular target for PCa therapy.""","""['Siyi Hu', 'Nathalie Delorme', 'Zhenzhen Liu', 'Tao Liu', 'Cruz Velasco-Gonzalez', 'Jone Garai', 'Ashok Pullikuth', 'Shahriar Koochekpour']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Amplification and overexpression of prosaposin in prostate cancer.', '3,4-Methylenedioxy-β-nitrostyrene inhibits adhesion and migration of human triple-negative breast cancer cells by suppressing β1 integrin function and surface protein disulfide isomerase.', 'Talin1 phosphorylation activates β1 integrins: a novel mechanism to promote prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Focal adhesion kinase controls prostate cancer progression via intrinsic kinase and scaffolding functions.', 'Occupy tissue: the movement in cancer metastasis.', 'Role of Prosaposin and Extracellular Sulfatase Sulf-1 Detection in Pleural Effusions as Diagnostic Biomarkers of Malignant Mesothelioma.', 'Comparative proteomic analysis of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats based on tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitation technology.', 'Impact of Increased FUT8 Expression on the Extracellular Vesicle Proteome in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Putative Biomarkers for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Suggested by Proteomic Analysis of Cell Secretome.', 'Total glucosides of paeony inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced proliferation, migration and invasion in androgen insensitive prostate cancer cells.']"""

A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was carried out to evaluate the predictive values of each clinical and pathological factor, separately and in combination. Based on logistic regression analysis, a nomogram predicting the side-specific probability of ECE was developed.  Results:   Overall, 146 (40%) of 354 patients and 165 (23%) of 708 lobes had ECE pathologically. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of the standard features, such as serum PSA, clinical stage and biopsy Gleason sum on each side, in predicting side-specific probability of ECE were 0.624, 0.627, and 0.747, respectively. When these three features were combined, AUC increased to 0.773 which was not significantly different from 0.791 of maximum percent of cancer alone (P = 0.613) and significantly enhanced by including maximum percent of cancer on each side, 0.799 (P = 0.022). The resulting nomogram was internally validated and had excellent calibration.

Patients and methods:   Of a total of 1269 patients who underwent LRP during a 109 month period, 374 (30%) had a PLND; 253 men had a sPLND (2000 to March 2008) and 121 had an extended PLND (ePLND; after April 2008) for intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. An extraperitoneal approach was used in all patients having sPLND and a transperitoneal approach in patients having ePLND.  Results:   Patient age, body mass index, gland weight, prostate-specific antigen level and Gleason grade were similar in the two groups. The ePLND group had a greater proportion of patients with cT3 disease (9.9% vs 4.2%, P = 0.046) and was associated with a longer operating time of 206.5 vs 180.0 min (P < 0.001) and a higher node count of 17.5 vs 6.1 (P = 0.002).

EZH2 is overexpressed in aggressive forms of prostate, breast, bladder, and endometrial cancers. However, the role of EZH2 expression in gastric cancer has not been fully determined. This study was conducted to investigate the correlation between EZH2 and cell cycle-related molecules, and the clinical value of EZH2 expression in gastric cancer. We analyzed EZH2 expression using Western blotting in AGS, MKN-28, SNU-16, SNU-484, SNU-601, and SNU-638 gastric cancer cell lines. After transfection of EZH2 siRNA into MKN-28 cells, the change in cell cycle-related molecules was assessed by Western blot analysis. Expression of EZH2, Ki-67, and p53 was determined by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays from specimens of 137 cases of resected gastric cancer. We found high expressions of EZH2 in all of the tested gastric cancer cell lines. RNA interference of EZH2 induced upregulation of p53 and HDAC1 and downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E. High EZH2 expression was observed in 60.6% of gastric cancers and in 6.7% of non-neoplastic gastric tissues (p < 0.01); 40.1% were positive for p53 in gastric cancers.

Intracellular iron uptake is regulated by the transferrin receptor (TfR), and the activity of artemisinin depends on the availability of iron. We examined the level of TfR in prostate cancer (PCa) tumor cells, synthesized two new artemisinin dimers, and evaluated the effect of dihydroartemisinin and artemisinin dimers, ON-2Py and 2Py, on proliferation and apoptosis in PCa cells. TfR was expressed in the majority of PCa bone and soft tissue metastases, all 24 LuCaP PCa xenografts, and PCa cell lines. After treatment with dihydroartemisinin, ON-2Py, or 2Py all PCa cell lines displayed dose-dependent decrease in cell number. 2Py was most effective in decreasing cell number. An increase in apoptotic events and growth arrest was observed in the C4-2 and LNCaP cell lines. Growth arrest was observed in PC-3 cells, but no significant change was observed in DU 145 cells. Treatment with 2Py resulted in a loss of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin in all four cell lines. 2Py treatment also decreased androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen expression in C4-2 and LNCaP cells, with a concomitant loss of cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1 and c-Myc.

Oral administration of ALA has been used in patients with prostate and bladder cancer. The present aim was to investigate the mechanism of intestinal absorption of ALA and its transport via the amino acid transporter SLC36A1.  Experimental approach:   In vitro investigations of ALA affinity for and uptake via SLC36A1 and SLC15A1 were performed in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Interaction of ALA with SLC15A1 was investigated in MDCK/SLC15A1 cells, whereas interactions with SLC36A1 were investigated in COS-7 cells transiently expressing SLC36A1.  Key results:   ALA inhibited SLC36A1-mediated L-[(3)H]Pro and SLC15A1-mediated [(14)C]Gly-Sar uptake in Caco-2 cell monolayers with IC(50) values of 11.3 and 2.1 mM respectively. In SLC36A1-expressing COS-7 cells, the uptake of [(14)C]ALA was saturable with a K(m) value of 6.8 +/- 3.0 mM and a V(max) of 96 +/- 13 pmol x cm(-2) x min(-1). Uptake of [(14)C]ALA was pH and concentration dependent, and could be inhibited by glycine, proline and GABA. In a membrane potential assay, translocation of ALA via SLC36A1 was concentration dependent, with a K(m) value of 3.8 +/- 1.0 mM. ALA is thus a substrate for SLC36A1. In Caco-2 cells, apical [(14)C]ALA uptake was pH dependent, but Na(+) independent, and completely inhibited by 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan and L-4,4'-biphenylalanyl-l-proline. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS. ALA was a substrate for SLC36A1, and the apical absorption in Caco-2 cell was only mediated by SLC36A1 and SLC15A1.

Experimental approach:   The effect of SZ-685C on the viability of cancer cell lines was investigated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. SZ-685C-induced apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling assay and analysis of caspase activation. The effect of SZ-685C on the Akt/FOXO pathway was studied using Western blotting analysis, and the in vivo anti-tumour efficacy was examined in an MDA-MB-435 breast cancer xenograft model.  Key results:   SZ-685C suppressed the proliferation of six cancer cell lines derived from human breast cancer, prostate cancer, glioma and hepatoma (IC(50) values ranged from 3.0 to 9.6 microM) and the growth of breast cancer xenografts in mice. SZ-685C had a direct apoptosis-inducing effect through both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, as shown by activation of caspase-8 and 9 as well as effector caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream effectors, forkhead box protein O1 and forkhead box protein O3a, was down-regulated in SZ-685C-treated cancer cells. Furthermore, the pro-apoptotic protein Bim was up-regulated by SZ-685C treatment consistent with FOXO dephosphorylation.  Conclusions and implications:   SZ-685C could induce apoptosis through the Akt/FOXO pathway, which consequently leads to the observed anti-tumour effect both in vitro and in vivo.

Patients and methods:   We assessed 932 men with pathologically OC disease who were treated with RP by nine different surgeons between 1992 and 2004. The prognostic significance of clinical and pathological variables, including tumour volume (TV) and percentage of high-grade TV (%HGTV) were assessed. Logistic and Cox regression models were fitted to identify risk factors of a PSM and BCR. BCR was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 0.1 ng/mL and increasing after an undetectable PSA level.  Results:   The total PSM rate was 12.9% (120 men); the mean TV (P < 0.001), but not %HGTV (P= 0.2) was significantly higher in patients with PSM. TV, nerve-sparing RP technique and surgical volume were independent risk factors for a PSM (P= 0.03). After a median follow-up of 35 months the overall BCR rate was 8.8% (82 men). Patients with a PSM had significantly higher BCR rates (21.7% vs 6.9%; P < 0.001). In univariable analysis, a high %HGTV (70.4%) was the most informative risk factor of BCR, followed by RP Gleason score (65.8%) and PSM (65.7%). Removal of PSM from a multivariable Cox model decreased the accuracy by 12.1% (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Our findings show that in OC prostate cancer, the risk of a PSM depends on TV, surgical technique and surgical volume. PSM is a significant risk factor for BCR. However, only 20% men with OC disease and a PSM develop BCR; conversely, 80% of men are cured despite a PSM.

Patients and methods:   From July 2003 to January 2005, 512 consecutive patients with preoperative prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) underwent RRP or LRP with no previous radio- or hormonal therapy. An additional 74 patients with preoperative MRI undergoing RP from December 2001 to June 2007 who had an apical PSM were also included, with 586 patients comprising the study population. Bony and soft-tissue pelvic dimensions, including interspinous distance (ISD), bony (BFW) and soft tissue (SW) pelvic width, apical prostate depth (AD) and symphysis pubis angle, were measured on preoperative MRI. The pelvic dimension index (PDI), bony width index (BWI) and soft-tissue width index (SWI) were defined as ISD/AD, BFW/AD and SW/AD, respectively.

Results:   There was no significant difference in ISD, BFW, SW or symphysis angle between patients with and without apical PSM.

Patients and methods:   Between October 1997 and March 2009, 44 patients (30 men and 14 women; mean age 79 years, range 51-95) with intractable haematuria secondary to advanced pelvic tumour arising from or invading the bladder, underwent internal iliac TAE. Twenty-four patients had transitional carcinoma of the urinary bladder, 12 adenocarcinoma of the prostate, five carcinoma of the uterus, one cancer of the vagina, two carcinoma of the rectum, three carcinoma of the kidney, two simultaneous carcinoma of prostate and bladder, one simultaneous carcinoma of prostate and kidney and one had haemorrhagic cystitis after radiotherapy.  Results:   TAE of the internal iliac arteries produced initial complete control of bleeding in 36 of the 44 patients (82%). At a mean (range) follow-up of 10.5 (1-97) months TAE there was permanent control of bleeding in 19 (43%) patients. A second TAE session was use in five (11%) patients and it was successful in two of them. There were 24 patients (55%) who required a mean of 4 (1-17) transfusion units before embolization; only 13 (30%) required more blood products after TAE. The mean haematocrit level before and after TAE was 27% and 31% (P < 0001), and the respective haemoglobin level were 8.7 and 10.3 g/dL (P < 0001). During the follow-up there were no major complications related to TAE; minor complications were post-TAE syndrome in 12 (27%) patients, fever (11%), gluteus pain (14%), nausea (2%), and exterior genital oedema (5%). The 6- and 12-month mortality rates were 66% (29 patients) and 18% (eight), respectively.  Conclusions:   TAE should be considered as an alternative less-invasive palliative measure and the treatment of choice in these situations. TAE should always be bilateral, the catheter should advance distally to the origin of the superior gluteal artery and the artery embolized with unresorbable particles.

The potential antineoplastic effect of ACs was investigated in patients who received radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   : The study cohort consisted of 662 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who received radiotherapy (RT) with curative intent. Among those 622 men, 243 (37%) were receiving ACs (warfarin, clopidogrel, and/or aspirin). All patients received external-beam RT, permanent seed implantation, or a combination of both.

PrCa was positively associated with the CAPN10 rs3792267 G allele [hazard ratio (HR) 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.44] and inversely associated with the SLC2A2 rs5400 Thr110 allele (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72, 1.00), the UCP2 rs660339 Val55 allele (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73, 0.97) and the IGF2BP2 rs4402960 T allele (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02; blacks only). The TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele was inversely associated with PrCa using a dominant genetic model (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97).

Given the role of the IGF system in prostate cancer, ALS may influence carcinogenesis by modulating IGF-I levels or bioavailability.  Methods:   We undertook a prospective study nested in the Physicians' Health Study to examine ALS, free IGF-I, and prostate cancer. We assayed circulating levels of ALS and IGF components among 545 incident cases and 545 matched controls. We calculated relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for life-style factors, total IGF-I, and IGFBP3.  Results:   ALS was positively correlated with total IGF-I (r = 0.58), IGFBP3 (r = 0.68), and free IGF-I (r = 0.36). Comparing highest versus lowest quartiles, we found no association between free IGF-I and prostate cancer risk (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6-1.3). In contrast, ALS was positively associated with risk among men in the 2nd (RR, 1.5; 94% CI, 1.0-2.3), 3rd (RR, 1.6; 94% CI, 1.1-2.5), and 4th quartiles (RR, 1.4; 94% CI, 0.9-2.1) compared with lowest quartile. The association was stronger for advanced stage tumors (RR, 2.0; 94% CI, 0.8-4.6). There was a suggestion of an interaction between ALS and total IGF-I, whereby high circulating IGF-I was associated with an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men with low but not higher ALS levels.  Discussion:   Plasma ALS is positively associated with prostate cancer risk, and may interact biologically with IGF-I to affect carcinogenesis. These data provide further support for the role of the IGF axis in prostate cancer.""","""['Lorelei A Mucci', 'Jennifer R Stark', 'Michael N Pollak', 'Haojie Li', 'Tobias Kurth', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Jing Ma']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Circulating Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1-Related Biomarkers and Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF binding protein-3 as predictors of advanced-stage prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic value of the acid-labile subunit in acromegaly: evaluation in comparison with insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I, and IGF-binding protein-1, -2, and -3.', 'Association of umbilical cord plasma acid-labile subunit of the insulin-like growth factor ternary complex with anthropometry in term newborns.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-I and binding protein-3 and risk of cancer.', 'Circulating Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1-Related Biomarkers and Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Does milk intake promote prostate cancer initiation or progression via effects on insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)?

However, robust and automated prostate segmentation is challenging due to the low SNR in TRUS and the missing boundaries in shadow areas caused by calcifications or hyperdense prostate tissues. This paper presents a novel method of utilizing a priori shapes estimated from partial contours for segmenting the prostate. The proposed method is able to automatically extract prostate boundary from 2-D TRUS images without user interaction for shape correction in shadow areas. During the segmentation process, missing boundaries in shadow areas are estimated by using a partial active shape model, which takes partial contours as input but returns a complete shape estimation. With this shape guidance, an optimal search is performed by a discrete deformable model to minimize an energy functional for image segmentation, which is achieved efficiently by using dynamic programming. The segmentation of an image is executed in a multiresolution fashion from coarse to fine for robustness and computational efficiency.

When counseling patients, a useful way to convey the risk for death from competing causes is to estimate their lifetime risk for dying from prostate cancer. Double-decrement life tables were constructed to calculate age-specific death rates using the death probabilities from the Social Security Administration life tables and Gleason score-specific mortality rates reported from a pre-PSA cohort study. The lifetime risk for prostate cancer death was calculated. Life tables provided life expectancy and risk for prostate cancer death based on age at diagnosis. For example, a 60-year-old patient with a Gleason score 6, 7, or 8 tumor had an overall life expectancy of 14.4, 10.2, or 6.6 years, respectively. The risk for prostate cancer death during the expected years of life was 33%, 49%, or 57%, respectively. If a 10-year lead-time bias was assumed for PSA detection, the risks for death from prostate cancer decreased to 16%, 26%, or 37%, respectively. If the patient was in the bottom quartile for overall health and disease was detected by prostate examination, the risk for death from prostate cancer was 21%, 32%, or 40%, respectively. A Web-based tool for performing these calculations is available at http://www.roswellpark.org/Patient_Care/Specialized_Services/Prostate_Cancer_Estimator.html.

Methods:   Between November 2008 and June 2009, patients over the age of 65 with metastatic cancer were interviewed. Medical records were reviewed in order to ascertain current medication use and relevant past medical history. Classes of medication of interest were prospectively defined; these were anti-hypertensives, lipid-lowering drugs, anti-platelet agents, anti-coagulants and bisphosphonates.  Results:   One hundred patients were recruited, with a median age of 73.5 years (range 65-88); 52% were women. The primary cancer sites were breast, 36%; prostate, 27%; colon, 14%; other, 23%.

Resveratrol, a naturally occurring compound present in grapes, has been shown to have potent antioxidant properties as well as an ability to induce apoptosis. Resveratrol has also been reported to have significant inhibitory effects against a variety of primary tumors including breast, colon, and prostate. Pterostilbene, a naturally occurring analogue of resveratrol found in blueberries, also has antioxidant and antiproliferative properties. It is also substantially more bioavailable orally than resveratrol. These effects have not been studied in pancreatic cancer. We hypothesized that pterostilbene would inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro.  Materials and methods:   Two pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa and PANC-1) were cultured using standard techniques. Cells were treated with graduated doses of pterostilbene ranging from 10 to 100 microM. Cell viability was measured by MTT at 24, 48, and 72 h.  Results:   Pterostilbene decreases cell viability in both cancer cell lines in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Higher doses (75-100 microM) caused a significant reduction in cell viability at 24 and 48 h. However, by 72 h, all tested concentrations of pterostilbene (10 to 100 microM) resulted in significantly reduced cell viability in both pancreatic cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion. Pterostilbene caused a dose-dependent 10-63% inhibition in MIA PaCa-2 cells and 10-75% inhibition in PANC-1 cells.  Discussion:   Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro with Pterostilbene leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and/or cell death, cell cycle arrrest, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and activation of effector caspases. This naturally occurring agent may have a role in treating pancreatic cancer.  Conclusions:   Pterostilbene inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer in vitro. Further, in vitro mechanistic studies and in vivo experiments are warranted to determine its potential for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.""","""['Patrick W Mannal', 'Juile A Alosi', 'John G Schneider', 'Debbie E McDonald', 'David W McFadden']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Gastrointest Surg""","""['Pterostilbene inhibits breast cancer in vitro through mitochondrial depolarization and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis.', 'Inhibitory effects of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and pterostilbene on pancreatic cancer growth in vitro.', 'Pterostilbene inhibits lung cancer through induction of apoptosis.', 'Pterostilbene and cancer: current review.', ""Biological actions and molecular effects of resveratrol, pterostilbene, and 3'-hydroxypterostilbene."", 'Nutraceuticals and Cancer: Potential for Natural Polyphenols.', 'Chloroquine Potentiates the Anticancer Effect of Pterostilbene on Pancreatic Cancer by Inhibiting Autophagy and Downregulating the RAGE/STAT3 Pathway.', 'Pterostilbene in Cancer Therapy.', 'Pterostilbene inhibits lung squamous cell carcinoma growth in vitro and in vivo by inducing S phase arrest and apoptosis.', 'Emerging Actions of Pterostilebene on Cancer Research.']"""

The goal of antigen-specific active immunotherapies targeting PAP would ideally be to elicit PAP-specific CD8+ effector T cells. The identification of PAP-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes should provide a means of monitoring the immunological efficacy of vaccines targeting PAP, and these epitopes might themselves be developed as vaccine antigens. In the current report, we hypothesized that PAP-specific epitopes might be identified by direct identification of pre-existing CD8+ T cells specific for HLA-A2-restricted peptides derived from PAP in the blood of HLA-A2-expressing individuals. 11 nonamer peptides derived from the amino acid sequence of PAP were used as stimulator antigens in functional ELISPOT assays with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 HLA-A2+ patients with prostate cancer or ten healthy blood donors. Peptide-specific T cells were frequently identified in both groups for three of the peptides, p18-26, p112-120, and p135-143. CD8+ T-cell clones specific for three peptides, p18-26, p112-120, and p299-307, confirmed that these are HLA-A2-restricted T-cell epitopes. Moreover, HLA-A2 transgenic mice immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding PAP developed epitope-specific responses for one or more of these three peptide epitopes. We propose that this method to first identify epitopes for which there are pre-existing epitope-specific T cells could be used to prioritize MHC class I-specific epitopes for other antigens. In addition, we propose that the epitopes identified here could be used to monitor immune responses in HLA-A2+ patients receiving vaccines targeting PAP to identify potentially therapeutic immune responses.""","""['Brian M Olson', 'Thomas P Frye', 'Laura E Johnson', 'Lawrence Fong', 'Keith L Knutson', 'Mary L Disis', 'Douglas G McNeel']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Identification of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) specific HLA-DR1-restricted T-cell epitopes.', 'CD8+ T cells specific for the androgen receptor are common in patients with prostate cancer and are able to lyse prostate tumor cells.', 'Human CTL epitopes prostatic acid phosphatase-3 and six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate-3 as candidates for prostate cancer immunotherapy.', 'Advances in the study of HLA-restricted epitope vaccines.', 'HLA-binding properties of tumor neoepitopes in humans.', 'First in man study: Bcl-Xl_42-CAF®09b vaccines in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Vaccines as treatments for prostate cancer.', 'Tumor microenvironment antigens.', 'Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines-Antigen Discovery and Adjuvant Delivery Platforms.', 'A Mutated Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) Peptide-Based Vaccine Induces PAP-Specific CD8+ T Cells with Ex Vivo Cytotoxic Capacities in HHDII/DR1 Transgenic Mice.']"""

Methods:   Markers Ki-67 and CD34 were studied using immunohistochemistry in 34 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma from radical prostatectomies performed at the Hospital Regional do Gama in Brasilia, Brazil from 2000 through 2005. Those markers were quantified using the SAMBA 4000 software - Automated Scanning Microscopic Analysis System - and the IMMUNO software in the analysis of the variables labeling index and optical density.

The initial treatment for advanced prostate cancer is suppression of androgen signaling. Later on, essentially all patients develop an androgen independent stage which does not respond to anti hormonal treatment. Thus, alternative strategies targeting novel molecular mechanisms are required. beta-TrCP is an E3 ligase that targets various substrates essential for many aspects of tumorigenesis.  Methodology/principal findings:   Here we show that beta-TrCP depletion suppresses prostate cancer and identify a relevant growth control mechanism. shRNA targeted against beta-TrCP reduced prostate cancer cell growth and cooperated with androgen ablation in vitro and in vivo. We found that beta-TrCP inhibition leads to upregulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediating the therapeutic effect. This phenomenon could be ligand independent, as the AhR ligand 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD) did not alter prostate cancer cell growth. We detected high AhR expression and activation in basal cells and atrophic epithelial cells of human cancer bearing prostates. AhR expression and activation is also significantly higher in tumor cells compared to benign glandular epithelium.  Conclusions/significance:   Together these observations suggest that AhR activation may be a cancer counteracting mechanism in the prostate.

In this study, we show that in human prostate tumors, coexpression of c-MYC and PIM1 is associated with higher Gleason grades. Using a tissue recombination model coupled with lentiviral-mediated gene transfer we find that Pim1 is weakly oncogenic in naive adult mouse prostatic epithelium. However, it cooperates dramatically with c-MYC to induce prostate cancer within 6-weeks. Importantly, c-MYC/Pim1 synergy is critically dependent on Pim1 kinase activity. c-MYC/Pim1 tumors showed increased levels of the active serine-62 (S62) phosphorylated form of c-MYC. Grafts expressing a phosphomimetic c-MYCS62D mutant had higher rates of proliferation than grafts expressing wild type c-MYC but did not form tumors like c-MYC/Pim1 grafts, indicating that Pim1 cooperativity with c-MYC in vivo involves additional mechanisms other than enhancement of c-MYC activity by S62 phosphorylation. c-MYC/Pim1-induced prostate carcinomas show evidence of neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. Additional studies, including the identification of tumor cells coexpressing androgen receptor and NE cell markers synaptophysin and Ascl1 suggested that NE tumors arose from adenocarcinoma cells through transdifferentiation.

Here we describe the relationship between PK, Akt inhibition, hyperglycemia and tumor efficacy for a selective inhibitor of Akt1 and Akt2 (AKTi). In nude mice, AKTi treatment caused transient insulin resistance and reversible, dose-dependent hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Akt1 and Akt2 phosphorylation was inhibited in mouse lung with EC50 values of 1.6 and 7 μM, respectively, and with similar potency in other tissues and xenograft tumors. Weekly subcutaneous dosing of AKTi resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of LNCaP prostate cancer xenografts, an AR-dependent tumor with PTEN deletion and constitutively activated Akt. Complete tumor growth inhibition was achieved at 200 mpk, a dose that maintained inhibition of Akt1 and Akt2 of greater than 80% and 50%, respectively, for at least 12 hours in xenograft tumor and mouse lung. Hyperglycemia could be controlled by reducing C(max), while maintaining efficacy in the LNCaP model, but not by insulin administration.

One recent experimental therapy involves endothelin receptor A (ETA) antagonists (e.g., atrasentan). Clinical results to date have been mixed, with atrasentan not meeting its primary endpoints in a Phase III trial. It remains an open question whether some patients might benefit from this therapy, while others may not. Preclinical data supports the concept that the endothelin signaling axis may be particularly important for tumor growth in bone, but the extent to which it is involved in metastatic colonization of other organ sites in prostate cancer remains unclear. Here we evaluate the efficacy of atrasentan in a mouse model of prostate cancer metastatic colonization. Using bioluminescence imaging, we show that atrasentan does inhibit tumor growth in, but not the initial colonization of, bony sites in intracardially-injected 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. However, atrasentan shows little efficacy in soft tissues such as adrenal gland or liver. Our studies show that whether atrasentan exhibits significant overall antitumor efficacy and survival benefit depends on the presence of bone metastasis evident in that animal. Though in contrast to previous findings efficacy is apparent in a prostate tumor model that elicits mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions. These data confirm the notion that atrasentan may exhibit selective activity against prostate cancer bone metastasis, mirroring clinical findings, and suggest that the role of endothelin signaling in bone metastasis may be more complex than previously appreciated. The model described here may provide a valuable tool for unraveling this complexity.""","""['Justin M Drake', 'Joshua R Danke', 'Michael D Henry']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Targeting the endothelin receptor in prostate cancer bone metastasis: Back to the mouse?', 'In vitro and in vivo molecular evidence for better therapeutic efficacy of ABT-627 and taxotere combination in prostate cancer.', 'A phase 3 randomized controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of atrasentan in men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the endothelin receptor in prostate cancer bone metastasis: Back to the mouse?', 'Targeting bone metastasis in prostate cancer with endothelin receptor antagonists.', 'Current trials using bone-targeting agents in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'Biological and Clinical Aspects of Metastatic Spinal Tumors.', 'Targeting signaling pathways in prostate cancer: mechanisms and clinical trials.', 'Novel approaches to target the microenvironment of bone metastasis.', 'Molecular Insights and Emerging Strategies for Treatment of Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.']"""

PDEF (prostate-derived Ets factor) has been under investigation for its role in tumor development and progression. However, the role of PDEF in cancer development has been controversial. Some reports link PDEF to tumor promoter, and others show tumor-suppressing functions in various systems under different conditions. So far, there has been no conclusive evidence from in vivo experiments to prove the role of PDEF. We have used both in vitro and in vivo systems to provide a conclusive role of PDEF in the progression process. PDEF-expressing cells block the cell growth rate, and this retardation was reversible when PDEF expression was silenced with PDEF-specific small interfering RNA. When these PDEF-expressing cells were orthotopically implanted into the mouse mammary gland, tumor incidence and growth rate were significantly retarded. Cell cycle analysis revealed that PDEF expression partially blocked cell cycle progression at G(1)/S without an effect on apoptosis. PDEF overexpression resulted in an increase in p21/CIP1 at both the mRNA and protein levels, resulting in decreased Cdk2 activity. Promoter deletion analysis, electrophoresis mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies identified the functional Ets DNA binding site at -2118 bp of the p21/CIP1 gene promoter. This site is capable of binding and responding to PDEF. Furthermore, we silenced p21/CIP1 expression in PDEF-overexpressing cells by small interfering RNA. p21-silenced PDEF cells exhibited significantly increased cell growth in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the p21 regulation by PDEF as a key player. These experiments identified PDEF as a new transcription factor that directly regulates p21/CIP1 expression under non-stressed conditions. This study conclusively proves that PDEF is a breast tumor suppressor for the first time using both in vitro and in vivo systems. PDEF can be further developed as a target for designing therapeutic intervention of breast cancer.""","""['Jeremy S Schaefer', 'Yamini Sabherwal', 'Heidi Y Shi', 'Venkataraman Sriraman', 'JoAnne Richards', 'Alex Minella', 'David P Turner', 'Dennis K Watson', 'Ming Zhang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Signatures of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) in cancer.', 'Epigenetic modifications of prostate-derived Ets transcription factor in breast cancer cells.', 'AR-PDEF pathway promotes tumour proliferation and upregulates MYC-mediated gene transcription by promoting MAD1 degradation in ER-negative breast cancer.', 'Prostate-derived Ets transcription factor (PDEF) downregulates survivin expression and inhibits breast cancer cell growth in vitro and xenograft tumor formation in vivo.', 'Prostate derived ETS factor (PDEF): a putative tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'SPDEF suppresses head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression by transcriptionally activating NR4A1.', 'Methylation as a critical epigenetic process during tumor progressions among Iranian population: an overview.', 'Double Agent: SPDEF Gene with Both Oncogenic and Tumor-Suppressor Functions in Breast Cancer.', 'Prostate-derived ETS factor improves prognosis and represses proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Signatures of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) in cancer.']"""

In this study, we investigated whether cell survival could be suppressed by a combination of the dispersion of lipid raft microdomains and treatment with genistein, a well-known potential isoflavone, in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Cell viability was assayed by the property of reagent change upon reduction of resazurin to resorufin and apoptosis was evaluated by ethidium bromide/acridine orange (EB/AO) staining and PARP and caspase-3 expression. Signal transduction was investigated by immunoblot analysis. Cell viability decreased significantly more following successive double treatment with genistein and the cholesterol-lowering agent 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) than in response to either agent alone. Apoptotic cell staining and cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 appeared more clearly in double-treated cells than in those treated with genistein alone. In cell signaling, both HPCD and genistein decreased the protein expressions of pAkt as well as the androgen receptors stimulated by EGF and DHT, respectively, in concentration-dependent manners. This pattern was also present in protein levels of pAkt and the androgen receptor located in the lipid raft fraction. Furthermore, the phosphorylation cascade of Akt, GSK-3beta and p70S6k was markedly inhibited by the combination treatment. These data suggest that prostate cancer cells could be effectively inhibited by combination treatment of cholesterol-lowering strategies and genistein. The mechanism is likely to be partially via both the EGFR-mediated Akt or p70S6k pathways and a down-regulation of androgen receptor in the lipid raft microdomain.""","""['Hea Young Oh', 'Jandi Leem', 'So Jung Yoon', 'Sun Yoon', 'Sung Joon Hong']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Cholesterol level of lipid raft microdomains regulates apoptotic cell death in prostate cancer cells through EGFR-mediated Akt and ERK signal transduction.', 'GCP-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells via androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms.', 'Cholesterol sensitivity of endogenous and myristoylated Akt.', 'Prostate cancer: a model of integration of genomic and non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor in cell lines model.', 'Oxysterol receptors, AKT and prostate cancer.', 'Plants as a Source of Anticancer Agents: From Bench to Bedside.', 'SQLE Mediates Metabolic Reprogramming to Promote LN Metastasis in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Quercetin and Its Nano-Scale Delivery Systems in Prostate Cancer Therapy: Paving the Way for Cancer Elimination and Reversing Chemoresistance.', 'C-Glucosylation as a tool for the prevention of PAINS-induced membrane dipole potential alterations.', 'Plant-Derived Natural Products in Cancer Research: Extraction, Mechanism of Action, and Drug Formulation.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between 1994 and 2008, 37 men with local failure after initial prostate radiotherapy (32 external-beam radiation therapy [EBRT] and 5 BT) underwent salvage BT with (103)Pd or (125)I. Estimates of freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF, Phoenix definition) and cause-specific survival (CSS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicities were graded using CTCv3.0.  Results:   Median follow-up was 86 months (range, 2-156). The median dose to 90% of the prostate volume was 122 Gy (range, 67-166). The 10-year FFbF and CSS were 54% and 96%, respectively. On univariate analysis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >10 ng/mL at initial diagnosis was significantly associated with FFbF (p = 0.01), and there were trends for both age <70 years (p = 0.08) and PSA <6 ng/mL (p = 0.08) at the time of salvage BT. On multivariate analysis, only presalvage PSA <6 ng/mL (p = 0.046) was significantly associated with improved FFbF. There were three Grade 3 toxicities and one Grade 4 toxicity. Pelvic lymph node dissection before salvage BT was the only variable significantly associated with Grade > or = 2 toxicity (p = 0.03).  Conclusion:   With a median follow-up of 86 months, salvage prostate BT was associated with a 10-year FFbF of 54% and CSS of 96%. Improved FFbF was associated with a presalvage PSA <6 ng/mL. Toxicity was worse in patients who had undergone pelvic lymph node dissection before salvage BT.

Targeting of doxorubicin-loaded liposomes enhanced their cytotoxic effect against PC3 cells in vitro, indicating a possible therapeutic advantage. The simplicity of the approach for generating targeted liposomes coupled with the ability to rapidly obtain tumor-specific phage fusion proteins via phage display may contribute to a combinatorial system for the production of targeted liposomal therapeutics for advanced stages of prostate tumor.

Zinc supplementation for prevention and treatment of prostate cancer in humans has yielded controversial results. No studies have been reported in animal models to show the effect of zinc supplementation on prevention of prostate cancer, thus far. In this study, we have examined the effect of zinc supplementation on development of prostate cancer in a TRAMP mouse model. Results from our study indicate that dietary zinc plays an important role in prostate carcinogenesis. Tumor weights were significantly higher when the dietary zinc intake was either deficient or high in comparison to normal zinc intake level, suggesting that an optimal dietary zinc intake may play a protective role against prostate cancer. Further, our studies also showed decreased insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF-1/IGF binding protein-3 ratio in normal zinc-supplemented animals, suggesting that zinc may modulate IGF-1 metabolism in relation to carcinogenesis.

The technique was employed in four patients with a history of transurethral prostate resection. Before dissecting the prostate from the bladder neck during RPP, we circumscribed the bladder neck perurethrally with a Collins knife. The remaining of the RPP procedure was performed via the traditional approach. The incision of the prostate-vesical junction with the Collins knife protected the bladder-neck integrity and made the dissection of this junction easier. The final pathologic diagnosis was organ-confined prostate cancer with negative surgical margins. All the patients had continence during a 6-month follow-up. The major advantage of this technique is to precisely locate the prostate-vesical junction under direct vision.

Serotype 5 adenovirus (Ad.5) is routinely used as a vector for transgene delivery. However, the infectivity of Ad.5 is dependent on Coxsackie-adenovirus receptors (CARs); many tumor types show a reduction in this receptor in vivo, thereby limiting therapeutic gene transduction. Serotype chimerism is one approach to circumvent CAR deficiency; this strategy is used to generate an Ad.5/3-recombinant Ad that infects cancer cells through Ad.3 receptors in a CAR-independent manner. In this report, the enhanced transgene delivery and efficacy of Ad.5/3-recombinant virus was evaluated using an effective wide-spectrum anticancer therapeutic melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24). Our data show that in low CAR human prostate cancer cells (PC-3), a recombinant Ad.5/3 virus delivering mda-7/IL-24 (Ad.5/3-mda-7) is more efficacious than an Ad.5 virus encoding mda-7/IL-24 (Ad.5-mda-7) in infecting tumor cells, expressing MDA-7/IL-24 protein, inducing cancer-specific apoptosis, inhibiting in vivo tumor growth and exerting an antitumor 'bystander' effect in a nude mouse xenograft model.

This work proposes and examines the hypothesis that the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (ApoE4) allele and diet are important risk factors for prostate cancer. The hypothesis was evaluated in an ecological study involving 122 countries for which prostate cancer rates for 2002, ApoE4 allele prevalence, dietary supply values, and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) data were available, and for which there were at least 250,000 inhabitants. In addition, a subset of 102 countries with ApoE4 prevalence of less than 30% was also used. In the full data set, per capita GDP, lack of cereal consumption, milk protein and ApoE4 were significantly correlated with incidence, explaining 60% of the variance. In the 102-country subset of 102, per capita GDP, ApoE4 prevalence, and milk protein explained 62% of the variance of prostate cancer incidence, while lack of cereal consumption, ApoE4 prevalence and per capita GDP explained 55% of the variance of prostate cancer mortality rates. Cholesterol has been identified as an important risk factor for prostate cancer. The ApoE4 allele increases cholesterol production and cereal consumption lowers serum cholesterol levels. The ApoE4 allele is an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and cholesterol is a risk factor and cereals a risk reduction factor. The ApoE4-diet-GDP hypothesis may explain the higher risk of prostate cancer for African Americans and should form the basis for further studies.""","""['William B Grant']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['The roles of ultraviolet-B irradiance, vitamin D, apolipoprotein E ε4, and diet in the risk of prostate cancer.', 'Reduction in DHA transport to the brain of mice expressing human APOE4 compared to APOE2.', 'The isoform-specific pathological effects of apoE4 in vivo are prevented by a fish oil (DHA) diet and are modified by cholesterol.', ""APOE ε4: the most prevalent yet understudied risk factor for Alzheimer's disease."", ""Abeta-independent roles of apolipoprotein E4 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."", 'Hub Gene and Its Key Effects on Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma by Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis.', 'The Role of ApoE Expression and Variability of Its Glycosylation in Human Reproductive Health in the Light of Current Information.', 'CNS side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors: preclinical models, genetics and multimodality therapy.', 'No Association of ApoE Genotype with Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Nested Case-Control Study.', 'Association of the apolipoprotein E 2 allele with concurrent occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma.']"""

The objective of this study was to evaluate the tumor targeting of an internalizing human antibody fragment, a small-size platform, to provide high contrast in a mouse model of human prostate carcinoma.  Methods:   A prostate tumor-targeting single-chain antibody fragment (scFv), UA20, along with a nonbinding control scFv, N3M2, were labeled with (99m)Tc and evaluated for binding and rapid internalization into human prostate tumor cells in vitro and tumor homing in vivo using xenograft models. For the in vitro studies, the labeled UA20 scFv was incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 h with metastatic prostate cancer cells (DU145) to assess the total cellular uptake versus intracellular uptake. For the animal studies, labeled UA20 and N3M2 scFvs were administered to athymic mice implanted subcutaneously with DU145 cells. Mice were imaged with small-animal SPECT/CT with concomitant biodistribution at 1 and 3 h after injection.  Results:   The UA20 scFv was labeled in 55%-65% yield and remained stable in phosphate buffer within 24 h. The labeled UA20 scFv was taken up specifically by prostate tumor cells. Internalization was rapid, because incubation at 37 degrees C for less than 1 h resulted in 93% internalization of total cell-associated scFvs. In animal studies, SPECT/CT showed significant tumor uptake as early as 1 h after injection. At 3 h after injection, tumor uptake was 4.4 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g), significantly greater than all organs or tissues studied (liver, 2.7 %ID/g; other organs or tissues, <1 %ID/g), except the kidneys (81.4 %ID/g), giving tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios of 12:1 and 70:1, respectively. In contrast, the control antibody exhibited a tumor uptake of only 0.26 %ID/g, similar to that of muscle and fat. Tumor-specific targeting was evidenced by reduced tumor uptake of nearly 70% on administration of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled UA20 scFv. Kidney uptake was nonspecific, consistent with the route of excretion by scFvs.  Conclusion:   The UA20 scFv showed rapid and specific internalization in prostate tumor cells in vitro and accumulation in prostate tumor xenografts in vivo, demonstrating the potential for future development for prostate cancer imaging and targeted therapy.""","""['Jiang He', 'Yong Wang', 'Jinjin Feng', 'Xiaodong Zhu', 'Xiaoli Lan', 'Arun K Iyer', 'Niu Zhang', 'Youngho Seo', 'Henry F VanBrocklin', 'Bin Liu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Quantitative 99mTc Labeling Kit for HYNIC-Conjugated Single Chain Antibody Fragments Targeting Malignant Mesothelioma.', 'The effect of internalizing human single chain antibody fragment on liposome targeting to epithelioid and sarcomatoid mesothelioma.', 'Comparison of the biodistribution and tumor targeting of two 99mTc-labeled anti-EGFR nanobodies in mice, using pinhole SPECT/micro-CT.', '125I-T84.66 scFv-human serum albumin.', 'Optimized immobilization of single chain variable fragment antibody onto non-toxic fluorescent nanoparticles for efficient preparation of a bioprobe.', 'Treatment of Prostate Cancer with CD46-targeted 225Ac Alpha Particle Radioimmunotherapy.', 'CD46 targeted 212Pb alpha particle radioimmunotherapy for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Immunotherapeutic Targeting and PET Imaging of DLL3 in Small-Cell Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Imaging of Prostate Cancer Targeting CD46 Using ImmunoPET.', 'Quantitative 99mTc Labeling Kit for HYNIC-Conjugated Single Chain Antibody Fragments Targeting Malignant Mesothelioma.']"""

Methods and materials:   Among 1473 consecutive patients implanted with iodine-125 or palladium-103 sources before March 2006, there have been 55 biochemical failures. The dosimetric quality parameter, D(90), was updated according to the radionuclide and dosimetric era of the implant. For each patient, biologically equivalent dose (BED) and tumor control probability (TCP) were calculated from the updated implant D(90) plus any external beam dose using recommended indices and equations.  Results:   There was no significant difference in BED between biochemical failures and nonfailures, 148±27Gy and 145±24Gy, respectively (p=0.352). TCP was 0.90±0.26 for biochemical failures and 0.93±0.21 for nonfailures (p=0.414). Cox regression analysis found that neither BED nor TCP predicted for biochemical control either for the entire population or within each radionuclide-dependent dosimetric era. The only overall predictors of biochemical control were dosimetric era, Gleason score, and percent positive biopsies. Improvements in dosimetric quality over the first 300 patients were evident, but dosimetric era remained a better predictor of biochemical outcome than implant sequence number.  Conclusion:   In a large prostate implant population, dosimetric and derived radiobiologic parameters did not predict for failure.

With the increasing use of small planning target volume margins in EBRT, prostatic edema induced by HDRB can be a contributing factor to geometric miss when HDRB is performed before or during EBRT. We assessed prostate gland volumetric change after single-fraction HDRB and its impact on definition of treatment volume for EBRT.  Methods and materials:   Thirty-one consecutive patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with single-fraction HDRB (10 Gy) combined with hypofractionated EBRT were analyzed. A second CT scan was performed 7 days after HDRB, and images were coregistered with the planning CT scan that contained the original clinical target volume (CTV). The post-HDRB prostate CTV volume was compared with the original CTV by a single observer.  Results:   All patients presented volumetric variation. In most cases (68%), the prostate increased in volume, whereas it decreased in 32%. The mean prostatic volume was 42.2 cc before HDRB and 43.6 cc after HDRB, representing a mean volume difference of 3.4%, ranging from -14.2% to 23.8% (p=0.756). This difference is the result of mean changes of 0.6mm (-6.1 to 6.6) in the anterior-posterior, 0.5mm (-5.5 to 3.0) in the lateral, and 0.2mm (-5.0 to 5.0) in the superior-inferior axes.  Conclusions:   Although a nonsignificant volumetric change occurs after single-fraction HDRB, individual variations on specific axis could lead to important uncertainties during EBRT.""","""['Fabio L Cury', 'Marie Duclos', 'Armen Aprikian', 'Horacio Patrocinio', 'Luis Souhami']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Dosimetric effect of external beam planning preceding combined high-dose-rate brachytherapy of the prostate.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Second analysis to determine the correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Technology Insight: Combined external-beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Technological advances in radiotherapy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Being certain about uncertainties: a robust evaluation method for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy treatment plans including the combination of uncertainties.', 'A new implant device to prevent edema-associated underdosage in high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy of mobile tongue cancer.', 'Edema worsens target coverage in high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy of mobile tongue cancer: a report of two cases.', 'Prostate volume and implant configuration during 48 hours of temporary prostate brachytherapy: limited effect of oedema.', 'Dosimetry analyses comparing high-dose-rate brachytherapy, administered as monotherapy for localized prostate cancer, with stereotactic body radiation therapy simulated using CyberKnife.']"""

Despite the lack of information, one can assume that orphan receptors have important biological roles. In a retroviral insertion mutagenesis screen in the mouse, we identified GPR110 as an oncogene. This prompted us to study the potential isoforms that can be gleaned from known GPR110 transcripts, and the expression of these isoforms in normal and transformed human tissues.  Methods:   Various epitope-tagged isoforms of GPR110 were expressed in cell lines and assayed by western blotting to determine cleavage, surface localization, and secretion patterns. GPR110 transcript and protein levels were measured in lung and prostate cancer cell lines and clinical samples, respectively, by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   We found four potential splice variants of GPR110. Of these variants, we confirmed three as being expressed as proteins on the cell surface. Isoform 1 is the canonical form, with a molecular mass of about 100 kD. Isoforms 2 and 3 are truncated products of isoform 1, and are 25 and 23 kD, respectively. These truncated isoforms lack the seven-span transmembrane domain characteristic of GPR proteins and thus are not likely to be membrane anchored; indeed, isoform 2 can be secreted. Compared with the median gene expression of approximately 200 selected genes, GPR110 expression was low in most tissues. However, it had higher than average gene expression in normal kidney tissue and in prostate tissues originating from older donors. Although identified as an oncogene in murine T lymphomas, GPR110 is greatly overexpressed in human lung and prostate cancers. As detected by immunohistochemistry, GPR110 was overexpressed in 20 of 27 (74%) lung adenocarcinoma tissue cores and in 17 of 29 (59%) prostate adenocarcinoma tissue cores. Additionally, staining with a GPR110 antibody enabled us to differentiate between benign prostate hyperplasia and potential incipient malignancy.  Conclusion:   Our work suggests a role for GPR110 in tumor physiology and supports it as a potential therapeutic candidate and disease marker for both lung and prostate cancer.""","""['Amy M Lum', 'Bruce B Wang', 'Gabriele B Beck-Engeser', 'Lauri Li', 'Namitha Channa', 'Matthias Wabl']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Clinicopathological and prognostic significance of aberrant G protein-couple receptor 110 (GPR110) expression in gastric cancer.', 'Expression and prognostic role of orphan receptor GPR110 in glioma.', 'Orphan GPR110 (ADGRF1) targeted by N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine in development of neurons and cognitive function.', 'RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', 'Orphan receptors in prostate cancer.', 'Tethered agonist activated ADGRF1 structure and signalling analysis reveal basis for G protein coupling.', 'Structural basis of adhesion GPCR GPR110 activation by stalk peptide and G-proteins coupling.', 'Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors: structure, signaling, physiology, and pathophysiology.', 'Structural basis of tethered agonism of the adhesion GPCRs ADGRD1 and ADGRF1.', 'GPR116 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in gastric cancer.']"""

Men's responses to their situation were influenced by aspects of migration and historical context as well as culture. While medical treatment was highly valued, common difficulties were compounded by problems of health professional-patient communication, stereotyping and insensitivity of some staff. Lack of coordination between services and agencies adversely affected the well-being of frail men and widowers.

Methods:   The RI method was applied to 26 males with clinically localized HRPC, subjected to radical prostatectomy in 2006-2008. All had poor pathological characteristics: initial PSA > 15 ng/ml, Gleason score > 7, clinically suspected extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and/or positive pelvic lymph nodes (LNs). The radiopharmaceutical (Tc-99m) was injected preoperatively at 4 zones of the periphery of the prostate. Tc-99m-nanocolloid particles were <or= 80 nm in size, with total activity of 3 mCi (111 MBq), diluted in 2 mL. One hour after Tc-99m administration, a planar scintigraphy was performed on a gamma camera in anterior, posterior and lateral projections. A high resolution collimator was used, gathering impulses up to 300,000 per frame. The precise location of the SLNs was determined intraoperatively by a gamma probe. The LNs removed by extended pelvic lymphadenectomy were arranged on an anatomical template, examined ex vivo by the gamma probe and scanned again. The LNs were cleaned from the adjacent fatty tissue, fixed in neutral formalin, and then processed separately for histological and immunohistochemical examination.  Results:   The number of surgically removed LNs ranged from 9 to 38 (mean 13), and the SLNs from 1 to 7 (mean 3). The SLNs were visualized on lymphoscintigraphy as strictly defined, round zones of high activity and were easily recognized intraoperatively by the gamma probe. The scintigraphic images of the scanned anatomical templates correlated well with those prior to surgery.

Methods:   From 1998 through 2003, 333 patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were treated in two institutions with definitive EBRT to a median dose of 72 Gy and 80% of them received short- or long-term AD. Biochemical failure was defined using ASTRO criteria with 3 consecutive rises in prostate specific antigen (PSA).  Results:   Median follow up was 36 months. Gleason score, initial PSA, risk grouping, PCB%, AD and total duration of AD were found to be significant predictors for biochemical outcome in univariate analysis. Independent predictors for PSA failure on multivariate analysis were PCB% and duration of AD. Among 3 risk groups, in the intermediate risk group the biochemical control was significantly better in patients with < 67% positive core biopsies. In the subgroup analysis of patients who received a prostatic dose <or= 70.2 Gy, and patients with no hormonal or short-term hormonal manipulation the 5-year biochemical outcome was significantly reduced in patients with >or= 67% positive core biopsies. These significant differences did not exist in patients receiving > 70.2 Gy and long-term hormonal therapy.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that high PCB% could be a predictor of biochemical relapse, especially in the intermediate risk group.

The recommended dosage is an initial load of 400 mg/m² intravenously (IV) followed by a weekly maintenance dose of 250 mg/m². It has been reported retrospectively that cetuximab efficacy was correlated with dose-related severity of skin rash. This study was prospectively designed to examine the safety and feasibility of escalating weekly doses of cetuximab, testing the hypothesis of the relationship of dose-dependent skin toxicity and efficacy. Methods Four dose levels were tested: Cetuximab 400 mg/m² IV loading dose and 250, 300, 350, 400 mg/m² weekly IV maintenance. There was no intra-patient dose escalation. Standard dose limiting toxicity criteria were used. Rash was evaluated using two additional validated dermatology methods: global acne grading scale (GAGS) and acne lesion counting (ALC). Tumor specimens and blood samples were obtained for correlative analyses.  Results:   Twenty seven patients with solid tumors were enrolled: five head and neck, three pancreas, four gall bladder, two each of prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, and esophagus, and five others. Planned dose escalation was completed without reaching dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The highest dose level was expanded to a total of 17 patients. Gr 3/4 toxicities included: lymphopenia (2), fatigue (2), and hypomagnesemia (2). One patient experienced a grade 3 rash (350 mg/m²). Sixty five percent of pts had a ≥ Gr 2 rash that was not dose dependent. In 22 evaluable patients, there was one partial response (PR) in a patient with cholangiocarcinoma (400 mg/m²) and seven patients had stable disease (SD). ALC and GAGS demonstrated no correlation with dose or response. Correlative studies evaluating k-ras, EGFR FISH status and immunologic correlatives were conducted on available tumor samples.  Conclusions:   Cetuximab administered at 400 mg/m² IV as a loading dose with weekly maintenance dose of 400 mg/m² is feasible and well tolerated.

We evaluated the association between these objects and survival in patients with prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Included in this follow-up study were 179 patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. CellSearch was used to isolate EpCAM+ objects and to stain DNA, cytokeratin and CD45. All EpCAM+CK+ objects were subdivided into seven classes on the basis of predefined morphological appearance in 63 independent samples. Association of each class with survival was studied using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.  Results:   Each EpCAM+CK+CD45- class showed a strong association with overall survival (P < 0.001). This included small tumor microparticles (S-TMP), which did not require a nucleus and thus are unable to metastasize. A higher number of objects in any class was associated with decreased survival. A good prediction model included large tumor cell fragments (L-TCF), age, hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase. Models with S-TMP or CTC instead of L-TCF performed similarly.

However, the effects of VDR activation have not been examined in the presence of the recently identified androgen-regulated TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusions, which occur in a high percentage of prostate cancers and play a role in growth and invasiveness. In a previous microarray study, we found that VDR activation induces TMPRSS2 expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Here we show that the natural VDR agonist 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and its synthetic analog EB1089 increase expression of TMPRSS2:ERG mRNA in VCaP prostate cancer cells; this results in increased ETS-related gene (ERG) protein expression and ERG activity as demonstrated by an increase in the ERG target gene CACNA1D. In VCaP cells, we were not able to prevent EB1089-mediated TMPRSS2:ERG induction with an androgen receptor antagonist, Casodex, although in LNCaP cells, as reported for some other common androgen receptor and VDR target genes, Casodex reduces EB1089-mediated induction of TMPRSS2. However, despite inducing the fusion gene, VDR agonists reduce VCaP cell growth and expression of the ERG target gene c-Myc, a critical factor in VDR-mediated growth inhibition.

We have previously shown that 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) increases the stability of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1), decreases cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity, and promotes G(1) phase accumulation in human prostate cancer cells. These effects correlate with cytoplasmic relocalization of CDK2. In this study, we investigated the role of CDK2 cytoplasmic relocalization in the antiproliferative effects of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). CDK2 was found to be necessary for prostate cancer cell proliferation. Although induced by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3), the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) was dispensable for 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated growth inhibition. Reduction in CDK2 activity by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) was associated with decreased T160 phosphorylation, a residue whose phosphorylation in the nucleus is essential for CDK2 activity. Ectopic expression of cyclin E was sufficient to overcome 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated cytoplasmic mislocalization of CDK2 and all antiproliferative effects of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3), yet endogenous levels of cyclin E or binding to CDK2 were not affected by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Similarly, knockdown of the CDK2 substrate retinoblastoma, which causes cyclin E up-regulation, resulted in resistance to 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated growth inhibition. Human prostate cancer cells resistant to growth inhibition by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) but retaining fully functional vitamin D receptors were developed. These cells did not exhibit 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated cytoplasmic relocalization of CDK2. Targeting CDK2 to the nucleus of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-sensitive cancer cells blocked G(1) accumulation and growth inhibition by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3).

We found that UA treatment in vitro can effectively inhibit PC-3 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis, demonstrated by annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining. Both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways appear to be triggered by UA treatment, because inhibiting activation of both caspase-8 and -9 could prevent UA-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was found to be activated, followed by Bcl-2 phosphorylation and activation of caspase-9. On the other hand, UA inhibited the Akt pathway, subsequently upregulating the expression of Fas ligand (FasL), which initiates death receptor-mediated apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Importantly, experimentally lowering FasL expression by siRNA significantly inhibited UA-induced caspase-8 activation and at least partly attenuated the consequent apoptosis, suggesting an involvement of FasL and its regulating pathway in the cell killing effect of UA. UA also inhibited cell invasion by downregulating matrix metalloproteinase-9 via inhibition of Akt in PC-3 cells. Although further evaluation of the UA effects in vivo is needed, the present results suggest the potential utility of UA as a novel therapeutic agent in advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Yuxi Zhang', 'Chuize Kong', 'Yu Zeng', 'Linhui Wang', 'Zhenhua Li', 'Huiqing Wang', 'Chuanliang Xu', 'Yinghao Sun']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-3 via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in ursolic acid-induced DU145 cells apoptosis.', 'Ursolic acid overcomes Bcl-2-mediated resistance to apoptosis in prostate cancer cells involving activation of JNK-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation and degradation.', 'Downregulation of survivin and activation of caspase-3 through the PI3K/Akt pathway in ursolic acid-induced HepG2 cell apoptosis.', ""Research progress of ursolic acid's anti-tumor actions."", 'Ursolic acid, a potential anticancer compound for breast cancer therapy.', 'Natural compounds ursolic acid and digoxin exhibit inhibitory activities to cancer cells in RORγ-dependent and -independent manner.', 'Ursolic Acid against Prostate and Urogenital Cancers: A Review of In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.', 'Metagenomic insights into the rumen epithelial integrity responses to the vitamin B1 supplement under high-concentrate diets treatments.', 'Gold nanoparticles loaded chitosan encapsulate 6-mercaptopurine as a novel nanocomposite for chemo-photothermal therapy on breast cancer.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.']"""

Patients and methods In this phase 1, open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized study, 75 mg/m² docetaxel was administered on Day 1 of each of nine 21-day treatment cycles and intetumumab 5 or 10 mg/kg was administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 2 and 3 and on Day 1 of all subsequent cycles. The primary endpoint was the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during Cycles 2 and 3. Secondary endpoints included serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and objective response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).  Results:   Ten patients were treated (5 mg/kg n = 3, 10 mg/kg n = 7). No DLTs occurred. Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in the 10-mg/kg intetumumab group. Common TEAEs were neutropenia (10 mg/kg n = 6) and nausea (5 mg/kg n = 1, 10 mg/kg n = 5). Four 10-mg/kg-treated patients reported serious TEAEs; of these, only febrile neutropenia was considered probably intetumumab-related. In the 10-mg/kg group, four patients had a serum PSA response (two of whom responded within 3 months of treatment), one patient demonstrated partial tumor response for 11 weeks, and none had progressive disease at Cycle 9. No PSA or tumor response was observed in the 5-mg/kg group.  Conclusions:   Intetumumab was generally safe and well tolerated in combination with docetaxel, with a higher incidence of TEAEs in the 10 mg/kg dose cohort.

The robot can manually be translated and rotated resulting in five degrees of freedom. It contains a pneumatically driven tapping device to automatically insert a needle stepwise into the prostate using a controller unit outside the scanning room. To define the target positions and to verify the needle insertion point and the needle trajectory, a high-resolution 3D balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) scan that provides a T2/T1-weighted contrast is acquired. During the needle insertion fast 2D bSSFP images are generated to track the needle on-line. When the target position is reached, the radiation oncologist manually places a fiducial gold marker (small seed) at this location. In total two needle trajectories are used to place all markers. Afterwards, a high-resolution 3D bSSFP scan is acquired to visualize the fiducial gold markers. Four fiducial gold markers were placed transperineally into the prostate of a patient with a clinical stage T3 prostate cancer. In the generated scans, it was possible to discriminate the patient's anatomy, the needle and the markers. All markers were delivered inside the prostate. The procedure time was 1.5 h.

In the brain, it is a key player in the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Its physiological function is however less well understood. Previous studies showed that APP is up-regulated in prostate, colon, pancreatic tumor, and oral squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we show that APP has an essential role in growth control of pancreatic and colon cancer. Abundant APP staining was found in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colon cancer tissue. Interestingly, treating pancreatic and colon cancer cells with valproic acid (VPA, 2-propylpentanoic acid), a known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, leads to up-regulation of GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone immunoglobulin-binding protein. GRP78 is involved in APP maturation and inhibition of tumor cell growth by down-regulation of APP and secreted soluble APPalpha. Trichostatin A, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, also lowered APP and increased GRP78 levels. In contrast, treating cells with valpromide, a VPA derivative lacking HDAC inhibitory properties, had no effect on APP levels. VPA did not modify the level of epidermal growth factor receptor, another type I transmembrane protein, and APLP2, a member of the APP family, demonstrating the specificity of the VPA effect on APP. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of APP also resulted in significantly decreased cell growth. Based on these observations, the data suggest that APP down-regulation via HDAC inhibition provides a novel mechanism for pancreatic and colon cancer therapy.""","""['Vivek Venkataramani', 'Christian Rossner', 'Lara Iffland', 'Stefan Schweyer', 'Irfan Y Tamboli', 'Jochen Walter', 'Oliver Wirths', 'Thomas A Bayer']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Modulation of adhesion and growth of colon and pancreatic cancer cells by the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid.', 'Adenomatous polyposis coli determines sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells.', 'Downregulation of TrkB Expression and Signaling by Valproic Acid and Other Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors.', 'Anticonvulsant valproic acid and other short-chain fatty acids as novel anticancer therapeutics: Possibilities and challenges.', 'Molecular and therapeutic potential and toxicity of valproic acid.', 'Repurposed Drugs in Gastric Cancer.', 'Genome-Wide Analysis of microRNA and mRNA Expression in Colorectal Intramucosal Neoplasia and Colorectal Cancer With a Microsatellite-Stable Phenotype Based on Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequences.', 'Effects of Luteolin on Human Breast Cancer Using Gene Expression Array: Inferring Novel Genes.', 'Valproic Acid-Induced CCN1 Promotes Osteogenic Differentiation by Increasing CCN1 Protein Stability through HDAC1 Inhibition in Tonsil-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells.', 'Combined evaluation of proliferation and apoptosis to calculate IC50 of VPA-induced PANC-1 cells and assessing its effect on the Wnt signaling pathway.']"""

Results:   Low phosphorylation of EGFR in prostate epithelial cells, both in the tumor and surprisingly also in the surrounding nonmalignant tissue, was associated with significantly longer cancer-specific survival in prostate cancer patients. This association remained significant when Gleason score and local tumor stage were added together with pEGFR to a Cox regression model. Tumor epithelial pEGFR immunoreactivity was significantly correlated to tumor cell proliferation, tumor vascular density, and nonmalignant epithelial pEGFR immunoreactivity.

We have established a novel mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer, KUCaP-2, which expresses the wild-type androgen receptor (AR) and which produces the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In this model, tumors regress soon after castration, but then reproducibly restore their ability to proliferate after 1 to 2 months without AR mutation, mimicking the clinical behavior of CRPC. In the present study, we used this model to identify novel therapeutic targets for CRPC. Evaluating tumor tissues at various stages by gene expression profiling, we discovered that the prostaglandin E receptor EP4 subtype (EP4) was significantly upregulated during progression to castration resistance. Immunohistochemical results of human prostate cancer tissues confirmed that EP4 expression was higher in CRPC compared with hormone-naïve prostate cancer. Ectopic overexpression of EP4 in LNCaP cells (LNCaP-EP4 cells) drove proliferation and PSA production in the absence of androgen supplementation in vitro and in vivo. Androgen-independent proliferation of LNCaP-EP4 cells was suppressed when AR expression was attenuated by RNA interference. Treatment of LNCaP-EP4 cells with a specific EP4 antagonist, ONO-AE3-208, decreased intracellular cyclic AMP levels, suppressed PSA production in vitro, and inhibited castration-resistant growth of LNCaP-EP4 or KUCaP-2 tumors in vivo. Our findings reveal that EP4 overexpression, via AR activation, supports an important mechanism for castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer. Furthermore, they prompt further evaluation of EP4 antagonists as a novel therapeutic modality to treat CRPC.""","""['Naoki Terada', 'Yosuke Shimizu', 'Tomomi Kamba', 'Takahiro Inoue', 'Atsushi Maeno', 'Takashi Kobayashi', 'Eijiro Nakamura', 'Toshiyuki Kamoto', 'Toshiya Kanaji', 'Takayuki Maruyama', 'Yoshiki Mikami', 'Yoshinobu Toda', 'Toshiyuki Matsuoka', 'Yasushi Okuno', 'Gozoh Tsujimoto', 'Shuh Narumiya', 'Osamu Ogawa']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Monomethylated selenium inhibits growth of LNCaP human prostate cancer xenograft accompanied by a decrease in the expression of androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).', 'An EP4 antagonist ONO-AE3-208 suppresses cell invasion, migration, and metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Y-box binding protein-1 promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer growth via androgen receptor expression.', 'Key targets of hormonal treatment of prostate cancer.

The goal of the present study was to determine the safety and efficacy of VSV treatment of prostate tumors that arise in situ in immunocompetent, transgenic prostate-specific PTEN-null (PTEN(-/-)) mice. Interferon-sensitive VSV(AV3 strain), which expresses luciferase, was injected intraprostatically into tumor-bearing PTEN(-/-) and control mice and then monitored for tissue bioluminescence over 96 hours. Virus readily dispersed throughout the bodies of mice after only 3 hours; however, it persisted at high levels for >72 hours in PTEN(-/-) mice, but at relatively low levels and for only approximately 48 hours in controls. Plaque assays provided a similar pattern, with much higher concentrations of replicating virus in prostates of PTEN(-/-) mice than in controls. Transient, low levels of virus were detected in the spleens of both groups. Apoptotic analyses by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining revealed that VSV(AV3) is able to selectively infect and kill prostate cells in PTEN(-/-) mice, while sparing normal cells in control mice. The primary mechanism for cell kill is apparently apoptotic oncolysis as opposed to neutrophil invasion as has been reported using xenograft models. These results suggest that control of locally advanced human prostate cancer may be achievable through intraprostatic injection and amplification of a safe oncolytic virus, such as VSV(AV3).""","""['Maryam Moussavi', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Howard Tearle', 'Yubin Guo', 'Michael Cox', 'John Bell', 'Christopher Ong', 'William Jia', 'Paul S Rennie']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Changes in Susceptibility to Oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Virus during Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting and killing of metastatic cells in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate model with vesicular stomatitis virus.', 'Curcumin promotes the oncoltyic capacity of vesicular stomatitis virus for the treatment of prostate cancers.', 'Oncotargeting by Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV): Advances in Cancer Therapy.', 'VSV-tumor selective replication and protein translation.', 'Emulating interactions between microorganisms and tumor microenvironment to develop cancer theranostics.', 'Expanding the Spectrum of Pancreatic Cancers Responsive to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-Based Oncolytic Virotherapy: Challenges and Solutions.', 'MAP3K7 and CHD1 Are Novel Mediators of Resistance to Oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Virus in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Experimental Evolution Generates Novel Oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Viruses with Improved Replication in Virus-Resistant Pancreatic Cancer Cells.', 'Rhabdoviruses, Antiviral Defense, and SUMO Pathway.']"""

Whether this increase is entirely a consequence of the RA disease and/or its treatment or is reflective of shared susceptibility to the two diseases remains unclear. We undertook this study to assess whether patients with RA are already at increased risk of lymphoma or of other cancers before the diagnosis of RA, and if the relative risk increases with time since RA diagnosis.  Methods:   Patients with incident RA (symptom duration <1 year) (n = 6,745) registered in the Swedish Early Arthritis Registry from 1997 through 2006 were identified. For each patient, 5 general population controls were randomly matched by sex, age, marital status, and residence (n = 33,657). For all study subjects, inclusion in the nationwide Swedish Cancer Register in 1958-2006 was determined. Relative risks (RRs) (with 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]) of lymphoma and of cancer overall, before and after diagnosis of RA, were estimated using conditional logistic regression and Cox regression, respectively.  Results:   Before diagnosis of RA, there was no observed increase in the risk of lymphoma (RR [odds ratio] 0.67 [95% CI 0.37-1.23]) or other cancers (RR 0.78 [95% CI 0.70-0.88]). During the first 10 years following diagnosis of RA, the overall RR (hazard ratio) of lymphoma development was 1.75 (95 % CI 1.04-2.96).  Conclusion:   These findings indicate that overall, a history of cancer, including lymphoma, does not increase the risk of subsequent RA development. Shared susceptibility to RA and lymphoma may thus be of limited importance.

Several signaling pathways have been identified as players in prostate cancer development. Chronic prostatitis, for example, due to infections, is a suggested risk factor for prostate cancer. Endogenous production of reactive oxygen species during inflammation may lead to oxidative DNA damage, which can be mutagenic, if unrepaired. Androgen signaling, cytokine (IL-6, IL-4) and growth factor signaling (e.g., IGF, Wnt/beta-catenin) cross-talk via PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and Jak/STAT pathways have been identified as major controllers of prostate growth. During disease progression, and after androgen ablation therapy, the remaining operational pathways are upregulated to compensate for the lost growth signal, finally resulting in androgen-independent prostate cancer. Lycopene modulates several of the aforementioned pathways, providing a promising rationale for prostate cancer risk reduction by lycopene: In many experimental setups, lycopene reduced inflammatory signals, prevented oxidative DNA damage, modulated the expression or activity of IGF axis members, of Wnt/beta-catenin and androgen signalling, and enhanced gap junctional communication. Lycopene's influence on these pathways likely contributes to the observed cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by lycopene.

Terbufos has not been demonstrated to be carcinogenic in rodents, although non-arsenical insecticides, including OPs, have been associated with excess cancer in epidemiologic studies. We investigated associations between use of terbufos and the incidence of cancer.  Methods:   The Agricultural Health Study is a prospective cohort study of 57,310 licensed pesticide applicators from Iowa and North Carolina. Detailed information about 50 pesticides, including terbufos, and potential confounders was obtained from self-administered questionnaires. Terbufos intensity-weighted lifetime exposure-days were defined as (lifetime exposure-days) x (exposure intensity score). Cases include all first primary cancers diagnosed between enrollment and December 31, 2005.

(86)Y-CHX-A''-DTPA-cetuximab can also serve as a surrogate marker for (90)Y therapy.  Methods:   Bifunctional chelate, CHX-A''-DTPA was conjugated to cetuximab and radiolabeled with (86)Y. In vitro immunoreactivity was assessed in HER1-expressing A431 cells. In vivo biodistribution, PET imaging and noncompartmental pharmacokinetics were performed in mice bearing HER1-expressing human colorectal (LS-174T and HT29), prostate (PC-3 and DU145), ovarian (SKOV3) and pancreatic (SHAW) tumor xenografts. Receptor blockage was demonstrated by coinjection of either 0.1 or 0.2 mg cetuximab.  Results:   (86)Y-CHX-A''-DTPA-cetuximab was routinely prepared with a specific activity of 1.5-2 GBq/mg and in vitro cell-binding in the range 65-75%. Biodistribution and PET imaging studies demonstrated high HER1-specific tumor uptake of the radiotracer and clearance from nonspecific organs. In LS-174T tumor-bearing mice injected with (86)Y-CHX-A''-DTPA-cetuximab alone, (86)Y-CHX-A''-DTPA-cetuximab plus 0.1 mg cetuximab or 0.2 mg cetuximab, the tumor uptake values at 3 days were 29.3 +/- 4.2, 10.4 +/- 0.5 and 6.4 +/- 0.3%ID/g, respectively, demonstrating dose-dependent blockage of the target. Tumors were clearly visualized 1 day after injecting 3.8-4.0 MBq (86)Y-CHX-A''-DTPA-cetuximab.

Tumor uptake values quantified by PET were closely correlated (r (2) = 0.9, n = 18) with values determined by biodistribution studies.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrated the feasibility of preparation of high specific activity (86)Y-CHX-A''-DTPA-cetuximab and its application for quantitative noninvasive PET imaging of HER1-expressing tumors.

As indicated by assays that measure plasma membrane integrity, phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial activity, and activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, celastrol potentiated the TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, and converted TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL-sensitive cells. When examined for its mechanism, we found that the triterpene down-regulated the expression of cell survival proteins including cFLIP, IAP-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, and XIAP and up-regulated Bax expression. In addition, we found that celastrol induced the cell surface expression of both the TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5. This increase in receptors was noted in a wide variety of cancer cells including breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, esophageal, and pancreatic cancer cells, and myeloid and leukemia cells. Gene silencing of the death receptor abolished the effect of celastrol on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Induction of the death receptor by the triterpenoid was found to be p53-independent but required the induction of CAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), inasmuch as gene silencing of CHOP abolished the induction of DR5 expression by celastrol and associated enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We found that celastrol also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and ROS sequestration inhibited celastrol-induced expression of CHOP and DR5, and consequent sensitization to TRAIL.

This study investigates the association of smoking with other cancers by correlating them with the regional incidence rates for lung cancer, which was used as a proxy for cigarette smoking. This ecologic approach relating cigarette smoking to cancer using a large database avoids the limitations and bias present in case-control and cohort studies.  Methods:   Based on the assumption that regions with a high rate of lung cancer also have a high rate of cigarette smoking, our original hypothesis is that these high-intensity regions will also have high rates of other cancers if they are associated with cigarette smoking. Linear regression and correlation analysis of regional incidence rates for lung cancer, obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, were plotted with incidence rates of other cancers to determine the association between lung cancer and the other cancers.  Results:   Cancers that have a strong correlation with cigarette smoking in the literature also demonstrate a strong correlation with lung cancer. These cancers included urinary bladder, laryngeal, esophageal, colorectal, and kidney cancer.

The cornerstone treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is androgen deprivation, which has known effects on prostate tissue apoptosis and thymic regrowth. These findings, together with interest in developing immune-based treatments for prostate cancer, lead us to question whether androgen deprivation causes changes in the adaptive immune responses of prostate cancer patients, and whether the timing of changes has implications for the sequencing of immunotherapies in combination with androgen deprivation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from patients before beginning androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and at several time points thereafter. These cells were analyzed for the frequency of specific lymphocyte populations and their response to stimulation. The development of prostate antigen-specific immune responses was assessed using SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression). Patients developed expansion of the naive T-cell compartment persisting over the course of androgen deprivation, together with an increase in effector-cell response to stimulation, and the generation of prostate tissue-associated IgG antibody responses, implying a potential benefit to the use of ADT in combination with prostate cancer-directed immunotherapies.

Methods and materials:   Twenty-three hundred patients (1563 iodine-125 [(125)I] and 737 palladium-103 [(103)Pd]) from 78 brachytherapists with postimplant rectal dosimetry were identified. Seed activity was stratified into three tertiles for each isotope (≤0.300, 0.301-0.326, and >0.326 mCi/seed for (125)I and ≤1.330, 1.331-1.547, and >1.547 mCi/seed for (103)Pd). Postimplant dosimetry was performed in a standardized fashion. The rectum was contoured by outlining the outer rectal wall. The volume of the rectum receiving 100% of the prescription dose (R(100)) was calculated in cubic centimeters. The prostate V(100) and D(90) volumes were also calculated.  Results:   The mean prostate volume was 35.8 and 32.3 cm(3) for (125)I and (103)Pd. The median time to postimplant CT was 30 days. For (125)I, the V(100) increased from 91.0% to 93.7% (p=0.012) and the D(90) increased from 105.9% to 108.7% (p<0.001) for the lowest to the highest (125)I seed activities. In contrast, no significant changes in V(100) (p=0.751) or D(90) (p=0.200) were discerned when stratified by seed activity. For both isotopes, there was no correlation between seed activity and R(100), and R(100) was highest for the intermediate seed activities. Overall, the R(100) was lower for (103)Pd vs. (125)I (0.63 vs. 0.82 cm(3), p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Within the confines of seed activities used in this study, higher activity seeds did not result in a deleterious effect on rectal dose.

Patients and methods:   Thirty-eight patients, median age 71 (range, 50-81) years with localized prostate carcinoma randomized to one of two radiation dose schedules underwent colonic transit scintigraphy and assessment of anorectal symptoms (questionnaire), anorectal function (manometry), and anal sphincteric morphology (endoanal ultrasound) before and at 1 month and 1 year after RT.  Results:   Whole and distal colonic transit increased 1 month after RT, with faster distal colonic transit only persisting at 1 year. Frequency and urgency of defecation, fecal incontinence, and rectal bleeding increased 1 month after RT and persisted at 1 year. Basal anal pressures remained unchanged, but progressive reductions occurred in anal squeeze pressures and responses to increased intra-abdominal pressure. Rectal compliance decreased progressively in the patients, although no changes in anorectal sensory function ensued. Radiotherapy had no effect on the morphology of the internal and external anal sphincters. Distal colonic retention was weakly related to rectal compliance at 1 month, but both faster colonic transit and reduced rectal compliance were more frequent with increased fecal urgency. At 1 year, a weak inverse relationship existed between colonic half-clearance time and frequency of defecation, although both faster whole-colonic transit and reduced rectal compliance occurred more often with increased stool frequency.

The present study was conducted to test the anti-cancer activity of pterostilbene purified from Pterocarpus marsupium on breast (MCF-7) and prostate (PC3) cancer cell lines. The purified pterostilbene was found to cause apoptosis in both the cell lines, which was marked by DNA fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies and membrane distortions. Apoptosis probably was due to the production of reactive oxygen species in MCF-7 and nitric oxide over production in PC3 cells. Even the drug detoxifying anti-oxidant enzymes could not nullify the effect of pterostilbene as required by the cancer cells for survival. Pterostilbene was found to inhibit the cell proliferating factors like Akt, Bcl-2 and induced the mitochondrial apoptotic signals like Bax, and the series of caspases. It also inhibited Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and alpha-methylacyl-CoA recemase (AMACR), two very well known metastasis inducers. In conclusion, pterostilbene has multiple target sites to induce apoptosis.

Patients and methods:   Although >90% of patients in the USA are diagnosed with LPC, approximately 94% of them choose treatment, such that newly diagnosed patients need individualized counselling to address misperceptions about the management of LPC. The internal consistency of an 18-item KUJ scale was evaluated among 184 patients recently diagnosed with LPC at a major urology practice. Principal-component analyses were applied for computing a KUJ index. Logistic regression modelling was used to identify predictors of the KUJ index.

Patients and methods:   This was a retrospective case-control study using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare database. Patients with prostate cancer diagnosed between 1995 and 1998 (50 147 men) were identified and followed retrospectively for 1 year before and 5 years after the diagnosis. Phase-specific HRU and DMC costs were compared between racial and ethnic groups using parametric and nonparametric analysis. To compute the incremental cost of prostate cancer, a matched non-cancer control group was extracted from Medicare database. Poisson and general linear models (log-link) were used to identify the association of race and ethnicity with HRU and DMC cost, after controlling for potentially influential clinical and demographic covariates.  Results:   The African-American group was more likely to have emergency-room visits (odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.28) and less likely to have outpatient visits (0.96, 0.96-0.97) than whites. However, the Hispanic group was more likely to have inpatient and outpatient visits (odds ratio 0.88, 0.83-0.91; and 0.93, 0.91-0.95) than whites. Adjusted DMC cost showed racial and ethnic variation in all phases except the treatment and terminal phases. Factors associated with DMC cost varied among racial and ethnic groups.  Conclusion:   The incremental burden of prostate cancer remains significant in the long term. Overall, the cost of prostate cancer care was higher among African-American men than white and Hispanic men.

The aim of this study is to describe and interpret trends in relative survival and excess mortality in the five Nordic populations.  Material and methods:   Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates, 5-year relative survival, and excess mortality rates for varying follow-up periods are presented, as are age-specific 5-year relative survival by country, sex and 5-year diagnostic period.  Results:   The vast majority of male genital cancer incident cases and deaths are prostate cancers, with 5-year and 10-year survival trends resembling the diagnostic-led increasing incidence over the past 25 years. Five-year prostate cancer survival is estimated at 53% in Denmark compared to 78% or above in the other Nordic populations for patients diagnosed 1999-2003. Excess mortality has declined over time, with Denmark having a greater excess of deaths compared to the other countries, irrespective of time of diagnosis. Concomitant with the declines in testicular cancer mortality, testicular cancer survival has increased since the 1970s in each Nordic country. Men diagnosed with testicular cancer in recent decades have had, on average, a continually better prognosis with time, with relative 5-year survival for patients diagnosed 1999-2003 ranging from 88% in Finland to 94% in Sweden. For the few patients diagnosed with cancer of the penis and other male genital organs, survival trends have been rather stable over time, with recent 5-year relative survival estimates ranging from 62% in Finland to 80% in Norway.  Conclusions:   There are intriguing country-specific and temporal variations in male genital cancer survival in the Nordic countries. Prognosis varies widely by cancer site and relates to both changing diagnostic and clinical practices.

On the basis of these data, the authors conducted a phase 2 trial of intravenous (iv) calcitriol at a dose of 74 microg weekly (based on a recent phase 1 trial) and dexamethasone in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   A 2-stage Kepner-Chang design was used. Oral dexamethasone at a dose of 4 mg was given weekly on Days 1 and 2, and iv calcitriol (74 microg over 1 hour) was administered weekly on Day 2 from 4 to 8 hours after the dexamethasone dose in patients with CRPC. Laboratory data were monitored weekly, and renal sonograms, computed tomography scans, and bone scans were obtained every 3 months. Disease response was assessed by using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and standard criteria for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. The calcitriol dose was delineated by from the authors' recent phase 1 trial.  Results:   Of 18 evaluable patients, 15 patients were Caucasian (83%).

To elucidate potential effect of hypoxia on ELL, cell growth and colony formation assays were performed using PC3 subline with stable ELL overexpression.  Results:   ELL is associated with HIF-1alpha in transfected cells. In PC3 prostate cancer cells, ELL inhibited HIF-1alpha protein level and down-stream gene expression.

We previously established Snail-mediated EMT model utilizing androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. These cells express increased vimentin protein and relocalization of E-cadherin from the cell membrane to the cytosol. Interestingly, Snail transfection in LNCaP cells resulted in cells acquiring a neuroendocrine (NE)-like morphology with long neurite-like processes.  Methods:   We tested for expression of NE markers neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and chromogranin A (CgA) by Western blot analysis, and performed proliferation assays to test for paracrine cell proliferation.  Results:   LNCaP cells transfected with Snail displayed increase in the NE markers, NSE and CgA as well as translocation of androgen receptor (AR) to the nucleus. LNCaP C-33 cells that have been previously published as a neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) model exhibited increased expression levels of Snail protein as compared to LNCaP parental cells. Functionally, conditioned medium from the LNCaP-Snail transfected cells increased proliferation of parental LNCaP and PC-3 cells, which could be abrogated by NSE/CgA siRNA. Additionally, NED in LNCaP-C33 cells or that induced in parental LNCaP cells by serum starvation could be inhibited by knockdown of Snail with siRNA.  Conclusion:   Overall our data provide evidence that Snail transcription factor may promote tumor aggressiveness in the LNCaP cells through multiple processes; induction of EMT may be required to promote migration, while NED may promote tumor proliferation by a paracrine mechanism. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of Snail may prove beneficial in not only abrogating EMT but also NED.""","""['Danielle McKeithen', 'Tisheeka Graham', 'Leland W K Chung', 'Valerie Odero-Marah']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha signaling is involved in androgen depletion-induced neuroendocrine differentiation of androgen-sensitive LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen deprivation induces human prostate epithelial neuroendocrine differentiation of androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells.', 'Interleukin-6 induces neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) through suppression of RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST).', 'Interleukin-6 undergoes transition from growth inhibitor associated with neuroendocrine differentiation to stimulator accompanied by androgen receptor activation during LNCaP prostate cancer cell progression.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Neurokinin-1 receptor drives PKCɑ-AURKA/N-Myc signaling to facilitate the neuroendocrine progression of prostate cancer.', 'CgB promotes EMT and stemness via MAPK pathway in colonic neuroendocrine carcinoma.', 'Targeting PKLR/MYCN/ROMO1 signaling suppresses neuroendocrine differentiation of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Phenotypic Plasticity - Alternate Transcriptional Programs Driving Treatment Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.']"""

Availability of a human prostate cancer cell line with high level of IL13Ralpha2 expression will facilitate the development of therapeutic modalities.  Methods:   ARCaP(E) and ARCaP(M) human prostate cancer cell lines were subjected to comparative analyses of gene expression. Expression of the IL13Ralpha2 protein was confirmed by Western blotting and immunostaining. IL13Ralpha2 proteins in xenograft tumors and clinical human prostate cancer specimens were detected by specific antibodies. LNCaP prostate cancer cells stably transfected with IL13Ralpha2 were examined for accelerated growth in athymic mice.  Results:   We found that IL13Ralpha2 proteins could be detected in both the ARCaP(E) and ARCaP(M) cells, but the expression level in ARCaP(M) was more than 17-fold higher than in ARCaP(E) cells. Importantly, the ARCaP lineage represented the only human prostate cancer cell line that expresses IL13Ralpha2 proteins at the level detectable by Western blotting. Expression of IL13Ralpha2 was accompanied by resistance to the anti-tumor activity of interleukin-13 (IL-13). ARCaP cells were found to be insensitive to growth inhibition upon IL-13 treatment, while overexpression of IL13Ralpha2 in LNCaP cells promoted intratibial tumor growth in athymic mice.  Conclusions:   Differential IL13Ralpha2 expression may account for the high tumorigenic and metastatic potential of ARCaP(M) cells.

When tumors reached 200 mm(3), 15 mice/group were randomized to one of seven diets and sacrificed when tumors reached 1,500 mm(3): Group 1: ad libitum 7 days/week; Group 2: fasted 1 day/week and ad libitum 6 days/week; Group 3: fasted 1 day/week and fed 6 days/week via paired feeding to maintain isocaloric conditions to Group 1; Group 4: 14% CR 7 days/week; Group 5: fasted 2 days/week and ad libitum 5 days/week; Group 6: fasted 2 day/week and fed 5 days/week via paired feeding to maintain isocaloric conditions to Group 1; Group 7: 28% CR 7 days/week. Sera from mice at sacrifice were analyzed for IGF-axis hormones.  Results:   There were no significant differences in survival among any groups. However, relative to Group 1, there were non-significant trends for improved survival for Groups 3 (HR 0.65, P = 0.26), 5 (0.60, P = 0.18), 6 (HR 0.59, P = 0.16), and 7 (P = 0.59, P = 0.17). Relative to Group 1, body weights and IGF-1 levels were significantly lower in Groups 6 and 7.  Conclusions:   This exploratory study found non-significant trends toward improved survival with some intermittent fasting regimens, in the absence of weight loss. Larger appropriately powered studies to detect modest, but clinically important differences are necessary to confirm these findings.""","""['W Cooper Buschemeyer rd', 'Joseph C Klink', 'John C Mavropoulos', 'Susan H Poulton', 'Wendy Demark-Wahnefried', 'Stephen D Hursting', 'Pinchas Cohen', 'David Hwang', 'Tracy L Johnson', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Effect of intermittent fasting on prostate cancer tumor growth in a mouse model.', 'NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride (CAS No. 298-59-9) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Feed Studies).', ""NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of 4,4'-Thiobis(6- t -butyl- m -cresol) (CAS No. 96-69-5) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Feed Studies)."", 'Fasting vs dietary restriction in cellular protection and cancer treatment: from model organisms to patients.', 'Clinical application of intermittent fasting for weight loss: progress and future directions.', 'The Health-Promoting Effects and the Mechanism of Intermittent Fasting.', 'Obesity, cancer risk,\xa0and time-restricted eating.', 'Effects of Intermittent Fasting in Human Compared to a Non-intervention Diet and Caloric Restriction: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'Effect of lactate administration on mouse skeletal muscle under calorie restriction.', 'The role and its mechanism of intermittent fasting in tumors: friend or foe?']"""

Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study of biomarkers of prostate cancer risk within the Multiethnic Cohort. We compared prediagnostic levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), 3alpha-androstanediol glucuronide (3alpha-diol G), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), and IGFBP-3 in serum from 467 incident prostate cancer cases and 934 cancer-free controls. Controls were matched to the cases on geographic site (HI, LA), ethnicity, age at specimen collection (+/-1 year), date (+/-1 month) and time of day (+/-2 hr) of sample collection, and fasting status (<6, 6-7, 8-9, >10 hr). Multivariate conditional logistic regression models were used to compute adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   Serum concentrations of testosterone, DHT, SHBG, 3alpha-diol G, IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 were not associated with risk of prostate cancer. Tests for trend of quartiles of serum concentrations also did not show any association. Results were relatively unchanged for men with advanced prostate cancer and their matched controls. However, the follow-up period was relatively short (mean of 1.9 years). Analysis by ethnic group showed an increased risk for Latino men in the second (OR = 3.67, 95% CI: 1.63-8.24) and third (OR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.19-7.40) tertiles of IGF-I serum levels compared with the first tertile.

The present study aims to investigate the localization and expression of Seladin-1 protein in normal and tumoral human prostatic tissues as well as to explore its role in proliferation and steroid secretion in androgen-dependent (LnCaP) and androgen-independent (DU145) cell lines and in human prostate primary cell culture.  Methods:   Seladin-1 protein localization and expression were assessed on whole tissue sections by tissue array/immunohistochemistry and following immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Proliferation (Ki67 fluorescence labeling and cell counts) and steroid secretion (ELISA) were assessed in cell lines and primary epithelial cell cultures.  Results:   In human prostatic tissue and cells, Seladin-1 was mostly localized within epithelial and rarely within stromal cells and primarily present in secretory luminal cells of normal and tumoral prostate cells. Its expression was increased in low-risk prostate cancer but reduced in advanced prostate cancers when compared to normal tissues. Seladin-1 was highly expressed in LnCaP, whereas its expression level was lower in DU145 cells. Seladin-1 inhibition by treatment with its specific inhibitor, U18666A (75 nM), increased proliferation in LnCaP and primary cell culture, as well as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in both LnCaP and DU145 cell lines.  Conclusions:   Seladin-1 involvement in proliferation and secretion suggests that its downregulation may be a major mechanism causing prostate cancer evolution.

However, 30-40% of men on active surveillance will progress to high-grade disease over 5 y. With the ultimate aim of developing a food-based chemoprevention strategy to retard cancer progression in these otherwise healthy men, we have developed a blend of food extracts commonly consumed in Mediterranean countries and East Asia. The effect of the food extracts known as Blueberry Punch (BBP) on prostate cancer cell growth and key signaling pathways were examined in vitro and in vivo. BBP reduced prostate cancer cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (0.08-2.5%) at 72 h in vitro due to the reduction in cell proliferation and viability. Prostate cancer cell xenograft-bearing mice, administered 10% BBP in drinking water for 2 wk, had a 25% reduction in tumor volume compared with the control (water only). In vitro, BBP reduced protein concentrations in 3 signaling pathways necessary for the proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells, namely androgen receptor, phospho-protein kinase B/protein kinase B, and phospho-cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha. The downstream effectors of these pathways, including prostate-specific antigen and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, were also reduced. Thus, this palatable food supplement is a potential candidate for testing in clinical trials and may ultimately prove effective in retarding the progression of low-grade, early-stage prostate cancer in men managed by active surveillance.""","""['Jaskirat Singh', 'Chanlu Xie', 'Mu Yao', 'Sheng Hua', 'Soma Vignarajan', 'Greg Jardine', 'Brett D Hambly', 'Paul Sved', 'Qihan Dong']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Nutr""","""['How can food extracts consumed in the Mediterranean and East Asia suppress prostate cancer proliferation?', 'Cytosolic phospholipase A2α sustains pAKT, pERK and AR levels in PTEN-null/mutated prostate cancer cells.', 'Zyflamend reduces the expression of androgen receptor in a model of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cross-talk between the androgen receptor and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in prostate cancer.', 'An overview of prostate diseases and their characteristics specific to Asian men.', 'Whole blueberry powder modulates the growth and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast tumors in nude mice.']"""

Several investigations have correlated clinical and histopathologic findings with surgical margin status after open RP. However, few studies have addressed the predictive factors for PSM after robot-assisted laparoscopic RP (RARP).  Objective:   We sought to identify predictive factors for PSMs and their locations after RARP.  Design, setting, and participants:   We prospectively analyzed 876 consecutive patients who underwent RARP from January 2008 to May 2009.  Intervention:   All patients underwent RARP performed by a single surgeon with previous experience of >1500 cases.  Measurements:   Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify potential predictive factors for PSM. Three logistic regression models were built: (1) one using preoperative variables only, (2) another using all variables (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative) combined, and (3) one created to identify potential predictive factors for PSM location. Preoperative variables entered into the models included age, body mass index (BMI), prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, number of positive cores, percentage of positive cores, and American Urological Association symptom score. Intra- and postoperative variables analyzed were type of nerve sparing, presence of median lobe, percentage of tumor in the surgical specimen, gland size, histopathologic findings, pathologic stage, and pathologic Gleason grade.  Results and limitations:   In the multivariable analysis including preoperative variables, clinical stage was the only independent predictive factor for PSM, with a higher PSM rate for T3 versus T1c (odds ratio [OR]: 10.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-43.8) and for T2 versus T1c (OR: 2.9; 95% CI, 1.9-4.6). Considering pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables combined, percentage of tumor, pathologic stage, and pathologic Gleason score were associated with increased risk of PSM in the univariable analysis (p<0.001 for all variables). However, in the multivariable analysis, pathologic stage (pT2 vs pT1; OR: 2.9; 95% CI, 1.9-4.6) and percentage of tumor in the surgical specimen (OR: 8.7; 95% CI, 2.2-34.5; p=0.0022) were the only independent predictive factors for PSM. Finally, BMI was shown to be an independent predictive factor (OR: 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3; p=0.0119) for apical PSMs, with increasing BMI predicting higher incidence of apex location. Because most of our patients were referred from other centers, the biopsy technique and the number of cores were not standardized in our series.  Conclusions:   Clinical stage was the only preoperative variable independently associated with PSM after RARP. Pathologic stage and percentage of tumor in the surgical specimen were identified as independent predictive factors for PSMs when analyzing pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables combined.

Similar analyses were performed to estimate the adjusted odds of being staged with distant metastatic vs in situ or local/regional disease.  Results:   The proportion of patients without staging ranged between 3% and 16% by age and between 6% and 8% by race.

Methods:   The subjects consisted of 201 native Japanese patients with prostate cancer. They comprised 113 ADT-treated and 88 hormone-naive patients. Lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMDs were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and expressed in standard deviation units relative to the scores of young adult men (T-score) or age-matched men (Z-score).

The negative regulatory domain inhibits AES dimerization and AES-mediated inhibition of AR-driven transcription through an interaction with the inhibitory domain. The positive regulatory domain blocked this interaction and relieved the inhibitory effect.

The seminal question is whether or not the gains are worth the adverse effects of LTAD with respect to patient preferences.  Methods:   Preferences for LTAD compared with STAD were elicited by direct patient interview using the probability trade-off method.

We isolated RNAs that are differentially expressed in macrodissected prostate cancer samples. This study focused on 1 identified gene, TTLL12, which was predicted to modify tubulins, an established target for tumor therapy. TTLL12 is the most poorly characterized member of a recently discovered 14-member family of proteins that catalyze posttranslational modification of tubulins. We show that human TTLL12 is expressed in the proliferating layer of benign prostate. Expression increases during cancer progression to metastasis. It is highly expressed in many metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. It partially colocalizes with vimentin intermediate filaments and cellular structures containing tubulin, including midbodies, centrosomes, intercellular bridges and the mitotic spindle. Downregulation of TTLL12 affects several posttranslational modifications of tubulin (detyrosination and subsequent deglutamylation and polyglutamylation). Overexpression alters chromosomal ploidy. These results raise the possibility that TTLL12 could contribute to tumorigenesis through effects on the cytoskeleton, tubulin modification and chromosome number stability.

The purpose of our study is to evaluate (i) if cleavage of galectin-3 could be related to angiogenesis during the progression of human breast cancer, (ii) the role of cleaved galectin-3 in induction of angiogenesis and (iii) determination of the galectin-3 domain responsible for induction of angiogenic response. Galectin-3 null breast cancer cells BT-459 were transfected with either cleavable full-length galectin-3 or its fragmented peptides. Chemotaxis, chemoinvasion, heterotypic aggregation, epithelial-endothelial cell interactions and angiogenesis were compared to noncleavable galectin-3. BT-549-H(64) cells harboring cleavable galectin-3 exhibited increased chemotaxis, invasion and interactions with endothelial cells resulting in angiogenesis and 3D morphogenesis compared to BT-549-P(64) cells harboring noncleavable galectin-3. BT-549-H(64) cells induced increased migration and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase in migrating endothelial cells. Endothelial cells cocultured with BT-549 cells transfected with galectin-3 peptides indicate that amino acids 1-62 and 33-250 stimulate migration and morphogenesis of endothelial cells.

The inclusion of geographic information in such research often begins by adding data to a map which is predicated by some knowledge of location. A precise level of spatial information is conventionally achieved through geocoding, the geographic information system (GIS) process of translating mailing address information to coordinates on a map. The geocoding process is not without its limitations, though, since there is always a percentage of addresses which cannot be converted successfully (nongeocodable). This raises concerns regarding bias since traditionally the practice has been to exclude nongeocoded data records from analysis.  Methodology/principal findings:   In this manuscript we develop and evaluate a set of imputation strategies for dealing with missing spatial information from nongeocoded addresses. The strategies are developed assuming a known zip code with increasing use of collateral information, namely the spatial distribution of the population at risk. Strategies are evaluated using prostate cancer data obtained from the Maryland Cancer Registry. We consider total case enumerations at the Census county, tract, and block group level as the outcome of interest when applying and evaluating the methods. Multiple imputation is used to provide estimated total case counts based on complete data (geocodes plus imputed nongeocodes) with a measure of uncertainty. Results indicate that the imputation strategy based on using available population-based age, gender, and race information performed the best overall at the county, tract, and block group levels.  Conclusions/significance:   The procedure allows for the potentially biased and likely under reported outcome, case enumerations based on only the geocoded records, to be presented with a statistically adjusted count (imputed count) with a measure of uncertainty that are based on all the case data, the geocodes and imputed nongeocodes.

For example, EAF2/U19 may serve as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. At the same time, EAF2/U19 is a downstream factor in the non-canonical Wnt 4 signaling pathway required for eye development in Xenopus laevis, and along with EAF1, contributes to convergence and extension movements in zebrafish embryos through Wnt maintenance. Here, we used zebrafish embryos and mammalian cells to show that both EAF1 and EAF2/U19 were up-regulated by Wnt4 (Wnt4a). Furthermore, we found that EAF1 and EAF2/U19 suppressed Wnt4 expression by directly binding to the Wnt4 promoter as seen in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These findings indicate that an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop occurs between Wnt4 and the EAF family, which is conserved between zebrafish and mammalian. The rescue experiments in zebrafish embryos showed that early embryonic development required the maintenance of the appropriate levels of Wnt4a through the feedback loop. Others have demonstrated that the tumor suppressors p63, p73 and WT1 positively regulate Wnt4 expression while p21 has the opposite effect, suggesting that maintenance of appropriate Wnt4 expression may also be critical for adult tissue homeostasis and prevention against tumor initiation. Thus, the auto-regulatory negative feedback loop that controls expression of Wnt4 and EAF proteins may play an important role in both embryonic development and tumor suppression. Our findings provide the first convincing line of evidence that EAF and Wnt4 form an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop in vivo.""","""['Xiaoyang Wan', 'Wei Ji', 'Xue Mei', 'Jiangang Zhou', 'Jing-xia Liu', 'Chengchi Fang', 'Wuhan Xiao']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Eaf1 and Eaf2 mediate zebrafish dorsal-ventral axis patterning via suppressing Wnt/β-Catenin activity.', 'Zebrafish eaf1 and eaf2/u19 mediate effective convergence and extension movements through the maintenance of wnt11 and wnt5 expression.', 'Eaf1 and Eaf2 negatively regulate canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Genetic control of hematopoietic development in Xenopus and zebrafish.', 'Roles and action mechanisms of WNT4 in cell differentiation and human diseases: a review.', 'Identification of common genetic characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis and major depressive disorder by bioinformatics analysis and machine learning.', 'Immunohistochemical Expression of Wnt-4 Protein in Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma.', 'Construction and Validation of a Robust Cancer Stem Cell-Associated Gene Set-Based Signature to Predict Early Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer.', 'Genomic signature of parity in the breast of premenopausal women.', 'Eaf1 and Eaf2 mediate zebrafish dorsal-ventral axis patterning via suppressing Wnt/β-Catenin activity.']"""

Daily prostate localization using B-mode ultrasound has been performed at the Nebraska Medical Center since 2000. More recently, a technology using electromagnetic transponders implanted within the prostate was introduced into our clinic (Calypso(R)). With each technology, patients were localized initially using skin marks. Localization error distributions were determined from offsets between the initial setup positions and those determined by ultrasound or Calypso. Ultrasound localization data was summarized from 16619 imaging sessions spanning 7 years; Calypso localization data consists of 1524 fractions in 41 prostate patients treated in the course of a clinical trial at five institutions and 640 localizations from the first 16 patients treated with our clinical system. Ultrasound and Calypso patients treated between March and September 2007 at the Nebraska Medical Center were analyzed and compared, allowing a single institutional comparison of the two technologies. In this group of patients, the isocenter determined by ultrasound-based localization is on average 5.3 mm posterior to that determined by Calypso, while the systematic and random errors and PTV margins calculated from the ultrasound localizations were 3 - 4 times smaller than those calculated from the Calypso localizations.

Given that inflammation may contribute to prostate cancer progression and that statins may reduce the risk for advanced prostate cancer, we investigated whether statin use was associated with reduced intratumoral inflammation in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens.  Methods:   Inflammation within index tumors of 236 men undergoing RP from 1996 to 2004 was graded by a single pathologist as grade 0 (absent), 1 (mild: < or =10%), and 2 (marked: >10%). Preoperative statin use was analyzed by grouping subjects as statin users or nonusers. Type and dosage of statin was accounted for using dose equivalents with 20 mg simvastatin as reference. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between statin use and intratumoral inflammation controlling for age, race, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen, year of surgery, clinical stage, pathologic Gleason sum, surgical margin status, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, prostate weight, time from prostate biopsy to RP, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.  Results:   Preoperative statin use was significantly associated with lower risk for any (grade > or =1) intratumoral inflammation (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.98; P = 0.047) on multivariable analysis, with doses > or =20 mg simvastatin equivalents being more strongly associated (relative to nonuse; odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.79; P = 0.02).  Conclusion:   In a cohort of men undergoing RP, statin use was associated with significantly lower risk of any inflammation within prostate tumors.

Because diverse genomic fusion events lead to ERG overexpression in prostate cancer, we reasoned that it may be more practical to capture such alterations using an assay targeting ERG sequences retained in such gene fusions. This study evaluates the potential of an assay quantitating ERG mRNA in post-digital rectal exam (DRE) urine for improving prostate cancer detection.  Experimental design:   Patients scheduled to undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the prostate were prospectively enrolled.

Therapeutics targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are unable to effectively inhibit tumor growth in a majority of cases. These tumors are assumed to possess primary resistance to anti-EGFR therapies, but the consequence of inhibiting EGFR in these tumors is unclear. We established isogenic cell lines by prolonged gefitinib treatment at concentrations that are in excess of that which is required for complete EGFR kinase inhibition but only minimally affected growth. Subsequently, we monitored the ligand-dependent HER profiles based on receptor expression, phosphorylation, and dimerization in conjunction with measurements of cellular susceptibility to gefitinib. Chronic EGFR kinase inhibition rapidly switched the HER network from dependence on EGFR to HER2. However, both receptors activated the critical signaling proteins AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase, and in both cases, HER3 was the common association partner. Remarkably, the switch in receptor dimers caused diminished susceptibility to EGFR-targeted inhibitors gefitinib and cetuximab but acquired susceptibility to the HER2-targeted inhibitor pertuzumab. Overall, our study indicates that the EGFR pathway is responsive to EGFR inhibiting therapies that are not dependent on EGFR for their growth and survival, thus challenging the current definition of primary therapeutic resistance.

Furthermore, Celastrol abrogated VEGF-induced sprouting of the vessels from aortic rings and inhibited vascular formation in the Matrigel plug assay in vivo. To understand the molecular mechanism of these activities, we next examined the signaling pathways in treated HUVECs and PC-3 tumor cells. Celastrol suppressed the VEGF-induced activation of AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (P70S6K). Additionally, we found that Celastrol inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and induced apoptosis, and these effects correlated with the extent of inhibition of AKT/mTOR/P70S6K signaling.

EBP1 protein expression is also decreased in clinical prostate cancer. We previously demonstrated that EBP1 overexpression results in decreased AR protein levels by affecting AR promoter activity. However, EBP1 has recently been demonstrated to be an RNA binding protein. We therefore examined the ability of EBP1 to regulate AR post-transcriptionally. Here we show that EBP1 promoted AR mRNA decay through physical interaction with a conserved UC-rich motif within the 3'-UTR of AR. The ability of EBP1 to accelerate AR mRNA decay was further enhanced by HRG treatment. EBP1 also bound to a CAG-formed stem-loop in the 5' coding region of AR mRNA and was able to inhibit AR translation.

In this study, we attempted to determine how GSK-3beta promotes cell survival after serum depletion. Under full culture conditions (10% FBS), GSK-3beta inhibition with chemical inhibitors or siRNAs failed to induce cell death in human prostate cancer cells. By contrast, under conditions of serum starvation, a profound necrotic cell death was observed as evidenced by cellular morphologic features and biochemical markers. Further analysis revealed that GSK-3beta-inhibition-induced cell death was in parallel with an extensive autophagic response.

Patients and methods:   Patients with clinical stages T1c-T3b prostate cancer were treated with intensity-modulated EBRT (> or = 81 Gy) or RP. Both cohorts included patients treated with salvage radiotherapy or androgen-deprivation therapy for biochemical failure. Salvage therapy for patients with RP was delivered a median of 13 months after biochemical failure compared with 69 months for EBRT patients. DM was compared controlling for patient age, clinical stage, serum prostate-specific antigen level, biopsy Gleason score, and year of treatment.  Results:   The 8-year probability of freedom from metastatic progression was 97% for RP patients and 93% for EBRT patients. After adjustment for case mix, surgery was associated with a reduced risk of metastasis (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.65; P < .001). Results were similar for prostate cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.80; P = .015). Rates of metastatic progression were similar for favorable-risk disease (1.9% difference in 8-year metastasis-free survival), somewhat reduced for intermediate-risk disease (3.3%), and more substantially reduced in unfavorable-risk disease (7.8% in 8-year metastatic progression).  Conclusion:   Metastatic progression is infrequent in men with low-risk prostate cancer treated with either RP or EBRT. RP patients with higher-risk disease treated had a lower risk of metastatic progression and prostate cancer-specific death than EBRT patients.

Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a potent and selective inhibitor of CYP17, which is required for androgen biosynthesis in the testes, adrenal glands, and prostate tissue. This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of AA in combination with prednisone to reduce the symptoms of secondary hyperaldosteronism that can occur with AA monotherapy.  Patients and methods:   Fifty-eight men with progressive metastatic CRPC who experienced treatment failure with docetaxel-based chemotherapy received AA (1,000 mg daily) with prednisone (5 mg twice daily). Twenty-seven (47%) patients had received prior ketoconazole. The primary outcome was > or = 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline, with objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, and changes in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) and circulating tumor cell (CTC) numbers.

However, the effect of these agents on evidence-based radiotherapy practice is poorly understood. The present study aimed to determine whether dietary supplements radiosensitized normal prostate or prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods and materials:   Three well-known prostate-specific dietary supplements were purchased from commercial sources available to patients (Trinovin, Provelex, and Prostate Rx). The cells used in the study included normal prostate lines (RWPE-1 and PWR-1E), prostate tumor lines (PC3, DU145, and LNCaP), and a normal nonprostate line (HaCaT). Supplement toxicity was assessed using cell proliferation assays [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] and cellular radiosensitivity using conventional clonogenic assays (0.5-4Gy). Cell cycle kinetics were assessed using the bromodeoxyuridine/propidium iodide pulse-labeling technique, apoptosis by scoring caspase-3 activation, and DNA repair by assessing gammaH2AX.  Results:   The cell growth and radiosensitivity of the malignant PC3, DU145, and LNcaP cells were not affected by any of the dietary prostate supplements (Provelex [2 microg/mL], Trinovin [10 microg/mL], and Prostate Rx [50 microg/mL]). However, both Trinovin (10 microg/mL) and Prostate Rx (6 microg/mL) inhibited the growth rate of the normal prostate cell lines. Prostate Rx increased cellular radiosensitivity of RWPE-1 cells through the inhibition of DNA repair.  Conclusion:   The use of prostate-specific dietary supplements should be discouraged during radiotherapy owing to the preferential radiosensitization of normal prostate cells.""","""['Yasmin Hasan', 'Diane Schoenherr', 'Alvaro A Martinez', 'George D Wilson', 'Brian Marples']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 activity by celecoxib does not lead to radiosensitization of human prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Cell death in irradiated prostate epithelial cells: role of apoptotic and clonogenic cell kill.', 'Effects of the dual 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor dutasteride on apoptosis in primary cultures of prostate cancer epithelial cells and cell lines.', 'Synergistic Effects of Dietary Natural Products as Anti-Prostate Cancer Agents.', 'Molecular markers that can be utilized in diet and dietary supplement research.']"""

In 2008, variants rs10505477 and rs6983267 in this region were associated with increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer (p < 0.01); however, three subsequent ovarian cancer reports of 8q24 variants were null. Here, we used a multi-site case-control study of 940 ovarian cancer cases and 1,041 controls to evaluate associations between these and other single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this 8q24 region, as well as in the 9p24 colorectal cancer associated-region (specifically, 9p24.1.b). A total of 35 SNPs from previous reports and additional tagging SNPs were assessed using an Illumina GoldenGate array and analyzed using logistic regression models, adjusting for population structure and other potential confounders. We observed no association between genotypes and risk of ovarian cancer considering all cases, invasive cases, or invasive serous cases. For example, at 8q24 SNPs rs10505477 and rs6983267, analyses yielded per-allele invasive cancer odds ratios of 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-1.09, p trend 0.46) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.84-1.12, p trend 0.69), respectively. Analyses using an approach identical to that of the first positive 8q24 report also yielded no association with risk of ovarian cancer. In the 9p24 region, no SNPs were associated with risk of ovarian cancer overall or with invasive or invasive serous disease (all p values > 0.10).

Methods:   From April 1997 to December 2007, serum PSA of 1,234 male (median age: 59) was measured in the medical checkup and each parameter of screening was evaluated. In addition, for the cases with prostate cancer, results of treatment and clinical significance were assessed.  Results:   PSA was elevated in 82 cases (6.6%), aged 42-87 (median 64), in which PSA varied 3.1-66.5 ng/ml (median 5.4). Trans-rectal biopsy was performed in 35 cases and prostate cancer was detected in 15 (42.9% of biopsied cases and 1.2% of whole group), aged 58-81 (median 70), with PSA value 4.2-66.5 ng/ml (median 10.3). Clinical stage of these cases was cT1cN0M0 in 12 and cT2aN0M0 or more in 3, Gleason score was 3 + 3 in 4 and 3 + 4 or more in 11. Initial treatment was radical prostatectomy in 12, androgen-deprivation therapy in 2 and external beam irradiation in 1. During the follow-up for 8-107 months (median 60), 14 were alive with good control and 1 was alive with relapse. Only one case was ""clinically insignificant"" cancer (impalpable and localized and tumor volume less than 0.5 ml and Gleason score 3 + 3 or less).

Methods:   From the release of silodosin (July 2006) through October 2008, 256 patients received silodosin for BPH/LUTS in our hospital. Of these 256, we evaluated 195, as 61 were excluded due to conditions such as prostate cancer. We evaluated the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL) index, uroflowmetry and postvoid residual urine volume before and after medication. We calculated the continuance rate of the drug by the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   The patients' mean age was 68.1 years and the mean medicated period was 3.1 months. Overall severity at baseline estimated by the criteria for severity of BPH was mild in 0%, moderate in 69%, and severe in 31%. Silodosin significantly improved the IPSS, QOL index, maximum urinary flow rate and postvoid residual urine volume in 90 patients whose data were available for analysis of the efficacy. Improvements were observed both in voiding symptoms and in storage symptoms. However, 45.6% of the overall efficacy was insufficient. Adverse events were observed in 56 of the 195 cases (28.7%). The most common adverse event was abnormal ejaculation (10.8%). The patients who reported adverse events were significantly younger in age and had lower IPSS and QOL index values after treatment than those without adverse events (mean age: 65.4 vs. 69.2 years old; mean IPSS: 7.7 vs. 13.1, mean QOL index: 2.9 vs. 3.6). The continuance rate for the drug was 12.0% at 1 year on the Kaplan-Meier curve. The development of adverse events was involved in the low continuance rate of silodosin.

Between July 2007 and March 2009, we have performed laparoscopic total prostatectomy for 53 patients, focusing on techniques to reduce urinary incontinence. Here we report the details of six key points of operative skill for achieving better urinary continence. These include (1) minimal distal incision of the endopelvic fascia; (2) preservation of the bladder neck; (3) bilateral nerve-sparing surgery; (4) preservation of the puboprostatic ligament and its refixation to the anterior aspect of the bladder neck (bladder neck sling suspension); (5) preservation of the posterior (membranous) urethra; (6) suturing of the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter, the remaining portion of the Denonvilliers fascia, and the bladder neck (restoration of the Denonvilliers fascia). Moreover, we separated the 53 patients into two groups: those who were not treated using the above six key points, and those who were.

Does imaging help?""","""In compliance with guidelines in cases of suspected prostate cancer, the standard approach involves transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic biopsies. Currently, according to the new S3 guideline for prostate cancer, 10-12 tissue samples should be collected per patient and session. If these primary specimens are negative, the number of multiple biopsies is generally increased in the second session to improve the diagnostic certainty with more biopsies. At the latest when the second core needle biopsy is performed in the presence of rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, an attempt is made to minimize the risk of overlooking prostate cancer by further increasing the number of multiple biopsies in the sense of achieving saturation. In this instance, the number ranges from 6 to 143 tissue samples per session. Studies have provided evidence that after two systematic random biopsies the same number of additional random biopsies does not accomplish any essential improvement of diagnostic certainty. There are hardly any studies in the literature dealing with the role of imaging procedures after negative prostate biopsies. In a prospective clinical trial including 132 patients with an average of 12 negative previous biopsies, a dramatically high number of prostate carcinomas (66 of 132) could be detected with innovative imaging (1-6 targeted biopsies). This raises the question of how reliably multiple systematic biopsies can in fact exclude the presence of cancer. Thus, particularly after a negative series of multiple biopsies, it appears to be expedient to use specific imaging to enhance diagnostic certainty through quality.

Serum levels of sFas were significantly higher while sFasL and cytochrome c levels were lower in men compared to women. With increasing age there was a decrease in apoptotic markers (cytochrome c) and pro-apoptotic factors (sFasL) and an increase in anti-apoptotic factors (sFas) in circulation.

Although it is well known that PTH acts primarily on kidney and bone, the precise cellular and subcellular sites of PTH action have not been visualised in human tissues.  Method:   We developed and characterised a novel anti-peptide antibody to the carboxy-terminal region of the human PTH receptor type 1 (PTHR1). Specificity of the antiserum was demonstrated by i) detection of a broad band migrating at M(r) 85,000-95,000 in western blots of membranes from human kidney and PTHR1-transfected cells; ii) cell surface staining of PTHR1-transfected cells; iii) translocation of PTHR1 receptor immunostaining after agonist exposure; and iv) abolition of tissue immunostaining by preadsorption of the antibody with its immunising peptide. The distribution of PTHR1 receptors was investigated in 320 human tumours and their tissues of origin.  Results:   In the kidney, PTHR1 receptors were predominantly detected at the basolateral plasma membrane of epithelial cells in the proximal and distal tubules but not in the thin limbs of Henle, collecting ducts or glomeruli. In bone, PTHR1 receptors were detected as discrete plasma membrane staining of osteocytes and osteoblasts, whereas osteoclasts remained unstained. In addition, PTHR1 was found in the gut and in a number of neoplastic tissues including colorectal carcinoma, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma and osteosarcoma.

Methods:   Changes in African American accrual at sites that received MREGs are compared with changes in a group of 15, frequency-matched, nonawarded sites using a quasi-experimental, post hoc analysis. Successful and unsuccessful recruitment strategies reported by the MREG sites are described.  Results:   The increased number of African American participants accrued per month at MREG sites post-funding was higher than the change at comparison sites by a factor of 3.38 (p = 0.004, 95% CI: 1.51-7.57). An estimated 602 additional African American participants were recruited at MREG sites due to MREG funding, contributing to the overall 14.9% African American recruitment. Successful recruitment strategies most reported by MREG sites included increasing staff, transportation resources, recruiting through the media, mailings, and prostate cancer screening clinics during off-hours.  Limitations:   Comparison sites were chosen retrospectively, not by randomization. Although comparison sites were selected to be similar to MREG sites with regard to potential confounding factors, it is possible that unknown factors could have biased results. Cost-effective analyses were not conducted.  Conclusions:   MREG sites increased African American accrual in the post-funding period more than comparison sites, indicating MREG funding enhanced the sites' abilities to accrue African American participants.

The study used four DAPs, namely H-4073 and H-4318 without NOH and HO-3867 and HO-4200 with NOH substitution. The goal of the study was to evaluate the proof-of-concept anticancer-versus-antioxidant efficacy of the DAPs using a number of cancerous (breast, colon, head and neck, liver, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancer) and noncancerous (smooth muscle, aortic endothelial, and ovarian surface epithelial) human cell lines. Cytotoxicity was determined using an MTT-based cell viability assay. All four compounds induced significant loss of cell viability in cancer cells, whereas HO-3867 and HO-4200 showed significantly less cytotoxicity in noncancerous cells. EPR measurements showed a metabolic conversion of the N-hydroxylamine function to nitroxide with significantly higher levels of the metabolite and superoxide radical-scavenging (antioxidant) activity in noncancerous cells compared to cancer cells. Western blot analysis showed that the DAP-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells were mediated by inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation at the Tyr705 and Ser727 residues and induction of apoptotic markers of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. The results suggest that the antioxidant-conjugated DAPs will be useful as safe and effective anticancer agents for cancer therapy.""","""['Karuppaiyah Selvendiran', 'Shabnam Ahmed', 'Alex Dayton', 'M Lakshmi Kuppusamy', 'Mia Tazi', 'Anna Bratasz', 'Liyue Tong', 'Brian K Rivera', 'Tamás Kálai', 'Kálmán Hideg', 'Periannan Kuppusamy']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Anticancer potential of diarylidenyl piperidone derivatives, HO-4200 and H-4318, in cisplatin resistant primary ovarian cancer.', 'HO-3867, a safe STAT3 inhibitor, is selectively cytotoxic to ovarian cancer.', 'Anticancer efficacy of a difluorodiarylidenyl piperidone (HO-3867) in human ovarian cancer cells and tumor xenografts.', ""Antiproliferative Effect of a Novel 4,4'-Disulfonyldiarylidenyl Piperidone in Human Colon Cancer Cells."", 'Safe and targeted anticancer therapy for ovarian cancer using a novel class of curcumin analogs.', 'HO-3867 Induces Apoptosis via the JNK Signaling Pathway in Human Osteosarcoma Cells.', 'HO-3867 Induces ROS-Dependent Stress Response and Apoptotic Cell Death in Leishmania donovani.', 'Redox Sensitive Cysteine Residues as Crucial Regulators of Wild-Type and Mutant p53 Isoforms.', 'Diarylpentanoid (1,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,4-pentadiene-3-one) (MS13) Exhibits Anti-proliferative, Apoptosis Induction and Anti-migration Properties on Androgen-independent Human Prostate Cancer by Targeting Cell Cycle-Apoptosis and PI3K Signalling Pathways.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Antiproliferative and Apoptosis Activity by 1,5-Bis(4-Hydroxy-3-Methoxyphenyl)1,4-Pentadiene-3-one (MS13) on Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.']"""

Since its introduction, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) of the prostate has become the most common method for assessment of prostate volumes. Ultrasonography, in general, has been associated with concerns of operator dependent variability. Herein, we analyze the accuracy of urologists and radiologists performing TRUS.  Material and methods:   The accuracy of preoperative TRUS prostate volume estimation was evaluated by comparing it to gross specimen prostate weight following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) performed from August 2004 to March 2008 in Mayo Clinic Arizona. A total of 800 RARPs were evaluated retrospectively with 302 patients having a prostate volume measurement with TRUS at our institution followed by RARP being performed within 30 days. The TRUS measurements were divided into two groups: those TRUS measurements performed by urologists (group 1), and those performed by radiologists (group 2). The accuracy of the two groups were compared using a Pearson correlation analysis.  Results:   The estimated weight by TRUS in the total cohort of patients correlated with the pathological specimen weight at 0.802 with a standard error of 0.90. Group 1 performed a total of 114 ultrasounds with a correlation of 0.835 and a standard error of 1.27. Group 2 performed a total of 188 with a correlation of 0.786 and a standard error of 0.88.  Conclusions:   Urologists and radiologists are both consistently within 17%-22% of the estimated prostate specimen weight. Urologists appeared to have a slightly higher accuracy in estimation but a higher range of error for the whole group when compared to radiologists. Transrectal ultrasonography is a reliable technique to estimate prostate weight and accuracy to within 20% of the pathological weight. Urologists and radiologists are essentially equally proficient in estimating prostate weight with TRUS. These findings are particularly important with respect to specialty certification and competency/proficiency evaluation, as health care increasingly moves towards outcomes based reimbursement.""","""['Rafael Nunez-Nateras', 'Jack R Andrews', 'George L Martin', 'Paul E Andrews', 'Mitchell R Humphreys', 'Robert G Ferrigni', 'William G Eversman', 'Erik P Castle']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Accuracy of transrectal ultrasonography to evaluate pathologic prostate weight: correlation with various prostate size groups.', 'Transrectal ultrasound versus magnetic resonance imaging in the estimation of prostate volume as compared with radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'The accuracy of transrectal ultrasound prostate volume estimation: clinical correlations.', 'Echography and follow-up of prostate carcinoma: ""follow up echography in the course of drug therapy"".', 'Prostate volume measurement by transrectal ultrasound and computed tomography before and after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Impact of Prostate Size on the Outcomes of Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Role of prostate volume in the early detection of prostate cancer in a cohort with slowly increasing prostate specific antigen.', 'Automated computer-derived prostate volumes from MR imaging data: comparison with radiologist-derived MR imaging and pathologic specimen volumes.', 'Comparative Analysis of Outcomes after Transurethral Resection of the Prostate according to Prostate Shape Shown by Transrectal Ultrasonography.']"""

National guidelines provide algorithms to choose between treatment or observation for LPC, but the algorithms require the factoring of the patient's baseline comorbidity adjusted life expectancy (CALE). However, no method is available to estimate CALE of 10 or more years.  Materials and methods:   A mailed survey was completed by newly diagnosed untreated LPC patients. Their baseline CALE was estimated by weighting their age based life expectancy by quartiles of comorbidity scores, and a national guideline was used to find if treatment or observation was recommended for each patient. Demographic, health and cancer characteristics, and beliefs were compared in patients who chose treatment or observation concordant with the guideline, and those who chose under treatment or over treatment.  Results:   Of 184 survey participants, 10 chose under treatment, 144 chose concordant treatment, and 30 chose over treatment. Under treatment patients had similar sociodemographic and health characteristics to patients who were concordant. In comparison to concordant patients, over treatment patients were older, had a lower Gleason grade or PSA level, a higher comorbidity score, a lower CALE, and lower scores on the Fear of Cancer Recurrence scale.  Conclusion:   Comorbidity scores can be used to estimate CALE in LPC patients, and estimation of CALE allows the use of guidelines in the choice of treatment. In our study, over treatment occurred more frequently than under treatment. Factors known to limit the survival benefit of treatment were associated with over treatment. Over treatment patients also had lower fear of cancer recurrence.""","""['Ravinder Mohan', 'Hind Beydoun', 'John Davis', 'Raymond Lance', 'Paul Schellhammer']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Temporarily deferred therapy (watchful waiting) for men younger than 70 years and with low-risk localized prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era.', ""Patients' survival expectations before localized prostate cancer treatment by treatment status."", 'The 20-Yr outcome in patients with well- or moderately differentiated clinically localized prostate cancer diagnosed in the pre-PSA era: the prognostic value of tumour ploidy and comorbidity.', 'An analysis of watchful waiting for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Competitive morbidity ant its impact on life expectancy: evaluation and inclusion in the therapeutic decision regarding localized prostatic cancer.', 'Biomarkers in prostate cancer epidemiology.', 'Fear of cancer recurrence in adult cancer survivors: a systematic review of quantitative studies.']"""

The analyses of orthotopic tumor weight, lung metastasis and luciferin-stained tumor images 14 days after each treatment showed significant tumor growth inhibition in the combination group in comparison with that in the OBP-301- or IL-2-treated groups. In addition, the percentage of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the combination group was significantly suppressed in comparison with that in the PBS and single-agent treatment groups.

Unfortunately, many cancers show or acquire resistance to TRAIL.

TRAIL alone triggered robust formation of the 'death-inducing signaling complex' (DISC), activation of the initiator caspase-8, and truncation of the BH3-only protein BID (tBID). Nevertheless, simultaneous disruption of the p38 MAPK pathway was required to suppress MCL-1 expression, thereby allowing tBID to activate the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BAK and stimulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Release of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) antagonist, Smac/DIABLO, from the intermembrane space was sufficient to promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis, whereas release of cytochrome c and activation of the apoptosome was dispensable. Even after MOMP, however, mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) activated a secondary signaling pathway, involving c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), that similarly upregulated MCL-1 expression and partially rescued some cells from death.

We recently showed that Stat3 promotes metastatic behavior of human prostate cancer cells not only in vitro but also in an in vivo experimental metastases model. In this work, we compare side-by-side Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in the promotion of prostate cancer cell viability, tumor growth, and induction of metastatic colonization in vivo. Inhibition of Stat5a/b induced massive death of prostate cancer cells in culture and reduced both subcutaneous and orthotopic prostate tumor growth, whereas Stat3 had a predominant role over Stat5a/b in promoting metastases formation of prostate cancer cells in vivo in nude mice. The molecular mechanisms underlying the differential biological effects induced by these two transcription factors involve largely different sets of genes regulated by Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in human prostate cancer model systems.

Here we report that the full length ARA70alpha, in contrast, represses prostate cancer cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in nude mice xenograft experiments in vivo. Further, the growth inhibition by ARA70alpha is AR-dependent and mediated through induction of apoptosis rather than cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, AR with T877A mutation in LNCaP cells decreased its physical and functional interaction with ARA70alpha, facilitating the growth of LNCaP cells. The tumor suppressor function of ARA70alpha is consistent with our previous findings that ARA70alpha expression is decreased in prostate cancer cells compared with benign prostate. ARA70alpha also reduced the invasion ability of LNCaP cells. Although growth inhibition by ARA70alpha is AR-dependent, the inhibition of cell invasion is an androgen-independent process.

To date, no effective therapeutic treatment allows abrogation of the progression of prostate cancer to more invasive forms. In this study, we identified Saussurea involucrata Kar. et Kir., a rare traditional Chinese medicinal herb, as a potential agent for androgen-independent prostate cancer patients and investigated its biological mechanism as an antineoplastic agent. S. involucrata caused a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in human hormone-resistant prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Moreover, in vitro studies in a panel of several types of human cancer cell lines revealed that S. involucrata inhibited cell proliferation with high potency. To evaluate the bioactive compounds, we successively extracted the S. involucrata with fractions of methanol (SI-1), ethyl acetate (SI-2), n-butanol (SI-3), and water (SI-4). Among these extracts, SI-2 contains the most effective bioactivity. SI-2 treatment resulted in significant time-dependent growth inhibition together with G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PC3 cells. In addition, SI-2 treatment strongly induced p21WAF1/CIP and p27KIP1 expression, independent of the p53 pathway, and downregulated expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). SI-2 treatment increased levels of Bax, cytochrome c, activated caspase-3, and active caspase-9 and decreased Bcl-2 expression level. One of the major targets for the therapy in prostate cancer can be epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). SI-2 markedly reduced phosphorylation of EGFR and inhibited activation of AKT and STAT3. Moreover, p.o. administration of SI-2 induced a dose-dependent inhibition of PC-3 tumor growth in vivo. In summary, our study identifies S. involucrata as an effective inhibitor of EGFR signaling in human hormone-resistant prostate cancer PC-3 cells.

Mice bearing human prostate LNCaP tumors, treated with a single intravenous injection of 5 x 10(7) plaque-forming units (pfu) of AU27 virus exhibited a >85% reduction in tumor size at day 28 after viral injection.

For men on placebo, higher versus lower serum C-peptide was associated with a nearly 2-fold increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason >7; multivariate-adjusted OR, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.97; P(trend) = 0.004). When C-peptide was modeled as a continuous variable, every unit increase in log(C-peptide) resulted in a 39% increased risk of high-grade disease (P = 0.01). In contrast, there was no significant relationship between C-peptide and high-grade prostate cancer among men receiving finasteride. Leptin was not independently associated with high-grade prostate cancer. In conclusion, these results support findings from other observational studies that high serum C-peptide and insulin resistance, but not leptin, are associated with increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Our novel finding is that the C-peptide-associated risk was attenuated by use of finasteride.""","""['Marian L Neuhouser', 'Cathee Till', 'Alan Kristal', 'Phyllis Goodman', 'Ashraful Hoque', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Ann W Hsing', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Howard L Parnes', 'Michael Pollak']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Obesity, endogenous hormone metabolism, and prostate cancer risk: a conundrum of ""highs"" and ""lows"".', 'Insulin-like growth factors and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins and prostate cancer risk: results from the prostate cancer prevention trial.', 'Detection bias due to the effect of finasteride on prostate volume: a modeling approach for analysis of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Association between variants in genes involved in the immune response and prostate cancer risk in men randomized to the finasteride arm in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Implications of the prostate cancer prevention trial: a decision analysis model of survival outcomes.', 'Prostate cancer prevention and finasteride.', 'Circulating adiponectin and leptin and risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Adverse Effects of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer and the Benefits and Potential Anti-oncogenic Mechanisms of Progressive Resistance Training.', 'Randomized trial evaluating the role of weight loss in overweight and obese men with early stage prostate Cancer on active surveillance: Rationale and design of the Prostate Cancer Active Lifestyle Study (PALS).', 'Expression of IGF/insulin receptor in prostate cancer tissue and progression to lethal disease.', 'Serum C-peptide concentration and prostate cancer: A meta-analysis of observational studies.']"""

In contrast to breast cancer, studies on Her2 overexpression and gene amplification in prostate cancer have yielded different results. The purpose of this study was to learn more on the prevalence and clinical significance of HER2 amplification and overexpression in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   A tissue microarray containing >2,000 prostate cancers with follow-up data was used. Tissue microarray sections were analyzed on protein and DNA level using two different antibodies (HercepTest, DAKO; Novocastra NCL-CB11) and fluorescence in situ hybridization.  Results:   Immunohistochemical analyses showed highly similar results for both antibodies. Detectable Her2 immunostaining was observed in 17.2% for the HercepTest and in 22.5% for the Novocastra antibody with the vast majority of cases showing 1+ or 2+ staining. For both antibodies (HercepTest/Novocastra), significant associations were found between positive staining and high Gleason grade (P < 0.0001, both), advanced pT stage (P < 0.0001/P = 0.0015), rapid tumor cell proliferation (P = 0.0004/P = 0.0071), and tumor recurrence (P < 0.0001, both). HER2 amplification was only found in 1 of 2,525 analyzable cases (0.04%).  Conclusions:   Low-level Her2 overexpression occurs at relevant frequency in prostate cancer and in the absence of gene amplification. Increased Her2 expression may potentially lead to an aggressive behavior of tumor cells through the stimulation of tumor cell proliferation because Her2 staining was shown to be significantly associated with Ki67 labeling index.

Several cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate, overexpress the cyclin D1 gene. However, the correlation of cyclin D1 overexpression with E2F target gene regulation or of cdk-dependent cyclin D1 activity with tumor development has not been identified. This suggests that the role of cyclin D1 in oncogenesis may be independent of its function as a cell cycle regulator. One such function is the role of cyclin D1 in cell adhesion and motility. Filamin A (FLNa), a member of the actin-binding filamin protein family, regulates signaling events involved in cell motility and invasion. FLNa has also been associated with a variety of cancers including lung cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, human bladder cancer, and neuroblastoma. We hypothesized that elevated cyclin D1 facilitates motility in the invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. We show that MDA-MB-231 motility is affected by disturbing cyclin D1 levels or cyclin D1-cdk4/6 kinase activity. Using mass spectrometry, we find that cyclin D1 and FLNa coimmunoprecipitate and that lower levels of cyclin D1 are associated with decreased phosphorylation of FLNa at Ser2152 and Ser1459.

Functional overexpression of miR-31, the most underexpressed miRNA in serous ovarian cancer, repressed predicted miR-31 gene targets including the cell cycle regulator E2F2. MIR31 and CDKN2A, which encode p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A), are located at 9p21.3, a genomic region commonly deleted in ovarian and other cancers. p14(ARF) promotes p53 activity, and E2F2 overexpression in p53 wild-type cells normally leads via p14(ARF) to an induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. In a number of serous cancer cell lines with a dysfunctional p53 pathway (i.e., OVCAR8, OVCA433, and SKOV3), miR-31 overexpression inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis; however, in other lines (i.e., HEY and OVSAYO) with functional p53, miR-31 had no effect. Additionally, the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and the prostate cancer cell line PC3 (p14(ARF)-deficient and p53-deficient, respectively) were also sensitive to miR-31. Furthermore, miR-31 overexpression induced a global gene expression pattern in OVCAR8 associated with better prognosis in tumors from patients with advanced stage serous ovarian cancer, potentially affecting many genes underlying disease progression.

The data from immuofluorescence analyses revealed that EGFR/Tyr(1173)-pEGFR, sonic hedgehog ligand, smoothened coreceptor, and GLI-1 were colocalized with the CD133(+) stem cell-like marker in a small subpopulation of prostate cancer cells. These signaling molecules were also present in the bulk tumor mass of CD133(-) prostate cancer cells with a luminal phenotype detected in patient's adenocarcinoma tissues. Importantly, the results revealed that the CD133(+)/CD44(high)/AR(-/low) side population (SP) cell fraction endowed with a high self-renewal potential isolated from tumorigenic and invasive WPE1-NB26 cells by the Hoechst dye technique was insensitive to the current chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel. In contrast, the docetaxel treatment induced significant antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on the CD133(-)/CD44(low)/AR(+) non-SP cell fraction isolated from the WPE1-NB26 cell line. Of therapeutic interest, the results have also indicated that combined docetaxel, gefitinib, and cyclopamine induced greater antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on SP and non-SP cell fractions isolated from WPE1-NB26 cells than individual drugs or two-drug combinations.

We have previously reported that pharmacological inhibition of SK activity delays tumor growth in vivo. The present studies demonstrate that the SK2-selective inhibitor 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-adamantane-1-carboxylic acid (pyridin-4-ylmethyl)amide (ABC294640) induces nonapoptotic cell death that is preceded by microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 cleavage, morphological changes in lysosomes, formation of autophagosomes, and increases in acidic vesicles in A-498 kidney carcinoma cells. ABC294640 caused similar autophagic responses in PC-3 prostate and MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells. Simultaneous exposure of A-498 cells to ABC294640 and 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, switched the mechanism of toxicity to apoptosis, but decreased the potency of the SK2 inhibitor, indicating that autophagy is a major mechanism for tumor cell killing by this compound. Induction of the unfolded protein response by the proteasome inhibitor N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)leucinylleucinylleucinal Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al (MG-132) or the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor geldanamycin synergistically increased the cytotoxicity of ABC294640 in vitro. In severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing A-498 xenografts, daily administration of ABC294640 delayed tumor growth and elevated autophagy markers, but did not increase terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells in the tumors.

Among the identified proteins, BiP/GRP78, a molecular chaperone, was highly expressed in the membrane/organelle fraction of HUVECs after VEGF treatment. The involvement of BiP in VEGF-induced angiogenesis was examined by RNA interference. BiP knockdown significantly suppressed VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and VEGF-induced phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2, phospholipase C-γ, and VEGF receptor-2 in HUVECs. Cell surface biotinylation analysis revealed that the cell surface expression of BiP was elevated in VEGF-activated HUVECs. Aiming to apply BiP to a target molecule in liposomal DDS, we developed liposomes modified with the WIFPWIQL peptide, which has been shown to bind to BiP, and investigated its potential for cancer therapy.

Although transglutaminase 4 has been shown to have prostate-restricted expression pattern, little is known about the biological function of transglutaminase 4 in human. To gain insight into its role in prostate, we analyzed the expression status of human transglutaminase 4 in benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa). Unexpectedly, RT-PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis showed four alternative splicing variants of transglutaminase 4: transglutaminase 4-L, -M (-M1 and -M2) and -S. The difference between transglutaminase 4-M1 and -M2 is attributed to splicing sites, but not nucleotide size. The deduced amino acid sequences showed that transglutaminase 4-L, -M1 and -M2 have correct open reading frames, whereas transglutaminase 4-S has a truncated reading frame. RT-PCR analysis of clinical samples revealed that transglutaminase 4-M and -S were detected in all tested prostate tissue (80 BPH and 48 PCa). Interestingly, transglutaminase 4-L was found in 56% of BPH (45 out of 80) and only in 15% of PCa (7 out of 48). However, transglutaminase 4-L expression did not correlate with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, prostate volumes or PSA densities.

Patients and methods:   Data for 1,871 men with initial negative biopsies and at least one follow-up biopsy were available. Piecewise exponential regression models were developed to quantify hazard ratios (HRs) and define cumulative incidence curves for PCa detection for subgroups with specific patterns of risk factors over time. Factors evaluated included age, race, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, PSA slope, digital rectal examination, dysplastic glands or prostatitis on biopsy, ultrasound gland volume, urinary symptoms, and number of negative biopsies.  Results:   Four hundred sixty-five men had PCa detected, after a mean follow-up time of 2.8 years. All of the factors were independent predictors of PCa detection except for PSA slope, as a result of its correlation with time-dependent PSA level, and race. PSA (HR = 3.90 for > 10 v 2.5 to 3.9 ng/mL), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia/atypical glands (HR = 2.97), gland volume (HR = 0.39 for > 50 v < 25 mL), and number of repeat biopsies (HR = 0.36 for two v zero repeat biopsies) were the strongest predictors. Men with high-risk versus low-risk event histories had a 20-fold difference in PCa detection over 5 years.  Conclusion:   Piecewise exponential models provide an approach to longitudinal analysis of PCa risk that allows clinicians to see the interplay of risk factors as they unfold over time for individual patients.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), often used as an over-the-counter nutritional supplement, is metabolized to androgens and estrogens in humans. The efficacy and safety of unregulated use of DHEA are unclear. We now report that DHEA induces beta-CTS via increasing association of estrogen receptor (ER)-beta with Dishevelled2 (Dvl2) in AR nonresponsive human PrCa DU145 cells, a line of androgen-independent PrCa (AiPC) cells. The induction is temporal, as assessed by measuring kinetics of the association of ERbeta/Dvl2, protein expression of the beta-CTS targeted genes, c-Myc and cyclin D1, and cell growth. However, in PC-3 cells, another human AiPC cell line, DHEA exerts no detectible effects, partly due to their lower expression of Galpha-subunits and DHEA down-regulation of ERbeta/Dvl2 association. When Galphaq is overexpressed in PC-3 cells, beta-CTS is constitutively induced, including increasing c-Myc and cyclin D1 protein expression. This effect involved increasing associations of Galphaq/Dvl2 and ERbeta/Dvl2 and promoted cell growth. These activities require ERbeta in DU-145 and PC-3 cells because they are blocked by ICI 182-780 treatment inactivating ERbeta, small interfering RNA administration depleting ERbeta, or AR overexpression arresting ERbeta. These data suggest that novel pathways activating beta-CTS play roles in the progression of AiPC.

The validity of the model was supported by patient data obtained from a clinical trial of IAS. It accurately reproduced the kinetics of the therapeutic reduction of PSA and predicted the future nadir level correctly.

Such a model can be used to estimate an individual's eventual outcome and thus to inform decisions about therapy. To describe the observed clinical progression, the model must postulate three PC cell populations that are (1) local to the prostate and sensitive to hormones, (2) regional and hormone sensitive, and (3) systemic and hormone resistant. A set of coupled first-order differential equations describes the exponential growth of a PC tumor as well as its transformation from a local to systemic disease. The time dependence of the solutions is scaled to the doubling time of the prostate specific antigen (PSADT) because it characterizes the tumor growth for the individual. The conversion from local to systemic cell populations is described with a parameter alpha that can be associated with the Gleason score. The model also has three critical cell populations that describe (1) the initiation of the non-local populations, (2) the saturation level of the local tumor, and (3) the cell count likely to cause PC specific death. These parameters are calibrated by reproducing published PC clinical data and survival tables. The model is then applied to individuals with complete PC diagnostic data in order to calculate the progression to PC specific death. One man has early stage PC as described in the 'vignette' patient of Walsh et al. (2007. N. Engl. J. Med. 357, 2696-2705).

Traditionally, the RKI periodically estimates the number of new cancer cases in Germany on the basis of the available data from the regional cancer registries in which registration is complete; this figure, in turn, forms the basis for further important indicators.  Methods:   This article gives a brief overview of current indicators - such as incidence, prevalence, mortality, survival rates - on the most common types of cancer, as well as important ratios on the risks of developing and dying of cancer in Germany.  Results:   According to the latest estimate, there were a total of 436,500 new cancer cases in Germany in 2004. The most common cancer in men is prostate cancer with over 58,000 new cases per annum, followed by colorectal and lung cancer. In women, breast cancer remains the most common cancer with an estimated 57,000 new cases every year, also followed by colorectal cancer. These and further findings on selected cancer sites can be found in the current brochure on ""Cancer in Germany"", which is regularly published by the RKI together with the Association of Population-based Cancer Registries in Germany (GEKID). In addition, the RKI made cancer-prevalence estimates and calculated current morbidity and mortality risks at the federal level for the first time. According to these figures, the 5-year partial prevalence - i.e. the total number of cancer patients diagnosed over the past five years who are currently still living - exceeds 600,000 in men; the figure is about the same among women. Here, too, the most common cancers are prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women. The lifetime risk of developing cancer, which is more related to the individual, is estimated to be higher among men (48.5%) than among women (40.3%). In roughly rounded figures, therefore, about every second person in Germany develops cancer in the course of their lives. One in four men and one in five women die of cancer.  Conclusions:   In recent years, population-based cancer registration in Germany has come significantly closer to the aim of the complete, nationwide coverage of cancer.

The authors implement a Monte Carlo model of this dose deposited outside passively scattered fields and compare it to measurements, determine the out-of-field equivalent dose, and estimate the change in the dose if the same target volumes were treated with an active beam scanning technique.  Methods:   Measurements are done with a thimble ionization chamber and the Wellhofer MatriXX detector inside a Lucite phantom with field configurations based on the treatment of prostate cancer and medulloblastoma. The authors use a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation, demonstrated to agree well with measurements inside the primary field, to simulate fields delivered in the measurements. The partial contributions to the dose are separated in the simulation by particle type and origin.  Results:   The agreement between experiment and simulation in the out-of-field absorbed dose is within 30% at 10-20 cm from the field edge and 90% of the data agrees within 2 standard deviations. In passive scattering, the neutron contribution to the total dose dominates in the region downstream of the Bragg peak (65%-80% due to internally produced neutrons) and inside the phantom at distances more than 10-15 cm from the field edge. The equivalent doses using 10 for the neutron weighting factor at the entrance to the phantom and at 20 cm from the field edge are 2.2 and 2.6 mSv/Gy for the prostate cancer and cranial medulloblastoma fields, respectively. The equivalent dose at 15-20 cm from the field edge decreases with depth in passive scattering and increases with depth in active scanning. Therefore, active scanning has smaller out-of-field equivalent dose by factors of 30-45 in the entrance region and this factor decreases with depth.  Conclusions:   The dose deposited immediately downstream of the primary field, in these cases, is dominated by internally produced neutrons; therefore, scattered and scanned fields may have similar risk of second cancer in this region. The authors confirm that there is a reduction in the out-of-field dose in active scanning but the effect decreases with depth. GEANT4 is suitable for simulating the dose deposited outside the primary field.

The authors propose a new fully automatic 3D registration framework that integrates object-based global and seed constraints with the grayscale-based ""demons"" algorithm.  Methods:   Clinical objects were segmented on the planning CT images and were utilized as meshless deformable models during the nonrigid registration process. The meshless models reinforced a global constraint in addition to the grayscale difference between CT and CBCT in order to maintain the shape and the volume of geometrically complex 3D objects during the registration. To expedite the registration process, the framework was stratified into hierarchies, and the authors used a frequency domain formulation to diffuse the displacement between the reference and the target in each hierarchy. Also during the registration of pelvis images, they replaced the air region inside the rectum with estimated pixel values from the surrounding rectal wall and introduced an additional seed constraint to robustly track and match the seeds implanted into the prostate. The proposed registration framework and algorithm were evaluated on 15 real prostate cancer patients. For each patient, prostate gland, seminal vesicle, bladder, and rectum were first segmented by a radiation oncologist on planning CT images for radiotherapy planning purpose. The same radiation oncologist also manually delineated the tumor volumes and critical anatomical structures in the corresponding CBCT images acquired at treatment. These delineated structures on the CBCT were only used as the ground truth for the quantitative validation, while structures on the planning CT were used both as the input to the registration method and the ground truth in validation. By registering the planning CT to the CBCT, a displacement map was generated. Segmented volumes in the CT images deformed using the displacement field were compared against the manual segmentations in the CBCT images to quantitatively measure the convergence of the shape and the volume. Other image features were also used to evaluate the overall performance of the registration.  Results:   The algorithm was able to complete the segmentation and registration process within 1 min, and the superimposed clinical objects achieved a volumetric similarity measure of over 90% between the reference and the registered data. Validation results also showed that the proposed registration could accurately trace the deformation inside the target volume with average errors of less than 1 mm. The method had a solid performance in registering the simulated images with up to 20 Hounsfield unit white noise added. Also, the side by side comparison with the original demons algorithm demonstrated its improved registration performance over the local pixel-based registration approaches.  Conclusions:   Given the strength and efficiency of the algorithm, the proposed method has significant clinical potential to accelerate and to improve the CBCT delineation and targets tracking in online IGRT applications.""","""['Ting Chen', 'Sung Kim', 'Sharad Goyal', 'Salma Jabbour', 'Jinghao Zhou', 'Gunaretnum Rajagopal', 'Bruce Haffty', 'Ning Yue']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A 3D global-to-local deformable mesh model based registration and anatomy-constrained segmentation method for image guided prostate radiotherapy.', '3D meshless prostate segmentation and registration in image guided radiotherapy.', 'Quantitative evaluation of a cone-beam computed tomography-planning computed tomography deformable image registration method for adaptive radiation therapy.', 'Advances in 4D medical imaging and 4D radiation therapy.', 'Technological approaches to in-room CBCT imaging.', 'Autosegmentation of the rectum on megavoltage image guidance scans.', 'Evaluation of the accuracy and clinical practicality of a calculation system for patient positional displacement in carbon ion radiotherapy at five sites.', 'Evaluation of Deformable Image Registration-Based Contour Propagation From Planning CT to Cone-Beam CT.', 'Development of an automatic evaluation method for patient positioning error.', 'A protocol to extend the longitudinal coverage of on-board cone-beam CT.']"""

Our data reveal that LRES is associated with regional histone deacetylation combined with subdomains of different epigenetic remodelling patterns, which include re-enforcement, gain or exchange of repressive histone, and DNA methylation marks. The transcriptional and epigenetic state of genes in normal prostate epithelial and human embryonic stem cells can play a critical part in defining the mode of cancer-associated epigenetic remodelling.

Morphological characteristics and mast cell concentration were studied in proximal and distal zones after staining with hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa, respectively.  Results:   Citral induced mild benign prostatic hyperplasia. Mast cell numbers were increased significantly in both the proximal (2.97 +/- 0.52 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.17, p = 0.004) and distal zone (2.8 +/- 0.68 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.11, p = 0.011).  Conclusion:   Transdermal citral application resulted in a significant increase of mast cell numbers in the stroma of the rat ventral prostate.

Design and setting:   Using cross-sectional baseline data, we conducted a multinational prospective cohort observational study consisting of a population survey of community-dwelling men.  Participants:   A total of 2748 men, aged 40-79 (mean +/- sd, 60.2 + 11.2) yr, were randomly recruited from eight European centers. Forty-three polymorphisms were genotyped in the following genes: androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta (ESR1 and ESR2), steroid 5alpha-reductase type II (SRD5A2), 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), aromatase (CYP19A1), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), LH beta-subunit (LHB), and LH receptor (LHCGR).  Main outcome measures:   We measured the associations between gene polymorphisms and endocrine, metabolic, and phenotypic parameters related to aging and sex hormone action.  Results:   Several polymorphisms in SHBG, ESR2, AR, CYP19A1, and LHB were significantly associated with circulating levels of SHBG, LH, total, free, and bioavailable testosterone and estradiol, the LH x testosterone product, and indices of insulin sensitivity. Apart from several previously reported associations between genes affecting estrogen levels and heel ultrasound parameters, no associations existed between polymorphisms and nonhormonal variables (anthropometry, blood lipids, blood pressure, hemoglobin, prostate symptoms, prostate-specific antigen, sexual dysfunction, cognition).  Conclusion:   In aging men, polymorphisms in genes related to the pituitary-testicular endocrine function significantly influence circulating LH, testosterone, and estradiol levels, but the downstream effects may be too small to influence secondary phenotypic parameters.""","""['Ilpo T Huhtaniemi', 'Stephen R Pye', 'Kate L Holliday', 'Wendy Thomson', ""Terence W O'Neill"", 'Hazel Platt', 'Debbie Payne', 'Sally L John', 'Min Jiang', 'György Bartfai', 'Steven Boonen', 'Felipe F Casanueva', 'Joseph D Finn', 'Gianni Forti', 'Aleksander Giwercman', 'Thang S Han', 'Krzysztof Kula', 'Michael E J Lean', 'Neil Pendleton', 'Margus Punab', 'Alan J Silman', 'Dirk Vanderschueren', 'Fernand Labrie', 'Frederick C W Wu;European Male Aging Study Group']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['Increased estrogen rather than decreased androgen action is associated with longer androgen receptor CAG repeats.', 'A 5α-reductase (SRD5A2) polymorphism is associated with serum testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin in men, while aromatase (CYP19A1) polymorphisms are associated with oestradiol and luteinizing hormone reciprocally.', 'Genetic variations associated with the effect of testicular cancer treatment on gonadal hormones.', 'Genetic variants of sex hormone-binding globulin and their biological consequences.', 'Effects of age on testicular function.', 'Genetic Determinants of Circulating Estrogen Levels and Evidence of a Causal Effect of Estradiol on Bone Density in Men.', ""'Carriers of variant luteinizing hormone (V-LH) among 1593 Baltic men have significantly higher serum LH'."", 'Associations between Salivary Testosterone Levels, Androgen-Related Genetic Polymorphisms, and Self-Estimated Ejaculation Latency Time.', 'Prostate cancer: from the pathophysiologic implications of some genetic risk factors to translation in personalized cancer treatments.', 'Late-onset hypogonadism: current concepts and controversies of pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment.']"""

We determined whether state level variation in the cost of radical prostatectomy exists and whether we could explain this variation by adjusting for covariates associated with cost.  Materials and methods:   Using the 2004 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample of 7,978,041 patients we identified 9,917 who were 40 years old or older with a diagnosis of prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy without cystectomy. We used linear regression to examine state level regional variation in radical prostatectomy costs, controlling for the local area wage index, patient demographics, case mix and hospital characteristics.  Results:   The mean +/- SD unadjusted cost was $9,112 +/- $4,434 (range $2,001 to $49,922). The unadjusted mean cost ranged from $12,490 in California to $4,650 in Utah, each significantly different from the mean of $8,903 in the median state, Washington (p <0.0001). After adjusting for all potential confounders total cost was highest in Colorado and lowest in New Jersey, which were significantly different from the median, Washington ($10,750 and $5,899, respectively, vs $8,641, p <0.0001). The model explained 85.9% of the variance with regional variation accounting for the greatest incremental proportion of variance (35.1%) and case mix variables accounting for an incremental 32.3%.  Conclusions:   The total cost of radical prostatectomy varies significantly across states. Controlling for known total cost determinants did not completely explain these differences but altered ordinal cost relationships among states. Cost variation suggests inefficiencies in the health care market. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these variations in total cost translate into differences in quality or outcome and how they may be translated into useful policy measures.""","""['Danil V Makarov', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Adam B Landman', 'Matthew E Nielsen', 'Cary P Gross', 'Douglas L Leslie', 'David F Penson', 'Rani A Desai']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'A nationwide charge comparison of the principal treatments for early stage prostate carcinoma.', 'Cost comparison of robotic, laparoscopic, and open radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Cost comparison of radical retropubic and radical perineal prostatectomy: single institution experience.', 'Average charges for a radical prostatectomy and a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): geographic variations, 1994.', 'Practical Guide to Surgical Data Sets: Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample (NIS).', 'Variation in the use of MRI for cervical spine clearance: an opportunity to simultaneously improve clinical care and decrease cost.', 'A Nationwide Analysis of Cost Variation for Autologous Free Flap Breast Reconstruction.', 'Understanding Inpatient Cost Variation in Kidney Transplantation: Implications for Payment Reforms.', 'Regional Cost Variations of Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Compared With Open Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Understanding regional variation in Medicare expenditures for initial episodes of prostate cancer care.']"""

Using a saturated fat based diet we previously found no significant difference in tumor growth between low and high fat fed SCID mice (Taconic Farms, Hudson, New York) xenografted with LAPC-4 cells. Whether similar results would hold in a castration model is unclear.  Materials and methods:   A total of 80 male SCID mice were fed a Western diet (40% fat and 44% carbohydrate) and injected with LAPC-4 human prostate cancer cells. When tumors were 200 mm(3), the mice were castrated and randomized to an isocaloric Western or a low fat diet (12% fat and 72% carbohydrate). Animals were sacrificed when tumors were 1,000 mm(3). Serum was collected and assayed for prostate specific antigen, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3. Tumors were assayed for total and phosphorylated Akt.  Results:   Mouse weight was equivalent in the 2 groups. Overall dietary group was not significantly associated with survival (log rank p = 0.32). There were no statistically significant differences in prostate specific antigen (p = 0.53), insulin-like growth factor axis parameters (each p >0.05) or p-Akt-to-t-Akt ratios (p = 0.22) between the groups at sacrifice.  Conclusions:   In this xenograft model we found no difference in tumor growth or survival between low fat vs Western fed mice when the fat source was saturated fat. These results conflict with those of other studies in which corn oil was used to show that low fat diets delay prostate cancer growth, suggesting that fat type may be as important as fat amount in the prostate cancer setting.""","""['Jessica C Lloyd', 'Jodi A Antonelli', 'Tameika E Phillips', 'Elizabeth M Masko', 'Jean-Alfred Thomas', 'Susan H M Poulton', 'Michael Pollak', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['The effect of carbohydrate restriction on prostate cancer tumor growth in a castrate mouse xenograft model.', 'Carbohydrate restriction, prostate cancer growth, and the insulin-like growth factor axis.', 'Effect of isocaloric low-fat diet on human LAPC-4 prostate cancer xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice and the insulin-like growth factor axis.', 'Dietary intervention strategies to modulate prostate cancer risk and prognosis.', 'The role of dietary fat throughout the prostate cancer trajectory.', 'Specific Gut Microbial Environment in Lard Diet-Induced Prostate Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Research Evidence on High-Fat Diet-Induced Prostate Cancer Development and Progression.', 'TRAMP prostate tumor growth is slowed by walnut diets through altered IGF-1 levels, energy pathways, and cholesterol metabolism.', 'Diet, obesity, and cancer progression: are adipocytes the link?', 'Prostate tumor growth is impaired by CtBP1 depletion in high-fat diet-fed mice.']"""

However, wild-type vesicular stomatitis virus can induce a strong systemic immunological response and replicate in the central nervous system, potentially limiting its clinical usefulness. We report the construction of the recombinant, replication restricted vesicular stomatitis virus encoding SV5-F, which can induce syncytial formation with enhanced oncolytic properties against TRAMP-C2 tumors in an immunocompetent mouse model of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We constructed the SV5-F recombinant restricted virus vector by replacing the vesicular stomatitis virus G gene with that of the SV5-F transgene to generate rVSV-DeltaG-SV5-F. Morphological changes and DNA fragmentation induced by rVSV-DeltaG-GFP or rVSV-DeltaG-SV5-F were determined by phase contrast microscopy and gel electrophoresis. In vitro cytotoxicity by recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus was done by MTT assay. In vivo study of rVSV treatment was done in immunocompetent mice by subcutaneous administration of TRAMP-C2 cells.  Results:   In vitro characterization of the recombinant fusogenic VSV-DeltaG vector on TRAMP-C2 cells showed significantly enhanced apoptotic and cytotoxic effects relative to a similar virus encoding green fluorescent protein, that is rVSV-DeltaG-GFP. Regardless of initial tumor size intratumor rVSV-DeltaG-SV5-F administration in mice bearing subcutaneous TRAMP-C2 tumors resulted in a significantly reduced tumor load over that of the nonfusogenic green fluorescent control virus and of heat inactivated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus in treated animals (p <0.01).

Expression of the CCN family of extracellular matrix associated proteins is often modified in disease states. Depending on cancer type these changes are linked with enhanced or inhibited tumor growth. We characterized Cyr61 in prostate cancer. Cyr61 is an integrin binding matricellular protein with altered expression in many cancer types.  Materials and methods:   Cyr61 expression in prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and normal tissues was evaluated by microarray analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and tissue microarray. Immunoblots were analyzed to assess endogenous protein expression in prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   On genomic analysis Cyr61 up-regulation was observed in prostate cancer tissue and in normal prostate tissue adjacent to tumor vs that in prostate donor tissue. In 174 matched tumors and normal prostate tissues adjacent to tumor tissue microarray revealed significantly up-regulated Cyr61 protein expression in cancer tissue vs normal prostate tissue adjacent to tumor. Also, increased Cyr61 expression correlated with Gleason sum 8 or greater cancer. Staining in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was moderately up-regulated vs that in normal prostate tissue adjacent to tumor but generally less intense than in carcinoma tissue.  Conclusions:   In addition to the correlation with more advanced disease, the strong association between Cyr61 expression and prostate cancer supports the potential usefulness of Cyr61 as a novel biomarker for prostate cancer. This warrants further analysis to determine the mechanisms by which Cyr61 may contribute to prostate cancer development and progression.""","""[""Katherine B D'Antonio"", 'Antoun Toubaji', 'Roula Albadine', 'Alison M Mondul', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'George J Netto', 'Robert H Getzenberg']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Cyr61 is up-regulated in prostate cancer and associated with the p53 gene status.', 'Decreased expression of Cyr61 is associated with prostate cancer recurrence after surgical treatment.', 'Increased expression of CYR61, an extracellular matrix signaling protein, in human benign prostatic hyperplasia and its regulation by lysophosphatidic acid.', 'Expression of the extracellular matrix signaling molecule Cyr61 is downregulated in prostate cancer.', 'Cyr61 is a potential prognostic marker for prostate cancer.', 'Acidosis-Induced Regulation of Egr1 and Ccn1 In Vitro and in Experimental Tumours In Vivo.', 'Serum CYR61 as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of esophagogastric junction tumor.', 'Zonal regulation of collagen-type proteins and posttranslational modifications in prostatic benign and cancer tissues by imaging mass spectrometry.', 'Pericyte FAK negatively regulates Gas6/Axl signalling to suppress tumour angiogenesis and tumour growth.', 'CYR61, a potential biomarker of tumor inflammatory response in epithelial ovarian cancer microenvironment of tumor progress.']"""

Methods and materials:   The study included 199 patients with prostate cancer treated by permanent seed brachytherapy alone: the first 105 with seeds of lower activity (first cohort), the following 94 with higher seed activity (second cohort). The V100, V150, V200, and D90 were analyzed on the CT scan 30 days after implantation (CTD30). The V100, V150, and D2 of the rectum were also calculated on CTD30. Seed loss was determined 30 days after implantation. Urinary toxicity was measured with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire.  Results:   Lower seed activity was associated with lower V150 and V200 (p = 0.01 and p ≤ 0.001, respectively) on CTD30. More patients had a V100 <90% and D90 <140 Gy in the lower activity cohort (p = 0.098 for D90 and p = 0.029 for V100) on CTD30. There was no difference between cohorts in dose to the rectum (p = 0.325-0.516) or difference in patients' IPSS score from baseline (p = 0.0.117-0.618), although there was a trend toward more urinary toxicity at 4 and 8 months for high activity seeds. Seed loss as a percentage of implanted seeds was not different (p = 0.324).  Conclusions:   Higher seed activity (I(125) ≥ 0.6 mCi) results in at least equal V100 and D90 on CTD30.

Objective:   Our aim was to determine the age-specific risks of PCa and the risk of death from PCa according to the number and the age of affected first-degree relatives.  Design, setting, and participants:   The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database includes a record of >11.8 million individuals and their cancers from 1958 to 2006. All men from the database with identified parents (>3.9 million individuals) were followed between 1961 and 2006. The study included 26 651 PCa patients, of whom 5623 were familial.  Measurements:   The age-specific hazard ratios (HRs) of PCa and the HRs of death from PCa were calculated according to the number and age of affected fathers and brothers.  Results and limitations:   The HRs of PCa diagnosis increased with the number of affected relatives and decreased with increasing age. The highest HRs were observed for men <65 yr of age with three affected brothers (HR: approximately 23) and the lowest for men between 65 and 74 yr of age with an affected father (HR: approximately 1.8). The HRs increased with decreasing paternal or fraternal diagnostic age. The pattern of the risk of death from familial PCa was similar to the incidence data.

Since electrosurgical transurethral resection of the prostate is a difficult procedure to master, we hypothesized that recent residents are lacking in training for this procedure. We used summary case log information provided by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to determine if the number of electrosurgical transurethral prostate resection procedures performed by graduating chief residents has decreased and if there has been an increase in surgical adverse events. In addition, we investigated whether the increased number of laser procedures impacted the rate of adverse events.  Materials and methods:   Summary operative data from graduating chief resident case logs were provided by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for academic years 2001 to 2007. The numbers of electrosurgical transurethral prostate resection procedures, laser procedures and procedures for adverse events were recorded for each year.  Results:   The number of electrosurgical transurethral prostate resection procedures performed by graduating chief residents has steadily decreased from 58 in 2001 to 43 in 2007. Conversely the number of laser procedures started increasing in 2004. The rate of procedures for adverse events as a percentage of electrosurgical transurethral resection of the prostate procedures increased during the study period (from 3% in 2001 to 6% in 2007), and as a percentage of electrosurgical transurethral resection of the prostate and laser procedures the rate increased until 2005 and subsequently started decreasing.  Conclusions:   The rate of surgical adverse events, as measured by the need for subsequent procedures, has increased during the last 7 years. However, when laser procedures are accounted for, it appears that adverse events have recently started trending down as an increasing number of laser procedures started being performed.""","""['Jaspreet S Sandhu', 'William I Jaffe', 'Doreen E Chung', 'Steven A Kaplan', 'Alexis E Te']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['The early postoperative morbidity of transurethral resection of the prostate and of 4 minimally invasive treatment alternatives.', 'External validation of a virtual reality transurethral resection of the prostate simulator.', 'Prostate heating patterns comparing electrosurgical transurethral resection and vaporization: a prospective randomized study.', 'Time to rebrand transurethral resection of the prostate?', 'Instrumental treatments for benign prostatic obstruction.', 'Residency Surgical BPH Training Paradigms from MIST to HOLEP.', 'Comparison of Photoselective Vaporization versus Holmium Laser Enucleation for Treatment of Benign Prostate Hyperplasia in a Small Prostate Volume.', 'Analysis of the learning curve for transurethral resection of the prostate.

We examined the surgical margin learning curve and investigated whether surgical margins are a good marker for oncological outcome.  Materials and methods:   The study cohort included 7,765 patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy by 1 of 72 surgeons at a total of 4 major American academic medical centers. We calculated the learning curve for surgical margins and a concordance probability between the surgeon rates of positive surgical margins and 5-year biochemical recurrence.  Results:   A positive surgical margin was identified in 2,059 patients (27%). On multivariate analysis surgeon experience was strongly associated with surgical margin status (p = 0.017). The probability of a positive surgical margin was 40% for a surgeon with 10 prior cases, which decreased to 25% for a surgeon with 250 (absolute difference 15%, 95% CI 11 to 18). Learning curves differed dramatically among surgeons. For surgeon pairs the surgeon with the superior positive surgical margin rate also had the better biochemical recurrence rate only 58% of the time.  Conclusions:   We noted a learning curve for surgical margins after open radical prostatectomy. The poor concordance between surgeon margin and recurrence rates suggests that while margins clearly matter and efforts should be made to decrease positive margin rates, surgical margin status is not a strong surrogate for cancer control.

Retrospective studies have suggested that an isoform of proenzyme prostate specific antigen called [-2]proenzyme prostate specific antigen may enhance the specificity of prostate specific antigen based screening. We examined the usefulness of this isoform in a prospective prostate cancer screening study.  Materials and methods:   From a population of 2,034 men undergoing prostate cancer screening we examined the relationship between the measurement of the [-2]isoform of proenzyme prostate specific antigen (p2PSA) and prostate cancer detection. Specifically we compared the usefulness of total prostate specific antigen, the ratio of free-to-total prostate specific antigen, the ratio of p2PSA-to-free prostate specific antigen, and a formula combining prostate specific antigen, free prostate specific antigen and p2PSA (the Beckman Coulter prostate health index or phi) to predict prostate cancer in men from the study undergoing prostate biopsy with a prostate specific antigen of 2.5 to 10 ng/ml and nonsuspicious digital rectal examination.  Results:   Despite similar total prostate specific antigen (p = 0.88), percent free prostate specific antigen (p = 0.02) and %p2PSA (p = 0.0006) distinguished between positive and negative biopsy results.

Setting the sensitivity at 88.5%, p2PSA led to a substantial improvement in specificity as well as positive and negative predictive values. The Beckman Coulter prostate health index (AUC 0.77) had the best overall performance characteristics.

Decreased cell growth correlated to time- and concentration-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 in both cell lines. Inhibition of cytosolic iPLA(2)beta using S-BEL, induced significantly higher levels of P-p53, p53, p21 and P-p38 expression than inhibition of microsomal iPLA2 gamma using R-BEL. Inhibition of p38 using SB202190 or SB203580 inhibited BEL-induced increases in P-p53 (ser15), p53 and p21, and altered the number of cells in G1 in LNCaP cells, and S-phase in PC-3 cells. BEL treatment also induced reactive species in PC-3 and LNCaP cells, which was partially reversed by pretreatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). NAC subsequently inhibited BEL-induced activation of p38 and p53 in LNCaP cells. In addition, treatment of cells with NAC partially reversed the effect of BEL on cell growth and preserved cell morphology.

The current concepts of conformality index (CI), equivalent uniform dose (EUD) derived from dose volume histogram (DVH) does not provide any spatial information. In this study, slice-based evaluation methods have been proposed for spatially analyzing the radiotherapy treatment plans. A case of prostate cancer has been selected for demonstrating the proposed tools for evaluating the dose distribution. Three dimensional conformal radiotherapy treatment planning (3D-CRT) was performed to a dose of 27 Gy/15# with three fields (6 MV anteroposterior and two 15 MV lateral fields) employing multileaf collimator after delivering 45 Gy/25#. The dose was normalized to isocenter and the treatment plan was evaluated with DVH. The dose maximum point, conformality index, planning target volume coverage index (PCI), planning target volume overdose index (POI) and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were evaluated for every single slice along the cranio-caudal direction for all the planning target volume (PTV) contours and plotted against the slice location. The dose maximum point plotted against the slice position helps in identifying the slices where the dose maximum point is outside the target volume. The plot of conformality index gives the information about the location of those slices where excess of surrounding normal tissues is encompassed inside the prescription isodose. POI quantifies the high dose regions inside the PTV slices that receive doses above 107% of the prescription dose. Similarly, the plot of PCI and EUD with slice position gives the information about those slices where the tumor is not covered adequately. The proposed methods in this study forms as a simpler way to assess the spatial distribution of the dose inside the target volume.

For the males, QOL issues emerged as the primary area of concern, whereas survival of their husbands was considered most important among the female spouses. The male respondents expressed unease with the sexual side effects of their cancer treatment, such as erectile dysfunction and decreased sexual desire and satisfaction. Female spouses recognized decreased sexual desire in their partners following treatment, but this was not considered a primary concern.

Recently, Par-4 has been suggested to be a tumour suppressor gene that plays a role in the development of endometrial carcinomas (ECs), but the exact mechanism remains to be clarified. Here we examined gene activation signalling cascades and influence on cell kinetics during endometrial tumourigenesis. In normal endometrium, constitutively high levels of Par-4 expression were observed in epithelial cells through the menstrual cycle, in contrast to the transient up-regulation in stromal components in the menstrual stage, correlated positively with the phospho-p65 (pp65) status and apoptosis. In contrast, most ECs exhibited significant down-regulation as compared to normal endometrium, with positive links only to pp65 expression. In EC cell lines, transfection of the NF-kappaB subunit p65 led to transactivation of Par-4 through specific binding to its promoter region, in contrast to the suppression by active Akt, suggesting that the balance between the two signals may be important to determine Par-4 expression levels. In addition, transient overexpression of Par-4 resulted in the induction of not only apoptosis but also senescence, through changes in the expression of bcl-2 and p21$;{{\rm WAF1}}$, respectively. Together, these findings suggest that a signalling cascade involving sequential activation of NF-kappaB/p65 and Par-4 may participate in relatively early events of endometrial tumourigenesis, leading to modulation of cell kinetics including apoptosis and cell cycle progression.""","""['Makoto Saegusa', 'Miki Hashimura', 'Takeshi Kuwata', 'Isao Okayasu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['Transcriptional up-regulation of Sox9 by NF-κB in endometrial carcinoma cells, modulating cell proliferation through alteration in the p14(ARF)/p53/p21(WAF1) pathway.', 'Apoptosis and apoptosis-related factors Bcl-2, Bax, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and NF-kappaB in human endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma.', 'Cell-cycle regulators, bcl-2 and NF-kappaB in Epstein-Barr virus-positive gastric carcinomas.', 'Molecular links between endometriosis and cancer.', 'DNA Methylation Machinery in the Endometrium and Endometrial Cancer.', 'The regulatory mechanisms and inhibitors of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 in cancer.', 'Expression of PAWR predicts prognosis of ovarian cancer.', 'PAR-4 overcomes chemo-resistance in breast cancer cells by antagonizing cIAP1.', 'TNF-α and IFN-γ Together Up-Regulates Par-4 Expression and Induce Apoptosis in Human Neuroblastomas.', 'The Role of Prostate Apoptosis Response-4 (Par-4) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infected Macrophages.']"""

Significant differences were observed between TV and pT. The TVs in pT2a, pT2b and pT3/4 were 0.54+/-0.54, 1.63+/-1.47 and 2.67+/-1.80 ml, respectively. The median follow-up period was 32.3 months (range from 15 to 45) after radical prostatectomy, and PSA recurrence was observed in 32 cases. Patients with smaller TV (TV <1.3 ml) had a higher PSA-free survival rate (89.5%) than those with a larger TV (TV > or = 1.3 ml, 66.7%) with a significant difference atp <0.001 (log-rank test). A multivariate analysis was performed for PSA, TV, pT, Gleason Score (GS), and surgical margins. Significant differences were observed for GS, and surgical margins, but not for TV. Clinically organ-confined disease in Japanese patients with prostate cancer included various cancers from clinically insignificant to locally advanced ones.

PSP94 is one of the most abundant proteins from prostatic secretions and a primary constituent of human semen. PSP94 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis, and its expression gradually decreases during progression of the prostate cancer. It is a rapidly evolving protein with homologues present in several species with 10 conserved cysteine residues. PSP94 homologues show high-affinity binding with different proteins from the cysteine-rich secretory protein family, some of which have been shown to be ion channel blockers. Here, we report the crystal structure of human PSP94 at 2.3 A resolution. The structure shows that the amino and the carboxyl ends of the polypeptide chain are held in close proximity facing each other. A strong hydrogen bond between these ends, which are located respectively on the first and the last beta-strands, leads to formation of an almost straight edge in PSP94 structure. Crystal structure shows that these edges from two PSP94 monomers associate in antiparallel fashion, leading to formation of a dimer. Our studies further show that dimers dissociate into monomers at acidic pH, possibly through distortion of the straight edge. Further, based on several observations, we propose that PSP94 binds to cysteine-rich secretory proteins and immunoglobulin G through the same edge, which is involved in the formation of PSP94 dimeric interface.""","""['Ashwani Kumar', 'Dhanashree D Jagtap', 'Smita D Mahale', 'Mukesh Kumar']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Mol Biol""","""['Crystal structure of the peptidoglycan recognition protein at 1.8 A resolution reveals dual strategy to combat infection through two independent functional homodimers.', 'Analysis of epitope structure of PSP94 (prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids): (I).

Despite its unknown physiologic function, however, it has been proposed as a biomarker for hepatocellular and prostate carcinoma due to its upregulation in those cancer entities. Whether the overexpression of GOLPH2 is tumour specific or a generic parameter of malignancy and whether this finding is true for additional carcinomas has not been determined. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression pattern of GOLPH2 in testicular seminomas, the most common histologic subtype of testicular neoplasm.  Methods:   GOLPH2 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 69 testicular seminomas and compared to the expression rates in matching normal testicular tissue and intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unclassified type (IGCNU). In addition, a subset of Leydig cell tumours was analyzed accordingly.  Results:   GOLPH2 was consistently overexpressed (89.9%) in seminomas. Matching non-neoplastic tissue showed weak or negative staining. The observed differences between non-neoplastic and neoplastic tissue were statistically highly significant (p < 0.001). There were no significant associations with tumour status. Interestingly, GOLPH2 was also highly expressed in the intertubular Leydig cells as well as in Leydig cell tumours.  Conclusions:   GOLPH2 protein is highly expressed in seminomas and in Leydig cell tumours. This study fosters the association of GOLPH2 with malignant neoplastic processes. The staining pattern is easily assessable and consistent which is a favourable property especially in clinical settings. GOLPH2 could be a novel immunohistochemical marker for the assessment of testicular neoplasms, especially against the background that in analogy to hepatocellular carcinomas complementary GOLPH2 serum levels might be helpful in detecting metastases or recurrent tumour. Therefore serum studies and analyses of GOLPH2 expression in non-seminomatous germ cell tumours are strongly warranted.""","""['Florian R Fritzsche', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Marc-Oliver Riener', 'Manfred Dietel', 'Beibei Oelrich']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['CD10 is frequently expressed in classical seminomas.', 'RNA-binding protein LIN28 is a marker for testicular germ cell tumors.', 'Wnt suppressor and stem cell regulator TCF7L1 is a sensitive immunohistochemical marker to differentiate testicular seminoma from non-seminomatous germ cell tumor.', 'Clinical presentation of testicular germinal cancer.', 'Growth regulatory factors and signalling proteins in testicular germ cell tumours.', 'Golgi Phosphoprotein 73: The Driver of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Cancer.', 'Golgi protein 73, hepatocellular carcinoma and other types of cancers.', 'Research progress on GP73 in malignant tumors.', 'Quantitative screening of serum protein biomarkers by reverse phase protein arrays.', 'GP73 level determines chemotherapeutic resistance in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.']"""

In this study we are the first to investigate a potential association between variants in an autoimmune related region on chromosome 4q27 and prostate cancer risk. This region harbors two cytokine genes IL-2 and the recently described IL-21.  Methods:   We genotyped six variants previously associated with autoimmune disease (namely rs13151961, rs13119723, rs17388568, rs3136534, rs6822844 and rs6840978) and one functional IL-2 promoter variant (rs2069762) for possible association with prostate cancer risk using the Australian Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer case-control Study.  Results:   Overall, our results do not support an association between the seven variants at position 4q27 and prostate cancer risk. Per allele odds ratios (ORs) were not significantly different from 1 (all P-values = 0.06). However, we found suggestive evidence for a significant association between the presence of the rs13119723 variant (located in a protein of unknown function) and men with a family history of prostate cancer in first-degree relatives (P-value for interaction 0.02).

Patients and methods:   Within the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor database, we identified men diagnosed between 1995 and 2001 with localized prostate cancer treated with RP. SF and SB outcomes, measured using the University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index, were assessed at 6-month intervals for 4 years after RP.  Results:   In all, 620 men met the study criteria; at 6 months after RP, overall and all the specific domains of SF declined, with improvement in most specific domains by 2 years after RP. The greatest declines were in the ability to achieve erections, high-quality erections, and frequent erections; these domains were also most strongly correlated with overall SF. Sexual desire was relatively preserved, and there was a weak correlation between overall SF and sexual desire after RP, when there was the greatest discrepancy between sexual desire and other domains of function. SB showed continued improvement over time to 4 years but was not well correlated with any measurements of SF assessed. Younger age, college education, sexual aid and medication use, the absence of comorbid conditions, and nerve-sparing surgery were predictive of significant recovery of function in several specific domains of SF.  Conclusions:   RP affects specific domains of SF to differing degrees. Compromised erectile function is most commonly reported among these specific domains and seems to play a more dominant role in determining overall SF, but notably none of the domains of function were closely linked to SB. Because education is protective in the perception of bother, appropriate counselling and the setting of expectations for outcomes in overall and specific domains of SF might lead to improved quality of life after treatment for prostate cancer.""","""['Jesse D Le', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Natalia Sadetsky', 'Adam B Hittelman', 'Maxwell V Meng', 'Janet E Cowan', 'David M Latini', 'Peter R Carroll;CaPSURE Investigators']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Quality of life after radical prostatectomy in Japanese men: 2 year longitudinal study.', 'Life after radical prostatectomy: a longitudinal study.', 'Health related quality of life outcomes after radical prostatectomy: attention to study design and the patient-based importance of single-surgeon studies.', 'Prevention and management of postprostatectomy sexual dysfunctions part 2: recovery and preservation of erectile function, sexual desire, and orgasmic function.', 'Evaluation of combined oncological and functional outcomes after radical prostatectomy: trifecta rate of achieving continence, potency and cancer control--a literature review.', 'Erectile Dysfunction A Prospective Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study Evaluating the Effect of Low-Intensity Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (LI-ESWT) in Men With Erectile Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Penile Rehabilitation and Treatment Options for Erectile Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy and Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Role of regenerative therapies on erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy.', 'The Relative Impact of Urinary and Sexual Function vs Bother on Health Utility for Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'On the Relationship Between Erectile Function and Sexual Distress in Men with Prostate Cancer.']"""

This is the first report on the uptake of such interventions in Chinese mutation carriers residing in Asia.  Methods:   Breast and ovarian cancer index patients and family members referred for genetic counselling and testing who are found to carry the BRCA mutations were included in this multicenter study.  Results:   A total of 31 patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer were found to carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Forty-one tested family members also carried the mutations. Of the females, 85.7% of the index patients opted for breast surveillance and 23.8% for prophylactic mastectomy. Of the family members, 82.4% chose breast surveillance and 17.7% had prophylactic mastectomy. The majority of index patients and family members preferred ovarian surveillance (84 and 82.4%). Amongst the index patients, 32% decided for prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy; 17.6% of the family members who did not have history of ovarian cancer decided to have prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy. All male index patients agreed to breast and prostate surveillance, including breast clinical examination and PSA monitoring. For those male family members found to be BRCA mutation carriers, 56.3% agreed to have breast surveillance and 66.7% agreed to have prostate surveillance.

Current imaging techniques are not optimal to stage early PC adequately. A promising alternative to PC imaging is peptide-based scintigraphy using radiolabelled bombesin (BN) analogues that bind to gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPR) being overexpressed in PC. When labelled to appropriate radionuclides BN targeting of GRPRs may also provide applications for peptide radionuclide receptor therapy (PRRT). Assessment studies under identical experimental conditions allowing a reliable comparison of the potential of such analogues are lacking. This study was performed to evaluate and directly compare five promising radiolabelled BN analogues for their targeting efficacy for PC under standardised conditions.  Methods:   The BN agonists [(111)In]DOTA-PESIN, [(111)In]AMBA, [(111)In]MP2346 and [(111)In]MP2653 and one antagonist [(99m)Tc]Demobesin-1 were evaluated in GRPR-overexpressing human PC-3 tumour-bearing mice to determine peptide stability in vivo, biodistribution and GRPR targeting potential by animal SPECT/CT imaging and ex vivo autoradiography.  Results:   HPLC analysis of blood showed intact Demobesin-1 at 5 and 15 min after injection (64.1 +/- 1.6% and 41.0 +/- 01%, respectively) being much less for the other compounds. AMBA, the second most stable analogue, showed 36.1 +/- 2.7% and 9.8 +/- 1.1% intact peptide after 5 and 15 min. PC-3 tumour uptake at 1 h was comparable for Demobesin-1, AMBA, PESIN and MP2346 (3.0 +/- 0.4, 2.7 +/- 0.5, 2.3 +/- 0.5 and 2.1 +/- 0.9%ID/g, respectively), but very low for MP2653 (0.9 +/- 0.2%ID/g). In addition, MP2346 showed undesirably high uptake in the kidneys (7.9 +/- 1.9%ID/g) being significantly less for the other analogues. AMBA, MP2346 and PESIN revealed favourable increases in tumour to blood ratios over time while changes in tumour to kidney and pancreas ratios for Demobesin-1 from 1 to 24 h after injection were significantly better than for the other analogues. All analogues visualised PC-3 tumours by SPECT/CT and autoradiography.  Conclusion:   In the present study the BN antagonist Demobesin-1 was the best performing analogue showing superior in vivo stability, highest tumour uptake and retention while pancreatic and renal clearance were rapid. PESIN and AMBA were the best GRP agonists with sufficient in vivo stabilities as well as high tumour uptake and retention. Based on these results all three analogues deserve further evaluation for clinical use in PC patients.""","""['Rogier P J Schroeder', 'Cristina Müller', 'Suzanne Reneman', 'Marleen L Melis', 'Wout A P Breeman', 'Erik de Blois', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Eric P Krenning', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Marion de Jong']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-based targeting using bombesin analogues is superior to metabolism-based targeting using choline for in vivo imaging of human prostate cancer xenografts.', '99mTcDemobesin 1, a novel potent bombesin analogue for GRP receptor-targeted tumour imaging.', 'DOTA-PESIN, a DOTA-conjugated bombesin derivative designed for the imaging and targeted radionuclide treatment of bombesin receptor-positive tumours.', '99mTc-labeled N40,Pro1,Tyr4bombesin.', '99mTc-N40-1-bzlg0,D-Phe6,Leu-NHEt13,des-Met14Bombesin(6–14).', 'Scandium-44: Diagnostic Feasibility in Tumor-Related Angiogenesis.', 'Targeting the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRP-R) in Cancer Therapy: Development of Bombesin-Based Peptide-Drug Conjugates.', 'PET Probes for Preclinical Imaging of GRPR-Positive Prostate Cancer: Comparative Preclinical Study of 68GaGa-NODAGA-AMBA and 44ScSc-NODAGA-AMBA.', 'Factors Influencing the Therapeutic Efficacy of the PSMA Targeting Radioligand 212Pb-NG001.', 'Synthesis, Characterization and In Vitro Evaluation of Hybrid Monomeric Peptides Suited for Multimodal Imaging by PET/OI: Extending the Concept of Charge-Cell Binding Correlation.']"""

PCa loses expression of CD44 standard (CD44s) which is present in benign epithelium, and overexpresses a novel splice variant isoform, CD44v7-10, specifically facilitating fibronectin binding and invasion. Naturally-occurring or synthetic phenyl-methylene hydantoin (PMH) and S-ethyl PMH (S-PMH) can reportedly augment cell-cell adhesion, and reduce invasion and growth of PCa. Benign BPH-1 and malignant PC-3M prostate cells were treated with PMH or S-PMH for 36 h and cells were harvested. Cell adhesion assays were carried out. Cancer cells' expression of total CD44 and CD44v7-10 were tested by western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR. Compared to BPH-1 or PC-3M cells treated with vehicle only, PMH-or S-PMH-treated benign and malignant cells had decreased adhesion to hyaluronan (p=0.001 to 0.007) and fibronectin (p<0.001 to 0.047). Both compounds decreased PCa expression of CD44 total mRNA (representing mostly CD44s, to 0.076+/-0.033 and 0.254+/-0.123 of control) and CD44v7-10 (to 0.386+/-0.279 and 0.115+/-0.037 of control). S-PMH but not PMH decreased CD44 total protein, while both decreased CD44v7-10 protein. Both hydantoins lowered beta-catenin, as reported previously. Both only slightly decreased beta1-integrin, the definitive receptor for fibronectin. In conclusion, the ability of PMH and S-PMH to decrease hyaluronan adhesion appears to be mediated through decreased CD44s, while the decrease in fibronectin adhesion correlates with, and may be mediated by, decreased CD44v7-10.""","""['Kui Yang', 'Yaqiong Tang', 'Kenneth A Iczkowski']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Transl Res""","""['Cell adhesion molecule CD44: its functional roles in prostate cancer.', 'Stable alterations of CD44 isoform expression in prostate cancer cells decrease invasion and growth and alter ligand binding and chemosensitivity.', 'Silibinin suppresses CD44 expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'CD44: structure, function, and association with the malignant process.', 'Involvement of CD44 and its variant isoforms in membrane-cytoskeleton interaction, cell adhesion and tumor metastasis.', 'Thermochemical Study of 1-Methylhydantoin.', 'Cell adhesion molecule CD44: its functional roles in prostate cancer.']"""

Upon binding of the ligand, the vitamin D receptor heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor and binds to vitamin D response elements in the promoter region of target genes to induce/repress their expression. The target genes that have been identified so far are heterogeneous in nature and reflect the great spectrum of biological activities of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Within the last two decades, the receptor has been shown to be present not only in classical target tissues such as bone, kidney, and intestine, but also in many other nonclassical tissues, for example, in the immune system (T and B cells, macrophages, and monocytes), in the reproductive system (uterus, testis, ovary, prostate, placenta, and mammary glands), in the endocrine system (pancreas, pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal cortex), in muscles (skeletal, smooth, and heart muscles), and in brain, skin, and liver. Besides the almost universal presence of vitamin D receptors, different cell types (for example, keratinocytes, monocytes, bone, placenta) are capable of metabolizing 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) by the enzyme 25(OH)D(3)-1alpha-hydroxylase, encoded by CYP27B1. The combined presence of CYP27B1 and the specific receptor in several tissues introduced the idea of a paracrine/autocrine role for 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) can induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of normal and malignant cells. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk for nearly all major human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. In addition to the treatment of bone disorders with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), these newly discovered functions open perspectives for the use of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) as an immune modulator (for example, for the treatment of autoimmune diseases or prevention of graft rejection), inhibitor of cell proliferation, and inducer of cell differentiation (cancer).""","""['Annemieke Verstuyf', 'Geert Carmeliet', 'Roger Bouillon', 'Chantal Mathieu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Kidney Int""","""['Vitamin D and cancer.', 'Vitamins as hormones.', 'Effects of calcium and of the Vitamin D system on skeletal and calcium homeostasis: lessons from genetic models.', 'The direct role of vitamin D on bone homeostasis.', 'The physiology of vitamin D : current concepts.', 'Editorial: The role of vitamin D in metabolic and cardiovascular health.', 'Vitamin D: A master example of nutrigenomics.', 'Urine trace element disorder along with renal function injury in vitamin D deficient diabetic rats and intervention effect of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.', 'Interaction of Vitamin D with Peptide Hormones with Emphasis on Parathyroid Hormone, FGF23, and the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System.', 'The Efficacious Benefit of 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D to Prevent COVID-19: An In-Silico Study Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein.']"""

They represent cribriform high-grade PIN (cribriform HGPIN), which can be an isolated finding not associated with PCa (isolated ACL), or ""intraductal carcinoma (IDC-P)"" that is almost always associated with infiltrative high-grade prostate carcinoma (PCa) (cancer-associated ACL, ACL-PCa). We report the incidence, topographic relation to cancer, and morphologic differences of these 2 lesions in radical prostatectomy and discuss the potential biologic basis and implication for diagnosis in prostate biopsy. ACL was defined as cribriform glands comprising cytologically malignant cells that spanned the entire glandular lumens with partial or complete basal cell lining confirmed by basal cell immunostaining. ACL intermixed with, or within 3 mm from the border of infiltrative PCa was categorized as ACL-PCa and was considered to be equivalent to IDC-P. ACLs other than ACL-PCa were considered as isolated ACL and equivalent to cribriform HGPIN. These histologic features of ACL were reviewed: number of ACL/prostate gland, size, glandular contour (round, irregular, branching), architectural pattern (dense cribriform, irregular cribriform, solid), comedonecrosis, and nuclear features (round and uniform, round with varying sizes, pleomorphic, giant nuclei [6x adjacent nuclei]). In 117 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens, ACL-PCa and isolated ACLs were found in 21 (17.9%) and 15 (12.8%), respectively. ACL-PCa was more common in PCa with Gleason score more than or equal to 7 and higher tumor volume. The isolated ACLs were more common in Gleason score 6 PCa and their incidence was not significantly different among PCa with different tumor volumes. The mean number of ACL per prostate was 23.8 for ACL-PCa and 2.4 for isolated ACL (P=0.008). The size ranged from 0.2 to 9.0 mm for ACL-PCa, and from 0.2 to 1 mm for isolated ACL. The branching contour was present in 36/43 ACL-PCa, but only in 1/23 isolated ACL (P<0.001). The dense cribriform and solid architecture were present in 6 (14.0%) and 4 (9.3%) of ACL-PCa, but none of the isolated ACLs. Comedonecrosis was present in 14/43 (32.6%) ACL-PCa, and in none of the isolated ACL (P=0.001). The pleomorphic nuclei or giant nuclei at least 6X of the adjacent nuclei, were present in 12 (27.9%) ACL-PCa, but in none of the isolated ACL (P=0.005). ACL can be found both in association with PCa or without associated infiltrative PCa. Isolated ACL is uncommon, and the overwhelming majority of ACLs is associated with high grade (GS> or =7) and high-volume PCa and represents IDC-P. Large gland size (>1 mm), large focus involving many glands (number>6), complex architecture, and high-grade nuclei are characteristic of IDC-P. However, cribriform HGPIN and IDC-P overlap at the ""low grade"" architectural and morphologic spectrum and are difficult to distinguish based on morphologic criteria alone. If a biopsy contains a small number of ACL glands with ""low grade"" morphology, it should be diagnosed as ""atypical cribriform lesion, cannot distinguish between cribriform HGPIN and IDC-P"" and a repeat biopsy should be strongly recommended to rule out unsampled PCa. In contrast, if a biopsy contains ACL with one or several features of large focus, architectural complexity with large branching glands, pleomorphic or giant nuclei, or comedonecrosis, the biopsy should be diagnosed as IDC-P and definitive therapy should be recommended.""","""['Rajal B Shah', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Bo Han', 'Ming Zhou']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['ETS gene aberrations in atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: Implications for the distinction between intraductal carcinoma of the prostate and cribriform high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: clinical significance, differential diagnosis and current concept of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasialike ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 28 cases.', 'High-grade foamy gland prostatic adenocarcinoma on biopsy or transurethral resection: a morphologic study of 55 cases.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'Identification of Morphologic Criteria Associated with Biochemical Recurrence in Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Comedonecrosis Revisited: Strong Association With Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Distinct DNA methylation alterations are associated with cribriform architecture and intraductal carcinoma in Gleason pattern 4 prostate tumors.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate Gland: Recent Advances.']"""

Using the repressed transactivator yeast two-hybrid system, we found that TATA binding protein-associated factor 1 (TAF1) interacted with the AR. In tissue microarrays, TAF1 was shown to steadily increase with duration of neoadjuvant androgen withdrawal and with progression to castration resistance. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays established that TAF1 bound through its acetylation and ubiquitin-activating/conjugating domains (E1/E2) directly to the AR N terminus. Coimmunoprecipitation and ChIP assays revealed colocalization of TAF1 and AR on the prostate-specific antigen promoter/enhancer in prostate cancer cells. With respect to modulation of AR activity, overexpression of TAF1 enhanced AR activity severalfold, whereas small interfering RNA knockdown of TAF1 significantly decreased AR transactivation. Although full-length TAF1 showed enhancement of both AR and some generic gene transcriptional activity, selective AR coactivator activity by TAF1 was demonstrated in transactivation experiments using cloned N-terminal kinase and E1/E2 functional domains. In keeping with AR coactivation by the ubiquitin-activating and -conjugating domain, TAF1 was found to greatly increase the cellular amount of polyubiquitinated AR. In conclusion, our results indicate that increased TAF1 expression is associated with progression of human prostate cancers to the lethal castration-resistant state. Because TAF1 is a coactivator of AR that binds and enhances AR transcriptional activity, its overexpression could be part of a compensatory mechanism adapted by cancer cells to overcome reduced levels of circulating androgens.""","""['Peyman Tavassoli', 'Latif A Wafa', 'Helen Cheng', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Martin Gleave', 'Robert Snoek', 'Paul S Rennie']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['TAF1 histone acetyltransferase activity in Sp1 activation of the cyclin D1 promoter.', 'Determinants of Gli2 co-activation of wildtype and naturally truncated androgen receptors.', 'Activation of p300 histone acetyltransferase activity and acetylation of the androgen receptor by bombesin in prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification and characterization of androgen receptor associated coregulators in prostate cancer cells.', 'Functional analysis of androgen receptor N-terminal and ligand binding domain interacting coregulators in prostate cancer.', 'Genomic analysis of an aggressive case with metastatic intrahepatic mucinous cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Analyzing the Androgen Receptor Interactome in Prostate Cancer: Implications for Therapeutic Intervention.', 'TAF1 inhibitor Bay-299 induces cell death in acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Long Noncoding RNA GAS5 Inhibits Osteogenic Differentiation through MicroRNA 382-3p/TAF1 Signaling.', 'Network-Based Analysis to Identify Drivers of Metastatic Prostate Cancer Using GoNetic.']"""

Data were prospectively collected in a customized database and retrospectively analyzed.  Intervention:   All patients underwent RARP performed by a single surgeon.  Measurements:   The data were collected prospectively in a customized database. Complications were classified using the Clavien grading system. To evaluate trends regarding complications and radiologic anastomotic leaks, we compared eight groups of 300 patients each, categorized according the surgeon's experience (number of cases).  Results and limitations:   Our median operative time was 90min (interquartile range [IQR]: 75-100min). The median estimated blood loss was 100ml (IQR:100-150ml). Our conversion rate was 0.08%, comprising two procedures converted to standard laparoscopy due to robot malfunction. One hundred and forty complications were observed in 127 patients (5.08%). The following percentages of patients presented graded complications: grade 1, 2.24%; grade 2, 1.8%; grade 3a, 0.08%; grade 3b, 0.48%; grade 4a, 0.40%. There were no cases of multiple organ dysfunction or death (grades 4b and 5). There were significant decreases in the overall complication rates (p=0.0034) and in the number of anastomotic leaks (p<0.001) as the surgeon's experience increased.  Conclusions:   RARP is a safe option for treatment of clinically localized PCa, presenting low complication rates in experienced hands. Although the robotic system provides the surgeon with enhanced vision and dexterity, proficiency is only accomplished with consistent surgical volume; complication rates demonstrated a tendency to decrease as the surgeon's experience increased.""","""['Rafael F Coelho', 'Kenneth J Palmer', 'Bernardo Rocco', 'Ravendra R Moniz', 'Sanket Chauhan', 'Marcelo A Orvieto', 'Geoff Coughlin', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Radical prostatectomy-only centers: the future in genitourinary surgery?', 'Radical prostatectomy: a single surgeon comparison of retropubic, perineal, and robotic approaches.', 'Safety profile of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a standardized report of complications in 3317 patients.', 'Complications and incidences in our first 250 robotic radical prostatectomies.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy in 2010.', 'Critical appraisal of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Low Risk of Venous Thromboembolism After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Through Systemic Image Assessment: A Prospective Study.', 'Division of dorsal vascular complex using soft coagulation without suture ligation during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a propensity score-matched study in a single-center experience.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Middle East: A report on the perioperative outcomes from a tertiary care centre in Lebanon.', 'Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Radical Prostatectomy-a Contemporary Review.', 'Triamcinolone acetonide injections for the treatment of recalcitrant post-radical prostatectomy vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis: A retrospective look at efficacy and safety.']"""

DNA vaccines have potential to activate the immune system against specific antigens, with accompanying potent immunological adjuvant effects from unmethylated CpG motifs as on prokaryotic DNA. We investigated an electroporation driven plasmid DNA vaccination strategy in animal models for treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Plasmid expressing human PSA gene (phPSA) was delivered in vivo by intra-muscular electroporation, to induce effective anti-tumour immune responses against prostate antigen expressing tumours. Groups of male C57 BL/6 mice received intra-muscular injections of phPSA plasmid. For phPSA delivery, quadriceps muscle was injected with 50 microg plasmid. After 80 seconds, square-wave pulses were administered in sequence using a custom designed pulse generator and a custom-designed applicator with 2 needles placed through the skin central to the muscle. To determine an optimum treatment regimen, three different vaccination schedules were investigated. In a separate experiment, the immune potential of the phPSA vaccine was further enhanced with co- administration of synthetic CpG rich oligonucleotides. One week after last vaccination, the mice were challenged subcutaneously with TRAMPC1/hPSA (prostate cancer cell line stably expressing human PSA) and tumour growth was monitored. Serum from animals was examined by ELISA for anti-hPSA antibodies and for IFN gamma. Histological assessment of the tumours was also carried out. In vivo and in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed with splenocytes from treated mice.  Results:   The phPSA vaccine therapy significantly delayed the appearance of tumours and resulted in prolonged survival of the animals. Four-dose vaccination regimen provided optimal immunological effects. Co - administration of the synthetic CpG with phPSA increased anti-tumour responses, preventing tumour occurrence in 54% of treated animals. Vaccination with phPSA resulted in anti-hPSA Abs production and a significant production of IFN gamma was observed in immunised animals (p < 0.05). Immune responses were tumour specific and were transferable in adoptive T cell transfer experiments.  Conclusions:   This phPSA plasmid electroporation vaccination strategy can effectively activate tumour specific immune responses. Optimisation of the approach indicated that a four-dose regimen provided highest tumour protection. In vivo electroporation mediated vaccination is a safe and effective modality for the treatment of prostate cancer and has a potential to be used as a neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy.""","""['Sarfraz Ahmad', 'Garrett Casey', 'Paul Sweeney', 'Mark Tangney', ""Gerald C O'Sullivan""]""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Genet Vaccines Ther""","""['Prostate stem cell antigen DNA vaccination breaks tolerance to self-antigen and inhibits prostate cancer growth.', 'DNA vaccination via RALA nanoparticles in a microneedle delivery system induces a potent immune response against the endogenous prostate cancer stem cell antigen.', 'The combination of TLR-9 adjuvantation and electroporation-mediated delivery enhances in vivo antitumor responses after vaccination with HPV-16 E7 encoding DNA.', 'Novel vaccines against M. tuberculosis.', 'DNA vaccination strategies for anti-tumour effective gene therapy protocols.', 'Engineered Akkermansia muciniphila: A promising agent against diseases (Review).', 'Electroporation-Based Treatments in Urology.', 'DNA vaccination for prostate cancer: key concepts and considerations.', 'Modeling of electric field distribution in tissues during electroporation.', 'DNA vaccination for prostate cancer, from preclinical to clinical trials - where we stand?']"""

IGFBP-3 forms complexes with IGFs, preventing them from binding to their receptors and stimulating cell proliferation and survival. IGF-independent actions have also been described for IGFBP-3. The degradation of IGFBP-3 by KLK2 or other proteases in the prostate may promote the growth of prostate cancer. We studied IGFBP-3 degradation by immunoblotting and two specific immunoassays, one recognizing only native non-fragmented IGFBP-3 and the other one recognizing both intact and proteolytically cleaved IGFBP-3. Peptides were used to inhibit the enzyme activity of KLK2 and cleavage sites in IGFBP-3 were identified by mass spectrometry. KLK2 proteolyzed IGFBP-3 into several small fragments, mostly after Arg residues, in keeping with the trypsin-like activity of KLK2. The fragmentation could be inhibited by KLK2-inhibiting peptides in a dose-dependent fashion.

The aim of the present study was to generate polyclonal antibodies (pAb) directed against KLK4 for the analysis of KLK4 by immunohistochemistry in human tissues. Recombinantly expressed human mature KLK4 was used for immunization of chickens. pAb 617A is an affinity-purified monospecific pAb fraction reacting with a linear epitope within a flexible surface-exposed loop of KLK4. pAb 617C is the KLK-directed pAb fraction completely depleted from pAb 617A. In healthy adult tissues, KLK4 was immunodetected by both antibody fractions in kidney, liver, and prostate, but not in other organs such as colon and lung. To evaluate protein expression of KLK4 in prostate cancer, samples of tumor tissue plus corresponding tumor-free areas of 44 prostate cancer patients, represented on a tissue microarray, were investigated. Distinct KLK4 immunostaining was observed with both antibodies in cancerous glandular epithelial cells, but not in surrounding stromal cells. KLK4 expression was lower in stage pT3+4 than in pT1+2 tumors, which was highly significant when employing pAb 617A.
