That end-of-life care would be aggressive, more so than recommended by quality-of-care guidelines, was hypothesized.  Methods:   Included in the study were all 60 low-income, uninsured men in a state-funded public assistance program who had died since its inception in 2001. To measure quality of end-of-life care, information was collected regarding timing of the institution of new chemotherapeutic regimens, time from administration of last chemotherapy dose to death, the number of inpatient admissions and intensive care unit stays made in the 3 months preceding death, and the number of emergency room visits made in the 12 months before dying. Also noted were hospice use and the timing of hospice referrals.  Results:   Eighteen men (30%) enrolled in hospice before death and the average hospice stay lasted 45 days (standard deviation, 32; range, 2-143 days; median, 41 days). Two patients (11%) were enrolled for fewer than 7 days, and none were enrolled for more than 180 days. The average time from administration of the last dose of chemotherapy to death was 104 days. Chemotherapy was never initiated within 3 months of death, and in only 2 instances (6%) was the final chemotherapeutic regimen administered within 2 weeks of dying. Use of hospital resources (emergency room visits, inpatient admissions, and intensive care unit stays) was uniformly low (mean, 1.0 +/- 1.0, 0.65 +/- 0.82, and 0.03 +/- 0.18, respectively).  Conclusions:   End-of-life care in disadvantaged men dying of prostate cancer, who enroll in a comprehensive statewide assistance program, is high-quality.""","""['Jonathan Bergman', 'Amanda C Chi', 'Mark S Litwin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Hospice and emergency room use by disadvantaged men dying of prostate cancer.', 'End-of-life care for older cancer patients in the Veterans Health Administration versus the private sector.', 'Determinants of treatment regret in low-income, uninsured men with prostate cancer.', 'Identifying potential indicators of the quality of end-of-life cancer care from administrative data.', 'Prostate cancer survivorship: lessons from caring for the uninsured.', 'The end of life experiences of people living with socio-economic deprivation in the developed world: an integrative review.', 'Conceptualizing and Counting Discretionary Utilization in the Final 100\xa0Days of Life: A Scoping Review.', 'Social Inequalities in Palliative Care for Cancer Patients in the United States: A Structured Review.', 'Measuring intensity of end of life care: a systematic review.', 'An examination of end-of-life care in a safety net hospital system: a decade in review.']"""

Results:   Factor analysis allowed the extraction of five patterns, labeled as prudent, traditional, substituter, drinker, and Western. Whereas the traditional and Western patterns were directly associated with risk of prostate cancer (OR for high quartile versus the low quartile of the Western diet was 2.35, 95% CI 1.44-3.85, p-value for trend < 0.0001), the prudent, drinker, and substituter patterns were not associated with risk of the disease.

The human tumor suppressor gene DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1) is frequently downregulated or silenced in multiple cancers, predominantly by epigenetic mechanisms. With the current considerable interest and progress in epigenetic therapy, a number of promising antineoplastic agents, particularly histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, have been developed and used successfully in clinical trials. Both DLC1 and HDAC inhibitors exert antineoplastic functions, and their combined action could be exploited for a more effective cancer therapy. To evaluate the potential benefits of this approach, we examined the antineoplastic effects of adenoviral (Ad)-DLC1-mediated transduction and exposure to suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a powerful HDAC inhibitor, in two human cancer cell lines that lack intrinsic DLC1 expression, 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells and 7703K human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Consistent with the oncosuppressive function of DLC1 in several cancers, including prostate and liver cancer, transduction of 22Rv1 and 7703K cells with an Ad-DLC1 expression vector resulted in alterations of cell morphology, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent growth. A low concentration of SAHA (5 microM) efficiently restored the expression of DLC1 in 22Rv1 cells that lack DLC1 expression due to histone deacetylation but had a minimal effect in 7703K cells in which silencing of the DLC1 gene is due mainly to promoter hypermethylation. Regardless of the epigenetic mechanism of DLC1 inactivation, SAHA treatment of DLC1-transduced cells had a synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in both cell lines. In 22Rv1 cells, this combination regimen nearly abolished the formation of colonies in semisolid media as a measure of tumorigenicity in vitro. Current in vitro results validate this protocol as a potentially new therapeutic option in certain cancers.""","""['Xiaoling Zhou', 'Xu-Yu Yang', 'Nicholas C Popescu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Preclinical evaluation of combined antineoplastic effect of DLC1 tumor suppressor protein and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid on prostate cancer cells.', 'Adenovirus-mediated restoration of expression of the tumor suppressor gene DLC1 inhibits the proliferation and tumorigenicity of aggressive, androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines: prospects for gene therapy.', 'Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid increases anti-cancer effect of tumor necrosis factor-α through up-regulation of TNF receptor 1 in lung cancer cells.', 'HDAC as a therapeutic target for treatment of endometrial cancers.', 'A tumor suppressor DLC1: The functions and signal pathways.', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors, Intrinsic and Extrinsic Apoptotic Pathways, and Epigenetic Alterations of Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Hybrid Enzalutamide Derivatives with Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Activity Decrease Heat Shock Protein 90 and Androgen Receptor Levels and Inhibit Viability in Enzalutamide-Resistant C4-2 Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Role of DLC1 tumor suppressor gene and MYC oncogene in pathogenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma: potential prospects for combined targeted therapeutics (review).', 'DLC1 interaction with α-catenin stabilizes adherens junctions and enhances DLC1 antioncogenic activity.', 'Preclinical evaluation of combined antineoplastic effect of DLC1 tumor suppressor protein and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid on prostate cancer cells.']"""

We have reported previously pro-apoptotic effects induced in vitro by ISP in the human HCT-116 colon cancer cell line, a model that displays relative sensitivity to apoptosis. In the present study, we observed that the in vitro growth inhibitory activities of ISP are similar in cancer cells that display sensitivity versus resistance to apoptosis. We made use of the U373 glioblastoma and the A549 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines as models relatively resistant to apoptosis, and the human PC-3 prostate cancer cell line as a model relatively sensitive to apoptosis. While ISP induced transient decreases in [ATP]i and apoptosis in human U373 GBM cells, it did not provoke such features in A549 NSCLC cells. It thus seems that ISP-induced anti-cancer activity can lead to pro-apoptotic effects as a consequence, while apoptosis seems not to be the main cause by which ISP induces cancer cell death.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a validated biomarker for prostate cancer, has attracted considerable attention as a target for imaging and therapeutic applications for prostate cancer. The present study focuses on the investigation of a PSMA inhibitor-conjugate of pyropheophorbide-a (Ppa-conjugate 2.1) for a targeted PDT application and the mechanism of its mediated-cell death in prostate cancer cells. Multiple fluorescence labeling methods were employed to monitor PDT-treated prostate cancer cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Our results demonstrate that Ppa-conjugate 2.1 mediated apoptosis is specific to PSMA+ (positive) LNCaP cells, but not PSMA- (negative) PC-3 cells. Furthermore, these results indicate that following PDT, the activation of caspase-8, -3, -9, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and DNA fragmentation is sequential. The appearance of cleaved beta-actin further supported involvement of caspase-3. Specific caspase inhibitor blocking studies reveal that the caspase-8/-3 cascade pathway plays a key role in apoptosis of LNCaP cells induced by Ppa-conjugate 2.1. The demonstrated selective targeting and efficacy of this agent suggests that targeted PDT could serve as an alternative treatment option for prostate cancer.""","""['Tiancheng Liu', 'Lisa Y Wu', 'Joseph K Choi', 'Clifford E Berkman']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['In vitro targeted photodynamic therapy with a pyropheophorbide--a conjugated inhibitor of prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Etk/Bmx, a PH-domain containing tyrosine kinase, protects prostate cancer cells from apoptosis induced by photodynamic therapy or thapsigargin.', 'Photodynamic therapy of Pheophorbide a inhibits the proliferation of human breast tumour via both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways in in vitro and in vivo models.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer - A narrative review.', 'Ready player one?

Methods:   A questionnaire was sent to PET performing facilities (medical practices, hospitals, university hospitals and others) for retrospective data acquisition. Details regarding the equipment and examination procedures were examined as well as indications and number of studies. In addition, the role of PET within the diagnostic process was evaluated.  Results:   Responses from 65 sites were analysed. Their technical equipment consisted of 77 PET scanners (40 of them were combined PET/CT devices). About 63500 PET studies had been performed with 86% in the field of oncology, 8% in neurology and 3% in cardiology. The radiotracers were labelled with 18F in 91% of the studies, whereas 68Ga was used in 4% and 11C in 3%. The analyses revealed lung tumours as the most investigated tumour entity, followed by malignant lymphoma, tumours of the gastro-intestinal tract and prostate cancer (about 14000, 6000, 5000 and 2000). Corresponding to the new scanners and software procedures, the number of studies with attenuation correction by CT was high (68%) and nearly all studies were reconstructed iteratively (99%). The PET images were analysed quantitatively in the majority of cases (91%). The clinical reports, which included image documentation for the greater part, were posted regularly within 3 days. However, in 70% of the sites electronic transfer possibilities were used additionally to speed up the diagnostic process. The high standard of quality was demonstrated by the fact, that 40 facilities were engaged in a tumour board. Further on, one third of the physicians had gained a PET certification awarded by the DGN.  Conclusion:   Relative to the high general standard of diagnostic instrumentation in Germany, PET is less established, in particular when compared with other industrialised countries such as USA and Switzerland.""","""['J Kotzerke', 'L Oehme', 'O Lindner', 'D Hellwig;Arbeitsausschuss PET der DGN']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Nuklearmedizin""","""['Positron emission tomography 2013 in Germany.

Oncogene-induced senescence is thought to be invariably preceded by hyperproliferation, aberrant replication, and activation of a DNA damage checkpoint response (DDR), rendering therapeutic enhancement of this process unsuitable for cancer treatment. We previously demonstrated in a mouse model of prostate cancer that inactivation of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (Pten) elicits a senescence response that opposes tumorigenesis. Here, we show that Pten-loss-induced cellular senescence (PICS) represents a senescence response that is distinct from oncogene-induced senescence and can be targeted for cancer therapy. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we determined that PICS occurs rapidly after Pten inactivation, in the absence of cellular proliferation and DDR. Further, we found that PICS is associated with enhanced p53 translation. Consistent with these data, we showed that in mice p53-stabilizing drugs potentiated PICS and its tumor suppressive potential. Importantly, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of PTEN drives senescence and inhibits tumorigenesis in vivo in a human xenograft model of prostate cancer.

Two issues arise when incorporating T2-w images in a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system: T2-w values are position as well as sequence dependent and images can be misaligned due to patient movement during the acquisition. A method was developed that computes T2 estimates from a T2-w and proton density value and a known sequence model. A mutual information registration strategy was implemented to correct for patient movement. Global motion is modelled by an affine transformation, while local motion is described by a volume preserving non-rigid deformation based on B-splines. The additional value to the discriminating performance of a DCE T1-w-based CADx system was evaluated using bootstrapped ROC analysis. T2 estimates were successfully computed in 29 patients. T2 values were extracted and added to the CADx system from 39 malignant, 19 benign and 29 normal annotated regions. T2 values alone achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.85 (0.77-0.92) and showed a significantly improved discriminating performance of 0.89 (0.81-0.95), when combined with DCE T1-w features. In conclusion, the study demonstrated a simple T2 estimation method that has a diagnostic performance such that it complements a DCE T1-w-based CADx system in discriminating malignant lesions from normal and benign regions.

Although its overexpression confers resistance to androgen ablation and chemotherapy, the mechanisms by which Hsp27 inhibits treatment-induced apoptosis are incompletely defined. Castrate-resistance often correlates with increased activity of autocrine and/or paracrine growth/survival stimulatory loops including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis components. Because Hsp27 can be activated by both MAPK and Akt pathways, it is possible that interactions between IGF-I signaling and Hsp27 phosphoactivation function to promote castrate-resistant progression. Here, we report that Hsp27 expression and phosphorylation levels correlate with IGF-I signaling and castrate-resistant progression in human prostate cancer specimens and cell lines. IGF-I induces Hsp27 phosphorylation in a time- and dose-dependent manner via p90Rsk, which interacts directly with and phosphorylates Hsp27 in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, p90Rsk inhibition using short interfering RNA or a dominant negative mutant abolishes IGF-I-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation. Hsp27 overexpression increases IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of Erk, p90Rsk, and Akt. Conversely, Hsp27 knockdown abrogates IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of Erk, p90Rsk, and Akt, thereby destabilizing Bad/14-3-3 complexes and increasing apoptotic rates.

Objective:   A decision-analytic model was created to explore economic benefits from a third-party payer perspective of the use of 5ARIs in preventing PCa in men with different risk factors for developing the disease.  Methods:   A Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of men annually through health states (e.g. healthy male, benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH], PCa, PCa recurrence) over a man's lifetime. Men with risk factors were treated with a 5ARI and compared with patients given no chemoprevention. Men from the general population were examined along with higher-risk men who had been referred to a PCa centre. Baseline risk was estimated via published risk data, risk factor analyses and risk equations. Clinical efficacy, morality, costs and utilities were obtained from published literature. Outcomes of the model included number of prostate cancers, incremental costs, incremental QALYs, incremental cost per QALY and number needed to treat. Along with sensitivity and scenario analyses, a validation of outcomes was performed. All costs were valued in $US, year 2009 values. Costs were discounted at 3% per annum.  Results:   Men receiving 5ARIs benefited through a reduction in the number of PCas. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of $US50 000 per QALY, chemoprevention with 5ARIs was cost effective ($US37 900 per QALY) in men from the general population who were aged 50 years with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and who were aged 50 years with PCa family history and elevated PSA ($US31 065 per QALY). Chemoprevention with 5ARIs was not cost effective in men aged 50 years with no additional risk factors, men aged 50 years with abnormal digital rectal examinations (DREs), and men aged 50 years with a family history ($US86 511, $US85 577 and $US84 950 per QALY, respectively). In higher-risk men, chemoprevention could be expected to be cost effective ($US18 490 to $US11 816 per QALY, depending on risk scenario). Results were sensitive to changes in utilities, assumed PCa risk reduction with 5ARIs, and patient age.  Conclusion:   When considering common risk factors associated with PCa, prevention with 5ARIs is expected to be cost effective in 50-year-old men with elevated PSA.

Objectives:   The study aim was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale (GBMMS) in a Black male sample.  Design:   Data were collected as part of a randomized controlled trial testing educational strategies to support Black men's decisions about prostate cancer screening.  Participants:   Participants included 201 Black men ages 40-75 years recruited in New York City during 2006-2007.  Main measures:   The primary measures included: race-based medical mistrust, health care participation, avoidance of health care, perceived access to health care, health care satisfaction, racial identity, residential racial segregation, attitudes towards prostate cancer screening, and past prostate cancer screening behavior.  Key results:   An exploratory factor analysis suggested a three-factor structure. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-factor model. Internal consistency was high for the total GBMMS and the three sub-scales: Suspicion, Discrimination, and Lack of Support. Construct validity was supported by: significant positive correlations between GBMMS and avoidance of health care and racial identity as well as significant negative correlations with health care access, health care satisfaction, and attitudes about prostate cancer screening. ANOVA showed that the GBMMS was associated with greater residential racial segregation. Higher total GBMMS scores were associated with not visiting a physician in the last year and not having a regular physician.

Several studies have shown that miRNAs modulate gene expression in mammalian cells by base pairing to complementary sites in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the target mRNAs.  Methodology/principal findings:   In the present study, miR-24 was found to target fas associated factor 1(FAF1) by binding to its amino acid coding sequence (CDS) region, thereby regulating apoptosis in DU-145 cells. This result supports an augmented model whereby animal miRNAs can exercise their effects through binding to the CDS region of the target mRNA. Transfection of miR-24 antisense oligonucleotide (miR-24-ASO) also induced apoptosis in HGC-27, MGC-803 and HeLa cells.  Conclusions/significance:   We found that miR-24 regulates apoptosis by targeting FAF1 in cancer cells.

However, prior studies have not determined precisely when, and in which cell types, MYC is induced. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to localize MYC expression in Lo-MYC transgenic mice, we show that morphological and molecular alterations characteristic of high grade PIN arise in luminal epithelial cells as soon as MYC overexpression is detected. These changes include increased nuclear and nucleolar size and large scale chromatin remodeling. Mouse PIN cells retained a columnar architecture and abundant cytoplasm and appeared as either a single layer of neoplastic cells or as pseudo-stratified/multilayered structures with open glandular lumina-features highly analogous to human high grade PIN. Also using IHC, we show that the onset of MYC overexpression and PIN development coincided precisely with decreased expression of the homeodomain transcription factor and tumor suppressor, Nkx3.1. Virtually all normal appearing prostate luminal cells expressed high levels of Nkx3.1, but all cells expressing MYC in PIN lesions showed marked reductions in Nkx3.1, implicating MYC as a key factor that represses Nkx3.1 in PIN lesions. To determine the effects of less pronounced overexpression of MYC we generated a new line of mice expressing MYC in the prostate under the transcriptional control of the mouse Nkx3.1 control region. These ""Super-Lo-MYC"" mice also developed PIN, albeit a less aggressive form. We also identified a histologically defined intermediate step in the progression of mouse PIN into invasive adenocarcinoma. These lesions are characterized by a loss of cell polarity, multi-layering, and cribriform formation, and by a ""paradoxical"" increase in Nkx3.1 protein. Similar histopathological changes occurred in Hi-MYC mice, albeit with accelerated kinetics. Our results using IHC provide novel insights that support the contention that MYC overexpression is sufficient to transform prostate luminal epithelial cells into PIN cells in vivo.

These cells express several antiviral restriction factors that are capable of inhibiting the replication of a wide range of retroviruses, including other gamma retroviruses. This raises the possibility that, similar to HIV, XMRV may have acquired resistance to restriction. We therefore investigated the susceptibility of XMRV to a panel of different restriction factors. We found that both human APOBEC3 and tetherin proteins are able to block XMRV replication. Expression of human TRIM5alpha, however, had no effect on viral infectivity. There was no evidence that XMRV expressed countermeasures to overcome restriction. In addition, the virus was inhibited by factors from nonhuman species, including mouse Apobec3, tetherin, and Fv1 proteins.

There are many reports on the effect of rapamycin (RPM) on the treatment of carcinogenesis. The goal of this study was to test whether RPM could enhance the susceptibility of both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate carcinoma cells to DOC.  Methods:   Prostate cancer (PC) cell lines (LNCap, PC3 and AILNCap) were cultured and treated with RPM and DOC alone or in combination. The effects of therapeutic agents on cells were determined by the WST-1 assay. Apoptosis induction was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. The apopcyto caspase colorimetric assay kit was applied to measure the activities of caspases 3 and 9. The antitumor effects of RPM and DOC against PC cells were also assessed in nude mice using four randomized groups: control, RPM, DOC and combination drug therapy by measuring tumor size. All the animals tolerated both RPM and DOC without significant weight loss.  Results:   RPM and DOC caused dosage-dependent growth suppression of PC cells. RPM could increase the susceptibility of PC cells to DOC significantly, and combined treatment with RPM and DOC caused synergistic growth suppression in all examined PC cell lines by isobolographic analysis. Both RPM and DOC significantly induced apoptosis in a dosage-dependent manner. RPM (10 nmol/L), DOC (1 nmol/L), and combined treatment induced apoptosis rate were 8%, 17% and 38%, respectively (the control was 2%). RPM could promote the apoptosis induced by DOC in PC cell lines. Both RPM and DOC significantly increased the caspase activity in a dosage-dependent manner. The relative activities of caspase 9 in control, RPM, DOC and RPM + DOC groups were 0.22 +/- 0.02, 0.36 +/- 0.06, 0.47 +/- 0.05 and 0.84 +/- 0.08, respectively. The relative activities of caspase 3 were 0.21 +/- 0.02, 0.24 +/- 0.05, 0.42 +/- 0.06 and 0.81 +/- 0.09, respectively. Either RPM or DOC alone significantly inhibited the growth of PC cells in nude mice compared to the control. The combination of RPM and DOC produced a significant reduction in tumor volume when compared to RPM or DOC alone. After 5-week treatment, the tumor sizes of LNCap in control, RPM, DOC and RPM + DOC groups were (570 +/- 56) mm(3), (412 +/- 41) mm(3), (425 +/- 46) mm(3) and (221 +/- 26) mm(3), respectively.  Conclusions:   RPM could significantly increase the susceptibility of both androgen-dependent and -independent PC cells to DOC; the synergy of RPM and DOC was demonstrated. RPM enhanced the DOC-induced upregulation of caspase activity, resulting in an increasing number of cells in sub-G1 phases. The synergy of the combined treatment might be observed in both androgen-dependent and -independent PC cell lines.""","""['Qing-jun Liu', 'Xiu-hong Xu', 'Dong-hao Shang', 'Ye Tian', 'Wen-cheng Lü', 'Yu-hai Zhang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Chin Med J (Engl)""","""['Nitroxide tempo, a small molecule, induces apoptosis in prostate carcinoma cells and suppresses tumor growth in athymic mice.', 'Low dose combinations of 2-methoxyestradiol and docetaxel block prostate cancer cells in mitosis and increase apoptosis.', 'Rapamycin enhances docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity in a androgen-independent prostate cancer xenograft model by survivin downregulation.', 'Genistein combined polysaccharide enhances activity of docetaxel, bicalutamide and Src kinase inhibition in androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Human xenograft models as useful tools to assess the potential of novel therapeutics in prostate cancer.', 'Remarkable inhibition of mTOR signaling by the combination of rapamycin and 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)selenocyanate in human prostate cancer cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   Data from 1340 consecutive patients undergoing RALP from one institution were analysed and trends for positive posterolateral SM+ (PLSM+) were correlated with oncological variables before and after RALP. A sample of patient slides were reviewed by a extramural pathologist. Multivariate regression modelling was used to compare the projected rates of PLSM+ vs the actual rate, given the effect of a conscious effort to use visual cues. Finally, video recordings of the procedure were systematically reviewed and correlated with anatomical and histopathological images in an integrated session involving the surgeon and the pathology team.  Results:   The incidence of PLSM+ was 2.1%, which gradually declined to 1.0% in the last 100 patients. The reduction in PLSM+ occurred despite an increased rate of high-risk tumours operated on during this period. Forecasting analysis showed that the actual PLSM+ rate declined by half in the most recent 1000 patients, due to an integrated effort involving the use of visual cues during surgery. The following visual cues were considered important; appreciation of periprostatic (lateral prostatic) fascial compartments; colour and texture of the tissue; periprostatic veins as a landmark for athermal dissection; signs of inflammation; and a freely separating bloodless plane showing loose shiny areolar tissue.  Conclusion:   Adapting to the robotic platform is easy and there is no compromise of the oncological safety of this procedure. Experienced surgeons can use visual cues to assist during nerve-sparing RALP and achieve low PLSM+ rates.""","""['Ashutosh K Tewari', 'Nishant D Patel', 'Robert A Leung', 'Rajiv Yadav', 'E Darracott Vaughan', 'Youssef El-Douaihy', 'Jiangling J Tu', 'Muhul B Amin', 'Mohammed Akhtar', 'Mark Burns', 'Usha Kreaden', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Atsushi Takenaka', 'Maria M Shevchuk']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Should experienced open prostatic surgeons convert to robotic surgery?

Group 1 received periprostatic local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, group 2 received Voltaren supp placed in rectum an hour before biopsy while group 3 received no local anesthesia. Pain scale responses were analyzed for each aspect of the biopsy procedure with a visual analog scale of 0-none to 10-maximal. There was no difference between the 3 groups in pain scores during digital rectal examination, intrarectal injection and probe insertion. The mean pain scores during needle insertion in group 1 receiving periprostatic nerve block and in group 2 receiving Voltaren supp were 3,10 +/- 2,32 and 5,15 +/- 2,01 respectively.

The reason for this association is unclear. We have previously shown that cadherin-11 (also known as OB-cadherin), a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that mediates osteoblast adhesion, plays a role in the metastasis of PCa to bone. Here, we report that androgen-deprivation therapy up-regulates cadherin-11 expression in PCa. In human PCa specimens, immunohistochemical staining showed that 22/26 (85%) primary PCa tumours from men with castration-resistant PCa expressed cadherin-11. In contrast, only 7/50 (14%) androgen-dependent PCa tumours expressed cadherin-11. In the MDA-PCa-2b xenograft animal model, cadherin-11 was expressed in the recurrent tumours following castration. In the PCa cell lines, there is an inverse correlation between expression of cadherin-11 and androgen receptor (AR), and cadherin-11 is expressed in very low levels or not expressed in AR-positive cell lines, including LNCaP, C4-2B4 and VCaP cells. We showed that AR likely regulates cadherin-11 expression in PCa through an indirect mechanism. Although re-expression of AR in the AR-negative PC3 cells led to the inhibition of cadherin-11 expression, depletion of androgen from the culture medium or down-regulation of AR by RNA interference in the C4-2B4 cells or VCaP cells only produced a modest increase of cadherin-11 expression. Promoter analysis indicated that cadherin-11 promoter does not contain a typical AR-binding element, and AR elicits a modest inhibition of cadherin-11 promoter activity, suggesting that AR does not regulate cadherin-11 expression directly. Together, these results suggest that androgen deprivation up-regulates cadherin-11 expression in prostate cancer, and this may contribute to the metastasis of PCa to bone. Our study suggests that therapeutic strategies that block cadherin-11 expression or function may be considered when applying androgen-ablation therapy.""","""['Yu-Chen Lee', 'Chien-Jui Cheng', 'Miao Huang', 'Mehmet A Bilen', 'Xiangcang Ye', 'Nora M Navone', 'Khoi Chu', 'Hsin-Hsin Kao', 'Li-Yuan Yu-Lee', 'Zhengxin Wang', 'Sue-Hwa Lin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['Enhanced androgen receptor signaling correlates with the androgen-refractory growth in a newly established MDA PCa 2b-hr human prostate cancer cell subline.', 'N-cadherin increases after androgen deprivation and is associated with metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'A novel androgen receptor splice variant is up-regulated during prostate cancer progression and promotes androgen depletion-resistant growth.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Research progress in the role and mechanism of Cadherin-11 in different diseases.', 'T-cadherin in prostate cancer: relationship with cancer progression, differentiation and drug resistance.', 'Anoikis and EMT: Lethal ""Liaisons"" during Cancer Progression.', 'Cadherin-11 endocytosis through binding to clathrin promotes cadherin-11-mediated migration in prostate cancer cells.', 'Cadherin-11 regulates the metastasis of Ewing sarcoma cells to bone.']"""

Often a proportion of subjects is unexposed. Typical examples are cigarette consumption, alcohol intake, or occupational exposures. The question arises as to how to model such variables statistically. The fractional polynomial method of modelling continuous exposure variables is extended to allow for a proportion unexposed. A binary variable for the unexposed fraction is added to the model. In a two-stage procedure, we assess whether the binary variable and/or the continuous function for the exposed individuals is required for a good fit to the data. Extension to the multivariable situation is described. Three data sets with different characteristics are used as illustrations. The analyses of the three studies using the proposed procedure give differing results. In one example, only the binary variable seems to be required. In the other two examples, the binary variable and fractional polynomial functions of the exposure variable are needed. One function is monotonic and the other has a minimum. In the third example, adjusting for confounders has almost no effect on the function selected.

On the other hand, mutation of p53 is associated with advanced prostate cancer, as well as with metastasis and hormone independence. This study shows that in prostate cell lines in culture, Egr-1 overexpression correlated with an alteration of p53 activity because of the expression of SV40 large T-antigen or because of a mutation in the TP53 gene. In cells containing altered p53 activity, Egr-1 expression was abolished by pharmacological inhibition or RNAi silencing of p53. Although forced expression of wild-type p53 was not sufficient to trigger Egr-1 transcription, four different mutants of p53 were shown to induce Egr-1. Direct binding of p53 to the EGR1 promoter could not be detected. Instead, Egr-1 transcription was driven by the ERK1/2 pathway, as it was abrogated by specific inhibitors of MEK. Egr-1 increased the transcription of HB-EGF (epidermal growth factor), amphiregulin and epiregulin, resulting in autocrine activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and downstream MEK/ERK cascade. Thus, mutant p53 initiates a feedback loop that involves ERK1/2-mediated transactivation of Egr-1, which in turn increases the secretion of EGFR ligands and stimulates the EGFR signaling pathway.

These domains, used as platforms for various signaling molecules, regulate cellular processes including cell survival. Cholesterol contents are tightly correlated with the structure and function of lipid rafts. Liver X receptors (LXRs) have a central role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis within the cell. Therefore, we investigated whether these nuclear receptors could modulate lipid raft signaling and consequently alter prostate cancer (PCa) cell survival. Treatment with the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 downregulated the AKT survival pathway and thus induced apoptosis of LNCaP PCa cells in both xenografted nude mice and cell culture. The decrease in tumor cholesterol content resulted from the upregulation of ABCG1 and the subsequent increase in reverse cholesterol transport. RNA interference experiments showed that these effects were mediated by LXRs. Atomic force microscopy scanning of the inner plasma membrane sheet showed smaller and thinner lipid rafts after LXR stimulation, associated with the downregulation of AKT phosphorylation in these lipid rafts. Replenishment of cell membranes with exogenous cholesterol antagonized these effects, showing that cholesterol is a key modulator in this process.

Genomatix analysis of ANXA7 promoter identified a cluster of steroid nuclear hormone receptor elements, including V$GREF (V$GRE.02/ARE.02). Gelshift analysis clearly indicated distinct nuclear protein occupancy at this ANXA7-promoter site (-1086/-890) in prostate cancer (LNCaP, DU145, and PC3) versus normal prostate (PrEC) cells. In matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based search for ANXA7 nuclear regulators, we identified several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (A1, A2/B1 and K) attached to the steroid-associated ANXA7-promoter site in the androgen-resistant PC3 prostate cancer cells with high ANXA7 gene copy number, but not in PrEC. The hnPNP role in ANXA7 regulation (that was validated by hnRNPA2/B1 antibody interference) resulted in multiple ANXA7 cDNA and protein products in PC3, but not in PrEC.

Materials and methods:   A total of 98 cases of prostate biopsy, comprising 65 cases with prostate adenocarcinoma and 33 cases without adenocarcinoma, were included in this study. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum levels before biopsies were obtained. The number of cores with malignant glands and Gleason scores for each case were determined. Paraffin sections were stained immunohistochemically with 34βE12, keratin 5/6, p63, bcl-2, and AMACR.  Results:   According to staining pattern, extensiveness, and intensity of basal cell markers in benign glands, 34βE12 gave the best results. As negative markers for prostate adenocarcinoma, the best markers were p63 and 34βE12. According to the AUC values in ROC curves for both extensiveness and intensity, the arrangement from the best to the worst was 34βE12, p63, bcl-2, and keratin 5/6. The 34βE12 had the best sensitivity and specificity values (95% and 98%, respectively). Staining extensiveness and intensity of keratin 5/6 in malignant glands, and those of bcl-2 in benign glands had statistically significant positive correlation with serum PSA levels. Even though AMACR is a negative marker for benignity, some of the benign glands also had positive immune reaction with AMACR. However, AMACR positivity was usually focal and weak. Nevertheless, intensively stained subjects were also present. No correlation was present between AMACR and basal cell markers.  Conclusions:   As a result, we suggest that keratin 5/6 and bcl-2 should not be used to identify benign glands in prostate biopsy since they show high positivity in malignant glands and high negativity in benign glands. 34βE12 should be the first choice as a basal cell marker. p63 can be used together with 34βE12, but it may not give additional diagnostic information. When we evaluated the correlation of basal cell markers, we did not find any complementary staining results among basal cell markers. Our study showed that 34βE12 is the most appropriate negative marker to combine with AMACR as a positive marker for the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma.""","""['Cetin Boran', 'Engin Kandirali', 'Fahri Yilmaz', 'Erdinc Serin', 'Mesut Akyol']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (P504S)/34betaE12/p63 triple cocktail stain in prostatic adenocarcinoma after hormonal therapy.', 'Detection of AMACR (P504S), P63 and 34betaE12 cocktail in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Immunohistochemical antibody cocktail staining (p63/HMWCK/AMACR) of ductal adenocarcinoma and Gleason pattern 4 cribriform and noncribriform acinar adenocarcinomas of the prostate.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Discovery and clinical application of a novel prostate cancer marker: alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S).', 'Diagnostic utility of triple antibody (AMACR, HMWCK and P63) stain in prostate neoplasm.', 'Three-dimensional architecture of common benign and precancerous prostate epithelial lesions.', 'Near-infrared fluorescent digital pathology for the automation of disease diagnosis and biomarker assessment.', 'Prognostic histopathological and molecular markers on prostate cancer needle-biopsies: a review.', 'Molecular markers for prostate cancer in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.']"""

In contrast, we frequently perform nerve-sparing in high-risk patients. We analyzed our outcomes in patients with preoperatively high-risk prostate cancer according to the D'Amico risk group classification, and stratified by nerve-sparing status.  Materials and methods:   An institutional database of 1,503 robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomies (RALP) was queried for patients presenting with PSA > 20 ng/ml, Gleason 8 or higher on biopsy, or clinical stage T2c or higher. Interfascial nerve-sparing was performed whenever oncologically feasible. Validated questionnaires were used to assess baseline and postoperative functional outcomes.  Results:   Adequate follow-up was available in 123 high-risk patients. Mean serum PSA was 10.8. Bilateral, unilateral, and non-nerve-sparing was performed on 58%, 15%, and 27%, respectively. On final histopathology, 42% were organ confined; 55 patients had extraprostatic extension, and 35 had seminal vesicle invasion. Positive surgical margins occurred in 31%: 15% focal and 16% extensive. Favorable pathologic outcomes (organ-confined and negative surgical margins) were observed in 40%. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 20%. Nerve-sparing was associated with more favorable pathologic features, possibly due to selection bias. When controlling for adverse pathologic features, nerve-sparing was not associated with higher rates of positive surgical margins or biochemical recurrence. At a median follow-up of 13 months, 78% were continent and 56% were potent. The ""trifecta"" of continence, potency, and freedom from recurrence was achieved in 28 patients (23%).

Objective:   To evaluate the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoforms p2PSA and benign prostatic hyperplasia-associated PSA (BPHA).  Design, setting, and participants:   Our study included 405 serum samples from the Rotterdam arm of the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer and 351 samples from the Urology Department of Innsbruck Medical University.  Measurements:   BPHA, tPSA, fPSA, and p2PSA levels were measured by Beckman-Coulter Access Immunoassay. In addition, the Beckman Coulter Prostate Health Index was calculated: phi=(p2PSA/fPSA)×√(tPSA).  Results and limitations:   The p2PSA and phi levels differed significantly between men with and without PCa. No difference in BPHA levels was observed. The highest PCa predictive value in both cohorts was achieved by phi with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.750 and 0.709, a significant increase compared to tPSA (AUC: 0.585 and 0.534) and %fPSA (AUC: 0.675 and 0.576). Also, %p2PSA (p2PSA/fPSA) showed significantly higher AUCs compared to tPSA and %fPSA (AUC: 0.716 and 0.695, respectively). At 95% and 90% sensitivity, the specificities of phi were 23% and 31% compared to 10% and 8% for tPSA, respectively. In both cohorts, multivariate analysis showed a significant increase in PCa predictive value after addition of p2PSA to a model consisting of tPSA and fPSA (increase in AUC from 0.675 to 0.755 and from 0.581 to 0.697, respectively). Additionally, the specificity at 95% sensitivity increased from 8% to 24% and 7% to 23%, respectively. Furthermore, %p2PSA, phi, and the model consisting of tPSA and fPSA with or without the addition of p2PSA missed the least of the tumours with a biopsy or pathologic Gleason score ≥7 at 95% and 90% sensitivity.

The objectives of this study were to apply an automatic computer algorithm to compute target volumes and to validate the algorithm using histologic data from real human prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Various modalities for prostate imaging were performed. In vivo imaging included T2 3-T magnetic resonance imaging and (11)C-choline PET. Ex vivo imaging included 3-T magnetic resonance imaging, histology, and block face photos of the prostate specimen. A novel registration method based on mutual information and thin-plate splines was applied to all modalities. Once PET is registered with histology, a voxel-by-voxel comparison between PET and histology is possible. A thresholding technique based on various fractions of the maximum standardized uptake value in the tumor was applied, and the respective computed threshold volume on PET was compared with histologic truth.  Results:   Sixteen patients whose primary tumor volumes ranged from 1.2 to 12.6 cm(3) were tested. PET has low spatial resolution, so only tumors > 4 cm(3) were considered. Four cases met this criterion. A threshold value of 60% of the (11)C-choline maximum standardized uptake value resulted in the highest volume overlap between threshold volume on PET and histology. Medial axis distances between threshold volume on PET and histology showed a mean error of 7.7 +/- 5.2 mm.

Materials and methods:   Using a population based cancer registry linked with Medicare claims we identified men 66 years old or older with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2003 to 2005. Outcome measures were general medical/surgical complications and mortality within 90 days after surgery, genitourinary/bowel complications within 365 days, radiation therapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy within 365 days and length of hospital stay.  Results:   Of the 5,923 men 18% underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.

Sixty samples of prostatic tissue, from 60 to 90-year-old patients with and without lesions obtained from autopsied or prostatectomised patients were divided into four groups (15 samples per group): standard group (no lesions), benign prostatic hyper-plasia group, high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia group and prostatic carcinoma group. The samples were submitted to morphometrical, structural and ultrastructural analyses in addition to cellular apoptosis and proliferative analyses. The results showed morphological damages in the stroma and cellular organelles involved in the secretory process of the prostate. Moreover, the prostatic lesions in elderly men demonstrated disturbance in the proliferation/apoptosis rate, indicating a prevalence of the proliferative process. Finally, the imbalance in prostatic stroma-epithelium interaction was a harmful feature in the elderly men as a result of structural changes, which are crucial factors for the development and progression of carcinogenesis.""","""['Amanda C Hetzl', 'Wagner J Favaro', 'Athanase Billis', 'Ubirajara Ferreira', 'Valéria H A Cagnon']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Aging Male""","""['Hormonal therapy in the senescence: Prostatic microenvironment structure and adhesion molecules.', 'Role of canine basal cells in prostatic post natal development, induction of hyperplasia, sex hormone-stimulated growth; and the ductal origin of carcinoma.', 'Role of canine basal cells in postnatal prostatic development, induction of hyperplasia, and sex hormone-stimulated growth; and the ductal origin of carcinoma.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'A theoretical rationale on the histogenesis of premalignant lesions and early carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Lipid associated antioxidants: arylesterase and paraoxonase-1 in benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment-naïve patients.', 'Parental High-Fat Diet Promotes Inflammatory and Senescence-Related Changes in Prostate.']"""

Several factors have shown to be related to prostate cancer such as sociodemographic, lifestyle, diet, occupational exposure, medical and health status. This is the first time a similar study was conducted in Malaysia to recognize the risk factors for prostate cancer patients who came for treatment at University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC).  Methods:   Prostate cancer cases diagnosed between 2003 and 2008 which met with the inclusion criteria were included in the study. One hundred and twelfth (112) pairs of cases and controls matched by age and ethnicity were analysed. McNemar Odds Ratios (OR(M)) were calculated using McNemar Calculator software for univariate analysis while conditional logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis, both using SPSS version 12.0.  Results:   Most of the prostate cancer patients (68.8%) that came for treatment in UKMMC were above 70 years old. The majority were Chinese (50.0%) followed by Malay (46.4%) and Indian (3.6%). Multivariate analysis showed cases were more likely to have a first-degree relative with a history of cancer (OR= 3.77, 95% CI= 1.19-11.85), to have been exposed to pesticides (OR= 5.57, 95% CI= 1.75-17.78) and consumed more meat (OR= 12.23, 95% CI= 3.89-39.01). Significantly reduced risks of prostate cancer were noted among those consuming more vegetables (OR= 0.12, 95% CI= 0.02-0.84), more tomatoes (OR= 0.35, 95% CI= 0.13-0.93) and those who had frequent sexual intercourse (OR= 0.44, 95% CI= 0.19-0.96).  Conclusion:   Some lifestyle and occupation factors are strong predictors of the occurrence of prostate cancer among patients in UKMMC.

The infection efficiency of the virus, however, varies greatly among target cells. In this report, we compared the ability of SIN to infect colorectal cancer cells and cells of other cancer origin. While tumor cells from breast, leukemia, and prostate cancers were largely resistant to SIN infection, nine of the ten colorectal cancer cell lines tested were sensitive to SIN infection. Moreover, SIN susceptibility correlated with the metastatic potential of the colorectal cancer cells. Two highly aggressive and invasive cell lines, SW620 and COLO-320DM were the most sensitive to SIN infection. Similarly, SIN preferentially targeted metastatic tumor cells in a mouse xenograft model for colon cancer progression. The higher infection rate was not due to increased expression of the 67kD laminin receptor, a specific receptor for SIN infection, although viral attachment and entry were markedly enhanced in SW620 cells.

Material and methods:   A diagnostic cohort of 36 patients was included in skeletal scintigraphy and 1.5 T DWIBS MRI. Based on morphology and signal intensity patterns, two readers each identified and classified independently, under blinded conditions, all lesions into three groups: (1) malignant, (2) unclear if malignant or benign and (3) benign. Finally, for the definition of the gold standard all available imaging techniques and follow-up over a minimum of 6 months were considered.  Results:   Overall, 45 circumscribed bone metastases and 107 benign lesions were found. DWIBS performed significantly better in detecting malignant skeletal lesions in patients with more than 10 lesions (sensitivity: 0.97/0.91) compared to skeletal scintigraphy (sensitivity: 0.48/0.42). No statistical difference could be found between DWIBS (0.58/0.33) and skeletal scintigraphy (0.67/0.58) in the sensitivity values for malignant skeletal lesions in patients with less than 5 lesions. For benign lesions, scintigraphy scored best with a sensitivity of 0.93/0.87 compared to 0.20/0.13 for DWIBS. Interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated as 0.784 in the case of scintigraphy and 0.663 for DWIBS.

We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of tumours in acromegalic patients treated at our department: the regional centre for acromegalic patients for the Małopolskie voivodeship in Poland.  Material and methods:   During the years 1983-2008, a hundred and one acromegalic patients (30 males and 71 women), of mean age 51.8 +/- 15.4 years, were diagnosed and treated. Pituitary macroadenoma and microadenoma were stated in 63.4% and 25.7% of these patients, respectively. In 10.9% of these patients no data on tumour diameter were available. The mean observation period was 9.4 +/- 6.5 years. The median levels of hGH and IGF-1 prior to neurosurgery were 20.2 (IQR = 34.9) ng/ml and 764.5 (IQR = 569.6) ng/ml, respectively.  Results:   In the studied group of patients, we found the following prevalence of various tumours: nodular goitre - 64/101 patients (63.0%), polyps of the colon - 13/101 patients (13.0%); uterine polyps - 4/101 patients (4.0%); and prostate adenoma - 2/101 patients (2.0%). Among malignant tumours, thyroid cancer, endometrium and cervix cancer were the most frequent, each of these occurring in 3 patients (3.0%). Colon cancer prevalence was 2.0% (in 2 patients).  Conclusions:   From our retrospective study, we suggest an overall increase of tumour incidence in acromegalic patients. Prospective multicentre studies are required to resolve the significance of this observation. In our study group, the number of malignant neoplasms was significantly higher in patients with long-lasting uncontrolled disease (over 5 years), compared to patients with controlled disease.

Recently, we and others identified high expression of MAOA in normal basal prostatic epithelium and high-grade primary prostate cancer (PCa). In contrast, MAOA is low in normal secretory prostatic epithelium and low-grade PCa. An irreversible inhibitor of MAOA, clorgyline, induced secretory differentiation in primary cultures of normal basal epithelial cells and high-grade PCa. Furthermore, clorgyline inhibited several oncogenic pathways in PCa cells, suggesting clinical value of MAOA inhibitors as a pro-differentiation and anti-oncogenic therapy for high-risk PCa. Here, we extended our studies to a model of advanced PCa, VCaP cells, which were derived from castration-resistant metastatic PCa and express a high level of MAOA.  Methods:   Growth of VCaP cells in the presence or absence of clorgyline was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression changes in response to clorgyline were determined by microarray and validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   Treatment with clorgyline in vitro inhibited growth and altered the transcriptional pattern of VCaP cells in a manner consistent with the pro-differentiation and anti-oncogenic effects seen in treated primary PCa cells. Src, beta-catenin, and MAPK oncogenic pathways, implicated in androgen-independent growth and metastasis, were significantly downregulated. Clorgyline treatment of mice bearing VCaP xenografts slowed tumor growth and induced transcriptome changes similar to those noted in vitro.

To assess if ZNF652 can influence AR expression, or vice versa, levels of expression of ZNF652, AR and PSA were determined in the prostate cell line LNCaP following induction of AR activity by 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, or knockdown of ZNF652 expression. Two thirds of prostate tumors retained high levels of ZNF652 (71/109 cases) and 50% of tumors high levels of AR (57/113). There was a significant decrease (p=0.005) in relapse-free survival of patients with high expression levels of both ZNF652 and AR and this was independent of preoperative PSA and seminal vesicle involvement.

We here showed for the first time, in contrast to the reported promoting action of GPR30 on the growth of breast and ovarian cancer cells, that activation of GPR30 by the receptor-specific, non-estrogenic ligand G-1 inhibited the growth of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer (PCa) cells in vitro and PC-3 xenografts in vivo. However, G-1 elicited no growth or histological changes in the prostates of intact mice and did not inhibit growth in quiescent BPH-1, an immortalized benign prostatic epithelial cell line. Treatment of PC-3 cells with G-1 induced cell-cycle arrest at the G(2) phase and reduced the expression of G(2)-checkpoint regulators (cyclin-A2, cyclin-B1, cdc25c, and cdc2) and phosphorylation of their common transcriptional regulator NF-YA in PC-3 cells. With extensive use of siRNA-knockdown experiments and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 in this study, we dissected the mechanism underlying G-1-induced inhibition of PC-3 cell growth, which was mediated through GPR30, followed by sustained activation of Erk1/2 and a c-jun/c-fos-dependent upregulation of p21, resulting in the arrest of PC-3 growth at the G(2) phase.

Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between the diabetes risk scores and PCa risk.  Results:   Both T2D risk scores, but neither T1D score, showed an inverse association with PCa (p < 0.01). These associations remained significant after excluding HNF1B SNP rs4430796 (a known PCa risk factor) from the analysis.

Here we studied the AR-PI3K pathway crosstalk in prostate cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo.  Methods:   Quantitative PCR, Western analysis, reporter assays, and proliferation analyses in vitro and in vivo were used to evaluate the effect of PI3K pathway inhibition on AR signaling and cell growth.  Results:   Transcriptional activity of AR was increased when the PI3K pathway was inhibited at different levels. In the androgen responsive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, androgen and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin synergistically activated androgen target genes. Despite increased androgen signaling, rapamycin treatment reduced LNCaP cell growth; the AR antagonist bicalutamide potentiated this effect. Furthermore, the rapamycin derivative CCI-779 reduced the growth of CWR22 prostate cancer xenografts while increasing AR target gene expression.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that inhibition of the PI3K pathway activates AR signaling. Despite the increase in AR signaling which has proliferative effects, the result of PI3K pathway inhibition is antiproliferative.

However, the interrelation of these two kinases has been largely unexplored. In the present study, we show that androgen-induced activation of cSrc regulates the activity of aPKC through the small molecular weight G protein Rac1 in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Knockdown of cSrc in those cells reduces the phosphorylation of aPKC and the abundance of activated form of Rac1. Additionally, the treatment of those cells with Rac1 inhibitor repressed cell cycle progression at G(1)/S transition. In fact, forced expression of a constitutively active Rac1 mutant in LNCaP cells promoted cell proliferation under androgen-depleted conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, LNCaP C4-2 and AILNCaP cells, the syngeneic androgen-independent sublines from LNCaP cells, harbored abundant Rac1-GTP. Importantly, the inhibition of Rac1 suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death in all prostate cancer cell lines tested irrespective of their androgen-dependence. In immunohistochemical evaluation of tumor specimens from prostate cancer patients, Rac1 pathway appeared to be activated in the majority of castrate-resistant diseases.

In this work we show that a weak base derivative of docetaxel can be actively loaded into LNP using pH gradient loading techniques to achieve stable drug encapsulation and controlled release properties. Docetaxel was derivatized at the hydroxyl group in the C-2' position to form an N-methyl-piperazinyl butanoic acid ester. The free hydroxyl group in this position is essential for anticancer activity and the prodrug has, therefore, to be converted into the parent drug (docetaxel) to restore activity. Cytotoxicity testing against a panel of cancer cell lines (breast, prostate and ovarian cancer) demonstrated that the prodrug is readily converted into active drug; the derivative was found to be as active as the parent drug in vitro. The docetaxel derivative can be efficiently loaded at high drug-to-lipid ratios (up to 0.4 mg/mg) into LNP using pH loading techniques. Pharmacokinetic, tolerability and efficacy studies in mice demonstrate that the LNP-encapsulated prodrug has the long drug circulation half-life required for efficient tumor accumulation (50-100 times higher drug plasma levels compared with free derivative and Taxotere, the commercial docetaxel formulation), is active in a xenograft model of breast cancer (MDA-MB-435/LCC6), and is well tolerated at i.v. doses of 3 times higher than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the parent drug.

Methods:   Our study population consisted of 16 patients with CRPC who were treated with flutamide (375 mg daily) as second-line hormonal therapy. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, androstenediol, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were measured to investigate the relationship between plasma androgens and outcome following treatment. Furthermore, adrenal androgen levels in a medium of adrenal cancer cell line were also measured.  Results:   Second-line hormonal therapy using flutamide resulted in a reduction of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in 14 (87.5%) of 16 patients. A PSA decline greater than 50% was observed in 8 (50%) of the 16 patients. The duration of median responsiveness was 6.25 months. PSA elevation of baseline androstenediol level was a predictive factor of PSA responsiveness. The lower DHEA group improved the duration of responsiveness to flutamide. In vitro, 3 micromol/L flutamide suppressed DHEA, androstenedione and androstenediol synthesis compared with bicalutamide in a medium of adrenal cancer cell line.  Conclusions:   Our data show that flutamide suppresses the adrenal androgens in comparison with bicalutamide.

Patients and methods:   We postulated that a 10% increase in the proportion of men who regained continence at 6 months with PG-PFME compared with men treated with F-PFME only would constitute a clinically relevant effect. To show statistical significance of this difference with a power of 80%, 96 men should be randomized to each of the two arms. One day before operation, all patients received verbal instruction and an information folder on PFME. Patients randomized to the F-PFME arm received no further physiotherapist guidance, whereas those in the PG-PFME arm received a maximum of nine sessions with the physiotherapist. The men underwent a 1-h pad-test at 1, 12 and 26 weeks, and a 24-h pad-test at 1, 4, 8, 12 and 26 weeks after catheter removal. We defined 'continence' as urine loss of <1 g at the 1-h and <4 g at the 24-h pad-test.  Results:   During the 2-year recruitment period, the number of patients randomized fell short of the target determined by the sample size calculation, because of limitations of resources and unexpected changes in treatment preferences. Despite this, we analysed the data. Of the 82 randomized patients, 70 completed the study. Of these, 34 and 36 men had been assigned to the PG-PFME and the F-PFME group, respectively. At 6 months after RRP, 10 (30%) and nine (27%) men were completely dry on both the 1-h and 24-h pad-test in the PG-PFME and the F-PFME group, respectively (difference not significant). In a multivariate analysis the amount of urine loss at 1 week after catheter removal seemed to be an independent prognostic factor for failure to regain continence.  Conclusion:   PG-PFME seems to have no beneficial effect on the recovery of continence within the first 6 months after RRP, over an instruction folder-guided approach. However, due to under-powering there is a high risk of type II error.

Patients and methods:   We identified 38 patients who had a radical prostatectomy for Gleason 7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Half progressed to metastatic disease and half had no evidence of disease after treatment. Patients were matched for preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, surgical margin status, pathological stage, tumour volume, age at surgery, year of surgery and DNA ploidy. Sequential 5 microm sections were obtained from paraffin-embedded tissue and one genitourinary pathologist selected areas of tumour for study. Principal component analysis was used to investigate the correlation between spectral response and clinical outcome.  Results:   The analysis was able to distinguish between those with progressive disease and those with no evidence of disease, most notably within the Gleason 3 regions when evaluating the epithelium and stroma as separate histological elements. A two-sample t-test gave P < 0.01 for both the Gleason 3 and 4 epithelium and stroma classes.  Conclusions:   RMI is a novel technique that shows promise for identifying patients at risk of progression by visualizing molecular information not seen using other current methods.

Materials and methods:   The five SSTRs (SSTR1-5) were evaluated in 'normal-looking' epithelium (NEp), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and pT2a Gleason score 6 adenocarcinoma in 20 CyP specimens with incidental prostate cancer and 20 radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens with clinically detected prostate cancer.  Results:   For cytoplasm expression, the mean percentage of positive secretory cells with strong cytoplasmic staining increased from NEp to HGPIN and prostate cancer, being slightly lower in the CyP than in the RP specimens. Both in the CyP and RP specimens SSTR4 was found in the highest percentage of cells. There was membrane staining in the secretory cells for SSTR3 and SSTR4. There was nuclear staining in the secretory cells for SSTR4 and SSTR5. For SSTR1 and SSTR3 the mean proportions of positive basal cells were higher than for the other three subtypes, and greater in NEp than in HGPIN. There were positive smooth muscle and endothelial cells for all five SSTR subtypes, the highest proportions being SSTR1 and the lowest SSTR5.  Conclusions:   This immunohistochemical study expands our knowledge of the expression and localization of SSTRs in the various tissue components in the prostate with incidental cancer, compared with clinically detected cancer.

In this work, linear and star-shape PGMAs were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization and then functionalized with four different amines by ring-opening addition. This resulted in the formation of polyglycerol-like polymers having both hydroxyl and amine moieties and different water-solubility. The water-insoluble polymers could form pH-sensitive nanoassemblies, while the soluble derivatives efficiently complexed a short strand polynucleotide. The aminated polyglycerol interacted more avidly with the oligonucleotide than the control poly(ethyleneimine), and high transfection efficacy could be obtained with the linear derivative.

We did imputation to obtain dense coverage of the genes and comparable genotype data for all cohorts. In total, 58 single nucleotide polymorphisms in TLR4 and 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms in TLR6-1-10 were genotyped or imputed and analyzed in the entire data set. We did a cohort-specific analysis as well as meta-analysis and pooled analysis. We also evaluated whether the analyses differed by age or disease severity.  Results:   We observed no overall association between genetic variation at the TLR4 and TLR6-1-10 loci and risk of prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Common germ line genetic variation in TLR4 and TLR6-1-10 did not seem to have a strong association with risk of prostate cancer.  Impact:   This study suggests that earlier associations between prostate cancer risk and TLR4 and TLR6-1-10 sequence variants were chance findings. To definitely assess the causal relationship between TLR sequence variants and prostate cancer risk, very large sample sizes are needed.""","""['Sara Lindström', 'David J Hunter', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Pär Stattin', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Stephen J Chanock', 'Richard Hayes', 'Peter Kraft']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Polymorphisms of an innate immune gene, toll-like receptor 4, and aggressive prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association between Toll-like receptor gene cluster (TLR6, TLR1, and TLR10) and prostate cancer.', 'Sequence variants in Toll-like receptor gene cluster (TLR6-TLR1-TLR10) and prostate cancer risk.', 'Interactions of sequence variants in interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase4 and the toll-like receptor 6-1-10 gene cluster increase prostate cancer risk.', 'A meta-analysis of TLR4 and TLR9 SNPs implicated in severe malaria.', 'Innate Immune Program in Formation of Tumor-Initiating Cells from Cells-of-Origin of Breast, Prostate, and Ovarian Cancers.', 'TLR4 Polymorphisms and Expression in Solid Cancers.', 'TLR2 and TLR4 polymorphisms influence mRNA and protein expression in colorectal cancer.', 'Polymorphisms of an innate immune gene, toll-like receptor 4, and aggressive prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Toll-like receptor 10-1-6 gene cluster polymorphisms are not associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia in korean population.']"""

The stroma-derived growth factors/cytokines and hyaluronan act in autocrine/paracrine ways with their receptors, including receptor-tyrosine kinases and CD44 variants (CD44v), to potentiate and support tumor epithelial cell survival. Overexpression of hyaluronan, CD44v9 variants, and stroma-derived growth factors/cytokines are specific features in many cancers, including prostate cancer. Androgen/androgen receptor interaction has a critical role in regulating prostate cancer growth. Our previous study showed that 1) that increased synthesis of hyaluronan in normal epithelial cells promotes expression of CD44 variants; 2) hyaluronan interaction with CD44v6-v9 promotes activation of receptor-tyrosine kinase, which stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-induced cell survival pathways; and 3) CD44v6/short hairpin RNA reduces colon tumor growth in vivo (Misra, S., Hascall, V. C., De Giovanni, C., Markwald, R. R., and Ghatak, S. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 12432-12446). Our results now show that hepatocyte growth factor synthesized by myofibroblasts associated with prostate cancer cells induces activation of HGF-receptor/cMet and stimulates hyaluronan/CD44v9 signaling. This, in turn, stabilizes the androgen receptor functions in prostate cancer cells. The stroma-derived HGF induces a lipid raft-associated signaling complex that contains CD44v9, cMet/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, HSP90 and androgen receptor. CD44v9/short hairpin RNA reverses the assembly of these components in the complex and inhibits androgen receptor function. Our results provide new insight into the hyaluronan/CD44v9-regulated androgen receptor function and the consequent malignant activities in prostate cancer cells. The present study describes a physiologically relevant in vitro model for studying the molecular mechanisms by which stroma-derived HGF and hyaluronan influence androgen receptor and CD44 functions in the secretory epithelia during prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Shibnath Ghatak', 'Vincent C Hascall', 'Roger R Markwald', 'Suniti Misra']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells differ in their response to hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor.', 'MET Signaling Mediates Intestinal Crypt-Villus Development, Regeneration, and Adenoma Formation and Is Promoted by Stem Cell CD44 Isoforms.', 'Hyaluronan-CD44 interaction promotes c-Src-mediated twist signaling, microRNA-10b expression, and RhoA/RhoC up-regulation, leading to Rho-kinase-associated cytoskeleton activation and breast tumor cell invasion.', 'Hepatocyte growth factor/MET and CD44 in colorectal cancer: partners in tumorigenesis and therapy resistance.', 'The CD147-HYALURONAN Axis in Cancer.', 'Advances in Gelatin Bioinks to Optimize Bioprinted Cell Functions.', 'Chemotherapy induces feedback up-regulation of CD44v6 in colorectal cancer initiating cells through β-catenin/MDR1 signaling to sustain chemoresistance.', 'Investigation of androgen receptor-dependent alternative splicing has identified a unique subtype of lethal prostate cancer.', 'The extracellular matrix alteration, implication in modulation of drug resistance mechanism: friends or foes?', 'Interplay Between Chemotherapy-Activated Cancer Associated Fibroblasts and Cancer Initiating Cells Expressing CD44v6 Promotes Colon Cancer Resistance.']"""

PC is often asymptomatic, which makes it very difficult to diagnose clinically. The general practitioner can use prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing as a diagnostic tool in PC. The use of PSA testing has been recommended by the Danish Urological Society since 1997. Our objective was to study the application and results of PSA testing in the former County of Aarhus, Denmark, in the period 1995-2006.  Material and methods:   We extracted data from the laboratory database, LABKA, and the National Patient Registry (NPR) during the period 1995 to 2006. Data were merged by civil registration number, and the unit ordering PSA was identified as general practice or specialized healthcare system. Furthermore, we categorized samples as incident, repeated normal, repeated raised samples, or controls.  Results:   The use of PSA increased 43-fold in this period and the proportion of samples ordered by general practice increased from 38.6% (95% confidence interval: 36.4-40.8%) in 1998 to 66.1% (65.4-66.8%) in 2006. The proportion of incident samples ordered by general practice, with results below four mikromol/l increased rapidly, whereas it decreased in the specialized healthcare system. In this population, the PC incidence increased the same period, but remained stable from 2004 onwards. Furthermore, we found that the mean number of tests per man per year increased in general practice.  Conclusion:   PSA testing in general practice is conducted more frequently, a tendency which may be explained by more check-ups after PC treatment, watchful waiting and opportunistic screening.""","""['Thomas Ostersen Mukai', 'Flemming Bro', 'Knud Venborg Pedersen', 'Peter Vedsted']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ugeskr Laeger""","""['Prostate-specific antigen testing in Ontario: reasons for testing patients without diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Non-systematic screening for prostate cancer in Sweden--survey from the National Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Prostate-specific antigen testing in general practice: a survey among 325 general practitioners in Denmark.', 'Prognostic value of serum markers for prostate cancer.', 'Advancements in PSA-based screening for prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic consequences of implementing cancer patient pathways in Denmark: a comparative cohort study of symptomatic cancer patients in primary care.', 'Danish Prostate Cancer Registry - methodology and early results from a novel national database.', 'Tumour stage and implementation of standardised cancer patient pathways: a comparative cohort study.', 'Childhood body mass index and the risk of prostate cancer in adult men.', ""Danish General Practitioners' Use of Prostate-Specific Antigen in Opportunistic Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Survey Comprising 174 GPs.""]"""

As a result, tools are needed to facilitate informed decision making. While there have been several decision aids (DAs) developed and tested, very few have included an exercise to help men clarify their values and preferences about PCa screening. Further, only one DA has utilized an interactive web-based format, which allows for an expansion and customization of the material. We describe the development of two DAs, a booklet and an interactive website, each with a values clarification component and designed for use in diverse settings.  Methods:   We conducted two feasibility studies to assess men's (45-70 years) Internet access and their willingness to use a web- vs. a print-based tool. The booklet was adapted from two previous versions evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the website was created to closely match the content of the revised booklet. Usability testing was conducted to obtain feedback regarding draft versions of the materials. The tools were also reviewed by a plain language expert and the interdisciplinary research team. Feedback on the content and presentation led to iterative modifications of the tools.  Results:   The feasibility studies confirmed that the Internet was a viable medium, as the majority of men used a computer, had access to the Internet, and Internet use increased over time. Feedback from the usability testing on the length, presentation, and content of the materials was incorporated into the final versions of the booklet and website. Both the feasibility studies and the usability testing highlighted the need to address men's informed decision making regarding screening.  Conclusions:   Informed decision making for PCa screening is crucial at present and may be important for some time, particularly if a definitive recommendation either for or against screening does not emerge from ongoing prostate cancer screening trials. We have detailed our efforts at developing print- and web-based DAs to assist men in determining how to best meet their PCa screening preferences.

An advantage of relative survival is that it provides a measure of mortality associated with a particular disease, without the need for information on cause of death. Relative survival provides a measure of net mortality, i.e. the probability of death due to cancer in the absence of other causes. This is a useful measure, but it is also of interest to measure crude mortality, i.e. the probability of death due to cancer in the presence of other causes. A previous approach to estimate the crude probability of death in population-based cancer studies used life table methods, but we show how the estimates can be obtained after fitting a relative survival model. We adopt flexible parametric models for relative survival, which use restricted cubic splines for the baseline cumulative excess hazard and for any time-dependent effects.

TF normally exists in a partially encrypted state and its de-encryption on circulating monocytes, platelets or endothelial cells by inflammatory mediators can lead to thrombosis. Furthermore, many cancer cells express large amounts of TF and these cells communicate readily with the circulation through the fenestrated tumor endothelium. To assess agents or conditions that modulate the encryption state of TF, we developed a continuous assay for the determination of TF procoagulant activity (PCA) in a cell-based system. We have shown the use of this assay at detecting agents that de-encrypt TF thereby leading to an increase in TF PCA in three cancer cell lines, namely, T24/83 bladder carcinoma cells and PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells. Further, through use of this assay, we have shown that the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump inhibitor, thapsigargin, stimulates the de-encryption of TF. The continuous assay for the determination of TF PCA proved to have inherently less intra- and inter-assay variability than the widely used discontinuous assay and is considerably less labor intensive. Further, the continuous assay produced progress curves that were compatible with curve fitting to allow for the determination of the nature of reaction as well as rate constants for the underlying enzymes, TF/FVIIa and FXa.

The proportion of cases with high methylation in GS 7 vs < or = GS 6 and pT3/pT4 vs pT2 were also significantly different (P-values=0.002 and 0.005, respectively). There were also significant increases in methylation from Gleason pattern 2-3 and from pattern 3 to 4/5 (paired t-test P-values=0.01 and <0.001, respectively), whereas methylation from lymph node metastases was decreased when compared with matched tumor tissue (P-value=0.029). HOXD3 methylation was associated with biochemical recurrence in univariate analysis (P-value=0.043) and showed evidence for interaction with pathological stage as a predictor variable in Cox regression analysis (P-value=0.028). The results indicate that HOXD3 methylation distinguishes low-grade prostate cancers from intermediate and high-grade ones and may also have prognostic value when considered together with pathological stage.""","""['Ken J Kron', 'Liyang Liu', 'Vaijayanti V Pethe', 'Nino Demetrashvili', 'Michael E Nesbitt', 'John Trachtenberg', 'Hilmi Ozcelik', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Laurent Briollais', 'Theodorus H van der Kwast', 'Bharati Bapat']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Lab Invest""","""['Association of tissue promoter methylation levels of APC, TGFβ2, HOXD3 and RASSF1A with prostate cancer progression.', 'Correlation of ERG expression and DNA methylation biomarkers with adverse clinicopathologic features of prostate cancer.', 'Correlation of HOXD3 promoter hypermethylation with clinical and pathologic features in screening prostate biopsies.', 'GBX2 Methylation Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker and Improves Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence Among Patients with Prostate Cancer Negative for Intraductal Carcinoma and Cribriform Architecture.', 'Methylation of PITX2, HOXD3, RASSF1 and TDRD1 predicts biochemical recurrence in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Somatic driver mutation prevalence in 1844 prostate cancers identifies ZNRF3 loss as a predictor of metastatic relapse.', 'Biomarker in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Advances in Prognostic Methylation Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'The Impact of Whole Genome Data on Therapeutic Decision-Making in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Analysis.', 'LAT, HOXD3 and NFE2L3 identified as novel DNA methylation-driven genes and prognostic markers in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma by integrative bioinformatics approaches.']"""

We evaluated how visits to specialists and primary care physicians (PCPs) by men with localized prostate cancer are related to treatment choice.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database, we identified 85 088 men with clinically localized prostate cancer diagnosed at age 65 years or older, between 1994 and 2002. Men were categorized by primary treatment received within 9 months of diagnosis: radical prostatectomy (n = 18 201 [21%]), radiotherapy (n = 35 925 [42%]), androgen deprivation (n = 14 021 [17%]), or expectant management (n = 16 941 [20%]). Visits to specialists and PCPs were analyzed by patient characteristics and primary therapies received and were identified using Medicare claims and the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile.  Results:   Overall, 42 309 men (50%) were seen exclusively by urologists, 37 540 (44%) by urologists and radiation oncologists, 2329 (3%) by urologists and medical oncologists, and 2910 (3%) by all 3 specialists. There was a strong association between the type of specialist seen and primary therapy received. Visits to PCPs were infrequent between diagnosis and receipt of therapy (22% of patients visited any PCP and 17% visited an established PCP) and were not associated with a greater likelihood of specialist visits. Irrespective of age, comorbidity status, or specialist visits, men seen by PCPs were more likely to be treated expectantly.  Conclusions:   Specialist visits relate strongly to prostate cancer treatment choices. In light of these findings, prior evidence that specialists prefer the modality they themselves deliver and the lack of conclusive comparative studies demonstrating superiority of one modality over another, it is essential to ensure that men have access to balanced information before choosing a particular therapy for prostate cancer.""","""['Thomas L Jang', 'Justin E Bekelman', 'Yihai Liu', 'Peter B Bach', 'Ethan M Basch', 'Elena B Elkin', 'Michael J Zelefsky', 'Peter T Scardino', 'Colin B Begg', 'Deborah Schrag']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Arch Intern Med""","""['Patient-centered comparative effectiveness research: essential for high-quality care.', 'The prostate cancer treatment bazaar: comment on ""Physician visits prior to treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer"".', 'Specialist visits (urologist, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist) are strongly associated with treatment received for prostate cancer in the USA.', 'Comparison of recommendations by urologists and radiation oncologists for treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'The prostate cancer treatment bazaar: comment on ""Physician visits prior to treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer"".', ""United States radiation oncologists' and urologists' opinions about screening and treatment of prostate cancer vary by region."", 'The role of androgen ablation in patients with biochemical or local failure after definitive radiation therapy: a survey of practice patterns of urologists and radiation oncologists in the United States.', 'Avoiding obsolescence in advanced prostate cancer management: a guide for urologists.', 'A Comparison Between the Rates of Radiation Oncologist and Urologist Consultations in Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer in Northern Ontario, Canada.', 'Exploring Variation in the Receipt of Recommended Active Surveillance for Men with Favorable-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Regional Variation in Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer in the US.', ""Factors associated with physicians' recommendations for managing low-risk papillary thyroid cancer."", 'Sensitivity of Medicare Data to Identify Oncologists.']"""

Methods:   Two focus groups (n = 14) of women whose partners were diagnosed with prostate cancer (diagnoses' 1 - 18 months). A trained facilitator used open-ended questions to explore ideas. The framework approach was used to analyze the transcripts.  Results:   Three main themes emerged: 1. More support. Validation and information is needed for women including emotional support and opportunities to share experiences. 2. Role of the physician. The transfer of care once specialized treatment is no longer needed remained poorly defined, which increased confusion and feelings of abandonment related to the role of the primary physician. 3. Partners' relationship changes. Men became more dependent on their partners for support and to act as the primary communicator and caregiver.

Methods:   Cancer death certification numbers by cause and estimates of the resident population in 2003, stratified by sex and quinquennium of age, were obtained from the World Health Organization database. In 2003, cause of death encoding was changed from the 9th to the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). All cancers and groups of cancers, classified according to the 10th revision of the ICD, were grouped into 30 categories, besides other and unspecified sites. Mortality rates were age-standardized on the world standard population in five-year age groups up to 80-84 years and 85+.  Results:   The total number of cancer deaths in Italy was 167,144 in 2003 (96,127 men and 71,017 women), with age-standardized death rates of 160.63 and 89.32 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively.

However, immunologic tolerance to TAA poses a significant obstacle to effective, TAA-targeted immunotherapy. We sought to investigate whether androgen deprivation would result in circumventing immune tolerance to prostate TAA by impacting CD8 cell responses.  Methods:   To this end, we generated a transgenic mouse that expresses the human prostate-specific antigen (PSA) specifically in the prostate, and crossed it to the HLA-A2.1 transgenic mouse to evaluate how androgen deprivation affects human HLA A2.1-resticted T cell responses following immunization of PSA-expressing mice by vaccinia-PSA (PROSTVAC).  Results:   Our PSA transgenic mouse showed restricted expression of PSA in the prostate and detectable circulating PSA levels. Additionally, PSA expression was androgen-dependent with reduced PSA expression in the prostate within 1 week of castration, and undetectable PSA by day 42 after castration as evaluated by ELISA. Castration of the PSA/A2.1 hybrid mouse prior to immunization with a PSA-expressing recombinant vaccinia virus resulted in a significant augmentation of PSA-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes.  Conclusions:   This humanized hybrid mouse model provides a well-defined system to gain additional insight into the mechanisms of immune tolerance to PSA and to test novel strategies aiming at circumventing immune tolerance to PSA and other TAA for targeted prostate cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Mohamed S Arredouani', 'Stephanie S Tseng-Rogenski', 'Brent K Hollenbeck', 'June Escara-Wilke', 'Karen R Leander', 'Deborah Defeo-Jones', 'Clara Hwang', 'Martin G Sanda']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Identification and characterization of a human agonist cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope of human prostate-specific antigen.', 'Dual antigen target-based immunotherapy for prostate cancer eliminates the growth of established tumors in mice.', 'Anti-tumor effect of the alphavirus-based virus-like particle vector expressing prostate-specific antigen in a HLA-DR transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'CpG oligonucleotide as an adjuvant for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'A transgenic strategy for analyzing the regulatory regions of the human prostate-specific antigen gene: potential applications for the treatment of prostate cancer (Review).', 'SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in androgen sensitive phenotypes - A study on associated factors for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and its adverse effects among androgenetic alopecia and benign prostate hyperplasia patients.', 'Androgen conspires with the CD8+ T cell exhaustion program and contributes to sex bias in cancer.', 'Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Engineered T Cell Therapy for the Management of Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'CAR-T cell therapy: a potential new strategy against prostate cancer.']"""

Some of them, namely [AuCl(2) (DMDT)] (compound 1) and [AuBr(2) (ESDT)] (compound 2), have shown to be highly active against the androgen-resistant prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145, both inhibiting cell proliferation in a dose-dependent way, and are more active than the reference drug cisplatin (cis-[PtCl(2) (NH(3) )(2) ]). In particular, [AuCl(2) (DMDT)] was proved cytotoxic against cisplatin-resistant R-PC3 cells, with activity levels comparable to those induced on the parent cisplatin-sensitive PC3 cells, ruling out the occurrence of cross-resistance phenomena. Moreover, it causes early cell damage, slightly affecting the cell cycle, thus suggesting a different mechanism of action from clinically established platinum-based drugs. In fact, the investigated gold(III) complex alters mitochondrial functions, promoting mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and Cyt-c release, stimulating ROS generation, and strongly inhibiting the activity of the selenoenzyme TrxR, which is overexpressed in prostate cancer and associated with the onset of drug resistance. In addition, it induces apoptosis, caspase activation, Bcl-2 downregulation and Bax upregulation, reduces the expression of the phosphorylated form of the EGFR, and it inhibits PC3 cell migration.

Methods:   CWR22Rv1 and PC-3 were subjected to flow cytometry, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and Western blot studies to measure DMAPT's ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibit NFkappaB DNA binding, and cause changes in anti-apoptotic proteins. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were used to determine the contribution of ROS and JNK2 activation, respectively. The BrdU incorporation assay was used to measure proliferation and trypan blue studies assessed cell viability after DMAPT treatment. The in vivo activity of DMAPT as a single agent and in combination with bicalutamide or docetaxel was assessed in a subcutaneous xenograft model with athymic nude female mice.  Results:   DMAPT generated ROS with subsequent JNK activation and inhibited NFkappaB DNA binding and expression of NFkappaB-regulated anti-apoptotic proteins. DMAPT increased necrotic and apoptotic cell death in a cell-type-dependent manner and both types of cell death were blocked by NAC. Additionally, shRNA JNK2 partially blocked the anti-proliferative activity of DMAPT. DMAPT inhibited CWR22Rv1 and PC-3 cellular proliferation by 100% with 10 and 20 microM respectively and in vivo, DMAPT was more effective at inhibiting growth than biclutamide (CWR22v1) and docetaxel (PC-3).

Pre-operative serum cav-1 levels have been shown to be a prognostic marker for PC recurrence. This study evaluated the relationship between post-treatment serum cav-1 levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cav-1 and -2 genes with risk of PC, aggressive PC, PC recurrence or death.  Methods:   Two case-control studies of PC among men in Washington State were combined for this analysis. Cases (n = 1,458) were diagnosed in 1993-1996 or 2002-2005 and identified via a SEER cancer registry. Age-matched controls (n = 1,351) were identified via random digit dialing. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between exposures (19 haplotype-tagging SNPs from all subjects and post-treatment serum cav-1 levels from a sample of 202 cases and 226 controls) and PC risk and aggressive PC. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the relationship between exposures and PC recurrence and death.  Results:   Rs9920 in cav-1 was associated with an increased relative risk of overall PC (OR(CT + CC) = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.68) and aggressive PC (OR(CT + CC) = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.20, 2.06), but not with PC recurrence or death. High post-treatment serum cav-1 levels were not associated with PC risk, aggressive PC, or PC-specific death, but approached a significant inverse association with PC recurrence (hazard ratio = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.47, 1.00).  Conclusions:   We found modest evidence for an association with a variant in the cav-1 gene and risk of overall PC and aggressive PC, which merits further study.

We evaluated the diagnostic yield of repeated transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsies. We also assessed whether the result of the repeated biopsy depended on the benign diagnosis of the previous biopsy.  Methods:   From June 2006 till December 2008, the total of 794 men underwent a TRUS guided biopsy. The following parameters were recorded for each patient: age, total Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) level, free PSA level, digital rectal examination record, total prostate volume, and the histo-pathological evaluation. For patients undergoing a repeated biopsy, the histo-pathological result of the previous biopsy was also available, as well as the total number of previous biopsies and the time since the last biopsy. These data were analyzed using standard statistical methods.  Results:   Initial biopsy was positive for prostate cancer in 157 out of 566 men (27.7%). The total PSA level was confirmed to be a significant (P < 0.001) predictor of prostate cancer. The ratio of free PSA to total PSA (the so-called PSA index) was found to be significantly lower (P < 0.001) for patients suffering from adenocarcinoma. A total of 191 men underwent a repeated biopsy. The repeated biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma in 39 cases (20.4%). Although this yield is lower, the significance is at the threshold (P = 0.04700). In the group of re-biopted men, total PSA level and PSA index were again significant (P = 0.0024 and P = 0.0015 respectively) predictive factors for prostate carcinoma. The diagnostic yield of repeated biopsy was assessed with respect to the most common types of the benign findings in the previous biopsy--adenomyomatous hyperplasia, inflammation, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and suspected adenocarcinoma. No significant difference in the diagnostic yield was found (P = 0.38431).  Conclusions:   Total PSA level and PSA index are the most significant precursors of adenocarcinoma in both initial and repeated biopsy. The histo-pathological result of a repeated biopsy was found to be independent of the type of benign diagnosis of the previous biopsy.

A new quantitative model built on the behavior of such nucleosome pairs correctly identified regions bound by the regulators of the immediate androgen response, including androgen receptor and FOXA1.

The potential prognostic role of the combined alterations in EGFR and PTEN in prostate cancer is not well established. It was the aim of the study to investigate this role. Prevalence of EGFR and PTEN somatic mutations, EGFR amplification and EGFR protein expression were investigated in a series of prostate adenocarcinomas, classified according to the current Gleason grading system. Mutational analysis revealed eight EGFR and three PTEN mutations in 98 (8%) and 92 (3%) prostate adenocarcinomas, respectively. The combined prevalence of EGFR-PTEN mutations was 11%. EGFR overexpression was present in 31% of adenocarcinomas, with a marginally significant difference (P=0.068) between Gleason grade < or =7 adenocarcinomas and Gleason grade > or =8 and metastatic adenocarcinomas. Four cases (4 of 31; 13%) had an EGFR gene gain due to chromosome 7 polysomy. In 35% of adenocarcinomas we found some type of EGFR-PTEN alteration, with a tendency to be associated with advanced-stage prostate adenocarcinomas (P=0.04). The IVS18+19 polymorphism was also associated with more advanced prostate adenocarcinomas. This is the first study reporting mutations of EGFR and PTEN in the same series of prostate adenocarcinomas. Protein overexpression is the most frequent EGFR abnormality. Mutations in EGFR and PTEN genes are a minor event, although prostate cancer represents the third neoplasm in which the EGFR gene mutations are more prevalent.

It was found that Fan inhibited human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3) cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Studies of cell-cycle progression showed that the anti-proliferative effect of Fan was associated with an increase in the G1/S phase of PC3 cells. Western blot results indicated that Fan-induced G1/S phase arrest was mediated through inhibition of cyclin-regulated signaling pathways. Fan induced p27 expression and inhibited cyclin D and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in PC3 cells. Increased exposure time to Fan caused apoptosis of PC3 cells, which was associated with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase 3, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, Fan had anti-tumorigenic activity in vivo, including reduction of tumor volume and pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in a PC3 nude mouse xenograft.

Methods and materials:   A gamma scintillation survey meter was converted to a seed-migration detector by adding a shield on the probe detection window. The detector response to three (125)I seed activities was characterized for different source-to-detector distances in water. The detector was used to perform a chest evaluation on 737 patients at their first postoperative visit. When the detector showed positive activity, seed migration was confirmed by taking a chest radiograph and by looking at the region with fluoroscopy.  Results:   One hundred and three patients (14.0%) presented at least one embolized seed. This accounts for 123 of the 39,887 seeds. Eighty-seven, 12, and 4 patients had respectively one, two, and three seed embolization. Compared with the seed-migration detector, detection based on fluoroscopy would have led to 13 false-negative detections (of 103, or 12.6%), and the radiograph would have resulted in 31 or 30.1%. More important, standard chest X-ray would have required a survey and extra radiation dose to lung to 100% of the patients, rather than the 14% who required it.

Methods and materials:   Of 64 men with localized prostate cancer alive with a minimum 7-year follow-up after treatment as part of a randomized trial with either 70.2 GyE or 79.2 GyE of external beam radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital, 56 men (88%) returned a QOL questionnaire, and 50 of those men had DVH information. The DVH parameters of the anterior rectal wall were correlated with patient-reported long-term GI QOL using Pearson correlation and t tests.  Results:   There was a trend toward an association between increased long-term GI dysfunction and higher V60 (p = 0.07), V65 (p = 0.06), V70 (p = 0.09), and V75 (p = 0.09). When dichotomized by their medians, a V60 > 54% (p = 0.04), V70 > 44% (p = 0.06), and V75 > 39% (p = 0.06) were associated with increased long-term GI dysfunction. There was no difference in long-term GI dysfunction between men on the conventional vs. high-dose arms (p = 0.49).  Conclusions:   Dose-volume histogram parameters of the anterior rectal wall were associated with long-term patient-reported GI QOL after prostate radiation, whereas the dose prescribed to the prostate was not, suggesting that DVH constraints, rather than total prescribed dose, may have the greatest impact on long-term bowel dysfunction, and therefore that continued dose escalation may be feasible if appropriate dose-volume constraints are met.""","""['Paul L Nguyen', 'Ronald C Chen', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Alexei Trofimov', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'John J Coen', 'William U Shipley', 'Anthony L Zietman', 'James A Talcott']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Clinical and dosimetric predictors of late rectal syndrome after 3D-CRT for localized prostate cancer: preliminary results of a multicenter prospective study.', 'Impact of volume and location of irradiated rectum wall on rectal blood loss after radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Phase II dose escalation study of image-guided adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer: use of dose-volume constraints to achieve rectal isotoxicity.', 'Comparison of late rectal toxicity from conventional versus three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer: analysis of clinical and dosimetric factors.', 'Patient reported outcomes for quality of life (QOL) by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) on average 15 years post treatment.', 'Selection criteria for 3D conformal radiotherapy versus volumetric-modulated arc therapy in high-grade glioma based on normal tissue complication probability of brain.', 'Association between EBRT dose volume histograms and quality of life in prostate cancer patients.', 'Prostate Cancer Patient Characteristics Associated With a Strong Preference to Preserve Sexual Function and Receipt of Active Surveillance.', 'Spatial rectal dose/volume metrics predict patient-reported gastro-intestinal symptoms after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

It has been reported that OPN induce matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activations through nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-mediated signaling pathways. In this study, we investigated the roles of OPN in human prostate cancer cells and provided clues about the possible functions of IkappaB kinase (IKK) in NF-kappaB-mediated OPN-induced activations of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors were used to inhibit OPN expression in PC-3 cells, human prostate cancer cell line, and IKK inhibitor VII were applied to inhibit the activities of IKK-1 and IKK-2. The results showed that OPN shRNA-mediated RNA interference can downregulate OPN, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions, thereby resulting in suppression of the proliferation, migration and invasion of PC-3 cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, the inhibition of IKK-2 can suppress MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions, in contrast, the inhibition of IKK-1 has no effects on the OPN, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels. Thus, this study demonstrated that OPN knockdown could downregulate MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions result in inhibiting the malignant physiological behaviors of PC-3 cell and that IKK-2 may play a crucial role in OPN-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions via NF-kappaB-mediated signaling pathways.""","""['Hao Liu', 'Anmin Chen', 'Fengjing Guo', 'Lin Yuan']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Effect of short-hairpin RNA expression vector-mediated osteopontin RNA interference on proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Osteopontin increases migration and MMP-9 up-regulation via alphavbeta3 integrin, FAK, ERK, and NF-kappaB-dependent pathway in human chondrosarcoma cells.', 'A small interfering RNA targeting osteopontin as gastric cancer therapeutics.', ""Osteopontin: it's role in regulation of cell motility and nuclear factor kappa B-mediated urokinase type plasminogen activator expression."", 'Potential therapeutic target for pulmonary arterial hypertension--osteopontin.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Pan-Cancer Analyses Reveal Prognostic Value of Osteomimicry Across 20 Solid Cancer Types.', 'Osteopontin: A Key Regulator of Tumor Progression and Immunomodulation.', 'Correlation of OPN gene expression with proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells and prognosis of patients.', 'Antitumor effects of baicalin on ovarian cancer cells through induction of cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell migration in\xa0vitro.']"""

The biopsy protocol consisted of traditional sextant, plus additional ≥10 cores. A single pathologist mapped the tumor outline on RP, determined the number of PCA foci, their Gleason score (GS), and stage.  Results:   Patients' median age and preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen was 60 years and 5.6 ng/mL, respectively. SBx detected bilateral PCA in 33 and unilateral PCA in 39 men. All cases with bilateral PCA by SBx had bilateral tumor in RP. Only 4 of 39 patients with unilateral positive SBx had unilateral cancer in RP.

To uncover vitamin D resistance mechanism, we established a vitamin D-resistant human prostate cancer LNCaP cell line, LNCaP-R, by chronic exposure of cells to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-VD). The vitamin D receptor (VDR)-mediated transcriptional activity was reduced in LNCaP-R, whereas VDR expression level and DNA-binding capacity were similar compared to parental cells (LNCaP-P). The expressions of the key factors involved in VDR transactivity, including CYP24A1 and VDR-associated proteins are all increased in LNCaP-R cells, and yet treatment with ketoconazole, P450 enzymes inhibitor, as well as trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, did not sensitize LNCaP-R cells response to vitamin D, suggesting that neither a local 1,25-VD availability, nor VDR-associated proteins are responsible for the vitamin D resistance. Interestingly, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling, which is critical for 1,25-VD/VDR activity was found reduced in LNCaP-R cells, thereby treatment with NF-kappaB activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), can sensitize LNCaP-R vitamin D response.

Studies exploring the relationship between the two conditions have been inconclusive. Using a population-based, case-control study of PCa, we explore the relationship between early-onset MPB and PCa risk.  Methods:   Cases were men aged 35-74 diagnosed with PCa between 2002 and 2005 in King County, Washington. Controls were frequency matched by age and identified by random digit dialing. Hair pattern at age 30 and at 1 year prior to diagnosis (cases) or reference date (controls) was determined using showcards. PCa risk associated with balding was assessed with logistic regression.  Results:   Data from 999 cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. Hair loss at age 30 was more common in controls (25.2%) than cases (19.8%, p=0.005), and those with hair loss at age 30 had a 29% relative risk reduction for PCa (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56-0.91). No risk reduction was seen for men only reporting hair loss at referent age (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73-1.12). In men aged >60 at referent date, the risk reduction was greater for men with hair loss at age 30 from both the top of head and forehead (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.93).

Synergistic and selective cancer cell death was achieved by AP-mediated co-delivery of very small amounts of DOX and Bcl-xL-specific shRNA, which simultaneously activated an intrinsic apoptotic pathway. A branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) was grafted to polyethylene glycol (PEI-PEG) to serve as a vehicle for shRNA delivery, and its surface was further conjugated with an anti-PSMA aptamer (APT) for the selective delivery of APs to prostate cancer cells that express prostate-specific membrane antigens (PSMA) on their cell surface. The APs were finally obtained after intercalation of DOX to form shRNA/PEI-PEG-APT/DOX conjugates. Cell viability assays and FACS analysis of GFP expression against PC3 (PSMA deficient) and LNCaP (PSMA overexpressed) cells demonstrated that the synthesized APs inhibited the growth of PSMA-abundant prostate cancer cells with strong cell selectivity. Consequently, IC(50) values of APs loaded with both DOX and shRNA were approximately 17-fold less than those for the simple mixture of shRNA plus drug (shRNA/Lipofectamine + DOX).

Additionally, camptothecin disrupted the association between AR and heat shock protein 90 and impeded binding of the synthetic androgen [3H]R1881 to AR in LNCaP cells. Camptothecin also blocked androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation, leading to downregulation of the AR target gene PSA. In addition to decreasing the intracellular and secreted prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, camptothecin markedly inhibited androgen-stimulated PSA promoter activity. Collectively, our data reveal that camptothecin not only serves as a traditional genotoxic agent but, by virtue of its ability to target and disrupt AR, may also be a novel candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Shicheng Liu', 'Yiming Yuan', 'Yutaka Okumura', 'Norihiro Shinkai', 'Hitoshi Yamauchi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Etoposide induces growth arrest and disrupts androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor signaling and vitamin D receptor action in prostate cancer cells.', 'Hinokitiol, a metal chelator derived from natural plants, suppresses cell growth and disrupts androgen receptor signaling in prostate carcinoma cell lines.', 'Interactions between vitamin D and androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanism of action of camptothecin.', 'Theoretical Study on the Aggregation and Adsorption Behaviors of Anticancer Drug Molecules on Graphene/Graphene Oxide Surface.', 'Tumor-targeted/reduction-triggered composite multifunctional nanoparticles for breast cancer chemo-photothermal combinational therapy.', 'Development of a High-Throughput Screening Assay for Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Androgen Receptor Splice Variants.', 'Antitumor Activity of NLG207 (Formerly CRLX101) in Combination with Enzalutamide in Preclinical Prostate Cancer Models.', 'Future Aspects of CDK5 in Prostate Cancer: From Pathogenesis to Therapeutic Implications.']"""

We utilized one such recently developed approach, MIRA (methylated-CpG island recovery assay) combined with CpG island arrays to identify novel genes that are epigenetically inactivated in breast cancer.  Results:   Using this approach we identified numerous CpG islands that demonstrated aberrant DNA methylation in breast cancer cell lines. Using a combination of COBRA and sequencing of bisulphite modified DNA, we confirmed 5 novel genes frequently methylated in breast tumours; EMILIN2, SALL1, DBC1, FBLN2 and CIDE-A. Methylation frequencies ranged from between 25% and 63% in primary breast tumours, whilst matched normal breast tissue DNA was either unmethylated or demonstrated a much lower frequency of methylation compared to malignant breast tissue DNA. Furthermore expression of the above 5 genes was shown to be restored following treatment with a demethylating agent in methylated breast cancer cell lines. We have expanded this analysis across three other common epithelial cancers (lung, colorectal, prostate). We demonstrate that the above genes show varying levels of methylation in these cancers. Lastly and most importantly methylation of EMILIN2 was associated with poorer clinical outcome in breast cancer and was strongly associated with estrogen receptor as well as progesterone receptor positive breast cancers.  Conclusion:   The combination of the MIRA assay with CpG island arrays is a very useful technique for identifying epigenetically inactivated genes in cancer genomes and can provide molecular markers for early cancer diagnosis, prognosis and epigenetic therapy.""","""['Victoria K Hill', 'Luke B Hesson', 'Temuujin Dansranjavin', 'Ashraf Dallol', 'Ivan Bieche', 'Sophie Vacher', 'Stella Tommasi', 'Timothy Dobbins', 'Dean Gentle', 'David Euhus', 'Cheryl Lewis', 'Reinhard Dammann', 'Robyn L Ward', 'John Minna', 'Eammon R Maher', 'Gerd P Pfeifer', 'Farida Latif']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['A genome-wide screen identifies frequently methylated genes in haematological and epithelial cancers.', 'Hypomethylation of the synuclein gamma gene CpG island promotes its aberrant expression in breast carcinoma and ovarian carcinoma.', 'Identification of novel tumor markers in prostate, colon and breast cancer by unbiased methylation profiling.', 'Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation reveals a class of normally methylated CpG island promoters.', 'Common gene pathways and families altered by DNA methylation in breast and prostate cancers.', 'Colorectal cancer development is affected by the ECM molecule EMILIN-2 hinging on macrophage polarization via the TLR-4/MyD88 pathway.', 'SALL Proteins; Common and Antagonistic Roles in Cancer.', 'Fibulin 2 Is Hypermethylated and Suppresses Tumor Cell Proliferation through Inhibition of Cell Adhesion and Extracellular Matrix Genes in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'The Effects of Exercise Duration and Intensity on Breast Cancer-Related DNA Methylation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'The Efficacy of Anti-PD-L1 Treatment in Melanoma Is Associated with the Expression of the ECM Molecule EMILIN2.']"""

The objective of this study was to compare the anticancer properties of polyphenolic extracts from several mango varieties (Francis, Kent, Ataulfo, Tommy Atkins, and Haden) in cancer cell lines, including Molt-4 leukemia, A-549 lung, MDA-MB-231 breast, LnCap prostate, and SW-480 colon cancer cells and the noncancer colon cell line CCD-18Co. Cell lines were incubated with Ataulfo and Haden extracts, selected on the basis of their superior antioxidant capacity compared to the other varieties, where SW-480 and MOLT-4 were statistically equally most sensitive to both cultivars followed by MDA-MB-231, A-549, and LnCap in order of decreasing efficacy as determined by cell counting. The efficacy of extracts from all mango varieties in the inhibition of cell growth was tested in SW-480 colon carcinoma cells, where Ataulfo and Haden demonstrated superior efficacy, followed by Kent, Francis, and Tommy Atkins. At 5 mg of GAE/L, Ataulfo inhibited the growth of colon SW-480 cancer cells by approximately 72% while the growth of noncancer colonic myofibroblast CCD-18Co cells was not inhibited. The growth inhibition exerted by Ataulfo and Haden polyphenolics in SW-480 was associated with an increased mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic biomarkers and cell cycle regulators, cell cycle arrest, and a decrease in the generation of reactive oxygen species.

To identify subpopulations of cancerous prostate cells with multi-drug resistance and cancer stem-cell properties has recently become a major research interest. We identified a subpopulation from the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1, which have high surface expression of both CD117 and ABCG2. We found this subpopulation of cells termed CD117(+)/ABCG2(+) also overexpress stem cells markers such as Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Nestin, and CD133. These cells are highly prolific and are also resistant to treatment with a variety of chemotherapeutics such as casplatin, paclitaxel, adriamycin, and methotrexate. In addition, CD117(+)/ABCG2(+) cells can readily establish tumors in vivo in a relatively short time. To investigate the mechanism of aggressive tumor growth and drug resistance, we examined the CpG islands on the ABCG2 promoter of CD117(+)/ABCG2(+) cells and found they were remarkably hypomethylated. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed high levels of both histone 3 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation at the CpG islands on the ABCG2 promoter. Our these data suggest that CD117(+)/ABCG2(+) cells could be reliably sorted from the human prostate cancer cell line 22RV1, and represent a valuable model for studying cancer cell physiology and multi-drug resistance.

The frequency of AI at 13q14 was significantly higher in tumors with high Gleason scores (GS) compared with tumors with low GS (p = 0.0478).

In this study, the precipitating factors and prophylaxis for sepsis, the worst complication of the procedure, were assessed.  Patients and methods:   2,023 Patients with suspected prostate cancer who underwent biopsy by TRUS in one center were assessed retrospectively. The relationship between sepsis and age, serum total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density, prostate volume, number of biopsies, number of repeated biopsies, accompanying diagnosis of prostatitis, presence of urethral catheter, and presence of diabetes mellitus was assessed. Data were analyzed using the t test and logistic regression analysis.  Results:   Of the 2,023 patients, 62 (3.06%) developed sepsis within 5 days after biopsy. There was no significant relationship between the biopsy and the above parameters using the logistic regression analysis. Using the t test, it was found that the number of biopsy cores (p < 0.001), presence of urethral catheter (p < 0.0001), and presence of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.0001) were predictive factors for sepsis.  Conclusion:   Sepsis is a rare but life-threatening complication after prostate biopsy by TRUS.

Patients and method:   In this study we enrolled 83 Japanese patients having clinically organ-confined PCa without neoadjuvant treatments who received conventional RT (60 Gy) after RP. All patients had extracapsular extension (ECE) and/or positive surgical margin (PSM) of the RP specimens, but no lymph node metastasis. The disease-specific, clinical failure-free, and BCF-free survivals were analyzed. Furthermore, the risk factors affecting the BCF-free survival were examined in detail.  Results:   The 5-year disease-specific, clinical failure-free, and BCF-free survival rates were 100, 99, and 87%, respectively. The clinicopathological factors associated with BCF were seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) (p = 0.024), perineural invasion (PNI) (p = 0.03), and pre-RT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (p = 0.014). In the patients with PSM (n = 59), the entire surgical margin-positive patients had a significantly higher risk of BCF than the focal surgical margin-positive patients (p = 0.015). Multivariate analysis showed that SVI and pre-RT PSA were independent prognostic factors of BCF (p = 0.0142, p = 0.0225, respectively). 22% of our patients had only low-grade adverse effects.  Conclusion:   The outcome of adjuvant RT after RP in the Japanese patients with ECE and/or PSM was excellent, and the adverse effects were mild and tolerable.

We have further developed the mixture of experts (ME) methodology, a promising approach to tackle complex non-linear problems. Several variants are proposed in integrative ME as well as the inclusion of various gene selection methods to select a hybrid signature.  Results:   We show on three cancer studies that prediction accuracy can be improved when combining both types of variables.

Objective:   We sought to describe incidence patterns of SPMs occurring after CM.  Methods:   We calculated incidence rates and relative risks for the development of 65 different SPMs occurring in 16,591 CM survivors during 1.3 million person-years of observation in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data from 1973 to 2003.  Results:   Compared with the general population, CM survivors had a 32% higher risk of developing any SPM and demonstrated significantly elevated risks for 13 cancers: melanoma of the skin (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 8.99), soft tissue (SIR 2.80), melanoma of the eye and orbit (SIR 2.64), nonepithelial skin (SIR 2.31), salivary gland (SIR 2.18), bone and joint (SIR 1.70), thyroid (SIR 1.90), kidney (SIR 1.29), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR 1.29), brain and nervous system (SIR 1.31), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR 1.25), prostate (SIR 1.13), and female breast (SIR 1.07). Risks of second primary melanoma of the skin, melanoma of the eye and orbit, and cancers of the prostate, soft tissue, salivary gland, and bone and joint were elevated throughout the study period, implying no surveillance bias.  Limitations:   Possible underreporting of CM incidence in cancer registries is a limitation. In addition, the lack of individual-level data in cancer registry data precludes detailed examination of coincident risk factors.  Conclusion:   Risks of particular SPMs after CM may be explained by surveillance bias or shared risk factors. However, these probably do not explain the increased risks observed for prostate, soft tissue, salivary gland, and bone and joint cancers years after CM diagnosis.

Cancer prevalence in these patients is 4 to 5 times higher as compared to the general population. Tumors are also known to behave more aggressively in transplant patients.  Objective:   To perform a descriptive analysis of de novo urological tumors in kidney transplant patients and to analyze patient survival.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective study was conducted in 1751 transplant patients from January 1980 to December 2006. Patients in whom the tumor occurred in the first year after transplantation were excluded. The primary variables considered included sex, age at transplant, age at cancer diagnosis, site, clinical stage, treatment, and outcome. A Chi-square test was used for univariate statistical analysis. Survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Twenty-nine de novo tumors (1.6%) were diagnosed in the 1751 transplanted patients, with a median follow-up of 35.28 months (2-121) from tumor diagnosis. Tumors were found in 24 males (82%) and 5 females (18%). Median age at transplantation was 50.8 (17-70) years, and median age at tumor diagnosis was 56.4 (19-79) years.

A retrospective analysis was made of the outcomes of patients who underwent RC for BCG failure and the clinical and pathological differences between understaged patients and those with clinical progression.  Results:   Five-year CSS was 90% in 45 patients with clinical and pathological NMIBC and 50.6% in 50 patients with progression to muscle-infiltrating disease (clinical progression and understaged) (p < 0,05). There were no differences in survival in patients with clinical progression as compared to understaged patients. Median time from tumor diagnosis to tumor progression was 24 months (10th-90th percentile, 6-98 months).

Understaged patients more often had pathological pT4 stages (p < 0.02).  Conclusion:   In patients with high-risk NMIBCs who fail BCG therapy, RC should be performed before progression because survival is decreased when the RC specimen shows muscle-invasive disease.

Many variables have been related to the presence of cancer in the biopsy (e.g. digital rectal examination [DRE], serum levels of prostate-specific antigen [PSA], free PSA fraction [PSAI/PSAt]). Multivariate mathematical models integrating these variables (nomograms, artificial network models) and improving the capacity to predict tests results are currently available.  Objective:   To develop a nomogram for predicting the probability of a positive prostate biopsy in patients in whom this test is requested, and to use such nomogram in subsequent patients to assess its predictive ability.  Material and methods:   A total of 410 consecutive patients undergoing biopsy due to a suspicious digital rectal examination or two serum PSA values higher than 4 ng/mL were enrolled into the study. Ten cores were taken in the prostate biopsy. Patients with both PSA levels >20 ng/ml and prior biopsies were excluded. The following variables were recorded in each patient: age, total PSA, free PSA fraction, prostate volume, transition zone volume, PSA density, PSA density adjusted by transition zone volume, digital rectal examination, and findings suggesting cancer during transrectal ultrasound (hypoechogenic nodules). Prospective external validation was performed with 185 patients who met the same inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis consisted of four phases: a univariate study, a multivariate logistic regression study which was used to develop the nomogram, internal validation, and prospective external validation. S-Plus#r Programme Design and SPSS 12.0#r software was used for the procedure.  Results:   Variables found to be independently and significantly associated to the presence of cancer included age, digital rectal examination, trnsition zone volume, PSA density, and the presence of hypoechogenic nodules during transrectal ultrasound. Such variables were therefore used to develop the nomogram. The goodness-of-fit of the nomogram was 84%. Validation with an external sample showed a 73% concordance index.

Branched peptides can retain or even increase, through multivalent binding, the biological activity of a peptide and are very resistant to proteolysis, thus having a markedly higher in vivo activity compared with the corresponding monomeric peptides. Oligo-branched peptides, containing the human regulatory peptide neurotensin (NT) sequence, have been used as tumor-specific targeting agents. These peptides are able to selectively and specifically deliver effector units, for cell imaging or killing, to tumor cells that overexpress NT receptors. Results obtained with branched NT conjugated to different functional units for tumor imaging and therapy indicate that branched peptides are promising novel multifunctional targeting molecules. This study is focused on the role of the releasing pattern of drug-conjugated branched NT peptides. We present results obtained with oligo-branched neurotensin peptides conjugated to 6-mercaptopurin (6-MP), combretastain A-4 (CA4) and monastrol (MON). Drugs were conjugated to oligo-branched neurotensin through different linkers, and the mode-of-release, together with cytotoxicity, was studied in different human cancer cell lines. The results show that branched peptides are very promising pharmacodelivery options. Among our drug-armed branched peptides, NT4-CA4 was identified as a candidate for further development and evaluation in preclinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. This peptide-drug exhibits significant activity against pancreas and prostate human cancer cells. Consequently, this derivative is of considerable interest due to the high mortality rates of pancreas neuroendocrine tumors and the high incidence of prostate cancer.""","""['Chiara Falciani', 'Jlenia Brunetti', 'Chiara Pagliuca', 'Stefano Menichetti', 'Lucia Vitellozzi', 'Barbara Lelli', 'Alessandro Pini', 'Luisa Bracci']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""ChemMedChem""","""['Novel bioactive and stable neurotensin peptide analogues capable of delivering radiopharmaceuticals and molecular beacons to tumors.', 'Modular branched neurotensin peptides for tumor target tracing and receptor-mediated therapy: a proof-of-concept.', 'Novel neurotensin analogues for radioisotope targeting to neurotensin receptor-positive tumors.', 'Targeted cancer therapy: conferring specificity to cytotoxic drugs.', 'Peptides and antitumor activity.

Despite abundant efficacy data under preclinical settings, this strategy has resulted in limited success for human cancer control. Amongst many reasons, inefficient systemic delivery and bioavailability of promising chemopreventive agents are considered to significantly contribute to such a disconnect. We recently introduced a novel concept in which we utilized nanotechnology for enhancing the outcome of chemoprevention (Cancer Res. 2009; 69:1712-6) and termed it nanochemoprevention. To establish the proof-of-principle of nanotechnology for cancer management, we determined the efficacy of a well-known chemopreventive agent epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) encapsulated in polylactic acid (PLA)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) nanoparticles in preclinical settings and observed that, compared to non-encapsulated EGCG, nano-EGCG retained its biological efficacy with over 10-fold dose advantage both in cell culture system and in vivo settings in athymic nude mice implanted with human prostate cancer cells. This study laid the foundation of nanochemoprevention by bioactive food components.

The goal of this work was to develop this peptide as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probe for specific detection of distant prostate cancer metastases. The optimal length of arginine-rich peptides was evaluated by the cell uptake efficiency of three fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-tagged oligoarginines (NHGR(9), NHGR(11), and NHGR(13)) in four human prostate cell lines (LNCaP, PZ-HPV-7, DU145, and PC3).

The biodistribution of FITC-NHGR(9), FITC-NHGR(11), and FITC-NHGR(13) performed in control nude mice displayed the unique preferential accumulation of FITC-NHGR(11) in the prostate tissue. Further in vivo evaluation of FITC-NHGR(11) in PC3 tumor-bearing nude mice revealed elevated uptake of this peptide in tumors as compared to other organs. In vivo pharmacokinetics evaluated with (64)Cu-labeled NH(2)GR(11) showed that the peptide was rapidly cleared from the blood (t(1/2) = 10.7 min) and its elimination half-life was 17.2 h.

Although radical prostatectomy, radiation and androgen ablation are effective therapies for androgen-dependent CaP, metastatic castration-resistant CaP is a major complication with high mortality. Androgens stimulate growth and survival of prostate epithelium and early CaP. Although most patients initially respond to androgen ablation, many develop castration-resistant CaP within 12-18 months. Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of castration-resistant CaP remain poorly understood and their elucidation is critical for developing improved therapies. Curiously, castration-resistant CaP remains androgen-receptor dependent, and potent androgen-receptor antagonists induce tumour regression in castrated mice. The role of inflammation in castration-resistant CaP has not been addressed, although it was reported that intrinsic NF-kappaB activation supports its growth. Inflammation is a localized protective reaction to injury or infection, but it also has a pathogenic role in many diseases, including cancer. Whereas acute inflammation is critical for host defence, chronic inflammation contributes to tumorigenesis and metastatic progression. The inflammation-responsive IkappaB kinase (IKK)-beta and its target NF-kappaB have important tumour-promoting functions within malignant cells and inflammatory cells. The latter, including macrophages and lymphocytes, are important elements of the tumour microenvironment, but the mechanisms underlying their recruitment remain obscure, although they are thought to depend on chemokine and cytokine production. We found that CaP progression is associated with inflammatory infiltration and activation of IKK-alpha, which stimulates metastasis by an NF-kappaB-independent, cell autonomous mechanism. Here we show that androgen ablation causes infiltration of regressing androgen-dependent tumours with leukocytes, including B cells, in which IKK-beta activation results in production of cytokines that activate IKK-alpha and STAT3 in CaP cells to enhance hormone-free survival.""","""['Massimo Ammirante', 'Jun-Li Luo', 'Sergei Grivennikov', 'Sergei Nedospasov', 'Michael Karin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Androgens regulate vascular endothelial growth factor content in normal and malignant prostatic tissue.', 'Expression of NF-κB-related proteins and their modulation during TNF-α-provoked apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Nuclear cytokine-activated IKKalpha controls prostate cancer metastasis by repressing Maspin.', 'Recent insights into NF-κB signalling pathways and the link between inflammation and prostate cancer.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Immunogenomic profiles associated with response to life-prolonging agents in prostate cancer.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Ibrutinib Inhibits BTK Signaling in Tumor-Infiltrated B Cells and Amplifies Antitumor Immunity by PD-1 Checkpoint Blockade for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.', 'Development and validation of a tumor immune cell infiltration-related gene signature for recurrence prediction by weighted gene co-expression network analysis in prostate cancer.']"""

In addition, oHSV vectors can also function as a platform to deliver transgenes of interest. In these studies, we have examined the expression of a xenogeneic homologue of the prostate cancer antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), with the goal of enhancing virotherapy against PAP-expressing tumors. PAP has already been used for cancer vaccination in patients with prostate cancer. Here we show that treatment with oHSV bPDelta6 expressing xenogeneic human PAP (hPAP) significantly reduces tumor growth and increases survival of C57/BL6 mice bearing mouse TRAMP-C2 prostate tumors, whereas expression of syngeneic mouse PAP (mPAP) from the same oHSV vector did not enhance antitumor activity. Treatment of mice bearing metastatic TRAMP-C2 lung tumors with oHSV-expressing hPAP resulted in fewer tumor nodules. To our knowledge, this is the first report of oncolytic viruses being used to express xenoantigens.

It may represent cribriform ""high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia"" (HGPIN) or ""intraductal carcinoma of the prostate"" (IDC-P), which is almost always associated with clinically aggressive prostate carcinoma (PCa). Distinction between these 2 lesions has profound clinical significance, especially on needle biopsies. However, there are lesions that do not fully satisfy the criteria for IDC-P yet are worse than typical HGPIN and are difficult to distinguish based on morphologic criteria alone.  Methods:   To better understand the biologic and molecular basis of distinction between cribriform HGPIN and IDC, we used break-apart fluorescence in-situ hybridization assay to assess ETS gene aberrations, a specific and commonest molecular alteration involving PCa, in a cohort of 16 isolated ACL, presumed to be an isolated cribriform HGPIN, and 45 carcinoma-associated ACL (ACL-PCa) on radical prostatectomy specimens, presumed to be spectrum of IDC-P. The latter was further divided into 2 groups: group A with marked nuclear atypia (nuclear size 6xnormal or larger) and/or comedonecrosis (n=21) and group B that did not fulfill these criteria (n=24).  Results:   Overall, ERG rearrangement was absent (0 of 16) in isolated cribriform HGPIN, whereas present in 75% (36 of 48) of IDC-P, of which 65% (23 of 36) were through deletion and 35% (13 of 36) through insertion. Notably, 17% (6 of 36) of the IDC-P showed duplication of ERG rearrangement in combination with deletion of 5'-ERG. Hundred percent (34 of 34) of the IDC-P showed concordance of ERG rearrangement status with adjacent invasive carcinoma. There was no difference between the 2 groups of IDC-P lesions regarding prevalence of ERG rearrangement (group A 79% vs. group B 74%) and EDel2+ (20% vs. 15%). No case with ETV1, ETV4, or ETV5 rearrangement was identified.  Conclusions:   Our molecular data suggest that isolated cribriform HGPIN and IDC-P are biologically distinct lesions. Majority of ACL-PCa most likely represent intraductal spread of PCa. There is a significant overlap between IDC-P and HGPIN at the lower grade morphologic spectrum. ERG break-apart fluorescence in-situ hybridization assay provides insight into understanding the molecular basis of cribriform HGPIN and IDC-P and has potential clinical implications in their distinction on needle biopsies.""","""['Bo Han', 'Khalid Suleman', 'Lei Wang', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Linda Sercia', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Ming Zhou', 'Rajal B Shah']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: relationship to prostatic carcinoma and implication for diagnosis in prostate biopsies.', 'Atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: clinical significance, differential diagnosis and current concept of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Clinicopathological analysis of intraductal proliferative lesions of prostate: intraductal carcinoma of prostate, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and atypical cribriform lesion.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasialike ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 28 cases.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate as a Cause of Prostate Cancer Metastasis: A Molecular Portrait.', 'Genomic Features and Clinical Implications of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Effect of core needle biopsy number on intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) diagnosis in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate: a critical re-appraisal.']"""

We previously reported that Wnt-11 expression is elevated in hormone-independent prostate cancer and that the progression of prostate cancer from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent proliferation correlates with a loss of mutual inhibition between Wnt-11- and androgen receptor-dependent signals. However, the prevalence of increased expression of Wnt-11 in patient tumours and the functions of Wnt-11 in prostate cancer cells were not known.  Results:   Wnt-11 protein levels in prostate tumours were determined by immunohistochemical analysis of prostate tumour tissue arrays. Wnt-11 protein was elevated in 77/117 of tumours when compared with 27 benign prostatic hypertrophy specimens and was present in 4/4 bone metastases. In addition, there was a positive correlation between Wnt-11 expression and PSA levels above 10 ng/ml. Androgen-depleted LNCaP prostate cancer cells form neurites and express genes associated with neuroendocrine-like differentiation (NED), a feature of prostate tumours that have a poor prognosis. Since androgen-depletion increases expression of Wnt-11, we examined the role of Wnt-11 in NED. Ectopic expression of Wnt-11 induced expression of NSE and ASCL1, which are markers of NED, and this was prevented by inhibitors of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, consistent with the known role of this kinase in NED. In contrast, Wnt-11 did not induce NSE expression in RWPE-1 cells, which are derived from benign prostate, suggesting that the role of Wnt-11 in NED is specific to prostate cancer. In addition, silencing of Wnt-11 expression in androgen-depleted LNCaP cells prevented NED and resulted in apoptosis. Silencing of Wnt-11 gene expression in androgen-independent PC3 cells also reduced expression of NSE and increased apoptosis. Finally, silencing of Wnt-11 reduced PC3 cell migration and ectopic expression of Wnt-11 promoted LNCaP cell invasion.  Conclusions:   These observations suggest that the increased level of Wnt-11 found in prostate cancer contributes to tumour progression by promoting NED, tumour cell survival and cell migration/invasion, and may provide an opportunity for novel therapy in prostate cancer.""","""['Pinar Uysal-Onganer', 'Yoshiaki Kawano', 'Mercedes Caro', 'Marjorie M Walker', 'Soraya Diez', 'R Siobhan Darrington', 'Jonathan Waxman', 'Robert M Kypta']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Autophagy pathway is required for IL-6 induced neuroendocrine differentiation and chemoresistance of prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Androgen-responsive and -unresponsive prostate cancer cell lines respond differently to stimuli inducing neuroendocrine differentiation.', 'Elevated circulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) levels are associated with neuroendocrine differentiation in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in the progression of prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate adenocarcinoma.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'Vangl-dependent Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling mediates collective breast carcinoma motility and distant metastasis.', 'The Wnt pathway protein Dvl1 targets somatostatin receptor 2 for lysosome-dependent degradation.', 'TRIM59 is suppressed by androgen receptor and acts to promote lineage plasticity and treatment-induced neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'Salvage Chemotherapy with Cisplatin, Ifosfamide, and Paclitaxel in Aggressive Variant of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

We aimed to define the maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, activity, and pharmacokinetics of oral panobinostat, a pan-deacetylase inhibitor, alone and in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   Sixteen patients were enrolled, eight in each arm. Eligible patients had CRPC and adequate organ function. In arm I, oral panobinostat (20 mg) was administered on days 1, 3, and 5 for 2 consecutive weeks followed by a 1-week break. In arm II, oral panobinostat (15 mg) was administered on the same schedule in combination with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days.  Results:   Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 dyspnea (arm I) and grade 3 neutropenia >7 days (arm II). In arm I, all patients developed progressive disease despite accumulation of acetylated histones in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In arm II, five of eight patients (63%) had a >or=50% decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), including one patient whose disease had previously progressed on docetaxel.  Conclusions:   Oral panobinostat with and without docetaxel is feasible, and docetaxel had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of panobinostat. Since preclinical studies suggest a dose-dependent effect of panobinostat on PSA expression, and other phase I data demonstrate that intravenous panobinostat produces higher peak concentrations (>20- to 30-fold) and area under the curve (3.5x-5x), a decision was made to focus the development of panobinostat on the intravenous formulation to treat CRPC.""","""['Dana Rathkopf', 'Bryan Y Wong', 'Robert W Ross', 'Aseem Anand', 'Erika Tanaka', 'Margaret M Woo', 'Jing Hu', 'Andy Dzik-Jurasz', 'Wei Yang', 'Howard I Scher']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['A phase 2 study of intravenous panobinostat in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Phase Ia/II, two-arm, open-label, dose-escalation study of oral panobinostat administered via two dosing schedules in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.', 'A phase I-II study of docetaxel and atrasentan in men with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Panobinostat for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.', 'Panobinostat: first global approval.', 'Epigenetic and Epitranscriptomic Control in Prostate Cancer.', 'Is more better?

Limited data exist on the pathologic attributes of microcystic change in malignant prostatic glands. The aim of this study was to assess histologic and immunohistologic characteristics of microcystic adenocarcinoma of the prostate. This alteration was defined as cystic dilatation and rounded expansion of the malignant gland profile, with a flat luminal cell lining layer. We identified 53 cases with microcystic change from a survey of 472 radical prostatectomy cases, for an incidence of 11.2%. The greatest diameter of the dilated cancer glands was 0.4 to 0.9 mm, with a mean diameter 10-fold greater than adjacent small malignant glands. The microcystic glands were typically adjacent to usual small acinar adenocarcinoma. Atrophic features were seen at least focally in all cases, although many microcystic adenocarcinoma epithelia exhibited a moderate amount of cytoplasm. Gleason grade 3 was the predominant grade of the adjacent nonmicrocystic malignant glands. Intraluminal crystalloids, and wispy blue intraluminal mucin were seen in all cases. Ninety-six percent of the microcystic cases showed alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase overexpression and all cases showed complete basal cell loss (using 34betaE12 and p63 antibodies) in immunohistochemistry. Microcystic adenocarcinoma of the prostate is a distinctive histomorphologic presentation of prostatic adenocarcinoma that is deceptively benign-looking at low magnifications. Detection of intraluminal crystalloids or wispy blue mucin at low magnification, immunostains for alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase, and basal cells, and a search for adjacent usual small acinar adenocarcinoma are helpful diagnostic aids.

There were 35 genes equally regulated by both drugs. This subset of genes included those with the highest fold change in both treatment groups. In the subset KlK2, TMPRSS2, TRGC2, PMEPA1 and TM4SF1 were downregulated, whereas EGR1, DDC and OPRK1 were upregulated.

Clinical and biopsy parameters were studied as predictors of pIPCa and validated by applying them to d'Amico's low-risk cases: T1c-T2a, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 and biopsy GS <or=6. Appropriate cut-offs were selected.  Results:   280 patients were evaluated; 11.8% (33) had pIPCa, increasing to 23% in low-risk cases. In patients fulfilling d'Amico's low-risk criteria, variables significantly different in pIPCa were: volume, number of positive cylinders (NPC), percentage of positive cylinders (%PC), percentage of the most affected cylinder (%MAC) and uni/bilaterality. In these cases, volume and the NPC increased as independent variables on logistic regression and when adding a volume threshold of 45 cm(3) and 1 positive core, specificity reached 95.8%.  Conclusions:   The incidence of pIPCa in RP specimens is relevant, especially in low-risk cases. Prostate volume and NPC are independent predictors of pIPCa.

The aim of this study was to compare the differences in tumor characteristics of the detected prostate cancers (PCAs) and the detection rate for the two different PSA thresholds and to evaluate if lowering the threshold was justified by any of the detected differences.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of all patients who underwent an 8-core prostate biopsy between January 1999 and December 2004 and had a PSA between 2.5 and 10 ng/ml. Patients with a PSA between 2.5 and 4 ng/ml (group 1, n = 214, mean age 62.0 years) were compared to patients whose PSA was between 4 and 10 ng/ml (group 2, n = 292, mean age 63.2 years). Patients who were older than 75 years or had a suspicious rectal examination were excluded from this study.  Results:   Overall, we detected 120 can-cers in 506 patients (cancer yield 23.7%). The cancer yield in group 1 was significantly lower than in group 2 (17 vs. 28%, p < 0.01). In group 1 significantly less Gleason score >or=7 (p = 0.04) and significantly more potentially insignificant cancers (p = 0.03) were identified. In 80 patients who subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy, final pathology revealed no significant differences between the two PSA groups with regard to high pT stages, Gleason score >or=7 PCA or positive surgical margins, respectively. The difference in the absolute risk of being diagnosed with high-grade PCA between a PSA threshold of 2.5 ng/ml and a PSA threshold of 4 ng/ml was 1%.  Conclusion:   Lowering the PSA threshold for prostate biopsy from 4 to 2.5 ng/ml results in a substantial increase in the number of men who undergo biopsy and may result in an increased detection of potentially insignificant cancers. If total PSA alone is used to determine the need for prostate biopsy, the disadvantages of this lower threshold probably outweigh its potential benefits.""","""['Michael Müntener', 'Urs Kunz', 'Klaus Eichler', 'Milo Puhan', 'Daniel M Schmid', 'Tullio Sulser', 'Räto T Strebel']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Clinical value of prostate specific antigen screening in early detection of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Case report:   We present a 64-year-old Caucasian man with no specific urologic or pain symptoms and with an initial PSA serum value of 21,380 ng/ml. Initial laboratory studies showed chronic anemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase, most likely from bone marrow infiltration due to metastatic disease. Prostate biopsies diagnosed an adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Gleason score 9). Computed tomography (CT) showed multiple liver metastases with retroperitoneal lymph nodes of up to 1 cm. The prostate was moderately enlarged (estimated weight 35 g). Both kidneys were normal (no hydronephrosis present). A bone scintigraphy demonstrated diffuse osseous metastasis. Treatment was initiated with bilateral subcapsular orchiectomy and bicalutamide therapy in an effort to create total androgen blockade. After 3 months of follow-up, the serum concentration of PSA was 29 ng/ml.  Conclusion:   This case presents an asymptomatic prostate cancer patient with bone and liver metastasis, enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes and the highest PSA level published to date.""","""['Zoran Persec', 'Jasminka Persec', 'Tomislav Sović', 'Zeljko Romic', 'Maja Bosnar Herak', 'Zlatko Hrgovic']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Onkologie""","""['Prostate cancer progression in the presence of undetectable or low serum prostate-specific antigen level.', 'Prostate carcinoma staging.

Experimental design:   We determined BRCA mutation prevalence in 832 Ashkenazi Jewish men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 1988 and 2007 and 454 Ashkenazi Jewish controls and compared clinical outcome measures among 26 BRCA mutation carriers and 806 noncarriers. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare age of diagnosis and Gleason score, and logistic regression models were used to determine associations between carrier status, prostate cancer risk, and Gleason score. Hazard ratios (HR) for clinical end points were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   BRCA2 mutations were associated with a 3-fold risk of prostate cancer [odds ratio, 3.18; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.52-6.66; P = 0.002] and presented with more poorly differentiated (Gleason score > or =7) tumors (85% versus 57%; P = 0.0002) compared with non-BRCA-associated prostate cancer. BRCA1 mutations conferred no increased risk. After 7,254 person-years of follow-up, and adjusting for clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and treatment, BRCA2 and BRCA1 mutation carriers had a higher risk of recurrence [HR (95% CI), 2.41 (1.23-4.75) and 4.32 (1.31-13.62), respectively] and prostate cancer-specific death [HR (95% CI), 5.48 (2.03-14.79) and 5.16 (1.09-24.53), respectively] than noncarriers.  Conclusions:   BRCA2 mutation carriers had an increased risk of prostate cancer and a higher histologic grade, and BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were associated with a more aggressive clinical course.

The use of reovirus as a potential treatment modality for prostate cancer has not previously been described, and in this study evidence of in vitro and in vivo activity against prostate cancer was seen both in preclinical models and in six patients. The human prostate carcinoma cell lines PC-3, LN-CaP, and DU-145 exposed to replication-competent reovirus showed evidence of infection as illustrated by viral protein synthesis, cytopathic effect, and release of viral progeny. This oncolytic effect was found to be manifested through apoptosis, as DNA fragmentation, Apo 2.7 expression, Annexin V binding, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage were observed in live reovirus-infected cells, but not in uninfected or dead virus-treated cells. In vivo, hind flank severe combined immunodeficient/nonobese diabetic murine xenograft showed reduction in tumor size when treated with even a single intratumoral injection of reovirus. Finally, intralesional reovirus injections into a cohort of six patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer resulted in minimal side effects and evidence of antitumor activity. Histologic analysis after prostatectomy found a significant CD8 T-cell infiltration within the reovirus-injected areas as well as evidence of increased caspase-3 activity.

Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic agent, exerts antitumoral and antiproliferative action. In this study, the addition of metformin to 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in prostate cancer cells leading to a severe depletion in ATP. The combination of the two drugs was much more harmful for cancer cells than the treatment with metformin or 2DG alone, leading to 96% inhibition of cell viability in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. In contrast, a moderate effect on cell viability was observed in normal prostate epithelial cells. At the cellular level, the combination of metformin and 2DG induced p53-dependent apoptosis via the energy sensor pathway AMP kinase, and the reexpression of a functional p53 in p53-deficient prostate cancer cells restored caspase-3 activity. In addition to apoptosis, the combination of metformin and 2DG arrested prostate cancer cells in G(2)-M. This G(2)-M arrest was independent of p53 and correlated with a stronger decrease in cell viability than obtained with either drug. Finally, metformin inhibited 2DG-induced autophagy, decreased beclin 1 expression, and triggered a switch from a survival process to cell death.

It was previously shown that acidic extracellular pH stimulated peripheral lysosome trafficking, resulting in increased cathepsin B secretion and tumor cell invasion, which was dependent upon sodium-proton exchanger (NHE) activity. We now demonstrate that HGF induced the trafficking of lysosomes to the cell periphery, independent of HGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. HGF-induced anterograde lysosome trafficking depended upon the PI3K pathway, microtubules and RhoA, resulting in increased cathepsin B secretion and invasion by the cells. HGF-induced NHE activity via increased net acid production, and inhibition of NHE activity with 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), or a combination of the NHE1-specific drug cariporide and the NHE3-specific drug s3226 prevented HGF-induced anterograde trafficking and induced retrograde trafficking in HGF-overexpressing cells. EIPA treatment reduced cathepsin B secretion and HGF-induced invasion by the tumor cells. Lysosomes were located more peripherally in Rab7-shRNA-expressing cells and these cells were more invasive than control cells. Overexpression of the Rab7 effector protein, RILP, resulted in a juxtanuclear location of lysosomes and reduced HGF-induced invasion.

Recent prospective studies indicated that enhanced chromosomal aberrations (CAs) frequencies are predictive of gastrointestinal and lung cancers. However, studies on incident cancer patients are lacking; thus, we investigated chromosomal damage in newly diagnosed cancer patients and healthy individuals.  Methods:   We analyzed chromosomal damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes in a group of 300 incident cancer patients (with different malignancies) in comparison with 300 healthy controls.  Results and conclusions:   The frequencies of aberrant cells (ACs) and CAs were significantly higher in patients (2.38 +/- 1.56 and 2.53 +/- 1.69, respectively) as compared with controls (1.81 +/- 1.31 and 1.94 +/- 1.47, respectively, P < 0.01). The percentual difference in chromatid-type aberrations (CTAs) between patients and controls was moderately significant (1.37 +/- 1.20 and 1.11 +/- 0.99, respectively, P <or= 0.05), whereas the difference in chromosome-type aberrations (CSAs) was stronger (1.16 +/- 1.24 versus 0.83 +/- 1.12, P < 0.01). Using binomial logistic regression, the estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence interval for ACs were 1.33 (1.18-1.49), P < 0.01; for CAs, 1.27 (1.14-1.41), P < 0.01; for CTA 1.24 (1.07-1.44), P < 0.01 and for CSA, 1.27 (1.10-1.47), P < 0.01. By stratifying patients for distinct neoplasia, markers of chromosomal damage were significantly enhanced in patients with breast, prostate and head/neck cancers, whereas no effect was recorded in patients affected by gastrointestinal cancers.

The results show that irradiation (4Gy) of DU145 PCa cells pretreated with a combination of 1 mM VPA and 100 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 efficiently suppressed (87.9%) PCa cell proliferation. IR after combined pretreatment resulted in increased DNA double-strand breaks expressed as levels of phosphorylated histone H2A.X, compared with non-treated cells the increase was 58.1% in pretreated cells and 11.8% in non-pretreated cells (p<0.002). Combined pretreatment enhanced IR-induced activation of DNA damage checkpoint kinase Chk2, 39.0% in pretreated cells compared to 23.8% in non-pretreated cells (p<0.05). These molecular changes led to DNA replication blockade, S-phase cell-cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis. Cumulatively, the results indicate that combined pretreatment with VPA and 1,25(OH)2D3 followed by IR is a highly effective treatment for human PCa cells.

RESULTS: We found 12 published cases. Forty two percent of patients presented initially with ascites, in 50% ascites developed later with progressive disease, and 8% had ascites being the only site of recurrence. The response rate to endocrine therapy, including orchiectomy, was 25%. Ascites in these patients conferred a poorer prognosis. CONCLUSION: The development of ascites secondary to prostate cancer, either as an initial manifestation or recurrent disease, is not well known and may be unfamiliar to many physicians. If patients with history of prostate cancer develop malignant effusions, prostate specific antigen (PSA) immunohistostaining of the fluid can serve as a valuable adjunctive study for the diagnosis. This clinical situation becomes particularly important in patients with ascites with a carcinoma of unknown primary. Palliation can be achieved in patients with ascites secondary to prostate cancer using hormone manipulation. Lack of knowledge about this complication of prostate cancer may delay the diagnosis and treatment of this hormonally responsive malignancy.""","""['Muhammad Wasif Saif']""","""[]""","""2005""","""None""","""J Appl Res""","""['Malignant ascites as only manifestation of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Diagnosis of malignant ascites in prostate cancer by measurement of prostate specific antigen.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Early versus deferred androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer.', 'Positron emission tomography for prostate, bladder, and renal cancer.', 'An Improbable Case of Ascites.', 'Malignant Pleural Effusion from Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Case Report with Unusual Cytologic Findings.', 'Malignant Ascites due to Prostatic Adenocarcinoma: An Extremely Rare Manifestation of a Common Disease.', 'Metastatic prostate cancer with malignant ascites: A case report and literature review.', 'Unusual presentations of metastatic prostate carcinoma as detected by anti-3 F-18 FACBC PET/CT.']"""

However, its use as a cancer chemopreventive agent is rather limited, due to the fact that its principal component, glycyrrhizin, is known to induce hypertension. This study determined the effects of a hexane/ethanol extract of G. uralensis (HEGU), which contains undetectable amounts of glycyrrhizin, on the apoptosis of androgen-insensitive DU145 cells. HEGU induced apoptosis and increased the levels of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-7, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). HEGU also induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release to the cytosol. HEGU increased the levels of Fas, death receptor 4 (DR4), cleaved caspase-8, Mcl-1S, and truncated Bid proteins. A caspase-8 inhibitor suppressed HEGU-induced apoptosis. An active fraction of HEGU was separated via column chromatography and the structure of the active compound isoangustone A was identified via 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR. Isoangustone A increased apoptotic cells, the cleavage of PARP and caspases, and the levels of DR4 and Mcl-1S. Transfection with DR4 small interfering RNA attenuated HEGU- and isoangustone A-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that the activation of DR4 contributes to HEGU- and isoangustone A-induced apoptosis of DU145 cells.""","""['Mi Ra Seon', 'Soon Sung Lim', 'Hyun Ju Choi', 'So Young Park', 'Han Jin Cho', 'Jin-Kyu Kim', 'Jongdai Kim', 'Dae Young Kwon', 'Jung Han Yoon Park']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Nutr Food Res""","""['Hexane/ethanol extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis licorice suppresses doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in H9c2 rat cardiac myoblasts.', 'Hexane/ethanol extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis and its active compound isoangustone A induce G1 cycle arrest in DU145 human prostate and 4T1 murine mammary cancer cells.', 'Apoptosis of DU145 human prostate cancer cells induced by dehydrocostus lactone isolated from the root of Saussurea lappa.', 'Drugs interfering with apoptosis in breast cancer.', 'Chemopreventive Effects of Licorice and Its Components.', 'Inhibition by components of Glycyrrhiza uralensis of 3CLpro and HCoV-OC43 proliferation.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Dehydroglyasperin D Suppresses Melanin Synthesis through MITF Degradation in Melanocytes.', 'Synthetic and Naturally Occurring Heterocyclic Anticancer Compounds with Multiple Biological Targets.', 'The Most Competent Plant-Derived Natural Products for Targeting Apoptosis in Cancer Therapy.']"""

Recent data suggest that carboplatin may be effective in combination with docetaxel in this setting; however, the optimal docetaxel/carboplatin-based regimen is still unclear.  Aim of the study:   We identified 43 consecutive patients with DRPC treated with carboplatin (AUC5 d1) and docetaxel (35 mg/m(2) d1, 8, 15 q4w i.v.) as a second-line or subsequent salvage chemotherapy until discontinuation of therapy due to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Results:   Decreased prostate-specific antigen (> or =50% PSA) was observed in 22/43 (51.2%, 95% CI, 35.5, 66.7%) patients, with > or =90% reduction in 12/43 patients (27.9%). At the time of analysis, the median follow-up time for all patients was 10.4 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients was 6.5 months (95% CI 4.1, 8.9), and median overall survival (OS) was 15.8 months (95% CI 12.1, 18.5). In PSA responders, PFS was 9.5 (95% CI 8.2, 19.0) months versus 3.3 (95% CI 2.6, 4.0) months in PSA non-responders (P < 0.0001; hazard ratio (HR) 0.108) and OS was 24.4 months (95% CI 19.5, 29.4) versus 7.8 (95% CI 5.2, 10.3) months (P = 0.001; HR 0.232).

PKCvarepsilon-mediated oncogenic activity is linked to its ability to promote cell survival. However, the mechanisms by which PKCvarepsilon signals cell survival remain elusive. We found that signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3), which is constitutively activated in a wide variety of human cancers, is a protein partner of PKCvarepsilon. Stat3 has two conserved amino-acid (Tyr705 and Ser727) residues, which are phosphorylated during Stat3 activation.

We found that dasatinib inhibited proliferation of primary mouse osteoblasts isolated from mouse calvaria and the immortalized MC3T3-E1 cell line. In calvarial osteoblasts from Col-luc transgenic mice carrying osteoblast-specific Col1alpha1 promoter reporter, luciferase activity was inhibited. Dasatinib also inhibited fibroblast growth factor-2-induced osteoblast proliferation, but strongly promoted osteoblast differentiation, as reflected by stimulation of alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin secretion and osteoblast mineralization. To determine how dasatinib blocks proliferative signaling in osteoblasts, we analyzed the expression of a panel of tyrosine kinases, including Src, Lyn, Fyn, Yes and Abl, in osteoblasts. In the Src family kinases, only Src was activated at a high level. Abl was expressed at a low level in osteoblasts. Phosphorylation of Src-Y419 or Abl-Y245 was inhibited by dasatinib treatment.

As a component of co-repressor complexes, LSD1 contributes to target gene repression by removing mono- and dimethyl marks from lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4). In contrast, during androgen receptor (AR)-activated gene expression, LSD1 removes mono- and dimethyl marks from lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9). Yet, the mechanisms that control this dual specificity of demethylation are unknown. Here we show that phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 6 (H3T6) by protein kinase C beta I (PKCbeta(I), also known as PRKCbeta) is the key event that prevents LSD1 from demethylating H3K4 during AR-dependent gene activation. In vitro, histone H3 peptides methylated at lysine 4 and phosphorylated at threonine 6 are no longer LSD1 substrates. In vivo, PKCbeta(I) co-localizes with AR and LSD1 on target gene promoters and phosphorylates H3T6 after androgen-induced gene expression. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of PKCbeta(I) abrogates H3T6 phosphorylation, enhances demethylation at H3K4, and inhibits AR-dependent transcription. Activation of PKCbeta(I) requires androgen-dependent recruitment of the gatekeeper kinase protein kinase C (PKC)-related kinase 1 (PRK1). Notably, increased levels of PKCbeta(I) and phosphorylated H3T6 (H3T6ph) positively correlate with high Gleason scores of prostate carcinomas, and inhibition of PKCbeta(I) blocks AR-induced tumour cell proliferation in vitro and cancer progression of tumour xenografts in vivo.

Eicosanoids are synthesized from intracellular arachidonic acid (AA), which is released from membrane glycerophospholipids mainly by the action of cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (cPLA(2)alpha). Thus, targeting cPLA(2)alpha has been proposed as a treatment option. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cPLA(2)alpha inhibition on cyclooxygenase (COX) expression and PGE(2) production. Inhibition of cPLA(2)alpha expression by siRNA or activity by Efipladib in prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP) led to an increase in COX-1 protein and PGE(2) levels in a dose-dependent manner from 24 to 72 h. The COX-2 response was less evident. Efipladib treatment increased COX-1 promoter transcriptional activity without changing the rate of COX-1 protein degradation. Treatment with Efipladib also led to a decrease in most LOX products (HETEs) as measured by LC/MS/MS. Replenishing 5- and 12-HETEs abolished Efipladib-induced COX-1 and PGE(2) levels. Decreasing 5- and 12-HETE production, as a result of treating cells with inhibitors MK886 and Baicalein, respectively, mimicked the effect of Efipladib on COX-1 and PGE(2) levels. Hence, the mechanism underlying the cPLA(2)alpha inhibition-induced COX-1 is likely due to a decrease in LOX products, which may exert a negative feedback on COX-1 gene expression in prostate cancer cells.

Materials and methods:   70 patients with histologically proven prostate cancer were examined with T2w eMRI before radical prostatectomy at a 1.5T scanner. For evaluation of eMRI, two radiologists evaluated each tumor focus within the gland. After radical prostatectomy, the prostates were prepared as whole-mount sections, according to transversal T2w eMRI. For each slice, tumor surroundings were marked and compared with eMRI. Based on whole-mount section, 315 slices were evaluated and 533 tumor lesions were documented.  Results:   Based on the T2w eMRI, 213 tumor lesions were described. In 137/213, histology could prove these lesions.

Objective:   To determine the benefit of starting pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFME) 30d before RP and of continuing PFME postoperatively for early recovery of continence.  Design, setting, and participants:   A randomised, prospective study was designed. Men with localised prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent an open radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) at our department of urology were included.  Intervention:   Patients were randomised to start PFME preoperatively and continue postoperatively (active group: A) or to start PFME postoperatively alone (control group: B).  Measurements:   The primary outcome measure was self-reported continence after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were assessed by degree of UI based on a 24-h pad test and QoL instruments (International Continence Society [ICS] male short form [SF]).  Results and limitations:   Of 143 men evaluated for the study, 118 were randomised either to start PFME preoperatively and continue postoperatively (group A; n=59) or to start postoperative PFME (group B; n=59). After 1 mo, 44.1% (26 of 59) of patients were continent in group A, while 20.3% (12 of 59) were continent in group B (p=0.018).

In age-adjusted logistic regression analyses, patients who performed preoperative PFME had a 0.41-fold lower risk of being incontinent 1 mo after RP and a 0.38-fold lower risk of being incontinent 3 mo after RP (p≤0.001).

Two prognostic models were examined: a risk group model (low-, intermediate-, and high-risk) and PSA-level groupings. High-risk patients with hormonal therapy (HT) were analyzed separately. Outcome variable was freedom from failure (FFF) (clinical failure or PSA nadir+2 microg/L).  Results:   In relation to the advantage of high-dose radiotherapy, intermediate-risk patients benefited most from dose escalation.

DTA-C-CPE-induced cytotoxicity was attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with C-CPE but not bovine serum albumin, indicating that DTA-C-CPE may bind to CL-4-expressing L cells through its C-CPE domain. To evaluate the specificity of DTA-C-CPE, we examined its cytotoxic effects in L cells that express CL-1, -2, -4 or -5. We found that DTA-C-CPE was toxic to only CL-4-expressing L cells.

Senescence induced by oncogenes or by loss of tumour suppressor genes is thought to critically depend on induction of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway. The Skp2 E3-ubiquitin ligase can act as a proto-oncogene and its aberrant overexpression is frequently observed in human cancers. Here we show that although Skp2 inactivation on its own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant proto-oncogenic signals as well as inactivation of tumour suppressor genes do trigger a potent, tumour-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2.

Screening cell lines for susceptibility to large scale processing conditions has become of increasing importance; innovators do not wish to face the quandary of clinically efficacious cell lines that show poor manufacturability. We have previously described an ultra scale-down method for assessing the impact of the hydrodynamic environment on human cells (McCoy et al., 2009). This body of work describes the validation of this experimental approach using a second, clinically tested, human prostate cancer cell line and describes an additional level of sub-population characterisation. The small-scale conditions set were similar to those expected in downstream process, formulation and vial filling operations with maximum shear rates ranging from 30 x 10(3) to 90 x 10(3) s(-1)(equivalent maximum power dissipation rates of 1.5 x 10(3) to 14 x 10(3) W kg(-1)). Changes to critical cell quality attributes such as membrane integrity retention, cell surface marker staining levels (CD9, CD59, CD147) and cell surface marker density is described. Evaluation of two sub-populations which are formed in response to shear showed distinct staining profiles.

This study examines whether cancer survivors receive adequate screening and preventative care in UK primary care.  Patients and methods:   We identified a cohort of long-term survivors of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer with at least a 5-year survival using the General Practice Research Database, with controls matched for age, gender and practice. We compared adherence with cancer screening and the use of preventative care between cancer survivors and controls.  Results:   The cancer survivors' cohort consisted of 18 612 breast, 5764 colorectal and 4868 prostate cancer survivors. Most cancer survivors receive cancer screening at the same levels as controls, except for breast cancer survivors who were less likely to receive a mammogram than controls (OR=0.78, 95% CI: 0.66-0.92). Long-term cancer survivors received comparable levels of influenza vaccinations and cholesterol tests, but breast (OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.87) and prostate cancer survivors (OR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.57-0.87) were less likely to receive a blood pressure test. All survivors were more likely to receive bone densitometry.  Conclusion:   The provision and uptake of preventive care in a primary care setting in the United Kingdom is comparable between the survivors of three common cancers and those who have not had cancer.

These agents include clinically important chemotherapies, including taxanes (paclitaxel (Taxol), docetaxel (Taxotere)) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine (Oncovin), vinblastine). Taxanes are a standard component of treatment for many malignancies, often in conjunction with other cytotoxic agents. However, the optimal sequencing of these treatments and whether efficacy may be influenced by in vitro cellular growth conditions remain incompletely investigated. Yet such preclinical investigations may guide clinical decision making. We therefore studied the effect of cell density on rapid killing by paclitaxel and vincristine. Breast, ovarian and prostate cancer cells were sensitive to rapid killing by either agent when grown at low density, but were markedly resistant when grown at high density, i.e. nearly confluent. The resistance of densely growing cells to rapid killing by these drugs translated to increased clonogenic survival. Pretreatment of densely growing cancer cells with cisplatin followed by paclitaxel, partially reversed the treatment resistance. Gene ontology associations from microarray analyses of cells grown at low and high density, suggested roles for membrane signal transduction and adhesion, but potentially also DNA damage repair and metabolism. Taken together, the treatment resistance at higher cell density may be associated with a lower proportion of active cycling in cells growing at high density as well as transduction of survival signals induced by increased cell-cell adhesion. Collectively these findings suggest mechanisms by which growth conditions may contribute to resistance to rapid killing by microtubule-disrupting drugs.""","""['Jay F Dorsey', 'Melissa L Dowling', 'Mijin Kim', 'Ranh Voong', 'Lawrence J Solin', 'Gary D Kao']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['6α-Acetoxyanopterine: A Novel Structure Class of Mitotic Inhibitor Disrupting Microtubule Dynamics in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Inactivation of the mitotic checkpoint as a determinant of the efficacy of microtubule-targeted drugs in killing human cancer cells.', 'Sensitivity of docetaxel-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells to microtubule-destabilizing agents including vinca alkaloids and colchicine-site binding agents.', 'Microtubule inhibitors: Differentiating tubulin-inhibiting agents based on mechanisms of action, clinical activity, and resistance.', 'Microtubule Targeting Agents as Cancer Chemotherapeutics: An Overview of Molecular Hybrids as Stabilizing and Destabilizing Agents.', 'Guanylate-binding proteins induce apoptosis of leukemia cells by regulating MCL-1 and BAK.', 'LXRβ controls glioblastoma cell growth, lipid balance, and immune modulation independently of ABCA1.', 'Pharmacological treatment with inhibitors of nuclear export enhances the antitumor activity of docetaxel in human prostate cancer.', 'Disabled cell density sensing leads to dysregulated cholesterol synthesis in glioblastoma.', 'Anti-Neoplastic Cytotoxicity of Gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-anti-HER2/neu in Combination with Griseofulvin against Chemotherapeutic-Resistant Mammary Adenocarcinoma (SKBr-3).']"""

The aim of this prospective study was to establish the influence of operative parameters on outcomes after transurethral resection of the prostate. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this prospective case series study, 89 patients underwent transurethral resection of the prostate. The standardized protocol was used to investigate the impact of operative parameters (resected tissue weight, residual prostate weight, and residual prostatic weight ratio [total prostate volume - resected tissue weight / total prostate volume]) on outcomes after six months following transurethral resection of the prostate. The evaluation of treatment efficacy was done using the criteria of the Second International Consultation on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. All postoperative results were categorized as excellent, good, fair, or none. Treatment was considered effective when the postoperative results were excellent and good, and ineffective when results were fair and none. RESULTS. Treatment was effective for 85.4% and ineffective for 14.6% of the patients. The univariate analysis of operative parameters detected the residual prostatic weight ratio (cutoff value, 0.71; P<0.001; sensitivity, 0.62; specificity, 0.96; OR, 39.47) as the strongest independent predictor of ineffective outcome. Logistic regression analysis revealed two important parameters of unfavorable outcomes: residual prostatic weight ratio (cutoff value, 0.71; P<0.001; OR, 62.16) and residual prostate weight (cutoff value, 26.6 mL; P=0.013; OR, 9.98). When the values of both these parameters were lower than their cutoff values, the probability of an ineffective outcome was reduced to 3%; however, when they were higher, the probability of an unfavorable outcome was increased to 95%.

We now show that SFN inhibits constitutive and interleukin-6 (IL-6)-inducible activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is an oncogenic transcription factor activated in many human malignancies, including prostate cancer. Growth-suppressive concentrations of SFN (20 and 40 micromol/L) decreased constitutive (DU145 cells) and IL-6-induced (DU145 and LNCaP cells) phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr(705)) as well as its upstream regulator Janus-activated kinase 2 (Tyr(1007/1008)). Exposure of DU145 and LNCaP cells to SFN resulted in suppression of (a) IL-6-induced transcriptional activity of STAT3 as judged by luciferase reporter assay and (b) nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT3 as revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Levels of many STAT3-regulated gene products, including Bcl-2, cyclin D1, and survivin, were also reduced in SFN-treated cells. The IL-6-mediated activation of STAT3 conferred partial but marked protection against SFN-induced apoptosis as evidenced by cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and procaspase-3. Furthermore, knockdown of STAT3 protein using small interfering RNA resulted in a modest yet statistically significant increase in SFN-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation in DU145 cells. Suppression of STAT3 activation was also observed in cells treated with naturally occurring analogues of SFN.

We hypothesize that introducing additional reactive oxygen species (ROS) insults or suppressing antioxidant capacity may selectively enhance cancer cell killing by oxidative stress-generating agents through stress overload or stress sensitization, whereas normal cells may be able to maintain redox homeostasis under exogenous ROS by adaptive response. Here, we show that parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone, selectively exhibits a radiosensitization effect on prostate cancer PC3 cells but not on normal prostate epithelial PrEC cells. Parthenolide causes oxidative stress in PC3 cells but not in PrEC cells, as determined by the oxidation of the ROS-sensitive probe H(2)DCFDA and intracellular reduced thiol and disulfide levels. In PC3 but not PrEC cells, parthenolide activates NADPH oxidase, leading to a decrease in the level of reduced thioredoxin, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and consequent FOXO3a phosphorylation, which results in the downregulation of FOXO3a targets antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase. Importantly, when combined with radiation, parthenolide further increases ROS levels in PC3 cells whereas it decreases radiation-induced oxidative stress in PrEC cells, possibly by increasing reduced glutathione levels. Together, the results show that parthenolide selectively activates NADPH oxidase and mediates intense oxidative stress in prostate cancer cells by both increasing ROS generation and decreasing antioxidant defense capacity.

Chemotherapeutic approaches that have been used successfully for both the prevention and treatment of a number of human malignancies have arisen from the identification of specific agents and appropriate molecular targets. Although drug-metabolizing enzymes have historically been targeted in attempts to block the initial, genotoxic events associated with the carcinogenic process, emerging evidence supports the idea that manipulating drug-metabolizing enzymes may also be an effective strategy to be used for treating tumor progression, invasion, and, perhaps, metastasis. This report summarizes a symposium that presents some recent progress in this area. One area of emphasis is the development of a CYP17 inhibitor for treatment of prostate cancer that may also have androgen-independent anticancer activity at higher concentrations. A second focus is the use of a mouse model to investigate the effects of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and Cyp1b1 status and chemopreventative agents on transplacental cancer.

Proton radiation may attenuate adverse effects.  Objective:   To determine long-term, patient-reported, dose-related toxicity.  Design, setting, and patients:   We performed a post hoc cross-sectional survey of surviving participants in the Proton Radiation Oncology Group (PROG) 9509--a randomized trial comparing 70.2 Gy vs 79.2 Gy of combined photon and proton radiation for 393 men with clinically localized prostate cancer (stage T1b-T2b, prostate-specific antigen <15 ng/mL, and no radiographic evidence of metastasis). The estimated 10-year biochemical progression rate for patients receiving standard dose was 32% (95% confidence interval, 26%-39%) compared with 17% (95% confidence interval, 11%-23%) for patients receiving high dose (P < .001). We surveyed 280 of the surviving 337 patients (83%) from April 2007 to September 2008.  Main outcome measures:   Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices, a validated measure of urinary incontinence, urinary obstruction and irritation, bowel problems, and sexual dysfunction, and related quality-of-life instruments.  Results:   At a median of 9.4 years after treatment (range, 7.4-12.1 years), participants' demographic and clinical characteristics were similar. Patient-reported outcomes were reported as mean (SD) scale score for standard dose vs high dose: urinary obstruction/irritation (23.3 [13.7] vs 24.6 [14.0]; P = .36), urinary incontinence (10.6 [17.7] vs 9.7 [15.8]; P = .99), bowel problems (7.7 [7.8] vs 7.9 [9.1]; P = .70), sexual dysfunction (68.2 [34.6] vs 65.9 [34.7]; P = .65), and most other outcomes were also similar, although patients receiving standard dose whose cancers had more often progressed expressed less confidence that their cancers were under control (mean [SD] scale score for standard dose, 76.0 [25.4] vs high dose, 86.2 [17.9]; P < .001). Many patients characterized their urinary and bowel function as normal despite reporting symptoms that, for other prostate cancer patients before and early after cancer treatment, caused substantial distress.

One factor that has been implicated in the metastatic process is the cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin. In this study, we investigated if the expression of N-cadherin was influenced by androgen deprivation and was associated with metastasis in prostate cancer. The effect of androgen deprivation on N-cadherin expression was initially studied in androgen-dependent (AD) LNCaP and androgen-independent (AI) LNCaP-19 and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. Expression of N-cadherin increased in the absence of androgens in AI LNCaP-19 primary tumors and metastases and also in vitro, but not in AI PC-3 tumors, indicating a possible involvement of the androgen receptor in the regulation of N-cadherin. N-cadherin was absent in AD LNCaP tumors. No clear associations between N-cadherin and factors related with epithelial-mesenchymal transition or neuroendocrine differentiation could be established. In addition, N-cadherin was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in human prostate tumors. Expression of N-cadherin was more frequently found in tumors from patients treated with ADT than in tumors from patients with no prior hormonal treatment. N-cadherin expression was also associated with metastasis and Gleason score. Furthermore, increased N-cadherin was detected in prostate cancer biopsies already 3 months after initiation of ADT when tumors were in a regressed state. In summary the results indicate that androgen deprivation induces N-cadherin in prostate tumors. Moreover, N-cadherin was increased in castration-resistant tumors in patients with established metastases. This might indicate that castration induces molecular alterations in the tumor cells, resulting in a more invasive and metastatic phenotype.""","""['Karin Jennbacken', 'Tajana Tesan', 'Wanzhong Wang', 'Heléne Gustavsson', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Karin Welén']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['NE-10 neuroendocrine cancer promotes the LNCaP xenograft growth in castrated mice.', 'Androgen deprivation induces selective outgrowth of aggressive hormone-refractory prostate cancer clones expressing distinct cellular and molecular properties not present in parental androgen-dependent cancer cells.', 'Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 inhibits proliferation and metastatic potential in prostate cancer.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Continued targeting of androgen receptor signalling: a rational and efficacious therapeutic strategy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus and prostate cancer risk: a pool of cohort studies and Mendelian randomization analysis.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'Phenotypic Plasticity - Alternate Transcriptional Programs Driving Treatment Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgens, aging, and prostate health.', 'Small interfering RNA targeting N-cadherin regulates cell proliferation and migration in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed a Swedish Watchful Waiting cohort with up to 30 years of clinical follow up using a novel method for gene expression profiling. This cDNA-mediated annealing, selection, ligation, and extension (DASL) method enabled the use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) samples taken at the time of the initial diagnosis. We determined the expression profiles of 6100 genes for 281 men divided in two extreme groups: men who died of prostate cancer and men who survived more than 10 years without metastases (lethals and indolents, respectively). Several statistical and machine learning models using clinical and molecular features were evaluated for their ability to distinguish lethal from indolent cases.  Results:   Surprisingly, none of the predictive models using molecular profiles significantly improved over models using clinical variables only. Additional computational analysis confirmed that molecular heterogeneity within both the lethal and indolent classes is widespread in prostate cancer as compared to other types of tumors.

There is a paucity of comparative studies regarding the difference in the erectile function and penile size of patients undergoing HIFU or TCAP.  Aim:   The aim of this study is to compare the erectile function and penile size of patients undergoing HIFU or TCAP.  Methods:   Patients with a preoperative erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) score ≥ 26 were prospectively included. All patients were preoperatively evaluated by IIEF-EF and penile color Doppler ultrasound. Penile length and circumference were measured in flaccidity and at maximum erection. At 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 months after surgery, patients were assessed with the same protocol.  Main outcome measures:   IIEF-EF score, penile color Doppler ultrasound, penile length, and circumference at different time points.  Results:   There were 55 patients in the HIFU group and 47 in the TCAP group. At each time point, there were significant differences in mean IIEF-EF scores and penile color Doppler results between the two groups. At 36 months, TCAP patients experienced lower erectile function recovery rate compared with HIFU patients (TCAP=46.8%; HIFU=65.5%; P=0.021). No significant decreases in penile length and circumference were found in the two groups (all P values ≥ 0.05).  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrate TCAP caused significantly decreased erectile function than HIFU. We found no change in penile size after HIFU or TCAP.

Methods:   This study assessed the association of dietary components, particularly dairy products and dietary calcium, on prostate cancer risk in a case-control study of 197 cases and an equal number of individually matched controls recruited in Montreal, Canada. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered in which the usual consumption frequency and amounts consumed of more than 200 food items were recorded.  Results:   We found a twofold increased risk of prostate cancer associated with an increased intake of dairy products {Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.19; 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.22-3.94}. A significant trend of decreasing prostate cancer risk with higher intake was found for legumes, nuts, finfish/shellfish and for alpha-tocopherol after adjustment for calcium intake. Milk was the only dairy product significantly associated with prostate cancer risk, with OR = 2.27; 95% CI (1.25-4.09) for the highest versus lowest quartiles of consumption. Calcium, the main micronutrient contained in dairy products, showed only a borderline association with prostate cancer risk (P = 0.09), with slightly higher risk for higher calcium intake.

Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Dax1 transcripts are expressed at higher levels in NT-2 and PrEC cells than in PC-3 cells. Co-transfection analyses showed that YY1 and Rex1 are positive regulators of hRex1 transcription in NT-2 and PrEC cells, whereas Nanog is not. Serial deletion constructs of the hRex1 promoter were created and analyzed, by which we identified a potential negative regulatory site that is located between -1 and -0.4 kb of the hRex1 promoter. We also delineated regions of the hRex1 promoter between -0.4 kb and the TSS that, when mutated, reduced transcriptional activation; these are putative Rex1 binding sites. Mutation of a putative Rex1 binding site in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) resulted in reduced protein binding. Taken together, our results indicate that hRex1 binds to the hRex1 promoter region at -298 bp and positively regulates hRex1 transcription, but that this regulation is lost in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. This lack of positive transcriptional regulation by the hRex1 protein may be responsible for the lack of Rex1 expression in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.""","""['Mi-Young Lee', 'Ailan Lu', 'Lorraine J Gudas']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Transcriptional activation of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) gene via STAT3 is increased in F9 REX1 (ZFP-42) knockout teratocarcinoma stem cells relative to wild-type cells.', 'The putative human stem cell marker, Rex-1 (Zfp42): structural classification and expression in normal human epithelial and carcinoma cell cultures.', 'Retinoic acid receptors and GATA transcription factors activate the transcription of the human lecithin:retinol acyltransferase gene.', 'Yin Yang 1 is associated with cancer stem cell transcription factors (SOX2, OCT4, BMI1) and clinical implication.', 'Pluripotent genes in avian stem cells.', 'A ZFP42/MARK2 regulatory network reduces the damage of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma: a study based on GEO dataset and in vitro experiments.', 'The long and short non-coding RNAs modulating EZH2 signaling in cancer.', 'REX1 promotes EMT-induced cell metastasis by activating the JAK2/STAT3-signaling pathway by targeting SOCS1 in cervical cancer.', 'The Role of Nuclear Receptors in Prostate Cancer.', 'Mechanisms Regulating Stemness and Differentiation in Embryonal Carcinoma Cells.']"""

However, despite a favorable initial response, some cancer cells become resistant and develop into fatal metastatic disease. Here we report that we can specifically target HER-2 over-expressing and trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells by using an engineered lentivirus which has trastuzumab bound to its envelope. In vitro, this lentiviral construct mediated both the expression of reporter genes, such as enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and firefly luciferase, as well as the therapeutic gene, herpes thymidine kinase (hTK), in HER-2 over-expressing cells. Subsequent application of the pro-drug ganciclovir selectively killed breast cancer cells in which lentivirus mediated expression of hTK. In vivo, we successfully targeted the expression of firefly luciferase to trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer tumors established in nude mice. Furthermore, we found that systemic administration of trastuzumab-bound lentivirus led to expression of EGFP in circulating trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. In conclusion, HER-2 over-expressing breast cancer cells resistant to trastuzumab can be targeted for selective gene expression and destruction by viruses with envelope-proteins engineered to bind to this antibody.""","""['Kai-xin Zhang', 'Connie Kim', 'Elaine Chow', 'Irvin S Y Chen', 'William Jia', 'Paul S Rennie']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Lentiviruses with trastuzumab bound to their envelopes can target and kill prostate cancer cells.', 'Retargeting of adenoviral gene delivery via Herceptin-PEG-adenovirus conjugates to breast cancer cells.', 'Targeting fatty acid synthase-driven lipid rafts: a novel strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms of disease: understanding resistance to HER2-targeted therapy in human breast cancer.', 'Trastuzumab: targeted therapy for the management of HER-2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.', 'Versatile targeting system for lentiviral vectors involving biotinylated targeting molecules.', 'The Engineering of a Novel Ligand in gH Confers to HSV an Expanded Tropism Independent of gD Activation by Its Receptors.', 'In vivo gene transfer targeting in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with cell surface antigens.', 'DARPins: an efficient targeting domain for lentiviral vectors.']"""

We examined temporal trends in death rates from all-cancer and the 19 most common cancers in the United States from 1970-2006.  Methodology/principal findings:   We analyzed trends in age-standardized death rates (per 100,000) for all cancers combined, the four most common cancers, and 15 other sites from 1970-2006 in the United States using joinpoint regression model. The age-standardized death rate for all-cancers combined in men increased from 249.3 in 1970 to 279.8 in 1990, and then decreased to 221.1 in 2006, yielding a net decline of 21% and 11% from the 1990 and 1970 rates, respectively. Similarly, the all-cancer death rate in women increased from 163.0 in 1970 to 175.3 in 1991 and then decreased to 153.7 in 2006, a net decline of 12% and 6% from the 1991 and 1970 rates, respectively. These decreases since 1990/91 translate to preventing of 561,400 cancer deaths in men and 205,700 deaths in women. The decrease in death rates from all-cancers involved all ages and racial/ethnic groups. Death rates decreased for 15 of the 19 cancer sites, including the four major cancers, with lung, colorectum and prostate cancers in men and breast and colorectum cancers in women.  Conclusions/significance:   Progress in reducing cancer death rates is evident whether measured against baseline rates in 1970 or in 1990. The downturn in cancer death rates since 1990 result mostly from reductions in tobacco use, increased screening allowing early detection of several cancers, and modest to large improvements in treatment for specific cancers.

Design:   I developed a mathematical model to estimate the prevalence of NMSC in the United States in 2007. This model used age-specific incidence data adjusted to reflect changes in incidence from 1957 to 2006, the age distribution of the population from 1957 to 2006, and the likelihood that an incident tumor was the first ever for that person. I performed sensitivity analyses that varied my assumption about change in incidence over time and proportion of incident tumors that were a first-ever NMSC for an individual. I used standard methods for analysis of survey data to calculate the number of persons who report a history of the selected cancers and published Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) estimates for incidence-based estimates for prevalence of cancers other than NMSC.  Setting:   National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 2007 data, National Cancer Institute Skin Cancer Incidence data (1977-1978), and SEER data. Main Outcome Measure Incidence-based estimate of prevalence of NMSC and melanoma and patient reports of a history of skin and selected other cancers.  Results:   Approximately 13 million white non-Hispanics living in the United States at the beginning of 2007 have had at least 1 NMSC. About 1 in 5 seventy-year-olds have had NMSCs, and most of those affected have had multiple NMSCs. In the 2007 NHIS estimates, only 5 million persons report a history of skin cancer, less than half the number estimated based on incidence and survival data.  Conclusions:   My incidence-based model indicates that the prevalence of a skin cancer history is about 5 times higher than that of breast or prostate cancer and greater than the 31-year prevalence of all other cancers combined.

Participants:   We included 89 515 patients who survived at least 2 months after their initial melanoma diagnosis.  Results:   Of the patients with melanoma, 10 857 (12.1%) developed 1 or more subsequent primary cancers. The overall risk of a subsequent primary cancer increased by 28% (observed to expected [O:E] ratio = 1.28). One quarter of the cancers were subsequent primary melanomas (O:E = 8.61). Women with head and neck melanoma and patients younger than 30 had markedly increased risks (O:E = 13.22 and 13.40, respectively) of developing a subsequent melanoma. Second melanomas were more likely to be thin than were the first of multiple primary melanomas (thickness at diagnosis <1.00 mm, 77.9% vs 70.3%, respectively; P < .001). Melanoma survivors had increased risk of developing several cancers; the most common cancers with elevated risks were breast, prostate, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (O:E = 1.10, 1.15, and 1.25, respectively).  Conclusions:   Melanoma survivors have an approximately 9-fold increased risk of developing subsequent melanoma compared with the general population. The risk remains elevated more than 20 years after the initial melanoma diagnosis. This increased risk may be owing to behavioral factors, genetic susceptibility, or medical surveillance. Although the percentage of subsequent primary melanomas thicker than 1 mm is lower than for the first of multiple primary melanomas, it is still substantial.

LC/MS/MS using label-free proteomics and immunoblotting showed that p85 was associated primarily with p110beta and p110delta.

Basal tyrosine phosphorylation of p110beta and p110delta could be blocked by c-Src inhibitors, but this did not suppress PI3K activity, which was similarly independent of Ras.

Continuous dose readings were performed every 150 ms, with a gap between consecutive readings of <0.3 ms. We first studied the effect of electron multiplication. We then assessed system performance in acrylic and anthropomorphic pelvic phantoms.  Results:   The PSDs were compatible with clinical rectal balloons and were easily inserted into the anthropomorphic phantom. With an electron multiplication average gain factor of 40, a twofold increase in the signal/noise ratio was observed, making near real-time dosimetry feasible.

Methods and materials:   A total of 205 patients with T1 (23%) and T2 (77%) prostate cancer were treated with conventional external beam radiation therapy from 1991 to 1993 at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Of the patients, 62 had adequate and suitable-stained tumor material for Survivin analysis. Median follow-up was 102 months (range, 5-127 months). Distant failure was determined on the basis of clinical criteria. In preclinical studies, replication-deficient adenovirus encoding phosphorylation-defective Survivin Thr34→Ala dominant-negative mutant pAd-S(T34A) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to inhibit Survivin in prostate cancer models, and the cell motility, morphology, and metastasis were investigated.  Results:   Our correlative data on men with early-stage (T1/T2) prostate cancers treated at Massachusetts General Hospital by definitive radiotherapy indicated that overexpression of Survivin (positive staining in ≥10% cells) was associated with a significantly increased risk for the subsequent development of distant metastasis (p = 0.016) in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, overexpression of Survivin remained an independent predictor of distant metastasis (p = 0.008). The inhibition of Survivin dramatically inhibited invasiveness of prostate cancer cells in the in vitro invasion assay and spontaneous metastasis in the Dunning prostate cancer in vivo model. Furthermore, attenuation of Survivin resulted in changes in the microtubule cytoskeleton, loss of cellular polarity, and loss of motility.  Conclusions:   This study suggests that Survivin may be a potentially important prognostic marker and promising therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Min Zhang', 'John J Coen', 'Yoshiyuki Suzuki', 'Michael R Siedow', 'Andrzej Niemierko', 'Li-Yan Khor', 'Alan Pollack', 'Yifen Zhang', 'Anthony L Zietman', 'William U Shipley', 'Arnab Chakravarti']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Adenovirus-mediated inhibition of survivin expression sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo.', 'Therapeutic targeting of the survivin pathway in cancer: initiation of mitochondrial apoptosis and suppression of tumor-associated angiogenesis.', 'Survivin mediates resistance to antiandrogen therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Survivin is not only a death encounter but also a survival protein for invading tumor cells.', 'The role of survivin for radiation therapy.

Patients and methods:   The study included 13 patients with evidence of biochemical recurrence after EBRT who had undergone mp-MRI and prostate mapping. Each MRI scan (consisting of T1/T2 weighting, dynamic contrast enhancement and diffusion weighting) was reported by two expert uro-radiologists. Each prostate was divided into four regions of interest (ROI), generating 52 paired datasets for analysis.  Results:   The mean (range) age of the men was 65.5 (55-70) years, the mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before EBRT was 36.6 (4.5-150) ng/mL, the mean time from EBRT to biochemical recurrence was 5.7 (3-10) years and the mean PSA level at the time of recurrence was 7.1 (0.83-27.9) ng/mL. Eleven men had histological evidence of recurrence, with 23 of 52 ROIs involved with cancer.

Inter-observer variability was measured by calculating κ coefficients, which showed fair and moderate agreement between radiologists.

PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 2048 consecutive men underwent LRP for localized prostate cancer in one institution. Comorbidity was assessed using the Charlson index. Short-term postoperative complications, transfusion rate, duration of hospital stay, long-term continence and oncological outcome were analysed by age and comorbidity classes. RESULTS Of the 2048 men, 297 were aged ≥ 70 years and 281 had a Charlson index of >0 (mainly diabetes 31%, chronic pulmonary disease 26%, prior other nonmetastatic cancer 16%, prior myocardial infarction 12%). Compared with younger men, senior men had significantly higher pathological stages and tumor grades. Of those 297 men aged ≥ 70 years, 90 (30.3%) developed biochemical relapse, none died from prostate cancer and five (1.7%) died from another cause over a median follow-up of 5 years. The occurrence and severity of short-term postoperative complications were more strongly related to comorbidity than chronological age. Multivariate analysis with stepwise regression confirmed that most important predictors of short-term postoperative complications were a Charlson index of ≥ 2, prostate weight of >80 g, obesity and age of ≥ 70 years. Postoperative continence significantly declined with age (ranging from 87% in men aged <60 years to 67.5% in men aged ≥ 70 years).

In all, 301 patients had complete data. The diagnostic accuracy of the PCA3 score for predicting a positive biopsy outcome was studied using sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values. The PCA3 performance was evaluated relative to three different subgroups of f/tPSA, as follows: >20% (group 1), 10-20% (group 2) and <10% (group 3).  Results:   the prostate cancer detection rates were 18.8%, 23.9% and 34.8% in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the PCA3 score, total PSA and f/tPSA was 0.688, 0.553 and 0.571, respectively. The percentage of men with positive biopsies was 30.6%, 37.0% and 44.4% in those with a PCA3 score of >30, vs 10.3%, 15.5% and 28.6% when the PCA3 score was <30, in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The difference was significant only in groups 1 and 2. In men with a f/tPSA of ≤ 10% the difference in detection rates relative to the PCA3 score was not statistically significant regardless of which PCA3 threshold was used. A high PCA3 score was significantly associated with age, clinical T2 stage and positive biopsy (P < 0.001, 0.013 and <0.001, respectively).

AST is used to reduce prostate size to enable men with favourable-risk prostate cancer to undergo brachytherapy, but no disease-specific benefit has been reported for this practice, and AST use has been associated with an increased risk of ACM in some men with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.  Patients and methods:   The study comprised 12792 men with favourable-risk disease, i.e. a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of <20 ng/mL, Gleason score ≤7 and clinical category ≤T2c, treated between 1991 and 2007 at community-based medical centres with brachytherapy ± neoadjuvant AST. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to assess whether there were significant associations between AST use in men with a history of MI or stroke and the risk of ACM, adjusting for age, treatment year, and known prognostic factors of prostate cancer.  Results:   After a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 3.8 (2.0-5.9) years there were 1557 deaths. The risk of ACM was lower in men with no history of MI or stroke than in those with this history, whether AST was used (adjusted hazard ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.92; P= 0.003) or not (0.74, 0.65-0.85; P < 0.001).

Health professionals are deserving of a more complete literature for the purpose of providing holistic care for this group of men, providing informed advocacy and better support for men living with the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Emerging literature reveals that men's knowledge of the long term problems associated with prostatectomy was inadequate at the time they consented to treatment; the likely outcomes at all phases of recovery should be taken into account when deciding on choice of treatment or no treatment. This qualitative study aims to describe men's long term recovery following prostatectomy for the purpose identifying the effects of unresolved post surgical morbidity. The content analysis of focus group interviews revealed that incontinence and impotence were a major source of emotional tension affecting the men's social interactions and sense of self-worth. The men expressed great regret over the lack of information accessible to them for evaluating the risk and nature of long term problems.

Histological analysis of the biopsies can reveal cancerous, noncancerous, or suspicious, possibly precancerous, tissue. During subsequent biopsy sessions, noncancerous regions should be avoided, and suspicious regions should be precisely rebiopsied, requiring accurate needle guidance. It is challenging to precisely guide a needle using 2D TRUS due to the limited anatomic information provided, and a three-dimensional (3D) record of biopsy locations for use in subsequent biopsy procedures cannot be collected. Our tracked, 3D TRUS-guided prostate biopsy system provides additional anatomic context and permits a 3D record of biopsies. However, targets determined based on a previous biopsy procedure must be transformed during the procedure to compensate for intraprocedure prostate shifting due to patient motion and prostate deformation due to transducer probe pressure. Thus, registration is a critically important step required to determine these transformations so that correspondence is maintained between the prebiopsied image and the real-time image. Registration must not only be performed accurately, but also quickly, since correction for prostate motion and deformation must be carried out during the biopsy procedure. The authors evaluated the accuracy, variability, and speed of several surface-based and image-based intrasession 3D-to-3D TRUS image registration techniques, for both rigid and nonrigid cases, to find the required transformations.  Methods:   Our surface-based rigid and nonrigid registrations of the prostate were performed using the iterative-closest-point algorithm and a thin-plate spline algorithm, respectively. For image-based rigid registration, the authors used a block matching approach, and for nonrigid registration, the authors define the moving image deformation using a regular, 3D grid of B-spline control points. The authors measured the target registration error (TRE) as the postregistration misalignment of 60 manually marked, corresponding intrinsic fiducials. The authors also measured the fiducial localization error (FLE), the effect of segmentation variability, and the effect of fiducial distance from the transducer probe tip. Lastly, the authors performed 3D principal component analysis (PCA) on the x, y, and z components of the TREs to examine the 95% confidence ellipsoids describing the errors for each registration method.  Results:   Using surface-based registration, the authors found mean TREs of 2.13 +/- 0.80 and 2.09 +/- 0.77 mm for rigid and nonrigid techniques, respectively. Using image-based rigid and non-rigid registration, the authors found mean TREs of 1.74 +/- 0.84 and 1.50 +/- 0.83 mm, respectively. Our FLE was 0.21 mm and did not dominate the overall TRE. However, segmentation variability contributed substantially approximately50%) to the TRE of the surface-based techniques. PCA showed that the 95% confidence ellipsoid encompassing fiducial distances between the source and target registra- tion images was reduced from 3.05 to 0.14 cm3, and 0.05 cm3 for the surface-based and image-based techniques, respectively. The run times for both registration methods were comparable at less than 60 s.  Conclusions:   Our results compare favorably with a clinical need for a TRE of less than 2.5 mm, and suggest that image-based registration is superior to surface-based registration for 3D TRUS-guided prostate biopsies, since it does not require segmentation.""","""['V V Karnik', 'A Fenster', 'J Bax', 'D W Cool', 'L Gardi', 'I Gyacskov', 'C Romagnoli', 'A D Ward']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['2D-3D rigid registration to compensate for prostate motion during 3D TRUS-guided biopsy.', 'Evaluation of intersession 3D-TRUS to 3D-TRUS image registration for repeat prostate biopsies.', 'Evaluation of inter-session 3D-TRUS to 3D-TRUS image registration for repeat prostate biopsies.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Meta-Learning Initializations for Interactive Medical Image Registration.', 'Real-time multimodal image registration with partial intraoperative point-set data.', 'Quantifying the effect of biopsy lateral decubitus patient positioning compared to supine prostate magnetic resonance image scanning on prostate translocation and distortion.', 'Robotic Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Learning Non-rigid Deformations for Robust, Constrained Point-based Registration in Image-Guided MR-TRUS Prostate Intervention.']"""

Spatial dose metrics are generally used to evaluate treatment plan quality. However, the use of this information alone neglects the effects of the significant differences in dose delivery duration and dose accumulation patterns, both of which can impact cell survival. This study uses the linear-quadratic model with dose protraction corrections to evaluate the biological effectiveness of different IMRT delivery techniques, including fixed gantry IMRT in SMLC (step-and-shoot) and DMLC (sliding window) modes and a rotational IMRT technique (helical tomotherapy) for the treatment of prostate and head/neck sites.  Methods:   The temporal dose pattern was measured using a small volume ion chamber (A1SL--0.057 cm3) to calculate the protraction factor, and biological equivalent dose (BED) was calculated for a range of repair half-times and alpha/beta ratios. The treatment BED is compared to an ideal delivery of the target prescription dose, in which dose is delivered instantaneously (G(t0) = 1), to evaluate loss in biological effectiveness due to protraction in delivery. In the case of a conventional prescription, the loss in biological effectiveness was further evaluated using published tumor control probability (TCP) data.  Results:   With SMLC and DMLC IMRT delivery, for both prostate and head/neck, the expected additional loss in BED is about 1% compared to 3D CRT, which corresponds to a predicted 2%-3% reduction in TCP. For tomotherapy, the prostate BED loss is smaller in comparison to 3D CRT; hence, the authors expect a TCP increase of the order of 2%-3%. The aforementioned differences are due to the dose accumulation time.  Conclusions:   While it is theoretically possible to compensate for changes in biologically effective dose, this would be hindered by large uncertainties in parameters used for such calculations; therefore, it is advantageous to irradiate target volume elements as rapidly as possible. The results of this study indicate that temporal dose delivery pattern is an important component in determining the biological effects of IMRT treatment.""","""['Mubin Shaikh', 'Jay Burmeister', 'Michael Joiner', 'Shalini Pandya', 'Bo Zhao', 'Qiang Liu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Improving IMRT delivery efficiency using intensity limits during inverse planning.', 'Comparison of fixed-beam IMRT, helical tomotherapy, and IMPT for selected cases.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological impact of dose fractionation on respiratory motion induced IMRT delivery errors: a volumetric dose measurement study.', 'Response-probability volume histograms and iso-probability of response charts in treatment plan evaluation.', '21 years of biologically effective dose.', 'Radiation repair models for clinical application.', 'Radiation Promptly Alters Cancer Live Cell Metabolic Fluxes: An In Vitro Demonstration.', 'Fast Helical Tomotherapy in a head and neck cancer planning study: is time priceless?', 'Radiobiological comparison of two radiotherapy treatment techniques for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Use of dMLC for implementation of dynamic respiratory-gated radiation therapy.']"""

In this work, the impact of anatomical interventions on the localization data from post-prostatectomy patients who received image-guided IMRT was analyzed.  Methods:   Patients were localized daily with online kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT). The target and the organs at risk (OARs) positional and volumetric changes were evaluated and couch shifts were applied. For patients with large target or OAR volumetric changes, quantified by either a rectal or bladder wall displacement of >5 mm on the CBCT sagittal images compared to the planning CT, repeated localization CBCT scans were performed following an interventional procedure. The procedure involves insertion of a catheter to deflate the rectum, evacuation of stools, and/or adjustment of bladder filling. The required shifts were then evaluated, and the IMRT treatment was subsequently delivered after proper patient positioning. The pre- and post-intervention shifts were compared in the lateral [left-right (LR)], longitudinal [superior-inferior (SI)], and vertical [anterior-posterior (AP)] directions. The percentage of shifts larger than 5 mm in all directions was also compared. Clinical target volume to planning target volume (CTV-to-PTV) expansion margins were estimated based on the pre- and post-intervention localization data.  Results:   Intervention was performed on all patients (n=17) treated between October 2008 and March 2009. The number of interventions ranged from 2 to 12 with a median number of 5, resulting in a total of 96 pairs of pre- and post-intervention shifts. The mean value (sigma) and standard deviation (sigma) of the shifts from pre- versus post-intervention data were LR, 0.0 +/- 3.0 mm vs. 0.5 +/- 2.8 mm; SI, 0.2 +/- 3.1 mm vs. -1.0 +/- 2.1 mm; and AP, -2.6 +/- 5.8 mm vs. 1.7 +/- 3.9 mm. The mean 3D shift distance was 7.0 +/- 3.1 mm vs. 5.0 +/- 2.6 mm. The percentage of pre-intervention shifts larger than 5 mm were 7%, 7%, and 45% in the LR, SI, and AP directions, respectively, compared to 8%, 4%, and 21% for post-intervention. Localization data from pre- and post-intervention procedures suggest that treatments that do not include intervention to correct for rectum/bladder anatomical variations require an additional 3.3 mm CTV-to-PTV margin.

Methods:   The contours of the prostate, the bladder, and the rectum were manually delineated by five observers on fan beam CT images of four prostate cancer patients. First, patient-specific representations of structure segmentation uncertainties were derived by determining the interobserver variability (i.e., standard deviation) of the structure boundary delineation. This was achieved by (1) generating an average structure surface mesh from the structure contours drawn by different observers, and (2) calculating three-dimensional standard deviation surface meshes (SDSMs) based on the perpendicular distances from the individual boundary surface meshes to the average surface mesh computed above. Then an average structure surface mesh was constructed to be the reference mesh for the population-based model. The average structure meshes of the other patients were deformably registered to the reference mesh. The calculated deformable vector fields were used to map the patient-specific SDSMs to the reference mesh to obtain the registered SDSMs. Finally, the population-based SDSM was derived by taking the average of the registered SDSMs in quadrature.  Results:   Population-based structure surface statistical models of the prostate, the bladder, and the rectum were created by mapping the patient-specific SDSMs to the population surface model. Graphical visualization indicates that the boundary uncertainties are dependent on anatomical location.  Conclusions:   The authors have developed and demonstrated a general method for objectively constructing surface maps of uncertainties derived from topologically complex structure boundary segmentations from multiple observers. The computed boundary uncertainties have significant spatial variations.

Let Dv denote the dose delivered to fractional volume v of a structure. In conventional intensity modulated radiation therapy planning, Dv has a unique value derived from the static (planned) dose distribution. In the presence of geometric uncertainties (e.g., setup errors) Dv assumes a range of values. The DCH is the complementary cumulative distribution function of D(v+). DCHs are similar to dose volume histograms (DVHs). Whereas a DVH plots volume v versus dose D, a DCH plots coverage probability Q versus D. For a given patient, Q is the probability (i.e., percentage of geometric uncertainties) for which the realized value of Dv exceeds D. PTV-based treatment plans can be converted to COP plans by replacing DVH optimization criteria with corresponding DCH criteria. In this approach, PTVs and planning organ at risk volumes are discarded, and DCH criteria are instead applied directly to clinical target volumes (CTVs) or organs at risk (OARs). Plans are optimized using a similar strategy as for DVH criteria. The specific implementation is described. COP was found to produce better plans than standard PTV-based plans, in the following sense. While target OAR dose tradeoff curves were equivalent to those for PTV-based plans, COP plans were able to exploit slack in OAR doses, i.e., cases where OAR doses were below their optimization limits, to increase target coverage. Specifically, because COP plans were not constrained by a predefined PTV, they were able to provide wider dosimetric margins around the CTV, by pushing OAR doses up to, but not beyond, their optimization limits. COP plans demonstrated improved target coverage when averaged over all 28 prostate anatomies, indicating that the COP approach can provide benefits for many patients. However, the degree to which slack OAR doses can be exploited to increase target coverage will vary according to the individual patient anatomy. The proof-of-concept COP implementation investigated here utilized a probabilistic DCH criteria only for the CTV minimum dose criterion. All other optimization criteria were conventional DVH criteria. In a mature COP implementation, all optimization criteria will be DCH criteria, enabling direct planning control over probabilistic dose distributions. Further research is necessary to determine the benefits of COP planning, in terms of tumor control probability and/or normal tissue complication probabilities.""","""['J J Gordon', 'N Sayah', 'E Weiss', 'J V Siebers']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dose-shaping using targeted sparse optimization.', 'Evaluation of dosimetric margins in prostate IMRT treatment plans.', 'A new method of incorporating systematic uncertainties in intensity-modulated radiotherapy optimization.', 'Robust Proton Treatment Planning: Physical and Biological Optimization.', 'Optimized planning using physical objectives and constraints.', 'Probabilistic optimization of dose coverage in radiotherapy.', 'Robust optimization for intensity-modulated proton therapy with soft spot sensitivity regularization.', 'Robustness Analysis for External Beam Radiation Therapy Treatment Plans: Describing Uncertainty Scenarios and Reporting Their Dosimetric Consequences.', 'Novel adaptive beam-dependent margins for additional OAR sparing.', 'A method for acquiring random range uncertainty probability distributions in proton therapy.']"""

Underlying trends are changing the pattern of cancer and this is also being influenced by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Even though the pattern of cancer varies across Africa, there are identifiable trends. Breast and cervical cancers, and Kaposi sarcoma are the commonest cancers in women, while Kaposi sarcoma, liver and prostate cancers are the commonest in men. Cancer causes more morbidity and mortality in Africa compared to other parts of the world. Infections account for a disproportionate amount of cancers in Africa. The HIV epidemic is contributing to increased prevalence of many cancers particularly those associated with Herpes and Papilloma viruses. Tobacco use, another major carcinogen, is increasing, particularly among the young. Dietary factors, alcohol use, physical inactivity and environmental pollution are also important aetiological factors of cancer in Africa. In developing countries, poverty, limited government health budget and poor health care systems complicate cancer prevention, treatment and outcomes. Coordinated response by international agencies and NGOs is needed to help developing countries and several successful models exist. More action is also needed on ensuring safety and quality of chemotherapy and the price needs to be reduced. Responses advocated for cancer control in Africa include banning tobacco use, better regulation of alcohol sale, better environmental planning and immunization against cancer associated viruses. Training of health care workers to diagnose cancer and treat it effectively within limited budgets is needed. Research to develop these new treatments and others, particularly from natural products is urgently needed and this can be done safely within established health research ethics regulatory frameworks.

Methods:   We have prepared a multivalent reactive N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide-based copolymer (PHPMA) bearing an α-bungarotoxin-binding peptide (BTXbp). The copolymer was used for covalent surface modification of adenoviral vectors (Ad). The α-bungarotoxin protein (BTX) has a nanomolar binding affinity for BTXbp, allowing non-covalent linkage of BTX fusion proteins. A single chain variable fragment of anti-PSMA antibody bearing BTX (scFv-BTX) binding to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) was conjugated with the copolymer-coated adenovirus to enable specific infection of prostate cancer cells via PSMA receptors.  Results:   As shown by ELISA, the copolymer-coated virus exhibited much reduced binding to anti-Ad antibodies. Infection of PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells was ∼100-fold less efficient with copolymer-coated Ad than with un-modified Ad. Conjugation of scFv-BTX with Ad-PHPMA-BTXbp led to 5-10-fold restoration of infection in PSMA-positive LNCaP cells. In PSMA-negative PC-3 cells, the conjugation of scFv-BTX with Ad-PHPMA-BTXbp gave no enhancement of infection.

The specific genetic element/s in 17q responsible for the cancer-promoting effect of these aberrancies is yet to be defined although many genes located in 17q have been proposed to play a role in malignancy. We report here the characterization of a naturally-occurring, non-reciprocal translocation der(X)t(X;17) in human lung embryonal-derived cells following continuous culturing. This aberrancy was strongly correlated with an increased proliferative capacity and with an acquired ability to form colonies in vitro. The breakpoint region was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to the 17q24.3 locus. Further characterization by a custom-made comparative genome hybridization array (CGH) localized the breakpoint within the Bromodomain PHD finger Transcription Factor gene (BPTF), a gene involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, this translocation led to elevation in the mRNA levels of the endogenous BPTF. Knock-down of BPTF restricted proliferation suggesting a role for BPTF in promoting cellular growth. Furthermore, the BPTF chromosomal region was found to be amplified in various human tumors, especially in neuroblastomas and lung cancers in which 55% and 27% of the samples showed gain of 17q24.3, respectively. Additionally, 42% percent of the cancer cell lines comprising the NCI-60 had an abnormal BPTF locus copy number. We suggest that deregulation of BPTF resulting from the translocation may confer the cells with the observed cancer-promoting phenotype and that our cellular model can serve to establish causality between 17q aberrations and carcinogenesis.""","""['Yosef Buganim', 'Ido Goldstein', 'Doron Lipson', 'Michael Milyavsky', 'Sylvie Polak-Charcon', 'Corine Mardoukh', 'Hilla Solomon', 'Eyal Kalo', 'Shalom Madar', 'Ran Brosh', 'Marina Perelman', 'Roy Navon', 'Naomi Goldfinger', 'Iris Barshack', 'Zohar Yakhini', 'Varda Rotter']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Compound C620-0696, a new potent inhibitor targeting BPTF, the chromatin-remodeling factor in non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Downregulated METTL14 accumulates BPTF that reinforces super-enhancers and distal lung metastasis via glycolytic reprogramming in renal cell carcinoma.', 'The role of BPTF in melanoma progression and in response to BRAF-targeted therapy.', 'Identification of the breakpoint-flanking markers on chromosomes 1 and 17 of a constitutional translocation T(1;17)(P36;Q12-21) in a patient with neuroblastoma.', 'der(11)t(11;17): a distinct cytogenetic pathway of advanced stage neuroblastoma (NBL) - detected by spectral karyotyping (SKY).', 'Mutual Regulation of ncRNAs and Chromatin Remodeling Complexes in Normal and Pathological Conditions.', 'BPTF promotes the progression of distinct subtypes of breast cancer and is a therapeutic target.', 'Targeting BPTF Sensitizes Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma to Chemotherapy by Repressing ABC-Transporters and Impairing Multidrug Resistance (MDR).', 'The emerging role of ISWI chromatin remodeling complexes in cancer.', 'Opportunity knocks for uncovering the new function of an understudied nucleosome remodeling complex member, the bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor, BPTF.']"""

We wanted to evaluate the potential of [(11)C]choline PET/CT in the diagnosis of single LN recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RPE) and whether secondary resection can result in PSA remission.  Methods:   We investigated 6 patients with biochemical recurrence (PSA: median 2.04, range 0.67-4.51 ng/ml) after RPE. A single suspicious LN was detected on PET/CT without suspicion of local relapse or distant metastasis. The suspicious and nearby LN were open dissected (09/2004-02/2008). Histological and PET/CT findings were compared and the postoperative PSA development was examined.  Results:   All metastasis-suspicious LN could be confirmed histologically. The additionally removed 10 LN were all correctly negative for cancer. Three patients showed a complete permanent PSA remission (<0.01 (n = 2), <0.03 ng/ml (n = 1)) without adjuvant therapy (follow-up: median 24, range 21-35 months).  Conclusions:   In this small selected collective [(11)C]choline PET/CT achieved reliable results. After resection of single LNM in all patients the oncologic criteria of a remission were fulfilled.

Methods:   PMR and GCA patients were identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and by linking them with the Cancer Registry. Follow-up of patients was carried out from the last hospitalization through year 2006. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated in these patients compared with subjects without the diseases.  Results:   A total of 35 918 patients were hospitalized for PMR and GCA during the years 1965-2006; the hospitalization rate increased towards late age. A total of 3941 patients developed subsequent cancer, giving an overall SIR of 1.19; and for cancer diagnosed later than 1 year of follow-up, the SIR was 1.06. A significant excess was noted for skin (squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma), stomach, lung, prostate, kidney, nervous system and endocrine gland tumours, and additionally for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, myeloma and leukaemia. Decreased risk was noted for endometrial cancer.  Conclusions:   Patients hospitalized for PMR and GCA had a marginally increased risk of cancer, with the highest risk noted for the first year after hospitalization.

Pretreatment predictors of outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP) in this patient group are necessary.  Objective:   Our aim was to assess how the use of additional high-risk factors (biopsy Gleason score [bGS] > or = 8 or clinical stage 3-4) can improve prediction of treatment failure and cancer-related death after RP in patients with PSA >20.  Design, setting, and participants:   In a retrospective multicentre cohort study from six European centres between 1987 and 2005, 712 patients with PSA >20 ng/ml underwent RP and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy.  Measurements:   Subgroups were analysed to determine the relationship between the number of high-risk factors and histopathology, biochemical progression-free survival, clinical evidence of progressive disease, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and overall mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test and Cox multivariable analysis were applied.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up was 77 mo. The number of high-risk factors was significantly associated with unfavourable histopathology. Among patients with only PSA >20 ng/ml, 33% had pT2 PCa, 57.9% had bGS <7, 54% had negative surgical margins, and 85% were lymph node negative (pN0), whereas among patients with all three high-risk factors, 4.5% had pT2 PCa, 2.3% had bGS <7, 20.5% had negative margins, and 49% were pN0 (p<0.001). The strongest predictor of progression and mortality was bGS. PSA >20 ng/ml associated with bGS < or =7 resulted in 10-yr PCSM of 5%; when associated with bGS > or =8, PCSM was 35%. The main limitations of the study were retrospective design and varying treatment modalities.  Conclusions:   PCa patients with PSA >20 ng/ml have varying risk levels of disease progression and PCSM. Considering additional risk factors further stratifies this group into four subgroups that can guide the clinician in preoperative patient counselling.""","""['Martin Spahn', 'Steven Joniau', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Steffen Fieuws', 'Giansilvio Marchioro', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Burkhard Kneitz', 'Chao-Yu Hsu', 'Katie Van Der Eeckt', 'Pia Bader', 'Detlef Frohneberg', 'Alessandro Tizzani', 'Hein Van Poppel']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Defining and treating high-risk prostate cancer: can we do better?', 'Re: Martin Spahn, Steven Joniau, Paolo Gontero, et al.

This may be a reason to discontinue active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   A total of 150 Dutch patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance in a prospective active surveillance study received questionnaires at study inclusion and 9 months after diagnosis. We assessed changes in scores on decisional conflict with the decisional conflict scale, depression with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, generic anxiety with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, prostate cancer specific anxiety with the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer and the self-estimated risk of progression. We explored scores 9 months after diagnosis vs those at study inclusion for physical health (SF-12 physical component summary), personality (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire), shared decision making, prostate cancer knowledge, demographics, medical parameters and prostate specific antigen doubling time during followup.  Results:   Questionnaires at study inclusion and 9 months after diagnosis were completed by 129 of 150 (86%) and 108 of 120 participants (90%) a median of 2.4 and 9.2 months after diagnosis, respectively. Anxiety and distress at study inclusion were previously found to be generally favorable. Significant but clinically irrelevant decreases were seen in mean scores of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (p = 0.016), Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer fear of progression subscale (p = 0.005) and the self-estimated risk of progression (p = 0.049). Anxiety and distress 9 months after diagnosis were mainly predicted by scores at study inclusion. Higher Eysenck Personality Questionnaire neuroticism score and an important role of the physician in the treatment decision had additionally unfavorable effects. Good physical health, palpable disease and older age had favorable effects. No association was seen for prostate specific antigen doubling time.

We propose that a more rapid prostate cancer growth rate and/or earlier transformation from latent to aggressive prostate cancer in black than in white men contribute to this disparity.

We also reviewed data from our radical prostatectomy database and from the Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database.  Results:   Autopsy data indicated that subclinical prostate cancer in black and white men starts at early age and clinical characteristics do not differ by race at early ages.

Advanced or metastatic prostate cancer occurred at a 4:1 ratio in black and white men, respectively, in the Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry database.  Conclusions:   Results showed that age at prostate cancer initiation and clinical characteristics did not differ by race in our autopsy series, prostate cancer volume after radical prostatectomy was greater in black than in white men and disease became distant disease at a ratio of 4 black men to 1 white man in the Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results population.

Some groups recommend screening men with a greater than 10-year life expectancy while the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening men 75 years old or older. In this study we evaluated the influence of health status and life expectancy on prostate specific antigen screening in older men in the United States before the 2008 United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines.  Materials and methods:   The study cohort comprised 718 men age 75 years or older without a history of prostate cancer who responded to the 2005 National Health Interview Survey, representing an estimated 4.47 million noninstitutionalized men in the United States. Life expectancy was estimated from age and self-reported health status.  Results:   Overall 19% of the men were 85 years old or older and 27% reported fair or poor health. In the previous 2 years 52% had a prostate specific antigen screening test. After adjustment for age, race, education and physician access, men with fair or poor health were less likely to receive prostate specific antigen screening than those with excellent or very good health (adjusted OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.80, p = 0.003). Overall 42% of the men predicted to live less than 5 years and 65% of those predicted to live more than 10 years reported having recent prostate specific antigen screening.  Conclusions:   Before the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendation, health status and life expectancy were used to select older men for prostate specific antigen screening. However, many men expected to live less than 5 years were screened.

AD is the fifth leading cause of death in Americans aged 65 and older. Although other major causes of death have been on the decrease, deaths because of AD have been rising dramatically. Between 2000 and 2006, heart disease deaths decreased 11.1%, stroke deaths decreased 18.2%, and prostate cancer-related deaths decreased 8.7%, whereas deaths because of AD increased 46.1%. Older African-Americans and Hispanics are more likely than older white Americans to have AD or other dementia. Current estimates are that African-Americans are about 2 times more likely, and Hispanics about 1.5 times more likely, than their white counterparts to have these conditions. However, the relationship of race and ethnicity to the development of AD and other dementias is complex and not fully understood. In 2009, nearly 11 million family and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 12.5 billion hours of care to persons with AD and other dementias; this care is valued at nearly $144 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with AD and other dementias are three times higher than for beneficiaries without these conditions. Total payments for 2010 for health care and long-term care services for people aged 65 and older with AD and other dementias are expected to be $172 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). An estimated 5.3 million Americans have AD; approximately 200,000 persons under age 65 with AD comprise the younger-onset AD population. Every 70 seconds, someone in America develops AD; by 2050 the time of every 70 seconds is expected to decrease to every 33 seconds. Over the coming decades, the baby boom population is projected to add 10 million people to these numbers. In 2050, the incidence of AD is expected to approach nearly a million people per year, with a total estimated prevalence of 11-16 million people. Dramatic increases in the numbers of ""oldest old"" (aged 85 years and older) across all racial and ethnic groups will also significantly affect the numbers of people living with AD. This report provides information to increase understanding of the public health effect of AD, including incidence and prevalence, mortality, costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society in general.

Up to now dose escalation is usually applied to the whole prostate. IMRT and related techniques currently allow for dose escalation in sub-volumes of the organ. However, the sensitivity of the imaging modality and the fact that small islands of cancer are often dispersed within the whole organ may limit these approaches with regard to a clear clinical benefit. In order to assess potential effects of a dose escalation in certain sub-volumes based on choline PET imaging a mathematical dose-response model was developed.  Methods:   Based on different assumptions for alpha/beta, gamma 50, sensitivity and specificity of choline PET, the influence of the whole prostate and simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose on tumor control probability (TCP) was calculated. Based on the given heterogeneity of all potential variables certain representative permutations of the parameters were chosen and, subsequently, the influence on TCP was assessed.  Results:   Using schedules with 74 Gy within the whole prostate and a SIB dose of 90 Gy the TCP increase ranged from 23.1% (high detection rate of choline PET, low whole prostate dose, high gamma 50/ASTRO definition for tumor control) to 1.4% TCP gain (low sensitivity of PET, high whole prostate dose, CN + 2 definition for tumor control) or even 0% in selected cases. The corresponding initial TCP values without integrated boost ranged from 67.3% to 100%. According to a large data set of intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients the resulting TCP gains ranged from 22.2% to 10.1% (ASTRO definition) or from 13.2% to 6.0% (CN + 2 definition).  Discussion:   Although a simplified mathematical model was employed, the presented model allows for an estimation in how far given schedules are relevant for clinical practice. However, the benefit of a SIB based on choline PET seems less than intuitively expected. Only under the assumption of high detection rates and low initial TCP values the TCP gain has been shown to be relevant.  Conclusions:   Based on the employed assumptions, specific dose escalation to choline PET positive areas within the prostate may increase the local control rates. Due to the lack of exact PET sensitivity and prostate alpha/beta parameter, no firm conclusions can be made. Small variations may completely abrogate the clinical benefit of a SIB based on choline PET imaging.""","""['Maximilian Niyazi', 'Peter Bartenstein', 'Claus Belka', 'Ute Ganswindt']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Intensity modulated radiation therapy dose painting for localized prostate cancer using ¹¹C-choline positron emission tomography scans.', 'Feasibility of TCP-based dose painting by numbers applied to a prostate case with (18)F-choline PET imaging.', 'Focal dose escalation for prostate cancer using 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA PET/CT and MRI: a planning study based on histology reference.', 'Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.', 'Is choline PET useful for identifying intraprostatic tumour lesions?

Summary:   Breast cancer and prostate cancer are common, deadly diseases, but many survivors are alive today because of improvements in early detection and treatment over the past 10-15 years. Cancer chemotherapy, corticosteroids, hormone-ablation therapy, and other common risk factors place patients with breast or prostate cancer at high risk for bone loss, osteoporosis, and fractures. Most patients with breast or prostate cancer should undergo assessment of risk for bone loss and osteoporosis that involves a bone-related history and physical examination, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning, and the FRAX fracture risk assessment tool from the World Health Organization. A recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network task force report on bone health in cancer care provides recommendations for considering the use of pharmacologic therapy on the basis of the results of this assessment. Bisphosphonates are useful for slowing or preventing bone loss associated with hormone-ablation therapy in women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer, although fracture data are limited in women and not available in men. The usefulness of other therapies (selective estrogen receptor modulators, teriparatide, calcitonin salmon, and estrogens) is limited by adverse effects, a lack of experience with the drugs in these patient populations, or both. Various drug therapies are in development for managing cancer treatment-induced bone loss and osteoporosis. The agent closest to approval by the Food and Drug Administration, denosumab, has been shown to improve bone mineral density in women and men receiving hormone-ablation therapy for breast or prostate cancer, but additional data are needed to dispel safety concerns that could limit the use of this drug in these patient populations. Health-system pharmacists play an important role in screening patients with a history of breast or prostate cancer for bone loss or osteoporosis, making drug therapy recommendations to address the problem, and counseling patients on modifiable risk factors for osteoporosis and proper use of drug therapies to improve bone health.  Conclusion:   Health-system pharmacists can improve the detection and management of cancer treatment-induced bone loss and osteoporosis in patients receiving systemic therapy for breast or prostate cancer.""","""['Laura Boehnke Michaud']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Health Syst Pharm""","""['Early breast and prostate cancer and clinical outcomes (fracture).', 'Prescription drug therapies for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.', 'Bone health management in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Management of bone loss due to endocrine therapy during cancer treatment.', 'Background to and management of treatment-related bone loss in prostate cancer.', 'Therapy-Induced Senescence Drives Bone Loss.', 'Improving medication safety in oncology care: impact of clinical pharmacy interventions on optimizing patient safety.', 'Vertebral and femoral bone mineral density and bone strength in prostate cancer patients assessed in phantomless PET/CT examinations.', 'Pharmacist-managed clinics for patient education and counseling in Japan: current status and future perspectives.', 'The impact of bone mineral density testing, fracture assessment, and osteoporosis education in men treated by androgen deprivation for prostate cancer: a pilot study.']"""

The recently developed sumLINK and sumLOD statistics are powerful tools for linkage analysis in the presence of heterogeneity.  Methods:   We performed a secondary analysis of 1,233 PC pedigrees from the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG) using two novel statistics, the sumLINK and sumLOD. For both statistics, dominant and recessive genetic models were considered. False discovery rate (FDR) analysis was conducted to assess the effects of multiple testing.  Results:   Our analysis identified significant linkage evidence at chromosome 22q12, confirming previous findings by the initial conventional analyses of the same ICPCG data. Twelve other regions were identified with genome-wide suggestive evidence for linkage. Seven regions (1q23, 5q11, 5q35, 6p21, 8q12, 11q13, 20p11-q11) are near loci previously identified in the initial ICPCG pooled data analysis or the subset of aggressive PC pedigrees. Three other regions (1p12, 8p23, 19q13) confirm loci reported by others, and two (2p24, 6q27) are novel susceptibility loci. FDR testing indicates that over 70% of these results are likely true positive findings. Statistical recombinant mapping narrowed regions to an average of 9 cM.  Conclusions:   Our results represent genomic regions with the greatest consistency of positive linkage evidence across a very large collection of high-risk PC pedigrees using new statistical tests that deal powerfully with heterogeneity.

We test the hypothesis that systemic hypoxia promotes prostate cancer growth in vivo and examine HIF-1alpha centrality in this effect.  Methods:   Male athymic mice were xenografted with 3 x 10(6) LNCaP cells per each flank and exposed for 28 days to either chronic hypoxia (CH, 10% O(2)) or CH with reoxygenation (CHReox, 3 times/week for 1 hr), with normoxia as control (n = 17, 9, and 20, respectively). At the end of the observation, mice were euthanized and tumors harvested for analyses.  Results:   The successful xenografts grew faster in CH and CHReox than in normoxia (first-order rate constants 0.15 +/- 0.01, 0.18 +/- 0.03, and 0.09 +/- 0.01 day(-1), P < 0.05, n = 18, 15, and 25, respectively). Furthermore, the tumor masses at the end were 4.09 +/- 0.58, 3.42 +/- 0.55, and 1.86 +/- 0.25 mg/g bw (P < 0.05), respectively. HIF-1alpha, assayed by Western blot and immunofluorescence, was slightly increased in CH with respect to normoxia, but markedly over-expressed (5-10 times) in CHReox (P < 0.001). The tumor hemoglobin content, higher in CH and CHReox than in normoxia, reflected the higher blood hemoglobin concentration, not neovascularization, as supported by similar expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the three groups. By contrast, protein kinase B (Akt) was more phosphorylated in both hypoxic groups than in normoxia (P < 0.01).

In this regard, 5-Azacitine (5-Aza) represents a promising epigenetic modulator. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-Aza may restore and enhance the responsiveness of HRPC cells to anti-hormonal therapy on Androgen receptor (AR) expressing (22rv1) and AR-deficient (PC3) cells.  Methods:   The effects were studied in vitro and in vivo models. This sequential treatment induced in vitro cell cycle arrest and apoptosis both in 22rv1 and PC3 tumor cell lines.  Results:   This combined treatment up-regulated the expression of FasL, phospho-FADD, p16(INKA), Bax, Bak, and p21(WAF1), and inhibited FLIP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL expression. The re-activation of hormonal response of AR-negative PC3 cell line was partially due to the AR re-expression mediated by 5-Aza treatment. In contrast, the increase in the response to anti-androgenic therapy in 22rv1 did not correlate with AR expression levels. Furthermore, xenograft studies revealed that the combined treatment of 5-Aza with AR-antagonist Bicalutamide had additive/synergistic effects in repressing tumor growth in vivo and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects seem to be in part mediated by induction of apoptosis.

It is known that phorbol ester phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), a potent antagonist to both conventional and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes, induces cancer cell scattering.  Methods:   To assess the effect of PMA on EMT, ARCaP(E) cells were treated with PMA and were assayed for EMT-related morphologic and behavioral changes. Specific inhibitors were used to investigate the PMA-induced EMT.  Results:   PMA at 100 nM induced EMT in a time-dependent manner, resulting in a complete change from epithelial to mesenchymal stromal morphology. Concurrently, PMA inhibited expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and increased the level of stromal marker protein vimentin, while the treated cells showed increased migratory and invasive capacities. Using specific inhibitors, we confirmed that the effect of PMA was mediated by PKC, while isoenzymes of the novel PKC subfamily were implicated as the main mediator. Finally, we determined that the EMT was dependent on newly synthesized proteins, because inhibitors for gene transcription and protein translation could both inhibit the initiation of EMT.  Conclusions:   Although PMA is well known for its effects on cell migration and tumor formation, this work is the first to define PMA as an EMT inducer in prostate cancer cells.

We have uncovered that growth factors binding to RTKs lead to activation of a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1 (also known as ACK or TNK2), which directly phosphorylates AKT at an evolutionarily conserved tyrosine 176 in the kinase domain. Tyr176-phosphorylated AKT localizes to the plasma membrane and promotes Thr308/Ser473-phosphorylation leading to AKT activation. Mice expressing activated Ack1 specifically in the prostate exhibit AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation and develop murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPINs). Further, expression levels of Tyr176-phosphorylated-AKT and Tyr284-phosphorylated-Ack1 were positively correlated with the severity of disease progression, and inversely correlated with the survival of breast cancer patients.

A combination of vitamin K3 (VK3) and ascorbic acid (AA) exhibited an anti-cancer synergistic effect, associated with extracellular production of H(2)O(2) that promoted cell death.  Methods:   The redox-silent vitamin E analogue alpha-tocopheryl succinate (alpha-TOS) was used in combination with VK3 and AA to evaluate their effect on prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Prostate cancer cells were sensitive to alpha-TOS and VK3 treatment, but resistant to AA upto 3.2 mM. When combined, a synergistic effect was found for VK3-AA, whereas alpha-TOS-VK3 and alpha-TOS-AA combination showed an antagonist and additive effect, respectively. However, sub-lethal doses of AA-VK3 combination combined with a sub-toxic dose of alpha-TOS showed to induce efficient cell death that resembles autoschizis. Associated with this cell demise, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, cytoskeleton alteration, lysosomal-mitochondrial perturbation, and release of cytochrome c without caspase activation were observed. Inhibition of lysosomal proteases did not attenuate cell death induced by the combined agents. Furthermore, cell deaths by apoptosis and autoschizis were detected.

PC3 cells cultured in a medium containing 113 mM Cl(-) for 96 h grew up 9-fold in cell number, while PC3 cells cultured in an 8 mM-Cl(-)-containing culture medium showed complete arrest of cell growth even after culture for 96 h. Exposure of cells to the 8 mM-Cl(-) culture medium diminished phosphorylation levels of Rb and cdc2, which are respectively key accelerators of transition from G(1) to S phase and G(2) to M phase in cell cycle progression. Culturing cells in the 8 mM-Cl(-)-containing culture medium upregulated the protein expression level of p21 (a CDK inhibitor) inhibiting transition of G(1) to S phase, and diminished the incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU; a thymidine analogue) into DNA. These results suggest that cells cultured in the low Cl(-) medium prolonged the duration of all phases of the cell cycle (G(1), S, and G(2)/M), thereby abolishing overall cell cycle progression. Effects of culturing cells in the low Cl(-) culture medium on cell cycle progression would be mediated via a change in the intracellular Cl(-) concentration ([Cl(-)](i)), since [Cl(-)](i) was decreased under a low Cl(-) culture medium. To clarify this possibility, we studied effects of furosemide and bumetanide, Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC) inhibitors, on proliferation of PC3 cells. Furosemide and bumetanide decreased [Cl(-)](i) and cell growth of PC3 cells.

Methods:   69 patients with localized prostate cancer were included. After virtually dividing the prostate into 12 sectors, results of EC-MRI were compared to corresponding whole-mount sections by contingency analysis. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each of the 12 areas as well as for the dorsal and ventral region.

Conclusions:   Local sensitivity decreased from basodorsal to apicoventral direction, whereas local specificity increased in the same direction.

Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) is very helpful in early diagnosis, but the main disadvantage is that it has a low positive predictive value in the range of the grey zone of 2.5-10 ng/mL, which results in a high number of needless biopsies. For this reason, new tests with better parameters are needed. One promising test is that for differential display code 3 (DD3(PCA3)), which is a prostate-specific non-coding mRNA that is highly overexpressed in prostate tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of DD3(PCA3) for mRNA in PCa diagnosis.  Patients and methods:   A total of 186 patients were examined. In a group of patients with suspected PCa, one tissue specimen core was collected for testing DD3(PCA3) expression. According to the histological verification there were 100 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, 12 patients with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 74 patients with PCa. The total RNA was isolated and DD3(PCA3) and PSA expressions were quantified using quantitative RT real-time PCR method. The DD3(PCA3)/PSA mRNA ratio was determined for all groups.  Results:   It was found that the levels of the mRNA expression of DD3(PCA3) were significantly higher (p<0.045) in patients with PCa than in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. No statistically significant differences in levels of mRNA expression of DD3(PCA3) between patients with organ-confined and those with advanced or metastatic disease, nor according to Gleason score, were found.

A number of 1, 4-naphthoquinone derivatives have been identified that possess significant pharmacological effects associated with antitumor activities. In this study, the in vitro effects of N-(3-chloro-1,4-dioxo 1,4-dihydro-naphthalen-2-yl)-benzamide (NCDDNB) were evaluated on androgen-dependent (CWR-22) and androgen-independent (PC-3, DU-145) human prostate cancer cell lines, and on a normal bone marrow cell line (HS-5). Specifically, the in vitro activity of this compound on cell cycle regulation and apoptosis was evaluated.  Materials and methods:   Established methods of cell viability, cell cycle, Western blot and apoptosis were used.  Results:   The effect of NCDDNB on CWR-22, PC-3, DU-145 and HS-5 cells revealed significant anti-tumor activities with IC(50)s, of 2.5, 2.5, 6.5, and 25 muM respectively. The results of cell cycle analysis showed that NCDDNB arrested PC-3, DU-145, and CWR-22 cells in the G(1)-phase of the cell cycle. The compound showed no effect on the cell cycle progression in the HS-5 bone marrow cell line. These findings were further validated using Western blot analysis. NCDDNB showed the greatest amount of apoptosis in the androgen-independent PC-3 cells in a time-dependent manner with the apoptotic apex at day 5 of treatment. Furthermore, NCDDNB induced-apoptosis in DU-145 and CWR-22 cells peaked at day 3 of treatment.  Conclusion:   Although the mechanism of action of this compound has not been completely elucidated, the effect on the cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis in different prostate cancer cell lines prompted us to carry out a more in-depth preclinical evaluation.

We hypothesize that fatty acid is dominant over glucose in uptake by prostate cells.  Materials and methods:   One benign (RWPE1) and two malignant (LNCaP and PC3) prostate cell lines were assayed for their in vitro uptake of radiolabeled glucose analogs (3)H-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose and (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose, and the long-chain fatty acid (3)H-palmitic acid. Fractional uptake was standardized to viable cell numbers.  Results:   Uptake of palmitate in all 3 prostate cell lines was significantly higher than that of glucose at all incubation times (p<0.01). But in malignant cell lines, neither glucose nor palmitate uptake was quantitatively higher than that in the benign cell line. The uptake of fatty acid by prostate cells is a dynamic, active process mediated by the membrane receptors.  Conclusion:   Prostate cells are characterized by a dominant uptake of fatty acid over glucose, suggesting that future development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in prostatic cancer should focus on fatty acid substrate.

An important feature of these risk-associated SNPs is their weak individual effect but stronger cumulative effect on disease risk. Several approaches are commonly used to model the combined effect in risk prediction, but their performance is unclear. We compared two methods to model the combined effect of 14 prostate cancer risk-associated SNPs and family history for the estimation of absolute risk for prostate cancer in a population-based case-control study in Sweden (2,899 cases and 1,722 controls). Method 1 weighs each risk allele equally using a simple method of counting the number of risk alleles, whereas method 2 weighs each risk SNP differently based on its odds ratio. We found considerable differences between the two methods. Absolute risk estimates from method 1 were generally higher than those of method 2, especially among men at higher risk. The difference in the overall discriminative performance, measured by area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic, was small between method 1 (0.614) and method 2 (0.618), P = 0.20. However, the performance of these two methods in identifying high-risk individuals (2- or 3-fold higher than average risk), measured by positive predictive values, was higher for method 2 than for method 1.

Profiling results showed that expression of MCM genes was higher in tumor samples. Genistein and TSA significantly downregulated the expression of all MCM genes. Genistein, TSA, and small interfering RNA duplexes caused a significant decrease in the S phase of the cell cycle. There was also downregulation of CDT1, CDC7, and CDK2 genes, which govern loading of the MCM complex on chromatin.

In PC3 cells, inhibition of miR-1296 upregulated both MCM2 mRNA and protein, whereas overexpression caused a significant decrease in MCM2 mRNA, protein, and the S phase of the cell cycle. MCM genes are excellent anticancer drug targets because they are essential DNA replication factors that are highly expressed in cancer cells. This is the first report showing anti-MCM effect by miR-1296, genistein, and TSA. TSA is undergoing clinical trials as a prostate cancer treatment but has high toxicity.

It is often downregulated in metastatic prostate cancer and has been reported as a possible prognostic marker to predict the risk of aggressive prostate cancer. In this study, we furnish several lines of evidence indicating that metastatic human prostate cancer PC3 cells deficient in DAB2IP (shDAB2IP) exhibit increased clonogenic survival in response to ionizing radiation (IR) compared with control cells expressing an endogenous level of DAB2IP (shVector). Radioresistance was also observed in normal prostate cells that are deficient in DAB2IP. This enhanced resistance to IR in DAB2IP-deficient prostate cancer cells is primarily due to faster DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair kinetics. More than 90% of DSBs were repaired in shDAB2IP cells by 8 hours after 2 Gy radiation, whereas only 60% of DSB repair were completed in shVector cells at the same time. Second, upon irradiation, DAB2IP-deficient cells enforced a robust G(2)-M cell cycle checkpoint compared with control cells. Finally, shDAB2IP cells showed resistance to IR-induced apoptosis that could result from a striking decrease in the expression levels of proapoptotic proteins caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, and significantly higher levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and STAT3 than those in shVector cells. In summary, DAB2IP plays a significant role in prostate cell survival following IR exposure due to enhanced DSB repair, robust G(2)-M checkpoint control, and resistance to IR-induced apoptosis. Therefore, it is important to identify patients with dysregulated DAB2IP for (a) assessing prostate cancer risk and (b) alternative treatment regimens.""","""['Zhaolu Kong', 'Daxing Xie', 'Thomas Boike', 'Pavithra Raghavan', 'Sandeep Burma', 'David J Chen', 'Amyn A Habib', 'Arup Chakraborty', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Debabrata Saha']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Epothilone B confers radiation dose enhancement in DAB2IP gene knock-down radioresistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential regulation of the human gene DAB2IP in normal and malignant prostatic epithelia: cloning and characterization.', 'DAB2IP regulates autophagy in prostate cancer in response to combined treatment of radiation and a DNA-PKcs inhibitor.', 'Gene amplification, radiation sensitivity and DNA double-strand breaks.', 'DAB2IP in cancer.', 'DAB2IP predicts treatment response and prognosis of ESCC patients and modulates its radiosensitivity through enhancing IR-induced activation of the ASK1-JNK pathway.', 'Mitotic phosphorylation of tumor suppressor DAB2IP maintains spindle assembly checkpoint and chromosomal stability through activating PLK1-Mps1 signal pathway and stabilizing mitotic checkpoint complex.', 'Home and Away: The Role of Non-Coding RNA in Intracellular and Intercellular DNA Damage Response.', 'DAB2IP decreases cell growth and migration and increases sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in colorectal cancer.', 'STAT3, the Challenge for Chemotherapeutic and Radiotherapeutic Efficacy.']"""

The authors of this report compared the use of brachytherapy alone with combined brachytherapy, external-beam radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles, and androgen-suppression therapy (CMT) in this population.  Methods:   The study cohort comprised 764 men aged > or = 65 years with high-risk prostate cancer (T3 or T4N0M0, prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL, and/or Gleason score 8-10) who received either brachytherapy alone (n = 206) or CMT (n = 558) at the Chicago Prostate Cancer Center or at a 21st Century Oncology facility. Men either had no history of myocardial infarction (MI) or had a history of MI treated with a stent or surgical intervention. Fine and Gray regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with PCSM.  Results:   The median patient age was 73 years (interquartile range, 70-77 years). After a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 25 men died of prostate cancer. After adjusting for age and prostate cancer prognostic factors, the risk of PCSM was significantly less (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.68; P = .004) for men who received CMT than for men who received brachytherapy alone. Other factors that were associated significantly with an increased risk of PCSM included a Gleason score of 8 to 10 (P = .017).

We allocated 26,700 consecutive patients tested during 1986-1998 for H. pylori antibodies to 3 subcohorts: seropositive patients with rapidly falling antibody titers (Hp+CURED, n = 3,650), seropositive patients where no serological information indicating cure was obtained (Hp+NoInfo, n = 11,638) and seronegative patients (Hp-, n = 11,422). In the subcohorts, the standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were defined for subsequent cancers of stomach, pancreas, colon, rectum, breast and prostate separately and for all cancers except stomach combined. The mean follow-up time was 10.1 years and the number of gastric cancers was 72.

The objective of this study was to compare mortality among African-American and Caucasian cancer patients and to evaluate the influence of attendance at a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive or clinical cancer center.  Methods:   The authors conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of Medicare beneficiaries with an incident diagnosis of lung, breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer between 1998 and 2002 who were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of NCI cancer center attendance and race on all-cause and cancer-specific mortality at 1 year and 3 years after diagnosis.  Results:   The likelihood of 1-year and 3-year all-cause and cancer-specific mortality was higher for African Americans than for Caucasians in crude and adjusted models (cancer-specific adjusted: Caucasian referent, 1-year odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.19; 3-year OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30). By cancer site, cancer-specific mortality was higher among African Americans at 1 year for breast and colorectal cancers and for all cancers at 3 years. NCI cancer center attendance was associated with significantly lower odds of mortality for African Americans (1-year OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.56-0.76; 3-year OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62-0.81). With Caucasians as the referent group, the excess mortality risk among African Americans no longer was observed for all-cause or cancer-specific mortality risk among patients who attended NCI cancer centers (cancer-specific mortality:1-year OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.76-1.19; 3-year OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82-1.21).  Conclusions:   African-American Medicare beneficiaries with lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers had higher mortality compared with their Caucasian counterparts; however, there were no significant differences in mortality by race among those who attended NCI cancer centers.

Methods:   A total of 22,562 men who were evaluated for infertility from 1967 to 1998 were identified from 15 California infertility centers and linked to the California Cancer Registry. The incidence of prostate cancer was compared with the incidence in an age-matched and geography-matched sample of men from the general population. The risk of prostate cancer in men with and those without male factor infertility was modeled using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.  Results:   A total of 168 cases of prostate cancer that developed after infertility were identified. Men evaluated for infertility but not necessarily with male factors were not found to have an increased risk of cancer compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.8-1.1). This risk was found to be highest for men with male factor infertility who developed high-grade prostate cancer (SIR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0). On multivariate analyses, men with male factor infertility were found to be 2.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with high-grade prostate cancer (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4-4.8).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the concordance of GS and WHO grading in biopsy and definitive histology and to -determine parameters influencing the diagnostic accuracy of the biopsy and the prognosis.  Materials and methods:   Within a 10-year-period before modification of the GS, radical prostatectomy was performed in 856 patients (study group, SG; mean age 64.2 years). The grade of agreement between GS and WHO grading in biopsy and definitive histology was calculated by kappa statistics (kappa) (for the complete and single time -periods). Furthermore, we assessed the univariable and multivariable influence of different preoperatively available parameters on disease-free survival (DFS). The mean follow-up period was 39 months (range: 10-139 months).  Results:   Undergrading of GS and WHO grading decreased continuously within the three time -periods in favour of a higher agreement regarding the histological results revealed from biopsy and definitive histology. However, we found only a poor to moderate agreement in the complete time period (kappa values of 0.354 for GS and 0.404 for WHO grading) that - with regard to both parameters - was improved by an increased number of biopsy cores taken. PSA value, clinical -tumour stage, number of positive cores (dichotomised at 34 %), annual RP case load (dichotomised at 75), and GS revealed an independent significant influence on DFS. Patients with GS 2-4 in the biopsy exhibited an upgrade to GS > or = 7 in only 5.7 %, and -showed, -independent of the definitive histology, a significantly better prognosis in comparison with patients presenting with a higher GS.  Conclusions:   The results of the present study again suggest the independent prognostic impact of the GS revealed from biopsy. However, the concordance with the GS in the definitive histology remains deficient and is improvable by taking a higher number of biopsy cores. Although the elimination of GS 2-4 might be comprehensible for the pathologist's purpose, it results in a considerable loss of pretherapeutic prognostic information.""","""['M May', 'S Brookman-May', 'S Lebentrau', 'C Gilfrich', 'V Loy', 'F Theissig', 'J Roigas', 'B Hoschke', 'M Burger', 'K Miller']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Should we abstain from Gleason score 2-4 in the diagnosis of prostate cancer?

Genotyping individuals for these variations has the potential to help redefine how pharmacologic agents undergo clinical development. By identifying carriers of known genomic variants that contribute to susceptibility, a high-risk population can be defined, as well as individuals with potential for a better response to a drug. We evaluated the potential utility that selecting individuals for a trial on the basis of genotypes identified in contemporary GWA studies would have had on recently described clinical trials. We pursued this by constraining both the risks of a disease outcome associated with particular genotypes and overall drug responses to those actually observed in genetic association and clinical trial studies, respectively. We pursued these evaluations in the context of clinical trials investigating drugs for macular degeneration, obesity, heart disease, type II diabetes, prostate cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. We show that the increase in incidence of outcomes in trials restricted to individuals with specific genotypic profiles can result in substantial reductions in requisite sample sizes for such trials.

However, pure genistein promoted increased metastasis to lymph nodes. A mixture of soy isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein) did not cause increased metastasis, but potentiated radiotherapy. We tested whether daidzein could negate genistein-induced metastasis.  Methods:   Mice bearing PC-3 prostate tumors were treated with daidzein, genistein or both, and with tumor irradiation. Primary tumors and metastases were evaluated. The effects of each isoflavone and soy were compared in vitro using PC-3 (AR-) and C4-2B (AR+) androgen-independent PCa cell lines.  Results:   Daidzein did not increase metastasis to lymph nodes and acted as a radiosensitizer for prostate tumors. Daidzein inhibited cell growth and enhanced radiation in vitro but at doses higher than genistein or soy. Daidzein caused milder effects on inhibition of expression and/or activities of APE1/Ref-1, HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB in PC-3 and C4-2B cells.  Conclusions:   Daidzein could be the component of soy that protects against genistein-induced metastasis.

To explore safety and efficacy, this was tested in mice and in human patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Preclinical efficacy of the combination therapy was evaluated in PC3 xenograft mice. Sixty patients with progressive metastatic CRPC received intravenous docetaxel and bevacizumab plus oral thalidomide and prednisone. The primary end point was a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of > or = 50%. Secondary end points included time to progression, overall survival, and safety. Results In the mouse model, combination therapy of docetaxel, bevacizumab, and thalidomide inhibited tumor growth most effectively. In the clinical trial, 90% of patients receiving the combination therapy had PSA declines of > or = 50%, and 88% achieved a PSA decline of > or = 30% within the first 3 months of treatment. The median time to progression was 18.3 months, and the median overall survival was 28.2 months in this group with a Halabi-predicted survival of 14 months. While toxicities were manageable, all patients developed grade 3/4 neutropenia. CONCLUSION The addition of bevacizumab and thalidomide to docetaxel is a highly active combination with manageable toxicities. The estimated median survival is encouraging, given the generally poor prognosis of this patient population. These results suggest that definitive clinical trials combining antiangiogenic agent combinations with docetaxel are warranted to improve treatment outcomes for patients with metastatic CRPC.""","""['Yang-Min Ning', 'James L Gulley', 'Philip M Arlen', 'Sukyung Woo', 'Seth M Steinberg', 'John J Wright', 'Howard L Parnes', 'Jane B Trepel', 'Min-Jung Lee', 'Yeong Sang Kim', 'Haihao Sun', 'Ravi A Madan', 'Lea Latham', 'Elizabeth Jones', 'Clara C Chen', 'William D Figg', 'William L Dahut']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial comparing docetaxel and prednisone with or without bevacizumab in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: CALGB 90401.', 'A phase 2 study of estramustine, docetaxel, and bevacizumab in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer: results from Cancer and Leukemia Group B Study 90006.', 'Reversal of docetaxel resistance with bevacizumab and thalidomide.', 'Docetaxel: a review of its use for the first-line treatment of advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Future directions in the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Potential Use of Thalidomide in Glioblastoma Treatment: An Updated Brief Overview.', 'Current Status of Monoclonal Antibodies-Based Therapies in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials.', 'Angiogenesis and Anti-Angiogenic Treatment in Prostate Cancer: Mechanisms of Action and Molecular Targets.', 'Resistance to second-generation androgen receptor antagonists in prostate cancer.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery: A Comprehensive Review of Data-driven and Machine Learning Approaches.']"""

AR is known to assemble coactivator complexes at target promoters to facilitate transcriptional activation in response to androgens. Here we identify the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) as a novel coregulator of androgen-responsive transcription. We demonstrate that CHD8 directly associates with AR and that CHD8 and AR simultaneously localize to the TMPRSS2 enhancer after androgen treatment. In the LNCaP cell line, reduction of CHD8 levels by small interfering RNA treatment severely diminishes androgen-dependent activation of the TMPRSS2 gene. We demonstrate that the recruitment of AR to the TMPRSS2 promoter in response to androgen treatment requires CHD8. Finally, CHD8 facilitates androgen-stimulated proliferation of LNCaP cells, emphasizing the physiological importance of CHD8.

Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective study of 57 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer who underwent endorectal MRI with DWI between July 2007 and March 2008. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on ADC maps at sites of visible tumor on DW images and ADC maps. A hierarchic mixed linear model was used to compare the ADC value of prostate cancer with the Gleason score and the percentage of tumor on core biopsy.  Results:   Eighty-one sites of biopsy-proven prostate cancer were visible on DW images and ADC maps. The least-squares mean ADC for disease with a Gleason score of 6 was 0.860 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (standard error of the mean [SEM], 0.036); Gleason score of 7, 0.702 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (SEM, 0.030); Gleason score of 8, 0.672 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (SEM, 0.057); and Gleason score of 9, 0.686 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (SEM, 0.067). Differences between the mean ADC values for a prostate tumor with a Gleason score of 6 and one with a Gleason score of 7 (p = 0.0096) and for a prostate tumor with a Gleason score of 6 and one with a Gleason score of 8 (p = 0.0460) were significant. Comparison between the ADC and percentage of tumor on core biopsy showed a mean ADC decrease of 0.006 (range, 0.004-0.008 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) for every 1% increase in tumor in the core biopsy specimen.  Conclusion:   DWI may help differentiate between low-risk (Gleason score, 6) and intermediate-risk (Gleason score, 7) prostate cancer and between low-risk (Gleason score, 6) and high-risk (Gleason score > 7) prostate cancer.

CRPC is thought to result from augmented activation of the androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway, which could be enhanced by AR cofactors. In this study, heterochromatin protein 1beta (HP1beta), but not HP1alpha or HP1gamma was found to be an AR cofactor. HP1beta interacted with the AR, and enhanced the DNA-binding ability of AR to androgen-responsive element in the prostate-specific antigen enhancer and promoter regions, and to increase the transcription of AR target genes. In prostate cancer (PCa) tissues, HP1beta expressions correlated with Gleason score and tri-methylation levels of histone H3 lysine 9. Silencing of HP1beta suppressed the growth of AR-expressing PCa cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest at the G(1) phase, similar to inhibition of androgen/AR signaling. Furthermore, HP1beta was overexpressed in castration-resistant LNCaP derivative CxR cells, and HP1beta knockdown also suppressed the cell growth in CxR cells. These findings indicate that HP1beta is involved in the proliferation of AR-expressing PCa cells and progression to CRPC as an AR coactivator.

This study was to examine serum expression of EPCA and to further clarify the relationship between initial serum EPCA levels and the presence of subsequent cancer in the individuals with isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). An indirect ELISA was used for initial serum EPCA measurement in 112 men with isolated HGPIN, who were enrolled and completed a follow-up of >or=5 years. All patients had a detectable concentration of EPCA in the initial serum, with a mean of 0.64+/-0.13 absorbance at 450 nm. Thirty-three patients had an initial serum EPCA level of >or=1.10, in which 31 cases were subsequently identified as having prostate cancer on follow-up. However, in the remaining 79 cases, serum EPCA levels were all <1.10, and none was diagnosed with cancer later. Statistical analysis showed a significantly higher serum ECPA level in isolated HGPIN patients with subsequent cancer than those without cancer (P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves showed that serum EPCA level had better predictive accuracy of cancer onset on follow-up than prostate specific antigen velocity and abnormal digital rectal examination findings. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated the predictive performance independently by initial serum EPCA>or=1.10 absorbance (relative risk, 3.32; 95% confidence intervals, 2.62-5.03, P<0.001).

Recently, prostate specific antigen (PSA) population screening has been evaluated in two major randomised, controlled studies. Even though the more mature European study confirmed that PSA screening is capable of reducing prostate cancer mortality, anxieties still persist, particularly surrounding the issue of overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant cancer. The recent identification of 29 genetic variants that predispose towards prostate cancer offers another, more targeted, opportunity to reduce mortality. It also raises the possibility of the identification of a sub-group of men who are especially susceptible to prostate cancer. In lower-risk patients with localised cancer active surveillance may be sufficient. In fitter men, with more clinically significant disease, eradication of the cancer by surgical removal of the gland is often involved. This is the only treatment which has been proven in a randomised controlled trial to reduce the rate of metastases and mortality compared with watchful waiting. Metastatic prostate cancer is associated with high mortality--approximately 70% within 5 years.

This study compared PSA levels and PSA doubling time (PSADT) to predict [(11)C]choline PET/CT findings.  Methods:   PSADT was retrospectively calculated in 170 prostate cancer (PCa) patients with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy who underwent [(11)C]choline PET/CT. PSADT was calculated as PSADT = ln2/m, where m is the slope of the linear regression line of the natural log of PSA values. At least three PSA measurements were used (median: 4; range: 3-16), separated by at least 3 months, each with a minimum increase of 0.20 ng/ml. PET/CT findings were validated using criteria based on histological analysis and clinical and imaging data. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test, chi-square test, analysis of variance and binary logistic regression. Regression-based coefficients were used to develop a nomogram predicting the probability of positive [(11)C]choline PET/CT and 200 bootstrap resamples were used for internal validation.  Results:   The median PSA was 1.25 ng/ml (range: 0.23-48.6 ng/ml), and the median PSADT was 7.0 months (range: 0.97-45.3 months). [(11)C]choline PET/CT was positive in 75 of 170 patients (44%). PET/CT findings were validated using histological criteria (11%) and clinical and imaging criteria (89%). The overall accuracy of [(11)C]choline PET/CT was 88%. Multivariate logistic regression showed that high PSA and short PSADT were significant (p < 0.05) predictors of positive [(11)C]choline PET/CT [PSA: odds ratio (OR) = 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-1.78; PSADT: OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.04-1.21]. The percentage of patients with positive [(11)C]choline PET/CT was 27% for PSADT >6 months, 61% for PSADT between 3 and 6 months and 81% for PSADT <3 months. The percentage of patients who displayed pathological [(11)C]choline uptake in the skeleton significantly increased (p < 0.05) from 3% for PSADT >6 months to 52% for PSADT <3 months. Conversely, patients who displayed pathological [(11)C]choline uptake in the prostatectomy bed were 0% for PSADT <3 months and 17% for PSADT >6 months (p < 0.05). A nomogram based on age, PSA, PSADT, time to trigger PSA, Gleason score, pathological stage and androgen deprivation therapy demonstrated bootstrap-corrected predictive accuracy of 81%.  Conclusion:   Like PSA, PSADT is an independent predictor of [(11)C]choline PET/CT. [(11)C]choline PET/CT is very sensitive to PCa tumour growth, as reflected by PSA kinetics. PSADT should be taken into account by physicians when referring PCa patients for [(11)C]choline PET/CT.""","""['Giampiero Giovacchini', 'Maria Picchio', 'Vincenzo Scattoni', 'Rita Garcia Parra', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Luigi Gianolli', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Cristina Messa']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Is there a role for ¹¹C-choline PET/CT in the early detection of metastatic disease in surgically treated prostate cancer patients with a mild PSA increase <1.5 ng/ml?', 'Influence of trigger PSA and PSA kinetics on 11C-Choline PET/CT detection rate in patients with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen velocity versus prostate-specific antigen doubling time for prediction of 11C choline PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy.', 'The role of choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of patients with prostate-specific antigen progression after radical treatment of prostate cancer.', '11C-choline PET/CT and PSA kinetics.', 'Synthetic correlated diffusion imaging hyperintensity delineates clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Imaging for Metastasis in Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Literature.', '11C-choline PET/CT predicts survival in prostate cancer patients with PSA\u2009<\u20091 NG/ml.', 'Trigger pSA predicting recurrence from positive choline PET/CT with prostate cancer after initial treatment.', 'Metabolic Vulnerabilities of Prostate Cancer: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Opportunities.']"""

Sentinel node visualization requires sufficient nodal tracer uptake. We evaluated the effect of an increase in particle concentration on preoperative and intraoperative sentinel node depiction.  Methods:   Enrolled in the study were 50 consecutive patients with prostate cancer. The first 25 patients (group A) received nanocolloid with standard labelling (0.4 ml (99m)Tc per 0.1 mg nanocolloid). The last 25 patients (group B) received nanocolloid with a reduced labelling dilution volume (0.4 ml (99m)Tc per 0.2 mg nanocolloid). The aimed injected volume and dosage were the same for both groups (225 MBq in 0.4 ml). Intratumoral tracer injection was followed by planar lymphoscintigraphy (15 min and 2 h), SPECT/CT and laparoscopic sentinel lymphadenectomy. Lymph node visualization was evaluated using a four-point scoring system (0 nonvisualization to 3 intense visualization) and count quantification on the 2-h anterior lymphoscintigram. In addition to the gamma ray detection probe, a portable gamma camera was used for intraoperative sentinel node visualization.  Results:   Preoperative visualization in group A was 88% (mean 2.0 sentinel nodes per patient) versus 100% in group B (mean 2.6 sentinel nodes per patient). Visualization scores (p=0.008), total counts (p=0.001) and maximum counts per pixel (p=0.034) in the sentinel nodes were significantly better in group B. This also led to more efficient intraoperative detection of the sentinel nodes with the portable gamma camera (84% in group A versus 100% in group B).

Unlike CTCF, the expression of BORIS is normally restricted to specific cells in testes (the only cells where CTCF is not expressed), where it may play a role in reprogramming the methylation pattern of male germ line DNA. Frequent amplification of the 20q13.2 region, which contains the BORIS gene, and expression of BORIS transcripts in diverse human tumors and cell lines have led to the hypothesis that aberrant expression of BORIS may play a role in tumorigenesis by interfering with CTCF functions. However, recent studies using more quantitative methods indicate low frequency of BORIS expression in melanoma, ovarian, prostate, and bladder carcinomas. To investigate the relationship between chromosome 20q13 amplification and BORIS mRNA levels within breast cancer cell lines and tissues, we developed a quantitative RT-PCR assay to measure the levels of BORIS mRNA. Endpoint RT-PCR assays were also used to investigate the possible expression of alternatively spliced variants. Using multiple primer sets and controls, we found that neither mature BORIS transcripts nor spliced variants are commonly expressed at detectable levels in malignant breast cells or tissues, although endogenous BORIS transcripts can be induced in MCF-7 cells following 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. In conclusion, in most breast cancer cells, endogenous BORIS is unlikely to be expressed at sufficient levels to interfere with CTCF functions.

AIB1 has an important role in malignancy of several cancers such as breast and prostate cancers. However, its involvement in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains unclear. Here, we found that AIB1 protein was overexpressed in 23 of 34 human HCC specimens (68%). Down-regulation of AIB1 reduced HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, colony formation ability and tumorigenic potential in nude mice. These phenotypic changes caused by AIB1 knockdown correlated with increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1/Waf1) and decreased Akt activation and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and matrix metallopeptidase MMP-9. In agreement with these findings, clinical AIB1-positive HCC expressed higher levels of PCNA than AIB1-negative HCC. A positive correlation was established between the levels of AIB1 protein and PCNA protein in HCC, suggesting that AIB1 may contribute to HCC cell proliferation. In addition, MMP-9 expression in AIB1-postive HCC was significantly higher than that in AIB1-negative HCC, suggesting that AIB1-postive HCC may be more invasive. Collectively, our results show that overexpression of AIB1 promotes human HCC progression by enhancing cell proliferation and invasiveness.

A Monte Carlo model was used to simulate 6 MV and 18 MV photon beams from a Varian 2100 accelerator with the flattening filter in place and with it removed. The out-of-field photon doses and composition (head leakage, patient scatter and collimator scatter) were calculated from square open fields in a water tank as a function of distance from central axis, field size and depth. The out-of-field doses resulting from intensity-modulated radiation therapy to the prostate at 6 MV were also calculated, with and without the flattening filter, to sensitive organs in an anthropomorphic Rando phantom. Removal of the flattening filter reduced the out-of-field dose near the treatment field (<3 cm from the field edge) because of decreased collimator scatter. It increased the out-of-field dose at intermediate distances from the field edge (3-15 cm) because of increased patient scatter. At greater distances, the out-of-field dose was decreased because of reduced head leakage. For the clinical treatment examined, the out-of-field dose was generally reduced following removal of the flattening filter, particularly at large distances from the treatment field. Removal of the flattening filter may be advantageous by reducing the out-of-field dose to the patient. This could contribute to reducing the long-term risk of secondary malignancies. In general, however, the out-of-field dose depends on treatment and patient parameters, and a reduction may not always be achievable.""","""['Stephen F Kry', 'Oleg N Vassiliev', 'Radhe Mohan']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Flattening filter free beams in SBRT and IMRT: dosimetric assessment of peripheral doses.', 'The characterization of unflattened photon beams from a 6 MV linear accelerator.', 'A direction-selective flattening filter for clinical photon beams.

Identifying patients with an aggressive tumor will therefore help to improve prostate cancer management.

These case control studies were conducted using research assay components; to facilitate its use in a diagnostic setting, the PITX2 biomarker was transferred to a validated diagnostic platform, the Affymetrix GeneChip System. A customized microarray (Epichip PITX2) was designed using features in high redundancy to ensure a robust determination of the methylation state of the PITX2 promoter. The developed method allowed for accurate assessment of prognosis in prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Determination of PITX2 methylation in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples from a cohort of 157 prostatectomy patients resulted in an excellent level of concordance of the clinical classification, as well as the measured output between the research assay and the Epichip PITX2.

Materials and methods:   A total of 376 men with a median age of 65.5 years (range 45.8 to 79.5) with low risk prostate cancer on surveillance underwent at least 1 followup biopsy after diagnosis. Progression was defined at surveillance biopsy as Gleason pattern 4 or 5, greater than 2 biopsy cores with cancer or greater than 50% involvement of any core with cancer. Proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate the association between covariates and progression at surveillance biopsy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the probability of disease progression.  Results:   Of the 376 men 123 (32.7%) had progression a median of 5.6 years (range 0.3 to 8.5) after diagnosis. Percent free PSA and maximum percent core involvement at diagnosis were associated with progression, allowing stratification of the progression risk at initial surveillance biopsy. Cancer presence and PSA density at initial surveillance biopsy were associated with subsequent progression, allowing stratification of the cumulative incidence of progression 3 years after initial surveillance biopsy (cumulative incidence 11.1%, 95% CI 4.7 to 25.2 for negative biopsy and PSAD less than 0.08 ng/ml/cm(3) vs 53.6%, 95% CI 38.6 to 70.0 for positive biopsy and PSAD 0.08 ng/ml/cm(3) or greater, log rank test p <0.0001).

In the present study we have investigated the relationship between 12-LOX and hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a transcription factor involved in the regulation of VEGF expression under hypoxic conditions in solid tumors. Our findings have revealed that HIF-1 is one of the target transcription factors regulated by 12-LOX and 12(S)-HETE, in hypoxic tumor cells of the prostate. Regulation of HIF-1alpha by 12-LOX adds to the complexity of pathways mediated by this enzyme in promoting prostate cancer angiogenesis and metastasis.

Increasing evidence suggests that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) as a nutrient, OO as a food, and the MedDiet as a food pattern are associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A MedDiet rich in OO and OO per se has been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid profiles, blood pressure, postprandial hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and antithrombotic profiles. Some of these beneficial effects can be attributed to the OO minor components. Therefore, the definition of the MedDiet should include OO. Phenolic compounds in OO have shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, prevent lipoperoxidation, induce favorable changes of lipid profile, improve endothelial function, and disclose antithrombotic properties. Observational studies from Mediterranean cohorts have suggested that dietary MUFA may be protective against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies consistently support the concept that the OO-rich MedDiet is compatible with healthier aging and increased longevity. In countries where the population adheres to the MedDiet, such as Spain, Greece and Italy, and OO is the principal source of fat, rates of cancer incidence are lower than in northern European countries. Experimental and human cellular studies have provided new evidence on the potential protective effect of OO on cancer. Furthermore, results of case-control and cohort studies suggest that MUFA intake including OO is associated with a reduction in cancer risk (mainly breast, colorectal and prostate cancers).""","""['J López-Miranda', 'F Pérez-Jiménez', 'E Ros', 'R De Caterina', 'L Badimón', 'M I Covas', 'E Escrich', 'J M Ordovás', 'F Soriguer', 'R Abiá', 'C Alarcón de la Lastra', 'M Battino', 'D Corella', 'J Chamorro-Quirós', 'J Delgado-Lista', 'D Giugliano', 'K Esposito', 'R Estruch', 'J M Fernandez-Real', 'J J Gaforio', 'C La Vecchia', 'D Lairon', 'F López-Segura', 'P Mata', 'J A Menéndez', 'F J Muriana', 'J Osada', 'D B Panagiotakos', 'J A Paniagua', 'P Pérez-Martinez', 'J Perona', 'M A Peinado', 'M Pineda-Priego', 'H E Poulsen', 'J L Quiles', 'M C Ramírez-Tortosa', 'J Ruano', 'L Serra-Majem', 'R Solá', 'M Solanas', 'V Solfrizzi', 'R de la Torre-Fornell', 'A Trichopoulou', 'M Uceda', 'J M Villalba-Montoro', 'J R Villar-Ortiz', 'F Visioli', 'N Yiannakouris']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis""","""['International conference on the healthy effect of virgin olive oil.', 'The protective effect of the Mediterranean diet: focus on cancer and cardiovascular risk.', 'The influence of olive oil on human health: not a question of fat alone.', 'Mediterranean diet and metabolic diseases.', 'Adherence to the Mediterranean diet and risk of metabolic syndrome and its components.', 'Mid- and long-term changes in satiety-related hormones, lipid and glucose metabolism, and inflammation after a Mediterranean diet intervention with the goal of losing weight: A randomized, clinical trial.', 'Unsaturated guluronate oligosaccharide used as a stabilizer of oil-in-water nanoemulsions loaded with bioactive nutrients.', 'The Effect of Short-term Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) Diet on Hunger Hormones, Anthropometric Parameters, and Brain Structures in Middle-aged Overweight and Obese Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', ""EVOO's Effects on Incretin Production: Is There a Rationale for a Combination in T2DM Therapy?"", 'Authenticity in Olive Oils from an Empeltre Clonal Selection in Aragon (Spain): How Environmental, Agronomic, and Genetic Factors Affect Sterol Composition.']"""

Zoledronic acid is a potent bisphosphonate that can prevent osteoporosis in patients with nonmetastatic (M0), prostate cancer (CaP) who are initiating ADT. The effect of zoledronic acid on patients with pre-existing osteoporosis on ADT, who are highest risk for fracture, has not been adequately studied.  Methods:   We enrolled 28 patients with M0 CaP on ADT with severe osteopenia or osteoporosis (baseline bone-mineral density (BMD) T score < -2.0) in this open-label, single-arm trial to assess the effect of zoledronic acid on BMD. All patients also received supplemental calcium and vitamin D, and were counseled about lifestyle modifications. Patients received zoledronic acid (4 mg) intravenously every 3 months for 4 treatments. BMD was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan at enrollment, 6 and 12 months. Primary endpoint was percent change in lumbar spine BMD.  Results:   This was a high-risk patient population-primarily older Caucasians (mean age, 73 years), former smokers, and moderate users of alcohol. Mean duration of ADT was 2.4 years. Pre-existing osteopenia or osteoporosis was observed in a single site in 9 patients and multiple sites in 19 (68%). After 12 months of zoledronic acid, lumbar spine BMD increased 4.17% (P < .0001), and BMD increased significantly (P < .05) in both hips and the right femoral neck. Seven patients (25%) experienced improved BMD into the nonosteoporotic range (T score > -2.0). Zoledronic acid infusion was well tolerated and without substantial renal toxicity.  Conclusions:   Zoledronic acid improves BMD in men with M0 CaP on ADT with severe osteopenia or osteoporosis (T scores < 2.0).

A Cox proportional hazards model using stepwise selection was used to identify independent predictors of poor outcome.  Results:   TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was detected in 114 cases (50.4%). We noted no association between fusion gene status and prostate cancer clinicopathological characteristics. However, when patients were grouped by TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene status, different clinicopathological prognostic factors defined each group for biochemical and clinical progression-free survival. Prostate specific antigen, specimen Gleason score and margin status were independent prognostic factors in patients with prostate cancer expressing the fusion gene. In the nonexpressing TMPRSS2-ERG group the prognostic factors were cT, Gleason score and margins.

Correlations between alleles, and recurrence and survival data were investigated using univariate and multivariate genetic analysis models.  Results:   There was a statistically significant association between the single nucleotide polymorphism rs884419 and prostate cancer recurrence, as defined in the study by at least prostate specific antigen biochemical recurrence (log rank test p <0.001). The incidence of the recurrence risk enhancing genotype A/A was 3.1% vs 17.4% and 80% for the risk decreasing genotypes A/G G/G, respectively. Based on Cox proportional hazard regression modeling patients carrying G/G and A/G genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer recurrence compared to those with the A/A genotype (HR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.41 and 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.46, respectively, p <0.002).  Conclusions:   These data suggest that a polymorphism flanking the EGFR gene is an independent prognostic genetic biomarker that predicts prostate cancer biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.""","""['Carmen A Perez', 'Heidi Chen', 'Yu Shyr', 'Regina Courtney', 'Wei Zheng', 'Qiuyin Cai', 'Misun Hwang', 'Jerry Jaboin', 'Stephen Schleicher', 'Luigi Moretti', 'Marcia Wills', 'Joseph A Smith', 'Bo Lu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['The matrix metalloproteinase-7 polymorphism rs10895304 is associated with increased recurrence risk in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Multicenter clinical validation of PITX2 methylation as a prostate specific antigen recurrence predictor in patients with post-radical prostatectomy prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of prostate cancer susceptibility variants on prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic Value of Prostaglandin-endoperoxide Synthase 2 Polymorphisms in Prostate Cancer Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Influence of cytokine gene polymorphisms on prostate-specific antigen recurrence in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in prostate cancer: its implications in diagnostics and therapeutics.', 'A case-control study of the association between the EGFR gene and glioma risk in a Chinese Han population.', 'Association Study of Polymorphisms of Epidermal Growth Factor and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in a Korean Population.', 'Prostate Cancer in African American Men: The Effect of Androgens and microRNAs on Epidermal Growth Factor Signaling.', 'Genetic variation: effect on prostate cancer.']"""

The G2/M arrest was accompanied by activation of the mitotic checkpoint, a pre-requisite for induction of optimal apoptosis. Attenuation of mitotic checkpoint by siRNA duplexes led to a reduction in mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Our results further demonstrated participation of an intrinsic mitochondrially mediated apoptotic pathway that ultimately triggered caspase-driven EM011-induced apoptosis.

Materials and methods:   Twenty prostate cancer patients were recruited for this retrospective study. All patients have been treated with IMRT. For each patient, MR and CT images were fused for target and critical structure delineation. IMRT treatment planning was performed on the simulation CT images. Inter-fractional motion during the course of treatment was corrected using a CT-on-rails system. The rectum was outlined on both the original treatment plan and the subsequent daily CT images from the CT-on-rails by the same investigator. Dose distributions on these daily CT images were recalculated with the isocenter shifts relative to the simulation CT images using the leaf sequences/MUs based on the original treatment plan. The rectal doses from the subsequent daily CTs were compared with the original doses planned on the simulation CT using our clinical acceptance criteria.  Results:   Based on 20 patients with 139 daily CT sets, 28% of the subsequent treatment dose distributions did not meet our criterion of V(40) < 35%, and 27% did not meet our criterion of V(65) < 17%. The inter-fractional rectal volume variation is significant for some patients.  Conclusions:   Due to the large inter-fractional variation of the rectal volume, it is more favorable to plan prostate IMRT based on an empty rectum and deliver treatment to patients with an empty rectum. Over 70% of actual treatments showed better rectal doses than our clinical acceptance criteria. A significant fraction (27%) of the actual treatments would benefit from adaptive image-guided radiotherapy based on daily CT images.""","""['Lili Chen', 'Kamen Paskalev', 'Xiu Xu', 'Jennifer Zhu', 'Lu Wang', 'Robert A Price', 'Wei Hu', 'Steven J Feigenberg', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Alan Pollack', 'C M Charlie Ma']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Rectal wall sparing by dosimetric effect of rectal balloon used during intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer.', 'Persistently better treatment planning results of intensity-modulated (IMRT) over conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in prostate cancer patients with significant variation of clinical target volume and/or organs-at-risk.', 'Phase II dose escalation study of image-guided adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer: use of dose-volume constraints to achieve rectal isotoxicity.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Normal Tissue Risk Estimation Using Biological Knowledge-Based Fuzzy Logic in Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy of Prostate Cancer: Rectum.', 'Management of Motion and Anatomical Variations in Charged Particle Therapy: Past, Present, and Into the Future.', 'Dosimetric impact of organ at risk daily variation during prostate stereotactic ablative radiotherapy.', 'Interfraction variation and dosimetric changes during image-guided radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Autosegmentation of the rectum on megavoltage image guidance scans.']"""

Methods:   This single center, prospective study included 38 prostate cancer patients surgically or medically castrated who had PSA increases above their nadir after previous antiandrogen manipulation and in absence of bone metastases. Patients were given daily dose of bicalutamide 150 mg. Clinical evaluations and serum PSA testing were performed every 3 months. Response was defined according to PSA decline from baseline as if ≥ 50% or ≥ 85%. The duration of response was the time from entering into study until PSA increased ≥ 25% or ≥ 2 ng/ml from the nadir. Bone scintigraphy was repeated at PSA increase or at symptom appearance.  Results:   The mean follow-up was 34.5 months (range, 3-75.2).

Less is known about the usefulness of preoperative prostate specific antigen doubling time for the initial prediction of prostatectomy outcomes.  Materials and methods:   Preoperative prostate specific antigen doubling time was calculated in 1,208 men from a large prostate cancer screening study who were treated with radical prostatectomy. We examined the relationship of prostate specific antigen doubling time with tumor features and biochemical progression-free survival.  Results:   Overall prostate specific antigen doubling time was associated with nonorgan confined disease (OR 0.996, 95% CI 0.992-0.999, p = 0.013) but not with biochemical progression (HR 1.000, 95% CI 0.998-1.001, p = 0.66). Using previously published 18 and 36-month thresholds for prostate specific antigen doubling time there was no significant relationship between doubling time and specific adverse pathological features or biochemical progression. Using the concordance index prostate specific antigen doubling time did not enhance the prediction of biochemical progression beyond that achieved by a model with prostate specific antigen, clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score.  Conclusions:   In our series of men with newly diagnosed, clinically localized prostate cancer shorter preoperative prostate specific antigen doubling time was associated with nonorgan confined disease but not with biochemical progression after radical prostatectomy.

Results:   A total of 785 patients treated between February 2000 and December 2008 were included in the analysis with a mean followup of 24 months. All health related quality of life domains were adversely affected by all treatments and recovery profiles varied significantly by treatment type. Overall urinary function and bother outcomes scored significantly higher after brachytherapy and cryotherapy compared to open radical prostatectomy and robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Brachytherapy and cryotherapy had a 3-fold higher rate of return to baseline urinary function compared to open radical prostatectomy and robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.

The barriers to pain and fatigue relief have been classified into three categories: patient, professional, and system barriers.  Objectives:   The overall objective of this trial as to test the effects of the ""Passport to Comfort"" intervention on reducing barriers to pain and fatigue management for ambulatory care cancer patients.  Methods:   This quasi-experimental, comparative study uses a Phase 1 control group of usual care followed sequentially by a Phase 2 intervention group in which educational and system-change efforts were directed toward improved pain and fatigue management. A sample of 187 cancer patients with breast, lung, colon, or prostate cancers, and a pain and/or fatigue rating of 4 or more (moderate to severe), were recruited. Patients in the intervention group received four educational sessions on pain/fatigue assessment and management, whereas patients in the control group received usual care. Pain and fatigue barriers and patient knowledge were measured at baseline, one month, and three months post-accrual.  Results:   Patients in the intervention group experienced significant improvements in pain and fatigue measures immediately postintervention, and these improvements were sustained over time.  Conclusion:   The ""Passport to Comfort"" intervention was effective in reducing patient barriers to pain and fatigue management as well as in increasing patient knowledge regarding pain and fatigue.

Continuous activation of the pathway can be caused by mutations of upstream targets such as KRAS and BRAF. However, rates of KRAS and BRAF mutations in prostate carcinoma are reported to vary in different populations. To date, there has been no such report in Chinese patients. In this study, we examined 121 samples of prostate carcinoma in Chinese subjects for mutations at codons 12 and 13 of KRAS and codon 600 of BRAF by means of the mutant-enriched polymerase chain reaction-coupled sequencing method. The identified KRAS and BRAF mutations were analyzed for association with tumor differentiation and clinical stage. The result showed that KRAS mutations were detected in 9.1% (11 of 121) of prostate carcinomas, while no BRAF mutation was found in any case studied. No association was found between KRAS mutation and clinicopathological characteristics of the tumors.

The PHSCN peptide (Ac-PHSCN-NH(2)) preferentially binds activated alpha5beta1, to block invasion in vitro, and inhibit growth, metastasis and tumor recurrence in preclinical models of prostate cancer. In Phase I clinical trial, systemic Ac-PHSCN-NH(2) monotherapy was well tolerated, and metastatic disease progression was prevented for 4-14 months in one-third of treated patients. We have developed a significantly more potent derivative, the PHSCN-polylysine dendrimer (Ac-PHSCNGGK-MAP). Using in vitro invasion assays with naturally serum-free basement membranes, we observed that the PHSCN dendrimer was 130- to 1900-fold more potent than the PHSCN peptide at blocking alpha5beta1-mediated invasion by DU 145 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells, whether invasion was induced by serum, or by the Ac-PHSRN-NH(2) peptide, under serum-free conditions. The PHSCN dendrimer was also approximately 800 times more effective than PHSCN peptide at preventing DU 145 and PC-3 extravasation in the lungs of athymic mice. Chou-Talalay analysis suggested that inhibition of both invasion in vitro and extravasation in vivo by the PHSCN dendrimer are highly synergistic. We found that many extravasated DU 145 and PC-3 cells go onto develop into metastatic colonies, and that a single pretreatment with the PHSCN dendrimer was 100-fold more affective than the PHSCN peptide at reducing lung colony formation. Since many patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer already have locally advanced or metastatic disease, the availability of a well-tolerated, nontoxic systemic therapy, like the PHSCN dendrimer, which prevents metastatic progression by inhibiting invasion, could be very beneficial.""","""['Hongren Yao', 'Donna M Veine', 'Zhao-Zhu Zeng', 'Kevin S Fay', 'Evan D Staszewski', 'Donna L Livant']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['A D-amino acid containing peptide as a potent, noncovalent inhibitor of α5β1 integrin in human prostate cancer invasion and lung colonization.', 'The PHSCN dendrimer as a more potent inhibitor of human breast cancer cell invasion, extravasation, and lung colony formation.', 'Therapeutic inhibition of breast cancer bone metastasis progression and lung colonization: breaking the vicious cycle by targeting α5β1 integrin.', 'Targeting invasion induction as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer.', 'RGD engineered dendrimer nanotherapeutic as an emerging targeted approach in cancer therapy.', 'Targeting integrin α5β1 in urological tumors: opportunities and challenges.', 'Bone Metastasis from Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Beta 1-integrin-c-Met cooperation reveals an inside-in survival signalling on autophagy-related endomembranes.', 'α5β1 integrin signaling mediates oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced inflammation and early atherosclerosis.', 'A D-amino acid containing peptide as a potent, noncovalent inhibitor of α5β1 integrin in human prostate cancer invasion and lung colonization.']"""

Although the mechanisms for arsenic-induced carcinogenesis are undefined, arsenic drives overaccumulation of stem cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs) in vivo and in vitro, indicating that these cells are a key target population. Disruption of stem cell population dynamics may be critical to acquisition of cancer phenotype. We tested the hypothesis that prostate stem cells have a survival selection advantage during arsenic exposure that favors their accumulation and facilitates their malignant transformation.  Methods:   Innate and acquired resistance to acute (24-72 hours of exposure) and chronic (6 weeks of exposure) arsenite-induced cytolethality and apoptosis were assessed in a human prostate stem cell line (WPE-stem) and the mature parental cell line (RWPE-1). Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and/or Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression of apoptosis-, stress-, and arsenic-related genes. Arsenic-, cadmium-, and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced isogenic malignant transformants of RWPE-1 cells were compared for acquisition of CSC-like qualities by holoclone and sphere formation assays, growth in soft agar, and expression of CSC biomarkers. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   WPE-stem cells showed innate resistance to arsenic-induced cytolethality (arsenite concentration lethal to 50% of the cells [LC(50)] = 32.4 microM, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 31.5 to 33.3 muM) and apoptosis compared with parental RWPE-1 cells (LC(50) = 10.4 muM, 95% CI = 7.4 to 13.4 microM). Compared with RWPE-1 cells, WPE-stem cells showed noticeably higher expression of antiapoptotic (ie, BCL2, MT), stress-related (ie, NFE2L2, SOD1, PRODH), and arsenic adaptation (ie, ABCC1, GSTP1) factors and noticeably lower expression of proapoptotic factors (ie, BAX, caspases 3, 7, 8, and 9). WPE-stem cells also showed hyper-adaptability to chronic arsenite exposure (5 microM, 6 weeks) compared with RWPE-1 cells (LC(50) = 94.7 vs 32.1 microM, difference = 62.6 muM, 95% CI = 53.3 to 71.9 muM) at levels that in previous work induced a malignant phenotype in RWPE-1 after 30 weeks of exposure. Quantification of CSC-like cells in isogenic RWPE-1 transformants showed that marked overproduction was unique to a malignant phenotype acquired in response to arsenic exposure but not in response to cadmium or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea exposure.  Conclusions:   An apparent stem cell survival advantage with regard to arsenic causes selection during malignant transformation that manifests itself as an overabundance of CSC-like cells specifically after arsenic-driven acquisition of malignant phenotype. The increased resistance to apoptosis and arsenite hyper-adaptability of WPE-stem cells suggests that arsenite transformation of RWPE-1 cells involves an increase in the number of CSC-like cells.""","""['Erik J Tokar', 'Wei Qu', 'Jie Liu', 'Wei Liu', 'Mukta M Webber', 'James M Phang', 'Michael P Waalkes']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Arsenic exposure transforms human epithelial stem/progenitor cells into a cancer stem-like phenotype.', 'Aberrant microRNA expression likely controls RAS oncogene activation during malignant transformation of human prostate epithelial and stem cells by arsenic.', 'Requirement of arsenic biomethylation for oxidative DNA damage.', 'Cooperation between NRF2-mediated transcription and MDIG-dependent epigenetic modifications in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis and cancer stem cells.', 'In Vitro Cell Transformation Assays: A Valuable Approach for Carcinogenic Potentiality Assessment of Nanomaterials.', 'A Comprehensive Transcriptomic Analysis of Arsenic-Induced Bladder Carcinogenesis.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'LncRNA DUXAP10 Upregulation and the Hedgehog Pathway Activation Are Critically Involved in Chronic Cadmium Exposure-Induced Cancer Stem Cell-Like Property.', 'Human prostate epithelial cells and prostate-derived stem cells malignantly transformed in vitro with sodium arsenite show impaired Toll like receptor -3 (TLR3)-associated anti-tumor pathway.', 'Mechanisms of the synergistic lung tumorigenic effect of arsenic and benzo(a)pyrene combined- exposure.']"""

It causes significant mortality and morbidity rates, which have motivated the search for prognostic factors to better tailor the individual management of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients. Nucleophosmin is a multifunctional protein that is involved in many cellular activities, such as, regulation of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and p14(ARF) and is associated with proliferative and growth suppressive roles in the cell.

DNA methylation of CpG islands is an epigenetic mechanism associated with gene silencing. Recent studies have demonstrated that methylation occurs early in prostate carcinogenesis and, furthermore, may contribute to androgen independence. The methylation status of the AR and IGF1R genes was evaluated in a series of prostate cancer cell lines corresponding to early (benign) and advanced (metastatic) stages of the disease. Results of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) experiments, methylation-specific PCR, and sodium bisulfite-direct DNA sequencing revealed that the AR promoter is hypermethylated in metastatic M12, but not in benign P69, cells. On the other hand, no methylation was seen in the IGF1R promoter at any stage of the disease. We show, however, that 5-Aza treatment, which caused demethylation of the AR promoter, led to a significant increase in IGF1R mRNA levels, whereas addition of the AR inhibitor flutamide decreased the IGF1R mRNA levels to basal values measured prior to the 5-Aza treatment. Given that the IGF1R gene has been identified as a downstream target for AR action, our data is consistent with a model in which the AR gene undergoes methylation during progression of the disease, leading to dysregulation of AR targets, including the IGF1R gene, at advanced metastatic stages.""","""['Hagit Schayek', 'Itay Bentov', 'Shihua Sun', 'Stephen R Plymate', 'Haim Werner']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Global methylation analysis identifies PITX2 as an upstream regulator of the androgen receptor and IGF-I receptor genes in prostate cancer.', ""Demethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in colorectal cancer cells targets genomic DNA whilst promoter CpG island methylation persists."", 'Epigenetic repression of regulator of G-protein signaling 2 promotes androgen-independent prostate cancer cell growth.', 'The androgen receptor messenger RNA: what do we know?', 'AR function in promoting metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Chromosome-specific segment size alterations are determinants of prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Pre-Clinical Evaluation of the Hypomethylating Agent Decitabine for the Treatment of T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.', 'The Interplay Between Non-coding RNAs and Insulin-Like Growth Factor Signaling in the Pathogenesis of Neoplasia.', 'Repurposing Old Drugs into New Epigenetic Inhibitors: Promising Candidates for Cancer Treatment?', 'Targeting DNA Methyltranferases in Urological Tumors.']"""

However, the association between PSA and cancer probably depends on a man's recent screening history.  Methods:   The authors examined the effect of prior screening on the ability to predict the risk of prostate cancer by using a previously reported, 4-kallikrein panel that included total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, and human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2). The study cohort comprised 1241 men in Gothenburg, Sweden who underwent biopsy for elevated PSA during their second or later visit for the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. The predictive accuracy of the 4-kallikrein panel was calculated.  Results:   Total PSA was not predictive of prostate cancer. The previously published 4-kallikrein model increased predictive accuracy compared with total PSA and age alone (area under the curve [AUC], 0.66 vs 0.51; P < .001) but was poorly calibrated and missed many cancers. A model that was developed with recently screened men provided important improvements in discrimination (AUC, 0.67 vs 0.56; P < .001). Using this model reduced the number of biopsies by 413 per 1000 men with elevated PSA, missed 60 of 216 low-grade cancers (Gleason score < or =6), but missed only 1 of 43 high-grade cancers.  Conclusions:   Previous participation in PSA screening dramatically changed the performance of statistical models that were designed to predict biopsy outcome. A 4-kallikrein panel was able to predict prostate cancer in men who had a recent screening history and provided independent confirmation that multiple kallikrein forms contribute important diagnostic information for men with elevated PSA.

Tm1 expression in prostate cancer has not previously been described. In this study, while demonstrating suppressed levels of Tm1 in the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC3, and DU-145 compared to normal prostate epithelial cell primary isolates (PrEC), a novel splice variant of the TPM2 gene was identified. Quantitative RT-PCR determined significantly greater levels of the transcript variant in all three prostate cancer cell lines than in normal prostate epithelial cells. Characterization of this novel variant demonstrated it to include exon 6b, previously thought unique to the muscle-specific beta-Tm isoform, with an exon arrangement of 1-2-3-4-5-6a-6b-7-8-10. Inclusion of exon 6b introduces a premature stop codon directly following the 6a-6b exon boundary. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of a truncated protein in prostate cancer cell lines that was absent in normal prostate epithelial cells. It is hypothesized that this truncated protein will result in suppression of Tm1 polymer formation required for actin filament association.

Methods:   One hundred fifty-three patients undergoing radiation therapy for various neoplasms at rural cancer centers in Minnesota completed the Mayo Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Survey and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations questionnaires. Data regarding CAM use was also compared with provider consultation notes in the medical record at the onset of radiation therapy to determine rates of patient disclosure of CAM use to their healthcare providers.  Results:   A total of 153 participants completed the study with 61.4% females and 38.6% males and a mean age of 64.9 years.

A new 24-chloro calcipotriene-based vitamin D3 analog (BGP-15) was synthesized and examined for antiproliferative activity in the androgen-dependent cell lines of prostate cancer (LNCaP) and breast cancer (MCF-7). The new analog led to significant decrease in cell viability in cultured LNCaP and MCF-7 cell lines compared with calcipotriene and 1,25(OH)2D3. We observed elevated vitamin D receptor protein levels in both LNCaP and MCF-7 cells, which were treated with 5 micromol/l of 1,25(OH)2D3, calcipotriene or BGP-15 for 20 h, indicating vitamin D receptor-binding ability. Treatments of LNCaP and MCF-7 cells with 5 micromol/l BGP-15 and calcipotriene for 20 h generated procaspase-3 cleavage and therefore, apoptosis. Interestingly, BGP-15, and to a lesser extent calcipotriene, but not 1,25(OH)2D3, activated caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells, a cell line that normally lacks this specific caspase (and procaspase). It is presumed that management of MCF-7 with BGP-15 modulates procaspase-3 expression and cleavage, and a subsequent activation of caspase-3. Similar treatments of LNCaP cells induced procaspase-9 cleavage and therefore caspase-9 activation, whereas similar treatments of MCF-7 cells failed to induce caspase-9 activation. Cytochrome c release was, however, detected in both cell lines, LNCaP and MCF-7. In-vivo results suggested that BGP-15 (similar to its parent drug) did not cause calcium-related toxic side effects after chronic treatment.""","""['Liron Berkovich', 'Shimon Ben-Shabat', 'Amnon C Sintov']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['19-nor-26,27-bishomo-vitamin D3 analogs: a unique class of potent inhibitors of proliferation of prostate, breast, and hematopoietic cancer cells.', '20-Cyclopropyl-cholecalciferol vitamin D3 analogs: a unique class of potent inhibitors of proliferation of human prostate, breast and myeloid leukemia cell lines.', 'The iroquois homeobox gene 5 is regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in human prostate cancer and regulates apoptosis and the cell cycle in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', '1alpha(OH)D3 One-alpha-hydroxy-cholecalciferol--an active vitamin D analog.

Objective:   On the basis of the growth inhibitory effects of vitamin K as observed in a variety of cancer cell lines, we hypothesized that dietary intake of phylloquinone (vitamin K(1)) and menaquinones (vitamin K(2)) may be associated with overall cancer incidence and mortality.  Design:   In the prospective EPIC-Heidelberg (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heidelberg) cohort study, 24,340 participants aged 35-64 y and free of cancer at enrollment (1994-1998) were actively followed up for cancer incidence and mortality through 2008. Dietary vitamin K intake was estimated from food-frequency questionnaires completed at baseline by using HPLC-based food-composition data. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated by using Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   During a median follow-up time of >10 y, 1755 incident cancer cases occurred, of which 458 were fatal. Dietary intake of menaquinones was nonsignificantly inversely associated with overall cancer incidence (HR for the highest compared with the lowest quartile: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.01; P for trend = 0.08), and the association was stronger for cancer mortality (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.98; P for trend = 0.03). Cancer risk reduction with increasing intake of menaquinones was more pronounced in men than in women, mainly driven by significant inverse associations with prostate (P for trend = 0.03) and lung (P for trend = 0.002) cancer. We found no association with phylloquinone intake.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that dietary intake of menaquinones, which is highly determined by the consumption of cheese, is associated with a reduced risk of incident and fatal cancer.""","""['Katharina Nimptsch', 'Sabine Rohrmann', 'Rudolf Kaaks', 'Jakob Linseisen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Clin Nutr""","""['Dietary intake of menaquinones and risk of cancer incidence and mortality.', 'Dietary intake of vitamin K and risk of prostate cancer in the Heidelberg cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Heidelberg).', 'Vitamin K intake and all-cause and cause specific mortality.', 'The relationship between vitamin K and peripheral arterial disease.', 'Intake of dietary phylloquinone and menaquinones and risk of stroke.', 'Dietary intake of vitamin K is inversely associated with mortality risk.', 'Role of Antioxidant Vitamins and Other Micronutrients on Regulations of Specific Genes and Signaling Pathways in the Prevention and Treatment of Cancer.', 'Effect on bone anabolic markers of daily cheese intake with and without vitamin K2: a randomised clinical trial.', 'Vitamin K Contribution to DNA Damage-Advantage or Disadvantage?

Studies have shown deficiencies in predicting patient outcome for both of the major PCa diagnostic tools, namely prostate specific antigen (PSA) and transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. Therefore, serum biomarkers are needed that accurately predict prognosis of PCa (indolent vs. aggressive) and can thus inform clinical management.  Aim:   This study uses surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) mass spectrometry analysis to identify differential serum protein expression between PCa patients with indolent vs. aggressive disease categorised by Gleason grade and biochemical recurrence.  Materials and methods:   A total of 99 serum samples were selected for analysis. According to Gleason score, indolent (45 samples) and aggressive (54) forms of PCa were compared using univariate analysis. The same samples were then separated into groups of different recurrence status (10 metastatic, 15 biochemical recurrences and 70 non-recurrences) and subjected to univariate analysis in the same way. The data from Gleason score and recurrence groups were then analysed using multivariate statistical analysis to improve PCa biomarker classification.  Results:   The comparison between serum protein spectra from indolent and aggressive samples resulted in the identification of twenty-six differentially expressed protein peaks (p<0.05), of which twenty proteins were found with 99% confidence. A total of 18 differentially expressed proteins (p<0.05) were found to distinguish between recurrence groups; three of these were robust with p<0.01. Sensitivity and specificity within the Gleason score group was 73.3% and 60% respectively and for the recurrence group 70% and 62.5%.

It promotes tumour progression through multiple pathways including those of signal transducers and activators of transcription factor 3 (STAT3), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Akt. In previous studies, we have reported that STAT3 phosphorylation inversely correlates with suppressor of cytokine signalling-3 (SOCS-3) expression in prostate cancer cells. Recently, it has become evident that SOCS-3-negative regulation is not only limited to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor. We hypothesised that SOCS-3 interferes with FGF signalling, thus influencing the outcome of its action in prostate cancer cells. For this purpose, we treated DU-145 and LNCaP-IL-6+ cells with increasing concentrations of FGF-2, and verified protein phosphorylation. In the presence of FGF-2, neither STAT3, STAT1, nor Akt could be phosphorylated. Solely the p44/p42 MAPK pathway was activated after FGF-2 stimulation. We show for the first time that SOCS-3 interferes with the FGF-2 signalling pathway by modulating p44 and p42 phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells. Decreased SOCS-3 protein expression results in increased MAPK phosphorylation, whereas SOCS-3 overexpression leads to a decreased cellular proliferation and migration. On the basis of the present results, we propose that SOCS-3 is a novel modulator of FGF-2-regulated cellular events in prostate cancer.""","""['Martin Puhr', 'Frédéric R Santer', 'Hannes Neuwirt', 'Gemma Marcias', 'Alfred Hobisch', 'Zoran Culig']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Down-regulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 causes prostate cancer cell death through activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways.', 'Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 directly stimulates mature osteoclast function through activation of FGF receptor 1 and p42/p44 MAP kinase.', 'Nox2/ROS-dependent human antigen R translocation contributes to TNF-α-induced SOCS-3 expression in human tracheal smooth muscle cells.', 'Interleukin-6: a multifunctional targetable cytokine in human prostate cancer.', 'Suppressors of cytokine signalling-3 and -1 in human carcinogenesis.', 'Momordica charantia silver nanoparticles modulate SOCS/JAK/STAT and P13K/Akt/PTEN signalling pathways in the kidney of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.', 'DDIAS promotes STAT3 activation by preventing STAT3 recruitment to PTPRM in lung cancer cells.', 'Negative regulators of STAT3 signaling pathway in cancers.', 'New Insights in Prostate Cancer Development and Tumor Therapy: Modulation of Nuclear Receptors and the Specific Role of Liver X Receptors.', 'Protein Expression Analysis in Uterine Cervical Cancer for Potential Targets in Treatment.']"""

Since APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F), which are potent inhibitors of murine leukemia virus and Vif-deficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), are expressed in human CD4(+) T cells and B cells, we sought to determine how XMRV evades suppression of replication by APOBEC3 proteins. We found that expression of A3G, A3F, or murine A3 in virus-producing cells resulted in their virion incorporation, inhibition of XMRV replication, and G-to-A hypermutation of the viral DNA with all three APOBEC3 proteins. Quantitation of A3G and A3F mRNAs indicated that, compared to the human T-cell lines CEM and H9, prostate cell lines LNCaP and DU145 exhibited 50% lower A3F mRNA levels, whereas A3G expression in 22Rv1, LNCaP, and DU145 cells was nearly undetectable. XMRV proviral genomes in LNCaP and DU145 cells were hypermutated at low frequency with mutation patterns consistent with A3F activity. XMRV proviral genomes were extensively hypermutated upon replication in A3G/A3F-positive T cells (CEM and H9), but not in A3G/A3F-negative cells (CEM-SS). We also observed that XMRV replication was susceptible to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors zidovudine (AZT) and tenofovir and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir. In summary, the establishment of XMRV infection in patients may be dependent on infection of A3G/A3F-deficient cells, and cells expressing low levels of A3G/A3F, such as prostate cancer cells, may be ideal producers of infectious XMRV. Furthermore, the anti-HIV-1 drugs AZT, tenofovir, and raltegravir may be useful for treatment of XMRV infection.""","""['Tobias Paprotka', 'Narasimhan J Venkatachari', 'Chawaree Chaipan', 'Ryan Burdick', 'Krista A Delviks-Frankenberry', 'Wei-Shau Hu', 'Vinay K Pathak']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['Severe restriction of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus replication and spread in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.', 'Raltegravir is a potent inhibitor of XMRV, a virus implicated in prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Downregulation of APOBEC3G by xenotropic murine leukemia-virus related virus (XMRV) in prostate cancer cells.', 'The human retrovirus XMRV in prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Evidence and controversies on the role of XMRV in prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Multifaceted HIV integrase functionalities and therapeutic strategies for their inhibition.', 'Mouse APOBEC3 expression in NIH 3T3 cells mediates hypermutation of AKV murine leukemia virus.', 'Human and murine APOBEC3s restrict replication of koala retrovirus by different mechanisms.', 'The saga of XMRV: a virus that infects human cells but is not a human virus.', 'N-linked glycosylation protects gammaretroviruses against deamination by APOBEC3 proteins.']"""

MitoSOX Red costaining and experiments using isolated mouse liver mitochondria (EC(50)=11.4+/-1.8 microM) confirmed mitochondria as the site of intracellular O(2)(-*) formation. Antimycin A served as positive control (EC(50)=12.4+/-0.9 microM).

Concomitantly, XN treatment caused a rapid breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis induction. Pre- or coincubation with 2 mM NAC and 50 microM MnTMPyP at various steps increased XN-mediated IC(50) values for cytotoxicity in BPH-1 cells from 6.7 +/- 0.2 to 12.2 +/- 0.1 and 41.4 +/- 7.6 microM, and it confirmed XN-induced O(2)(-*) as an essential trigger for apoptosis induction.

NIH/3t3 cells were stably transfected with vectors containing no insert, wild type human DHHC20, or a serine-substituted DHHS20 mutant. Compared with control cells, cells overexpressing wild-type DHHC20 displayed an increase in palmitoylation activity toward a peptide that mimics the N-terminus of myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins, but had no change in activity toward a peptide that mimics the C-terminus of farnesylated and palmitoylated proteins. Cells expressing DHHS20 had no significant change in activity toward either peptide. Overexpression of DHHC20 also caused phenotypic changes consistent with cellular transformation, including colony formation in soft agar, decreased contact inhibition of growth, and increased proliferation under low-serum conditions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses of human tissues demonstrated that DHHC20 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, and is overexpressed in several types of human tumors, including ovarian, breast and prostate.

Enhanced recruitment of activated T cells to irradiated mouse 4T1 breast tumors was mediated largely by CXCL16 and was correlated with tumor inhibition in mice treated with the combination of local radiation and immunotherapy. In this study, the expression of CXCL16 and its modulation by radiation were analyzed in mouse melanoma B16/F10, fibrosarcoma MC57, colon carcinoma MCA38, and prostate carcinoma TRAMP-C1 cells. Only TRAMP-C1 cells showed detectable expression of CXCL16, although the level was lower than in 4T1 and 67NR breast carcinoma cells. Ionizing radiation up-regulated CXCL16 expression in all cells except B16/F10, but only TRAMP-C1, 67NR and 4T1 cells released the soluble chemokine in significant quantities. The metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17, which are responsible for cleaving the chemokine domain from the CXCL16 transmembrane form, were expressed in all cells.

Here we describe a flow method that enables single cell trapping in microwells with dimensions of 50 μm, a size sufficient to allow attachment and division of captured cells. Among various geometries tested, triangular microwells were found to be most efficient for single cell trapping while providing ample space for cells to grow and spread. An important trapping mechanism is the formation of fluid streamlines inside, rather than over, the microwells. A strong flow recirculation occurs in the triangular microwell so that it efficiently catches cells. Once a cell is captured, the cell presence in the microwell changes the flow pattern, thereby preventing trapping of other cells. About 62% of microwells were filled with single cells after a 20 min loading procedure.

It is overexpressed in many human carcinomas and its expression is linked to bad prognosis. Lately, lack or low expression of CD24 was used to identify tumor stem cells resulting in conflicting data on the usefulness of this marker. In many immunohistochemical studies, the mAb SN3b was used but the epitope and specificity of this antibody have never been thoroughly investigated. In other studies based mainly on cytofluorographic analysis, the mAb ML-5 was applied. In this study, we compared the epitope of mAb SN3b to the CD24 mAbs SWA-11 and ML-5 that both bind to the core protein of CD24. Using tissue microarrays and affinity-purified CD24 glycoforms, we observed only a partial overlap of SN3b and SWA11 reactivity. The mAb SN3b recognizes sialic acid most likely on O-linked glycans that can occur independently of the CD24 protein backbone. The SN3b epitope was not related to common sialylated cancer-associated glycan structures. Both SN3b epitope positive or negative CD24 glycoforms supported the binding of P-selectin and Siglec-5. In breast cancer, the SN3b reactivity was associated with bad prognosis, whereas SWA11 was not. In renal cell cancer, the SN3b epitope was completely absent but SWA11 reactivity was a prognostic factor.

Results:   In all, 555,337 prostate carcinoma patients were identified; 124,141 patients were irradiated; 235,341 patients were treated surgically; 32,744 patients had both surgery and radiation; and 163,111 patients received neither modality.

In each treatment cohort, Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that increasing age (by decade) was a significant predictor of developing bladder cancer (p < 0.0001). Incidence of bladder cancer was significantly different for either radiation or surgery alone versus no treatment, radiation versus surgery alone, and both surgery and radiation versus either modality alone (p < 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, age and irradiation were highly significant predictors of being diagnosed with bladder cancer.  Conclusions:   Following prostate cancer, increasing age and irradiation were highly significant predictors of being diagnosed with bladder cancer.

The early PSA test-based variables evaluated were the pretreatment initial PSA (iPSA) value, PSA values at 2 and 4 months into NADT, the PSA nadir (nPSA) value after radiation in all patients, and PSA response signatures in men receiving radiation. Comparisons of endpoints were made using Cox models of local progression-free survival, distant failure-free survival, biochemical failure-free survival, and prostate cancer-specific survival.  Results:   The nPSA value was a powerful predictor of all endpoints regardless of whether NADT was given before radiation. PSA response signatures also predicted all endpoints in men treated by radiation alone. iPSA and PSA results at 2 and 4 months into NADT predicted biochemical failure-free survival but not any of the clinical endpoints. nPSA values correlated with those of iPSA, Gleason grade, and T stage and were significantly higher in men receiving radiation alone than in those receiving NADT.

With 50 questions, the full-length Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is cumbersome to administer outside of studies focusing exclusively on HRQOL. To facilitate HRQOL measurement in a broad range of prostate cancer research and practice settings, we developed and validated an abbreviated version of the EPIC.  Methods:   The 50 questions that constitute the full-length EPIC-50 were evaluated to identify the items suitable for elimination while retaining the ability to measure the 5 prostate cancer-specific HRQOL domains of the EPIC-50. The resulting abbreviated version (EPIC-26) was validated using question responses from 252 subjects who had undergone brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, or prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The EPIC-26 internal consistency was measured by Cronbach's α coefficient and reliability using test-retest correlation.  Results:   Using the high item-scale correlations, clinically relevant content, and preservation of domain psychometrics, 26 items were retained in the EPIC-26 from the 50 questions in the full-length EPIC-50. A high correlation was observed between the EPIC-50 and EPIC-26 versions for the urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual, and vitality/hormonal domain scores (all r ≥ 0.96). The correlations between the different domains were low, confirming that EPIC-26 retained the ability to discern the 5 distinct HRQOL domains. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability for EPIC-26 (Cronbach's α ≥ 0.70 and r ≥ 0.69, respectively for all 5 HRQOL domains) supported its validity.  Conclusions:   EPIC-26 is a brief, valid, and reliable subjective measure of health quality among patients with prostate cancer and is suitable for measuring the HRQOL among patients undergoing treatment of early-stage prostate cancer.""","""['Konrad M Szymanski', 'John T Wei', 'Rodney L Dunn', 'Martin G Sanda']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Development and validation of the expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) for comprehensive assessment of health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life in men with localized prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy: validation of an abbreviated version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice in Spain.', 'Quality of life in patients with prostate cancer: validation of an instrument for clinical practice.', 'A systematic review of expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) quality of life after surgery or radiation treatment.', 'Health-related quality of life among long-term (≥5\xa0years) prostate cancer survivors by primary intervention: a systematic review.', 'Urinary continence recovery after Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in relation to surgeon experience.', 'The association of smoking with urinary and sexual function recovery following radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Sociocultural factors associated with physical activity in Black prostate cancer survivors.', 'Proton therapy planning and image-guidance strategies within a randomized controlled trial for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'The Longitudinal Course of Prospectively Recorded Patient-reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Surgery and Salvage Radiotherapy.']"""

Methods:   The institutional RP database was queried. A total of 9381 patients with complete follow-up underwent RP from 1982 to 2008. Of these 9381 patients, 1061 had pathologic Gleason sum 8-10 cancer. The patient and prostate cancer characteristics were evaluated. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazard regression models were created to evaluate the pertinent predictors of CSS (death from, or attributed to, prostate cancer).  Results:   The median preoperative prostate-specific antigen level was 7.6 ng/mL; 435 men had clinical Stage T1 tumor, 568 had Stage T2, and 36 had Stage T3. The biopsy Gleason sum was <7, 7, and >7 in 244 (22.3%), 406 (37.2%), and 425 (38.9%) patients, respectively. The median follow-up was 5 years (range 1-23). The actuarial 15-year recurrence-free survival, CSS, and overall survival rate was 20.7%, 57.4%, and 45.4%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the predictors of poor CSS were pathologic Gleason sum 9-10 and seminal vesicle and lymph node involvement. Patients with pathologic Gleason sum 8 and organ-confined disease had a CSS rate of 89.9% at 15 years.  Conclusions:   The results of our study have shown that 80% of the men with Gleason sum 8-10 who undergo RP will have experienced biochemical recurrence by 15 years. However, the CSS rate approached 90% for men with pathologic organ-confined disease.

Methods:   The IGFBP3 levels were measured and the -202 A/C SNP of the IGFBP3 gene was typed for 225 PCa cases and the same number of matched controls. Linear regression analysis and unconditional logistic regression analysis were used to test for the associations between the genotypes and the circulating IGFBP3 levels and the risk of PCa, respectively. To adjust for the potential bias introduced by the hospital cohort, the result of the genotyping was compared with that of 683 community-indwelling healthy men.  Results:   Significantly lower plasma levels of IGFBP3 were noted in the PCa cases. Lower IGFBP3 plasma levels were associated with an increased number of C alleles (P<.001). Compared with the PCa cases, a lower frequency of the C allele was found in the hospital and community controls (P<.05). Compared with AA genotype, logistic regression analysis revealed an increased risk of PCa in subjects who were CC genotype (odds ratio: 2.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-5.48). Larger odds (odds ratio: 3.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.35-8.43) for PCa were associated with CC genotype when the analysis was confined to those who had high-risk PCa.

High resolution images of treated cells show that morphologically different types of blebs can occur after wounding conditions caused by ultrasound exposure as well as by mechanical shear and strong laser ablation. In addition, these treatments caused wound-induced nonlytic necrotic death resulting in cell bodies we call wound-derived perikarya (WD-P). However, only cells exposed to acoustic cavitation experienced ejection of intact nuclei and nearly instant lytic necrosis.

Lack of contrast among prostatic tissues and high false positive or negative detection rates of prostate lesions have limited the use of current imaging modalities in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. In this study, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is introduced to visualize the anatomical and abnormal structures in freshly excised human prostates. A modified Siemens Antares ultrasound scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc., Malvern, PA) and a Siemens VF10-5 linear array were used to acquire ARFI images. The transducer was attached to a three-dimensional (3-D) translation stage, which was programmed to automate volumetric data acquisition. A depth dependent gain (DDG) method was developed and applied to 3-D ARFI datasets to compensate for the displacement gradients associated with spatially varying radiation force magnitudes as a function of depth. Nine human prostate specimens were collected and imaged immediately after surgical excision. Prostate anatomical structures such as seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, peripheral zone, central zone, transition zone and verumontanum were visualized with high spatial resolution and in good agreement with McNeal's zonal anatomy. The characteristic appearance of prostate pathologies, such as prostate cancerous lesions, benign prostatic hyperplasia, calcified tissues and atrophy were identified in ARFI images based upon correlation with the corresponding histologic slides. This study demonstrates that ARFI imaging can be used to visualize internal structures and detecting suspicious lesions in the prostate and appears promising for image guidance of prostate biopsy.""","""['Liang Zhai', 'John Madden', 'Wen-Chi Foo', 'Mark L Palmeri', 'Vladimir Mouraviev', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Kathryn R Nightingale']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ultrasound Med Biol""","""['Characterizing stiffness of human prostates using acoustic radiation force.', 'Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging of human prostates: initial in vivo demonstration.', 'Identifying Clinically Significant Prostate Cancers using 3-D In\xa0Vivo Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging with Whole-Mount Histology Validation.', 'Ultrasound elastography of the prostate: state of the art.', 'Ultrasound elastography: principles and techniques.', 'Application of Multiple Ultrasonic Techniques in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Electrical Impedance Tomography for Robot-Aided Internal Radiation Therapy.', 'Wave Propagation in a Fractional Viscoelastic Tissue Model: Application to Transluminal Procedures.', 'Why Are Viscosity and Nonlinearity Bound to Make an Impact in Clinical Elastographic Diagnosis?', 'Relationship between Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Prostatic Urethral Stiffness Using Strain Elastography: Initial Experiences.']"""

Our objective was to evaluate sick leave in spouses of cancer patients before and after the diagnosis.  Material and methods:   Using Swedish population-based registries, we studied sick leave of spouses to patients with newly diagnosed colon, rectal, lung, prostate, or breast cancer. We identified the cancer patients via the Swedish Cancer Registry and obtained information of their spouse through linkage with the population register. We assessed the number of sick leave episodes and sick days one year before until one year after the spouses' cancer diagnosis by cross-referencing with Swedish Social Insurance Agency data. We also compared the number of sick days of spouses with the general population adjusted for age, sex and partner status.  Results:   In general, spouses (N=1 923) to cancer patients had an increase in the frequency of new episodes of sick leave in the months before and after the cancer diagnosis. Spouses of lung cancer patients had most sick leave episodes, and the largest number of sick days per person. In comparison to the general population, spouses in the lung cancer group also had the highest standardised sick day ratio 1.76; 95% confidence interval 1.24, 2.40. The corresponding risk for spouses in other groups of cancer was not significantly increased.  Discussion:   In Sweden there is often increased sick leave of spouses to cancer patients. It may be due to emotional stress and physical reactions that follow with cancer which needs to be further explored in order to provide adequate support and care.""","""['Katarina Sjövall', 'Bo Attner', 'Thor Lithman', 'Dennis Noreen', 'Barbro Gunnars', 'Bibbi Thomé', 'Lars Lidgren', 'Håkan Olsson', 'Martin Englund']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Influence on the health of the partner affected by tumor disease in the wife or husband based on a population-based register study of cancer in Sweden.', 'Does hospital discharge policy influence sick-leave patterns in the case of female breast cancer?', 'Sick leave in patients with ankylosing spondylitis before and after anti-TNF therapy: a population-based cohort study.', 'Risk of sick leave and disability pension in working-age women and men with knee osteoarthritis.', 'Comparisons of self-reported and register data on sickness absence among public employees in Sweden.', 'Effectiveness of an interdisciplinary palliative care intervention for family caregivers in lung cancer.', 'Economic studies in colorectal cancer: challenges in measuring and comparing costs.', 'Quality of life of family caregivers and challenges faced in caring for patients with lung cancer.', 'Sickness absence among cancer patients in the pre-diagnostic and the post-diagnostic phases of five common forms of cancer.']"""

Methods:   A total of 463 patients with histologically proven prostate cancer underwent SLN-guided lymph node dissection. The day before surgery patients received intraprostatic injection of Tc-99 m-labeled nanocolloid (Tc-NC) under transrectal ultrasound guidance. At the time of surgery, the lymph nodes of the obturator fossa were dissected routinely in all patients. After meticulous testing with a handheld gamma probe, all lymphatic tissues in predefined anatomic regions (external iliac, internal iliac, common iliacal and presacral) with Tc-NC uptake were additionally resected.  Results:   In 146 (12.8%) patients, SLN were located exclusively in the obturator fossa, but 317 patients (87.2%) underwent resection of additional sentinel regions. In 28 (6.1%) patients, 62 lymph node metastases were detected, and 32 (51.6%) of these were located outside the obturator fossa. Eight (28.6%) patients displayed lymph node metastases exclusively outside the obturator fossa and had been resected only because of positive SLN probing.  Conclusions:   The obturator fossa comprises the major landing site of lymph node metastases, but more than half of the metastases are located outside this anatomic region.

After a 2-cm midline subumbilical incision, the preperitoneal space was created using a balloon trocar. Then, the Triport™ was introduced. Using straight, as well as pre-curved instruments, the radical prostatectomy was performed in accordance with the well-described technique of endoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy.  Results:   The procedure was completed successfully. Overall operation time was 290 min. The estimated blood loss was 100 mL. There were no intra-or postoperative complications. No additional ports were required. On the 6th postoperative day, a cystogram was performed. No leak was demonstrated, enabling catheter removal.

The analysis of 135 cases of prostatic adenocarcinomas grouped into tumors with low (Gleason score < or = 6), intermediate (Gleason score 7), and high Gleason score (8 < or = Gleason score < or = 10) showed that the expression of PKP1 was reduced or lost in adenocarcinomas with high Gleason scores. The expression of PKP2 was unchanged in all prostatic adenocarcinomas analyzed. In contrast, PKP3 expression was increased in carcinomas with high Gleason scores in comparison with carcinomas with low Gleason scores. In DU 145 cell lines with either overexpression or knockdown of PKP3, both imbalances resulted in fewer desmosomal cell contacts. In addition, overexpression of PKP3 in DU 145 cells led to an augmentation in proliferation rate. Our data imply that both loss of PKP1 and up-regulation of PKP3 expression are biologically important events in prostate cancer and are associated with a more aggressive phenotype.""","""['Sonja Breuninger', 'Sonja Reidenbach', 'Christian Georg Sauer', 'Philipp Ströbel', 'Jesco Pfitzenmaier', 'Lutz Trojan', 'Ilse Hofmann']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Plakophilin-associated RNA-binding proteins in prostate cancer and their implications in tumor progression and metastasis.', 'Expression of plakophilins (PKP1, PKP2, and PKP3) in gastric cancers.', 'c-Src mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of plakophilin 3 as a new mechanism to control desmosome composition in cells exposed to oxidative stress.', 'Plakophilins in desmosomal adhesion and signaling.', 'Plakophilins--hard work in the desmosome, recreation in the nucleus?', 'Identification of Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Based on the Stromal-Immune Score and Analysis of the WGCNA and ceRNA Network.', 'Desmosomes as Signaling Hubs in the Regulation of Cell Behavior.', 'Disease-related blood-based differential methylation in cystic fibrosis and its representation in lung cancer revealed a regulatory locus in PKP3 in lung epithelial cells.', 'Immune molecular profiling of a multiresistant primary prostate cancer with a neuroendocrine-like phenotype: a case report.', 'Increased expression of plakophilin 3 is associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 783 patients with GIST were identified from 1995 to 2007. Additional primaries included tumors not considered metastasis, invasion, or recurrence of GIST, nor non-melanoma skin cancer. Data on gender, age at diagnosis, follow-up time after diagnosis, and death were collected.  Results:   Of the 783 patients with GIST, 153(20%) were identified with at least one additional primary. Patients with additional primaries were more often men (M : F 1.5 versus 1.3) and older (66 versus 53 years). More patients had another cancer diagnosed before (134) than after (52) GIST. Primaries observed before GIST were cancers of the prostate (25), breast (12), esophagus (9), and kidney (7) and melanoma (6). Lung (5) and kidney (5) primaries were the most frequent after GIST. The 5-year survival was 68% for patients with primaries before GIST, 61% for patients with primaries after GIST, 58% for patients with GIST only, and 49% for patients with two or more primaries in addition to GIST (P = 0.002).  Conclusions:   Approximately 20% of patients with GIST develop other cancers. Inferior median 5-year survival was observed in patients with GIST with two or more other cancers.

Most epidemiological data however shows a weak link between serum 25(OH)D3 and risk of prostate cancer. To explore this dichotomy we have compared tumor progression in the LPB-Tag model of prostate in VDR knock out (VDRKO) and wild type (VDRWT) mice. On the C57BL/6 background LPB-Tag tumors progress significantly more rapidly in the VDRKO mice. VDRKO tumors show significantly higher levels of cell proliferation than VDRWT tumors. In mice supplemented with testosterone to restore the serum levels to the normal range, these differences in tumor progression, and proliferation are abrogated, suggesting that there is considerable cross-talk between the androgen receptor (AR) and the vitamin D axis which is reflected in significant changes in steady state mRNA levels of the AR, PCNA, cdk2 survivin and IGFR1 and 2 genes.

Although these candidates are promising in cancer therapy, a number of tumor cells are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. We describe the use of a cationic amphipathic lytic peptide, KLA (single letter sequence HHHHHKLAKLAKKLAKLAKC), for the chemosensitization of TRAIL-resistant LNCaP and PC3-PSMA human prostate cancer cells to DR agonistic antibodies. 'Single-agent' treatment with DR agonistic antibodies did not result in loss of viability of these cells confirming the resistance of these cells. However, the combination treatment of KLA followed by DR agonists resulted in greater cell death compared to the individual treatments acting alone, indicating synergistic action between the two components of the combination treatment. The combination of lytic peptide and DR agonists resulted in a significant increase in activated caspase-3 cleavage and cytochrome-C protein levels in cells, indicating a role for the caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway. In addition, KLA treatment also resulted in increased localization of DR5 and lipid rafts in LNCaP cells.

We investigated the patterns of care in the community in this patient population before and after the reporting of the ABS guideline.  Methods and materials:   The study cohort consisted of 4943 men (median age, 69.0 years) with low-risk prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy with or without supplemental EBRT from 1991 to 2007 across 21 community radiation oncology centers.

Results:   Supplemental EBRT was used in 647 men (13%). The EBRT use initially increased until 2001 and then decreased yielding a significant association (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.92; p<0.001) between the EBRT use and the year of brachytherapy using a quadratic formulation. Specifically, EBRT use peaked at 24.6% in 2001 and subsequently declined to 3.3% by 2007. Men with clinical category T2a as compared with T1c disease (AOR, 1.43; p<0.001) were more likely to receive combined modality therapy.

In an attempt to develop an efficient peptide-based radiopharmaceutical for targeting bombesin (BN) receptor-expressing tumors (i.e., breast and prostate), we have prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis, a novel BN analog derived from the universal sequence of BN and conjugated to a widely characterized antineoplastic agent, methotrexate (MTX). MTX-BN, after radiolabeling with (99m)Tc via stannous-tartrate exchange, showed a good stability against cysteine and histidine transchelation as well as a high in vitro metabolic stability in human plasma. In vitro cell-binding and internalization on MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, T47-D breast cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated high affinity and specificity of (99m)Tc-MTX-BN towards both human breast and prostate cancer cells (binding affinities in nanomolar range). In addition, the radioconjugate displayed a significant internalization (values ranged between 19-35%) into the tumor cells. In vivo biodistribution and clearance kinetics in Balb/c mice are characterized by an efficient clearance from the blood and excretion mainly through the renal-urinary pathway with some elimination via the hepatobiliary system. In vivo tumor uptake in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 cells was 2.70+/-0.44% ID/g at 1 h, whereas in nude mice with human epidermoid KB cells the accumulation in the tumor was found to be 1.48+/-0.31% ID/g at 1 h post injection. The tumor uptake was always higher than in the blood and muscle, with good tumor retention and good tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios. The accumulation/retention in the major organs (i.e., lungs, stomach, liver, intestines, etc.) was low to moderate (<6% ID/g) in both healthy and tumor-bearing mice. However, the uptake/retention in the kidneys was rather high (up to 11.05+/-1.80% ID/g), which is of a concern, particularly for radionuclide therapy. This initial study towards the development of a novel cytotoxic BN conjugate suggest that the combination of favorable in vitro and in vivo properties may render (99m)Tc-MTX-BN a potential candidate for the targeted imaging and eventually for radionuclide therapy (when labeled with an appropriate radionuclide) of BN receptor-positive tumors and deserves further evaluation.""","""['Subhani M Okarvi', 'Ibrahim Al Jammaz']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Preparation and evaluation of bombesin peptide derivatives as potential tumor imaging agents: effects of structure and composition of amino acid sequence on in vitro and in vivo characteristics.', 'Synthesis, radiolabelling and biological characteristics of a bombesin peptide analog as a tumor imaging agent.', 'Design, preparation, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of (99m)Tc-N2S2-Tat(49-57)-bombesin: a target-specific hybrid radiopharmaceutical.', '99mTc-labeled N40,Pro1,Tyr4bombesin.', 'Gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) receptor targeted radiopharmaceuticals: a concise update.', 'Bombesin Peptide Conjugated Water-Soluble Chitosan Gallate-A New Nanopharmaceutical Architecture for the Rapid One-Pot Synthesis of Prostate Tumor Targeted Gold Nanoparticles.', 'Perspectives of Methotrexate-Based Radioagents for Application in Nuclear Medicine.', 'A convenient and efficient total solid-phase synthesis of DOTA-functionalized tumor-targeting peptides for PET imaging of cancer.', 'Development of the Tumor-Specific Antigen-Derived Synthetic Peptides as Potential Candidates for Targeting Breast and Other Possible Human Carcinomas.', 'Development of a peptide-based bifunctional chelator conjugated to a cytotoxic drug for the treatment of melanotic melanoma.']"""

Nevertheless, we observed that rat red blood cell swelling in moderately hypotonic media was accompanied by up to 20% decrease of light dispersion, when hemolysis was not yet detectable. Avicin G and avicin D were significantly more efficient than saponin in inducing cytotoxicity in PC3 human prostate cancer cells. We found that the preincubation of avicins with the plasma membrane, but not with the cytosolic fraction of previously lysed red blood cells, completely protected fresh cells against permeabilization. The data suggest that the plasma membrane can tightly bind the avicins, but not the saponin.

Patients and methods:   between December 2007 and December 2008, we retrospectively analysed 69 consecutive patients who had biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer. The inclusion criteria for the study were a history of MRI investigation (combined T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI) and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The exclusion criteria included an MRI investigation-to-surgery interval of ≥ 1 week, a biopsy having been taken in another hospital, or other than 12 biopsy cores. The amount of haemorrhaging, number of haemorrhaging sites, and the location of the cancer were determined. For this, the prostate was divided into 12 segments which anatomically corresponded to the sites where the 12 core biopsies were taken. Each haemorrhagic prostate segment was scored according to its diameter. Pathology results were reviewed in the same manner. Finally, we assessed any discordance between the sets of results according to the period between the biopsy and the MRI. The association between the MRI and pathology results, in relation to the period between the biopsy and MRI, was plotted and tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient.  Results:   five of the 69 patients were excluded because they had a biopsy at another hospital, 12 were excluded because the period between the MRI and the surgery was >7 days. Suspected prostate haemorrhage was detected in 49 of 52 (94%) patients who had MRI. There was a significantly negative correlation with the period between biopsy and MRI (coefficient - 0.285, P= 0.041). There were no significant differences in cancer localization between MRI and pathology results according to the period between the biopsy and MRI (coefficient 0.028, P= 0.874). The rate of matching between MRI results and pathology results was 74%.  Conclusions:   we found no significant differences in cancer localization between MRI and final pathology according to the period between the biopsy and MRI. Because of this finding, we do not recommend deferring MRI for the purpose of more accurate cancer staging.""","""['Kyung Kgi Park', 'Seung Hwan Lee', 'Beom Jin Lim', 'Joo Hee Kim', 'Byung Ha Chung']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in patients with unilateral prostate cancer on extended prostate biopsy: predictive accuracy of laterality and implications for hemi-ablative therapy.', 'Phased array magnetic resonance imaging for staging clinically localised prostrate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer detection by prebiopsy 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Radical prostatectomy: value of prostate MRI in surgical planning.', 'Advances in magnetic resonance imaging: how they are changing the management of prostate cancer.', 'The Influence of Background Signal Intensity Changes on Cancer Detection in Prostate MRI.', 'Clinical significance of multiparametric MRI and PSA density as predictors of residual tumor (pT0) following radical prostatectomy for T1a-T1b (incidental) prostate cancer.', 'Clinical significance and predictors of oncologic outcome after radical prostatectomy for invisible prostate cancer on multiparametric MRI.', 'Can robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) be performed very soon after biopsy?', 'Nonvisible tumors on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging does not predict low-risk prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   The data from 300 consecutive men with localized prostate cancer who underwent EERP at Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK, between February 2006 and July 2009 were prospectively maintained in a database. The data collected included demographic details, perioperative outcomes, complications and follow-up for functional and oncology outcomes. The learning curve was analysed using generalized linear models for complication rate, operative time and blood loss, using procedure experience.  Results:   The mean (sd, range) operative duration was 160.52 (40.84, 100-310) min, and the intraoperative blood loss was 229.3 (172, 20-1000) mL. There was no conversion to open surgery and no patient required intraoperative blood transfusion. Only one of 250 (0.3%) patients required a blood transfusion after EERP. The median (range) hospital stay was 3 (2-20) days and the median catheterization time before cystography was 9 days. There was evidence that the complication rate reduced as experience was gained (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.97-0.99; P= 0.002), with the estimated probability of a complication decreasing from 29% for the first to <1% for the 250th procedure. Also there was evidence of a decrease in operative duration (-0.0020 rate parameter on log scale; 95% CI -0.0024 to -0.0017; P < 0.001) and blood loss (-0.01 rate parameter on log scale; 95% CI -0.003 to -0.0002; P= 0.021). The positive surgical margin rate in pT2 disease decreased from 27% in the first 50 to 14.7% in the last 50 operated cases. The continence rate and biochemical recurrence-free rate at a minimum follow-up of 1 year for the first 100 patients was 89% and 94%, respectively.

Clinical and pathological data were collected, including age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index (BMI), tumour stage, complications and length of stay. Direct and component costs (anaesthesia, laboratory, operating room service, radiology, room and board, pharmacy and surgical supplies) were obtained. Differences in costs were evaluated using three BMI categories (<25, normal weight; 25-<30, overweight; and ≥30 kg/m(2) , obese).  Results:   of 629 patients, 136 (21.6%) had normal weight, 320 (50.9%) were overweight, and 173 (27.5%) were obese. Clinical and pathological characteristics were similar in the three BMI categories of the entire cohort. The median direct cost was higher for obese patients (P= 0.035). On further stratification by type of RP, costs were higher amongst obese than the other groups undergoing LRP (median US$5703 vs $5347; P= 0.002) and RRP (median $4885 vs $4377; P= 0.004). In patients who underwent RALP there were no significant differences in direct costs (median $6761 in obese vs $6745 in non-obese; P= 0.64).

The core of the system consists of 2 mum diameter cross-linked monodispersed microspheres bearing a panel of fluorescent tags and peptides or small molecules either directly synthesized or covalently conjugated to the microspheres. The microsphere mixtures were screened for affinity to cell line PC-3 (prostate cancer model) by incubation with live cells, and as was with phage-display peptide methods, unbound microspheres were removed by repeated washings followed by total lysis of cells and analysis of the bound microspheres by flow-cytometry. Similar to phage-display peptide screening, this method can be applied even in the absence of prior information about the cellular targets of the candidate ligands, which makes the system especially interesting for selection of molecules with high affinity for desired cells, tissues, or tumors. The advantage of the proposed system is the possibility of screening synthetic non-natural peptides or small molecules that cannot be expressed and screened using phage display libraries. A library composed of small molecules synthesized by the Ugi reaction was screened, and a small molecule, Rak-2, which strongly binds to PC-3 cells was found. Rak-2 was then individually synthesized and validated in a complementary whole cell-based binding assay, as well as by live cell microscopy. This new system demonstrates that a mixture of molecules bound to subcellular sized microspheres can be screened on plated cells. Together with other methods using subcellular sized particles for cellular multiplexing, this method represents an important milestone toward high throughput screening of mixtures of small molecules in live cells and in vivo with potential applications in the fields of drug delivery and diagnostic imaging.""","""['Gerardo Byk', 'Shirly Partouche', 'Aryeh Weiss', 'Shlomo Margel', 'Raz Khandadash']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Comb Chem""","""['High-throughput cell-based screening of 4910 known drugs and drug-like small molecules identifies disulfiram as an inhibitor of prostate cancer cell growth.', 'From combinatorial chemistry to cancer-targeting peptides.', 'TMTP1, a novel tumor-homing peptide specifically targeting metastasis.', 'targeted drug delivery to hepatocarcinoma in vivo by phage-displayed specific binding peptide.', 'Phage peptide display.', 'Comparison of two peptide radiotracers for prostate carcinoma targeting.']"""
