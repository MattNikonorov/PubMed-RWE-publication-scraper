The objective of this study was to verify the localization of angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) and its receptor Mas in human testis. The study included 12 men with previously proven fertility submitted to orchiectomy for prostate cancer and 20 infertile men submitted to testicular biopsy for infertility work-up, comprising a subgroup with obstructive azoospermia/normal spermatogenesis (n = 8) and another with non-obstructive azoospermia and severely impaired spermatogenesis (n = 12). Testicular tissue samples were processed by immunohistochemistry and real time polymerase chain reaction. Ang-(1-7) was strongly expressed in the interstitial compartment, mainly in Leydig cells, with similar intensity in all groups evaluated. The peptide was also detected in the seminiferous tubules, but with much less intensity compared to interstitial cells. The receptor Mas was equally distributed between interstitial and tubular compartments and was found in all layers of the normal seminiferous epithelium. However, neither Ang-(1-7) nor Mas were detected in the seminiferous tubules of samples with impaired spermatogenesis. The testicular samples of infertile men with impaired spermatogenesis (non-obstructive azoospermia) expressed Mas and ACE2 mRNA at lower concentrations (fold change = 0.06 and 0.04, respectively, P < 0.05) than samples with full spermatogenesis (obstructive azoospermia). This shows, for the first time, the immunolocalization of Ang-(1-7) and its receptor Mas in testes of fertile and infertile men, and suggests that this system may be altered when spermatogenesis is severely impaired.""","""['Augusto B Reis', 'Fabiano C Araújo', 'Virginia M Pereira', 'Adelina M Dos Reis', 'Robson A Santos', 'Fernando M Reis']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Mol Histol""","""['Gonadotropin stimulation increases the expression of angiotensin-(1--7) and MAS receptor in the rat ovary.', 'Angiotensin-(1-7), its receptor Mas, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 are expressed in the human ovary.', 'Upregulation of ACE2-ANG-(1-7)-Mas axis in jejunal enterocytes of type 1 diabetic rats: implications for glucose transport.', 'ACE2, angiotensin-(1–7), and Mas: the other side of the coin.', 'Devil and angel in the renin-angiotensin system: ACE-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis vs. ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis.', 'In silico transcriptional analysis of asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 patients reveals the susceptibility of severe patients to other comorbidities and non-viral pathological conditions.', 'Exploration of multifaceted molecular mechanism of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in pathogenesis of various diseases.', 'Long COVID and risk of erectile dysfunction in recovered patients from mild to moderate COVID-19.', 'Insights into the Scenario of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Male Reproductive Toxicity.', 'Rescuing fertility during COVID-19 infection: exploring potential pharmacological and natural therapeutic approaches for comorbidity, by focusing on NLRP3 inflammasome mechanism.']"""

After the inoculation, nude mice were injected with PL every two days for 12 days. Although PL treatment did not prevent the formation of the inoculated tumors, the growth rate of the tumors after PL treatment was dramatically attenuated. We then tested the effect of PL on the tumors 12 days after the inoculation. After inoculated tumors reached a certain size, PL was administrated to the mice by subcutaneous injection. The histochemistry or immunochemistry analysis showed that apoptosis occurred with the activation of caspase 3 in the tumors formed by inoculating prostate cancer DU145 or PC3 cells.

Methodology/principal findings:   In vivo microCT was performed before and 10 weeks after implantation of human prostate cancer cells (MDA-PCa-2b) or vehicle into SCID mouse femora. After resection, femora were imaged by nondestructive ex vivo specimen microCT at three voxel sizes (31 micro, 16 micro, 8 micro) and DXA, and then sectioned for histomorphometric analysis of mineralized bone. Bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular parameters (number, TbN; separation, TbSp; thickness, TbTh) and mineralized bone volume/total bone volume (BV/TV) were compared and correlated among imaging methods and histomorphometry. Statistical tests were considered significant if P<0.05. Ten weeks post inoculation, diaphyseal BMD increased in the femur with tumor compared to the opposite femur by all modalities (p<0.005, n = 11). Diaphyseal BMD by in vivo microCT correlated with ex vivo 31 and 16 microm microCT and histomorphometry BV/TV (r = 0.91-0.94, P<0.001, n = 11). DXA BMD correlated less with bone histomorphometry (r = 0.73, P<0.001, n = 11) and DXA did not distinguish trabeculae from cortex. By in vivo and ex vivo microCT, trabecular BMD decreased (P<0.05, n = 11) as opposed to the cortex. Unlike BMD, trabecular morphologic parameters were threshold-dependent and when using ""fixed-optimal-thresholds,"" all except TbTh demonstrated trabecular loss with tumor and correlated with histomorphometry (r = 0.73-0.90, P<0.05, n = 11).

However, the precise role played by dysregulated expression of lipid metabolic enzymes and altered lipid homeostasis in carcinogenesis remains to be established. Fatty acid synthase is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including breast and prostate. The purpose of the present study was to examine the expression patterns of additional lipid metabolic enzymes in human breast and prostate cancers. This was accomplished by analysis of published expression databases, with confirmation by immunoblot assays. Our results indicate that the fatty acid-activating enzyme, long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4), is differentially expressed in human breast cancer as a function of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) status. In 10 separate studies, ACSL4 messenger RNA (mRNA) was overexpressed in ER-negative breast tumors. Of 50 breast cancer cell lines examined, 17 (89%) of 19 ER-positive lines were negative for ACSL4 mRNA expression and 20 (65%) of 31 ER-negative lines expressed ACSL4 mRNA. The inverse relationship between ER expression and ACSL4 expression was also observed for androgen receptor status in both breast and prostate cancers. Furthermore, loss of steroid hormone sensitivity, such as that observed in Raf1-transfected MCF-7 cells and LNCaP-AI cells, was associated with induction of ACSL4 expression. Ablation of ACSL4 expression inMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells had no effect on cell proliferation; however, sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of triacsin C was increased three-fold in the cells lacking ACSL4.""","""['Marie E Monaco', 'Chad J Creighton', 'Peng Lee', 'Xuanyi Zou', 'Matthew K Topham', 'Diana M Stafforini']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Transl Oncol""","""['ACSL4: biomarker, mediator and target in quadruple negative breast cancer.', 'ACSL4 as a Potential Target and Biomarker for Anticancer: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Therapeutics.', 'Long chain fatty Acyl-CoA synthetase 4 is a biomarker for and mediator of hormone resistance in human breast cancer.', 'Association of long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase\xa05 expression in human breast cancer by estrogen receptor status and its clinical significance.', 'Acyl-CoA synthetase-4 is implicated in drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines involving the regulation of energy-dependent transporter expression.', 'ACSL4: biomarker, mediator and target in quadruple negative breast cancer.', 'ACSL4 as a Potential Target and Biomarker for Anticancer: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Therapeutics.', 'Expression of ferroptosis-related gene correlates with immune microenvironment and predicts prognosis in gastric cancer.', 'Reprogramming of Fatty Acid Metabolism in Gynaecological Cancers: Is There a Role for Oestradiol?', 'Translational Implications of Dysregulated Pathways and microRNA Regulation in Quadruple-Negative Breast Cancer.']"""

Gene amplification and overexpression of ACK1 were found in many cancer types such as those of the lung and prostate. Previously, we identified both somatic- and germ line missense mutations in the ACK1 coding sequence, by surveying 261 cancer cell lines and 15 control tissues. Here, we verified and characterized the non-synonymous mutation, ACK-S985 N, located in the ubiquitin association domain of the protein. Both overexpression and silencing experiments in MCF7 and A498 cells, respectively, demonstrated a role of the ACK1 S985 N mutation in enhancing cell proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Further, we showed that the ACK1 S985 N mutant is unable to bind ubiquitin, unlike the wild type kinase. This contributed to ACK1 protein stability and stabilized EGFR after EGF stimulation, thereby prolonging mitogenic signaling in cancer cells. In addition, the ACK1 S985 N-EGFR interaction is enhanced, but not the ubiquitination of the receptor. Intriguingly, silencing of ACK1 in A498 cells sensitized the renal carcinoma cells to gefitinib, against which they are otherwise resistant. The work demonstrates that other than gene amplification, a single somatic mutation in ACK1 can result in extended protein stability enabling the oncoprotein to exert its oncogenic function in tumor progression. It also provides a rationale to target ACK1 in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, such as EGFR inhibitors, to potentiate therapeutic action against resistant tumors.""","""['Boon Tin Chua', 'Shu Jing Lim', 'Su Chin Tham', 'Wei Jie Poh', 'Axel Ullrich']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Domain Architecture of the Nonreceptor Tyrosine Kinase Ack1.', 'Activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 is a component of EGF receptor signaling complex and regulates EGF receptor degradation.', 'Cytoplasmic ACK1 interaction with multiple receptor tyrosine kinases is mediated by Grb2: an analysis of ACK1 effects on Axl signaling.', 'The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Ack1 regulates the fate of activated EGFR by inducing trafficking to the p62/NBR1 pre-autophagosome.', 'Small Molecules Targeting Activated Cdc42-Associated Kinase 1 (ACK1/TNK2) for the Treatment of Cancers.', 'ACKnowledging the role of the Activated-Cdc42 associated kinase (ACK) in regulating protein stability in cancer.', 'Domain Architecture of the Nonreceptor Tyrosine Kinase Ack1.', 'Improvement of ACK1-targeted therapy efficacy in lung adenocarcinoma using chloroquine or bafilomycin A1.', 'Activity of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Ack1 is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of its Mig6 homology region.', 'Proximity-Dependent Biotinylation to Elucidate the Interactome of TNK2 Nonreceptor Tyrosine Kinase.']"""

To determine the mechanism of curcumin-induced cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells, we exposed PC3 prostate carcinoma cells to 25 to 100 microM curcumin for 24 to 72 h. Curcumin treatment of PC3 cells caused time- and dose-dependent induction of apoptosis and depletion of cellular reduced glutathione (GSH). Exogenous GSH and its precursor N-acetyl-cysteine, but not ascorbic acid (AA) or ebselen, decreased curcumin accumulation in PC3 cells and also prevented curcumin-induced DNA fragmentation. The failure of AA and ebselen to protect PC3 cells from curcumin-induced apoptosis argued against the involvement of reactive oxygen species; rather, GSH-mediated inhibition of curcumin-induced cytotoxicity was due to reduced curcumin accumulation in PC3 cells. Curcumin-treated PC3 cells showed apoptosis-inducing cellular ceramide accumulation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were activated, and cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were released from mitochondria following curcumin treatment. Interestingly, curcumin-induced apoptosis was not prevented by p38 MAPK, JNK, or caspase inhibition.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of intraoperative frozen sections (IFS) during nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (NSRP).  Materials and methods:   Thousand and eighty-three patients with localised prostatic carcinoma were treated using retropubic RP (from 2004 to 2006). Two hundred and eighty-seven of the 1083 documented cases received NS. One hundred and thirty procedures were carried out with IFS from the area of the neurovascular bundles and 157 without IFS. The decision to use IFS was made intraoperatively and based on clinical suspicion of possible positive resection margins in the area of the bundles.  Results:   In the NS group with IFS, the results revealed positive margins in nine (6.9%) out of 130 cases, resulting in subsequent resection of the ipsilateral neurovascular bundle. The final histological report on this group revealed four additional patients (3.1%) with positive margins, but only one (0.7%) in the area of the previous neurovascular bundle. The final histopathologic reports on the 157 NS cases without IFS showed that the positive margin was in the area of the previous neurovascular bundle in only one (0.6%) of the nine cases with positive margins (5.7%).  Conclusion:   According to our data, there is no need for routine IFS during NSRP. The negative predictive value for infiltration of the NVB is high, and IFS can be dispensed with.

Objective:   This study examined how evening and morning fatigue changed from the time of simulation to 4 months after the completion of RT and investigated whether specific demographic and disease characteristics and baseline severity of symptoms predicted the initial levels of fatigue and characteristics of the trajectories of fatigue.  Methods:   Seventy-three women with breast cancer completed questionnaires that assessed sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and pain prior to the initiation of RT and the Lee Fatigue Scale, over 6 months. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical linear modeling were used for data analysis.  Results:   Large amounts of interindividual variability were found in the trajectories of fatigue. Evening fatigue at baseline was negatively influenced by having children at home and depression. The trajectory of evening fatigue was worse for women who were employed. Morning fatigue at baseline was influenced by younger age, lower body mass index, and the degree of sleep disturbance and trait anxiety. Trajectories of morning fatigue were worse for patients with a higher disease stage and more medical comorbidities.  Conclusion:   Interindividual and diurnal variability in fatigue found in women with breast cancer is similar to that found in men with prostate cancer.

Methods:   In this 4-year, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, we compared dutasteride, at a dose of 0.5 mg daily, with placebo. Men were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were 50 to 75 years of age, had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 2.5 to 10.0 ng per milliliter, and had had one negative prostate biopsy (6 to 12 cores) within 6 months before enrollment. Subjects underwent a 10-core transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy at 2 and 4 years.  Results:   Among 6729 men who underwent a biopsy or prostate surgery, cancer was detected in 659 of the 3305 men in the dutasteride group, as compared with 858 of the 3424 men in the placebo group, representing a relative risk reduction with dutasteride of 22.8% (95% confidence interval, 15.2 to 29.8) over the 4-year study period (P<0.001). Overall, in years 1 through 4, among the 6706 men who underwent a needle biopsy, there were 220 tumors with a Gleason score of 7 to 10 among 3299 men in the dutasteride group and 233 among 3407 men in the placebo group (P=0.81). During years 3 and 4, there were 12 tumors with a Gleason score of 8 to 10 in the dutasteride group, as compared with only 1 in the placebo group (P=0.003). Dutasteride therapy, as compared with placebo, resulted in a reduction in the rate of acute urinary retention (1.6% vs. 6.7%, a 77.3% relative reduction). The incidence of adverse events was similar to that in studies of dutasteride therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia, except that in our study, as compared with previous studies, the relative incidence of the composite category of cardiac failure was higher in the dutasteride group than in the placebo group (0.7% [30 men] vs. 0.4% [16 men], P=0.03).

Methods:   A total of 60, 572 non-Hispanic white and black participants in the ongoing Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial underwent trial-sponsored screening flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSG) without biopsy at baseline in 10 geographically dispersed centers from November 1993 to July 2001. Subjects with polyps or mass lesions detected by FSG were referred to their physicians for diagnostic workup, the cost of which was not covered by PLCO. The records of follow-up evaluations were collected and reviewed. We used log binomial modeling with adjustment for age, education, sex, body mass index, smoking, family history of colorectal cancer, colon examination within previous 3 years, personal history of polyps, and screening center to examine whether utilization of diagnostic colonoscopy and yield of neoplasia differed by race.  Results:   Among 57 561 whites and 3011 blacks who underwent FSG, 13,743 (23.9%) and 767 (25.5%) had abnormal examinations, respectively. A total of 9944 (72.4%) whites and 480 (62.6%) blacks had diagnostic colonoscopy within 1 year following the abnormal FSG screening.

We examined the impact of early initiation of salvage hormonal therapy (HT) in relapsing patients randomized to RT alone arm.  Methods and materials:   Patients were divided into two groups: early salvage HT and late salvage HT. The early salvage group was defined as receiving HT with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of less than 10 ng/mL, and the late salvage HT group had a PSA level of 10 ng/mL or greater. The outcomes were overall survival (OS), cause-specific mortality (CSM), and local failure (LF). The Kaplan-Meier estimation and log-rank test were used for OS, and the cumulative incidence estimation and Gray's test were used for CSM and LF. Proportional hazards regression models were used to compare the outcomes adjusted for other covariates.  Results:   The median follow-up times of surviving patients in the early and late salvage HT groups were about 11 and 13 years, respectively. The late salvage HT group had significantly more post-prostatectomy patients and patients with high Gleason scores. After adjustment for all covariates, OS was significantly longer in the early salvage HT group (hazard ratio, 1.5; p = 0.01). However, there were no statistically significant differences in LF or CSM between the groups.  Conclusions:   The early introduction of salvage HT resulted in improved OS but not improved CSM and LF.

Two hundred-one African American men were asked if a physician had ever provided a comprehensive explanation of pros and cons of the PSA test and DRE.

Also, prostate cancer knowledge in the sample was low (mean = 43% correct). Multivariate analyses revealed that total prostate cancer knowledge was associated with men receiving a comprehensive explanation (p = .05), as well as past prostate cancer screening (p = .02) and younger age (p = .009). Although comprehensive explanation of prostate cancer screening was related to total prostate cancer knowledge, it was unrelated to a subset of items that may be central to fully informed screening decisions. Furthermore, comprehensive explanation of prostate cancer screening (p = .02), along with DRE recommendation (p = .009) and older age (p = .02), were related to fewer negative screening attitudes.

Intervention:   We developed and pretested a prostate cancer screening informed decision-making intervention based on the Ottawa Decision Support Framework and the health belief model. The intervention included a tool called the ""road map,"" which depicts the potential consequences of a decision to undergo or forgo screening. A quasiexperimental design was used to test the intervention.  Main outcome measures:   The main outcome measures were change in knowledge and self-efficacy post intervention.  Results:   Prostate cancer knowledge (p < .0001) and self-efficacy (p = .025) significantly increased.

Phosphorylation of the histone H2AX by ATM is required for the accumulation of repair proteins at the sites of double-strand breaks. Recently, it was reported that the histone acetyltransferase Tat interactive protein-60 (IPP60) is required to acetylate ATM prior to its activation. The RuvB-like proteins TIP48 and TIP49 are known to be necessary for the assembly and functional activity of the TIP60 acetyltransferase complex. In the present communication, we investigated the requirements of IIP48 and IIP49 for ATM activation by monitoring the cell cycle distribution and H2AX phosphorylation after irradiation of IIP48- and IIP49-depleted cells.

We have previously shown that the hu1G8 minibody, a humanized anti-PSCA antibody fragment (single-chain Fv-C(H)3 dimer, 80 kDa), can localize specifically and image PSCA-expressing xenografts at 21 h post-injection. However, the humanization and antibody fragment reformatting decreased its apparent affinity. Here, we sought to evaluate PET imaging contrast with affinity matured minibodies.  Methods:   Yeast scFv display, involving four rounds of selection, was used to generate the three affinity matured antibody fragments (A2, A11, and C5) that were reformatted into minibodies. These three affinity matured anti-PSCA minibodies were characterized in vitro, and following radiolabeling with (124)I were evaluated in vivo for microPET imaging of PSCA-expressing tumors.  Results:   The A2, A11, and C5 minibody variants all demonstrated improved affinity compared to the parental (P) minibody and were ranked as follows: A2 > A11 > C5 > P. The (124)I-labeled A11 minibody demonstrated higher immunoreactivity than the parental minibody and also achieved the best microPET imaging contrast in two xenograft models, LAPC-9 (prostate cancer) and Capan-1 (pancreatic cancer), when evaluated in vivo.  Conclusion:   Of the affinity variant minibodies tested, the A11 minibody that ranked second in affinity was selected as the best immunoPET tracer to image PSCA-expressing xenografts.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zoledronic acid on SREs in patients with bone metastases from bladder cancer.  Patients and methods:   Patients with bone metastases from bladder cancer who were receiving palliative radiotherapy were randomized to placebo or zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenous monthly) for 6 months.  Results:   The patients (n = 40) were evenly distributed between the two treatment groups, and the baseline demographics of the two groups were similar.

Compared with patients receiving placebo, those receiving zoledronic acid had a lower mean incidence of SREs (2.05 +/- 1.0 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.9, respectively), and a larger proportion did not experience an on-study SRE (2 vs. 8 patients, respectively). Zoledronic acid also prolonged the median time to first SRE compared with the placebo (16 vs. 8 weeks, respectively). Multiple event analysis of SREs revealed that zoledronic acid decreased the risk of SRE development by 59% (hazard ratio 0.413).

The efficacy depends on the characteristics of the patient setup error and interfraction motion through the whole treatment; specifically, systematic errors are corrected and random errors are compensated for through the margins. In online image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate cancer, the translational setup error and inter-fractional prostate motion are corrected through pre-treatment imaging and couch correction at each fraction. However, the rotation and deformation of the target are not corrected and only accounted for with margins in treatment planning. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the offline ART strategy is necessary for an online IGRT protocol and to evaluate the benefit of the hybrid strategy. First, to investigate the rationale of the hybrid strategy, 592 cone-beam-computed tomography (CBCT) images taken before and after each fraction for an online IGRT protocol from 16 patients were analyzed. Specifically, the characteristics of prostate rotation were analyzed. It was found that there exist systematic inter-fractional prostate rotations, and they are patient specific. These rotations, if not corrected, are persistent through the treatment fraction, and rotations detected in early fractions are representative of those in later fractions. These findings suggest that the offline adaptive replanning strategy is beneficial to the online IGRT protocol with further margin reductions. Second, to quantitatively evaluate the benefit of the hybrid strategy, 412 repeated helical CT scans from 25 patients during the course of treatment were included in the replanning study. Both low-risk patients (LRP, clinical target volume, CTV = prostate) and intermediate-risk patients (IRP, CTV = prostate + seminal vesicles) were included in the simulation. The contours of prostate and seminal vesicles were delineated on each CT. The benefit of margin reduction to compensate for both rotation and deformation in the hybrid strategy was evaluated geometrically. With the hybrid strategy, the planning margins can be reduced by 1.4 mm for LRP, and 2.0 mm for IRP, compared with the standard online IGRT only, to maintain the same 99% target volume coverage. The average relative reduction in planning target volume (PTV) based on the internal target volume (ITV) from PTV based on CTV is 19% for LRP, and 27% for IRP.""","""['Yu Lei', 'Qiuwen Wu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Dosimetric and geometric evaluation of a hybrid strategy of offline adaptive planning and online image guidance for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'A ""rolling average"" multiple adaptive planning method to compensate for target volume changes in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Fast online replanning for interfraction rotation correction in prostate radiotherapy.', 'Seminal vesicle inter- and intra-fraction motion during radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A review.', 'Planning target volume : Management of uncertainties, immobilization, image guided and adaptive radiation therapy.', 'Operating procedures, risk management and challenges during implementation of adaptive and non-adaptive MR-guided radiotherapy: 1-year single-center experience.', 'Adaptive proton therapy.', 'Predictive dose accumulation for HN adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.', 'Dosimetric and volumetric effects in clinical target volume and organs at risk during postprostatectomy radiotherapy.']"""

We now show, for the first time, that growth factor adapter protein p66(Shc) is indispensable for PEITC-induced apoptosis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from p66(Shc) knockout mice were significantly more resistant to PEITC-mediated growth inhibition, cytoplasmic histone-associated apoptotic DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation compared with wild-type fibroblasts. The PEITC treatment resulted in induction as well as increased Ser(36) phosphorylation of p66(Shc) in PC-3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of p66(Shc) protein conferred significant protection against PEITC-mediated cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation as well as production of reactive oxygen species in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells. The PEITC-treated PC-3 and LNCaP cells exhibited increased binding of p66(Shc) with prolyl isomerase Pin1, a protein implicated in translocation of p66(Shc) to mitochondria. Consistent with these results, treatment of PC-3 cells with PEITC resulted in translocation of p66(Shc) to the mitochondria as judged by immunoblotting using cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions and immunofluorescence microscopy. Growth suppression and apoptosis induction in tumor xenografts in vivo by oral administration of PEITC to the PC-3 tumor-bearing male athymic mice were accompanied by statistically significant increase in the level of Ser(36)-phosphorylated p66(Shc).

Upregulation of myosin VI in prostate cancer was previously shown by immunohistochemistry. The level of MYO6 mRNA was significantly induced in all primary tumor tissues compared with the nontumor tissue from the same patient.

Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that IGFBP-3 contributes to cancer risk protection in a variety of cancers, and a polymorphic variation of IGFBP-3 influences cancer risk, although other studies vary in their conclusions. Some antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3 have been reported to be independent of IGFs, but the precise biochemical/molecular mechanisms of IGF-independent, antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3 are largely unknown. Here we report a new cell death receptor, IGFBP-3R, that is a single-span membrane protein and binds specifically to IGFBP-3 but not other IGFBP species. Expression analysis of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-3R indicates that the IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R axis is impaired in breast and prostate cancer. We also provide evidence for anti-tumor effect of IGFBP-3R in vivo using prostate and breast cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice. Further in vitro studies demonstrate that IGFBP-3R mediates IGFBP-3-induced caspase-8-dependent apoptosis in various cancer cells. Knockdown of IGFBP-3R attenuated IGFBP-3-induced caspase activities and apoptosis, whereas overexpression of IGFBP-3R enhanced IGFBP-3 biological effects. IGFBP-3R physically interacts and activates caspase-8, and knockdown of caspase-8 expression or activity inhibited IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R-induced apoptosis.

The circadian timing system comprises peripheral oscillators located in most tissues of the body and a central pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Circadian genes and the proteins produced by these genes constitute the molecular components of the circadian oscillator which form positive/negative feedback loops and generate circadian rhythms. The circadian regulation extends beyond clock genes to involve various clock-controlled genes (CCGs) including various cell cycle genes. Aberrant expression of circadian clock genes could have important consequences on the transactivation of downstream targets that control the cell cycle and on the ability of cells to undergo apoptosis. This may lead to genomic instability and accelerated cellular proliferation potentially promoting carcinogenesis. Different lines of evidence in mice and humans suggest that cancer may be a circadian-related disorder. The genetic or functional disruption of the molecular circadian clock has been found in various cancers including breast, ovarian, endometrial, prostate and hematological cancers.

In this context, we intended to investigate the potential of relationship between polymorphic tandem repeats (CAG, TA and CA) in AR (androgen receptor), ERalpha (estrogen receptor alpha) and ERbeta (estrogen receptor beta) genes and the immunoexpression of PSA and AR proteins. We assessed also the possible influences of CAG, TA, and CA variables and other available prognostic factors (ER, PR, AR, HER2/neu, PSA expression, and nodal status) on disease-free survival. We assessed the polymorphic tandem repeats lengths by genotyping, followed by high-resolution denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 163 breast cancers. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the expressions of AR, PSA, ER, PR and HER2/neu proteins. Our results showed that PSA was correlated with the length of CA repeats in the 3'-untranslated region of ERbeta, shorter CA repeats being correlated with PSA expression (p=0.03). AR immunoexpression was correlated with CAG repeats on AR gene, higher number of repeats being linked to a higher AR immunoexpression (p=0.04). Performing logistic regression to investigate relationships with prognosis, we observed that PSA immunoexpression (p=0.004), the nodal status (p-<0.001) and marginally, longer TA repeats (p=0.05) were correlated with increased disease-free survival.

In this report, we demonstrate that treatment of 1-LN prostate cancer cells with this antibody decreases cell surface expression of GRP78, Akt(Thr308) and Akt(Ser473) kinase activities and reduces phosphorylation of FOXO, and GSK3beta. This treatment also suppresses activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and MKK3/6; however, it upregulates MKK4 activity. JNK, as determined by its phosphorylation state, is subsequently activated, triggering apoptosis. Incubation of cells with antibody reduced levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, while elevating pro-apoptotic BAD, BAX and BAK expression as well as cleaved caspases-3, -7, -8 and -9. Silencing GRP78 or p53 gene expression by RNAi prior to antibody treatment abrogated these effects.

Motivated by changes in breast cancer incidence during the 1990s, we evaluated the model's calibration in two recent cohorts.  Methods:   We included white, postmenopausal women from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) -AARP Diet and Health Study (NIH-AARP, 1995 to 2003), and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO, 1993 to 2006). Calibration was assessed by comparing the number of breast cancers expected from the Gail model with that observed. We then evaluated calibration by using an updated model that combined Gail model RRs with 1995 to 2003 SEER invasive breast cancer incidence rates.  Results:   Overall, the Gail model significantly underpredicted the number of invasive breast cancers in NIH-AARP, with an expected-to-observed ratio of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.89), and in PLCO, with an expected-to-observed ratio of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.90). The updated model was well-calibrated overall, with an expected-to-observed ratio of 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.05) in NIH-AARP and an expected-to-observed ratio of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.06) in PLCO. Of women age 50 to 55 years at baseline, 13% to 14% had a projected Gail model 5-year risk lower than the recommended threshold of 1.66% for use of tamoxifen or raloxifene but >or= 1.66% when using the updated model.

Thus, RASSF2 is implicated as a tumor suppressor whose inactivation facilitates transformation by disconnecting apoptotic responses from Ras. The mechanism of action of RASSF2 is not known. Here we show that RASSF2 forms a direct and endogenous complex with the prostate apoptosis response protein 4 (PAR-4) tumor suppressor. This interaction is regulated by K-Ras and is essential for the full apoptotic effects of PAR-4. RASSF2 is primarily a nuclear protein, and shuttling of PAR-4 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is essential for its function. We show that RASSF2 modulates the nuclear translocation of PAR-4 in prostate tumor cells, providing a mechanism for its biological effects.

Based on histologic data after prostatectomy, there is a growing insight that a considerable number of men who receive a diagnosis in the contemporary setting of prostate-specific antigen screening have unilateral or unifocal disease. With this, the current concept of whole-gland therapy has come into discussion. The need for improvement of intraprostatic tumor characterization is clear. Molecular imaging is one of the areas of research on this aspect. The clinical indications for positron emission tomography (PET)/CT have increased rapidly in the field of oncology and are largely based on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Both conventional CT and FDG PET, however, cannot detect prostate cancer foci <5 mm within the prostate. Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT involves imaging a region of interest rapidly (usually <10 seconds between images) during a bolus intravenous injection of a contrast agent. Through analysis of the contrast enhancement time curves, it is possible to distinguish tissues with different microvascular properties such as cancer. The technologic aspects of both imaging techniques and the clinical results of 11C-choline PET/CT for intraprostatic tumor characterization are discussed. Based on preliminary studies, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-CT may be a useful tool for localization of prostate tumors and, perhaps more importantly, quantification of therapeutic response in prostate cancer. Validation work is necessary, however, to define its accuracy and role in therapeutic paradigms such as focal therapies, particularly given the current accuracy of MRI.

Robot-assisted HIFU coagulates the entire targeted volume within the prostate transrectally, in one session, without direct tumor contact and without adjuvant endourologic therapy. It is performed with the patient receiving spinal anesthesia and without blood loss; negative immunologic influence can be excluded. Heat-destroyed cancer cells that act as tumor vaccination are discussed. Right now, the limitation of focal therapy is caused by the lack of diagnostic accuracy to determine multifocal stages of PCa reliably. Discussions of tumor development, triggering primary lesion monotherapy, do not overcome skepticism about leaving invisible tumor foci untreated. This explains why PCa therapy today treats always the entire gland. Furthermore, the thought that the problem could be solved ""radically, once forever,"" ignores the fact that in all PCa therapies, local recurrence rates are between 10% and 50%. Considering the longer survival of men in industrialized countries, a structured multimodal therapy concept should be created and evaluated in studies and should replace the competition between classic therapies. Focal therapy in most cases should be the first approach in cancer therapy because it is noninvasive, has low side effects, and is a single-session therapy. It does not exclude but may delay other, more invasive therapies in cases of cancer recurrence.

Active surveillance has been introduced as a conservative management option for PCa that closely monitors patients and treats them when progression is identified.

This study investigated the impact of a TGG pattern 4 or 5 on biochemical and pathological outcome in men operated with RP.  Material and methods:   The study reviewed 151 consecutive cases treated at the hospital between 1985 and 2006; 148 were included in the study. All prostatectomy specimens were re-examined by a genitourinary pathologist and among others parameters the presence of TGG pattern 4 or 5 was recorded. The hospital files were examined retrospectively for clinical follow-up data. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse was defined as two subsequent rising measurements above 0.20 ng/ml. The influence of a TGG pattern 4 or 5 on prognosis was assessed in a Cox proportional hazards regression model controlling for pathological stage, surgical margin (SM) status, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and extraprostatic extension (EPE).  Results:   Fifty-six patients (38%) experienced PSA relapse during follow-up. Twenty-one patients (58%) with a TGG pattern 4 or 5 had a biochemical relapse compared with 35 patients (31%) without TGG pattern 4 or 5. In the Cox regression model, TGG pattern 4 or 5 was an independent predictor of biochemical failure (p = 0.020).

We have developed a quantitative real-time PCR-based assay for the detection and quantification of human tumor cells disseminated in mouse organs. The method relies on the parallel amplification of unique, species-specific, conserved and non-transcribed sequences in the mouse and human genomes. We tested the method in xenograft models to assess the metastatic potential of various cancer cell lines, the impact of injection modality and cell type on organ distribution, and the early stages of metastasis implantation and progression. With this method, we observed clear quantitative differences among colon cancer cell lines in terms of metastasis formation in the lung, consistent with the different in vitro growth properties. The mode of cell implantation and cell intrinsic properties strongly affected the metastatic pattern of prostate and breast cancer cell lines in mouse organs. The qPCR assay accurately determined the malignant cell burden even at early stages of metastasis progression in the lung.

Diminished NKX3.1 expression is associated with prostate epithelial cell proliferation in vitro and with increasing Gleason grade in patient samples. Mouse Nkx3.1 also functions as a negative regulator of prostate cell growth in prostate cancer models. Identifying biological and environmental factors that modulate NKX3.1 accumulation is therefore central to efforts aimed at elucidating prostate growth control mechanisms. To determine the effect of inflammation on Nxk3.1 accumulation, bacterial prostatitis was induced by intraurethral inoculation of a uropathogenic E. coli strain in mice. Nkx3.1 expression was profoundly reduced in infected prostate lobes and correlated with increased expression of a proliferation marker. Androgen receptor levels were also reduced in concert with Nkx3.1, and a marked increase in the basal cell marker p63 was observed. Analyses of the inflammatory infiltrate revealed a classic acute inflammatory response that attained characteristics of a chronic state within fourteen days postinoculation. Comparison of the four prostate lobes revealed clear differences in the extent of inflammation. These data demonstrate that acute inflammation in response to a bacterial agent in the prostate is associated with a significant diminution in the level of a key regulator of prostate cell proliferation.

Methods and materials:   The new ""SAM+SWO"" scheme was retroactively applied to the daily CT images acquired for 10 prostate cancer patients on a linear accelerator and CT-on-Rails combination during the course of RT. Doses generated by the SAM+SWO scheme based on the daily CT images were compared with doses generated after patient repositioning using the current planning target volume (PTV) margin (5 mm, 3 mm toward rectum) and a reduced margin (2 mm), along with full reoptimization scans based on the daily CT images to evaluate dosimetry benefits.  Results:   For all cases studied, the online replanning method provided significantly better target coverage when compared with repositioning with reduced PTV (13% increase in minimum prostate dose) and improved organ sparing when compared with repositioning with regular PTV (13% decrease in the generalized equivalent uniform dose of rectum).

Objective:   To investigate whether our version of a posterior musculofascial reconstruction will reduce early incontinence and have a beneficial effect on patients' quality of life (QoL).  Design, setting, and participants:   One hundred seven consecutive patients undergoing primary robot-assisted radical laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) performed by a single surgeon at one tertiary referral oncology institution were alternately assigned (not randomised) to intervention (n=53) or control groups (n=54).  Surgical procedure:   RALP with median fibrous raphe reconstruction (MFRR) followed by formation of the urethrovesical anastomosis (intervention group) versus standard anastomosis without posterior reconstruction (control group).  Measurements:   Measurements included incontinence at baseline and 3-mo intervals; QoL as measured by a simple questionnaire, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life-Core 30 (QLQ-C30), and Prostate Cancer Module (PR25) questionnaires preoperatively and at 6 mo postprocedure; tumour characteristics; operative time; fascial preservation score; duration of catheterisation; and anastomotic leakage on cystogram.  Results and limitations:   For intervention and control groups respectively, mean catheter duration was 11.74 d and 12.74 d (p=0.451); leakage on cystogram was present in six and eight cases (p=0.28); and incontinence (any involuntary urine loss) at 3 mo was 75% and 69% (p=0.391) and at 6 mo was 51% and 43% (p=0.686). Urinary retention occurred only in one case (control group). The percentage of cases returning to baseline in all QoL domains (except insomnia) was similar at 6 mo between the two groups. Short follow-up, lack of blinding, and probable small differences in our method of MFRR performed compared with other studies were identified as significant limitations.

The 10 year experience of permanent brachytherapy monotherapy at a single UK centre for GS 7, intermediate risk (Memorial Sloan-Kettering model), PSA < or = 10 ng/ml, localised PCa is reported.  Materials and methods:   Between 1995 and 2004, the outcomes of 187 patients with GS 7 PCa (PSA < or = 10 ng/ml) were analysed from a cohort of 1298 men treated with permanent Iodine-125 prostate brachytherapy, including PSA relapse-free survival (PSA-RFS).

These sparse versions aim to achieve variable selection and dimension reduction simultaneously. We consider both binary and multicategory classification. We provide analytical and simulation-based insights about the variable selection properties of these approaches and benchmark them on well known publicly available datasets that involve tumor classification with high dimensional gene expression data. We show that incorporation of SPLS into a generalized linear model (GLM) framework provides higher sensitivity in variable selection for multicategory classification with unbalanced sample sizes between classes. As the sample size increases, the two-stage approach provides comparable sensitivity with better specificity in variable selection.

The present study investigated new drug combinations with potential outcome for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. This final clinical stage exhibits predominantly hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) cells but also a minority of hormone responsive cells.  Methods:   Growth inhibition activity of simultaneous and sequential combinations was evaluated by resazurin assay. In vitro evaluation of synergism, additivity, or antagonism, against prostate cancer cell lines, was performed by the median effect analysis. The importance of dosage, exposure time, drug ratio, and type of treatment were investigated and compared.  Results:   Most simultaneous combinations of two drugs with different mechanisms of action or of two topoisomerase II inhibitors resulted in mild antagonism of antiproliferative effects, particularly notorious at high cell death. Imatinib-mitoxantrone and ciprofloxacin-etoposide combinations were exceptions, as they yielded additivity and dose reduction index (DRI) values of 2.6 and 3.5-fold for mitoxantrone and etoposide, respectively. Sequential combinations (ciprofloxacin or imatinib pre-treatment) revealed additive growth inhibition effects, translated in much higher DRI values (from 7.0 to 15.3-fold). Moderate synergism was restricted to sequential ciprofloxacin combinations at high cell death.  Conclusions:   Ciprofloxacin and imatinib significantly improve growth inhibition activity of standard antineoplastic drugs in a schedule-dependent manner and, therefore, may have an important role as adjuvant therapeutic agents in a clinical setting.""","""['Ana Catarina Pinto', 'Susana Ângelo', 'João Nuno Moreira', 'Sérgio Simões']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Ciprofloxacin sensitizes hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell lines to doxorubicin and docetaxel treatment on a schedule-dependent manner.', 'Liposomal imatinib-mitoxantrone combination: formulation development and therapeutic evaluation in an animal model of prostate cancer.', 'Enhanced inhibitory effect of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor Ro 28-2653 in combination with estramustine and etoposide on the prostate carcinoma in the rat Dunning orthotopic tumor model.', 'Targeted therapeutic approaches for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Paclitaxel combination therapy in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer: a review.', 'Quinolones as a Potential Drug in Genitourinary Cancer Treatment-A Literature Review.', 'Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin as Potential Drugs in Genitourinary Cancer Treatment-The Effect of Dose-Response on 2D and 3D Cell Cultures.', 'Tr-KIT/c-KIT ratio in renal cell carcinoma.', 'The stem cell factor (SCF)/c-KIT signalling in testis and prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of c-Abl kinase activity renders cancer cells highly sensitive to mitoxantrone.']"""

We used two large Phase III trials involving androgen deprivation therapy and external beam radiation therapy to assess the significance of a BST.  Methods and materials:   All patients with a BST and complete data (n = 2,478) were included in this analysis and divided into four categories: ""Very Low BST"" (VLBST) ≤16.5th percentile of BST (≤248 ng/dL; n = 408); ""Low BST"" (LBST) >16.5th percentile and ≤33rd percentile (>248 ng/dL but ≤314 ng/dL; n = 415); ""Average BST"" (ABST) >33rd percentile and ≤67th percentile (314-437 ng/dL; n = 845); and ""High BST"" (HBST) >67th percentile (>437 ng/dL; n = 810).

All outcomes were adjusted for the following covariates: treatment arm, BST, age (<70 vs. ≥70), prostate-specific antigen (PSA; <10 vs. 10 ≤ PSA <20 vs. 20 ≤), Gleason score (2-6 vs. 7 vs. 8-10); T stage (T1-T2 vs. T3-T4), and Karnofsky Performance Status (60-90 vs. 100).  Results:   On multivariable analysis age, Gleason score, and PSA were independently associated with an increased risk of biochemical failure, distant metastasis and a reduced cause-specific and overall survival (p < 0.05), but BST was not.

These data were analyzed in terms of the institutional stratification of the Patterns of Care Study.  Results:   The total numbers of new cancer patients and total cancer patients (new and repeat) treated with radiation in 2007 were estimated at 181,000 and 218,000, respectively.

To carry out the match, the positions were overlaid on the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) generated from the planning CT. The distance between each FM was calculated for seven treatments throughout the EBRT course. Four radiotherapy technologists were asked to independently perform and rate the match from OBI to DRR which was then correlated to the extent of FM migration.  Results:   All the matches were rated by at least three radiotherapy technologists as ""very easy"" (""easy"" subgroup) for 24 patients (77%), while the other seven patients had their match rated less than ""very easy"" and considered the ""not easy"" subgroup. The average daily FM migration was 0.93+/-0.34 mm for the ""easy"" subgroup vs. 1.82+/-0.75 mm for the latter. An average migration >2 mm was seen in five/seven patients in the ""not easy"" subgroup as compared to none in the ""easy"" subgroup.

Methods:   Patients treated for intermediate-risk prostate cancer per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines from 1996 to 2005 were studied. Variables potentially affecting bRFS were examined using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Five-year bRFS rates were calculated by actuarial methods; bRFS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Nadir +2 definition of biochemical failure was used for RT and PI patients; a PSA ≥ 0.4 ng/mL was used for radical prostatectomy (RP) patients. Time to initiation of salvage therapy was compared for each treatment group using the Kruskal-Wallis test.  Results:   Nine-hundred seventy-nine patients were analyzed with a median follow-up of 65 months. Five years bRFS rate was 82.8% for all patients (89.5% PI, 85.7% RT, 79.9% RRP, and 60.2% LRP). Patients treated by LRP had significantly worse bRFS than RT (P < .0001), PI (P < .0001), or RRP patients (P = .0038). Treatment modality (P < .0001) and average number of PSA tests per year (P < .0001) were the only independent predictors of bRFS on multivariate analysis. Median time to initiation of salvage therapy from time of treatment was 28.6 months for all patients (26.1 RP, 21.0 LRP, 47.4 PI, 47.8 RT; P < .0001).

Methods:   A group of 298 patients has been surveyed prospectively before (time A), at the last day (B), two months after (C) and >one year after (D) radiotherapy using a validated questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite). A subgroup of 10% with the greatest urinary/bowel bother score decrease at time D was defined as patients with adverse long-term QoL.  Results:   Subgroup and correlation analyses could demonstrate a strong dependence of urinary/bowel QoL after radiotherapy on urinary/bowel QoL before radiotherapy. In contrast to absolute scores, QoL score changes (relative to baseline scores) did not correlate with pretreatment scores. Long-term changes could be well predicted by acute changes. Patients reporting great/moderate bother with urinary/bowel problems at time C reported to have great/moderate bother at time D in > or = 50%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis of factors for adverse long-term urinary and bowel QoL, score changes at time C were found to be independent predictors, respectively. Additionally, QoL changes at time B were independently predictive for adverse long-term bowel QoL.  Conclusions:   Consequential late effects play a major role after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   Positive surgical margins (PSM) during RP predispose to earlier biochemical recurrence, and occur most frequently at the prostatic apex. Conventional apical transection after early ligation of the dorsal venous complex (DVC) remains suboptimal, as this approach obscures visualization of the intersection between prostatic apex and membranous urethra, leading to inadvertent apical capsulotomy and eventual margin positivity. A synchronous urethral transection commenced via a retro-apical approach was adopted in 209 consecutive patients undergoing RARP by one surgeon (A.T.) between April to September 2009. The apical margin rates for this group were compared with those of 1665 previous patients who received conventional urethral transection via an anterior approach after DVC ligation. Outcomes were adjusted for differences in clinicopathological variables. All RP specimens were processed according to institutional protocols, and examined by dedicated genitourinary pathologists. The location of PSMs was identified as apex, posterior, posterolateral, bladder neck, anterior, base, or multifocal.  Results:   Patients receiving synchronous urethral transection had significantly lower apical PSM rates than the control group (1.4% vs 4.4%, P = 0.04). This marked improvement in the retro-apical group occurred despite a significantly higher incidence of aggressive cancer (≥ pT3a) documented on final specimen pathology (16% vs 10%, P = 0.027).Technical difficulty was encountered in three of 209 study patients, in whom urethral transection had to be completed using the classic anterior approach.  Conclusion:   Improved circumferential visualization of the prostatic apex, membranous urethra and their anatomical intersection facilitates precise dissection of the apex and its surrounding neural scaffold, and optimizes membranous urethral preservation.

Twenty-five patients underwent RLRP using the reconstruction of the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter (Rocco repair). Results of 25 consecutive patients who underwent RLRP prior to the implementation of the Rocco repair were used as the control.

Results:   There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in any of the patient demographics. At 7 days, the Rocco experimental group had a continence rate of 19% vs. 38.1% in the non-Rocco control group (p = 0.306).

At 180 days, the pad-free rate was 96% in both groups.

Methodologically, we constructed a tissue microarray comprising more than 600 PCA cases including matching benign prostate tissue. TARP protein expression was carefully analysed and associated with clinico-pathological parameters, PSA-relapse free survival and expression data of established and proposed diagnostic markers (AMACR, p63, GOLPH2). Our results show that TARP is significantly over-expressed in the vast majority (approximately 85%) of PCA in comparison to non neoplastic prostate tissue. Its expression was associated with conventional markers of unfavourable and more aggressive tumour behaviour. However, a prognostic value of TARP could not be found. The diagnostic value of TARP is limited in comparison to AMACR, p63 or GOLPH2.

However, recent publications demonstrate the important impact of different operative techniques with regard to postoperative continence.The preservation of the muscular urethral sphincter is of particular importance. Nevertheless, the preservation of further anatomical structures contributes to postoperative continence. Preservation of bladder neck, nerve sparing, and reconstruction of the vesicourethral junction are operative techniques to prevent postoperative incontinence. In the last decade different modifications of the operative technique have been investigated regarding specific effects on postoperative continence. The interpretation of these studies investigating these operative techniques showed improvement in early continence with shorter period of time to continence. Long-term follow-up revealed no significant advantages for these modifications with regard to continence compared to the standard procedure. To evaluate the long-term effects of certain modifications to prevent incontinence, randomized and well powered studies are necessary.

Principal findings:   Forty-five compounds, including twenty-eight drugs approved for use in humans, were evaluated against XMRV replication in vitro. We found that the retroviral integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, was potent and selective against XMRV at submicromolar concentrations, in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, a breast cancer and prostate cancer cell line, respectively. Another integrase inhibitor, L-000870812, and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, zidovudine (ZDV), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) also inhibited XMRV replication.

In the present study, the pharmacokinetics of gammaT3 and the in vivo cytotoxic response of androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPCa) tumor following gammaT3 treatment were investigated. Here, we investigated these antitumor effects for PCa tumors in vivo. The pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution of gammaT3 after exogenous gammaT3 supplementation were examined. Meanwhile, the response of the tumor to gammaT3 alone or in combination with DTX were studied by real-time in vivo bioluminescent imaging and by examination of biomarkers associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis. After intraperitoneal injection, gammaT3 rapidly disappeared from the serum and was selectively deposited in the AIPCa tumor cells. Administration of gammaT3 alone for 2 weeks resulted in a significant shrinkage of the AIPCa tumors. Meanwhile, further inhibition of the AIPCa tumor growth was achieved by combined treatment of gammaT3 and DTX (p < 0.002). The in vivo cytotoxic antitumor effects induced by gammaT3 seem to be associated with a decrease in expression of cell proliferation markers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Ki-67 and Id1) and an increase in the rate of cancer cell apoptosis [cleaved caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase]. Additionally, the combined agents may be more effective at suppressing the invasiveness of AIPCa.

Importantly, receptor mRNA levels faithfully predicted the growth-inhibitory qualities of receptor ligands in nonendocrine tumors. Correlation analysis using NR expression profiles and drug response information across the cell line panel uncovered a number of new potential receptor-drug interactions, suggesting that in these cases, individual receptor levels may predict response to chemotherapeutic interventions. Similarly, by cross-comparing receptor levels within our expression dataset and relating these profiles to existing microarray gene expression data, we defined interactions among receptors and between receptors and other genes that can now be mechanistically queried.

Although K-Ras is highly expressed in a variety of cancers, the regulation of E-cadherin expression by K-Ras in association with DNA methylation and cell metastasis has not been completely clarified. In this study, E-cadherin expression was repressed in 267B1/K-Ras human epithelial prostate cancer cells stably overexpressing K-Ras, resulting from hypermethylation of E-cadherin promoter as evidenced by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), bisulfite sequencing, real-time reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analysis. The increased level of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 3b in 267B1/K-Ras cells was reduced by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of k-ras, whereas DNMT1 and DNMT3a did not change regardless of K-Ras or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5'-AzaC) treatment. Furthermore, binding of DNMT3b to E-cadherin promoter was increased in 267B1/K-Ras cells but was reduced by 5'-AzaC, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, which was in agreement with cell aggregation and invasive mobilization of the cells. Hence, our data suggest that increased binding of DNMT3b to E-cadherin promoter region by K-Ras cause promoter hypermethylation for reduced expression of E-cadherin, leading to the decreased cell aggregation and increased metastasis of human prostate cancer cells overexpressing K-Ras.""","""['Osong Kwon', 'Sook Jung Jeong', 'Sun Ok Kim', 'Long He', 'Hee Gu Lee', 'Kyung Lib Jang', 'Hiroyuki Osada', 'Mira Jung', 'Bo Yeon Kim', 'Jong Seog Ahn']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Inhibition of p53 represses E-cadherin expression by increasing DNA methyltransferase-1 and promoter methylation in serous borderline ovarian tumor cells.', 'Silencing of the metastasis suppressor RECK by RAS oncogene is mediated by DNA methyltransferase 3b-induced promoter methylation.', 'DNA methyltransferase 1 expression and promoter methylation of E-cadherin in mucoepidermoid carcinoma.', 'Promoter methylation regulates cadherin switching in squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Epigenetic changes induced by reactive oxygen species in hepatocellular carcinoma: methylation of the E-cadherin promoter.', 'Integration of transcriptome and proteome analyses reveal molecular mechanisms for formation of replant disease in Nelumbo nucifera.', 'Muscle Transcriptomics Shows Overexpression of Cadherin 1 in Inclusion Body Myositis.', 'Overexpression of wild type or a Q311E mutant MB21D2 promotes a pro-oncogenic phenotype in HNSCC.', 'Methylation pattern of CDH1 promoter and its association with CDH1 gene expression in cytological cervical specimens.', 'The epigenetic modifier DNMT3A is necessary for proper otic placode formation.']"""

It has been targeted by monoclonal antibodies in preclinical animal models and more recently in a clinical trial in prostate cancer patients. The biological role played in tumor growth is presently unknown. In this report we have characterized the contribution of PSCA expression to tumor growth.  Methods:   A bladder cell line was engineered to express a doxycycline (dox) regulated shRNA against PSCA. To shed light on the PSCA biological role in tumor growth, microarray analysis was carried out as a function of PSCA expression. Expression of gene set of interest was further analyzed by qPCR RESULTS: Down regulation of the PSCA expression was associated with reduced cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mice bearing subcutaneous tumors showed a reduced tumor growth upon treatment with dox, which effectively induced shRNA against PSCA as revealed by GFP expression. Pathway analysis of deregulated genes suggests a statistical significant association between PSCA downregulation and activation of genes downstream of the IFNalpha/beta receptor.

Results:   Age-specific incidence rose (0.1-0.9% per year, on average) in every sex-race group, with factors related to both time period and birth cohort membership appearing to accelerate the increases in women.

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of underlying previously unrecognized etiology in a consecutive series of patients undergoing kyphoplasty to treat vertebral compression fractures. A prospective histological evaluation of vertebral body biopsy specimens from presumed osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were performed in order to identify aforementioned causes. Over a 2-year period, vertebral body biopsies from 154 vertebral levels were performed in 75 patients undergoing kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fractures. All patients received a preoperative workup that included plain radiographs, MRI, whole body bone scan, and laboratory examinations. Bone specimens were obtained from affected vertebral bodies and submitted for histologic evaluation to identify the prevalence of an underlying cause. All specimens demonstrated fragmented bone with variable amounts of unmineralised bone, signs of bone-remodeling and/or fracture-healing. In 11 patients underlying pathology other than osteoporosis was identified (prostate cancer, 1; pancreatic cancer, 1; colon cancer, 1; breast cancer, 2; multiple myeloma, 3; leukemia, 1; and lung cancer, 2). In all but one patient the results of the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis suspected from the preoperative workup. For the last patient, namely the one with pancreatic cancer, the workup did not identify the origin of the primary tumor, although the patient was considered to have a compression fracture secondary to metastatic disease of unknown origin, the vertebral biopsy suggested the presence of adenocarcinoma which eventually was proven to be pancreatic cancer. In augmentation procedures for vertebral compression fractures, bone biopsy should be reserved for the patients where the preoperative evaluation raises the suspicion of a non-osteoporotic etiology.""","""['Spiros G Pneumaticos', 'Sofia N Chatziioannou', 'Christiana Savvidou', 'Anastasia Pilichou', 'Dimitra Rontogianni', 'Dimitrios S Korres']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur Spine J""","""['The value of routinely performing a bone biopsy during percutaneous vertebroplasty in treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.', 'Unsuspected lymphoma diagnosed with use of biopsy during kyphoplasty.', 'Functional outcomes and height restoration for patients with multiple myeloma-related osteolytic vertebral compression fractures treated with kyphoplasty.', 'Vertebral Augmentation Involving Vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty for Cancer-Related Vertebral Compression Fractures: A Systematic Review.', 'Vertebral Augmentation Involving Vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty for Cancer-Related Vertebral Compression Fractures: An Economic Analysis.', 'Evaluation of biopsy results during vertebral augmentation in patients with a known history of malignancy.', 'Value of routine transpedicular biopsies in kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty for vertebral compression fractures : A survey among 250 spine surgeons.', 'The role of routine transpedicular biopsies during kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty for vertebral compression fractures in the detection of malignant diseases: a systematic review.', 'The Diagnostic Value of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Identifying Unsuspected Malignancy in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation for Vertebral Compression Fractures.', 'Tuberculous spondylitis after percutaneous vertebroplasty: A case series of 9 cases.']"""

Forty-two fine needle biopsies from malignant, tumor adjacent and benign areas were obtained from 14 patients scheduled for a prostatic biopsy. Biomarker expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and correlated to different localizations. We observed a reduction of Akt signaling proteins in cancer tissue compared to benign controls with significantly lower expression of p27kip1 (P=0.0024), PTEN (P=0.0045) and p-Akt (P=0.028). A pathologist histopathologically classified the tumor adjacent tissue obtained from areas distinctly apart from the primary tumor as benign in all cases. In these regions we observed an intermediate expression of Akt signaling proteins without significant difference in relation to the findings in the malignant samples. The expression of Akt signaling proteins is reduced in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate tissue. The intermediate expression of these proteins in tumor adjacent tissue warrants further investigations into the role of Akt signaling in the carcinogenesis and early detection of prostate cancer.

A putative androgen-responsive regulatory region at the SORD 5' promoter was identified using promoter deletion constructs in a luciferase reporter assay in COS-7 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was used to assess the binding of androgen receptor to suggested androgen responsive regulatory region. Finally, the expression of SORD in the human prostate was evaluated in 29 prostate tissue samples by immunohistochemistry. The expression of SORD decreased after castration. Androgen supplementation to the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line led to a 7.5-fold increase in SORD mRNA expression. Furthermore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay proved that the androgen receptor can bind to this putative androgen-responsive regulatory region. Finally, the expression of SORD in the human prostate was localised to epithelial cells of both benign and malignant prostate tissue by immunohistochemistry.

Methods:   In all, 330 men participating in the prostate testing for cancer and treatment (ProtecT) study were studied; aged 50-69 years with a PSA level of > or = 3 ng ml(-1) and a negative biopsy result. Distress and negative mood were measured at four time-points: two during diagnostic testing and two after a negative biopsy result.  Results:   The majority of men were not greatly affected by testing or a negative biopsy result. The impact on psychological health was highest at the time of the biopsy, with around 20% reporting high distress (33 out of 171) and tense/anxious moods (35 out of 180). Longitudinal analysis on 195 men showed a significant increase in distress at the time of the biopsy compared with levels at the PSA test (difference in Impact of Events Scale (IES) score: 9.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) (6.97, 12.12); P<0.001).

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor transcription factor. We found that treatment of the human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells with TZDs leads to inhibition of FoxM1 gene expression. No PPARγ/retinoid X receptor (RXR) consensus DNA binding sites were detected in the FoxM1 promoter extending to -10 kb upstream, and knockdown of PPARγ had no impact on TZD mediated downregulation of FoxM1 expression. Previously, others showed that PPARγ agonists inhibit the expression and DNA-binding activity of the Sp1 transcription factor. Here we show that Sp1 binds to the FoxM1 promoter region and positively regulates FoxM1 transcription, while mithramycin, a chemotherapy drug that specifically binds GC rich sequences in the DNA and inhibits activities of Sp1, inhibits expression of FoxM1.

However, when high-risk factors are present, such as increased prostate-specific antigen, elevated Gleason scores and advanced T stage, undetected spreading of the cancer, and development of radiation-resistant cancer cells are concerns. Thus, additional therapeutic agents that can selectively sensitize advanced prostate cancer to radiation therapy are needed. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI571), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was evaluated for its potential to enhance the efficacy of ionizing radiation (IR) against aggressive prostate cancer cells. STI571 significantly enhances the IR-induced cytotoxicity of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells but not of androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells. The differential cytotoxic effects due to STI571 are associated with the nuclear level of RelB in prostate cancer cells. STI571 inhibits IR-induced RelB nuclear translocation, leading to increased radiosensitivity in aggressive androgen-independent PC-3 and DU-145 cells. In contrast, STI571 enhances RelB nuclear translocation in androgen-responsive LNCaP cells. The different effects of STI571 on RelB nuclear translocation are consistent with RelB DNA binding activity and related target gene expression. STI571 inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-IkappaB kinase-alpha pathway in PC-3 cells by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Tyr458) and AKT (Ser473), whereas STI571 increases NF-kappaB inducible kinase (Thr559) phosphorylation, leading to activation of IkappaB kinase-alpha in LNCaP cells. These results reveal that STI571 exhibits differential effects on the upstream kinases leading to different downstream effects on the NF-kappaB alternative pathway in prostate cancer cells and suggest that STI571 is effective for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer in the context of high constitutive levels of RelB.

Methods:   Patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy were enrolled, and biologic specimens were obtained at surgery. The patients were genotyped for the R462Q RNASEL variant using a TaqMan genotyping assay on DNA from the peripheral blood. A serum assay that detects XMRV neutralizing antibodies was developed and used to determine which patients had serologic evidence of previous infection with XMRV virus.

MicroRNA u6 was the endogenous control. Cancer cell lines for positive controls; breast MCF-7, prostate Du-145, and glioblastoma U118. The negative control was normal lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5. RT-PCR was performed on StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystem, USA). MiRNA expressions of malignant cells were compared with normal fibroblast cells as well as endogenous control (u6) using the thermal cycle at threshold. Assessment of miRNA expression profiles were then performed using agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis software (SPSS13, USA).  Results:   We demonstrated that miR-21, miR-182 and let7-5a were over-expressed, and miR-145 and miR-155 were under-expressed in all cancer cell lines. Combined with the cluster analysis we were able to clearly distinguish cell lines for normal fibroblasts, breast cancer, prostate cancer, glioblastoma, and lung cancer.

We have documented previously induction of G(1) arrest and apoptosis by MSeA in association with upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) proteins p21Cip1 and/or p27Kip1 in DU145 prostate cancer cells. However, whether these CDKIs play a critical mediator role in G(1) arrest and apoptosis by MSeA has not been addressed. In the present work, we show exposure of p53-mutant DU145 cells to sub-apoptotic concentrations of MSeA induced p21cip1 mRNA (3 h) and protein (6 h) much faster than p27kip1 mRNA (12 h) and protein (12 h). Knocking down of p21 by siRNA completely abolished G(1) arrest induction by MSeA in DU145 cells, yet si-p27 RNA had no attenuation effect on the G(1) arrest. Depletion of p21Cip1 alone or both p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 increased MSeA-induced caspase-mediated apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation detected increased binding of p21Cip1 to CDK2 and CDK6 in MSeA-exposed DU145 cells. In DU145 xenografts from mice acutely treated with MSeA p.o., the induction of p21Cip1 was observed at 72 h of daily exposure. In p53-wild type LNCaP PCa cells and p53-null PC-3 PCa cells, MSeA modestly and transiently upregulated p21Cip1 protein level, subsiding to basal level by 24 h, without affecting P27Kip1 abundance in the same duration. Si-p21 RNA knockdown in these cells have only a partial effect to reverse G(1) arrest induction by MSeA. Together, our data support persistent, p53-independent, p21Cip1 induction as a critical mediator of MSeA-induced G(1) arrest in DU145 PCa cells, however, p21Cip1 induction and G(1) arrest were not necessary for, and may antagonize, caspase-mediated apoptosis.""","""['Zhe Wang', 'Hyo-Jeong Lee', 'Yubo Chai', 'Hongbo Hu', 'Lei Wang', 'Yong Zhang', 'Cheng Jiang', 'Junxuan Lü']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Curr Cancer Drug Targets""","""['Distinct effects of methylseleninic acid versus selenite on apoptosis, cell cycle, and protein kinase pathways in DU145 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Methylseleninic acid inhibits microvascular endothelial G1 cell cycle progression and decreases tumor microvessel density.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.', 'Vitamin D-related therapies in prostate cancer.', 'Phenoxodiol: isoflavone analog with antineoplastic activity.', 'Leishmanicidal activities of novel methylseleno-imidocarbamates.', 'Association of mutation and hypermethylation of p21 gene with susceptibility to breast cancer: a study from north India.', 'Methylseleninic acid suppresses pancreatic cancer growth involving multiple pathways.', 'Selenium compounds, apoptosis and other types of cell death: an overview for cancer therapy.', 'Tanshinones from Chinese medicinal herb Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) suppress prostate cancer growth and androgen receptor signaling.']"""

Methods:   We established two different prostate cancer EMT models, LNCaP/HIF1alpha and ARCaP, cultured LNCaP, LNCaP/HIF1alpha, IF11 and IA8 cells in vitro, and detected the five transcription factors Snail, Slug, ZEB1, SIP1 and Twist1 in these cells by RT-PCR.  Results:   Different levels of Snail, Slug, ZEB1, SIP1 and Twist1 were detected in both LNCaP and LNCaP/HIF1alpha cells, with significant differences only in the expressions of Slug and Twist1 between the two cells. The expression of Slug was increased, but that of Twist1 decreased in the LNCaP/HIF1alpha cells. All the five transcription factors but Twist1 were expressed in both the IF11 and IA8 cells, but only the express- sions of ZEB1 and Slug were increased significantly in the IA8 cells.  Conclusion:   There are different mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation in different prostate cancer EMT models.

The most frequent and severe patient health problems and their perceptions of priority health problems were identified and compared across five patient groups as a strategy to inform the supportive care role of the advanced oncology nurse for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The study found that the majority of men with early stage and advanced hormone sensitive prostate cancer can expect to enjoy good quality of life for several years following diagnosis. These two patient groups have common priority needs for improving their health related to sexual function, urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, and physical activity. Both groups may benefit from an advanced practice nursing (APN) role that can provide episodic supportive care for health problems occurring at different treatment stages. Conversely, it was found that men with advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer experience significantly poorer HRQL and have multiple severe health problems. These patients also have different priority needs including problems related to pain, fatigue, and decreased physical activity. Because of this, the focus of supportive care programs and interventions in advanced prostate cancer will differ for those with hormone refractory disease.

Methods:   We interfered DU145 cells with cyclopamine at the concentrations of 1, 10, 50 and 100 micromol/L and detected its inhibitory effect on the cells by MTT colorimetry assay at 24, 48 and 72 hours, as well as its effect on the cell cycle by flow cytometry. We also determined the difference in the mRNA expression of cyclin E between the experimental and control groups by RT-PCR at 48 hours after 50 +/- micromol/L cyclopamine intervention.  Results:   Cyclopamine inhibited the DU145 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with inhibition rates of 7.42, 12.70 and 59.15% in the 10, 50 and 100 micromol/L groups respectively at 24 hours, significantly different from that of the blank control group (P < 0.05).

Methods:   In vitro cancer cell growth inhibition was measured by SRB or MTT assay in human cancer cell lines. Apoptosis induced by 15 was examined in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Effects of 15 on cell cycle distribution and tubulin were investigated via in vitro models. In vivo toxicity and xenograft efficacy studies were conducted in mice.  Results:   Indole 15 inhibited the in vitro growth of a number of human cancer cell lines, including drug-resistant cell lines that over-express P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, and breast cancer resistance protein with IC(50) values in the range of 34-162 nM. Nanomolar concentrations of the compound caused down-regulation of bcl-2, induced PARP cleavage, and induced apoptosis in both LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells, as confirmed by anti-histone ELISA and DNA laddering. In vitro studies revealed that the compound inhibited polymerization of purified tubulin and induced a strong and concentration-dependent G(2)M arrest in PC-3 cells. In vivo studies in immunodeficient mice bearing PC-3 tumor xenografts showed that the compound effectively inhibited tumor growth.

In addition to other physiological properties, it has clear antiproliferative activity in several types of cancer cell. The concentration of melatonin necessary to inhibit cell growth is much higher than its blood physiological concentrations in some tumor types. For years its indolic nature has impeded proper monitoring, by molecular or immunological techniques, of its uptake by cancer cells. In this work we developed a simple, rapid, and validated analytical method for detection and quantification of MEL inside normal and cancer cells. For this purpose we performed high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis after liquid-liquid extraction of the indole from biological samples. The method was validated, and the correlation coefficient for amounts from 0.125 to 1.25 microg was higher than 0.999, with a range of recovery near 100%. Precision was evaluated as repeatability, and for intermediate precision, the relative standard deviation was less than 5%. The method was used to study the stability of the indole in solution and to determine intracellular melatonin concentrations in normal (PNT1A) and several cancer (LNCaP, DU-145, PC-3) prostate cell lines. Intracellular LOQ/LOD were 7.23/2.83, 23.17/9.07, 4.03/1.83, and 6.51/2.53 nmol L(-1), or 1.82/4.66, 0.56/1.45, 3.26/8.34, and 2.02/5.17 attogram in each cell in PNT1A, LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 cells, respectively. Because there was no information about intracellular levels of melatonin inside normal or tumor prostate cells after treatment with the indole, nor a relationship between its antiproliferative activity and its intracellular concentration, this is the first time that, by using an analytical method combined with measurement of cellular volume by flow cytometry, the intracellular concentration of MEL has been estimated. Also, data obtained here explain why the antiproliferative properties of MEL vary in different cell types. This is, moreover, the first time that by increasing the intracellular concentration of melatonin, its antitumor properties have been promoted in prostate cancer cells. This process can be monitored by the method developed here.""","""['D Hevia', 'J C Mayo', 'I Quiros', 'C Gomez-Cordoves', 'R M Sainz']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Anal Bioanal Chem""","""['Development and validation of new methods for the determination of melatonin and its oxidative metabolites by high performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis, using multivariate optimization.', 'Melatonin uptake in prostate cancer cells: intracellular transport versus simple passive diffusion.', 'Melatonin and prostate cancer cell proliferation: interplay with castration, epidermal growth factor, and androgen sensitivity.', 'Measurement of melatonin and its metabolites: importance for the evaluation of their biological roles.', 'Melatonin measurements in tissues.

As the first to be encountered by infiltrating prostate cancer cells, prostate stromal cells form the first defense line against prostate cancer progression and metastasis. However, interaction between prostate cancer and stromal cells may facilitate the formation of a tumor microenvironment favoring cancer cell growth and survival. To establish an experimental system for studying the interaction between cancer and stromal cells, we isolated three matched pairs of normal and cancer-associated human prostate stromal clones. In this report, we describe the morphologic and behavioral characteristics of these cells and their effect on LNCaP prostate cancer cells in co-culture. Unlike LNCaP prostate cancer cells, the isolated prostate stromal clones are large fibroblast-like cells with a slow proliferation rate. Growth and survival of these clones are not affected by androgens. The stromal cells display high resistance to serum starvation, while cancer-associated stromal clones have differentiated survival ability. In co-culture experiments, the stromal cells protected some LNCaP prostate cancer cells from death by serum starvation, and cancer-associated stromal clones showed more protection.

Two intracellular tyrosine kinases, Ack1 (activated cdc42-associated kinase) and Src, phosphorylate and enhance AR activity and promote prostate xenograft tumor growth in castrated animals. However, the upstream signals that activate these kinases and lead to AR activation are incompletely characterized. In this study, we investigated AR phosphorylation in response to non-androgen ligand stimulation using phospho-specific antibodies. Treatment of LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF), heregulin, Gas6 (ligand binding to the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase and activating Ack1 downstream), interleukin (IL)-6 or bombesin stimulated cell proliferation in the absence of androgen. Treatment of LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells with EGF, heregulin or Gas6 induced AR phosphorylation at Tyr-267, whereas IL-6 or bombesin treatment did not. AR phosphorylation at Tyr-534 was induced by treatment with EGF, IL-6 or bombesin, but not by heregulin or Gas6. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Ack1 or Src showed that Ack1 mediates heregulin- and Gas6-induced AR Tyr-267 phosphorylation, whereas Src mediates Tyr-534 phosphorylation induced by EGF, IL-6 and bombesin. Dasatinib, a Src inhibitor, blocked EGF-induced Tyr-534 phosphorylation. In addition, we showed that dasatinib also inhibited Ack1 kinase. Dasatinib inhibited heregulin-induced Ack1 kinase activity and AR Tyr-267 phosphorylation. In addition, dasatinib inhibited heregulin-induced AR-dependent reporter activity. Dasatinib also inhibited heregulin-induced expression of endogenous AR target genes. Dasatinib inhibited Ack1-dependent colony formation and prostate xenograft tumor growth in castrated mice. Interestingly, Ack1 or Src knockdown or dasatinib did not inhibit EGF-induced AR Tyr-267 phosphorylation or EGF-stimulated AR activity, suggesting the existence of an additional tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates AR at Tyr-267. These data suggest that specific tyrosine kinases phosphorylate AR at distinct sites and that dasatinib may exert antitumor activity in prostate cancer through inhibition of Ack1.""","""['Y Liu', 'M Karaca', 'Z Zhang', 'D Gioeli', 'H S Earp', 'Y E Whang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Activated Cdc42-associated kinase Ack1 promotes prostate cancer progression via androgen receptor tyrosine phosphorylation.', 'Src controls castration recurrence of CWR22 prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Aberrant activation of androgen receptor in a new neuropeptide-autocrine model of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor activation in castration-recurrent prostate cancer: the role of Src-family and Ack1 tyrosine kinases.', 'Oncogenic activation of androgen receptor.', 'The testosterone paradox of advanced prostate cancer: mechanistic insights and clinical implications.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Regulation of Androgen Receptors in Major Female Reproductive System Cancers.', 'Prostate tumor RON receptor signaling mediates macrophage recruitment to drive androgen deprivation therapy resistance through Gas6-mediated Axl and RON signaling.', 'The Androgen Receptor and Its Crosstalk With the Src Kinase During Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

MIF overexpression has been observed in many tumors and is implicated in oncogenic transformation and tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating MIF expression remain poorly understood. In this study, we showed that the transcriptional repressor HBP1 (HMG box-containing protein 1) negatively regulates MIF expression. We first identified a large high-affinity HBP1 DNA-binding element at positions -811 to -792 from the transcriptional start site within the MIF promoter by computer analysis. Reporter analyses showed that this element was required for HBP1-mediated transcriptional repression. Furthermore, HBP1 associated with the MIF promoter in vivo and repressed endogenous MIF gene expression. Consistent with HBP1-mediated repression of MIF, low levels of HBP1 expression were associated with high levels of MIF expression in prostate cancer samples. Importantly, HBP1-mediated repression of MIF inhibited tumorigenic growth and invasion, and the repressive effect of HBP1 on tumorigenic growth and invasion could be partially rescued by the addition of recombinant MIF to the culture medium. Finally, prostate tumor samples with low HBP1 and high MIF expression were associated with a significant decrease in relapse-free survival. Taken together, these results indicated that HBP1 directly inhibited MIF gene transcription, and suggested that the loss of HBP1 expression or activity may contribute to the upregulation of MIF expression in prostate tumor tissue.""","""['Y C Chen', 'X W Zhang', 'X H Niu', 'D Q Xin', 'W P Zhao', 'Y Q Na', 'Z B Mao']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['E2F sites in the Op18 promoter are required for high level of expression in the human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3-M.', ""Transcriptional regulation of the androgen signaling pathway by the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1."", 'Further evidence for increased macrophage migration inhibitory factor expression in prostate cancer.', 'Increasing expression of GST-pi MIF, and ID1 genes in chemoresistant prostate cancer cells.', 'The HMG box transcription factor HBP1: a cell cycle inhibitor at the crossroads of cancer signaling pathways.', 'Impact of particulate microplastics generated from polyethylene terephthalate on gut pathology and immune microenvironments.', 'CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'HBP1 inhibits the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus through transcriptional activation of the IGFBP1 gene.', 'Methylation of HBP1 by PRMT1 promotes tumor progression by regulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling.', 'Pathogenic role of microRNAs in atherosclerotic ischemic stroke: Implications for diagnosis and therapy.']"""

Methods:   After lymphadenectomy, 118 patients received photon beam radiotherapy with 66 Gy to the prostate. No adjuvant treatment was performed until biochemical failure. After failure, hormone therapy was administered. Follow-up period was 57 months (mean).  Results:   Biochemical failure occurred in 47 patients. Few failures were observed in patients with low (24%) and intermediate risks (14%). In contrast, 64% of high-risk patients experienced failure, 97% of whom showed until 36 months. Most patients with failure responded well to hormone therapy. After 15 months (mean), a second biochemical failure occurred in 21% of patients who had the first failure, most of them were high risk. Factors involving failure were high initial and nadir prostate-specific antigen, advanced stage, short prostate-specific antigen-doubling time and duration between radiation and first failure. Failure showed an insufficient reduction in prostate-specific antigen after radiotherapy. Factor for second failure was prostate-specific antigen-doubling time at first failure.  Conclusions:   Half of high-risk patients experienced biochemical failure, indicating one of the causes involves factors other than lymph nodes.

IH repair-free survival rates in the biopsy population were 98.3, 97.1, 94.9, and 90.2% at the same four time points. In multivariable Cox regression models, RP predisposed to a 2.3-fold higher risk of IH repair than EBRT (p < 0.001). Besides therapy type, patient age (p < 0.001) represented the only other independent predictor of IH repair.  Conclusions:   RP predisposes to a higher rate of IH repair relative to EBRT.

Methods and materials:   Repeated measures of PSA from 5,093 patients from 6 institutions treated for localized prostate cancer by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) without planned androgen deprivation were analyzed. A biphasic linear mixed model described the post-treatment evolution of PSA, rather than a conventional model of time to biochemical recurrence. The model was adjusted for standard prognostic factors (T stage, initial PSA level, and Gleason score) and cohort-specific effects. The radiation dose fractionation effect was estimated from the long-term rate of rise of PSA level.  Results:   Adjusted for other factors, total dose of EBRT and sum of squared doses per fraction were associated with long-term rate of change of PSA level (p = 0.0017 and p = 0.0003, respectively), an increase of each being associated with a lower rate of rise. The α/β ratio was estimated at 1.55 Gy (95% confidence band, 0.46-4.52 Gy). This estimate was robust to adjustment of the linear mixed model.  Conclusions:   By analysis of a large EBRT-only cohort along with a method that uses all the repeated measures of PSA after the end of treatment, a low and precise α/β was estimated.

Short-term quality-of-life outcomes such as genitourinary side effects, anxiety levels, and global measures of quality of life using validated questionnaires are vital although proof-of-concept trials and retrospective case series have already established lower toxicity from focal therapy in some detail. Defining what outcomes will be measured and what defines a successful focal treatment in the medium and long term is problematic. Measuring long-term efficacy or effectiveness within a randomized trial is somewhat straightforward since hard endpoints are measured such as presence or absence of metastatic disease and/or death. However, owing to the long natural history of localized prostate cancer detected in the modern prostate-specific antigen screening era, with these events usually occurring a minimum of 10 years after therapy makes such a long-term trial large, costly, and probably unfeasible now.

While the extracorporeal approach shows unsatisfactory results, laparoscopic HIFU appears to be a promising alternative treatment option. Problems with respiratory movement and interphases, as seen in extracorporeal HIFU, are avoided when the transducer is brought directly to the target by laparoscopic HIFU.

Candidate selection remains the major challenge of implementing focal therapy in clinical practice. While focal therapy is potentially widely applicable, there is general consensus that initial efforts to initiate focal therapy protocols in practice should be limited to men with disease features that are low to low-intermediate risk, thereby limiting the likelihood of early systemic failure. Selection of candidates is first dependent on the intent of focal therapy. Curative intent focal therapy is limited to a small number of men with isolated, low-risk, unifocal, or unilateral disease. In men for whom local control-and potential prolongation of the natural history of disease-is desired, mapping strategies would focus on identification of the dominant site of disease and ruling out high-risk features. Tools such as conventional transrectal biopsy, transperineal saturation biopsy, and prostate MRI all have relative merits and shortcomings. While ultimately limitation of biopsy is desirable through combinations of transrectal biopsy and imaging, for now, limitations of conventional imaging modalities make it likely that most men will need transperineal saturation biopsy before inclusion in focal therapy protocols.""","""['Samir S Taneja', 'Malcolm Mason']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Evaluating localized prostate cancer and identifying candidates for focal therapy.', 'Focal therapy for localized prostate cancer: a critical appraisal of rationale and modalities.', 'Focal therapy in prostate cancer-report from a consensus panel.', 'Active surveillance for prostate cancer: can we modernize contemporary protocols to improve patient selection and outcomes in the focal therapy era?', 'Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Final Results of a Phase I/II Multicenter Trial of WST11 Vascular Targeted Photodynamic Therapy for Hemi-Ablation of the Prostate in Men with Unilateral Low Risk Prostate Cancer Performed in the United States.', 'Focal therapy for prostate cancer: The current status.', 'Primary Zonal High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Prostate Cancer: Results of a Prospective Phase IIa Feasibility Study.', 'Imaging of prostate cancer: a platform for 3D co-registration of in-vivo MRI ex-vivo MRI and pathology.', 'Prostate focused ultrasound focal therapy--imaging for the future.']"""

This resulted in the reproducible detection of eight differentially expressed peptides, which were then identified by nanoLC-MALDI-TOF/TOF and confirmed by MALDI-FTMS exact mass measurements. All differentially expressed peptides are derived from two homologous parts of human serum albumin; two of the eight peptides were tryptic and six were nontryptic. The presence of the nontryptic fragments indicates that a proteolysis process occurs which is not mediated by trypsin. Since the nontryptic fragments were found at significantly higher levels in control samples compared with metastases samples, it is proposed that a specific proteolytic inhibition process is in effect in the serum of prostate cancer patients.

Furthermore, patients are a vital link between physicians' assessments of patients' needs and actual implementation of appropriate care. Yet no study has specifically examined how and when a representative sample of patients considered, discussed, and made medical decisions.  Objective:   To identify decision prevalence and decision-making processes regarding 1) initiation of prescription medications for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or depression; 2) screening tests for colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer; and 3) surgeries for knee or hip replacement, cataracts, or lower back pain.  Design:   Computer-assisted telephone interview survey.  Setting:   Nationally representative sample of US adults in households with telephones.  Participants:   3010 English-speaking adults age 40 and older identified using a stratified random sample of telephone numbers.

Results:   82.2% of the target population reported making at least 1 medical decision in the preceding 2 years.

In current studies, the recombinant L-methionine alpha,gamma-lyase (rMETase), an L-methionine depleting enzyme cloned from Pseudomonas putida, was shown to have efficacy in a broad series of cancer cell lines. Twenty-one different human tumor cell lines (4 lung, 4 colon, 4 kidney, 4 melanoma, 3 CNS, and 2 prostate) from the NCI Human Tumor Cell Line Screen and 7 human normal cell strains were treated with rMETase in vitro. We showed that rMETase had mean IC(50) (units rMETase/ml) for the following cancer cell types: renal cancer, 0.07; colon cancer, 0.04; lung cancer, 0.12; prostate cancer, 0.01; melanoma, 0.19; and CNS cancer, 0.195, which was approximately one order of magnitude lower than that for normal cell strains: skin fibroblasts, 4; aortic smooth muscle cells, 0.88; aortic endothelial cells, 0.8; keratinocytes, 0.75, and bronchial epithelial cells, 0.75. rMETase was also conjugated with polyethylene lycol (PEG). PEG-rMETase also had high cell-kill activity. In vitro studies, animal studies and clinical trials have now shown that methionine restriction is an effective anticancer strategy.

Lycopene has been hypothesized to be responsible for tomato health benefits.  Objective:   Our aim was to differentiate the effects of tomato matrix from those of lycopene by using lycopene-rich red tomatoes, lycopene-free yellow tomatoes, and purified lycopene.  Design:   Thirty healthy men (aged 50-70 y old) were randomly assigned to 2 groups after a 2-wk washout period. In a crossover design, each group consumed yellow and red tomato paste (200 g/d, which provided 0 and 16 mg lycopene, respectively) as part of their regular diet for 1 wk separated by 2 wk of washout. Then, in a parallel design, the first group underwent supplementation with purified lycopene (16 mg/d) for 1 wk, whereas the second group received a placebo. Sera collected before and after the interventions were incubated with lymph node cancer prostate cells to measure the expression of 45 target genes.  Results:   Circulating lycopene concentration increased only after consumption of red tomato paste and purified lycopene. Lipid profile, antioxidant status, prostate-specific antigen, and insulin-like growth factor I were not modified by consumption of tomato pastes and lycopene. We observed significant up-regulation of IGFBP-3 and Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and down-regulation of cyclin-D1, p53, and Nrf-2 after cell incubation with sera from men who consumed red tomato paste when compared with sera collected after the first washout period, with intermediate values for yellow tomato paste consumption. Cell incubation with sera from men who consumed purified lycopene led to significant up-regulation of IGFBP-3, c-fos, and uPAR compared with sera collected after placebo consumption.

BCA has been reported to have chemopreventive actions against various cancers including prostate, breast, colon cancer, and so on. Sulfotransferases are a family of phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes, which are important for xenobiotic detoxification and regulation of biological signaling molecule biological activities. Sulfotransferase gene expressions are regulated by different hormones and xenobiotics. Improper regulation of sulfotransferases leads to improper functions of biological signaling molecules, which in turn can cause cancer or other diseases. BCA inhibits the enzyme activities of the phase I drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells and induces the phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in human prostate cancer cells. BCA induction of sulfotransferases has not been studied. This investigation evaluates the in vivo regulation of sulfotransferases at protein and mRNA levels in the liver and intestine of Sprague-Dawley rats treated with BCA (0, 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. Our experimental results demonstrate for the first time that chronic BCA treatment can significantly induce the expression of rat sulfotransferase 1A1 (rSULT1A1, AST-IV), sulfotransferase 2A1 (rSULT2A1, STa), and rat estrogen sulfotransferase (rSULT1E1, EST) in rat liver and intestine.

It has been demonstrated that prostate-specific membrane antigen over-expression may be correlated with prostate cancer, particularly in advanced cancer. The aim of the current study was to explore the possibility of prostate-specific membrane antigen as a therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer. To address this problem, lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNA was employed to reduce endogenous prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in prostate cancer cell lines—LNCaP and DU-145. Then, the tumorigenesis, migration ability and invasiveness of prostate-specific membrane antigen-reduced prostate cancer cell lines were also examined. The prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in LNCaP and DU-145 cells was persistently and markedly reduced by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference. Down-regulation of prostate-specific membrane antigen expression significantly suppressed the growth rates of LNCaP and DU-145 cells. Moreover, the specific down-regulation arrested cells in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle. Furthermore, we also observed that the silence of prostate-specific membrane antigen could decrease the migration ability and the invasiveness of LNCaP and DU-145 cells. Our investigation demonstrated that lentivirus-mediated RNA interference silencing targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen might reduce the proliferation, and induce potent antitumor activity of LNCaP and DU-145 cells.

There is, however, a lack of data on the biochemical relapse (BR) outcomes in these patients. Here, we studied the outcome of a contemporary series of men treated by PADT and investigated predictive risk factors for BR.  Methods:   One hundred and fifty-five patients treated by PADT formed the initial study cohort, and BR outcomes in this group were reviewed. The outcomes of men with bone scan negative disease were specifically analysed. The predictive value of a panel of clinical risk factors for BR was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis. The results were further validated in a separate cohort of patients without bone metastasis from a second institution (n = 84).  Results:   Median follow-up was 70 months. In the first study cohort, 109/155 men (70%) had bone scan negative disease. In these patients, only 45% developed BR during the follow-up period with only 28% relapsing within 5 years of initiating PADT. Key-independent factors predicting BR were a high PSA nadir (p = 0.001) and a shorter time to nadir (p < 0.001). A nadir of ≤0.1 ng/ml and time to nadir of >24 months specifically identified men with a very good outcome from PADT. In a second-independent cohort, very similar overall and 5-year BR rates were observed in men without bone metastasis (39 and 35%, respectively). PSA nadir thresholds identified in the first cohort were again able to define a good prognostic group in this re-test cohort (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01, respectively).

Results:   During the study period, a total of 12 stent procedures were carried out in 11 patients with colonic obstruction from extracolonic cancer and were analysed further. These represented 8.5% of a total of 141 stent procedures performed in 130 patients. Fluoroscopic technique was used alone. The median age was 73 years with a range from 47 to 88 years.

Qualitative visual analysis identified pathological spectra in 88.5% of cancer ROI, 11.7% of normal transitional zone ROI and 1.6% of normal peripheral zone ROI. The ratios of normal prostate tissue were significantly more elevated (p<0.0001) in the transition zone (0.41 +/- 0.24) than in the peripheral zone (0.22 +/- 0.36). Tumor containing voxels had significantly higher ratios (2.84 +/- 2.74) than normal tissue containing voxels of the transition zone (p<0.0001) and peripheral zone (p<0.0001).

The mean follow-up period was 56 months.  Results:   Of the 14 patients managed with radiotherapy, 1 patient developed bone metastases and died of prostate cancer, and 1 patient had a biochemical relapse 8 years after definitive radiotherapy. Of the 16 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, 2 patients developed bone metastases, one of who died of disease. Three patients that relapsed after prostatectomy were successfully salvaged with radiotherapy. The patient that was treated with androgen deprivation alone developed bone metastases at 10 months, was treated with chemotherapy, and was alive after 22 months.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that PDA is a cancer with a behavior similar to that of high Gleason grade acinar carcinoma. Good local control can be achieved by either radiation or surgery.

Novel targets for pancreatic cancer therapy are urgently needed. We identified a crosstalk between insulin/IGF-1 receptors and GPCR signaling systems in pancreatic cancer cells, leading to enhanced signaling, DNA synthesis, and proliferation. Crosstalk between these signaling systems depends on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1). Metformin, the most widely used drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, activates AMP kinase (AMPK), which negatively regulates mTORC1. Recent results show that metformin-induced activation of AMPK disrupts crosstalk between insulin/IGF-1 receptor and GPCR signaling in pancreatic cancer cells and inhibits the growth of these cells in xenograft models. Given that insulin/IGF-1 and GPCRs are implicated in other malignancies, a similar crosstalk mechanism may be operative in other cancer cell types. Recent epidemiological studies linked administration of metformin with a reduced risk of pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancer in diabetic patients.

Even when the cancer progresses to a castration-resistant stage, AR signaling remains active via a variety of mechanisms. In the present study, we showed that NF-kappaB/p52 can activate the AR, resulting in increased transactivation of AR-responsive genes, such as PSA and NKX3.1, in a ligand-independent manner. NF-kappaB2/p52 enhances nuclear translocation and activation of AR by interacting with its NH(2)-terminal domain and enhances the recruitment of coactivators such as p300 to the promoters of AR-dependent genes. These results were confirmed in three different prostate cancer cell lines: LAPC-4 (wild-type AR), LNCaP (mutant AR), and C4-2 (castration resistant). Transfection of p52 into LAPC-4 and LNCaP cells (which express low levels of p52) showed increased activation of the endogenous AR. Downregulation of endogenous p52 in C4-2 cells resulted in abrogation of AR constitutive activation. Comparison of the relative effects of p52 and p65 (RelA) showed that p52, but not p65, could activate the AR. Collectively, these findings, together with previous reports that the levels of NF-kappaB2/p52 are elevated in prostate cancer cells and that active NF-kappaB2/p52 promotes prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, suggest that NF-kappaB2/p52 may play a critical role in the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Wei Lou', 'Meng Sun', 'Jun Chen', 'Jiao Yue', 'Hsing-Jien Kung', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Qinghua Zhou', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['NF-κB2/p52 induces resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer: role of androgen receptor and its variants.', 'NF-kappaB2/p52 enhances androgen-independent growth of human LNCaP cells via protection from apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest induced by androgen-deprivation.', 'Identification of a negative regulatory cis-element in the enhancer core region of the prostate-specific antigen promoter: implications for intersection of androgen receptor and nuclear factor-kappaB signalling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Oncogenic activation of androgen receptor.', 'NF-κB signaling promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Metabolism and Response in Prostate Cancer Anti-Androgen Therapy Resistance.', 'Resistance to second generation antiandrogens in prostate cancer: pathways and mechanisms.', 'PARP inhibitors chemopotentiate and synergize with cisplatin to inhibit bladder cancer cell survival and tumor growth.', 'RELA is sufficient to mediate interleukin-1 repression of androgen receptor expression and activity in an LNCaP disease progression model.']"""

Among the molecular signatures associated with chemotherapy, transcripts encoding inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) were significantly upregulated. The patient biochemical relapse status was monitored in a long-term follow-up. Patients with ID1 upregulation were found to be associated with longer relapse-free survival than patients without ID1 increase. This in vivo clinical association was mechanistically investigated. The chemotherapy-induced ID1 upregulation was recapitulated in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Docetaxel dose-dependently induced ID1 transcription, which was mediated by ID1 promoter E-box chromatin modification and c-Myc binding. Stable ID1 overexpression in LNCaP increased cell proliferation, promoted G(1) cell cycle progression, and enhanced docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in cellular mitochondria content, an increase in BCL2 phosphorylation at serine 70, caspase-3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In contrast, ID1 siRNA in the LNCaP and C42B cell lines reduced cell proliferation and decreased docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity by inhibiting cell death. ID1-mediated chemosensitivity enhancement was in part due to ID1 suppression of p21. Overexpression of p21 in LNCaP-ID1-overexpressing cells restored the p21 level and reversed ID1-enhanced chemosensitivity. These molecular data provide a mechanistic rationale for the observed in vivo clinical association between ID1 upregulation and relapse-free survival. Taken together, it shows that ID1 expression has a novel therapeutic role in prostate cancer chemotherapy and prognosis.""","""['Hao Geng', 'Brooks L Rademacher', 'Janet Pittsenbarger', 'Chung-Ying Huang', 'Christopher T Harvey', 'Marie C Lafortune', 'Anne Myrthue', 'Mark Garzotto', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Tomasz M Beer', 'David Z Qian']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Targeting Id1 and Id3 by a specific peptide aptamer induces E-box promoter activity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.', 'CCL2 is induced by chemotherapy and protects prostate cancer cells from docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity.', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation/DNA Binding 1 (ID1) Inhibits Etoposide-induced Apoptosis in a c-Jun/c-Fos-dependent Manner.', 'Infiltrating mast cells increase prostate cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistances via modulation of p38/p53/p21 and ATM signals.', 'Paclitaxel and docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer: Molecular mechanisms and possible therapeutic strategies.', 'HIF1 and ID1 Interplay Confers Adaptive Survival to HIF1α-Inhibition.', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation 1 (Id1) in Cancer and Cancer Therapy.', 'Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1) mediates stemness of colorectal cancer cells through the Id1-c-Myc-PLAC8 axis via the Wnt/β-catenin and Shh signaling pathways.', 'Arginine Starvation and Docetaxel Induce c-Myc-Driven hENT1 Surface Expression to Overcome Gemcitabine Resistance in ASS1-Negative Tumors.', 'ID1-induced p16/IL6 axis activation contributes to the resistant of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to sorafenib.']"""

Methods:   Four cDNA microarrays were constructed using cDNA library of prostatic cancer cells PC-3M-1E8 (high metastatic potential), PC-3M-2B4 (low metastatic potential), lung cancer cells PG-BE1 (high metastatic potential)and PG-LH7 (low metastatic potential)to screen genes which were differentially expressed according to their different metastatic properties. From a battery of differentially expressed genes, PAG1, which was markedly downregulated in both high metastatic sublines of PC-3M and PG was chosen for further investigation. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to confirm the gene expression of PAG1 at mRNA and protein levels. Full-length coding sequence of human PAG1 was subcloned into plasmid pcDNA3.0 and the recombinant plasmids were stably transfected into PC-3M-1E8. The cell proliferation ability, anchorage-independent growth, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis rates and invasive ability were detected by MTT, and in addition, soft agar colony formation, flow cytometry analysis and matrigel invasion assay using Boyden chamber were also carried out respectively. All experiments contained pcDNA3.0-PAG1-transfected clones, vector transfected clones and non-transfected parental cells.  Results:   A total of 327 differentially expressed genes were obtained between the high and low metastatic sublines of PC-3M cells, including 123 upregulated and 204 downregulated genes in PC-3M-1E8. A total of 281 genes, including 167 upregulated and 114 downregulated genes were obtained in PG-BE1 cells. Nine genes were simultaneously downregulated and 8 genes were upregulated in both high metastatic cell lines of PC-3M and PG. The expression of PAG1 at mRNA and protein level were decreased in the high metastatic subline PC-3M-1E8. Western blot revealed that PAG1 protein was downregulated in PC-3M-1E8 cell line which was in agreement with the gene expression at mRNA level. The proliferation ability and clonogenicity of PAG1 overexpression cells by stable transfection were markedly decreased in comparing with that of the control cells (P < 0.05). Colonies formed in stably PAG1-transfected cells, the vector-transfected clones and parental cells were 26.7 ± 5.2, 47.2 ± 3.2 and 52.3 ± 3.4 respectively (P < 0.05). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the stable PAG1-transfected cells at G₀-G₁ phase were significantly more than that of the control cells (P < 0.05). However, no difference of the apoptosis rate was found between PAG1-transfected cells and control cells (P > 0.05). The number of cells passing through the matrigel and multipore membrane was also decreased in the stable PAG1-transfected cells (35.1 ± 4.9) compared with those of the vector-transfected clones (127.6 ± 6.6) and parental cells (135.0 ± 5.0, P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Using cDNA microarray technique and differential gene expression analysis of sublines of the parental cancer cell lines enable of revealing the metastasis-related genes, among which PAG1 represents one of those under-expressed genes in the high metastatic subline PC-3M-1E8. Transfection expression of PAG1 suppresses cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and invasive ability of PC-3M-1E8 cells in vitro. Conclusively, PAG1 may play an important role in inhibiting the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of the cancer cells.""","""['Wen-juan Yu', 'Yue-wei Wang', 'Zhi-gang Xie', 'Jiang-feng You', 'Jie-liang Wang', 'Xiang-lin Cui', 'Fei Pei', 'Jie Zheng']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi""","""['Influence of phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid microdomains 1 on biologic behavior of human prostatic cancer cell line in-vitro.', 'Overexpression of human tumor metastasis-related gene TMSG-1 suppresses cell proliferation and invasion of a highly metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC-3M-1E8 in vitro.', 'Effects of vimentin on invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cell lines PC-3M-1E8 and PC-3M-2B4.', 'Metastasis-related genes in prostate cancer: the role of caveolin-1.', 'An attempt to isolate genes responsible for spontaneous and experimental metastasis in the mouse model.']"""

In this framework, an interesting model is represented by prostate cancer (PC), which is featured by a complex pathophysiology with a strong genetic component. Multiple genes seem to influence PC risk and several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of candidate genes modifying PC susceptibility have been identified. It is noteworthy the potential association of common SNPs in pro-inflammatory genes with PC risk, since chronic inflammation is assumed to play a key role in prostate carcinogenesis. With the aim to identify candidate genes as an experimental basis to develop new strategies for both prevention and treatment of PC, we have investigated the potential role of common SNPs of a gene cluster (TLR4, TLR2, PTGS2 and 5-Lo), involved in innate and inflammatory response, in PC cases, age-matched controls and centenarians from Sicily. Six SNPs were genotyped and their association with PC risk determined. Statistical analysis evidenced a significant association of some pro-inflammatory gene SNPs with an increased risk of PC. Furthermore, significant differences were observed comparing the three groups in the combined presence of a ""high responder"" pro-inflammatory profile. Overall, the present results suggest the likely association of these SNPs and PC risk, clearly motivating the need of larger studies to confirm the role of these genes in PC development and/or progression.""","""['C R Balistreri', 'C Caruso', 'G Carruba', 'V Miceli', 'I Campisi', 'F Listì', 'D Lio', 'G Colonna-Romano', 'G Candore']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Des""","""['Genetic polymorphisms in inflammation pathway genes and prostate cancer risk.', 'Genetic variation in the toll-like receptor gene cluster (TLR10-TLR1-TLR6) and prostate cancer risk.', 'Polymorphisms in genes related to inflammation, NSAID use, and the risk of prostate cancer among Danish men.', 'Prostate cancer: from the pathophysiologic implications of some genetic risk factors to translation in personalized cancer treatments.', 'Hereditary/familial versus sporadic prostate cancer: few indisputable genetic differences and many similar clinicopathological features.', 'Toll-like receptor gene polymorphisms in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.', 'The Role of Polymorphisms in Genes of PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway on Prostate.', 'TLR4 Polymorphisms and Expression in Solid Cancers.', 'Comprehensive assessment of association between TLR4 gene polymorphisms and cancer risk: a systematic meta-analysis.', 'Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) rs20417 polymorphism and prostate cancer risk: a meta analysis.']"""

Previous reports have described hyperthermic ablation using targeted and nontargeted nanoparticles internalized by cancer cells, but most reports do not describe a theoretical analysis for determining optimal parameters. The focus of the current research was first to evaluate the spatiotemporal temperature distribution and cell death induced by extracellular hyperthermia in which gold nanorods (GNRs) were maintained in the dispersion outside human prostate cancer cells. The nanorod dispersion was irradiated with near-infrared (NIR) laser, and the spatiotemporal distribution of temperature was determined experimentally. This information was employed to develop and validate theoretical models of spatiotemporal temperature profiles for gold nanorod dispersions undergoing laser irradiation and the impact of the resulting heat generation on the viability of human prostate cancer cells. A cell injury/death model was then coupled to the heat transfer model to predict spatial and temporal variations in cell death and injury. The model predictions agreed well with experimental measurements of both temperature and cell death profiles. Finally, the model was extended to examine the impact of selective binding of gold nanorods to cancer cells compared to nonmalignant cells, coupled with a small change in cell injury activation energy. The impact of these relatively minor changes results in a dramatic change in the overall cell death rate. Taken together, extracellular hyperthermia using gold nanorods is a promising strategy, and tailoring the cellular binding efficacy of nanorods can result in varying therapeutic efficacies using this approach.""","""['Huang-Chiao Huang', 'Kaushal Rege', 'Jeffrey J Heys']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""ACS Nano""","""['The effects of folate-conjugated gold nanorods in combination with plasmonic photothermal therapy on mouth epidermal carcinoma cells.', 'Gold nanorod embedded reduction responsive block copolymer micelle-triggered drug delivery combined with photothermal ablation for targeted cancer therapy.', 'Synergistic administration of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy to cancer cells using polypeptide-based degradable plasmonic matrices.', 'Zinc phthalocyanines attached to gold nanorods for simultaneous hyperthermic and photodynamic therapies against melanoma in vitro.', 'Quantification of laser local hyperthermia induced by gold plasmonic nanoparticles.', '3D modeling of vector/edge finite element method for multi-ablation technique for large tumor-computational approach.', 'Photothermal Nanoheaters-Modified Spores for Safe and Controllable Antitumor Therapy.', 'Spatiotemporal Temperature Distribution of NIR Irradiated Polypyrrole Nanoparticles and Effects of pH.', 'Nanoparticle-assisted, image-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy for cancer treatment.', 'Gold Nanorod-Assisted Photothermal Therapy and Improvement Strategies.']"""

Gene-expression profiling is widely used to identify genes associated with such progression. Usually candidate genes are identified according to a gene-by-gene comparison of expression. Recent reports suggested that relative expression of a gene pair more efficiently predicts cancer progression than single-gene analysis does. The top-scoring pair (TSP) algorithm classifies phenotypes according to the relative expression of a pair of genes. We applied the TSP approach to predict, which patients would experience systemic tumor progression after radical prostatectomy. Relative expression of TPD52L2/SQLE and CEACAM1/BRCA1 gene pairs identified those patients with more than 99% specificity but relatively low sensitivity (approximately 10%). These two gene pairs were validated in three independent data sets. In addition, combining two pairs of genes improved sensitivity without compromising specificity. Functional annotation of the TSP genes showed that they cluster by a limited number of biological functions and pathways, suggesting that relatively lower expression of genes from specific pathways can predict cancer progression. In conclusion, comparative analysis of the expression of two genes may be a simple and effective classifier for prediction of prostate cancer progression. In summary, the TSP approach can be used to identify patients whose prostate cancer will progress after they undergo radical prostatectomy. Two gene pairs can predict which men would experience progression to the metastatic form of the disease.

The group-randomized trial is the most rigorous experimental design for evaluating multilevel interventions. However, identifying the proper sample size for a group-randomized trial requires reliable estimates of intraclass correlation (ICC) for screening outcomes, which are not available to researchers. We present crude and adjusted ICC estimates for cancer screening outcomes for various levels of aggregation (physician, clinic, and county) and provide an example of how these ICC estimates may be used in the design of a future trial.  Methods:   Investigators working in the area of cancer screening were contacted and asked to provide crude and adjusted ICC estimates using the analysis of variance method estimator.  Results:   Of the 29 investigators identified, estimates were obtained from 10 investigators who had relevant data. ICC estimates were calculated from 13 different studies, with more than half of the studies collecting information on colorectal screening. In the majority of cases, ICC estimates could be adjusted for age, education, and other demographic characteristics, leading to a reduction in the ICC. ICC estimates varied considerably by cancer site and level of aggregation of the groups.  Conclusions:   Previously, only two articles had published ICCs for cancer screening outcomes. We have complied more than 130 crude and adjusted ICC estimates covering breast, cervical, colon, and prostate screening and have detailed them by level of aggregation, screening measure, and study characteristics.

CPA4 was originally found in a screen of mRNAs up-regulated by sodium butyrate-induced differentiation of cancer cells. Further studies suggested a relation between CPA4 and prostate cancer aggressiveness. In the present study, we determined that CPA4 is secreted from cells as a soluble proenzyme (pro-CPA4) that can be activated by endoproteases, such as trypsin. Three complementary approaches were used to study the substrate specificity of CPA4; kinetic analysis was performed using a new series of chromogenic substrates and some biologically relevant peptides, the cleavage of synthetic peptides was tested individually, and the cleavage of a mixture of >100 mouse brain peptides was examined using a quantitative peptidomics mass spectrometry-based approach. CPA4 was able to cleave hydrophobic C-terminal residues with a preference for Phe, Leu, Ile, Met, Tyr, and Val. However, not all peptides with C-terminal hydrophobic residues were cleaved, indicating the importance of additional residues within the peptide. Aliphatic, aromatic, and basic residues in the P1 position have a positive influence on the cleavage specificity. In contrast, acidic residues, Pro, and Gly have a negative influence in the P1 position. Some of the peptides identified as CPA4 substrates (such as neurotensin, granins, and opioid peptides) have been previously shown to function in cell proliferation and differentiation, potentially explaining the link between CPA4 and cancer aggressiveness.

A similar trend was seen in DU-145 (prostate cancer), PANC-1 (pancreatic cancer), and LoVo (colorectal cancer) cells. KG-1 leukemia cells favored C6-SM synthesis at low (0.6muM) and high-dose (12muM) C6-ceramide. Partnering C6-ceramide with tamoxifen, a P-glycoprotein antagonist that impedes ceramide glycosylation, was an effective regimen for enhancing cytotoxicity in cells. Experiments to assess the mechanism of cell death using KG-1 cells showed that tamoxifen inhibited synthesis of C6-GC and C6-SM from C6-ceramide by 80% and 50%, respectively, which was accompanied by enhanced apoptosis. Radiolabeling of KG-1 cells with [(3)H]palmitic acid produced a 2-fold increase in (3)H-long-chain ceramides when unlabeled C6-ceramide was added and a 9-fold increase when C6-ceramide and tamoxifen were added. The increase in (3)H-palmitate radiolabeling of long-chain ceramides was blocked by inclusion of a ceramide synthase inhibitor; however, inhibiting synthesis of long-chain ceramide did not rescue cells. These studies show that tamoxifen enhances the apoptotic effects of C6-ceramide.

Results:   The results demonstrate that both VMAT and HT are capable of providing more uniform target doses and improved normal tissue sparing as compared with fixed field IMRT. In terms of delivery efficiency, VMAT plan deliveries on average took 2.2 min for prostate and lung cases and 4.6 min for head-and-neck cases. These values increased to 4.7 and 7.0 min for HT plans.  Conclusions:   Both VMAT and HT plans can be delivered accurately based on their own QA standards. Overall, VMAT was able to provide approximately a 40% reduction in treatment time while maintaining comparable plan quality to that of HT.""","""['Min Rao', 'Wensha Yang', 'Fan Chen', 'Ke Sheng', 'Jinsong Ye', 'Vivek Mehta', 'David Shepard', 'Daliang Cao']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['SU-E-T-574: Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy for Prostate Radiation: A Dosimetric Comparison between VMAT Techniques and Fixed-Beam IMRT.', 'Comparison of anatomy-based, fluence-based and aperture-based treatment planning approaches for VMAT.', 'Static and rotational intensity modulated techniques for head-neck cancer radiotherapy: a planning comparison.', 'Utilising the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training System to Support Undergraduate Teaching of IMRT, VMAT, DCAT Treatment Planning, and QA Concepts.', 'Knowledge-based planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A review of data-driven approaches.', 'Four-dimensional computed tomography-based ventilation imaging in intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning for pulmonary functional avoidance.', 'Sub-arc collimator angle optimization based on the conformity index heatmap for VMAT planning of multiple brain metastases SRS treatments.', 'To Optimize Radiotherapeutic Plans for Superior Tumor Coverage Predicts Malignant Glioma Prognosis and Normal Tissue Complication Probability.', 'Cost and Toxicity Comparisons of Two IMRT Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Micro-Costing Study and Weighted Propensity Score Analysis Based on a Prospective Study.', 'Comparison of Absolute Dose Achievable Between Helical Tomotherapy and RapidArc in Total Dura Mater Irradiation for Child Cancer.']"""

The purpose of this study is to develop a novel, fast, and accurate segmentation and registration method to increase the computational efficiency to meet the restricted clinical treatment time requirement in image guided radiotherapy.  Methods:   The method developed in this study used soft tissues to capture the transformation between the 3D planning CT (pCT) images and 3D cone-beam CT (CBCT) treatment images. The method incorporated a global-to-local deformable mesh model based registration framework as well as an automatic anatomy-constrained robust active shape model (ACRASM) based segmentation algorithm in the 3D CBCT images. The global registration was based on the mutual information method, and the local registration was to minimize the Euclidian distance of the corresponding nodal points from the global transformation of deformable mesh models, which implicitly used the information of the segmented target volume. The method was applied on six data sets of prostate cancer patients. Target volumes delineated by the same radiation oncologist on the pCT and CBCT were chosen as the benchmarks and were compared to the segmented and registered results. The distance-based and the volume-based estimators were used to quantitatively evaluate the results of segmentation and registration.  Results:   The ACRASM segmentation algorithm was compared to the original active shape mode (ASM) algorithm by evaluating the values of the distance-based estimators. With respect to the corresponding benchmarks, the mean distance ranged from -0.85 to 0.84 mm for ACRASM and from -1.44 to 1.17 mm for ASM. The mean absolute distance ranged from 1.77 to 3.07 mm for ACRASM and from 2.45 to 6.54 mm for ASM. The volume overlap ratio ranged from 79% to 91% for ACRASM and from 44% to 80% for ASM. These data demonstrated that the segmentation results of ACRASM were in better agreement with the corresponding benchmarks than those of ASM. The developed registration algorithm was quantitatively evaluated by comparing the registered target volumes from the pCT to the benchmarks on the CBCT. The mean distance and the root mean square error ranged from 0.38 to 2.2 mm and from 0.45 to 2.36 mm, respectively, between the CBCT images and the registered pCT. The mean overlap ratio of the prostate volumes ranged from 85.2% to 95% after registration. The average time of the ACRASM-based segmentation was under 1 min. The average time of the global transformation was from 2 to 4 min on two 3D volumes and the average time of the local transformation was from 20 to 34 s on two deformable superquadrics mesh models.  Conclusions:   A novel and fast segmentation and deformable registration method was developed to capture the transformation between the planning and treatment images for external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancers. This method increases the computational efficiency and may provide foundation to achieve real time adaptive radiotherapy.""","""['Jinghao Zhou', 'Sung Kim', 'Salma Jabbour', 'Sharad Goyal', 'Bruce Haffty', 'Ting Chen', 'Lydia Levinson', 'Dimitris Metaxas', 'Ning J Yue']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Object-constrained meshless deformable algorithm for high speed 3D nonrigid registration between CT and CBCT.', '3D meshless prostate segmentation and registration in image guided radiotherapy.', 'Quantitative evaluation of a cone-beam computed tomography-planning computed tomography deformable image registration method for adaptive radiation therapy.', 'A review of segmentation and deformable registration methods applied to adaptive cervical cancer radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Surface deformation analysis of collapsed lungs using model-based shape matching.', 'Performance evaluation of a newly developed three-dimensional model-based global-to-local registration in prostate cancer.', 'A magnetic resonance spectroscopy driven initialization scheme for active shape model based prostate segmentation.']"""

In this study, the authors calculate the radiation dose to the patient, the spouse/caretaker, and the medical staff that would result from a 100 microCi Ir192 radioactive fiducial marker permanently implanted in the prostate of a radiation therapy patient.  Methods:   Local tissue dose was calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. The patient's whole body effective dose equivalent was calculated by summing the doses to the sensitive organs. Exposure of the spouse/caretaker was calculated from the NRC guidelines. Exposure of the medical staff was based on estimates of proximity to and time spent with the patient.  Results:   The local dose is below 40 Gy at 5 mm from the marker and below 10 Gy at 10 mm from the marker. The whole body effective dose equivalent to the patient is 64 mSv. The dose to the spouse/caretaker is 0.25 mSv. The annual exposures of the medical staff are 0.2 mSv for a doctor performing implantations and 0.34 mSv for a radiation therapist positioning patients for therapy.  Conclusions:   The local dose is not expected to have any clinically significant effect on the surrounding tissue which is irradiated during therapy. The dose to the patient is small in comparison to the whole body dose received from the therapy itself. The exposure of all other people is well below the recommended limits.

Snail, a master regulator of EMT, has been recently proposed to act additionally as a cell survival factor and inducer of motility. We have investigated the function of Snail (SNAI1) in prostate cancer cells by downregulating its expression via short (21-mer) interfering RNA (siRNA) and measuring the consequences on EMT markers, cell viability, death, cell cycle, senescence, attachment, and invasivity. Of eight carcinoma cell lines, the prostate carcinoma cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 showed the highest and moderate expression of SNAI1 mRNA, respectively, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Long-term knockdown of Snail induced a severe decline in cell numbers in LNCaP and PC-3 and caspase activity was accordingly enhanced in both cell lines. In addition, suppression of Snail expression induced senescence in LNCaP cells. SNAI1-siRNA-treated cells did not tolerate detachment from the extracellular matrix, probably due to downregulation of integrin α6. Expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin was also affected. Invasiveness of PC-3 cells was not significantly diminished by Snail knockdown. Our data suggest that Snail acts primarily as a survival factor and inhibitor of cellular senescence in prostate cancer cell lines. We therefore propose that Snail can act as early driver of prostate cancer progression.""","""['Modjtaba Emadi Baygi', 'Zahra Soheila Soheili', 'Ingo Schmitz', 'Shahram Sameie', 'Wolfgang A Schulz']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cell Biol Toxicol""","""['Inhibition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in metastatic prostate cancer cells by the novel proteasome inhibitor, NPI-0052: pivotal roles of Snail repression and RKIP induction.', 'Opposite regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasiveness by periostin between prostate and bladder cancer cells.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic Regulation and Post-Translational Modifications of SNAI1 in Cancer Metastasis.', 'The Immunohistochemical Expression of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Markers in Precancerous Lesions and Cervical Cancer.', 'Novel cellular senescence-related risk model identified as the prognostic biomarkers for lung squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Royal Jelly and trans-10-Hydroxy-2-Decenoic Acid Inhibit Migration and Invasion of Colorectal Carcinoma Cells.', 'CD44 In Sarcomas: A Comprehensive Review and Future Perspectives.', 'Is There an Interconnection between Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Telomere Shortening in Aging?']"""

There are currently no clear recommendations for the use of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT in metastatic bone disease. Given its limited availability there is a need to identify the clinical indications for which SPECT/CT is clearly beneficial in influencing patient care and outcome.  Methods:   Forty-two patients with equivocal lesions on planar scintigraphy were recruited and underwent SPECT/CT imaging. On reading of SPECT alone and then SPECT/CT, lesions were classified as malignant, benign or equivocal. Follow-up clinical information, radiological studies and/or bone scans were used as a gold standard. SPECT and SPECT/CT were compared in terms of the number of equivocal findings and accuracy on a patient-wise and lesion-wise basis.  Results:   Forty-two patients with 189 skeletal lesions were examined. There was a diverse variety of primary tumours, with the majority being breast (n=22) and prostate cancer (n=8). SPECT/CT resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of patients (48-14%, P=0.0015) and lesions (31-9%, P<0.0001) with equivocal findings. The overall accuracy of SPECT/CT was significantly higher on both a patient-wise (52-79%, P=0.0026) and lesion-wise basis (67-92%, P<0.0001).

We aimed to characterize nutrition status, to analyze associations between nutritional and clinical/cancer-related variables, and to quantify the relative weights of nutritional and cancer-related features.  Methods:   The cross-sectional study included 450 nonselected cancer patients (ages 18-95 years) at referral for radiotherapy. Nutritional status assessment included recent weight changes, body mass index (BMI) categorized by World Health Organization's age/sex criteria, and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA; validated/specific for oncology).  Results:   BMI identified 63% as >or=25 kg/m(2) (43% overweight, 20% obese) and 4% as undernourished. PG-SGA identified 29% as undernourished and 71% as well nourished. Crossing both methods, among the 319 (71%) well-nourished patients according to PG-SGA, 75% were overweight/obese and only 25% were well nourished according to BMI. Concordance between BMI and PG-SGA was evaluated and consistency was confirmed. More aggressive/advanced stage cancers were more prevalent in deficient and excessive nutritional status: in 83% (n = 235/282) of overweight/obese patients by BMI and in 85% (n = 111/131) of undernourished patients by PG-SGA. Results required adjustment for diagnoses: greater histological aggressiveness was found in overweight/obese prostate and breast cancer; undernutrition was associated with aggressive lung, colorectal, head-neck, stomach, and esophageal cancers (p < .005). Estimates of effect size revealed that overweight/obesity was associated with advanced stage (24%), aggressive breast (10%), and prostate (9%) cancers, whereas undernutrition was associated with more aggressive lung (6%), colorectal (6%), and head-neck (6%) cancers; in both instances, age and longer disease duration were of significance.

Among them, CCND1 was the most significantly differentially expressed gene. Analysis of testicular germ cell tumor clinical samples by quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed that overall expression of CCND1 was significantly higher in resistant cases compared with sensitive samples (P < 0.0001). We also found that CCND1 was dramatically overexpressed both in induced and intrinsically resistant samples of ovarian and prostate cancer. Finally combined CCND1 knockdown using small-interfering RNA and cisplatin treatment inhibited cell growth in vitro significantly more effectively than any of these single treatments. Therefore, deregulation of CCND1 may be a major cause of cisplatin resistance in testicular germ cell tumors and may also be implicated in ovarian and prostate cancers.

Aberrant IGF-IR signaling is implicated in several types of tumors, including carcinomas of the lung, breast, prostate, pancreas, liver, and colon. However, the contribution of the IGF-IR to the development of the transformed phenotype in urothelial cells has not been clearly established. In this study we demonstrated that the IGF-IR is overexpressed in invasive bladder cancer tissues compared with nonmalignant controls. We have investigated the role of the IGF-IR in bladder cancer by using urothelial carcinoma-derived 5637 and T24 cells. Although activation of the IGF-IR did not appreciably affect their growth, it did promote migration and stimulate in vitro wound closure and invasion. These effects required the activation of the Akt and Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways as well as IGF-I-induced Akt- and MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of paxillin, which relocated at dynamic focal adhesions and was necessary for promoting motility in bladder cancer cells. Our results provide the first evidence for a role of the IGF-IR in motility and invasion of bladder cancer cells and support the hypothesis that the IGF-IR may play a critical role in the establishment of the invasive phenotype in urothelial neoplasia.

The mechanisms by which NKX3.1 exercises tumor suppression have not been well elucidated. Here, we show that NKX3.1 affects DNA damage response and cell survival after DNA damage. NKX3.1 expression in PC-3 prostate cancer cells enhances colony formation after DNA damage but has minimal effect on apoptosis. NKX3.1 also diminishes and regulates total cellular accumulation of gammaH2AX. Endogenous NKX3.1 in LNCaP cells localizes to sites of DNA damage where it affects the recruitment of phosphorylated ATM and the phosphorylation of H2AX. Knockdown of NKX3.1 in LNCaP cells attenuates the acute responses of both ATM and H2AX phosphorylation to DNA damage and their subnuclear localization to DNA damage sites. NKX3.1 expression enhances activation of ATM as assayed by autophosphorylation at serine 1981 and activation of ATR as assayed by phosphorylation of CHK1. An inherited mutation of NKX3.1 that predisposes to early prostate cancer and attenuates in vitro DNA binding was devoid of the ability to activate ATM and to colocalize with gammaH2AX at foci of DNA damage.

We investigated the risk of thromboembolic disease in men with prostate cancer who were receiving endocrine treatment, curative treatment, or surveillance.  Methods:   We analysed data from PCBaSe Sweden, a database based on the National Prostate Cancer Register, which covers over 96% of prostate cancer cases in Sweden. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) of deep-venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, and arterial embolism were calculated by comparing observed and expected (using the total Swedish male population) occurrences of thromboembolic disease, taking into account age, calendar-time, number of thromboembolic diseases, and time since previous thromboembolic disease.  Findings:   Between Jan 1, 1997, and Dec 31, 2007, 30 642 men received primary endocrine therapy, 26 432 curative treatment, and 19 526 surveillance. 1881 developed a thromboembolic disease. For men on endocrine therapy, risks for DVT (SIR 2.48, 95% CI 2.25-2.73) and pulmonary embolism (1.95, 1.81-2.15) were increased, although this was not the case for arterial embolism (1.00, 0.82-1.20). Similar patterns were seen for men who received curative treatment (DVT: 1.73, 1.47-2.01; pulmonary embolism: 2.03, 1.79-2.30; arterial embolism: 0.95, 0.69-1.27) and men who were on surveillance (DVT: 1.27, 1.08-1.47; pulmonary embolism: 1.57, 1.38-1.78; arterial embolism: 1.08, 0.87-1.33). Increased risks for thromboembolic disease were maintained when patients were stratified by age and tumour stage.  Interpretation:   All men with prostate cancer were at higher risk of thromboembolic diseases, with the highest risk for those on endocrine therapy. Our results indicate that prostate cancer itself, prostate cancer treatments, and selection mechanisms all contribute to increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Thromboembolic disease should be a concern when managing patients with prostate cancer.

So far, studies of Glut-1 in cancer have utilized conventional immunohistochemical analysis in a series of individual biopsy or surgical specimens.

To evaluate hypoxia markers, tissue cores must show the architectural features of hypoxia; i.e. viable tissue surrounding necrotic regions. Glut-1 may be a useful biomarker to validate tissue microarrays for use in studies of hypoxia-regulated genes in cancer. In this study, we carried out immunohistochemical detection of Glut-1 protein in many tumor and normal tissue types in a range of tissue microarrays. Glut-1 was frequently found in peri-necrotic regions, occurring in 9/34 lymphomas, 6/12 melanomas, and 5/16 glioblastomas; and in 43/54 lung, 22/84 colon, and 23/60 ovarian tumors. Expression was rare in breast (6/40) and prostate (1/57) tumors, and in normal tissue, was restricted to spleen, tongue, and CNS endothelium.

We used a Cox proportional hazards model to determine the significant predictors of PSA progression.  Results:   Of the men with low-risk prostate cancer, 85% had organ-confined disease, only 2% had seminal vesicle invasion, and no patient had lymph node metastasis.

Methods:   Forty males, aged >60 years, ASA I-III patients scheduled for elective transurethral resection were included in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. Following a spinal tap, intrathecal injection in Group L (n=20), 2.5 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and in Group LF (n=20), 2.2 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine with fentanyl 15 microg (0.3 mL) was performed.

Methods:   Patients with prostate cancer in Geneva, Switzerland, were retrospectively analysed regarding incidental diagnosis of synchronous second primary malignancies, including a cohort of 398 patients treated from 1991 through 2001 with radical radiotherapy (RT) and a second cohort of 419 patients treated from 1991 through 2001 by radical prostatectomy (RP) in order to analyse the differences between RT and RP patients. Both cohorts were evaluated regarding incidence of synchronous second primary cancers, compared with that expected in the general population (Standardized Incidence Ratio, SIR). The influence of staging workup on the diagnosis of incidental primary malignancies was studied.  Results:   Six synchronous cancers (4 renal, 1 pancreatic, 1 rectal) were observed on abdomino-pelvic CT-scan among 480 patients (398 RT patients and 82 RP patients) (1.2%), who had been subjected to staging workup. For renal-cell carcinomas (RCC) in 398 RT patients (RCC) SIR was 18.19 (CI [Confidence Interval] 4.96-46.57), (p <0.001).

Design:   Telephone Survey  Participants:   A total of 1,237 participants aged 50 and older who reported having made one or more cancer screening decisions in the past 2 years completed 1,454 cancer screening modules for breast, prostate and colorectal screening.  Main results:   Of all module respondents, 9.8% reported plans to stop screening, 12.6% for breast, 6.0 % for prostate and 9.5% for colon cancer. We found no statistically significant differences in plans to stop for those ages >or=70 (8.2%) compared to those ages 50 to 69 (10.2%) (p = 0.14.)

In particular, increased levels of IGFBP-2 expression are associated with advanced PCa, bone metastasis, and the development of castrate resistant PCa. Previously, we reported that androgen treatment decreased intracellular and extracellular IGFBP-2 in the androgen sensitive (AS) PCa cell line, LNCaP. Nonetheless, the mechanism by which androgen treatment decreases expression of IGFBP-2 is not clear. Since elevated IGFBP-2 is associated with a variety of advanced cancers, including PCa, coupled with the fact that hormone ablation is the customary treatment modality for advanced PCa, a complete understanding of the influence of androgens on IGFBP-2 expression is essential. Androgen treatment initially increased steady state IGFBP-2 mRNA levels in LNCaP cells. Extended androgen treatment on LNCaP resulted in a time-dependent decrease in both steady state IGFBP-2 mRNA and protein. Polysomal mRNA analysis showed no difference in IGFBP-2 association with a given fraction; however, Q-PCR revealed less IGFBP-2 mRNA in each androgen-treated fraction. In addition, there was an overall decrease in polysome mRNA after androgen treatment. Extracellular proteolysis of IGFBP-2 was prevented in the presence of serine protease inhibitors.

One approach to reduce disease heterogeneity is to stratify families on the basis of the occurrence of multiple cancer types. This method may increase the power for detecting susceptibility loci, including those with pleiotropic effects. We have completed a genome-wide SNP linkage analysis of 96 HPC families, each of which has one or more first-degree relatives with colon cancer (CCa), and further analyzed the subset of families with two or more CCa cases (n = 27). When only a prostate cancer (PCa) phenotype was considered to be affected, we observed suggestive evidence for linkage (LOD ≥1.86) at 15q14, 18q21 and 19q13 in all families, and at 1p32 and 15q11-q14 in families with two or more CCa cases.

The strongest linkage signal was identified at 15q14 when both PCa and CCa phenotypes were considered to be affected in families with two or more CCa cases (recessive HLOD = 3.88). These results provide further support for the presence of HPC susceptibility loci on chromosomes 11q14, 15q11-q14 and 19q13 and highlight loci at 1q31, 11q, 15q11-14 and 18q21 as having possible pleiotropic effects.

Recent studies have reported that ROHs, possibly through exposing recessive disease-causing alleles or alternative mechanisms, are associated with an increased cancer risk.

Six common ROHs were associated with breast cancer risk and four with prostate cancer (P<0.01).

Although none of the ROHs remained significantly associated with cancer risk after adjustment for multiple testing, a number of ROHs merit further interrogation.

We recently identified a novel interaction between HIF-1alpha and the mammalian septin family member, septin 9 protein, isoform 1 (SEPT9_i1), a protein product of septin 9 transcript variant 1 (SEPT9_v1). Septins are a highly conserved family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins that are implicated in multiple cellular functions, including oncogenesis. SEPT9_i1 binds and stabilizes HIF-1alpha protein and stimulates HIF-1 transcriptional activity by preventing its RACK1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. SEPT9_i1-HIF-1 activation promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis. The effect of SEPT9_v1 silencing in prostate cancer cells was studied. SEPT9_v1 stable knockdown was generated in PC-3 cells using a specific shRNA. SEPT9_v1 silencing reduced HIF-1alpha protein expression and inhibited HIF-1 transcriptional activity.

The mechanisms and association of chimeric transcripts arising from chromosomal rearrangements with cancer are well established, but much remains unknown regarding the biogenesis and importance of other chimeric transcripts that arise from nongenomic alterations. Recently, a SLC45A3-ELK4 chimera has been shown to be androgen-regulated, and is overexpressed in metastatic or high-grade prostate tumors relative to local prostate cancers. Here, we characterize the expression of a KLK4 cis sense-antisense chimeric transcript, and show other examples in prostate cancer. Using non-protein-coding microarray analyses, we initially identified an androgen-regulated antisense transcript within the 3' untranslated region of the KLK4 gene in LNCaP cells. The KLK4 cis-NAT was validated by strand-specific linker-mediated RT-PCR and Northern blotting. Characterization of the KLK4 cis-NAT by 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) revealed that this transcript forms multiple fusions with the KLK4 sense transcript. Lack of KLK4 antisense promoter activity using reporter assays suggests that these transcripts are unlikely to arise from a trans-splicing mechanism. 5' RACE and analyses of deep sequencing data from LNCaP cells treated +/-androgens revealed six high-confidence sense-antisense chimeras of which three were supported by the cDNA databases.

Here, we report that Ad.mda-7-induced ER stress and ceramide production trigger autophagy in human prostate cancer cells, but not in normal prostate epithelial cells, through a canonical signaling pathway that involves Beclin-1, atg5, and hVps34. Autophagy occurs in cancer cells at early times after Ad.mda-7 infection, but a switch to apoptosis occurs by 48 hours after infection. Inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenosine increases Ad.mda-7-induced apoptosis, suggesting that autophagy may be initiated first as a cytoprotective mechanism. Inhibiting apoptosis by overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL increased autophagy after Ad.mda-7 infection. During the apoptotic phase, the MDA-7/IL-24 protein physically interacted with Beclin-1 in a manner that could inhibit Beclin-1 function culminating in apoptosis. Conversely, Ad.mda-7 infection elicited calpain-mediated cleavage of the autophagic protein ATG5 in a manner that could facilitate switch to apoptosis.

Methods:   In the third stage of genome-wide association studies, we genotyped 106 JAZF1 SNPs in 10,286 PrCa cases and 9,135 controls of European ancestry.

Results:   Of 1,167 older men, 132 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 57 had PSA>or=3 ng/mL at baseline; 495 of 4,260 younger men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 116 had PSA>or=3 ng/mL at baseline. The median lead time was slightly longer in the younger men (12.8 versus 11.8 years). In both cohorts, wide variation in lead times followed an approximately normal distribution.

The goal of this study was to determine the effect of increasing urologist density on local prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer mortality.  Patients and methods:   Using county-level data from the Area Resource File, US Census, National Cancer Institute, and Centers for Disease Control, regression models were built for prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer mortality, controlling for categorized urologist density, county demographics, socioeconomic factors, and preexisting health care infrastructure.  Results:   For each of the three cancers, there was a statistically significant cancer-specific mortality reduction associated with counties that had more than zero urologists (16% to 22% reduction for prostate cancer, 17% to 20% reduction for bladder cancer, and 8% to 14% reduction for kidney cancer with increasing urologist density) relative to zero urologists. However, increasing density greater than two urologists per 100,000 people had no statistically significant impact on mortality for any of the tumors studied.  Conclusion:   The presence of a urologist is associated with lower mortality for urologic cancers in that county, but increasing urologist density does not yield further improvements.

In this report, we showed that miR-148a expression levels were lower in PC3 and DU145 hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells in comparison to PrEC normal human prostate epithelial cells and LNCaP hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Transfection with miR-148a precursor inhibited cell growth, and cell migration and invasion, and increased the sensitivity to anti-cancer drug paclitaxel in PC3 cells. Computer-aided algorithms predicted mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase, MSK1, as a potential target of miR-148a. Indeed, miR-148a overexpression decreased expression of MSK1. Using luciferase reporter assays, we identified MSK1 as a direct target of miR-148a. Suppression of MSK1 expression by siRNA, however, showed little or no effects on malignant phenotypes of PC3 cells. In PC3PR cells, a paclitaxel-resistant cell line established from PC3 cells, miR-148a inhibited cell growth, and cell migration and invasion, and also attenuated the resistance to paclitaxel. MiR-148a reduced MSK1 expression by directly targeting its 3'-UTR in PC3PR cells.

Most untreated prostate cancers retain some dependence upon the AR and respond, at least transiently, to androgen ablation therapy. However, the relationship between endogenous androgen levels and cancer etiology is unclear. High levels of androgens have traditionally been viewed as driving abnormal proliferation leading to cancer, but it has also been suggested that low levels of androgen could induce selective pressure for abnormal cells. We formulate a mathematical model of androgen regulated prostate growth to study the effects of abnormal androgen levels on selection for pre-malignant phenotypes in early prostate cancer development.  Results:   We find that cell turnover rate increases with decreasing androgen levels, which may increase the rate of mutation and malignant evolution. We model the evolution of a heterogeneous prostate cell population using a continuous state-transition model. Using this model we study selection for AR expression under different androgen levels and find that low androgen environments, caused either by low serum testosterone or by reduced 5alpha-reductase activity, select more strongly for elevated AR expression than do normal environments. High androgen actually slightly reduces selective pressure for AR upregulation. Moreover, our results suggest that an aberrant androgen environment may delay progression to a malignant phenotype, but result in a more dangerous cancer should one arise.  Conclusions:   The model represents a useful initial framework for understanding the role of androgens in prostate cancer etiology, and it suggests that low androgen levels can increase selection for phenotypes resistant to hormonal therapy that may also be more aggressive. Moreover, clinical treatment with 5alpha-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride may increase the incidence of therapy resistant cancers.""","""['Steffen E Eikenberry', 'John D Nagy', 'Yang Kuang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biol Direct""","""['Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'Regulation of FGF8 expression by the androgen receptor in human prostate cancer.', '5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol supports human prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation through androgen receptor-independent signaling pathways: implication of androgen-independent prostate cancer progression.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Key targets of hormonal treatment of prostate cancer.

It has efficacious effects against tumors directly, is active against tumor-induced angiogenesis, inhibits neointima formation after arterial injury, and controls inflammatory responses. The off-target effects of Dz13 may in fact be driving some of these potentially therapeutic effects, though no mechanisms have been clearly defined in target cells. To this end, we here show that when a panel of human tumor cells that naturally propagate in bone are challenged with Dz13, the tumor suppressor E2F1 is upregulated regardless of cellular p53 status. The piddosomal components, p53-induced protein with a death domain and caspase-2, were translocated to the nucleus when deoxyribozymes were incubated with cells, but RIP associated Ich-1/CED homologous protein with death domain levels increased throughout the cell with either Dz13 or its scrambled control oligonucleotide. In response to Dz13-mediated cytotoxicity, cells upregulated levels of ERK, Akt, and p38.

VCaP, LNCaP and LAPC4 cells were acclimated to 1 nM testosterone for five generations before subjecting them to a reduced level of 0.03 nM testosterone. Changes in gene expression were quantified using qRT-PCR. Analyses of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and the Δ4, Δ5 and backdoor steroidogenic pathways were carried out. VCaP cells showed no change in the transcriptome of cholesterol biosynthesis. However, several receptors for cholesterol transport were upregulated. The Δ4 and Δ5 steroidogenic pathways, but not the backdoor pathway, were stimulated. Additionally, androgen receptor (AR) expression was increased. Taken together, the above changes might allow recovery of AR activity to a near normal level. In contrast, LNCaP cells showed only minimal adjustment in the transcriptome of steroidogenesis. LAPC4 cells were equally unresponsive to boosting the machinery of androgen production. In brief, our results suggest that the VCaP model is an appropriate model for further investigation of targeting the androgen-AR axis to block the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Jinrong Cheng', 'Yue Wu', 'James L Mohler', 'Clement Ip']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Androgen synthesis and steroid transporters in prostate cancer: rethinking the transition to CRPC.', 'Intratumoral conversion of adrenal androgen precursors drives androgen receptor-activated cell growth in prostate cancer more potently than de novo steroidogenesis.', 'Extragonadal Steroids Contribute Significantly to Androgen Receptor Activity and Development of Castration Resistance in Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Primary Therapy.', 'Androgen synthesis and steroid transporters in prostate cancer: rethinking the transition to CRPC.', 'Partners in crime: deregulation of AR activity and androgen synthesis in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen synthesis in prostate cancer: do all roads lead to Rome?', 'Bone Metastases and Health in Prostate Cancer: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Implications.', 'The role of cholesterol and cholesterol-driven membrane raft domains in prostate cancer.', 'Low Testosterone Alters the Activity of Mouse Prostate Stem Cells.', 'Roles for the backdoor pathway of androgen metabolism in prostate cancer response to castration and drug treatment.', 'The direct inhibitory effect of dutasteride or finasteride on androgen receptor activity is cell line specific.']"""

Red-Br-nos-triggered release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and attenuation of ROS by tiron, a ROS scavenger, reduced the sub-G(1) population suggesting ROS-dependent apoptosis. Abrogation of ROS also reduced autophagy indicating that ROS triggers autophagy. Pharmacological and genetic approaches to inhibit autophagy uncovered the protective role of Red-Br-nos-induced autophagy in PC-3 cells. Direct effects of the drug on mitochondria viz. disruption of normal cristae architecture and dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential revealed a functional link between ROS generation, autophagy, and apoptosis induction.

We compared the apoptotic effects of whole soy extracts and individual soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, on prostate cancer cells. The soy extract contained 50% w/w of total isoflavones with approximately 1:5.5:3.5 ratios of genistin, daidzin and glycitin, respectively. Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH-1), LnCap and PC3 cells were treated with varying concentrations of soy extract, genistein or daidzein and analyzed for cell cycle alterations and induction of apoptosis. At equal concentrations (25 micromol/L), soy extract induced a significantly higher percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis than genistein or daidzein (P < 0.001). No significant changes in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis were observed in non-cancerous BPH-1 cells treated with soy extract, suggesting that the effects of soy extract may be tumor cell specific. On the contrary, both genistein and daidzein induced apoptosis in BPH-1 cells, suggesting that individual isoflavones may have cytotoxicity in non-cancerous cells. Soy extracts also increased Bax expression in PC3 cells, but no significant changes in nuclear factor kappaB (NF kappaB) activation were detected, suggesting that the induction of apoptosis was independent of the NF kappaB pathway.

The current paper describes the prevalence of pain, fatigue, insomnia, and mood disturbance, alone and in combination in elderly cancer patients, as well as the inter-correlations among these four symptoms, and the relationship of the symptom cluster to functional status and quality of life (QoL) during cancer therapy.  Patients and methods:   This cross-sectional study used secondary data from a convenience sample of 120 patients, 65 years of age and older, with colorectal, lung, head/neck, breast, gynecological, prostate or esophageal cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Measuring instruments included the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), the respective items from the Chinese version of the Symptom Distress Scale (SDS-C), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G [C]). The influence of the symptom cluster on patients' functional status and QoL was determined by hierarchical multiple regression.  Results:   Twenty percent and 29.2% of patients reported co-occurrence of any two and any three symptoms of pain, fatigue, insomnia, and mood disturbance, respectively. About one-third of patients (31.2%) reported co-occurrence of all of the four symptoms. The inter-correlations among pain, fatigue, insomnia, and mood disturbance were mild to moderate (r=0.29-0.43, p<0.01). In terms of functional status, the KPS showed a moderate negative correlation with the four symptoms (r=-0.29 to -0.55, p<0.01). Correlations between the FACT-G (C) subscale/total scores and symptom cluster showed moderate negative correlations (r=-0.23 to -0.55, p<0.01). About 8.7-52.9% of variance in functional status and QoL is explained by the symptom cluster of pain, fatigue, insomnia, and mood disturbance in elderly cancer patients receiving cancer therapy after adjustment for gender, age, co-morbidity, stage of disease, and treatment modality.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that pain, fatigue, insomnia, and mood disturbance are highly prevalent in elderly patients who undergone cancer therapy.

Treatment approaches to prostate cancer are based on various mechanisms that cause malignant cell apoptosis. Of these strategies the anticancer effect of triggering death receptors is well substantiated.  Materials and methods:   Several pharmacological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the apoptotic signaling pathways of the natural dihydrochalcone cryptocaryone in prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Cryptocaryone induced antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in human androgen independent prostate cancer cells. It induced caspase-8 and 3 activation but did not change total protein levels of death receptors and their ligands. DR5 surface expression was moderately increased by cryptocaryone. Confocal immunofluorescence examination showed that cryptocaryone induced Fas clustering and the association of downstream signaling molecules, including FADD and procaspase-8. DR4 and DR5 aggregation was also induced by cryptocaryone. Data were confirmed by protein profile analysis of detergent resistant membranes showing that Fas, DR4, DR5, FADD and procaspase-8 levels were increased 1.3, 3.5, 4.1, 13.1 and 4.1-fold, respectively, in the lipid raft compartment. Cryptocaryone mediated clustering of death receptors and associated molecules was also detected in nonraft compartments. The distribution between lipid raft and nonraft compartments was validated by the cholesterol depleting agent methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Cryptocaryone significantly potentiated FasL induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells.  Conclusions:   We suggest that cryptocaryone has anticancer activity via the stimulation of death receptor and associated molecule clustering, leading to caspase-8 and 3 activation, and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Yi-Cheng Chen', 'Fan-Lu Kung', 'Ian-Lih Tsai', 'Tsung-Hsien Chou', 'Ih-Sheng Chen', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Pretreatment with paclitaxel enhances apo-2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by inducing death receptors 4 and 5 protein levels.', 'Sensitivity of prostate cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis increases with tumor progression: DR5 and caspase 8 are key players.', 'A novel dietary triterpene Lupeol induces fas-mediated apoptotic death of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model.', 'Lipid rafts and Fas/CD95 signaling in cancer chemotherapy.', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'Comprehensive Review of Recent Advances in Chiral A-Ring Flavonoid Containing Compounds: Structure, Bioactivities, and Synthesis.', 'Combined Treatment with Cryptocaryone and Ultraviolet C Promotes Antiproliferation and Apoptosis of Oral Cancer Cells.', 'Cryptocaryone Promotes ROS-Dependent Antiproliferation and Apoptosis in Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Regulation of Death Receptor Signaling by S-Palmitoylation and Detergent-Resistant Membrane Micro Domains-Greasing the Gears of Extrinsic Cell Death Induction, Survival, and Inflammation.']"""

Our objective was to determine whether differences in outcomes explained by hospital structural characteristics are mitigated by differences in patient severity.  Methods:   Using hospital administrative and cancer registry records in Pennsylvania, we identified 24,618 adults hospitalized for cancer-related operations. Colorectal, prostate, endometrial, ovarian, head and neck, lung, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers were studied. Outcome measures were 30-day mortality and failure to rescue (FTR) (30-day mortality preceded by a complication). After severity of illness adjustment, we estimated logistic regression models to predict the likelihood of both outcomes. In addition to American Hospital Association survey data, we externally verified hospitals with National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer center or Commission on Cancer (COC) cancer program status.  Results:   Patients in hospitals with NCI cancer centers were significantly younger and less acutely ill on admission (P < .001). Patients in high volume hospitals were younger, had lower admission acuity, yet had more advanced cancer (P < .001). Unadjusted 30-day mortality rates were lower in NCI-designated hospitals (3.76% vs 2.17%;P = .01). Risk-adjusted FTR rates were significantly lower in NCI-designated hospitals (4.86% vs 3.51%;P = .03).

Whereas individual DEFB CNs have been suggested as independent genetic risk factors for several diseases (e.g. psoriasis and Crohn's disease), the role of multisite sequence variations (MSV) is less well understood and to date has only been reported for prostate cancer. Simultaneous assessment of MSVs and CNs can be achieved by PCR, cloning and Sanger sequencing, however, these methods are labour and cost intensive as well as prone to methodological bias introduced by bacterial cloning. Here, we demonstrate that amplicon sequencing of pooled individual PCR products by the 454 technology allows in-depth determination of MSV haplotypes and estimation of DEFB CNs in parallel.  Results:   Six PCR products spread over approximately 87 kb of DEFB and harbouring 24 known MSVs were amplified from 11 DNA samples, pooled and sequenced on a Roche 454 GS FLX sequencer. From approximately 142,000 reads, approximately 120,000 haplotype calls (HC) were inferred that identified 22 haplotypes ranging from 2 to 7 per amplicon. In addition to the 24 known MSVs, two additional sequence variations were detected. Minimal CNs were estimated from the ratio of HCs and compared to absolute CNs determined by alternative methods. Concordance in CNs was found for 7 samples, the CNs differed by one in 2 samples and the estimated minimal CN was half of the absolute in one sample. For 7 samples and 2 amplicons, the 454 haplotyping results were compared to those by cloning/Sanger sequencing. Intrinsic problems related to chimera formation during PCR and differences between haplotyping by 454 and cloning/Sanger sequencing are discussed.  Conclusion:   Deep amplicon sequencing using the 454 technology yield thousands of HCs per amplicon for an affordable price and may represent an effective method for parallel haplotyping and CN estimation in small to medium-sized cohorts.

We examined the association of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with four treatment options: radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and watchful waiting. Diagnostic and treatment information was abstracted from medical records. Socioeconomic measures were derived from the 2000 Census based on the patient's residence at time of diagnosis. Vital status through December 31, 2002, was obtained from medical records and linkages to state vital statistics files and the National Death Index. Multiple logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards models identified factors associated with initial treatment and overall survival, respectively.  Results:   Patients with clinically localized prostate cancer received the following treatments: radical prostatectomy (39.7%), radiation therapy (31.4%), hormone therapy (10.3%), or watchful waiting (18.6%). After multivariable adjustment, the following variables were associated with conservative treatment (hormone therapy or watchful waiting): older age, black race, being unmarried, having public insurance, having non-screen detected cancer, having normal digital rectal exam results, PSA values above 20, low Gleason score (2-4), comorbidity, and state of residence. Among patients receiving definitive treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy), older age, being unmarried, PSA values above 10, unknown Gleason score, state of residence, as well as black race in patients under 60 years of age, were associated with receipt of radiation therapy. Overall survival was related to younger age, being married, Gleason score under 8, radical prostatectomy, and state of residence. Comorbidity was only associated with risk of death within the first three years of diagnosis.  Conclusions:   In the absence of clear-cut evidence favoring one treatment modality over another, it is important to understand the factors that inform treatment selection. Since state of residence was a significant predictor of both treatment as well as overall survival, true regional differences probably exist in how physicians and patients select treatment options. Factors affecting treatment choice and treatment effectiveness need to be further explored in future population-based studies.""","""['Maria J Schymura', 'Amy R Kahn', 'Robert R German', 'Mei-Chin Hsieh', 'Rosemary D Cress', 'Jack L Finch', 'John P Fulton', 'Tiefu Shen', 'Erik Stuckart']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Initial treatment patterns for clinically localized prostate cancer and factors associated with the treatment in Louisiana.', 'Trends and black/white differences in treatment for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.', 'Impact of travel distance to the treatment facility on overall mortality in US patients with prostate cancer.', 'Systematic review: comparative effectiveness and harms of treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Explainable ML models for a deeper insight on treatment decision for localized prostate cancer.', 'A Mutated Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) Peptide-Based Vaccine Induces PAP-Specific CD8+ T Cells with Ex Vivo Cytotoxic Capacities in HHDII/DR1 Transgenic Mice.', 'Survival and prognostic determinants of prostate cancer patients in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: A retrospective cohort study.', 'Neuroendocrine Differentiation of Prostate Cancer-An Intriguing Example of Tumor Evolution at Play.', 'The role of radiotherapy in metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

We sought to describe patterns of male FI, assess treatment outcome and compare some aspects of FI between men and women, including quality of life.  Method:   Prospectively recorded data on 85 consecutive male patients evaluated for FI at our pelvic floor centre in 2004 and 2005 were reviewed and compared with a cohort of 408 female patients. Treatment outcome in men was assessed by questionnaire.  Results:   The aetiology of FI could be determined in 61 (72%) men and was most commonly related to anal surgery (n = 23), prostate cancer therapy (n = 9) and spinal injury (n = 9). Eight patients had idiopathic soiling only. Mean age, Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) and quality of life scores were similar between men and women. Maximal mean resting pressure (MRP) and squeeze pressure (MSP) were on average higher in men than in women [MRP 56.9 (26.2) vs 40 (20.4) mmHg; P < 0.0001]; [MSP 98.1 (67.3) vs 39.4 (28.5) mmHg; P < 0.0001]. Sphincter defects involved the external sphincter less often in men (35 vs 70%, P = 0.004). Differences in faecal incontinence quality of life (FIQL) and SF-36 scores between men and women were minimal. After a median follow up of 2 years, complete resolution of symptoms was reported in 17% and improvement of symptoms in another 48% of men.  Conclusion:   Although physiological and anatomical features of FI differ between men and women, its severity and impact on quality of life are similar. External sphincter defects are less common in men; hence, direct sphincter repair is less frequently an option. Evaluation and treatment improves symptoms in more than half of male patients.""","""['D Christoforidis', 'L Bordeianou', 'T H Rockwood', 'A C Lowry', 'S Parker', 'A F Mellgren']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Colorectal Dis""","""['Does the magnetic anal sphincter device compare favourably with sacral nerve stimulation in the management of faecal incontinence?', 'Faecal incontinence in men referred for specialty care: a cross-sectional study.', 'Sphincter defects are not associated with long-term incontinence following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.', 'The SECCA procedure: a new therapy for treatment of fecal incontinence.', 'Fecal incontinence.

Of the components of apoptosis machinery, caspases are the main executioners of apoptosis that initiate and propagate the apoptosis, and finally degrade target molecules. Caspase-encoding genes have been reported to harbor inactivating mutations in many human cancers. However, mutational status of caspase genes in prostate carcinomas has not been identified. The aim of this study was to explore whether caspase genes are somatically mutated in prostate carcinomas. For this, we analyzed entire coding regions of 11 human caspase-encoding genes (CASP1-10 and 14) in 45 prostate carcinoma tissues by a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay. In this study, however, we detected no somatic mutation of CASP genes in the prostate carcinomas by the SSCP. This is the first report on systematic evaluation of caspase-encoding gene mutations in human prostate carcinomas, and our data indicate that CASP genes may not be mutated in prostate carcinomas.

A mature miRNA directs a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to its target messenger RNA, and causes inhibition of gene transcription. Ago proteins and TNRC proteins are main components of the RISC and participate in miRNA-induced gene silencing. However, expression status of Ago and TNRC proteins has not yet been studied in human cancer tissues. In this study, we attempted to explore whether expressions of Ago2 and TNRC6A are altered in prostate carcinomas (PCA) and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). We analyzed the expression of Ago2 and TNRC6A in 107 PCA and 58 ESCC tissues by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray (TMA) method. In the prostate, Ago2 was not expressed in normal glandular cells, while it was expressed in 50.0% of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and 57.0% of the PCA. TNRC6A was not expressed in normal prostate cells, while it was expressed in 55.0% of the PIN and 63.6% of the PCA in cytoplasm and nucleus. In the esophagus, neither Ago2 nor TNRC6A was expressed in normal squamous cells, while Ago2 and TNRC6A were expressed in 58.6% and 62.1% of the ESCC, respectively. However, neither the expression of Ago2 or TNRC6A was associated with pathologic characteristics of the cancers, including age, sex, Gleason score (PCA) and stage. The increased expressions of Ago2 and TNRC6A in both PCA and ESCC compared with their normal cells suggested that over-expression of these proteins may be related to miRNA functions and might play a role in tumorigenesis of PCA and ESCC.""","""['Nam Jin Yoo', 'Soo Young Hur', 'Min Sung Kim', 'Ji Youl Lee', 'Sug Hyung Lee']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""APMIS""","""['Somatic mutations and losses of expression of microRNA regulation-related genes AGO2 and TNRC6A in gastric and colorectal cancers.', 'Control of the localization and function of a miRNA silencing component TNRC6A by Argonaute protein.', 'NF-kappaB signalling proteins p50/p105, p52/p100, RelA, and IKKepsilon are over-expressed in oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas.', 'Human TNRC6A is an Argonaute-navigator protein for microRNA-mediated gene silencing in the nucleus.', 'Expression levels of the microRNA maturing microprocessor complex component DGCR8 and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) components argonaute-1, argonaute-2, PACT, TARBP1, and TARBP2 in epithelial skin cancer.', 'LncRNAs and CircRNAs in cancer.', 'AGO1 enhances the proliferation and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma via the EMT-associated TGF-β signaling pathway.', 'From the Argonauts Mythological Sailors to the Argonautes RNA-Silencing Navigators: Their Emerging Roles in Human-Cell Pathologies.', 'Circular RNA circAGO2 drives cancer progression through facilitating HuR-repressed functions of AGO2-miRNA complexes.', 'Characterization of selective exosomal microRNA expression profile derived from laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma detected by next generation sequencing.']"""

Gluconasturtiin, one of the predominant glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables, is hydrolyzed to yield phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC). PEITC absorption and metabolism in humans involves glutathione conjugation followed by conversion via the mercapturic acid pathway to an N-acetylcysteine (NAC) conjugate that is excreted in the urine. We observed an inhibitory effect of PEITC and its metabolite, NAC-PEITC, on cancer cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and apoptosis in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. PEITC and NAC-PEITC suppressed LNCaP cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, and exposure to 5 microM PEITC or NAC-PEITC reduced cell proliferation by 25% and 30%, respectively. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that cells treated with 5 microM PEITC or NAC-PEITC arrested at the G(2)/M phase. In addition, the percentage of cells in the S phase decreased from 46% to 25% following 48 h of incubation with PEITC or NAC-PEITC. The G(2)/M-phase cell-cycle arrest of LNCaP cells grown in the presence of PEITC or NAC-PEITC is correlated with the downregulation of Cdk1 and cyclin B(1) protein expression. Apoptosis was observed at the later stages of 24-h and 48-h treatments with 5 microM PEITC and NAC-PEITC.

Methods:   AI interviewers from the communities administered the core and optional modules of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to 404 AI adults randomly selected from housing lists from four AI tribal communities located on the northern plains of the U.S. The BRFSS interview assessed several health functioning areas including medical conditions, preventive screenings, and behavioral risks. We measured health disparities by comparing the AI sample data with a northern plains statewide (North Dakota) sample and a U.S. national sample. We compared outcomes with BRFSS statewide (North Dakota) and U.S. national data from telephone-based interviews.  Results:   AI participants showed a significantly greater prevalence of diabetes, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, smoking, obesity, and heavy alcohol use than either the regional or national samples. They also reported being less likely to engage in leisure-time physical activity and to have had age-appropriate preventive screenings for several diseases including colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease.  Conclusions:   Face-to-face interviews conducted by AI community members are an effective means of gathering health information about AIs living in rural, reservation communities. AIs living in these communities on the northern plains have a much higher prevalence of many health-risk behaviors and some medical conditions than are found in the general population.

Although this model accurately predicts the result of biopsy in unscreened men, its properties for men with a history of PSA screening have not been fully characterized.  Experimental design:   A total of 1,501 previously screened men with elevated PSA underwent initial biopsy during rounds 2 and 3 of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam, with 388 cancers diagnosed. Biomarker levels were measured in serum samples taken before biopsy. The prediction model developed on the unscreened cohort was then applied and predictions compared with biopsy outcome.  Results:   The previously developed four-kallikrein prediction model had much higher predictive accuracy than PSA and age alone (area under the curve of 0.711 versus 0.585, and 0.713 versus 0.557 with and without digital rectal exam, respectively; both P < 0.001). Similar statistically significant enhancements were seen for high-grade cancer. Applying the model with a cutoff of 20% cancer risk as the criterion for biopsy would reduce the biopsy rate by 362 for every 1,000 men with elevated PSA. Although diagnosis would be delayed for 47 cancers, these would be predominately low-stage and low-grade (83% Gleason 6 T(1c)).

Patients and methods:   Relevant baseline factors (T stage, Gleason score, initial PSA) were available for 4338 men. Cox models were used to estimate the effects of dose and OT corrected for baseline factors, treatment year, institution and interactions, and differences in post-treatment PSA-measurement intervals. After exclusion of very short and long intervals, patient numbers were 1445 events/3426 at risk (endpoint all BFs), and 1177 events/3354 at risk (endpoint exclusion of BFs that were likely distant failures). Separate analyses were carried out by risk group for men who received <70 Gy and > or = 70 Gy.  Results:   Neither dose nor OT was significant when the analysis was restricted to doses <70 Gy, while for patients treated to 70 Gy or higher there were significant influences of both dose and OT on outcome in low- and intermediate-risk patients.

Thus, apoptosis induction is acknowledged as a mechanistic underpinning for 4HPR's cancer preventive and therapeutic effects. Apoptosis induction by 4HPR is routinely preceded by and dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in transformed cells. Very little evidence exists, outside the possible involvement of the mitochondrial electron transport chain or the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase complex, that would pinpoint the predominant site of 4HPR-induced ROS production in transformed cells. Here, we investigated the role of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH; an enzyme associated with the mitochondrial electron transport chain and required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis) in 4HPR-induced ROS production and attendant apoptosis in transformed skin and prostate epithelial cells. In premalignant prostate epithelial cells and malignant cutaneous keratinocytes the suppression of DHODH activity by the chemical inhibitor teriflunomide or the reduction in DHODH protein expression by RNA interference markedly reduced 4HPR-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. Conversely, colon carcinoma cells that lacked DHODH expression were markedly resistant to the pro-oxidant and cytotoxic effects of 4HPR. Together, these results strongly implicate DHODH in 4HPR-induced ROS production and apoptosis.""","""['Numsen Hail Jr', 'Ping Chen', 'Jadwiga J Kepa', 'Lane R Bushman', 'Colin Shearn']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['The hydroxyl functional group of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide mediates cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in premalignant and malignant human epithelial cells.', 'Selective apoptosis induction by the cancer chemopreventive agent N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide is achieved by modulating mitochondrial bioenergetics in premalignant and malignant human prostate epithelial cells.', 'Implication of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species, cytochrome C and caspase-3 in N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide-induced apoptosis in cervical carcinoma cells.', 'Efficacy and safety of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors ""leflunomide"" and ""teriflunomide"" in Covid-19: A narrative review.', 'Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in oxidative phosphorylation and cancer.', 'Mitochondrion-Mediated Cell Death through Erk1-Alox5 Independent of Caspase-9 Signaling.', 'Expanding the Repertoire of Low-Molecular-Weight Pentafluorosulfanyl-Substituted Scaffolds.', 'Synthetic Retinoids as Potential Therapeutics in Prostate Cancer-An Update of the Last Decade of Research: A Review.', 'Teriflunomide - The common drug with underestimated oxygen - Dependent anticancer potential.', 'The Mitochondria-Independent Cytotoxic Effect of Leflunomide on RPMI-8226 Multiple Myeloma Cell Line.']"""

Few data are available on the role of positive surgical margins in prostate cancer specific mortality. Using a large, population based national cancer registry we evaluated the risk of prostate cancer specific mortality associated with margin status.  Materials and methods:   The SEER cancer registry data for patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2006 were used to identify men undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Margin status, pathological stage, Gleason grade and postoperative radiation therapy were recorded along with demographic data. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of prostate cancer specific mortality associated with positive surgical margins.  Results:   A total of 65,633 patients comprised the cohort in which 291 (0.44%) prostate cancer specific deaths occurred during an average followup of 50 months. Positive surgical margins were reported in 21.2% of cases and were more common in pT3a than pT2 tumors (44% vs 18%, p <0.001) and higher grade tumors (28% vs 18%, p <0.001). The 7-year disease specific survival rates for those at highest risk for prostate cancer specific mortality (higher grade pT3a) were 97.6% for cases with negative surgical margins and 92.4% for those with positive surgical margins. Positive surgical margins were associated with a 2.6-fold increased unadjusted risk of prostate cancer specific mortality (HR 2.55, 95% CI 2.02-3.21). Positive surgical margins remained an independent predictor of prostate cancer specific mortality on multivariate analysis (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.32-2.18).

Materials and methods:   Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer received weekly docetaxel for 3 of every 4 weeks plus daily ketoconazole. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed on day 1 (docetaxel alone) and day 16 (after ketoconazole).  Results:   The study enrolled 42 patients at 9 different dose levels.

Decreases in prostate specific antigen of 50% or greater were seen in 62% of patients. Of 25 patients with soft tissue disease 7 (28%) had a partial response. Median overall survival was 22.8 months and was significantly greater in docetaxel naïve patients than in patients pretreated with docetaxel (36.8 vs 10.3 months, p = 0.0001). The most frequently observed adverse events were anemia, edema, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, sensory neuropathy and elevated liver function tests.

By the FRAX algorithm with clinical information (no dual energy x-ray absorptiometry data) the 3% hip fracture risk threshold for treatment was exceeded by 51.2% of the men (median risk 3.1%). When subjects were grouped by age the treatment threshold was reached by 3.3% of those younger than 70 years, 76.6% of those 70 to 79 years old and by 98.8% of those 80 years old or older. Using FRAX with bone mineral density data in the 93 patients who underwent bone mineral density testing the median 10-year hip fracture risk was 0.9% and the treatment threshold was exceeded by 15% of these subjects.  Conclusions:   In this cohort of men receiving androgen deprivation therapy the prevalence of risk sufficient to necessitate drug therapy was high and was strongly influenced by age. The WHO/FRAX algorithm identifies a greater proportion of men for treatment than the traditional threshold of T score -2.5 or less.""","""['Philip J Saylor', 'Donald S Kaufman', 'M Dror Michaelson', 'Richard J Lee', 'Matthew R Smith']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Osteoporosis, androgen levels and urological care.', 'Bone health management in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Comparison of fracture risk assessment tool score to bone mineral density for estimating fracture risk in patients with advanced prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Treatment thresholds for osteoporosis in men on androgen deprivation therapy: T-score versus FRAX.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: new concepts and concerns.', 'The diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in men on androgen deprivation therapy for advanced carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Improving bone health in prostate cancer patients starting androgen deprivation therapy: does Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) enhance stratification and targeted management?', 'Prediction of vertebral fractures in cancer patients undergoing hormone deprivation therapies: Reliability of who fracture risk assessment tool (frax) and bone mineral density in real-life clinical practice.', 'A prospective longitudinal study to evaluate bone health, implication of FRAX tool and impact on quality of life (FACT-P) in advanced prostate cancer patients.', 'Bone health management in the continuum of prostate cancer disease: a review of the evidence with an expert panel opinion.', 'Implications of the Fracture Risk Assessment Algorithm for the assessment and improvement of bone health in patients with prostate cancer: A comprehensive review.']"""

This study examined the prevalence rates of, and factors associated with, receipt of a total skin examination by a dermatologist or other doctor during the past year.  Methods:   The participants were 10,486 white men and women aged 50 years and older drawn from a random sample of 31,428 adults aged 18 years and older who took part in the 2005 National Health Interview Survey.

Results:   Sixteen percent of men and 13% of women reported having a skin examination in the past year. The factors associated with lowest skin examination rates in multivariable analyses included younger age (50-64 years), lower education level, lack of screening for colorectal, breast (women only), and prostate cancers (men only), and lack of a personal history of skin cancer.  Conclusions:   Rates of having a skin examination in the past year were low among men and women and among all sub-groups.

It also induces tumour cell apoptosis, and has no agonist activity. Because growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer is dependent on continued androgen-receptor signalling, we assessed the antitumour activity and safety of MDV3100 in men with this disease.  Methods:   This phase 1-2 study was undertaken in five US centres in 140 patients. Patients with progressive, metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were enrolled in dose-escalation cohorts of three to six patients and given an oral daily starting dose of MDV3100 30 mg. The final daily doses studied were 30 mg (n=3), 60 mg (27), 150 mg (28), 240 mg (29), 360 mg (28), 480 mg (22), and 600 mg (3). The primary objective was to identify the safety and tolerability profile of MDV3100 and to establish the maximum tolerated dose. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00510718.  Findings:   We noted antitumour effects at all doses, including decreases in serum prostate-specific antigen of 50% or more in 78 (56%) patients, responses in soft tissue in 13 (22%) of 59 patients, stabilised bone disease in 61 (56%) of 109 patients, and conversion from unfavourable to favourable circulating tumour cell counts in 25 (49%) of the 51 patients. PET imaging of 22 patients to assess androgen-receptor blockade showed decreased (18)F-fluoro-5alpha-dihydrotestosterone binding at doses from 60 mg to 480 mg per day (range 20-100%). The median time to progression was 47 weeks (95% CI 34-not reached) for radiological progression. The maximum tolerated dose for sustained treatment (>28 days) was 240 mg. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was dose-dependent fatigue (16 [11%] patients), which generally resolved after dose reduction.  Interpretation:   We recorded encouraging antitumour activity with MDV3100 in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. The results of this phase 1-2 trial validate in man preclinical studies implicating sustained androgen-receptor signalling as a driver in this disease.

Two algorithms that overcome the dimensionality problem are presented: the forest classification tree (FCT) and the forest support vector machines (FSVM). In FCT, a set of variables is randomly chosen and a classification tree (CT) is grown using a forward classification algorithm. The process is repeated and a forest of CTs is derived. Finally, the most frequent variables from the trees with the smallest apparent misclassification rate (AMR) are used to construct a productive tree. In FSVM, the CTs are replaced by SVMs. The methods are demonstrated using prostate gene expression data for classifying tissue samples into four tumor types. For threshold split value 0.001 and utilizing 100 markers the productive CT consisted of 29 terminal nodes and achieved perfect classification (AMR=0). When the threshold value was set to 0.01, a tree with 17 terminal nodes was constructed based on 15 markers (AMR=7%). In FSVM, reducing the fraction of the forest that was used to construct the best classifier from the top 80% to the top 20% reduced the misclassification to 25% (when using 200 markers).

Classically, at this point an umbilical tape or Penrose drain substitutes the short tractor. Because of the limitation in the amount of traction that can be applied without fracturing through the tissue, we have utilized traction sutures placed in both right and left lobes of the prostate instead of the Penrose drain.  Results:   Traction on these sutures resulted in excellent exposure and greatly facilitated the posterior dissection of the prostate as well as seminal vesicles dissection.

Possible patient factors may include marketing, increased Internet usage by patients, and patient-to-patient communication. We surveyed urologists from the central United States to determine possible surgeon factors for the popularity of the RARP.  Materials and methods:   We mailed a survey to all urologists in the South Central Section of the American Urological Association. After demographic information was obtained, participants were asked to choose an operation for themselves based on two prostate cancer scenarios; low risk and high risk.  Results:   For the low risk prostate cancer scenario, 54.3% chose RARP while 32.9% chose a radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP). In the high risk scenario, 32.3% chose a RARP while 58.8% chose the RRP. The top reasons for choosing robotics included decreased blood loss, better pain control, and visualization of the apex. The most popular reasons for an open operation included improved lymph node dissection, better tactile sensation, and easier operation for the surgeon. The two most important factors for choosing a particular operation were cancer control and the urologist performing the operation. Also, urologists favored the operative choice in which he or she performed.

Results and limitations:   Most (59%) of the 156 respondents worked in large (> 20 bed) units, and 76% said urologists always performed the biopsies. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy was the preferred procedure for 78% of respondents.

To date, the main way to obtain END and ENL is chemical synthesis, which is expensive and inevitably leads to environmental pollution. To explore a more economic and eco-friendly production method, we explored biotransformation of enterolignans from precursors contained in defatted flaxseeds by human intestinal bacteria.  Results:   We cultured fecal specimens from healthy young adults in media containing defatted flaxseeds and detected END from the culture supernatant. Following selection through successive subcultures of the fecal microbiota with defatted flaxseeds as the only carbon source, we obtained a bacterial consortium, designated as END-49, which contained the smallest number of bacterial types still capable of metabolizing defatted flaxseeds to produce END. Based on analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis, END-49 was found to consist of five genomically distinct bacterial lineages, designated Group I-V, with Group I strains dominating the culture. None of the individual Group I-V strains produced END, demonstrating that the biotransformation of substrates in defatted flaxseeds into END is a joint work by different members of the END-49 bacterial consortium. Interestingly, Group I strains produced secoisolariciresinol, an important intermediate of END production; 16S rRNA analysis of one Group I strain established its close relatedness with Klebsiella. Genomic analysis is under way to identify all members in END-49 involved in the biotransformation and the actual pathway leading to END-production.

Methods:   A total of 21 patients with bone metastases and HRPC were randomized to receive MK-0429 200 mg b.i.d. or 1600 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks. Toxicity, pharmacokinetics and markers of bone turnover and tumor activity were examined.  Results:   Nausea was the most common adverse event: one (200-mg group) and 11 (1600-mg group) patients. At 4 weeks, mean AUC(0-12 h) was 210 mmol*h (200-mg group) and 673 mmol*h (1600-mg group); mean C(max) values were 42 mmol/L (200-mg group) and 154 mmol/L (1600-mg group).

The proximity between prostate (target) and rectum (organ at risk) often leads to a compromise between dose to target and organ at risk.  Material and methods:   The present study describes a method where the distance between prostate and rectum is increased by retraction of the rectum in dorsal direction. Comparative treatment plans with and without retraction of the rectum in the same patients have been studied. Nine patients with biopsy proven, localised adenocarcinoma of the prostate were studied. A cylindrical rod of Perspex was inserted into the rectum. This device allows the rectum to be retracted posteriorly. The patients were given a proton boost of 20 Gy in four fractions of 5 Gy in addition to a conventional photon beam treatment to a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2 Gy.  Results:   Comparative treatment planning shows that the treatment plan with rectal retraction significantly reduces (p<0.01) the volume of the rectal wall receiving high doses (equal to 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions) in all patients.

Results:   The measured overlap of the two delineated volumes divided by the maximum possible overlap, was below 50% for the sigmoid in six of 17 patients, for the distal 4 cm of the sigmoid in five of 17 patients, for the rectum in none of 17 patients, for the anal sphincter in three of 17 patients and for the urinary bladder in none of 17 patients. The smaller volume divided by the larger volume was below 50% in three of 17 patients for the sigmoid, in six of 17 patients for the 4 distal cm of the sigmoid, in two of 17 patients for the rectum, in two of 17 patients for the anal sphincter and in seven of 17 patients for the urinary bladder. For the urinary bladder the largest deviation was found cranially, 4.0 cm (SD 2.0 cm), the caudal part being relatively fixed. For the rectum the largest deviation was found in the anterior wall, 1.8 cm (SD 0.7 cm), with maximum documented variation in cranial direction of 3.2 cm (SD 1.8 cm).  Conclusions:   The sigmoid varies considerably in documented position with the largest deviation anteriorly, the urinary bladder change in volume with the extension mainly located cranially and for the rectum the anterior wall is the most mobile with the distension becoming more pronounced cranially.

I will in this article summarize what we currently know about PSA testing. I discuss the closely related issues of the natural history of early-stage disease and the risks and benefits of radical local treatment. I propose that the mortality reduction following PSA screening is probably modest, whilst substantial harms are well documented. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that the PSA test is profoundly limited for screening purposes. I therefore concur with the growing number of health and professional agencies - notably outside the US - that advise against population screening with PSA. Through PSA screening the medical community has generated a pseudo-epidemic of over-diagnosed non-lethal prostate cancer. Molecular tools to distinguish innocent, over-diagnosed prostate cancer from lethal tumors that deserving curative treatment are necessary to improve screening test performance.

Samples consisting of isolated single biological cells are particularly unsuited to such analysis since cells are strong scatterers of infrared radiation. Thus measured spectra consist of an absorption component often highly distorted by scattering effects. It is now known that the predominant contribution to the scattering is Resonant Mie Scattering (RMieS) and recently we have shown that this can be corrected for, using an iterative algorithm based on Extended Multiplicative Signal Correction (EMSC) and a Mie approximation formula. Here we present an iterative algorithm that applies full Mie scattering theory. In order to avoid noise accumulation in the iterative algorithm a curve-fitting step is implemented on the new reference spectrum. The new algorithm increases the computational time when run on an equivalent processor. Therefore parallel processing by a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) was employed to reduce computation time.

The results were compared with tumour stage, tumour grade and follow-up data. Although nuclear grading could easily be performed on the TMA spots, no correlation was found with tumour stage, grade or PSA recurrence after prostatectomy. However, Gleason grading, even when performed on the small TMA spots, provided significant prognostic information. Correlation with Gleason scores determined in the complete prostatectomy specimens showed moderate agreement in low-grade (score ≤ 6) or intermediate (score = 7) tumours, but poor agreement with high-grade (score ≥ 8) tumours.

Purpose:   In this secondary analysis of a national trial testing a psychological intervention for prostate cancer patients, we report on the traumatic stress symptoms of African American and non-African American men.  Methods:   This analysis includes 317 men (African American: n = 30, 9%; non-African American: n = 287, 91%) who were enrolled in the intervention trial, which included 12 weeks of group psychotherapy and 24 months of follow-up. Using mixed model analysis, total score on the Impact of Events Scale (IES) and its Intrusion and Avoidance subscales were examined to determine mean differences in traumatic stress across all time points (0, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months). In an additional analysis, relevant psychosocial, demographic, and clinical variables were added to the model.  Results:   Results showed significantly higher levels of traumatic stress for African American men compared to non-African American men in all models independently of the intervention arm, demographics, and relevant clinical variables. African Americans also had a consistently higher prevalence of clinically significant traumatic stress symptoms (defined as IES total score ≥ 27).

Methods:   To prove this hypothesis, we have performed a prospective study on tumor and control specimens from 39 CRC patients, which were immunostained for NCAM and PSA (polysialic acid) expression.  Results:   Tumor versus control expression of NCAM and PSA epitopes in tissue specimens, as well as correlation between tumor expression and clinicopathological features, were statistically analyzed. Results showed a low constitutive expression of NCAM and PSA (PSA-NCAM) in control tissue, which reached a statistically significant increase in the tumor tissue. Likewise, the presence and number of lymph node metastases at surgery were correlated with NCAM expression and PSA/NCAM coexpression.  Conclusions:   These data highlight the importance of taking into account PSA-associated epitopes when dealing with NCAM cell expression studies in tumor development and progression.

Materials and methods:   Twenty-four patients (median age, 63 years; age range, 44-72 years) gave informed consent to be examined for this research ethics board-approved study. Before undergoing prostatectomy, patients were examined with T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, T2 mapping, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging at 1.5 T. Maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2, volume transfer constant (K(trans)), and extravascular extracellular space (v(e)) were calculated. Whole-mount hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections were generated and digitized at histologic resolution. Percentage areas of tissue components (nuclei, cytoplasm, stroma, luminal space) were measured by using image segmentation. Corresponding regions on MR images and histologic specimens were defined by using anatomically defined segments in peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland tissue. Cancer and normal PZ regions were identified at histopathologic analysis. Each MR parameter-histologic tissue component pair was assessed by using linear mixed-effects models, and cancer versus normal PZ values were compared by using nonparametric tests.  Results:   ADC and T2 were inversely related to percentage area of nuclei and percentage area of cytoplasm and positively related to percentage area of luminal space (P < or = .01). These trends were reversed for K(trans) (P < .001). K(trans) had a significantly negative (P = .01) slope versus percentage area of stroma, and v(e) had a positive (P = .008) slope versus percentage area of stroma. The v(e) was inversely proportional to the percentage area of nuclei (P = .05). All MR imaging parameters (P < or = .05) and the percentage areas of all tissue components (P < or = .001) except stroma (P > .48) were significantly different between cancer and normal PZ tissue.  Conclusion:   MR imaging-derived parameters measured in the prostate were significantly related to the proportion of specific histologic components that differ between normal and malignant PZ tissue.

Socioeconomic status according to fifths of small area deprivation index.  Results:   Over the nine years of the study, information on stage at diagnosis was available for 15 916 of 27 970 patients (57%).

Both treatments were more commonly used in least deprived compared with most deprived patients (28.5% v 21.0% for radiotherapy and 8.4% v 4.0% for surgery). In multivariable analysis, increasing deprivation remained strongly associated with lower odds of radiotherapy or surgery (odds ratio 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 0.94), P<0.001, and 0.91 (0.87 to 0.94), P<0.001, respectively, per incremental deprivation group). There were consistently concordant findings with multilevel models for clustering of observations by hospital of diagnosis, with restriction of the analysis to patients with information on stage, and with sequential restriction of the analysis to different age, stage, diagnosis period, and morphology groups.

Expression of PAX-2 by immunohistochemistry has been studied mainly in renal epithelial neoplasms with little attention to the lower male genitourinary tract. We studied PAX-2 expression in epithelium of normal seminal vesicle, normal ejaculatory duct, normal prostatic secretory epithelium, and prostatic adenocarcinoma to define its immunoreactivity pattern throughout the prostate gland and to evaluate its potential diagnostic role in the discrimination of seminal vesicle/ejaculatory duct epithelium from prostatic adenocarcinoma. In addition, given that PAX-2 is highly expressed in tissues of wolffian duct embryologic origin, we also sought to confirm the divergent embryogenesis of the central zone, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct from other regions of the prostate. Prostatectomy specimens from 12 patients were reviewed to identify blocks containing seminal vesicle, ejaculatory duct, periurethral glands, benign prostatic glands, and prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma. A total of 35 blocks from the 12 patients were evaluated. In addition, 2 tissue microarrays representing 15 additional seminal vesicles and 45 prostatic adenocarcinomas, 7 whole sections from prostatic adenocarcinomas of the central zone, and 5 core needle biopsies of seminal vesicle were also evaluated with anti-PAX-2 antibody. In the 12 radical prostatectomy whole sections, nuclear reactivity for PAX-2 was identified in 12 (100%) of 12 of the seminal vesicle epithelium, 9 (90%) of 10 of the ejaculatory duct epithelium, 0 of 12 of the prostatic adenocarcinoma, and 0 of 6 of the high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. All 20 total additional seminal vesicles were positive for PAX-2 in the tissue microarray and biopsies; and all 52 additional prostatic adenocarcinomas were negative, including 7 of central zone origin. The staining intensity and percentage of immunoreactive cells in seminal vesicle were both 3+ in all cases. Although the ejaculatory ducts also showed diffuse staining, their staining intensity was less (2+) than that in the seminal vesicles, particularly in the ejaculatory ducts in the periurethral area (1-2+intensity). The smaller glands surrounding the main seminal vesicle duct also showed less intense staining than the luminal cells of the main duct. Of the 19 total cases with evaluable central zone glands, 2 (10.5%) had focal nuclear reactivity in normal, benign prostatic secretory cells. All other benign prostatic secretory epithelia from the peripheral and transition zones were negative for PAX-2. In conclusion, nuclear PAX-2 immunoreactivity is typical in epithelium of the seminal vesicle and ejaculatory duct; but the intensity of staining is less in the ejaculatory duct. No reactivity for PAX-2 was seen in prostatic adenocarcinoma or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. PAX-2 has diagnostic utility as a positive immunohistochemical marker of seminal vesicle and ejaculatory duct epithelium. In addition, these data add further support to the proposed embryogenesis of the prostatic central zone, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory ducts from the wolffian system.""","""['Charles M Quick', 'Neriman Gokden', 'Ankur R Sangoi', 'James D Brooks', 'Jesse K McKenney']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Pigment in prostatic epithelium and adenocarcinoma: a potential source of diagnostic confusion with seminal vesicular epithelium.', 'Calcifications in prostate and ejaculatory system: a study on 298 consecutive whole mount sections of prostate from radical prostatectomy or cystoprostatectomy specimens.', 'Amphiregulin expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma: a study of 93 cases.', 'Seminal vesicle intraepithelial neoplasia versus basal cell hyperplasia in a seminal vesicle.', 'Prostate cancer reporting and staging: needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Prostate zones and cancer: lost in transition?', 'Epithelial DNA methyltransferase-1 regulates cell survival, growth and maturation in developing prostatic buds.', 'Diagnosis of typical and atypical transition zone prostate cancer and its mimics at multiparametric prostate MRI.', 'Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Values of the Benign Central Zone of the Prostate: Comparison With Low- and High-Grade Prostate Cancer.', 'Normal central zone of the prostate and central zone involvement by prostate cancer: clinical and MR imaging implications.']"""

We have previously shown that PCa tissue and cell lines express high levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR5, than compared to their normal counterparts, and interaction of CXCR5 with its specific ligand (CXCL13) promoted PCa cell invasion, migration, and differential matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. This study dissects some of the molecular mechanisms following CXCL13-CXCR5 interaction that mediate PCa cell migration and invasion.  Results:   Using Western blot analysis, kinase-specific cell-based ELISAs, and migration and invasion assays, we show that PCa cell lines differentially express phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit isoforms and dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2). Specifically, we show that PC3 and normal prostatic epithelial (RWPE-1), but not LNCaP cell lines expressed DOCK2, while RWPE, PC3, and LNCaP cell lines expressed PI3K-p110alpha and -p110beta. Moreover, PC3 selectively expressed PI3K-p110gamma, but LNCaP and RWPE cell lines expressed PI3Kp110delta. CXCL13 caused CXCR5-dependent activation of the PI3Kp85alpha in LNCaP cells, and p85alpha as well as -p101 in PC3 cells. CXCL13-CXCR5 interaction regulated LNCaP and PC3 cell migration and invasion through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation that was primarily dependent on the PI3Kp110 isoform(s), Src, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), but not DOCK2.  Conclusions:   While additional studies will be needed to determine the PI3K-independent (i.e., DOCK2-mediated) and -dependent events that dictate PCa cell responsiveness to CXCL13, these data provide evidence of the existence of cell type- and stimulus-specific signaling events that support migration and invasion of PCa cells.""","""['Christelle P El Haibi', 'Praveen K Sharma', 'Rajesh Singh', 'Paul R Johnson', 'Jill Suttles', 'Shailesh Singh', 'James W Lillard Jr']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Regulative role of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis in the tumor microenvironment.', 'CXCL13 mediates prostate cancer cell proliferation through JNK signalling and invasion through ERK activation.', 'Differential G protein subunit expression by prostate cancer cells and their interaction with CXCR5.', 'Clinical and biological significance of CXCR5 expressed by prostate cancer specimens and cell lines.', 'CXCL13 in Cancer and Other Diseases: Biological Functions, Clinical Significance, and Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Insights from DOCK2 in cell function and pathophysiology.', 'White adipose tissue-derived factors and prostate cancer progression: mechanisms and targets for interventions.', 'Comprehensive analysis of CXCR family members in lung adenocarcinoma with prognostic values.', 'Regulative role of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis in the tumor microenvironment.', ""Wharton's Jelly-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells with High Aurora Kinase A Expression Show Improved Proliferation, Migration, and Therapeutic Potential.""]"""

Because sex steroids are lipophilic, it is often thought that approximately 10% of them passively diffuse from plasma to saliva. Indeed, saliva can find use as sample material in sports medicine, pediatrics, veterinary medicine and behavioral sciences.

Although hypocalcemia often develops by ZDA, there is little information about the risk factors for hypocalcemia mediated by ZDA. This study was conducted to assess the risk of ZDA-mediated hypocalcemia. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients receiving ZDA in Mie University Hospital. The subjects were divided into two groups on the basis of whether hypocalcemia developed (19 patients) or not (30 patients). We compared patients' baseline characteristics between the two groups. The patients with hypocalcemia had lower albumin-adjusted serum calcium concentrations (median 9.2 mg/dl) before ZDA administration than the patients without hypocalcemia (median 9.8 mg/dl) (p< 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that an adjusted serum calcium concentration lower than 9.5 mg/dl before ZDA administration was an independent risk factor significantly contributing to the development of hypocalcemia (odds ratio 22.0, p< 0.01). Furthermore, the patients receiving corticosteroid had increased risk of ZDA mediated hypocalcemia (odds ratio 11.9, p<0.05). On the other hand, the patients with prostate cancer had a reduced risk for hypocalcemia after ZDA administration (odds ratio 0.06, p<0.05). In conclusion, a lower serum calcium concentration and co-administration of corticosteroid increased the risk of hypocalcemia after ZDA administration, while patients with prostate cancer might have a small risk of this incidence. These findings should provide useful information regarding the monitoring of serum calcium concentration in cancer patients receiving ZDA.""","""['Miho Hanamura', 'Takuya Iwamoto', 'Norihito Soga', 'Yoshiki Sugimura', 'Masahiro Okuda']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biol Pharm Bull""","""['Identification of the risk factors associated with hypocalcemia induced by denosumab.', 'Symptomatic hypocalcemia following intravenous administration of zoledronic acid in a breast cancer patient.', 'Persistent hypocalcemia induced by zoledronic acid in a patient with androgen-independent prostate cancer and extensive bone metastases.', 'Inhibition of RANK ligand to treat bone metastases.', 'Clinical efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in prostate and breast cancer.', 'Histologic evaluation of femoral nerve demyelinating and axonal neuropathy in Wistar rats due to alendronate intake: a randomised study.', 'Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Bone Metastasis in Lung Cancer (2019 Version).', 'Treatment of severe hypocalcaemia due to osteoblastic metastases in a patient with post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism with 153Sm-EDTMP.', 'Diagnosis and treatment of bone metastasis: comprehensive guideline of the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology, Japanese Orthopedic Association, Japanese Urological Association, and Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology.', 'Severe resistant hypocalcemia in multiple myeloma after zoledronic acid administration: a case report.']"""

To help elucidate the mechanisms behind XMRV infection, we show that prostatic fibroblast cells express Xpr1, a known receptor of XMRV, but its expression is absent in other cell lines of the prostate (i.e., epithelial and stromal smooth muscle cells). We also show that certain amino acid residues located within the predicted extracellular loop (ECL3 and ECL4) sequences of Xpr1 are required for efficient XMRV entry. Although we found strong evidence to support XMRV infection of prostatic fibroblast cell lines via Xpr1, we learned that XMRV was indeed capable of infecting cells that did not necessarily express Xpr1, such as those of the prostatic epithelial and smooth muscle origins. Further studies suggest that the expression of Xpr1 and certain genotypes of the RNASEL gene, which could restrict XMRV infection, may play important roles in defining XMRV tropisms in certain cell types.

Moreover, pattern analyses based on inferred gene set activities of individual samples have shown the ability to identify more robust disease signatures than individual gene-based pattern analyses. Although a number of approaches have been proposed for gene set-based pattern analysis, the combinatorial influence of deregulated gene sets on disease phenotype classification has not been studied sufficiently.  Results:   We propose a new approach for inferring combinatorial Boolean rules of gene sets for a better understanding of cancer transcriptome and cancer classification. To reduce the search space of the possible Boolean rules, we identify small groups of gene sets that synergistically contribute to the classification of samples into their corresponding phenotypic groups (such as normal and cancer). We then measure the significance of the candidate Boolean rules derived from each group of gene sets; the level of significance is based on the class entropy of the samples selected in accordance with the rules. By applying the present approach to publicly available prostate cancer datasets, we identified 72 significant Boolean rules. Finally, we discuss several identified Boolean rules, such as the rule of glutathione metabolism (down) and prostaglandin synthesis regulation (down), which are consistent with known prostate cancer biology.  Availability:   Scripts written in Python and R are available at http://biosoft.kaist.ac.kr/~ihpark/.

There are conflicting data regarding the roles of these molecules in prostate cancer. To elucidate the prognostic impact of these proteins and provide information on prognosis and treatment, we compared the expression of COX-2, TGF-beta, and IL-10 in prostate cancer specimens with or without metastases. Ki67 was included as a measure of growth fraction of tumor cells.  Methods:   Digital video analysis images from tumor cell areas and tumor stromal areas were analyzed on formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded and immunohistochemical stained cancer specimens from 59 patients: 32 patients with metastases and 27 patients without clinical, biochemical, or radiological evidence of metastases within 10 years after diagnosis. The expression of COX-2 was scored as negative, weak, moderate, or strong. The expressions of TGF-beta and IL-10 were assessed as proportions of moderately or strongly stained cells. Ki67 was detected as strong nuclear staining in proliferating cells.  Results:   In primary cancers in the metastatic group, COX-2, TGF-beta and Ki67 were stronger expressed in epithelial tumor cell and tumor stromal areas compared with non-metastatic cancers (for all markers, p<0.0001). High intensity of COX-2 staining in tumor areas was strongly associated with death from prostate cancer in univariate analyses (hazard ratio [HR] 95% CI, 4.0 (1.1-14.5)). In multivariate analyses, the risk estimate was strengthened but did not reach significance. No associations to death were found for the other markers.

The current hypothesis for the spatial pattern of this disease is low vitamin D levels in individuals living at northerly latitudes; however, this explanation only partially explains the spatial distribution in the incidence of this cancer. Using a U.S. county-level ecological study design, we provide evidence that other meteorological parameters further explain the variation in prostate cancer across the U.S.  Results:   In general, the colder the temperature and the drier the climate in a county, the higher the incidence of prostate cancer, even after controlling for shortwave radiation, age, race, snowfall, premature mortality from heart disease, unemployment rate, and pesticide use. Further, in counties with high average annual snowfall (>75 cm/yr) the amount of land used to grow crops (a proxy for pesticide use) was positively correlated with the incidence of prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   The trends found in this USA study suggest prostate cancer may be partially correlated with meteorological factors.

The most lateral two ports were placed medially and caudally in patients with a small pelvis to avoid interference between the ports and the pelvis (modified port configuration). Lymph node dissection is carried out in the external iliac, obturator and infraobturator area. The dissection on the lateral border of the bladder neck is carried out until it reaches the seminal vesicle (ultradissection). After transection of the bladder neck, vasa seminal vesicles are dissected further. Neurovascular bundles are preserved in selected patients. The dorsal venous complex (DVC) and the urethra are transected without suturing. Urethrovesical anastomosis is carried out with 3-0 monocryl running suture, incorporating with the edge of DVC. The puboprostatic collar and bladder are incorporated by 3-0 monocryl running suture (puboperineoplasty). Between November 2007 and September 2008, RARP was carried out using this technique in 182 patients. Median height, weight, body mass index and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were 168 cm, 68 kg, 24 kg/M(2) and 7.1 ng/mL, respectively. Mean operative time was 192 min and average blood loss was 250 mL. Median catheterization time was 8 days. Positive surgical margin rates for pT2, pT3 and pT4 disease was 12.7, 48 and 100%, respectively. Intraoperative complication rate was 2.7%.

MMTV-like virus DNA has previously been detected in human breast cancers, liver disease, and liver cancers. It is hypothesized that local hormonal effects might be of primary importance in determining MMTV-like virus detection in human tumors. MMTV-like virus envelope (env) DNA was determined using nested PCR in 89 ovarian, 147 prostate, 50 endometrial, 141 skin, and 51 lung cancers. Viral-positive sequences were compared with published MMTV-like viral sequences from human breast cancer, liver cancer and MMTV. Immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor (ER-alpha) and progesterone receptor (PgR) was performed on a subset of tumors. MMTV-like virus env DNA was detected in ovarian cancers (14/89; 16%), prostate cancers (53/147; 36%), endometrial cancers (5/50; 10%), skin cancers (13/141; 9%) but not in lung cancers (0/51). Phylogenetic analysis of the viral-positive sequences showed no clustering of the isolates according to tissue type. A significant association was observed between the presence of hormone receptors and detection of MMTV-like virus in the human cancers screened (P = 0.01). A significant association between MMTV-like virus and PgR was noted in skin cancers (P = 0.003). Therefore, unlike the mouse model, the detection of MMTV-like env sequences in human cancers in addition to breast indicates that MMTV-like viral expression is not breast cancer-specific and may relate to hormone-dependent viral expression.""","""['Harpreet Johal', 'Margaret Faedo', 'Jacqueline Faltas', 'Amie Lau', 'Railya Mousina', 'Paul Cozzi', 'Anna Defazio', 'William D Rawlinson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Med Virol""","""['Mouse mammary tumor-like virus is associated with p53 nuclear accumulation and progesterone receptor positivity but not estrogen positivity in human female breast cancer.', 'Mouse mammary tumor virus-like sequences in human breast cancer.', 'Mouse mammary tumor virus-like ENV gene sequences in human breast tumors and in a lymphoma of a breast cancer patient.', 'Possibilities of a viral etiology for human breast cancer.

Screening allows early detection of disease or elevated risk of disease, and has the potential for improved treatment and reduction of mortality. The list of future screening opportunities is set to grow because of the refinement of screening techniques, the increasing frequency of degenerative and chronic diseases, and the steadily growing body of evidence on genetic predispositions for various diseases. But how should we decide on the diseases for which screening should be done and on recommendations for how it should be implemented? We use the examples of prostate cancer and genetic screening to show the importance of considering screening as an ongoing population-based intervention with beneficial and harmful effects, and not simply the use of a test. Assessing whether screening should be recommended and implemented for any named disease is therefore a multi-dimensional task in health technology assessment. There are several countries that already use established processes and criteria to assess the appropriateness of screening. We argue that the Swiss healthcare system needs a nationwide screening commission mandated to conduct appropriate evidence-based evaluation of the impact of proposed screening interventions, to issue evidence-based recommendations, and to monitor the performance of screening programmes introduced. Without explicit processes there is a danger that beneficial screening programmes could be neglected and that ineffective, and potentially harmful, screening procedures could be introduced.""","""['Marcel Zwahlen', 'Nicola Low', 'Bettina Borisch', 'Matthias Egger', 'Nino Künzli', 'Reto Obrist', 'Fred Paccaud', 'Ursula Zybach', 'Nicole M Probst-Hensch']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Swiss Med Wkly""","""['Too Much Medicine: Time to Stop Indiscriminate Cancer Screening.', 'A conceptual framework and metrics for evaluating multicomponent interventions to increase colorectal cancer screening within an organized screening program.', 'Cancer screening rates in individuals with different life expectancies.', 'Screening induced by health services: impact and consequences.

To investigate the upstream signaling events required for the activation of Bax and/or Bak and to determine the functional impact of de-regulated cell cycle restriction point control in this context, we genetically dissected the impact of BH3-only proteins and the role of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21(CDKN1). Using isogenic HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, either wild-type or homozygously deleted for the BH3-only protein Puma/bbc3 and/or p21(CDKN1) or p53-reconstituted DU145 prostate cancer cells, we show that p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis is attenuated in the absence of Puma. Upon expression of p14(ARF) in HCT116 cells, Puma is rapidly induced at both the mRNA and protein level. Puma-proficient HCT116 cells undergo apoptotic (nuclear) DNA fragmentation, which is preceded by the N-terminal conformational change of Bax, the breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and induction of caspase-9 (LEHD)-like and caspase-3/7 (DEVD)-like activities. In contrast, p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis is markedly attenuated in isogenic HCT116 cells bi-allelically deleted for puma. The sensitivity of Puma-deficient cells to p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis is fully restored by functional reconstitution of Puma using a conditional adenoviral expression vector. Notably, the concomitant deletion of p21(CDKN1) strongly enhances p14(ARF)-induced apoptosis in Puma-proficient cells, but not in isogenic Puma-deficient cells. These results indicate that p14(ARF)-induced mitochondrial apoptosis critically depends on the BH3-only protein Puma.

Diagnosis is typically performed through Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) quantification, Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) and Transrectal Ultrasonography (TU). The antigen (PSA) is secreted by all prostatic epithelial cells and not exclusively by cancerous ones, so its concentration also increases in the presence of other prostatic diseases. DRE and TU are not reliable for early detection, when histological analysis of prostate tissue obtained from a biopsy is necessary. In this context, fluorescence techniques are very important for the diagnosis of cancer. In this paper we explore the potential of using endogenous phorphyrin blood fluorescence as tumour marker for prostate cancer. Substances such as porphyrin derivatives accumulate substantially more in tumours than in normal tissues; thus, measuring blood porphyrin concentration by autofluorescence intensity may provide a good parameter for determining tumour stage. In this study, the autofluorescence of blood porphyrin was analyzed using fluorescence and excitation spectroscopy on healthy male NUDE mice and in those with prostate cancer induced by inoculation of DU145 cells. A significant contrast between the blood of normal and cancer subjects could be established. Blood porphyrin fluorophore showed an enhancement on the fluorescence band around 632 nm following tumour growth. Fluorescence detection has advantages over other light-based investigation methods: high sensitivity, high speed and safety. However it does carry the drawback of low specificity of detection. The extraction of blood porphyrin using acetone can solve this problem, since optical excitation of further molecular species can be excluded, and light scattering from blood samples is negligible.""","""['Flávia Rodrigues de Oliveira Silva', 'Maria Helena Bellini', 'Vivian Regina Tristão', 'Nestor Schor', 'Nilson Dias Vieira Jr', 'Lilia Coronato Courrol']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Fluoresc""","""['Enhancement of blood porphyrin emission intensity with aminolevulinic acid administration: a new concept for photodynamic diagnosis of early prostate cancer.', 'Study of protoporphyrin IX elimination by body excreta: a new noninvasive cancer diagnostic method?', 'Study of blood porphyrin spectral profile for diagnosis of tumor progression.', 'Incidental carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Status of PSA determination for early detection of prostate carcinoma.', 'SARS-CoV-2, hemoglobin and protoporphyrin IX: Interactions and perspectives.', 'Using Light for Therapy of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM).', 'In vivo detection of oral precancer using a fluorescence-based, in-house-fabricated device: a Mahalanobis distance-based classification.', 'Porphyrins are increased in the faeces of patients with prostate cancer: a case-control study.', 'Early detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma: a clinical decision support tool based on plasma porphyrin accumulation and risk factors.']"""

However, a wide range of IC(50) concentrations has been observed in published studies of the anti-proliferative activity of EGCG from different laboratories. Although the susceptibility to EGCG treatment is largely dependent on cancer cell type, the particular cell viability and proliferation assays utilized may significantly influence quantitative results reported in the literature.  Methodology/principal findings:   We compared five widely used methods to measure cell proliferation and viability after EGCG treatment using LNCaP prostate cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Both methods using dyes to quantify adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and deoxynucleic acid (DNA) showed accuracy in the measurement of viable cells when compared to trypan blue assay and results showed good linear correlation (r = 0.95). However, the use of MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) as indicators of metabolically active mitochondria overestimated the number of viable cells by comparison with the ATP, DNA, or trypan blue determinations. As a result, the observed IC(50) concentration of EGCG was 2-fold higher using MTT and MTS compared to dyes quantifying ATP and DNA. In contrast, when cells were treated with apigenin MTT and MTS assays showed consistent results with ATP, DNA, or trypan blue assays.

Specifically, we found that TRAIL treatment activates the Akt survival pathway and that inhibition of this pathway by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or knockdown of Akt sensitizes resistant cancer cells to TRAIL. Since Akt is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor PTEN, we examined the TRAIL sensitivity in PTEN knockdown mouse prostate epithelial cells and found that PTEN(-/-) cells are more resistant than PTEN(+/+) cells while the sensitivity of PTEN(+/-) cells fell in between. Further, we showed that overexpression of a mutant PTEN confers TRAIL resistance in PTEN(+/+) cells, supporting a role of PTEN in TRAIL sensitivity. In TRAIL resistant breast T47D cells, overexpression of the mutant PTEN further increased their resistance to TRAIL. Taken together, our data indicate that inactivation of functional PTEN and the consequent activation of the Akt pathway prevents TRAIL-induced apoptosis, leading to TRAIL resistance.

Patients and methods:   Between October 1994 and October 2007, 1282 patients were treated with I125 at the Hotel Dieu de Quebec. Two hundred patients were intermediate risk prostate cancer. One hundred and fifty-seven had enough follow-up to be evaluated in this study. Biochemical failure-free survival is reported using Phoenix definition. Acute and late GU toxicity was described using the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) as well as with the rate of bladder catheter. Erectile dysfunction was also reported.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 65.6 years (S.D.=6 years) and the mean pretreatment PSA was 8.7ng/ml. About half of the patients (51%) were T2b/T2c. About 44.6% had a PSA greater than 10 and 4.5% had Gleason score of 7/10. More than half of the patients received a short course of hormones of less than 6 months for cytoreduction (57.4%). The median follow-up was 60 months. Biochemical failure-free survival at 60-month and 96-month were 87.1% and 81% according to Phoenix definition. The mean IPSS rose from 5 immediately after the implant to 15 1 month after and then slowly decreased to 8 at 24 months. Acute urinary retention with bladder catheter occurred in 10.9% of patients. Only 4.3% presented erectile dysfunction at 5 months post-implant.

In the Polish population, three founder mutations of CHEK2 have been identified: I157T, 444+1G>A (formerly IVS2+1G>A), and 1100delC. The aim of our study was to establish a simple method to identify founder CHEK2 mutations and determine the prevalence of these changes in the population of Eastern Germany (Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia). We drew up denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) conditions for analysis of intron 2 and exon 3 for two mutations (444+1G>A, I157T) and exon 10 for mutation 1100delC. We tested 251 patients and controls. Mutations show a similar frequency in the general population of Eastern Germany as in neighboring Poland (4.95% vs. 4.8% for the missense mutation I157T and 0.99% vs. 0.5% for the truncating mutations 444+1G>A and 1100delC). Investigation of these mutations by DHPLC is highly sensitive and less time-consuming compared to restriction fragment length polymorphism or allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction.

To investigate the differential effects of wild type (wt) and mutant AR on IGF-IR levels we employed a series of isogenic prostate-derived cell lines and human xenografts. We show that basal and phosphorylated IGF-IR levels progressively decreased as prostate cancer cells became more tumorigenic and metastatic. In addition, we show that wt, but not mutant, AR along with dihydrotestosterone treatment increased IGF-IR promoter activity and endogenous IGF-IR levels. ChIP analysis show enhanced AR binding to the IGF-IR promoter in AR-overexpressing cells. Finally, wt AR-overexpressing cells display an enhanced proliferation rate. In summary, we provide evidence that activated wt AR enhances IGF-IR transcription in prostate cancer cells via a mechanism that involves AR binding to the IGF-IR promoter. AR mutations alter the ability of the mutated protein to regulate IGF-IR expression. Our results suggest that prostate cancer progression is associated with a decrease in IGF-IR expression that could be the result of impaired ability of AR to stimulate IGF-IR gene expression.""","""['Hagit Schayek', 'Hila Seti', 'Norman M Greenberg', 'Shihua Sun', 'Haim Werner', 'Stephen R Plymate']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Tumor suppressor BRCA1 is expressed in prostate cancer and controls insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) gene transcription in an androgen receptor-dependent manner.', 'Androgens up-regulate the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) expression in AR-negative prostate cancer cells results in differential effects of DHT and IGF-I on proliferation and AR activity between localized and metastatic tumors.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-IR) as a target for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Aberrant androgen action in prostatic progenitor cells induces oncogenesis and tumor development through IGF1 and Wnt axes.', 'Histone Demethylase KDM7A Regulates Androgen Receptor Activity, and Its Chemical Inhibitor TC-E 5002 Overcomes Cisplatin-Resistance in Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'MECoRank: cancer driver genes discovery simultaneously evaluating the impact of SNVs and differential expression on transcriptional networks.', 'Inhibition of USP14 enhances the sensitivity of breast cancer to enzalutamide.', 'Molecular Signatures of the Insulin-like Growth Factor 1-mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Breast, Lung and Gastric Cancers.']"""

In this work the bone marrow microenvironment in vitro was recreated both by tailoring scaffolds physical properties and by functionalizing electrospun polymer fibers with a bioactive peptide derived from domain IV of perlecan heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Electrospun poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers and PCL/gelatin composite scaffolds were modified covalently with perlecan domain IV (PlnDIV) peptide. The expression of tight junction protein (E-cadherin) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation on tyrosine 397 also were investigated. The described bioactive motif significantly enhanced adherence and infiltration of the metastatic prostate cancer cells on all modified electrospun substrates by day 5 post-seeding. Cells cultured on PlnDIV-modified matrices organized stress fibers and increased proliferation at statistically significant rates. Additional findings suggest that presence of PlnDIV peptide in the matrix reduced expression of tight junction protein and binding to PlnDIV peptide was accompanied by increased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation on tyrosine 397. We conclude that PlnDIV peptide supports key signaling events leading to proliferation, survival, and migration of C4-2B cancer cells; hence its incorporation into electrospun matrix is a key improvement to create a successful three-dimensional (3-D) pharmacokinetic cancer model.""","""['Olga Hartman', 'Chu Zhang', 'Elizabeth L Adams', 'Mary C Farach-Carson', 'Nicholas J Petrelli', 'Bruce D Chase', 'John F Rabolt']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Matrilysin/MMP-7 Cleavage of Perlecan/HSPG2 Complexed with Semaphorin 3A Supports FAK-Mediated Stromal Invasion by Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Poly(ɛ-caprolactone)/gelatin composite electrospun scaffolds with porous crater-like structures for tissue engineering.', 'Coating electrospun collagen and gelatin fibers with perlecan domain I for increased growth factor binding.', 'A novel peptide sequence in perlecan domain IV supports cell adhesion, spreading and FAK activation.', 'Perlecan signaling: helping hedgehog stimulate prostate cancer growth.', 'Nanometric Mechanical Behavior of Electrospun Membranes Loaded with Magnetic Nanoparticles.', 'Immobilization of Gelatin on Fibers for Tissue Engineering Applications: A Comparative Study of Three Aliphatic Polyesters.', 'Biomimetic peptide enriched nonwoven scaffolds promote calcium phosphate mineralisation.', 'Impact of perlecan, a core component of basement membrane, on regeneration of cartilaginous tissues.', 'Fabrication of hybrid scaffolds obtained from combinations of PCL with gelatin or collagen via electrospinning for skeletal muscle tissue engineering.']"""

Materials and methods:   The time trend in invasive prostate cancer incidence from 1975 to 2004 was studied by combining data from 13 Spanish population-based cancer registries. Change-point Poisson regression models were fitted for all men and for two age groups (45-64 and 65+ years). Age-period-cohort models were used to study cohort and period effects. In addition, we studied the time trend in prostate cancer mortality in Spain for the period 1980-2007.  Results:   Incidence increased annually by 1.3% from 1975 to 1990 and by 7.3% thereafter. Until 1990, the percentage increase was low and indeed similar for both age groups. While the subsequent increase in the two age groups was greater, this was particularly marked among the youngest men, with a decrease being observed in age groups >85 years in the last quinquennium. Mortality increased by an annual figure of 0.7% until 1998, after which it decreased by 3.6% per annum until 2007.  Conclusions:   Despite the dramatic rise in incidence from 1990 onwards, mainly due to opportunistic screening, prostate cancer mortality was only observed to decline slowly from 1998. If prostate-specific antigen screening remains at a similar level in Spain, overdiagnosis may well become an important chronic side-effect and health problem.""","""['N Larrañaga', 'J Galceran', 'E Ardanaz', 'P Franch', 'C Navarro', 'M J Sánchez', 'R Pastor-Barriuso;Prostate Cancer Working Group']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer incidence and mortality in Navarre (Spain).', 'Differences in the epidemic rise and decrease of prostate cancer among geographical areas in Southern Europe. an analysis of differential trends in incidence and mortality in France, Italy and Spain.', 'Long-term trends in pancreatic cancer mortality in Spain (1952-2012).', 'Breast and prostate cancer: an analysis of common epidemiological features in mortality trends in Spain.', 'Impact of screening on prostate cancer rates and trends.', 'Do the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Tests That Are Ordered in Clinical Practice Adhere to the Pertinent Guidelines?', 'Differences in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Lower Saxony (Germany) and Groningen Province (Netherlands): Potential Impact of Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing.', ""General practitioners' approaches to prostate-specific antigen testing in the north-east of the Netherlands."", 'Clinical Applications of Molecular Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Early detection of prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen testing: an empirical evaluation among general practitioners and urologists.']"""

Patients and methods:   Our analysis covered eight Spanish regions, namely, Basque Country, Navarre, Girona, Tarragona, Castellón, Albacete, Murcia and Granada, and included patients with cancer of the colon, rectum, lung, breast, ovary, prostate, testis, melanoma of skin and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cases diagnosed during the period 1995-99 were followed up until 31 December 2004. For individual records, the maximum likelihood approach was used to estimate 5-year relative survival (5y-RS), with crude and adjusted 5y-RS being calculated. A statistical test was applied to explain significant geographical variations.  Results:   In the regions studied, the highest 5y-RS ratio was detected for lung cancer (adjusted 5y-RS of 12.4% in Navarre versus 6.1% in Granada) and the lowest for breast cancer (91.3% in Castellón versus 81.2% in Albacete). 5y-RS for the respective cancer types was as follows: colon and rectal, 54.7% and 50.2%, respectively; ovarian, 43% overall, though much lower in the oldest age groups; prostate, 76%, rising to close to 80% in the 45-74 age group, with rates ranging from highest in Girona to lowest in Albacete; testicular, 95%, the type with the best prognosis; and Hodgkin's lymphoma, 85%, rising to 92% among young adults. In the case of melanoma of skin, the sex-related difference in 5y-RS was >10% for women.  Conclusions:   Although regional differences were identified for most tumours, these were more marked in lung cancer. Women showed better prognosis. Breast and prostate cancer registered lower survival among young than among middle-aged adults. The worst prognosis was for lung cancer and the best for cutaneous melanoma, with breast, prostate and Hodgkin's lymphoma displaying favourable and colon, rectum and ovary unfavourable prognoses.

Methods:   Data were sourced from the National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estadística - INE) and the World Health Organization mortality database. Mortality trends were studied using change-point Poisson regression models.  Results:   All-cancer mortality decreased in both sexes from 1980 to 2007, owing to the fact that the tumours responsible for the highest number of deaths registered declining trends from the mid-1990s onwards. In men, mortality due to stomach and prostate cancer fell by >3% per annum in the last 10 years of the study period. In women, the largest contributions to the fall in cancer mortality were due to breast and colorectal cancers. In contrast, female mortality due to smoking-related cancers rose significantly. Within the European context, Spain's estimated 2005 mortality rates were intermediate for men and low for women.  Conclusion:   Cancer control is progressing in the right direction in Spain.

The aim of this study is to define and describe the anatomy of the fascias surrounding the prostate in a histoembryologic model and during open and laparoscopic approaches to assess their importance in surgical practice.  Methods:   An anatomical dissection of three fresh cadavers was conducted to reproduce an open approach. Complementary data under laparoscopic conditions were obtained from images captured from the video feed during a laparoscopic NSRP performed via a transperitoneal approach. A histological study of one fresh 25-week human male fetus, obtained following miscarriage, was also conducted to document the embryologic development of the identified fascias.  Results:   Three fascias surrounding the prostate can clearly be individualized both in histologic and clinical conditions. The endopelvic fascia (EF), the prostatic fascia (PF) and the Denonvilliers' fascia (DF) recover the prostate gland and structure the periprostatic environment. Neurovascular bundles are situated in a triangle formed by PF, EF and DF. Interfascial dissection (between EF and PF) allows nerve-sparing surgery.  Conclusion:   When performing radical prostatectomy, it is mandatory to locate EF, PF and DF precisely to respect the neurovascular bundles.

The role of kisspeptin in prostatic carcinoma remains undefined. We therefore aimed to investigate release of kisspeptin by prostatic cancer cell lines; investigate expression of KiSS-1 in human prostate tissue; investigate whether patients with prostate carcinoma have elevated plasma kisspeptin. 1) Culture medium from prostatic carcinoma cell lines LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 was assayed for kisspeptin immunoreactivity (-IR). Kisspeptin-IR release was detectable from all three cell lines. The effect of hydroxyflutamide, gefitinib and resveratrol on kisspeptin-IR release from these cell lines was also investigated. No effect of the drugs tested on release of kisspeptin-IR was observed. 2) Expression of KiSS-1 in human prostate tissue (n=4) was investigated using in situ hybridisation. Expression of KiSS-1 was detected in human prostate tissue. 3) Plasma kisspeptin-IR was compared in 92 patients with prostatic carcinoma and 73 male controls. Kisspeptin-IR was not detected in the plasma of either patients with prostate cancer or control patients. We have therefore shown for the first time the release of kisspeptin-IR by prostatic carcinoma cell lines.

Treatment techniques were compared by using rectum, bladder and femoral heads dose-volume histogram data. A three-field arrangement consisting of an anterior and two lateral portals resulted in the maximum rectal sparing irrespectively of the irradiated area. The maximum femoral head sparing was achieved by the technique consisting of six oblique and lateral fields. The maximum bladder protection was observed with the box technique for treatment with large pelvic fields and with the arrangement consisting of two oblique and two lateral portals for conedown irradiation.

Inhibitory effects of silibinin on prostate cancer invasion, motility and migration were previously observed in the highly bone metastatic ARCaP M cell line; however, mechanisms of such efficacy are not completely elucidated. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial step in the progression of prostate cancer, reversal or inhibition of EMT by drugs thus provides a new approach to prostate cancer therapy. In the present study, we found that silibinin treatment resulted in the up-regulation of cytokeratin-18 and down-regulation of vimentin and MMP2, which was consistent with morphologic reversal of EMT phenotype leading to be epithelial. Moreover, we found that silibinin could inhibit the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p50 translocation via the up-regulation of I kappaB alpha protein, and possibly subsequently down-regulated the expression of two major EMT regulators, ZEB1 and SLUG transcription factors.

The present study investigates the growth and transcriptional responses of LNCaP prostate cancer cells to prolonged high Zn2+ treatment. Restoration of high intracellular Zn2+ to LNCaP cells significantly reduced the cell proliferation rate by 42.2+/-7.4% at the exponential growth phase and the efficiency of colony formation on soft agar by 87.2+/-2.5% at week 5 post-treatment. At least 161 LNCaP cell genes responded to the high intracellular Zn2+, including approximately 10.6% genes that negatively regulate cell growth and approximately 16.1% genes that promote cancer cell proliferation. Inhibition of cell growth was transient as normal proliferation rate and colony formation efficiency were restored later even in the continuous presence of high intracellular Zn2+. RT-qPCR showed constitutively higher expression levels of FBL, CD164 and STEAP1 in LNCaP cells. FBL and CD164 were responsive to the treatment with Zn2+ in PNT2 prostate normal cells and were further overexpressed in the prolonged Zn2+-treated LNCaP cells. These observations suggest that in general high Zn2+ has suppressive effects on prostate cancer cell growth but continuous exposure to an environment of high Zn2+ can lead to the overexpression of cancer promoting genes such as FBL and CD164.

However, the regulation of 15-LOX-2 remains unclear. In this study, we independently cloned the 5' upstream promoter fragments of 15-LOX-2 gene. Target DNA fragments each were cloned into an expression vector containing luciferase reporter gene, which were called LF1(-1533/+87), LF2(-628/+87), LF3(-253/+87), LF4(-157/+87), LF5(-33/+87), LF6(-253/+1), and LF7(-157/+1). Each of these individual promoter fragments was transfected into primary prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer LNCaP cells. The promoter activity gradually decreased with progressive deletions from LF2 to LF4. A significant drop was noted in the LF5. LF6 and LF7 that did not contain the 87-bp region downstream the transcription start site (TSS) have significant luciferase activities similar to those of corresponding fragments (LF3 and LF4) that contain 87-bp region downstream the TSS. This suggests that the 125-bp region (-157 to -33) of LF4 is critical for the promoter activity of 15-LOX-2 in the primary prostate epithelial cells PrEC and cancer cells LNCaP. Moreover, we discovered a specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) responsive element (GRE) in this key region. The luciferase activities of the LF4 and LF7 were decreased in the LNCaP cells co-transfected with GR (hGRalpha or hGRbeta) expression vectors. This inhibitory effect is reversed after treatments with dexamethasone or two specific GR inhibitors (siRNAs of GR and RU486).

Mitochondrial fission requires the cytoplasmic dynamin-related protein, Drp1, which translocates to the mitochondria during apoptosis and interacts with the mitochondrial protein, Fis1. Finely tuned changes in cellular calcium modulate a variety of intracellular functions; in resting cells, the level of mitochondrial calcium is low, while it is higher during apoptosis. Mitochondria take up Ca(2+) via the Uniporter and extrude it to the cytoplasm through the mitochondrial Na+/Ca(2+) exchanger. Overload of Ca(2+) in the mitochondria leads to their damage, affecting cellular function and survival. The mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was blocked by benzodiazepine, CGP37157 (CGP) leading to increased mitochondrial calcium and enhancing the apoptotic effects of TRAIL, TNFalpha related apoptosis inducing ligand. In the present study, we observed that increasing mitochondrial calcium induced mitochondrial fragmentation, which correlated with the presence of Drp1 at the mitochondria in CGP treated cells. Under these conditions, we observed interactions between Drp1 and Fis1. The importance of Drp1 in fragmentation was confirmed by transfection of dominant negative Drp1 construct. However, fragmentation of the mitochondria was not sufficient to induce apoptosis, although it enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, oligomerization of Bak was partially responsible for the increased apoptosis in cells treated with both CGP and TRAIL.

However, scanty information is currently available on molecular mechanisms underlying selenium's anticancer action. The tumor suppressor p53 plays an important role in preventing transformation by transcriptional regulation of a range of genes that are involved in vital cell functions such as DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis. Here we report that incubation of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells (p53 +/+) with a natural form of selenium triggers rapid transcriptional activation of p53, and up-regulation of the expression of p53-target genes as well as induction of miR-34 class of microRNAs. Moreover, blocking p53 function by transfection of cells with a dominant-negative, mutated p53 gene, or by siRNA, significantly reduced selenium-induced expression of p53-target genes and induction of apoptosis. Since majority of the early-stage human prostate cancers bear functional p53 gene (p53+/+), our findings indicate that the anticancer action of selenium may involve transactivation of p53 as a potential mechanism, and suggest that selenite may be useful not only for prevention but also for treatment of human prostate cancer.""","""['Sivalokanathan Sarveswaran', 'Joshua Liroff', 'Zongxiang Zhou', 'Alexander Y Nikitin', 'Jagadananda Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Differential involvement of reactive oxygen species in apoptosis induced by two classes of selenium compounds in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Expression of p53 enhances selenite-induced superoxide production and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Inorganic selenium sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through superoxide/p53/Bax-mediated activation of mitochondrial pathway.', 'Selenite-induced p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation and caspase-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Effects of selenite and genistein on G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential Inhibition of Anaplerotic Pyruvate Carboxylation and Glutaminolysis-Fueled Anabolism Underlies Distinct Toxicity of Selenium Agents in Human Lung Cancer.', 'Selenium-enriched plant foods: Selenium accumulation, speciation, and health functionality.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Genome-Protecting Compounds as Potential Geroprotectors.', 'Effect of dietary components on miRNA and colorectal carcinogenesis.']"""

In particular IMPT plans have been optimized based on four different starting conditions of initial beamlet fluences: (a) all beamlets with an initial constant weight, delivering a gradient from the proximal to the distal edge of the target (forward wedge approach); (b) beamlet weights reduced from the distal to the proximal aspect of the target such as to deliver a flat 'spread-out-Bragg-peak' (SOBP approach); (c) beamlet weights calculated to deliver a gradient from the distal (maximal dose) to the proximal edge (inverse wedge); (d) beamlet weights set universally to zero except the most distal one, for each given lateral direction (i.e. distal-edge-tracking, DET). An analysis of robustness to range errors has been performed by recalculating plans, assuming a systematic 3% error in CT values. Results showed that IMPT plans optimized with the forward wedge approach were very sensitive to range errors, since organs-at-risk (OAR) were spared by patching single-field lateral and distal fall-offs, the last ones being strongly sensitive to range errors. In addition a plan robust to range errors can be achieved by starting the optimization process in the case of low-dose constraints to OAR, with the initial flat SOBP approach, and with either the DET or the inverse wedge approaches, in the case of stringent dose-volume constraints to OAR.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of definitive therapy with radiation therapy (external beam radiation therapy [EBRT] or brachytherapy) on acute myeloid leukemia incidence in a population-based cohort of patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   We utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify a cohort of men (n=168,612) with newly diagnosed prostate adenocarcinoma between January 1988 and December 2003. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of acute myeloid leukemia incidence following definitive therapy with EBRT alone, brachytherapy alone, or surgery alone compared to no definitive therapy (i.e. no EBRT, brachytherapy, or surgery).  Results:   The cohort yielded 184 acute myeloid leukemia cases during 1,064,820 person-years of follow-up after prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosis. Patients treated with EBRT had a higher adjusted relative risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than patients treated with brachytherapy or surgery when each therapy group was compared to patients who were not treated with definitive therapy (EBRT: HR=2.05, 95% CI 1.29, 3.26; brachytherapy: HR=1.22, 95% CI 0.46, 3.22; surgery: HR=1.24, 95% CI 0.77, 1.98).

A convenient and accurate plasma assay of this steroid has become important.  Methods:   We simultaneously assayed estrone sulfate in the plasma of one hundred men aged 30-50 years, according to LC-MS/MS, GC-MS after solvolysis of E(1)S, radioimmunoassay after a chromatographic purification step, and a direct RIA commercial kit.  Results:   Estrone sulfate plasma levels obtained with the first three methods were not significantly different. However, estrone sulfate levels measured by the direct RIA were three-fold higher than those obtained by the first three methods. We showed that the excessively high estrone sulfate levels obtained with the direct RIA kit had two origins: interference by high dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate plasma levels in men, and estrone sulfate inaccurate low concentrations in the standards.  Conclusion:   The LC-MS/MS method can be considered as an optimum option for clinical laboratory.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis-inducing agents of cells with stem-like properties in both normal and malignant human epithelia.  Methods:   Cells isolated from fresh human head and neck carcinomas (n = 11), cell lines derived from head and neck, prostate and breast human carcinomas (n = 7), and from normal human oral mucosa (n = 5), were exposed to various apoptosis-inducing stimuli (UV, Tumour Necrosis Factor, Cisplatin, Etoposide, and Neocarzinostatin). Flow cytometry for CD44 and epithelial-specific antigen (ESA) expression, colony morphology, tumour sphere formation and rapid adherence assays were used to identify the subset of cells with stem-like properties. Apoptosis, cell cycle and expression of various cell cycle checkpoint proteins were assessed (Western Blot, qPCR). The role of G2-checkpoint regulators Chk1 and Chk2 was investigated by use of debromohymenialdisine (DBH) and siRNA.  Results:   In both cancer biopsies and carcinoma cell lines a subset of CD44(high) cells showed increased clonogenicity, a significantly lower rate of apoptosis, and a significantly higher proportion of cells in the G2-phase of the cell cycle. An inverse correlation between the percentage of cells in G2-phase and the rate of apoptosis was found. Pulse-chase with iododeoxyuridine (IdU) demonstrated that CD44(high) carcinoma cells spent longer time in G2, even in un-treated controls. These cells expressed higher levels of G2 checkpoint proteins, and their release from G2 with BDH or Chk1 siRNA increased their rate of apoptosis. Low passage cultures of normal keratinocytes were also found to contain a subset of CD44(high) cells showing increased clonogenicity, and a similar pattern of G2-block associated with apoptotic resistance.  Conclusions:   These data indicate that both normal and malignant human epithelial cells with stem-like properties show greater resistance to apoptosis associated with extended G2 cell cycle phase, and that this property is not a consequence of neoplastic transformation. Targeting G2 checkpoint proteins releases these cells from the G2-block and makes them more prone to apoptosis, implying an opportunity for improved therapeutic approaches.""","""['Lisa J Harper', 'Daniela Elena Costea', 'Luke Gammon', 'Bilal Fazil', 'Adrian Biddle', 'Ian C Mackenzie']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A CD44high/EGFRlow subpopulation within head and neck cancer cell lines shows an epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype and resistance to treatment.', 'Cucurbitacin I suppressed stem-like property and enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis in head and neck squamous carcinoma--derived CD44(+)ALDH1(+) cells.', 'Cancer stem cells enrichment with surface markers CD271 and CD44 in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.', 'α6 Integrin and CD44 enrich for a primary keratinocyte population that displays resistance to UV-induced apoptosis.', 'The paradox of cancer cell apoptosis.', 'Regulation of intestinal stem cell activity by a mitotic cell cycle regulator Polo in Drosophila.', 'Evaluation of correlation between CD44, radiotherapy response, and survival rate in patients with advanced stage of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).', 'Role of cancer stem cells in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma - A systematic review.', 'Using Gold-Nanorod-Filled Mesoporous Silica Nanobeads for Enhanced Radiotherapy of Oral Squamous Carcinoma.', 'Aneuploidy facilitates dysplastic and tumorigenic phenotypes in the Drosophila gut.']"""

To understand the interaction between stroma and glandular epithelia, it is essential to delineate the gene expression profiles of these two tissue types in prostate cancer. Most studies have compared tumor and normal samples by performing global expression analysis using a mixture of cell populations. This report presents the first study of prostate tumor tissue that examines patterns of differential expression between specific cell types using laser capture microdissection (LCM).  Methods:   LCM was used to isolate distinct cell-type populations and identify their gene expression differences using oligonucleotide microarrays. Ten differentially expressed genes were then analyzed in paired tumor and non-neoplastic prostate tissues by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression patterns of the transcription factors, WT1 and EGR1, were further compared in established prostate cell lines. WT1 protein expression was also examined in prostate tissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry.  Results:   The two-step method of laser capture and microarray analysis identified nearly 500 genes whose expression levels were significantly different in prostate epithelial versus stromal tissues. Several genes expressed in epithelial cells (WT1, GATA2, and FGFR-3) were more highly expressed in neoplastic than in non-neoplastic tissues; conversely several genes expressed in stromal cells (CCL5, CXCL13, IGF-1, FGF-2, and IGFBP3) were more highly expressed in non-neoplastic than in neoplastic tissues. Notably, EGR1 was also differentially expressed between epithelial and stromal tissues. Expression of WT1 and EGR1 in cell lines was consistent with these patterns of differential expression. Importantly, WT1 protein expression was demonstrated in tumor tissues and was absent in normal and benign tissues.  Conclusions:   The prostate represents a complex mix of cell types and there is a need to analyze distinct cell populations to better understand their potential interactions. In the present study, LCM and microarray analysis were used to identify novel gene expression patterns in prostate cell populations, including identification of WT1 expression in epithelial cells. The relevance of WT1 expression in prostate cancer was confirmed by analysis of tumor tissue and cell lines, suggesting a potential role for WT1 in prostate tumorigenesis.""","""['Jennifer L Gregg', 'Kathleen E Brown', 'Eric M Mintz', 'Helen Piontkivska', 'Gail C Fraizer']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Distinctive gene expression of prostatic stromal cells cultured from diseased versus normal tissues.', 'Laser-capture microdissection in prostate cancer research: establishment and validation of a powerful tool for the assessment of tumour-stroma interactions.', 'Characterization of a method for profiling gene expression in cells recovered from intact human prostate tissue using RNA linear amplification.', 'Integrating biomedical knowledge to model pathways of prostate cancer progression.', 'Use of laser capture microdissection, cDNA microarrays, and tissue microarrays in advancing our understanding of prostate cancer.', 'The Prostate Stromal Transcriptome in Aggressive and Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Tumor Microenvironment in Prostate Cancer: Toward Identification of Novel Molecular Biomarkers for Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Therapy Development.', 'Research Trends and Regulation of CCL5 in Prostate Cancer.', 'TGF-β-induced IGFBP-3 is a key paracrine factor from activated pericytes that promotes colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Ca2+ as a therapeutic target in cancer.']"""

C/EBPdelta gene transcription is induced during cellular quiescence and repressed during active cell cycle progression. C/EBPdelta exhibits tumor suppressor gene properties including reduced expression in cancer cell lines and tumors and promoter methylation silencing. We previously reported that C/EBPdelta expression is inversely correlated with c-Myc (Myc) expression. Aberrant Myc expression is common in cancer and transcriptional repression is a major mechanism of Myc oncogenesis. A number of tumor suppressor genes are targets of Myc transcriptional repression including C/EBPalpha, p15INK4, p21CIP1, p27KIP1 and p57KIP2. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying Myc repression of C/EBPdelta expression.  Results:   Myc represses C/EBPdelta promoter activity in nontransformed mammary epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner that requires Myc Box II, Basic Region and HLH/LZ domains. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrate that Myc, Miz1 and Max are associated with the C/EBPdelta promoter in proliferating cells, when C/EBPdelta expression is repressed. EMSAs demonstrate that Miz1 binds to a 30 bp region (-100 to -70) of the C/EBPdelta promoter which contains a putative transcription initiator (Inr) element. Miz1 functions exclusively as a repressor of C/EBPdelta promoter activity. Miz1 siRNA expression or expression of a Miz1 binding deficient Myc (MycV394D) construct reduces Myc repression of C/EBPdelta promoter activity. Max siRNA expression, or expression of a Myc construct lacking the HLH/LZ (Max interacting) region, also reduces Myc repression of C/EBPdelta promoter activity. Miz1 and Max siRNA treatments attenuate Myc repression of endogenous C/EBPdelta expression. Myc Box II interacting proteins RuvBl1 (Pontin, TIP49) and RuvBl2 (Reptin, TIP48) enhances Myc repression of C/EBPdelta promoter activity.  Conclusion:   Myc represses C/EBPdelta expression by associating with the C/EBPdelta proximal promoter as a transient component of a repressive complex that includes Max and Miz1. RuvBl1 and RuvBl2 enhance Myc repression of C/EBPdelta promoter activity. These results identify protein interactions that mediate Myc repression of C/EBPdelta, and possibly other tumor suppressor genes, and suggest new therapeutic targets to block Myc transcriptional repression and oncogenic function.""","""['Junling Si', 'Xueyan Yu', 'Yingjie Zhang', 'James W DeWille']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['The mouse C/EBPdelta gene promoter is regulated by STAT3 and Sp1 transcriptional activators, chromatin remodeling and c-Myc repression.', 'Chromatin dynamics at the hTERT promoter during transcriptional activation and repression by c-Myc and Mnt in Xenopus leavis oocytes.', 'Identification and characterization of CCAAT/Enhancer Binding proteindelta (C/EBPdelta) target genes in G0 growth arrested mammary epithelial cells.', 'Structural aspects of interactions within the Myc/Max/Mad network.', 'Of Myc and Mnt.', 'Miz1 promotes KRAS-driven lung tumorigenesis by repressing the protocadherin Pcdh10.', 'A novel network pharmacology approach for leukaemia differentiation therapy using Mogrify®.', 'MTBP and MYC: A Dynamic Duo in Proliferation, Cancer, and Aging.', 'Normal and Neoplastic Growth Suppression by the Extended Myc Network.', 'SOX9 is a critical regulator of TSPAN8-mediated metastasis in pancreatic cancer.']"""

We report our experience with the test in a routine clinical setting and discuss the interpretation of the test results in the context of the individual patient history.  Material and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the data of all patients who received PCA3 determination during a visit to our outpatient clinic between January and June 2008. Prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and (in cases where a biopsy was performed) the biopsy results were collected.  Results:   The PCA3 score was independent of prostate volume and serum PSA. In our study population, 56 men had a negative (<35) and 47 a positive score (≥35). Thirty-two patients were subsequently biopsied, 18 of which were diagnosed with prostate cancer (51%). Patients with a positive biopsy showed significantly higher PCA3 values (p < 0.05). Sensitivity was 94%, specificity was 36% and the negative predictive value was 83%. The area under the curve in the receiver operating characteristics was 0.81 for the PCA3 score and 0.61 for the serum PSA.

Imaging is the fastest growing expense for Medicare but has not been examined among beneficiaries with cancer.  Objective:   To examine changes in the use of imaging and how those changes contribute to the overall cost of cancer care.  Design, setting, and patients:   Analysis of a nationally representative 5% sample of claims from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from 1999 through 2008. Patients were Medicare beneficiaries with incident breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or prostate cancer.  Main outcome measures:   Use and cost of imaging by modality, year, and cancer type.  Results:   There were 100,954 incident cases of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and prostate cancer from 1999 through 2006. Significant mean annual increases in imaging use occurred among all cancer types for positron emission tomography (35.9%-53.6%), bone density studies (6.3%-20.0%), echocardiograms (5.0%-7.8%), magnetic resonance imaging (4.4%-11.5%), and ultrasound (0.7%-7.4%). Conventional radiograph rates decreased or stayed the same. As of 2006, beneficiaries with lung cancer and beneficiaries with lymphoma incurred the largest overall imaging costs, exceeding a mean of $3000 per beneficiary within 2 years of diagnosis. By 2005, one-third of beneficiaries with breast cancer underwent bone scans and half of beneficiaries with lung cancer or lymphoma underwent positron emission tomography scans. Mean 2-year imaging costs per beneficiary increased at a rate greater than the increase in mean total costs per beneficiary for all cancer types.  Conclusion:   Imaging costs among Medicare beneficiaries with cancer increased from 1999 through 2006, outpacing the rate of increase in total costs among Medicare beneficiaries with cancer.""","""['Michaela A Dinan', 'Lesley H Curtis', 'Bradley G Hammill', 'Edward F Patz Jr', 'Amy P Abernethy', 'Alisa M Shea', 'Kevin A Schulman']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""JAMA""","""['Surgical treatment patterns among Medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis.', 'Redistribution of health care costs after the adoption of positron emission tomography among medicare beneficiaries with non-small-cell lung cancer, 1998-2005.', 'Self-reported Function, Health Resource Use, and Total Health Care Costs Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Glaucoma.', 'Interventional pain management at crossroads: the perfect storm brewing for a new decade of challenges.', 'Diagnostic imaging in cancer care.

PSA and hK2, members of the kallikrein family, are elevated in sera of men with prostate cancer. In a comprehensive analysis that included sequencing of all coding, flanking, and 2 kb of putative promoter regions of all 15 kallikrein (KLK) genes spanning approximately 280 kb on chromosome 19q, we identified novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and genotyped 104 SNPs in 1,419 cancer cases and 736 controls in Cancer Prostate in Sweden 1, with independent replication in 1,267 cases and 901 controls in Cancer Prostate in Sweden 2.

A recently discovered selenoprotein, SEP15, which is highly expressed in the prostate, may play a role either independently or by modifying the effects of selenium. We genotyped four common single-nucleotide polymorphisms capturing common variation (frequency >5%; R(2) > 0.8) within SEP15, as well as rs5859 in the 3' untranslated region, previously reported to reduce the efficiency of selenium incorporation into SEP15. We examined the association of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms with PCa risk and PCa-specific mortality, as well as their interactions with plasma selenium levels, in the Physicians' Health Study. In this nested case-control study (1,286 cases and 1,267 controls), SEP15 polymorphisms were not significantly associated with PCa risk. However, among the cases, three variants were significantly associated with PCa-specific mortality [rs479341 hazard ratio (HR), 1.94; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.15-3.25; rs1407131 HR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.45-5.59; rs561104 HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.12-2.11] with a recessive model. Additionally, rs561104 significantly modified the association of plasma selenium with PCa survival (P(interaction) = 0.02); an inverse relationship of high levels of selenium with PCa mortality was apparent only among those without the increased risk genotype. This study provides evidence that SEP15 genetic variation may influence PCa mortality. Additionally, the association of selenium with PCa mortality was modified by a variant, suggesting the possibility that some men with PCa may benefit more from selenium than others, depending on their genotype.""","""['Kathryn L Penney', 'Fredrick R Schumacher', 'Haojie Li', 'Peter Kraft', 'J Steven Morris', 'Tobias Kurth', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'David J Hunter', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Jing Ma']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Is prostate cancer prevention with selenium all in the genes?', 'Association of genetic variations of selenoprotein genes, plasma selenium levels, and prostate cancer aggressiveness at diagnosis.', 'Selenoprotein P genetic variants and mrna expression, circulating selenium, and prostate cancer risk and survival.', 'Selenoprotein and antioxidant genes and the risk of high-grade prostate cancer and prostate cancer recurrence.', 'The influence of selenium and selenoprotein gene variants on colorectal cancer risk.', 'Selenium and cancer: a story that should not be forgotten-insights from genomics.', 'Distinct Roles of SELENOF in Different Human Cancers.', 'The Effects of Selenium on Bone Health: From Element to Therapeutics.', 'Loss of SELENOF Induces the Transformed Phenotype in Human Immortalized Prostate Epithelial Cells.', 'The Interaction between Dietary Selenium Intake and Genetics in Determining Cancer Risk and Outcome.', 'Selenoproteins of the Human Prostate: Unusual Properties and Role in Cancer Etiology.']"""

The specificity of PSA staining enabled optimization of criteria for baseline image intensity, morphometric measurements, and integration of multiple signals in a three-dimensional microfluidic device. In a pilot analysis, we detected CTCs in prostate cancer patients with localized disease, before surgical tumor removal in 8 of 19 (42%) patients (range, 38 to 222 CTCs per milliliter). For 6 of the 8 patients with preoperative CTCs, a precipitous postoperative decline (<24 hours) suggests a short half-life for CTCs in the blood circulation. Other patients had persistent CTCs for up to 3 months after prostate removal, suggesting early but transient disseminated tumor deposits. In patients with metastatic prostate cancer, CTCs were detected in 23 of 36 (64%) cases (range, 14 to 5000 CTCs per milliliter). In previously untreated patients followed longitudinally, the numbers of CTCs declined after the initiation of effective therapy. The prostate cancer-specific TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was detectable in RNA extracted from CTCs from 9 of 20 (45%) patients with metastatic disease, and dual staining of captured CTCs for PSA and the cell division marker Ki67 indicated a broad range for the proportion of proliferating cells among CTCs.

LNCaP prostate tumor cells were initially incubated for 24 h in the presence of oligos (6.25 μM) directed against bcl-2 and compared to lipofectin containing controls. Comparable and significant growth inhibition was produced by both mono- and bispecific forms. Employing RT-PCR to determine the expression of bcl-2, we found that the greatest amount of mRNA suppression approached 100% for each oligo type: monospecific MR4 (directed only against bcl-2), 100%; and bispecifics MR24 and MR42, 86 and 100%, respectively. We conclude, based upon both inhibition of in vitro growth and bcl-2 expression, that bispecific antisense oligos directed against EGFR and bcl-2 mRNAs are at least as effective as a monospecific directed solely toward bcl-2. In an effort to determine a compensatory response by cells evading apoptosis in the presence of bcl-2 suppression, the levels of mRNA encoding the non-targeted apoptosis activating protein bax were evaluated. Non-targeted protein suppression by these bispecifics has previously been demonstrated against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). However, in contrast to effects against bcl-2 and PSMA, no significant alteration in bax expression was produced by either oligo type. In LNCaP cells, bcl-2 suppression does not influence bax expression and, at least for this protein, there is no compensatory change in bax expression regulating apoptosis at this level. Identifying changes in the expression of proteins which regulate apoptosis is important if gene therapy targets bcl-2.""","""['Marvin Rubenstein', 'Courtney M P Hollowell', 'Patrick Guinan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['Effects of BCL-2 suppression by antisense oligonucleotides on additional regulators of apoptosis compensatory change in non-targeted protein expression.', 'Differentiated prostatic antigen expression in LNCaP cells following treatment with bispecific antisense oligonucleotides directed against BCL-2 and EGFR.', 'Bispecific antisense oligonucleotides having binding sites directed against an autocrine regulated growth pathway and bcl-2 for the treatment of prostate tumors.', 'Increased prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in LNCaP cells following treatment with bispecific antisense oligonucleotides directed against bcl-2 and EGFR.', 'Bispecific antisense oligonucleotides have activity comparable to monospecifics in inhibiting expression of BCL-2 in LNCaP cells.', 'In LNCaP cells enhanced expression of both androgen receptor and costimulatory protein p300 compensate for antisense oligonucleotide suppression of bcl-2.', 'Compensatory and non-compensatory effects on protein expression following BCL-2 suppression by antisense oligonucleotides.']"""

This tumor has been classified according to the prevalent pattern of growth as adenoid cystic carcinoma or basaloid cell carcinoma (BCC), with the former growth pattern being considered to be the main feature of this entity. A 67-year-old Japanese man was admitted to a general hospital with obstructive urinary symptoms. His prostate was slightly enlarged, stony hard, and with a rough surface on digital rectal examination, while serum prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase concentrations were within the normal ranges (0.007 and 0.9 ng/mL, respectively). 2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) exhibited multiple accumulations suspicious for cancer metastases. Specimens obtained by prostatic needle biopsy showed immunohistochemical reactivity for cytokeratin 34βE12 and P63, findings that were identical to those seen in basal cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma of the prostate is a rare tumor, reported in 56 cases so far, and among all these, the pure form of BCC is extremely rare.

These cancers are frequently associated with cancer pain especially after bone metastasis. It is well known that transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) participates in cancer pain. The present study aims to demonstrate that the tumor tissue-derived endogenous formaldehyde induces bone cancer pain via TRPV1 activation under tumor acidic environment.  Methodology/principal findings:   Endogenous formaldehyde concentration increased significantly in the cultured breast cancer cell lines in vitro, in the bone marrow of breast MRMT-1 bone cancer pain model in rats and in tissues from breast cancer and lung cancer patients in vivo. Low concentrations (1 approximately 5 mM) of formaldehyde induced pain responses in rat via TRPV1 and this pain response could be significantly enhanced by pH 6.0 (mimicking the acidic tumor microenvironment). Formaldehyde at low concentrations (1 mM to 100 mM) induced a concentration-dependent increase of [Ca(2+)]i in the freshly isolated rat dorsal root ganglion neurons and TRPV1-transfected CHO cells. Furthermore, electrophysiological experiments showed that low concentration formaldehyde-elicited TRPV1 currents could be significantly potentiated by low pH (6.0).

The causal relationship of XMRV infection to human disease and the mechanism of pathogenicity have not been established. During retrovirus replication, integration of the cDNA copy of the viral RNA genome into the host cell chromosome is an essential step and involves coordinated joining of the two ends of the linear viral DNA into staggered sites on target DNA. Correct integration produces proviruses that are flanked by a short direct repeat, which varies from 4 to 6 bp among the retroviruses but is invariant for each particular retrovirus. Uncoordinated joining of the two viral DNA ends into target DNA can cause insertions, deletions, or other genomic alterations at the integration site. To determine the fidelity of XMRV integration, cells infected with XMRV were clonally expanded and DNA sequences at the viral-host DNA junctions were determined and analyzed. We found that a majority of the provirus ends were correctly processed and flanked by a 4-bp direct repeat of host DNA. A weak consensus sequence was also detected at the XMRV integration sites.

Therefore, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed for this disease. Capsaicin, the active ingredient of chilli peppers, displays anti-proliferative activity in prostate and epidermoid cancer in vitro. However, the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin has not been studied in human SCLCs. The present manuscript fills this void of knowledge and explores the anti-proliferative effect of capsaicin in SCLC in vitro and in vivo.  Methodology/principal findings:   BrdU assays and PCNA ELISAs showed that capsaicin displays robust anti-proliferative activity in four human SCLC cell lines. Furthermore, capsaicin potently suppressed the growth of H69 human SCLC tumors in vivo as ascertained by CAM assays and nude mice models. The second part of our study attempted to provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin. We found that the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin is correlated with a decrease in the expression of E2F-responsive proliferative genes like cyclin E, thymidylate synthase, cdc25A and cdc6, both at mRNA and protein levels. The transcription factor E2F4 mediated the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin. Ablation of E2F4 levels by siRNA methodology suppressed capsaicin-induced G1 arrest. ChIP assays demonstrated that capsaicin caused the recruitment of E2F4 and p130 on E2F-responsive proliferative promoters, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation.

We hypothesized that gene silencing mediated through aberrant promoter methylation of upstream Wnt antagonist genes might result in beta-catenin accumulation, resulting in constitutive Wnt activation. Wnt antagonist genes (SFRP1, WIF1, APC and CDH1) and CTNNB1 promoter methylation was examined in genomic DNA extracted from 12 urological cancer cell lines and correlated with CTNNB1 mRNA expression. Promoter methylation status was then assessed in 36 BCa, 30 PCa, 31 RCT, and normal bladder mucosa (15), prostate (10) and renal (5) tissue samples. Finally, CTNNB1 mRNA relative expression levels were correlated with Wnt antagonist gene methylation status in RCT. Methylation was found in at least one Wnt antagonist gene and the CTNNB1 promoter was unmethylated in all cancer cell lines tested. When gene methylation levels were compared between cancer cell lines with high and low CTNNB1 mRNA expression, a trend was found for increased CDH1 promoter methylation levels in the former. BCa and PC a tumors demonstrated high frequency of promoter methylation at all tested genes. In RCT, CTNNB1 was unmethylated in all cases and the overall frequency of promoter methylation at the remainder genes was lower. Interestingly, median CTNNB1 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in RCTs methylated in at least one Wnt antagonist gene promoter.

Of those, 189 patients (27%) were using statins, either during initial consultation or during follow-up. Lipid panels were collected (n = 298) a median of 5 months before RT start. Median follow-up was 50 months after RT.  Results:   Statin use was associated with improved freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF; P < .001), freedom from salvage androgen deprivation therapy (FFADT; P = .0011), and relapse-free survival (RFS; P < .001). Improved FFBF for statin users was seen in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups (P = .0401, P = .0331, and P = .0034, respectively). The improvement in FFBF with statin use was independent of ADT use or radiation dose. On multivariable analysis, statin use was associated with improved FFBF (P < .001) along with pretreatment prostate-specific antigen < or = 8.4 (P < .001), stage less than T2b (P = .0111), and Gleason score < 7 (P = .0098). On univariate analysis, pretreatment total cholesterol < 187 (89% v 80%; P = .0494) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) < 110 (96% v 85%; P = .0462) were associated with improved 4-year FFBF.  Conclusion:   Statin use was associated with a significant improvement in FFBF, FFADT, and RFS in this cohort of men treated with RT for prostate cancer. The favorable effect of statins may be mediated by direct effect or via the LDL-lowering effect of these medications.""","""['Ruchika Gutt', 'Nathan Tonlaar', 'Rangesh Kunnavakkam', 'Theodore Karrison', 'Ralph R Weichselbaum', 'Stanley L Liauw']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Statin use and the risk of prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radiation therapy with or without hormone therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: time to trial statins?', 'Smoking, obesity, and statin therapy in the prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'Statins in the prevention of prostate cancer recurrence: are certain biases exaggerating the results?', 'Beeinflusst die Einnahme von Statinen das Behandlungsergebnis der Strahlentherapie beim Prostatakarzinom?', 'PSA nadir of <0.5 ng/mL following brachytherapy for early-stage prostate adenocarcinoma is associated with freedom from prostate-specific antigen failure.', 'Prolongation of total treatment time because of infrequently missed days of treatment is not associated with inferior biochemical outcome after dose-escalated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of race on biochemical disease recurrence after prostate brachytherapy.', 'Clinical Potential of Statins in Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Association between statin usage and prostate cancer prevention: a refined meta-analysis based on literature from the years 2005-2010.', 'Serum Paraoxonase-1 Activity in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Brachytherapy as a Measure of Irradiation Efficacy.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Association of Statin Use with the Risk of Incident Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.', 'Advances and development of prostate cancer, treatment, and strategies: A systemic review.', 'Modulation of radiosensitivity of DU145 prostate carcinoma cells by simvastatin.']"""

Patients and methods:   Three hundred prostate cancer patients participating in the Dutch randomized trial (CKTO 69-10) comparing 68 Gy with 78 Gy were the subject of this analysis. These patients filled out the SF-36 QoL questionnaire before radiotherapy (baseline) and 6, 12, 24, and 36 months thereafter. Changes in QoL over time of ≥10 points were considered clinically relevant. Repeated-measures regression analyses were applied to estimate and test the QoL changes over time, the differences between the two arms, and for association with a number of covariates.  Results:   At 3-year follow-up, the summary score physical health was 73.2 for the 68-Gy arm vs. 71.6 for the 78-Gy arm (p = 0.81), and the summary score mental health was 76.7 for the 68-Gy arm vs. 76.1 for the 78-Gy arm (p = 0.97). Statistically significant (p < 0.01) deterioration in QoL scores over time was registered in both arms in six scales. The deterioration over time was more pronounced in the high-dose arm for most scales. However, clinically relevant deterioration (>10 points) was seen for only two scales. None of the tested covariates were significantly correlated with QoL scores.  Conclusion:   Dose escalation did not result in significant deterioration of QoL in prostate cancer patients. In both randomization arms, statistically significant decreases in QoL scores over time were seen in six scales. The deterioration of QoL was more pronounced in the physical than in the mental health domain and in some scales more in the high- than in the low-dose arm, but the differences between arms were not statistically significant.""","""['Abrahim Al-Mamgani', 'Wim L J van Putten', 'Gerard J van der Wielen', 'Peter C Levendag', 'Luca Incrocci']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Rectal dose-volume histogram parameters are associated with long-term patient-reported gastrointestinal quality of life after conventional and high-dose radiation for prostate cancer: a subgroup analysis of a randomized trial.', 'Long-term failure patterns and survival in a randomized dose-escalation trial for prostate cancer.

We present the results of a study to characterize prostate metabolic activity during the PSA ""bounce"" and to correlate metabolic changes with PSA levels using three-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (3D-MRSI).  Methods and materials:   3D-MRSI was performed in 24 patients during the PSA bounce. Eight of these had also had a baseline 3D-MRSI scan before BT for the purpose of tumor mapping. The 3D-MRSI was repeated at 6- and 12-month intervals, and PSA levels were monitored every 3 months. Twenty-one of the patients had favorable-risk prostate cancer, and 3 had intermediate risk.  Results:   The choline+creatine signal intensity, although markedly reduced, was observable following BT. Diffuse activity not corresponding to original biopsy-positive sites was observed in 22 cases, and 2 cases were documented to have local recurrence. No statistically significant correlation between metabolic activity and PSA levels at each interval was found.  Conclusion:   Post-BT prostate 3D-MRSI shows evidence of diffuse metabolic activity unrelated to residual malignancy. This supports the benign nature of the PSA bounce and suggests an inflammatory etiology. In the situation of a rising PSA, observation of focal activity on MRI/3D-MRSI could be a useful adjunct to suggest local recurrence at an earlier interval after brachytherapy when prostate biopsies would still be unhelpful. Longer follow-up is necessary to confirm the complex relationship between metabolic activity and PSA levels.""","""['Anna Kirilova', 'Andrei Damyanovich', 'Juanita Crook', 'John Jezioranski', 'Kris Wallace', 'Melania Pintilie']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""[]"""

Here, we show that MELK protein is restricted to proliferating cells derived from either cancer or normal tissues and that MELK protein level is severely decreased concomitantly with other cell cycle proteins in cells which exit the cell cycle.

CRPC cells are able to grow in a low androgen environment and this is associated with anomalous activity of their endogenous androgen receptor (AR) despite the low systemic androgen levels in the patients. Therefore, the reactivated tumor cell androgen signaling pathway is thought to provide a target for control of CRPC. Previously, we reported that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling was conditionally activated by androgen deprivation in androgen sensitive prostate cancer cells and here we studied the potential for cross-talk between Hh and androgen signaling activities in androgen deprived and androgen independent (AI) prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Treatment of a variety of androgen-deprived or AI prostate cancer cells with the Hh inhibitor, cyclopamine, resulted in dose-dependent modulation of the expression of genes that are regulated by androgen. The effect of cyclopamine on endogenous androgen-regulated gene expression in androgen deprived and AI prostate cancer cells was consistent with the suppressive effects of cyclopamine on the expression of a reporter gene (luciferase) from two different androgen-dependent promoters. Similarly, reduction of smoothened (Smo) expression with siRNA co-suppressed expression of androgen-inducible KLK2 and KLK3 in androgen deprived cells without affecting the expression of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA or protein. Cyclopamine also prevented the outgrowth of AI cells from androgen growth-dependent parental LNCaP cells and suppressed the growth of an overt AI-LNCaP variant whereas supplemental androgen (R1881) restored growth to the AI cells in the presence of cyclopamine. Conversely, overexpression of Gli1 or Gli2 in LNCaP cells enhanced AR-specific gene expression in the absence of androgen. Overexpressed Gli1/Gli2 also enabled parental LNCaP cells to grow in androgen depleted medium. AR protein co-immunoprecipitates with Gli2 protein from transfected 293T cell lysates.  Conclusions:   Collectively, our results indicate that Hh/Gli signaling supports androgen signaling and AI growth in prostate cancer cells in a low androgen environment. The finding that Gli2 co-immunoprecipitates with AR protein suggests that an interaction between these proteins might be the basis for Hedgehog/Gli support of androgen signaling under this condition.""","""['Mengqian Chen', 'Michael A Feuerstein', 'Elina Levina', 'Prateek S Baghel', 'Richard D Carkner', 'Matthew J Tanner', 'Michael Shtutman', 'Francis Vacherot', 'Stéphane Terry', 'Alexandre de la Taille', 'Ralph Buttyan']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Androgenic regulation of hedgehog signaling pathway components in prostate cancer cells.', 'Non-canonical activation of hedgehog in prostate cancer cells mediated by the interaction of transcriptionally active androgen receptor proteins with Gli3.', 'TAK-441, a novel investigational smoothened antagonist, delays castration-resistant progression in prostate cancer by disrupting paracrine hedgehog signaling.', 'Experimental evidence of persistent androgen-receptor-dependency in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor signaling and mutations in prostate cancer.', 'Genetic alterations in MED12 promote castration-resistant prostate cancer through modulation of GLI3 signaling.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'GLI3 Is Stabilized by SPOP Mutations and Promotes Castration Resistance via Functional Cooperation with Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer.', 'Hedgehog signal disruption, gonadal dysgenesis and reproductive disorders: Is there a link to endocrine disrupting chemicals?']"""

In this study we propose a fully automated segmentation method that tackles this limitation and tested the method with our CADx system when discriminating prostate cancer from benign areas in the peripheral zone. A method was developed to automatically segment normal peripheral zone tissue (PZ). Context based segmentation using the Otsu histogram based threshold selection method and by Hessian based blob detection, was developed to automatically select PZ as reference tissue for the per patient calibration. In 38 consecutive patients carcinoma, benign and normal tissue were annotated on MR images by a radiologist and a researcher using whole mount step-section histopathology as standard of reference. A feature set comprising pharmacokinetic parameters was computed for each ROI and used to train a support vector machine (SVM) as classifier. In total 42 malignant, 29 benign and 37 normal regions were annotated. The diagnostic accuracy obtained for differentiating malignant from benign lesions using a conventional general patient plasma profile showed an accuracy of 0.65 (0.54-0.76). Using the automated segmentation per patient calibration method the diagnostic value improved to 0.80 (0.71-0.88), whereas the manual segmentation per patient calibration showed a diagnostic performance of 0.80 (0.70-0.90).

The globally optimal surfaces can be simultaneously achieved by solving a maximum flow problem based on an arc-weighted graph representation. Representing the segmentation problem in an arc-weighted graph, one can incorporate a wider spectrum of constraints into the formulation, thus increasing segmentation accuracy and robustness in volumetric image data.

This principle is used to design image (dis)similarity metrics, such as sum of squared differences (SSD) or mutual information (MI). This assumption is strongly violated, for instance, within specific regions of images from abdominal or pelvic section of a patient taken at two different time points. Nevertheless, in some clinical applications, it is required to compute a smooth deformation field for all the regions within the image including the boundaries of such regions. In this paper, we propose a deformable registration method, which utilizes a priori intensity distributions of the regions delineated on one of the images to devise a new similarity measure that varies across regions of the image to establish a smooth and robust deformation field. We present validation results of the proposed method in mapping bladder, prostate, and rectum contours of computer tomography (CT) volumes of 10 patients taken for prostate cancer radiotherapy treatment planning and verification.""","""['Ali Khamene', 'Darko Zikic', 'Mamadou Diallo', 'Thomas Boettger', 'Eike Rietzel']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv""","""['Object-constrained meshless deformable algorithm for high speed 3D nonrigid registration between CT and CBCT.', 'Automatic segmentation of intra-treatment CT images for adaptive radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'A 3D global-to-local deformable mesh model based registration and anatomy-constrained segmentation method for image guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Deformable registration for image-guided radiation therapy.', 'Automated delineation of radiotherapy volumes: are we going in the right direction?']"""

A statistical motion model (SMM) of the prostate is first built using training data provided by biomechanical simulations of the motion of a patient-specific finite element model, derived from a preoperative MR image. The SMM is then registered to a 3D TRUS image by maximising the likelihood of the shape of an SMM instance given a voxel-intensity-based feature, which represents an estimate of normal vector at the surface of the prostate gland. Using data acquired from 7 patients, the accuracy of registering T2 MR to 3D TRUS images was evaluated using anatomical landmarks inside the gland.

Prostate tracking makes it possible to overcome several drawbacks of the current standard transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy procedure, namely the insufficient targeting accuracy which may lead to a biopsy distribution of poor quality, the very approximate knowledge about the actual location of the sampled tissues which makes it difficult to implement focal therapy strategies based on biopsy results, and finally the difficulty to precisely reach non-ultrasound (US) targets stemming from different modalities, statistical atlases or previous biopsy series. The prostate tracking systems presented so far are limited to rigid transformation tracking. However, the gland can get considerably deformed during the intervention because of US probe pressure and patient movements. We propose to use 3D US combined with image-based elastic registration to estimate these deformations. A fast elastic registration algorithm that copes with the frequently occurring US shadows is presented. A patient cohort study was performed, which yielded a statistically significant in-vivo accuracy of 0.83 +/- 0.54 mm.""","""['Michael Baumann', 'Pierre Mozer', 'Vincent Daanen', 'Jocelyne Troccaz']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv""","""['Prostate biopsy tracking with deformation estimation.', 'Towards 3D ultrasound image based soft tissue tracking: a transrectal ultrasound prostate image alignment system.', 'Evaluation of inter-session 3D-TRUS to 3D-TRUS image registration for repeat prostate biopsies.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'A review of 3D/2D registration methods for image-guided interventions.', 'Comparison of Elastic and Rigid Registration during Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-Guided Prostate Biopsy: A Multi-Operator Phantom Study.', 'Follow-up of negative MRI-targeted prostate biopsies: when are we missing cancer?', 'Mixed reality ultrasound guidance system: a case study in system development and a cautionary tale.', 'Development and Phantom Validation of a 3-D-Ultrasound-Guided System for Targeting MRI-Visible Lesions During Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.', 'Target detection: magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion-guided prostate biopsy.']"""

More recent developments have made possible 3D localization of the implanted radioactive seeds. This is usually modeled as an assignment problem and solved by resolving the correspondence of seeds. It is, however, NP-hard, and the problem is even harder in practice due to the significant number of hidden seeds. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can find an optimal solution from multiple projection images with hidden seeds. It solves an equivalent problem with reduced dimensional complexity, thus allowing us to find an optimal solution in polynomial time. Simulation results show the robustness of the algorithm. It was validated on 5 phantom and 18 patient datasets, successfully localizing the seeds with detection rate of > or = 97.6% and reconstruction error of < or = 1.2 mm.

In an effort to optimize IGRT, we developed a fast segmentation-registration-segmentation framework to accurately and efficiently delineate the clinically critical objects in Cone Beam CT images obtained during radiation treatment. The proposed framework started with deformable models automatically segmenting the prostate, bladder, and rectum in planning CT images. All models were built around seed points and involved in the CT image under the influence of image features using the level set formulation. The deformable models were then converted into meshless point sets and underwent a 3D non rigid registration from the planning CT to the treatment CBCT. The motion of deformable models during the registration was constrained by the global shape prior on the target surface during the deformation. The meshless formulation provided a convenient interface between deformable models and the image feature based registration method. The final registered deformable models in the CBCT domain were further refined using the interaction between objects and other available image features. The segmentation results for 15 data sets has been included in the validation study, compared with manual segmentations by a radiation oncologist. The automatic segmentation results achieved a satisfactory convergence with manual segmentations and met the speed requirement for on line IGRT.""","""['Ting Chen', 'Sung Kim', 'Jinghao Zhou', 'Dimitris Metaxas', 'Gunaretnam Rajagopal', 'Ning Yue']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv""","""['Object-constrained meshless deformable algorithm for high speed 3D nonrigid registration between CT and CBCT.', 'A 3D global-to-local deformable mesh model based registration and anatomy-constrained segmentation method for image guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Automatic segmentation of intra-treatment CT images for adaptive radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'A review of segmentation and deformable registration methods applied to adaptive cervical cancer radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Automated delineation of radiotherapy volumes: are we going in the right direction?', 'Automatic Segmentation of Teeth, Crown-Bridge Restorations, Dental Implants, Restorative Fillings, Dental Caries, Residual Roots, and Root Canal Fillings on Orthopantomographs: Convenience and Pitfalls.', 'CT male pelvic organ segmentation using fully convolutional networks with boundary sensitive representation.', 'A combined learning algorithm for prostate segmentation on 3D CT images.', 'A Learning-Based CT Prostate Segmentation Method via Joint Transductive Feature Selection and Regression.', 'Prostate Segmentation in CT Images via Spatial-Constrained Transductive Lasso.']"""

Pioneer trials have been conducted using DC generated in research conditions. There is now a need for generating DC in clinical grade conditions, including the use of closed systems, avoidance of FCS and respect of good manufacturing practices (GMP).  Methods:   DC were generated from 84 leukapheresis products of 27 cancer patients enrolled in two Phase I/II trials of vaccination of either MAGE+tumors (n = 24) or prostate cancer (n = 3). Monocytes were seeded in culture bags in a serum-free medium supplemented with IL-4 and GM-CSF. After a 7 day culture, DC were collected and most were pulsed with various MAGE-derived peptides.  Results:   After a short leukapheresis (mean time: 66 min; mean processed blood: 5 L), a mean of 6 x 10(9) WBC were collected, from which 2.25 x 10(9) were seeded. The culture procedure yielded a large number of DC (mean: 62 x 10(6) DC) harboring the expected phenotype of immature DC (CD1a(+) CD14(-) HLA-DR(+) CD80(+) CD86(+) CD83(-)). This phenotype was not altered by peptide loading. These DC, either fresh or thawed, were functionally effective invitro. Their s.c. and i.v. injections were devoid of any short-term side effect and associated with the induction of immune responses in the patients.  Discussion:   Large numbers of functional immature clinical grade DC can be generated in a closed system from leukapheresis products in cancer patients. These results provide the basis for large-scale studies of cancer immunotherapy under improved safety conditions.""","""['M Toungouz', 'C Quinet', 'E Thille', 'S Fourez', 'O Pradier', 'J P Delville', 'T Velu', 'M Lambermont']""","""[]""","""1999""","""None""","""Cytotherapy""","""['Large-scale immunomagnetic selection of CD14+ monocytes to generate dendritic cells for cancer immunotherapy: a phase I study.', 'Development of a clinical-scale method for generation of dendritic cells from PBMC for use in cancer immunotherapy.', 'Clinical-scale generation of dendritic cells in a closed system.', 'Generation of large numbers of fully mature and stable dendritic cells from leukapheresis products for clinical application.', 'Dendritic cell based vaccines: progress in immunotherapy studies for prostate cancer.', 'Equine dendritic cells generated with horse serum have enhanced functionality in comparison to dendritic cells generated with fetal bovine serum.']"""
