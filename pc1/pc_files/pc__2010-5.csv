We aimed to assess the effect of warfarin on histological grade and clinical stage of prostate cancer at diagnosis.  Methods:   We carried out a retrospective population-based cohort study of men older than 50 years of age diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1985 and 2002 and registered with the Saskatchewan Cancer Registry. We compared a composite score of histological grade and clinical stage of prostate cancer at diagnosis according to warfarin use in the 5 years preceding the diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Results:   Compared with non-users, men with at least 2 years of cumulative warfarin use in the 5 year period preceding the diagnosis of prostate cancer were at a lower risk of a poor prognosis composite score at the time of their prostate cancer diagnosis (OR 0.40, 95%CI (0.19-0.83)), and when intermediate and poor prognosis scores were combined, a similar estimate of association was observed (OR 0.55, 95%CI (0.33-0.91)), adjusted for age at diagnosis and year of diagnosis. However, an increased risk of poor prognosis disease was observed with 4 years of cumulative warfarin use compared to never use (OR 2.2, 95%CI (1.03-4.81)).  Conclusions:   There is a suggestion that at least 2 years of warfarin use is associated with a more favourable prognosis but that extended duration of use beyond 2 years may be associated with poor prognosis disease. Further investigation with a more complete assessment of confounders and that addresses potential detection biases is warranted.""","""['V Tagalakis', 'H Tamim']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf""","""['Validating a method that deals with missing drug information in the Saskatchewan Drug Plan database.', 'Risk of prostate cancer death in long-term users of warfarin: a population-based case-control study.', 'Use of warfarin and risk of urogenital cancer: a population-based, nested case-control study.', 'Prostate cancer and the Will Rogers phenomenon.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

The inhibition of cytochrome P450-17 (CYP17) to block androgen biosynthesis is therefore regarded as a promising approach to therapy. Based on our previously identified lead compound Ref 1, a series of fluorine-substituted biphenyl methylene imidazoles were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as CYP17 inhibitors to elucidate the influence of fluorine on in vitro and in vivo activity. It was found that meta-fluoro substitution at the C ring improved activity, whereas ortho substitution decreased potency. Docking studies performed with our human CYP17 homology model suggest the presence of multipolar interactions between fluorine and Arg109, Lys231, His235, and Glu305. As expected, introduction of fluorine also prolonged the half-life in plasma. The SARs obtained confirm the reliability of the protein model; compound 9 (IC(50)=131 nM) was identified as a strong CYP17 inhibitor, showing potent activity in rat, high bioavailability, and a long plasma half-life: 12.8 h.""","""['Qingzhong Hu', 'Matthias Negri', 'Sureyya Olgen', 'Rolf W Hartmann']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""ChemMedChem""","""['Synthesis, biological evaluation, and molecular modeling studies of methylene imidazole substituted biaryls as inhibitors of human 17alpha-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase (CYP17)--part II: Core rigidification and influence of substituents at the methylene bridge.', 'Replacement of imidazolyl by pyridyl in biphenylmethylenes results in selective CYP17 and dual CYP17/CYP11B1 inhibitors for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'CYP17 inhibitors.

Prior to implementing VMAT into their clinical routine in December 2008, the authors evaluated the dose calculation/delivery accuracy of 24 sample VMAT plans (prostate and anal cancer target paradigms) with film and ionization dosimetry. After the start of the clinical program, in vivo measurements with a rectal probe were performed.  Material and methods:   The VMAT plans were generated by the treatment-planning system (TPS) ERGO++ (Elekta, Crawley, UK) and transferred to a phantom. Film dosimetry was performed with Kodak EDR2 films, and evaluated with dose profiles and gamma-index analysis. Appropriate ionization chambers were used for absolute dose measurements in the phantom and for in vivo measurements. The ionization chamber was used with localization of the measurement volume based on positioning cone-beam computed tomography.  Results:   Plans were transferred from ERGO++ to the record and verify (R&V) system/linear accelerator (linac). The absolute dose deviations recorded with the ionization chamber were 1.74% +/- 1.62% across both indications. The gamma-index analysis of the film dosimetry showed no deviation > 3%/3 mm in the high-dose region. On in vivo measurements, a deviation between calculation and measurement of 2.09% +/- 2.4% was recorded, when the chamber was successfully positioned in the high-dose region.  Conclusion:   VMAT plans can be planned and treated reproducibly in high quality after the commissioning of the complete delivery chain consisting of TPS, R&V system and linac. The results of the individual plan verification meet the commonly accepted requirements. The first in vivo measurements confirm the reproducible precision of the delivered dose during clinical treatments.""","""['Dirk Wolff', 'Florian Stieler', 'Brigitte Hermann', 'Katharina Heim', 'Sven Clausen', 'Jens Fleckenstein', 'Martin Polednik', 'Volker Steil', 'Frederik Wenz', 'Frank Lohr']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Feasibility of single-isocenter, multi-arc non-coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy for multiple brain tumors using a linear accelerator with a 160-leaf multileaf collimator: a phantom study.', 'Quality of treatment plans and accuracy of in vivo portal dosimetry in hybrid intensity-modulated radiation therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative evaluation of 3D dosimetry for stereotactic volumetric-modulated arc delivery using COMPASS.', 'Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'An Investigation of Radiation Treatment Learning Opportunities in Relation to the Radiation Oncology Electronic Medical Record: A Single Institution Experience.', 'Volumetric intensity-modulated arc therapy vs. 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for primary chemoradiotherapy of anal carcinoma: Effects on treatment-related side effects and survival.', 'Visualization of data in radiotherapy using web services for optimization of workflow.', 'Target volume coverage and dose to organs at risk in prostate cancer patients.

This study aimed to use a computerized docking approach to examine the interactions between the human AR and phyto-oestrogens (genistein, daidzein, and flavone) and xeno-oestrogens (bisphenol A, 4-nonylphenol, dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane [DDT], diethylstilbestrol [DES]). The predicted three-dimensional structure of AR and androgens was established using X-ray diffraction. The binding of four xeno-oestrogens and three phyto-oestrogens to AR was analysed. The steroids estradiol and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were used as positive controls and thyroxine as negative control. All the ligands shared the same binding site except for thyroxine. The endogenous hormones DHT and 17beta-oestradiol showed the strongest binding with the lowest affinity energy (< -10 kcal mol(-1)). All three phyto-oestrogens and two xeno-oestrogens (bisphenol A and DES) showed strong binding to AR. The affinities of flavone, genistein, and daidzein were between -8.8 and -8.5 kcal mol(-1), while that of bisphenol A was -8.1 kcal mol(-1) and DES -8.3 kcal mol(-1). Another two xeno-oestrogens, 4-nonylphenol and DDT, although they fit within the binding domain of AR, showed weak affinity (-6.4 and -6.7 kcal mol(-1), respectively).

Incidence of urinary side-effects, as well as related modalities of radiotherapy, is poorly described in the literature. Medline literature searches were performed via PubMed using the keywords ""bladder--radiotherapy--toxicity--radiation cystitis--tolerability--organ at risk"" to describe urinary side-effects due to radiation. Some recommendations exist on the dose constraints applied to bladder. These were mainly established from prostate radiation therapy studies but without definitive consensus. In clinical practice, dose constraints take into account clinical settings: bladder cancer which requires total bladder irradiation or others pelvic tumours (prostate, uterus...) in which the bladder is considered as an organ at risk. Risks of radiation cystitis increase with total dose (above 60 Gy), bladder irradiated volume and concomitant chemoradiation.

In addition, possible implications of using digital reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), based on the MAR CT images, for setup verification were analyzed. A phantom and 15 patients with different tumor sites and implanted markers were imaged with a multislice CT scanner. The raw image data was reconstructed both with the clinically used filtered-backprojection (FBP) and with the MAR software. Using the MAR software, improvements in image quality were often observed in CT slices with markers or clips. Especially when several markers were located near to each other, fewer streak artefacts were observed than with the FBP algorithm. In addition, the shape and size of markers could be identified more accurately, reducing the contoured marker volumes by a factor of 2. For the phantom study, the CT numbers measured near to the markers corresponded more closely to the expected values. However, the MAR images were slightly more smoothed compared with the images reconstructed with FBP. For 8 prostate cancer patients in this study, the interobserver variation in 3D marker definition was similar (<0.4 mm) when using DRRs based on either FBP or MAR CT scans. Automatic marker matches also showed a similar success rate. However, differences in automatic match results up to 1 mm, caused by differences in the marker definition, were observed, which turned out to be (borderline) statistically significant (p = 0.06) for 2 patients. In conclusion, the MAR software might improve image quality by suppressing metal artefacts, probably allowing for a more reliable delineation of structures. When implanted markers or clips are used for setup verification, the accuracy may slightly be improved as well, which is relevant when using very tight clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margins for planning.""","""['Iskandar Kassim', 'Hans Joosten', 'Jaco C Barnhoorn', 'Ben J M Heijmen', 'Maarten L P Dirkx']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['The application of metal artifact reduction (MAR) in CT scans for radiation oncology by monoenergetic extrapolation with a DECT scanner.', 'Changes realized from extended bit-depth and metal artifact reduction in CT.', 'Metal artifact reduction software used with abdominopelvic dual-energy CT of patients with metal hip prostheses: assessment of image quality and clinical feasibility.', 'Metallic implants and CT artefacts in the CTV area: Where are we in 2020?', 'Megavoltage CT images of helical tomotherapy unit for radiation treatment simulation: impact on feasibility of treatment planning in a prostate cancer patient with bilateral femoral prostheses.', 'Positioning errors of metal localization devices with motion artifacts on kV and MV cone beam CT.', 'Fiducial markers visibility and artefacts in prostate cancer radiotherapy multi-modality imaging.', 'Using C-Arm X-ray images from marker insertion to confirm the gold fiducial marker identification in an MRI-only prostate radiotherapy workflow.', 'Computed tomography imaging parameters for inhomogeneity correction in radiation treatment planning.', 'Evaluation of a metal artifact reduction algorithm in CT studies used for proton radiotherapy treatment planning.']"""

Objective:   This study investigated the effectiveness, pharmacokinetics, and safety profile of a 1-month leuprolide acetate 3.75-mg depot formulation for suppressing testosterone concentrations in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   This was a Phase III, open-label, international multicenter clinical trial. Patients with prostate cancer who, in the judgment of the investigators, could benefit from androgen deprivation therapy received 6 monthly intramuscular injections of leuprolide acetate 3.75-mg depot. Plasma testosterone concentrations were determined at specific times throughout the study. The primary end point was the proportion of successful patients over the total number of evaluable patients (ie, patients with evaluable testosterone concentrations at all monthly assessments and no missing values due to treatment-related adverse events). Treatment success was defined as testosterone suppression below the clinical castration level (ie, <or=0.5 ng/mL) at day 28 and maintenance of clinical castration until study completion (day 168). The frequency of patients with testosterone concentrations <or=0.2 ng/mL was also studied.  Results:   The study included 160 patients with a mean (SD) age of 71.6 (9.2) years, weight of 83.7 (15.5) kg, and predominantly white race (87.5% [140/160]). All 160 patients received at least one dose of study drug; 157 of them were fully evaluable, and 152 completed the study. The proportion of successful patients over the total number of evaluable patients was 96.8% (152/157; 95% CI,92.7%-99.0%). Five of the 157 evaluable patients (3.2%) did not achieve the primary end point of testosterone concentration <or=0.5 ng/mL by day 28. Of the evaluable patients, 78.7% (122/155) achieved testosterone suppression by day 21. By day 28, 96.8% (151/156) of the evaluable patients had achieved castrate levels, and 73.1% (114/156) achieved testosterone concentrations <0.2 ng/mL. At study end, 100% (152/152) of the patients completing the study maintained castrate levels, and 92.8% (141/152) had testosterone concentrations <or=0.2 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetic profile of leuprolide during the first 3 months of treatment, evaluated in a subset of the study population (n = 12), showed sustained release of leuprolide from the formulation. Values for AUC(0-t) calculated from day 0 to day 28, days 28 to 56, and days 56 to 84 were 25,976.5 (7892.0), 30,685.5 (9348.4), and 31,030.9 (10,745.0) pg/mL per day, respectively.

This improvement is possible by controlling the dose delivery process, characterized by pretreatment quality control results. So, it is necessary to put under control portal dosimetry measurements (currently, the ionisation chamber measurements were already monitored by statistical process control thanks to statistical process control tools). The second objective was to state whether it is possible to substitute ionisation chamber with portal dosimetry in order to optimize time devoted to pretreatment quality control.  Patients and methods:   At Alexis-Vautrin center, pretreatment quality controls in IMRT for prostate and head and neck treatments were performed for each beam of each patient. These controls were made with an ionisation chamber, which is the reference detector for the absolute dose measurement, and with portal dosimetry for the verification of dose distribution. Statistical process control is a statistical analysis method, coming from industry, used to control and improve the studied process quality. It uses graphic tools as control maps to follow-up process, warning the operator in case of failure, and quantitative tools to evaluate the process toward its ability to respect guidelines: this is the capability study. The study was performed on 450 head and neck beams and on 100 prostate beams.  Results:   Control charts, showing drifts, both slow and weak, and also both strong and fast, of mean and standard deviation have been established and have shown special cause introduced (manual shift of the leaf gap of the multileaf collimator). Correlation between dose measured at one point, given with the EPID and the ionisation chamber has been evaluated at more than 97% and disagreement cases between the two measurements were identified.  Conclusion:   The study allowed to demonstrate the feasibility to reduce the time devoted to pretreatment controls, by substituting the ionisation chamber's measurements with those performed with EPID, and also that a statistical process control monitoring of data brought security guarantee.""","""['N Villani', 'K Gérard', 'V Marchesi', 'S Huger', 'P François', 'A Noël']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Fast, daily linac verification for segmented IMRT using electronic portal imaging.', 'Replacing pretreatment verification with in vivo EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT.', 'A literature review of electronic portal imaging for radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'Radiotherapy quality assurance by individualized in vivo dosimetry: state of the art.', 'Preliminary study on monitoring patient-specific volumetric modulated arc therapy quality assurance process with statistical process control methodology on the basis of TG-218 report.', 'Clinical examples of 3D dose distribution reconstruction, based on the actual MLC leaves movement, for dynamic treatment techniques.']"""

Methods:   Sixty-nine patients underwent a history, physical, CPS, and prostate biopsy. Patients with a negative or prostate-only positive signal and a positive biopsy were offered CSAP. Success was defined as a postsalvage nadir PSA of ≤ 0.4 ng/mL. Patients who failed were followed to establish when they required ADT. The results were compared with the putative results of applying clinical parameters alone. Patients were considered high-risk if they had any of the following characteristics: stage T3B-T4, Gleason ≥ 4 + 3, PSADT ≤ 10 months or presalvage PSA > 10 ng/mL.  Results:   Twelve patients (6 with metastatic signal and 6 with negative biopsy) were excluded. Fifty-seven patients underwent CSAP. Overall 67% were successfully treated. Pre-salvage PSA was significantly associated with success (P = .013). Using clinical risk alone, only 14 patients achieved success compared with 38 using our algorithm. Most of the patients (75%) avoided ADT over a period of 21 months.  Conclusions:   Using our algorithm with CPS and prostate biopsy enabled us to spare some low-risk patients the undue morbidity of local salvage procedures that are likely to fail, while offering selected high-risk patients the opportunity for cure, avoiding premature ADT.

An understanding of the molecular events in conjunction with the genetic networks affected by Par-4 is warranted.  Results:   Colon cancer specimens derived from patients have significantly diminished expression of Par-4 mRNA relative to paired normal colon. Hence, the functional consequences of reintroducing Par-4 into HT29 colon cancer cells were assessed. Overexpression augmented the interaction of Par-4 with NF kappaB in the cytosol but not nucleus, and facilitated apoptosis in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Analogous findings were obtained when AKT1 pro-survival signaling was inhibited. Transcriptome profiling identified approximately 700 genes differentially regulated by Par-4 overexpression in HT29 cells. Nearly all Par-4-regulated genes were shown by promoter analysis to contain cis-binding sequences for NF kappaB, and meta-analysis of patient expression data revealed that one-third of these genes exist as a recurrent co-regulated network in colon cancer specimens. Sets of genes involved in programmed cell death, cell cycle regulation and interestingly the microRNA pathway were found overrepresented in the network. Noteworthy, Par-4 overexpression decreased NF kappaB occupancy at the promoter of one particular network gene DROSHA, encoding a microRNA processing enzyme. The resulting down-regulation of DROSHA was associated with expression changes in a cohort of microRNAs. Many of these microRNAs are predicted to target mRNAs encoding proteins with apoptosis-related functions. Western and functional analyses were employed to validate several predictions. For instance, miR-34a up-regulation corresponded with a down-regulation of BCL2 protein. Treating Par-4-overexpressing HT29 cells with a miR-34a antagomir functionally reversed both BCL2 down-regulation and apoptosis by 5-FU. Conversely, bypassing Par-4 overexpression by direct knockdown of DROSHA expression in native HT29 cells increased miR-34a expression and 5-FU sensitivity.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that the initiation of apoptotic sensitivity in colon cancer cells can be mediated by Par-4 binding to NF kappaB in the cytoplasm with consequential changes in the expression of microRNA pathway components.""","""['Bi-Dar Wang', 'Christina Leah B Kline', 'Danielle M Pastor', 'Thomas L Olson', 'Bryan Frank', 'Truong Luu', 'Arun K Sharma', 'Gavin Robertson', 'Matthew T Weirauch', 'Steven R Patierno', 'Joshua M Stuart', 'Rosalyn B Irby', 'Norman H Lee']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['The pro-apoptotic protein Prostate Apoptosis Response Protein-4 (Par-4) can be activated in colon cancer cells by treatment with Src inhibitor and 5-FU.', 'The Akt inhibitor ISC-4 activates prostate apoptosis response protein-4 and reduces colon tumor growth in a nude mouse model.', 'Melatonin synergizes the chemotherapeutic effect of 5-fluorouracil in colon cancer by suppressing PI3K/AKT and NF-κB/iNOS signaling pathways.', 'Therapeutic microRNAs targeting the NF-kappa B signaling circuits of cancers.', 'BCL2A1: the underdog in the BCL2 family.', '7S,15R-Dihydroxy-16S,17S-epoxy-docosapentaenoic Acid Overcomes Chemoresistance of 5-Fluorouracil by Suppressing the Infiltration of Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Inhibiting the Activation of Cancer Stem Cells in a Colorectal Cancer Xenograft Model.', 'Expression profiling of anticancer genes in colorectal cancer patients and their in vitro induction by riproximin, a ribosomal inactivating plant protein.', 'Arylquin 1 (Potent Par-4 Secretagogue) Inhibits Tumor Progression and Induces Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells.', 'EVs delivery of miR-1915-3p improves the chemotherapeutic efficacy of oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer.', 'Roles of miRNAs in Colorectal Cancer: Therapeutic Implications and Clinical Opportunities.']"""

In this paper, we address the challenge of selecting a relevant and manageable subset of genes from a large microarray dataset. Currently, most gene selection methods focus on identifying a set of genes that can further improve classification accuracy. Few or none of these small sets of genes, however, are biologically relevant (i.e. supported by medical evidence). To deal with this critical issue, we propose two novel methods that can identify biologically relevant genes concerning cancers.  Results:   In this paper, we propose two novel techniques, entitled random forest gene selection (RFGS) and support vector sampling technique (SVST). Compared with results from six other methods developed in this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that RFGS and SVST can identify more biologically relevant genes in patients with leukemia or prostate cancer. Among the top 25 genes selected using SVST method, 15 genes were biologically relevant genes in patients with leukemia and 13 genes were biologically relevant genes in patients with prostate cancer. Meanwhile, the RFGS method, while less effective than SVST, still identified an average of 9 biologically relevant genes in both leukemia and prostate cancers. In contrast to traditional statistical methods, which only identify less than 8 genes in patients with leukemia and less than 8 genes in patients with prostate cancer, our methods yield significantly better results.  Conclusions:   Our proposed SVST and RFGS methods are novel approaches that can identify a greater number of biologically relevant genes. These methods have been successfully applied to both leukemia and prostate cancers. Research in the fields of biology and medicine should benefit from the identification of biologically relevant genes by confirming recent discoveries in cancer research or suggesting new avenues for exploration.""","""['Austin H Chen', 'Yin-Wu Tsau', 'Ching-Heng Lin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Accurate molecular classification of cancer using simple rules.', 'Detecting biomarkers from microarray data using distributed correlation based gene selection.', 'Cross-platform analysis of cancer microarray data improves gene expression based classification of phenotypes.', 'Sequence databases and microarrays as tools for identifying prostate cancer biomarkers.', 'Discovery of prostate cancer biomarkers by microarray gene expression profiling.', 'An ensemble machine learning model based on multiple filtering and supervised attribute clustering algorithm for classifying cancer samples.', 'Reversal of multidrug resistance in leukemia cells using a transferrin-modified nanomicelle encapsulating both doxorubicin and psoralen.', 'Fast approximate inference for variable selection in Dirichlet process mixtures, with an application to pan-cancer proteomics.', 'Identification of DNA methylation prognostic signature of acute myelocytic leukemia.', 'Detection approaches for multidrug resistance genes of leukemia.']"""

We propose two space oriented classes of heuristic algorithms for integrating ranked lists from omic scale data. These algorithms are either Borda inspired or Markov chain based that take the underlying spaces of the individual ranked lists into account explicitly.

Patients and methods:   Grayscale imaging of the prostate is the standard method for diagnostic evaluation and biopsy guidance. Color Doppler (CD) imaging, including CD and power Doppler US, allows for detection of macrovascularity and may therefore be helpful for assessment of prostatic blood flow. The use of US microbubbles for CD imaging and new contrast-specific techniques enable assessment of prostate microvascularity associated with prostate cancer (PCa). Recently, real-time elastography has been introduced to improve detection of cancer based upon changes in tissue stiffness.  Results:   Contrast-enhanced CD imaging has shown to enable PCa detection by performing targeted biopsies into suspicious areas. Comparisons between systematic and contrast-enhanced targeted biopsies have shown that the targeted approach detects more cancers and cancers with higher Gleason scores with a reduced number of biopsy cores. New microbubble-specific US techniques can improve sensitivity and specificity of US imaging for PCa detection. Real-time elastography has been demonstrated to be useful for the detection of PCa, and may further improve PCa staging.

This study shows that restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine (Tyr/Phe), glutamine (Gln), or methionine (Met) differentially modulates glucose metabolism, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), p53, and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in these two cell lines. In DU145 cells, Gln and Met restriction increase glucose consumption, but Tyr/Phe restriction does not. Addition of glucose to culture media diminishes cell death induced by Tyr/Phe-restriction. Addition of pyruvate reduces cell death due to Tyr/Phe and Gln restriction. Tyr/Phe, Gln and Met restriction increase phosphorylation of GSK3beta-Ser(9), phosphorylation of p53-Ser(15) and reduce the mitochondrial localization of PDH. Addition of glucose or pyruvate to cultures significantly reverses the alterations in GSK3beta, p53 and PDH induced by amino acid restriction. In p53-null PC3 cells, Tyr/Phe, Gln and Met restriction decreases glucose consumption, reduces phosphorylation of Akt-Ser(473), and increases phosphorylation of GSK3beta-Ser(9). Addition of pyruvate or glucose reduces death of Met-restricted cells. Addition of glucose increases phosphorylation of Akt-Ser(473) in amino acid-restricted cells reduces phosphorylation of GSK3beta-Ser(9) in Tyr/Phe and Gln restricted cells and increases phosphorylation of GSK3beta-Ser(9) in Met restricted cells. Addition of pyruvate reduces phosphorylation of GSK3beta-Ser(9) in all amino acid-restricted cells. In summary, cell death induced by specific amino acid restriction is dependent on or closely related to the modulation of glucose metabolism. GSK3beta (DU145 and PC3) and p53 (DU145) are crucial switches connecting metabolism and these signaling molecules to cell survival during amino acid restriction.""","""['Ya-Min Fu', 'Huimin Lin', 'Xiaoyi Liu', 'Weigang Fang', 'Gary G Meadows']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Specific amino acid dependency regulates invasiveness and viability of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Selective amino acid restriction targets mitochondria to induce apoptosis of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Selective amino acid restriction differentially affects the motility and directionality of DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Specificity of the suppression of metastatic phenotype by tyrosine and phenylalanine restriction.', 'Specific amino acid dependency regulates the cellular behavior of melanoma.', 'Ovarian Cancer and Glutamine Metabolism.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling reveal the p53-dependent benzeneacetic acid attenuation of silica-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human bronchial epithelial cells.', 'JMJD2B-induced amino acid alterations enhance the survival of colorectal cancer cells under glucose-deprivation via autophagy.', 'Effects of RhoA and RhoC upon the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to glutamine deprivation.']"""

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels were lower in RWPE2 cells but VDR over-expression did not increase vitamin-D-mediated gene transcription in either cell line. In contrast, MAPK inhibition restored normal vitamin D transcriptional responses in RWPE2 cells and MAPK activation with constitutively active MEK1R4F reduced vitamin-D-regulated transcription in RWPE1 cells. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated transcription depends upon the VDR and its heterodimeric partner the retinoid X receptor (RXR) so we studied whether changes in the VDR-RXR transcription complex occur in response to MAPK activation. Mutation of putative phosphorylation sites in the activation function 1 (AF-1) domain (S32A, T82A) of RXRalpha restored 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated transactivation in RWPE2 cells. Mammalian two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed a vitamin-D-independent interaction between steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC-1) and RXRalpha that was reduced by MAPK activation and was restored in RWPE2 cells by mutating S32 and T82 in the RXRalpha AF-1 domain. Our data show that a common contributor to cancer development, prolonged activation of MAPK signaling, impairs 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated transcription in prostate epithelial cells.

In the present study, data from the Fukui Prefecture cancer registry, which is the most accurate in Japan, were used to observe trends in incidence and mortality rates.  Methods:   Cancer incidence and mortality rates from 1984 through 2004 were obtained from the Fukui Prefecture cancer registry. Joinpoint analysis developed for the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program was used to compute and graphically present annual percentage changes in age-adjusted incidence and mortality in Fukui Prefecture.  Results:   On joinpoint analysis, there were slight increases in incidence at all cancer sites combined for both sexes from 1986, but the trend was not significant in Fukui. Mortality in women appeared to significantly decrease, while mortality in men, which had been increasing until 1999, began to significantly decrease thereafter. In an analysis by anatomical site, both the incidence and mortality of stomach cancer significantly decreased in both sexes.

In late stage human lung adenocarcinoma, TAMs exhibited mixed M1 (classical; argI(low)iNOS(high)) and M2 (alternative; argI(high)iNOS(low)) polarization based on arginine metabolism. In several murine cancer models including chemically and genetically-induced primary lung tumors, prostate tumors, colon xenografts, and lung metastases, TAMs expressed argI(high)iNOS(low) early during tumor formation; argI(low)iNOS(high) polarization also occurred during malignancy in some models. In a chemically-induced lung tumor model, macrophages expressed argI(high)iNOS(low) within one week after carcinogen treatment, followed by similar polarization of bone marrow-derived monocytes (BDMCs) a few days later. TAMs surrounding murine prostate tumors also expressed argI(high)iNOS(low) early during tumorigenesis, indicating that this polarization is not unique to neoplastic lungs. In a human colon cancer xenograft model, the primary tumor was surrounded by argI(high)iNOS(low)-expressing TAMs, and BDMCs also expressed argI(high)iNOS(low), but pulmonary macrophages adopted argI(high)iNOS(low) polarization only after tumors metastasized to the lungs. Persistence of tumors is required to maintain TAM polarization. Indeed, in both conditional mutant Kras- and FGF10-driven models of lung cancer, mice expressing the transgene develop lung tumors that regress rapidly when the transgene is silenced. Furthermore, pulmonary macrophages expressed argI(high)iNOS(low) on tumor induction, but then returned to argI(low) iNOS(low) (no polarization) after tumors regressed. Manipulating TAM function or depleting TAMs may provide novel therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating many types of cancer.""","""['Elizabeth F Redente', 'Lori D Dwyer-Nield', 'Daniel T Merrick', 'Komal Raina', 'Rajesh Agarwal', 'William Pao', 'Pamela L Rice', 'Kenneth R Shroyer', 'Alvin M Malkinson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Differential polarization of alveolar macrophages and bone marrow-derived monocytes following chemically and pathogen-induced chronic lung inflammation.', 'Oct4 promotes M2 macrophage polarization through upregulation of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in lung cancer.', 'Modulatory effects of adiponectin on the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages.', 'A narrative review of tumor-associated macrophages in lung cancer: regulation of macrophage polarization and therapeutic implications.', 'Biological Effects of Nanoparticles on Macrophage Polarization in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Modulation of miR-146b by N6-methyladenosine modification remodels tumor-associated macrophages and enhances anti-PD-1 therapy in colorectal cancer.', 'M2-TAMs promote immunoresistance in lung adenocarcinoma by enhancing METTL3-mediated m6A methylation.', 'Live or Heat-Killed Lactobacillus rhamnosus Aerosolization Decreases Adenomatous Lung Cancer Development in a Mouse Carcinogen-Induced Tumor Model.', 'Gut Microbiota and Tumor Immune Escape: A New Perspective for Improving Tumor Immunotherapy.', 'Macrophage Polarization and Reprogramming in Acute Inflammation: A Redox Perspective.']"""

The impact of common cancer therapies on extracellular release of Hsp72 however, has been to date undefined.  Materials and methods:   Serum from 13 patients undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) for prostate cancer with or without hormonal therapy (ADT) was measured for levels of circulating serum Hsp72 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) using the classical sandwich ELISA technique and the relative expression of CD8(+) T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells was measured using flow cytometry. Mouse orthotopic xenograft of human prostate cancer tumors (DU-145 and PC-3) were used to validate and further characterize the response noted in the clinical setting. The biological significance of tumor released Hsp72 was studied in human dendritic cells (DC) in vitro.  Results:   Circulating serum Hsp72 levels increased an average of 3.5-fold (median per patient 4.8-fold) with XRT but not with ADT (p=0.0002). Increases in IL-6 (3.3-fold), TNF-alpha (1.8-fold), CD8(+) CTL (2.1-fold) and NK cells (3.2-fold) also occurred. Using PC-3 and DU-145 human prostate cancer xenograft models in mice, we confirmed that XRT induces Hsp72 release primarily from implanted tumors. In vitro studies using supernatant recovered from irradiated human prostate cancer cells point to exosomes containing Hsp72 as a possible stimulator of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and costimulatory molecules expression in human DC.  Conclusions:   The current study confirms for the first time in an actual clinical setting elevation of circulating serum Hsp72 with XRT. The accompanying studies in mice and in vitro identify the released exosomes containing Hsp72 as playing a pivotal role in stimulating pro-inflammatory immune responses. These findings, if validated, may lead to new treatment paradigms for common human malignancies.""","""['Mark D Hurwitz', 'Punit Kaur', 'Ganachari M Nagaraja', 'Maria A Bausero', 'Judith Manola', 'Alexzander Asea']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Tumor necrosis factor gene-engineered J558 tumor cell-released exosomes stimulate tumor antigen P1A-specific CD8+ CTL responses and antitumor immunity.', 'Membrane-bound HSP70-engineered myeloma cell-derived exosomes stimulate more efficient CD8(+) CTL- and NK-mediated antitumour immunity than exosomes released from heat-shocked tumour cells expressing cytoplasmic HSP70.', 'Effects of temperature-humidity index and chromium supplementation on antioxidant capacity, heat shock protein 72, and cytokine responses of lactating cows.', 'Hsp72 release: mechanisms and methodologies.', 'Mechanisms of stress-induced cellular HSP72 release: implications for exercise-induced increases in extracellular HSP72.', 'Effect of radiotherapy on the DNA cargo and cellular uptake mechanisms of extracellular vesicles.', 'The Potential Role of Exosomal Proteins in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Footprint of Exosomes in the Radiation-Induced Bystander Effects.', 'Mechanism and clinical value of exosomes and exosomal contents in regulating solid tumor radiosensitivity.', 'Association of Radiotherapy-Related Intestinal Injury and Cancer-related Fatigue: A Brief Review and Commentary.']"""

Methods:   A total of 20 patients were evaluated intraoperatively with a mobile CBCT unit immediately after implantation while still anesthetized. The source detector system was enclosed in a circular CT-like geometry with a bore that accommodates patients in the lithotomy position. After seed deposition, the CBCT scans were obtained. The dosimetry was evaluated and compared with the standard postimplantation CT-based assessment. In 8 patients, the deposited seeds were localized in the intraoperative CBCT frame of reference and registered to the intraoperative transrectal ultrasound images. With this information, a second intraoperative plan was generated to ascertain whether additional seeds were needed to achieve the planned prescription dose. The final dosimetry was compared with the postimplantation scan assessment.  Results:   The mean differences between the dosimetric parameters from the intraoperative CBCT and postimplant CT scans were < .5% for percentage of volume receiving 100% of the prescription dose, minimal dose received by 90% of the prostate, and percentage of volume receiving 150% of the prescription dose. The minimal dose received by 5% (maximal dose) of the urethra differed by 8% on average and for the rectum an average difference of approximately 18% was observed. After fusion of the implanted seed coordinates from the intraoperative CBCT scans to the intraoperative transrectal ultrasound images, the dosimetric outcomes were not significantly different from the postimplantation CT dosimetric results.

In contrast, little is known about the effects of ibandronate on prostate cancer cells. Therefore the aim of our study was to characterize the effects of ibandronate alone and in combination with docetaxel on the growth of prostate cancer cell lines and to identify the underlying signalling pathways. Material and methods. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 were treated with increasing concentrations of ibandronate and docetaxel alone and in combination. Viable cell number was measured after five days using a hemocytometer and the MTT-method. The effects of ibandronate were tentatively antagonized by addition of farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP) or farnesol (FOH). Results. Ibandronate inhibits growth of both prostate cancer cell lines in a dose dependent manner. In combination with docetaxel, synergistic effects are found as evidenced by a combination index (CI) of <1. Addition of FOH and FPP completely antagonized the growth inhibitory effects of ibandronate on both cell lines. Surprisingly, in combination with ibandronate and docetaxel, FOH further increased growth inhibition instead of antagonizing the growth inhibitory effects of ibandronate. Furthermore, FOH alone appeared to be a potent inhibitor of tumor cell growth. Discussion. Ibandronate effectively inhibits growth of prostate cancer cell lines via inhibition of the farnesyl-IPP-synthase and exhibits synergistic effects with docetaxel. In addition, FOH is a potent inhibitor of prostate cancer cell lines and may display an interesting treatment option for patients with CRPC.""","""['Robin Epplen', 'Michael Stöckle', 'Udo Engelmann', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'Carsten-Henning Ohlmann']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Additive/synergistic antitumoral effects on prostate cancer cells in vitro following treatment with a combination of docetaxel and zoledronic acid.', 'Docetaxel/zoledronic acid combination triggers apoptosis synergistically through downregulating antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein level in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells.', 'Genistein combined polysaccharide enhances activity of docetaxel, bicalutamide and Src kinase inhibition in androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Expert opinion on chemotherapy use in castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.', 'Targeting the mercapturic acid pathway and vicenin-2 for prevention of prostate cancer.', 'An Approach to Minimize Tumour Proliferation by Reducing the Formation of Components for Cell Membrane.', 'Potential Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Cancer Properties of Farnesol.', 'Docetaxel: a review of its use for the first-line treatment of advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Mitogenic actions of leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone in a variety of cancer cell types have been identified. We have investigated the proliferative effects of leptin on human prostate cancer cells and assessed the role of tyrosine kinase signalling in mediating these actions.  Materials and methods:   Two human androgen-resistant prostate cancer cell lines and one androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line were treated with leptin (5-100 ng / mL) for up to 48 hours. Under serum-free conditions, cell proliferation was measured using an enzyme-linked colorimetric assay. Furthermore, phosphorylation of a downstream component of MAPK (ERK1 / 2) was detected by Western blotting and a specific inhibitor of MAPK (PD98059; 40 microM) was used to evaluate the role of this signalling pathway.  Results:   Leptin dose-dependently increased the cell number in both androgen-resistant cell lines after 24 h and 48 h of incubation (percent of control: DU145 = 194.6 +/- 5.9 %, PC-3 = 177.9 +/- 6.8 %; 100 ng / mL leptin; 48 h; p < 0.001). Conversely, leptin's proliferative effect on the androgen-sensitive cell line was less pronounced (percent of control: LNCaP = 112.3 +/- 6.1 %; 100 ng / mL leptin; 48 h). Leptin also caused dose-dependent ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation in both androgen-resistant cell lines. In addition, pre-treatment with PD98059 inhibited these responses and attenuated leptin's mitogenic action.  Conclusions:   Data from this in vitro study suggest an association between obesity-associated hyperleptinemia and an increased risk for prostate cancer.

Likewise, all currently available energy ablative techniques must be compared with respect to safety and efficacy; this is only possible by histologic definition of the treated target. Finally, not only for academic reasons, the malignant entity of the treated mass must be known for further follow-up investigations, especially when insufficient ablation is suggested during follow-up-suggested by lack of shrinkage and persisting contrast enhancement on CT or MRI. Therefore, liberal use of renal mass biopsy (Bx) is mandatory before any focal therapy. There is some role for intraoperative biopsy in selected cases and for study purposes.

On the other hand, the current alternative, active surveillance, carries risk of progression as well as some psychological and healthcare burdens. Focal treatment may be an acceptable alternative: in aiming to destroy only the areas of prostate cancer, focal therapy could deliver cancer control while at the same time avoid damage to surrounding structures. This may reduce incontinence, impotence, and rectal toxicity. Improvements in localization of cancer such as template transperineal prostate-mapping biopsies as well as state-of-the-art imaging such as multiparametric MRI and novel ultrasound-based tissue characterization tools have made the delivery of focal therapy possible. Minimally invasive ablative technologies such as cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, or radiofrequency interstitial tumor ablation can precisely treat to within a few millimeters.

In this study, the goal is to develop automated methods that combine the pharmacokinetic parameters derived from dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI with quantitative T2 MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in contrast to most of the studies which were performed with human readers. The main advantages of the automated methods are that the observer variability is removed and easily reproducible results can be efficiently obtained when the methods are applied to a test data. The goal is also to compare the performance of automated supervised and unsupervised methods for prostate cancer localization with multispectral MRI.  Methods:   The authors use multispectral MRI data from 20 patients with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer patients, and the image set consists of parameters derived from T2, DWI, and DCE-MRI. The authors utilize large margin classifiers for prostate cancer segmentation and compare them to an unsupervised method the authors have previously developed. The authors also develop thresholding schemes to tune support vector machines (SVMs) and their probabilistic counterparts, relevance vector machines (RVMs), for an improved performance with respect to a selected criterion. Moreover, the authors apply a thresholding method to make the unsupervised fuzzy Markov random fields method fully automatic.  Results:   The authors have developed a supervised machine learning method that performs better than the previously developed unsupervised method and, additionally, have found that there is no significant difference between the SVM and RVM segmentation results. The results also show that the proposed methods for threshold selection can be used to tune the automated segmentation methods to optimize results for certain criteria such as accuracy or sensitivity. The test results of the automated algorithms indicate that using multispectral MRI improves prostate cancer segmentation performance when compared to single MR images, a result similar to the human reader studies that were performed before.  Conclusions:   The automated methods presented here can help diagnose and detect prostate cancer, and improve segmentation results. For that purpose, multispectral MRI provides better information about cancer and normal regions in the prostate when compared to methods that use single MRI techniques; thus, the different MRI measurements provide complementary information in the automated methods.

While such a system would prevent possible image distortion resulting from relative motion between the magnet and the linac, the rotation of the magnet around the patient can itself introduce possibilities for image distortion that need to be addressed. While there are straightforward techniques in the literature for correcting distortions from gradient nonlinearities and nonuniform magnetic fields during image reconstruction, the correction of distortions related to tissue magnetic susceptibility is more complex. This work investigates the extent of this latter distortion type under the regime of a rotating magnetic field.  Methods:   CT images covering patient anatomy in the head, lung, and male pelvic regions were obtained and segmented into components of air, bone, and soft tissue. Each of these three components was assigned bulk magnetic susceptibility values in accordance with those found in the literature. A finite-difference algorithm was then implemented to solve for magnetic field distortion maps should the anatomies be placed in the uniform polarizing field of an MR system. The algorithm was repeated multiple times as the polarizing field was rotated axially about the virtual patient in 15 degrees increments. In this way, a map of maximum distortion, and the range of distortion as the magnetic field is rotated about each anatomical region could be determined. The consequence of these susceptibility distortions in terms of geometric signal shift was calculated for 0.2 T, as well as another low-field system (0.5 T), and a higher field 1.5 T system for comparison, using the assumption of a frequency encoding gradient strength of 5 mT/m.  Results:   At 0.2 T, the susceptibility-related distortion was limited to less than 0.5 mm given an encoding gradient strength of 5 mT/m or higher. To maintain this same level of geometric accuracy, the 0.5 T system would require a moderately higher minimum gradient strength of 11 mT/m, and at a typical MR field strength of 1.5 T this minimum gradient strength would increase to 33 mT/m. The influence of magnetic susceptibility on mean frequency shift as the field orientation was rotated was also investigated and found to account for less than half a millimeter at 1.5 T, and negligible for low-field systems.  Conclusions:   A study of three sites (head, lung, and prostate) that are vulnerable to magnetic susceptibility-related distortions were studied, and showed that in the context of a rotating polarizing magnet, low-field systems can maintain geometric accuracy of 0.5 mm with at most moderate limitations on sequence parameters. This conclusion will likely apply only to endogenous tissues, as implanted materials such as titanium can create field distortions much in excess of what may normally be induced in the body.

Localization of the biopsy core requires accurate segmentation of the biopsy needle and needle tip from transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy images. A temporal-based TRUS needle segmentation algorithm was developed specifically for the prostate biopsy procedure to automatically identify the TRUS image containing the biopsy needle from a collection of 2D TRUS images and to segment the biopsy-core location from the 2D TRUS image.  Methods:   The temporal-based segmentation algorithm performs a temporal analysis on a series of biopsy TRUS images collected throughout needle insertion and withdrawal. Following the identification of points of needle insertion and retraction, the needle axis is segmented using a Hough transform-based algorithm, which is followed by a temporospectral TRUS analysis to identify the biopsy-needle tip. Validation of the temporal-based algorithm is performed on 108 TRUS biopsy sequences collected from the procedures of ten patients. The success of the temporal search to identify the proper images was manually assessed, while the accuracies of the needle-axis and needle-tip segmentations were quantitatively compared to implementations of two other needle segmentation algorithms within the literature.  Results:   The needle segmentation algorithm demonstrated a >99% accuracy in identifying the TRUS image at the moment of needle insertion from the collection of real-time TRUS images throughout the insertion and withdrawal of the biopsy needle. The segmented biopsy-needle axes were accurate to within 2.3 +/- 2.0 degrees and 0.48 +/- 0.42 mm of the gold standard. Identification of the needle tip to within half of the biopsy-core length (<10 mm) was 95% successful with a mean error of 2.4 +/- 4.0 mm. Needle-tip detection using the temporal-based algorithm was significantly more accurate (p < 0.001) than the other two algorithms tested, while the segmentation of the needle axis was not significantly different between the three algorithms.  Conclusions:   The temporal-based needle segmentation algorithm accurately segments the location of the biopsy core from 2D TRUS images of clinical prostate biopsy procedures. The results for needle-tip localization demonstrated that the temporal-based algorithm is significantly more accurate than implementations of some existing needle segmentation algorithms within the literature.""","""['Derek W Cool', 'Lori Gardi', 'Cesare Romagnoli', 'Manale Saikaly', 'Jonathan I Izawa', 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Needle segmentation using 3D Hough transform in 3D TRUS guided prostate transperineal therapy.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Prostate biopsy techniques and indications: when, where, and how?', 'Ultrasound for prostate imaging and biopsy.', 'Automatic needle detection using improved random sample consensus in CT image-guided lung interstitial brachytherapy.']"""

Methods:   The approach requires the use of an anatomical atlas which is built by computing transformation fields mapping a set of manually segmented images to a common reference. These transformation fields are then applied to the manually segmented structures of the training set in order to get a probabilistic map on the atlas. The segmentation is then realized through a two stage procedure. In the first stage, the processed image is registered to the probabilistic atlas. Subsequently, a probabilistic segmentation is obtained by mapping the probabilistic map of the atlas to the patient's anatomy. In the second stage, a deformable surface evolves toward the prostate boundaries by merging information coming from the probabilistic segmentation, an image feature model and a statistical shape model. During the evolution of the surface, the probabilistic segmentation allows the introduction of a spatial constraint that prevents the deformable surface from leaking in an unlikely configuration.  Results:   The proposed method is evaluated on 36 exams that were manually segmented by a single expert. A median Dice similarity coefficient of 0.86 and an average surface error of 2.41 mm are achieved.

The method allows to automatically correct for inter or intrafraction motion.  Methods:   Intratreatment MV projection images are acquired during each of five treatment beams of prostate cancer patients with four implanted fiducial markers. The projection images are first preprocessed using a series of marker enhancing filters. 2D candidate marker locations are generated for each of the filtered projection images and 3D candidate marker locations are reconstructed by pairing candidates in subsequent projection images. The correct marker positions are retrieved in 3D by the minimization of a cost function that combines 2D image intensity and 3D geometric or shape information for the entire marker configuration simultaneously. This optimization problem is solved using dynamic programming such that the globally optimal configuration for all markers is always found. Translational interfraction and intrafraction prostate motion and the required patient repositioning is assessed from the position of the centroid of the detected markers in different MV image pairs. The method was validated on a phantom using CT as ground-truth and on clinical data sets of 16 patients using manual marker annotations as ground-truth.  Results:   The entire setup was confirmed to be accurate to around 1 mm by the phantom measurements. The reproducibility of the manual marker selection was less than 3.5 pixels in the MV images. In patient images, markers were correctly identified in at least 99% of the cases for anterior projection images and 96% of the cases for oblique projection images. The average marker detection accuracy was 1.4 +/- 1.8 pixels in the projection images. The centroid of all four reconstructed marker positions in 3D was positioned within 2 mm of the ground-truth position in 99.73% of all cases. Detecting four markers in a pair of MV images takes a little less than a second where most time is spent on the image preprocessing.  Conclusions:   The authors have developed a method to automatically detect multiple markers in a pair of projection images that is robust, accurate, and sufficiently fast for clinical use. It can be used for kV, MV, or mixed image pairs and can cope with limited motion between the projection images.""","""['Pieter Slagmolen', 'Jeroen Hermans', 'Frederik Maes', 'Tom Budiharto', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Frank van den Heuvel']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Real-time automatic fiducial marker tracking in low contrast cine-MV images.', 'Simultaneous MV-kV imaging for intrafractional motion management during volumetric-modulated arc therapy delivery.', 'Automatic tracking of arbitrarily shaped implanted markers in kilovoltage projection images: a feasibility study.', 'Dynamic targeting image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Computer-assisted reconstruction and motion analysis of the three-dimensional cell.', 'Recommendation of fiducial marker implantation for better target tracking using MV imager in prostate radiotherapy.', 'Development and clinical evaluation of automatic fiducial detection for tumor tracking in cine megavoltage images during volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'A method for robust segmentation of arbitrarily shaped radiopaque structures in cone-beam CT projections.']"""

The ideal dosimeter would be implanted inside the planning treatment volume so that it can directly measure the total delivered dose during each fraction with no additional uncertainty due to calculation models. The aim of this work is to verify if implantable metal oxide semiconductors field effect transistors (MOSFETs) can achieve a sufficient degree of dosimetric accuracy when used inside extracranial targets undergoing radiotherapy treatments using the Cyberknife system.  Methods:   Based on the preliminary findings of this study, new prototypes for high dose fractionations were developed to reduce the time dependence for long treatment delivery times. These dosimeters were recently cleared and are marketed as DVS-HFT. Multiple measurements were performed using both Virtual Water and water phantoms to characterize implantable MOSFETs under the Cyberknife beams, and included the reference-dosimetry consistency, the dependence of the response on the collimator size, on the daily delivered dose, and the time irradiation modality. Finally a Cyberknife prostate treatment simulation using a body phantom was conducted, and both MOSFET and ionization readings were compared to Monte Carlo calculations. The feasibility analysis was conducted based on the ratios of the absorbed dose divided by the dose reading, named as ""further calibration factor"" (FCF).  Results:   The average FCFs resulted to be 0.98 for the collimator dependence test, and about 1.00 for the reference-dosimetry test, the dose-dependence test, and the time-dependence test. The average FCF of the prostate treatment simulation test was 0.99.  Conclusions:   The obtained results are well within DVS specifications, that is, the factory calibration is still valid for such kind of treatments using the Cyberknife system, with no need of further calibration factors to be applied. The final accuracy of implantable MOSFETs when used for such kind of treatments was estimated to be within +/- 4%. Additional investigations using dose/fraction higher than 12 Gy, different beam configurations, and tracking systems could extend the present findings to other kind of treatments. MOSFET technology was proven to have high versatility in fast adaptation of existing detectors to new applications. It is plausible to expect a general feasibility of implantable MOSFET technology for in vivo dosimetry of the extracranial-targets treatments using the Cyberknife, provided each particular application will be validated by suitable both physical and clinical studies.""","""['Paolo Scalchi', 'Roberto Righetto', 'Carlo Cavedon', 'Paolo Francescon', 'Federico Colombo']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Total scatter factors of small beams: a multidetector and Monte Carlo study.', 'Implementation of an intraoperative electron radiotherapy in vivo dosimetry program.', 'Comparison study of MOSFET detectors and diodes for entrance in vivo dosimetry in 18 MV x-ray beams.', 'Investigation of the use of MOSFET for clinical IMRT dosimetric verification.', 'Place of Linacs in extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy: Are they now equivalent to Cyberknife®?.', 'Pulsed low dose-rate radiotherapy: radiobiology and dosimetry.', 'Stereotactic Radiotherapy Ablation and Atrial Fibrillation: Technical Issues and Clinical Expectations Derived From a Systematic Review.', 'Influence of different image-guided tracking methods upon the local efficacy of CyberKnife treatment in lung tumors.', 'Commissioning and implementation of an implantable dosimeter for radiation therapy.', 'In vivo dose measurement using TLDs and MOSFET dosimeters for cardiac radiosurgery.']"""

In this in vitro study, we investigated the antivascular properties of ENMD-1198, a new anticancer drug currently in clinical trials. ENMD-1198 is a new analogue of 2-methoxyestradiol, a microtubule-targeting agent that has shown promising results in the treatment of multiple myeloma and hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Using both bone marrow-derived and dermal microvascular endothelial cell lines, we analyzed the effect of ENMD-1198 on the different functions of endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis. In both cell lines, ENMD-1198 was more potent than 2-methoxyestradiol at inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation, motility, migration, and morphogenesis. In addition, ENMD-1198 induced a significant decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 protein expression in endothelial cells. Furthermore, videomicroscopy experiments showed that ENMD-1198 was able to completely disrupt preformed vascular structures within 2 hours. This vascular-disrupting activity was associated with extensive depolymerization of the microtubule network and accumulation of actin stress fibers and large focal adhesions in vascular endothelial cells.

Experimental design:   Diagnostic needle biopsies from prostate cancer patients primarily treated by endocrine therapy were evaluated for TMPRSS2:ERG fusion with fluorescence in situ hybridization and SPINK1 protein expression with immunohistochemistry.  Results:   The frequency of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in 178 biopsies of hormonally treated patients was 34%. Of the fusion-positive cases, 71% showed deletion between the two genes, and 23% showed gain of the fusion.

Metastatic dissemination requires a complex series of coordinated events that result in cells that escape from the primary tumor into the circulation and eventually colonize a distant organ. The ability of these cells to evolve into macroscopic metastases depends strongly on their compatibility with, and ability to utilize, this new microenvironment. We previously showed that bone-metastatic prostate cancer cells exposed to human bone marrow respond by activation of cell survival pathways, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and that these events are mediated by the alpha-receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFRalpha). Our studies and others have shown that PDGFRalpha may be activated by mechanisms independent of PDGF ligand binding. Here, we provide conclusive evidence that soluble components of human bone marrow can activate PDGFRalpha through a mechanism that does not require the canonical binding of PDGF ligand(s) to the receptor. In particular, we found that dimerization of PDGFRalpha monomers is not induced by human bone marrow, but this does not prevent receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling from occurring. To establish the relevance of this phenomenon in vivo, we used a PDGFRalpha mutant lacking the extracellular ligand-binding domain.

Most patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease and have shorter survival rates than patients with early-stage disease. Although screening for lung cancer has the potential to increase early diagnosis, it has not been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality rates. In 1993, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was initiated specifically to determine whether screening would reduce mortality rates from PLCO cancers.  Methods:   A total of 77 464 participants, aged 55-74 years, were randomly assigned to the intervention arm of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial between November 8, 1993, and July 2, 2001. Participants received a baseline chest radiograph (CXR), followed by three annual single-view CXRs at the 10 US screening centers. Cancers were classified as screen detected and nonscreen detected (interval or never screened) and according to tumor histology. The positivity rates of screen-detected cancers and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated. Because 51.6% of the participants were current or former smokers, logistic regression analysis was performed to control for smoking status. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Compliance with screening decreased from 86.6% at baseline to 78.9% at the last screening. Overall positivity rates were 8.9% at baseline and 6.6%-7.1% at subsequent screenings; positivity rates increased modestly with smoking risk categories (P(trend) < .001). The PPVs for all participants were 2.0% at baseline and 1.1%, 1.5%, and 2.4% at years 1, 2, and 3, respectively; PPVs in current smokers were 5.9% at baseline and 3.3%, 4.2%, and 5.6% at years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A total of 564 lung cancers were diagnosed, of which 306 (54%) were screen-detected cancers and 87% were non-small cell lung cancers. Among non-small cell lung cancers, 59.6% of screen-detected cancers and 33.3% of interval cancers were early (I-II) stage.  Conclusions:   The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial demonstrated the ability to recruit, retain, and screen a large population over multiple years at multiple centers.

In this work, using the Monte Carlo code PENELOPE and the voxelized Zubal phantom to model a prostate radiotherapy treatment, a comparison between the physical absorbed dose distributions rendered by three different enhancing agents namely bismuth, gadolinium, and iodine is performed. It is assumed that there exists a concentration of 10 mg of enhancing agent per 1 g of tissue in the target volume while in the background a concentration of 1.5 mg per 1 g of tissue is present. The X-ray beam energy spectrum was obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulation of a tungsten target upon which a 220 keV mono-energetic electron pencil beam is made to impinge, and the resultant photon beam is heavily filtrated by 0.2 cm of copper. The treatment delivery is simulated as a 3608 arc collimated to conform to the target from every direction. Cumulative dose-volume histograms and isodose curves are presented for the target as well as five organs-at-risk, namely rectal wall, bladder, femoral heads, skin, and bone marrow. It is shown that under these conditions clinically acceptable treatment plans are obtained for all three contrast agents.

Disease-specific biomarker genes likely share GEPs that are distinct in disease samples as compared with normal samples. The similarity of the GEPs may be evaluated by Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and the distinctness of GEPs may be assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (KSD). In this study, we used the PCC and KSD metrics for GEPs to identify disease-specific (cancer-specific) biomarkers. We first analyzed and compared GEPs using microarray datasets for smoking and lung cancer. We found that the number of genes with highly different GEPs between comparing groups in smoking dataset was much larger than that in lung cancer dataset; this observation was further verified when we compared GEPs in smoking dataset with prostate cancer datasets. Moreover, our Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the top ranked biomarker candidate genes for prostate cancer were highly enriched in molecular function categories such as 'cytoskeletal protein binding' and biological process categories such as 'muscle contraction'. Finally, we used two genes, ACTC1 (encoding an actin subunit) and HPN (encoding hepsin), to demonstrate the feasibility of diagnosing and monitoring prostate cancer using the expression intensity histograms of marker genes. In summary, our results suggested that this approach might prove promising and powerful for diagnosing and monitoring the patients who come to the clinic for screening or evaluation of a disease state including cancer.""","""['Hung-Chung Huang', 'Siyuan Zheng', 'Vincent VanBuren', 'Zhongming Zhao']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Integrative genomic data mining for discovery of potential blood-borne biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancer.', 'Identification of a distinct luminal subgroup diagnosing and stratifying early stage prostate cancer by tissue-based single-cell RNA sequencing.', 'Genetic network and gene set enrichment analysis to identify biomarkers related to cigarette smoking and lung cancer.', 'Gene expression profiling in prostatic cancer.', 'Molecular Profiles of Prostate Cancer: To Treat or Not to Treat.', 'Mean Platelet Volume Enhances the Diagnostic Specificity of PSA for Prostate Cancer.', 'Expression of cell type incongruent alpha-cardiac actin 1 subunit in medulloblastoma reveals a novel mechanism for cancer cell survival and control of migration.', 'Transcriptome Profile of Next Generation Sequence Data Related to Inflammation on Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cases in Indonesia.', 'Comparing progression molecular mechanisms between lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma based on genetic and epigenetic networks: big data mining and genome-wide systems identification.', 'Identification of gene signatures from RNA-seq data using Pareto-optimal cluster algorithm.']"""

However, because the genomic packaging capacity is constrained, only a few places inside it are available for transgene insertion. In the present study, we introduce a novel strategy utilizing the early E4 region for the insertion of therapeutic gene(s).  Methods:   We constructed the conditionally replication-competent adenovirus (CRAd), Ad5E4(mRFP) by: (i) replacing the E4/E1a promoter by the prostate-specific enhancer element; (ii) inserting mRFP inside the E4orf1-4 deletion region; and (iii) sub-cloning enhanced green fluorescent protein controlled by cytomegalovirus promoter in the left end of the viral genome. Subsequently, we evaluated its replication abilities and killing activities in vitro, as well as its in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in CWR22rv xenografts.  Results:   When infected with Ad5E4(mRFP), the number and intensity of the mRFP gene products increased in a prostate cancer cell-specific manner as designed, suggesting that the mRFP gene and E4orfs other than E4orf1-4 were well synthesized from one transcript via alternative splicing as the recombinant adenovirus replicated. As expected from the confirmed virus replication capability, Ad5E4(mRFP) induced cell lysis as potent as the wild-type adenovirus and effectively suppressed tumor growth when tested in the CWR22rv xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, Ad5E4(endo/angio) harboring an endostatin-angiostatin gene in E4orf1-4 was able to enhance CRAd by replacing mRFP with a therapeutic gene.  Conclusions:   The approach employed in the present study for the insertion of a therapeutic transgene in CRAd should facilitate the construction of CRAd containing multiple therapeutic genes in the viral genome that may have the potential to serve as highly potent cancer therapeutic reagents.""","""['Jae-Kook Nam', 'Mi-Hyang Lee', 'Hae-Hyun Seo', 'Seok-Ki Kim', 'Kang-Huyn Lee', 'In-Hoo Kim', 'Sang-Jin Lee']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Gene Med""","""['Oncolytic adenovirus that overproduces ADP and replicates selectively in tumors due to hTERT promoter-regulated E4 gene expression.', 'Improved glioblastoma treatment with Ad5/35 fiber chimeric conditionally replicating adenoviruses.', 'A novel ex vivo model system for evaluation of conditionally replicative adenoviruses therapeutic efficacy and toxicity.', 'Manipulation of early region 4.', 'E4 gene function in adenovirus, adenovirus vector and adeno-associated virus infections.', 'A host non-coding RNA, nc886, plays a pro-viral role by promoting virus trafficking to the nucleus.']"""

The advent of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in the 1980s caused a revolution in how the disease was detected, but the evidence for PSA as a screening test is deficient. Biomarkers have been investigated, both for detection and discrimination of indolent from aggressive cancers. Refinements to the PSA test have been proposed but for practical and evidence-based reasons none have translated through to widespread clinical use. Of the novel biomarkers, the most promising is the prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) test. New biomarkers to predict aggressive disease are even more contentious. The pathological grade of tumor remains the most powerful biomarker of prognosis. Other proven variables include tumor extent on biopsy and serum PSA. Tissue biomarkers have proven unhelpful due to a variable and biased literature with multiple methodological flaws, but Ki-67 probably shows more promise than any other current tissue biomarker. The recent discovery of a family of fusion genes in the prostate has led to considerable discussion on their prognostic role.

Methods:   We evaluated 290 men who met criteria for active surveillance (ie, PSA density < 0.15 ng/mL/cm(3) and Gleason score < or = 6 with no pattern > or = 4, involving < or = 2 cores with cancer, and < or = 50% involvement of any core by cancer) with two or more serial PSA measurements after diagnosis from 1994 to 2008.

Treatment was recommended for biopsy progression (ie, Gleason score > or = 7, or > 2 positive cores, or > 50% core involvement). Sensitivity and specificity of postdiagnostic PSAV and PSADT were explored by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

Initially using a proteomic approach, we identified that heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) binds to a motif in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and promotes palmitoylation of the SR. Hsp27-induced acylation occurred on the ERalpha monomer and augmented caveolin-1 interactions with ERalpha, resulting in membrane localization, kinase activation, and DNA synthesis in breast cancer cells. Oligomerization of Hsp27 was required, and similar results were found for the trafficking of endogenous progesterone and androgen receptors to the PMs of breast and prostate cancer cells, respectively.

The effect of the extract on cell cycle progression and its combined cytotoxic effect with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on PC3-MM2 cells were also investigated.  Materials and methods:   The anti-proliferative effects of Dryopteris crassirhizoma were examined by culturing PC3-MM2 cells in the presence or absence of various concentrations of Dryopteris crassirhizoma extract, and the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation were determined by Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 analysis. The quantities of apoptosis-inducing proteins were measured by western blotting analysis. Cell cycle progression was analyzed by PI staining using flow cytometry.  Results:   Dryopteris crassirhizoma (50 and 100 microg/ml) inhibited markedly the proliferation of PC-3 and PC3-MM2 cells without cytotoxicity to normal (spleen) cells from BALB/C mice. Dryopteris crassirhizoma (100 microg/ml) effectively induced apoptosis through the activation of caspase-3, -8, -9, bid, and PARP in PC3-MM2 cells. The cells exposed to Dryopteris crassirhizoma increased significantly the accumulation of the DNA contents in the G0/G1 phase and sub-G1 phase in contrast to the control.

Methods:   A total of 63 patients with HRPC were treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen including DTX, EMP, and hydrocortisone. Clinical and pathological features were correlated to serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence and survival rates. Incidence and degree of toxicities were also retrospectively reviewed.  Results:   A median of 11 courses of chemotherapy was administered per patient. PSA levels decreased by >50% in 32 (51%) patients and >90% in 18 (29%) patients. Median time to PSA progression was 6 months (range from 1 to 41 months) and median time of overall survival was 14 months (range from 1 to 56 months). In a univariate analysis to predict overall survival, PSA, hemoglobin, alkaliphosphatase, and performance status prior to the chemotherapy were significant factors. Despite grade 3-4 neutropenia in 87% of patients, grade 5 interstitial pneumonia in one patient and grade 4-5 myocardial infarction in two patients were recognized, the regimen seemed to be relatively safe.

Preoperative, perioperative and postoperative parameters between patients in the first 30 cases (Group I), the second 30 cases (Group II) and cases 61-100 (Group III) undergoing RALP were analyzed.  Results:   Console time was shorter and blood loss was reduced in Groups II and III compared with Group I. Significant differences were found in vesicourethral anastomosis time (46.38 min for Group I vs 31.0 min for Group II vs 27 min for Group III, P < 0.01). Postoperative stay became statistically significantly shorter, from 7.33 days for Group I to 3.93 days for Group II to 3.0 days for Group III.

Patients and methods:   The University of California San Francisco Urologic Oncology Database was queried for patients undergoing RALP or ORP from 2002 to 2008. Patient demographics, prostate cancer-specific information, surgical data, and follow-up were collected. For each surgical approach, multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to evaluate associations of demographics and clinical characteristics with BNC. Time to BNC after RP was evaluated using life table and Kaplan-Meier methods.  Results:   From 2002 to 2008, 988 patients underwent RP as primary treatment and had at least 12 months of follow-up. Of these men, 695 underwent ORP and 293 underwent RALP. The mean (sd) age was 59.3 (6.80) years and 91% of men were Caucasian. D'Amico risk groups at diagnosis were low (38%), intermediate (38%), and high (24%). The BNC incidence was 2.2% (22 cases) overall, 1.4% (four) for RALP, and 2.6% (18) for ORP (P= 0.12). Patients with BNC were diagnosed a median (range) of 4.7 (1-15) months after surgery. At 18 months after surgery, the BNC-free rate was 97% for ORP and 99% for RALP (log-rank P= 0.13). The most common presenting complaint was slow stream, followed by urinary retention. In Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, earlier year of surgery, older age at diagnosis and higher PSA level at diagnosis were significantly associated with BNC among ORP patients. In the RALP group, none of the covariates were associated with BNC.  Conclusions:   The overall incidence of BNC was low in both RALP and ORP groups.

Pathological characteristics of prostate cancer following an initial diagnosis of ATYP are rarely studied.  Design:   We studied prostate biopsies with an initial diagnosis of ATYP. Number of ATYP foci, presence of concomitant high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), date and diagnosis of repeat biopsies were recorded. When radical prostatectomy was performed for confirmed prostate cancer, Gleason score, tumour volume, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node status, and surgical margins of resection status were also recorded.  Results:   Between 1992 and 2009, 239 patients biopsied at our institution carried a diagnosis of ATYP and underwent repeat follow-up biopsies. The mean time interval between first biopsy and last repeat biopsy was 14.4 months; the average number of follow up biopsies was 1.4. Most cases (85.3%) had a single focus of ATYP; in 14.6%, ATYP involved more than one biopsy core. Concomitant HGPIN was present in 56.9% of cases. Final repeat follow-up diagnoses were: prostate cancer in 122 (51.0%), ATYP in 15 (6.3%), HGPIN in 35 (14.6%), and benign prostatic tissue in 67 (28.0%) cases. Of 122 patients with prostate cancer detected in repeat follow-up biopsies, 51 underwent radical prostatectomy and two had only a pelvic lymph node dissection, one of which revealed metastatic prostate cancer. One patient presented with metastatic prostate cancer in a cervical lymph node. Radical prostatectomy Gleason score was 6 in 25 patients (49.0%), 7 in 19 (37.2%), >or=8 in five (9.8%), and undetermined in two (3.9%) cases. Extraprostatic extension was present in seven of 47 (14.9%), and seminal vesicle invasion in three of 51 (5.9%) cases. Tumour volume was low in 42.8%, medium in 49.0%, and extensive in 8.2% of cases. Of the total 53 prostate cancers analysed (51 radical prostatectomy and 2 lymph node metastases), 37 (69.8%) were pathologically significant cancer, 14 (26.4%) were potentially pathologically insignificant, and two were undetermined.

Despite this, there are currently no guidelines regarding SV sampling in radical prostatectomy specimens. This study examines the distribution of invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma in SVs and makes recommendations regarding sampling procedures.  Method:   The SVs from 773 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens were serially sectioned and blocked entirely, with sections grouped into the proximal, mid and distal thirds of the glands. The site of invasive prostatic carcinoma within the muscular wall of the SV and its presence in the ejaculatory duct was recorded.  Results:   SV invasion (pT3b) was present in 56 (7.2%) cases. Patients ranged in age from 52 to 73 years (mean 64 years), with a serum prostatic specific antigen ranging from 3.7 to 46 ng/mL (mean 10.6 ng/mL). Fourteen patients (25%) had a palpable nodule or induration on digital rectal examination. Ejaculatory duct involvement was present in 49 cases. Forty-seven of 49 (95.9%) cases with ejaculatory duct involvement also had SV invasion. The mean tumour volume was 5.53 cm(3) (range 1.0-12.1 cm(3)). The tumours had a Gleason score of 4 + 3 in five cases, 4 + 3 with tertiary pattern 5 in 12 cases, 8 in two cases and 5 + 4/4 + 5 in 37 cases. All but one of the SV positive cases (98.2%) had involvement of the proximal third (15 right, 17 left and 23 both) of the gland, 35 of which (63.6%) had infiltration only of the proximal SV. For the remainder, 11 also had mid third and nine had mid and distal third involvement. Lymphovascular invasion within the prostate was seen in 71.4% of cases. In one of these cases involvement of the distal right SV was present in the absence of involvement of the proximal or mid SV.  Conclusions:   In this study, as distal SV invasion in the absence of proximal SV invasion was found in <2% of cases, we conclude that sampling of the proximal third of the SVs is sufficient to identify virtually all cases of tumour infiltration into the SVs. If lymphovascular invasion is present in the absence of proximal SV invasion, then the remaining parts of the SV must be examined. Also, in cases with involvement of the ejaculatory duct, thorough examination of the SV is warranted.""","""['Hemamali Samaratunga', 'Dinithi Samaratunga', 'Joanna Perry-Keene', 'Michael Adamson', 'John Yaxley', 'Brett Delahunt']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Pathology""","""['Lymphovascular invasion is an independent prognostic factor in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Predictors of prostate-specific antigen progression among men with seminal vesicle invasion at the time of radical prostatectomy.', 'Is seminal vesicle ablation mandatory for all patients undergoing radical prostatectomy?

Methods:   Pathological findings from PNBs from 12 304 men who underwent initial PNB during an 8 year period were analysed. Patients were included in the study if their initial diagnosis was HGPIN alone or a benign diagnosis, if at least one follow-up PNB was performed, and if both the initial and follow-up PNB contained at least 10 prostate cores.  Results:   In the benign group of 105 patients and the HGPIN group of 120 patients, 14.1% and 20.8% were diagnosed with prostatic adenocarcinoma, respectively.

Most commonly, these lesions grow in large cribriform and/or papillary patterns or, as recently described, in a manner resembling prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (i.e., 'PIN-like' prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma). This study aims to report rare variants of ductal adenocarcinoma.  Methods:   Ten cases of rare patterns of prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma that have not been formally investigated prior to this study, primarily from one author's consultation service (1987-2009), were selected.  Results:   Two (n = 2) cases were prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma with mucinous and goblet cell features. Three (n = 3) cases are the first described cases of foamy gland prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Other unique cases were prostatic duct adenocarcinomas with associated Paneth cell-like neuroendocrine (n = 2), micropapillary (n = 2), and cystic papillary features (n = 1). Prostatic origin was confirmed with immunohistochemical studies for prostate specific antigen (PSA), P501S, and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). High-grade PIN was ruled out with negative stains for high molecular weight cytokeratin (HMWCK) and p63. Four prostatic ductal adenocarcinomas had no evidence of disease at 2-8 years follow-up: foamy gland, Paneth cell-like, and micropapillary (two cases). One mucinous prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma resulted in the patient's death and the other mucinous case was alive at 7 years and 2 months, yet with no information as to status of disease. The remaining four cases were lost to follow-up, died of other causes, or were recent.  Conclusions:   In summary, we report several rare and unique histological patterns of prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The practical importance of recognising these histological variations is that in some cases they may be misdiagnosed as non-prostatic tumours. These unusual cases also provide further support for the relationship between acinar and ductal adenocarcinoma.""","""['Thomas K Lee', 'Jeremy S Miller', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Pathology""","""['High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasialike ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 28 cases.', 'The utility of Ki-67 expression in the differential diagnosis of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'High-grade foamy gland prostatic adenocarcinoma on biopsy or transurethral resection: a morphologic study of 55 cases.', 'Prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a mini review.', 'My approach to intraductal lesions of the prostate gland.', 'Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: A systematic review and meta-analysis of incidence, presentation, prognosis, and management.', 'Survival after radical prostatectomy vs. radiation therapy in ductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Prostate carcinomas mimicking a digestive malignancy.', 'Sox2 is necessary for androgen ablation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation from Pten null Sca-1+ prostate luminal cells.', 'The update of prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma.']"""

The aim of this study was to explore whether the expression of the proapoptotic proteins caspase-6, caspase-9, and Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B-19kDa-interacting protein3 (BNIP3) is altered in prostate cancers.  Methods:   We analyzed the expression of caspase-6, caspase-9, and BNIP3 in 107 prostate adenocarcinoma tissues by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray (TMA) method.  Results:   Normal glandular cells expressed caspase-6 and BNIP3 proteins in 10 (9.3%) and 9 (8.4%) prostate tissues, respectively. By contrast, the prostate cancers expressed caspase-6 and BNIP3 in 65 (60.7%) and 69 (64.5%) cases, respectively. Prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) showed caspase-6 and BNIP3 expression in 65% and 65% of cases, respectively. We observed caspase-9 expression in 40 (37.4%) normal, 8 (40%) PIN, and 45 (42.1%) cancer tissues. None of the expression of caspase-6, caspase-9 or BNIP3 was associated with pathological characteristics such as tumor size, patient age, Gleason score, or tumor stage.  Conclusion:   Our data showed that prostate cancer and PIN cells display higher expression of the proapoptotic proteins caspase-6 and BNIP3 than normal cells. Neo-expression of these proteins from the PIN stage suggests that apoptosis deregulation might occur in the early stage of prostate carcinogenesis, and that altered expression of proapoptotic proteins may be a feature of prostate cancer.""","""['Nam Jin Yoo', 'Min Seob Kim', 'Sang Wook Park', 'Seong Il Seo', 'Sang Yong Song', 'Ji Youl Lee', 'Sug Hyung Lee']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Immunohistochemical analysis of bcl-2, bax, bcl-X, and mcl-1 expression in prostate cancers.', 'Mutational and expressional analysis of BNIP3, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 member, in gastric carcinomas.', 'MicroRNA145 targets BNIP3 and suppresses prostate cancer progression.', 'Changes in biomarker expression in the development of prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Subtle morphological and molecular changes in normal-looking epithelium in prostates with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-induced integrin α6β1 and Bnip3 promote survival and resistance to PI3K inhibitors in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Arum Palaestinum with isovanillin, linolenic acid and β-sitosterol inhibits prostate cancer spheroids and reduces the growth rate of prostate tumors in mice.', 'GCPII modulates oxidative stress and prostate cancer susceptibility through changes in methylation of RASSF1, BNIP3, GSTP1 and Ec-SOD.', 'The triterpenoid pristimerin induces U87 glioma cell apoptosis through reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction.', 'Zinc-mediated allosteric inhibition of caspase-6.']"""

This study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and safety of reirradiation with image-guided radiosurgery using CyberKnife, a robotic arm-driven compact linear accelerator, for intraprostatic recurrence after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).  Methods:   Between September 2007 and May 2008, 6 patients diagnosed with locally recurrent prostate cancer after EBRT were treated using the CyberKnife system. The total reirradiation dose was 30 Gy in five fractions. Prior to radiosurgery four patients were treated with androgen-deprivation therapy. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria and the Houston-Phoenix definition (PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL) were used for toxicity and biochemical failure evaluation, respectively.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 11.2 months (range, 9.6-18.6 months), all patients are alive with no evidence of severe urinary or rectal acute morbidity. Local control cannot be exactly determined due to the short follow-up and the bias of the use of androgen ablation. Four patients had biochemical failure, three of them with clinical failure evidence (lymph node, bone and lung metastasis, respectively): none of these patients had clinical evidence of tumor persistence in the prostate.

Selectively replicating viruses can be generated by placing a tissue or cancer-specific promoter upstream of one or more of the viral genes required for replication (for example, E1A, E1B). We have previously reported multiple cellular processes that can attenuate viral replication, which in turn compromises viral oncolysis and tumor kill. In this study, we investigated the importance of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/Waf-1, on viral replication and tumor growth. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the importance of p21/Waf-1shRNA on the induction of an androgen responsive element (ARE) based promoter driving the E1A gene. As a proof of concept, the study emphasizes the use of RNA interference technology to overcome promoter weaknesses for tissue-specific oncolytic viruses, as well as the cellular inhibitor pathways on viral life cycle. Using RNA interference against p21/Waf-1, we were able to show an increase in viral replication and viral oncolysis of prostate cancer cells. Similarly, CRAd viruses that carry p21/Waf-1 shRNA (Ad5-RV004.21) were able to prevent tumor outgrowth that resulted in a marked increase in the mean survival time of tumor-bearing mice compared with CRAd without p21/Waf-1 shRNA (Ad5-RV004). In studies combining Ad5-RV004.21 with Adriamycin, a suprar-additive effect was observed only in CRAds that harbor shRNA against p21/Waf-1. Taken together, these findings of enhanced viral replication in prostate cancer cells by using RNA interference against the cdk inhibitor p21/Waf-1 have significant implications in the development of prostate-specific CRAd therapies.""","""['N Höti', 'W H Chowdhury', 'S Mustafa', 'J Ribas', 'M Castanares', 'T Johnson', 'M Liu', 'S E Lupold', 'R Rodriguez']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Gene Ther""","""['Bicalutamide-activated oncolytic adenovirus for the adjuvant therapy of high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Lentivirus-mediated p21/Waf-1 short hairpin RNA enhances the cytotoxic effects and replicative potential of a bladder cancer-specific oncolytic adenovirus in vitro.', 'Androgen receptor attenuation of Ad5 replication: implications for the development of conditionally replication competent adenoviruses.', 'Armed replicating adenoviruses for cancer virotherapy.', 'Engineering regulatory elements for conditionally-replicative adeno-viruses.', 'Expression of Oncolytic Adenovirus-Encoded RNAi Molecules Is Most Effective in a pri-miRNA Precursor Format.', 'Unleashing the Full Potential of Oncolytic Adenoviruses against Cancer by Applying RNA Interference: The Force Awakens.', 'Loss of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Alters Oncolytic Adenovirus Replication and Promotes More Efficient Virus Production.', 'A novel approach for detecting viable and tissue-specific circulating tumor cells through an adenovirus-based reporter vector.', 'Bicalutamide-activated oncolytic adenovirus for the adjuvant therapy of high-risk prostate cancer.']"""

Downregulation of MMP-9, uPAR, and CB inhibited matrigel invasion, in vitro angiogenesis and wound-healing migration ability of PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, the siRNA treatments induced apoptosis in the tumor cells as determined by TUNEL and DNA laddering assays. An attempt to elucidate the apoptotic pathway showed the involvement of FAS-mediated activation of caspases-8 and -7. Further, mice with orthotopic prostate tumors treated with siRNA-expressing vectors showed significant inhibition in tumor growth and migration.

The purpose of this study was to determine the protein expression of collagen XXIII in tumor tissues from a variety of cancers and to assess the utility of collagen XXIII as a biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Methods:   A multicancer tissue microarray was used for the immunohistochemical examination of collagen XXIII protein expression in a variety of cancers. Subsequently, collagen XXIII expression was analyzed in three separate cohorts using tissue microarrays with representative tumor and control lung tissues from NSCLC patients. In addition, NSCLC patient urine samples were analyzed for the presence of collagen XXIII through Western blot.  Results:   Collagen XXIII was present in tissue samples from a variety of cancers. Within lung cancer tissues, collagen XXIII staining was enriched in NSCLC subtypes. Collagen XXIII was present in 294 of 333 (88%) lung adenocarcinomas and 97 of 133 (73%) squamous cell carcinomas. In urine, collagen XXIII was present in 23 of 29 (79%) NSCLC patient samples but only in 15 of 54 (28%) control samples. High collagen XXIII staining intensity correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival in NSCLC patients.  Conclusions:   We show the capability of collagen XXIII as a tissue and urinary biomarker for NSCLC, in which positivity in tissue or urine significantly correlates with the presence of NSCLC and high staining intensity is a significant recurrence predictor.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of psychological distress, its associated factors and clinical implications at three different stages in the cancer trajectory.  Data and methods:   Cancer patients from cancer outpatients (n=200), the general community (n=364) and specialist palliative care (n=150) were included. Psychological distress was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Associated factors and clinical prognostic value were investigated using logistic regression and Cox regression.  Results:   Overall prevalence of psychological distress was 24.5% (95% CI: 18.5-30.5%) in cancer outpatients during or soon after treatment, 16.5% (95%CI: 12.7-20.3%) in the general community and rose to 59.3% (95%CI: 51.4-67.2%) in specialist palliative care.

All patients had undergone a 9-month course of total androgen deprivation, with radiotherapy starting 2 months after initiation of the total androgen deprivation.  Results:   The median follow-up was 32 and 35 months in the hypofractionation and conventional fractionation arms, respectively. For the patients developing acute toxicity, no difference between the two fractionation groups was found in either severity or duration of gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity. Also, no difference was found in the incidence and severity of late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity between the two treatment schedules, with a 3-year rate of Grade 2 or greater toxicity of 17% and 16% for the hypofractionation arm and 14% and 11% for the conventional fractionation arm, respectively. A statistically significant correlation between acute and late gastrointestinal toxicity was found only in the conventional fractionation group.

Here, we investigated the role of the prenylation transferases in the regulation of the cytoskeletal organization and motility of PC-3 prostate cancer cells. This was done by using FTI-277, GGTI-298 or NE-10790, the specific inhibitors of FTase (farnesyltransferase), GGTase (geranylgeranyltransferase)-I and -II, respectively. Treatment of PC-3 cells with GGTI-298 and FTI-277 inhibited migration and invasion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This was associated with disruption of F-actin organization and decreased recovery of GFP-actin. Immunoblot analysis of various cytoskeleton-associated proteins showed that the most striking change in GGTI-298- and FTI-277-treated cells was a markedly decreased level of total and phosphorylated cofilin, whereas the level of cofilin mRNA was not decreased. The treatment of PC-3 cells with GGTI-298 also affected the dynamics of GFP-paxillin and decreased the levels of total and phosphorylated paxillin. The levels of phosphorylated FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and PAK (p-21-associated kinase)-2 were also lowered by GGTI-298, but levels of paxillin or FAK mRNAs were not affected. In addition, GGTI-298 had a minor effect on the activity of MMP-9. RNAi knockdown of GGTase-Ibeta inhibited invasion, disrupted F-actin organization and decreased the level of cofilin in PC-3 cells. NE-10790 did not have any effect on PC-3 prostate cancer cell motility or on the organization of the cytoskeleton.

TPV replicates efficiently in some human tumor cells, and is restricted in others when measured by viral titer at 7 days post infection. Results described here clearly demonstrate that TPV replication in one glioblastoma cell line (U-373), and one colorectal cancer cell line (HCT-116) is more productive than in owl monkey kidney cells (OMK). Replication in two renal cancer cell lines (ACHN and Caki-1) is also increased when compared to OMK.

CXCL14 is a chemokine that in tumors may act as chemoattractant for monocytes and dendritic cells (DC), which may modulate antitumor immune responses in certain cancers. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of loss of CXCL14 in prostate cancer cells. Cell treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in the recovery of CXCL14 mRNA and protein expression. Hypermethylated CpG island sequences encompassing the CXCL14 gene promoter were identified.

We focused on elucidating metabolic pathways of oxidative stress generation in CaP cells. Previously, we showed that the transcription factor JunD is essential for androgen-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in androgen-dependent human CaP cells. We also recently showed that androgen induces the first and regulatory enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) in a polyamine catabolic pathway that produces copious amounts of metabolic ROS. Here, we present coimmunoprecipitation and Gaussia luciferase reconstitution assay data that show that JunD forms a complex with androgen-activated androgen receptor (AR) in situ. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation assay data show that JunD binds directly to a specific SSAT promoter sequence only in androgen-treated LNCaP cells. Using a vector containing a luciferase reporter gene connected to the SSAT promoter and a JunD-silenced LNCaP cell line, we show that JunD is essential for androgen-induced SSAT gene expression. The elucidation of JunD-AR complex inducing SSAT expression leading to polyamine oxidation establishes the mechanistic basis of androgen-induced ROS production in CaP cells and opens up a new prostate-specific target for CaP chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic drug development.""","""['Farideh Mehraein-Ghomi', 'Hirak S Basu', 'Dawn R Church', 'F Michael Hoffmann', 'George Wilding']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Targeting androgen receptor and JunD interaction for prevention of prostate cancer progression.', 'JunD mediates androgen-induced oxidative stress in androgen dependent LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'A small molecule polyamine oxidase inhibitor blocks androgen-induced oxidative stress and delays prostate cancer progression in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Spermidine/spermine-N(1)-acetyltransferase: a key metabolic regulator.', 'SOX15 transcriptionally increases the function of AOC1 to modulate ferroptosis and progression in prostate cancer.', 'The Association between Spermidine/Spermine N1-Acetyltransferase (SSAT) and Human Malignancies.', 'The Emerging Clinical Role of Spermine in Prostate Cancer.', 'miR-204-5p Represses Bone Metastasis via Inactivating NF-κB Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Reactive oxygen species in eradicating acute myeloid leukemic stem cells.']"""

Recent studies showed that cyclin D1b is selectively induced in a subset of tissues as a function of tumorigenesis; however, the underlying mechanism(s) that control tumor-specific cyclin D1b induction remain unsolved. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein ASF/SF2 as a critical, allele-specific, disease-relevant effector of cyclin D1b production. Initially, it was observed that SF2 associates with cyclin D1b mRNA (transcript-b) in minigene analyses and with endogenous transcript in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. SF2 association was altered by the CCND1 G/A870 polymorphism, which resides in the splice donor site controlling transcript-b production. This finding was significant, as the A870 allele promotes cyclin D1b in benign prostate tissue, but in primary PCa, cyclin D1b production is independent of A870 status. Data herein provide a basis for this disparity, as tumor-associated induction of SF2 predominantly results in binding to and accumulation of G870-derived transcript-b. Finally, the relevance of SF2 function was established, as SF2 strongly correlated with cyclin D1b (but not cyclin D1a) in human PCa. Together, these studies identify a novel mechanism by which cyclin D1b is induced in cancer, and reveal significant evidence of a factor that cooperates with a risk-associated polymorphism to alter cyclin D1 isoform production. Identification of SF2 as a disease-relevant effector of cyclin D1b provides a basis for future studies designed to suppress the oncogenic alternative splicing event.""","""['Nicholas A Olshavsky', 'Clay E S Comstock', 'Matthew J Schiewer', 'Michael A Augello', 'Terry Hyslop', 'Claudio Sette', 'Jinsong Zhang', 'Linda M Parysek', 'Karen E Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Cyclin D1 splice variants: polymorphism, risk, and isoform-specific regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Alternative splicing of the cyclin D1 proto-oncogene is regulated by the RNA-binding protein Sam68.', 'Cyclin D1b variant promotes cell invasiveness independent of binding to CDK4 in human bladder cancer cells.', 'Cyclin D1: polymorphism, aberrant splicing and cancer risk.', 'Cyclin D1 in non-small cell lung cancer: a key driver of malignant transformation.', ""The androgen receptor couples promoter recruitment of RNA processing factors to regulation of alternative polyadenylation at the 3' end of transcripts."", 'The role of alternative splicing in human cancer progression.', 'BAF57/SMARCE1 Interacting with Splicing Factor SRSF1 Regulates Mechanical Stress-Induced Alternative Splicing of Cyclin D1.', 'Serine/arginine-rich splicing factors: the bridge linking alternative splicing and cancer.', 'The Role of RNA Splicing Factors in Cancer: Regulation of Viral and Human Gene Expression in Human Papillomavirus-Related Cervical Cancer.']"""

Knocking down of ILK abrogated ITGA7-induced MCM7 phosphorylation. ANK, the dominant-negative mutant of ILK, also blocked the phosphorylation of MCM7 induced by ITGA7. The phosphorylation of MCM7 reduced MCM7 chromatin association and inhibited cell growth. A MCM7 mutant that does not bind with ILK did not respond to ITGA7 stimulation, and behaved similarly to a dominant MCM7-negative mutant and neutralized the effect of ITGA7.

Blood samples were prospectively collected and de-identified before being genotyped and matched to clinical data. The survival analysis was adjusted for Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen. We investigated associations between 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and biochemical recurrence, castration-resistant metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific survival.

Experimental design:   Seventy-four patients with histopathologically confirmed CRMPC previously untreated with chemotherapy were randomized to receive either<or=10 cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 alone (D; n=39) or docetaxel plus ASA404 1,200 mg/m2 (A-D; n=35). Study endpoints included prostate-specific antigen response, tumor response, median time to tumor progression, median survival, and toxicity.  Results:   The overall pattern of adverse events was similar in the two groups; however, there was a higher incidence of cardiac adverse events and neutropenia in the A-D group. Coadministration of ASA404 with docetaxel did not affect total systemic exposure of either drug. A higher prostate-specific antigen response rate was reported with A-D versus D (59.4% versus 36.8%), together with a larger median percentage reduction in prostate-specific antigen (84.0% versus 61.9%) and a shorter median time to prostate-specific antigen nadir (105 versus 119 d). Tumor response rate was 23.1% with A-D and 9.1% with D. Time to tumor progression and median survival were similar in the groups (time to tumor progression, 8.7 mo for A-D and 8.4 mo for D; survival, 17.0 mo for A-D and 17.2 mo for D).

Sesamin, a lipid-soluble lignan, is one such agent that belongs to a class of phytoestrogens, isolated from sesame (Sesamum indicum), and has been linked with prevention of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and carcinogenesis through an unknown mechanism. Because the transcription factor NF-kappaB has been associated with inflammation, carcinogenesis, tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis of cancer, we postulated that sesamin might mediate its effect through the modulation of the NF-kappaB pathway. We found that sesamin inhibited the proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the colon, prostate, breast, pancreas, and lung. Sesamin also potentiated tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis and this correlated with the suppression of gene products linked to cell survival (e.g., Bcl-2 and survivin), proliferation (e.g., cyclin D1), inflammation (e.g., cyclooxygenase-2), invasion (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-9, intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and angiogenesis (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor). Sesamin downregulated constitutive and inducible NF-kappaB activation induced by various inflammatory stimuli and carcinogens, and inhibited the degradation of IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, through the suppression of phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and inhibition of activation of IkappaBalpha protein kinase, thus resulting in the suppression of p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and NF-kappaB-mediated reporter gene transcription. The inhibition of IkappaBalpha protein kinase activation was found to be mediated through the inhibition of TAK1 kinase. Overall, our results showed that sesamin may have potential against cancer and other chronic diseases through the suppression of a pathway linked to the NF-kappaB signaling.""","""['Kuzhuvelil B Harikumar', 'Bokyung Sung', 'Sheeja T Tharakan', 'Manoj K Pandey', 'Beena Joy', 'Sushovan Guha', 'Sunil Krishnan', 'Bharat B Aggarwal']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Identification of a novel blocker of I kappa B alpha kinase that enhances cellular apoptosis and inhibits cellular invasion through suppression of NF-kappa B-regulated gene products.', 'Pinitol targets nuclear factor-kappaB activation pathway leading to inhibition of gene products associated with proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis.', 'Sesamin inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced proliferation and invasion through the p38-MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells.', 'A comprehensive review on the anti-cancer properties and mechanisms of action of sesamin, a lignan in sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum).', 'Nuclear factor-kappa B and cancer: its role in prevention and therapy.', 'Effects of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) and bioactive compounds (sesamin and sesamolin) on inflammation and atherosclerosis: A review.', 'Sesamin Attenuates VEGFA-Induced Angiogenesis via Inhibition of Src and FAK Signaling in Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane Model and Human Endothelial EA.hy926 Cells.', 'Traditional Herbal Medicine: A Potential Therapeutic Approach for Adjuvant Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in the Future.', 'Sesamin Acts as Anti-leukemic Compound Interacting with Novel Phosphoprotein Targets and Inducing Apoptosis in Leukemic Cells.', 'Genesis and Mechanism of Some Cancer Types and an Overview on the Role of Diet and Nutrition in Cancer Prevention.']"""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radioprotective effects of DF-1 in a murine model of lethal total body irradiation and to assess for selective radioprotection of normal cells versus tumor cells.  Methods:   In vitro radioresponse was evaluated with clonogenic assays with human tumor cells and fibroblast lines in the presence of varying concentrations of DF-1 or vehicle. DNA double strand break induction and repair was evaluated with immunocytochemistry for gammaH2AX. Lethal total body irradiation was delivered with 137Cs after intraperitoneal delivery of DF-1 or vehicle control. Bone marrow hypoxia was evaluated with piminidazole uptake assessed by flow cytometry.  Results:   DF-1 provided modest radioprotection of human cancer cell lines and fibroblast cell lines when delivered prior to irradiation (dose modifying factor or 1.1). There was no evidence of selective protection of fibroblasts versus tumor cells. Cells treated with DF-1 at radioprotective doses were found to have fewer gammaH2AX foci at 1 and 6 hours after irradiation compared to vehicle treated controls. The LD50/30 for C57Bl6/Ncr mice treated with a single 300 mg/kg dose of DF-1 pre-irradiation was 10.09 Gy (95% CI 9.58-10.26) versus 8.29 Gy (95% CI, 8.21-8.32) for control mice. No protective effects were seen with a single 200 mg/kg dose. No increase in pimonidazole uptake was appreciated in bone marrow of mice treated with DF-1 compared to vehicle controls.

Cancer incidence data between 1999 and 2003 were obtained from the Ontario Cancer Registry and were geocoded down to the level of DA using the enhanced Postal Code Conversion File. The 2001 Census of Canada provided information on the size and age-sex structure of the population at the DA level, in addition to information about selected census covariates, such as average neighbourhood income.  Results:   Age standardized incidence ratios for cancer and the prevalence of census covariates were calculated for each of 331 dissemination areas in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph. The standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for cancer varied dramatically across the dissemination areas. However, application of the Moran's I statistic, a popular index of spatial autocorrelation, suggested significant spatial patterns for only two cancers, lung and prostate, both in males (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). Employing Bayesian hierarchical models, areas in the urban core of the City of Guelph had significantly higher SIRs for male lung cancer than the remainder of Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph; and, neighbourhoods in the urban and surrounding rural areas of Orangeville exhibited significantly higher SIRs for prostate cancer. After adjustment for age and spatial dependence, average household income attenuated much of the spatial pattern of lung cancer, but not of prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   This paper demonstrates the feasibility and utility of a systematic approach to identifying neighbourhoods, within the area served by a public health unit, that have significantly higher risks of cancer.

This current study investigates the role of GDF-9, a BMP member, in prostate cancer. GDF-9 was over-expressed in PC-3 cells using a mammalian expression construct. Additionally, GDF-9 ribozyme transgenes were generated in order to knock down the expression of GDF-9 in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. These cells were then used in in vitro growth assays in order to determine the effect of GDF-9 on prostate cancer cell growth. Recombinant GDF-9 was also generated and used to treat both cell lines before carrying out further growth assays. Levels of apoptosis were subsequently analyzed using flow cytometry. Cell growth was significantly increased in the GDF-9 over-expressing cells compared to the two controls. The cell growth rate at day 5 was significantly greater in the PC-3(GDF-9exp.) (1,131.1 +/- 79.1%) compared to both PC-3(WT) (563.9 +/- 90.6%) and PC-3(pEF) (763.3 +/- 82.0%), P <or= 0.001 versus both controls. The opposite effect was seen in both PC-3 and DU-145 GDF-9 knockdown cells. The PC-3(WT) cells treated with rh-GDF-9 (1.35 +/- 0.28) had a significantly increased absorbance and hence growth rate compared to the untreated PC-3 cells (0.79 +/- 0.05), P = 0.026. Finally, flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 DNA staining demonstrated decreased apoptosis and caspase-3 expression levels in PC-3(GDF-9exp.) cells and rh-GDF-9-treated PC-3(WT) cells. This study shows that GDF-9 can promote the growth rate of both PC-3 and DU-145 cells by protecting the cells from caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, and suggests that GDF-9 may aid in the progression of prostate cancer by acting as a survival factor.""","""['Sivan M Bokobza', 'Lin Ye', 'Howard G Kynaston', 'Wen G Jiang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Bone morphogenetic protein-9 induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, the role of prostate apoptosis response-4.', 'Growth and differentiation factor-9 promotes adhesive and motile capacity of prostate cancer cells by up-regulating FAK and Paxillin via Smad dependent pathway.', 'Induction of apoptosis by mifepristone in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines in vitro.', 'Endogenous bone morphogenetic protein-7 controls the motility of prostate cancer cells through regulation of bone morphogenetic protein antagonists.', 'Recent role of inflammation in prostate diseases: chemoprevention development opportunity.', 'GDF11 restrains tumor growth by promoting apoptosis in pancreatic cancer.', 'Growth and differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9) induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells.']"""

That questioning was 'evidence-based' in the contemporary epidemiological meaning of this--use was made of cancer-registry data as well as of evidence from such randomized trials as epidemiologists now take to be essential in actual research on screening for a cancer--and, evidence-based as it was, that questioning has been left unquestioned. But that questioning, as to the interpretation of the evidence, was not adequately thinking-based. It was, instead, rife with the misunderstandings that permeate contemporary epidemiological thinking about screening for a cancer and about research for the scientific knowledge-base of this. In the truly called-for rethinking, the point of departure would be the recognition that the premises of screening for a cancer are clinical in nature, as obviously also are both the entire process potentially leading to a cancer's early, preclinical diagnosis and the individual counselling about submitting oneself to this. Epidemiologists should focus on epidemiology--practice of and research for community medicine, community-level preventive medicine, that is--and to have no presumptions of understanding, better than clinicians, the (clinical) issues surrounding the pursuit of early diagnosis of a cancer, whether matters of practice, research, or public policy. Clinicians and clinical researchers, in turn, should disregard epidemiologists'--and other public-health professionals'--ideas about screening for a cancer, the practice of and research on this.

However, the role of angiogenesis inhibitors, such as thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), in this process is unclear. TSP-1 is a multifunctional glycoprotein that can function as a potent angiogenesis inhibitor and an in vivo activator of latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in some tissues. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that TSP-1 regulated androgen withdrawal-induced prostate regression and that this process was mediated not only through antiangiogenic activity but also through TGF-beta activation. To test this, we evaluated angiogenic activity in human prostate epithelial and stromal cells treated with androgens and hypoxia in vitro. TSP-1 knockout mice were characterized to investigate the in vivo functions of TSP-1. In vitro, we found that androgens and hypoxia differentially regulated TSP-1 and angiogenic activity. Androgens stimulated normal epithelial cell, but inhibited normal stromal cell, angiogenic activity. Conversely, hypoxia stimulated stromal while inhibiting epithelial activity. Thus, in vivo, net angiogenic activity must reflect cellular interactions. And, we found that media conditioned by epithelial cells grown under normoxic conditions stimulated stromal cell angiogenic activity, and if epithelial cells were grown under hypoxic conditions, stromal activity was further increased. TSP-1 levels, however, were unchanged. In vivo, TSP-1 loss in a mouse model led to prostate epithelial hyperplasia by 3 months of age with only a modest stromal effect. Androgens suppressed TSP-1 as expression increased after castration both in normal mouse prostate and in human prostate cancer tissues. In addition, TSP-1 expression corresponded to increased TGF-beta activation in mouse tissues, specifically in the stromal compartment. These data show a critical role for TSP-1 in prostate epithelial and stromal growth regulation through angiogenic inhibition and activation of latent TGF-beta. Therefore, loss of TSP-1 during tumorigenesis would eliminate two barriers to cancer progression.""","""['Philip P Fitchev', 'Susan M Wcislak', 'Chung Lee', 'Anders Bergh', 'Charles B Brendler', 'Veronica M Stellmach', 'Susan E Crawford', 'Constantine D Mavroudis', 'Mona L Cornwell', 'Jennifer A Doll']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Lab Invest""","""['Stromal transforming growth factor-beta signaling mediates prostatic response to androgen ablation by paracrine Wnt activity.', 'Androgen and prostatic stroma.', 'Pigment epithelium-derived factor regulates the vasculature and mass of the prostate and pancreas.', 'Thrombospondin-1 as an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth.', 'Regulation of tumor angiogenesis by thrombospondin-1.', 'Inorganic Arsenic-Related Changes in the Stromal Tumor Microenvironment in a Prostate Cancer Cell-Conditioned Media Model.', 'Thrombospondins and synaptogenesis.', 'Pathological significance and prognostic role of microvessel density, evaluated using CD31, CD34, and CD105 in prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy with neoadjuvant therapy.', 'Regulation of Tumor Angiogenesis and Choroidal Neovascularization by Endogenous Angioinhibitors.', 'Matricellular proteins in the trabecular meshwork: review and update.']"""

There is also evidence suggesting that PTEN negative regulators (PTEN-NRs) have a role in PTEN inactivation during tumorigenesis, but their identity has remained elusive. Here we have identified shank-interacting protein-like 1 (SIPL1) as a PTEN-NR in human tumor cell lines and human primary cervical cancer cells. Ectopic SIPL1 expression protected human U87 glioma cells from PTEN-mediated growth inhibition and promoted the formation of HeLa cell-derived xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIPL1 expression inhibited the growth of both HeLa cells and DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft tumor model. These inhibitions were reversed by concomitant knockdown of PTEN, demonstrating that SIPL1 affects tumorigenesis via inhibition of PTEN function. Mechanistically, SIPL1 was found to interact with PTEN through its ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) phosphatase activity of PTEN. Furthermore, SIPL1 expression correlated with loss of PTEN function in PTEN-positive human primary cervical cancer tissue.

Patients and methods:   In all, 1826 patients had a first set of 21-core biopsies taken between 2001 and 2008. Among the 801 patients with prostate cancer, 443 had a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RP). Patients were divided into three subsets according to the date of biopsy, i.e. period 1 (2001-2003), period 2 (2004-2005), and period 3 (2006-2008). Study end points were the development over time of: (i) clinico-biological characteristics; (ii) biopsy variables; (iii) pathological RP features; and (iv) the biochemical recurrence-free (RFS) rate after surgery.  Results:   The mean age decreased significantly over time (P = 0.004). The proportion of men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 4-10 ng/mL increased significantly over time at the expense of the proportion of men with a PSA level of ≥ 10 ng/mL (P = 0.004).

Study design:   Prostate cancer patients were approached at urology clinics after diagnosis but prior to starting treatment in California, South Carolina, and Texas. Using a survey about the treatment decision-making process, patients were asked about their likes and dislikes of 5 common treatment options: surgery (prostatectomy), brachytherapy, external beam radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and watchful waiting.  Methods:   Logistic regression identified associations between treatment characteristics and choice of prostatectomy compared with nonsurgical options, controlling for demographic, clinical, and psychological covariates.  Results:   Of the 198 eligible men who returned the baseline survey, 59% indicated they only considered surgery and 41% considered at least 1 nonsurgical option. In multivariate analysis, patients who thought treatment efficacy was a primary concern were significantly more likely to prefer surgery only (odds ratio [OR] = 6.20, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.74, 22.10); those indicating concern about personal burden were significantly more likely to prefer nonsurgical options (OR = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.22). Advice of friends and relatives and concerns over side effects were not significantly associated with preference for surgery versus other treatments.  Conclusions:   Men's perceptions about treatment efficacy and the personal burden of treatment dominated preferences for surgery versus nonsurgical options.

We have developed the most comprehensive panel of miniaturized prostate cell culture models in 3D to date (n = 29), including many non-transformed and most currently available classic prostate cancer (PrCa) cell lines. The purpose of this study was to analyze morphogenetic properties of PrCa models in 3D, to compare phenotypes, gene expression and metabolism between 2D and 3D cultures, and to evaluate their relevance for pre-clinical drug discovery, disease modeling and basic research. Primary and non-transformed prostate epithelial cells, but also several PrCa lines, formed well-differentiated round spheroids. These showed strong cell-cell contacts, epithelial polarization, a hollow lumen and were covered by a complete basal lamina (BL). Most PrCa lines, however, formed large, poorly differentiated spheroids, or aggressively invading structures. In PC-3 and PC-3M cells, well-differentiated spheroids formed, which were then spontaneously transformed into highly invasive cells. These cell lines may have previously undergone an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is temporarily suppressed in favor of epithelial maturation by signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM). The induction of lipid and steroid metabolism, epigenetic reprogramming, and ECM remodeling represents a general adaptation to 3D culture, regardless of transformation and phenotype. In contrast, PI3-Kinase, AKT, STAT/interferon and integrin signaling pathways were particularly activated in invasive cells. Specific small molecule inhibitors targeted against PI3-Kinase blocked invasive cell growth more effectively in 3D than in 2D monolayer culture, or the growth of normal cells.

Very little is known about the mechanisms of Wnt signaling in prostate cancer, a leading cause of death in men. A quantitative analysis of the expression of Wnt5A protein in human tissue arrays, containing 600 prostate tissue cores, showed >50% increase in malignant compared to benign cores (p<0.0001). In a matched pair of prostate cancer and normal cell line, expression of Wnt5A protein was also increased. Calcium waves were induced in prostate cells in response to Wnt5A with a 3 fold increase in Flou-4 intensity. The activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), a transducer of the non-canonical Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling, increased by 8 fold in cancer cells; no change was observed in beta-catenin expression, known to activate the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Mining of publicly available human prostate cancer oligoarray datasets revealed that the expression of numerous genes (e.g., CCND1, CD44) under the control of beta-catenin transcription is down-regulated. Confocal and quantitative electron microscopy showed that specific inhibition of CaMKII in cancer cells causes remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, irregular wound edges and loose intercellular architecture and a 6 and 8 fold increase in the frequency and length of filopodia, respectively. Conversely, untreated normal prostate cells showed an irregular wound edge and loose intercellular architecture; incubation of normal prostate cells with recombinant Wnt5A protein induced actin remodeling with a regular wound edge and increased wound healing capacity. Live cell imaging showed that a functional consequence of CaMKII inhibition was 80% decrease in wound healing capacity and reduced cell motility in cancer cells. We propose that non-canonical Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling via CaMKII acts as a novel regulator of structural plasticity and cell motility in prostate cancer.""","""['Qin Wang', 'Andrew J Symes', 'Corrina A Kane', 'Alex Freeman', 'Joseph Nariculam', 'Philippa Munson', 'Christopher Thrasivoulou', 'John R W Masters', 'Aamir Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Wnt5a signaling is involved in the aggressiveness of prostate cancer and expression of metalloproteinase.', 'Regulation of prostate cancer cell migration toward bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned medium by Wnt5a signaling.', 'WNT5A antagonizes WNT/β-catenin signaling and is frequently silenced by promoter CpG methylation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Hear the Wnt Ror: how melanoma cells adjust to changes in Wnt.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Opposite changes in the expression of clathrin and caveolin-1 in normal and cancerous human prostate tissue: putative clathrin-mediated recycling of EGFR.', 'Non-canonical Wnt signaling in the eye.', 'The IGSF1, Wnt5a, FGF14, and ITPR1 Gene Expression and Prognosis Hallmark of Prostate Cancer.', 'New Insights into the Roles of lncRNAs as Modulators of Cytoskeleton Architecture and Their Implications in Cellular Homeostasis and in Tumorigenesis.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway in prostate cancer and associated drug resistance.']"""

However, it is unclear if these factors are tumor-derived or actually represent the host defense. To analyze the concentrations of tumor- and microenvironment-derived factors associated with neoplastic growth, we used ELISA-based arrays specific for murine or human proteins to establish a profile of tumor- or host-derived factors circulating in the plasma or within the platelets upon human tumor implantation into mice. Many factors characterized as tumor-derived were actually secreted by host tissues. This study uncovered the origin of various cytokines and revealed their circulation methods. We found that tumor-produced cytokines are predominantly sequestered in platelets. Sequestered proteins are protected from degradation and, thus, may be functional at metastatic sites. These findings identify tumor-specific targets for the detection and prevention of tumor growth and metastasis.

MiRNAs' targeting rules are based on sequence complementarity between their mature products and targeted genes' mRNAs. Based on our present understanding of those rules, we developed an algorithm to design artificial miRNAs to target simultaneously a set of predetermined genes. To validate in silico our algorithm, we tested different sets of genes known to be targeted by a single miRNA. The algorithm finds the seed of the corresponding miRNA among the solutions, which also include the seeds of new artificial miRNA sequences potentially capable of targeting these genes as well. We also validated the functionality of some artificial miRNAs designed to target simultaneously members of the E2F family. These artificial miRNAs reproduced the effects of E2Fs inhibition in both normal human fibroblasts and prostate cancer cells where they inhibited cell proliferation and induced cellular senescence. We conclude that the current miRNA targeting rules based on the seed sequence work to design multiple-target artificial miRNAs.

Dietary intake was assessed by using a self-administered questionnaire.

Results:   In 7/369 prostatectomies (1.90%) a ureteric stent insertion was performed, indigo carmine was not applied to any patient at all, yet no intraoperative injury of a ureter was observed by a surgeon. No revision was necessary due to a ureteral injury within the observation period of one year after surgery. In 17 patients with preoperative normal creatinine value a pathological value was observed on the first postoperative day (mean 1.4 mg/dl).

We report that polymers possess differential efficacies for transfecting closely related human prostate cancer cells, which correlates with dramatically different intracellular fate of nanoscale cargo in these cells. Sequestration of nanoscale cargo (27 nm quantum dots and 150-250 nm polyplexes) at a single location near the microtubule organizing compartment (MTOC) in PC3-PSMA human prostate cancer cells correlated with lower polymer-mediated transgene expression compared to PC3 cells, which showed distributed localization throughout the cytoplasm. We show, for the first time, that treatment with the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor tubacin, which acetylates tubulin of microtubules in the cytoplasm, abolished quantum dot and polyplex sequestration at the perinuclear recycling compartment/microtubule organizing center (PNRC/MTOC) and increased polymer-mediated transgene expression by up to forty-fold compared to cells not treated with the HDAC6 inhibitor drug. Treatment with the class I and II HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) demonstrated similar levels of transgene expression enhancement. These results indicate that mediators of intracellular trafficking can be employed to modulate nanoparticle fate and enhance the efficacy of nanoscale therapeutics in cells.

Orthotopic models in mice have been described previously. However, these studies lack a detailed methodological description and fail to define standards for local cell inoculation. Herein, we studied the effect of different protocols on tumor growth and report for the first time the use of high resolution ultrasound for monitoring of tumor growth.  Materials and methods:   Orthotopic inoculation of DU 145 MN1 prostate cancer cells was performed in 30 nude mice varying (1) the amount of cells (5 × 10(5) vs. 5 × 10(4)), (2) the number of puncture sites, and (3) the addition of matrigel. Surgical complications such as recoil of cells through the injection canal and rupture of the prostatic capsule were monitored. Animals were tracked by ultrasound imaging after 4, 5, and 6 weeks. Autopsy and histology confirmed local tumor growth.  Results:   A take rate of 27/30 (90%) was observed. Growth of orthotopic prostate tumors was increased after inoculation of a large amount of cells under the capsule of 1 dorsal prostate lobe, but inoculation of small amounts of cells still induced local tumors. Noninvasive ultrasound examination allowed to identify orthotopic tumor formation and to monitor tumor growth in vivo. Addition of matrigel did not accelerate tumor growth. Complications like recoil (6.8%) or rupture of the prostate capsule (1.4%) were rare.

Adenocarcinoma (186 [98.4%]) was the main histopathology type and most patients 136 (71.9%) had bilateral orchidectomy with or without antiandrogens. Mean duration of follow-up was 83.7 weeks.  Conclusions:   The burden of prostate cancer in our developing community is worrisome. It is prevalent between 46 and 99 years in our community. Presentation is late, often with urinary retention and other complications. In our setting, treatment is still essentially palliative with orchidectomy, which we found to be beneficial, acceptable, and the most affordable to our patients.""","""['Tajudeen A Badmus', 'Abdul-Rasheed K Adesunkanmi', 'Babatunde M Yusuf', 'Ganiyu O Oseni', 'Amogu K Eziyi', 'Tajudeen I B Bakare', 'James A Adetiloye', 'Sarat A Badmus']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Urology""","""['An overview of cancer of the prostate diagnosis and management in Nigeria: the experience in a Nigerian tertiary hospital.', 'Prostate cancer in Maiduguri.', 'Malignant renal tumors in adults: a ten-year review in a Nigerian hospital.', 'Prostate cancer after prostatectomy for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Cutaneous metastasis from prostate cancer in a nigerian: a case report and literature review.', 'Surgical androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer in patients of African descent: comparison of biochemical efficacy of bilateral total and subcapsular orchidectomy.', 'Prostate Cancer and Challenges in Management in a Semi-urban Centre: A 10-year Experience.', 'Prostate cancer characteristics: A descriptive analysis of clinical features at presentation in the last decade in a black African community.', 'Mapping Evidence on the Burden of Breast, Cervical, and Prostate Cancers in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Scoping Review.', 'A Bone Scan Is Valuable for Primary Staging of Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer in a Low-Resource Setting (Nigeria).']"""

Materials and methods:   Medical histories of 146 consecutive Chinese males with newly diagnosed mHSPC, registered in our institution in 2006 and 2007, were reviewed. All of these patients received CAB as initial systematic therapy. Demographics and cancer control outcomes from 39 mHSPC patients who underwent TURP for a relief of bladder outlet obstruction were compared with those of the other 107 who received CAB only when they were still hormone-sensitive. Median follow-up was 15 months (3 to 27 months).  Results:   Age at diagnosis, baseline PSA, and biopsy Gleason score were comparable between the 2 groups. Patients who underwent a TURP had lower PSA nadir (median 0.15 ng/ml vs. 0.82 ng/ml, P = 0.015) and longer time to PSA nadir (11.2 months vs. 6.4 months, P < 0.001).

Methods:   Five hundred fifty consecutive patients who had undergone a transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal prostate biopsy were evaluated retrospectively for the presence and follow-up of focal proliferative atrophy lesions. PIA/PA were defined according to De Marzo. The prevalence of atrophy in PCa and negative biopsy cores was compared by means of χ(2). After logarithmic transformations of the PSA values, t-test and ANOVA were applied for the comparison of the means. Incidence of newly diagnosed PCa during follow-up (mean 33.7 months) in patients with or without focal proliferative atrophy was compared by means of χ(2).  Results:   A focal atrophic lesion resulted in 161/339 negative biopsies. PIA was observed in 93/161 patients (57.8%), while PA was observed in the remaining 68/161 (42.2%). Among the negative biopsy cases, the difference in PSA values were not statistically significant according to the presence or absence of atrophy (P = 0.120). The group of negative biopsies with PIA was similar in terms of PSA characteristics with the benign (PA P = 0.738; non-atrophy P = 0.342), and cancer subgroups (P = 0.094); 245/339 (72.3%) patients were successfully followed-up. Biopsy was repeated in 24/71 (33.8%) patients with PIA, in 14/50 (28%) with PA and in 27/124 (21.7%) with no atrophy lesions at initial biopsy. The incidence of newly diagnosed PCa in the 3 groups was not statistically different (χ(2), P = 0.81).  Conclusions:   Focal proliferative atrophy lesions are a common finding in biopsy specimens negative for PCa. Patients with negative biopsy associated with PIA presented similar PSA characteristics as patients with biopsy-proven PCa. However, the incidence of PCa at short-term follow-up did not differ significantly between patients with PIA, PA, or no atrophic lesions at initial biopsy.

Materials and methods:   Androgen-independent C4-2 prostate cancer cells were co-cultured with various osteoblastic cells in a transwell system. Proliferation was measured via cell counting and MTT assay. Lactate and PSA were determined in the conditioned media (CM). Transcriptional activity of the full-length PSA promoter (6.1 kilobases) and of 3 deletion constructs was determined via luciferase reporter assay upon exposure to CM from various osteoblastic cell lines.  Results:   Osteoblastic bone cells and CM, but not control cells (fibroblast) or CM, reproducibly stimulated the proliferation of C4-2 cells. The co-culture system, PSA production by C4-2 cells transiently decreased when in co-culture with osteoblastic, but not with control cells. After abundant prostate cell proliferation, the secreted PSA levels rose exponentially. Addition of CM from osteoblastic cells, but not control cells, consistently decreased (about 3-fold) the transcriptional activity of the PSA promoter in C4-2 cells. Deletion construct analysis of the PSA promoter revealed that the transcriptional down-regulation is dually controlled by elements close to the TATA and upstream androgen responsive (ARE(III)) components.  Conclusions:   The osteoblastic environment stimulates prostate cancer cell proliferation but reduces PSA production initially. The mechanism of PSA down-regulation is transcriptional, most likely in response to soluble factors present in the osteoblastic bone stromal cell CM. Transcriptional down-regulation appears to be mediated by elements near both the TATA box and the ARE(III) component.""","""['Yingming Li', 'Robert A Sikes', 'Bahaa S Malaeb', 'Fan Yeung', 'Andrew Law', 'Sarah E Graham', 'Min Pei', 'Chinghai Kao', 'Joel Nelson', 'Kenneth S Koeneman', 'Leland W K Chung']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Dissociation between androgen responsiveness for malignant growth vs. expression of prostate specific differentiation markers PSA, hK2, and PSMA in human prostate cancer models.', 'Autocrine regulation of prostate-specific antigen gene expression in a human prostatic cancer (LNCaP) subline.', 'Osteoblasts induce prostate cancer proliferation and PSA expression through interleukin-6-mediated activation of the androgen receptor.', 'Human prostate cancer progression models and therapeutic intervention.', 'Research on the structure of the PSA promoter and the mechanisms of its expression regulation.', 'Osteoblasts Promote Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation Through Androgen Receptor Independent Mechanisms.', 'Studies of hormonal regulation, phenotype plasticity, bone metastasis, and experimental therapeutics in androgen-repressed human prostate cancer (ARCaP) model.', 'SULF1 suppresses Wnt3A-driven growth of bone metastatic prostate cancer in perlecan-modified 3D cancer-stroma-macrophage triculture models.', 'Osteoblastic Factors in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Proteomics Profiling of Exosomes from Primary Mouse Osteoblasts under Proliferation versus Mineralization Conditions and Characterization of Their Uptake into Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Material and methods:   Eighty-two MRI examinations of the prostate were retrospectively analysed. MRI was performed with a combined endorectal/body phased-array coil including proton density-weighted (PD) sequence, T1-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE)-sequence, and T2-weighted TSE-sequences. Forty milligrams of butylscopolamine was administered intramuscularly in 31 patients (im-group) and intravenously in 30 patients (iv-group). Twenty-one patients did not receive premedication with butylscopolamine (ø-group). Overall image quality, delineation of the bowel wall, and visualization of the prostate, neurovascular bundle, and pelvic lymph nodes were evaluated qualitatively using a five-point scale (from 1=excellent to 5=non-diagnostic/structure not discernible). Motion artefacts within the endorectal coil were quantified by baseline adjusted signal intensities inside the endorectal coil area.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on data from patients who underwent a TP by a single surgeon from 1992 to 2008. The patients were divided into two groups according to the time interval between biopsy and TP, Group 1 < or = 6 weeks and Group 2 > 6 weeks. Relevant perioperative variables and outcome were analyzed.  Results:   923 patients were included. There was a significant difference between the two groups in the surgeons' ability to perform a bilateral nerve sparing procedure. Those who had a TP within six weeks of the biopsy were less likely to have a bilateral nerve sparing procedure. No significant difference was noted in the other variables, which included Gleason score, surgical margin status, estimated blood loss, post-operative infection, incontinence, erectile function, and biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   TP can be safely performed without any increase in complications within 6 weeks of a prostate biopsy.

However, lack of an established abnormal threshold and the presence of other benign processes confound the interpretation of PSA levels. Many factors besides inflammation, trauma, and instrumentation can influence PSA levels; specifically, BPH and its associated medical and surgical therapies frequently complicate the interpretation of this serum blood test. For example, the commonly used 5 alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI) medications directly affect PSA levels by decreasing prostate volume. The amount of time and potentially even the 5ARI formulary a patient is administered has been implicated to directly impact the degree of reduction in PSA (a proxy for prostate volume). In addition, each of the currently available surgical procedures for BPH appears to remove varying amounts of prostatic adenoma. This directly confounds CaP screening because each procedure is associated with a relatively specific postoperative nadir PSA level, and PSA kinetics are not well described in the literature. Taken together, it is important for clinicians to comprehend that BPH and its associated medical and surgical interventions should directly influence their interpretation of PSA and PSA velocity when screening for CaP or following BPH progression.""","""['Parth Modi', 'Brian T Helfand', 'Kevin T McVary']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Curr Urol Rep""","""['5ARI and PSA: therapeutic aspects.', 'Postoperative PSA and PSA velocity identify presence of prostate cancer after various surgical interventions for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', '5ARI and PSA: evidences.', 'The utility of serum prostatic-specific antigen in the management of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Serum-to-urinary prostate-specific antigen ratio in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Rates of False-Negative Screening in Prostate Specific Antigen Secondary to 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitor Usage: A Quality-Improvement Initiative.', 'Comparative analysis of benign prostatic hyperplasia management by urologists and nonurologists: a Korean nationwide health insurance database study.']"""

We conducted the first phase I trial of an Ii-Key/HER-2/neu(776-790) hybrid peptide vaccine (AE37) with recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor as adjuvant in patients with HER-2/neu(+) prostate cancer. The primary end points of the study were to evaluate toxicity and monitor patients' immune responses to the vaccine.  Experimental design:   Thirty-two HER-2/neu(+), castrate-sensitive, and castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients were enrolled. Of these, 29 patients completed all six vaccination cycles with AE37. Immunologic responses in the total patient population were monitored by delayed-type hypersensitivity and IFN-gamma ELISPOT and intracellular staining. Regulatory T-cell (Treg) frequency and plasma HER-2/neu and transforming growth factor-beta levels were also determined. Immunologic responses were also analyzed among groups of patients with different clinical characteristics. Local/systemic toxicities were monitored throughout the study.  Results:   Toxicities beyond grade 2 were not observed. Seventy-five percent of patients developed augmented immunity to the AE37 vaccine and 65% to the unmodified AE36 peptide as detected in the IFN-gamma-based ELISPOT assay. Intracellular IFN-gamma analyses revealed that AE37 elicited both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses. Eighty percent of the patients developed a positive delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to AE36. Additionally, significant decreases could be detected in circulating Treg frequencies, plasma HER-2/neu, and serum transforming growth factor-beta levels. Patients with less extensive disease developed better immunologic responses on vaccination.

Expression patterns were dependent on phases of the cell cycle and associated with repressed basal gene expression of vitamin D receptor and PPARalpha/gamma target genes, for example CDKN1A [encodes p21((waf1/cip1))]. Elevated nuclear corepressor 1 (NCOR1) and nuclear corepressor 2/silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor protein levels were detected in prostate cancer cell lines compared with non-malignant counterparts. Knockdown of the corepressor NCOR1 significantly elevated basal expression of a cohort of target genes, including CDKN1A. Both chemical [histone deacetylases inhibitor (HDACi)] and NCOR1 knockdown targeting enhanced anti-proliferative sensitivity toward PPARalpha/gamma ligands in prostate cancer cell lines. Pursuing PPARalpha/gamma signaling, microarray approaches were undertaken to identify pathways and genes regulated uniquely by a combination of PPARalpha/gamma activation and HDAC inhibition. Again, HDACi and knockdown approaches demonstrated that elevated NCOR1 expression and activity distorted PPARalpha/gamma gene targets centered on, for example cell cycle control, including CDKN1A and TGFBRAP1. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction validation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays both confirmed that elevated NCOR1 disrupted the ability of PPARalpha/gamma to regulate key target genes (CDKN1A and TGFBRAP1). Interrogation of these relationships in prostate cancer samples using principal component and partial correlation analyses established significant interdependent relationships between NCOR1-PPARalpha/gamma and representative target genes, independently of androgen receptor expression.

Phytosterols had the opposite effect by inducing overexpression of cav-1, a known mediator of androgen-dependent signals that presumably control cell growth or apoptosis.  Conclusions:   Cholesterol and phytosterol treatment differentially regulated the growth of prostate cancer cells and the expression of p53 and cav-1, a gene that regulates androgen-regulated signals. These sterols also differentially regulated cell cycle arrest, downstream pro-apoptotic androgen-regulated tumor suppressor, NDRG1 suggesting that cav-1 may mediate pro-apoptotic NDRG1 signals. Elucidation of the mechanism for sterol modulation of growth and apoptosis signaling may reveal potential targets for cancer prevention and/or chemotherapeutic intervention. Sterol regulation of NDRG1 transcription suggests its potential as biomarker for prediction of neoplasms that would be responsive to chemoprevention by phytosterols.""","""['Godwin O Ifere', 'Anita Equan', 'Kereen Gordon', 'Peri Nagappan', 'Joseph U Igietseme', 'Godwin A Ananaba']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Differential effects of cholesterol and phytosterols on cell proliferation, apoptosis and expression of a prostate specific gene in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'The metastasis suppressor, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), upregulates p21 via p53-independent mechanisms.', 'L-Mimosine blocks cell proliferation via upregulation of B-cell translocation gene 2 and N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Pharmacological targeting and the diverse functions of the metastasis suppressor, NDRG1, in cancer.', 'The role of the NDRG1 in the pathogenesis and treatment of breast cancer.', ""3,5-Diethoxy-3'-Hydroxyresveratrol (DEHR) Ameliorates Liver Fibrosis via Caveolin-1 Activation in Hepatic Stellate Cells and in a Mouse Model of Bile Duct Ligation Injury."", 'Mechanism of inhibition of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli SubAB cytotoxicity by steroids and diacylglycerol analogues.', 'Emergent trends in the reported incidence of prostate cancer in Nigeria.']"""

Transcriptional silencing of apoptosis-related genes associated with aberrant promoter methylation may impair the apoptotic machinery, ultimately leading to cancer development. Aberrant promoter methylation of numerous genes involved in many different pathways is frequent in prostate cancer. Our aim was to quantitatively assess the methylation status of several apoptosis-related genes in prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) and its precursor lesion, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). First, 120 PCa and 39 HGPIN were screened for altered expression of BCL2, CASP8, CASP3, DAPK DR3, DR4, DR6, FAS, TMS1, TNFR2, using 28 benign prostate hyperplasias and 10 normal prostates as controls. Underexpressed genes were then assessed by quantitative methylation-specific PCR to determine the promoter methylation status. Finally, quantitative mRNA expression of aberrantly methylated genes was performed and methylation data was correlated with standard clinicopathologic parameters. DAPK, DR4 and TNFR2 were significantly overexpressed in HGPIN and PCa, whereas BCL2, TMS1, and FAS were downregulated. Although methylation levels were significantly higher for TMS1 and BCL2 (correlating with advanced stage), an inverse correlation with mRNA expression was found only for BCL2. We concluded that the apoptotic pathways are largely preserved in prostate carcinogenesis, in particular the extrinsic pathway, with the exception of FAS and TMS1, which are epigenetically downregulated. In addition, BCL2 was also found to be frequently silenced in PCa due to aberrant promoter methylation, thus supporting a future role for apoptosis-targeted therapy in prostate cancer.""","""['João R Carvalho', 'Luísa Filipe', 'Vera L Costa', 'Franclim Ricardo Ribeiro', 'Ana T Martins', 'Manuel R Teixeira', 'Carmen Jerónimo', 'Rui Henrique']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Apoptosis""","""['MT1G hypermethylation is associated with higher tumor stage in prostate cancer.', 'DNA methylation paradigm shift: 15-lipoxygenase-1 upregulation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer by atypical promoter hypermethylation.', 'A quantitative promoter methylation profile of prostate cancer.', 'Apoptotic regulators in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN): value in prostate cancer detection and prevention.', 'The emergence of DNA methylation as a key modulator of aberrant cell death in prostate cancer.', 'Aberrant Hypermethylation-Mediated Suppression of PYCARD Is Extremely Frequent in Prostate Cancer with Gleason Score\u2009≥\u20097.', 'Flavonoids as Epigenetic Modulators for Prostate Cancer Prevention.', 'Targeting DNA Methyltranferases in Urological Tumors.', 'MicroRNA-27a-5p regulation by promoter methylation and MYC signaling in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Advances in prostate cancer research models: From transgenic mice to tumor xenografting models.']"""

This study develops a polychotomous logistic regression (PR) model and an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting biopsy results, particularly for clinically significant PC.  Methods:   There were 3,025 men undergoing TRUS-guided biopsy (BX) with PSA <10 ng/ml selected. BX outcome classified as benign, atypical small acinar proliferation or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (ASAP/PIN), non-significant (NSPC) or clinically significant PC (CSPC). PR and ANN models were developed to distinguish between BX categories. Predictors were age, PSA, abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE), positive transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and prostate volume.  Results:   Among the BXs, 44% were benign, 14% ASAP/PIN, 16% NSPC and 25% CSPC. Median age, PSA and volume were 64 years, 5.7 ng/ml and 50 cc. TRUS lesion was present in 47%, and DRE was abnormal in 39%.

For PR and ANN, 74-78% ASAP/PIN predicted benign, 2% NSPC and 20-24% CSPC. For NSPC, 69-71% predicted benign, 27-29% CSPC. Benign outcomes were well identified (86-88%), although 12-13% classified CSPC. CSPC was correctly identified in 65-66% with misclassifications largely benign (33% for PR and ANN).

Despite advances in understanding, detection, and treatment, it accounts for almost one-fourth of all deaths per year in Western countries. Prostate cancer is currently the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous cancer in men in Europe and the United States, accounting for 15% of all cancers in men. As life expectancy of individuals increases, it is expected that there will also be an increase in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer may be inoperable at initial presentation, unresponsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or recur following appropriate treatment. At the time of presentation, patients may already have metastases in their tissues. Preventing tumor recurrence requires systemic therapy; however, current modalities are limited by toxicity or lack of efficacy. For patients with such metastatic cancers, the development of alternative therapies is essential. Gene therapy is a realistic prospect for the treatment of prostate and other cancers, and involves the delivery of genetic information to the patient to facilitate the production of therapeutic proteins. Therapeutics can act directly (eg, by inducing tumor cells to produce cytotoxic agents) or indirectly by upregulating the immune system to efficiently target tumor cells or by destroying the tumor's vasculature. However, technological difficulties must be addressed before an efficient and safe gene medicine is achieved (primarily by developing a means of delivering genes to the target cells or tissue safely and efficiently). A wealth of research has been carried out over the past 20 years, involving various strategies for the treatment of prostate cancer at preclinical and clinical trial levels. The therapeutic efficacy observed with many of these approaches in patients indicates that these treatment modalities will serve as an important component of urological malignancy treatment in the clinic, either in isolation or in combination with current approaches.""","""['Mark Tangney', 'Sarfraz Ahmad', 'Sara A Collins', ""Gerald C O'Sullivan""]""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Postgrad Med""","""['Development of antituberculous drugs: current status and future prospects.', 'Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Prospects and limitations of recombinant poxviruses for prostate cancer immunotherapy.', 'New prospectives of prostate cancer gene therapy: molecular targets and animal models.', 'Is gene therapy the answer for prostate cancer?', 'Bacteria and tumours: causative agents or opportunistic inhabitants?', 'Bioluminescent bacterial imaging in vivo.', 'DNA vaccination for prostate cancer, from preclinical to clinical trials - where we stand?', 'In vitro and in vivo double-enhanced suicide gene therapy mediated by generation 5 polyamidoamine dendrimers for PC-3 cell line.', 'AAV2-mediated in vivo immune gene therapy of solid tumours.']"""

Apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth were investigated by Western blotting.  Results:   Androgen-dependent and -independent human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC3, respectively), androgen-dependent and -independent murine prostate cancer cell lines (CASP2.1 and CASP1.1, respectively), as well as noncancerous human benign prostate hyperplasia BPH-1 cell line, were used in the study.

Correspondingly, overexpression of CARM1 has been associated with the development of prostate cancer (PCa) and its progression to androgen-independent PCa. In our preliminary study, however, the promoting effects of CARM1, with regard to androgen-stimulated AR target gene expression were minimal. These results suggested that the AR target gene expression associated with CARM1 may result primarily from non-hormone dependent activity. The goal of this study was to confirm the pattern of expression of CARM1 in human tumors and determine the mechanism of action in CARM1 overexpressed tumors.  Methods:   Tissue microarray was used to determine the pattern of expression of CARM1 in human cancers by immunohistochemistry. CARM1 expression was also evaluated in prostate and colorectal surgical specimens and the clinical records of all cases were reviewed. In addition, a reporter transcription assay using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter was used to identify the signaling pathways involved in non-hormone-mediated signal activation associated with CARM1.  Results:   The tissue microarray showed that CARM1 was particularly overexpressed in the colorectal cancers while CARM1 expression was not prevalent in the prostate and breast cancers. Further studies using surgical specimens demonstrated that CARM1 was highly overexpressed in 75% of colorectal cancers (49 out of 65) but not in the androgen-independent PCa. In addition, CARM1's coactivating effect on the entire PSA promoter was very limited in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa cells. These results suggest that there are other factors associated with CARM1 expression in PSA regulation. Indeed, CARM1 significantly regulated both p53 and NF-kappaB target gene transcription.  Conclusions:   The results of this study suggest that, in addition to its role in activation of steroid receptors, CARM1 functions as a transcriptional modulator by altering the activity of many transcriptional factors, especially with regard to androgen independent PCa and colorectal cancers.""","""['Young-Rang Kim', 'Byung Kook Lee', 'Ra-Young Park', 'Nguyen Thi Xuan Nguyen', 'Jeong A Bae', 'Dong Deuk Kwon', 'Chaeyong Jung']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Involvement of arginine methyltransferase CARM1 in androgen receptor function and prostate cancer cell viability.', 'Aberrant expression of CARM1, a transcriptional coactivator of androgen receptor, in the development of prostate carcinoma and androgen-independent status.', 'The RNA helicase p68 is a novel androgen receptor coactivator involved in splicing and is overexpressed in prostate cancer.', 'The transcriptional regulation of miR-21, its multiple transcripts, and their implication in prostate cancer.', 'Coupling transcription to RNA processing via the p68 DEAD box RNA helicase androgen receptor co-activator in prostate cancer.', 'Discovery and biological evaluation of novel CARM1/HDAC2 dual-targeting inhibitors with anti-prostate cancer agents.', 'Targeting Fatty Acid Reprogramming Suppresses CARM1-expressing Ovarian Cancer.', 'H3 histone methylation landscape in male urogenital cancers: from molecular mechanisms to epigenetic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.', 'ESRP1-regulated isoform switching of LRRFIP2 determines metastasis of gastric cancer.', 'Improving TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancers by interfering with histone modifications.']"""

However, the biological impact of ETS factors in prostate tumorigenesis is still debated.  Methodology/principal findings:   We performed an analysis of the ETS gene family using microarray data and real-time PCR in normal and tumor tissues along with functional studies in normal and cancer cell lines to understand the impact in prostate tumorigenesis and identify key targets of these transcription factors. We found frequent dysregulation of ETS genes with oncogenic (i.e., ERG and ESE1) and tumor suppressor (i.e., ESE3) properties in prostate tumors compared to normal prostate. Tumor subgroups (i.e., ERG(high), ESE1(high), ESE3(low) and NoETS tumors) were identified on the basis of their ETS expression status and showed distinct transcriptional and biological features. ERG(high) and ESE3(low) tumors had the most robust gene signatures with both distinct and overlapping features. Integrating genomic data with functional studies in multiple cell lines, we demonstrated that ERG and ESE3 controlled in opposite direction transcription of the Polycomb Group protein EZH2, a key gene in development, differentiation, stem cell biology and tumorigenesis. We further demonstrated that the prostate-specific tumor suppressor gene Nkx3.1 was controlled by ERG and ESE3 both directly and through induction of EZH2.  Conclusions/significance:   These findings provide new insights into the role of the ETS transcriptional network in prostate tumorigenesis and uncover previously unrecognized links between aberrant expression of ETS factors, deregulation of epigenetic effectors and silencing of tumor suppressor genes.

Ectopic expression of the AR N-terminal (AR-N) domain, which lacks DNA- and ligand-binding abilities, led to cell death without any additional death stimuli.

The main radiotherapy uncertainties considered and used to build the model were delineation, set-up and organ motion-induced errors. The radiobiological effects of these combined errors, in terms of prostate tumour control probability and rectal normal tissue complication probability, were used to formulate the rule base and membership functions for a Sugeno type fuzzy system linking the error effect to the treatment margin. The defuzzified output was optimized by convolving it with a Gaussian convolution kernel to give a uniformly varying transfer function which was used to calculate the required treatment margins. The margin derived using the fuzzy technique showed good agreement compared to current prostate margins based on the commonly used margin formulation proposed by van Herk et al (2000 Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 47 1121-35), and has nonlinear variation above combined errors of 5 mm standard deviation. The derived margin is on average 0.5 mm bigger than currently used margins in the region of small treatment uncertainties where margin reduction would be applicable.

We aimed at determining subsequent cancer risks in patients hospitalized for T2D in Sweden.  Methods:   T2D patients were obtained from the nationwide Hospital Discharge Register; cancers were recorded from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for cancer following last hospitalization for T2D. The comparison group was the general Swedish population.  Results:   The number of hospitalized T2D patients from 1964 to 2007 was 125,126, of whom 26,641 had an affected family member. Altogether 24 cancers showed an elevated risk when follow-up was started after the last hospitalization. The highest SIRs were for pancreatic (6.08) and liver (4.25) cancers. The incidences of these cancers were even elevated when follow-up was started 5 years after the last hospitalization for T2D, with primary liver cancer showing the highest SIR of 4.66. Also increased were the incidences of upper aerodigestive tract, esophageal, colon, rectal, pancreatic, lung, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, and kidney cancers. Prostate cancer showed a lower risk. Familial T2D patients showed no exceptional elevated cancer risks but their prostate cancer and melanoma risks were lower.  Conclusions:   This study, covering approximately one half of Swedish T2D patients, showed an elevated risk for several cancers after hospitalization for T2D, probably indicating the profound metabolic disturbances of the underlying disease. The highest risks were found for liver and pancreatic cancers. No excess cancer risks were observed in familial diabetics.

Objective:   To assess the cost-effectiveness of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) before initiating ADT followed by alendronate therapy in men with localized prostate cancer.  Design:   Markov state-transition model simulating the progression of prostate cancer and the incidence of hip fracture.  Data sources:   Published literature.  Target population:   A hypothetical cohort of men aged 70 years with locally advanced or high-risk localized prostate cancer starting a 2-year course of ADT after radiation therapy.  Time horizon:   Lifetime.  Perspective:   Societal.  Intervention:   No BMD test or alendronate therapy, a BMD test followed by selective alendronate therapy for patients with osteoporosis, or universal alendronate therapy without a BMD test.  Outcome measures:   Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), measured by cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.  Results of base-case analysis:   The ICERs for the strategy of a BMD test and selective alendronate therapy for patients with osteoporosis and universal alendronate therapy without a BMD test were $66,800 per QALY gained and $178,700 per QALY gained, respectively.  Results of sensitivity analyses:   The ICER for universal alendronate therapy without a BMD test decreased to $100,000 per QALY gained, assuming older age, a history of fractures, lower mean BMD before ADT, or a lower cost of alendronate.  Limitations:   No evidence shows that alendronate reduces actual fracture rates in patients with prostate cancer who receive ADT. The model predicted fracture rates by using data on the surrogate BMD end point.  Conclusion:   In patients starting adjuvant ADT for locally advanced or high-risk localized prostate cancer, a BMD test followed by selective alendronate for those with osteoporosis is a cost-effective use of resources. Routine use of alendronate without a BMD test is justifiable in patients at higher risk for hip fractures.""","""['Kouta Ito', 'Elena B Elkin', 'Monica Girotra', 'Michael J Morris']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ann Intern Med""","""['Prostate cancer: Is fracture prevention therapy cost-effective in patients with prostate cancer treated with ADT?', 'Socioeconomic factors, urological epidemiology and practice patterns.', 'Health-economic comparison of three recommended drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis.', 'A systematic review and economic evaluation of alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene and teriparatide for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.', 'Alendronate decreases the fracture risk in patients with prostate cancer on androgen-deprivation therapy and with severe osteopenia or osteoporosis.', 'A phase 3, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of oral weekly alendronate for the prevention of androgen deprivation bone loss in nonmetastatic prostate cancer: the Cancer and Osteoporosis Research with Alendronate and Leuprolide (CORAL) study.', 'Androgen-deprivation-therapy-induced fractures in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer: what do we really know?', 'Cost Effectiveness Analyses of Interventions for Osteoporosis in Men: A Systematic Literature Review.', 'Cost-effectiveness of Screening for Osteoporosis in Older Men With a History of Falls.', 'Quantitative CT Detects Undiagnosed Low Bone Mineral Density in Oncologic Patients Imaged With 18F-FDG PET/CT.', 'Cost-effectiveness of single-dose zoledronic acid for nursing home residents with osteoporosis in the USA.', 'The implications of baseline bone-health assessment at initiation of androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 3,458 consecutive patients underwent open radical prostatectomy and 98 underwent open salvage radical prostatectomy from January 1999 to June 2007. Data were collected from prospective surgical and institutional morbidity databases, and retrospectively from billing records and medical records. Medical and surgical complications were captured, graded by the modified Clavien classification and classified by time of onset.  Results:   Median followup after salvage radical prostatectomy and radical prostatectomy was 34.5 and 45.5 months, respectively. Patients with salvage had significantly higher median age, modified Charlson comorbidity score, clinical and pathological stage, and Gleason score. They were less likely to have organ confined disease and more likely to have seminal vesicle invasion and nodal metastasis. There was no significant difference in median operative time, blood loss or transfusion rate. The salvage group had a higher adjusted probability of medical and surgical complications, including urinary tract infection, bladder neck contracture, urinary retention, urinary fistula, abscess and rectal injury. Only 1 of 4 potent patients with salvage prostatectomy who underwent bilateral nerve sparing recovered erection adequate for intercourse. The 3-year actuarial recovery of continence was 30% (95% CI 19-41).

In fact, some patients with favorable risk disease at diagnosis harbor more aggressive disease and may be at risk for prostate cancer mortality despite close monitoring. This is a detailed report of 5 of 453 patients on surveillance who died of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A large phase 2 prospective trial of active surveillance in patients with favorable risk prostate cancer was initiated in 1995. Eligible patients had favorable risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, Gleason 6 or less, T1c/T2a). Epstein criteria for clinically insignificant prostate cancer (a third or less of cores positive, 50% or less involvement of any 1 core, and prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15) were used for men younger than 55 years. Patients were followed with serial prostate specific antigen determinations every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months if stable. Biopsies were performed at 1 year and then every 3 to 4 years. Radical intervention was offered if prostate specific antigen doubling time was less than 3 years or Gleason 3 + 4 pattern disease was identified on repeat biopsy. For the first 5 years of the study patients older than 70 years were eligible if they had Gleason 3 + 4 or less, or prostate specific antigen less than 15 ng/ml.  Results:   The rate of intervention with radiation or surgery was 38% at 10 years (actuarial). All 5 patients had a prostate specific antigen doubling time of 1.6 years or less triggering a recommendation of radical therapy. Radical intervention was performed in 3 of the 5 patients. Patients 1 and 4 received radiation and patient 3 underwent radical prostatectomy. Of the 2 patients who did not receive definitive treatment 1 was lost to followup (patient 2) and was treated conservatively by his family doctor. Patient 5 elected androgen deprivation therapy rather than radical treatment.  Conclusions:   The low prostate cancer mortality in our surveillance cohort provides support for an active surveillance approach to favorable risk prostate cancer. Only 1 of the 5 patients presented with favorable disease and experienced a theoretically preventable death. The absence of preventable deaths suggests that the basic approach is sound.

Materials and methods:   Of 207 patients with lymph node metastasis treated with radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection 45 received adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and 162 did not. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate predictors of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Recurrence probability was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   A median of 13 lymph nodes were removed. Of the patients 122 had 1, 44 had 2 and 41 had 3 or greater positive lymph nodes. Of patients without androgen deprivation therapy 103 had 1, 35 had 2 and 24 had 3 or greater positive lymph nodes while 69 experienced biochemical recurrence. Median time to recurrence in patients with 1, 2 and 3 or greater lymph nodes was 59, 13 and 3 months, respectively. Only specimen Gleason score and the number of positive lymph nodes were independent predictors of biochemical recurrence. Recurrence-free probability 2 years after prostatectomy in men without androgen deprivation with 1 positive lymph node and a prostatectomy Gleason score of 7 or less was 79% vs 29% in those with Gleason score 8 or greater and 2 or more positive lymph nodes.  Conclusions:   Prognosis in patients with lymph node metastasis depends on the number of positive lymph nodes and primary tumor Gleason grade. Of all patients with lymph node metastasis 80% had 1 or 2 positive nodes. A large subset of those patients had a favorable prognosis. Full bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection should be done in patients with intermediate and high risk cancer to identify those likely to benefit from metastatic node removal.""","""['Christian von Bodman', 'Guilherme Godoy', 'Daher C Chade', 'Angel Cronin', 'Laura J Tafe', 'Samson W Fine', 'Vincent Laudone', 'Peter T Scardino', 'James A Eastham']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Re: Predicting biochemical recurrence-free survival for patients with positive pelvic lymph nodes at radical prostatectomy: C.

However, biochemical recurrence affects 15% to 30% of men who undergo radical prostatectomy. We previously reported the prognostic potential of PITX2 gene promoter methylation using conventional assays. In the current study we validated PITX2 methylation status as a biochemical recurrence predictor after radical prostatectomy using a novel microarray based platform in a multi-institutional setting.  Materials and methods:   PITX2 methylation status was assessed in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded prostatectomy tumor tissue samples from 476 patients from a total of 4 institutions on customized EpiChip PITX2 microarrays. Associations between PITX2 methylation and biochemical recurrence were assessed using the log rank test and Cox regression controlling for prostate cancer features.  Results:   On multivariate analysis men with high methylation status were at significantly higher risk for biochemical recurrence than those with low methylation status (HR 3.0, 95% CI 2.0-4.5, p <10(-5)). The biochemical recurrence-free survival rate 5 years after surgery was 85% and 61% in the low and high methylation groups, respectively. In men with pathological Gleason 7 tumors the relative risk of biochemical recurrence was twice as high for high than for low PITX2 methylation (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3, p = 0.005).  Conclusions:   PITX2 methylation status assessed by EpiChip PITX2 identifies patients with prostate cancer who are most likely to have biochemical recurrence. This test independently adds to the prognostic information provided by standard clinicopathological analysis, improving prostatectomy case stratification into those at high and low risk for biochemical recurrence.

We hypothesize that in the context of data available from a contemporary biopsy, clinical stage no longer offers meaningful independent prognostic information for clinically localized prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We performed an analysis of men in the CaPSURE database with localized (clinical stage T1 or T2) prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. The usefulness of clinical stage and other clinical parameters (prostate specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score, percent of positive biopsy cores) to predict pathological outcomes and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy was assessed using univariate and multivariable analyses.  Results:   Of the 4,899 men in the study cohort 51.9% were classified as having T1 disease and 48.1% T2 disease. On univariate analysis clinical stages T2b and T2c were associated with pathological outcomes but only stage T2b was associated with biochemical recurrence. In contrast prostate specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score and percent of positive biopsy cores were strongly associated with recurrence and adverse pathological outcomes. On multivariable analysis clinical stage was of no use in determining pathological or biochemical outcomes.  Conclusions:   In a multivariable model, including serum prostate specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score and percent of positive biopsy cores, clinical stage offered no independent information in predicting biochemical recurrence.

Therefore, more effective therapeutic approaches are needed. It is known that aberrant epigenetics contributes to prostate malignancy. Unlike genetic changes, these epigenetic alterations are reversible, which makes them attractive targets in PCa therapy to impede cancer progression. As a histone methyltransferase, Ezh2 plays an essential role in epigenetic regulation. Since Ezh2 is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene in PCa, it has been proposed as a bona fide target of PCa therapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression through modulating protein translation. Recently, the contribution of miRNAs in cancer development is increasingly appreciated. In this report, we present our study showing that microRNA-101 (miR-101) inhibits Ezh2 expression and differentially regulates prostate cancer cells. In addition, the expression of miR-101 alters upon androgen treatment and HIF-1alpha/HIF-1beta induction.  Result:   In our reporter assays, both miR-101 and miR-26a inhibit the expression of a reporter construct containing the 3'-UTR of Ezh2. When ectopically expressed in PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP cells, miR-101 inhibits endogenous Ezh2 expression in all three cell lines, while miR-26a only decreases Ezh2 in DU145. Ectopic miR-101 reduces the invasion ability of PC-3 cells, while restored Ezh2 expression rescues the invasiveness of PC-3 cells. Similarly, miR-101 also inhibits cell invasion and migration of DU145 and LNCaP cells, respectively. Interestingly, ectopic miR-101 exhibits differential effects on the proliferation of PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP cells and also causes morphological changes of LNCaP cells. In addition, the expression of miR-101 is regulated by androgen receptor and HIF-1alpha/HIF-1beta. While HIF-1alpha/HIF-1beta induced by deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) decreases miR-101 levels, the overall effects of R-1881 on miR-101 expression are stimulatory.  Conclusions:   This study indicates that miR-101 targets Ezh2 and decreases the invasiveness of PCa cells, suggesting that miR-101 introduction is a potential therapeutic strategy to combat PCa. MiR-101 differentially regulates prostate cell proliferation. Meanwhile, the expression of miR-101 is also modulated at different physiological conditions, such as androgen stimulation and HIF-1alpha/HIF-1beta induction.""","""['Paul Cao', 'Zhiyong Deng', 'Meimei Wan', 'Weiwei Huang', 'Scott D Cramer', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Ming Lei', 'Guangchao Sui']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Androgens suppress EZH2 expression via retinoblastoma (RB) and p130-dependent pathways: a potential mechanism of androgen-refractory progression of prostate cancer.', 'Myc enforces overexpression of EZH2 in early prostatic neoplasia via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in human breast and prostate cancer.', 'Factors interacting with HIF-1alpha mRNA: novel therapeutic targets.', 'Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition: An underappreciated mediator of diabetic complications.', 'Dual targeting of EZH1 and EZH2 for the treatment of malignant rhabdoid tumors.', 'MicroRNAs: master regulators in host-parasitic protist interactions.', 'A histidine cluster determines YY1-compartmentalized coactivators and chromatin elements in phase-separated enhancer clusters.', 'Epi-miRNAs: Regulators of the Histone Modification Machinery in Human Cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   We examined a single-surgeon series of 69 patients who had been treated with PB from 2002 to 2005. All patients had a follow-up of ≥ 1 year; prospectively, and patients had baseline, 6- and 12-month assessments using the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-6 scores. The 69 patients were divided into early treatment with PDE-5i (31) and not treated with PDE-5i (38), and their SHIM and IIEF-6 scores were compared at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Daily sildenafil (25-50 mg) was given immediately after PB for 12 months. Overall, for the entire group, the mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 6.8 ng/mL; 78% had Gleason 6 cancer and 20% had Gleason 7 (3 + 4) cancer. The mean age in the early PDE-5i group was 64.8 years, and was 66.0 years in the no-PDE-5i group. The mean radiation dose in the early PDE-5i group was 50.2 Gy, and 43.9 Gy in the other group (P= 0.08).  Results:   In the no-PDE-5i group, the mean baseline SHIM score of 17.1 decreased rapidly to 9.1 at 6 months (P= 0.01) and stayed at 9.3 at 12 months (P= 0.01). In the early PDE-5i group, the mean baseline SHIM score of 21.8 decreased slightly to 17.6 at 6 months (P= 0.2), and was maintained at 17.9 at 12 months (P= 0.2).

The efficacy for predicting death from prostate cancer was assessed with concordance indices and by using net reclassification improvement (NRI), which indicated the net increase in sensitivity and specificity when adding a biomarker to a base Cox proportional hazards model. The PSAV techniques were compared for the 5-10 years before the clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer. The most effective technique was then applied at the transition point when each man's PSA history curve transformed from linear to exponentially increasing, and its predictive value was compared to that of concurrent PSA level.  Results:   A PSA transition point was found in 522 (82%) of the 634 men, including all 11 who died from prostate cancer. At the transition point, the mean PSA level was 1.4 ng/mL, and PSAV but not PSA level was significantly higher among men who died from prostate cancer than among men who did not (P = 0.021 vs P = 0.112; Wilcoxon two-sample test). At the transition point, adding PSAV to a base model consisting of age and date of diagnosis improved the concordance index by 0.05, and significantly improved the overall sensitivity and specificity (NRI, P = 0.028), while adding PSA level to the same base model resulted in little improvement (concordance index increase < 0.01 and NRI P = 0.275).

Patients and methods:   We genotyped men with localized/regional prostate cancer for 26 loci across eight genes that are central to cellular antioxidant defence: glutathione peroxidase (GPX1, GPX4), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B), SOD1, SOD2, and SOD3, and 'X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cell 1' (XRCC1).

Circulating MMP-7 serum concentration was significantly elevated in patients with distant metastasis (p < 0.001). For the detection of distant prostate cancer metastasis, using a cut-off value of 3.7 ng/ml, a specificity of 69% and a sensitivity of 92% were observed. Multivariate analysis identified high MMP-7 serum concentration as an independent risk factor for prostate cancer-related death both in a preoperative and a postoperative model (p = 0.003 and 0.018, respectively). Furthermore, the evaluation of predictive models revealed that addition of serum MMP-7 levels to the preoperatively available predictors improves prognostic accuracy (the concordance index increased from 0.631 to 0.734 when MMP-7 was included).

Numerous studies have demonstrated increased activation of EGFR and its family members (EGFRs), IGF-1R as well as c-Src in colorectal cancer. The current study was undertaken to examine the effectiveness of combination therapy of dasatinib (BMS-354825; Bristol-Myers Squibb), a highly specific inhibitor of Src family kinases (SFK) and a nontoxic dietary agent; curcumin (diferuloylmethane), in colorectal cancer in in vitro and in vivo experimental models. For the latter, we utilized C57BL/6 APC(Min+/-) mice. Initial in vitro studies revealed synergistic interactions between the two agents. Additionally, we have observed that combination treatment causes a much greater inhibition of the following metastatic processes than either agent alone: (i) colony formation, (ii) invasion through extracellular matrix and (iii) tubule formation by endothelial cells. Dasatinib affects the cell adhesion phenotype of colon cancer HCT-116 cells whereas the combination therapy enhances this effect to a greater extent. Preclinical investigation revealed that the combination therapy to be highly effective causing an over 95% regression of intestinal adenomas in Apc(Min+/-) mice, which could be attributed to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis.

Most of the selected miRNAs were significantly correlated with adverse risk factors when different clinicopathological variables were analyzed. Circulating miRNA-375 and miRNA-141 turned out to be the most pronounced markers for high-risk tumors.

Overall, men with diabetes had a significantly lower risk of cancer (RR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.93-0.94). Men with diabetes, however, had increased risks of cancers of the liver (RR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.82-2.09), pancreas (RR = 1.50, 95%CI = 1.42-1.59), biliary tract (RR = 1.41, 95%CI = 1.22-1.62), colon (RR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.16-1.25), rectum (RR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.07-1.18), and kidney (RR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.03-1.16), as well as leukemia (RR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.08-1.21) and melanoma (RR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.03-1.24). In contrast, men with diabetes had decreased risks of cancers of the prostate (RR = 0.89, 95%CI = 0.87-0.91), brain (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.82-0.99), buccal cavity (RR = 0.85, 95%CI = 0.82-0.89), lung (RR = 0.79, 95%CI = 0.77-0.80), esophagus (RR = 0.77, 95%CI = 0.72-0.82), and larynx (RR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.71-0.80). These findings indicate that black and white men with diabetes are at significantly lower risk of total cancer and of two of the most common cancers among U.S. males; lung and prostate cancers. These decreased risks were offset, however, by increased risks of cancer at several sites. Hyperinsulinemia may explain the increased risks of the digestive cancers, while lower testosterone levels, in the case of prostate cancer, and higher BMI, in the case of lung cancer, may explain the decreased risks of those tumors.""","""['Elizabeth A Atchison', 'Gloria Gridley', 'J Daniel Carreon', 'Michael F Leitzmann', 'Katherine A McGlynn']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Obesity and cancer risk among white and black United States veterans.', 'Risk of malignant disease among 1525 adult male US Veterans with Gaucher disease.', 'Second cancers among 40,576 testicular cancer patients: focus on long-term survivors.', 'Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.', 'Metastatic tumors to the oral and maxillofacial region: a retrospective study of 19 cases in West China and review of the Chinese and English literature.', 'High Versus Low Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet for Prevention of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Association of type 2 diabetes mellitus with lung cancer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.', 'Older veterans associated with reduced risk of cancer: Retrospective nationwide matched cohort study in Taiwan.', 'Different types of diabetes mellitus and risk of thyroid cancer: A meta-analysis of cohort studies.', 'Development and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with diabetes.']"""

This intraneural involvement is not widely known and is thought to be from direct perineural spread. We hypothesized that high-resolution imaging could provide supportive evidence for this mechanism.  Methods:   The clinical data and imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography, PET/CT) of patients evaluated at our institution between 2004 and 2009 for lumbosacral plexopathy due to intraneural prostate carcinoma were retrospectively reviewed.  Results:   Four patients presenting with painful lumbosacral plexopathy were found to have intraneural lumbosacral prostate adenocarcinoma. Two patients had involvement of the lumbosacral plexus ipsilateral to the lobe of the prostate most involved with adenocarcinoma at prostatectomy. High-resolution MRI and PET/CT studies revealed similar findings: abnormal soft tissue signal was followed from the prostate (n = 1) or prostatic bed (n = 3) area along the expected course of the pelvic plexus to the level of the sciatic notch, where it involved the sacral spinal nerves and sciatic nerve. Imaging findings were consistent with neoplastic infiltration, which was confirmed at biopsy in three patients.  Conclusions:   The potential for prostate adenocarcinoma to spread to the lumbosacral plexus has, to our knowledge, not been readily appreciated. Because the imaging findings are often subtle, we believe that intraneural lumbosacral plexus involvement may not be uncommon. This study, with the use of high-resolution MRI and PET/CT studies, supports the direct perineural spread of prostate adenocarcinoma via the pelvic plexus to the lumbosacral plexus.

The recently discovered recurrent ERG rearrangement in prostate cancer might represent a prostate cancer-specific alteration that has not been systematically assessed in tumors other than prostate cancer. Aim of this study was to assess, whether the ERG rearrangement and the distinct deletion site between TMPRSS2 and ERG, both predominantly resulting in a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, occur in tumors other than prostate cancer. We assessed 54 different tumor types (2942 samples in total) for their ERG rearrangement status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To calibrate, we analyzed 285 prostate cancer samples for the ERG rearrangement frequency. Additionally, we interrogated a high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data set across 3131 cancer specimens (26 tumor types) for copy number alterations. None of the 54 different tumor types assessed by FISH harbored an ERG rearrangement, whereas the prostate cancer samples revealed an ERG rearrangement in 49.5% of cases. Furthermore, within the 26 tumor types assessed for copy number alterations by SNP, the distinct deletion site between TMPRSS2 and ERG (21q22.2-3) was detectable exclusively in prostate cancer. Although Ewing's sarcoma and AML have known rearrangements rarely involving ERG, we hypothesize that the ERG rearrangement as well as the distinct deletion site on 21q22.2-3 between TMPRSS2 and ERG are prostate-cancer-specific genomic alterations. These observations provide further insight into the oncogenesis of prostate cancer and might be critical for the development of ERG rearrangement assessment as a clinical tool.""","""['Veit J Scheble', 'Martin Braun', 'Rameen Beroukhim', 'Craig H Mermel', 'Christian Ruiz', 'Theresia Wilbertz', 'Ann-Cathrin Stiedl', 'Karen Petersen', 'Markus Reischl', 'Rainer Kuefer', 'David Schilling', 'Falko Fend', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Matthew Meyerson', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Lukas Bubendorf', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Prevalence of TMPRSS2-ERG and SLC45A3-ERG gene fusions in a large prostatectomy cohort.', 'ERG rearrangement is present in a subset of transition zone prostatic tumors.', 'A novel four-color fluorescence in situ hybridization assay for the detection of TMPRSS2 and ERG rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'ERG protein expression as a biomarker of prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'TRIM21 Expression as a Prognostic Biomarker for Progression-Free Survival in HNSCC.', 'Evaluation of automatic discrimination between benign and malignant prostate tissue in the era of high precision digital pathology.', 'Diagnostic utility of immunohistochemical markers alpha methyl acyl coA racemase (AMACR) and Ets related gene (ERG) in prostate cancer.', 'Structural variations in cancer and the 3D genome.', 'TRIM24 Expression as an Independent Biomarker for Prognosis and Tumor Recurrence in HNSCC.']"""

Both benign and cancer tissues displayed characteristic histology and expression of cell-type specific markers for up to 3 months. Moreover, androgen-regulated protein expression diminished in TSGs after androgen ablation of the host and was restored after androgen repletion. Finally, many normal secretory epithelial cells and cancer cells in TSGs remained viable 2 months after androgen ablation, consistent with similar observations in postprostatectomy specimens following neoadjuvant androgen ablation.

ADT consisted of neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant ADT or combinations of these regimens. The primary endpoint was time to biochemical failure (nadir plus 2 ng/ml), assessed from the end of therapy. Factors predictive for the need for ADT were examined with interaction analyses.  Results:   The impact of increasing ADT duration was nonlinear with, on average, 6 months of adjuvant ADT resulting in a reduction of the risk of biochemical failure by 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-46%), while 12, 24, and 36 months of ADT resulted in a 58% (95% CI, 47%-67%), 66% (95% CI, 55%-75%), and 66% (95% CI, 51%-77%) relative failure reduction, respectively.

Conclusions:   The known ADT efficacy derived from randomized studies can be generalized to patients with different features, and individual predictions of potential benefit from ADT use and duration may be calculated to aid patient and physician decision making.

Methods and materials:   Fourteen patients who underwent definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer formed the basis of this study.

Intratreatment organ motion was monitored continuously by the Calypso® System for quantification of intrafraction setup error.  Results:   As expected, setup error (that is, inter- plus intrafraction motion, unless otherwise stated) was largest with skin mark alignment, requiring margins of 7.5 mm, 11.4 mm, and 16.3 mm, in the lateral (LR), longitudinal (SI), and vertical (AP) directions, respectively.

Larger differences are observed for modifications of the margins between the CTV and the PTV because these have direct impact onto the dose level and dose heterogeneity in the healthy tissues surrounding the CTV. Interpatient anatomic variations also have to be taken into consideration for studies of the risk for cancer induction from radiotherapy.  Conclusions:   The results have shown the complex interplay between the risk for secondary malignancies, the details of the treatment delivery, and the patient heterogeneity that may influence comparisons between the long-term effects of various treatment techniques. Nevertheless, absolute risk levels seem very small and comparable to mortality risks from surgical interventions, thus supporting the robustness of radiation therapy as a successful treatment modality for prostate carcinomas.""","""['Alexandru Daşu', 'Iuliana Toma-Daşu', 'Lars Franzén', 'Anders Widmark', 'Per Nilsson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Modelling of organ-specific radiation-induced secondary cancer risks following particle therapy.', 'Dosimetric impact and theoretical clinical benefits of fiducial markers for dose escalated prostate cancer radiation treatment.', 'The comparison of radiotherapy techniques for treatment of the prostate cancer: the three-field vs. the four-field.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Second malignancies after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Secondary cancer risk from modern external-beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer patients: Impact of fractionation and dose distribution.', 'Cancer risk assessment in modern radiotherapy workflow with medical big data.', 'Second primary cancers after radiation for prostate cancer: a review of data from planning studies.', 'Impact of margin size on the predicted risk of radiogenic second cancers following proton arc therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Since 2004, we have conducted a program of prostate cancer screening using mobile units across 231 municipalities from 6 Brazilian states.  Results:   A total of 17 571 men were evaluated by clinical history, digital rectal examination (DRE), and serum free and total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The recommendations for biopsy were a PSA level of ≥ 4.0 ng/mL, DRE findings suspicious for cancer, or a PSA level of 2.5-4.0 ng/mL with a percent-free PSA level < 15%. The biopsy protocol included 12 biopsy cores from the peripheral zone, 2 from the transition zone, and additional sampling of suspicious areas. The cumulative cancer detection rate was 3.7%. The main indication for biopsy was a PSA level of ≥ 4.0 ng/mL (51.2%), with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 44.1%. Another 19.7% of biopsied men had suspicious DRE findings with a normal PSA level (PPV 23.5%). A percent-free PSA level of < 15% in men with a PSA level of 2.5-4.0 ng/mL and normal DRE findings yielded a PPV of 31.1%. The PPV was greater (70.9%) for the 7.1% of men with both suspicious DRE findings and a PSA level of ≥ 4.0 ng/mL. Most cancers were Stage T1-T2 (93.4%), and the percentage of Gleason score of ≥ 7 was 32.5%. The proportion of insignificant cancers according to Epstein's criteria was 13.5%.

Objectives:   The purpose of this study was to assess use trends for ADT overall and by type (orchiectomy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists) and the factors associated with time to receipt for metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry and Medicare claims database were obtained for 5,273 men, aged 65 years and older and diagnosed with Stage IV prostate cancer during 1991-1999 from seven SEER regions.

Results:   African-American men were less likely than white men to receive any ADT after diagnosis (P<0.001). Differences were noted in the time to receipt of ADT, with African-American men having a longer mean time to receipt of orchiectomy (time ratio [TR]=1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.03, 2.17) or LHRH agonist (TR=1.42; 95% CI=1.06, 1.89) than white men.

This study aimed to quantify and explain trends in incidence, stage distribution, survival and mortality in the Netherlands between 1989 and 2006.  Methods:   Population-based data from the nationwide Netherlands Cancer Registry and Causes of Death Registry were used. Annual incidence and mortality rates were calculated and age-adjusted to the European Standard Population. Trends in rates were evaluated by age, clinical stage and differentiation grade.  Results:   120,965 men were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1989 and 2006. Age-adjusted incidence rates increased from 63 to 104 per 100,000 person-years in this period. Two periods of increasing incidence rates could be distinguished with increases predominantly in cT2-tumours between 1989 and 1995 and predominantly in cT1c-tumours since 2001. cT4/N+/M+-tumour incidence rates decreased from 23 in 1993 to 18 in 2006. The trend towards earlier detection was accompanied by a lower mean age at diagnosis (from 74 in 1989 to 70 in 2006), increased frequency of treatment with curative intent and improved 5-year relative survival. Mortality rates decreased from 34 in 1996 to 26 in 2007.  Conclusions:   The increase of prostate cancer incidence in the early 1990s was probably caused by increased prostate cancer awareness combined with diagnostic improvements (transrectal ultrasound, (thin) needle biopsies), but not PSA testing. The subsequent peak since 2001 is probably attributable to PSA testing. The decline in prostate cancer mortality from 1996 onwards may be the consequence of increased detection of cT2-tumours between 1989 and 1995.

Purpose:   To determine if quantitative, model-based MR-perfusion (MRP) with gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) discriminates between prostate cancer, benign tissue, and transitional zone (TZ) tissue.  Material and methods:   27 patients (age, 65±4 years; PSA 11.0±6.1 ng/ml) with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer underwent standard MRI, 3D MR-spectroscopy (MRS), and MRP with Gd-BOPTA. Based on results of combined MRI/MRS and subsequent guided prostate biopsy alone (17/27), biopsy and radical prostatectomy (9/27), or sufficient negative follow-up (7/27), maps of model-free, deconvolution-based mean transit time (dMTT) were generated for 29 benign regions (bROIs), 14 cancer regions (cROIs), and 18 regions of transitional zone (tzROIs). Applying a 2-compartment exchange model, quantitative perfusion analysis was performed including as parameters: plasma flow (PF), plasma volume (PV), plasma mean transit time (PMTT), extraction flow (EFL), extraction fraction (EFR), interstitial volume (IV) and interstitial mean transit time (IMTT). Two-sided T-tests (significance level p<0.05) discriminated bROIs vs. cROIs and cROIs vs. tzROIs, respectively.  Results:   PMTT discriminated best between bROIs (11.8±3.0 s) and cROIs (24.3±9.6 s) (p<0.0001), while PF, PV, PS, EFR, IV, IMTT also differed significantly (p 0.00002-0.0136). Discrimination between cROIs and tzROIs was insignificant for all parameters except PV (14.3±2.5 ml vs. 17.6±2.6 ml, p<0.05).

The results of the immunoreactivity of p22 phox in the stroma and gland of the prostate showed an increase in prostate cancer (8.45+/-3.6 and 25.08+/-7.5% p<0.0001, respectively) in comparison with the results for prostatic hyperplasia (4.8+/-2.8 and 6.7+/-3.1% p<0.0001, respectively).

Such neoplasms include xanthomatous (foamy) carcinoma and pseudohyperplastic carcinoma. We recently studied five carcinomas showing a cytoarchitectural combination of both neoplasms which were confused with benign glandular proliferations.  Methods:   Five cases (1.8%) of pseudohyperplastic carcinoma showing xanthomatous changes were selected from a total of 280 biopsies showing prostate carcinoma. Glandular prostatic hyperplasia was originally diagnosed in four of such cases.  Results:   Patient age ranged from 54 and 78 years (mean, 64 years). All patients had high prostate-specific antigen levels, and digital rectal examination showed abnormalities in four of them. Neoplasms showed minimal atypia and consisted of mid- to large-sized glands arranged in nests resembling hyperplastic nodules. Glands showed papillary projections, infoldings, and undulations. Most nuclei were basal, small and hyperchromatic, and nucleomegaly was only seen in two biopsies in isolated histological fields. Several useful criteria for diagnosis of acinar carcinoma, such as perineural infiltration, mitosis, crystalloids, blue secretions, and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm, were absent.

To further explore the mode of action of tasquinimod, in vitro and in vivo experiments with gene microarray analysis were performed using LNCaP prostate tumor cells. The array data were validated by real-time semiquantitative reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (sqRT-PCR) and protein expression techniques.  Results:   One of the most significant differentially expressed genes both in vitro and in vivo after exposure to tasquinimod, was thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). The up-regulation of TSP1 mRNA in LNCaP tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo correlated with an increased expression and extra cellular secretion of TSP1 protein. When nude mice bearing CWR-22RH human prostate tumors were treated with oral tasquinimod, there was a profound growth inhibition, associated with an up-regulation of TSP1 and a down- regulation of HIF-1 alpha protein, androgen receptor protein (AR) and glucose transporter-1 protein within the tumor tissue. Changes in TSP1 expression were paralleled by an anti-angiogenic response, as documented by decreased or unchanged tumor tissue levels of VEGF (a HIF-1 alpha down stream target) in the tumors from tasquinimod treated mice.  Conclusions:   We conclude that tasquinimod-induced up-regulation of TSP1 is part of a mechanism involving down-regulation of HIF1alpha and VEGF, which in turn leads to reduced angiogenesis via inhibition of the ""angiogenic switch"", that could explain tasquinimods therapeutic potential.""","""['Anders Olsson', 'Anders Björk', 'Johan Vallon-Christersson', 'John T Isaacs', 'Tomas Leanderson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Inhibition of metastasis in a castration resistant prostate cancer model by the quinoline-3-carboxamide tasquinimod (ABR-215050).', 'The quinoline-3-carboxamide anti-angiogenic agent, tasquinimod, enhances the anti-prostate cancer efficacy of androgen ablation and taxotere without effecting serum PSA directly in human xenografts.', 'The anti-tumor effect of the quinoline-3-carboxamide tasquinimod: blockade of recruitment of CD11b(+) Ly6C(hi) cells to tumor tissue reduces tumor growth.', 'Mechanisms of action of tasquinimod on the tumour microenvironment.', 'A review of tasquinimod in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'The potential anti-cancer effects of quercetin on blood, prostate and lung cancers: An update.', 'Tasquinimod suppresses tumor cell growth and bone resorption by targeting immunosuppressive myeloid cells and inhibiting c-MYC expression in multiple myeloma.', 'HDAC4 Is Indispensable for Reduced Slow Myosin Expression at the Early Stage of Hindlimb Unloading in Rat Soleus Muscle.', 'Tasquinimod efficacy and S100A9 expression in glucose-treated HREC cells.', 'Laquinimod, a prototypic quinoline-3-carboxamide and aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, utilizes a CD155-mediated natural killer/dendritic cell interaction to suppress CNS autoimmunity.']"""

The efficacy of cisplatin therapy is often limited by the emergence of resistant tumours following treatment. Cisplatin resistance is multi-factorial but can be associated with increased DNA repair capacity, mutations in p53 or loss of DNA mismatch repair capacity.  Methods:   RNA interference (RNAi) was used to reduce the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) capacity of several prostate and colorectal carcinoma cell lines with specific defects in p53 and/or DNA mismatch repair. The effect of small inhibitory RNAs designed to target the CSB (Cockayne syndrome group B) transcript on TC-NER and the sensitivity of cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis was determined.  Results:   These prostate and colon cancer cell lines were initially TC-NER proficient and RNAi against CSB significantly reduced their DNA repair capacity. Decreased TC-NER capacity was associated with an increase in the sensitivity of tumour cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, even in p53 null and DNA mismatch repair-deficient cell lines.  Conclusion:   The present work indicates that CSB and TC-NER play a prominent role in determining the sensitivity of tumour cells to cisplatin even in the absence of p53 and DNA mismatch repair. These results further suggest that CSB represents a potential target for cancer therapy that may be important to overcome resistance to cisplatin in the clinic.""","""['Lawton J Stubbert', 'Jennifer M Smith', 'Bruce C McKay']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['CSB affected on the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to platinum-based drugs through the global decrease of let-7 and miR-29.', 'The C-terminal Region and SUMOylation of Cockayne Syndrome Group B Protein Play Critical Roles in Transcription-coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair.', 'RNA interference against transcription elongation factor SII does not support its role in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair.', 'Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein: at the crossroads of transcriptional networks.', 'The role of Cockayne syndrome group A (CSA) protein in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair.', 'CUL4A silencing attenuates cervical carcinogenesis and improves Cisplatin sensitivity.', 'The Role of Extracellular Vesicles in Mediating Resistance to Anticancer Therapies.', 'Cockayne Syndrome Group B (CSB): The Regulatory Framework Governing the Multifunctional Protein and Its Plausible Role in Cancer.', 'Adipose most abundant 2 protein is a predictive marker for cisplatin sensitivity in cancers.', 'Role of Nucleotide Excision Repair in Cisplatin Resistance.']"""

We present the accuracy and feasibility of the RBIE technique for detecting prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   The results of a pathologic analysis of 55 prostatectomy specimens were compared with elastographic moving images obtained at the time of biopsy of the prostate.  Results:   The RBIE technique generated stable and repeatable elastographic moving images. The percentage of images affected by artifact due to slippage in the compression plane was reduced to 1% using the RBIE method compared with 32% using the manual compression method. With regard to tumor location, elastographic moving images obtained using the RBIE technique were in complete agreement with clinicopathologic evaluation of tumor location in eight cases (15%), showed partial agreement in 43 cases (78%), and disagreed in four cases (7%). In three different regions of the prostate, 84% of anterior tumors, 85% of middle tumors, and 60% of posterior tumors were detected.

Design:   Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data.  Setting:   368 general practices in England and Wales supplying data to the QResearch database.  Participants:   2 004 692 patients aged 30-84 years of whom 225 922 (10.7%) were new users of statins: 159 790 (70.7%) were prescribed simvastatin, 50 328 (22.3%) atorvastatin, 8103 (3.6%) pravastatin, 4497 (1.9%) rosuvastatin, and 3204 (1.4%) fluvastatin.  Methods:   Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate effects of statin type, dose, and duration of use. The number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated and numbers of additional or fewer cases estimated for 10 000 treated patients.  Main outcome measure:   First recorded occurrence of cardiovascular disease, moderate or serious myopathic events, moderate or serious liver dysfunction, acute renal failure, venous thromboembolism, Parkinson's disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cataract, osteoporotic fracture, gastric cancer, oesophageal cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer.  Results:   Individual statins were not significantly associated with risk of Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, venous thromboembolism, dementia, osteoporotic fracture, gastric cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. Statin use was associated with decreased risks of oesophageal cancer but increased risks of moderate or serious liver dysfunction, acute renal failure, moderate or serious myopathy, and cataract. Adverse effects were similar across statin types for each outcome except liver dysfunction where risks were highest for fluvastatin. A dose-response effect was apparent for acute renal failure and liver dysfunction. All increased risks persisted during treatment and were highest in the first year. After stopping treatment the risk of cataract returned to normal within a year in men and women. Risk of oesophageal cancer returned to normal within a year in women and within 1-3 years in men. Risk of acute renal failure returned to normal within 1-3 years in men and women, and liver dysfunction within 1-3 years in women and from three years in men. Based on the 20% threshold for cardiovascular risk, for women the NNT with any statin to prevent one case of cardiovascular disease over five years was 37 (95% confidence interval 27 to 64) and for oesophageal cancer was 1266 (850 to 3460) and for men the respective values were 33 (24 to 57) and 1082 (711 to 2807). In women the NNH for an additional case of acute renal failure over five years was 434 (284 to 783), of moderate or severe myopathy was 259 (186 to 375), of moderate or severe liver dysfunction was 136 (109 to 175), and of cataract was 33 (28 to 38). Overall, the NNHs and NNTs for men were similar to those for women, except for myopathy where the NNH was 91 (74 to 112).  Conclusions:   Claims of unintended benefits of statins, except for oesophageal cancer, remain unsubstantiated, although potential adverse effects at population level were confirmed and quantified.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of margin size on tumor control and side effects for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) treatment plans with increased dose. Eighteen patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled. 3DCRT and IMRT plans were compared for a variety of margin sizes. A marker detectable on daily portal images was presupposed for narrow margins. Prescribed dose was 82 Gy within 41 fractions to the prostate clinical target volume (CTV). Tumor control probability (TCP) calculations based on the Poisson model including the linear quadratic approach were performed. Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was calculated for bladder, rectum and femoral heads according to the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman method. All plan types presented essentially identical TCP values and very low NTCP for bladder and femoral heads. Mean doses for these critical structures reached a minimum for IMRT with reduced margins. Two endpoints for rectal complications were analyzed. A marked decrease in NTCP for IMRT plans with narrow margins was seen for mild RTOG grade 2/3 as well as for proctitis/necrosis/stenosis/fistula, for which NTCP <7% was obtained. For equivalent TCP values, sparing of normal tissue was demonstrated with the narrow margin approach.

However, to our knowledge no anatomically correct models are available to test imaging and ablation techniques. Animal models present ethical, anatomical and cost challenges. We designed and validated an inexpensive but anatomically correct prostate phantom incorporating tumor, rectum and urethra that can be used for simulated and experimental magnetic resonance guided focal intervention. Our secondary aim was to asses the phantom using other imaging modalities.  Materials and methods:   The phantom, which was constructed of ballistic gel, includes an 80 gm prostate with urethra, tumor, perineum and rectum. Gadolinium was added to make the gel visible to magnetic resonance imaging. To recreate a tumor an irregularly shaped 5 cc volume of coagulable gel was inserted into the prostate phantom. The phantom was evaluated using magnetic resonance, computerized tomography and transrectal ultrasound. Thermal ablation was delivered via interstitial placement of laser fibers. Magnetic resonance thermometry was done to record real-time tissue temperatures during thermal ablation.  Results:   With all modalities tested the phantom emulated human prostate anatomy. The coagulable gel tumor allowed us to generate focal thermal lesions. The phantom had magnetic resonance imaging properties comparable to in vivo properties, allowing ablative zones to be accurately assessed and magnetic resonance thermometry to be done.  Conclusions:   The phantom is a useful tool to test different aspects of thermal focal ablation for prostate cancer using multiple imaging modalities, particularly magnetic resonance. It is inexpensive and easily constructed, and may be considered a valuable model to train on and teach focal therapy.""","""['Uri Lindner', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Robert A Weersink', 'Orit Raz', 'Eugen Hlasny', 'Marshall S Sussman', 'Sean R Davidson', 'Mark R Gertner', 'John Trachtenberg']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['3D conformal MRI-controlled transurethral ultrasound prostate therapy: validation of numerical simulations and demonstration in tissue-mimicking gel phantoms.', 'Evaluating localized prostate cancer and identifying candidates for focal therapy.', 'Transperineal radiofrequency interstitial tumor ablation of the prostate: correlation of magnetic resonance imaging with histopathologic examination.', 'Magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity ultrasound ablation of the prostate.', 'Focal therapy for localized prostate cancer: a critical appraisal of rationale and modalities.', 'Focal laser ablation of prostate cancer: definition, needs, and future.', 'Preclinical multimodality phantom design for quality assurance of tumor size measurement.']"""

However, chronic licorice consumption can lead to serious side effects due to the presence of considerable quantities of glycyrrhizin, which causes severe hypokalaemia and hypertension. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a hexane-ethanol extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis (HEGU), which lacks glycyrrhizin, on the metastatic characteristics of DU145 prostate cancer cells. HEGU inhibited basal and epidermal growth factor-induced cell migration, invasion and adhesion in a dose-dependent fashion. HEGU significantly suppressed the secretion and activation of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. The secretion of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 was reduced, but that of TIMP-2 was increased in HEGU-treated cells. HEGU reduced the protein levels of integrin-α2, the intercellular adhesion molecule, and the vascular cell adhesion molecule. An active fraction of HEGU was separated via column chromatography, and the structure of the active component, licoricidin, was identified via 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The treatment of DU145 cells with licoricidin induced a reduction in cell migration and the secretion of MMP-9, TIMP-1, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and vascular endothelial growth factor, as well as in the expression of adhesion molecules. These results indicate that HEGU, which contains licoricidin, is a potent anti-metastatic agent, which can markedly inhibit the metastatic and invasive capacity of malignant prostate cancer cells. The observed reductions in the activation of proteases and the levels of adhesion molecules may constitute a component of the mechanisms by which HEGU inhibits the migration and adhesion of prostate cancer cells.""","""['So Young Park', 'Soon Sung Lim', 'Jin Kyu Kim', 'Il-Jun Kang', 'Jong-Sang Kim', 'Choonghwan Lee', 'Jongdai Kim', 'Jung Han Yoon Park']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Br J Nutr""","""['Licoricidin, an Active Compound in the Hexane/Ethanol Extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Inhibits Lung Metastasis of 4T1 Murine Mammary Carcinoma Cells.', 'Isoangustone A present in hexane/ethanol extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis induces apoptosis in DU145 human prostate cancer cells via the activation of DR4 and intrinsic apoptosis pathway.', 'Hexane/ethanol extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis and its active compound isoangustone A induce G1 cycle arrest in DU145 human prostate and 4T1 murine mammary cancer cells.', 'Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) in cancer treatment.', 'Anti-metastatic potential of resveratrol and its metabolites by the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion of malignant cancer cells.', 'Licoricidin combats gastric cancer by targeting the ICMT/Ras pathway in vitro and in vivo.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 drug discovery through molecular docking.', 'Phytochemicals in Prostate Cancer: From Bioactive Molecules to Upcoming Therapeutic Agents.', 'Comparing The Effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra Root Extract, A Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitor (Celecoxib) and A Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analog (Diphereline) in A Rat Model of Endometriosis.']"""

Aim:   The aim of this study was to develop a novel preoperative risk stratification aimed at assessing the probability of EF recovery after BNSRP.  Main outcome measure:   The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) was used to evaluate EF after BNSRP.  Methods:   This study included 435 patients treated with retropubic BNSRP between 2004 and 2008 at a single Institution. Preoperative data, including age, IIEF, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and body mass index (BMI) were available for all patients. Moreover, all patients were assessed postoperatively every 3 months and were asked to complete the IIEF during each visit. Cox regression models tested the association between preoperative predictors (age at surgery, preoperative IIEF-EF domain score, CCI, BMI) and EF recovery. Independent predictors of EF recovery were then used to stratify patients into three groups according to the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED) after surgery: low (age <or= 65 years, IIEF-EF >or= 26, CCI <or= 1; n = 184), intermediate (age 66-69 years or IIEF-EF 11-25,CCI <or= 1; n = 115), and high (age >or= 70 years or IIEF-EF <or= 10 or CCI >or= 2; n = 136). Kaplan-Meier curves assessed the time to EF recovery (defined as IIEF-EF score >or= 22). Predictive accuracy of our proposed classification was quantified using the AUC method.  Results:   Of 435 patients, 242 (55.6%) received phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-I) either on demand or every day for a period of 3-6 months. Overall, EF recovery rate was 58% at 3-year follow-up. Patients treated with PDE5-I had significantly higher 3-year EF recovery rate as compared with patients left untreated after surgery (73 vs. 37%; P < 0.001). Except for BMI (P = 0.7), all preoperative covariates showed a significant association with EF recovery (all P <or= 0.04). The 3-year EF recovery rate significantly differed between the three groups, being 85, 59, and 37% in patients with low, intermediate, and high risk of postoperative ED, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis confirmed a highly significant association between the risk classification and EF recovery (P < 0.001). The proposed patient stratification tool showed a 69.1% accuracy. Similar results were achieved when patients were stratified according to the use of ED treatment after surgery (all P < 0.001).

Objective:   To examine whether a history of asthma or eczema is associated with various cancers among Canadian men in a population based case-control study conducted in the 1980s.  Methods:   Questionnaire-based interviews were performed by a team of trained interviewers from August 1979 to March 1986. Information collected included self-reported history of a prior medical diagnosis of asthma and of eczema, medication use, and several covariates among 3,300 cancer cases and 512 population controls. Logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between asthma or eczema and more than 20 cancer types combined, as well as for each of the 8 most common cancer types (stomach, colon, rectum, lung, prostate, bladder, skin, and lymph nodes).  Results:   Considering study participants who reported a prior medical diagnosis of the disease and medication use, a history of asthma was negatively associated with all cancer types combined (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.5-1.1) and similarly for a history of eczema (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.4-1.1).

In this article, we describe the preclinical development of (86)Y-CHX-A''-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-panitumumab for quantitative PET of HER1-expressing carcinoma. Panitumumab was conjugated to CHX-A''-DTPA and radiolabeled with (86)Y. In vivo biodistribution, PET, blood clearance, area under the curve, area under the moment curve, and mean residence time were determined for mice bearing HER1-expressing human colorectal (LS-174T), prostate (PC-3), and epidermoid (A431) tumor xenografts. Receptor specificity was demonstrated by coinjection of 0.1 mg of panitumumab with the radioimmunoconjugate.  Results:   (86)Y-CHX-A''-DTPA-panitumumab was routinely prepared with a specific activity exceeding 2 GBq/mg. Biodistribution and PET studies demonstrated a high HER1-specific tumor uptake of the radioimmunoconjugate. In mice bearing LS-174T, PC-3, or A431 tumors, the tumor uptake at 3 d was 34.6 +/- 5.9, 22.1 +/- 1.9, and 22.7 +/- 1.7 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g), respectively. The corresponding tumor uptake in mice coinjected with 0.1 mg of panitumumab was 9.3 +/- 1.5, 8.8 +/- 0.9, and 10.0 +/- 1.3 %ID/g, respectively, at the same time point, demonstrating specific blockage of the receptor. Normal organ and tumor uptake quantified by PET was closely related (r(2) = 0.95) to values determined by biodistribution studies. The LS-174T tumor had the highest area under the curve (96.8 +/- 5.6 %ID d g(-1)) and area under the moment curve (262.5 +/- 14.9 %ID d(2) g(-1)); however, the tumor mean residence times were identical for all 3 tumors (2.7-2.8 d).

Prostate cancer (PCa) has a propensity to metastasize to bone, and cadherin-11, which is an osteoblast cadherin aberrantly expressed in PCa cells derived from bone metastases, has been shown to play a role in the metastasis of PCa cells to bone. However, the mechanism by which cadherin-11 is involved in this process is not known. Here, we show that expression of cadherin-11 in cadherin-11-negative C4-2B4 cells increases their spreading and intercalation into an osteoblast layer and also stimulates C4-2B4 cell migration and invasiveness. The downregulation of cadherin-11 in cadherin-11-expressing metastatic PC3 cells decreases cell motility and invasiveness. Further, both the juxtamembrane (JMD) and beta-catenin binding domains (CBS) in the cytoplasmic tail of cadherin-11 are required for cell migration and invasion, but not spreading. Gene array analyses showed that several invasion-related genes, including MMP-7 and MMP-15, are upregulated in cadherin-11-expressing, but not in cad11-DeltaJMD-expressing or cad11-DeltaCBS-expressing, C4-2B4 cells.

Accrual was planned in two stages, with 20 eligible patients in the first stage and 40 overall. Plasma cytokines and growth factors were measured by Luminex.  Results:   Fifty-three eligible subjects had all received prior taxane therapy. Two (3.8%; 95% CI, 0.5-13.0%) had PSA response. None of the 31 patients with measurable disease had a RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) response but 7 (23%) had stable disease.

Although these metastatic lesions are typically osteoblastic, bone resorption is believed to have a prerequisite role in their development. Src kinase has been identified to contribute to prostate cancer tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, Src is also essential in bone metabolism, especially in bone resorption. We hypothesized that inhibiting Src activity with the specific Src family kinase inhibitor saracatinib (AZD0530) would inhibit tumor cell growth and osteoclast differentiation in the tumor-bone interface, thus providing a new approach for advanced prostate cancer. We found that saracatinib inhibited PC-3 cell growth and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of Src, focal adhesion kinase, and P38 kinases was inhibited by saracatinib at the submicromolar range. Saracatinib also inhibited the expression and secretion of invasion-related molecules interlukin-8, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and matrix metalloprotease-9. Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis and signaling were inhibited by saracatinib in both macrophages and PC-3 cells. In in vivo studies, control mice developed more severe osteolytic lesions compared with the treatment group. Immunohistochemical and biochemical assays of bone metabolites confirmed that saracatinib preserved bone architecture in the presence of prostate cancer tumor cells. In summary, we have shown the inhibition of PC3 cell growth and invasion by saracatinib. Src inhibition also blocked the RANKL stimulatory pathway in osteoclasts and PC3 cells. The inhibition of Src thus targets multiple sites involved in prostate cancer bone metastasis, which may offer a therapeutic advantage in treating advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Joy C Yang', 'Lanfang Bai', 'Stanley Yap', 'Allen C Gao', 'Hsing-Jien Kung', 'Christopher P Evans']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['SRC kinase inhibition with saracatinib limits the development of osteolytic bone disease in multiple myeloma.', 'Effects of Src kinase inhibition by saracatinib (AZD0530) on bone turnover in advanced malignancy in a Phase I study.', 'Antitumor activity of saracatinib (AZD0530), a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer.', 'Src as a therapeutic target in men with prostate cancer and bone metastases.', 'Src kinase inhibitors: an emerging therapeutic treatment option for prostate cancer.', 'Small-molecule amines: a big role in the regulation of bone homeostasis.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Natural Product-Based Studies for the Management of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Computational to Clinical Studies.', 'Attenuation of SRC Kinase Activity Augments PARP Inhibitor-mediated Synthetic Lethality in BRCA2-altered Prostate Tumors.', 'Results of a Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2.5 Study of Saracatinib (AZD0530), in Patients with Recurrent Osteosarcoma Localized to the Lung.']"""

In view of these immunomodulatory properties, TLR stimulation may represent a novel means to activate anticancer immune responses. In the present study, the ability of TLR ligands to affect the recruitment of different immune cell populations by human prostate cancer cell lines and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. We showed that LNCaP and DU-145 cells express functionally active TLR3 and TLR5. Treatment with their respective agonists, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid and flagellin, rapidly triggered NF-kappaB-dependent upregulation of different inflammatory molecules, as assayed by microarray and ELISA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that conditioned media from polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid- and flagellin-treated LNCaP and DU-145 cells induced the recruitment of different leukocyte subpopulations, suggesting that TLR stimulation is able to activate the earliest step of immune response mediated by soluble factors. Interestingly, the more aggressive cancer cell line PC3 expressed TLR3 and TLR5 but failed to respond to TLR agonists in terms of NF-kappaB activation and the ability to attract immune effectors. Overall, these data show for the first time that TLR3 and TLR5 stimulation of human prostate cancer cells triggers the production of chemokines, which, in turn, favor the attraction of immune effectors, thereby representing a tool to enhance the efficacy of conventional therapies by stimulating anticancer immune responses.""","""['Roberta Galli', 'Donatella Starace', 'Roberta Busà', 'Daniela F Angelini', 'Alessio Paone', 'Paola De Cesaris', 'Antonio Filippini', 'Claudio Sette', 'Luca Battistini', 'Elio Ziparo', 'Anna Riccioli']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Immunol""","""['TLR-mediated induction of proinflammatory cytokine IL-32 in corneal epithelium.', 'Mobilan: a recombinant adenovirus carrying Toll-like receptor 5 self-activating cassette for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR5, but not TLR4, are required for Helicobacter pylori-induced NF-kappa B activation and chemokine expression by epithelial cells.', 'AsialoGM1 and TLR5 cooperate in flagellin-induced nucleotide signaling to activate Erk1/2.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'A Chemically Defined TLR3 Agonist with Anticancer Activity.', 'Upregulation of TLR5 indicates a favorable prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Emerging RNA-Based Therapeutic and Diagnostic Options: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in Genitourinary Cancers.', 'TLR5 agonists enhance anti-tumor immunity and overcome resistance to immune checkpoint therapy.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.']"""

Material and methods:   The external validations were based on clinical and pathological data of 687 consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localised prostate cancer between 2003 and 2008. Three versions of the Partin tables were compared for their accuracy and performance to predict final pathological stage using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Loess plots analyses.  Results:   Of the whole cohort, 76.2% of men were presented with organ-confined disease (OC), 17.0% had extraprostatic extension (ECE), 6.0% showed seminal vesicle involvement (SVI) and 1.2% had lymph node involvement (LNI). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the Partin Tables 1997, 2001 and 2007 was 0.731, 0.727 and 0.722 for OC; 0.671, 0.662 and 0.650 for ECE; 0.795, 0.788 and 0.779 for SVI as well as 0.826, 0.786 and 0.746 for LNI, respectively.  Conclusion:   All three generations of the Partin tables showed a good accuracy to predict OC, SVI and LNI. However, the predictive accuracy for ECE was only modest.

Some patients are likely to discontinue first-line docetaxel-based chemotherapy because of either completed treatment or the occurrence of manageable side-effects. The aim of this study was to determine whether a rechallenge with docetaxel might be appropriate in patients with CRPC previously treated with docetaxel. Between December 2004 and July 2009, 39 patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer prostate at the Institut Gustave Roussy were administered subsequent docetaxel after front-line docetaxel-based chemotherapy. The medical records of these patients were extracted from the database. The PSA response rate (PSA decline > or =30% and > or =50%), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients receiving docetaxel as a subsequent line of therapy were evaluated using consensus criteria. The effect of pre-treatment variables on efficacy was studied. A PSA decline > or =30% and > or =50% was observed in 64% and 38% of patients, respectively, median PFS was 4.3 months [confidence interval (CI) 95%: 3.6-4.9] and median OS was 15.8 months (CI 95%: 11.7-20.3) in 39 patients who received subsequent docetaxel. The interval between the last cycle of first-line docetaxel and progression [median: 3.0 months; range: 1-30 months] was associated with PFS: median PFS was 3.4 months (CI 95%: 2.6-4.1) and 6.3 months (CI 95%: 3.0-5.6), respectively, in patients with an interval <3.0 months and an interval > or =3.0 months, (p=0.04). Tolerance of re-treatment with docetaxel was acceptable with no toxicity-related death.

Currently there are a number of 5alpha-reductase inhibitor formularies, including Proscar, generic finasteride and dutasteride. While all formularies decrease serum prostate specific antigen (a proxy for prostate volume), they may not accomplish this to the same degree, which may have dramatic effects on prostate specific antigen kinetics in men changing 5alpha-reductase inhibitor formularies. We examined prostate specific antigen velocity after changes in 5alpha-reductase inhibitor formularies.  Materials and methods:   We identified patients treated with 2 or more 5alpha-reductase inhibitor formularies who had sufficient prostate specific antigen values to calculate prostate specific antigen velocity during each 5alpha-reductase inhibitor treatment. Patient data were grouped depending on the formularies received. Statistical analysis was done to compare prostate specific antigen velocity at various time points while on different 5alpha-reductase inhibitors.  Results:   Eight men changed from dutasteride to generic finasteride (group 1), 21 changed from dutasteride to Proscar (group 2), 49 changed from Proscar to dutasteride (group 3) and 77 changed from Proscar to generic finasteride (group 4). We noted a significant increase in prostate specific antigen velocity in groups 1 and 2 (p <0.05), and 4 (p <0.005). The increase was greater than 0.35 ng/ml per year, the common cutoff for prostate biopsy recommendations, in more than a third of patients.  Conclusions:   Results confirm that changing 5alpha-reductase inhibitors drugs can be associated with a clinically significant change in prostate specific antigen velocity.

This information would be useful in determining when to initiate androgen deprivation therapy.  Materials and methods:   From a large radical prostatectomy series we identified 193 hormone naïve men in whom bone metastases developed at a mean of 6 years postoperatively. We examined the prostate specific antigen distribution at bone scan conversion by time from radical prostatectomy to metastasis. ANOVA and linear regression were also used to examine the association of clinicopathological tumor features with prostate specific antigen at bone metastasis.  Results:   Median prostate specific antigen was 31.9 ng/ml at the initial diagnosis of metastatic disease. Bone scan conversion occurred at a prostate specific antigen of less than 10, 10 to 100 and greater than 100 ng/ml in 50 (25.9%), 98 (50.8%) and 45 (23.3%) men, respectively. Lower prostate specific antigen at diagnosis, higher prostatectomy Gleason scores and shorter time to metastasis were associated with lower prostate specific antigen at bone metastasis, whereas prostate specific antigen at metastasis was not significantly associated with other clinicopathological features.  Conclusions:   Prostate specific antigen at the time of bone scan detected metastasis is highly variable. Unlike the pretreatment setting when metastases are rare at a prostate specific antigen of less than 10 ng/ml, 25.9% of bone metastases after radical prostatectomy occurred at a prostate specific antigen of less than 10 ng/ml. Because metastasis may occur at a low prostate specific antigen, patients with biochemical progression managed expectantly need regular bone scans even if prostate specific antigen is low to detect metastasis before symptoms.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Danil V Makarov', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Elizabeth B Humphreys', 'Patrick C Walsh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer and low volume skeletal metastases: results of a feasibility and case-control study.', 'Radionuclide bone scintigraphy in patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: when is it indicated?', 'Are bone scans necessary in men with low prostate specific antigen levels following localized therapy?', 'Capromab Pendetide imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: 9.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 60 patients with PSMs who underwent three-dimensional conformal sEBRT for biochemical recurrence (BCR) or clinically detected local recurrence after RP between 1996 and 2007. PSMs were categorized as present or absent at three locations, and patients were classified as having either one or more than one PSM. BCR after RP was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of ≥ 0.1 ng/mL. BCR after sEBRT was defined as a serum PSA level of ≥ 0.1 ng/mL above the PSA nadir after sEBRT.  Results:   In all, 24 (40%) patients had more than one PSM. Overall, the most common location of a PSM was the posterior prostate with 40 (66%) patients having a positive posterior margin. The location of PSMs was not significantly associated with secondary BCR (global P= 0.8). There was a borderline result between the number of PSMs and BCR: men with more than one PSM were less likely to recur compared with those with only one PSM (hazard ratio 0.42; P= 0.067).  Conclusions:   This is the first study to specifically analyse location and number of PSMs as prognostic factors for men who undergo sEBRT.

It also prevents tumor growth and metastasis in vivo through multiple mechanisms, including induction of apoptosis, angiogenesis inhibition and enhanced immune responses. Using the prostate cancer cell line PPC-1, which is relatively resistant to cell death by doxorubicin (40-50% cytotoxicity), we first report that a combination treatment with cathepsin E can overcome resistance of the cells to this agent. In vitro studies showed that combined treatment of PPC-1 cells with the two agents synergistically induces viability loss, mainly owing to down-regulation of a short form of the FLICE inhibitory protein FLIP. The enhanced antitumor activity was corroborated by in vivo studies with athymic mice bearing PPC-1 xenografts. Intratumoral application of cathepsin E in doxorubicin-treated mice results in tumor cell apoptosis and tumor regression in xenografts by enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis through doxorubicin-induced c-FLIP down-regulation and by a decrease in tumor cell proliferation.

Active TK markedly increases DU145 cell migration and invasion, which are blocked by aprotinin but minimally affected by icatibant; kinin treatment has little effect. TK-induced cell migration and invasion are abolished by inhibition of PAR(1) using a pharmacological inhibitor or RNA interference. The effect of TK on cell migration and invasion are also blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C, c-Src, matrix metalloproteinase, EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, TK stimulates ERK phosphorylation, which is inhibited by an EGFR antagonist. Additionally, TK but not kinin stimulates DU145 cell proliferation through activation of the kinin B2 receptor, but not PAR(1) and EGFR.

The hydrodynamic diameter of the neutral construct varies slightly with aqueous solvent ranging from 15.6 to 19.4 nm. Mass spectrometry and light scattering suggest radically different molecular weights with the former approximately 40 kDa mass consistent with expectation, and the latter 400 kDa mass consistent with a decameric structure and the observed hydrodynamic radii. HPLC can be used to assess purity as well as paclitaxel release, which is insignificant in organic solvents or aqueous solutions at neutral and low pH. Paclitaxel release occurs in vitro in human, rat, and mouse plasma and is nonlinear, ranging from 7 to 20% cumulative release over a 48 h incubation period. The construct is 2-3 orders of magnitude less toxic than Taxol by weight in human hepatocarcinoma (Hep G2), porcine renal proximal tubule (LLC-PK1), and human colon carcinoma (LS174T) cells, but shows similar cytotoxicity to Abraxane in LS174T cells. Both Taxol and the construct appear to induce caspase 3-dependent apoptosis. The construct shows a low level of endotoxin, is not hemolytic and does not induce platelet aggregation in vitro, but does appear to reduce collagen-induced platelet aggregation in vitro. Furthermore, the dendrimer formulation slightly activates the complement system in vitro due most likely to the presence of trace amounts (<1%) of free paclitaxel. An animal study provided insight into the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) wherein 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg of paclitaxel/kg of construct or Abraxane were administered once per week for three consecutive weeks to non tumor bearing athymic nude mice.

Both formulations were found to be nontoxic at the administered doses, and the dendrimer had an acute MTD greater than the highest dose administered.

Herein, we investigated five molecular markers of DNA repair. 513 patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), including 284 patients who received radiotherapy, 229 patients without radiotherapy and 152 healthy individuals were genotyped for five polymorphisms in DNA excision repair genes:ERCC1 N118N (500C>T), XPD K751Q (2282A>C), XRCC1 R194W (685C>T), XRCC1 R399Q (1301G>A) and PARP1 V762A(2446T>C). The distribution of genetic polymorphisms in the patients with CRPC and in healthy controls was compared,and the association between the polymorphisms and overall survival was investigated. The polymorphisms evaluated did not show differences between the patient group and the healthy controls, nor did they show a trend toward an association with survival. However, in the radiation treated subgroup, the median survival time was associated with the XRCC1 haplotype. The median survival time was 11.75 years for patients with the R399Q AA /R194W CC haplotype,12.17 years for patients with the R399Q AG/R194W CC haplotype, 6.665 years for patients with the R399Q AG/R194WCT haplotype, and 6.21 years for patients with the R399Q GG/R194W CT haplotype (p = 0.034).

Many older patients can benefit from intensive cancer therapies, yet evidence suggests that this population is undertreated.  Methods:   To assess preferences and influential factors in geriatric cancer management, practicing U.S. medical oncologists completed a survey containing four detailed vignettes exploring colon, breast, lung, and prostate cancer treatment. Participants were randomly assigned one of two surveys with vignettes that were identical except for patient age (<65 years or >70 years).  Results:   Physicians in each survey group (n = 200) were demographically similar. Intensive therapy was significantly less likely to be recommended for an older than for a younger, but otherwise identical, patient in two of the scenarios. For a woman with metastatic colon cancer (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score, 1) for whom chemotherapy was recommended, nearly all oncologists chose an intensive regimen if the patient's age was 63; but if her age was 85, one fourth of the oncologists chose a less intensive treatment. Likewise, for stage IIA breast cancer (ECOG score, 0), 93% recommended intensive adjuvant treatment for a previously healthy patient aged 63; but only 66% said they would do so if the patient's age was 75. Oncologists commonly identified patient age as an influence on treatment choice, but were even more likely to cite performance status as a determining factor.  Conclusions:   Advanced age can deter oncologists from choosing intensive cancer therapy, even if patients are highly functional and lack comorbidities.

Consistent with this fact, in the present study, we experimentally observe that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced activation profile of MAP kinase signaling is not straightforward dose-dependent in the PC3 prostate cancer cells. To find out what parameters and reactions in the pathway are involved in this departure from the normal dose-dependency, a model-based pathway analysis is performed. The pathway is mathematically modeled with 28 rate equations yielding those many ordinary differential equations (ODE) with kinetic rate constants that have been reported to take random values in the existing literature. This has led to us treating the ODE model of the pathways kinetics as a random differential equations (RDE) system in which the parameters are random variables. We show that our RDE model captures the uncertainty in the kinetic rate constants as seen in the behavior of the experimental data and more importantly, upon simulation, exhibits the abnormal EGF dose-dependency of the activation profile of MAP kinase signaling in PC3 prostate cancer cells. The most likely set of values of the kinetic rate constants obtained from fitting the RDE model into the experimental data is then used in a direct transcription based dynamic optimization method for computing the changes needed in these kinetic rate constant values for the restoration of the normal EGF dose response. The last computation identifies the parameters, i.e., the kinetic rate constants in the RDE model, that are the most sensitive to the change in the EGF dose response behavior in the PC3 prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   Men who had a hot flash score > 4 who were receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer underwent acupuncture with electrostimulation biweekly for 4 weeks, then weekly for 6 weeks, using a predefined treatment plan. The primary endpoint was a 50% reduction in the hot flash score after 4 weeks of therapy, calculated from the patients' daily hot flash diaries. The hot flash-related quality of life and sleep quality and biomarkers potentially related to hot flashes, including serotonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, were examined.  Results:   A total of 25 men were enrolled from September 2003 to April 2007. Of these, 22 were eligible and evaluable.

At diagnostic resolution a digitized HS can contain 80Kx70K pixels - far too many for current automated Gleason grading algorithms to process. However, grading can be separated into two distinct steps: (1) detecting cancerous regions and (2) then grading these regions. The detection step does not require diagnostic resolution and can be performed much more quickly. Thus, we introduce a CaP detection system capable of analyzing an entire digitized whole-mount HS (2x1.75cm(2)) in under three minutes (on a desktop computer) while achieving a CaP detection sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 and 0.90, respectively. We obtain this high-throughput by tailoring the system to analyze the HSs at low resolution (8microm per pixel). This motivates the following algorithm: (Step 1) glands are segmented, (Step 2) the segmented glands are classified as malignant or benign, and (Step 3) the malignant glands are consolidated into continuous regions. The classification of individual glands leverages two features: gland size and the tendency for proximate glands to share the same class. The latter feature describes a spatial dependency which we model using a Markov prior. Typically, Markov priors are expressed as the product of potential functions. Unfortunately, potential functions are mathematical abstractions, and constructing priors through their selection becomes an ad hoc procedure, resulting in simplistic models such as the Potts. Addressing this problem, we introduce PPMMs which formulate priors in terms of probability density functions, allowing the creation of more sophisticated models. To demonstrate the efficacy of our CaP detection system and assess the advantages of using a PPMM prior instead of the Potts, we alternately incorporate both priors into our algorithm and rigorously evaluate system performance, extracting statistics from over 6000 simulations run across 40 RP specimens. Perhaps the most indicative result is as follows: at a CaP sensitivity of 0.87 the accompanying false positive rates of the system when alternately employing the PPMM and Potts priors are 0.10 and 0.20, respectively.""","""['James P Monaco', 'John E Tomaszewski', 'Michael D Feldman', 'Ian Hagemann', 'Mehdi Moradi', 'Parvin Mousavi', 'Alexander Boag', 'Chris Davidson', 'Purang Abolmaesumi', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Markov random field driven region-based active contour model (MaRACel): application to medical image segmentation.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy using statistical image analysis.', 'Separation of benign and malignant glands in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Minimizing nonsubmodular functions with graph cuts - a review.', 'An introduction to hidden Markov models.', 'An update on computational pathology tools for genitourinary pathology practice: A review paper from the Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS).', 'Multistage Segmentation of Prostate Cancer Tissues Using Sample Entropy Texture Analysis.', 'First-Stage Prostate Cancer Identification on Histopathological Images: Hand-Driven versus Automatic Learning.', 'Automatic cancer detection on digital histopathology images of mid-gland radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Histologic tissue components provide major cues for machine learning-based prostate cancer detection and grading on prostatectomy specimens.']"""

In addition, an 8-amino acid Bombesin analogue (BN) peptide substrate, which can target prostate, breast, and colon cancer, was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis and subsequently conjugated with [Gd(TTDA-NP)(H(2)O)](2-) to form BN conjugated Gd-TTDA-NP-BN. The water-exchange rate (k(ex)(298)) for [Gd(TTDA-NP)(H(2)O)](2-) (110×10(6)s(-1)) is significantly higher than that of [Gd(DTPA)(H(2)O)](2-) complex and the rotational correlation time (τ(R)) for [Gd(TTDA-NP)(H(2)O)](2-) (145ps) is also higher than those of [Gd(TTDA)(H(2)O)](2-) (104ps) and [Gd(DTPA)(H(2)O)](2-) (103ps). The Gd-TTDA-NP-BN shows remarkable high relaxivity (7.12mM(-1)s(-1)) comparing to that of [Gd(TTDA-NP)(H(2)O)](2-). The fluorescence studies showed that the Gd-TTDA-NP-BN could efficiently enter PC-3 cells. Additionally, the human cancer cells xenografts using Gd-TTDA-NP-BN-Cy5.5 as an optical imaging probe clearly visualized subcutaneous PC-3 tumor and demonstrated its targeting ability to the gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) receptor overexpression. Furthermore, the biodistribution studies demonstrated significantly high tumor uptake (25.97±1.07% ID/g) and high tumor-to-normal tissue ratios at one hour post-injection of Gd-TTDA-NP-BN-Cy5.5 in the animal model. These results suggest that the Gd-TTDA-NP-BN-Cy5.5 is a superior probe for in vivo optical imaging. Importantly, the MR imaging studies showed notable signal enhancement (44.9±4.2%) on the tumor, indicating a high level accumulation of the contrast agent within the PC-3 tumor sites. Hence, targeting of prostate cancer cells was observed under in vitro and in vivo MR imaging studies using Gd-TTDA-NP-BN contrast agent.

Materials and methods:   A total of 301 patients with Stage T1b-T3 prostate cancer treated to 70 Gy versus 78 Gy now have a median follow-up of 9 years. Failure patterns and survival were compared between dose levels. The cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer versus other causes was examined and regression analysis was used to establish predictive factors.  Results:   Patients with pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >10 ng/mL or high-risk disease had higher biochemical and clinical failures rates when treated to 70 Gy. These patients also had a significantly higher risk of dying of prostate cancer. Patients <70 years old at treatment died of prostate cancer nearly three times more frequently than of other causes when they were radiated to 70 Gy, whereas those treated to 78 Gy died of other causes more frequently. Patients age 70 or older treated to 70 Gy died of prostate cancer as often as other causes, and those receiving 78 Gy never died of prostate cancer within 10 years of follow-up. In regression analysis, factors predicting for death from prostate cancer were pretreatment PSA >10.5 ng/mL, Gleason score 9 and 10, recurrence within 2.6 years of radiation, and doubling time of <3.6 months at the time of recurrence.  Conclusions:   Moderate dose escalation (78 Gy) decreases biochemical and clinical failure as well as prostate cancer death in patients with pretreatment PSA >10 ng/mL or high-risk disease.""","""['Deborah A Kuban', 'Lawrence B Levy', 'M Rex Cheung', 'Andrew K Lee', 'Seungtaek Choi', 'Steven Frank', 'Alan Pollack']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Long-term results of the M.

No criterion standard of treatment has been established, although argon plasma coagulation (APC) has increasingly become the treatment of choice. Previous studies have applied APC over multiple sessions, necessitating increased numbers of treatments.  Objective:   To assess the safety and efficacy of large-volume APC application in the treatment of CRP with the intention of a single-session treatment protocol.  Design:   Prospective study.  Setting:   Tertiary referral hospital.  Patients:   Over an 8-year period, consecutive patients with CRP with rectal bleeding were prospectively enrolled.  Intervention:   Large-volume APC application to affected rectal mucosa.  Main outcome measurements:   Number of treatments, bleeding scores, complications.  Results:   Fifty patients (mean age 72.1 years; range 51-87 years) were treated; 45 were men (prostate cancer). The mean period between radiotherapy and initial APC treatment was 23 months (range 4-140 months). Seventeen (34%) patients had grade A endoscopic severity, 23 (46%) grade B, and 10 (20%) grade C. Other therapies failed in 16 (32%) patients. The mean number of treatments was 1.36 (range 1-3) with a mean follow-up of 20.6 months (range 6-48 months). Sixty-eight percent of patients were successfully treated after 1 session and 96% after 2 sessions. Bleeding scores improved in all patients (P < .001). Seventeen (34%) patients experienced short-term, self-limiting complications; 1 (2%) patient experienced a long-term complication.  Limitations:   Nonrandomized study.  Conclusions:   Large-volume APC treatment was successful in the treatment of CRP, including those in whom other therapies had previously failed, and resulted in a decreased number of treatments compared with other published studies.

Various polymorphisms in TLR genes have been identified and associated with susceptibility toward various malignancies such as prostate cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. The present study was undertaken to examine the potential association of two polymorphisms in TLR2 and TLR4 genes with gallbladder cancer (GBC) susceptibility.  Methods:   Genotypes and allelic frequencies of TLR2 and TLR4 gene polymorphisms were determined for 233 GBC patients and 257 cancer-free controls randomly selected from the population, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated in a multivariate logistic regression analysis for the association of TLR polymorphisms with GBC.  Results:   'del' allele carriers of TLR2 (Delta22) polymorphism were associated with a 1.54-fold increased risk for GBC (95% CI=1.02-2.24; P(trend)=0.091). The TLR4 Ex4+936C >T polymorphism (g.14143C>T; rs4986791) was also found to be significantly associated with the overall higher risk of GBC under a dominant mode of inheritance (OR=1.96; 95% CI=1.11-2.26; P(trend)=0.021). The false-positive report probability (FPRP) approach advocated that these results were noteworthy (FPRP<0.5). Subgroup analysis showed that TLR4 Ex4+936C>T polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of GBC in females and GBC cases with gallstones (OR=2.85 and 2.22 respectively).

While used by the public, politicians, and the media, it is often discarded by clinicians and epidemiologists due to the heterogeneous mix of different cancers, risk factors and treatment modalities. We studied the trend in the Nordic 5-year relative survival and excess mortality for all cancers combined to see if the impact of case-mix and variations between countries in diagnostic methods such as breast screening and PSA testing could explain the lower survival in Denmark.  Material and methods:   From the NORDCAN database 1964-2003, we defined two cohorts of cancer patients, one excluding non-melanoma skin cancer and another also excluding breast and prostate cancer. We estimated age-standardised incidence and mortality rates, 5-year relative survival, and excess mortality rates for varying follow-up periods, and age-specific 5-year relative survival by country, sex and 5-year diagnostic period.  Results:   Prostate cancer is the main driver of the incidence increase in men, as do breast cancer in women, whereas cancer mortality in all Nordic countries is declining. The 5-year relative survival ratios are increasing in each Nordic population, but less so in Denmark. Country differences in survival stem mainly from follow-up periods immediately after diagnosis. Adjusting for the case-mix of diagnoses diminished differences a little while exclusion of breast and prostate cancer reduced the gap between countries in survival and excess mortality more considerably, yet post-adjustment, Danish patients still fare worse during the first three months after diagnosis.  Conclusion:   Adjustment for case-mix and exclusion of sites where diagnostic procedures change the pattern of incidence is important when comparing overall cancer survival across countries, but the correction only explains part of the observed differences in survival. Other factors such as stage at presentation, co-morbidity, tobacco and alcohol consumption are likely contributors.""","""['Hans H Storm', 'Anne Mette T Kejs', 'Gerda Engholm', 'Laufey Tryggvadóttir', 'Asa Klint', 'Freddie Bray', 'Timo Hakulinen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Trends in survival of patients diagnosed with male genital cancers in the Nordic countries 1964-2003 followed up until the end of 2006.', 'Trends in the survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the Nordic countries 1964-2003 followed up to the end of 2006.', 'Trends in the survival of patients diagnosed with malignant neoplasms of lymphoid, haematopoietic, and related tissue in the Nordic countries 1964-2003 followed up to the end of 2006.', 'Prediction of cancer incidence in the Nordic countries up to the year 2020.', 'Avoidable cancers in the Nordic countries.

Material and methods""","""Comparable data on cancer incidence and mortality in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden are available for analysis through a collaboration of the national Cancer Registries via the NORDCAN website (http://ancr.nu). In the continued spirit of Nordic collaborative research, a number of studies examining trends in cancer survival are published in this journal.  Material and methods:   The data were divided into eight 5-year periods by sex in five Nordic countries. Age-standardised 5-year relative survival ratios and excess mortality rates in the short-term (first month and 1-3 months following diagnosis), and the long-term (2-5 years after diagnosis) were calculated, as were age-specific 5-year relative survival using cohort-survival methods. A hybrid method combining the cohort and period methods was used for the period 1999-2003 as not all patients were followed for five years. Age-standardisation used the International Cancer Survival Standard, and calculation of expected deaths used country-specific population mortality rates.  Results:   The data series constitutes 3 360 397 tumours among 3 160 802 patients followed up for death through 2006 for 39 different cancer sites diagnosed in the years 1964-2003. The paper describes the data, exclusions and imputations, design and analysis, age structure and standardisation procedures, follow-up, and case-mix adjustment methods.  Conclusion:   The strengths of this study include the overall comparability and quality of the data, the national coverage, and the length of the time series. Collecting and analysing data from the five Nordic countries for 39 different cancer sites over 40 years in a systematised and comparable way is a major undertaking. A thorough description of the analyses, definitions and exclusions in the survival study, supplemented with corresponding information on cancer incidence and mortality is needed for appropriate interpretation and comparison between countries, and between and within cancer sites. This information must be made available to provide appropriate interpretation of the site-specific results.""","""['Gerda Engholm', 'Mette Gislum', 'Freddie Bray', 'Timo Hakulinen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Trends in the overall survival of cancer patients diagnosed 1964-2003 in the Nordic countries followed up to the end of 2006: the importance of case-mix.', 'Trends in the survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the Nordic countries 1964-2003 followed up to the end of 2006.', 'Trends in survival of patients diagnosed with male genital cancers in the Nordic countries 1964-2003 followed up until the end of 2006.', 'Prediction of cancer incidence in the Nordic countries up to the year 2020.', 'Occupational cancer in Denmark.

In various tissues, relaxin increases angiogenesis and cell motility through upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteases, and nitric oxide, and therefore maybe an attractive target for cancer therapeutics.  Methods:   To examine the role of relaxin in prostate cancer progression, LNCaP cells stably transfected with relaxin (LNCaP(RLN)) were used to form xenograft tumors, and microarray expression analysis was subsequently performed to determine novel pathways regulated by relaxin. Prostate cancer tissue microarrays from patient samples were stained by immunohistochemistry for further validation and correlation of the findings.  Results:   Expression analysis identified novel relaxin regulated pathways, including the ProtocadherinY (PCDHY)/Wnt pathway. PCDHY, which upregulates Wnt11, has previously been shown to stabilize beta-catenin, causing beta-catenin to translocate from the cytoplasmic membrane to the nucleus and initiate TCF-mediated signaling. LNCaP(RLN) xenografts exhibit increased PCDHY expression and increased cytoplasmic localization of beta-catenin, suggesting relaxin directs Wnt11 overexpression through PCDHY upregulation. Similarly, prostate cancer samples from patients who have undergone androgen ablation have increased Wnt11 expression, which is further upregulated in castrate resistant tissues. Like relaxin, Wnt11, and PCDHY are negatively regulated by androgens, and further analysis indicated that the overexpression of relaxin results in dysregulation of androgen-regulated genes.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that prostate cancer cell motility and altered androgen receptor activity attributed to relaxin may be mediated in part by Wnt11.""","""['Vanessa C Thompson', 'Antonio Hurtado-Coll', 'Dmitry Turbin', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Melanie L Lehman', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Colleen C Nelson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Relaxin becomes upregulated during prostate cancer progression to androgen independence and is negatively regulated by androgens.', 'Analysis of Wnt gene expression in prostate cancer: mutual inhibition by WNT11 and the androgen receptor.', 'A human- and male-specific protocadherin that acts through the wnt signaling pathway to induce neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate cancer cells.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the relaxin hormonal pathway in prostate cancer.', 'The dual and multifaceted role of relaxin-2 in cancer.', 'A Review of the Pathophysiological Mechanisms Underlying Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Protocadherins at the Crossroad of Signaling Pathways.', 'Relaxin reverses maladaptive remodeling of the aged heart through Wnt-signaling.', 'Molecular Hallmarks of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Visibility in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Since an elevated level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) per se reflects the presence of inflammation in the prostate, intervention to improve the PSA value might potentially have beneficial effects for the prevention of the development of prostate cancer. Isoflavones and curcumin have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. We examined the biological effects of soy isoflavones and curcumin on LNCaP cells. After that, we conducted a clinical trial for men who received prostate biopsies, but were not found to have prostate cancer, to evaluate the effects of soy isoflavones and curcumin on serum PSA levels.  Methods:   The expression of androgen receptor and PSA were examined in LNCaP cells before and after treatment of isoflavones and/or curcumin. Eighty-five participants were randomized to take a supplement containing isoflavones and curcumin or placebo daily in a double-blind study. Subjects were subdivided by the cut-off of their baseline PSA value at 10 microg/ml. We evaluated values of PSA before and 6 months after treatment.  Results:   The production of PSA were markedly decreased by the combined treatment of isoflavones and curcumin in prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. The expression of the androgen receptor was also suppressed by the treatment. In clinical trials, PSA levels decreased in the patients group with PSA >or= 10 treated with supplement containing isoflavones and curcumin (P = 0.01).

We present a novel technique (1) to detect early tumor cell dissemination and (2) to quantify the true tumor burden.  Methods:   Prospectively 232 LN of 20 consecutive patients with prostate cancer after lymph node dissection were longitudinally bisected, one half was subjected to single cell immunocytochemistry for pancytokeratine (CK), the other half underwent routine histopathological work-up and step section analysis. In immunocytochemistry, tumor cell density (TCD) was quantified by calculating the number of CK-positive cells/million leucocytes and compared to routine histopathology and step section analysis.  Results:   Eight of 20 patients were positive in histopathology and step sectioning, but 14 of 20 patients were positive in single cell analysis. Twenty-five of 232 LN were positive in routine histopathology, whereas 52 of 232 LN were positive in single cell analysis. Median TCD in histopathologically positive LN was 3060.0 x 10(-6) and 9.9 x 10(-6) in histopathologically negative LN (P < 0.0001). Mean TCD of histopathologically negative LN of pN1 patients was significantly higher than the mean TCD of pN0 patients (P < 0.003). Mean TCD per patient correlated with serum-PSA (r(2) = 0.48, P < 0.006).  Conclusions:   Single cell analysis has an increased detection rate compared to routine histopathology and even to serial step section analysis.

Methods:   Using cancer registry data from Brooklyn, NY and two countries in the Caribbean (Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago), survival rates were estimated.

Results:   The Caribbean cases were diagnosed at a later age than those in the US (Guyana: 74.5 years, Trinidad and Tobago: 72.4 years, Brooklyn: 65.8 years).

Methods:   The cohort was comprised of Caucasian men, aged 40-64, diagnosed with PCa between 1993 and 1996 in King County, Washington who participated in a population-based case-control study. CYP17 SNPs were selected to capture variation across the gene and known regulatory regions. PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) was obtained by linking to the SEER cancer registry. Recurrence/progression of PCa was determined from patient survey data and medical records. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to generate hazard ratios for patient outcomes.  Results:   Genotypes were available for 598 cases. With a median follow-up of 13.2 years, 44 PCa deaths were observed. Recurrence/progression events were observed in 30% of subjects.

The precise molecular mechanism by which the ER stress response culminates in cell death requires further clarification. The present study shows that in prostate carcinoma cells, the mda-7/IL-24-induced ER stress response causes apoptosis by translational inhibition of the antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Forced expression of Mcl-1 blocked mda-7/IL-24 lethality, whereas RNA interference or gene knockout of Mcl-1 markedly sensitized transformed cells to mda-7/IL-24. Mcl-1 downregulation by mda-7/IL-24 relieved its association with the proapoptotic protein Bak, causing oligomerization of Bak and leading to cell death.

However, little is known of the mechanism of its induction. Here, we provide evidence that AKT plays a critical role in upregulating cytoplasmic/secretory sCLU, which is responsible for docetaxel resistance. Western blot analysis indicated that docetaxel-resistant sublines derived from DU145 and PC3 prostate tumor cell lines displayed a markedly increased phospho-AKT level closely accompanied by heightened sCLU expression when compared with parental cells. To examine if AKT has a role in sCLU expression, AKT blockade was done by treatment with a specific inhibitor, API-2, or dominant-negative AKT transduction before analysis of sCLU gene expression. Loss of AKT function resulted in loss of sCLU and was accompanied by chemosensitization to docetaxel and increased cell death via a caspase-3-dependent pathway. To confirm that AKT affected resistance to docetaxel through sCLU and not through other mediators, tumor cells were first transfected with full-length CLU for overexpression and then treated with the AKT inhibitor API-2. We found that once sCLU was overexpressed, API-2 could not chemosensitize the tumor cells to docetaxel. Thus, the chemoresistance to docetaxel is mediated by sCLU and it can be induced by AKT. Lastly, AKT was found to mediate sCLU induction via signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 activation, which we have earlier shown to drive sCLU gene expression. These results identify a previously unrecognized pathway linking AKT to cytoprotection by sCLU in tumor cells.""","""['Bin Zhong', 'David A Sallman', 'Danielle L Gilvary', 'Daniele Pernazza', 'Eva Sahakian', 'Dillon Fritz', 'Jin Q Cheng', 'Ioannis Trougakos', 'Sheng Wei', 'Julie Y Djeu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Clusterin mediates TRAIL resistance in prostate tumor cells.', 'Secreted clusterin gene silencing enhances chemosensitivity of a549 cells to cisplatin through AKT and ERK1/2 pathways in vitro.', 'HMGB1 induction of clusterin creates a chemoresistant niche in human prostate tumor cells.', 'Clusterin and chemoresistance.', 'Secretory Clusterin: A Promising Target for Chemoresistance of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Clusterin and Its Isoforms in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Their Potential as Biomarkers: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Dysregulation of HNF1B/Clusterin axis enhances disease progression in a highly aggressive subset of pancreatic cancer patients.', 'The role and function of CLU in cancer biology and therapy.', 'Impact of STAT Proteins in Tumor Progress and Therapy Resistance in Advanced and Metastasized Prostate Cancer.', 'Taxane resistance in prostate cancer is mediated by decreased drug-target engagement.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study (593 lung cancers and 671 controls) within the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (N = 77,464). Controls were matched to cases by age, sex, randomization year, follow-up time, and smoking (pack-years of smoking, time since quitting). We assessed C. pneumoniae seropositivity and endpoint antibody titers (IgG and IgA against C. pneumoniae elementary bodies and IgG against CHSP-60).  Results:   C. pneumoniae seropositivity by microimmunoflourescence IgG or IgA antibodies was not associated with lung cancer [odds ratio of 0.88 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 0.69-1.13 for IgG; odds ratio of 0.98 and 95% CI of 0.75-1.27 for IgA]. In contrast, individuals seropositive for CHSP-60 IgG antibodies had significantly increased lung cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.02-1.67), and risk increased with increasing antibody titers (P trend = 0.006). CHSP-60-related risk did not differ significantly by lung cancer histology, follow-up time, or smoking. CHSP-60 seropositivity was associated with increased risk 2 to 5 years before lung cancer diagnosis (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.16-2.71; P trend = 0.006), thus arguing against reverse causality.  Conclusions:   CHSP-60 seropositivity and elevated antibody titers were associated with significantly increased risk for subsequent lung cancer, supporting an etiologic role for C. pneumoniae infection in lung carcinogenesis.

Methods:   Prostate cancer incidence (1999-2001) and census tract data were obtained for 66,468 cases in four states that account for 20% of U.S. blacks: Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee. Spatial clusters of localized-stage prostate cancer incidence were detected by spatial scan. Clusters were examined by relative risk, population density, and socioeconomic and racial attributes.  Results:   Overall prostate cancer incidence rates were higher in black than in white men, and a lower proportion of black cases were diagnosed with localized-stage cancer. Strong associations were seen between urban residence and high relative risk of localized-stage cancer. The highest relative risks generally occurred in clusters with a lower percent black population than the national average. Conversely, of eight nonurban clusters with significantly elevated relative risk of localized-disease, seven had a higher proportion of blacks than the national average. Furthermore, positive correlations between percent black population and relative risk of localized-stage cancer were seen in Alabama and Georgia.  Conclusion:   Association between urban residence and high relative risk of localized-stage disease (favorable prognosis) persisted after spatial clusters were stratified by percent black population. Unexpectedly, seven of eight nonurban clusters with high relative risk of localized-stage disease had a higher percentage of blacks than the U.S. population.

USP26 is a nuclear protein that binds to AR via three important nuclear receptor interaction motifs, and modulates AR ubiquitination, consequently influencing AR activity and stability.

Their actions are mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs), particularly ERbeta in the prostate epithelium. With the discovery of ERbeta isoforms, data from previous studies that focused principally on the wild-type ERbeta (ERbeta1) may not be adequate in explaining the still controversial role of ERbeta(s) in prostate carcinogenesis. In this study, using newly generated isoform-specific antibodies, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on a tumor microarray comprised of 144 specimens. IHC results were correlated with pathological and clinical follow-up data to delineate the distinct roles of ERbeta1, ERbeta2, and ERbeta5 in PCa. ERbeta2 was commonly found in the cytoplasm and was the most abundant isoform followed by ERbeta1 localized predominantly in the nucleus, and ERbeta5 was primarily located in the cytoplasm. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that nuclear ERbeta2 (nERbeta2) is an independent prognostic marker for prostate specific antigen (PSA) failure and postoperative metastasis (POM). In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, the combined expression of both nERbeta2 and cytoplasmic ERbeta5 identified a group of patients with the shortest POM-free survival. Cox proportional hazard models revealed that nERbeta2 predicted shorter time to POM. In concordance with IHC data, stable, ectopic expression of ERbeta2 or ERbeta5 enhanced PCa cell invasiveness but only PCa cells expressing ERbeta5 exhibited augmented cell migration. This is the first study to uncover a metastasis-promoting role of ERbeta2 and ERbeta5 in PCa, and show that the two isoforms, singularly and conjointly, have prognostic values for PCa progression.

Normal and cancer stem cells possess the ability to grow in vitro as self-renewing spheres, but the molecular basis of this phenotype remains largely unknown. We intended to establish a comprehensive culture system to grow prostatospheres (PSs) from both cancer cell lines and patient tumors. We then used gene expression microarrays to gain insight on the molecular pathways that sustain the PS tumor initiating cell (TIC) phenotype.  Results:   Traditional stem cell medium (SCM) supplemented with KnockoutSR (KO) allows the propagation of monoclonal PSs from cell lines and primary cells. PSs display gene expression and tumorigenicity hallmarks of TICs. Gene expression analysis defined a gene signature composed of 66 genes that characterize LNCaP and patient PSs. This set includes novel prostate TIC growth factors (NRP1, GDF1, JAG1), proteins implicated in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal maintenance, transcriptional regulators (MYCBP, MYBL1, ID1, ID3, FOS, ELF3, ELF4, KLF2, KLF5) and factors involved in protein biosynthesis and metabolism. Meta-analysis in Oncomine reveals that some of these genes correlate with prostate cancer status and/or progression. Reporter genes and inhibitors indicate that the Notch pathway contributes to prostatosphere growth.

We developed two multi-state Markov chain models to represent the natural history of two tumour populations, one with (Model I) and the other without (Model II) the potential for progression. For each, we derived the transition rates between the states and used these estimates to calculate the expected prevalence of preclinical low and intermediate-to-high Gleason score prostate cancers, using data from the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study on 2,310 prostate cancers detected by PSA testing in 71,511 men 50-69 years. We compared the expected prevalence for each tumour population to that of the observed based on ProtecT and the European Randomised Study on Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC)-Rotterdam Centre's first round screening data, the latter allowing independent assessment of the two models. The overall expected proportion of low Gleason score tumours was 0.56 under Model I and 0.81 under Model II, whereas the observed proportion based on either ProtecT or ERSPC-Rotterdam was 0.69. Using the observed prevalence from ERSPC-Rotterdam, we estimated that 22, 33 and 66% of the tumours in men aged 55-59, 60-64 and 65-69 years, respectively, had the potential for progression in the preclinical phase.

Thirty-three proteins were identified that displayed significantly elevated (P <or= 0.05) signals in post-treatment samples, including three proteins that have previously been associated with prostate carcinogenesis, galectin-8, T-cell alternative reading frame protein (TARP) and TNF-receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1). Expanded analysis of antibody induction in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients (N = 92) from two phase 1/2 trials of prostate cancer immunotherapy, G-9803 and G-0010, indicated a significant (P = 0.03) association of TARP antibody induction and median survival time (MST). Antibody induction to TARP was also significantly correlated (P = 0.036) with an increase in prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) in patients with a biochemical (PSA) recurrence following prostatectomy or radiation therapy (N = 19) from in a previous phase 1/2 trial of prostate cancer immunotherapy, G-9802. RNA and protein encoding TARP and TRAP1 was up-regulated in prostate cancer tissue compared to matched normal controls. These preliminary findings suggest that antibody induction to TARP may represent a possible biomarker for treatment response to GM-CSF secreting cellular immunotherapy in prostate cancer patients and demonstrates the utility of using protein microarrays for the high-throughput screening of patient-derived antibody responses.""","""['Minh C Nguyen', 'Guang Huan Tu', 'Kathryn E Koprivnikar', 'Melissa Gonzalez-Edick', 'Karin U Jooss', 'Thomas C Harding']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Treatment of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor secreting, allogeneic, cellular immunotherapy.', 'Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor--secreting allogeneic cellular immunotherapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Phase I/II trial of an allogeneic cellular immunotherapy in hormone-naïve prostate cancer.', 'Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-transduced allogeneic cancer cellular immunotherapy: the GVAX vaccine for prostate cancer.', 'Immunotherapeutics in development for prostate cancer.', 'GM-CSF elicits antibodies to tumor-associated proteins when used as a prostate cancer vaccine adjuvant.', 'TARP vaccination is associated with slowing in PSA velocity and decreasing tumor growth rates in patients with Stage D0 prostate cancer.', 'Galectin-8 is associated with recurrence and survival of patients with non-metastatic gastric cancer after surgery.', 'Differential blood-based diagnosis between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: miRNA as source for biomarkers independent of PSA level, Gleason score, or TNM status.', 'Overexpression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) are associated with poor prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer.']"""

The acceptance of disease-specific mortality as a practical surrogate for all-cause mortality may explain the discrepancy between expected and actual impact. Screening may reduce deaths from the target cancer but may increase deaths from other causes, most likely because of overdiagnosis, an increasingly recognized risk of cancer screening.

Nevertheless, the direct interaction between cPAcP and ErbB-2 has not been shown nor the specific dephosphorylation site of ErbB-2 by cPAcP. In this report, our data show that the phosphorylation level of ErbB-2 primarily at Tyr(1221/2) correlates with the growth rate of both LNCaP and MDA PCa2b human PCa cells. Further, cPAcP reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB-2 in a non-permissive growth condition. Expression of wild type cPAcP, but not inactive mutant, by cDNA in cPAcP-null LNCaP C-81 cells results in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 including Tyr(1221/2). Concurrently, Tyr(317) phosphorylation of p52(Shc), proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and cell growth are decreased in these cells. Conversely, decreased cPAcP expression by short hairpin RNA in LNCaP C-33 cells was associated with elevated phosphorylation of ErbB-2 initially at Tyr(1221/2). Its downstream p52(Shc), ERK1/2, Akt, Src, STAT-3, and STAT-5 were activated, and cell proliferation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and cyclin D1 expression were increased. Stable subclones of C-33 cells by small interfering PAcP had elevated Tyr(1221/2) phosphorylation of ErbB-2 and exhibited androgen-independent growth and increased tumorigenicity in xenograft female animals. In summary, our data together indicate that in prostate epithelia, cPAcP interacts with and dephosphorylates ErbB-2 primarily at Tyr(1221/2) and hence blocks downstream signaling, leading to reduced cell growth. In PCa cells, decreased cPAcP expression is associated with androgen-independent cell proliferation and tumorigenicity as seen in advanced hormone-refractory prostate carcinomas.""","""['Tsai-Der Chuang', 'Siu-Ju Chen', 'Fen-Fen Lin', 'Suresh Veeramani', 'Satyendra Kumar', 'Surinder K Batra', 'Yaping Tu', 'Ming-Fong Lin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Cellular prostatic acid phosphatase: a protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in androgen-independent proliferation of prostate cancer.', 'Suppression of LNCaP prostate cancer xenograft tumors by a prostate-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase, prostatic acid phosphatase.', 'ErbB-2 signaling plays a critical role in regulating androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer cells.', 'Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-ErbB-2 is regulated by the cellular form of prostatic acid phosphatase in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Cellular prostatic acid phosphatase, a PTEN-functional homologue in prostate epithelia, functions as a prostate-specific tumor suppressor.', 'Physico-chemistry and Cytotoxicity of Tenofovir-Loaded Acid Phosphatase-Responsive Chitosan Nanoparticles.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Biomarkers to Detect Prostate Cancer: A Multicentric Study Based on Non-Invasive Urine Collection without Prior Digital Rectal Examination.', 'Dynamics of antioxidant heme oxygenase-1 and pro-oxidant p66Shc in promoting advanced prostate cancer progression.', 'Urinary marker panels for aggressive prostate cancer detection.', 'Her2 Expression in Circulating Tumor Cells Is Associated with Poor Outcomes in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, strategies to improve efficacy are still required. Here we report greatly improved antitumor efficacy for both attenuated (dl1520) and highly potent (dl922–947) oncolytic mutants in combination with the current standard of care for late-stage hormone-independent prostate cancers, mitoxantrone or docetaxel. In agreement with previous reports, dl922–947 had superior potency compared with dl1520 both as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxic drugs. The dl922–947 mutant caused significant synergistic cell killing in both drug-insensitive and -sensitive prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, respectively, when combined with docetaxel or mitoxantrone. The magnitude of the synergistic response was greatest for dl1520 whereas overall efficacy was greatest for dl922–947, and the latter was also more efficacious in vivo in prostate cancer models. In DU145 and PC3 cells increased viral uptake (up to 9- and 8-fold, respectively), E1A expression, and altered cell cycle progression contributed to the synergistic cell killing. A similar trend was also detected in LNCaP cells. Potent E1A expression was essential for the response. In murine xenograft models (DU145 and PC3) tumor growth inhibition was improved when suboptimal doses of docetaxel and viral mutants were combined. These findings demonstrate that the efficacy of highly potent oncolytic mutants such as dl922–947 that target the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) pathway could be further enhanced even with low drug doses, and support the deletion of the E1ACR2 region in future candidate adenoviruses for treatment of hormone-independent prostate cancers.""","""['Suresh Radhakrishnan', 'Enrique Miranda', 'Maria Ekblad', 'Alan Holford', 'Maria Tome Pizarro', 'Nicholas R Lemoine', 'Gunnel Halldén']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Hum Gene Ther""","""['Adenovirus-mediated sensitization to the cytotoxic drugs docetaxel and mitoxantrone is dependent on regulatory domains in the E1ACR1 gene-region.', 'Improved potency and selectivity of an oncolytic E1ACR2 and E1B19K deleted adenoviral mutant in prostate and pancreatic cancers.', 'An oncolytic adenovirus defective in pRb-binding (dl922-947) can efficiently eliminate pancreatic cancer cells and tumors in vivo in combination with 5-FU or gemcitabine.', 'Optimisation of replication-selective oncolytic adenoviral mutants in combination with chemotherapeutics.', 'Genetically modified adenoviruses against gliomas: from bench to bedside.', 'Complexing the Oncolytic Adenoviruses Ad∆∆ and Ad-3∆-A20T with Cationic Nanoparticles Enhances Viral Infection and Spread in Prostate and Pancreatic Cancer Models.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Considering the potential for gene-based therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Polyethylenimine (PEI)-Mediated E1A Increases the Sensitivity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells to Chemotherapy.', 'Combination of cabazitaxel and p53 gene therapy abolishes prostate carcinoma tumor growth.']"""

The authors examined the association of parents' ages at women's births with risk of hematologic malignancies among 110,999 eligible women aged 22-84 years recruited into the prospective California Teachers Study. Between 1995 and 2007, 819 women without a family history of hematologic malignancies were diagnosed with incident lymphoma, leukemia (primarily acute myeloid leukemia), or multiple myeloma. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models provided estimates of relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Paternal age was positively associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma after adjustment for race and birth order (relative risk for age > or =40 vs. <25 years = 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.08, 2.13; P-trend = 0.01). Further adjustment for maternal age did not materially alter the association. By contrast, the elevated non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk associated with advanced maternal age (> or =40 years) became null when paternal age was included in the statistical model. No association was observed for acute myeloid leukemia or multiple myeloma. Advanced paternal age may play a role in non-Hodgkin lymphoma etiology.

We know what decision aids achieve in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but we still know very little about how they are used and how this relates to the informed decision making outcome measures.  Objective:   To examine men's use of an online decision aid for prostate cancer screening using website transaction log files (web-logs), and to examine associations between usage and components of informed decision making.  Methods:   We conducted an observational web-log analysis of users of an online decision aid, Prosdex. Men between 50 and 75 years of age were recruited for an associated RCT from 26 general practices across South Wales, United Kingdom. Men allocated to one arm of the RCT were included in the current study. Time and usage data were derived from website log files. Components of informed decision making were measured by an online questionnaire.  Results:   Available for analysis were 82 web-logs. Overall, there was large variation in the use of Prosdex. The mean total time spent on the site was 20 minutes. The mean number of pages accessed was 32 (SD 21) out of a possible 60 pages. Significant associations were found between increased usage and increased knowledge (Spearman rank correlation [rho] = 0.69, P < .01), between increased usage and less favorable attitude towards PSA testing (rho = -0.52, P < .01), and between increased usage and reduced intention to undergo PSA testing (rho = -0.44, P < .01). A bimodal distribution identified two types of user: low access and high access users.  Conclusions:   Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making, the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme. However, developers realistically have roughly 20 minutes to provide useful information that will support informed decision making when the patient uses a web-based interface. Future decision aids need to be developed with this limitation in mind. We recommend that web-log analysis should be an integral part of online decision aid development and analysis.

Variations in the viral envelope (Env) glycoproteins, which are used to pseudotype retroviral or lentiviral vectors, can alter vector performance, including stability, titers, host range, and tissue tropism. Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus (XMRV) is a novel human retrovirus identified in patients with prostate cancer. XMRV targets XPR1 cell surface receptor, which is expressed in a broad range of human tissues including hematopoietic stem cells. Pseudotyping with XMRV Env would allow targeting of XPR1-expressing tissues. Here, we characterized XMRV Env-pseudotyped retroviral and lentiviral vectors. Although HIV and MLV vectors were poorly pseudotyped with wild-type XMRV Env, replacement of the C-terminal 11 amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain of XMRV Env with the corresponding 6 amino acid residues of amphotropic MLV Env (XMRV/R(ampho)) significantly increased XMRV Env-pseudotyped HIV and MLV vector titers. The transduction efficiency in human CD34(+) cells when using the XMRV/R(ampho)-pseudotyped HIV vector (10-20%) was comparable to that achieved when using the same infectious units of vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein-pseudotyped vector (25%); thus the modified XMRV Env offers an alternative pseudotyping strategy for XPR1-mediated gene delivery.""","""['Toshie Sakuma', 'Suk See De Ravin', 'Jason M Tonne', 'Tayaramma Thatava', 'Seiga Ohmine', 'Yasuhiro Takeuchi', 'Harry L Malech', 'Yasuhiro Ikeda']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Hum Gene Ther""","""[""Membrane fusion and cell entry of XMRV are pH-independent and modulated by the envelope glycoprotein's cytoplasmic tail."", 'Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins derived from gibbon ape leukemia virus and murine leukemia virus 10A1.', 'Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with a modified RD114 envelope glycoprotein show increased stability in sera and augmented transduction of primary lymphocytes and CD34+ cells derived from human and nonhuman primates.', 'The mouse ""xenotropic"" gammaretroviruses and their XPR1 receptor.', 'The saga of XMRV: a virus that infects human cells but is not a human virus.', 'Pseudotyped Viruses for Lyssavirus.', 'Generation of Stable Cell Lines Expressing Golgi Reassembly Stacking Proteins (GRASPs) by Viral Transduction.', 'A Microfluidic Device to Enhance Viral Transduction Efficiency During Manufacture of Engineered Cellular Therapies.', 'RNA Virus-Based Episomal Vector with a Fail-Safe Switch Facilitating Efficient Genetic Modification and Differentiation of iPSCs.', 'Current status on the development of pseudoviruses for enveloped viruses.']"""

Mutual adjustment for aspirin, non-aspirin NSAIDs or paracetamol made little difference to these results. There was no evidence of confounding by age, family history of prostate cancer, body mass index or self-reported diabetes. Aspirin, NSAID and paracetamol use were associated with reduced serum PSA concentrations amongst controls.

We have studied the function of SNAI2 in prostate cancer cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed strong SNAI2 expression particularly in the PC-3 and PC3-16 prostate carcinoma cell lines. Knockdown of SNAI2 by specific siRNA induced changes in EMT markers and inhibited invasion of both cell lines into a matrigel matrix. SNAI2 siRNA-treated cells did not tolerate detachment from the culture plates, likely at least in part due to downregulation of integrin alpha6beta4. SNAI2 knockdown disturbed the microtubular and actin cytoskeletons, especially severely in PC-3 cells, resulting in grossly enlarged, flattened, and sometimes multinuclear cells. Knockdown also decreased cell proliferation, with a prominent G0/G1 arrest in PC3-16.

The Gleason score of the main tumor in prostate carcinoma is a powerful predictive factor for biochemical recurrence, but the significance of the Gleason score of tumor at the margin is unknown. In this study we aimed to investigate this subject in 336 patients (mean age 61 y, median 61, range 39 to 80; mean follow-up 41 mo, median 32, range 1 to 202) with a positive surgical margin in radical prostatectomy. The mean preoperative prostate specific antigen level was 8.2 ng/mL (median 5.8, range 0.9 to 85.0). The pathologic stage was T2, T3a, and T3b in 185, 127, and 24 patients, respectively. The Gleason score of the main tumor was 6, 7, 8, and 9 in 70 (all 3+3), 242 (3+4 in 186, 4+3 in 56), 8 (5+3 in 1, 4+4 in 7), and 16 (4+5 in 12, 5+4 in 4) patients, respectively. The Gleason score of the tumor at the margin was 6 in 220 (66%, all 3+3), 7 in 88 (26%, 3+4 in 59, 4+3 in 29), 8 in 19 (6%, all 4+4), 9 in 7 (2%, 4+5 in 4, 5+4 in 3), and 10 in 2 (1%) cases, respectively. The Gleason score concordance rate between the main tumor and the tumor at the margin was 69/70 (99%), 83/242 (34%), 5/8 (63%), and 6/16 (38%) in cases in which the main tumor had a Gleason score 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. The Gleason score of the tumor at the margin was lower, equal to, and higher than that of the main tumor in 160 (48%), 163 (49%), and 13 (4%) cases, respectively. The Gleason score of the tumor at the margin was strongly correlated with preoperative prostate-specific antigen, pathologic stage, the Gleason score of the main tumor, lymph node status, and the linear length of the tumor at the margin (P<0.05 for all). On both univariate and multivariate analysis, the Gleason score of the tumor at the margin was a strong predictive factor for biochemical recurrence (P<0.05). Among the patients with the same Gleason score in their main tumors (7 or above), those with a higher Gleason score of the tumor at the margin more likely had biochemical recurrence than those with a lower one. Reporting the Gleason score of the tumor at the margin can improve predictive accuracy of biochemical recurrence. We advocate reporting the Gleason score of tumor at the margin in radical prostatectomy.""","""['Dengfeng Cao', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Feng Gao', 'Yu Tao', 'Peter A Humphrey']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Re: The Gleason Score of Tumor at the Margin in Radical Prostatectomy is Predictive of Biochemical Recurrence.', 'High Gleason grade carcinoma at a positive surgical margin predicts biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy and may guide adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'Prediction of biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: analysis of 784 Japanese patients.', 'Biochemical recurrence rates are similar for pT2-positive surgical margins and pT3a.', 'Prognostic Value of Gleason Score at Positive Surgical Margin in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Radical prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Length of positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy: Does size matter? - A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Impact of Gleason score of the tumor at the positive surgical margin as a prognostic factor.', 'Radical or Not-So-Radical Prostatectomy: Do Surgical Margins Matter?', 'Estimated Costs Associated With Radiation Therapy for Positive Surgical Margins During Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Dataset for the reporting of prostate carcinoma in radical prostatectomy specimens: updated recommendations from the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting.']"""

It has also been employed for the successful treatment of prostate cancer, using the image-tracking CyberKnife system to compensate for intrafraction movements resulting from peristaltic motion and bladder filling. Large sporadic motions can be compensated for using an online target motion monitoring and cybernetic correction strategy. Radio-opaque gold markers can be implanted in the bladder during transurethral resection and used for online image-tracking during radiation to compensate for bladder filling and target movements. Transurethral bladder resection followed by chemoradiation and a stereotactic CyberKnife radiotherapy boost seems a promising approach for the treatment of invasive bladder cancer in heavily pre-treated patients or patients eligible for preservation strategies. In this case study of a patient with a previously irradiated pelvis, CyberKnife radiotherapy was feasible and well tolerated, with disease control and non-altered functional results two years after treatment completion. CyberKnife irradiation may also be considered for the conservative treatment of locally advanced T2-T4a N(0) M(0) bladder cancer with incomplete or uncertain transurethral resection.""","""['J Thariat', 'R Trimaud', 'G Angellier', 'M Caullery', 'J Amiel', 'P-Y Bondiau', 'J-P Gerard']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Radical radiotherapy and salvage cystectomy as the primary management of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

However, androgen-independent prostate cancer cells emerge after hormone ablation therapy, resulting in significant clinical problems. We have previously demonstrated that the HOXB13 homeodomain protein functions as a prostate cancer cell growth suppressor by inhibiting androgen-mediated signals. However, the role of the HOXB13 in androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells remains unexplained.  Results:   In this report, we first demonstrated that HOXB13 was highly overexpressed in hormone-refractory tumors compared to tumors without prostate-specific antigen after initial treatment. Functionally, in an androgen-free environment minimal induction of HOXB13 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, to the level of the normal prostate, markedly promoted cell proliferation while suppression inhibited cell proliferation. The HOXB13-mediated cell growth promotion in the absence of androgen, appears to be mainly accomplished through the activation of RB-E2F signaling by inhibiting the expression of the p21waf tumor suppressor. Indeed, forced expression of HOXB13 dramatically decreased expression of p21waf; this inhibition largely affected HOXB13-mediated promotion of E2F signaling.  Conclusions:   Taken together, the results of this study demonstrated the presence of a novel pathway that helps understand androgen-independent survival of prostate cancer cells. These findings suggest that upregulation of HOXB13 is associated with an additive growth advantage of prostate cancer cells in the absence of or low androgen concentrations, by the regulation of p21-mediated E2F signaling.""","""['Young-Rang Kim', 'Kyung-Jin Oh', 'Ra-Young Park', 'Nguyen Thi Xuan', 'Taek-Won Kang', 'Dong-Deuk Kwon', 'Chan Choi', 'Min Soo Kim', 'Kwang Il Nam', 'Kyu Youn Ahn', 'Chaeyong Jung']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['HOXB13 induces growth suppression of prostate cancer cells as a repressor of hormone-activated androgen receptor signaling.', 'HOXB13-mediated suppression of p21WAF1/CIP1 regulates JNK/c-Jun signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'The homeodomain protein HOXB13 regulates the cellular response to androgens.', 'Hoxb13, a potential prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Dysregulation of the homeobox transcription factor gene HOXB13: role in prostate cancer.', 'TRAF4-mediated nonproteolytic ubiquitination of androgen receptor promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cooperation between NSPc1 and DNA methylation represses HOXA11 expression and promotes apoptosis of trophoblast cells during preeclampsia.', 'Drug resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an update on the status quo.', 'Comprehensive network analysis of dysregulated genes revealed MNX1-AS1/hsa-miR-4697-3p/HOXB13 axis in ovarian cancer chemotherapy response.']"""

However, the role of 1.5T MRI in local staging of prostate cancer is limited. It is hoped that 3.0T MRI will be more useful in local staging of prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tissue contrast, artifact presence, and image quality of T2-weighted images (T2WI) of prostate cancer using 3T MRI with a phased-array coil at different slice thicknesses and fields of view (FOV). We examined 15 patients with prostate cancer. We obtained MR images at slice thicknesses of 2 mm and 5 mm in both small and large FOV. The image obtained at a slice thickness of 2 mm with a small FOV had inferior tissue contrast compared to the other images (P<0.05), but there was no statistically significant difference in contrast between images obtained at a slice thickness of 2 mm with a large FOV and those obtained at a slice thickness of 5 mm. Artifacts were rated equally among the parameter combinations. The overall image quality obtained at a slice thickness of 2 mm with a large FOV was significantly superior to the other three imaging parameters (p<0.05).
