The objective of this study was to investigate if being overweight could affect both the sensitivity of the PSA as a diagnostic tool and the progression of PCa in this group.  Methods:   Retrospective study of records from 400 patients that underwent testing for PCa during 2005 and 400 patients under treatment for PCa from 2003-2005 at the urology clinics of the Veterans Administration Caribbean Healthcare System. Accrued data included body mass index (BMI), age, PSA levels, biopsy results, and cancer status after treatment.  Results:   In men, with normal age adjusted PSA levels, overweight and obese men had 35.38% and 38.13%, respectively, positive biopsies while men with normal BMI had 26.15%. In addition, 73.84% of overweight men over 61 years old with normal PSA were positive for prostate cancer. There is a statistically significant decrease in PSA sensitivity from 71.7 (95% CI: 58.6-82.5) in men with normal BMI to 55.4 (95% CI: 41.5-68.7) in obese men (P = .015). In multivariate analysis, patients with a BMI over 25 kg/m2 had a 2.63 (CI 95%: 1.23-5.64) fold higher risk of metastases than those with normal BMI.  Conclusions:   in overweight Hispanic men the PSA level is a less sensitive marker for PCa and those individuals with higher BMI have higher prevalence of metastatic disease.""","""['Rosa Negrón', 'Andrea Vásquez', 'Mariely Nieves', 'Lourdes Guerrios', 'Margarita Irizarry-Ramírez']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ethn Dis""","""['The role of the digital rectal examination as diagnostic test for prostate cancer detection in obese patients.', 'Relationship between serum prostate-specific antigen levels and body mass index in Beijing men over 50 years of age.', 'Higher body mass index increases the risk for biopsy-mediated detection of prostate cancer in Chinese men.', 'The effect of obesity and lower serum prostate-specific antigen levels on prostate-cancer screening results in American men.', 'Body mass index and prostate cancer severity: do obese men harbor more aggressive disease on prostate biopsy?', 'Post-diagnostic health behaviour scores and risk of prostate cancer progression and mortality.', 'Post-diagnostic health behaviour scores in relation to fatal prostate cancer.', 'Factors Affecting the Severity of Fatigue during Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer; an Exploratory Study.', 'Post-Diagnostic Dietary and Lifestyle Factors and Prostate Cancer Recurrence, Progression, and Mortality.', 'Gut microbiota differences in Island Hispanic Puerto Ricans and mainland non-Hispanic whites during chemoradiation for rectal cancer: A pilot study.']"""

The identification of molecular factors that contribute to this disparity could improve diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the miRNA 26a expression profile in novel African American and Caucasian prostate cell lines at each clinical stage of prostate cancer progression.  Methods:   The miR-26a expression profile was investigated using novel African American and Caucasian prostate cell lines representing each pathological stage: non-malignant, malignant, and metastatic tumors. Relative miRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR.  Results:   Our data showed a 2.25 fold increase for miR-26a in the non-malignant, a 13.3 fold increase in malignant and 2.38 fold increase in metastatic tumors, when comparing African American and Caucasian prostate cell lines of similar clinical stage and pathological grade. African American malignant prostate cancer cell lines showed the most significant fold difference in expression among all cell lines tested. Furthermore, there was a general increase in miR-26a expression toward the more aggressive cell lines in both African American and Caucasian prostate cell lines.  Conclusion:   To date, we are unaware of any studies that compare the miRNA profile at different stages of prostate cancer among two racial groups. Although a gene target for miR-26a has not been identified, our data show a possible role for miRNA regulation of gene expression in prostate cancer progression. Furthermore, this study suggests that miRNAs could possibly contribute to the aggressiveness associated in African American patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Shaniece C Theodore', 'Johng S Rhim', 'Timothy Turner', 'Clayton Yates']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ethn Dis""","""['Differential expression of miR-34b and androgen receptor pathway regulate prostate cancer aggressiveness between African-Americans and Caucasians.', 'MicroRNA profiling of novel African American and Caucasian Prostate Cancer cell lines reveals a reciprocal regulatory relationship of miR-152 and DNA methyltranferase 1.', 'Identification and Functional Validation of Reciprocal microRNA-mRNA Pairings in African American Prostate Cancer Disparities.', 'Prostate Cancer in African American Men: The Effect of Androgens and microRNAs on Epidermal Growth Factor Signaling.', 'Racial disparities in prostate cancer: a molecular perspective.', 'Role of Precision Oncology in Type II Endometrial and Prostate Cancers in the African Population: Global Cancer Genomics Disparities.', 'Differential expression of microRNA between triple negative breast cancer patients of African American and European American descent.', 'Inhibition of MicroRNA miR-101-3p on prostate cancer progression by regulating Cullin 4B (CUL4B) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.', 'Racial disparity in prostate cancer in the African American population with actionable ideas and novel immunotherapies.', 'Role of Alternative Splicing in Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness and Drug Resistance in African Americans.']"""

According to the American Cancer Society, world-wide cancer deaths were 7.6 million in 2007. African Americans and other minorities are disproportionately affected. Effective cancer chemotherapy is scarce. This study is part of an ongoing search for potential cancer-fighting agents in medicinal herbs. In previous in-vitro studies, we have shown that the aqueous extracts of the medicinal herb Ocimum gratissimum (Og) inhibit the proliferation of several cancer cell lines, especially prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cells. Therefore, Og leaf extracts may harbor novel cancer-fighting compounds that need to be isolated, purified and characterized.  Methods:   Partially purified Og fractions were obtained from sequential extraction of Og powder with organic solvents of different polarities. The hypothesis that the anti-proliferation activity of the fractions will be significantly greater than that of either aqueous or ethanol extracts was tested by treating PC-3 cells with 1.61 mg/mL of each fraction. Spectral analysis of the fractions was also conducted.  Results:   Activity of the fractions was P2>P(3-2)>P(4-2)>P(3-1)>P(4-1). Fractions P2, P(3-2) and P(4-2) were 725, 75 and 2.3 times more active than the aqueous extract, respectively. Spectral analysis revealed peaks for: P(3-2) and aqueous extract at 208 nm, P2 and P(4-2) at 210 nm, and P(3-1) at 220 nm.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that fractions P2, P(3-2) and P(4-2) could be potential sources of Og's bioactive component(s) that warrant further purification and characterization.""","""['Stephen I N Ekunwe', 'Melvanique S Thomas', 'Xuan Luo', 'Hengshan Wang', 'Yong Chen', 'Xiaopu Zhang', 'Gregorio B Begonia']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ethn Dis""","""['Fractionated Ocimum gratissimum leaf extract inhibit prostate cancer (PC3·AR) cells growth by reducing androgen receptor and survivin levels.', 'Inhibition of breast tumor growth and angiogenesis by a medicinal herb: Ocimum gratissimum.', 'The Use of NMR Metabolite Profiling and in vivo Hypoglycemic Assay for Comparison of Unfractionated Aqueous Leaf Extracts of Two Ocimum Species.', 'Final report on the safety assessment of AloeAndongensis Extract, Aloe Andongensis Leaf Juice,aloe Arborescens Leaf Extract, Aloe Arborescens Leaf Juice, Aloe Arborescens Leaf Protoplasts, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice,aloe Barbadensis Leaf Polysaccharides, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Juice, and Aloe Ferox Leaf Juice Extract.', 'Final report on the safety assessment of capsicum annuum extract, capsicum annuum fruit extract, capsicum annuum resin, capsicum annuum fruit powder, capsicum frutescens fruit, capsicum frutescens fruit extract, capsicum frutescens resin, and capsaicin.', 'A review on the traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities of clove basil (Ocimum gratissimum L.).', 'Integration of medicinal plants into the traditional system of medicine for the treatment of cancer in Sokoto State, Nigeria.', 'Ocimum gratissimum leaf extract may precipitate infertility in male diabetic Wistar rats.']"""

Five-year age-specific rates, crude incidence rates (CR), world age-standardized rates (ASR), percent change (PC) and annual percent change (APC) were calculated using annual data on population size and its estimated age structure. A total of 6,975 incident cases of cancer were registered, with a male to-female sex ratio of 1.4:1. ASRs showed stable trends (-0.1% in males, and +1.0% in females). The leading cancer sites in rank were lung, breast, lymphoma, colon-rectum, bladder, prostate, leukemia, stomach and cervix uteri. For males, the incidence rates of lung, bladder and prostate cancers remained stable over time. While, cancers of colon-rectum showed a marked increase in incidence (APC: +4.8%; 95% CI: 1.2%, 8.4%) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) showed a notable decline (APC: -4.4%; 95% CI: -8.2, -0.6). For females, cancers of the breast (APC: +2.2%; 95% CI: 0.4%, 4.0%) and corpus uteri (APC: +7.4%; 95% CI: 2.8%, 12.0%) showed a marked increase in incidence during the study period, while the cervix uteri cancer decreased significantly (APC: -6.1%; 95% CI: -9.2%, -3.0%).

This enzyme is activated in 90% of human cancers, and inhibitors of telomerase are currently in clinical trials to counteract tumor growth. Many aspects of telomerase biology have been investigated for therapy, particularly inhibition of the enzyme, but little was done regarding its subcellular shuttling. We have recently shown that mutations in the nuclear export signal of hTERT, the catalytic component of telomerase, led to a mutant ((NES-)hTERT) that failed to immortalize cells despite nuclear localization and catalytic activity. Expression of (NES-)hTERT in primary fibroblast resulted in telomere-based premature senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we show that expression of (NES-)hTERT in LNCaP, SQ20B and HeLa cells rapidly and significantly decreases their proliferation rate and ability to form colonies in soft agar while not interfering with endogenous telomerase activity. The cancer cells showed increased DNA damage at telomeric and extra-telomeric sites, and became sensitive to ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide exposures. Our data show that expression of (NES-)hTERT efficiently counteracts cancer cell growth in vitro in at least two different ways, and suggest manipulation with the NES of hTERT or its subcellular shuttling as a new strategy for cancer treatment.""","""['Olga A Kovalenko', 'Jessica Kaplunov', 'Utz Herbig', 'Sonia Detoledo', 'Edouard I Azzam', 'Janine H Santos']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A mutant telomerase defective in nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling fails to immortalize cells and is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.', 'p53-Dependent accelerated senescence induced by ionizing radiation in breast tumour cells.', 'Derepression of hTERT gene expression promotes escape from oncogene-induced cellular senescence.', 'Tissue formation and tissue engineering through host cell recruitment or a potential injectable cell-based biocomposite with replicative potential: Molecular mechanisms controlling cellular senescence and the involvement of controlled transient telomerase activation therapies.', 'DNA Methylation Profiling of hTERT Gene Alongside with the Telomere Performance in Gastric Adenocarcinoma.', 'Establishing and characterizing human stem cells from the apical papilla immortalized by hTERT gene transfer.', 'Many Functions of Telomerase Components: Certainties, Doubts, and Inconsistencies.', 'Telomerase Biogenesis and Activities from the Perspective of Its Direct Interacting Partners.', 'Telomerase Does Not Improve DNA Repair in Mitochondria upon Stress but Increases MnSOD Protein under Serum-Free Conditions.', 'Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Aging and Cancer.']"""

Method:   The study cohort included 7,765 prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy performed by 1 of 72 surgeons at four major U.S. academic medical centers between 1987 and 2003. Multivariable models were used to determine the learning curves for biochemical recurrence and surgical margins, separately for surgeons with and without fellowship training, after adjustment for standard prognostic variables.  Results:   Initial results for fellowship- and non-fellowship-trained surgeons were similar (five-year probability of recurrence for first case: 19.4% and 18.3%, respectively; absolute difference: -1.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.5%, 3.0%; P = .7). However, the rate of learning was faster among fellowship-trained surgeons (P = .006), which resulted in their overall superior cancer control (P = .001; difference: 4.7%; 95% CI: 2.6%, 7.4%). With regard to positive surgical margin rates, fellowship-trained surgeons initially had superior results than did non-fellowship-trained surgeons (P = .005; 36% versus 42%; absolute difference: 6%; 95% CI: 1%, 10%), but the difference between the groups' subsequent learning curves was not significant (P = .9 for interaction).  Conclusions:   The learning curve for biochemical recurrence depends on surgical training, whereas the learning curve for surgical margins does not. This difference suggests that improvements in margin rates result from reflection on specific aspects of surgical procedure, whereas improvements in biochemical recurrence occur by some general process of improvement in surgical technique.

The levels of AR are tightly controlled in androgen-responsive cells in which it plays a central role in the regulation of target gene expression. The AR is abundantly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs), but levels decline markedly after differentiation into decidual cells in vivo and in primary cultures. Decidualization profoundly down-regulated AR protein levels with no discernible effect on either AR mRNA or protein stability, suggesting that loss of the receptor was a consequence of translational inhibition. Here we show that HESCs express three RNA-binding proteins, Hu antigen R and the poly(C)-binding proteins PCBP1 and PCBP2, that reportedly target the 3'-untranslated region of AR transcripts. Only PCBP1 expression was enhanced in secretory endometrium in vivo and in decidualizing HESCs. Furthermore, knockdown of PCBP1 in decidualizing cells was sufficient to restore AR protein levels, indicating that loss of the AR protein is primarily the consequence of a translational block. PCBP1 also blocked AR translation in a cell-free system, although this did not require binding to the 3'-untranslated region of the receptor mRNA. Furthermore, knockdown of PCBP1 in the prostate cancer LNCaP cell line also increased AR protein.

The sub-cellular expression of these isozymes and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PC tissue microarrays (n=62) was examined using immunohistochemistry. The effect of SRD5A inhibition on the angiogenesis pathway genes in PC was also examined in prostate cell lines, LNCaP, PC3, and RWPE-1, by treating them with the SRD5A inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride, followed by western blot, quantitative PCR, and ELISA chip array techniques. In PC tissues, nuclear SRD5A1 expression was strongly associated with higher cancer Gleason scores (P=0.02), higher cancer stage (P=0.01), and higher serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels (P=0.01), whereas nuclear SRD5A2 expression was correlated with VEGF expression (P=0.01).

Bone metastases often occur in patients with various cancers, such as breast, lung and prostate cancer. Bcl-2 is a potent antiapoptotic protein and its expression is known to be closely related to its function. In this study, to investigate the effect of bisphosphonates on cancer cells, we focused on bcl-2 expression in bisphosphonate-treated prostate cancer cells. First, we observed that bcl-2 mRNA expression in PC-3 was significantly inhibited to 12% of the control level by treatment with 100 microM pamidronate for 12h. Inhibition was seen in cells treated with nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, which have the ability to inhibit isoprenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway, but not in non-nitrogen-containing etidronate. Simultaneous treatment with geranylgeraniol, an intermediate of the mevalonate pathway, significantly blocked inhibition by pamidronate, and treatment with geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-286 also suppressed bcl-2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, pamidronate inhibited the translocation of Rap1 protein to the membrane fraction, suggesting that a change in posttranslational modification of Rap1 occurred in treated cells. Finally, knockdown of Rap1 by siRNA resulted in the inhibition of bcl-2 expression. These results strongly indicate that bcl-2 reduction in bisphosphonate-treated PC-3 cells is dependent on inhibition of the mevalonate pathway.

Patients and methods:   This interventional study was designed to determine whether changing antibiotic prophylaxis had any bearing on developing serious infectious complications after taking TRUSgpb. As a secondary aim, we also investigated Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) rates in the same groups of men undergoing TRUSgpb. Men historically received ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally 1 h before their procedure followed by a 3-day course of 500 mg given twice daily (group A). Due to increasing local patterns of antimicrobial resistance to quinolones and concerns regarding potential antibiotic induced C. difficile infection, antibiotic prophylaxis was changed to a penicillin-based regimen comprising of co-amoxiclav 625 mg given orally 1 h before TRUSgpb followed by a three times daily course for 3 days (group B). Excluded from the study were those men given an alternative antibiotic prophylaxis than those given within the two distinct groups due to reasons of previous hypersensitivity reactions and/or clinical decision by the attending Urologist. Comparisons were made between the groups using two-tailed Fisher's exact tests.  Results:   In all, 119 and 110 men were identified in groups A and B, respectively. Two men in group A (1.68%) developed sepsis after TRUSgpb requiring hospital admission and intravenous antibiotic treatment. The sepsis rate in group B was significantly higher than that of group A (eight of 110, 7.27%; P = 0.036). Escherichia coli was the only organism isolated from our cohort of patients. There were no incidences of C. difficile infections in either antibiotic prophylaxis groups.  Conclusion:   Ciprofloxacin appears to provide superior prophylaxis than co-amoxiclav in men undergoing TRUSgpb and was not associated with an increased risk of quinolone induced C. difficile infections. Changing antibiotic prophylaxis from a quinolone-based regime may therefore be putting our patients at an increased risk of serious infectious complications after TRUSgpb.""","""['Satoshi Hori', 'Anup Sengupta', 'Alexis Joannides', 'Ben Balogun-Ojuri', 'Rebecca Tilley', 'John McLoughlin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Changing antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: are we putting our patients at risk?', 'Transrectal prostatic biopsy: the role of preventive measures.', 'Reduction in bacteremia rates after rectum sterilization before transrectal, ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Septic shock after transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.

Patients and methods:   In all, 162 men with hystologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma were included in the analysis. In all, 82 men were treated with 3D-HFRT (15 fractions of 3.62 Gy delivered 3 times/week; a total dose of 54.3 Gy).

Androgen secretion does not cease, it gradually decreases but usually continues at some level. A diagnosis of hypogonadism should rely on both symptoms and laboratory tests. Declining testosterone levels with age are primarily due to changes in the testes, which show decreases in the number of Leydig cells, the activity of enzymes that contribute to testosterone production, and the ability to increase testosterone production in response to gonadotropin stimulation. Physicians should also take note of symptoms indicatine age-related complaints. Validated questionnaires can be helpful. Administration of androgens appears to improve positive aspects of mood. Hypogonadism is also a risk factors for osteoporosis. Aging is associated with a reduction in sexual activity. T and DHT appear to be essential for development and maintenance of libido or sexual desire, and they probably have a direct effect on penile erections. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) affects nocturnal erections and penile rigidity in hypogonadal males. It is not known whether TRT will increase the risk of prostate cancer. The influence of T on prostate carcinogenesis and other prostate outcomes remains poorly defined. The aim of treatment for hypogonadism is to normalize serum testosterone levels and abolish symptoms or pathological states that are due to low testosterone levels.

In common with many laparoscopic radical prostatectomy centers, we perform PLND in patients found to have intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer based upon preoperative PSA, prostate biopsy and imaging. We assessed the feasibility of performing a secondary laparoscopic PLND 6 weeks postoperatively in the presence of postoperative upgrading in patients who did not have PLND.  Methods:   A prospective study recording the pathological results and operative outcomes prospectively over a 10-month period during which 24 patients underwent a secondary PLND. All patients had a preoperative PSA level <10 ng/ml and biopsy Gleason score of ≤6 (3 + 3) and the prostatectomy specimen was subsequently found to have a Gleason score of ≥7 (4 + 3) or increased stage.  Results:   During the 10-month period, 377 prostatectomies were carried out in our department in which 54 (18.3%) had an upgrading in the prostatectomy specimen. 24 patients (mean age 60 and mean PSA 6.7 ng/ml) agreed to a secondary PLND. No lymph nodes metastases were observed. One patient who was sexually potent following a nerve-sparing prostatectomy was impotent after the secondary PLND.

Patients and methods:   At our institution between January 2000 and December 2007, we prospectively collected data from 251 consecutive patients with pathologically localized PCa after antegrade RRP. In our analysis 239 patients were included. PNI was defined as adenocarcinoma within the perineural space adjacent to a nerve. We evaluated the biochemical progression-free survival rate using the Kaplan-Meier method to establish the correlation between PNI and prognosis, the log-rank test to verify the statistical significance, and χ(2) test to investigate the correlation between PNI and other clinicopathological parameters.  Results:   We found intraprostatic PNI in 157 patients (65.7%). The PNI rate was 73% (149/204) in pT2b-c vs. 26% (8/35) in pT2a surgical specimens (p < 0.001), and it was 78.5% (73/93) in patients with a Gleason score of 7-10 vs. 57% (84/146) in a Gleason score of 2-6 (p < 0.01). The mean follow-up was 65.4 (median 62, range 24-118) months. Overall, 11/239 (4.6%) patients presented biochemical recurrence after surgery and 7 (63.6%) of these patients showed PNI, but this was not statistically higher than in patients free from progression (150/228, 65.7%). The actuarial biochemical progression-free survival rate for all patients was 96.9 and 93.5% at 60 and 84 months, respectively, and the stratification based on the presence or absence of PNI did not allow us to identify different prognostic groups.  Conclusions:   Perineural infiltration frequently takes part in the pathway of extraprostatic extension.

Bryostatin 1 impairs phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced tumor promotion in mice and is in clinical trials as an anticancer agent for a number of hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors. In this study, we characterized the effect of bryostatin 1 on LNCaP prostate cancer cells, a cellular model in which PKC isozymes play important roles in the control of growth and survival. Although phorbol esters promote a strong apoptotic response in LNCaP cells via PKCdelta-mediated release of TNFalpha, bryostatin 1 failed to trigger a death effect even at high concentrations, and it prevented PMA-induced apoptosis in these cells. Mechanistic analysis revealed that bryostatin 1 is unable to induce TNFalpha release, and it impairs the secretion of this cytokine from LNCaP cells in response to PMA.

Due to the toxicity profile of taxane-based chemotherapy and treatment failure in some patients, novel agents with improved efficacy to side effect profiles are urgently needed. Eg5, a member of the kinesin-5 family, controls the formation of the bipolar spindle during cell division, and suppressed Eg5 function leads to mitotic arrest. S-Trityl-L-cysteine (STLC) is a novel Eg5-specific small-molecule inhibitor. Here, we report the first study to evaluate its use in prostate cancer. In a panel of prostate cancer cells, LNCaP and PC3 cells were the most and least sensitive to STLC treatment, with a 7.2-fold difference in their respective GI(50) values: 250 nmol/L and 1.8 micromol/L. In LNCaP cells, treatment with either STLC or docetaxel resulted in transient G(2)-M arrest and subsequent caspase-mediated cell death. However, STLC- and docetaxel-treated PC3M cells have distinct fates: STLC induced a transient G(2)-M arrest, followed by polyploidy; in contrast, docetaxel-treated PC3M cells progressed to apoptosis after a transient G(2)-M arrest. Docetaxel-resistant LNCaP-derived (LDocR) cells respond to STLC in a similar manner to the parental cells. Although the docetaxel-resistant PC3M-derived (PDocR) cell line and its parental PC3M cells have similar GI(50) to STLC treatment, PDocR cells showed significantly more G(2)-M arrest and less apoptosis. Hence, although docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells remain responsive to Eg5 inhibition with STLC, there are key differences at the cell cycle level, which may have implication in future development.""","""['Carolyn Wiltshire', 'Babloo L Singh', 'Jacqueline Stockley', 'Janis Fleming', 'Brendan Doyle', 'Robert Barnetson', 'Craig N Robson', 'Frank Kozielski', 'Hing Y Leung']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['A potent chemotherapeutic strategy in prostate cancer: S-(methoxytrityl)-L-cysteine, a novel Eg5 inhibitor.', 'Structure-activity relationship of S-trityl-L-cysteine analogues as inhibitors of the human mitotic kinesin Eg5.', 'STLC-resistant cell lines as tools to classify chemically divergent Eg5 targeting agents according to their mode of action and target specificity.', 'Proteome analysis of apoptosis signaling by S-trityl-L-cysteine, a potent reversible inhibitor of human mitotic kinesin Eg5.', 'Mutations in the human kinesin Eg5 that confer resistance to monastrol and S-trityl-L-cysteine in tumor derived cell lines.', 'Mitotic phosphorylation of Tau/MAPT modulates cell cycle progression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Cellular uptake and cytotoxicity studies of pH-responsive polymeric nanoparticles fabricated by dispersion polymerization.', 'S-trityl-L-cysteine, a novel Eg5 inhibitor, is a potent chemotherapeutic strategy in neuroblastoma.', 'KIF11 is required for proliferation and self-renewal of docetaxel resistant triple negative breast cancer cells.']"""

In mouse models, Pim1 is known to cooperate with c-Myc to promote tumorigenicity. However, there has been limited analysis of the tumorigenic potential of Pim1 overexpression in benign and malignant human prostate cancer cells in vivo.  Methods:   We overexpressed Pim1 in three human prostate cell lines representing different disease stages including benign (RWPE1), androgen-dependent cancer (LNCaP) and androgen-independent cancer (DU145). We then analyzed in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity as well as the effect of Pim1 overexpression on c-MYC transcriptional activity by reporter assays and gene expression profiling using an inducible MYC-ER system. To validate that Pim1 induces tumorigenicity and target gene expression by modulating c-MYC transcriptional activity, we inhibited c-MYC using a small molecule inhibitor (10058-F4) or RNA interference.  Results:   Overexpression of Pim1 alone was not sufficient to convert the benign RWPE1 cell to malignancy although it enhanced their proliferation rates when grown as xenografts in vivo. However, Pim1 expression enhanced the in vitro and in vivo tumorigenic potentials of the human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and DU145. Reporter assays revealed increased c-MYC transcriptional activity in Pim1-expressing cells and mRNA expression profiling demonstrated that a large fraction of c-MYC target genes were also regulated by Pim1 expression. The c-MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 suppressed the tumorigenicity of Pim1-expressing prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, 10058-F4 treatment also led to a reduction of Pim1 protein but not mRNA. Knocking-down c-MYC using short hairpin RNA reversed the effects of Pim1 on Pim1/MYC target genes.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest an in vivo role of Pim1 in promoting prostate tumorigenesis although it displayed distinct oncogenic activities depending on the disease stage of the cell line. Pim1 promotes tumorigenicity at least in part by enhancing c-MYC transcriptional activity. We also made the novel discovery that treatment of cells with the c-MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 leads to a reduction in Pim1 protein levels.""","""['Jongchan Kim', 'Meejeon Roh', 'Sarki A Abdulkadir']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Pim1 kinase is required to maintain tumorigenicity in MYC-expressing prostate cancer cells.', 'PIM1 overexpression in T-cell lymphomas protects tumor cells from apoptosis and confers doxorubicin resistance by upregulating c-myc expression.', 'Pim1 regulates androgen-dependent survival signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.', 'Why target PIM1 for cancer diagnosis and treatment?', 'Novel dual inhibitor for targeting PIM1 and FGFR1 kinases inhibits colorectal cancer growth in\xa0vitro and patient-derived xenografts in\xa0vivo.', 'Impact of Histone Modifications and Their Therapeutic Targeting in Hematological Malignancies.', 'The clinical and molecular characteristics of progressive hypothalamic/optic pathway pilocytic astrocytoma.', 'Stabilization of PIM Kinases in Hypoxia Is Mediated by the Deubiquitinase USP28.', 'Receptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) stabilizes c-Myc and is a therapeutic target in prostate cancer metastasis.']"""

However, little is known about the role of PAR-4 in breast cancer. We investigated the possible role of PAR-4 expression in breast cancer. IHC results on tissue microarrays containing 1,161 primary breast tumor samples showed that 57% (571/995) of analyzable cases were negative for PAR-4 nuclear staining. Down-regulation of nuclear PAR-4 protein expression predicted a poor prognosis for breast cancer patients (OS; P=0.041, log-rank test). PAR-4 down-regulation also correlates with poor survival in the group of patients with luminal A subtype breast cancer (P=0.028). Additionally, in this large series of breast cancer patients, we show that ERBB2/HER2, EGFR and pAKT protein expression are significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival, but the prognosis was even worse for HER2-positive, EGFR-positive or pAKT-positive breast cancer patients with tumors negative for nuclear PAR-4 expression. Furthermore, using three-dimensional (3D) cell culture we provide preliminary results showing that PAR-4 is highly expressed in the MCF10A cells inside the acini structure, suggesting that PAR-4 might have a role in the lumen acini formation. Taken together, our results provide, for the first time, evidence that PAR-4 may have a role in the process of the mammary gland morphogenesis and its functional inactivation is associated with tumor aggressive phenotype and might represent an additional prognostic and predictive marker for breast cancer.""","""['Maria Aparecida Nagai', 'Renê Gerhard', 'Sibeli Salaorni', 'José Humberto Tavares Guerreiro Fregnani', 'Suely Nonogaki', 'Mário Mourão Netto', 'Fernando Augusto Soares']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Prognostic value of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein for invasive ductal breast cancer with triple-negative phenotype.', 'Biologic role of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule overexpression in breast cancer cell lines and clinical tumor tissue.', 'Prognostic value of phosphorylated HER2 in HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab.', 'Potential Therapeutic Agents Against Par-4 Target for Cancer Treatment: Where Are We Going?', 'Interleukin-19 in breast cancer.', 'Anticancer genes (NOXA, PAR-4, TRAIL) are de-regulated in breast cancer patients and can be targeted by using a ribosomal inactivating plant protein (riproximin).', 'Curcumin Sensitizes 4T1 Murine Breast Cancer Cells to Cisplatin Through PAR4 Secretion.', 'An Insight into GPCR and G-Proteins as Cancer Drivers.', ""Prostate apoptosis response-4 and tumor suppression: it's not just about apoptosis anymore."", 'Regulators of G-protein signaling, RGS2 and RGS4, inhibit protease-activated receptor 4-mediated signaling by forming a complex with the receptor and Gα in live cells.']"""

By use of a panel of cell biology techniques such as immunoblotting, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry, effects on the MAPK pathway and induction of apoptosis and autophagy were evaluated. We demonstrate that sorafenib reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, induced apoptosis and inactivated the MAPK pathway. Moreover, we show for the first time, that sorafenib treatment of prostate cancer cells also induces cellular autophagy. This feature is in accordance with the anticancer potential of sorafenib and adds another important effector mechanism of this compound.

To account for the stage migration seen in prostate cancer, we included only those patients who underwent prostatectomy after the year 2000. Information on a cohort of 1895 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2000 to 2008 was retrieved from the Duke Prostate Center database. Race (African American, non-African American), body mass index, age at surgery, PSA, biopsy Gleason sum (<7, 7 and >7) and clinical tumor stage (cT1, cT2/3) were analyzed by univariate analysis followed by logistic regression analysis. The Duke Interactive Clinical Equation for staging (DICE-S score) was calculated from the logistic regression model. The model was then internally validated using a bootstrapping technique. Biopsy Gleason sums 7 and >7 were more likely to have non-organ-confined disease compared with <7 (OR=2.97, Gleason sum=7; OR=3.25, Gleason sum>7). Clinical tumor stage, cT2/3, predicted non-organ-confined disease (OR=1.58). Older age was associated with non-organ-confined disease (OR=1.02), as was greater PSA (OR=1.12).

A concordance index (prediction accuracy) of 0.73 was reached on internal validation. Using the DICE-S score, age, PSA, biopsy Gleason sum and clinical tumor stage, we can predict non-organ-confined disease in radical prostatectomy at an acceptable accuracy.

Previous studies from our lab implicate 15-LOX2 as a functional tumor suppressor. To better understand the biological role of 15-LOX2 in vivo, we generated prostate-specific 15-LOX2 transgenic mice using the ARR2PB promoter. Unexpectedly, transgenic expression of 15-LOX2 or 15-LOX2sv-b, a splice variant that lacks arachidonic acid-metabolizing activity, resulted in age-dependent prostatic hyperplasia and enlargement of the prostate. Prostatic hyperplasia induced by both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b was associated with an increase in luminal and Ki-67(+) cells; however, 15-LOX2-transgenic prostates also showed a prominent increase in basal cells. Microarray analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles that could help explain the prostate phenotypes. Strikingly, 15-LOX2, but not 15-LOX2sv-b, transgenic prostate showed upregulation of several well-known stem or progenitor cell molecules including Sca-1, Trop2, p63, Nkx3.1 and Psca. Prostatic hyperplasia caused by both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b did not progress to prostatic intraprostate neoplasia or carcinoma and, mechanistically, prostate lobes (especially those of 15-LOX2 mice) showed a dramatic increase in senescent cells as revealed by increased SA-betagal, p27(Kip1) and heterochromatin protein 1gamma staining.

Owing to their limited coverage of tumor types and suboptimal prediction accuracy on distinct tumors, there is still room for alternative CUP gene expression signatures. Whereas in past studies, CUP classifiers were trained solely on data from tumor samples, we now use expression patterns from normal tissues for classifier training. This approach potentially avoids pitfalls related to the representation of genetically heterogeneous tumor subtypes during classifier training. Two expression data sets of normal human tissues have been reanalyzed to derive an expression signature for liver, prostate, kidney, ovarian and lung tissues. In reciprocal validation, classifiers trained on either data set achieved overall accuracies greater than 97%. Classifiers trained on combined expression data from both normal tissue data sets were able to predict the site of origin in a cohort of 652 primary tumors with approximately 90% accuracy. Prediction accuracies of primary cancer-based classifiers were in the same range, as determined by cross-validation on this cohort. For individual tumor types, normal tissue-based classifiers achieved sensitivities in the range of 64-99% and specificities in the range of 92-100%. Primary origins for 12 of 20 metastases were predicted correctly, with false predictions highlighting the need for accurate sample preparation to avoid contaminations by metastases-surrounding tissue. We conclude that gene expression patterns of normal tissues harbor phenotypic information that is retained in tumors and can be sufficient to recover the type of primary tumor from expression patterns alone.""","""['E Staub', 'H-J Buhr', 'J Gröne']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['WITHDRAWN: Predicting the site of origin of tumors by a gene expression signature derived from normal tissues.', 'An expression-based site of origin diagnostic method designed for clinical application to cancer of unknown origin.', 'Molecular diagnostic methods designed for clinical approach to cancer of unknown origin.', 'Mixture classification model based on clinical markers for breast cancer prognosis.', 'Cancer of unknown primary site: missing primary or missing biology?', 'A Novel XGBoost Method to Identify Cancer Tissue-of-Origin Based on Copy Number Variations.', 'A Deep Learning Framework to Predict Tumor Tissue-of-Origin Based on Copy Number Alteration.', 'Identification of the predictive genes for the response of colorectal cancer patients to FOLFOX therapy.', 'Development and validation of a microRNA based diagnostic assay for primary tumor site classification of liver core biopsies.', 'Classification of unknown primary tumors with a data-driven method based on a large microarray reference database.']"""

A case report""","""Case-report:   We report a case of serotonin syndrome caused by interaction between nasal fentanyl, oxycodone and escitalopram. Due to chronic painful episodes with paroxistic level of pain, a 66-year-old patient, treated for prostate adenocarcinoma and bone metastases received an association of major opiate analgesics (oxycodone 120 mg/day for 6 months, and fentanyl nasal spray four puff of 200 microg/puff). After the addition, for mood disorders, of a small dose of escitalopram (5 mg/day), he developed severe serotoninergic features including diaphoresis, night sweating, tremor, diarrhea, visual disorders with mydriasis and weight loss of 8.8 lbs (4 kg). Discontinuation of escitalopram resulted in complete resolution of his symptoms within 48 h except for persistent blurred vision.  Discussion:   The clinical manifestations of this case meet Sternbach's criteria of serotonin syndrome. Its possible etiologic factors include adverse drug reaction and pharmacodynamic interaction between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant and opioid analgesics. The Naranjo probability scale suggested a probable causality of escitalopram, oxycodone and fentanyl treatment on the serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome occurrence is estimated around 0.04% in the literature with incidence rates between 14 to 16% in voluntary overdose with serotoninergic agents. It is an infrequent syndrome with, most of the time, a mild to moderate clinical expression. Nevertheless, lethal evolution might occur resulting from either monotherapy with serotoninergic agents (eg: SSRI antidepressants) or the combination of several medications that will increase serotoninergic transmission and therefore intra cerebral serotonin levels. Its physiopathology is related to a hyperstimulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors. Its clinical manifestations involve mental status impairment and cognitive disorders, neuromuscular disorders and neurovegetative impairment. The prescription of SSRI antidepressants among patients depressed, and in pain, exhibiting somatic diseases, and who require regimens of major opiate or related analgesics, is not without risk.  Conclusion:   Clinicians and especially psychiatrists should be aware of possible interaction and the risk of serotonin syndrome when a patient receives a combination of different opioid analgesics and serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. Improved information and collaboration with somatic and pain specialists and the general practitioners could help reduce the occurrence of this syndrome which can have dreadful consequences.

ERRalpha, bound to a co-activator protein (e.g., peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma co-activator-1alpha, PGC-1alpha), regulates cellular energy metabolism by activating transcription of genes involved in various metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial genesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation. Accumulating evidence suggests that ERRalpha is a novel target for solid tumor therapy, conceivably through effects on the regulation of tumor cell energy metabolism associated with energy stress within solid tumor microenvironments. This report describes a novel steroidal antiestrogen (SR16388) that binds selectively to ERRalpha, but not to ERRbeta or ERRgamma, as determined using a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. SR16388 potently inhibits ERRalpha's transcriptional activity in reporter gene assays, and prevents endogenous PGC-1alpha and ERRalpha from being recruited to the promoters or enhancers of target genes. Representative in vivo results show that SR16388 inhibited the growth of human prostate tumor xenografts in nude mice as a single agent at 30mg/kg given once daily and 100mg/kg given once weekly. In a combination study, SR16388 (10mg/kg, once daily) and paclitaxel (7.5mg/kg, twice weekly) inhibited the growth of prostate tumor xenografts in nude mice by 61% compared to untreated xenograft tumors. SR16388 also inhibited the proliferation of diverse human tumor cell lines after a 24-h exposure to the compound. SR16388 thus has utility both as an experimental antitumor agent and as a chemical probe of ERRalpha biology.""","""['Sarah J Duellman', 'Joy M Calaoagan', 'Barbara G Sato', 'Richard Fine', 'Boris Klebansky', 'Wan-Ru Chao', 'Peter Hobbs', 'Nathan Collins', 'Lidia Sambucetti', 'Keith R Laderoute']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Characterization of a selective inverse agonist for estrogen related receptor α as a potential agent for breast cancer.', 'SR16388: a steroidal antiangiogenic agent with potent inhibitory effect on tumor growth in vivo.', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) coactivates the cardiac-enriched nuclear receptors estrogen-related receptor-alpha and -gamma.

Materials and methods:   Forty-five men with prostate cancer underwent prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including axial T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2WI, and single-shot echo-planar image (SS EPI) diffusion-weighted imaging. Two observers measured, in consensus, normalized T2 signal intensity (SI) (nT2, relative to muscle T2 SI), ADC, and normalized ADC (nADC, relative to urine ADC) on peripheral zone (PZ) tumors, benign PZ hemorrhage, and non-hemorrhagic benign PZ. Tumor maps from prostatectomy were used as the reference. Mixed model analysis of variance was performed to compare parameters among the three tissue classes, and Pearson's correlation coefficient was utilized to assess correlation between parameters and tumor size and Gleason score. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)-curve analysis was used to determine the performance of nT2, ADC, and nADC for diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Results:   nT2, ADC, and nADC were significantly lower in tumor compared with hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic benign PZ (P < 0.0001). There was a weak but significant correlation between ADC and Gleason score (r = -0.30, P = 0.0119), and between ADC and tumor size (r = -0.40, P = 0.0027), whereas there was no correlation between nT2 and Gleason score and tumor size.

We have examined whether the high oxidative stress in these cells causes a loss of SAHA activity and if so, whether pretreatment with an anti-oxidant can sensitize these cells to SAHA.  Methods:   A DNA-Hoechst dye fluorescence measured cell growth and dichlorfluorescein-diacetate (DCF-DA) dye fluorescence measured reactive oxygen species (ROS). Growth inhibitory and ROS-generating activities of SAHA in androgen-treated or untreated LNCaP cells and PC-3 prostate cancer cells, HT-29 and HCT-115 colon cancer cells, MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells and A549 and NCI-H460 lung cancer cells with or without pretreatment with an anti-oxidant Vitamin E was determined. SAHA activity against LNCaP cells treated with another anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) was also determined. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to determine intracellular SAHA level.  Results:   SAHA treatment markedly inhibits LNCaP cell growth, when the cells are at a low ROS level. SAHA is, however, inactive against the same cell line, when the cells are at a high ROS level. A significant decrease in SAHA level was observed in LNCaP cells with high ROS after 24- and 72-h treatment when compared to cells with low ROS. Vitamin E pretreatment that reduces cellular ROS, synergistically sensitizes oxidatively stressed LNCaP, PC-3, HT-29, HCT-115 and MDA-MB231 cells, but not the A-549 and NCI-H460 cells with low ROS to SAHA.

The aim of this study was to determine whether [(11)C]choline can be used for monitoring the effects of therapy in a prostate cancer mouse xenograft model.  Methods:   The androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 was implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of 13 NMRI (nu/nu) mice. All mice were injected 4-6 weeks after xenograft implantation with 37 MBq [(11)C]choline via a tail vein. Dynamic imaging was performed for 60 min with a small-animal PET/CT scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions). Six mice were subsequently injected intravenously with docetaxel twice (days 1 and 5) at a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight. Seven mice were treated with PBS as a control. [(11)C]Choline imaging was performed prior to and 1, 2 and 3 weeks after treatment. To determine choline uptake the images were analysed in terms of tumour-to-muscle (T/M) ratios. Every week the size of the implanted tumour was determined with a sliding calliper.  Results:   The PC-3 tumours could be visualized by [(11)C]choline PET. Before treatment the T/M(mean) ratio was 1.6+/-0.5 in the control group and 1.8+/-0.4 in the docetaxel-treated group (p=0.65). There was a reduction in the mean [(11)C]choline uptake after docetaxel treatment as early as 1 week after initiation of therapy (T/M ratio 1.8+/-0.4 before treatment, 0.9+/-0.3 after 1 week, 1.1+/-0.3 after 2 weeks and 0.8+/-0.2 after 3 weeks). There were no decrease in [(11)C]choline uptake in the control group following treatment (T/M ratio 1.6+/-0.5 before treatment, 1.7+/-0.4 after 1 week, 1.8+/-0.7 after 2 weeks and 1.7+/-0.4 after 3 weeks). For analysis of the dynamic data, a generalized estimation equation model revealed a significant decrease in the T/M(dyn) ratios 1 week after docetaxel treatment, and the ratio remained at that level through week 3 (mean change -0.93+/-0.24, p<0.001, after 1 week; -0.78+/-0.21, p<0.001, after 2 weeks; -1.08+/-0.26, p<0.001, after 3 weeks).

Metabolic changes occurred 1 week after therapy and preceded morphological changes of tumour size during therapy.  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrate that [(11)C]choline has the potential for use in the early monitoring of the therapeutic effect of docetaxel in a prostate cancer xenograft animal model.

However, the precise mechanism of action of TQ is not known. We investigated the mechanism of action of TQ in androgen receptor (AR)-independent (C4-2B) and AR naïve (PC-3) prostate cancer cells, as models of aggressive prostate cancers. Exposure (24-48 h) to TQ (25-150 micromol/L) inhibited the growth of both C4-2B and PC-3 cells, with IC(50) values of approximately 50 and 80 micromol/L, respectively. Within one hour, TQ increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (3-fold) and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels (60%) in both cell types. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited both TQ-induced ROS generation and growth inhibition. TQ did not increase the activity of caspases and the caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK did not decrease TQ-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, although TQ treatment resulted in the activation of Jun kinase (JNK), pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, did not protect cells from TQ. However, TQ significantly up-regulated the expressions of growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene (GADD45alpha) and apoptosis-inducing factor-1 and down-regulated the expressions of several Bc12-related proteins, such as BAG-1, Bcl2, Bcl2A1, Bcl2L1 and BID. In C4-2B cells, TQ dose dependently inhibited both total and nuclear AR levels (4-5 fold) and AR-directed transcriptional activity (10-12 fold). Interestingly, this suppressive effect on AR was not prevented by NAC, which clearly suggested that TQ-induced cytotoxicity is not due to changes in AR regulation. These data suggest that TQ-induced cell death is primarily due to increased ROS generation and decreased GSH levels, and is independent of AR activity.""","""['Padma Sandeep Koka', 'Debasis Mondal', 'Michelle Schultz', 'Asim B Abdel-Mageed', 'Krishna C Agrawal']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Exp Biol Med (Maywood)""","""['Thymoquinone-induced reactive oxygen species causes apoptosis of chondrocytes via PI3K/Akt and p38kinase pathway.', 'Reactive oxygen species mediate thymoquinone-induced apoptosis and activate ERK and JNK signaling.', 'Concurrent Reactive Oxygen Species Generation and Aneuploidy Induction Contribute to Thymoquinone Anticancer Activity.', 'Anti-cancer properties and mechanisms of action of thymoquinone, the major active ingredient of Nigella sativa.', 'Thymoquinone Shows the Diverse Therapeutic Actions by Modulating Multiple Cell Signaling Pathways: Single Drug for Multiple Targets.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Thymoquinone Alterations of the Apoptotic Gene Expressions and Cell Cycle Arrest in Genetically Distinct Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'ROS-Related miRNAs Regulate Immune Response and Chemoradiotherapy Sensitivity in Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Comprehensive Analysis and Experiment.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Certain Terpenoids as Anticancer Agents: A Scoping Review.', 'Potential anticancer properties and mechanisms of thymoquinone in osteosarcoma and bone metastasis.']"""

Specifically, the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway has been implicated as an important mediator between chronic inflammation, cell proliferation and prostate cancer. Dietary factors that inhibit inflammation and NF-kappaB may serve as effective chemo-preventive agents.

Methods:   We applied the life expectancy method to estimate YPLL caused by deaths of prostate cancer and all cancers in men by using 1999-2004 national mortality data, 2008 census population demographic projections, and 2004 U.S. life tables. We performed sensitivity analyses by varying death rate and population projections, and examined increase in YPLL from population growth, changes in demographics, and death rates.  Results:   The number of YPLL caused by prostate cancer deaths was projected to increase by 226.1%, from 291,853 in 2004 to 951,753 in 2050. Hispanics were projected to have the fastest growth in YPLL (977.1% from 2004 to 2050) caused by prostate cancer, followed by non-Hispanic blacks (543.1%), and non-Hispanic others (269.7%). People aged 75 or older was projected to account for 62.0% of YPLL from prostate cancer in 2050 compared with 50.8% in 2004. Of the projected increase in YPLL caused by prostate cancer deaths by 2050, 9.8% were due to changes in demographic composition, 26.8% because of mortality change, and 63.4% because of population growth.  Conclusions:   YPLL due to prostate cancer deaths are projected to increase dramatically, and become a greater burden in the future. The projections highlight the importance of comprehensive cancer control and research on cancers including prostate cancer and racial/ethnic-specific estimates.""","""['Chunyu Li', 'Donatus U Ekwueme']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Re: years of potential life lost caused by prostate cancer deaths in the United States-projection from 2004 through 2050.', 'Years of potential life lost for brain and CNS tumors relative to other cancers in adults in the United States, 2010.', 'Years of potential life lost and productivity losses from male urogenital cancer deaths--United States, 2004.', 'The health burden and economic costs of cutaneous melanoma mortality by race/ethnicity-United States, 2000 to 2006.', 'Years of potential life lost and productivity costs because of cancer mortality and for specific cancer sites where human papillomavirus may be a risk factor for carcinogenesis-United States, 2003.', 'Projecting the impact of AIDS on mortality.', 'Racial and Ethnic Trends in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Philadelphia, PA: an Observational Study.', 'Awareness of Prostate Cancer and Screening Modalities Among Long Island Men.', 'Years of potential life lost for brain and CNS tumors relative to other cancers in adults in the United States, 2010.', 'Burden among partner caregivers of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer within 1\xa0year after diagnosis: an economic perspective.', ""How 'male health' fits into the field of urology.""]"""

Methods and materials:   In a cohort of men treated with curative-intent RT for localized prostate cancer between 1988 and 2005, 117 men had PSA values after the first and second months of neoadjuvant ADT. Most men had intermediate-risk (45%) or high-risk (44%) disease. PSA halving time (PSAHT) was calculated by first order kinetics. Median RT dose was 76 Gy and median total duration of ADT was 4 months. Freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF, nadir + 2 definition) was analyzed by PSAHT and absolute PSA nadir before the start of RT.  Results:   Median follow-up was 45 months. Four-year FFBF was 89%. Median PSAHT was 2 weeks. A faster PSA decline (PSAHT ≤2 weeks) was associated with greater FFBF (96% vs. 81% for a PSAHT >2 weeks, p = 0.0110). Those within the fastest quartile of PSAHTs (≤ 10 days) achieved a FFBF of 100%.

Results:   The overall actuarial local relapse-free survival (LRFS) rate was 64% at a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 2-45 months). The median time to failure was 9.6 months (range, 1-23 months). On univariate analysis, LRFS was significantly correlated with prescription dose (p = 0.029). Stratification by dose into high (23 to 24 Gy), intermediate (21 to 22 Gy), and low (18 to 20 Gy) dose levels revealed highly significant differences in LRFS between high (82%) and low doses (25%) (p < 0.0001). Overall, histology had no significant effect on LRFS (p = 0.16). Renal cell histology displayed a profound dose-response effect, with 80% LRFS at the high dose level (23 to 24 Gy) vs. 37% with low doses (≤22 Gy) (p = 0.04). However, for patients who received the high dose level, histology was not a statistically significant predictor of LRFS (p = 0.90).

We hypothesize that estrogen inhibits CRPC in anorchid animals by suppressing tumoral androgens, an effect independent of the estrogen receptor.  Methods:   The human CRPC xenograft LuCaP 35V was implanted into orchiectomized male SCID mice and established tumors were treated with placebo, 17beta-estradiol or 17beta-estradiol and estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780. Effects of 17beta-estradiol on tumor growth were evaluated and tissue testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) evaluated by mass spectrometry.  Results:   Treatment of LuCaP 35V with 17beta-estradiol slowed tumor growth compared to controls (tumor volume at day 21: 785 +/- 81 mm3 vs. 1195 +/- 84 mm3, p = 0.002). Survival was also significantly improved in animals treated with 17beta-estradiol (p = 0.03). The addition of the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 did not significantly change survival or growth. 17beta-estradiol in the presence and absence of ICI 182,780 suppressed tumor testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as assayed by mass spectrometry. Tissue androgens in placebo treated LuCaP 35V xenografts were; T = 0.71 +/- 0.28 pg/mg and DHT = 1.73 +/- 0.36 pg/mg. In 17beta-estradiol treated LuCaP35V xenografts the tissue androgens were, T = 0.20 +/- 0.10 pg/mg and DHT = 0.15 +/- 0.15 pg/mg, (p < 0.001 vs. controls). Levels of T and DHT in control liver tissue were < 0.2 pg/mg.  Conclusions:   CRPC in anorchid animals maintains tumoral androgen levels despite castration. 17beta-estradiol significantly suppressed tumor T and DHT and inhibits growth of CRPC in an estrogen receptor independent manner.

Tumor angiogenesis is highly related with tumor progression and metastasis, with microvessel density (MVD) being an important parameter of metastatic potential. Canine seminoma is not yet well-established as SE or SS type including correlation with angiogenesis. We classified canine SE and SS, and then compared them to tumor associated vessels.  Methods:   Twenty-three cases of canine seminomas (2 intratubular, 9 diffuse, and 12 intratubular/diffuse seminomas showing both intratubular and diffuse patterns) were classified as SE or SS by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using monoclonal antibody against PLAP and by PAS stain. The histopathological data were then compared to see if there was a correlation with SE or SS. Angiogenesis of seminomas were evaluated by immunohistochemical assay using polyclonal antibody against Von Willebrand factor (vWF) and by calculating the means of MVD, vessels area and perimeters using computerized image analysis. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program was used for various statistical analyses.  Results:   The numbers of PLAP+/PAS+ canine SEs were 8/23 (34.8%) and PLAP-/PAS- SSs were 15/23 (61.2%). All SE cases (8/8, 100%) were intratubular/diffuse types. SS types included 2 intratubular (2/15, 13.3%), 9 diffuse (9/15, 60%), and 4 intratubular/diffuse (4/15, 26.7%) types. MVD and vascular parameters in SEs were significantly higher than in SSs, showing the highest value in the intratubular/diffuse type. Seminomas observed with neoplastic cells invasion of vessels presented higher perimeter and area values than seminomas without conformed neoplastic cells invasion.  Conclusion:   In this study, we demonstrated a positive relationship between canine SE and tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, we also showed that a tumor cells invasion of vessels were a correlated vascular parameter. Although metastasis of canine seminomas has rarely been reported, our results support that canine SE could have high metastatic potential similar to the human counterpart. Further studies are required to clarify the relationship between canine SE and clinical data with metastatic factors.""","""['Jong-Hyuk Kim', 'Chi-Ho Yu', 'Ji-Young Yhee', 'Keum-Soon Im', 'Na-Hyun Kim', 'Jung-Hyang Sur']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Evaluation of angiogenesis in canine seminomas by quantitative immunohistochemistry.', 'Classical and spermatocytic seminoma in the dog: histochemical and immunohistochemical findings.', 'Expression of protein gene product 9.5 and Sal-like protein 4 in canine seminomas.', 'Correlation of nuclear morphometric features with animal and human World Health Organization International Histological Classifications of canine spontaneous seminomas.', 'Spermatocytic seminoma.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a case-control study nested within ""the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study"" cohort in Sweden, inviting 661 prostate cancer cases and 661 age-matched controls to participate. Of the 975 (74%) respondents, we excluded 84 childless men with unknown fertility status. Thus, 891 men were included, providing 445 prostate cancer cases and 446 controls. Of these, 841 (94%) men were biological fathers and 50 (6%) men were infertile. Logistic regression showed that the infertile men were at significantly lower risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer than the fertile men (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.83). Conditional and unconditional multivariate models, adjusting for socioeconomic, anthropometric, and health-status-related factors, provided similar estimates.

The resulting proteins are identical in amino acid sequence with the exception that DSPII contains only one third of the central alpha-helical rod domain present in DSPI. Here we describe a novel minor isoform of desmoplakin that is also produced by alternative splicing of the desmoplakin gene and that we name desmoplakin Ia (DSPIa). DSPIa is an alternatively spliced DSPI mRNA with a unique splice donor site that is 90% homologous to and downstream of the DSPII specific donor. The resulting DSPIa mRNA is in-frame and encodes a protein that has a central alpha-helical rod domain of intermediate size and that is 156 amino acids larger than DSPII and 443 amino acids smaller than DSPI. We demonstrate, through recombinant expression and short interfering RNA knockdown, that the DSPIa protein is readily detectable, albeit at substantially lower levels than the dominant isoforms, DSPI and DSPII.

Methods:   Thirty-eight pfCTV were delineated on postradical prostatectomy computerized tomography scans of 8 patients by 5 observers. To estimate the risk of a geographical miss, a high risk volume (HRV) was defined and the percentage of ""missed"" HRV was calculated for each pfCTV.  Results:   Interphysician variability was considerable with a mean pfCTV of 39.09 cm (range, 11.8-72.5 cm). At least 25% of the HRV at the bladder neck/anastomosis and the retro-vesical space was excluded in 11 pfCTVs. The mean ""missed"" HRV was 27.5% (range, 2.3%-78.7%).

Conclusions:   pfCTV delineation is subject to considerable interobserver variability associated with a significant risk of inadequate targeting of the anastomosis/bladder neck region and the retrovesical space.

Enforced expression of SphK1 impaired the ability of green tea and wine polyphenols, as well as pharmacological inhibitors of PLD and ERK activities, to induce apoptosis in PC-3 and C4-2B cells. The therapeutic efficacy of these polyphenols on tumor growth and the SphK1/S1P pathway were confirmed in animals using a heterotopic PC-3 tumor in place model. PC-3/SphK1 cells implanted in animals developed larger tumors and resistance to treatment with polyphenols. Furthermore, using an orthotopic PC-3/GFP model, the chemopreventive effect of an EGCg or PPE diet was associated with SphK1 inhibition, a decrease in primary tumor volume, and occurrence and number of metastases.

In the open cohort, the odds ratio for Gleason score 8+ and advanced pathologic stage, though not PSA or Gleason score 7, increased dramatically when patients treated by surgeons with lower levels of experience were excluded (Gleason 8+: odds ratios 5.6 overall vs. 13.0 for patients treated by surgeons with 1,000+ prior cases; locally advanced disease: odds ratios of 6.6 vs. 12.2, respectively). The AUC of the multivariable model was 0.750 for patients treated by surgeons with 50 or fewer cases compared to 0.849 for patients treated by surgeons with 500 or more. Although predictiveness was lower overall for the independent replication set cohort, the main findings were replicated. Surgery confounds biology. Although our findings have no direct clinical implications, studies investigating biological variables as predictors of outcome after curative resection of cancer should consider the impact of surgeon-specific factors.""","""['Andrew J Vickers', 'Caroline J Savage', 'Fernando J Bianco', 'Eric A Klein', 'Michael W Kattan', 'Fernando P Secin', 'Bertrand D Guilloneau', 'Peter T Scardino']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Radical prostatectomy for incidental (stage T1a-T1b) prostate cancer: analysis of predictors for residual disease and biochemical recurrence.', 'Do tumor volume, tumor volume ratio, type of nerve sparing and surgical experience affect prostate specific antigen recurrence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy?

Three additional patients without mutations had no diagnostic information. Multiple relatives of individuals with a PTEN mutation had macrocephaly, MR, or early onset cancer (breast, renal, and prostate). Of those relatives tested, all had the familial PTEN mutation. None of the affected relatives had previously been diagnosed with Cowden or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. We noted in our previous study several adult relatives without any findings who carried a mutation. Combined with data from our previous cohort, we have found PTEN mutations in 7/99 (7.1%) of individuals with ASD and 8/100 (8.0%) of individuals with MR/DD, all of whom had macrocephaly.

The authors evaluated the renal safety and efficacy of CBCT after nephroureterectomy for upper urinary tract-urothelial carcinoma (UUT-UC).  Methods:   The data of patients who underwent nephroureterectomy for UUT-UC and received CBCT for adjuvant and/or palliative treatment were reviewed. Renal function changes and renal function-related adverse events (AEs) were analyzed, and objective tumor responses were assessed.  Results:   Sixty patients were enrolled, and a median of 6 cycles (1-22) of CBCT were administered. After the 3rd cycle of CBCT, serum creatinine levels were significantly higher than at baseline, whereas mean creatinine clearances and estimated glomerular filtration rates were significantly lower. These renal function indicators also tended to be lower than baseline after the 6th-21st cycles, but these decreases were not significant. Significant AEs (≥grade 2) occurred in 10 patients (16.7%), and serious AEs (≥grade 3) developed in two that required temporary hemodialysis. Univariate analysis revealed that a low estimated glomerular filtration rate at baseline was related to the occurrence of a significant renal AE with borderline significance (Hazard ratio = 3.284, P = 0.100). The overall tumor response rate was 30.2%, and tumor response rates of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd line therapies were 36.4, 25.0, and 12.5%, respectively.

Patients, methods:   Detailed clinical information, including common cardiovascular risk factors, was obtained retrospectively in 60 prostate cancer patients examined with whole-body FEC PET-CT. In each patient, we calculated the mean blood pool-corrected SUV, as well as the mean target-to-background ratio (TBR), in addition to the sum of calcified plaques (CPsum) from six major vessels: ascending and descending aorta, aortic arch, abdominal aorta, and both iliac arteries.  Results:   As reported previously, the CPsum correlated significantly with cardiovascular risk factors, in contrast to mean SUV or TBR scores, which did not show any significance with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. There was no correlation between CPsum, mean TBR or SUV, nor was there any significant association of CPsum, mean TBR or SUV with the prior occurrence of cardio- or cerebrovascular events.  Conclusion:   Contrary to a recent report, we found in our rather large cohort of elderly prostate cancer patients no significant association between FEC uptake in large vessels and atherosclerotic plaque burden, or the presence of cardiovascular risk factors.

Several studies systematically analyzed gene expression profiles in the context of biological networks and pathways, uncovering novel aspects of prostate cancer. Despite significant research efforts, the mechanisms underlying tumor progression are poorly understood. We applied a novel approach to reconstruct system-wide molecular events following stimulation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells with synthetic androgen and to identify potential mechanisms of androgen-independent progression of prostate cancer.  Methodology/principal findings:   We have performed concurrent measurements of gene expression and protein levels following the treatment using microarrays and iTRAQ proteomics. Sets of up-regulated genes and proteins were analyzed using our novel concept of ""topological significance"". This method combines high-throughput molecular data with the global network of protein interactions to identify nodes which occupy significant network positions with respect to differentially expressed genes or proteins. Our analysis identified the network of growth factor regulation of cell cycle as the main response module for androgen treatment in LNCap cells. We show that the majority of signaling nodes in this network occupy significant positions with respect to the observed gene expression and proteomic profiles elicited by androgen stimulus. Our results further indicate that growth factor signaling probably represents a ""second phase"" response, not directly dependent on the initial androgen stimulus.  Conclusions/significance:   We conclude that in prostate cancer cells the proliferative signals are likely to be transmitted from multiple growth factor receptors by a multitude of signaling pathways converging on several key regulators of cell proliferation such as c-Myc, Cyclin D and CREB1. Moreover, these pathways are not isolated but constitute an interconnected network module containing many alternative routes from inputs to outputs. If the whole network is involved, a precisely formulated combination therapy may be required to fight the tumor growth effectively.""","""['Adaikkalam Vellaichamy', 'Zoltán Dezso', 'Lellean JeBailey', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Arun Sreekumar', 'Alexey I Nesvizhskii', 'Gilbert S Omenn', 'Andrej Bugrim']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Genome-wide expression profiling reveals transcriptomic variation and perturbed gene networks in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Expression profiles of androgen independent bone metastatic prostate cancer cells indicate up-regulation of the putative serine-threonine kinase GS3955.', ""Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 helps accelerate progression to androgen-independence in the human prostate LNCaP tumor model through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathway."", 'Molecular regulation of androgen action in prostate cancer.', 'From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Heterogeneity of Lipid Metabolism in Cancer.', 'The Heterogeneity of Lipid Metabolism in Cancer.', 'Microfluidic cell sorting by stiffness to examine heterogenic responses of cancer cells to chemotherapy.', 'Identification of Transcription Factor YY1 as a Regulator of a Prostate Cancer-Specific Pathway Using Proteomic Analysis.', 'Neighbours of cancer-related proteins have key influence on pathogenesis and could increase the drug target space for anticancer therapies.']"""

In this study, we identified the well-known PCa marker, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), as a physiological TRPM8 agonist. Electrophysiological and Ca(2+) imaging studies demonstrated that PSA activated TRPM8-mediated current by the bradykinin 2 receptor signaling pathway. Further investigation of this mechanism by cell-surface biotinylation revealed that the increase in TRPM8 current induced by PSA was due to an increase in the number of functional TRPM8 channels on the plasma membrane. Importantly, wound-healing and migration assays revealed that TRPM8 activation by PSA reduced motility of the PC3 PCa cell line, suggesting that plasma membrane TRPM8 has a protective role in PCa progression.

Tumour growth was assessed in nude mice. The mRNA and protein expression levels of NSBP1, cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 were analysed in vitro and in vivo by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Knockdown of NSBP1 resulted in a 22.6% decrease in the growth rate of cells compared with the PscNC lentivirus control cells at 96 h, decreased tumour growth in nude mice, and the induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest (8.78%) and apoptosis (2.19-fold).

Growth suppression is at least partially due to NSBP1 knockdown-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Here, we show that the treatment of androgen-independent and PTEN-negative human CaP PC3 cells with fisetin, a dietary flavonoid, resulted in inhibition of mTOR kinase signaling pathway. Treatment of cells with fisetin inhibited mTOR activity and downregulated Raptor, Rictor, PRAS40 and GbetaL that resulted in loss of mTOR complexes (mTORC)1/2 formation. Fisetin also activated the mTOR repressor TSC2 through inhibition of Akt and activation of AMPK. Fisetin-mediated inhibition of mTOR resulted in hypophosphorylation of 4EBP1 and suppression of Cap-dependent translation. We also found that fisetin treatment leads to induction of autophagic-programmed cell death rather than cytoprotective autophagy as shown by small interfering RNA Beclin1-knockdown and autophagy inhibitor. Taken together, we provide evidence that fisetin functions as a dual inhibitor of mTORC1/2 signaling leading to inhibition of Cap-dependent translation and induction of autophagic cell death in PC3 cells.

In adults, CARM1 is overexpressed in human grade-III breast tumors and prostate adenocarcinomas, and knockdown of CARM1 inhibits proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that loss of CARM1 in mouse embryos would inhibit pulmonary cell proliferation, resulting in respiratory distress. By contrast, we report here that loss of CARM1 results in hyperproliferation of pulmonary epithelial cells during embryonic development. The lungs of newborn mice lacking CARM1 have substantially reduced airspace compared with their wild-type littermates. In the absence of CARM1, alveolar type II cells show increased proliferation. Electron microscopic analyses demonstrate that lungs from mice lacking CARM1 have immature alveolar type II cells and an absence of alveolar type I cells. Gene expression analysis reveals a dysregulation of cell cycle genes and markers of differentiation in the Carm1 knockout lung. Furthermore, there is an overlap in gene expression in the Carm1 knockout and the glucocorticoid receptor knockout lung, suggesting that hyperproliferation and lack of maturation of the alveolar cells are at least in part caused by attenuation of glucocorticoid-mediated signaling.

Consequently, model-projected outcomes under different strategies can be useful for developing cancer control policy provided that the projections are representative of the population. To project population-representative disease progression outcomes and to demonstrate their value in assessing competing early detection strategies, we implement a model linking prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and prostate cancer progression and calibrate it to disease incidence in the US population. PSA growth is linear on the logarithmic scale with a higher slope after disease onset and with random effects on intercepts and slopes; parameters are estimated using data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Disease onset, metastatic spread, and clinical detection are governed by hazard functions that depend on age or PSA levels; parameters are estimated by comparing projected incidence under observed screening and biopsy patterns with incidence observed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. We demonstrate implications of the model for policy development by projecting early detections, overdiagnosis, and mean lead times for PSA cutoffs 4.0 and 2.5 ng/mL and for screening ages 50-74 or 50-84. The calibrated model validates well, quantifies the tradeoffs involved across policies, and indicates that PSA screening with cutoff 4.0 ng/mL and screening ages 50-74 performs best in terms of overdiagnosis per early detection.

First, one must properly align a set of training shapes such that any variation in shape is not due to pose. Then segmentation can be performed under the constraint of the learnt shape. However, the general registration task of prostate shapes becomes increasingly difficult due to the large variations in pose and shape in the training sets, and is not readily handled through existing techniques. Thus, the contributions of this paper are twofold. We first explicitly address the registration problem by representing the shapes of a training set as point clouds. In doing so, we are able to exploit the more global aspects of registration via a certain particle filtering based scheme. In addition, once the shapes have been registered, a cost functional is designed to incorporate both the local image statistics as well as the learnt shape prior.

But the mechanism has not been clarified yet. There are few reports about the treatment of endometrial carcinoma using GnRH-I agonists. Type II GnRH (GnRH-II) is a new subtype of GnRH. Our aim was to investigate the effects of GnRH-I agonists and GnRH-II on estrogen receptor-negative human endometrial carcinoma cells and the effect from phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) to them.  Methods:   A lentiviral vector-mediated RNAi method was used to establish a PTEN-negative HEC-1A cell clone (HEC-1A-ND). MTT and flow cytometry were used to detect the cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of HEC-1A, HEC-1A-NC and HEC-1A-ND cells after treatment with GnRH-I agonist Triptorelin (10(-11) mol/L to 10(-5) mol/L) or GnRH-II (10(-11) mol/L to 10(-5) mol/L). Western blotting was used to detect AKT and ERK1/2 activation after treatment with different concentrations of Triptorelin or GnRH-II for 30 minutes in the above mentioned three kinds of cells.  Results:   Triptorelin and GnRH-II induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HEC-1A, HEC-1A-ND and HEC-1A-NC in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was augmented in HEC-1A-ND cells in which PTEN gene was knocked-down. Furthermore, Triptorelin and GnRH-II inhibited the AKT and ERK activity in HEC-1A-ND cells.

In this study, we assessed the impact of the learning curve on operative and oncologic outcomes at a high surgical volume institution.  Methods and material:   We prospectively analyzed 400 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer treated with LERP between January 2004 and July 2006. Patients were divided into 4 equal groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, and 301- 400). Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to determine whether all the preoperative variables were comparable among groups. Fisher's exact test was performed to determine the association of margin status with pathological stage. Chi-square test was performed to determine whether margin status was associated with groups (1 vs. 2, 3, & 4). Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine whether operative time was statistically different in group 1 (1-100) compared with groups 2, 3, and 4.  Results:   All groups were comparable with respect to preoperative data. Positive margin rate significantly decreased after the first 200 cases for patients with pT2a-c disease (28.4% to 31.9% vs. 11.6% to 11.5%). Margin status was significantly associated with groups (Group 1 & 3: P=0.0044 and group 1 & 4: P=0.0021). Operative time significantly decreased after the first 100 cases (350 min vs. 218 min, 192 min, and 223 min) (P<0.0001).

The selection of norms yields different extensions of multiple kernel learning (MKL) such as L(infinity), L1, and L2 MKL. In particular, L2 MKL is a novel method that leads to non-sparse optimal kernel coefficients, which is different from the sparse kernel coefficients optimized by the existing L(infinity) MKL method. In real biomedical applications, L2 MKL may have more advantages over sparse integration method for thoroughly combining complementary information in heterogeneous data sources.  Results:   We provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the L2 optimization of kernels in the dual problem with the L2 coefficient regularization in the primal problem. Understanding the dual L2 problem grants a unified view on MKL and enables us to extend the L2 method to a wide range of machine learning problems. We implement L2 MKL for ranking and classification problems and compare its performance with the sparse L(infinity) and the averaging L1 MKL methods. The experiments are carried out on six real biomedical data sets and two large scale UCI data sets. L2 MKL yields better performance on most of the benchmark data sets. In particular, we propose a novel L2 MKL least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) algorithm, which is shown to be an efficient and promising classifier for large scale data sets processing.  Conclusions:   This paper extends the statistical framework of genomic data fusion based on MKL. Allowing non-sparse weights on the data sources is an attractive option in settings where we believe most data sources to be relevant to the problem at hand and want to avoid a ""winner-takes-all"" effect seen in L(infinity) MKL, which can be detrimental to the performance in prospective studies. The notion of optimizing L2 kernels can be straightforwardly extended to ranking, classification, regression, and clustering algorithms. To tackle the computational burden of MKL, this paper proposes several novel LSSVM based MKL algorithms. Systematic comparison on real data sets shows that LSSVM MKL has comparable performance as the conventional SVM MKL algorithms. Moreover, large scale numerical experiments indicate that when cast as semi-infinite programming, LSSVM MKL can be solved more efficiently than SVM MKL.

One of these metrics is the risk of radiation-induced second primary cancer following radiation treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of second cancer risks in out-of-field organs from 3D-CRT and IMRT treatments of prostate carcinoma compared to baseline cancer risks in these organs.  Methods:   Monte Carlo simulations were performed using a detailed medical linear accelerator model and an anatomically realistic adult male whole-body phantom. A four-field box treatment, a four-field box treatment plus a six-field boost, and a seven-field IMRT treatment were simulated. Using BEIR VII risk models, the age-dependent lifetime attributable risks to various organs outside the primary beam with a known predilection for cancer were calculated using organ-averaged equivalent doses.  Results:   The four-field box treatment had the lowest treatment-related second primary cancer risks to organs outside the primary beam ranging from 7.3 x 10(-9) to 2.54 x 10(-5)%/MU depending on the patients age at exposure and second primary cancer site. The risks to organs outside the primary beam from the four-field box and six-field boost and the seven-field IMRT were nearly equivalent. The risks from the four-field box and six-field boost ranged from 1.39 x 10(-8) to 1.80 x 10(-5)%/MU, and from the seven-field IMRT ranged from 1.60 x 10(-9) to 1.35 x 10(-5)%/MU. The second cancer risks in all organs considered from each plan were below the baseline risks.  Conclusions:   The treatment-related second cancer risks in organs outside the primary beam due to 3D-CRT and IMRT is small. New risk assessment techniques need to be investigated to address the concern of radiation-induced second cancers from prostate treatments, particularly focusing on risks to organs inside the primary beam.""","""['Bryan Bednarz', 'Basit Athar', 'X George Xu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Calculated organ doses from selected prostate treatment plans using Monte Carlo simulations and an anatomically realistic computational phantom.', 'Exposure of remote organs and associated cancer risks from tangential and multi-field breast cancer radiotherapy.', 'Monte Carlo study of organ doses and related risk for cancer in Algeria from scattered neutrons in prostate treatment involving 3D-CRT.', 'Second primary cancers after radiation for prostate cancer: a review of data from planning studies.', 'Radiation-induced second cancers: the impact of 3D-CRT and IMRT.', 'Evaluation of IGRT-Induced Imaging Doses and Secondary Cancer Risk for SBRT Early Lung Cancer Patients In Silico Study.', 'VMAT for prostate cancer with 6-MV and 10-MV photons: Impact of beam energy on treatment plan quality and model-based secondary cancer risk estimates.', 'Estimation of secondary cancer risk after radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer patients with pelvic irradiation.', 'Radiotherapy of prostate cancer: impact of treatment characteristics on the incidence of second tumors.', 'Radiation-induced Non-targeted Effect and Carcinogenesis; Implications in Clinical Radiotherapy.']"""

Methods:   We evaluated the effect of docetaxel on the antitumor efficacy and efficiency of virus transduction, transgene expression and virus distribution of PRRA in a prostate-specific antigen/prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive tumor xenograft model. We also evaluated the effect of docetaxel on apoptosis induction, cell killing and the efficiency of transgene expression and virus replication in vitro.  Results:   Tumor growth inhibition was significantly enhanced when docetaxel was administrated before intratumor injection of PRRA. In vivo dual-photon microscopy and ex vivo fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry showed that docetaxel increased transgene expression and expanded virus distribution. The combination of docetaxel and PRRA also increased cell apoptosis. In vitro, docetaxel significantly increased cell killing in PRRA-treated PCa cells. Docetaxel significantly increased Ad-mediated trangene expression independent of Ad binding receptors and replication capability. Docetaxel increased the activity of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter but not of a chimeric prostate-specific enhancer, resulting in higher transgene expression. The enhanced CMV promoter activity resulted from activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) because inhibition of p38 MAPK blocked the docetaxel-induced increase in CMV promoter activity.

Meta-analysis showed large between-dataset heterogeneity that was driven by different effects in prostate cancer and other cancers.

Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to screen ETS rearrangement-negative prostate cancers for targetable gene fusions and identified the SLC45A3-BRAF (solute carrier family 45, member 3-v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) and ESRP1-RAF1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein-1-v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog-1) gene fusions. Expression of SLC45A3-BRAF or ESRP1-RAF1 in prostate cells induced a neoplastic phenotype that was sensitive to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K1) inhibitors. Screening a large cohort of patients, we found that, although rare, recurrent rearrangements in the RAF pathway tend to occur in advanced prostate cancers, gastric cancers and melanoma. Taken together, our results emphasize the key role of RAF family gene rearrangements in cancer, suggest that RAF and MEK inhibitors may be useful in a subset of gene fusion-harboring solid tumors and demonstrate that sequencing of tumor transcriptomes and genomes may lead to the identification of rare targetable fusions across cancer types.""","""['Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Bushra Ateeq', 'Shanker Kalyana-Sundaram', 'Dorothee Pflueger', 'Kalpana Ramnarayanan', 'Sunita Shankar', 'Bo Han', 'Qi Cao', 'Xuhong Cao', 'Khalid Suleman', 'Chandan Kumar-Sinha', 'Saravana M Dhanasekaran', 'Ying-bei Chen', 'Raquel Esgueva', 'Samprit Banerjee', 'Christopher J LaFargue', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Francesca Demichelis', 'Peter Moeller', 'Tarek A Bismar', 'Rainer Kuefer', 'Douglas R Fullen', 'Timothy M Johnson', 'Joel K Greenson', 'Thomas J Giordano', 'Patrick Tan', 'Scott A Tomlins', 'Sooryanarayana Varambally', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Christopher A Maher', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Nat Med""","""['RAF translocations expand cancer targets.', 'Prostate cancer: Gene fusions.', 'Targetable BRAF and RAF1 Alterations in Advanced Pediatric Cancers.', 'Identification of frequent BRAF copy number gain and alterations of RAF genes in Chinese prostate cancer.', 'A fluorescence in situ hybridization screen for E26 transformation-specific aberrations: identification of DDX5-ETV4 fusion protein in prostate cancer.', 'Landscape of gene fusions in epithelial cancers: seq and ye shall find.', 'The discovery of common recurrent transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-erythroblastosis virus E26 transforming sequence (ETS) gene fusions in prostate cancer: significance and clinical implications.', 'MTAP-ANRIL gene fusion promotes melanoma epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like process by activating the JNK and p38 signaling pathways.', 'A phase I trial of riluzole and sorafenib in patients with advanced solid tumors: CTEP #8850.', 'Rapid response to monotherapy with MEK inhibitor trametinib for a lung adenocarcinoma patient harboring primary SDN1-BRAF fusion: A case report and literature review.', 'Unearthing novel fusions as therapeutic targets in solid tumors using targeted RNA sequencing.', 'MEK inhibitor sensitivity in BRAF fusion-driven prostate cancer.']"""

Similarly, alterations in circadian rhythms have also been associated with the aging population and cancer risk. The pineal hormone melatonin is known to regulate circadian rhythms, which is under the control of a core set of genes: Period 1, 2, 3 (Per 1-3); Cryptochrome 1, 2 (Cry 1, 2); Clock, and Bmal 1, 2. Melatonin levels have been shown to decrease in patients with cancer and exogenous melatonin exhibits antiproliferative effects against certain cancers. In this study, we challenged the hypothesis that melatonin imparts antiproliferative effects in prostate cancer via resynchronization of deregulated core clock circuitry. We found that Clock and Per2 protein levels were downregulated whereas Bmal1 protein levels were upregulated in PCa cells, compared to normal prostate cells. Additionally, employing automated quantitative analysis of a microarray containing human tissues, we found that compared to benign tissues, Clock and Per2 levels were downregulated, whereas Bmal1 levels were upregulated in PCa and other proliferative prostatic conditions. Overexpression of Per2 was found to result in a significant loss of PCa cell growth and viability. Interestingly, melatonin treatment resulted in an increase in Per2 and Clock and a reduction in Bmal1 in PCa cells. Further, melatonin treatment resulted in a resynchronization of oscillatory circadian rhythm genes (Dbp and Per2). Our data support our hypothesis and suggest that melatonin should be thoroughly investigated as an agent for the management of PCa and other age-related malignancies.""","""['Brittney Jung-Hynes', 'Wei Huang', 'Russel J Reiter', 'Nihal Ahmad']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Pineal Res""","""['Alterations of circadian clockworks during differentiation and apoptosis of rat ovarian cells.', 'Synchronization of circadian Per2 rhythms and HSF1-BMAL1:CLOCK interaction in mouse fibroblasts after short-term heat shock pulse.', ""Daily rhythms of serotonin metabolism and the expression of clock genes in suprachiasmatic nucleus of rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease male Wistar rat model and effect of melatonin administration."", 'The roles of clock genes in obesity.', 'Melatonin feedback on clock genes: a theory involving the proteasome.', ""The Melatonin-Mitochondrial Axis: Engaging the Repercussions of Ultraviolet Radiation Photoaging on the Skin's Circadian Rhythm."", 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'Role of Melatonin in Cancer: Effect on Clock Genes.', 'Circadian disruption and cancer- and treatment-related symptoms.', 'Circadian rhythm-related factors of PER and CRY family genes function as novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers in lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

Recent studies indicate that MCM7 genome encodes a putative 'super-oncogene' cluster including MCM7 oncogene and a miRNA cluster that knocks down the expression of several critical tumor-suppressor genes. In this study, we constructed a vector that constitutively expresses small interference RNA (siRNA) specific for MCM7. Introduction of this vector into prostate cancer cell lines PC3 or Du145 decreases the expression of MCM7 by 80%. The vector inhibits DNA synthesis and generates growth arrest of these cancer cells. Severe combined immunodeficient mice were xenografted PC3 or Du145 tumors, and subsequently treated with this vector through tail vein injection with polyethylenimine. The animals had dramatically smaller tumor volume, less metastasis and better survival rate in comparison with the controls.

(123)I-PD153035 was synthesized by a non-isotopic [(123)I]iodo-debromination of PD153035 in 50-60% radiochemical yield in a total synthesis time including HPLC separation of 70 min. In vitro (123)I-mAb425 and (123)I-PD153035 accumulated highly in human PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Radioactivity incorporation into PC-3 and DU-145 tumor cells following 15-min incubation at 37 degrees C varied from 25% to 48% of the total loaded activity per 10(6) tumor cells (560-1230 cpm/1000 cells). In comparison, the uptake of the EGFR-affine probes into LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells was significantly low (105 +/- 25 cpm/1000 cells). Inhibition experiments revealed that (123)I-mAb425 is taken up into tumor cells via the same pathway as the naturally occurring epidermal growth factor (EGF), while (123)I-PD153035 accumulation in prostate cancer cells occurs presumably via the same pathway as the selective EGFR-Tyrosine kinase antagonist AG1418. In vivo, the human prostate cancer xenografts in mouse war accurately visualized after i.v. administration of (123)I-mAb425 by a gamma camera.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that (123)I-mAb425 and (123)I-PD153035 are promising candidates as imaging probes for EGFR-positive prostate cancer and warrant further in vivo validations to ascertain their potential as imaging agents for clinical used.""","""['Thierry Fozing', 'Claudia Scheuer', 'Samuel Samnick']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Predictive efficacy of (11)C-PD153035 PET imaging for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer patients.', 'Metabolism of epidermal growth factor receptor targeting probe 11CPD153035: impact on biodistribution and tumor uptake in rats.', 'Evaluation of radioiodinated quinazoline derivative as a new ligand for EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity using SPECT.', 'O-11C-methyl4-N-(3-Bromoanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline.', 'Experimental results and related clinical implications of PET detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) in cancer.', 'Novel single-domain antibodies against the EGFR domain III epitope exhibit the anti-tumor effect.']"""

Methods:   From June 2004 to July 2006, patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, a PSA level of >or=4 ng/mL, and a maximal flow rate of <15 mL/s received tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily for 2 months. They were then scheduled for 12-core prostate biopsy. PSA determination and a uroflow study were performed before biopsy.  Results:   A total of 80 patients completed the present study. The mean patient age was 66.3 years, and the mean PSA level was 7.8 +/- 8.4 ng/mL at baseline and 7.1 +/- 9.1 ng/mL after treatment (P < .001). A total of 29 patients (36.25%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer from the biopsy findings.

We compared daily prostate motion in 2 cohorts of patients with fiducial markers implanted in the prostate, one group with the ERB and the other without. Twenty-nine patients were treated using intensity-modulated radiation therapy: 14 with an ERB, and 15 without. All had fiducial markers placed in the prostate. We reviewed the daily displacements necessary to place the isocenter on the prostate as determined by portal imaging. In addition, we used the data to determine whether there is a change in prostate motion over the treatment course. The average prostate displacement for patients treated without an ERB was slightly greater than the average displacement for patients treated with the ERB. However, the difference observed with the ERB was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The margins necessary to encompass the prostate 95% of the time for the patients treated without an ERB in the lateral, cranio/caudal, and anterior/posterior dimensions would be 4.8, 12.1, and 15.2 mm, respectively. When using the ERB, the margins necessary would be 4.1, 10.4, and 11 mm, respectively. Prostate motion in the anterior-posterior direction actually increased over the course of treatment in patients without an ERB. This increase was prevented by use of the ERB.

Two C4-ECAMs were verified to be MRI visible in a phantom before radiation exposure. The C4-ECAMs were then attached to each end of a 12.7-U (10-mCi) I-125 titanium seed in a polymer tube. Anisotropy was measured and analyzed with the seed alone and with attached C4-ECAMs by suspending thermoluminescent dosimeters in a water phantom in 2 circles surrounding the radioactive source with radius of 1 or 2 cm. A T1-weighted MRI evaluation of C4-ECAMs was then performed after exposure to the amount of radiation typically delivered during 1 month of prostate brachytherapy. Measured values of the anisotropy function F(r, θ) for the I-125 seed with and without the C4-ECAMs were mutually statistically indistinguishable (standard error of the mean <4.2%) and agreed well with published TG-43 values for the bare seed. As expected, the anisotropy function ϕ(an)(r) for the 2 datasets (with and without C4-ECAMs) derived from the measured F(r, θ) did not exhibit statistically measurable difference. Both datasets showed agreement with the published TG-43 ϕ(an)(r) for the bare seed. The C4-ECAMs were well visualized by MRI after 1 month of radiation exposure.

The chemopreventive targeting of this tumor could accordingly delay its malignancy over life expectancy. The cancer chemopreventive retinoid N-(4 hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR) has already been shown to restrain prostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo, though its mechanisms of action are only partially explained.  Results:   We found that 4HPR impairs DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells migration and invasion by down-regulating FAK and AKT activation and by enhancing beta-catenin degradation, causing the downregulation of target genes like cyclin D1, survivin and VEGF. This non-migratory phenotype was similarly produced in both cell lines by stable silencing of beta-catenin. 4HPR was able to decrease AKT phosphorylation also when powerfully upregulated by IGF-1 and, consequently, to impair IGF-1-stimulated cell motility. Conversely, the expression of constitutively active AKT (myr-AKT) overcame the effects of 4HPR and beta-catenin-silencing on cell migration. In addition, we found that BMP-2, a 4HPR target with antiangiogenic activity, decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion by down-regulating the pathway described involving AKT phosphorylation, beta-catenin stability and cyclin D1 expression.  Conclusion:   These data point to 4HPR as a negative regulator of AKT phosphorylation, effectively targeting the beta-catenin pathway and inducing a relatively benign phenotype in prostate cancer cells, limiting neoangiogenesis and cell invasion.""","""['Roberto Benelli', 'Stefano Monteghirfo', 'Roberta Venè', 'Francesca Tosetti', 'Nicoletta Ferrari']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Embelin-Induced Apoptosis of Human Prostate Cancer Cells Is Mediated through Modulation of Akt and β-Catenin Signaling.', 'Involvement of mitochondrial and Akt signaling pathways in augmented apoptosis induced by a combination of low doses of celecoxib and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide in premalignant human bronchial epithelial cells.', 'Inhibition of IGF-1 signaling by genistein: modulation of E-cadherin expression and downregulation of β-catenin signaling in hormone refractory PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Knockdown of lncRNA MIR4435‑2HG and ST8SIA1\xa0expression inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells in\xa0vitro and in\xa0vivo by blocking the\xa0activation of the FAK/AKT/β‑catenin signaling pathway.', 'LQB-118 Suppresses Migration and Invasion of Prostate Cancer Cells by Modulating the Akt/GSK3β Pathway and MMP-9/Reck Gene Expression.', 'Ivermectin inhibits tumor metastasis by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin/integrin β1/FAK signaling pathway.', 'FAM107A Inactivation Associated with Promoter Methylation Affects Prostate Cancer Progression through the FAK/PI3K/AKT Pathway.', 'Identification of a Prognosis-Related Risk Signature for Bladder Cancer to Predict Survival and Immune Landscapes.', 'Synthetic Retinoids as Potential Therapeutics in Prostate Cancer-An Update of the Last Decade of Research: A Review.', 'Ginsenoside Rg1-Notoginsenoside R1-Protocatechuic Aldehyde Reduces Atherosclerosis and Attenuates Low-Shear Stress-Induced Vascular Endothelial Cell Dysfunction.']"""

We investigated the relationship between age at diagnosis, clinical stage, pathological differentiation, initial PSA, the value of PSA nadir, duration between diagnosis and initiation of estrogen therapy, duration between PSA failure and initiation of estrogen therapy, the value of PSA at estrogen therapy, PSA doubling time (PSA-DT) at estrogen therapy, PSA response three months after initiation of estrogen therapy, use of diethylstilbestrol diphosphate (DES-P) at the initial stage of therapy, local radiotherapy to prostate, type of estrogen and prognosis after estrogen therapy.  Results:   In Kaplan-Meier method, factors which showed poorer prognosis were stage B and D, poorly differentiated, PSA 11.9 ng/ml or higher at estrogen therapy, PSA-DT shorter than 2.3 months before estrogen therapy and PSA response without CR three months after initiation of estrogen therapy. In multivariate analysis, the factor that most significantly affected prognosis after estrogen therapy was PSA response three months after initiation of estrogen therapy (hazard ratio: 12.61), followed by PSA-DT at estrogen therapy (hazard ratio: 2.59).  Conclusion:   We investigated the prognostic factors refractory to MAB and treated with estrogen. These results are useful in planning the therapy, and in explaining the status or future prospective of the disease to families and patients.""","""['Seiji Nakata', 'Yoshiyuki Miyazawa', 'Yasushi Sasaki', 'Katsuya Nakano', 'Hirotomo Takahashi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""['Prognostic factors for PSA relapse of prostate cancer after endocrine therapy.', 'Clinical study on poor PSA response to initial endocrine therapy with MAB or estrogenic drugs for treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic importance of prostate specific antigen in patients with hormonally treated stage D2 prostate carcinoma.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'Hormone refractory disease.', 'MR imaging of treated prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study was performed on 332 men with serum tPSA level of 4 to 20 ng/mL. All patients underwent transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies. Serum levels of tPSA and fPSA were measured by Roche immunoassay Elecsys 2010. Relationship between f/tPSA and cases of PCa was determined.  Results:   Prostate cancer detected in 49 (15%) patients. Incidence of PCa for serum tPSA level < 10 ng/mL and serum tPSA level of 10.1 to 20 ng/ mL was 17 (6.7%) and 32 (39.5%), respectively. Mean f/tPSA value was significantly lower in PCa patients (0.12 +/- 0.01) than in benign histology group (0.16 +/- 0.03). Among patients with serum PSA level of 4 to 10 ng/mL (n = 251), mean f/tPSA in benign histology group (n = 234) was 0.16 +/- 0.08 and in PCa group (n = 17) was 0.13 +/- 0.06 (P < .05). For serum PSA level of 10.1 to 20 ng/mL (n = 81), mean f/tPSA in benign histology group (n = 49) was 0.16 +/- 0.08 and in PCa group (n = 32) was 0.12 +/- 0.05 (P < .05). The cut-off value of 0.12 produced 76% sensitivity and 71% specificity, whereas the cut-off value of 0.14 yielded 83.5% sensitivity and 61% specificity.

In prostate carcinomas, BAG3 showed a progressive decrease of the expression level from well- to low-differentiated carcinoma, coupled with the loss of polarisation of the signal in metastasizing cases.

A long-standing hypothesis has been that inherited variation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene plays a role in prostate cancer initiation. However, studies to date have been inconclusive and often suffered from small sample sizes.  Objective and methods:   We investigated the association of AR sequence variants with circulating sex hormone levels and prostate cancer risk in 6058 prostate cancer cases and 6725 controls of Caucasian origin within the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium. We genotyped a highly polymorphic CAG microsatellite in exon 1 and six haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms and tested each genetic variant for association with prostate cancer risk and with sex steroid levels.  Results:   We observed no association between AR genetic variants and prostate cancer risk. However, there was a strong association between longer CAG repeats and higher levels of testosterone (P = 4.73 x 10(-5)) and estradiol (P = 0.0002), although the amount of variance explained was small (0.4 and 0.7%, respectively).  Conclusions:   This study is the largest to date investigating AR sequence variants, sex steroid levels, and prostate cancer risk.

CRPC continues to be driven by testosterone or dihydrotestosterone from intratumoral metabolism of 19-carbon adrenal steroids from circulation, and/or de novo intratumoral steroidogenesis. Both mechanisms require 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3betaHSD) metabolism of Delta(5)-steroids, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and Delta(5)-androstenediol (A5diol), to testosterone. In contrast, reports that DHEA and A5diol directly activate the androgen receptor (AR) suggest that 3betaHSD metabolism is not required and that 3betaHSD inhibitors would be ineffective in the treatment of CRPC. We hypothesized that activation of AR in prostate cancer by DHEA and A5diol requires their conversion via 3betaHSD to androstenedione and testosterone, respectively. Here, we show that DHEA and A5diol induce AR chromatin occupancy and AR-regulated genes. Furthermore, we show that Delta(5)-androgens undergo 3beta-dehydrogenation in prostate cancer and that induction of AR nuclear translocation, AR chromatin occupancy, transcription of PSA, TMPRSS2, and FKBP5, as well as cell proliferation by DHEA and A5diol, are all blocked by inhibitors of 3betaHSD. These findings demonstrate that DHEA and A5diol must be metabolized by 3betaHSD to activate AR in these models of CRPC. Furthermore, this work suggests that 3betaHSD may be exploited as a pharmacologic target in the treatment of CRPC.""","""['Kristen Evaul', 'Rui Li', 'Mahboubeh Papari-Zareei', 'Richard J Auchus', 'Nima Sharifi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Abiraterone inhibits 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase: a rationale for increasing drug exposure in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'New agents and strategies for the hormonal treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Intratumoral de novo steroid synthesis activates androgen receptor in castration-resistant prostate cancer and is upregulated by treatment with CYP17A1 inhibitors.', 'Identification of EP4 as a potential target for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer using a novel xenograft model.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'BMX controls 3βHSD1 and sex steroid biosynthesis in cancer.', 'Adrenal Steroids and Resistance to Hormonal Blockade of Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Characterization of prostate cancer adrenal metastases: dependence upon androgen receptor signaling and steroid hormones.', 'Role of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the HSD3B1 gene (rs6203 and rs33937873) in the prediction of prostate cancer risk.']"""

Methods:   One hundred and thirty-four patients that fit a selection condition similar to the so-called Hopkins' criteria were enrolled into the present study between January 2002 and December 2003. Patients were recommended to start curable treatment when they showed prostate-specific antigen-doubling time of 2 years or shorter or pathological progression at 1-year re-biopsy. Median observation period was 61 months.  Results:   Fourteen patients underwent radical prostatectomy immediately after enrollment (Group A) whereas 28 patients underwent radical prostatectomy after substantial periods of active surveillance (Group B). Of the 28 Group B, trigger of radical prostatectomy was on protocol in 17 patients (Group B1) whereas 11 patients underwent radical prostatectomy by their preference (Group B2).

Identification of novel low abundance biomarkers that are indicative of early-stage events that likely exist in the sub-nanogram per milliliter concentration range of known markers, such as prostate-specific antigen, cannot be readily detected by current MS technologies. We have developed a new nanoparticle technology that can, in one step, capture, concentrate, and separate the peptidome from high-abundance blood proteins. Herein, we describe an initial pilot study whereby the peptidome content of ovarian and prostate cancer patients is investigated with this method. Differentially abundant candidate peptidome biomarkers that appear to be specific for early-stage ovarian and prostate cancer have been identified and reveal the potential utility for this new methodology.""","""['Claudia Fredolini', 'Francesco Meani', 'Alessandra Luchini', 'Weidong Zhou', 'Paul Russo', 'Mark Ross', 'Alexis Patanarut', 'Davide Tamburro', 'Guido Gambara', 'David Ornstein', 'Franco Odicino', 'Monica Ragnoli', 'Antonella Ravaggi', 'Francesco Novelli', 'Devis Collura', ""Leonardo D'Urso"", 'Giovanni Muto', 'Claudio Belluco', 'Sergio Pecorelli', 'Lance Liotta', 'Emanuel F Petricoin rd']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""AAPS J""","""['A comprehensive peptidome profiling technology for the identification of early detection biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Profiling signatures of ovarian cancer tumour suppression using 2D-DIGE and 2D-LC-MS/MS with tandem mass tagging.', 'The blood peptidome: a higher dimension of information content for cancer biomarker discovery.', 'Comprehensive proteome analysis of ovarian cancers using liquid phase separation, mass mapping and tandem mass spectrometry: a strategy for identification of candidate cancer biomarkers.', 'Proteomic approaches to biomarker discovery in prostate and bladder cancers.', 'Nano-omics: nanotechnology-based multidimensional harvesting of the blood-circulating cancerome.', 'Applications of Proteomics in Ovarian Cancer: Dawn of a New Era.', 'Nanoproteomic Approach for Isolation and Identification of Potential Biomarkers in Human Urine from Adults with Normal Weight, Overweight and Obesity.', 'Shotgun proteomics coupled to nanoparticle-based biomarker enrichment reveals a novel panel of extracellular matrix proteins as candidate serum protein biomarkers for early-stage breast cancer detection.', 'Application of Nanotechnology in Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy - A Mini-Review.']"""

However, there are major differences in the histologic architecture of the stromal and epithelial elements between the mouse and human mammary glands. The rat mammary gland is more enriched with epithelial and stromal components than the mouse and more closely resembles the cellular composition of the human gland. Additionally, existing rat models of mammary cancer are typically estrogen receptor positive and hormone responsive, unlike most genetically engineered mouse mammary cancer models. In an attempt to develop a mammary cancer model that might more closely resemble the pathology of human breast cancer, we generated a novel C3(1)/SV40 T/t-antigen transgenic rat model that developed progressive mammary lesions leading to highly invasive adenocarcinomas. However, aggressive tumor development prevented the establishment of transgenic lines. Characterization of the tumors revealed that they were primarily estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative, and either her2/neu positive or negative, resembling human triple-negative or Her2 positive breast cancer. Tumors expressed the basal marker K14, as well as the luminal marker K18, and were negative for smooth muscle actin. The triple negative phenotype has not been previously reported in a rat mammary cancer model.

Peripheral blood samples taken from 12 PCa patients with locally advanced tumor before, during, and after hypofractionated RT were analyzed for T cell phenotype and function. There was significantly more loss of naive and early memory compared with more differentiated T cells during RT. The proportions of annexin-V(+) and Fas-expressing T cells were elevated in patients during RT and in PBMC irradiated in vitro (< or = 5.0 Gy), with preferential increases in CD45RA(+) T cells. The baseline level of apoptosis of CD45RA(-) T cells increased > 2-fold in the presence of an IkappaB-kinase inhibitor, indicating a protective effect via this pathway. T cell proliferation was impaired during RT with IL-2-dependent recovery post-RT. Recall T cell responses to common viral Ags, measured by IFN-gamma production, were little affected by RT. In vitro irradiation of healthy donor PBMCs resulted in a significantly increased frequency of responding T cells, due at least partly to the preferential elimination of CD45RA(+) T cells. Most importantly, antitumor CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses were detectable after, but not before or during RT. The results indicate that generating tumor-specific T cell responses before RT and boosting their activity post-RT are ways likely to amplify the frequency and function of antitumor T cells, with implications for scheduling immunotherapy in PCa.""","""['Zsuzsanna Tabi', 'Lisa K Spary', 'Sharon Coleman', 'Aled Clayton', 'Malcolm D Mason', 'John Staffurth']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Immunol""","""['Interleukin-13 is produced by activated human CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T cells: modulation by interleukin-4 and interleukin-12.', 'Association between the HLA haplotype and the TCR-Vbeta repertoire of anti-hCMV specific memory T-cells in immunocompetent healthy adults.', 'Human in vivo-activated CD45R0(+) CD4(+) T cells are susceptible to spontaneous apoptosis that can be inhibited by the chemokine CXCL12 and IL-2, -6, -7, and -15.', 'Spontaneous apoptosis of circulating T lymphocytes in patients with head and neck cancer and its clinical importance.', 'Human primary adenotonsillar naïve phenotype CD45RA CD4 T lymphocytes undergo apoptosis upon stimulation with a high concentration of CD3 antibody.', 'Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy in 3 Fractions Induces a Favorable Systemic Immune Cell Profiling in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Nanoparticles augment the therapeutic window of RT and immunotherapy for treating cancers: pivotal role of autophagy.', 'Abscopal effect in the radio and immunotherapy.', 'Interaction Between Modern Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Circulating Lymphocyte Counts Early During Radiation Therapy Are Associated With Recurrence in Pediatric Medulloblastoma.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the function of ADAMTS1 in prostate tumors.  Methods:   ADAMTS1 was downregulated by shRNA technology in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (androgen-dependent), originally expressing ADAMTS1, and was upregulated by transfection in its subline LNCaP-19 (androgen-independent), expressing low levels of ADAMTS1. Cells were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice and tumor growth, microvessel density (MVD), blood vessel morphology, pericyte coverage and thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) were studied in the tumor xenografts.  Results:   Modified expression of ADAMTS1 resulted in altered blood vessel morphology in the tumors. Low expression levels of ADAMTS1 were associated with small diameter blood vessels both in LNCaP and LNCaP-19 tumors, while high levels of ADAMTS1 were associated with larger vessels. In addition, TSP1 levels in the tumor xenografts were inversely related to ADAMTS1 expression. MVD and pericyte coverage were not affected. Moreover, upregulation of ADAMTS1 inhibited tumor growth of LNCaP-19, as evidenced by delayed tumor establishment. In contrast, downregulation of ADAMTS1 in LNCaP resulted in reduced tumor growth rate.  Conclusions:   The present study demonstrates that ADAMTS1 is an important regulatory factor of angiogenesis and tumor growth in prostate tumors, where modified ADAMTS1 expression resulted in markedly changed blood vessel morphology, possibly related to altered TSP1 levels.""","""['Heléne Gustavsson', 'Tajana Tesan', 'Karin Jennbacken', 'Kouji Kuno', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Karin Welén']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Altered expression of genes regulating angiogenesis in experimental androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'The prostatic environment suppresses growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer xenografts: an effect influenced by testosterone.', 'Variable inhibition of thrombospondin 1 against liver and lung metastases through differential activation of metalloproteinase ADAMTS1.', 'Androgens repress the expression of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 in normal and neoplastic prostate.', 'The metalloproteinase ADAMTS1: a comprehensive review of its role in tumorigenic and metastatic pathways.', 'The Role of the Metzincin Superfamily in Prostate Cancer Progression: A Systematic-Like Review.', 'Discovering pathways in benign prostate hyperplasia: A functional genomics pilot study.', 'ADAMTS-1 and syndecan-4 intersect in the regulation of cell migration and angiogenesis.', 'Relationship between thrombospondin-1 and the occurrence and development of oral and maxillofacial malignancy.', 'The Combination of Metformin and Valproic Acid Has a Greater Anti-tumoral Effect on Prostate Cancer Growth In Vivo than Either Drug Alone.']"""

Methods:   Medical records of 491 patients who underwent RP from 2004 to 2007 were retrieved from our institutional database. Patients were divided into three groups based on their body mass index (BMI): <25, 25-30 (overweight) and >30 kg/m (obese). Outcomes after RP were compared between the groups in terms of length of stay, perioperative complications, BCR, PSM and Gleason scores.  Results:   Age, stage and preoperative prostate-specific antigen were similar between BMI categories. Operating time was prolonged in obese patients (146 vs 135 min, P = 0.01) and blood loss was greater (mean estimated blood loss 640 vs 504 mL, P = 0.02), but did not translate into higher transfusion rates. Early complication rates, PSM rates and Gleason scores were not statistically different between the groups. Significant differences in late outcomes, such as the need for adjunct procedures or BCR (hazard ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.18-1.09), were not shown.

We now report that human GH (hGH) can stimulate/modulate insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and β-oestradiol (E(2) ) receptor (ER(β) ) gene expressions in these cells and interact with IGF-I and E(2) to stimulate androgen-dependent LNCaP cell proliferation. We observed a cell type-dependent, differential regulation of IGF axis gene expression by GH: IGF-I was stimulated in the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells; IGF-II was stimulated in androgen-insensitive (AI) PC3 cells; the IGF-I cognate receptor, IGF-IR, was stimulated in LNCaP cells, but inhibited in PC3 cells; IGF-IIR was stimulated in both LNCaP and PC3 cells. GH also stimulated ER(β) gene expression in LNCaP and PC3 cells, but had little or no effect on any of those genes in AI DU145 cells. The potent androgen analogue, mibolerone, also stimulated IGF-I, IGF-IR and ER(β) , but reduced IGF-IIR mRNAs in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, triiodothyronine (T(3) ) and E(2) also stimulated the expression of those four genes in LNCaP cells, but co-administration of GH had almost no effect. Finally, we also studied the effects of GH, IGF-I and E(2) , alone or in combination, on LNCaP cell proliferation. Importantly, we demonstrated, for the first time, that although GH and IGF-I alone had no effect on LNCaP cell proliferation, concomitant administration for 96 h revealed a permissive role of GH on IGF-I-induced proliferation. GH also appeared to exert a synergistic effect on E(2) -stimulated LNCaP cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings indicate that GH via GHRs, most likely in concert with gonadal steroids, T(3) , IGF system axis and probably other hormones and growth factors, potentially plays an important role in the mechanisms underlying tumour cell growth in PCa.""","""['M Bidosee', 'R Karry', 'E Weiss-Messer', 'R J Barkey']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Androl""","""['Regulation of growth hormone receptors in human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Growth hormone (GH) receptors in prostate cancer: gene expression in human tissues and cell lines and characterization, GH signaling and androgen receptor regulation in LNCaP cells.', 'Comparative effects of DHEA vs. testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol on proliferation and gene expression in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Patterns of insulin-like growth factor and IGF receptor gene expression in the brain.

The sustained decrease in number of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells for 3 days secondary to the four hormones noted previously suggests a decrease in proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells not eliminated after initial treatment.  Materials and methods:   Four cardiac hormones were evaluated for their ability to directly decrease proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells with comparison of their effects on proliferation on normal human lung, kidney, prostate and endothelial cells.  Results:   ANP, LANP, vessel dilator and KP decreased the proliferation of viable human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells by 39%, 73%, 26% and 32% respectively at their 0.01 microM concentrations compared with the proliferation of untreated pancreatic cancer cells. Maximal inhibition of proliferation (81%) occurred with LANP at its 0.1 microM concentration in dose-response studies. At these same concentrations, there was no decrease in proliferation of human kidney, lung, prostate or endothelial cells compared with untreated kidney, lung, prostate or endothelial cells.  Conclusion:   Four cardiac hormones have strong anti-proliferative effects on human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells while sparing human kidney, lung, prostate and endothelial cells from a similar strong anti-proliferative effect.

Changes in tumor behavior, treatment response, and related signaling in HR were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that constitutional activation of STAT3 and overexpressions of DNMT1 were important in the transition of HR prostate cancer. Furthermore, DNMT1 expression was required for the maintenance of STAT3 activation. When DNMT1 activity in HR was blocked, aggressive tumor behavior and treatment resistance could be overcome, which was seen in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The underlying changes associated with inhibited DNMT1 included less epithelial-mesenchymal changes, less invasion ability, slower tumor growth, and impaired DNA repair ability, which are independent of AR and p53 status. In conclusion, altered DNMT1 expression associated with activated STAT3 may be crucial in the transition of HR. Targeting DNMT1 could be a promising strategy for the treatment of HR prostate, as evidenced by inhibited tumor growth and enhanced radiosensitivity. These findings provide evidence for therapeutically targeting DNMT1 in HR prostate cancer.""","""['Miao-Fen Chen', 'Wen-Cheng Chen', 'Yu-Jia Chang', 'Ching-Fang Wu', 'Chun-Te Wu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Mol Med (Berl)""","""['Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Significance of IL-6 in the transition of hormone-resistant prostate cancer and the induction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.', 'The radiation response of hormone-resistant prostate cancer induced by long-term hormone therapy.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) expression in prostate cancer and progression of the tumor: Lessons from cell lines, animal models and human specimens.', 'Drug resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an update on the status quo.', 'The Interplay Between Prostate Cancer Genomics, Metabolism, and the Epigenome: Perspectives and Future Prospects.', 'Role of JAK/STAT3 Signaling in the Regulation of Metastasis, the Transition of Cancer Stem Cells, and Chemoresistance of Cancer by Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Sarcosine is a prostate epigenetic modifier that elicits aberrant methylation patterns through the SAMe-Dnmts axis.', 'Molecular and cellular mechanisms of castration resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 25 PC patients with biochemical failure (mean PSA value 11.1 ng/mL; median value 6.3 ng/mL; range 0.2-37.7 ng/mL) after primary treatment were included in this retrospective study. All of them showed a single lesion on BS reported as suspected for metastatic lesion or as equivocal finding. Patients underwent (11)C-choline PET/CT within 1-4 months from BS. Validation was established by follow-up for at least 6 months.  Results:   On the basis of biopsy confirmation and/or 6-month follow-up, 22 of 25 patients were classified as positive for the presence of metastatic bone lesions: 13 with a single lesion and 9 with multiple lesions. (11)C-choline PET/CT was positive in 19/25 patients and, on a lesion basis, it showed 50 positive findings. BS results were confirmed in 8/25 (32%) patients.

Finally, 6/25 patients were negative on (11)C-choline PET/CT. In 3/6 patients, an osteoblastic lesion was seen on CT attenuation correction images (PET false negative; BS true positive), while in 3/6 patients only findings suggestive of the presence of degenerative disease were found (PET true negative; BS false positive).

Our aim was to conduct a contemporary survey of urologist's practice patterns toward PC detection, specifically focusing on factors determining the decision to recommend ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS-BX).  Methods:   Three hundred and sixty active urologists from the Canadian Urological Association were requested to complete an online questionnaire focusing on scenarios of varying age, family history, ethnicity and PSA. Urologists indicated when to TRUS-BX.  Results:   Of 360 urologists, 125 (35%) completed the questionnaire. Sixty-seven percent indicated men should be screened for PC aged 50-60 with 27% preferring 40-50 years. Seventy-seven percent would continue screening >75. Considering a 65-year-old man with no risk factors and a normal digital rectal exam 56% would offer TRUS-BX at PSA 4.5; 35% at 3.5 and 10% at 2.5 ng/ml. Considering a similar 45-year-old man, 94% would at PSA 4.5; 77% at 3.5 and 33% at 2.5 ng/ml. On multivariate analysis, offering TRUS-BX appears driven significantly (P < 0.0001) more by younger age and higher PSA (OR 4.3-20.6 and 4.4-34.9, respectively) rather than family history or ethnicity (OR 3.3 and 1.8, respectively).  Conclusions:   Age and PSA appear the driving factors in obtaining TRUS-BX. Also, a significant proportion of urologists would still not offer TRUS-BX at the traditional PSA cutoff of 4 ng/ml for men with no risk factors.

We tried to clarify whether injection pain was reduced by icing the skin at the injection site.  Methods:   Pain associated with the injection of goserelin acetate was prospectively evaluated in 48 patients who had received an 10.8-mg goserelin injection at least once previously. In this study, the first injection was administered by usual methods, and 3 months later a second injection was administered after icing the skin at the injection site. Pain intensity was evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score.  Results:   VAS pain scores for the usual injection method were 32.4 ± 21.7 mm [mean ± 2 standard deviation (SD)] and was significantly lower (16.4 ± 17.9) for the icing method (p = 0.001, paired t test). Thirty-three (68.8%), eight (16.7%), and seven (14.6%) of the 48 patients reported a decrease, no change, and increase, respectively, in VAS pain score by the icing method.

Subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that overexpression of CRMP4 not only suppressed the invasion ability of PCa cells, but also strongly inhibited tumor metastasis in an animal model.

However, CBCT image quality is limited by low contrast and imaging artifacts. This analysis investigates the detectability of soft tissue boundaries in CBCT by performing a multiple-observer segmentation study.  Methods and materials:   In four prostate cancer patients prostate, bladder and rectum were repeatedly delineated by five observers on CBCTs and fan-beam CTs (FBCTs). A volumetric analysis of contouring variations was performed by calculating coefficients of variation (COV: standard deviation/average volume). The topographical distribution of contouring variations was analyzed using an average surface mesh-based method.  Results:   Observer- and patient-averaged COVs for FBCT/CBCT were 0.09/0.19 for prostate, 0.05/0.08 for bladder, and 0.09/0.08 for rectum. Contouring variations on FBCT were significantly smaller than on CBCT for prostate (p < 0.03) and bladder (p < 0.04), but not for rectum (p < 0.37; intermodality differences). Intraobserver variations from repeated contouring of the same image set were not significant for either FBCT or CBCT (p < 0.05). Average standard deviations of individual observers' contour differences from average surface meshes on FBCT vs. CBCT were 1.5 vs. 2.1 mm for prostate, 0.7 vs. 1.4 mm for bladder, and 1.3 vs. 1.5 mm for rectum. The topographical distribution of contouring variations was similar for FBCT and CBCT.  Conclusion:   Contouring variations were larger on CBCT than FBCT, except for rectum.

LNCaP cells were not sensitized to the induction of apoptosis by PAHs even through inhibition of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pro-survival pathway. The lack of apoptosis was not due a disruption of expression of pro-apoptotic and pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators. In contrast to other genotoxic stimuli, genotoxic PAHs failed to induce DNA double-strand breaks, as illustrated by the lack of phosphorylation of histone H2AX or checkpoint kinase-2. BaP did not activate p53, as evidenced by the lack of p53 accumulation, phosphorylation at Ser15, or induction of p53 transcriptional targets.

A fundamental observation is that the serum testosterone concentration only reflects the amount of testosterone of testicular origin which is released in the blood from which it reaches all tissues. Recent data show, however, that an approximately equal amount of testosterone is made from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) directly in the peripheral tissues, including the prostate, and does not appear in the blood. Consequently, after castration, the 95-97% fall in serum testosterone does not reflect the 40-50% testosterone (testo) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) made locally in the prostate from DHEA of adrenal origin. In fact, while elimination of testicular androgens by castration alone has never been shown to prolong life in metastatic prostate cancer, combination of castration (surgical or medical with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist) with a pure anti-androgen has been the first treatment shown to prolong life. Most importantly, when applied at the localized stage, the same combined androgen blockade (CAB) can provide long-term control or cure of the disease in more than 90% of cases. Obviously, since prostate cancer usually grows and metastasizes without signs or symptoms, screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is absolutely needed to diagnose prostate cancer at an 'early' stage before metastasis occurs and the cancer becomes non-curable. While the role of androgens was believed to have become non-significant in cancer progressing under any form of androgen blockade, recent data have shown increased expression of the androgen receptor (AR) in treatment-resistant disease with a benefit of further androgen blockade.

Cessation of estrogen secretion at menopause eliminates the risks of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer which would result from non-opposed estrogen stimulation during the post-menopausal years. In fact, from the time of menopause, DHEA becomes the exclusive and tissue-specific source of sex steroids for all tissues except the uterus. Intracrinology, a term coined in 1988, describes the local formation, action and inactivation of sex steroids from the inactive sex steroid precursor DHEA. Over the past 25 years most, if not all, the genes encoding the human steroidogenic and steroid-inactivating enzymes have been cloned and sequenced and their enzymatic activity characterized. The problem with DHEA, however, is that its secretion decreases from the age of 30 years and is already decreased, on average, by 60% at time of menopause. In addition, there is a large variability in the circulating levels of DHEA with some post-menopausal women having barely detectable serum concentrations of the steroid while others have normal values. Since there is no feedback mechanism controlling DHEA secretion within 'normal' values, women with low DHEA will remain with such a deficit of sex steroids for their remaining lifetime. Since there is no other significant source of sex steroids after menopause, one can reasonably believe that low DHEA is involved, in association with the aging process, in a series of medical problems classically associated with post-menopause, namely osteoporosis, muscle loss, vaginal atrophy, fat accumulation, hot flashes, skin atrophy, type 2 diabetes, memory loss, cognition loss and possibly Alzheimer's disease. A recent randomized, placebo-controlled study has shown that all the signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy, a classical problem recognized to be due to the hormone deficiency of menopause, can be rapidly improved or corrected by local administration of DHEA without systemic exposure to estrogens. In addition, the four domains of sexual dysfucntion are improved. For the other problems of menopause, although similar large scale, randomized and placebo-controlled studies usually remain to be performed, the available evidence already strongly suggests that they could be improved, corrected or even prevented by exogenous DHEA. In men, the contribution of adrenal DHEA to the total androgen pool has been measured at 40% in 65-75-year-old men. Such data stress the necessity of blocking both the testicular and adrenal sources of androgens in order to achieve optimal benefits in prostate cancer therapy. On the other hand, the comparable decrease in serum DHEA levels observed in both sexes has less consequence in men who continue to receive a practically constant supply of testicular sex steroids during their whole life. In fact, in men, the appearance of hormone-deficiency symptoms common to women is observed at a later age and with a lower degree of severity. Consequently, DHEA replacement has shown much more easily measurable beneficial effects in women. Most importantly, despite the non-scientific and unfortunate availability of DHEA as a food supplement in the United States, a situation that discourages rigorous clinical trials on the crucial physiological and therapeutic role of DHEA, no serious adverse event related to DHEA has ever been reported in the world literature (thousands of subjects exposed) or in the monitoring of adverse events by the FDA (millions of subjects exposed), thus indicating, as expected from its known physiology, the excellent safety profile of DHEA. With today's knowledge, one can reasonably suggest that DHEA offers the promise of a safe and efficient replacement therapy for the multiple problems related to hormone deficiency after menopause without the risks associated with estrogen-based or any other treatments.""","""['Fernand Labrie']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prog Brain Res""","""['All sex steroids are made intracellularly in peripheral tissues by the mechanisms of intracrinology after menopause.', 'DHEA and intracrinology at menopause, a positive choice for evolution of the human species.', 'DHEA and its transformation into androgens and estrogens in peripheral target tissues: intracrinology.', 'Adrenal androgens and intracrinology.', 'Is dehydroepiandrosterone a hormone?', 'Age, adrenal steroids, and cognitive functioning in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).', 'DHEA Protects Human Cholangiocytes and Hepatocytes against Apoptosis and Oxidative Stress.', 'Steroids, steroid associated substances and gestational diabetes mellitus.', 'Endogenous DHEAS Is Causally Linked With Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density and Forearm Fractures in Women.', 'The Therapeutic Intervention of Sex Steroid Hormones for Sarcopenia.']"""

Consequently, interpreting temporal trends in PCa has become difficult, and the impact of changes in exposure to causal factors is uncertain.  Objective:   To reveal geographic differences and temporal trends in PCa in the Nordic countries. Because the recorded incidence of PCa has been profoundly influenced by PSA screening, we focused our analyses primarily on PCa mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed national PCa incidence and mortality data from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden from 1965 to 2006 using the PC-NORDCAN software program and the online NORDCAN database.  Measurements:   Cumulative incidence and cumulative mortality from PCa were calculated for selected calendar years during four decades, along with age-standardized mortality rates. Incidence data in NORDCAN come from individual countries' cancer registries, and mortality data come from national mortality registries.  Results and limitations:   From 1965 to 2006, 172 613 deaths from PCa were reported in the four Nordic countries. A substantial rise in incidence was observed across the region, with some geographic variation, since the late 1980s. In contrast, both disease-specific mortality rates and cumulative risk of PCa mortality lacked consistent temporal trends over the same period. Cumulative mortality from PCa ranged between 3.5% and 7.5% in the region over four decades, whereas cumulative incidence jumped from about 9% to >20%. Mortality has remained fairly constant among the countries, with a minimally lower risk in Finland.  Conclusions:   Unlike most malignancies, the occurrence of lethal PCa showed minimal geographic variation and lacked consistent temporal trends over four decades.

Some guidelines recommend kidney function testing of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia; however, the significance of extending this to general population screening is unclear.  Study design:   Prospective cohort study.  Setting & participants:   30,466 men from the HUNT II (Second Health Study in Nord-Trøndelag; 1995-1997) representing 66.8% of the entire adult male population in Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway.  Predictor:   The International Prostate Symptom Score was used to detect the presence and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a surrogate measure of benign prostate hyperplasia suitable for use in general practice.  Outcomes:   Kidney failure was defined as starting renal replacement therapy or CKD death with a documented stable estimated glomerular filtration rate<15 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Results:   During 10.5 years of follow-up, 78 men developed kidney failure. Kidney failure risks were 2.60 (95% CI, 1.47-4.58) and 4.08 (95% CI, 1.74-9.53) times higher for men with moderate and severe LUTS compared with men with no/mild LUTS, respectively. However, age-stratified analysis showed that the incidence rate ratio for moderate/severe LUTS versus no/mild LUTS was 1.27 (95% CI, 0.76-2.13), and multivariable Cox analysis showed no significant association between LUTS and risk of kidney failure. Screening effectiveness was improved only slightly by including men with moderate/severe LUTS in addition to patients with diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. Better effectiveness was achieved by simply including all men older than 60 years.  Limitations:   The ability of the International Prostate Symptom Score to predict the presence and severity of obstruction is only moderate. Ascertainment of severe CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 30-15 mL/min/1.73 m2) was not possible.

Materials and methods:   We tested time, dose dependent and specific anti-proliferative activity of LE by clonogenic cell survival assay on human cancer and normal epithelial cell lines in vitro.

Results:   LE exhibited time and dose dependent cytotoxicity on several tumor cells. Compared to cancer cells of colon, breast, lung and prostate origin, pancreatic cancer cells were significantly more sensitive to LE. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that LE selectively suppressed the transcription of metalloproteases (MMP-1 and -2), inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP-2) and angiogenic factors (VEGF-A and VEGF-B).

We recently designed and synthesized a RGD-BBN heterodimeric peptide with both RGD and BBN motifs in one single molecule. The (18)F-labeled RGD-BBN heterodimer exhibited dual integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and GRPR targeting in a PC-3 prostate cancer model. In this study we investigated whether radiolabeled RGD-BBN tracers can be used to detect breast cancer by using microPET. Cell binding assay demonstrated that the high GRPR expressing breast cancer cells typically express low to moderate level of integrin alpha(v)beta(3), while high integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expressing breast cancer cells have negligible level of GRPR. We labeled RGD-BBN heterodimer with three positron emitting radionuclides (18)F, (64)Cu, and (68)Ga and investigated the corresponding PET radiotracers in both orthotopic T47D (GRPR(+)/low integrin alpha(v)beta(3)) and MDA-MB-435 (GRPR(-)/integrin alpha(v)beta(3)(+)) breast cancer models. The three radiotracers all possessed in vitro dual integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and GRPR binding affinity. The advantages of the RGD-BBN radiotracers over the corresponding BBN analogues are obvious for imaging MDA-MB-435 (GRPR(-)/integrin alpha(v)beta(3)(+)) tumor. (18)F-FB-PEG(3)-RGD-BBN showed lower tumor uptake than (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-BBN and (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD-BBN but was able to visualize breast cancer tumors with high contrast. Synthesis of (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-BBN and (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD-BBN is much faster and easier than (18)F-FB-PEG(3)-RGD-BBN. (64)Cu-NOTA-RGD-BBN showed prolonged tumor uptake but also higher liver retention and kidney uptake than (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD-BBN and (18)F-FB-PEG(3)-RGD-BBN. (68)Ga-NOTA-RGD-BBN possessed high tumor signals but also relatively high background uptake compared with the other two radiotracers. In summary, the prosthetic labeling groups, chelators, and isotopes all have a profound effect on the tumor targeting efficacy and in vivo kinetics of the RGD-BBN tracers for dual integrin and GRPR recognition.

Besides socioeconomic factors, one of the most prominent attributes of developing countries is the dissimilarity of their age-dependent demographic structure. In Turkey, cancer incidence rates rise due to individual and environmental risk factors as well as due to the improvement in the registry system and to increase in access to health services. According to the data retrieved from the Ministry of Health Department of Cancer Control database cancer incidence rates increased between 2002 and 2005. Incidence rates rose from 133.78 per 100 thousand in 2002 to 173.85 per 100 thousand in 2005. Between 2002 and 2005 the average growth rate of increase for men comes about 9.7%, which is higher than 8.6% for women leading to the widening of incidence gap between man and women. First five frequent cancer types in Turkey are lung (30.13), prostate (24.33), skin (18.91), breast (17.96), stomach (9.92) cancer with an incidence of per 100 thousand. Cancer incidence growth rates for men exceed the cancer incidence growth rate for women. This gap is resulting mainly from lung cancer incidence which is much higher for men.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 118 (2010) 41-50]. In this paper, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the microarray data identified 7 luteolin-regulated genes (EGFR, c-Fos, SOS, GRB2, JNK1, MKK4 and RasGAP) in the Epidermal Growth Factor Signaling Pathway (EGFSP) potentially involved in luteolin regulation of CCP genes and cell proliferation. To address these possibilities, we compared the response profiles (RNA and protein) of these EGFSP and CCP genes to luteolin and gefitinib by real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blot analyses. Luteolin and gefitinib are known antagonists of EGFR-associated tyrosine protein kinase. Thus, the response profiles of EGFR regulated EGFSP or CCP genes should be very similar if genes in both pathways are controlled through this common mechanism of action. Treatment of PC-3 cell with luteolin for 24h caused a 4-fold stimulation of c-Fos gene expression, significant inhibition (p<0.001) of the CCP genes and G2/M arrest. Treatment of PC-3 cells with gefitinib also inhibited most of the CCP genes in a fashion similar to that of luteolin, however, the EGFR antagonist inhibited c-Fos gene expression, stimulated CDKN1B (p27) and arrested the cells in G0/G1. Thus, although the response patterns of most of the CCP genes to luteolin or gefitinib were similar, the effects of the two compounds on EGFSP gene expression and cell cycle arrest were clearly different. Combination studies revealed that the response of EGFSP genes to luteolin was not affected by gefitinib, even though the two compounds were additive with respect to their abilities to inhibit CCNA2, CCNE2, CDC25A and PCNA. These findings suggest that luteolin and gefitinib regulate CCP gene expression through a common mechanism involving EGFR-associated tyrosine kinase. Conversely, luteolin regulates PC-3 cell proliferation through an EGFR-tyrosine kinase independent mechanism(s), likely involving the epigenetic control of gene EGFSP gene expression through histone H4 binding interactions resulting in the upregulation of c-Fos and p21 gene expression.""","""['Barry M Markaverich', 'Mary Vijjeswarapu', 'Kevin Shoulars', 'Mary Rodriguez']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Gefitinib and luteolin cause growth arrest of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells via inhibition of cyclin G-associated kinase and induction of miR-630.', 'Multiple Sites of Type II Site Ligand (Luteolin and BMHPC) Regulation of Gene Expression in PC-3 Cells.', 'Uncoupling of the epidermal growth factor receptor from downstream signal transduction molecules guides the acquired resistance to gefitinib in prostate cancer cells.', 'An update of the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in breast cancer: Gefitinib (Iressa) -induced changes in the expression and nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of HER-ligands (Review).', 'EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ""gefitinib (Iressa)"" for cancer therapy.', 'Agri-Food By-Products in Cancer: New Targets and Strategies.', 'Role of Flavonoids as Epigenetic Modulators in Cancer Prevention and Therapy.', 'Remodeling the Epigenetic Landscape of Cancer-Application Potential of Flavonoids in the Prevention and Treatment of Cancer.', 'Current Perspective on the Natural Compounds and Drug Delivery Techniques in Glioblastoma Multiforme.', 'Quercetin and Its Nano-Scale Delivery Systems in Prostate Cancer Therapy: Paving the Way for Cancer Elimination and Reversing Chemoresistance.']"""

Methods and materials:   National Comprehensive Cancer Network low- or low-intermediate risk prostate cancer patients, treated with external beam radiotherapy or permanent prostate brachytherapy, were matched for prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, T-stage, percentage of positive cores, androgen deprivation therapy, and era, yielding 118 patient pairs. The Phoenix definition of biochemical failure was used. The best-fitting value for a/ß was found for up to 90-month follow-up using maximum likelihood analysis, and the 95% confidence interval using the profile likelihood method. Linear quadratic formalism was applied with the radiobiological parameters of relative biological effectiveness = 1.0, potential doubling time = 45 days, and repair half-time = 1 hour. Bootstrap analysis was performed to estimate uncertainties in outcomes, and hence in a/ß. Sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the values of the radiobiological parameters to extreme values.  Results:   The value of a/ß best fitting the outcomes data was >30 Gy, with lower 95% confidence limit of 5.2 Gy. This was confirmed on bootstrap analysis. Varying parameters to extreme values still yielded best-fit a/ß of >30 Gy, although the lower 95% confidence interval limit was reduced to 0.6 Gy.  Conclusions:   Using carefully matched groups, long follow-up, the Phoenix definition of biochemical failure, and well-established statistical methods, the best estimate of a/ß for low and low-tier intermediate-risk prostate cancer is likely to be higher than that of normal tissues, although a low value cannot be excluded.""","""['Richard Shaffer', 'Tom Pickles', 'Richard Lee', 'Vitali Moiseenko']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Biochemical outcomes after prostate brachytherapy with 5-year minimal follow-up: importance of patient selection and implant quality.', 'Radiation dose predicts for biochemical control in intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer in the PSA era: radiotherapeutic alternatives.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Meta-analysis of the alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer in the presence of an overall time factor: bad news, good news, or no news?', 'Radiobiological Meta-Analysis of the Response of Prostate Cancer to Different Fractionations: Evaluation of the Linear-Quadratic Response at Large Doses and the Effect of Risk and ADT.', 'Toxicity and quality of life report of a phase II study of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer.', 'Alpha/beta (α/β) ratio for prostate cancer derived from external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy boost.', 'The effectiveness and side effects of conformal external beam radiotherapy combined with high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost compared to conformal external beam radiotherapy alone in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Early closure of phase II prospective study on acute and late tolerance of hypofractionated radiotherapy in low-risk prostate cancer patients.']"""

Population studies have shown that metformin is associated with a significant reduction of neoplasias in general (and cancer of the breast and prostate, in particular). These observations are supported by in vitro and in vivo evidence that metformin inhibits the growth of cancer cells. The mechanisms underlying this protective potential of metformin are not completely understood. While other mechanisms have also been proposed, the protective action of metformin appears to be exerted by two main pathways. The first involves reduction of endogenous hyperinsulinemia. The second pathway relates to the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is recognized to inhibit cellular protein synthesis and growth.

Previous studies have shown spirituality to be a factor related to health and quality of life, but the process by which faith, as a promoter of action, supports coping merits exploration.  Objective:   Our purpose was to describe the use of faith by low-income, uninsured African American/black men in coping with prostate cancer and its treatment and adverse effects.  Methods:   We analyzed data from a qualitative study that used in-depth individual interviews involving 18 African American men ranging in ages from 53 to 81 years. Our analysis used grounded theory techniques.  Results:   Faith was used by African American men to overcome fear and shock engendered by their initial perceptions of cancer. Faith was placed in God, health care providers, self, and family. Men came to see their prostate cancer experience a new beginning that was achieved through purposeful acceptance or resignation.  Conclusions:   Faith was a motivator of and source for action. Faith empowered men to be active participants in their treatment and incorporate treatment outcomes into their lives meaningfully.  Implication:   By understanding faith as a source of empowerment for active participation in care, oncology nurses can use men's faith to facilitate reframing of cancer perceptions and to acknowledge the role of men's higher being as part of the team.

However, the combination of nuclear tomography with optical techniques has yet to be established. Here, we report the use of the inherent optical emissions from the decay of radiopharmaceuticals for Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) of tumors in vivo and correlate the results with those obtained from concordant immuno-PET studies.  Methods:   In vitro phantom studies were used to validate the visible light emission observed from a range of radionuclides including the positron emitters (18)F, (64)Cu, (89)Zr, and (124)I; beta-emitter (131)I; and alpha-particle emitter (225)Ac for potential use in CLI. The novel radiolabeled monoclonal antibody (89)Zr-desferrioxamine B [DFO]-J591 for immuno-PET of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression was used to coregister and correlate the CLI signal observed with the immuno-PET images and biodistribution studies.  Results:   Phantom studies confirmed that Cerenkov radiation can be observed from a range of positron-, beta-, and alpha-emitting radionuclides using standard optical imaging devices. The change in light emission intensity versus time was concordant with radionuclide decay and was also found to correlate linearly with both the activity concentration and the measured PET signal (percentage injected dose per gram). In vivo studies conducted in male severe combined immune deficient mice bearing PSMA-positive, subcutaneous LNCaP tumors demonstrated that tumor-specific uptake of (89)Zr-DFO-J591 could be visualized by both immuno-PET and CLI. Optical and immuno-PET signal intensities were found to increase over time from 24 to 96 h, and biodistribution studies were found to correlate well with both imaging modalities.  Conclusion:   These studies represent the first, to our knowledge, quantitative assessment of CLI for measuring radiotracer uptake in vivo. Many radionuclides common to both nuclear tomographic imaging and radiotherapy have the potential to be used in CLI. The value of CLI lies in its ability to image radionuclides that do not emit either positrons or gamma-rays and are, thus, unsuitable for use with current nuclear imaging modalities. Optical imaging of Cerenkov radiation emission shows excellent promise as a potential new imaging modality for the rapid, high-throughput screening of radiopharmaceuticals.""","""['Alessandro Ruggiero', 'Jason P Holland', 'Jason S Lewis', 'Jan Grimm']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Comparative immuno-Cerenkov luminescence and -PET imaging enables detection of PSMA+ tumors in mice using 64Cu-radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies.', 'Targeting the internal epitope of prostate-specific membrane antigen with 89Zr-7E11 immuno-PET.', 'Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging as a Modality to Evaluate Antibody-Based PET Radiotracers.', 'Cerenkov imaging.', 'Current Perspectives on 89Zr-PET Imaging.', 'Exploring the Potential of Zirconium-89 in Diagnostic Radiopharmaceutical Applications: An Analytical Investigation.', 'An Overview of In Vitro Assays of 64Cu-, 68Ga-, 125I-, and 99mTc-Labelled Radiopharmaceuticals Using Radiometric Counters in the Era of Radiotheranostics.', 'A review of recent and emerging approaches for the clinical application of Cerenkov luminescence imaging.', 'Practical Guidance for Developing Small-Molecule Optical Probes for In Vivo Imaging.', 'Detection of Shortwave-Infrared Cerenkov Luminescence from Medical Isotopes.']"""

The counselor assessed stage of readiness, reviewed booklet information, corrected knowledge deficits and helped with a values clarification exercise. The materials presented advantages and disadvantages of being screened and did not advocate for testing or for not testing. Outcome measures included changes in stage, decisional conflict, decisional satisfaction, perceived vulnerability and congruence of a PSA testing decision with a pros/cons score. Baseline and final surveys were administered by telephone.  Results:   There was an increase in PSA knowledge (p<0.001), and in decisional satisfaction (p<0.001), a decrease in decisional conflict (p<0.001), and a general consistency of those decisions with the man's values.

Methods:   We studied 1638 men at Duke University who underwent radical prostatectomy for unfavourable-risk prostate cancer and whose postoperative PSA was undetectable. Cox regression was used to evaluate whether salvage vs adjuvant RT in men with a rapid (<10 months) or slow (≥10 months) PSA doubling time (DT) was associated with the risk of ACM, adjusting for adverse features (pT3, R1, Gleason score 8-10), age, preoperative PSA level, comorbidity and hormonal therapy use.  Results:   Despite fewer men with two or more adverse features (61 vs 82%; P=0.016), salvage for a rapid PSA DT vs adjuvant RT increased the risk of ACM [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=3.42; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.27-9.20; P=0.015]. There was no difference (AHR=1.39; 95% CI=0.50-3.90; P=0.53) in the risk of ACM among men who received salvage for a slow PSA DT or adjuvant RT. Nearly all (90%) men with a slow PSA DT had Gleason score ≤7 and the majority (59%) had at most pT3 or R1 disease.

Randomness in cellular systems can be either spatial (anomalous) or temporal (heterogeneous). In order to separate both processes, we introduce anomalous random walks on fractals that represented crowded environments. We report the use of numerical simulation and experimental data of single-molecule detection by fluorescence fluctuation microscopy for detecting resolution limits of different mobile fractions in crowded environment of living cells. We simulate the time scale behavior of diffusion times tau(D)(tau) for one component, e.g. the fast mobile fraction, and a second component, e.g. the slow mobile fraction. The less the anomalous exponent alpha the higher the geometric crowding of the underlying structure of motion that is quantified by the ratio of the Hausdorff dimension and the walk exponent d(f)/d(w) and specific for the type of crowding generator used. The simulated diffusion time decreases for smaller values of alpha # 1 but increases for a larger time scale tau at a given value of alpha # 1. The effect of translational anomalous motion is substantially greater if alpha differs much from 1. An alpha value close to 1 contributes little to the time dependence of subdiffusive motions. Thus, quantitative determination of molecular weights from measured diffusion times and apparent diffusion coefficients, respectively, in temporal auto- and crosscorrelation analyses and from time-dependent fluorescence imaging data are difficult to interpret and biased in crowded environments of living cells and their cellular compartments; anomalous dynamics on different time scales tau must be coupled with the quantitative analysis of how experimental parameters change with predictions from simulated subdiffusive dynamics of molecular motions and mechanistic models. We first demonstrate that the crowding exponent alpha also determines the resolution of differences in diffusion times between two components in addition to photophysical parameters well-known for normal motion in dilute solution. The resolution limit between two different kinds of single molecule species is also analyzed under translational anomalous motion with broken ergodicity. We apply our theoretical predictions of diffusion times and lower limits for the time resolution of two components to fluorescence images in human prostate cancer cells transfected with GFP-Ago2 and GFP-Ago1. In order to mimic heterogeneous behavior in crowded environments of living cells, we need to introduce so-called continuous time random walks (CTRW). CTRWs were originally performed on regular lattice. This purely stochastic molecule behavior leads to subdiffusive motion with broken ergodicity in our simulations. For the first time, we are able to quantitatively differentiate between anomalous motion without broken ergodicity and anomalous motion with broken ergodicity in time-dependent fluorescence microscopy data sets of living cells. Since the experimental conditions to measure a selfsame molecule over an extended period of time, at which biology is taken place, in living cells or even in dilute solution are very restrictive, we need to perform the time average over a subpopulation of different single molecules of the same kind. For time averages over subpopulations of single molecules, the temporal auto- and crosscorrelation functions are first found. Knowing the crowding parameter alpha for the cell type and cellular compartment type, respectively, the heterogeneous parameter gamma can be obtained from the measurements in the presence of the interacting reaction partner, e.g. ligand, with the same alpha value. The product alpha x gamma = gamma is not a simple fitting parameter in the temporal auto- and two-color crosscorrelation functions because it is related to the proper physical models of anomalous (spatial) and heterogeneous (temporal) randomness in cellular systems.We have already derived an analytical solution gamma for in the special case of gamma = 3/2. In the case of two-color crosscorrelation or/and two-color fluorescence imaging (co-localization experiments), the second component is also a two-color species gr, for example a different molecular complex with an additional ligand. Here, we first show that plausible biological mechanisms from FCS/ FCCS and fluorescence imaging in living cells are highly questionable without proper quantitative physical models of subdiffusive motion and temporal randomness. At best, such quantitative FCS/ FCCS and fluorescence imaging data are difficult to interpret under crowding and heterogeneous conditions. It is challenging to translate proper physical models of anomalous (spatial) and heterogeneous (temporal) randomness in living cells and their cellular compartments like the nucleus into biological models of the cell biological process under study testable by single-molecule approaches. Otherwise, quantitative FCS/FCCS and fluorescence imaging measurements in living cells are not well described and cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way.""","""['Gerd Baumann', 'Robert F Place', 'Zeno Földes-Papp']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Biotechnol""","""['Macromolecular crowding: chemistry and physics meet biology (Ascona, Switzerland, 10-14 June 2012).', 'Individual macromolecule motion in a crowded living cell.', 'Anomalous transport in the crowded world of biological cells.', 'Anomalous diffusion of proteins due to molecular crowding.', 'Crowding effects on diffusion in solutions and cells.', 'Visualization of subdiffusive sites in a live single cell.', 'Insights into cell membrane microdomain organization from live cell single particle tracking of the IgE high affinity receptor FcϵRI of mast cells.', 'Hindered diffusion in polymeric solutions studied by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.', 'Fluorescence molecule counting for single-molecule studies in crowded environment of living cells without and with broken ergodicity.']"""

In this study, we investigated the effects of genistein-selenium (Gn-Se) combination on chemosensitivity and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression levels in PC3 (hormone-independent) and LNCaP (hormone-dependent) prostate cancer cells. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium staining and ATP bioassay showed that genistein, selenium, and Gn-Se combination significantly inhibited growth of LNCaP and PC3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, independent of hormonal status, and with no significant differences in chemosensitivity between LNCaP and PC3. Gn-Se combination induced significantly the greatest growth inhibition in both cell lines. Growth inhibition was through apoptosis induction. The treatment-induced apoptotic cascades are caspase-dependent, with evidence of an alternative non-caspase pathway(s). Treatment also induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in MMP-2 expression levels in PC3 and LNCaP with no significant differences between the two cells. Gn-Se combination induced the greatest depression in MMP-2. Overall, none of the treatment modalities had any significant inhibitory effect in normal prostate epithelial cells.

However, imaging in this manner provides images and spectra of the prostate in the deformed state because of the insertion of the endorectal coil. Such deformation may lead to uncertainties in the localization of prostate cancer during therapy. We propose a novel 3-D elastic registration procedure that is based on the minimization of a physically motivated strain energy function that requires the identification of similar features (points, curves, or surfaces) in the source and target images. The Gauss-Seidel method was used in the numerical implementation of the registration algorithm. The registration procedure was validated on synthetic digital images, MR images from prostate phantom, and MR images obtained on patients. The registration error, assessed by averaging the displacement of a fiducial landmark in the target to its corresponding point in the registered image, was 0.2 ± 0.1 pixels on synthetic images. On the prostate phantom and patient data, the registration errors were 1.0 ± 0.6 pixels (0.6 ± 0.4 mm) and 1.8 ± 0.7 pixels (1.1 ± 0.4 mm), respectively. Registration also improved image similarity (normalized cross-correlation) from 0.72 ± 0.10 to 0.96 ± 0.03 on patient data.

Ultimately, the goal of anti-tumor vaccines is to elicit a sustainable immune response, able to eradicate a tumor, or at least restrain its growth. We have investigated plasmid DNA vaccines and have previously conducted a phase 1 trial in which patients with recurrent prostate cancer were vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding PAP. In this study, we investigated the immunologic efficacy of subsequent booster immunizations, and conducted more detailed longitudinal immune analysis, to answer several questions aimed at guiding optimal schedules of vaccine administration for future clinical trials. We report that antigen-specific cytolytic T-cell responses were amplified after immunization in 7 of 12 human leukocyte antigen-A2-expressing individuals, and that multiple immunizations seemed necessary to elicit PAP-specific interferon-gamma-secreting immune responses detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. Moreover, among individuals who experienced a >/=200% increase in prostate-specific antigen doubling time, long-term PAP-specific interferon-gamma-secreting T-cell responses were detectable in 6 of 8, but in only 1 of 14 individuals without an observed change in prostate-specific antigen doubling time (P=0.001). Finally, we identified that immune responses elicited could be further amplified by subsequent booster immunizations. These results suggest that future trials using this DNA vaccine, and potentially other anti-tumor DNA vaccines, could investigate ongoing schedules of administration with periodic booster immunizations.

SERCA inhibition leads to elevated calcium levels in the cytoplasm, which in turn induces apoptosis. We present x-ray crystallographic and intrinsic fluorescence data to show how Tg and chemical analogs of the compound with modified or removed side chains bind to isolated SERCA 1a membranes. This occurs by uptake via the membrane lipid followed by insertion into a resident intramembranous binding site with few adaptative changes. Our binding data indicate that a balanced hydrophobicity and accurate positioning of the side chains, provided by the central guaianolide ring structure, defines a pharmacophore of Tg that governs both high affinity and access to the protein-binding site. Tg analogs substituted with long linkers at O-8 extend from the binding site between transmembrane segments to the putative N-terminal Ca(2+) entry pathway. The long chain analogs provide a rational basis for the localization of the linker, the presence of which is necessary for enabling prostate-specific antigen to cleave peptide-conjugated prodrugs targeting SERCA of cancer cells (Denmeade, S.

Here, we show that SENP1 (sentrin/SUMO-specific protease 1) is highly expressed in human prostate cancer specimens and correlates with hypoxia-inducing factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) expression. Mechanistic studies in a mouse model indicate that androgen-driven expression of murine SENP1 leads to HIF1alpha stabilization, enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor production, and angiogenesis. Further pathological assessment of the mouse indicates that SENP1 overexpression induces transformation of the normal prostate gland and gradually facilitates the onset of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Consistent with cell culture studies, SENP1 enhances prostate epithelial cell proliferation via modulating the androgen receptor and cyclin D(1).

Materials and methods:   This retrospective single-institution study was approved by the committee on human research, with a waiver of informed consent, and was compliant with HIPAA requirements. Sixty-four men who underwent endorectal MR imaging, MR spectroscopic imaging, and transrectal ultrasonographically guided biopsy for suspected local recurrence of prostate cancer after definitive external beam radiation therapy were retrospectively identified. Thirty-three patients had also received androgen therapy. Recurrent cancer was determined to be present or absent in the left and right sides of the prostate at T2-weighted MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging by a radiologist and a spectroscopist, respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A(Z)) was calculated for T2-weighted MR imaging alone and combined T2-weighted MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging by using generalized estimating equations and by using biopsy results as the reference standard.  Results:   Recurrent prostate cancer was identified at biopsy in 37 (58%) of the 64 men. Recurrence was unilateral in 28 patients and bilateral in nine (total of 46 affected prostate sides). A(Z) analysis revealed that use of combined T2-weighted MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging (A(Z) = 0.79), as compared with T2-weighted MR imaging alone (A(Z) = 0.67), significantly improved the detection of local recurrence (P = .001).

Inhibitors of PARP efficiently kill breast, ovarian, or prostate tumors in patients carrying hereditary mutations in the homologous recombination (HR) genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 through synthetic lethality. Here, we surprisingly show that PARP1 is hyperactivated in replicating BRCA2-defective cells. PARP1 hyperactivation is explained by the defect in HR as shRNA depletion of RAD54, RAD52, BLM, WRN, and XRCC3 proteins, which we here show are all essential for efficient HR and also caused PARP hyperactivation and correlated with an increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. BRCA2-defective cells were not found to have increased levels of SSBs, and PAR polymers formed in HR-defective cells do not colocalize to replication protein A or gammaH2AX, excluding the possibility that PARP hyperactivity is due to increased SSB repair or PARP induced at damaged replication forks. Resistance to PARP inhibitors can occur through genetic reversion in the BRCA2 gene. Here, we report that PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA2-mutant cells revert back to normal levels of PARP activity. We speculate that the reason for the sensitivity of HR-defective cells to PARP inhibitors is related to the hyperactivated PARP1 in these cells. Furthermore, the presence of PAR polymers can be used to identify HR-defective cells that are sensitive to PARP inhibitors, which may be potential biomarkers.""","""['Ponnari Gottipati', 'Barbara Vischioni', 'Niklas Schultz', 'Joyce Solomons', 'Helen E Bryant', 'Tatjana Djureinovic', 'Natalia Issaeva', 'Kate Sleeth', 'Ricky A Sharma', 'Thomas Helleday']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Specific killing of BRCA2-deficient tumours with inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.', 'Exploiting the Achilles heel of cancer: the therapeutic potential of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in BRCA2-defective cancer.', 'Replication fork stability confers chemoresistance in BRCA-deficient cells.', 'The underlying mechanism for the PARP and BRCA synthetic lethality: clearing up the misunderstandings.', 'From poly(ADP-ribose) discovery to PARP inhibitors in cancer therapy.', 'PARP1 negatively regulates transcription of BLM through its interaction with HSP90AB1 in prostate cancer.', 'Advances in PARP Inhibitors for Prostate Cancer.', 'DNA Damage Response Mechanisms in Head and Neck Cancer: Significant Implications for Therapy and Survival.', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and its ambiguous role in cellular life and death.', 'The potential of PARP inhibitors in targeted cancer therapy and immunotherapy.']"""

PI-103 is an isoform-selective class I PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. The aims of this work were as follows: first, to use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to identify and develop a robust pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker for target inhibition and potentially tumor response following PI3K inhibition; second, to evaluate mechanisms underlying the MRS-detected changes. Treatment of human PTEN null PC3 prostate and PIK3CA mutant HCT116 colon carcinoma cells with PI-103 resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in phosphocholine (PC) and total choline (tCho) levels (P < 0.05) detected by phosphorus ((31)P)- and proton ((1)H)-MRS. In contrast, the cytotoxic microtubule inhibitor docetaxel increased glycerophosphocholine and tCho levels in PC3 cells. PI-103-induced MRS changes were associated with alterations in the protein expression levels of regulatory enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including choline kinase alpha (ChoK(alpha)), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and phosphorylated ATP-citrate lyase (pACL). However, a strong correlation (r(2) = 0.9, P = 0.009) was found only between PC concentrations and ChoK(alpha) expression but not with FAS or pACL. This study identified inhibition of ChoK(alpha) as a major cause of the observed change in PC levels following PI-103 treatment. We also showed the capacity of (1)H-MRS, a clinically well-established technique with higher sensitivity and wider applicability compared with (31)P-MRS, to assess response to PI-103.

In this study, we show that MT1-MMP-expressing LNCaP prostate cancer cells display enhanced migration. Moreover, conditioned medium from LNCaP cells expressing both RANKL and MT1-MMP stimulates the migration of MT1-MMP-deficient C42b prostate cancer cells. This enhanced chemotaxis can be abrogated by osteoprotegerin (soluble decoy receptor of RANKL), MIK-G2 (a selective inhibitor for MT1-MMP), and PP2 (a Src inhibitor).

Conventional therapies produce a high rate of cure for patients with localized prostate cancer, but there is, at present, no effective treatment for intervention in metastatic prostate cancer. These facts underline the need to develop new approaches for early diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer patients, and mechanism based anti-metastasis therapies that will improve the outlook for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. In this study we evaluated role of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) in prostate cancer.  Results:   We observed decreased PDEF expression in prostate cancer cell lines correlated with increased aggressive phenotype, and complete loss of PDEF protein in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Loss of PDEF expression was confirmed in high Gleason Grade prostate cancer samples by immuno-histochemical methods. Reintroduction of PDEF profoundly affected cell behavior leading to less invasive phenotypes in three dimensional cultures. In addition, PDEF expressing cells had altered cell morphology, decreased FAK phosphorylation and decreased colony formation, cell migration, and cellular invasiveness. In contrast PDEF knockdown resulted in increased migration and invasion as well as clonogenic activity. Our results also demonstrated that PDEF downregulated MMP9 promoter activity, suppressed MMP9 mRNA expression, and resulted in loss of MMP9 activity in prostate cancer cells. These results suggested that loss of PDEF might be associated with increased MMP9 expression and activity in aggressive prostate cancer. To confirm results we investigated MMP9 expression in clinical samples of prostate cancer. Results of these studies show increased MMP9 expression correlated with advanced Gleason grade. Taken together our results demonstrate decreased PDEF expression and increased MMP9 expression during the transition to aggressive prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   These studies demonstrate for the first time negative regulation of MMP9 expression by PDEF, and that PDEF expression was lost in aggressive prostate cancer and was inversely associated with MMP9 expression in clinical samples of prostate cancer. Based on these exciting results, we propose that loss of PDEF along with increased MMP9 expression should serve as novel markers for early detection of aggressive prostate cancer.""","""['Thomas R Johnson', 'Sweaty Koul', 'Binod Kumar', 'Lakshmipathi Khandrika', 'Sarah Venezia', 'Paul D Maroni', 'Randall B Meacham', 'Hari K Koul']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Retraction Note to: Loss of PDEF, a prostate-derived Ets factor is associated with aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer: Regulation of MMP 9 by PDEF.', 'Mechanisms and functional consequences of PDEF protein expression loss during prostate cancer progression.', 'Prostate-Derived Ets Factor (PDEF) Inhibits Metastasis by Inducing Epithelial/Luminal Phenotype in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'HOXB13 regulates the prostate-derived Ets factor: implications for prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Signatures of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) in cancer.', 'Prostate derived ETS factor (PDEF): a putative tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'Identification of novel biomarkers differentially expressed between African-American and Caucasian-American prostate cancer patients.', 'SPDEF suppresses head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression by transcriptionally activating NR4A1.', 'Hippo pathway: Regulation, deregulation and potential therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'Prostate-Derived ETS Factor (PDEF) Modulates Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1) in Prostate Cancer Cells: A Potential Cross-Talk between PDEF and Hippo Signaling.', 'Upregulation of SPDEF is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer.']"""

However, little information is available about the prostatic reaction to bacterial compounds in vivo. Our aim was therefore to evaluate the early effects of bacterial infection on rat ventral prostate compartments.  Methods:   Using a rat model of acute bacterial prostatitis by Escherichia coli, we analyzed the histological and ultrastructural changes in the prostate at 24, 48, and 72 hr postinfection. Prostatic tissues were immunostained for prostatic binding protein (PBP), ACTA2, ErbB1, and ErbB2 receptors, TUNEL, and markers of cell proliferation. Dot and Western blots for PBP, ACTA2, ErbB1, ErbB2, and TGFbeta1 were also performed.  Results:   The prostatic epithelium became hypertrophied, with increases in PBP and ErbB1 expression at 24 hr postinfection. Moreover, inflammation induced the expression of ErbB2, a receptor strongly involved in carcinogenesis. These alterations were more pronounced at 48 hr, but the epithelium also showed apoptosis and finally atrophy at 72 hr postinfection, with a decrease in PBP and ErbB receptors. Interestingly, the epithelial cells exhibited a high level of proliferation in response to the bacteria. The stromal reaction to acute inflammation was initially characterized by smooth muscle hypertrophy. Afterwards, muscle cells acquired a secretory phenotype, with a reduction in ACTA2 at 72 hr postinfection.  Conclusions:   Prostatic inflammation, even at the early stages, promotes atrophic and proliferative changes, and the upregulation of ErbB receptors together with dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells.

Results:   Variation in beta2M expression in human prostate cancer is associated with characteristics of clinically aggressive disease such as high tumor grade. Knockdown of beta2M expression in human prostate cancer cells resulted in selective defects in androgen-dependent events including growth, gene regulation, and chromatin assembly.

The latter has been mainly associated with muscle regeneration processes.  Methods:   We used immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western analysis to show the expression status of MGF in prostate tissue and human prostate cell lines (HPrEC, PC-3, and LNCaP) and we studied the exogenous administration of the MGF peptide E on cellular proliferation using trypan blue and MTT assays, before and after the silencing of the IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor (siRNA methods). The MGF-induced intracellular activation was examined by Western analysis of the active forms of ERK1/2 and Akt.  Results:   We documented that MGF is overexpressed in human prostate cancer (PCa) tissues and in human PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Notably, MGF expression was remarkably higher in PCa and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) than normal prostate tissues, while the normal prostate epithelial cells (HPrEC) did not express MGF. Exogenous administration of a synthetic MGF E peptide stimulated the PCa cell growth and activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation without affecting Akt phosphorylation. IGF-1R or insulin receptor (IR) silencing did not affect the mitogenic activity and intracellular signaling of the MGF E peptide in these PCa cells.  Conclusions:   These data suggest the possible implication of MGF E peptide in cancer biology, implying a preferential MGF expression in PCa tissues and cells.

Methods:   Cell-cycle analysis, plasmatic membrane damage, clonogenic assay, comet assay, and Western blot methodologies were employed to assess the effects of Phenoxodiol on prostate cancer cell lines. An in vivo model confirmed the potential therapeutic efficacy of Phenoxodiol when administered orally to tumor bearing mice.  Results:   Phenoxodiol treatment promoted a marked inhibition of proliferation and loss of colony formation in LNCaP cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

Methods:   Expression level of Slug and other genes was examined by Western blot, RT-PCR, and QPCR analyses. The forced expression of Slug was mediated by retroviruses and adenoviruses. Slug was downregulated by shRNA. Cell growth was measured by the MTT assay and the quick cell proliferation assay.  Results:   Here, we demonstrated that Slug expression is elevated in mouse prostate tumors, and human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and 22RV1. Forced expression of Slug-inhibited proliferation of prostate cancer cells PC-3 and DU-145. Conversely, reduced expression of Slug by shRNA promoted growth of PC-3 cancer cells. Consistent with these data, we found that forced expression of Slug in prostate cancer cells led to G1 cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Slug decreased cyclin D1 expression in both PC-3 and DU-145 cells, and knockdown of Slug by shRNA upregulated cyclin D1 expression in these cancer cells. In addition, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of cyclin D1 relieved Slug-mediated inhibition of proliferation of prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   We provide the first compelling evidence that Slug is a negative regulator of proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Our findings in this study are distinct from the previously reported role of Slug as a promoter for tumor metastasis, and suggest that Slug is a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target.""","""['Jun Liu', 'Berna Uygur', 'Zhonghui Zhang', 'Lijian Shao', 'Diana Romero', 'Calvin Vary', 'Qiang Ding', 'Wen-Shu Wu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['SLUG promotes prostate cancer cell migration and invasion via CXCR4/CXCL12 axis.', 'SLUG is a direct transcriptional repressor of PTEN tumor suppressor.', 'Slug regulates Cyclin D1 expression by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'Over-expression of lipocalin 2 promotes cell migration and invasion through activating ERK signaling to increase SLUG expression in prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS4 induces invasion and proliferation of prostate cancer cells through induction of Slug and cyclin D1.', 'TMPRSS4 promotes cancer stem-like properties in prostate cancer cells through upregulation of SOX2 by SLUG and TWIST1.', 'pSlugS158 immunohistochemistry is a novel promising mitotic marker for FFPE samples: a pilot study.', 'MicroRNAs as Epigenetic Determinants of Treatment Response and Potential Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer.', 'Transcription Factors That Govern Development and Disease: An Achilles Heel in Cancer.', 'In\xa0vitro effects of resistin on epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells - qRT-PCR and Westen blot analyses data.']"""

The results showed that betulin significantly inhibited cell viability in cervix carcinoma HeLa cells, hepatoma HepG2 cells, lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, and breast cancer MCF-7 cells with IC(50) values ranging from 10 to 15 microg/mL. While betulin exhibited only moderate anticancer activity in other human cancer cells such as hepatoma SK-HEP-1 cells, prostate carcinoma PC-3, and lung carcinoma NCI-H460, with IC(50) values ranging from 20 to 60 microg/mL, it showed minor growth inhibition in human erythroleukemia K562 cells (IC(50) > 100 microg/mL). We further investigated the mechanism of anticancer activity by betulin, using HeLa cells as an experimental model. Betulin (10 microg/mL) induces apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by morphological characteristics such as membrane phosphatidylserine translocation, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation. A kinetics analysis showed that the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c occurred as early as 30 min after treatment with betulin. Betulin, unlike its chemical derivative betulinic acid, did not directly trigger mitochondrial cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria. Importantly, Bax and Bak were rapidly translocated to the mitochondria 30 min after betulin treatment. The sequential activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3/-7 and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were observed behind those mitochondrial events. Furthermore, specific downregulation of either caspase-9, Bax, or Bak by siRNA effectively reduced PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation.

IADT involves regrowth of the tumor during the off cycle upon testosterone recovery. Our previous studies showed that testosterone is more potent than dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the induction of a subset of androgen-responsive genes during rat prostate regrowth. However, it is not clear if the same phenomenon would occur during androgen-induced regrowth of prostate tumors. Understanding the differences between testosterone and DHT in inducing androgen-responsive genes during prostate tumor regrowth may provide new insight for improving IADT.  Methods:   Nude mice bearing androgen-sensitive LNCaP xenograft were castrated and followed up for 7-10 days before being randomized into various androgen manipulations, consisting of continuous castration (C) or testosterone replacement (T) in the absence or presence of dutasteride (D), a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of testosterone to DHT. Testes-intact animals in the absence or presence of D were used as controls. The expression of five androgen-responsive genes, including the tumor suppressor U19/Eaf2, was determined using real-time RT-PCR, 3 days after randomization.  Results:   In LNCaP tumors, the expression of U19/Eaf2 was higher in the T+D group as compared with T alone (2.87-fold, P < 0.05). In contrast, dutasteride treatment in testes-intact animals inhibited the expression of U19/Eaf2.  Conclusions:   Inhibition of 5alpha-reductase during LNCaP tumor regrowth enhanced the expression of U19/Eaf2, an androgen-regulated tumor suppressor.

The aim of this study was to profile methylation of apoptotic-related genes in CaP using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC).  Methods:   Based on an in silico selection process, 13 genes were screened for methylation in CaP cell lines using DHPLC. Quantitative methylation specific PCR was employed to determine methylation levels in prostate tissue specimens (n = 135), representing tumor, histologically benign prostate, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Gene expression was measured by QRT-PCR in cell lines and tissue specimens.  Results:   The promoters of BIK, BNIP3, cFLIP, TMS1, DCR1, DCR2, and CDKN2A appeared fully or partially methylated in a number of malignant cell lines. This is the first report of aberrant methylation of BIK, BNIP3, and cFLIP in CaP. Quantitative methylation analysis in prostate tissues identified 5 genes (BNIP3, CDKN2A, DCR1, DCR2 and TMS1) which were frequently methylated in tumors but were unmethylated in 100% of benign tissues. Furthermore, 69% of tumors were methylated in at least one of the five-gene panel.

Therefore I inferred biological functions associated with these risk genes using gene expression correlation analysis.  Methods:   PC risk genes reported in the literature were classified as having high (P<10(-6)), medium (P<10(-4)), or low (P<10(-2)) statistical confidence. Correlation coefficients of the expression levels between the risk genes and other genes in cancerous prostates samples were compared against those in normal prostates using a microarray dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus.  Results:   Overall, significant decrease of correlations in PC was observed between the levels of expression of the high-confidence genes and other genes in the microarray dataset, whereas correlation between low-confidence genes and other genes in PC showed smaller decrease. Genes involved in developmental processes were significantly correlated with all risk gene categories. Ectoderm development genes, which may be related to squamous metaplasia, and genes enriched in fetal prostate stem cells (PSCs) showed strong association with the high-confidence genes. The association between the PSC genes and the low-confidence genes was weak, but genes related to neural system genes showed strong association with low-confidence genes.

Tumor growth and volumes over the ensuing 3 weeks were assessed using calipers and micro-computed tomography. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify engrafted hASCs in tumor sections.  Results:   At 3 weeks after injection, the mean tumor volume in the MDA PCa 118b/hASC co-injection group (1019.95 ± 73.49 mm(3)) was significantly higher than that in the MDA PCa 118b-only group (308.70 ± 21.06 mm(3)).

We present and assess a novel method for PCa detection, grading, volume evaluation and tumor location, based on non-invasive zinc concentration mapping in the gland by means of a dedicated rectal probe.  Methods:   Zinc-concentration values measured in histologically examined tissue fragments from needle biopsy of 598 patients were analyzed. They were used to generate computer simulated zinc-concentration maps, further analyzed with image-processing tools. The tumor detection performances versus Gleason grade were assessed.  Results:   A significant increase of zinc depletion with increasing Gleason pattern (grade) classification was established. Tumor detection performance in zinc-concentration maps progressively improves with the cancer's first component score. Reliable information on the location, size and Gleason-grade combination of the lesion can be extracted for clinically relevant volumes.  Conclusions:   Zinc depletion in the prostate peripheral zone is the basis for a novel, non-invasive PCa detection, localization, volume evaluation and grading method. Its realization and application as a pre-biopsy and pre-treatment examination, or a follow-up tool, relies on the development of a dedicated transrectal probe.

Results:   There was an inverse association between RNASEL rs486907 and prostate cancer in younger men (<65 years) and those with a first-degree relative with prostate cancer; men with AA genotype had ORs of 0.64 and 0.47 (both P < 0.05), respectively, in comparison to men with GG genotype.

Methods:   We genotyped three MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T, A1298C, and G1793A) and measured serum total homocysteine (tHcy), folate, and vitamin B12 levels in a case-control study of 174 cases and 348 normal healthy controls. The cancer-free controls were frequency matched to the cases by age (±2 years), educational level, occupational status, ethnicity, and smoking status.  Results:   We found that the MTHFR 677TT and 1298CC genotypes were associated with an about 40% reduction in risk of prostate cancer (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.41-0.94, and adjusted OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.32-0.91, respectively) compared to the 677CC, and 1298AA genotypes.

In contrast, the variant genotypes of 1793GA + 677CT were associated with slightly increased risk for prostate cancer (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 0.86-2.15). Regarding prostate cancer aggressiveness, the 677TT genotype was associated with more than 50% decreased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score >7) compared with the 677CC and 677CT genotypes (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.24-0.64; P = 0.001). There was no significant difference in plasma levels of tHcy, folate, and vitamin B12 between the two groups with any genotypes.

Tumor heterogeneity in both primary and metastatic prostate cancers is a major hurdle in elucidating the mechanisms of metastasis in this disease. To circumvent this obstacle and improve our understanding of prostate cancer metastasis, we developed multiple tumor tissue lines from one patient's primary prostate cancer specimen to examine differences in metastatic ability.  Methods:   Pieces of tissue from different foci of a patient's primary prostate tumor were grafted into subrenal capsules of NOD-SCID mice and transplantable tumor sublines were established by serial passage. The metastatic ability of each subline was tested via orthotopic grafting into mice. Chromosomal alterations exclusively presented in a metastatic subline were examined by SKY and investigated for their presence in parental tissues by fluorescence in situ hybridization.  Results:   Three transplantable sublines were developed, resembling the primary tumor histologically, exhibiting poor differentiation, and different growth rates. Importantly, the LTL-220N and LTL-221N sublines were non-metastatic, whereas the LTL-220M subline was spontaneously metastatic in vivo. SKY analysis showed limited but unique chromosomal alterations in each subline. Some chromosomal alterations, exclusively present in the metastatic LTL-220M subline, were also observed in a small portion of the parental cancer tissues.  Conclusion:   The results indicate that in primary prostate tumors metastatic potential can be confined to a minority of cancer cells.

Clinical, surgical, and pathologic features were evaluated for associations with 4 locations of site-specific disease recurrence: upper urinary tract, abdomen/pelvis, thoracic region, and bone. Recurrence-free survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to test associations with disease recurrence.  Results:   A total of 493 (35.5%) patients experienced at least 1 recurrence. There were 67, 388, 143, and 145 patients with recurrences to the upper tract, abdomen/pelvis, thoracic region, and bone at a median of 3.1 years, 1.1 years, 1.3 years, and 1.0 years, respectively.

Methods:   This was a retrospective study of patient archives between 1990 through 2006. Data collection was accomplished by examining patients' charts and electronic medical records. Data from 5570 patients, of whom 911 were black, were analyzed statistically by testing and comparing parameters over time.  Results:   During this 16-year period, mean age at the time of initial diagnostic prostate biopsy did not change in either group, despite what we had believed about the effects of patient education and screening campaigns. However, prostate-cancer detection rates did decrease during the time period studied. Over time, the authors also observed significant decreases in the sensitivity and specificity of PSA as a screening tool. Indeed, analysis of more recent cases demonstrated a positive predictive value comparable to a coin toss. While Gleason scores remained relatively stable over time, reporting of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and inflammation increased.  Conclusions:   Using lower PSA thresholds, promoting younger screening age, and increasing efforts to educate the public have not seemed to influence age at time of diagnostic testing, which may reflect other factors such as usefulness of screening, physician referral patterns, patient compliance, and other sociodemographic issues.

Leflunomide is prescribed to patients worldwide as an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory disease-modifying prodrug. Leflunomide inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer xenographs in mice, and leflunomide or TFN promoted cytostasis and/or apoptosis in cultured cells. These findings suggest that TFN could be useful in prostate cancer chemoprevention. We investigated the possible mechanistic aspects of this tenet by characterizing the effects of TFN using premalignant PWR-1E and malignant DU-145 human prostate epithelial cells. TFN promoted a dose- and time-dependent cytostasis or apoptosis induction in these cells. The cytostatic effects of TFN, which were reversible but not by the presence of excess uridine in the culture medium, included diminished cellular uridine levels, an inhibition in oxygen consumption, a suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, S-phase cell cycle arrest, and a conspicuous reduction in the size and number of the nucleoli in the nuclei of these cells. Conversely, TFN's apoptogenic effects were characteristic of catastrophic mitochondrial disruption (i.e., a dissipation of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, enhanced ROS production, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and cytoplasmic vacuolization) and followed by DNA fragmentation. The respiration-deficient derivatives of the DU-145 cells, which are also uridine auxotrophs, were markedly resistant to the cytostatic and apoptotic effects of TFN, implicating de novo pyrimidine synthesis and mitochondrial bioenergetics as the primary targets for TFN in the respiration competent cells.

Impaired endocytic downregulation of EGFR also contributes to oncogenic phenotypes such as metastasis. Thus, understanding the roles of divergent signaling pathways in the regulation of EGFR trafficking and EGFR-driven invasive migration may enable the development of more effective therapies. In this study, we use the human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3, to investigate the effects of both the ERK and Akt pathways on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated EGFR signaling, trafficking and cell motility. We show that DU145 and PC3 cells overexpress EGFR and migrate in a ligand (EGF)-dependent manner. Next, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ERK (but not Akt) signaling enhances EGF-induced EGFR activation, ubiquitination and downregulation, and may lead to enhanced receptor turnover. These findings negatively correlate with ERK-mediated threonine phosphorylation of EGFR, implicating it as a possible mechanism. Further, we uncover that EGF promotes disassembly of cell-cell junctions, downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of the transcriptional repressor, Snail, typical characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These effects are dependent on activation of Akt, as inhibition of Akt signaling abolishes EGF/EGFR-driven cell migration and EMT. Knockdown of endogenous Snail also prevents EGFR-mediated downregulation of E-cadherin, EMT and cell migration. Surprisingly, inhibition of the ERK pathway augments EGFR-dependent motility, occurring concomitantly with elevation of EGF-induced Akt activity. Collectively, our results suggest that EGF-triggered ERK activation has profound feedback on EGFR signaling and trafficking by EGFR threonine phosphorylation, and Akt has a pivotal role in EGFR-mediated cell migration by activating EMT. More important, our results also suggest that therapeutic targeting of ERK signaling may have undesirable outcomes (for example, augmenting EGFR-driven motility).""","""['Y Gan', 'C Shi', 'L Inge', 'M Hibner', 'J Balducci', 'Y Huang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Prolactin modulates phosphorylation, signaling and trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptor in human T47D breast cancer cells.', 'Activation of EGFR promotes squamous carcinoma SCC10A cell migration and invasion via inducing EMT-like phenotype change and MMP-9-mediated degradation of E-cadherin.', 'Angiotensin II promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration through release of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor and activation of EGF-receptor pathway.', 'Potential mechanism of interleukin-8 production from lung cancer cells: an involvement of EGF-EGFR-PI3K-Akt-Erk pathway.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Prostate Cancer.', 'Reduced expression of FRG1 facilitates breast cancer progression via GM-CSF/MEK-ERK axis by abating FRG1 mediated transcriptional repression of GM-CSF.', 'Exogenous growth hormone promotes an epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid phenotype in cancerous HeLa cells but not in non-cancerous HEK293 cells.', 'Extracellular Vesicles and Resistance to Anticancer Drugs: A Tumor Skeleton Key for Unhinging Chemotherapies.', 'Versican secreted by the ovary links ovulation and migration in fallopian tube derived serous cancer.', 'Circulating Tumour Cells Indicate the Presence of Residual Disease Post-Castration in Prostate Cancer Patient-Derived Xenograft Models.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between NOS2 polymorphisms and BPH. With a cohort of 205 controls and 229 BPH subjects, we genotyped three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NOS2 gene, including rs2779248 (promoter, -278 T/C), rs10459953 (5'-untranslated region) and rs2297518 (exon 16, missense, Ser608Leu), using direct sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotypic and allelic frequencies between control and BPH subjects were compared, and the associations among the BPH subjects were analyzed.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to delineate TMPRSS2-ERG aberrations. Using maximum Gleason score, based on three core evaluation, and overall Gleason score, based on prostatectomy sections, Fisher's exact test was performed for tumors with TMPRSS2-ERG translocation/deletion, copy number increase (≥ 3) of the TMPRSS2-ERG region without translocation/deletion, and copy number increase and concomitant translocation/deletion. In all, 217 (42%) translocation/deletion and 30 (5.9%) copy number increase-alone cases were detected. Among 217 translocation/deletion cases, 32 had translocation/deletion with copy number increase. In all, 237, 200, and 75 cancers had maximum core-specific Gleason score of 6, 7, and 8-10, respectively. Tumors with translocation/deletion tended toward lower Gleason scores than those without (P=0.002) with similar results for overall Gleason score (P=0.02); copy number increase cases tended toward higher Gleason scores than those without (P<0.001).

Quantitative proteomic analysis of N-glycosylated proteins detected an increased amount of CD90/THY1 in cancer supernatants compared with non-cancer supernatants. Immunohistochemistry showed that in all carcinomas, regardless of Gleason grade, a layer of CD90-positive stromal fibroblastic cells, ∼5 to 10 cells deep, was localized to tumor glands.

Methods:   The study was conducted via qualitative interviews, using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach. Ten men treated with endocrine therapy or under active surveillance were interviewed.  Results:   Being diagnosed with prostate cancer was described as a shock, with different aspects of the illness revealed gradually. The limited amount of time available for meeting with health care providers contributed to patients' feelings of being left alone with difficulty getting information and help. Sexual and urinary problems were perceived as a threat to their manhood. The spouses provided the closest everyday support.  Conclusion:   The life situation of these patients can be understood as living in a ""state of readiness,"" expecting something to happen regarding their illness, and not always knowing where to get help.

Methods:   In the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden Follow-up Study, a nationwide cohort, we identified 6849 patients aged 70 years or younger. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis with local clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2002, a Gleason score of 7 or less, a serum PSA level of less than 20 ng/mL, and treatment with surveillance (including active surveillance and watchful waiting, n = 2021) or curative intent (including radical prostatectomy, n = 3399, and radiation therapy, n = 1429). Among the 6849 patients, 2686 had low-risk prostate cancer (ie, clinical stage T1, Gleason score 2-6, and serum PSA level of <10 ng/mL). The study cohort was linked to the Cause of Death Register, and cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer and competing causes was calculated.  Results:   For the combination of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancers, calculated cumulative 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality was 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7% to 4.8%) in the surveillance group and 2.7% (95% CI = 2.1% to 3.45) in the curative intent group. For those with low-risk disease, the corresponding values were 2.4% (95% CI = 1.2% to 4.1%) among the 1085 patients in the surveillance group and 0.7% (95% CI = 0.3% to 1.4%) among the 1601 patients in the curative intent group. The 10-year risk of dying from competing causes was 19.2% (95% CI = 17.2% to 21.3%) in the surveillance group and 10.2% (95% CI = 9.0% to 11.4%) in the curative intent group.

However, androgen ablation therapy often allows androgen-independent PC development, generally characterized by increased invasiveness. We previously reported that 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol (3beta-Adiol) inhibits the migration of PC cell lines via the estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) activation. Here, by combining in vitro assays and in vivo imaging approaches, we analyzed the effects of 3beta-Adiol on PC proliferation, migration, invasiveness, and metastasis in cultured cells and in xenografts using luciferase-labeled PC3 (PC3-Luc) cells. We found that 3beta-Adiol not only inhibits PC3-Luc cell migratory properties, but also induces a broader anti-tumor phenotype by decreasing the proliferation rate, increasing cell adhesion, and reducing invasive capabilities in vitro. All these 3beta-Adiol activities are mediated by ERbeta and cannot be reproduced by the physiological estrogen, 17beta-estradiol, suggesting the existence of different pathways activated by the two ERbeta ligands in PC3-Luc cells. In vivo, continuous administration of 3beta-Adiol reduces growth of established tumors and counteracts metastasis formation when PC3-Luc cells are engrafted s.c. in nude mice or are orthotopically injected into the prostate.

Here, we investigate whether vaccination against PSA induced immune responses to additional tumor-associated antigens and how this influenced clinical outcome.  Experimental design:   Pretreatment and posttreatment serum samples from patients treated with vaccine + external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) versus EBRT alone were evaluated by Western blot and serologic screening of a prostate cancer cDNA expression library (SEREX) to assess the development of treatment-associated autoantibody responses.  Results:   Western blotting revealed treatment-associated autoantibody responses in 15 of 33 (45.5%) patients treated with vaccine + EBRT versus 1 of 8 (12.5%) treated with EBRT alone. SEREX screening identified 18 antigens, which were assembled on an antigen array with 16 previously identified antigens. Antigen array screening revealed that 7 of 33 patients (21.2%) treated with vaccine + EBRT showed a vaccine-associated autoantibody response to four ubiquitously expressed self-antigens: DIRC2, NDUFS1, MRFAP1, and MATN2. These responses were not seen in patients treated with EBRT alone, or other control groups. Patients with autoantibody responses to this panel of antigens had a trend toward decreased biochemical-free survival.  Conclusions:   Vaccine + EBRT induced antigen spreading in a large proportion of patients. A subset of patients developed autoantibodies to a panel of four self-antigens and showed a trend toward inferior outcomes.

Although preclinical studies have provided encouragement, pioneering clinical trials using CAR-based immunotherapy have been disappointing. Key obstacles are the need for robust expansion ex vivo followed by sustained survival of infused T-cells in patients. To address this, we have developed a system to achieve selective proliferation of CAR(+) T-cells using IL-4, a cytokine with several pathophysiologic and therapeutic links to cancer. A chimeric cytokine receptor (4alphabeta) was engineered by fusion of the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ralpha) ectodomain to the beta(c) subunit, used by IL-2 and IL-15. Addition of IL-4 to T-cells that express 4alphabeta resulted in STAT3/STAT5/ERK phosphorylation and exponential proliferation, mimicking the actions of IL-2. Using receptor-selective IL-4 muteins, partnering of 4alphabeta with gamma(c) was implicated in signal delivery. Next, human T-cells were engineered to co-express 4alphabeta with a CAR specific for tumor-associated MUC1. These T-cells exhibited an unprecedented capacity to elicit repeated destruction of MUC1-expressing tumor cultures and expanded through several logs in vitro. Despite prolonged culture in IL-4, T-cells retained specificity for target antigen, type 1 polarity, and cytokine dependence. Similar findings were observed using CARs directed against two additional tumor-associated targets, demonstrating generality of application. Furthermore, this system allows rapid ex vivo expansion and enrichment of engineered T-cells from small blood volumes, under GMP-compliant conditions. Together, these findings provide proof of principle for the development of IL-4-enhanced T-cell immunotherapy of cancer.""","""['Scott Wilkie', 'Sophie E Burbridge', 'Laura Chiapero-Stanke', 'Ana C P Pereira', 'Siobhán Cleary', 'Sjoukje J C van der Stegen', 'James F Spicer', 'David M Davies', 'John Maher']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Different cytokine and stimulation conditions influence the expansion and immune phenotype of third-generation chimeric antigen receptor T cells specific for tumor antigen GD2.', 'Improving Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Modified T Cell Function by Reversing the Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment of Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Low interleukin-2 concentration favors generation of early memory T cells over effector phenotypes during chimeric antigen receptor T-cell expansion.', 'Chimeric antigen receptor engineering: a right step in the evolution of adoptive cellular immunotherapy.', 'Of CARs and TRUCKs: chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells engineered with an inducible cytokine to modulate the tumor stroma.', 'Recent advances and future perspectives of CAR-T cell therapy in head and neck cancer.', 'Novel chimeric antigen receptor T cell-based immunotherapy: a perspective for triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Intratumoral pan-ErbB targeted CAR-T for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: interim analysis of the T4 immunotherapy study.', 'The current landscape of CAR T-cell therapy for solid tumors: Mechanisms, research progress, challenges, and counterstrategies.', 'CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Ovarian Cancer: A Promising Cell Therapy.']"""

Presence of a combined 'frontal and vertex' baldness pattern at age 40 was associated with a decreased risk of PC (OR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.45-0.86). There were no significant associations between AA and aggressive PC.  Conclusions:   We did not find consistent positive associations between AA at different ages and PC.

Measurements could be done with an ionization chamber (IC) in the simulated prostate. The rectum was simulated by air-equivalent material (AEM). The volume superior to the IC placement was considered as the bladder. The extension of AEM volume could be varied. The vertical position of the IC placement could be shifted by ± 1 cm to simulate the prostate motion parallel to the changes in bladder volume. The reality of the simulation was inspected. Three-millimeter-slice-increment computed tomography (CT) scans were taken for irradiation planning. The structure set was adapted to the phantom from a treated patient. Planning target volume was delineated according to the RTOG 0126 study. IMRT and 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) plans were made. Prostate motion and rectum volume changes were simulated in the phantom. IC displacement was corrected by phantom shifting. The delivered dose was measured with IC in 7 cases using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and 3D-CRT fractions, and single square-shaped beams: anteroposterior (AP), posteroanterior (PA), and lateral (LAT). Variations from the calculated doses were slightly below 1% at IMRT and around 1% at 3D-CRT; below 4.5% at square AP beam; up to 9% at square PA beam; and around 0.5% at square LAT beam. Other authors have already shown that by using planning systems and ultrasonic and cone beam CT guidance, correction of organ motions in a real patient during prostate cancer IGRT does not have a significant dosimetric effect.

A secondary aim was to adapt the Late Effects of Normal Tissue (LENT) subjective toxicity questionnaire for use to collect Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) data, the current preferred platform for assessing radiation toxicity.  Materials and methods:   Three hundred and seventy-seven patients were treated with permanent iodine-125 seed implant brachytherapy for early prostate cancer. Toxicity data were collected before and at nine time points post-treatment (0-36 months). Compliance rates for patients completing individual items and item-subsection correlation coefficients were calculated. A factor analysis was carried out to analyse responses to the questionnaire and identify less informative questions, which could be removed. Cronbach's α coefficient was used to measure reliability.  Results:   Two thousand one hundred and eighty-eight questionnaires were analysed. There was poor compliance for questions specifically relating to operations and bowel medication. We found that the division of the questionnaire into subsections based on anatomical site was reasonable and that certain items could be safely removed. The high mean value for Cronbach's α across all questionnaires (0.752; 95% CI: 0.726-0.779) indicated that the questionnaire was reliable. Fifteen of the 44 questions were removed from the original questionnaires. Questions on urinary incontinence severity, management of urinary and bowel incontinence, effects of reduced flow of urine and the effects of symptoms on activity of daily living and change in sexual function were required to adapt the LENT subjective questionnaire for use to collect CTCAE data.  Conclusions:   A questionnaire, validated over 6 years to collect LENT subjective data were adapted and is a reliable approach for collecting CTCAE data after prostate brachytherapy.""","""['Damian J J Farnell', 'Paula Mandall', 'Carmel Anandadas', 'Jaqueline Routledge', 'Meriel P Burns', 'John P Logue', 'James P Wylie', 'Ric Swindell', 'Jac Livsey', 'Catharine M L West', 'Susan E Davidson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Median 5 year follow-up of 125iodine brachytherapy as monotherapy in men aged<or=55 years with favorable prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy of data capture for patient-reported toxicity following radiotherapy for prostate or cervical cancer.', 'Rectal toxicity profile after transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy: use of a comprehensive toxicity scoring system and identification of rectal dosimetric toxicity predictors.', 'Combined brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: reduced morbidity with an intraoperative brachytherapy planning technique and supplemental intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Iodine seed prostate brachytherapy: an alternative first-line choice for early prostate cancer.', 'A Deep Learning Approach Validates Genetic Risk Factors for Late Toxicity After Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy in a REQUITE Multi-National Cohort.', 'The ALERT-B questionnaire: A screening tool for the detection of gastroenterological late effects after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'eRAPID electronic patient self-Reporting of Adverse-events: Patient Information and aDvice: a pilot study protocol in pelvic radiotherapy.', 'Temporal patterns of patient-reported trismus and associated mouth-opening distances in radiotherapy for head and neck cancer: A prospective cohort study.', 'A Factor Analysis Approach for Clustering Patient Reported Outcomes.']"""

High expressions of androgen receptor (AR) and genes involved in androgen metabolism indicate a continued role for AR in castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs). There is increasing evidence that some amounts of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and other androgens are present sufficiently to activate AR within CRPC tissues, and enzymes involved in the androgen and steroid metabolism, such as 5alpha-steroid reductases, are activated in CRPCs. In this report, we screened eight natural 5alphaDH-steroids to search for novel products of 5alpha-steroid reductases, and identified 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) as a novel substrate for 5alpha-steroid reductases in CRPCs. 11-Deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and 5alpha-dihydro-deoxycorticosterone (5alphaDH-DOC) could promote prostate cancer cell proliferation through AR activation, and type 1 5alpha-steroid reductase (SRD5A1) could convert from DOC to 5alphaDH-DOC. Sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analysis detected 5alphaDH-DOC in some clinical CRPC tissues.

Method:   Associations between hospital procedure volume and cancer survival were analyzed using the population-based cancer registry survival data for Fukui prefecture between 1994 and 1998. Firstly the cancer patients who received primary treatments for each target sites such as esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, ovary, prostate, urinary bladder, and lymphoid tissue were totaled. Then, hospitals were divided into 4 categories according to the number of patients by each site; high, medium, low and very low volume. Stage-matched 5-year relative survival rates for each site were then calculated for each categorized hospital volume, and that most desirable for medical treatment for each target site was decided with reference to age-, sex-, and cancer stage-adjusted hazard ratios. Age-adjusted morality reduction was estimated by the expected survival rate after centralization when all cancer patients had received treatments.  Results:   The 5-year relative survival rates were higher in hospitals with large numbers of patients. With some target sites, such as the stomach, colon, and breast, the mortality was similar between high and low volume hospitals, whereas the other target sites showed higher mortality in line with decrease in number of patients treated. It was estimated that a 2.06% reduction in the mortality rate might be achieved if each case were treated at the most desirable category of hospital in Fukui prefecture.

DHC and fisetin (1-50 microM) caused a dose-dependent reduction in viability, a concomitant increase in apoptosis in PC3 cells at 72 h, and a decrease in clonogenic survival at 24 h treatment. DHC was considerably more potent than fisetin in these cytotoxicity assays. The mechanism of accelerated cellular senescence was not activated by either compound in PC3 or lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cells. Gene expression alterations in PC3 and LNCaP cells treated with 15 muM DHC and 25 microM fisetin for 6 to 24 h were determined by oligonucleotide array. Amongst the most highly represented functional categories of genes altered by both compounds was the cell cycle category. In total, 100 cell cycle genes were altered by DHC and fisetin including 27 genes with key functions in G2/M phase that were downregulated by both compounds. Other functional categories altered included chromosome organization, apoptosis, and stress response.

In order to determine its efficacy on human reproductive cancers, we assessed the responses of two human breast cancer cell lines, estrogen sensitive MCF7 and estrogen insensitive MDA-MB-231, and of two human prostate cancer cell lines, androgen sensitive LNCaP and androgen insensitive PC3 which are human cell lines that represent early and late stage reproductive cancers. BZL101 inhibited reproductive cancer growth in all cell lines by regulating expression levels of key cell cycle components that differ with respect to the cancer cell phenotypes. In early stage estrogen sensitive MCF7 cells, BZL101 induced a G₁ cell cycle arrest and ablated expression of key G₁ cell cycle regulators Cyclin D1, CDK2 and CDK4, as well as growth factor stimulatory pathways and estrogen receptor-α expression. Transfection of luciferase reporter plasmids revealed that the loss of CDK2, CDK4 and estrogen receptor-α transcript expression resulted from the BZL-dependent ablation of promoter activities. BZL101 growth arrests early stage androgen sensitive LNCaP cells in the G₂/M phase with corresponding decreases in Cyclin B1, CDK1 and androgen receptor expression. In late stage hormone insensitive breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC3) cancer cells, BZL101 induced an S phase arrest with corresponding ablations in Cyclin A2 and CDK2 expression.

We have recently designed and synthesized a novel dansylated analog of purvalanol B, termed VMY-1-103, that inhibited cell cycle progression in breast cancer cell lines more effectively than did purvalanol B and allowed for uptake analyses by fluorescence microscopy. ErbB-2 plays an important role in the regulation of signal transduction cascades in a number of epithelial tumors, including prostate cancer (PCa). Our previous studies demonstrated that transgenic expression of activated ErbB-2 in the mouse prostate initiated PCa and either the overexpression of ErbB-2 or the addition of the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 ligand, heregulin (HRG), induced cell cycle progression in the androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. In the present study, we tested the efficacy of VMY-1-103 in inhibiting HRG-induced cell proliferation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. At concentrations as low as 1 μM, VMY-1-103 increased both the proportion of cells in G(1) and p21(CIP1) protein levels. At higher concentrations (5 μM or 10 μM), VMY-1-103 induced apoptosis via decreased mitochondrial membrane polarity and induction of p53 phosphorylation, caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage. Treatment with 10 μM Purvalanol B failed to either influence proliferation or induce apoptosis.

The SHIM had the greatest negative skew and ceiling effect (P < .001). Although high scores on either the EPIC-SF or PCI-SF translated reliably to high SHIM scores, the reverse was not true. Subjects who reported no erectile dysfunction (ED) on the SHIM (>or=22) had diverse overall SF, whereas those who scored highly on the EPIC-SF or PCI-SF had both excellent erectile function (potency) and overall SF (including orgasmic function, erectile function, and sexual desire). EPIC-SF scores >or=65 and PCI-SF scores >or=75 define men that are both potent and have good SF.  Conclusions:   The SHIM is intended as an instrument to assess ED.

We investigated the effect and underlying mechanism of a naturally-occurring Wnt inhibitor, WIF1, on the growth and cellular invasiveness of a bone metastatic PCa cell line, PC3.  Results:   The WIF1 gene promoter was hypermethylated and its expression down-regulated in the majority (7 of 8) of PCa cell lines. Restoration of WIF1 expression in PC-3 cells resulted in a decreased cell motility and invasiveness via up-regulation of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, Keratin-8 and-18), down-regulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Fibronectin and Vimentin) and decreased activity of MMP-2 and -9. PC3 cells transfected with WIF1 consistently demonstrated reduced expression of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) transcription factors, Slug and Twist, and a change in morphology from mesenchymal to epithelial. Moreover, WIF1 expression significantly reduced tumor growth by approximately 63% in a xenograft mouse model. This was accompanied by an increased expression of E-cadherin and Keratin-18 and a decreased expression of vimentin in tumor tissues.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that WIF1 regulates tumor invasion through EMT process and thus, may play an important role in controlling metastatic disease in PCa patients.

To address this topic, we selected a group of patients representing a substantial weight loss starting at a defined time, ie, patients submitted to obesity surgery. We hypothesized that risk of obesity-related cancer decreases with time after obesity surgery.  Summary background data:   A nationwide, population-based cohort study of obesity surgery in 1980-2006 as registered in the Swedish Patient Register. New cancers were identified through the Swedish Cancer Register. Cohort members' observed total number of overall obesity-related cancers and groups of obesity-related cancer (breast, prostate, colorectal, endometrial, kidney) were divided by the expected numbers, representing the baseline risk, thus calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Time trends of SIR after obesity surgery were the main outcome measure.  Results:   Among a total of 13,123 obesity surgery patients, contributing with 125,049 person-years of follow-up, 296 new cases of obesity-related cancer were identified. There was no overall decrease in SIR of obesity-related cancer with increased time after obesity surgery (P for trend 0.40). Similarly, no statistically significant trends with follow-up time were found for cancer of the breast (P = 0.60), prostate (P = 0.34), endometrium (P = 0.83), or kidney (P = 0.42), while the risk of colorectal cancer increased with time (P for trend 0.01) after obesity surgery.

The 2D fluence maps are decomposed into 1D fluence profiles according to each leaf pair position. Second, a mixed integer linear model is used to construct the leaf motions of an arc delivery that reproduce the 1D fluence profile previously derived from the static gantry IMRT optimization. The multi-leaf collimator (MLC) sequence takes into account the starting and ending leaf positions in between the neighbouring apertures, such that the MLC segments of the entire treatment plan are deliverable in a continuous arc. Since both steps in the algorithm use linear models, implementation is simple and straightforward.

Purpose:   The purpose of this article is to describe the development and implementation of a recruitment plan and evaluate the different recruitment strategies for a prostate cancer behavioral intervention trial.  Methods:   Our recruitment plan was based on a framework (The Heiney-Adams Recruitment Model) that we developed, which combines relationship building and social marketing. We evaluated the success of our model using several different recruitment sources including: mailed letters, physician referral, and self-referral.  Results:   Recruitment rates ranged from 67% for a support services department mailing to 100% for physician referral. While our original list of contacted patients was comprised of only 13% African American (AA) men, 22% of our recruited participants were AA.  Limitations:   One of the strongest barriers to recruitment was strict patient eligibility. Another significant barrier was the lack of electronic records systems to allow for the identification of large numbers of potential participants.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, our model incorporating social marketing and relationship building was quite successful in recruiting for a prostate cancer behavioral study, particularly AA participants.

An issue of concern was the substantial level of 'contamination', or use of PSA and DRE in control arm men.  Purpose:   To provide a detailed description of contamination in PLCO.  Methods:   Surveys inquiring about the most recent PSA and DRE use were given to a sample of control arm men throughout the screening phase of PLCO (years 0-5). A probability model was utilized to translate survey results into actual frequency counts of tests. To assess the impact of contamination, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End  Results:   (SEER) incidence rates from the pre-screening era (1985-1987) as well as contemporaneous rates, were applied to PLCO person-years of observation. Results Of 38,350 control arm men, 2427 were surveyed. Pre-trial screening and college education were statistically significantly associated with increased contamination rates. The estimated mean number of screening PSAs (DREs) in the control arm was 2.7 (1.1); this compares to 5.0 (3.5) in the screened arm. 1984 and 2538 prostate cancers were observed in the control and screened arms, respectively, during the screening phase. In the absence of screening, 960 and 949 would have been expected; with contemporaneous incidence rates, 1630 and 1611 were expected.  Limitations:   Due to the limitations of the surveys, in terms of both reach and scope, the exact level of PSA and DRE use in control arm men cannot be known.  Conclusions:   Use of prostate screening by control arm men was substantial, but also substantially less than in screened arm men.

Albeit effective in extending survival, ADT is associated with dose-limiting toxicity and the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after prolonged use. Because CRPC is lethal and incurable, developing effective strategies to enhance the efficacy of ADT and circumvent resistance becomes an urgent task. Continuous AR signaling constitutes one major mechanism underlying the development of CRPC. The present study showed that methylseleninic acid (MSA), an agent that effectively reduces AR abundance, could enhance the cancer-killing efficacy of the anti-androgen bicalutamide in androgen-dependent and CRPC cells. We found that the combination of MSA and bicalutamide produced a robust downregulation of prostate-specific antigen and a recently identified AR target, telomerase, and its catalytic subunit, human telomerase reverse transcriptase. The downregulation of hTERT occurs mainly at the transcriptional level, and reduced AR occupancy of the promoter contributes to downregulation. Furthermore, apoptosis induction by the two agents is significantly mitigated by the restoration of hTERT. Our findings thus indicate that MSA in combination with anti-androgen could represent a viable approach to improve the therapeutic outcome of ADT. Given the critical role of hTERT/telomerase downregulation in mediating the combination effect and the fact that hTERT/telomerase could be measured in blood and urine, hTERT/telomerase could serve as an ideal tumor-specific biomarker to monitor the efficacy of the combination therapy noninvasively.""","""['Shuang Liu', 'Yanfeng Qi', 'Yubin Ge', 'Tamika Duplessis', 'Brian G Rowan', 'Clement Ip', 'Helen Cheng', 'Paul S Rennie', 'Izumi Horikawa', 'Arthur J Lustig', 'Qun Yu', 'Haitao Zhang', 'Yan Dong']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Metformin represses androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancers by targeting androgen receptor.', 'Differential androgen deprivation therapies with anti-androgens casodex/bicalutamide or MDV3100/Enzalutamide versus anti-androgen receptor ASC-J9(R) Lead to promotion versus suppression of prostate cancer metastasis.', 'A competitive inhibitor that reduces recruitment of androgen receptor to androgen-responsive genes.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Starving the addiction: new opportunities for durable suppression of AR signaling in prostate cancer.', 'TGF-β controls stromal telomere length through epigenetic modifications.', 'Hormonal regulation of telomerase activity and hTERT expression in steroid-regulated tissues and cancer.', 'Antithetic hTERT Regulation by Androgens in Prostate Cancer Cells: hTERT Inhibition Is Mediated by the ING1 and ING2 Tumor Suppressors.', 'Androgen Receptor-Dependent Mechanisms Mediating Drug Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'SLX4IP Promotes Telomere Maintenance in Androgen Receptor-Independent Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer through ALT-like Telomeric PML Localization.']"""

However, the underlying mechanism of PEITC-induced cell death is not fully understood. Using LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells as a model, we demonstrate that the PEITC-induced cell death is initiated by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Exposure of LNCaP and PC-3 cells to pharmacologic concentrations of PEITC resulted in ROS production, which correlated with inhibition of complex III activity, suppression of OXPHOS, and ATP depletion. These effects were not observed in a representative normal human prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC). The ROS production by PEITC treatment was not influenced by cyclosporin A. The Rho-0 variants of LNCaP and PC-3 cells were more resistant to PEITC-mediated ROS generation, apoptotic DNA fragmentation, and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential compared with respective wild-type cells. The PEITC treatment resulted in activation of Bax in wild-type LNCaP and PC-3 cells, but not in their respective Rho-0 variants. Furthermore, RNA interference of Bax and Bak conferred significant protection against PEITC-induced apoptosis. The Rho-0 variants of LNCaP and PC-3 cells also resisted PEITC-mediated autophagy.

Here, we report that Etk is upregulated in both human and mouse prostates in response to androgen ablation. Etk expression seems to be differentially regulated by androgen and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which is possibly mediated by the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells. Our immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays containing 112 human prostate tumor samples revealed that Etk expression is elevated in hormone-resistant prostate cancer and positively correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of AR (Pearson correlation coefficient rho = 0.71, P < 0.0001). AR tyrosine phosphorylation is increased in Etk-overexpressing cells, suggesting that Etk may be another tyrosine kinase, in addition to Src and Ack-1, which can phosphorylate AR. We also showed that Etk can directly interact with AR through its Src homology 2 domain, and such interaction may prevent the association of AR with Mdm2, leading to stabilization of AR under androgen-depleted conditions. Overexpression of Etk in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells promotes tumor growth while knocking down Etk expression in hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cells by a specific shRNA that inhibits tumor growth under androgen-depleted conditions. Taken together, our data suggest that Etk may be a component of the adaptive compensatory mechanism activated by androgen ablation in prostate and may play a role in hormone resistance, at least in part, through direct modulation of the AR signaling pathway.""","""['Bojie Dai', 'Hege Chen', 'Shengjie Guo', 'Xi Yang', 'Douglas E Linn', 'Feng Sun', 'Wei Li', 'Zhiyong Guo', 'Kexin Xu', 'Oekyung Kim', 'Xiangtian Kong', 'Jonathan Melamed', 'Shaopeng Qiu', 'Hegang Chen', 'Yun Qiu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['A novel androgen receptor splice variant is up-regulated during prostate cancer progression and promotes androgen depletion-resistant growth.', 'Neuropeptide-induced androgen independence in prostate cancer cells: roles of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Etk/Bmx, Src, and focal adhesion kinase.', 'Nrdp1-mediated regulation of ErbB3 expression by the androgen receptor in androgen-dependent but not castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting tyrosine kinases and autophagy in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor involvement in the progression of prostate cancer.', 'Saracatinib synergizes with enzalutamide to downregulate AR activity in CRPC.', 'A phosphorylation switch controls androgen biosynthesis in prostate cancer.', 'BMX controls 3βHSD1 and sex steroid biosynthesis in cancer.', 'Structural and biophysical insights into the mode of covalent binding of rationally designed potent BMX inhibitors.', 'Emerging Kinase Therapeutic Targets in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Pancreatic Cancer Desmoplasia.']"""

ACF prevalence and mean count at year 1 (61% and 1.93, respectively), were only slightly lower than the corresponding values at year 0 (69% and 2.25, respectively). The locations of ACF at year 1 and baseline were significantly correlated. Of 96 ACF assessed for histology, 70 (73%) were hyperplastic and none were dysplastic. After removal of ACF at baseline, ACF counts 1 year later were only slightly reduced and were significantly correlated with the baseline ACF count.

With the advent of digital pathology, computer-aided algorithms can now be applied to disease detection on digitized glass slides. The size of these digitized histology images (hundreds of millions of pixels) presents a formidable challenge for any computerized image analysis program. In this paper, we present a boosted Bayesian multiresolution (BBMR) system to identify regions of CaP on digital biopsy slides. Such a system would serve as an important preceding step to a Gleason grading algorithm, where the objective would be to score the invasiveness and severity of the disease. In the first step, our algorithm decomposes the whole-slide image into an image pyramid comprising multiple resolution levels. Regions identified as cancer via a Bayesian classifier at lower resolution levels are subsequently examined in greater detail at higher resolution levels, thereby allowing for rapid and efficient analysis of large images. At each resolution level, ten image features are chosen from a pool of over 900 first-order statistical, second-order co-occurrence, and Gabor filter features using an AdaBoost ensemble method. The BBMR scheme, operating on 100 images obtained from 58 patients, yielded: 1) areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84, 0.83, and 0.76, respectively, at the lowest, intermediate, and highest resolution levels and 2) an eightfold savings in terms of computational time compared to running the algorithm directly at full (highest) resolution. The BBMR model outperformed (in terms of AUC): 1) individual features (no ensemble) and 2) a random forest classifier ensemble obtained by bagging multiple decision tree classifiers. The apparent drop-off in AUC at higher image resolutions is due to lack of fine detail in the expert annotation of CaP and is not an artifact of the classifier. The implicit feature selection done via the AdaBoost component of the BBMR classifier reveals that different classes and types of image features become more relevant for discriminating between CaP and benign areas at different image resolutions.""","""['Scott Doyle', 'Michael Feldman', 'John Tomaszewski', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Biomed Eng""","""['Automated detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution ex vivo MRI.', 'Computer-aided prognosis: predicting patient and disease outcome via quantitative fusion of multi-scale, multi-modal data.', 'Ensemble based system for whole-slide prostate cancer probability mapping using color texture features.', 'Utility of whole slide imaging and virtual microscopy in prostate pathology.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Removing androgen systemically causes vascular degeneration and nutrient depletion of the prostate tumor tissue. The fact that the malignancy later evolves to androgen-independence suggests that some cancer cells are able to survive the challenge of energy/nutrient deprivation. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important manager of energy stress. The present study was designed to investigate the role of AMPK in contributing to the survival of the androgen-independent phenotype. Most of the experiments were carried out in the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and the androgen-independent C4-2 cells. These two cell lines have the same genetic background, since the C4-2 line is derived from the LNCaP line. Glucose deprivation (GD) was instituted to model energy stress encountered by these cells. The key findings are as follows. First, the activation of AMPK by GD was much stronger in C4-2 cells than in LNCaP cells, and the robustness of AMPK activation was correlated favorably with cell viability. Second, the response of AMPK was specific to energy deficiency rather than to amino acid deficiency. The activation of AMPK by GD was functional, as demonstrated by appropriate phosphorylation changes of mTOR and mTOR downstream substrates. Third, blocking AMPK activation by chemical inhibitor or dominant negative AMPK led to increased apoptotic cell death. The observation that similar results were found in other androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines, including CW22Rv1 abd VCaP, provided further assurance that AMPK is a facilitator on the road to androgen-independence of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Rishi Raj Chhipa', 'Yue Wu', 'James L Mohler', 'Clement Ip']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['AMPK-mediated autophagy is a survival mechanism in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells subjected to androgen deprivation and hypoxia.', 'Androgens regulate prostate cancer cell growth via an AMPK-PGC-1α-mediated metabolic switch.', ""Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase by 3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is associated with human prostate cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo."", ""Targeting the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and related metabolic pathways for the treatment of prostate cancer."", 'The multifaceted activities of AMPK in tumor progression--why the ""one size fits all"" definition does not fit at all?', 'Glucose Starvation Inhibits Ferroptosis by Activating the LKB1/AMPK Signaling Pathway and Promotes the High Speed Linear Motility of Dairy Goat Sperm.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Energy-Stress-Mediated AMPK Activation Promotes GPX4-Dependent Ferroptosis through the JAK2/STAT3/P53 Axis in Renal Cancer.', ""AMPK's double-faced role in advanced stages of prostate cancer."", 'Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.']"""

Implantations were performed under transrectal ultrasound guidance, and the prescription dose was 145 Gy. A CT and MRI scan of the pelvis were performed 1 month after implantation for dosimetric study.  Results:   Compared with non-small PV patients, patients with small PV experienced larger 1-month edema (p<0.001); lower dose to 90% (the isodose enclosing 90% of PV and representing a minimum dose to that volume of the prostate [D(90)]) of the prostate (p=0.03); higher intracapsular seed density (p<0.001); and were less likely to achieve D(90)>or=140 Gy (p=0.013) in a postimplant dosimetric study.

Materials and methods:   VMAT and S&S plans (RX 18MV) were created and compared (Wilcoxon test) for 10 patients.

For one patient, the two techniques were compared for dose painting and escalation in target volumes defined on MRI and registered thanks to intraprostatic fiducials.  Results:   VMAT, compared to S&S, offered: an increase of the PTV2s (prostate) volume receiving 77 to 80 Gy and a decrease of V(82) and V(83); a decrease of V(4) to V(6), V(16) to V(23), and V(69) to V(73) for the rectal wall; a decrease of V(25) for the bladder wall; a decrease of V(21) to V(43) for the femoral heads; a decrease of V(26) to V(44) and V(72) to V(80) but an increase of V(1) to V(21) and V(49) to V(60) for the healthy tissues.

Our current feature set consists of 113 gene probes for 104 unique genes, originally identified as differentially expressed in solid primary tumors in microarray data on Affymetrix HG-U133A platform in five tissue types: breast, colon, lung, prostate and ovary. For each dataset, we first identified a set of genes significantly differentially expressed in tumor vs. normal tissue at p-value = 0.05 using an experimentally derived error model. Our common cancer gene panel is the intersection of these sets of significantly dysregulated genes and can distinguish tumors from normal tissue on all these five tissue types.  Methods:   Frozen tumor specimens were obtained from two commercial vendors Clinomics (Pittsfield, MA) and Asterand (Detroit, MI). Biotinylated targets were prepared using published methods (Affymetrix, CA) and hybridized to Affymetrix U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix, CA). Expression values for each gene were calculated using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis software MAS 5.0. We then used a software package called Genes@Work for differential expression discovery, and SVM light linear kernel for building classification models.  Results:   We validate the predictability of this gene list on several publicly available data sets generated on the same platform. Of note, when analysing the lung cancer data set of Spira et al, using an SVM linear kernel classifier, our gene panel had 94.7% leave-one-out accuracy compared to 87.8% using the gene panel in the original paper. In addition, we performed high-throughput validation on the Dana Farber Cancer Institute GCOD database and several GEO datasets.  Conclusions:   Our result showed the potential for this panel as a robust classification tool for multiple tumor types on the Affymetrix platform, as well as other whole genome arrays. Apart from possible use in diagnosis of early tumorigenesis, some other potential uses of our methodology and gene panel would be in assisting pathologists in diagnosis of pre-cancerous lesions, determining tumor boundaries, assessing levels of contamination in cell populations in vitro and identifying transformations in cell cultures after multiple passages. Moreover, based on the robustness of this gene panel in identifying normal vs. tumor, mislabelled or misinterpreted samples can be pinpointed with high confidence.""","""['Joseph Irgon', 'C Chris Huang', 'Yi Zhang', 'Dmitri Talantov', 'Gyan Bhanot', 'Sándor Szalma']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The effect of oligonucleotide microarray data pre-processing on the analysis of patient-cohort studies.', 'A genomic and transcriptomic approach for a differential diagnosis between primary and secondary ovarian carcinomas in patients with a previous history of breast cancer.', 'Integration of RNA-Seq data with heterogeneous microarray data for breast cancer profiling.', 'Transcriptomes for serial analysis of gene expression.', 'Detection call algorithms for high-throughput gene expression microarray data.', 'MTM: a multi-task learning framework to predict individualized tissue gene expression profiles.', 'tranSMART: An Open Source Knowledge Management and High Content Data Analytics Platform.', 'Personalized medicine in screening for malignant disease: a review of methods and applications.', 'Effective knowledge management in translational medicine.']"""

Most of these variants, like other GWAS association signals, are located in non-coding regions of potential candidate genes, and thus could act at the level of the mRNA transcript.  Methods:   We measured the expression and isoform usage of seven prostate cancer candidate genes in benign and malignant prostate by real-time PCR, and correlated these factors with cancer status and genotype at the GWAS risk variants.  Results:   We determined that levels of LMTK2 transcripts in prostate adenocarcinomas were only 32% of those in benign tissues (p = 3.2 x 10(-7)), and that an independent effect of genotype at variant rs6465657 on LMTK2 expression in benign (n = 39) and malignant tissues (n = 21) was also evident (P = 0.002). We also identified that whilst HNF1B(C) and MSMB2 comprised the predominant isoforms in benign tissues (90% and 98% of total HNF1B or MSMB expression), HNF1B(B) and MSMB1 were predominant in malignant tissue (95% and 96% of total HNF1B or MSMB expression; P = 1.7 x 10(-7) and 4 x 10(-4) respectively), indicating major shifts in isoform usage.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that the amount or nature of mRNA transcripts expressed from the LMTK2, HNF1B and MSMB candidate genes is altered in prostate cancer, and provides further evidence for a role for these genes in this disorder.

The thickness of the anterior perirectal fat tissue (APFT) was measured by transrectal ultrasonography. Treatment was considered to have failed in the case of biochemical failure according to the Phoenix definition, positive follow-up biopsy or initiation of salvage therapy.

We used the expression of genes recently associated with host immune responses (T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity, inflammation, and immune suppression) to perform hierarchical clustering of multiple large cohorts of cancer specimens to determine if immune-related gene expression resulted in clinical significant groupings of tumors. Microarray data from prostate cancer (n = 79), breast cancer (n = 132), lung cancer (n = 84), glioblastoma multiforme (n = 120), and lymphoma (n = 127) were analyzed. Among adenocarcinomas, the T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity genes were consistently associated with better prognosis, while genes associated with inflammation and immune suppression were variably associated with outcome. Specifically, increased expression of the T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity genes was associated with good prognosis in breast cancer patients under 45 years of age (p = .04, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.42) and in prostate cancer patients (p = .03, HR = 0.36) but not in lung cancer patients (p = 0.45, HR = 1.37). In lymphoma, patients with increased expression of inflammation and immune suppression genes had better prognosis than those expressing the T(H1)-mediated adaptive immunity genes (p = .01, HR = 0.43) and in glioblastoma multiforme, the expression of inflammation genes conferred improved prognosis than those expressing immune suppression genes (p = 0.05, HR = 0.62).

We amplified immunoprecipitated DNA by conventional PCR and in the -following step we used the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis coupled with quantitative PCR for monitoring NaB induced formation of AR-SMRT/N-CoR complex binding on the PSA promoter. The co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed increase in AR-SMRT formation in NaB treated cells. Simultaneously, the Western blot analysis showed a significant decrease in AR protein expression. In conclusion, the inhibitory effect of NaB on AR gene expression seems to be specific and unique for prostate cancer AR-positive cell lines and corresponds with its ability to stimulate AR-SMRT complex formation.

For this purpose, BMI1 was silenced in 2 PC cell lines (LNCaP and DU 145). Cell proliferation and apoptosis after docetaxel treatment were measured. Guanine oxidation was assessed by in-cell western. Global gene expression analysis was performed on BMI1 silenced cells. Oncomine database was used to compare in vitro data with gene expression in PC samples. BMI1 silencing had no effect on cell proliferation but significantly enhanced docetaxel-induced antitumor activity. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that BMI1 silencing downregulates a set of antioxidant genes. Docetaxel treatment increased guanine oxidation, whereas the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine rescued docetaxel-induced cell death. Examination of clinical datasets revealed a positive correlation of BMI1 and antioxidant gene expression. BMI1-controlled antioxidant genes were predictive of poor prognosis in PC patients.

Methods:   Invasive cancers of the five major sites diagnosed from 1998 to 2002 (n = 376,158) in California were included in the study. Composite area-based SES measures were used to quantify SES level and to calculate cancer incidence rates stratified by SES. Relative index of inequality (RII) was generated to measure SES gradient of cancer incidence within each racial/ethnic group.  Results:   Significant variations were detected in SES disparities across the racial/ethnic groups for all five major cancer sites. Female breast cancer and prostate cancer incidence increased with increased SES in all groups, with the trend strongest among Hispanics. Incidence of cervical cancer increased with decreased SES, with the largest gradient among non-Hispanic white women. Lung cancer incidence increased with decreased SES with the exception of Hispanic men and women, for whom SES gradient was in the opposite direction. For colorectal cancer, higher incidence was associated with lower SES in non-Hispanic whites but with higher SES in Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islander women.

We investigated absolute and relative CVD risk in 76,600 patients with PC undergoing ET, curative treatment, or surveillance.  Methods:   PCBaSe Sweden is based on the National Prostate Cancer Register, which covers more than 96% of PC cases. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of ischemic heart disease (IHD), acute myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke were calculated to compare observed and expected (using total Swedish population) numbers of CVD, taking into account age, calendar time, and previous CVD.  Results:   Between 1997 and 2007, 30,642 patients with PC received primary ET, 26,432 curative treatment, and 19,527 surveillance. SIRs for CVD were elevated in all men with the highest for those undergoing ET, independent of circulatory disease history (SIR MI for men without circulatory disease history: 1.40 [95% CI, 1.31 to 1.49], 1.15 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.31], and 1.20 [95% CI, 1.11 to 1.30] for men undergoing ET, curative treatment, and surveillance, respectively). Absolute risk differences (ARD) showed that two (arrhythmia) to eight (IHD) extra cases of CVD would occur per 1,000 person-years. SMRs showed similar patterns, with ARD of zero (arrhythmia) to three (IHD) per 1,000 person-years.  Conclusion:   Increased relative risks of nonfatal and fatal CVD were found among all men with PC, especially those treated with ET. Because ET is currently the only effective treatment for metastatic disease and the ARDs were rather small, our findings indicate that CVD risk should be considered when prescribing ET but should not constitute a contraindication when the expected gain is tangible.""","""['Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'Hans Garmo', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Erik Ingelsson', 'Ola Bratt', 'Anna Bill-Axelson', 'Mats Lambe', 'Pär Stattin', 'Jan Adolfsson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Incidence of fractures causing hospitalisation in prostate cancer patients: results from the population-based PCBaSe Sweden.', 'Risk of cardiovascular mortality in prostate cancer patients in the Rotterdam randomized screening trial.', 'Ischemic heart disease and stroke before and during endocrine treatment for prostate cancer in PCBaSe Sweden.', 'Multiple events of fractures and cardiovascular and thromboembolic disease following prostate cancer diagnosis: results from the population-based PCBaSe Sweden.', 'Increased risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Cardiovascular outcomes after curative prostate cancer treatment: A population-based cohort study.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy with leuprolide increases abdominal adiposity without causing cardiac dysfunction in middle-aged male mice: effect of sildenafil.', 'The Burden of Uncontrolled Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Men\xa0With\xa0Prostate Cancer: A RADICAL-PC Analysis.', 'Higher risk of cardiovascular mortality than cancer mortality among long-term cancer survivors.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment and ischemic heart disease among female patients with breast cancer: A cohort study.']"""

The estrogenic insecticide chlordecone was used extensively in the French West Indies, contaminating the population for more than 30 years. We analyzed the relationship between exposure to chlordecone and the risk of prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   We investigated 623 men with prostate cancer and 671 controls. Exposure was analyzed according to case-control status, using either current plasma concentration or a cumulative exposure index based on years of exposure. We genotyped two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3829125 and rs17134592) in the gene encoding chlordecone reductase.  Results:   We found a significant increase in the risk of prostate cancer with increasing plasma chlordecone concentration (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.58 for the highest tertile of values above the limit of detection [LD]; P trend = .002) and for cumulative exposure index (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.88 for the highest quartile; P trend = .004). Stronger associations were observed among those with a positive family history of prostate cancer and among those who had lived in a Western country. The rs3829125 and rs17134592 allele variants were in complete linkage disequilibrium and were found at low frequency (0.04). Among subjects with plasma chlordecone concentrations above the LD, carriers of the allele variants had a higher risk of prostate cancer (OR, 5.23; 95% CI, 0.82 to 33.32).  Conclusion:   These findings support the hypothesis that exposure to environmental estrogens increases the risk of prostate cancer.""","""['Luc Multigner', 'Jean Rodrigue Ndong', 'Arnaud Giusti', 'Marc Romana', 'Helene Delacroix-Maillard', 'Sylvaine Cordier', 'Bernard Jégou', 'Jean Pierre Thome', 'Pascal Blanchet']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Dietary intake of phytoestrogens, estrogen receptor-beta polymorphisms and the risk of prostate cancer.', 'Estrogen receptor beta polymorphism is associated with prostate cancer risk.', 'Germ-line genetic variation in the key androgen-regulating genes androgen receptor, cytochrome P450, and steroid-5-alpha-reductase type 2 is important for prostate cancer development.', 'Sequence variants in Toll-like receptor gene cluster (TLR6-TLR1-TLR10) and prostate cancer risk.', 'Estrogenic activity of the insecticide chlordecone in the reproductive tract of birds and mammals.', 'Pesticides and Bladder Cancer: Mechanisms Leading to Anti-Cancer Drug Chemoresistance and New Chemosensitization Strategies.', 'Prenatal and childhood chlordecone exposure, cognitive abilities and problem behaviors in 7-year-old children: the TIMOUN mother-child cohort in Guadeloupe.', 'Cytotoxicity Mechanisms of Eight Major Herbicide Active Ingredients in Comparison to Their Commercial Formulations.', 'Effects of genotype and food on naltrexone exposure in adolescents.', 'Interplay between Prostate Cancer and Adipose Microenvironment: A Complex and Flexible Scenario.']"""

Although prostate cancer cells undergo apoptosis in response to phorbol ester stimulation via PKCdelta-mediated release of death factors, the involvement of PKCepsilon in this response is not known. PKCepsilon depletion by RNAi or expression of a dominant negative kinase-dead PKCepsilon mutant potentiated the apoptotic response of PMA and sensitized LNCaP cells to the death receptor ligand TNFalpha. On the other hand, overexpression of PKCepsilon by adenoviral means protected LNCaP cells against apoptotic stimuli. Interestingly, PKCepsilon RNAi depletion significantly enhanced the release of TNFalpha in response to PMA and greatly potentiated JNK activation by this cytokine. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that PMA fails to promote phosphorylation of Bad in Ser(112) in PKCepsilon-depleted LNCaP cells, whereas PKCepsilon overexpression greatly enhanced Bad phosphorylation. This effect was independent of Akt, ERK, or p90Rsk, well established kinases for Ser(112) in Bad. Moreover, expression of a S112A-Bad mutant potentiated PMA-induced apoptosis. Finally, we found that upon activation PKCepsilon accumulated in mitochondrial fractions in LNCaP cells and that Bad was a substrate of PKCepsilon in vitro. Our results established that PKCepsilon modulates survival in prostate cancer cells via multiple pathways.""","""['John Meshki', 'M Cecilia Caino', 'Vivian A von Burstin', 'Erin Griner', 'Marcelo G Kazanietz']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Overexpression of PKCepsilon sensitizes LNCaP human prostate cancer cells to induction of apoptosis by bryostatin 1.', 'PKC-mediated secretion of death factors in LNCaP prostate cancer cells is regulated by androgens.', 'A protein kinase C/protein kinase D pathway protects LNCaP prostate cancer cells from phorbol ester-induced apoptosis by promoting ERK1/2 and NF-{kappa}B activities.', 'Molecular mechanisms of protein kinase C-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Protein kinase Cepsilon and development of squamous cell carcinoma, the nonmelanoma human skin cancer.', 'Dual data and motif clustering improves the modeling and interpretation of phosphoproteomic data.', 'Role of aurora kinase B in regulating resistance to paclitaxel in breast cancer cells.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

In this case series, we present our first five patients undergoing the Bocciardi approach for RALP. We report the results of our technique in three patients following two unsuccessful attempts. No perioperative major complication was recorded. Pathologic stage was pT2c in two patients and pT2a in one patient, with no positive surgical margin. The day after removing the catheter, two of the three patients reported use of a single, small safety pad, and one patient was discharged without any pad.

Materials and methods:   A prospective analysis was performed in 107 consecutive men who underwent RARP by a single surgeon in an academic center. Men were excluded if they received adjuvant radiation therapy (7 men), were lost to follow up (4), or did not have a posterior rhabdosphincter reconstruction (8 men). Eighty-eight men received a posterior rhabdosphincter reconstruction and were followed in this study. Patient demographic and postoperative urinary control was recorded at interval follow up visits by the physician and research staff. Level of comorbidity was measured with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CACI). Preoperative urinary function was measured using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Continence was defined as men using zero pads per day.  Results:   Eighty-eight men with a mean age of 59.2 years (43.1-77.6) were followed for a median of 7.6 (range 1.5-16.7) months. The median preoperative PSA and IPSS was 5.0 ng/mL (range 0.95 ng/mL-23 ng/mL) and 8 (range 0-30), respectively. Overall, 91% of the men achieved continence with a median time to continence of 2.3 months. Of those, 50% achieved continence by 6 weeks. Men continent at 6 weeks were significantly younger, had lower IPSS scores, and less comorbidities (p = 0.01). Age (OR = 0.91, p < 0.01) and higher IPSS scores (OR = 0.28, p = 0.03) were associated with decreased odds of achieving continence at 6 weeks. The presence of coexisting disease was not predictive of continence return. After adjusting for comorbidity, body mass index (BMI), nerve sparing, and IPSS score, only age remained as an independent predictor of early continence (OR = 0.90, p = 0.04).  Conclusions:   In conclusion, we found that increased age and increased lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) severity are associated with decreased odds of achieving continence 6 weeks after RARP. Patient age remains the strongest predictor of early return of continence in a multivariate model.

Subjects and methods:   Six patients were followed on intermittent androgen suppression for intervals ranging from 7 to 10 years.

While most of the existing literature on compliance with cancer screening guidelines only measures raw screening rates in the target age groups, we used a novel approach to estimate degree of guideline compliance across Canadian provinces for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer screening. Measuring compliance as the change in age-specific screening rates at the guideline-recommended initiation age (50), we generally found screening patterns across Canadian provinces that were not consistent with guideline compliance.  Methods:   We calculated age-cancer-specific screening rates for ages 40-60 using the Canadian Community Health Survey (2003 and 2005), a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of health status, health care utilization and health determinants in the Canadian population. We estimated the degree of compliance using logistic regression to measure the change in adjusted screening rates at the guideline-recommended initiation age for each province in the sample.  Results:   For breast cancer, after adjusting for age trends and other covariates, being above age 50 in Quebec increased the probability of being screened by 19 percentage points, from an average screening rate of 24% among 40-49 year olds. None of the other regions exhibited a statistically significant change in screening rates at age 50. Additional analyses indicated that these patterns reflect asymptomatic screening and that Quebec's breast cancer screening program enhanced the degree of guideline compliance in that province. Colorectal cancer screening practice was consistent with guidelines only in Saskatchewan, as screening rates increased at age 50 by 12 percentage points, from an average rate of 6% among 40-49 year olds. For prostate cancer, the regions examined here are not compliant with Canadian guidelines since screening rates were quite high, and there was not a discrete increase at any particular age.  Conclusions:   Screening practice for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer was generally not consistent with Canadian clinical guidelines. Quebec (breast) and Saskatchewan (colorectal) were exceptions to this, and the impact of Quebec's breast cancer screening program suggests a role for policy in improving screening guideline compliance.""","""['Erin C Strumpf', 'Zhijin Chai', 'Srikanth Kadiyala']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Are U.S. cancer screening test patterns consistent with guideline recommendations with respect to the age of screening initiation?', 'Are United States and Canadian cancer screening rates consistent with guideline information regarding the age of screening initiation?', 'Variation of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer screening activity in Switzerland: Influence of insurance, policy and guidelines.', 'Effective interventions to facilitate the uptake of breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening: an implementation guideline.', 'Cutting cost and increasing access to colorectal cancer screening: another approach to following the guidelines.', 'À l’encontre du statu quo en matière de dépistage: Appel à l’action pour améliorer l’enseignement des soins de santé préventifs.', 'Going against the status quo in screening: Call to action to improve teaching in preventive health care.', 'Incidence and Mortality of Prostate Cancer in Canada during 1992-2010.', 'Identifying Primary Care Physicians Continuing Education Needs by Examining Clinical Practices, Attitudes, and Barriers to Screening Across Multiple Cancers.', ""Efficacy of an educational intervention on family physicians' risk assessment and management of colorectal cancer.""]"""

Deregulation of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity has previously been shown to be critically involved in centrosome overduplication. We therefore test here whether small molecule CDK inhibitors derived from the bis-indole indirubin can be used to suppress centrosome aberrations as a novel approach to chemoprevention of malignant progression.  Results:   As expected, we found that the CDK inhibitor indirubin-3'-oxime (IO) suppresses centrosome amplification in breast cancer cells. However, we made the unexpected discovery that indirubin-derived compounds that have been chemically modified to be inactive as kinase inhibitors such as 1-methyl-indirubin-3'-oxime (MeIO) still significantly reduced centrosome amplification. All indirubins used in the present study are potent agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is known for its important role in the cellular metabolism of xenobiotics. To corroborate our results, we first show that the coincidence of nuclear AhR overexpression, reflecting a constitutive activation, and numerical centrosome aberrations correlates significantly with malignancy in mammary tissue specimens. Remarkably, a considerable proportion (72.7%) of benign mammary tissue samples scored also positive for nuclear AhR overexpression. We furthermore provide evidence that continued expression of endogenous AhR is critical to promote centriole overduplication induced by cyclin E and that AhR and cyclin E may function in the same pathway. Overexpression of the AhR in the absence of exogenous ligands was found to rapidly disrupt centriole duplication control. Nonetheless, the AhR agonists IO and MeIO were still found to significantly reduce centriole overduplication stimulated by ectopic AhR expression.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that continued expression of endogenous AhR promotes centrosome amplification in breast cancer cells in a pathway that involves cyclin E. AhR agonists such as indirubins inhibit centrosome amplification even when stimulated by ectopic expression of the AhR suggesting that these compounds are potentially useful for the chemoprevention of centrosome-mediated cell division errors and malignant progression in neoplasms in which the AhR is overexpressed. Future studies are warranted to determine whether individuals in which nuclear AhR overexpression is detected in benign mammary tissue are at a higher risk for developing pre-cancerous or cancerous breast lesions.""","""['Nina Korzeniewski', 'Sarah Wheeler', 'Payel Chatterjee', 'Anette Duensing', 'Stefan Duensing']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Independent actions on cyclin-dependent kinases and aryl hydrocarbon receptor mediate the antiproliferative effects of indirubins.', ""Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor indirubin-3'-oxime selectively inhibits human papillomavirus type 16 E7-induced numerical centrosome anomalies."", 'Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by 3-methylcholanthrene, but not by indirubin, suppresses mammosphere formation via downregulation of CDC20 expression in breast cancer cells.', 'Centrosome overduplication, chromosomal instability, and human papillomavirus oncoproteins.', 'Endogenous and exogenous ligands of aryl hydrocarbon receptor: current state of art.', 'Centrosome amplification: a quantifiable cancer cell trait with prognostic value in solid malignancies.', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Promotes Liver Polyploidization and Inhibits PI3K, ERK, and Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling.', 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor activated by benzo (a) pyrene promotes SMARCA6 expression in NSCLC.', 'Functions and dysfunctions of the mammalian centrosome in health, disorders, disease, and aging.', 'Chemoresistance to Cancer Treatment: Benzo-α-Pyrene as Friend or Foe?']"""

Since global chromatin changes have been shown to occur in tumours and regions of tumour-associated genes are affected by epigenetic modifications, these may constitute important regulatory mechanisms for the pathogenesis of malignant transformation.  Methods:   In DU145, LNCaP and MCF-7 cells mRNA expression levels of CD44, Cyclin D2, GLIPR1 and PTEN were determined by quantitative RT-PCR at the basal status as well as after treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and/or histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A. Furthermore, genomic DNA was bisulfite-converted and sequenced. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with the stimulated and unstimulated cells using antibodies for MBD1, MBD2 and MeCP2 as well as 17 different histone antibodies.  Results:   Comparison of the different promoters showed that MeCP2 and MBD2a repressed promoter-specifically Cyclin D2 in all cell lines, whereas in MCF-7 cells MeCP2 repressed cell-specifically all methylated promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that all methylated promoters associated with at least one MBD. Treatment of the cells by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) caused dissociation of the MBDs from the promoters. Only MBD1v1 bound and repressed methylation-independently all promoters. Real-time amplification of DNA immunoprecipitated by 17 different antibodies showed a preferential enrichment for methylated lysine of histone H3 (H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) at the particular promoters. Notably, the silent promoters were associated with unmodified histones which were acetylated following treatment by 5-aza-CdR.

Methods:   Patients who participate in the SAM system are contacted by email at regular intervals and asked to complete validated questionnaires online. Patient responses on these questionnaires are then analyzed in order to provide patients with real-time, online information about their progress and to provide them with tailored and standardized medical advice. Patient-level data from the questionnaires are ported in real time to the patient's health care provider to be uploaded to clinic notes. An initial version of SAM has been developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) for aiding the clinical management of patients after surgery for prostate cancer.

The molecular nature of this cancer-associated antigen from selected patients' sera was determined.  Methods:   By using improved immunoassays, serum levels of CA215 and other known biomarkers were determined for respective positive detection rates. The molecular size of CA215 from cancer patients was determined by Western blot assay.  Results:   By using 0.1 AU/ml as the normal cut-off value, the positive rates of CA215 for different cancers were shown to be 52% (lung), 74% (liver), 44% (colon), 61% (esophagus), 60% (stomach), 59% (ovary), 40% (prostate), 71% (breast), 38% (kidney), 41% (pancreas), 51% (cervix), and 83% (lymphoma), respectively.

However, adherence rates for prostate cancer screening and CRC screening are very similar, with population-based studies showing that approximately 50% of eligible US men are adherent to both tests. Among men scheduled to participate in a free prostate cancer screening program, the authors assessed the rates and correlates of CRC screening to determine the utility of this setting for addressing CRC screening nonadherence.  Methods:   Participants (N = 331) were 50 to 70 years old with no history of prostate cancer or CRC. Men registered for free prostate cancer screening and completed a telephone interview 1 to 2 weeks before undergoing prostate cancer screening.  Results:   One half of the participants who underwent free prostate cancer screening were eligible for but nonadherent to CRC screening. Importantly, 76% of the men who were nonadherent to CRC screening had a regular physician and/or health insurance, suggesting that CRC screening adherence was feasible in this group. Furthermore, multivariate analyses indicated that the only significant correlates of CRC screening adherence were having a regular physician, health insurance, and a history of prostate cancer screening.  Conclusions:   Free prostate cancer screening programs may provide a teachable moment to increase CRC screening among men who may not have the usual systemic barriers to CRC screening, at a time when they may be very receptive to cancer screening messages.

Individuals homozygous for the variant allele of rs12757998 had an increased risk of prostate cancer [AA versus GG; odds ratio (OR): 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-2.25), and more specifically, high-grade tumors (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.25-2.89). The same genotype was associated with increased CRP (P = 0.02) and IL-6 (P = 0.05) levels. Missense mutations R462Q and D541E were associated with an increased risk of advanced stage disease only in the pre-prostate-specific antigen era. There were no significant associations with survival. The results of this study support a link between RNASEL and prostate cancer and suggest that the association may be mediated through inflammation.

Data have emerged documenting altered systemic miRNA expression across a spectrum of cancers; however, it remains uncertain as to whether circulating miRNAs are tumor specific. Our aim was to assess a panel of cancer-associated miRNAs in the circulation of patients with various malignancies, to determine whether these ""oncomirs"" were tumor specific, and thus to establish whether systemic miRNA analysis has utility in cancer diagnosis.  Patients and methods:   Whole blood samples were prospectively collected from preoperative cancer patients (breast, prostate, colon, and renal cancer and melanoma; n = 163) and healthy age- and sex-matched controls (n = 63). Total RNA was isolated, and a panel of seven miRNAs was quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in each sample.  Results:   Differential expression of the general oncomirs let 7a, miR-10b, and miR-155, was observed in the majority of cancer patients in a nonspecific manner. Significantly, elevated circulating miR-195 was found to be breast cancer specific and could differentiate breast cancer from other cancers and from controls with a sensitivity of 88% at a specificity of 91%. A combination of three circulating miRNAs, including miR-195, further enhanced the discriminative power of this test for breast cancer to 94%.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that individual cancers display specific systemic miRNA profiles, which could aid in discriminating among cancer types. This finding is of notable clinical consequence because it illustrates the potential of systemic miRNAs as sensitive, specific, noninvasive cancer biomarkers.""","""['Helen M Heneghan', 'Nicola Miller', 'Ronan Kelly', 'John Newell', 'Michael J Kerin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Measuring circulating miRNAs: the new ""PSA"" for Breast Cancer?', 'Circulating micro-RNAs as potential blood-based markers for early stage breast cancer detection.', 'Novel circulating microRNA signature as a potential non-invasive multi-marker test in ER-positive early-stage breast cancer: a case control study.', 'The level of circulating miRNA-10b and miRNA-373 in detecting lymph node metastasis of breast cancer: potential biomarkers.', 'The prognostic and therapeutic application of microRNAs in breast cancer: Tissue and circulating microRNAs.', 'Non Coding RNA Molecules as Potential Biomarkers in Breast Cancer.', 'Circulating microRNAs can predict chemotherapy-induced toxicities in patients being treated for primary breast cancer.', 'MicroRNA Dysregulation in Early Breast Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Circulating microRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for melanoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Potential Role of Circulating miRNAs for Breast Cancer Management in the Neoadjuvant Setting: A Road to Pave.', 'An Epidemiological Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis on Biomarker Role of Circulating MicroRNAs in Breast Cancer Incidence.']"""

The analysis of the demonstrated data can support the rational usage of PET/CT examination contingents in the domestic oncological attendance, which has growing importance. PET examinations with oncological aims have started in Debrecen more than 10 years ago. In 2005 already 1500 PET examinations have been carried out. According to the governmental regulation accepted in 2006, OEP ensures the financing of the three PET/CT centers until 2012, which means 12,000 examinations in 2012. However, the number of domestic oncological patients requiring PET/CT examinations can reach the number of 20,000-30,000 patients. The study summarizes the number of patients who applied for PET/CT examinations for the first time and later again between 2006 and 2010, based on the data of the waiting list, and the change of the patient assigning diagnosis and the number of examinations carried out with 18F-FDG and with 11C-methionine. The study demonstrates the number of examinations by counties which characterize the population's access to PET/CT. The assigning diagnosis in 2007 was already widespread and focused on problems. After the regulation came in to force in 2008 the possibilities significantly decreased. Clinical cases which were efficiently examined with PET/CT earlier were left out from the indication list. The distribution by county is uneven, although the number of examinations increases year by year. The number of repeated examinations increases as well. As a conclusion, the annual PET/CT examination contingents are constantly exploited. This might seem sufficient, because the method has not become a part of the oncological routine in all counties. Although the current indication list includes the most frequent oncological cases requiring PET/CT, the abandoning of the less frequent ones narrowed the professional latitude, which is disadvantageous for the patients suffering from such diseases. The radiopharmacon supply of PET/CT centers is inadequate thus they cannot provide modern oncological diagnostic attendance in case of frequent types of cancer (such as prostate). In the long run the growing number of repeated PET/CT examinations built in the oncological professional protocol has to be taken into account.""","""['László Galuska', 'László Balkay']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Magy Onkol""","""['FDG PET/CT in oncology: ""raising the bar"".', 'Metabolic imaging--PET, PET/CT--in oncologic surgery.', 'Role of whole body positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in patients with biopsy proven tumor metastases from unknown primary site.', 'Impact of a Targeted Project for Shortening of Imaging Diagnostic Waiting Time in Patients with Suspected Oncological Diseases in Hungary.', 'Clinical PET/CT imaging: promises and misconceptions.']"""

Recently, the Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-related gammaretrovirus (XMRV) was identified in prostate tissue with a high prevalence observed in prostate cancer (PC) patients homozygous for the glutamine variant of the RNASEL protein (462Q/Q). Association studies with the R462Q allele and non-XMRV viruses have not been reported. We assessed associations between prostate cancer, prostate viral infections, and the RNASEL 462Q allele in Mexican cancer patients and controls.  Methods:   130 subjects (55 prostate cancer cases and 75 controls) were enrolled in the study. DNA and RNA isolated from prostate tissues were screened for the presence of viral genomes. Genotyping of the RNASEL R462Q variant was performed by Taqman method.  Results:   R/R, R/Q, and Q/Q frequencies for R462Q were 0.62, 0.38, and 0.0 for PC cases and 0.69, 0.24, and 0.07 for controls, respectively. HPV sequences were detected in 11 (20.0%) cases and 4 (5.3%) controls. XMRV and HCMV infections were detected in one and six control samples, respectively. The risk of PC was significantly increased (Odds Ratio = 3.98; 95% CI: 1.17-13.56, p = 0.027) by infection of the prostatic tissue with HPV. BKV, JCV, and SV40 sequences were not detected in any of the tissue samples examined.  Conclusions:   We report a positive association between PC and HPV infection.

Patients and methods:   In all, 127 selected men with symptomatic BPH attending our urology clinic were recruited. The clinical conditions of BPH were assessed by digital rectal examination, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determination, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), transrectal ultrasonography and maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max) ) value at uroflussimetry. Before surgery, we measured the serum concentrations of total testosterone (TT) and free testosterone (FT), oestradiol, prolactin, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. We excluded men with endocrine diseases, those with prostate disease who were receiving antiandrogen therapy and those with psychological diseases. The relationships between the IPSS score and serum sex hormone levels were determined.  Results:   The final study population consisted of 122 men (mean age of 70.66 years), as five were excluded (three due to incomplete evaluation and two who were diagnosed with prostate cancer). On statistical analysis, the total IPSS was significantly associated with age (r= 0.405, P < 0.001) and TT (r= 0.298, P= 0.020) but not with FT or the serum levels of the other sex hormones. The serum levels of testosterone and IPSS did not correlate with prostate volume and Q(max) . PSA level and age correlated with prostate volume (r= 0.394, P < 0.001; r = 0.374, P < 0.001, respectively). We distinguished two subgroups of patients: the first group of 40 men with an IPSS of <19 and the second group of 82 with an IPSS of >19, and we evaluated the median levels of TT in each group. There was an increased risk of LUTS in men with a greater serum concentration of TT (P= 0.042), although the mean TT level was in the normal range.  Conclusions:   In the present study, the severity of LUTS was associated with age and serum levels of TT but only age correlated with the measures of BPH, especially prostate volume. The potential effects of testosterone on LUTS may well be indirect.

Patients and methods:   We included patients who underwent an ELRP at our department and who were followed for at least 2 years. Those who were impotent or incontinent before the surgery were excluded from the analysis. Overall, 911 men were included. All patients prospectively completed objective, self-administered questionnaires before the medical visit, concerning their voiding and sexual disorders, before surgery and 12 and 24 months after ELRP. Biochemical recurrence was defined as any detectable serum PSA (≥ 0.2 ng/mL). Potency was defined as the ability to achieve an erection sufficient for penetration with or without the use of phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitor. Urinary continence was defined as absence, or occasional use, of a pad for anticipated vigorous activity. The primary study endpoint was the trifecta rate (cancer control, continence and potency) at 2 years after the surgery. Factors associated with the trifecta outcome were assessed in univariate analysis.  Results:   Median age and PSA level were 62.2 years and 9.9 ng/mL, respectively. A trifecta outcome was achieved in 29.7 and 54.4% of patients at 12 and 24 months, respectively.

Excess thermal spread during dissection of the neurovascular bundle (NVB) can affect potency in men after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). We report on a novel delivery mechanism for CO(2) laser energy through a flexible fiber to enhance accuracy of NVB dissection during RARP.  Materials:   A feasibility study of the OmniGuide BeamPath URO-LG CO(2) laser fiber for NVB dissection was performed on 10 patients with primary Gleason 3 T1c prostate cancer during RARP. Bilateral lateral fascial antegrade nerve sparing was performed. We evaluated fiber performance, safety, and efficacy.  Results:   The fiber was inserted through the 12-mm assistant's port and easily manipulated by robotic instruments. Once pedicles were clipped and dissected, the laser fiber was effective in establishing planes of dissection between prostatic capsule and NVB. The endoscopically discernable thermal laser footprint was small, with minimal thermal spread during nerve sparing, meticulous dissection of NVB, and fascial layer identification. Although the laser did provide extremely accurate dissection, it was unable to serve as an adequate means of larger vessel coagulation.  Conclusions:   The flexible CO(2) laser fiber was easily manipulated. Identification of fascial layers during nerve sparing was facilitated with the fiber.

Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is becoming increasingly popular, yet LNY data are not well reported. We compare LNY from contemporary open RP (ORP) with RARP at an academic center.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective study was conducted of an Urologic Oncology Database. Between January 2005 and November 2009, 217 men underwent ORP with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND); 99 underwent RARP with PLND by a single surgeon during the same period. Men were stratified according to the D'Amico risk criteria. For intermediate and high-risk disease, an extended PLND was performed. Patient demographic, operative, and pathologic variables were measured, and LNY was compared across groups.  Results:   No significant differences were seen between groups for race, body mass index, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level or biopsy Gleason score. Patients were younger for RARP vs ORP (P = 0.003) and had higher clinical tumor stage (P = 0.02). Operative time was longer (P = 0.03) and estimated blood loss was greater (P < 0.001) in the ORP group. Overall, only a borderline significant difference was seen in LNY between ORP and RARP (7.49 vs 6.35 nodes, respectively, P = 0.06). No difference was seen for intermediate and high-risk patients, with 7.7 vs 6.8 nodes for ORP and RARP, respectively (P = 0.27). The lymph node metastasis rate was 6.3%, with more positive nodes detected during ORP vs RARP: 19/217 (8.8%) vs 1/99 (1.0%), P = 0.009.  Conclusions:   No significant differences were seen in LNY during RARP and ORP for intermediate and high-risk men. For experienced surgeons, RARP can achieve equivalent LNY as ORP. A future study with a larger sample size is necessary to make a definitive statement of equivalence.""","""['Matthew D Truesdale', 'Daniel J Lee', 'Philippa J Cheetham', 'Gregory W Hruby', 'Andrew T Turk', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['The impact of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy on the use and extent of pelvic lymph node dissection in the ""post-dissemination"" period.', 'Adherence of the indication to European Association of Urology guideline recommended pelvic lymph node dissection at a high-volume center: Differences between open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Assessment of required nodal yield in a high risk cohort undergoing extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy and its impact on functional outcomes.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'The role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection in the management of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Development of symptomatic lymphoceles after radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection is independent of surgical approach: a single-center analysis.', 'The age of robotic surgery - Is laparoscopy dead?', 'Current technique and results for extended pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'Current status of pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   The authors examined 1319 men treated with RP from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) Database.

Germline mutations in BRCA2 predispose to breast and ovarian cancer with its predominant tumour suppressor function thought to be the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. BRCA2 has also been implicated in prostate cancer etiology, but it is unclear the impact that mutations in this gene have on prostate tumourigenesis. Here we have undertaken a genetic analysis in the mouse to determine the role of Brca2 in the adult prostate. We show that deletion of Brca2 specifically in prostate epithelia results in focal hyperplasia and low-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in animals over 12 months of age. Simultaneous deletion of Brca2 and the tumour suppressor Trp53 in prostate epithelia gave rise to focal hyperplasia and atypical cells at 6 months, leading to high-grade PIN in animals from 12 months. Epithelial cells in these lesions show an increase in DNA damage and have higher levels of proliferation, but also elevated apoptosis. Castration of Brca2;Trp53 mutant animals led to regression of PIN lesions, but atypical cells persisted that continued to proliferate and express nuclear androgen receptor. This study provides evidence that Brca2 can act as a tumour suppressor in the prostate, and the model we describe should prove useful in the development of new therapeutic approaches.""","""['Jeffrey C Francis', 'Afshan McCarthy', 'Martin K Thomsen', 'Alan Ashworth', 'Amanda Swain']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia does not display loss of heterozygosity at the mutation locus in BRCA2 mutation carriers with aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Simultaneous haploinsufficiency of Pten and Trp53 tumor suppressor genes accelerates tumorigenesis in a mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'ETS family transcription factors collaborate with alternative signaling pathways to induce carcinoma from adult murine prostate cells.', 'Preneoplastic prostate lesions: an opportunity for prostate cancer prevention.', 'BRCA1 and prostate cancer.', 'brca2-mutant zebrafish exhibit context- and tissue-dependent alterations in cell phenotypes and response to injury.', 'BRCA Mutations in Prostate Cancer: Assessment, Implications and Treatment Considerations.', 'Significance of BRCA2 and RB1 Co-loss in Aggressive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Clonal Evolution and Epithelial Plasticity in the Emergence of AR-Independent Prostate Carcinoma.', 'BRCA Genes: The Role in Genome Stability, Cancer Stemness and Therapy Resistance.']"""

Genetic and molecular components, in particular, that are up- or downregulated in melanoma cells, affect the invasive potential of melanoma. Another possible important cofactor highlighted by recent studies is chronic stress, involving environmental and psychological factors, which can be an important cofactor in not only cancer progression in general but also in melanoma spreading. The negative effects of chronic stress have been evaluated epidemiologically in patients with breast and prostate cancer. In particular, the effects of stress mediators, namely, catecholamines have been studied on various human malignancies, including melanoma and have highlighted a significant increase of progression-related molecules.

Although HDACis have been known to induce gene expression, an equal number of genes are downregulated upon HDAC inhibition. The mechanism behind this downregulation remains unclear. Here we provide evidence that several DNA repair genes are downregulated by HDAC inhibition and provide a mechanism involving the E2F1 transcription factor in the process.  Methodology/principal findings:   Applying Analysis of Functional Annotation (AFA) on microarray data of prostate cancer cells treated with HDACis, we found a number of genes of the DNA damage response and repair pathways are downregulated by HDACis. AFA revealed enrichment of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair genes of the BRCA1 pathway, as well as genes regulated by the E2F1 transcription factor. Prostate cancer cells demonstrated a decreased DNA repair capacity and an increased sensitization to chemical- and radio-DNA damaging agents upon HDAC inhibition. Recruitment of key HR repair proteins to the site of DNA damage, as well as HR repair capacity was compromised upon HDACi treatment. Based on our AFA data, we hypothesized that the E2F transcription factors may play a role in the downregulation of key repair genes upon HDAC inhibition in prostate cancer cells. ChIP analysis and luciferase assays reveal that the downregulation of key repair genes is mediated through decreased recruitment of the E2F1 transcription factor and not through active repression by repressive E2Fs.  Conclusions/significance:   Our study indicates that several genes in the DNA repair pathway are affected upon HDAC inhibition. Downregulation of the repair genes is on account of a decrease in amount and promoter recruitment of the E2F1 transcription factor. Since HDAC inhibition affects several pathways that could potentially have an impact on DNA repair, compromised DNA repair upon HDAC inhibition could also be attributed to several other pathways besides the ones investigated in this study. However, our study does provide insights into the mechanism that governs downregulation of HR DNA repair genes upon HDAC inhibition, which can lead to rationale usage of HDACis in the clinics.""","""['Sushant K Kachhap', 'Nadine Rosmus', 'Spencer J Collis', 'Madeleine S Q Kortenhorst', 'Michel D Wissing', 'Mohammad Hedayati', 'Shabana Shabbeer', 'Janet Mendonca', 'Justin Deangelis', 'Luigi Marchionni', 'Jianqing Lin', 'Naseruddin Höti', 'Johan W R Nortier', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Hans Hammers', 'Michael A Carducci']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['E2F-HDAC complexes negatively regulate the tumor suppressor gene ARHI in breast cancer.', 'Analysis of the genomic response of human prostate cancer cells to histone deacetylase inhibitors.', 'Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 is a direct target of E2F1 and contributes to histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced apoptosis through positive feedback regulation of E2F1 apoptotic activity.', 'HDAC inhibitors: roles of DNA damage and repair.', 'The role of histone deacetylases in prostate cancer.', 'Enhanced efficacy of combined fluzoparib and chidamide targeting in natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.', 'Improving PARP inhibitor efficacy in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma: A focus on the immune system.', 'Role of PARP Inhibitors in Glioblastoma and Perceiving Challenges as Well as Strategies for Successful Clinical Development.', 'Homologous Recombination Deficiency in Ovarian, Breast, Colorectal, Pancreatic, Non-Small Cell Lung and Prostate Cancers, and the Mechanisms of Resistance to PARP Inhibitors.', 'Chidamide Reverses Fluzoparib Resistance in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

The HSP70 levels in chronic bacterial prostatitis and CP/CPPS patients were correlated with chronic prostatitis symptom index (CPSI). Significantly increased levels of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) and HSP70 were observed in seminal plasmas from patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis compared with CP/CPPS patients and controls. However, only IL-1β was significantly elevated compared with CP/CPPS IIIB and controls in patients with CP/CPPS IIIA. HSP70 levels in CP/CPPS patients were significantly lower than that in controls. HSP70 concentration in seminal plasma was negatively correlated with CPSI in chronic bacterial prostatitis. The results indicated that HSP70 and IL-1β appear to be the most reliable and predictive surrogate markers to diagnose chronic bacterial prostatitis and CP/CPPS, respectively.

Methods and materials:   The dose-uncertainty model provides a three-dimensional (3D) dose-uncertainty distribution in a given confidence level. For 8 retrospectively selected patients, dose-uncertainty maps were constructed using the dose-uncertainty model at the 95% CL. In addition to uncertainties inherent to the radiation treatment planning system, four scenarios of spatial errors were considered: machine only (S1), S1 + intrafraction, S1 + interfraction, and S1 + both intrafraction and interfraction errors. To evaluate the potential risks of the IMRT plans, three dose-uncertainty-based plan evaluation tools were introduced: confidence-weighted dose-volume histogram, confidence-weighted dose distribution, and dose-uncertainty-volume histogram.  Results:   Dose uncertainty caused by interfraction setup error was more significant than that of intrafraction motion error. The maximum dose uncertainty (95% confidence) of the clinical target volume (CTV) was smaller than 5% of the prescribed dose in all but two cases (13.9% and 10.2%). The dose uncertainty for 95% of the CTV volume ranged from 1.3% to 2.9% of the prescribed dose.  Conclusions:   The dose uncertainty in prostate IMRT could be evaluated using the dose-uncertainty model.

Methods and materials:   Prostate intrafraction motion was measured using kV fluoroscopy during MV delivery for 571 fractions from 30 hypofractionated radiotherapy patients. We evaluated trending over treatment course using analysis of variance statistics, and we evaluated the ability to correct patient-specific systematic error and apply patient-specific statistical margins after 2 to 15 fractions to compensate 90% of motion. We also evaluated the ability to classify patients into small- and large-motion subgroups based on the first 2 to 20 fractions using discriminant analysis.  Results:   No time trend was observed over treatment course, and intrafraction motion was patient specific (p < 0.0001). Systematic error in the first week correlated well with that in subsequent weeks, with correlation coefficients of 0.53, 0.50, and 0.41 in right-left (RL), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI), respectively. After 5 fractions, the adaptive strategy resulted in average margin reductions of 0.3, 0.7, and 0.7 mm in RL, AP, and SI, respectively, with margins ranging from 1 to 3.2 mm in RL, 2 to 7.0 mm in AP, and 2 to 6.6 mm in SI. By contrast, population margins to include the same percentage of motion were 1.7, 4.0, and 4.1 mm. After 2 and 5 fractions, patients were classified into small- and large-motion groups with ~77% and ~83% accuracy.

Methods and materials:   From 1991 to 2004, 1,044 patients with intermediate- (n = 782) or high-risk (n = 262) prostate cancer were treated with dose-escalated RT at William Beaumont Hospital. Patients received external-beam RT (EBRT) alone, brachytherapy (high or low dose rate), or high dose rate brachytherapy plus pelvic EBRT. Intermediate-risk patients had Gleason score 7, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 10.0-19.9 ng/mL, or Stage T2b-T2c. High-risk patients had Gleason score 8-10, PSA ≥20, or Stage T3.

Results:   Median follow-up was 5 years; 420 patients received ADT + dose-escalated RT, and 624 received dose-escalated RT alone. For all patients, no advantages in any clinical endpoints at 8 years were associated with ADT administration. No differences in any endpoints were associated with ADT administration based on intermediate- vs. high-risk group or RT modality when analyzed separately. Patients with palpable disease plus Gleason ≥8 demonstrated improved clinical failure rates and a trend toward improved survival with ADT.

Aim:   To determine the impact of different pelvic bony and soft tissue dimensions as well as apical prostate depth on the likelihood of performing bilateral nerve sparing and on recovery of EF after RP.  Methods:   Between November 2001 and June 2007, 644 potent men undergoing RRP had preoperative MRI where pelvimetry was performed with bilateral nerve sparing in 504 men. Outcomes including varying degrees of recovery of EF (level 1: normal; level 2: partial erections routinely sufficient for intercourse; level 3: partial erections occasionally sufficient for intercourse) were assessed. Median follow-up was 44.1 (interquartile range: 29.2, 65.3) months. We evaluated independent predictors of performing a bilateral nerve sparing procedure and of recovery of EF using multivariable Cox proportional hazards methods.  Main outcome measures:   Likelihood of performing bilateral nerve sparing as well as recovery of EF after RRP.  Results:   Patients with higher clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score are less likely to undergo bilateral nerve sparing. Surgeon is also a factor in the likelihood of having bilateral nerve sparing RRP. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, factors predictive of recovery of EF were age, pretreatment erectile function, surgeon, and modified Charlson score. None of the pelvimetric dimensions were significant predictors of any degree of recovery of EF. However, the study is limited by its retrospective nature and by being based on MRI evaluations useful for cancer staging rather than anatomical evaluation of pelvimetric dimensions.

Osteosclerosis is a common finding in prostatic cancer although osteolysis occurs within the sclerotic lesions. B-cell malignancies (lymphoma, myeloma) are also associated with marked osteolysis. Histopathological examination of bone biopsies was used for the diagnosis of malignancies and, prior to embedding, microcomputed tomography (microCT) was done on the bone specimens. Patients (247) who presented either a bone metastasis, an overt myeloma, a lymphoma or a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance were studied. All patients had a bone biopsy studied by 2D histomorphometry for the histopathology. During the fixation time, the bone cores were analyzed by microCT. On the 3D reconstructed models provided by microCT, signs of osteolysis/osteosclerosis were searched: excess of bone resorption, focal disorganization of microarchitecture, bone metaplasia, osteosclerosis. A strong agreement was obtained between histomorphometry and microCT results using Cohen's kappa test (kappa = 0.713). MicroCT identified excess bone resorption on trabecular surfaces when eroded surfaces were >10.5% by histomorphometry. MicroCT failed to identify some patients with smoldering myeloma or some lymphomas with microresorption. MicroCT data are obtained within 4 hr and suggest the malignant invasion of bone marrow when excess of bone resorption/formation is obtained. MicroCT can be used in the immediate postbiopsy period making possible a fast identification of malignancy.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the inhibition of angiopoietin-2 activity in PCa will impede angiogenesis, tumor growth, and alter bone response in vivo.  Methods:   To test our hypothesis we used L1-10, a peptide-Fc fusion that inhibits interactions between angiopoietin-2 and its receptor tie2. We blocked angiopoietin-2 activity using L1-10 in established subcutaneous and intra-tibial LuCaP 23.1 xenografts. We then determined the effect of L1-10 on survival, tumor growth, serum PSA, proliferation, microvessel density, and angiogenesis-associated gene expression in subcutaneous tumors. We also determined serum PSA, tumor area, and bone response in intra-tibial tumors.  Results:   The administration of L1-10 decreased tumor volume and serum PSA, and increased survival in SCID mice bearing subcutaneous LuCaP 23.1 tumors. Histomorphometric analysis, showed a further significant decrease in tumor epithelial area within the L1-10 treated LuCaP 23.1 subcutaneous tumors (P=0.0063). There was also a significant decrease in cell proliferation (P=0.012), microvessel density (P=0.012), and a significant increase in ANGPT-2 and HIF-1α mRNA expression (P≤0.05) associated with L1-10 treatment. Alternatively, in LuCaP 23.1 intra-tibial tumors L1-10 treatment did not significantly change serum PSA, tumor area or bone response.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that inhibiting angiopoietin-2 activity impedes angiogenesis and growth of LuCaP 23.1 PCa xenografts.

However, their role in PCa has not been fully explored.  Methods:   CTA expression profiling in PCa samples and cell lines was done utilizing a custom microarray that contained probes for two-thirds of all CTAs. The data were validated by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Functional studies were carried out by silencing gene expression with siRNA. DNA methylation was determined by methylation-specific PCR.  Results:   A majority of CTAs expressed in PCa are located on the X chromosome (CT-X antigens). Several CT-X antigens from the MAGEA/CSAG subfamilies are coordinately upregulated in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) but not in primary PCa. In contrast, PAGE4 is highly upregulated in primary PCa but is virtually silent in CRPC. Further, there was good correlation between the extent of promoter DNA methylation and CTA expression. Finally, silencing the expression of MAGEA2 the most highly upregulated member, significantly impaired proliferation of prostate cancer cells while increasing their chemosensitivity.  Conclusions:   Considered together, the remarkable stage-specific expression patterns of the CT-X antigens strongly suggests that these CTAs may serve as unique biomarkers that could potentially be used to distinguish men with aggressive disease who need treatment from men with indolent disease not requiring immediate intervention.

We hypothesized that inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway synergizes with the antiproliferative signaling of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3).  Methods:   Viability, cell cycle and senescence of cells were evaluated upon combinational treatment with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and pharmacological PI3K/AKT inhibitors.  Results:   Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K or Akt and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) synergistically inhibited growth of DU145, LNCaP, primary human prostate cancer cell strains and Pten null mouse prostatic epithelial cells (MPEC). The inhibitors used included API-2 (Triciribine) and GSK690693 which are currently in clinical trials for treatment of cancer. A novel mechanism for antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in prostate cells, induction of senescence, was discovered. Combination of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and AKT inhibitor cooperated to induce G(1) arrest, senescence, and p21 levels in prostate cancer cells. As AKT is commonly activated by PTEN loss, we evaluated the role of Pten in responsiveness to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) using shRNA knockdown and by in vitro knockout of Pten. MPEC that lost Pten expression remained sensitive to the antiproliferative action of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and showed higher degree of synergism between AKT inhibitor and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) compared to Pten-expressing counterparts.

To identify potential prostatic stem cells, we analyzed the expression of several potential stem cell markers in benign prostate and prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Methods:   CD44, CD133, Oct4, SOX2, and EZH2 expression was detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining using tissue microarray assays (TMA) composed of benign (non-neoplastic) prostatic tissue, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Positive staining was defined as 1+ (<10%), 2+ (10-50%), or 3+ (>50%).  Results:   We found CD44 staining in 97% and 72% of benign + HGPIN and malignant lesions, respectively. CD133 staining was detected in a small fraction (4 of 67) of prostate carcinomas. We found that Oct4 nuclear expression was strongly associated with benign lesions and HGPIN but not prostate cancer (P < 0.05). In most cases, nuclear expression of EZH2 and SOX2 was detected in less than 10% of cells in non-neoplastic prostate glands, HGPINs or prostate adenocarcinomas. Moreover, 27 of 33 SOX2 1+ prostate cancers were also EZH2 1+, whereas all 33 of these cases were CD44+.  Conclusions:   Expression of CD44 and Oct4 identified large populations of benign and malignant cells in the prostate, which did not fit the definition of stem cells as a small fraction of the total cell population. Our results suggest that combined expression of embryonic stem cell markers EZH2 and SOX2 might identify potential cancer stem cells as a minor (<10%) subgroup in CD44+ prostatic adenocarcinoma.""","""['Andrey V Ugolkov', 'Laurie J Eisengart', 'Chunyan Luan', 'Ximing J Yang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Cancer stem cell markers in prostate cancer: an immunohistochemical study of ALDH1, SOX2 and EZH2.', 'Co-Expression of Putative Cancer Stem Cell Markers CD44 and CD133 in Prostate Carcinomas.', 'Apoptosis incidence and protein expression of p53, TGF-beta receptor II, p27Kip1, and Smad4 in benign, premalignant, and malignant human prostate.', 'Pancreatic cancer stem cells: their role in pancreatic cancer patient outcomes and what is future?', 'Progress of research on breast cancer stem cell markers.', 'Advances in Nanotechnology for Cancer Immunoprevention and Immunotherapy: A Review.', 'Role of prostate cancer stem-like cells in the development of antiandrogen resistance.', 'Cancer Stem Cell Markers for Urinary Carcinoma.', 'SOX2 mediates metabolic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting cancer stem cell pathways for cancer therapy.']"""

Material and methods:   Treatment plans of 174 implants were evaluated using cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVHs). The planning was based on transrectal ultrasound (US) imaging, and the prescribed dose (100%) was 10 Gy. The tolerance doses to rectum and urethra were 80% and 120%, respectively. Dose-volume parameters for target (V90, V100, V150, V200, D90, D(min)) and quality indices (DNR [dose nonuniformity ratio], DHI [dose homogeneity index], CI [coverage index], COIN [conformal index]) were calculated. Maximum dose in reference points of rectum (D(r)) and urethra (D(u)), dose to volume of 2 cm(3) of the rectum (D(2ccm)), and 0.1 cm(3) and 1% of the urethra (D(0.1ccm) and D1) were determined. Nonparametric correlation analysis was performed between these parameters.  Results:   The median number of needles was 16, the mean prostate volume (V(p)) was 27.1 cm(3). The mean V90, V100, V150, and V200 were 99%, 97%, 39%, and 13%, respectively. The mean D90 was 109%, and the D(min) was 87%. The mean doses in rectum and urethra reference points were 75% and 119%, respectively. The mean volumetric doses were D(2ccm) = 49% for the rectum, D(0.1ccm) = 126%, and D1 = 140% for the urethra. The mean DNR was 0.37, while the DHI was 0.60. The mean COIN was 0.66.

There is a paucity of tumor-derived tissue available for molecular studies of CRPC patients. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of CRPC patients represent a possible avenue for interrogating the disease of such patients.  Methods:   Circulating tumor cells were captured with the CellSearch Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) Kit and with the CellSearch Profile Kit plus Qiagen's AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit for the measurement of the CTC count per 7.5 mL of blood and for the isolation of nucleic acids, respectively.

Sonazoid is a new microbubble contrast agent. The purpose of our study was to compare areas of contrast material enhancement in the prostate at ultrasonography with whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens to determine if the use of Sonazoid improves the detection rate of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Fifty patients with biopsy-proven cancer of the prostate who were scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy were recruited for this study. The day before the operation, each patient was evaluated with ultrasonography at baseline and again during intravenous infusion of Sonazoid. A map of ultrasonography findings was created prospectively at the time of imaging. Following radical prostatectomy, independent mapping of the pathologic results was performed and the maps were compared.  Results:   Ultrasonography evaluation at baseline demonstrated that at least one focus of cancer was identified in 20 of the 50 subjects (40.0%). Meanwhile at least one cancer focus was enhanced in 31 of the 50 patients (62.0%) when Sonazoid was used.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography can improve sensitivity, especially for the detection of large cancer, peripheral zone cancer and highly malignant cancer.

The technical implementation of IGRT is done by very different complex devices. The most common modality, because available in any new accelerator, is the cone beam CT. The main experiment of IGRT focuses on prostate cancer. Preliminary studies suggest the use of IGRT combined with IMRT should increase local control and decrease toxicity, especially rectal toxicity. In head and neck tumors, due to major deformation, a rigid registration is insufficient and replanning is necessary (adaptive radiotherapy). The onboard imaging delivers a specific dose, needed to be measured and taken into account, in order not to increase the risk of toxicity.

We recently reported 2-acylamino-4,6-diphenylpyridines as the first small molecule GPR54 antagonists with high potency.

Objective:   To evaluate the performance of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) and European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculators in detecting PCa in a contemporary screened cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed prebiopsy characteristics of 525 consecutive screened patients submitted to biopsy, as required by the risk calculators, in one European center between 2006 and 2007.  Measurements:   Comparisons were done using tests of accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-ROC]), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Biopsy predictors were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   PCa was detected in 35.2% of the subjects. Among predictors included in the calculators, the logarithmic transformations of prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination, previous biopsy status, and age were significantly associated with PCa; transrectal ultrasound abnormalities and family history were not. AUC-ROC for the ERSPC calculator was significantly higher than the PCPT calculator and PSA alone (80.1%, 74.4%, and 64.3%, respectively). Calibration plots showed better performance for the ERSPC calculator; nevertheless, ERSPC may underestimate risk, while PCPT tends to overestimate predictions. Decision curve analysis displayed higher net benefit for the ERSPC calculator; 9% and 23% unnecessary biopsies can be avoided if a threshold probability of 20% and 30%, respectively, is adopted. In contrast, the PCPT model displayed very limited benefit. Our findings apply to a screened European cohort submitted to extended biopsy schemes; consequently, caution should be exerted when considering different populations.  Conclusions:   The ERSPC risk calculator, by incorporating several risks factors, can aid in the estimation of individual PCa risk and in the decision to perform biopsy. The ERSPC calculator outperformed the PCPT model, which is of very limited value, in a contemporary cohort of screened patients.""","""['Vítor Cavadas', 'Luís Osório', 'Francisco Sabell', 'Frederico Teves', 'Frederico Branco', 'Miguel Silva-Ramos']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Performance of prostate cancer prevention trial risk calculator in a contemporary cohort screened for prostate cancer and diagnosed by extended prostate biopsy.', 'Comparison of risk calculators from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer in a contemporary Canadian cohort.', 'The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial and European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer risk calculators indicating a positive prostate biopsy: a comparison.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: have we resolved the controversy?', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Augmenting prostate magnetic resonance imaging reporting to incorporate diagnostic recommendations based upon clinical risk calculators.', 'Reducing prostate biopsies and magnetic resonance imaging with prostate cancer risk stratification.', 'Prostate Cancer Risk Calculators for Healthy Populations: Systematic Review.', 'Prediction models for prostate cancer to be used in the primary care setting: a systematic review.', 'Using clinical parameters to predict prostate cancer and reduce the unnecessary biopsy among patients with PSA in the gray zone.']"""

As an overall check, we implemented a method for reconstruction of the actually delivered 3D dose distribution to the patient during a treatment fraction, i.e., the 'dose of the day'. In this article results on the clinical evaluation of this concept for a group of IMRT prostate cancer patients are presented.  Materials and methods:   The actual IMRT fluence maps delivered to a patient were derived from measured EPID-images acquired during treatment using a previously described iterative method. In addition, the patient geometry was obtained from in-room acquired cone-beam CT images. For dose calculation, a mapping of the Hounsfield Units from the planning CT was applied. With the fluence maps and the modified cone-beam CT the 'dose of the day' was calculated. The method was validated using phantom measurements and evaluated clinically for 10 prostate cancer patients in 4 or 5 fractions.  Results:   The phantom measurements showed that the delivered dose could be reconstructed within 3%/3mm accuracy. For prostate cancer patients, the isocenter dose agreed within -0.4+/-1.0% (1 SD) with the planned value, while for on average 98.1% of the pixels within the 50% isodose surface the actually delivered dose agreed within 3% or 3mm with the planned dose. For most fractions, the dose coverage of the prostate volume was slightly deteriorated which was caused by small prostate rotations and small inaccuracies in fluence delivery. The dose that was delivered to the rectum remained within the constraints used during planning. However, for two patients a large degrading of the dose delivery was observed in two fractions. For one patient this was related to changes in rectum filling with respect to the planning CT and for the other to large intra-fraction motion during treatment delivery, resulting in mean underdosages of 16% in the prostate volume.  Conclusions:   A method to accurately assess the 'dose of the day' was evaluated for prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT. To correct for observed dose deviations off-line dose-adaptive strategies will be developed.""","""['Mathilda van Zijtveld', 'Maarten Dirkx', 'Marcel Breuers', 'Ruud Kuipers', 'Ben Heijmen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""[""Accurate IMRT fluence verification for prostate cancer patients using 'in-vivo' measured EPID images and in-room acquired kilovoltage cone-beam CT scans."", '3D in vivo dosimetry using megavoltage cone-beam CT and EPID dosimetry.', 'Real-time adaptive planning method for radiotherapy treatment delivery for prostate cancer patients, based on a library of plans accounting for possible anatomy configuration changes.', 'Towards automated on-line adaptation of 2-Step IMRT plans: QUASIMODO phantom and prostate cancer cases.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Trajectory log analysis and cone-beam CT-based daily dose calculation to investigate the dosimetric accuracy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy for gynecologic cancer.', 'Daily Ultrasound Imaging for Patients Undergoing Postprostatectomy Radiation Therapy Predicts and Ensures Dosimetric Endpoints.', 'Dosimetric Impact of the Positional Imaging Frequency for Hypofractionated Prostate Radiotherapy - A Voxel-by-Voxel Analysis.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Interfractional Variations for Post-prostatectomy Radiotherapy to the Prostatic Fossa-Relevance for the Frequency of Position Verification Imaging and Treatment Adaptation.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Interfractional Variations in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy-Implications for Imaging Frequency and Treatment Adaptation.']"""

Methods and materials:   Real-time two-dimensional (2D) marker position in the MV image plane was obtained by analyzing cine-MV images. The marker's in-line movement, and thus its time-varying three-dimensional (3D) position, was estimated by combining the 2D projection data with a previously established correlative relationship between the directional components of prostate motion. A confirmation request for more accurate localization using MV-kV triangulation was triggered when the estimated prostate displacement based on the cine-MV data was greater than 3 mm. An interventional action alert followed on positive MV-kV confirmation. To demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method, simulation studies of conventional-fraction intensity-modulated radiotherapy sessions were done using 536 Calypso-measured prostate trajectories from 17 radiotherapy patients.  Results:   A technique for intrafraction prostate motion management has been developed. The technique, using ""freely available"" cine-MV images and minimum on-board kV imaging (on average 2.5 images/fraction), successfully limited 3D prostate movement to within a range of 3 mm relative to the MV beam for 99.4% of the total treatment time. On average, only approximately one intervention/fraction was needed to achieve this level of accuracy.

Motion magnitude varied considerably among patients, with the probability of a 5-mm displacement ranging from 0.0% to 58.8%.

The clinical and pathologic data were collected in a prospectively maintained bladder cancer database program.  Results:   The mean follow-up period was 48.6 months (range 6.1-96.0). Of the 129 patients, 61 (47.3%) developed recurrence and 15 (11.6%) developed progression to muscle-invasive disease. The expression of p53 was not associated with the patient outcomes, but Ki-67 overexpression was related to progression-free survival on univariate analysis (relative risk 4.38, 95% confidence interval 1.48-13.01, P = .006). On multivariate analysis, Ki-67 overexpression was significantly associated with progression-free survival (relative risk 3.40, 95% confidence interval 1.04-11.05, P = .042). In the patients with Ki-67 overexpression, the 1- and 5-year progression-free survival rate was 98.0% and 73.9%, respectively. When the combination of p53 and Ki-67 expression was assessed in the multivariate model, the simultaneous overexpression of p53 and Ki-67 did not predict for progression-free survival (adjusted relative risk 1.16; 95% confidence interval 0.21-6.20, P = .863).  Conclusions:   These results suggest that Ki-67 expression can identify a subset of intermediate-risk patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer in whom intravesical mitomycin C therapy could be effective.""","""['Ho Kyung Seo', 'Kang Su Cho', 'Jinsoo Chung', 'Jae Young Joung', 'Weon Seo Park', 'Moon Kee Chung', 'Kang Hyun Lee']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Prognostic significance of p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in high risk superficial bladder cancer.', 'Correlation and prognostic significance of p53, p21WAF1/CIP1 and Ki-67 expression in patients with superficial bladder tumors treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin intravesical therapy.', 'The effect of repeat transurethral resection on recurrence and progression rates in patients with T1 tumors of the bladder who received intravesical mitomycin: a prospective, randomized clinical trial.', 'Current strategies for first and second line intravesical therapy for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.', 'Risk of post-operative intravesical mitomycin C instillation following transurethral bladder tumor resection.', 'Significance of TP53 mutation in bladder cancer disease progression and drug selection.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of lymphovascular invasion in bladder cancer transurethral resection specimens.', 'Significance of Ki-67 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Clinicopathological and Prognostic Value of Ki-67 Expression in Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'High Ki-67 Immunohistochemical Reactivity Correlates With Poor Prognosis in Bladder Carcinoma: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis with 13,053 Patients Involved.']"""

Anteroposterior dissection HoLEP was newly developed to protect the urethral sphincter and therefore lower the incidence rate of SUI. This study was conducted to determine the SUI incidence rate after anteroposterior dissection HoLEP.  Methods:   Sixty-eight consecutive patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia underwent HoLEP from January to December 2008. The first 31 cases (Surgery 1) underwent HoLEP according to Gilling's method. The next 37 cases (Surgery 2) underwent anteroposterior dissection HoLEP, where adenoma was dissected antegradely. This antegrade movement of the cystoscope allows the apical gland to be removed from the sphincter without causing damage. Surgical quality indexes (hemoglobin change, operating time, resected prostate volume) between the 2 groups were compared. All patients were assessed at 2 weeks postoperatively for clinical SUI, international prostate symptom score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL), and peak flow rates (Q(max)).  Results:   Patient characteristics and surgical quality indexes did not differ between the 2 groups. Clinical SUI was found in 25.2% of cases in the Surgery 1 group, but only 2.7% in the Surgery 2 group. IPSS, QoL and Q(max.) were significantly improved postoperatively in both groups. At 2 weeks, the QoL of the Surgery 2 group was significantly improved compared with that observed for Surgery 1 (1.5 ± 1.1 vs 2.4 ± 1.0, P = .02). The Q(max.) of Surgery 2 was significantly higher compared with Surgery 1 (19.8 ± 8.4 vs 13.0 ± 4.7 ml/s, P = .02).  Conclusions:   These results indicate that our anteroposterior dissection HoLEP is a promising procedure to avoid postoperative SUI and also to substantially improve QoL.""","""['Fumiyasu Endo', 'Yoshiyuki Shiga', 'Shingo Minagawa', 'Toshihisa Iwabuchi', 'Akiko Fujisaki', 'Masahiro Yashi', 'Kazunori Hattori', 'Osamu Muraishi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Re: Endo et al.: Anteroposterior dissection HoLEP: a modification to prevent transient stress urinary incontinence (Urology 2010;76:1451-1455).', 'Re: Endo et al.: Anteroposterior dissection HoLEP: a modification to prevent transient stress urinary incontinence (Urology 2010;76:1451-1456).', 'Editorial comment.', 'Prevention of transient urinary incontinence in peri-operative period of modified holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP).', 'Re: Endo et al.: Anteroposterior dissection HoLEP: a modification to prevent transient stress urinary incontinence (Urology 2010;76:1451-1456).', 'Peri-operative complications of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate: experience in the first 280 patients, and a review of literature.', 'Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and holmium laser ablation of the prostate: indications and outcome.', 'A Delphi consensus to standardize the technique of anatomical endoscopic enucleation of prostate: a study by ESUT endoscopic enucleation of prostate study group.', 'Anterior fibromuscular stroma-preserved endoscopic enucleation of the prostate: a precision anatomical approach.', 'Robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy versus holmium laser enucleation of the prostate for large benign prostatic hyperplasia: A single-center preliminary study in Korea.', '""Fenestration and Tunnel Method"" a Modification for the Holmium Laser Transurethral Prostatectomy of Large-Volume Prostates >80 ml: A Retrospective Study Based on 1-Year Follow-Up.', 'Impact of diabetes mellitus on urinary continence after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate due to lower urinary tract symptoms: a retrospective study.']"""

Methods:   We reviewed records of 384 patients who received RP for prostate cancer and were followed for at least 2 years with ultrasensitive PSA testing. Undetectable ultrasensitive PSA level was defined as <0.001 ng/mL. Subjects were categorized according to PSA nadirs: <0.001 ng/mL (group 1), 0.001 ng/mL ≤ and < 0.02 ng/mL (group 2), 0.02 ng/mL ≤ and < 0.05 ng/mL (group 3), or ≥0.05 ng/mL (group 4). Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival. A receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve was used to assess performances of multivariate model in predicting biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Overall, 206 (53.6%) patients showed undetectable ultrasensitive PSA nadir. Subjects of groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 demonstrated significant differences in biochemical recurrence-free survivals (log rank P <.001). In multivariate analysis, undetectable ultrasensitive PSA nadir (P <.001) was observed to be an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival along with preoperative PSA level (P = .030), pathologic stage (P = .014), and pathologic Gleason score (P = .042). Area under the ROC curve demonstrating predictive performances of the multivariate model, which included ultrasensitive PSA nadir, was significantly larger than that of the model without it (P <.001).

Methods:   Patients presenting to an equal access, military, multidisciplinary prostate cancer clinic composed the study group. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), EPIC Demographic, and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 were the instruments used. Evaluation was performed before treatment and every 3 months after treatment.  Results:   The study group comprised 665 patients. Caucasians were 3-fold more likely to choose surgery (radical prostatectomy [RP]) over external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Patients who earned more than $100,000 annually disproportionately chose RP (P < .0001). Similarly, those having a graduate school degree disproportionally chose RP (P < .0001). Patients undergoing RP had the greatest risk of urinary function decline (P < .0001) and sexual bother (P = .0003). African Americans (AA) had a greater risk of urinary function decline irrespective of treatment choice. Patients undergoing EBRT had equivalent urinary function to expectant management (EM) at 12 months (P < .0001). Brachytherapy was the only treatment that posed an increased risk of urinary bother decline when compared with EM (P = .0217). EBRT alone did not show significant decrement in sexual function when compared with EM.  Conclusions:   RP was chosen by patients of Caucasian ethnicity and patients with higher income and education level, despite providing the greatest risk of HRQoL decline. EBRT had no significant impact on urinary function, sexual function, or sexual bother scores at 12 months. EBRT may be offered to older patients with minimal HRQoL impact.

Fluorophore-conjugated peptides were used to measure tumor versus healthy tissue binding in human surgical samples, resulting in validation of neurotensin receptors as highly promising tumor-biomarkers. Drug-armed branched peptides were synthesized with different conjugation methods, resulting in uncleavable adducts or drug-releasing molecules. Cytotoxicity on human cell lines from colon (HT-29), pancreas (PANC-1) or prostate (PC-3) carcinoma indicated branched NT conjugated with MTX and 5-FdU as the most active agents on PANC-1 (EC(50) 4.4e-007 M) and HT-29 (1.1e-007 M), respectively. Tetra-branched NT armed with 5-FdU was used for in vivo experiments in HT-29-xenografted mice and produced a 50% reduction in tumor growth with respect to animals treated with the free drug.
