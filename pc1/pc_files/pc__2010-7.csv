We also examine trends from 1992 through 2005 to determine whether differences in screening use are increasing, staying the same, or decreasing.  Methods:   Data from the National Health Interview Surveys between 1992 and 2005 were analyzed to describe patterns and trends in cancer screening practices, including Papanicolaou test, mammography, prostate-specific antigen, and colorectal screening. Logistic regression was used to report 2005 data for population subgroups defined by several demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.  Results:   Rates of use for cancer tests are rising only for colorectal cancer, due largely to the increase in colorectal endoscopy screening. Use of all the modalities was strongly influenced by contact with a physician and by having health insurance coverage.  Conclusions:   There remain large gaps in use for all screening modalities by education, income, usual source of care, health insurance, and recent physician contact. These specific populations would benefit from interventions to overcome these barriers to screening.""","""['Judith Swan', 'Nancy Breen', 'Barry I Graubard', 'Timothy S McNeel', 'Donald Blackman', 'Florence K Tangka', 'Rachel Ballard-Barbash']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Progress in cancer screening over a decade: results of cancer screening from the 1987, 1992, and 1998 National Health Interview Surveys.', 'Has the use of cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening increased in the United States?', 'Socioeconomic disparities in preventive care persist despite universal coverage.

Many telomere-associated proteins are important for telomere length maintenance. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding telomere-associated proteins (RTEL1 and TERT-CLPTM1) as markers of cancer risk. We conducted an association study of telomere length and 743 SNPs in 43 telomere biology genes. Telomere length in peripheral blood DNA was determined by Q-PCR in 3,646 participants from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial and Nurses' Health Study. We investigated associations by SNP, gene, and pathway (functional group). We found no associations between telomere length and SNPs in TERT-CLPTM1L or RTEL1. Telomere length was not significantly associated with specific functional groups. Thirteen SNPs from four genes (MEN1, MRE11A, RECQL5, and TNKS) were significantly associated with telomere length. The strongest findings were in MEN1 (gene-based P=0.006), menin, which associates with the telomerase promoter and may negatively regulate telomerase. This large association study did not find strong associations with telomere length. The combination of limited diversity and evolutionary conservation suggest that these genes may be under selective pressure. More work is needed to explore the role of genetic variants in telomere length regulation.""","""['Lisa Mirabello', 'Kai Yu', 'Peter Kraft', 'Immaculata De Vivo', 'David J Hunter', 'Jennifer Prescott', 'Jason Y Y Wong', 'Nilanjan Chatterjee', 'Richard B Hayes', 'Sharon A Savage']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Hum Mutat""","""['Telomere structure and maintenance gene variants and risk of five cancer types.', 'Long telomere length and a TERT-CLPTM1 locus polymorphism association with melanoma risk.', 'Genetic variants in telomere-maintaining genes and skin cancer risk.', 'Walking the walk from genes through telomere maintenance to cancer risk.', 'Genetic Polymorphism, Telomere Biology and Non-Small Lung Cancer Risk.', 'TERC haploid cell reprogramming: a novel therapeutic strategy for aplastic anemia.', 'Leukocyte telomere length, allelic variations in related genes and risk of coronary heart disease in people with long-standing type 1 diabetes.', 'Analysis of MNS16A VNTR polymorphic sequence variations of the TERT gene and associated risk for development of bladder cancer.', 'Epigenetic Deregulation of Telomere-Related Genes in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients.', 'Aging- and Tumor-Mediated Increase in CD8+CD28- T Cells Might Impose a Strong Barrier to Success of Immunotherapy in Glioblastoma.']"""

The function of the protein is largely unknown, although an influence on cell motility and adhesion has been indicated. The present study investigated the impact of the differential expression of TGase-4 in human prostate cancer cells on RON, the hepatocyte growth factor-like/macrophage-stimulating protein (HGF-L/MSP) receptor, mediated cellular functions. Using human prostate cancer cell lines and prostate tissues, we demonstrated that human TGase-4 had a high degree of co-localisation with RON, primarily at the cell periphery and cell-cell adhesion region. High levels of TGase-4 expression in CAHPV10 cells and in PC3 cells engineered to over-express TGase-4 were associated with significantly increased cell motility in response to HGF-L, a clear contrast to wild-type and control cells. Neutralising antibody to RON and rhHGFL/MSP had no further bearing on the increased motility in TGase-4 over-expressing cells, although they had profound effect on the control cells. Akt pathway inhibitor significantly diminished the effect induced by HGF-L in the cells. Finally, over-expression of TGase-4 in prostate cancer cells resulted in autophosphorylation of RON. It is concluded that TGase-4 expression is intrinsically linked to the activation of RON in prostate cancer cells and that this autoactivation of RON contributes to the increased cell motility in TGase-4 expressing cells.""","""['Wen G Jiang', 'Lin Ye', 'Richard J Ablin', 'Howard G Kynaston', 'Malcolm D Mason']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['The RON receptor tyrosine kinase promotes MSP-independent cell spreading and survival in breast epithelial cells.', 'Comparative characterization of the HGF/Met and MSP/Ron systems in primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Prostate transglutaminase (TGase-4) antagonizes the anti-tumour action of MDA-7/IL-24 in prostate cancer.', 'Met-related receptor tyrosine kinase Ron in tumor growth and metastasis.', 'Macrophage-stimulating protein and RON receptor tyrosine kinase: potential regulators of macrophage inflammatory activities.', 'Urinary proteomic analysis during pregnancy and its potential application in early prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus and spontaneous abortion.', 'Therapeutic Considerations for Ron Receptor Expression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Transglutaminase 2 takes center stage as a cancer cell survival factor and therapy target.', 'Prostate transglutaminase (TGase-4, TGaseP) enhances the adhesion of prostate cancer cells to extracellular matrix, the potential role of TGase-core domain.', 'Overexpression of transglutaminase 4 and prostate cancer progression: a potential predictor of less favourable outcomes.']"""

Clinical interest prompted us to re-examine RAL resistance in vivo, particularly the effects of long-term treatments (a decade or more) on the evolution of RAL resistance. In this study, we have addressed the question of this being a reproducible phenomenon in wild-type estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human breast cell line MCF-7. MCF-7 cells cultured under estrogen-deprived conditions in the presence of 1 microM RAL for more than a year develop RAL resistance resulting in an independent cell line, MCF7-RAL. The MCF7-RAL cells grow in response to both estradiol E2 and RAL. Fulvestrant (FUL) blocks RAL and E2-mediated growth. Transplantation of MCF7-RAL cells into athymic ovariectomized mice and treatment with physiologic doses of E2 causes early E2-stimulated tumor growth. In contrast, continuous treatment of implanted animals with daily oral RAL (1.5 mg daily) causes growth of small tumors within 15 weeks. Continuous re-transplantation of the tumors growing in RAL-treated mice indicated that RAL stimulated tumor growth. Tumors in the untreated mice did not grow. Bi-transplantation of MCF7-E2 and MCF7-RAL tumors into the opposing mammary fat pads of the same ovariectomized animal demonstrated that MCF7-E2 grew with E2 stimulation and not with RAL. Conversely, MCF7-RAL tumors grew with RAL and not E2, a characteristic of phase II resistance. Established phase II resistance of MCF7-RAL tumors was confirmed following up to 7 years of serial transplantation in RAL-treated athymic mice. The ERalpha was retained in these tumors. The cyclical nature of RAL resistance was confirmed and extended during a 2-year evolution of the resistant phases of the MCF7-RAL tumors. The MCF7-RAL tumors that initially were inhibited by E2 grew in the presence of E2 and subsequently grew with either RAL or E2. RAL remained the major grow stimulus and RAL enhanced E2-stimulated growth. Subsequent transplantation of E2 stimulated tumors and evaluations of the actions of RAL, demonstrated robust E2-stimulated growth that was blocked by RAL. These are the characteristics of the anti-estrogenic actions of RAL on E2-stimulated breast cancer growth with a minor component of phase I RAL resistance. Continuous transplantation of the phase I RAL-stimulated tumors for >8 months causes reversion to phase II resistance. These data and literature reports of the cyclical nature of anti-androgen/androgen responsiveness of prostate cancer growth, illustrate the generality of the evolution of anti-hormonal resistance in sex steroid-sensitive target tissues.""","""['Gregor M Balaburski', 'Rita C Dardes', 'Michael Johnson', 'Bassem Haddad', 'Fang Zhu', 'Eric A Ross', 'Surojeet Sengupta', 'Andres Klein-Szanto', 'Hong Liu', 'Eun Sook Lee', 'Helen Kim', 'V Craig Jordan']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Apoptotic action of 17beta-estradiol in raloxifene-resistant MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Antitumor action of physiological estradiol on tamoxifen-stimulated breast tumors grown in athymic mice.', 'Increased antitumor potential of the raloxifene prodrug, raloxifene diphosphate.', 'Vitamin D modulation of the activity of estrogenic compounds in bone cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Selective estrogen receptor modulators and the combination therapy conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene: A review of effects on the breast.', 'Establishment of a three‑dimensional triculture model on the novel AXTEX‑4D™ platform.', 'Estrogen for the Treatment and Prevention of Breast Cancer: A Tale of 2 Karnofsky Lectures.', 'Pharmacology and Molecular Mechanisms of Clinically Relevant Estrogen Estetrol and Estrogen Mimic BMI-135 for the Treatment of Endocrine-Resistant Breast Cancer.', 'Estrogen-Induced Apoptosis in Breast Cancers Is Phenocopied by Blocking Dephosphorylation of Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 Alpha (eIF2α) Protein.', 'A Raloxifene Withdrawal Response: Translational Research, Definitions, and Clinical Applications.']"""

Humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab, Avastin), approved as a treatment for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, requires administration every 3 weeks. We hypothesized that an intrapleural administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing an anti-VEGF-A antibody equivalent of bevacizumab would result in sustained anti-VEGF-A localized expression within the lung and suppress metastatic tumor growth. The AAV vector AAVrh.10alphaVEGF encodes the light chain and heavy chain complementary DNAs of monoclonal antibody A.4.6.1, a murine antibody that specifically recognizes human VEGF-A with the same antigen-binding site as bevacizumab. A metastatic lung tumor model was established in severe combined immunodeficient mice by intravenous administration of human DU145 prostate carcinoma cells. Intrapleural administration of AAVrh.10alphaVEGF directed long-term expression of the anti-human VEGF-A antibody in lung, as shown by sustained, high-level anti-human VEGF titers in lung epithelial lining fluid for 40 weeks, which was the duration of the study. In the AAVrh.10alphaVEGF-treated animals, tumor growth was significantly suppressed (P<0.05), the numbers of blood vessels and mitotic nuclei in the tumor was decreased (P<0.05) and there was increased survival (P<0.05). Thus, intrapleural administration of an AAVrh.10 vector, encoding the murine monoclonal antibody equivalent of bevacizumab, effectively suppresses the growth of metastatic lung tumors, suggesting AAV-mediated gene transfer to the pleura to deliver bevacizumab locally to the lung as a novel alternative platform to conventional monoclonal antibody therapy.""","""['M Watanabe', 'J L Boyer', 'R G Crystal']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Gene Ther""","""['Genetic delivery of the murine equivalent of bevacizumab (avastin), an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody, to suppress growth of human tumors in immunodeficient mice.', 'AAV-mediated persistent bevacizumab therapy suppresses tumor growth of ovarian cancer.', 'Persistent suppression of ocular neovascularization with intravitreal administration of AAVrh.10 coding for bevacizumab.', 'Bevacizumab in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Monoclonal antibodies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor: current status and future challenges in cancer therapy.', 'Genes in pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension and the most promising BMPR2 gene therapy.', 'A trial of intra-pleural bacterial immunotherapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma (TILT) - a randomised feasibility study using the trial within a cohort (TwiC) methodology.', 'Rational design of AAVrh10-vectored ACE2 functional domain to broadly block the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 variants.', 'Biosimilar Gene Therapy: Investigational Assessment of Secukinumab Gene Therapy.', 'Antiangiogenic Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-Blocking Peptides Displayed on the Capsid of an Infectious Oncolytic Parvovirus: Assembly and Immune Interactions.']"""

In this paper, we propose a new solution for brachytherapy seed detection using 3-D ultrasound. A 3-D reflected power image is computed from ultrasound RF signals, instead of conventional B-mode images. Then, implanted seeds are segmented in 3-D local search spaces that are determined by a priori knowledge, e.g., needle entry points and seed placements. Needle insertion tracks are also detected locally by the Hough transform. Experimental results show that the proposed solution works well for seed localization in a prostate phantom implanted according to a realistic treatment plan with 136 seeds from 26 needles.""","""['Xu Wen', 'Septimiu Tim E Salcudean', 'Peter D Lawrence']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Biomed Eng""","""['Detection of brachytherapy seeds using 3D ultrasound.', 'Automated localization of implanted seeds in 3D TRUS images used for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Seed localization in ultrasound and registration to C-arm fluoroscopy using matched needle tracks for prostate brachytherapy.', 'The role of transrectal ultrasound on prostatic cryotherapy and brachytherapy.', 'Three dimensional ultrasound and prostate cancer.', 'Feasibility of vibro-acoustography with a quasi-2D ultrasound array transducer for detection and localizing of permanent prostate brachytherapy seeds: a pilot ex vivo study.', 'Modulation of photoacoustic signal generation from metallic surfaces.', 'A 5-MHz cylindrical dual-layer transducer array for 3-D transrectal ultrasound imaging.', 'Ultrasound-fluoroscopy registration for prostate brachytherapy dosimetry.', 'Prostate implant reconstruction from C-arm images with motion-compensated tomosynthesis.']"""

Methods:   We examined associations of adult BMI with cancer mortality (overall and for 20 cancer sites) in geographic populations from Asia and from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), within the Asia-Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration, by use of Cox regression analysis. Pooled data from 39 cohorts (recruitment 1961-99, median follow-up 4 years) were analysed for 424,519 participants (77% Asian; 41% female; mean recruitment age 48 years) with individual data on BMI.  Findings:   After excluding those with follow-up of less than 3 years, 4872 cancer deaths occurred in 401,215 participants. Hazard ratios for cancer sites with increased mortality risk in obese (BMI > or = 30 kg/m(2)) compared with normal weight participants (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)) were: 1.21 (95% CI 1.09-1.36) for all-cause cancer (excluding lung and upper aerodigestive tract), 1.50 (1.13-1.99) for colon, 1.68 (1.06-2.67) for rectum, 1.63 (1.13-2.35) for breast in women 60 years or older, 2.62 (1.57-4.37) for ovary, 4.21 (1.89-9.39) for cervix, 1.45 (0.97-2.19) for prostate, and 1.66 (1.03-2.68) for leukaemia (all after left censoring at 3 years). The increased risk associated with a 5-unit increase in BMI for those with BMI of 18.5 kg/m(2) or higher was 1.09 (95% CI 1.04-1.14) for all cancers (excluding lung and upper aerodigestive tract). There was little evidence of regional differences in relative risk of cancer with higher BMI, apart from cancers of the oropharynx and larynx, where the association was inverse in ANZ and absent in Asia.  Interpretation:   Overweight and obese individuals in populations across the Asia-Pacific region have a significantly increased risk of mortality from cancer.

Materials and methods:   All registered cases of lung, breast and prostate cancer diagnosed in British Columbia between 1997 and 2007 were identified. The proportion of cancers treated within 1 (RT1Y) and 5 years (RT5Y) of diagnosis were calculated according to rural, semi-urban and urban area, and areas associated with short and long drive distances to cancer clinics in British Columbia.  Results:   RT1Y for lung, breast and prostate in urban and rural areas were 47/45%, 57/46% and 31/30%, and for short and long drive times were 47/44%, 56/50% and 31/31% compared with model estimates for initial radiotherapy needs of 41-45%, 57-61% and 32-37%, respectively.

Conclusions:   Radiotherapy rates vary between and within urban and rural areas in British Columbia.

The Roach formula (RF) has been criticized as overestimating LN risk. A modification of the RF has been attempted by other investigators using simplified adjustment ratios: the Nguyen formula (NF).  Methods and materials:   The National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was investigated for patients treated in 2004 through 2006 for whom at least 10 LN were examined at radical prostatectomy, cT1c or cT2 disease, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <26 ng/ml (N = 2,930). The Yale formula (YF) was derived from half of the sample (n = 1,460), and validated in the other half (n = 1,470).  Results:   We identified 2,930 patients. Only 4.6% of patients had LN+, and 72.6% had cT1c disease. Gleason (GS) 8-10 histology was found in 14.4% of patients. The YF for prediction of %LN+ risk is [GS - 5] × [PSA/3 + 1.5 × T], where T = 0, 1, and 2 for cT1c, cT2a, and cT2b/cT2c. Within each strata of predicted %LN+ risk, the actual %LN+ was closest to the YF. Using a >15% risk as an indicator of high-risk disease, the YF had increased sensitivity (39.0% vs. 13.6%) compared with the NF, without a significant reduction in specificity (94.9% vs. 98.8%). The NF was overly restrictive of the high-risk group, with only 2% of patients having a >15% risk of LN+ by that formula.  Conclusion:   The YF performed better than the RF and NF and was best at differentiating patients at high risk for LN+ disease.""","""['James B Yu', 'Danil V Makarov', 'Cary Gross']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Predicting the risk of pelvic node involvement in men with prostate cancer in the contemporary era: change you can believe?: in regard to Yu, et al.

Compositional analyses indicate that TSU was randomly distributed in the hydrophobic blocks. When the TSU content in the co-polymers increased, the polymer crystallinity decreased progressively and the glass transition temperature increased accordingly. The hydrophobic, anticancer drug, camptothecin (CPT), was successfully encapsulated in the block copolymer nanoparticles. The CPT encapsulation efficiency and release kinetics were strongly dependent on the co-polymer composition and crystallinity. CPT release from nanoparticles constructed from co-polymers containing 0, 39 and 100 mol% TSU in the hydrophobic block followed the same trend, with an initial burst of approx. 40% within one day followed by a moderate and slow release lasting up to 7 days. At a TSU content of 14 mol%, CPT was released in a continuous and controlled fashion with a reduced initial burst and a 73% cumulative release by day 7. The in vitro cytoxicity assay showed that the blank nanoparticles were not toxic to the cultured bone metastatic prostate cancer cells (C4-2B). Compared to the free drug, the encapsulated CPT was more effective in inducing apoptotic responses in C4-2B cells.

Urinary PCA3 levels have been associated with prostate cancer grade suggesting a significant role in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. We measured urinary PCA3 score in 925 subjects from several areas of Italy assessing in 114 the association of urinary PCA3 score with the results of prostate biopsy.  Material and methods:   First-catch urine samples were collected after digital rectal examination (DRE). PCA3 and PSA mRNA levels were measured using Trascription-mediated PCR amplification. The PCA3 score was calculated as the ratio of PCA3 and PSA mRNA (PCA3 mRNA/PSA mRNA x 1000) and the cut off was set at 35.  Results:   A total of 925 PCA3 tests were performed from December 2008 to January 2010. The rate of informative PCA3 test was 99%, with 915 subjects showing a valid PCA3 score value: 443 patients (48.42%) presented a PCA3 score >/= 35 (cut-off) whereas the remaining 472 patients (51.58%) presented a PCA3 score lower the cut-off limit (< 35). Of the 443 patients with PCA3 score >/= 35, 105 (23.70%) underwent biopsy or rebiopsy. We found that 27 patients (25.71%) had no tumour at biopsy, 37 (35.24%) had HGPIN or ASAP and 41 (39.05%) had a cancer. Moreover, including the additonal 9 patients with PCA3 < 35, who underwent biopsy post PCA3 results, our data indicate that patients with negative biopsy (n = 31) show lower PCA3 score (mean = 54.9) compared with patients with positive biopsy (n = 45) (mean = 141.6) (p = 0.000183; two-tailed t-student test). The mean PCA3 score (79.6)for the patients diagnosed with HGPIN/ASAP at biopsy (n = 38) was intermediate between patients with negative and positive biopsy.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that the PCA3 score is a valid tool for prostate cancer detection and its role in making better biopsy decisions.

Genotypes were significantly and marginally associated with PCa risk using the dominant and log-additive genetic models (OR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.02-2.29, P=0.04; OR=1.33, 95% CI: 0.99-1.78, P=0.06, respectively). After adjusting for age, the associations with PCa remained, but results were not statistically significant (OR=1.48, 95% CI: 0.95-2.31, P=0.08; OR=1.30, 95% CI: 0.95-1.80, P=0.10, respectively).

Poor physician-patient communication has been identified as a key contributor to low trial accrual. Question prompt lists (QPLs) have demonstrated a significant promise in facilitating communication in general, surgical, and palliative oncology settings. These simple patient interventions have not been tested in the oncology clinical trial setting. We aimed to develop a targeted QPL for clinical trials (QPL-CT).  Method:   Lung, breast, and prostate cancer patients who either had (trial experienced) or had not (trial naive) participated in a clinical trial were invited to join focus groups to help develop and explore the acceptability of a QPL-CT. Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed. A research team, including a qualitative data expert, analyzed these data to explore patients' decision-making processes and views about the utility of the QPL-CT prompt to aid in trial decision making.  Results:   Decision making was influenced by the outcome of patients' comparative assessment of perceived risks versus benefits of a trial, and the level of trust patients had in their doctors' recommendation about the trial. Severity of a patient's disease influenced trial decision making only for trial-naive patients.  Conclusion:   Although patients were likely to prefer a paternalistic decision-making style, they expressed valuation of the QPL as an aid to decision making. QPL-CT utility extended beyond the actual consultation to include roles both before and after the clinical trial discussion.""","""['Richard F Brown', 'Elyse Shuk', 'Natasha Leighl', 'Phyllis Butow', 'Jamie Ostroff', 'Shawna Edgerson', 'Martin Tattersall']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Identifying patient information needs about cancer clinical trials using a Question Prompt List.', 'Testing the utility of a cancer clinical trial specific Question Prompt List (QPL-CT) during oncology consultations.', 'Supporting doctor-patient communication: Providing a question prompt list and audio recording of the consultation as communication aids to outpatients in a cancer clinic.', 'The Question-prompt list (QPL): Why it is needed in the Indian oncology setting?', 'A review of question prompt lists used in the oncology setting with comparison to the Patient Concerns Inventory.', 'Information needs and development of a question prompt sheet for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation: A mixed methods study.', 'Asking questions that matter - Question prompt lists as tools for improving the consent process for neurotechnology clinical trials.', 'Transformative learning experience among nursing students with patients acting as teachers: Mixed methods, non-randomized, single-arm study.', 'Factors Associated With Participation in Clinical Trials Among Patients With Lupus.', 'Helping Patients Communicate With Oncologists When Cancer Treatment Resistance Occurs to Develop, Test, and Implement a Patient Communication Aid: Sequential Collaborative Mixed Methods Study.']"""

Differences in prostate cancer incidence suggest a significant role of environmental factors in the aetiology: obesity, central adiposity and some dietary factors have been suggested as risk factors. This pilot study aimed to analyse the pattern of nutritional status, body fat, and the usual dietary intake among men diagnosed with prostate cancer, consecutively referred to the Radiotherapy Department of the University Hospital Santa Maria.  Patients & methods:   Throughout 2006, 87 men with prostate cancer were included.  Evaluations:   weight & height to calculate body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, percentage body fat with bipolar hand-held bioimpedance analysis (BF-306), Food Frequency Questionnaire validated for the Portuguese population to assess the usual dietary intake. Frequency analysis and Mann-Whitney U test were used to evaluate prevalence and associations.  Results:   Mean age was 69+/-7 (46-85) years; 74 (84.1%) patients were in stage II, 5 (5.7%) in stage I & 9 (10.2%) in stage III; 39(45%) patients had a Gleason score>or=7. Regarding nutritional status, 78 (89%) patients were overweight/obese, 84 (97%) had a body fat above the maximum limit (>25%) and 43 (49%) had a waist circumference>102 cm (prevalence analysis: p<0.05). Univariate analysis did not show any association between Gleason Score, BMI, %body fat and waist circumference; by multivariate analysis there was an association between higher BMI, %body fat and aggressive Gleason scores (p<0.002), such variables worsened with age. Food frequency analysis showed a low consumption of n-3 fatty acids sources as well as vegetables and whole grain cereals and a correlation between low yogurt and vegetables intake with more aggressive Gleason scores was found (p<0.05).  Conclusion:   Our findings show a high prevalence of obesity, excessive body and abdominal fat and diets deficient in protective nutrients.

Activated iNKT cells cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity can inhibit existing and spontaneous tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. We have identified functional iNKT cell defects in the murine TRAMP prostate cancer model. We found that iNKT cells show the ability to migrate into TRAMP prostate tumors. This infiltration was mediated through CCL2: CCR5 chemokine: receptor interaction. Prostate tumor cells expressing CD1d partially activated iNKT cells, as appreciated by up-regulation of CD25, PD-1 and the IL-12R. However, despite inducing up-regulation of these activation markers and, hence, delivering positive signals, prostate tumor cells inhibited the IL-12-induced STAT4 phosphorylation in a cell-cell contact dependent but CD1d-independent manner. Consequently, tumor cells did not induce secretion of IFNgamma by iNKT cells. Blocking the inhibitory Ly49 receptor on iNKT cells in the presence of alpha-GalCer restored their IFNgamma production in vivo and in vitro. However, Ly49 blockade alone was not sufficient. Importantly, this defect could be also be reversed into vigorous secretion of IFNgamma by the addition of both IL-12 and the exogenous CD1d ligand alpha-galactosylceramide, but not by IL-12 alone, both in vivo and in vitro.

The data density, high resolution, large active area, and efficiency of the MV EPID make it an attractive option. However, EPIDs were designed as imaging devices, not dosimeters, and as a result they do not inherently measure dose in tissue equivalent media. EPIDose (Sun Nuclear, Melbourne, FL) is a tool designed for the use of EPIDs in IMRT QA that uses raw MV EPID images (no additional build-up and independent of gantry angle, but with dark and flood field corrections applied) to estimate absolute dose planes normal to the beam axis in a homogeneous media (i.e. similar to conventional IMRT QA methods). However, because of the inherent challenges of the EPID-based dosimetry, validating and commissioning such a system must be done very carefully, by exploring the range of use cases and using well-proven ""standards"" for comparison. In this work, a multi-institutional study was performed to verify accurate EPID image to dose plane conversion over a variety of conditions. Converted EPID images were compared to 2D diode array absolute dose measurements for 188 fields from 28 clinical IMRT treatment plans. These plans were generated using a number of commercially available treatment planning systems (TPS) covering various treatment sites including prostate, head and neck, brain, and lung. The data included three beam energies (6, 10, and 15 MV) and both step-and-shoot and dynamic MLC fields. Out of 26,207 points of comparison over 188 fields analyzed, the average overall field pass rate was 99.7% when 3 mm/3% DTA criteria were used (range 94.0-100 per field). The pass rates for more stringent criteria were 97.8% for 2mm/2% DTA (range 82.0-100 per field), and 84.6% for 1 mm/1% DTA (range 54.7-100 per field).

This study evaluated the behavior of three ITPSs when varying smoothing parameters. We evaluated four cases treated with IMRT in our clinic: sinonasal carcinoma (SNC), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), base of tongue carcinoma (BOT), and prostate carcinoma (PST). Varian Eclipse v6.5, BrainLAB BrainScan v5.31, and Nomos Corvus v6.2 ITPSs were studied for the SNC, GBM, and PST sites. Only Eclipse and Corvus were studied for BOT due to field size constraints of the BrainLAB MM3 collimator. For each ITPS, plans were first optimized using vendor- recommended default ""smoothing"" values. Treatment plans were then reoptimized, exploring various smoothing values. Key metrics recorded included a delivery complexity (DC) metric and the Ian Paddick Conformality Index (IPCI). Results varied widely by vendor with regard to the impact of smoothing on complexity and conformality. Plans run on the Corvus ITPS showed the logically anticipated increase in DC as smoothing was decreased, along with associated improved organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. Both Eclipse and BrainScan experienced an expected trend for increased DC as smoothing was decreased. However, this increase did not typically result in appreciably improved OAR sparing. For Eclipse and Corvus, and to a much lesser extent BrainScan, increases in smoothing decreased DC but eventually caused unacceptable losses in plan quality. Depending on the ITPS, potential benefits from optimizing fluence smoothing levels can be significant, allowing for increases in either efficiency or conformality. Because of variability in smoothing function behavior by ITPS, it is important that users familiarize themselves with the effects of varying smoothing parameters for their respective ITPS. Based on experience gained here, we provide recommended workflows for each ITPS to best exploit the fluence-smoothing features of the system.""","""['Christopher J Anker', 'Brian Wang', 'Matt Tobler', 'Julie Chapek', 'Dennis C Shrieve', 'Ying J Hitchcock', 'Bill J Salter']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Effect of fluence smoothing on the quality of intensity-modulated radiation treatment plans.', 'Optimization of isocenter location for intensity modulated stereotactic treatment of small intracranial targets.', 'A quantitative study of IMRT delivery effects in commercial planning systems for the case of oesophagus and prostate tumours.', 'Deterministic direct aperture optimization using multiphase piecewise constant segmentation.', 'Direct aperture optimization as a means of reducing the complexity of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy plans.', 'Does Fluence Smoothing Reduce the Complexity of the Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Treatment Plan?

The present analysis was aimed to elucidate the biological and clinical roles of BRCA1 losses in metastatic spread and tumor progression in PCa patients.  Experimental design:   To map molecular progression in PCa outgrowth, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of primary tumors and lymph node sections, and CTCs from peripheral blood.  Results:   We found that 14% of 133 tested patients carried monoallelic BRCA1 loss in at least one tumor focus. Extended molecular analysis of chr17q revealed that this aberration was often a part of larger cytogenetic rearrangement involving chr17q21 accompanied by allelic imbalance of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN and lack of BRCA1 promoter methylation. The BRCA1 losses correlated with advanced T stage (P < 0.05), invasion to pelvic lymph nodes (P < 0.05), as well as biochemical recurrence (P < 0.01). Their prevalence was twice as high within 62 lymph node metastases (LNM) as in primary tumors (27%, P < 0.01). The analysis of 11 matched primary PCa-LNM pairs confirmed the suspected transmission of genetic abnormalities between these two sites. In four of seven patients with metastatic disease, BRCA1 losses appeared in a minute fraction of cytokeratin- and vimentin-positive CTCs.  Conclusions:   Small subpopulations of PCa cells bearing BRCA1 losses might be one confounding factor initiating tumor dissemination and might provide an early indicator of shortened disease-free survival.""","""['Natalia Bednarz', 'Elke Eltze', 'Axel Semjonow', 'Michael Rink', 'Antje Andreas', 'Lennart Mulder', 'Juliane Hannemann', 'Margit Fisch', 'Klaus Pantel', 'Heinz-Ulrich G Weier', 'Krzysztof P Bielawski', 'Burkhard Brandt']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Somatic aberrations of BRCA1 gene are associated with ALDH1, EGFR, and tumor progression in prostate cancer.', 'Up-regulation of LIMK1 expression in prostate cancer is correlated with poor pathological features, lymph node metastases and biochemical recurrence.', 'Loss of p53 and c-myc overrepresentation in stage T(2-3)N(1-3)M(0) prostate cancer are potential markers for cancer progression.', 'The role of radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection in lymph node-positive prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Expression of miR-132 and miR-212 in prostate cancer and metastatic lymph node: Case report and revision of the literature.', 'Detection and Characterization of Circulating Tumor Cells Using Imaging Flow Cytometry-A Perspective Study.', 'BRCA Mutations in Ovarian and Prostate Cancer: Bench to Bedside.', 'BRCA Mutations in Prostate Cancer: Assessment, Implications and Treatment Considerations.', 'Low Tumor-to-Stroma Ratio Reflects Protective Role of Stroma against Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Prognostic and therapeutic significance of circulating tumor cells in patients with lung cancer.']"""

Human prostate cancer PC3 cells are insensitive to calcitriol treatment. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), the major calcitriol inactivating enzyme, by ketoconazole (KTZ) or RC2204 modulates calcitriol serum pharmacokinetics and biologic effects. Dexamethasone (Dex) was added to minimize calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia and as a steroid replacement for the KTZ inhibition of steroid biosynthesis cytochrome P450 enzymes. KTZ effectively inhibited time-dependent calcitriol-inducible CYP24A1 protein expression and enzyme activity in PC3 cells and C3H/HeJ mouse kidney tissues. Systemic calcitriol exposure area under the curve was higher in mice treated with a combination of calcitriol and KTZ than with calcitriol alone. KTZ and Dex synergistically potentiated calcitriol-mediated antiproliferative effects in PC3 cells in vitro; this effect was associated with enhanced apoptosis. After treatment with calcitriol and KTZ/Dex, although caspase-9 and caspase-3 were not activated and cytochrome c was not released by mitochondria, caspase-8 was activated and the truncated Bid protein level was increased. Translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor to the nucleus was observed, indicating a role of the apoptosis-inducing factor-mediated and caspase-independent apoptotic pathways. Calcitriol and KTZ/Dex combination suppressed the clonogenic survival and enhanced the growth inhibition observed with calcitriol alone in PC3 human prostate cancer xenograft mouse model. Our results show that the administration of calcitriol in combination with CYP24A1 inhibitor enhances antiproliferative effects, increases systemic calcitriol exposure, and promotes the activation of caspase-independent apoptosis pathway.""","""['Josephia R Muindi', 'Wei-Dong Yu', 'Yingyu Ma', 'Kristie L Engler', 'Rui-Xian Kong', 'Donald L Trump', 'Candace S Johnson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Inhibition of protein kinase CK2 reduces Cyp24a1 expression and enhances 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) antitumor activity in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Preclinical activity of ketoconazole in combination with calcitriol or the vitamin D analogue EB 1089 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Astemizole synergizes calcitriol antiproliferative activity by inhibiting CYP24A1 and upregulating VDR: a novel approach for breast cancer therapy.', 'The vitamin D/CYP24A1 story in cancer.', 'The antitumor efficacy of calcitriol: preclinical studies.', 'Association of CYP24A1 with survival and drug resistance in clinical cancer patients: a meta-analysis.', 'Bone Metastases of Diverse Primary Origin Frequently Express the VDR (Vitamin D Receptor) and CYP24A1.', 'Is Vitamin D Deficiency Related to Increased Cancer Risk in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus?', 'Anti-Tumor Effects of Ginsenoside 20(S)-Protopanaxadiol and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Combination in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cytosolic sequestration of the vitamin D receptor as a therapeutic option for vitamin D-induced hypercalcemia.']"""

Methods and materials:   Thirty-five patients with early stage prostate cancer underwent high-dose-rate brachytherapy to 2200 cGy and intensity modulated radiation therapy to 5040 cGy on a prospective study. Thirty patients received a single transperineal injection of 9-mL Hylaform between the prostate and rectum under transrectal ultrasound guidance immediately before the start of radiotherapy. Hylaform increased the separation between the prostate and rectum by 6-19 mm (median, 13 mm) at the start of radiotherapy. Five patients did not receive Hylaform and served as controls. We assessed gastrointestinal-related QOL using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Bowel Bother scores immediately before the start of and during the last week of radiotherapy.  Results:   At the beginning of intensity modulated radiation therapy, daily mean rectal doses were 74±8 cGy (mean±standard deviation) and 105±25 cGy (mean±standard deviation) with vs. without Hylaform, respectively (p=0.01).

Recent studies have shown a remarkable overexpression of IMP3 in different human malignant neoplasms and also revealed it as an important prognostic marker in some tumor entities. To our knowledge, IMP3 expression has not been investigated in prostate carcinomas so far.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical stainings for IMP3 were performed on tissue microarray (TMA) organized samples from 507 patients: 31 normal prostate tissues, 425 primary carcinomas and 51 prostate cancer metastases or castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). IMP3 immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively scored and correlated with clinical-pathologic parameters including survival.  Results:   IMP3 is significantly stronger expressed in prostate carcinomas compared to normal prostate tissues (p < 0.0001), but did not show significant correlation with the pT-stage, the proliferation index (MIB1), preoperative serum PSA level and the margin status. Only a weak and slightly significant correlation was found with the Gleason score and IMP3 expression failed to show prognostic significance in clinico-pathological correlation-analyses.  Conclusions:   Although IMP3 is overexpressed in a significant proportion of prostate cancer cases, which might be of importance for novel therapeutic approaches, it does not appear to possess any immediate diagnostic or prognostic value, limiting its potential as a tissue biomarker for prostate cancer.

In particular, the role of the NO-cGMP signalling pathway in regulating human bladder dome smooth muscle relaxation is questionable. Thus, we assessed the ability of a PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, to relax such tissue, and identified the signalling pathways involved in this relaxation.  Experimental approach:   Human bladder samples were obtained from 20 patients with no overactive bladder undergoing cystectomy for bladder cancer. Detrusor strips were mounted isometrically in Krebs-HEPES solution. Concentration-response curves for sildenafil (10 nM-30 microM) were generated in the presence of various inhibitors on carbachol-induced pre-contraction.  Key results:   Sildenafil relaxed carbachol-pre-contracted human detrusor strips, starting at 3 microM. This effect was not modified by NO donors, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (10 microM) or sodium nitroprusside (300 nM), but was significantly inhibited by inhibition of guanylate cyclase (with ODQ, 10 microM) or adenylyl cyclase (with MDL-12,330A, 10 microM), by the ATP-sensitive potassium channel inhibitor, glibenclamide (10 microM), or inhibition of the large (with iberiotoxin, 30 nM) or small (with apamin, 100 nM) conductance calcium-activated potassium channels.  Conclusions and implications:   Sildenafil-induced relaxation of human detrusor smooth muscle involved cGMP-, cAMP- and K(+) channel-dependent signalling pathways, with a minor contribution from NO. The effect of this sildenafil-induced relaxation on the clinical benefit of PDE5 inhibitors on urinary storage symptoms in men deserves further investigation.""","""['S Oger', 'D Behr-Roussel', 'D Gorny', 'T Lebret', 'P Validire', 'X Cathelineau', 'L Alexandre', 'F Giuliano']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Br J Pharmacol""","""['Powerful relaxation of phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor rolipram in the pig and human bladder neck.', 'Sildenafil effect on the human bladder involves the L-cysteine/hydrogen sulfide pathway: a novel mechanism of action of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.', 'Nitric oxide-induced cGMP accumulation in the mouse bladder is not related to smooth muscle relaxation.', 'Relaxant effects of sildenafil on the human isolated bladder neck.', 'Sildenafil in ophthalmology: An update.', 'Combination and Novel Pharmacologic Agents for OAB.', 'Drugs Currently Undergoing Preclinical or Clinical Trials for the Treatment of Overactive Bladder: A Review.', 'Daily low dose of tadalafil improves pain and frequency in bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis patients.', 'The Frequency-Dependence of Pre- and Postganglionic Nerve Stimulation of Pig and Rat Bladder.', 'Functional nitrergic innervation of smooth muscle structures in the mucosa of pig lower urinary tract.']"""

Patients and methods:   We interrogated an initial cohort of 220 men with localized PCA using fluorescence in situ hybridization for ERG rearrangements and PTEN genomic deletions.  Results:   The incidences of ERG rearrangements and PTEN deletions in PCA were significantly higher than in high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and benign prostate tissue (P < 0.001). ERG rearrangements and PTEN deletions were detected in 41.9 and 42.6% of patients' tumours, respectively. ERG rearrangements were never detected in benign prostate tissue, while PTEN aberrations were present at a basal level of 4.6%. PTEN hemizygous deletions showed higher frequency than homozygous deletions within each diagnostic category from benign prostate tissue to HGPIN and PCA (P ≤ 0.001). Furthermore, in 29 patients where all three tissues were available, PTEN genomic aberrations in PCA were significantly different from those in benign tissue (P = 0.005) and HGPIN (P = 0.02), reflecting the accumulation of genomic aberrations in the early stages of disease progression.

The underlying pathology for preoperative ED may adversely affect survival following radical prostatectomy (RP). We examined the association between preoperative ED and survival following RP.  Materials and methods:   Between 1983 and 2000, a single surgeon performed RP on 2511 men, with preoperative ED (ED group, n= 231, 9.2%) or without ED (No ED group, n= 2280, 90.8%). We retrospectively analysed their CVD-specific survival (CVDSS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), non-PCSS (NPCSS) and overall survival (OS) from time of surgery.  Results:   With median follow-up of 13 years after RP, 449 men (18%) died (140 from prostate cancer, 309 from other causes). Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated significant differences in CVDSS (P < 0.001), NPCSS (P < 0.001) and OS (P < 0.001), but not in PCSS (P= 0.12), between the ED group vs No ED group. In univariate proportional hazards analyses, preoperative ED was associated with a significant decrease in OS, hazard ratio (HR), 1.71 (95% CI, 1.34-2.23), P < 0.001. However, in multivariable analyses, the association of ED with survival became non-significant (HR, 1.25 (95% CI, 0.97-1.66), P= 0.111) after adjusting for other prognostic factors, such as age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, pathologic stage, body mass index and Charlson Comorbidity Index.  Conclusions:   Preoperative ED is associated with decreased overall survival and survival from causes other than prostate cancer following RP.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Fifty patients (median age 61) with a median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 5.8 ng/ml underwent 3T endorectal coil MRI prior to biopsy. 3D TRUS images were obtained just prior to standard TRUS-guided 12-core sextant biopsies wherein an electromagnetic positioning device was attached to the needle guide and TRUS probe in order to track the position of each needle pass. The 3D-TRUS image documenting the location of each biopsy was fused electronically to the T2-weighted MRI. Each biopsy needle track was marked on the TRUS images and these were then transposed onto the MRI. Each biopsy site was classified pathologically as positive or negative for cancer and the Gleason score was determined. RESULTS The location of all (n= 605) needle biopsy tracks was successfully documented on the T2-weighted (T2W) MRI. Among 50 patients, 20 had 56 positive cores. At the sites of biopsy, T2W signal was considered 'positive' for cancer (i.e. low in signal intensity) in 34 of 56 sites. CONCLUSION It is feasible to document the location of TRUS-guided prostate biopsies on pre-procedure MRI by fusing the pre-procedure TRUS to an endorectal coil MRI using electromagnetic needle tracking.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Analysis of datasets that include both the underlying cause and all other mentioned causes on death certificates (together, termed 'mentions'): the Oxford Record Linkage Study, 1979-2006, and English national data, 1995-2006. RESULTS In the Oxford region, underlying-cause mortality from BPH fell from 45 deaths per million in 1979 to 2.4 in 2006. For mentions, the respective rates were 93 and 7.1. In England, underlying-cause mortality reduced from 9.2 deaths per million in 1995 to 4.5 deaths per million in 2006. For mentions, the rates were 20 and 9.9 deaths per million. When BPH was certified on death certificates, it was selected as the underlying cause of death on fewer than half. Underlying-cause mortality for prostate cancer in Oxford increased from 213 deaths per million in 1979 to 335 by 1991, and thereafter declined to 253 deaths per million in 2006. Mentions-mortality in Oxford followed a similar pattern. In later years, when there were comparable data for Oxford and England, the pattern of decline in England was similar to that in Oxford. Where mentioned, prostate cancer was coded as the underlying cause of death on three-quarters of death certificates. CONCLUSIONS The fall in BPH mortality, evident in statistics on underlying cause, was confirmed by statistics on all certified causes of death. The fall is dramatic in scale, likely to be attributable to clinical care, and could be regarded as an indicator of improving standards of care.

Patients and methods:   Forty-three patients underwent RRP for histologically proven localized prostate cancer. The vesico-urethral anastomosis was evaluated 8 days after RRP by CG and CEUS. Any peri-anastomotic leakage was assessed and determined in CG and CEUS as follows: no extravasation (EV), small leakage (≤0.5 cm), moderate leakage (>0.5 cm to ≤2 cm), large leakage (>2 cm diameter of EV seen).  Results:   In total, 21 (49%) patients showed a watertight anastomosis. Ten (23%), two (4.7%) and ten (23%) patients showed a small, intermediate and large EV, respectively. In 31 cases (72%) there was 100% agreement of CG and CEUS for detection of no, moderate and large EV, respectively. In nine cases a small and in two cases a moderate EV was categorized as watertight anastomosis by CEUS. Only in one case did CG detect a small EV where a large EV was detected in CEUS. The agreement between both methods was 95% for detecting absence or large leakages.  Conclusion:   CEUS is a promising imaging modality that seems to be equivalent to CG for detecting the presence of a large anastomotic leakage that is clinically relevant for postoperative persistence of the indwelling catheter. CEUS could be a cheap and time-saving alternative to the CG without exposure of the patient to radiation.""","""['Gita M Schoeppler', 'Alexander Buchner', 'Dirk Zaak', 'Wael Khoder', 'Michael Staehler', 'Christian G Stief', 'Maximilian F Reiser', 'Dirk-Andre Clevert']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Transrectal contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, transrectal ultrasonography and retrograde cystography for the detection of vesicourethral anastomosis leakage after radical retropubic prostatectomy: a prospective comparative evaluation.', 'Assessing the vesico-urethral anastomosis after radical retropubic prostatectomy: transrectal ultrasonography can replace cystography.', 'A prospective evaluation of conventional cystography for detection of urine leakage at the vesicourethral anastomosis site after radical prostatectomy based on computed tomography.', 'All you need to know about urethrovesical anastomotic urinary leakage following radical prostatectomy.', 'Safety and outcome of early catheter removal after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Percutaneous embolization of contained iatrogenic vesicourethral fistula using Amplatzer vascular plug and N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate: a case report.', 'Microbubble-enhanced ultrasound to demonstrate urethral transection in a case of penile fracture.', 'Evaluation of Lymphorrhea and Incidence of Lymphoceles: 4DryField® PH in Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy.', 'The impact of ultrasound in urology.']"""

Patients and methods:   The charts of 499 patients were retrospectively reviewed to identify prognostic risk factors for the presence of LNM. Pathohistological data and Gleason score of the radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, number of removed nodes, number of positive lymph nodes, and anatomical distribution of LNM were tabulated and evaluated. A correlation between clinical stage, preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), biopsy Gleason score, number of biopsies taken, percentage of positive biopsies and the presence of LNM were calculated. All 499 men underwent retropubic RP and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy (EPLND).  Results:   LNM were identified in 29 (5.8%) patients. A prediction model based on clinical stage, PSA, and biopsy Gleason score had a predictive accuracy of 79.2%. The addition of number of positive biopsies and % positive cores improved its predictive accuracy to 81.5% and 87.8%, respectively. The predicted frequency of LNM by the original nomogram was 7.4% and differed by less than 3% with the actual observation of LNM. The predictive accuracy of the nomogram was 81.5% as compared with 87.8% of the prediction model of this study.  Conclusions:   The percentage of positive cores involved with PCA is the most reliable predictor of LNM and indicates the need for EPLND.

Identification of the risk of death from prostate cancer and death from all causes using information available at the time of baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement appears to be particularly pertinent.  Methods:   The Duke Prostate Center database was used to identify men who had their PSA level measured over the past 20 years. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess whether baseline PSA, race, and age at baseline PSA could predict death from prostate cancer and death from all causes after baseline PSA measurement. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to analyze the accuracy of baseline PSA as a continuous variable in predicting death from prostate cancer.  Results:   A total of 4568 men diagnosed with prostate cancer after baseline PSA measurement were included. On multivariate analysis, baseline PSA levels of 4.0 to 9.9 ng/mL and ≥10 ng/mL were associated with significantly higher rates of death from prostate cancer compared with PSA levels <2.5 ng/mL. An advanced age at baseline PSA and African American race were associated with a higher death rate from prostate cancer and death from all causes. The area under the ROC curve for baseline PSA predicting death was 0.839. When a baseline PSA of 10 ng/mL was chosen to predict death from prostate cancer, the corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 77% and of 78%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Baseline PSA appears to be a reliable and independent predictor of death from prostate cancer.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the most common treatment for advanced prostate cancer patients; however, ADT fails in nearly all cases resulting in castration resistant or androgen-insensitive (AI) disease. In many cases, this progression results from dysregulation of the pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins. Inhibition of pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins, therefore, may be an effective strategy to delay the onset of AI disease. Gossypol, a small molecule inhibitor of pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins, has been demonstrated to inhibit AI prostate cancer growth. The apoptotic effect of gossypol, however, has been demonstrated to be attenuated by the presence of androgen in a prostate cancer xenograft mouse model (Vertebral Cancer of Prostate [VCaP]) treated with AT-101 (R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid). This study was undertaken to better understand the in vitro effects of androgen receptor (AR) on AT-101-induced apoptosis. VCaP cells treated with AT-101 demonstrated an increase in apoptosis and downregulation of Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins. Upon AR activation in combination with AT-101 treatment, apoptosis is reduced, cell survival increases, and caspase activation is attenuated. Akt and X inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) are downregulated in the presence of AT-101, and AR stimulation rescues protein expression.

They can unwind double-stranded RNA and also contribute to the remodeling of ribonucleoprotein complexes. These activities of p68/p72 are required for efficient RNA splicing and microRNA processing. In addition, p68/p72 perform functions that are independent of their enzymatic activity. This is especially common to their role in gene regulation, where p68/p72 coactivate various transcription factors, including the tumor suppressor p53, estrogen receptor alpha and beta-catenin. P68/p72 are posttranslationally modified by SUMO attachment and phosphorylation that regulate their coactivation potential, binding to known interactants or protein stability. Knock-out mouse models revealed that both DDX5 and DDX17 are essential genes during development. Furthermore, together with their ability to stimulate cell proliferation and prevent apoptosis, the reported overexpression of p68/p72 in three of the major human cancers (colon, breast, prostate) strongly suggests that p68/p72 promote tumorigenesis and might even represent proto-oncoproteins.

On the basis of miRNA microarray data, we found that miR-145 is significantly downregulated in prostate cancer.  Methods and results:   We investigated the expression and functional significance of miR-145 in prostate cancer. The expression of miR-145 was low in all the prostate cell lines tested (PC3, LNCaP and DU145) compared with the normal cell line, PWR-1E, and in cancerous regions of human prostate tissue when compared with the matched adjacent normal. Overexpression of miR-145 in PC3-transfected cells resulted in increased apoptosis and an increase in cells in the G2/M phase, as detected by flow cytometry. Investigation of the mechanisms of inactivation of miR-145 through epigenetic pathways revealed significant DNA methylation of the miR-145 promoter region in prostate cancer cell lines. Microarray analyses of miR-145-overexpressing PC3 cells showed upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene TNFSF10, which was confirmed by real-time PCR and western analysis.  Conclusion:   One of the genes significantly upregulated by miR-145 overexpression is the proapoptotic gene TNFSF10.

Although most studies have shown that staining for NKX3.1 protein is positive in the majority of primary prostatic adenocarcinomas, it has been shown to be downregulated in many high-grade prostate cancers, and completely lost in the majority of metastatic prostate cancers (eg, in 65% to 78% of lesions). A recent study showed that NKX3.1 staining with a novel antibody was highly sensitive and specific for high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma when compared with high-grade urothelial carcinoma. This raised the question that this antibody may perform better than earlier used antibodies in metastatic prostate tumors. However, the sensitivity and specificity for prostate carcinomas for this antibody in metastatic lesions was not determined. Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic-specific acid phosphatase (PSAP) are excellent tissue markers of prostate cancer, at times they may be expressed at low levels, focally, or not at all in poorly differentiated primary and metastatic prostatic adenocarcinomas. The purpose of this study was to determine the performance of NKX3.1 as a marker of metastatic adenocarcinoma of prostatic origin. Immunohistochemical staining against NKX3.1, PSA, and PSAP was carried out on a tissue microarray (TMA) (0.6-mm tissue cores) of hormone naïve metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma specimens from lymph nodes, bone, and soft tissue. To determine the specificity of NKX3.1 for prostatic adenocarcinoma, we used TMAs that contained cancers from various sites including the urinary bladder, breast, colon, salivary gland, stomach, pancreas, thyroid, and central nervous system, and standard paraffin sections of cancers from other sites including the adrenal cortex, kidney, liver, lung, and testis. Overall 349 nonprostatic tumors were evaluated. Any nuclear staining for NKX3.1 was considered positive and the percentage of cells with nuclear staining and their mean intensity level were assessed visually. Sensitivity was calculated by considering a case positive if any TMA core was positive. The sensitivity for identifying metastatic prostatic adenocarcinomas overall was 98.6% (68/69 cases positive) for NKX3.1, 94.2% (65/69 cores positive) for PSA, and 98.6% (68/69 cores positive) for PSAP. The specificity of NKX3.1 was 99.7% (1/349 nonprostatic tumors positive). The sole positive nonprostatic cancer case was an invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. NKX3.1 seems to be a highly sensitive and specific tissue marker of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma. In the appropriate clinical setting, the addition of IHC staining for NKX3.1, along with other prostate-restricted markers, may prove to be a valuable adjunct to definitively determine prostatic origin in poorly differentiated metastatic carcinomas.""","""['Bora Gurel', 'Tehmina Z Ali', 'Elizabeth A Montgomery', 'Shahnaz Begum', 'Jessica Hicks', 'Michael Goggins', 'Charles G Eberhart', 'Douglas P Clark', 'Charles J Bieberich', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Angelo M De Marzo']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['The role of P501S and PSA in the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Performance of different prostate specific antibodies in the cytological diagnosis of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Immunohistochemical differentiation of high-grade prostate carcinoma from urothelial carcinoma.', 'Immunohistochemistry in diagnostic surgical pathology of the prostate.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'A Blood-Based Immune Gene Signature with Prognostic Significance in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'ETV4 mediates dosage-dependent prostate tumor initiation and cooperates with p53 loss to generate prostate cancer.', 'Identification of Prognostic Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Metastasis Using Penalized Additive Hazards Regression Model.', 'Metastatic prostate cancer presenting as a posterior mediastinal mass: A rare presentation.', 'Interpretable and context-free deconvolution of multi-scale whole transcriptomic data with UniCell deconvolve.']"""

The efficacy of the CREKA peptide was then increased by replacing some residues with nonproteinogenic counterparts, which increased the stability of the peptide in the circulation. Treatment of mice bearing orthotopic human prostate cancer tumors with the targeted nanoworms caused extensive clotting in tumor vessels, whereas no clotting was observed in the vessels of normal tissues.

However, their cyclooxygenase (COX)-inhibitory activities cause severe gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicities, limiting their chronic use. Recent studies suggest that COX-independent mechanisms may be responsible for the chemopreventive benefits of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and support the potential for the development of a novel generation of sulindac derivatives lacking COX inhibition for cancer chemoprevention. A prototypic sulindac derivative with a N,N-dimethylammonium substitution called sulindac sulfide amide (SSA) was recently identified to be devoid of COX-inhibitory activity yet displays much more potent tumor cell growth-inhibitory activity in vitro compared with sulindac sulfide. In this study, we investigated the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway as a potential target for its COX-independent antineoplastic mechanism and evaluated its chemopreventive efficacy against prostate carcinogenesis using the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate model. The results showed that SSA significantly suppressed the growth of human and mouse prostate cancer cells expressing AR in strong association with G(1) arrest, and decreased AR level and AR-dependent transactivation. Dietary SSA consumption dramatically attenuated prostatic growth and suppressed AR-dependent glandular epithelial lesion progression through repressing cell proliferation in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate mice, whereas it did not significantly affect neuroendocrine carcinoma growth.

Eighteen patients (32.7%) had measurable soft tissue lesions, whereas 52 patients (94.5%) had bone metastases. During the 21-day treatment cycle, docetaxel (70 mg/m(2)) was administered once every 21 days and oral prednisolone (5 mg), twice daily.

We show that AR activation promotes ErbB3 degradation in androgen-dependent cells, and that this effect is mediated by AR-dependent transcriptional upregulation of neuregulin receptor degradation protein-1 (Nrdp1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets ErbB3 for degradation but whose role in PCa has not been previously examined. Therefore, AW decreases Nrdp1 expression, promoting ErbB3 protein accumulation, and leading to AR-independent proliferation. However, in CRPC sublines of LNCaP and CWR22, which strongly overexpress the AR, ErbB3 levels remain elevated due to constitutive suppression of Nrdp1, which prevents AR regulation of Nrdp1. Our observations point to a model of CRPC development in which progression of PCa to castration resistance is associated with the inability of AR to transcriptionally regulate Nrdp1, and predict that inhibition of ErbB3 during AW may impair CRPC development.""","""['Liqun Chen', 'Salma Siddiqui', 'Swagata Bose', 'Benjamin Mooso', 'Alfredo Asuncion', 'Roble G Bedolla', 'Ruth Vinall', 'Clifford G Tepper', 'Regina Gandour-Edwards', 'Xubao Shi', 'Xiao-Hua Lu', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Rohit Mehra', 'Ralph W Devere White', 'Kermit L Carraway rd', 'Paramita M Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Transcription of Nrdp1 by the androgen receptor is regulated by nuclear filamin A in prostate cancer.', 'The ErbB family and androgen receptor signaling are targets of\xa0Celecoxib in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor variants occur frequently in castration resistant prostate cancer metastases.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor transcriptional activity is required for heregulin-1β-mediated nuclear localization of the HER3/ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase.', 'Cisplatin-induced increase in heregulin 1 and its attenuation by the monoclonal ErbB3 antibody seribantumab in bladder cancer.', 'm6A-modified circFNDC3B inhibits colorectal cancer stemness and metastasis via RNF41-dependent ASB6 degradation.', 'Co-Targeting ErbB Receptors and the PI3K/AKT Axis in Androgen-Independent Taxane-Sensitive and Taxane-Resistant Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'HER3 Is an Actionable Target in Advanced Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, the biological role of STAMP1 in prostate cancer cells, or its expression profile at the protein level, is unknown. Here, we find that ectopic expression of STAMP1 significantly increased proliferation of DU145 prostate cancer cells as well as COS-7 cells in vitro; conversely, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of STAMP1 expression in LNCaP cells inhibited cell growth and, at least partially, induced cell cycle arrest. In parallel, there were alterations in cell cycle-regulatory gene expression. Knockdown of STAMP1 expression in LNCaP cells also induced significant apoptosis under basal conditions as well as in response to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) alone, or TRAIL + AKT inhibitor LY294002, previously established apoptotic agents in LNCaP cells. Consistently, LNCaP cells with short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of STAMP1 were dramatically retarded in their ability to grow as xenografts in nude mice. Interestingly, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which has previously been implicated in prostate cancer progression, was significantly increased on ectopic expression of STAMP1 in DU145 cells and, conversely, was strongly downregulated on STAMP1 knockdown in LNCaP cells. In the normal prostate, STAMP1 protein is localized to the cytosol and the cell membrane of the prostate epithelial cells; furthermore, its expression is increased in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate. Taken together, these data suggest that STAMP1 is required for prostate cancer growth, which may be a useful target in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Ling Wang', 'Yang Jin', 'Yke Jildouw Arnoldussen', 'Ida Jonson', 'Su Qu', 'Gunhild M Maelandsmo', 'Alexandr Kristian', 'Bjørn Risberg', 'Håkon Waehre', 'Håvard E Danielsen', 'Fahri Saatcioglu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Molecular cloning and characterization of STAMP1, a highly prostate-specific six transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in prostate cancer.', 'Apoptosis induction in prostate cancer cells and xenografts by combined treatment with Apo2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and CPT-11.', 'Molecular cloning and characterization of STAMP2, an androgen-regulated six transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in prostate cancer.', 'STAMPing at the crossroads of normal physiology and disease states.', 'Emerging role of nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) in cancer biology.', 'A Molecular Docking Study of Human STEAP2 for the Discovery of New Potential Anti-Prostate Cancer Chemotherapeutic Candidates.', 'STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulatory Roles of Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate Family Members in the Occurrence and Development of Malignant Tumors.', 'Novel potent anti-STEAP1 bispecific antibody to redirect T cells for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Classification of Homo sapiens gene behavior using linear discriminant analysis fused with minimum entropy mapping.']"""

ProstaCaid shows growth inhibitory effects on both human and mouse AD prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and CASP 2.1) and AI prostate cancer cells (PC3 and CASP 1.1) in a dose-/time-dependent manner. Consistently, long-term treatment with ProstaCaid also reduced colony formation capacities of prostate cancer cells. Flow cytometry assays revealed that ProstaCaid induces G2/M arrest and apoptosis in LNCaP and PC3 cells after 72 hours of treatment. Immunoblotting assay demonstrated that 25 microg/mL of ProstaCaid treatment resulted in (1) the reduction of cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and Cdc2 expression in a time-dependent way; (2) increase in p21(WAF1/Cip1) as early as 12 hours after the treatments in PC3 cells and reduction to base line at the 72-hour time point; and (3) repression of Bcl-2, BclxL, and induction of Bim as well as the cleavages of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) at 72 hours of treatment, suggesting caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, ProstaCaid suppressed activation of AKT and MAPK signaling pathways in PC3 and LNCaP cells by reducing phosphorylation levels of AKT, its downstream target S6 ribosomal protein and GSK3beta, and ERK1/2, respectively.

Material and methods:   We did retrospective analyses of guidelines adherence for all PCa patients receiving curative treatment at the Norwegian Radium Hospital from 2004 to 2007 after the introduction of robot-assisted prostatectomy and after-loading brachytherapy. The patients were classified into three groups in relation to guidelines: the accordance, accordance after discussion, and the deviance groups. In time Period I (2004-2005) the 2003 EAU guidelines were used and in Period II (2006-2007) in-house guidelines with minor modifications of EAU were applied.  Results:   During the observation period 859 patients had curative treatment for PCa, and 83% of the patients were treated according to guidelines. In the deviance group (N=146), 119 men (82%) got prostatectomy instead of radiotherapy. The reasons for deviation in the second period were age >65 years (N=70) and surgery in cases with T3 tumors (N=10), Gleason score >8 (N=13) and combinations (N=26). Deviances from guidelines in the radiotherapy group (N=27) mainly concerned patient selecting this treatment due to expectations of preserving sexuality and/or fertility.  Conclusions:   In spite of acceptable overall compliance to guidelines for curative PCa treatment, the proportion of non-adherence should not been overseen, in particular when new treatment technologies are introduced. Guidelines for PCa need to be monitored regularly, and the compliance to guidelines has to be assessed on a regular basis.

P504S is overexpressed in prostatic carcinoma and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia with cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. p63 has positive immunoreactivity in basal cell nuclei of benign prostatic glands. Many researchers use a combination of these antibodies and their different colors.  Objective:   To evaluate the usefulness of a single-color P504S/p63 cocktail immunostain in verifying prostatic carcinoma within the seminal vesicle.  Design:   Sections from 57 radical prostatectomy specimens of pathologic stage pT3b that contain seminal vesicle with prostatic carcinoma involvement were immunostained with primary antibodies against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and a cocktail of antibodies against P504S and p63.  Results:   Prostatic carcinoma cells from all 57 cases were diffusely positive for P504S, PSA, and PAP with cytoplasmic staining and no p63 nuclear staining. Seminal vesicle epithelium from all 57 cases was negative for all 3 markers with distinct p63 nuclear staining of the basal cells. Benign prostatic tissue was positive for PSA and PAP, as well as for p63, but negative for P504S.  Conclusions:   The P504S/p63 one-color cocktail is a practical and cost-effective stain to differentiate prostatic carcinoma that involves the seminal vesicle from seminal vesicle epithelium. It is superior to PSA or PAP when sections contain both seminal vesicle and benign glands because PSA and PAP cannot distinguish benign from malignant glands.""","""['Aaron M Harvey', 'Beverly Grice', 'Candice Hamilton', 'Luan D Truong', 'Jae Y Ro', 'Alberto G Ayala', 'Qihui Jim Zhai']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Arch Pathol Lab Med""","""['P504S immunohistochemical detection in 405 prostatic specimens including 376 18-gauge needle biopsies.', 'Immunohistochemical stains for p63 and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, versus a cocktail comprising both, in the diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma: a comparison of the immunohistochemical staining of 430 foci in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy tissues.', 'Diagnostic utility of a p63/alpha-methyl-CoA-racemase (p504s) cocktail in atypical foci in the prostate.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Seminal vesicle intraepithelial neoplasia versus basal cell hyperplasia in a seminal vesicle.', 'Histopathology of Prostate Cancer.', 'Diagnostic utility of E-cadherin and P120 catenin cocktail immunostain in distinguishing DCIS from LCIS.', 'Emerging roles of human prostatic Acid phosphatase.']"""

Incidence of newly diagnosed cancers is also the second highest in the Gulf with 11%. Research conducted between 1997-2007 revealed that the most frequent cancers in males: stomach 10%, non-Hodgkins lymphoma 8.6% and prostate 7% while in females: breast 18.9%, thyroid 8.3% and cervix uteri 6.5%. A population-based registry was established in 1996 to compile an accurate database and monitor cancer trends. There is a rigorous follow up of reported cases. Unfortunately most patients report at the hospitals in advanced stages which complicate pain management. All treatment modalities of cancer are available in Oman at the two centers, Royal Hospital and SQUH. There is a continuous effort to develop national educational guidelines, protocols for cancer treatment, palliative care and pain management (PM).  Historical perspectives and trends in the management of pain:   In 1970s Omanis used traditional medicine, wassam (moxibustion), to treat pain. In 1988 severe pain was treated in hospitals with intramuscular opioid, whenever necessary (PRN). 1989 SQUH approved use of both parenteral and oral narcotics, received its first consignment, and started PM. The Ministry of Health (MOH) was concerned with possible misuse and for 8 years, thereafter, SQUH was the only hospital allowed to import, stock, prescribe and dispense oral narcotics. Legal requirement to obtain opioids in Oman involves MOH and World Health Organization (WHO) and there is a control as to who can prescribe for both inpatient and outpatient. The drugs available to control pain include non opioids, weak opioids, but the only strong opioids used for severe cancer pain are morphine and Fentanyl. This is complemented with adjuvant drugs. We use the ""WHO Ladder"" to guide us in the management of pain. Three different cases have been presented to see how PM of cancer patients has evolved from using only non-opioid in 1993, to using intramuscular pethidine in 1995, then to using morphine with adjuvants in 1999. Referral of patients to the PM Team has improved the pain control and at present even without referral, pain is controlled more effectively.  Conclusion:   There is no doubt that the Sultanate of Oman has progressed tremendously since 1970. The Government is working very hard and is taking major steps to improve cancer care in order to meet the International Bench Mark. Each 5 year plan focuses on actual needs. One of the important needs that have been addressed is the management of pain which has significantly improved. Factors that have improved PM in Oman include the introduction of the PM Teams, training of Nurses and Doctors, follow up of the PM services in the clinical areas, authorizing MOH hospitals to use oral opioids, opening of the National Oncology Centre with Radiation Therapy, inter institutional discussions and development of guidelines, implementation of WHO Guidelines on PM and audits, peer reviews and research.""","""['Salma Said Mahfudh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Is the use of transdermal fentanyl inappropriate according to the WHO guidelines and the EAPC recommendations?

Men with prostate cancer and their partners face special challenges. A range of symptoms that result from monitoring patients and side effects of treatment may reverse the quality of life and intimate relations between patient and partner. However, patients often are reluctant to bring up their distress about the symptoms, leading to an underestimation and reduction in optimal symptom control. As a result of their illness, chronically-ill male patients often experience elevated levels of stress, daily activities are often limited, they are frustrated about the unpredictable course of the illness and its symptoms, and are immersed in fears about their present and future social identity. Most of them avoid disclosure about their illness--when and where possible--and place great importance on sustaining a normal life. Factors related to limiting disclosure include men's low perceived need for support, fear of stigmatization, the need to minimize the threat of illness to aid coping, practical necessities in the workplace, and the desire to avoid burdening others. This paper contributes to an understanding of the complex issues of disclosure related to prostate cancer patients and raises issues about how best to be helpful, within their cultural and social framework. It also deals with feelings of shame, guilt and inadequacy as the cause--or consequence--of concealing the illness. The oral presentation will use a clinical example of secrecy and the subsequent conflicts and quandaries of a religious person diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer.

It exhibits tumor suppressor activities in some cancers (thyroid, brain, breast and colorectum), but is aberrantly upregulated in cancers of lung, stomach and prostate. We investigated its epigenetic alterations and functions in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). With semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR, we found that WNT5A was silenced or downregulated in 5 of 18 ESCC cell lines, but expressed in normal esophagus tissue and immortalized normal esophageal epithelial cell lines. Promoter CpG methylation of WNT5A was detected in 4 of the 5 downregulated ESCC cell lines, while 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment induced WNT5A expression and demethylated its promoter in silenced cell lines. WNT5A promoter methylation was frequently detected in primary ESCC (24/36, 67%), but less frequently and weakly in paired surgical marginal esophageal tissues (8/36, 22%; p < 0.01), while no methylation was detected in seven normal esophageal epithelial tissues from healthy donors. Ectopic expression of WNT5A resulted in significant inhibition of clonogenicity and motility of ESCC cells, accompanied by a dramatic decrease of intracellular β-catenin protein level and β-catenin transcriptional activity. In summary, we show that WNT5A is frequently silenced in ESCC by promoter methylation and exhibits tumor suppressor properties through antagonizing the WNT/β-catenin pathway. The epigenetic disruption of WNT5A would thus contribute directly to the aberrant activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling during ESCC pathogenesis.""","""['Jisheng Li', 'Jianming Ying', 'Yichao Fan', 'Longtao Wu', 'Ying Ying', 'Anthony T C Chan', 'Gopesh Srivastava', 'Qian Tao']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['WNT5A exhibits tumor-suppressive activity through antagonizing the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and is frequently methylated in colorectal cancer.', 'Epigenetic identification of receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 as a functional tumor suppressor inhibiting β-catenin and AKT signaling but frequently methylated in common carcinomas.', 'Epigenetic deregulations of Wnt/β-catenin and transforming growth factor beta-Smad pathways in esophageal cancer: Outcome of DNA methylation.', 'Epigenetic disruption of the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway in human cancers.', 'Promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Kinesin family member 23 knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in esophageal carcinoma by inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Epigenetic modifications in esophageal cancer: An evolving biomarker.', 'ROR2 regulates self-renewal and maintenance of hair follicle stem cells.', 'The value of WNT5A as prognostic and immunological biomarker in pan-cancer.', 'Retracted Article: Panax notoginseng saponins regulate VEGF to suppress esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression via DVL3-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling.']"""

Protontherapy has accumulated a considerable experience in the management of selected rare malignancies such as uveal melanomas and base of the skull chordomas and chondrosarcomas. The growing interest for exploring new and more common conditions, such as prostate, lung, liver, ENT, breast carcinomas, as well as the implementation of large pediatric programs advocated by many experts has been challenged up to now by the limited access to operational proton facilities, and by the relatively slow pace of technical developments in terms of ion production, beam shaping and modelling, on-line verification etc. One challenge today is to deliver dynamic techniques with intensity modulation in clinical facilities as a standard treatment. We concentrate in this paper on the evolution of clinical indications as well as the potentialities of new technological concepts on ion production, such as dielectric walls and laser-plasma interactions. While these concepts could sooner or later translate into prototypes of highly compact equipments that would make easier the implantation of cost-effective hospital-based facilities, the feasibility of their clinical use must still be proved.""","""['A Mazal', 'J-L Habrand', 'S Delacroix', 'J Datchary', 'R Dendale', 'L Desjardins', 'R Ferrand', 'V Malka', 'A Fourquet']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Bull Cancer""","""['Should positive phase III clinical trial data be required before proton beam therapy is more widely adopted?

Here we show that the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has prosurvival effects and chronically activates the Jak2/STAT3 signalling pathway in a model of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-1). We demonstrate that the antiinflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), which also permanently activates its canonical signalling pathway through SMAD proteins in BPH-1 cells, modifies the effects of IL-6 on cell proliferation. Importantly, TGF-beta1 inhibits IL-6 signal transduction by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of STAT3. This effect is associated with decreased expression of Jak2 at both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, we showed that TGF-beta1 inhibits IL-6-induced expression of the cancer-associated gene MUC1. These observations demonstrated a novel interaction between TGF-beta1 and IL-6 signalling and suggested another mechanism of how defects in TGF-beta signalling, frequently associated with prostate pathologies, can contribute to the disruption of tissue homeostasis.""","""['Andrea Starsíchová', 'Eva Lincová', 'Zuzana Pernicová', 'Alois Kozubík', 'Karel Soucek']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Transforming growth factor-beta1 activates interleukin-6 expression in prostate cancer cells through the synergistic collaboration of the Smad2, p38-NF-kappaB, JNK, and Ras signaling pathways.', 'Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase by TGF-beta1 via TbetaRII and Smad7 dependent mechanisms in human bronchial epithelial BEP2D cells.', 'Profiling molecular targets of TGF-beta1 in prostate fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation.', 'IL-6 regulates MMP-10 expression via JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line.', 'Epidemiology and natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'A Novel Insight into the Immune-Related Interaction of Inflammatory Cytokines in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Cleistanthins A and B Ameliorate Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Castrated Rats by Regulating Apoptosis and Cell Differentiation.', 'LncRNA DIO3OS regulated by TGF-β1 and resveratrol enhances epithelial mesenchymal transition of benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial cells and proliferation of prostate stromal cells.', 'Quantitative proteomics analysis identifies MUC1 as an effect sensor of EGFR inhibition.', 'Infiltrating mast cells enhance benign prostatic hyperplasia through IL-6/STAT3/Cyclin D1 signals.']"""

It has been observed that in addition to responding to cognate hormones with transcription activation, once hormone bound they are also capable of rapid responses following association with signaling effectors in the extra nuclear compartment. This novel aspect of steroid hormone action could influence our view of the cross talk between growth factor and steroid receptors. Increasing evidence shows that in hormone-responsive cells, a cross talk occurs between growth factors (EGF, IGF-1) and steroid hormone receptors that reciprocally regulate their action. To date, this has mostly been explained by modulation of steroid receptor transcriptional activity through growth factor receptor signaling activation. However, it is now known that growth factors might also act on extra nuclear steroid receptors, activating them via a hormone-independent mechanism. On the other hand, extra nuclear steroid receptors can regulate growth factor receptor activity either directly interfering with their transduction pathways, or inducing autocrine growth factor secretion. Here we discuss findings indicating that EGF, like steroid hormones, induces association of steroid receptors with Src thereby activating pathways that can trigger cell proliferation and migration. Since mammary and prostate cancers respond to both steroid hormones and growth factors, this association might be a putative target for human cancer therapy. Findings from our laboratory supporting this view are discussed.""","""['Antimo Migliaccio', 'Gabriella Castoria', 'Pia Giovannelli', 'Ferdinando Auricchio']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Steroid receptor regulation of epidermal growth factor signaling through Src in breast and prostate cancer cells: steroid antagonist action.', 'Sex-steroid hormones and EGF signalling in breast and prostate cancer cells: targeting the association of Src with steroid receptors.', 'Crosstalk between EGFR and extranuclear steroid receptors.', 'Crosstalk between steroid receptors and the c-Src-receptor tyrosine kinase pathways: implications for cell proliferation.', 'Rapid signalling pathway activation by androgens in epithelial and stromal cells.', 'Estrogen alleviates post-traumatic osteoarthritis progression and decreases p-EGFR levels in female mouse cartilage.', 'How Protein Methylation Regulates Steroid Receptor Function.', 'Tamoxifen-Induced Apoptosis of MCF-7 Cells via GPR30/PI3K/MAPKs Interactions: Verification by ODE Modeling and RNA Sequencing.', 'Bisphenol A induces cell cycle arrest in primary and prostate cancer cells through EGFR/ERK/p53 signaling pathway activation.', '1,4-Substituted Triazoles as Nonsteroidal Anti-Androgens for Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

Materials and methods:   From February 2007 to September 2008, 530 men undergoing extended needle biopsies were divided in two groups; those receiving aspirin and those not receiving aspirin. The morbidity of the procedure, with emphasis on hemorrhagic complications, was assessed prospectively using two standardized questionnaires.  Results:   There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the mean number of biopsy cores (12.9 +/- 1.6 vs. 13.1 +/- 1.2 cores, p = 0.09). No major biopsy-related complications were noted. Statistical analysis did not demonstrate significant differences in the rate of hematuria (64.5% vs. 60.6%, p = 0.46), rectal bleeding (33.6% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.09) or hemospermia (90.1% vs. 86.9%, p = 0.45).

Usually, the geometrical uncertainty is incorporated in the dose optimization process for inverse treatment planning to determine the additional intensity modulation of the beam to counter the geometrical uncertainty. Most of these approaches rely on dose convolution which is subject to the error caused by patient surface curvature and internal inhomogeneity. In this work, based on an 1D deconvolution algorithm developed by Ulmer and Kaissl, a fluence-deconvolution approach was developed to obtain robust fluence through the deconvolution of the nominal static one given by any treatment planning system. It incorporates the geometrical uncertainty outside the dose optimization procedure and therefore avoids the error of dose convolution. Robust fluences were calculated for a 4 x 4 cm flat field, a prostate IMRT and a head and neck IMRT plan in a commercial treatment planning system.

This note describes the use of an existing treatment planning system (Philips Pinnacle(3) v.8.0), supplemented by in-house software, to produce a single-arc VMAT prostate plan. While a number of planning systems for the Elekta VMAT platform are commercially available, the use of an in-house solution has allowed more detailed investigations of VMAT planning, as well as greater control over the optimization process. The solution presented here begins with a static step-and-shoot IMRT approach to provide initial segment shapes, which are then modified and sequenced into 60 equally spaced control points in a 360 degrees arc. Dose-volume histogram comparisons demonstrate that this VMAT planning method offers multiple dose level target coverage comparable to that from a standard IMRT approach. The VMAT plans also show superior sparing of critical structures such as the rectum and bladder. Delivery times are reduced with the VMAT method, and the results of dosimetric verification, resilience and repeatability tests indicate that the solution is robust.""","""['C J Boylan', 'C Golby', 'C G Rowbottom']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Comparison of anatomy-based, fluence-based and aperture-based treatment planning approaches for VMAT.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy: planning and evaluation for prostate cancer cases.', 'Single Arc Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy of head and neck cancer.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", ""Clinician's guide to prostate IMRT plan assessment and optimisation."", 'A comparison of a moderately hypofractionated IMRT planning technique used in a randomised UK external beam radiotherapy trial with an in-house technique for localised prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of hybrid volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique and double arc VMAT technique in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Planning for mARC treatments with the Eclipse treatment planning system.', 'Delivery parameter variations and early clinical outcomes of volumetric modulated arc therapy for 31 prostate cancer patients: an intercomparison of three treatment planning systems.', 'A comprehensive comparison of IMRT and VMAT plan quality for prostate cancer treatment.']"""

The data covers the years 1974 to 2007.  Aim of this study:   was to estimate the magnitude of the cancer problem in Kuwait over the period 1974-2007.  Materials and methods:   Age-adjusted incidence rates (ASR) with standard error (er) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of age-standardized rates were estimated. Statistical significance was assessed by examining the standardized rate ratio (SRR).  Results:   It was noted that by following the Cancer registry data there was a trend of increase in adjusted rates among both males and females. Looking into specific cancers it was noticed that comparing the ASR of colorectal cancer among Kuwaiti males, it increased by about 5 folds over the last 33 years and ranked the 1st most frequent site on the years 2003-2007. Prostate cancer incidence increased by 3 folds (14.5 cases /100,000 populations) and ranked the 4th most frequent site among Kuwaiti males. The incidence of Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and leukemia had increased by 1.5 to 2 folds over the same time period. The rise of lung cancer incidence declined to similar rates compared to that observed in the early 70s and 80s. For Kuwaiti females breast cancer had the highest incidence among Kuwaiti population (15 cases /100,000 populations), it increased by 3 folds (50 cases /100,000 populations) over the last 33 years. The incidence of colorectal cancer increased by about 4 folds; (13 cases /100,000 populations). NHL and leukemia increased by 2-2.5 folds over the same studied duration. Meanwhile Thyroid cancer increased by one fold.  Conclusion and recommendations:   Some of the differences in cancer rates over the last 33 years are likely to be attributable to the variation in exposure to specific etiologic factors that are caused by differences in lifestyle and habits, such as dietary, physical activity and obesity. Further research with a view to understanding these changes in cancer incidence is warranted.

Untreated HCT116 cells showed low levels of glut-p53, which increased markedly after H(2)O(2), diamide, cisplatin, and doxorubicin treatments. Glut-p53 levels decreased sharply after cells were passed into oxidant-free medium, suggesting efficient dethiolation. The mutant p53 present in HT29 and T47D human cancer cells was also recognized. In vitro, the glut-p53 was rapidly degraded by rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Human prostate and prostate cancer tissues showed an abundant presence of glut-p53 in luminal epithelium, a site well known to generate ROS.

In the present study, 95% ethanolic extract of roots and its fractions (n-hexane, chloroform, n-butanol and aqueous) were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines of colon, ovary, prostate, lung, CNS and leukemia. The n-hexane fraction containing alantolactone and isoalantolactone as its major constituents was further studied for its mode of action in HL-60 cells.

In this study, we investigated the effect of DADS on the correlation between tightening of tight junctions (TJs) and anti-invasive activity in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. Inhibitory effects of DADS on cell motility and invasiveness were found to be associated with increased tightness of the TJ, which was demonstrated by an increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Additionally, immunoblotting results indicated that DADS repressed the levels of the claudin proteins, which are major components of TJs that play a key role in control and selectivity of paracellular transport. Furthermore, the activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 in LNCaP cells were dose-dependently inhibited by treatment with DADS, and this was also correlated with a decrease in expression of their mRNA and proteins.

Therefore, anti-androgens that repress AR activity remain a critical mainstay for prostate cancer therapy. However, molecular mechanisms by which anti-androgens exert their therapeutic effects are not clearly elucidated and hence are a major area of scientific pursuit. Here, we demonstrate that another member of NRs, pregnane and xenobiotic receptor (PXR), not only acts as a molecular sensor of anti-androgens but also influences the outcome of therapeutic regimen with anti-androgenic drugs via a novel AR-PXR cross-talk. Using 'gain- and loss-of-function' studies, we identified a distinct role of PXR as a potent repressor of AR-regulated transcription. Our study implicates PXR as a key determinant of anti-androgen action since down-regulation of PXR diminishes the potency of the anti-androgenic drugs and enhances transcriptional actions of androgens. In addition, our subcellular localization studies revealed that ligand-activated AR induces nuclear localization of PXR and the two receptors colocalize at discrete sites in nucleus and mitotic chromatin. Finally, we report a distinct antagonist-induced interaction between AR and PXR defining a hitherto unidentified mode of action of AR antagonist.

We observed a rapid inhibition of DNA synthesis in S-phase cells in PGG-exposed cancer cells and in PGG-treated isolated nuclei. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that PGG inhibits DNA replicative synthesis through a direct inhibition of one or more DNA polymerases (pols). Using purified pols, we show that PGG exhibited a selective inhibition against the activities of B-family replicative pols (alpha, delta and epsilon) and Y-family (eta, iota and kappa) of bypass synthesis pols, and the inhibitory effect of PGG on pol alpha was the strongest with IC(50) value of 13 nM. PGG also inhibited pol beta, but the potency was an order of magnitude less than against pol alpha. PGG inhibition of pol alpha and kappa activity was non-competitive with respect to the DNA template-primer and the dNTP substrate; whereas it inhibited pol beta competitively. Docking simulation on pol beta, which is the only mammalian pol with solved crystal structure, suggests several favorable interactions with the catalytic pocket/binding site for the incoming dNTP.

Objective:   To evaluate whether GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 contribute to prostate cancer (CaP) etiology, we studied 110 incident CaP cases and 122 controls.  Results:   The probability of having CaP was increased in men who had homozygous deleted (non-functional) genotypes at GSTT1 (OR=2.17; 95% CI=1-3.79) but not GSTM1 (OR=0.89; 95% CI=0.66-1.88).

Methods:   Using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, the expression and distribution in the prostate of cAKIalpha, cAKIbeta, cAKIIalpha, and cAKIIbeta in relation to alpha-actin and the phosphodiesterase PDE4 (types A and B) were investigated. The effects of the cAK inhibitor Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS on the reversion of the adrenergic tension of isolated prostate tissue induced by forskolin, rolipram, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and tadalafil were examined by means of the organ bath technique.  Results:   Immunosignals specific for cAKIalpha, cAKIIalpha, and cAKIIbeta were observed in the smooth musculature and glandular structures of the prostate. Double stainings revealed the colocalization of alpha-actin and PDE4 with the cAK isoforms. The expression of the cAK isoforms was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The relaxation of the tension induced by norepinephrine brought about by forskolin, rolipram, SNP, and tadalafil was significantly attenuated by Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS.  Conclusions:   The colocalization of smooth muscle alpha-actin and PDE4 with cAK, as well as the results from the organ bath experiments, provide further evidence for a pivotal role of the cAMP-dependent signaling in the regulation of prostate smooth muscle contractility.

Related to this, novel targets for adjuvant therapies are also lacking. Here, we evaluate the association of B7-H3 expression in primary PCa tumors and BCR after SRT.  Methods and materials:   We identified 148 patients who received SRT between July 1987 and July 2003. Expression of B7-H3 in primary PCa tumors was detected using a monoclonal antibody. The staining levels were quantified via visual assessment and categorized as weak, moderate, or marked. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between B7-H3 staining and BCR.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 6.2 years (minimum, 0.6; maximum, 14.7), 78 patients (53%) experienced BCR. In single-variable analysis, there was evidence of an increased risk of BCR for patients with moderate (RR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.24-4.09, p = 0.008) and marked (RR, 4.40, 95% CI, 2.29-8.43, p < 0.001) B7-H3 staining compared with weak staining. This evidence remained, albeit weaker, after adjustment for additional clinicopathologic covariates (RR, 1.82, p = 0.068 [moderate vs. weak]; RR, 2.87, p = 0.003 [marked vs. weak]).

PhIP has been shown to induce tumours in the colon, prostate and mammary glands of rats and is regarded as a potential human dietary carcinogen. PhIP is metabolically activated via cytochrome P450 mediated oxidation to an N-hydroxylamino-PhIP intermediate that is subsequently converted to an ester by N-acetyltransferases or sulfotransferases and undergoes heterolytic cleavage to produce a PhIP-nitrenium ion, which reacts with DNA to form the N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP-C8-dG) adduct. Thus far, the detection and quantification of PhIP-DNA adducts has relied to a large extent on (32)P-postlabelling methodologies. In order to expand the array of available techniques for the detection and improved quantification of PhIP-C8-dG adducts in DNA we have developed an online column-switching liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method incorporating an isotopically [(13)C(10)]-labelled PhIP-C8-dG internal standard for the analysis of DNA enzymatically hydrolysed to 2'-deoxynucleosides. A dose-dependent increase was observed for PhIP-C8-dG adducts when salmon testis DNA was reacted with N-acetoxy-PhIP. Analysis of DNA samples isolated from colon tissue of mice treated by oral gavage daily for 5 days with 50 mg/kg body weight of PhIP resulted in the detection of an average level of 14.8+/-3.7 PhIP-C8-dG adducts per 10(6) 2'-deoxynucleosides. The method required 50 microg of hydrolysed animal DNA on column and the limit of detection for PhIP-C8-dG was 2.5 fmol (1.5 PhIP-C8-dG adducts per 10(8) 2'-deoxynucleosides). In summary, the LC-ESI-MS/MS SRM method provides for the rapid automation of the sample clean up and a reduction in matrix components that would otherwise interfere with the mass spectrometric analysis, with sufficient sensitivity and precision to analyse DNA adducts in animals exposed to PhIP.""","""['Rajinder Singh', 'Volker M Arlt', 'Colin J Henderson', 'David H Phillips', 'Peter B Farmer', 'Gonçalo Gamboa da Costa']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci""","""[""Novel LC-ESI/MS/MS(n) method for the characterization and quantification of 2'-deoxyguanosine adducts of the dietary carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine by 2-D linear quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry."", 'Biomonitoring DNA Adducts of Cooked Meat Carcinogens in Human Prostate by Nano Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Tandem Mass Spectrometry: Identification of 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine DNA Adduct.', 'Quantification of 3-nitrobenzanthrone-DNA adducts using online column-switching HPLC-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.', 'The Cooked Meat Carcinogen 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine Hair Dosimeter, DNA Adductomics Discovery, and Associations with Prostate Cancer Pathology Biomarkers.', 'Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry: the future of DNA adduct detection.', 'Chemical Analysis of DNA Damage.', 'Metabolic activation of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo 4,5-bpyridine and DNA adduct formation depends on p53: Studies in Trp53(+/+),Trp53(+/-) and Trp53(-/-) mice.', 'Mass spectrometry for the assessment of the occurrence and biological consequences of DNA adducts.', 'Synergistic and Antagonistic Mutation Responses of Human MCL-5 Cells to Mixtures of Benzoapyrene and 2-Amino-1-Methyl-6-Phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine: Dose-Related Variation in the Joint Effects of Common Dietary Carcinogens.', 'Simultaneous detection of multiple DNA adducts in human lung samples by isotope-dilution UPLC-MS/MS.']"""

One strategy to decrease the risk of death from this disease is screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA); however, the extent of benefit and harm with such screening is under continuous debate.  Methods:   In December, 1994, 20,000 men born between 1930 and 1944, randomly sampled from the population register, were randomised by computer in a 1:1 ratio to either a screening group invited for PSA testing every 2 years (n=10,000) or to a control group not invited (n=10,000). Men in the screening group were invited up to the upper age limit (median 69, range 67-71 years) and only men with raised PSA concentrations were offered additional tests such as digital rectal examination and prostate biopsies. The primary endpoint was prostate-cancer specific mortality, analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle. The study is ongoing, with men who have not reached the upper age limit invited for PSA testing. This is the first planned report on cumulative prostate-cancer incidence and mortality calculated up to Dec 31, 2008. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial ISRCTN54449243.  Findings:   In each group, 48 men were excluded from the analysis because of death or emigration before the randomisation date, or prevalent prostate cancer. In men randomised to screening, 7578 (76%) of 9952 attended at least once. During a median follow-up of 14 years, 1138 men in the screening group and 718 in the control group were diagnosed with prostate cancer, resulting in a cumulative prostate-cancer incidence of 12.7% in the screening group and 8.2% in the control group (hazard ratio 1.64; 95% CI 1.50-1.80; p<0.0001). The absolute cumulative risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 14 years was 0.40% (95% CI 0.17-0.64), from 0.90% in the control group to 0.50% in the screening group. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 (95% CI 0.39-0.82; p=0.002) in the screening compared with the control group. The rate ratio of death from prostate cancer for attendees compared with the control group was 0.44 (95% CI 0.28-0.68; p=0.0002). Overall, 293 (95% CI 177-799) men needed to be invited for screening and 12 to be diagnosed to prevent one prostate cancer death.  Interpretation:   This study shows that prostate cancer mortality was reduced almost by half over 14 years. However, the risk of over-diagnosis is substantial and the number needed to treat is at least as high as in breast-cancer screening programmes. The benefit of prostate-cancer screening compares favourably to other cancer screening programs.

It is composed of many sub-units with complex regulatory mechanisms implying cytokines and growth factors, dispersed throughout the skeleton, each acting with a semi-autonomy but are unified into an integrated system that responds to ionizing radiations as one critical organ. A better knowledge of the complexity of this tissue's distribution and physiology is fundamental to understanding and forecasting the consequences of radiation-induced bone marrow injury. According to cancer characteristics, the volume of hematopoietic bone marrow included within radiation fields and the dose it receives vary in a very significant way, and finally the impact on blood cell count varies in widely different ranges. Furthermore, to predict the overall risk of therapy-induced hematological toxicities, it is necessary to take into account the possible contemporary administration of other cytotoxic drugs (before and/or during radiation therapy). Conversely, the hematological toxicity of usually well-tolerated chemotherapies can be increased, if the patient has a history of radiotherapy. Although the importance of minimizing the volume of active bone marrow exposed to ionizing radiations is well established, so far, no consensual recommendation exists about the dose-volume relationship between bone marrow irradiation and hematological tolerance.

In multivariable analysis, biochemical recurrence was significantly associated with residual cancer: hazard ratio 2.69 (1.45-4.99), p = 0.002, and endocrine therapy alone hazard ratio 3.45 (1.80-6.62), p < 0.0001.  Conclusions:   Radiotherapy combined with hormones improved local tumor control in comparison with endocrine therapy alone. Residual prostate cancer was significantly associated with serum prostate-specific antigen recurrence, local tumor progression, clinical recurrence, and cancer-specific death in univariable analysis.

Objective:   Our aim was to evaluate tolerance and oncologic control with salvage radiotherapy (SRT) after HIFU failure and to identify predictive factors of success.  Design, setting, and participants:   From March 1995 to March 2008, all patients who presented with histologically proven persistent local disease following HIFU and were treated with curative intent SRT (with or without hormonal treatment) were included in this single-centre retrospective study.  Intervention:   Patients underwent conformal radiotherapy. The median dose of conformal treatment was 72 Gy (65-78 Gy).  Measurements:   The primary outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) defined as no biochemical relapse (three consecutive rises in prostate-specific antigen [PSA] with a velocity >0.4 ng/ml per year or PSA >1.5 ng/ml) and no additional treatment. Predictive factors of failure were examined in univariate and multivariate analyses. Adverse events in terms of urinary and digestive toxicity, urine incontinence, and erectile dysfunction (ED) were reported.  Results and limitations:   The median (range) and mean (standard deviation) follow-up of the 100 patients analysed was 33 mo (5-164 mo) and 37.2 mo (23.6 mo), respectively. Eighty-three patients received SRT alone, and 17 received SRT and androgen-deprivation therapy. For the 83 patients treated with exclusive radiation therapy, PFS was 72.5% at 5 yr and 93%, 67%, and 55% for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. In the univariate analysis, PSA level prior to SRT, risk status, PSA nadir after SRT, PSA nadir after SRT >0.2 ng/ml, and time to achieve this nadir were all predictive of failure. In the multivariate analysis, PSA nadir post-SRT with a threshold at 0.2 ng/ml and time to achieve this nadir were the significant predictive factors of failure. Gastrointestinal toxicity was low; urinary toxicity grade < or =2 was 34.5%. Four were grade 3 (4.7%), one was grade 4 (1.2%), and one was grade 5 (1.2%). The incidence of severe ED (International Index of Erectile Dysfunction-5 score 5-10) was 14% pre-HIFU, and 51.9% and 82.3% pre- and post-SRT, respectively. Because our study was retrospective, results have to be interpreted cautiously.  Conclusions:   SRT provides satisfactory oncologic control after HIFU failure with little (or mild) additional toxicity.

Although serum PSA testing is widely used for early detection, more specific prognostic tests are needed to guide treatment decisions. Recently, the enumeration of circulating prostate epithelial cells has been shown to correlate with disease recurrence and metastasis following definitive treatment. The purpose of our study was to investigate an immunomagnetic fractionation procedure to enrich circulating prostate tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood specimens, and to apply amplified molecular assays for the detection of prostate-specific markers (PSA, PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion mRNAs).  Results:   As few as five prostate cancer cells were detected per 5 mL of whole blood in model system experiments using anti-EpCAM magnetic particles alone or in combination with anti-PSMA magnetic particles. In our experiments, anti-EpCAM magnetic particles alone exhibited equivalent or better analytical performance with patient samples compared to a combination of anti-EpCAM + anti-PSMA magnetic particles. Up to 39% of men with advanced prostate cancer tested positive with one or more of the molecular assays tested, whereas control samples from men with benign prostate hyperplasia gave consistently negative results as expected. Interestingly, for the vast majority of men who tested positive for PSA mRNA following CTC enrichment, their matched plasma samples also tested positive, although CTC enrichment gave higher overall mRNA copy numbers.  Conclusion:   CTCs were successfully enriched and detected in men with advanced prostate cancer using an immunomagnetic enrichment procedure coupled with amplified molecular assays for PSA, PCA3, and TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion mRNAs. Our results indicate that men who test positive following CTC enrichment also exhibit higher detectable levels of non-cellular, circulating prostate-specific mRNAs.""","""['Matthias Jost', 'John R Day', 'Ryan Slaughter', 'Theodore D Koreckij', 'Deanna Gonzales', 'Martin Kinnunen', 'Jack Groskopf', 'Harry G Rittenhouse', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Mark A Reynolds']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'A pilot study of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) dynamics in men undergoing treatment for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Multigene model for predicting metastatic prostate cancer using circulating tumor cells by microfluidic magnetophoresis.', 'Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for prostate specific antigen in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Specific Antigen as a Tumor Marker in Prostate Cancer: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'Isolation and characterization of circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer.', 'Nanoresonator chip-based RNA sensor strategy for detection of circulating tumor cells: response using PCA3 as a prostate cancer marker.']"""

Using high-throughput technologies to analyze genetic fingerprints of ovarian cancer, we have discovered extremely high expression of the genes encoding the proteins claudin-3 and claudin-4.  Methods:   Because claudin-3 and -4 are the epithelial receptors for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), and are sufficient to mediate CPE binding, in this study we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo bioactivity of the carboxy-terminal fragment of CPE (i.e., CPE290-319 binding peptide) as a carrier for tumor imaging agents and intracellular delivery of therapeutic drugs. Claudin-3 and -4 expression was examined with rt-PCR and flow cytometry in multiple primary ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Cell binding assays were used to assess the accuracy and specificity of the CPE peptide in vitro against primary chemotherapy-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Confocal microscopy and biodistribution assays were performed to evaluate the localization and uptake of the FITC-conjugated CPE peptide in established tumor tissue.  Results:   Using a FITC-conjugated CPE peptide we show specific in vitro and in vivo binding to multiple primary chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Bio-distribution studies in SCID mice harboring clinically relevant animal models of chemotherapy resistant ovarian carcinoma showed higher uptake of the peptide in tumor cells than in normal organs. Imunofluorescence was detectable within discrete accumulations (i.e., tumor spheroids) or even single chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer cells floating in the ascites of xenografted animals while a time-dependent internalization of the FITC-conjugated CPE peptide was consistently noted in chemotherapy-resistant ovarian tumor cells by confocal microscopy.

However, IMRT for prostate patients is not yet standard in many Australian radiation oncology centres. This study investigates dosimetric changes that can be observed between IMRT and 3DCRT in prostate radiotherapy. Fifteen patients were selected for analysis. Two target definitions were investigated--prostate-only and prostate plus seminal vesicles (p + SVs). A five-field 3DCRT and seven-field IMRT plan were created for each patient and target definition. The planning target volume coverage was matched for both plans. Doses to the rectum, bladder and femoral heads were compared using dose volume histograms. The rectal normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) were calculated and compared for the 3DCRT and IMRT plans. The delivery efficiency was investigated. The IMRT plans resulted in reductions in the V25, V50, V60, V70 and V75 Gy values for both the prostate-only and p + SVs targets. Rectal NTCP was reduced with IMRT for three different sets of model parameters. The reductions in rectal dose and NTCP were much larger for the p + SVs target. Delivery of IMRT plans was less efficient than for 3DCRT plans. IMRT resulted in superior plans based on dosimetric and biological endpoints. The dosimetric gains with IMRT were greater for the more complex p + SVs target.

Sixty-six patients who had developed ED following radiation treatment agreed to participate and were allocated to sildenafil or placebo to be taken prior to four sexual attempts. In the crossover period, subjects received the alternative tablet for a further four attempts. Allocation was centrally randomized, and researchers and patients were both blinded to the trial arm. Efficacy was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire and with a separate global efficacy question. Forty-three subjects completed the study. There was a significant increase in mean scores from baseline for all domains of the IIEF with sildenafil compared with placebo (P < 0.001). Affirmative response to the global efficacy question was more common after taking sildenafil compared with placebo. In approximately half of the patients, the improvement in the erectile function domain score corresponded to a moderate improvement in ED (e.g. success 'sometimes' to 'most times'). Sildenafil was associated with mild flushing, nasal stuffiness or indigestion in 8-10% patients and moderate flushing in 10%.

Conventional therapies for prostate cancer are believed to mainly target the majority of differentiated tumor cells but spare CSCs, which may account for the subsequent disease relapse after treatment. Therefore, successful elimination of CSCs may be an effective strategy to achieve complete remission from this disease. Gamma-tocotrienols (γ-T3) is one of the vitamin-E constituents, which have been shown to have anticancer effects against a wide range of human cancers. Recently, we have reported that γ-T3 treatment not only inhibits prostate cancer cell invasion but also sensitizes the cells to docetaxel-induced apoptosis, suggesting that γ-T3 may be an effective therapeutic agent against advanced stage prostate cancer. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that γ-T3 can downregulate the expression of prostate CSC markers (CD133/CD44) in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU145), as evident from Western blotting analysis. Meanwhile, the spheroid formation ability of the prostate cancer cells was significantly hampered by γ-T3 treatment. In addition, pretreatment of PC-3 cells with γ-T3 was found to suppress tumor initiation ability of the cells. More importantly, although CD133-enriched PC-3 cells were highly resistant to docetaxel treatment, these cells were as sensitive to γ-T3 treatment as the CD133-depleted population.

Methods:   In ten patients with a proven local recurrence after initial local treatment (four external beam radiation, four brachytherapy and two high-intensity focused ultrasound), the radiotracer ((99m)Tc-nanocolloid, GE Healthcare) was injected into the prostate. Planar images after 15 min and 2 h were followed by SPECT/CT (Symbia T, Siemens) to visualize lymphatic drainage. Laparoscopic sentinel lymphadenectomy was assisted by a gamma probe (Europrobe, EuroMedical Instruments) and a portable gamma camera (Sentinella, S102, Oncovision). Sentinel node identification and lymphatic drainage patterns were compared to a consecutive series of 70 untreated prostate carcinoma patients from our institute.  Results:   Lymphatic drainage was visualized in all treated patients, with a median of 3.5 sentinel nodes per patient. Most sentinel nodes were localized in the pelvic area, although the percentage of patients with a sentinel node outside the pelvic para-iliac region (para-aortic, presacral, inguinal or near the ventral abdominal wall) was high compared to the untreated patients (80 versus 34%, p = 0.01). In patients with recurrent prostate cancer, 95% of the sentinel nodes could be harvested and half of the patients had at least one positive sentinel node on pathological examination.

Objective:   Our purpose was to examine the daily covariation of negative and positive affect among husbands and wives and whether this covariation was enhanced when couples mentioned the same stressful event and reported frequently collaborating.  Methods:   Fifty-nine husbands diagnosed as having prostate cancer and their wives participated in a daily diary where they reported on the most stressful event of the day, positive and negative affect, coping strategies and whether their spouse was involved in a collaborative manner. Coders independently made judgments as to whether the stressful event mentioned by husbands and wives was the same.  Results:   Multivariate hierarchical linear models revealed that on days when wives experienced greater negative affect, husbands did so as well. However, negative affect covariation was only found when spouses mentioned the same daily stressful event. The mean levels of collaborative coping across the 14 days moderated this negative covariation effect for wives, such that negative affect covariation was enhanced when wives reported collaborating more frequently. Positive affect covariation was not found.  Conclusion:   The results reveal that negative affect covariation may be most likely when spouses experience similar stressors and wives perceive frequently collaborating.

Patients and methods:   128 of 135 consecutive patients diagnosed with prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy. Simultaneous pretreatment serum samples were obtained to measure serum total testosterone, FT and total PSA levels. The statistical design of the study included 2 sections: the first part trying to explore the role of the PSA/FT ratio in clustering patients with different pathologic prognostic factors, and the second to investigate the PSA/FT ratio distribution in different groups of patients according to the pathologic stage and pGS of the specimen after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   The average age was 65.80 (range 51.21-77.26) years, mean PSA was 8.88 (range 1.22-44.27) μg/l, mean FT was 35.32 (range 13.70-69.30) pmol/l, and the mean PSA/FT ratio was 0.27 (range 0.04-1.48). The PSA/FT ratio significantly clustered both the pT and pGS groups. Analysis of variance for the distribution of the PSA/FT ratio was significant for the pT model groups. The mean PSA/FT ratio increased as the tumor extended and grew through the prostate gland (high-stage disease). Analysis of variance for the different distributions of the PSA/FT ratio was significant for all model pGS groups. In our investigation we also found (data not shown) that a PSA/FT ratio of ≥0.40 was strongly correlated with large extensive (pT3b+pT4) and high-grade cancers (pGS8+pGS9).  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer patients may be classified into 3 different pathologic prognostic groups according to the PSA/FT ratio: low risk (PSA/FT ≤0.20), intermediate risk (PSA/FT >0.20 and ≤0.40), and high risk (PSA/FT >0.40 and ≤1.5).

By analyzing mast cells in different tissue compartments, our data indicate that intratumoral and peritumoral mast cells have anti- opposed to protumor properties. Intratumoral mast cells negatively regulate angiogenesis and tumor growth, whereas peritumoral mast cells stimulate the expansion of human prostate tumors. We also observed mast cell recruitment particularly to the peritumoral compartment in men during the formation of castrate-resistant prostate tumors. In our ortothopic rat model, mast cells accumulated in the peritumoral tissue where they enhanced angiogenesis and tumor growth. In line with this, prostate mast cells expressed high levels of the angiogenic factor FGF-2. Similar to the situation in men, mast cells infiltrated rat prostate tumors that relapsed after initially effective castration treatment, concurrent with a second wave of angiogenesis and an up-regulation of FGF-2. We conclude that mast cells are novel independent prognostic markers in PC and affect tumor progression in animals and patients.

However, managing intrafraction motion is challenging for IMAT. The purpose of this research was to develop and investigate electromagnetically guided dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) tracking as an enabling technology to treat moving targets during IMAT.  Methods and materials:   A real-time three-dimensional DMLC-based target tracking system was developed and integrated with a linear accelerator. The DMLC tracking software inputs a real-time electromagnetically measured target position and the IMAT plan, and dynamically creates new leaf positions directed at the moving target. Low- and high-modulation IMAT plans were created for lung and prostate cancer cases. The IMAT plans were delivered to a three-axis motion platform programmed with measured patient motion. Dosimetric measurements were acquired by placing an ion chamber array on the moving platform. Measurements were acquired with tracking, without tracking (current clinical practice), and with the phantom in a static position (reference). Analysis of dose distribution differences from the static reference used a γ-test.  Results:   On average, 1.6% of dose points for the lung plans and 1.2% of points for the prostate plans failed the 3-mm/3% γ-test with tracking; without tracking, 34% and 14% (respectively) of points failed the γ-test. The delivery time was the same with and without tracking.  Conclusions:   Electromagnetic-guided DMLC target tracking with IMAT has been investigated for the first time.

This study measured the static and dynamic accuracy of the new tracking technology in a clinical radiation therapy environment.  Methods and materials:   The tracking device was installed on the linac gantry. The radioactive marker was located in a tissue equivalent phantom. Marker location was measured simultaneously by the radioactive tracking system and by a Microscribe G2 coordinate measuring machine (certified spatial accuracy of 0.38 mm). Localization consistency throughout a volume and absolute accuracy in the Fixed coordinate system were measured at multiple gantry angles over volumes of at least 10 cm in diameter centered at isocenter. Dynamic accuracy was measured with the marker located inside a breathing phantom.  Results:   The mean consistency for the static source was 0.58 mm throughout the tested region at all measured gantry angles.

Starvation and growth factors activate AMPK through the DNA damage sensor ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). We explored the regulation of AMPK by ionizing radiation (IR) and its role as a target for radiosensitization of human cancer cells.  Methods and materials:   Lung, prostate, and breast cancer cells were treated with IR (2-8 Gy) after incubation with either ATM or AMPK inhibitors or the AMPK activator metformin. Then, cells were subjected to either lysis and immunoblotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, clonogenic survival assays, or cell cycle analysis.  Results:   IR induced a robust phosphorylation and activation of AMPK in all tumor cells, independent of LKB1. IR activated AMPK first in the nucleus, and this extended later into cytoplasm. The ATM inhibitor KU-55933 blocked IR activation of AMPK. AMPK inhibition with Compound C or anti-AMPK alpha subunit small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked IR induction of the cell cycle regulators p53 and p21(waf/cip) as well as the IR-induced G2/M arrest. Compound C caused resistance to IR, increasing the surviving fraction after 2 Gy, but the anti-diabetic drug metformin enhanced IR activation of AMPK and lowered the surviving fraction after 2 Gy further.  Conclusions:   We provide evidence that IR activates AMPK in human cancer cells in an LKB1-independent manner, leading to induction of p21(waf/cip) and regulation of the cell cycle and survival. AMPK appears to (1) participate in an ATM-AMPK-p21(waf/cip) pathway, (2) be involved in regulation of the IR-induced G2/M checkpoint, and (3) may be targeted by metformin to enhance IR responses.""","""['Toran Sanli', 'Ayesha Rashid', 'Caiqiong Liu', 'Shane Harding', 'Robert G Bristow', 'Jean-Claude Cutz', 'Gurmit Singh', 'James Wright', 'Theodoros Tsakiridis']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Metformin inhibits growth and enhances radiation response of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through ATM and AMPK.', 'Chk1 is dispensable for G2 arrest in response to sustained DNA damage when the ATM/p53/p21 pathway is functional.', 'RAC1 GTPase plays an important role in γ-irradiation induced G2/M checkpoint activation.', 'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) beyond metabolism: a novel genomic stress sensor participating in the DNA damage response pathway.', 'ATM-NF-kappaB connection as a target for tumor radiosensitization.', 'Metabolic targeting, immunotherapy and radiation in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Where do we go from here?', 'SLC2As as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in LUAD patients through bioinformatic analysis.', 'AMP-activated protein kinase - a journey from 1 to 100 downstream targets.', 'Research progress on the therapeutic effect and mechanism of metformin for lung cancer (Review).', 'Pharmacogenomics in Psychiatry Practice: The Value and the Challenges.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between January 2005 and December 2008, 714 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with iodine-125 prostate brachytherapy at our department. All patients completed four imaging studies: magnetic resonance imaging before and 4 weeks after treatment and intraoperative three-dimensional transrectal ultrasonography before and after implantation. The development of AUR was prospectively recorded. The evaluated treatment and dosimetric parameters included prostate volume, number of needles and seeds used, intra- and postoperative prostate edema, percentage of prostate volume receiving 100%, 150%, and 200% of the prescribed dose to the prostate, minimal dose received by 90% of the prostate volume, and percentage of the urethra receiving 100%, 150%, and 200% of the prescribed dose. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine which factors were associated with AUR.  Results:   Of the 714 patients, 57 (8.0%) developed AUR. On univariate analysis, the following treatment and dosimetric factors were significantly associated with AUR: International Prostate Symptom Score (odds ratio [OR], 2.07, per 10-point increase), preimplant prostate volume (OR, 1.06), postimplant prostate volume (OR, 1.04), number of needles used (OR, 1.09), and number of seeds used (OR, 1.03). On multivariate analysis, the only independent predictive factors for AUR were pretreatment prostate volume (OR, 1.05) and International Prostate Symptom Score (OR, 1.76, per 10-point increase). Patients with a pretreatment prostate volume >35 cm(3) had a 10.4% risk of developing AUR compared with 5.4% for those with a prostate volume of ≤ 35 cm(3).

Methods and materials:   Immunodeficient (SCID) mice with hormone-independent LAPC-4 (HI-LAPC-4) and PC-3 xenograft tumors (approximately 200 mm(3)) were divided into four groups: control (untreated), radiation therapy (XRT, local irradiation), SSE (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, 3 times/week), and XRT plus SSE. The XRT was given at the beginning of the regimen as a single dose of 5 Gy for HI-LAPC-4 tumors and a single dose of 7 Gy followed by a fractional dose of 3 Gy/d for 5 days for PC-3 tumors. The tumor volume was measured 3 times per week. The radiosensitizing effect of SSE on normal intestinal epithelial cells was assessed by use of a crypt cell microcolony assay.  Results:   In the efficacy study, SSE alone significantly inhibited the tumor growth in HI-LAPC-4 tumors but not PC-3 tumors. Sodium selenite significantly enhanced the XRT-induced tumor growth inhibition in both HI-LAPC-4 and PC-3 tumors. In the toxicity study, SSE did not affect the intestinal crypt cell survival either alone or in combination with XRT.

Complications assessment is essential to the objective evaluation of any new procedure. This study aimed to assess the perioperative complications encountered during the implementation of a robot-assisted urologic surgery program.  Methods:   A prospective data collection for all men with a diagnosis of CaP who underwent RALRP between 2005 and 2009 in our department was achieved. Together with perioperative data, all the perioperative complications encountered were specifically recorded, including robot dysfunctions. The RALRP was performed with the three-arm Da Vinci system using a transperitoneal approach with six ports. To assess the perioperative complications, the validated Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical procedures was used. Two surgeons were involved in these procedures. A modified Clavien-Dindo classification also was used to account for intraoperative complications.  Results:   According to the Clavien-Dindo classification, 16 complications (6.7% complication rate) were recorded during the first 240 procedures. Besides postoperative complications, five procedures (2.1%) were directly affected by robot malfunctions without notable consequences for the patients. Considering these five additional complications, an 8.8% complication rate was recorded using a modified Clavien-Dindo classification. The main limitation of the study was its design restricted to RALRP procedures alone. The second limitation was that the authors' modified classification needs to be validated with a larger series and for different surgical procedures.  Conclusions:   The findings show that RALRP is a safe alternative to classical surgery and that the robotic approach is reliable. The authors believe that the reliability of technological devices should be systematically discussed when outcome analysis of a new procedure is performed.""","""['Thierry Lebeau', 'Morgan Rouprêt', 'Karim Ferhi', 'Emmanuel Chartier-Kastler', 'François Richard', 'Marc-Olivier Bitker', 'Christophe Vaessen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Surg Endosc""","""['Quality of evidence to compare outcomes of open and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Operative details and oncological and functional outcome of robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: 400 cases with a minimum of 12 months follow-up.', 'Comparison of Perioperative and Pathologic Outcomes Between Single-port and Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: An Analysis of a High-volume Center and the Pooled World Experience.', 'Robot-assisted simple prostatectomy for treatment of large prostatic adenomas: surgical technique and outcomes from a high-volume robotic centre.', 'Perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes after open and minimally invasive prostate cancer surgery: experience from Australasia.', 'An evaluation of the timing of surgical complications following radical prostatectomy: Data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP).', 'Current evidence between hospital volume and perioperative outcome: Prospective assessment of robotic radical prostatectomy safety profile in a regional center of medium annual caseload.', 'Avoiding and managing vascular injury during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Multidetector CT imaging of post-robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy complications.', 'Gravity line strategy may reduce risks of intraoperative injury during laparoscopic surgery.']"""

We employed a novel fluorescent sensor for mobile zinc (ZPP1) to detect and monitor the development of prostate cancer in a transgenic mouse model of prostate adenocarcinoma, using in vivo optical imaging correlated with biological fluid-based methods. We showed that the progression of prostate cancer could be monitored in vivo judging by the decreasing zinc content in the prostates of tumor-bearing mice in an age-dependent manner. In a novel quantitative assay, we determined the concentration of mobile zinc in both prostate cell lysates and mouse prostate extracts through simple titration of the ZPP1 sensor. Our findings fulfill the promise of zinc-based prostate cancer diagnostics with the prospect for immediate clinical translation.""","""['Subrata K Ghosh', 'Pilhan Kim', 'Xiao-an Zhang', 'Seok-Hyun Yun', 'Anna Moore', 'Stephen J Lippard', 'Zdravka Medarova']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Re.: A novel imaging approach for early detection of prostate cancer based on endogenous zinc sensing.', 'A novel fluorescent probe for the early detection of prostate cancer based on endogenous zinc sensing.', 'Risk stratification of prostate cancer patients based on EPS-urine zinc content.', 'Synchrotron Radiation X-ray Fluorescence Elemental Mapping in Healthy versus Malignant Prostate Tissues Provides New Insights into the Glucose-Stimulated Zinc Trafficking in the Prostate As Discovered by MRI.', 'Prostatic fluid electrolyte composition for the screening of prostate cancer: a potential solution to a major problem.', 'Imaging mobile zinc in biology.', 'Mobile zinc as a modulator of sensory perception.', 'Quantum chemical elucidation of the turn-on luminescence mechanism in two new Schiff bases as selective chemosensors of Zn2+: synthesis, theory and bioimaging applications.', 'Novel Insights into Aspergillus fumigatus Pathogenesis and Host Response from State-of-the-Art Imaging of Host-Pathogen Interactions during Infection.', 'Fast Ion-Chelate Dissociation Rate for In Vivo MRI of Labile Zinc with Frequency-Specific Encodability.', 'Hyperpolarized 15N-labeled, deuterated tris (2-pyridylmethyl)amine as an MRI sensor of freely available Zn2.']"""

Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3% per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5% per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0% between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80% of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3%, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.""","""['Ahmedin Jemal', 'Rebecca Siegel', 'Jiaquan Xu', 'Elizabeth Ward']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""CA Cancer J Clin""","""['Cancer statistics, 2009.', 'Cancer statistics, 2012.', 'Cancer statistics, 2007.', 'Cancer statistics, 2004.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'New Pathway for Cisplatin Prodrug to Utilize Metabolic Substrate Preference to Overcome Cancer Intrinsic Resistance.', 'Use of neuromuscular blockade for neck dissection and association with iatrogenic nerve injury.', 'The Risk of Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke in Head and Neck Cancer: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.', 'The Coagulopathy of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia: An Updated Review of Pathophysiology, Risk Stratification, and Clinical Management.', 'The role of heavy metals in the development of colorectal cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Image guidance options from two linear accelerators were compared in terms of identifying the center of gravity (COG) of FMs from the isocenter: a Siemens Primatom, where the couch is rotated 180 degrees from the treatment isocenter to the in-room CT vs. electronic portal imaging (EPI); and a Varian OBI system, where kV CBCT, EPI, and planar kV radiographs were compared. In all, 387 image pairs (CBCT = 133; CT = 254) from 18 patients were analyzed. A clinical tolerance of 3 mm was predefined as the acceptable threshold for agreement.  Results:   COG location on in-room CT and EPI was in agreement 96.9%, 85.8%, and 89.0% of the time in the left-right (LR), superior-inferior (SI), and anterior-posterior (AP) directions, respectively, vs. 99.2%, 91.7%, and 93.2% for the CBCT and EPI analysis.

In the present study, we investigated the implication of BMP-10 in breast cancer, particularly the relation of its expression with clinical aspects. The expression of BMP-10 was examined in a cohort of human breast cancer specimens (normal, n = 23; cancer, n = 97), using both quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining. The full-length human BMP-10 was cloned into a mammalian expression plasmid vector and then transfected into breast cancer cells. The effect on growth, cell matrix adhesion, motility, and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by BMP-10 was then investigated using in vitro growth assays. Immunohistochemical staining and quantitative real-time PCR revealed a decreased expression of BMP-10 in breast cancer. Further analysis of BMP-10 transcript level against the clinical aspect demonstrated that the decreased BMP-10 expression correlated with disease progression, bone metastasis, and poor prognosis. The disease-free survival of the patients with a higher level of BMP-10 was 132.8 (95% CI, 122.0-143.5) months, significantly longer compared to 93.7 (95% CI, 60.3-127.2) months for patients with a lower level of BMP-10 expression (P = 0.043). The overexpression of BMP-10 has broad inhibitory effects on the in vitro growth, invasion, and motility of breast cancer cells. Taken together, BMP-10 can inhibit the cell growth of breast cancer cells, and decreased BMP-10 expression correlates to poor prognosis and disease progression, particularly the lymphatic and bone metastasis.

We assessed the effect of several variables on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS).  Results:   The 2- and 5-year RFS rates for the entire cohort were 33.5% and 22.5%, respectively, and the 2- and 5-year CSS rates were 48.0% and 23.6%, respectively.

Material and methods:   From May 1999 to December 2006, 150 patients were treated by I-125 brachytherapy. The median follow-up was 60 months. All patients had clinical stage T1-T2, PSA < or =10 ng/ml, Gleason Scores < or = 3+3=6, IPSS >14 ml/sec. and prostate weight <50 gr. Implantation was ultrasound-guided, using a real-time technique and loose seeds of I-125 (dose 160 Gy). After 30 days, a post-implantation assessment was performed by pelvic CT scan for a definitive evaluation of the D90. All patients were subjected to clinical evaluation, PSA dosage and compilation of IPSS and IEFF questionnaires. In the event of biochemical failure (ASTRO), a prostate biopsy was performed. A D90 >144 Gy was considered the cut-off in order to predict the absence of biochemical failure.  Results:   Biochemical failure was observed in 9 patients: 5 with positive and 4 with negative prostate biopsies. The D90 >144 Gy cut-off was not achieved in 18 patients at the post-implantation assessment, however only 2 of them (one of whom had a positive biopsy) had biochemical failure (11.1%).

Methods:   The study involved 211 patients who underwent at least a second biopsy after a first negative prostate biopsy. PSA Slope, PSA velocity (PSAV) and PSA doubling time (PSADT) were estimated. Flu-PSA level was defined as a PSA series with at least one PSA value lower than the one immediately preceding it.  Results:   82 patients had flu-PSA levels and 129 si-PSA levels. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of cancer detection, clinical or pathological stage, but the si-PSA group with cancer had a higher Gleason score. No difference was found for PSA Slope between flu-PSA patients with cancer and those without.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrates no difference in PC detection rate at repeat biopsy between patients with flu or si-PSA levels. PSA Slope, PSAV and PSADT were not found helpful tools in cancer detection.""","""['Gianluigi Taverna', 'Fabio Grizzi', 'Francesco Minuti', 'Mauro Seveso', 'Alessandro Piccinelli', 'Guido Giusti', 'Alessio Benetti', 'Orazio Maugeri', 'Luisa Pasini', 'Silvia Zandegiacomo', 'Piergiuseppe Colombo', 'Sonia Di Biccari', 'Pierpaolo Graziotti']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""[]"""

Diagnostic accuracy of PSAD in diagnosing PCa (prostate cancer) was evaluated and compared with accuracy obtained using PSA free/total (FIT).  Material and methods:   102 consecutive patients with PSA included between 2 and 10 ng/mL underwent radical prostatectomy. Indications to perform prostate biopsy were: abnormal digital rectal examination, PSA < or = 2.5 ng/mL, PSA between 2.6 and 4 ng/mL and between 4.1 and 10 ng/mL with PSA F/T (free/total) < or = 15%, < or = 20% and < or = 25%, respectively We compared the PSAD values obtained using the actual prostate weight (PSAD1) vs those calculated using volume 1 (PSAD2) and volume 2 (PASD3).  Results:   The mean weight of prostate specimen was 55.61 grams, while the estimated mean volumes were 50.02 mL (volume 1) and 48.49 mL (volume 2). A statistically significant difference among actual weight vs volume 1 vs. volume 2 (p < 0.0001) was found.

CBF is a heterodimer composed of one of three DNA-binding RUNX proteins plus the non-DNA-binding protein, CBFβ. Recent studies have showed that the RUNX factors exhibit complex expression patterns in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers, and CBF has been implicated in the control of cancer-related genes. However, the biologic roles of CBF in solid tumors have not been fully elucidated. To test whether CBF is required for the malignant phenotype of various epithelial cancers, we used lentiviral delivery of CBFβ-specific shRNA to significantly decrease CBFβ expression in two prostate cancer cell lines (PPC1 and PC-3) and the SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line. We found that knockdown of CBFβ significantly inhibited anchorage independent growth of each cell line. Further, CBFβ knockdown in PPC1 cells suppressed xenograft tumor growth compared to controls. Mice injected with SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells knocked-down for CBFβ exhibited a survival time similar to control mice. However, human cells recovered from the ascites fluid of these mice showed CBFβ expression levels similar to those from mice injected with control SKOV-3 cells, suggesting that CBFβ knockdown is incompatible with tumor cell growth. Gene expression profiling of CBFβ knockdown cells revealed significant changes in expression in genes involved in various developmental and cell signaling pathways. These data collectively suggest that CBFβ is required for malignancy in some human cancers.""","""['J Nathan Davis', 'Donna Rogers', 'Lisa Adams', 'Thomas Yong', 'Jette S Jung', 'Bing Cheng', 'Katie Fennell', 'Erkut Borazanci', 'Yara W Moustafa', 'Amanda Sun', 'Runhua Shi', 'Jonathan Glass', 'J Michael Mathis', 'B Jill Williams', 'Shari Meyers']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['The RUNX/CBFβ Complex in Breast Cancer: A Conundrum of Context.', 'Knockdown of core binding factorβ alters sphingolipid metabolism.', 'Altered Ets transcription factor activity in prostate tumor cells inhibits anchorage-independent growth, survival, and invasiveness.', 'Inhibitory effect of silencing STAT3 gene with short hairpin RNA mediated by polyamidoamine dendrimers on growth of prostate cancer.', 'Structure and Biophysics of CBFβ/RUNX and Its Translocation Products.', 'The RUNX/CBFβ Complex in Breast Cancer: A Conundrum of Context.', 'Cancer-Associated Exosomal CBFB Facilitates the Aggressive Phenotype, Evasion of Oxidative Stress, and Preferential Predisposition to Bone Prometastatic Factor of Breast Cancer Progression.', 'CBFβ promotes colorectal cancer progression through transcriptionally activating OPN, FAM129A, and UPP1 in a RUNX2-dependent manner.', 'Transcriptional activation of CBFβ by CDK11p110 is necessary to promote osteosarcoma cell proliferation.', 'The interaction between RUNX2 and core binding factor beta as a potential therapeutic target in canine osteosarcoma.']"""

Livin has recently been described as a cancer-associated member of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins family, highly expressed in prostate cancer. Livin gene encodes two splicing variants, termed Livin-α and Livin-β. We hypothesized that deregulation of proliferation could be due in part to Livin expression.  Methods:   Pathological analysis of Livin was performed in 20 prostate cancer tissues and 5 benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. The expression of Livin isoforms was also investigated by Western blot in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC3. The role of Livin-α in vitro was further studied. Using Livin-α knockdown and overexpression models, cell cycle analysis, Ki-67 immunocytostaining, and MTT assay were performed respectively.  Results:   Livin expression positive ratio was shown to be 5.4%, 23.6%, 52.4%, 73.4% in benign prostatic hyperplasia, low, medium, and high grade of prostate cancer respectively, and Livin was positively correlated with clinical pathological grades of prostate cancer. Livin-α was expressed in both LNCaP and PC3; meanwhile; Livin-β was only detected in the PC3. Livin-α siRNA not only resulted in G(1)-S cell cycle arrest, but also strongly correlated with the descended proliferation index and survival rate in LNCaP. In comparison, overexpression of Livin-α resulted in an accelerated S phase entry combined with elevated proliferation index and survival in LNCaP.

Methods:   Imatinib and mitoxantrone were simultaneously co-loaded into DSPC/Chol liposomes by means of a (NH4)2SO4-generated proton gradient method. The optimized formulation was characterized in terms of mean size diameter, loading parameters and drug retention in human serum. In vivo antitumor activity of developed LIM formulation was evaluated in a nude mice bearing subcutaneous PC-3 xenograft model.  Results:   LIM formulation exhibited maximal encapsulation efficiency (>95%) and enhanced drug retention for both drugs. Additionally, this LIM formulation, administered at a low mitoxantrone dose (0.5 mg/kg), showed a tumor inhibition activity (TGI = 66.7% and 4.0-fold tumor volume increase) slightly superior to that of liposomal mitoxantrone (LM) at 2 mg/kg (TGI = 53.0% and 4.2-fold volume increase). Therefore, therapeutic activity of mitoxantrone was significantly improved by co-loading with imatinib since a four times lower dose was needed to achieve an equivalent growth inhibition effect.

Evidence also supports a broad role for the p53 gene in suppressing prostatic tumorigenesis. We investigated whether p53 regulates mACON expression and explore the potential mechanisms responsible for its effect on prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Camptothecin (CPT) treatments and transient overexpression of p53 were used to investigate p53 regulation of mACON and may effects were assessed using immunoblotting and transient gene expression assays.  Results:   In vitro enzymatic activity assays and immunoblot assays showed that CPT treatment induced p53 expression while reducing mACON protein biosynthesis in wild-type p53 expressing LNCaP cells. Immunoblot assays and reporter assays revealed that transient transfection of a p53 expression vector into p53-null PC-3 cells decreased mACON expression. Cyclic pifithrin-α, an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity, blocked the decrease in mACON gene expression resulting from CPT treatment in LNCaP cells. Two putative p53 response elements were identified within the mACON promoter; however, mutation of these putative p53 response elements did not abolish the effect of CPT whereby it decreased mACON expression. A similar result was obtained for the effect of these mutants on the promoter activity of the mACON gene after transient overexpression of p53.

The odds ratio for prostate cancer associated with titres at or above the median value was 0.73 (95% CI 0.58-0.91, P=0.005). The association appeared to be particularly strong for advanced prostate cancer (AJCC Stage grouping III-IV) for which the odds ratio was 0.59 (95% CI 0.43-0.81, P=0.001) but there was insufficient evidence that the association differed by tumour stage (p heterogeneity=0.07).

Methods:   Between 2007 and 2009 radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) was performed in 96 patients and permanent prostate brachytherapy (PPB) in 88 patients at our hospital. The general and disease-specific HRQOL was measured using two instruments, the Medical Outcome Study 8-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) and the expanded prostate index composite (EPIC).  Results:   Comparing RRP and PPB, there were significant differences in all scores except for general health in the 1st month after treatment which had the same score in both groups. The baseline quality of life scores in physical function (p < 0.05), physical role (p < 0.01), social functioning (p < 0.01), emotional role (p < 0.01) and mental health (p < 0.01) showed significant differences between the group and were better in the PPB group than in the RRP group. The physical component summary score in the PPB group was better than in the RRP group in the 1st month (p < 0.01) but recovered up to 3 months in the RRP group. The urinary bother and irritative/obstructive scores in the 1st month were worse from baseline in both groups (p < 0.05) and remained significantly worse up to 6 months in the PPB group than in the RRP group where these scores recovered within 3 months. The urinary incontinence score in the RRP group was still worse than in the PPB group up to 12 months (p < 0.01). Bowel function and bother were significantly better in the RRP group at 3 (p < 0.05) and 6 months (p < 0.01) than in the PPB group where bowel function at 12 months was worse than at baseline and in the RRP group. Sexual function (p < 0.01) and sexual bother were better in the PPB group and did not change until 12 months.

The long latency of prostate cancer development provides an opportunity to intervene with agents of known mechanisms at various stages of disease progression. A number of signaling cascades have been shown to play important roles in prostate cancer development and progression, including the androgen receptor (AR) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways. Crosstalk between these two pathways is also thought to contribute to progression and hormone-refractory prostate disease. Our initial investigations show that the naturally occurring organoselenium compound selenomethionine (SM) and the synthetic 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)selenocyanate (p-XSC) can inhibit human prostate cancer cell viability; however, in contrast to SM, p-XSC is active at physiologically relevant doses. In the current investigation, we show that p-XSC, but not an equivalent dose of SM, alters molecular targets and induces apoptosis in androgen-responsive LNCaP and androgen-independent LNCaP C4-2 human prostate cancer cells. p-XSC effectively inhibits AR expression and transcriptional activity in both cell lines. p-XSC also decreases Akt phosphorylation as well as Akt-specific phosphorylation of the AR. Inhibition of Akt, however, does not fully attenuate p-XSC-mediated downregulation of AR activity, suggesting that inhibition of AR signaling by p-XSC does not occur solely through alterations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt survival pathway. Our data suggest that p-XSC inhibits multiple signaling pathways in prostate cancer, likely accounting for the downstream effects on proliferation and apoptosis.""","""['Nicole D Facompre', 'Karam El-Bayoumy', 'Yuan-Wan Sun', 'John T Pinto', 'Raghu Sinha']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Differential effects of naturally occurring and synthetic organoselenium compounds on biomarkers in androgen responsive and androgen independent human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Remarkable inhibition of mTOR signaling by the combination of rapamycin and 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)selenocyanate in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Effects of naturally occurring and synthetic organoselenium compounds on protein profiling in androgen responsive and androgen independent human prostate cancer cells.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'To Cut the Mustard: Antimicrobial Activity of Selenocyanates on the Plate and in the Gas Phase.', 'Antitumor activity of a rhenium (I)-diselenoether complex in experimental models of human breast cancer.', 'Methylseleninic acid elevates REDD1 and inhibits prostate cancer cell growth despite AKT activation and mTOR dysregulation in hypoxia.', 'Influence of novel naphthalimide-based organoselenium on genotoxicity induced by an alkylating agent: the role of reactive oxygen species and selenoenzymes.', 'Selenium compounds, apoptosis and other types of cell death: an overview for cancer therapy.']"""

However, VEGF receptor (VEGFR) expression in human cancers, particularly the relative expression of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 in tumor vasculature versus tumor cells, is poorly defined.  Experimental design:   VEGFR-2- and VEGFR-3-specific antibodies were identified and used in the immunohistochemical analysis of human primary cancers and normal tissue. The relative vascular localization of both receptors in colorectal and breast cancers was determined by coimmunofluorescence with vascular markers.  Results:   VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 were expressed on vascular endothelium but not on malignant cells in 13 common human solid tumor types (n > 400, bladder, breast, colorectal, head and neck, liver, lung, skin, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, renal, stomach, and thyroid). The signal intensity of both receptors was significantly greater in vessels associated with malignant colorectal, lung, and breast than adjacent nontumor tissue. In colorectal cancers, VEGFR-2 was expressed on both intratumoral blood and lymphatic vessels, whereas VEGFR-3 was found predominantly on lymphatic vessels. In breast cancers, both receptors were localized to and upregulated on blood vessels.  Conclusions:   VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 are primarily localized to, and significantly upregulated on, tumor vasculature (blood and/or lymphatic) supporting the majority of solid cancers. The primary clinical mechanism of action of VEGF signaling inhibitors is likely to be through the targeting of tumor vessels rather than tumor cells.

Recent studies have shown that TF PCA can be modulated by GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident molecular chaperone. In this study, we investigated the role of cell surface GRP78 in modulating TF PCA in several human cancer cell lines. Although both GRP78 and TF are present on the cell surface of cancer cells, there was no evidence of a stable interaction between recombinant human GRP78 and TF, nor was there any effect of exogenously added recombinant GRP78 on cell surface TF PCA. Treatment of cells with the ER stress-inducing agent thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump that causes Ca(2+) efflux from ER stores, increased cytosolic [Ca(2+)] and induced TF PCA. Consistent with these findings, anti-GRP78 autoantibodies that were isolated from the serum of patients with prostate cancer and bind to a specific N-terminal epitope (Leu(98)-Leu(115)) on cell surface GRP78, caused a dose-dependent increase in cytosolic [Ca(2+)] and enhanced TF PCA. The ability to interfere with cell surface GRP78 binding, block phospholipase C activity, sequester ER Ca(2+), or prevent plasma membrane phosphatidylserine exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the TF PCA induced by anti-GRP78 autoantibodies. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that engagement of the anti-GRP78 autoantibodies with cell surface GRP78 increases TF PCA through a mechanism that involves the release of Ca(2+) from ER stores. Furthermore, blocking GRP78 signaling on the surface of cancer cells attenuates TF PCA and has the potential to reduce the risk of cancer-related venous thromboembolism.""","""['Ali A Al-Hashimi', 'Jennifer Caldwell', 'Mario Gonzalez-Gronow', 'Salvatore V Pizzo', 'Danya Aboumrad', 'Lindsay Pozza', 'Hiam Al-Bayati', 'Jeffrey I Weitz', 'Alan Stafford', 'Howard Chan', 'Anil Kapoor', 'Donald W Jacobsen', 'Jeffrey G Dickhout', 'Richard C Austin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Binding of anti-GRP78 autoantibodies to cell surface GRP78 increases tissue factor procoagulant activity via the release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum stores.', 'Autoantibodies against the cell surface-associated chaperone GRP78 stimulate tumor growth via tissue factor.', 'Overexpression of the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein/immunoglobulin-binding protein (GRP78/BiP) inhibits tissue factor procoagulant activity.', 'Thapsigargin down-regulates protein levels of GRP78/BiP in INS-1E cells.', 'Linking cell-surface GRP78 to cancer: From basic research to clinical value of GRP78 antibodies.', 'Glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) is an important cell surface receptor for viral invasion, cancers, and neurological disorders.', 'Heat shock proteins and metal ions - Reaction or interaction?', 'Scratching the Surface-An Overview of the Roles of Cell Surface GRP78 in Cancer.', 'The loss-of-function PCSK9Q152H variant increases ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94 and protects against liver injury.', 'Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies induce endothelial cell activation and accelerate the development of atherosclerotic lesions.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone GRP78 Protects Heart From Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Through Akt Activation.']"""

We have previously described a rapid (3-5 min) and P2X7-dependent depletion of nuclear phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and effects on downstream targets, and here we studied mechanisms behind the pAkt depletion. We show that cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, or extracellular ATP, induced a complex and coordinated response in insulin-stimulated A549 cells leading to depletion of nuclear pAkt. It involved protein/lipid phosphatases PTEN, pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat phosphatase (PHLPP1 and -2), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and calcineurin. We employed immunocytology, immunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assay techniques and show that PHLPP and calcineurin translocated to the nucleus and formed complexes with Akt within 3 min. Also PTEN translocated to the nucleus and then co-localized with pAkt close to the nuclear membrane. An inhibitor of the scaffolding immunophilin FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) and calcineurin, FK506, prevented depletion of nuclear pAkt. Furthermore, okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A, prevented the nuclear pAkt depletion. Chemical inhibition and siRNA indicated that PHLPP, PP2A, and PTEN were required for a robust depletion of nuclear pAkt, and in prostate cancer cells lacking PTEN, transfection of PTEN restored the statin-induced pAkt depletion. The activation of protein and lipid phosphatases was paralleled by a rapid proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) translocation to the nucleus, a PCNA-p21(cip1) complex formation, and cyclin D1 degradation. We conclude that these effects reflect a signaling pathway for rapid depletion of pAkt that may stop the cell cycle.""","""['Oras Mistafa', 'Aram Ghalali', 'Sandeep Kadekar', 'Johan Högberg', 'Ulla Stenius']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Silencing p110β prevents rapid depletion of nuclear pAkt.', 'Atorvastatin prevents ATP-driven invasiveness via P2X7 and EHBP1 signaling in PTEN-expressing prostate cancer cells.', 'Statins exhibit anticancer effects through modifications of the pAkt signaling pathway.', 'PTEN and Other PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Lipid Phosphatases in Breast Cancer.', 'New insights into Notch1 regulation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR1 signaling axis: targeted therapy of γ-secretase inhibitor resistant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.', 'Liver PP2A-Cα Protects From Parenteral Nutrition-associated Hepatic Steatosis.', 'Peroxynitrite nitration of Tyr 56 in Hsp90 induces PC12\xa0cell death through P2X7R-dependent PTEN activation.', 'P2X7 Receptor is Involved in Mitochondrial Dysfunction Induced by Extracellular Alpha Synuclein in Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cells.', 'P2X7 Interactions and Signaling - Making Head or Tail of It.', 'Ligand-independent activation of the P2X7 receptor by Hsp90 inhibition stimulates motor neuron apoptosis.']"""

There have been a few case reports of apoplexy from a previously undiagnosed pituitary tumour, occurring within hours to days of initiation of GnRHA therapy. We report a case of delayed onset pituitary apoplexy following GnRHA therapy. A 71-year-old man presented three weeks after onset of headache and vision loss. On examination, he was blind in the right eye with an intact nasal field of vision in the left eye. Two months before presentation, he had a subcutaneous GnRHA (Goserelin) implant for treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer (Gleeson 4+3). An MRI scan revealed a large sellar/suprasellar mass. His follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were grossly elevated. A trans-sphenoidal endoscopic decompression of the pituitary tumour was performed. His vision improved post-operatively and his FSH, LH, testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels returned to normal levels. Histopathologic studies revealed a pituitary adenoma, which stained positive for FSH and LH. The prostate cancer management was changed to an anti-androgen agent and a GnRH antagonist.

Methods and materials:   We studied 6,416 men treated with brachytherapy in one of 21 community-based practices. Cox regression and Fine and Gray's regression were used to determine whether volume ≤20 cc was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (ACM) or prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), respectively, after adjustment for other known prognostic factors.  Results:   443 patients (6.9%) had a prostate volume ≤20 cc. After a median follow-up of 2.91 years (interquartile range, 1.06-4.79), volume ≤20 cc was associated with a significantly higher risk of ACM (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.33 [95% CI 1.08-1.65], p = 0.0085) with 3-year estimates of ACM for ≤20 cc vs. >20 cc of 13.0% vs. 6.9% (p = 0.028). Only 23 men (0.36%) have died of prostate cancer, and no difference was seen in PCSM by volume (p = 0.4).  Conclusion:   Men with small prostates at the time of implant had a 33% higher risk of ACM, and the underlying cause of this remains uncertain.

Methods and materials:   In this case-control study, dosimetry and anatomy were compared between 50 patients with AUR (cases) and 50 patients without AUR (controls). Cases and controls were randomly selected from our database. The following structures were delineated on magnetic resonance imaging: prostate, urethra, peripheral zone, transitional zone, apex, base, midprostate, lower sphincter, and bladder neck. The dosimetric parameters analyzed were D(10), D(50), D(90), V(100), V(150), and V(200). The anatomic parameters analyzed were prostate protrusion into the bladder, bladder overlap, urethra angle, and urethra-bladder angle. The delineator was blinded to the patient's AUR status. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association of these factors with AUR.  Results:   The dose delivered to different regions of the prostate was not significantly associated with the risk of AUR. Only dose to the bladder neck was significantly associated with AUR (odds ratio 1.13 per 10 Gy; 95% CI 1.02;1.26; p = 0.023). Mean bladder neck D(90) was 65 Gy in AUR cases vs. 56 Gy in controls (p = 0.016), and mean bladder neck D(10) was 128 Gy vs. 107 Gy, respectively (p = 0.018). Furthermore, on univariate analysis, a larger extent of both bladder overlap and of prostate protrusion were associated with a higher risk of AUR (odds ratio 1.16; 95% CI 1.04-1.28; p = 0.005, and odds ratio 1.83; 95% CI 1.37-2.45; p < 0.001, respectively). The mean extent of prostate protrusion was 3.5 mm in AUR cases vs. 1.0 mm in controls (p < 0.001). Odds ratios did not change substantially after adjustment for potential confounders. On multivariate analysis, the extent of prostate protrusion seemed to be a stronger risk factor for AUR than bladder overlap.

Methods and materials:   Two hundred twelve prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy were evaluated with a median follow-up of 9.8 years. Genotyping was performed using hybridization with custom-designed allele-specific probes. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms within the matrix metalloproteinase-7 gene were assessed with respect to age at diagnosis, margin status, extracapsular extension, lymph node involvement, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival in paraffin-embedded prostate tissue specimens from patients with early-stage prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Rs10895304 was the sole significant polymorphism. The A/G genotype of rs10895304 had a statistically significant association with recurrence-free survival in postprostatectomy patients (p = 0.0061, log-rank test). The frequency of the risk-reducing genotype (A/A) was 74%, whereas that of the risk-enhancing genotypes (A/G and G/G) were 20% and 6%, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression analyses detected a significant association between rs10895304 and recurrences after adjustment for known prognostic factors. The G allele of this polymorphism was associated with increased risk of prostate cancer recurrence (adjusted hazards ratio, 3.375; 95% confidence interval 1.567-7.269; p < 0.001). The other assayed polymorphisms were not significant, and no correlations were made to other clinical variables.  Conclusions:   The A/G genotype of rs10895304 is predictive of decreased recurrence-free survival in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Our data suggest that for this subset of patients, prostatectomy alone may not be adequate for local control.

A cone beam CT (CBCT) was performed on day 2 before the second fraction was given. A fusion of the CBCT and CT was performed using intraprostatic gold markers as landmarks. Initial prostate and urethra contours were transferred to the CBCT images. Bladder and rectum contours were drawn, and catheters were digitized on the CBCT. The planned treatment was applied to the CBCT dataset, and dosimetry was analyzed and compared to the initial dose distribution. This process was repeated after a reoptimization was performed, using the same constraints used on day 1.  Results:   Mean interfraction catheter displacement was 5.1 mm. When we used the initial plan on day 2, the mean prostate V100 (volume receiving 100 Gy or more) decreased from 93.8% to 76.2% (p < 0.01). Rectal V75 went from 0.75 cm(3) to 1.49 cm(3) (p < 0.01).

Despite improvements in standard treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, many patients still progress to advanced stages. Recent clinical trials have shown encouraging results regarding the application of angiogenic inhibitors in the treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases, paving the way for novel PCa therapies.  Objective:   To identify new antiangiogenic compounds and examine their therapeutic potential in models of PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed a chemical genetic screen in developing zebrafish embryos to identify small molecules inhibiting zebrafish angiogenesis. Transgenic Tg(flk1:EGFP) zebrafish embryos were used in the screening of the Spectrum Collection compound library. Subsequently, the antiangiogenic mechanism of an identified lead compound, rosuvastatin, was studied by conducting endothelial cell function assays and examining antitumor efficacy in a PCa xenograft mouse model. MEASUREMENTS, RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Seven lead compounds, including isorotenone, dihydromunduletone, aristolochic acid, simvastatin, mevastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin, were identified to inhibit the growth of the zebrafish intersegmental vessels. Of these seven leads, rosuvastatin was further evaluated for its antiangiogenic mechanism and anticancer efficacy. Rosuvastatin decreased the viability of the human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) (one-half inhibitory concentration: 5.87 microM) by inducing G(1) phase arrest and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, rosuvastatin remarkably inhibited the migration of HUVECs and dose-dependently inhibited the HUVEC capillary-like tube formation in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that rosuvastatin suppressed xenografted PPC-1 prostate tumors in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice associated with decreased microvessel density (MVD) and tumor cell apoptosis.

Methods:   A cohort of 4903 men who participated in Prostate Cancer Awareness Week in the years 2007 or 2008 were enrolled in this study from multiple clinical institutions. Within this cohort 1379 men (28.2%) were on a statin medication.

In multivariate regression analysis we controlled for age, body mass index (BMI), and race.  Results:   The mean age of the population was 60.7 years. Serum testosterone levels in patients on statin medication were significantly lower than in patients not on statins (P < .001). Mean total cholesterol levels were similar between the 2 groups (P = .229). Mean serum PSA level was 1.56 ng/mL in patients on statin medication and 1.48 ng/mL in patients not on statin (P = .120). After adjusting for significant covariates (age, BMI, and race), statin use was shown to have a significant association with lower mean PSA (P = .008) and lower mean testosterone (P < .001) and similar total cholesterol (P = .083).

The adverse effects occur more frequently than with others chemotherapy (mitoxantrone) but are moderated and aren't responsible of specific mortality. These facts encourage to begin the chemotherapy as earlier as possible even before metastases appear. Some studies have even raised the issue of an initiation of chemotherapy before the onset of hormone independence. However these arguments might be use with caution. The treated patients have a limited life expectancy and a 2 months gain of survival may be of limited value. Furthermore, even low side effects can generate a morbidity on these fragile patients especially when they are initially asymptomatic.

Methods:   Eighteen couples were interviewed regarding their adjustment to ADT side effects.  Results:   Three distinct patterns of adjustment were observed. One group of couples had assumed sex to be impossible after commencing ADT, and quickly accepted the loss of sex in exchange for a life extending treatment (four couples).

The third group had struggled, but found that they were satisfied with their sexual outcome (nine couples). A subset of these couples successfully adjusted to changes in the man's sexual function and found satisfying ways to be sexually active (five couples).  Conclusions:   The finding that some couples are able to enjoy satisfying sex, despite castrate levels of testosterone, raised questions about how patients are prepared to undergo ADT and how they are managed.

Exposure of DU145 prostate tumor cells to HGF stimulates the PI3-kinase and MAPK pathways, leading to increased scattering, motility, and invasion, which was prevented by the addition of EGCG. EGCG acted at the level of preventing phosphorylation of tyrosines 1234/1235 in the kinase domain of the c-Met receptor without effecting dimerization. HGF-induced changes were independent of the formation of reactive oxygen species, suggesting that EGCG functioned independent of its antioxidant ability. ECG, another tea polyphenol, was as effective as EGCG, while EGC and EC were less effective. EGCG added up to 4 h after the addition of HGF still blocked cell scattering and reduced the HGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met, Akt, and Erk, suggesting that EGCG could act both by preventing activation of c-Met by HGF and by attenuating the activity of pathways already induced by HGF. HGF did not activate the MAPK and PI3-K pathways in cells treated with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (mCD) to remove cholesterol. Furthermore, subcellular fractionation approaches demonstrated that only phosphorylated c-Met accumulated in Triton X-100 membrane insoluble fractions, supporting a role for lipid rafts in regulating c-Met signaling. Finally, EGCG treatment inhibited DiIC16 incorporation into membrane lipid ordered domains, and cholesterol partially inhibited the EGCG effects on signaling.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is characterized by abnormal epithelial and stromal proliferation. Varying androgen hormone levels in elderly men are correlated with abnormal proliferations of the prostate. Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), a subtype of G-protein-coupled receptors, is known to induce multiple biological processes. It could also play a key role in the proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer, but its effect on BPH pathogenesis is to a great extent unknown.  Methods:   Localization of PAR2 was determined both in pathologically altered and in normal prostate tissues by using immunohistochemical techniques. PAR2 activity was assessed by measuring changes in intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)](i) following stimulation of cultured stromal cells with a PAR2 agonist (trypsin) and a synthetic PAR2-activating peptide (AP). DHT-dependence of PAR2 expression in prostate cancer and prostatic stromal cell lines was examined with semi-quantitative and quantitative PCR. Cultured stromal cells (hPCPs) were stimulated with PAR2 AP and cell proliferation was determined through [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation.  Results:   In comparison to normal prostate, PAR2 expression was increased in BPH stroma. DHT induced a higher expression of PAR2 when sub-physiological DHT-levels were used. Higher levels of DHT produced reduced PAR2 expression. A mitogenic effect was induced by applying PAR2 AP to hPCPs-cells.

Ligand-independent activation of AR in AIPC or castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is often associated with poor prognosis. Recently, tyrosine kinase Ack1 has been shown to regulate AR activity by phosphorylating it at tyrosine 267 and this event was shown to be critical for AIPC growth. However, whether a small molecule inhibitor that can mitigate Ack1 activation is sufficient to abrogate AR activity on AR regulated promoters in androgen-depleted environment is not known.  Methods:   We have generated two key resources, antibodies that specifically recognize pTyr267-AR and synthesized a small molecule inhibitor of Ack1, 4-amino-5,6-biaryl-furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (named here as AIM-100) to test whether AIM-100 modulates ligand-independent AR activity and inhibits prostate cell growth.  Results:   Prostate tissue microarray analysis indicates that Ack1 Tyr284 phosphorylation correlates positively with disease progression and negatively with the survival of prostate cancer patients. Interestingly, neither pTyr267-AR expression nor its transcriptional activation was affected by anti-androgens in activated Ack1 expressing or EGF stimulated prostate cells. However, the Ack1 inhibitor, AIM-100, not only inhibited Ack1 activation but also able to suppress pTyr267-AR phosphorylation, binding of AR to PSA, NKX3.1, and TMPRSS2 promoters, and inhibit AR transcription activity.

Therefore, we evaluated the prognostic value of nuclear roundness variance (NRV) for prostate cancer (PCa) progression, metastasis and PCa-specific death free survivals in a cohort of 116 men after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Method:   NRV was calculated for each case using the variance of the nuclear roundness from approximately 150 nuclei captured at a magnification of 2,440x for each case in 1992-1993. $${\rm Nuclear}\,{\rm roundness} = {{{\rm Radius}({\rm circumference})} \over {{\rm radius}({\rm area})}} = {R \over r} = {{P/2\pi } \over {\sqrt {A/\pi } }}$$ NRV data were merged with clinical, pathologic, and follow-up data for all patients in 2009.

Results:   Median follow-up time after RP for all patients was 19 years (range: 1-25 years, mean: 17 years), with approximately 92% (107/116), 71% (82/116), and 47% (55/116) patients having >or=10, 15, and 20 years of follow-up, respectively.

Of note, NRV C-Index was significantly higher compared to Gleason Score C-Index for metastasis (0.7332 vs. 0.6046; P = 0.027) and PCa-specific death (0.8090 vs. 0.6336; P = 0.004) free survival predictions. However, the difference between NRV and Gleason Score C-Indexes was not statistically significant for progression free survival prediction (0.7080 vs. 0.6463; P = 0.106).

Human prostate cancer is androgen dependent. Estrogens, including the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES), are used in prostate cancer treatment to reduce androgen levels via feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic release of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LH-RH). DES has also direct anticancer activities, such as apoptosis induction. We investigated in vitro the effect of DES on telomerase activity and on gene expression in the presence and absence of androgens. We used two prostate cancer cell lines: LNCaP (androgen dependent) and PC3 (androgen independent).  Methods:   LNCaP and PC3 cells were treated with 0.1-1,000 nM testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the presence of DES (25 or 50 microM). Cell telomerase activity and gene expression (mRNA) were measured.  Results:   LNCaP: As expected, testosterone and DHT significantly increased telomerase activity and gene expression. However, these effects were inhibited by DES. Contrary to expectations, the combination of DES and testosterone functioned synergistically leading to complete inhibition of telomerase activity. PC3: Testosterone and DHT did not affect telomerase activity and gene expression, whereas DES, in the absence or presence of the androgens, significantly inhibited telomerase activity.  Conclusions:   In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of DES to inhibit telomerase in prostate cancer cells. Androgens did not limit the inhibitory effect and even acted synergistically with DES in the LNCaP line.

The overexpression or knockdown techniques for specific target protein were also used in this study.  Results:   WJ9708011 induced time- and concentration-dependent G1 arrest of the cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. The G1-arrest effect was confirmed by down-regulated expressions of several G1-phase regulators, including cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-4, Cdk2, phospho-RB, E2F-1, and Cdc25A.

The viability of cells treated with hJ591-SAZAP was also examined and the apoptotic cells were measured. Lastly, the anticancer effect of hJ591-SAZAP was investigated in vivo.  Results:   The binding ability of hJ591-SAZAP to PSMA was equivalent to that of unconjugated J591.

The growth inhibitory effect could be attributed to cell cycle block and apoptosis induction. The current study was designed to investigate the involvement of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) in the anticancer effect of MSA.  Methods:   LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells were treated with 10 microM MSA for various time points, and the expression of FOXO1 was analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. FOXO1 activity was determined by a luciferase construct containing FOXO binding sites. The trans-activation activity of the androgen receptor (AR) was determined by the ARE-luciferase assay. FOXO1 gene silencing was achieved by using a small interfering RNA (siRNA).  Results:   MSA treatment led to a rapid and robust increase of FOXO1 expression, as well as an increase of the FOXO1 transcriptional activity. Blocking FOXO1 activation by gene silencing abolished apoptosis induction by MSA, suggesting FOXO1 plays a critical role in mediating the apoptotic effect of MSA. Recent studies have shown that FOXO1 and AR antagonize the actions of each other. We examined the consequence of FOXO1 induction on AR activity. Consistent with previous reports, we found that ectopic expression of FOXO1 suppressed the transcriptional activity of AR. Furthermore, FOXO1 silencing attenuated MSA suppression of AR activity, suggesting that FOXO1 induction contributes to suppression of AR signaling by MSA.

In humans, two 5alpha-reductase isoenyzmes are expressed: type I and type II. Type II is found primarily in prostate tissue. Saw palmetto extract (SPE) has been widely used for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The mechanisms of the pharmacological effects of SPE include the inhibition of 5alpha-reductase, among other actions. Clinical studies of SPE have been equivocal, with some showing significant results and others not. These inconsistent results may be due, in part, to varying bioactivities of the SPE used in the studies.  Methods:   The aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro potency of a novel saw palmetto ethanol extract (SPET-085), an inhibitor of the 5alpha-reductase isoenzyme type II, in a cell-free test system. On the basis of the enzymatic conversion of the substrate androstenedione to the 5alpha-reduced product 5alpha-androstanedione, the inhibitory potency was measured and compared to those of finasteride, an approved 5alpha-reductase inhibitor.  Results:   SPET-085 concentration-dependently inhibited 5alpha-reductase type II in vitro (IC(50)=2.88+/-0.45 microg/mL). The approved 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, finasteride, tested as positive control, led to 61% inhibition of 5alpha-reductase type II.  Conclusion:   SPET-085 effectively inhibits the enzyme that has been linked to BPH, and the amount of extract required for activity is very low compared to data reported for other extracts. It can be concluded from data in the literature that SPET-085 is as effective as a hexane extract of saw palmetto that exhibited the highest levels of bioactivity, and is more effective than other SPEs tested.

Comparison of non-endorectal versus endorectal MR imaging""","""Purpose:   The goal of this study was to compare the diagnostic use and safety of endorectal coil (ERC) MRI with those of phased-array coil MRI.  Methods:   We retrospectively included 91 consecutive patients who had undergone 1.5-T MRI with ERC or with phased-array coil MRI before radical prostatectomy at our institution. We compared 47 patients' phased-array coil MRI and 44 patients' ERC-MRI with histologic findings. We also evaluated adverse events following the MRI procedure.  Results:   The serum PSA levels ranged from 2.85 to 33.51 ng/mL (10.72 ± 1.9), and the median Gleason score was 7 (range 4-9). The mean interval between diagnostic prostate biopsy and staging MRI was 18.4 days (range 2-37). In assessing organ-confined disease, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion by MRI, there were no significant differences between ERC-MR group and phased-array coil MR group. The AUC values were 0.671 (95% CI 0.530-0.813) for ERC-MR and 0.657 (95% CI 0.503-0.811) for phased-array coil MR. No significant differences were found between the two groups (p = 0.24). Five patients (11.4%) developed rectal complications after ERC-MRI. However, no complications were found in phased-array coil MRI group.  Conclusions:   In terms of diagnostic accuracy and comfort of patients, the use of ERC-MRI did not significantly improve the staging of prostate cancer and presented several complications. Therefore, phased-array coil MRI is a better alternative considering comorbidity.""","""['Seung Hwan Lee', 'Kyung Kgi Park', 'Kyung Hwa Choi', 'Beom Jin Lim', 'Joo Hee Kim', 'Seung Wook Lee', 'Byung Ha Chung']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Prostate cancer: comparison of local staging accuracy of pelvic phased-array coil alone versus integrated endorectal-pelvic phased-array coils.

SLIT2, however, has not been studied in prostate cancer. Through genome-wide location analysis we identified SLIT2 as a target of polycomb group (PcG) protein EZH2. The EZH2-containing polycomb repressive complexes bound to the SLIT2 promoter inhibiting its expression. SLIT2 was downregulated in a majority of metastatic prostate tumors, showing a negative correlation with EZH2. This repressed expression could be restored by methylation inhibitors or EZH2-suppressing compounds. In addition, a low level of SLIT2 expression was associated with aggressive prostate, breast and lung cancers. Functional assays showed that SLIT2 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Thus, this study showed for the first time the epigenetic silencing of SLIT2 in prostate tumors, and supported SLIT2 as a potential biomarker for aggressive solid tumors.

Methods:   Charts of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and prostate cancer (PC) patients treated at Moffitt Cancer Center between January 1999 and September 2006 were reviewed, and patients who received cyclophosphamide, doxoruicin, vincristine, prednisone, rituximab or Docetaxel plus steroids were eligible. Demographics, vitals, comorbidity, laboratory parameters including baseline and average glucose level during chemotherapy, G4 hematological toxicity (HemT), and G3-G4 non-hematological toxicity (NHemT), progression, and death dates were recorded.  Results:   A total of 349 patients were eligible (NHL/PC: 162/187). G4 HemT was experienced by 76 (47%) NHL and 9 (5%) PC patients. Seventy-nine NHL and 90 PC patients had G3-G4 NHemT. The most frequent NHemT were as follows: neuropathy (25.3%), fever (non-neutropenic, 18.9%), fatigue (15.2%), for NHL; and fatigue (22.1%), thromboembolic events (11.6%), and diarrhea (9.3%) for PC. For NHL patients, G3-G4 NHemT was associated with baseline hyperglycemia (P = 0.0384, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test) as well as with average glycemia during chemotherapy (P = 0.0048), whereas there was no significant correlation for HemT. For PC patients, a positive correlation was found between baseline hyperglycemia and G4 HemT (P = 0.0241), while univariate correlations between average glycemia during chemotherapy and G4 HemT and between both baseline and average glycemia with NHemT were not significant, multivariate correlation between average glycemia during chemotherapy and overall severe toxicity was significant at 0.05 level.  Conclusions:   In NHL patients, hyperglycemia correlates with NHemT, and a similar although less clear pattern is suggested in PC patients.

Materials and methods:   Gold fiducial markers were inserted in prostate under U/S guidance and daily portal images were taken and compared with digitally reconstructed images, both using bony landmarks and fiducial markers as reference. A dose of 2 MU was given for two orthogonal images daily. The mean and standard deviation of displacement using gold seeds and bone were calculated. Systematic and random errors were generated. The planning target volume (PTV) was calculated using the Van Herk formula.  Results:   A total of 180 portal images from 10 patients were studied. The mean displacement along x, y and z axes was 1.67 mm, 3.58 mm, and 1.76 mm using fiducial markers and 2.12 mm, 3.47 mm, and 2.09 mm using bony landmarks, respectively. The mean internal organ motion was 1.23 mm (+1.45), 3.11 mm (+2.69 mm); and 1.87 mm (+1.67 mm) along x, y and z axes, respectively. The PTV to account for prostate motion if daily matching was not done was 4.64 mm, 10.41 mm and 4.40 mm along lateral, superoinferior, and anteroposterior directions, respectively. If bony landmarks were used for daily matching, margins of 3.61 mm, 7.31 mm, and 4.72 mm in lateral, superoinferior, and anteroposterior directions should be added to the clinical target volume.

Methods:   3048 male participants of The Rotterdam Study were included. Prostate cancer cases and non-cases were studied for differences in baseline hormone levels with Student's t-test. General linear models were performed on different random subsets of hormone levels to study associations with genotype. Cox' proportional hazard models were used to study prostate cancer incidence and mortality among genotypes.  Results:   Both DHEAS sulphate as free-testosterone were significantly increased at baseline in males who developed a prostate cancer within the study period. CYP3A4 G-allele carriage was associated with lower levels of estrone sulphate (p=0.005) and higher levels of estradiol (p=0.04) compared to non-carriers. CYP3A5 A-allele carriage was associated with increased levels of estrone sulphate (p=0.02). CYP3A7 G-allele carriage was associated with the highest number of significant differences in steroid hormone levels. Carriers of the allele resulting in continued enzyme expression during adulthood had decreased levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulphate (p=0.05), androstenedione (p=0.006), estrone (p=0.0001) and estrone sulphate (p=0.003) compared to mean levels of these hormones in homozygous wild type carriers. CYP3A43 genotype was not associated with any of the studied hormone levels. However, carriers of the CYP3A43 G-allele showed a significant 5-fold increase in mortality among early onset diagnosed prostate cancers.  Conclusion:   Increased levels of free testosterone and DHEA sulphate were associated with prostate cancer incidence along the study period. Primarily the amount of CYP3A7 expression seemed to affect steroid hormone levels.

As a result, survivors have a protracted course, harboring considerable clinical and economic implications. Thus, we investigated the extent to which health service use and expenditures vary during continuing prostate cancer care.  Materials and methods:   We identified 105,961 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1992 and 2005 using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data. All Medicare payments for prostate cancer related care were assigned to a phase of care (initial, continuing care or end of life), price adjusted and standardized. Patients were sorted into 5 equal groups (quintiles) based on annual per capita continuing care expenditures. We then enumerated the use of common prostate cancer health services.  Results:   Average annual per capita continuing care phase expenditures were $36 to $4,724 in the lowest to the highest expenditure group, respectively. Office visits (27.3%) and androgen deprivation (62.7%) comprised most physician related payments for prostate cancer survivorship care. The use of each common health service grew with increasing continuing care intensity (each p <0.001). However, the magnitude of variation in each prostate cancer risk stratum was substantially greater than that between risk strata, eg low risk and metastatic disease, in patients with similar spending.  Conclusions:   In Medicare beneficiaries the prostate cancer continuing care phase is associated with substantial variation, resulting in potentially unnecessary excess cost to the health care system. Variation was evident across the spectrum of disease severity and implies the need for better evidence to inform clinical practice.""","""['Ted A Skolarus', 'Yun Zhang', 'David C Miller', 'John T Wei', 'Brent K Hollenbeck']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Cost of care for elderly cancer patients in the United States.', 'Cumulative cost pattern comparison of prostate cancer treatments.', 'Prostate cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life, satisfaction, and economic outcome measures in studies of prostate cancer screening and treatment, 1990-2000.', 'The economic burden of prostate cancer.', 'Utilization and Outcomes of Surgical Castration in Comparison to Medical Castration in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Association between HIV infection and outcomes of care among medicare enrollees with breast cancer.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is Associated with Increased Medicare Spending in Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance.', 'Quality of care and economic considerations of active surveillance of men with prostate cancer.', 'Increased KIF4A expression is a potential prognostic factor in prostate cancer.']"""

We used data from a randomized, controlled trial to examine such discrepancies.  Material and methods:   The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Groups Study 7 randomized men with locally advanced prostate cancer to antiandrogen monotherapy or to the same hormone treatment combined with external beam radiotherapy after 3 months of total androgen blockade. We selected a subsample of 333 men with valid ratings at baseline, and at 12 and 24-month followup for this prospective substudy. We also examined a cross-sectional sample of 305 men at the end of radiotherapy. We compared patient and physician ratings of frequency of daytime and nighttime urination, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, bowel problems, nausea/vomiting, breast tenderness and gynecomastia.  Results:   Perfect agreement between patient and physician ratings was observed in 70% to 100% of cases at baseline, in 73% to 98% at 12 months and in 65% to 97% at 24 months. There were 1% to 20% changes in perfect agreement with time. With patient ratings as the gold standard physicians more often underrated than overrated adverse events, except bowel problems, which were overrated at all posttreatment points.  Conclusions:   In a randomized, controlled trial of external beam radiotherapy and hormone manipulation physicians recorded pelvis related adverse events in acceptable accordance with their patients with prostate cancer. The oncologist tendency to overestimate bowel problems after radiotherapy needs further investigation. Our positive findings from a formal trial should not be transferred to daily clinical practice without further studies of discrepancies in routine clinical practice.""","""['E Andreas Svaboe Steinsvik', 'Sophie D Fosså', 'Karol Axcrona', 'Per Fransson', 'Anders Widmark', 'Alv A Dahl']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Five-year outcomes after prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer: the prostate cancer outcomes study.', 'A randomized trial comparing radical prostatectomy plus endocrine therapy versus external beam radiotherapy plus endocrine therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer: results at median follow-up of 102 months.', 'Gynecomastia and breast pain induced by adjuvant therapy with bicalutamide after radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer: the role of tamoxifen and radiotherapy.', 'Incidence, etiology, location, prevention and treatment of positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Endocrine treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Agreement between patient reported outcomes and clinical reports after radical prostatectomy - a prospective longitudinal study.', 'Psychometric properties of the expanded prostate cancer index composite - 26 instrument in a cohort of radical prostatectomy patients: theoretical and practical examinations.', 'The association between clinician-based common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) and patient-reported outcomes (PRO): a systematic review.', 'Commentary.', 'Comparing adverse event rates of oral blood glucose-lowering drugs reported by patients and healthcare providers: a post-hoc analysis of observational studies published between 1999 and 2011.']"""

Assignment to stage IV prostate cancer may occur by different modes, namely as T4N0M0 vs N1 vs M1 disease. We hypothesize that patients with clinical T4 disease have better outcomes than those with N1 or M1 disease.  Materials and methods:   A total of 17 SEER registries were queried from 1995 through 2003. Multivariate and univariate analyses examined overall survival and prostate cancer specific survival across subcategories of stage IV disease while controlling for various patient and disease related characteristics.  Results:   There were 615 patients with cT4N0M0 disease, 3,189 with TxN1M0 and 10,893 with TxNxM1 who met the study inclusion criteria. Survival differences were observed between cT4N0M0 and M1 cancer, between N1 and M1 disease, and were most pronounced in younger patients (age 50 years or younger), gradually narrowing with increasing patient age. Factors that demonstrated significant association with poor survival included higher tumor grade, unknown tumor grade and absence of a spouse.  Conclusions:   Staging systems based on American Joint Committee on Cancer/TNM staging enables the grouping of patients into homogenous categories for treatment selection and prognostication. However, our data suggest that not all stage IV prostate cancers behave similarly. The difference in survival among locally advanced (T4), node positive and distantly metastatic stage IV prostate cancer appears to be dependent on patient age.""","""['Wayland Hsiao', 'Kelvin A Moses', 'Michael Goodman', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Peter J Rossi', 'Viraj A Master']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Radical prostatectomy for clinical T4 prostate cancer.', 'Posttreatment TNM staging is a prognostic indicator of survival and recurrence in tethered or fixed rectal carcinoma after preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy.', 'Lymphovascular invasion is an independent prognostic factor in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphism profiling may improve the prediction of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective, multi-institutional study of 703 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer who had at least 5 years of followup after surgery. All patients were genotyped for 83 prostate cancer related single nucleotide polymorphisms using a low density oligonucleotide microarray. Baseline clinicopathological variables and single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed to predict biochemical recurrence within 5 years using stepwise logistic regression. Discrimination was measured by ROC curve AUC, specificity, sensitivity, predictive values, net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination index.  Results:   The overall biochemical recurrence rate was 35%. The model with the best fit combined 8 covariates, including the 5 clinicopathological variables prostate specific antigen, Gleason score, pathological stage, lymph node involvement and margin status, and 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms at the KLK2, SULT1A1 and TLR4 genes. Model predictive power was defined by 80% positive predictive value, 74% negative predictive value and an AUC of 0.78. The model based on clinicopathological variables plus single nucleotide polymorphisms showed significant improvement over the model without single nucleotide polymorphisms, as indicated by 23.3% net reclassification improvement (p = 0.003), integrated discrimination index (p <0.001) and likelihood ratio test (p <0.001). Internal validation proved model robustness (bootstrap corrected AUC 0.78, range 0.74 to 0.82).

Our research group previously reported an association between these variants and clinicopathological characteristics. More recently 4 additional prostate cancer susceptibility variants were identified on chromosomes 2p15, 10q11, 11q13 and Xp11. We performed cumulative risk assessment incorporating all 9 genetic variants and determined the relationship of the new variants to clinicopathological tumor features.  Materials and methods:   The genotype of 9 variants was determined in 687 men of European ancestry who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2002 to 2008 and in 777 healthy volunteer controls. We compared the incidence of these variants in prostate cancer cases and controls, and assessed their cumulative risk. We also determined the relationship of carrier status for the 4 new variants and clinicopathological tumor features.  Results:   Prostate cancer cases had an increased incidence of all 9 risk variants compared to controls. A cumulative model including the 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms provided greater prostate cancer risk stratification than a model restricted to the original 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms described. Specifically men with 6 or more variants were at greater than 6-fold increased risk for prostate cancer. Although 2p15 and 11q13 carriers were more likely to have aggressive features, other clinicopathological features were similar in carriers and noncarriers.  Conclusions:   Genetic variants located in 9 regions have a cumulative association with prostate cancer risk. Identification of an increasing number of single nucleotide polymorphisms may provide greater understanding of their combined relationship with CaP risk and disease aggressiveness.""","""['Brian T Helfand', 'Angela J Fought', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Joshua J Meeks', 'Donghui Kan', 'William J Catalona']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Evaluation of 8q24 and 17q risk loci and prostate cancer mortality.', 'Pathological outcomes associated with the 17q prostate cancer risk variants.', 'Cumulative effect of five genetic variants on prostate cancer risk in multiple study populations.', 'Replication of the 10q11 and Xp11 prostate cancer risk variants: results from a Utah pedigree-based study.', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'Assessing the performance of genome-wide association studies for predicting disease risk.', 'Cumulative evidence for relationships between multiple variants of HNF1B and the risk of prostate and endometrial cancers.', 'An examination of clinical differences between carriers and non-carriers of chromosome 8q24 risk alleles in a New Zealand Caucasian population with prostate cancer.', 'Multigene panels in prostate cancer risk assessment: a systematic review.', 'Associations Between iCOGS Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Upgrading in Both Surgical and Active Surveillance Cohorts of Men with Prostate Cancer.']"""

Thus, we examined the combined effect of these factors on prostate specific antigen.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed 3,461 Korean men 30 to 80 years old with prostate volume data available who underwent routine evaluation. We examined the effect of plasma volume, homeostatic model assessment index, prostate volume and body mass index on prostate specific antigen, and prostate specific antigen mass and mass ratio (total circulating prostate specific antigen protein per prostate volume) by the trend test and/or ANOVA after adjusting for age and/or prostate volume.  Results:   Body mass index had positive associations with plasma volume, the homeostatic model assessment index and prostate volume (p for trend <0.01). Prostate specific antigen had a positive association with prostate volume and a negative association with plasma volume (p for trend <0.01) but not with homeostatic model assessment index. The adjusted R(2) of prostate volume vs prostate specific antigen was greater than for plasma volume vs prostate specific antigen while for body mass index vs prostate volume it was less than for body mass index vs plasma volume (0.0892, 0.0235, 0.1346 and 0.3360, respectively). Prostate specific antigen mass was not associated with plasma volume or body mass index but it was still associated with prostate volume after adjusting for plasma volume or body mass index (p for trend <0.01). Mean prostate specific antigen mass ratio did not change significantly across body mass index, plasma volume or prostate volume quartiles in men older than 55 years.  Conclusions:   It is not logical to lower the prostate specific antigen threshold based on only the hemodilution effect since body mass index related prostate volume enlargement can increase prostate specific antigen in obese men.

MT1-MMP is highly expressed in bone metastasis of prostate cancer (PC) patients and promotes intraosseous tumor growth of PC cells in mice. The majority of metastatic prostate cancers harbor loss-of-function mutations or deletions of the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten). However, the role of PTEN inactivation in MT1-MMP expression in PC cells has not been examined. In this study, prostate epithelial cell lines derived from mice that are either heterozygous (PTEN(+/-)) or homozygous (PTEN(-/-)) for PTEN deletion or harboring a wild-type PTEN (PTEN(+/+)) were used to investigate the expression of MT1-MMP. We found that biallelic loss of PTEN is associated with posttranslational regulation of MT1-MMP protein in mouse PC cells. PTEN(-/-) PC cells display higher levels of MT1-MMP at the cell surface when compared to PTEN(+/+) and PTEN(+/-) cells and consequently exhibited enhanced migratory and collagen-invasive activities. MT1-MMP displayed by PTEN(-/-) cells is differentially O-glycosylated and exhibits a slow rate of turnover. MT1-MMP expression in PTEN(-/-) cells is under control of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, as determined using pharmacological inhibitors. Interestingly, rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, upregulates MT1-MMP expression in PTEN(+/+) cells via PI3K activity. Collectively, these data in a mouse prostate cell system uncover for the first time a novel and complex relationship between PTEN loss-mediated PI3K/AKT activation and posttranslational regulation of MT1-MMP, which may play a role in PC progression.""","""['Seaho Kim', 'Wei Huang', 'Emilio P Mottillo', 'Anjum Sohail', 'Yoon-Ah Ham', 'M Katie Conley-Lacomb', 'Chong Jai Kim', 'Guri Tzivion', 'Hyeong-Reh Choi Kim', 'Shihua Wang', 'Yong Q Chen', 'Rafael Fridman']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Type 1 insulin-like growth factor regulates MT1-MMP synthesis and tumor invasion via PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling.', 'PTEN loss mediated Akt activation promotes prostate tumor growth and metastasis via CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling.', 'Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase is regulated by sp1 through the differential activation of AKT, JNK, and ERK pathways in human prostate tumor cells.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer, PI3K, PTEN and prognosis.', 'Human embryonic stem cells exert antitumor effects on prostate cancer cells in a co-culture microenvironment.', 'Concanavalin A as a promising lectin-based anti-cancer agent: the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential.', 'Autophagy provides a conceptual therapeutic framework for bone metastasis from prostate cancer.', 'Membrane-type I matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), lipid metabolism, and therapeutic implications.', 'MicroRNA-29a activates a multi-component growth and invasion program in glioblastoma.']"""

Objectives:   To report the oncologic outcome of HIFU as a primary care option for localized prostate cancer from a multicenter database.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with localized PCa treated with curative intent and presenting at least a 2-yr follow-up from February 1993 were considered in this study. Previously irradiated patients were excluded from this analysis. In case of any residual or recurrent PCa, patients were systematically offered a second session. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine disease-free survival rates (DFSR).  Measurements:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), clinical stage, and pathologic results were measured pre- and post-HIFU.  Results and limitations:   A total of 803 patients from six urologic departments met the inclusion criteria. Stratification according to d'Amico's risk group was low, intermediate, and high in 40.2%, 46.3%, and 13.5% of patients, respectively. Mean follow-up was 42+/-33 mo. Mean PSA nadir was 1.0+/-2.8 ng/ml with 54.3% reaching a nadir of < or =0.3 ng/ml. Control biopsies were negative in 85% of cases. The overall and cancer-specific survival rates at 8 yr were 89% and 99%, respectively. The metastasis-free survival rate at 8 yr was 97%.

The probability of a positive biopsy was calculated using previously published logistic regression coefficients. Predicted outcomes were compared to the actual biopsy results. Accuracy was calculated using the area under the curve as a measure of discrimination; calibration was explored graphically.  Results and limitations:   Biopsy-confirmed PCa was detected in 255 (41.1%) men. Median PCA3 score of biopsy-negative versus biopsy-positive men was 20 versus 48 in the total cohort, 17 versus 47 at initial biopsy, and 37 versus 53 at repeat biopsy (all p≤0.002). External validation of all four previously reported PCA3-based nomograms demonstrated equally high accuracy (0.73-0.75) and excellent calibration. The main limitations of the study reside in its early detection setting, referral scenario, and participation of only tertiary-care centers.  Conclusions:   In accordance with the original publication, previously developed PCA3-based nomograms achieved high accuracy and sufficient calibration. These novel nomograms represent robust tools and are thus generalizable to European men at risk of harboring PCa. Consequently, in presence of a PCA3 score, these nomograms may be safely used to assist clinicians when prostate biopsy is contemplated.""","""['Marco Auprich', 'Alexander Haese', 'Jochen Walz', 'Karl Pummer', 'Alexandre de la Taille', 'Markus Graefen', 'Theo de Reijke', 'Margit Fisch', 'Paul Kil', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Jacques Irani', 'Felix K-H Chun']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Felix K.

Cadmium has a long biological half-life (>25 years), due to the flat kinetics of its excretion. The prostate is one of the organs with highest levels of cadmium accumulation. Importantly, patients with prostate cancer appear to have higher levels of cadmium both in the circulation and in prostatic tissues.  Results:   In the current report, we demonstrate for the first time that cadmium down-regulates expression of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in prostate cancer cells. Cadmium-mediated XIAP depletion occurs at the post-transcriptional level via an NF-kappaB-independent, proteasome-mediated mechanism and coincides with an increased sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis. Prolonged treatment with cadmium results in selection of prostate cancer cells with apoptosis-resistant phenotype. Development of apoptosis-resistance coincides with restoration of XIAP expression in cadmium-selected PC-3 cells.  Conclusions:   Selection of cadmium-resistant cells could represent an adaptive survival mechanism that may contribute to progression of prostatic malignancies.""","""['Konstantin Golovine', 'Peter Makhov', 'Robert G Uzzo', 'Alexander Kutikov', 'David J Kaplan', 'Eric Fox', 'Vladimir M Kolenko']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) inhibits c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) activation by transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) through ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation of the TGF-beta1-activated kinase 1 (TAK1).', 'A Smac-mimetic sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via modulating both IAPs and NF-kappaB.', 'Zinc chelation induces rapid depletion of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis and sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.', 'Protein kinase C inhibition and x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein degradation contribute to the sensitization effect of luteolin on tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in cancer cells.', 'Chetomin induces degradation of XIAP and enhances TRAIL sensitivity in urogenital cancer cells.', 'LncRNA DUXAP10 Upregulation and the Hedgehog Pathway Activation Are Critically Involved in Chronic Cadmium Exposure-Induced Cancer Stem Cell-Like Property.', 'Cadmium induces mitochondrial ROS inactivation of XIAP pathway leading to apoptosis in neuronal cells.', 'Tan IIA inhibits H1299 cell viability through the MDM4‑IAP3 signaling pathway.', 'Induction of Plac8 promotes pro-survival function of autophagy in cadmium-induced prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Identification of XAF1-MT2A mutual antagonism as a molecular switch in cell-fate decisions under stressful conditions.']"""

It is commonly believed that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity can increase sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy. However, there is evidence that NF-kappaB activation can sensitize cells to apoptosis and that inhibition of NF-kappaB results in resistance to chemotherapy. In prostate cancer, it is not clear in the different cell types (androgen-dependent and castration-resistant) if activation or inhibition of NF-kappaB is required for stimulation of apoptosis by chemotherapy.  Results:   Our data indicate that the response of prostate cancer (PC) cells to the antimitotic drugs docetaxel (Doc) and 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is dependent on the levels of NF-kappaB activity. In androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, Doc and 2ME2 treatment increased the low basal NF-kappaB activity, as determined by Western blot analysis of phospho-IkappaBalpha/p65, NF-kappaB promoter reporter assays, and p65 localization. Treatment of LNCaP cells with parthenolide, a pharmacologic inhibitor of NF-kappaB, or introduction of dominant-negative IkappaBalpha, or an shRNA specific for p65, a component of the NF-kappaB heterodimer, blocked apoptosis induced by Doc and 2ME2. In castration-resistant DU145 and PC3 cells, Doc and 2ME2 had little effect on the high basal NF-kappaB activity and addition of parthenolide did not enhance cell death. However, the combination of Doc or 2ME2 with betulinic acid (BA), a triterpenoid that activates NF-kappaB, stimulated apoptosis in LNCaP and non-apoptotic cell death in DU145 and PC3 cells. Increased sensitivity to cell death mediated by the Doc or 2ME2 + BA combination is likely due to increased NF-kappaB activity.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that the combination of antimitotic drugs with NF-kappaB inhibitors will have antagonistic effects in a common type of PC cell typical of LNCaP. However, combination strategies utilizing antimitotic drugs with BA, an activator of NF-kappaB, will universally enhance cell death in PC cells, notably in the aggressive, castration-resistant variety that does not respond to conventional therapies.""","""['Ricardo Parrondo', 'Alicia de las Pozas', 'Teresita Reiner', 'Priyamvada Rai', 'Carlos Perez-Stable']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Betulinic Acid-Mediated Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer Cells Involves p53 and Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Pathways.', 'Low dose combinations of 2-methoxyestradiol and docetaxel block prostate cancer cells in mitosis and increase apoptosis.', 'Betulinic acid suppresses constitutive and TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and induces apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells.', 'Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB contributes to induction of death receptors and apoptosis by the synthetic retinoid CD437 in DU145 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Melatonin Inhibits Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 (AR-V7)-Induced Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Activation and NF-κB Activator-Induced AR-V7 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells: Potential Implications for the Use of Melatonin in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Therapy.', 'Additive Interactions between Betulinic Acid and Two Taxanes in In Vitro Tests against Four Human Malignant Melanoma Cell Lines.', 'The NF-κB Nucleolar Stress Response Pathway.', 'Enhancement of Neuroblastoma NK-Cell-Mediated Lysis through NF-kB p65 Subunit-Induced Expression of FAS and PVR, the Loss of Which Is Associated with Poor Patient Outcome.', 'Combination Treatment With Inhibitors of ERK and Autophagy Enhances Antitumor Activity of Betulinic Acid in Non-small-Cell Lung Cancer In Vivo and In Vitro.', 'Radiation Resistance: A Matter of Transcription Factors.']"""

In this article, we propose a two-stage procedure to make inferences about such subject-specific profiles.

We then estimate consistently the average competing risks for subjects who have the same parametric index score via a nonparametric function estimation procedure.

Several studies have provided evidence that, besides their pituitary effects, GnRH analogs may exert direct antiproliferative effects on tumor cells. To study the effect of modifications in positions 4 and 6 of leuprolide on prostate cancer cell proliferation, we synthesized 12 new leuprolide analogs. All GnRH analogs lacked the carboxy-terminal Gly10-amide of GnRH, and an ethylamide residue was added to Pro9. Gly6 was substituted by DLys, Nepsilon-modified DLys, Glu, and DGlu. To improve the enzymatic stability, NMeSer was incorporated in position 4, and the rate of hydrolysis by alpha-chymotrypsin and subtilisin was investigated. Our results demonstrate that this incorporation increases enzymatic stability in all analogs of GnRH, whereas the antiproliferative effect on PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells is similar to that of leuprolide. Conformational studies were performed to elucidate structural changes occurring on substitution of native residues and to study structure-activity relationship for these analogs.

However, the use of PSMA for detecting circulating prostate tumor cells remains under-explored. The present study focuses on the specific labeling of PSMA+ prostate cancer cells with a fluorescent PSMA inhibitor and the quantitation of PSMA+ cells in blood by flow cytometry (FC) using a gating strategy to separate labeled PSMA+ cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Methods:   Suspensions of PSMA+ (LNCaP) and PSMA- (DU145) cells were incubated with the fluorescent PSMA inhibitor FAMX-CTT-54. Incubation parameters (time, temperature, and label concentration) were varied to optimize cell labeling. A gating protocol based on double fluorescent labeling of CD45 and PSMA was developed for the quantitiation of LNCaP cells in the presence of white blood cells from bovine blood. Nonfluorescent beads were added to the labeled cell mixture and served as internal standard for precise cellular quantification of LNCaP cells by flow cytometry.  Results:   The fluorescent PSMA inhibitor FAMX-CTT-54 was specific for PSMA+ cells. The minimum time and concentration of FAMX-CTT-54 for effective labeling of PSMA+ cell suspensions at 37°C was 7.5 min and 35 nM, respectively; no labeling was observed on PSMA- cells. Co-incubation or pre-incubation of PSMA+ cells with the unlabeled PSMA inhibitor CTT-54 resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in fluorescent labeling with FAMX-CTT-54 thereby confirming that the labeling was specific for PSMA. In blood samples in which LNCaP cells were added, an average of five cells were detected in a 115 µl sample of the most dilute sample examined (29 cells/ml); three cells were expected theoretically. The greater loss of labeling of PSMA+ cells with FAMX-CTT-54 when pre-incubated with CTT-54 is consistent with the irreversible mode of binding of CTT-54 to PSMA and subsequent internalization of the PSMA-inhibitor complex.  Conclusions:   The results suggest that fluorescent PSMA inhibitors can be utilized to effectively detect and quantify PSMA+ cells by FC. These results support the use of such compounds in the application of FC to detect, quantify, and characterize circulating prostate tumor cells.""","""['Lisa Y Wu', 'Tiancheng Liu', 'Amanda L Grimm', 'William C Davis', 'Clifford E Berkman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Chemoaffinity capture of pre-targeted prostate cancer cells with magnetic beads.', 'Cell-Surface labeling and internalization by a fluorescent inhibitor of prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Spacer length effects on in vitro imaging and surface accessibility of fluorescent inhibitors of prostate specific membrane antigen.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a Tailor-Made DOTA-Conjugated PSMA Inhibitor with Optimized Linker Moiety for Imaging and Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Imaging of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Using 18FDCFPyL.', '177Lu-Labeled Phosphoramidate-Based PSMA Inhibitors: The Effect of an Albumin Binder on Biodistribution and Therapeutic Efficacy in Prostate Tumor-Bearing Mice.', 'Circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer diagnosis and monitoring: an appraisal of clinical potential.', 'Biochemical characterization of prostate-specific membrane antigen from canine prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Isolation and characterization of circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer.', 'Chemoaffinity capture of pre-targeted prostate cancer cells with magnetic beads.']"""

In this report, we set out to determine whether the evaluation of multiple antigenic targets would allow the identification of a subset of antigens that are common immunologic targets in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using a phage immunoblot approach, we evaluated IgG responses in patients with prostate cancer (n = 126), patients with chronic prostatitis (n = 45), and men without prostate disease (n = 53).  Results:   We found that patients with prostate cancer or prostatitis have IgG specific for multiple common antigens. A subset of 23 proteins was identified to which IgG were detected in 38% of patients with prostate cancer and 33% patients with prostatitis versus 6% of controls (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). Responses to multiple members were not higher in patients with advanced disease, suggesting antibody immune responses occur early in the natural history of cancer progression.

This is mediated, in part, through down-regulation of c-Myc, a positive regulator of the transcription factor, E2F. There is evidence that prostate cancer cells lacking functional retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a negative regulator of E2F activity, are poorly responsive to 1,25D treatment. Since up to 60% of prostate cancers demonstrate a loss of heterozygosity for Rb, we sought to determine whether Rb is required for the growth inhibitory effects of 1,25D.  Methods:   Using siRNA, Rb was reduced in C4-2 prostate cancer cells, and the response of cells to 1,25D treatment or depletion of c-myc measured by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation and flow cytometry. The effects of 1,25D treatment on E2F levels and activity, and E2F target gene expression were also measured.  Results:   1,25D treatment and c-Myc depletion both cause a G(1) arrest inhibiting C4-2 cell proliferation independently of Rb. 1,25D reduces c-Myc expression and causes a decrease in E2F and E2F target genes. Bcl-2, an E2F target and positive regulator of C4-2 cell growth, also is down-regulated by 1,25D independently of Rb.

It has been suggested a topographic relation and a potential of the proliferative epithelium in PIA to progress to HGPIN and/or CA. The aim of this study was to analyze in radical prostatectomies a possible topographic relation of the lesions.  Materials and methods:   A total of 3,186 quadrants from 100 whole-mount consecutive surgical specimens were examined. The frequency of quadrants showing: only PIA, PIA+CA, PIA+HGPIN, or PIA+HGPIN+CA was determined. Extent and distance between the lesions were evaluated by a semiquantitative point-count method previously described. We also studied foci with partial or complete atrophy without inflammation. The statistical methods included the Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney tests and the Spearman correlation coefficient.  Results:   The mean (range) of quadrants showing only PIA, PIA+CA, PIA+HGPIN, and PIA+HGPIN+CA was 3.29 (0-21), 2.51 (0-11), 0.77 (0-6), and 0.44 (0-4), respectively (P < 0.01). Most of the foci of PIA were significantly located in a distance >5 than <5 mm from HGPIN or CA. There was no significant correlation between extent of PIA (P = 0.64, r = 0.05) with extent of HGPIN. There was a significant negative correlation of extent of PIA (P = 0.01, r = -0.27) with extent of CA. Similar results were found considering foci either with or without inflammation. Chronic inespecific inflammation was not seen in foci of partial atrophy.  Conclusion:   A topographic relation of PIA to HGPIN and/or CA was not supported by our study.""","""['Antonio A Brasil', 'Wagner J Favaro', 'Valeria H Cagnon', 'Ubirajara Ferreira', 'Athanase Billis']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Morphological transition of proliferative inflammatory atrophy to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer in human prostate.', 'Clinical significance of proliferative inflammatory atrophy finding in prostatic biopsies.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and topographical distribution in 1,374 prostatectomy specimens: existence of HGPIN near prostate cancer.', 'Clinical significance of proliferative inflammatory atrophy in prostate biopsy.', 'High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia with squamous differentiation.', 'The combination of histological prostate atrophy and inflammation is associated with lower risk of prostate cancer in biopsy specimens.', 'Topographic and quantitative relationship between prostate inflammation, proliferative inflammatory atrophy and low-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia: a biopsy study in chronic prostatitis patients.']"""

However, few results have been replicated with statistical significance. One exception is chromosome 22q, for which five independent linkage studies yielded strong evidence for a susceptibility locus in HPC families. Previously, we refined this region to a 2.53 Mb interval, using recombination mapping in 42 linked pedigrees. We now refine this locus to a 15 kb interval, spanning Apolipoprotein L3 (APOL3), using family-based association analyses of 150 total prostate cancer (PC) cases from two independent family collections with 506 unrelated population controls. Analysis of the two independent sets of PC cases highlighted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the APOL3 locus showing the strongest associations with HPC risk, with the most robust results observed when all 150 cases were combined. Analysis of 15 tagSNPs across the 5' end of the locus identified six SNPs with P-values < or =2 × 10(-4). The two independent sets of HPC cases highlight the same 15 kb interval at the 5' end of the APOL3 gene and provide strong evidence that SNPs within this 15 kb interval, or in strong linkage disequilibrium with it, contribute to HPC risk. Further analyses of this locus in an independent population-based, case-control study revealed an association between an SNP within the APOL3 locus and PC risk, which was not confirmed in the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility data set. This study further characterizes the 22q locus in HPC risk and suggests that the role of this region in sporadic PC warrants additional studies.""","""['Bo Johanneson', 'Shannon K McDonnell', 'Danielle M Karyadi', 'Pascale Quignon', 'Laura McIntosh', 'Shaun M Riska', 'Liesel M FitzGerald', 'Gregory Johnson', 'Kerry Deutsch', 'Gabrielle Williams', 'Lori S Tillmans', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Daniel J Schaid', 'Stephen N Thibodeau', 'Elaine A Ostrander']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['Association between two unlinked loci at 8q24 and prostate cancer risk among European Americans.', 'Genome-wide linkage analyses of hereditary prostate cancer families with colon cancer provide further evidence for a susceptibility locus on 15q11-q14.', 'Fine mapping of familial prostate cancer families narrows the interval for a susceptibility locus on chromosome 22q12.3 to 1.36 Mb.', 'Identification of Genetic Susceptibility Loci for Colorectal Tumors in a Genome-Wide Meta-analysis.', 'Hereditary prostate cancer and other genetic predispositions to prostate cancer.', 'Apolipoprotein L3 enhances CD8+ T cell antitumor immunity of colorectal cancer by promoting LDHA-mediated ferroptosis.', 'Identification of Ten-Gene Related to Lipid Metabolism for Predicting Overall Survival of Breast Invasive Carcinoma.', 'Identification of Germline Genetic Variants that Increase Prostate Cancer Risk and Influence Development of Aggressive Disease.', 'The function of apolipoproteins L (APOLs): relevance for kidney disease, neurotransmission disorders, cancer and viral infection.', 'Apolipoproteins and cancer.']"""

Methods:   Sixty-two consecutive patients with Stage 1 prostate cancer who underwent brachytherapy with (125)I seeds between February 2008 and May 2009 were studied prospectively. On post-operative days 1, 7 and 30, scintigraphy was added to conventional radiography to monitor the migration of the implanted seeds. The prostate volume was measured during the pre-planning stage using ultrasound and during the post-planning stage using computed tomography on post-operative days 0 and 30. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on day 30.  Results:   Of the 4843 seeds implanted in the prostates of 62 patients, 108 seeds (2.2%) in 43 patients (69.4%) exhibited seed migration. Thirty-five seeds could not be identified using any of the imaging modalities and were likely passed during urination (0.7% of the total number of seeds). The maximum number of migrated seeds in one patient was 10 of the 85 implanted seeds. The fraction of patients with seed migration or loss increased from 27.4% on day 1 to 69.4% on day 30. The number of seeds that had migrated from the prostate increased from 48 (0.1% of the total number of seeds) on 1 day to 78 (1.0%) on day 7 and 108 (2.2%) on day 30. Of the seeds lost from the prostate, 38.9% embolized to the lungs. The seed loss during the first post-operative month was closely correlated with the swelling of the prostate gland between the pre-planning measurement and the post-planning measurement performed on day 0 (P < 0.0001).

Methods and materials:   Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, an all-payer healthcare database representative of all U.S. hospitalizations, MSCC-related hospitalizations were identified for the period 1998-2006. Cases were combined with age-adjusted Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer death data to estimate annual incidence. Linear regression characterized trends in patient, treatment, and hospital characteristics, costs, and outcomes. Logistic regression was used to examine inpatient treatment (radiotherapy [RT], surgery, or neither) by hospital characteristics and year, adjusting for confounding.  Results:   We identified 15,367 MSCC-related cases, representing 75,876 hospitalizations. Lung cancer (24.9%), prostate cancer (16.2%), and multiple myeloma (11.1%) were the most prevalent underlying cancer diagnoses. The annual incidence of MSCC hospitalization among patients dying of cancer was 3.4%; multiple myeloma (15.0%), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (13.9%), and prostate cancer (5.5%) exhibited the highest cancer-specific incidence. Over the study period, inpatient RT for MSCC decreased (odds ratio [OR] 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.81), whereas surgery increased (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.17-1.84). Hospitalization costs for MSCC increased (5.3% per year, p < 0.001).

The ideal theranostic agent will support all three of the above functions in vivo with cellular resolution, allowing individual assessment of disease state and the elimination of diseased cells while leaving healthy cells intact. We have developed and evaluated plasmonic nanobubbles (PNBs) as an in vivo tunable theranostic cellular agent in zebrafish hosting prostate cancer xenografts. PNBs were selectively generated around gold nanoparticles in cancer cells in the zebrafish with short single laser pulses. By varying the energy of the laser pulse, we dynamically tuned the PNB size in a theranostic sequence of two PNBs: an initial small PNB detected a cancer cell through optical scattering, followed by a second bigger PNB, which mechanically ablated this cell without damage to surrounding tissue, while its optical scattering confirmed the destruction of the cell. Thus PNBs supported the diagnosis and guided ablation of individual human cancer cells in a living organism without damage to the host.""","""['Daniel S Wagner', 'Nikki A Delk', 'Ekaterina Y Lukianova-Hleb', 'Jason H Hafner', 'Mary C Farach-Carson', 'Dmitri O Lapotko']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Tunable plasmonic nanobubbles for cell theranostics.', 'Generation and detection of plasmonic nanobubbles in zebrafish.', 'Selective and self-guided micro-ablation of tissue with plasmonic nanobubbles.', 'Methods for Generation and Detection of Nonstationary Vapor Nanobubbles Around Plasmonic Nanoparticles.', 'Tunable nanostructures as photothermal theranostic agents.', 'A Preclinical Embryonic Zebrafish Xenograft Model to Investigate CAR T Cells In Vivo.', 'Optimization-by-design of hepatotropic lipid nanoparticles targeting the sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide.', 'Actein Inhibits the Proliferation and Adhesion of Human Breast Cancer Cells and Suppresses Migration in vivo.', 'The Potential of Zebrafish as a Model Organism for Improving the Translation of Genetic Anticancer Nanomedicines.', 'Quo natas, Danio?-Recent Progress in Modeling Cancer in Zebrafish.']"""

Market-driven adoption of proton therapy into routine clinical practice may have a significant economic impact. The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of patients who could potentially be treated with proton therapy by evaluating the utilization of existing highly conformal photon therapy as a proxy.  Methods:   All patients treated in 2007 with radiation therapy at the authors' institution were evaluated. Treatment technique was categorized using Current Procedural Terminology((R)) codes as conventional radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, Gamma Knife radiosurgery, stereotactic body radiation therapy, and brachytherapy. Medicare 2008 codes were used to estimate cost impact.  Results:   One thousand forty-two patients were treated using 19,749 treatment fractions. As a potential proxy for proton therapy, highly conformal external-beam photon techniques were delivered in 31% of all fractions (intensity-modulated radiation therapy in 30%, stereotactic body radiation therapy in <1%, and Gamma Knife radiosurgery in 1%). Most were used for prostate cancer (37%), gliomas (17%), and head and neck cancers (16%). Pediatric patients were a small proportion (2%) of treatments. Proton therapy, if delivered instead of highly conformal photon therapy, could increase annual cost for radiation therapy at the authors' institution by $1.3 million (22%) and require approximately 1.4 gantries to deliver.  Conclusions:   Using existing utilization patterns of highly conformal photon therapy as a proxy, approximately one-third of patients irradiated annually at the authors' institution could be treated with proton therapy, with an incremental cost of 20% across the entire treated patient population.""","""['Tomas Dvorak', 'David E Wazer']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Am Coll Radiol""","""['Number of patients potentially eligible for proton therapy.', 'Should positive phase III clinical trial data be required before proton beam therapy is more widely adopted?

Thus, down-regulation of AR signaling is commonly therapeutic for prostate cancer. The E006AA cell line was established from a hormone naïve, localized prostate cancer. E006AA cells are genetically aneuploid and grow equally well when xenografted into either intact or castrated male NOG but not nude mice. These cells exhibit: 1) X chromosome duplication and AR gene amplification, although paradoxically not coupled with increased AR expression, and 2) somatic, dominant-negative Serine-599-Glycine loss-of-function mutation within the dimerization surface of the DNA binding domain of the AR gene. No effect on the growth of E006AA cells is observed using targeted knockdown of endogenous mutant AR, ectopic expression of wild-type AR, or treatment with androgens or anti-androgens. E006AA cells represent a prototype for a newly identified subtype of prostate cancer cells that exhibit a dominant-negative AR loss-of-function in a hormonally naïve patient. Such loss-of-function eliminates AR-mediated growth suppression normally induced by normal physiological levels of androgens, thus producing a selective growth advantage for these malignant cells in hormonally naïve patients. These data highlight that loss of AR-mediated growth suppression is an independent process, and that, without additional changes, is insufficient for acquiring oncogene addiction to AR signaling. Thus, patients with prostate cancer cells harboring such AR loss-of-function mutations will not benefit from aggressive hormone or anti-AR therapies even though they express AR protein.""","""[""Jason M D'Antonio"", 'Donald J Vander Griend', 'Lizamma Antony', 'George Ndikuyeze', 'Susan L Dalrymple', 'Shahriar Koochekpour', 'John T Isaacs']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Hedgehog/Gli supports androgen signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of kinases regulating prostate cancer cell growth using an RNAi phenotypic screen.', 'TBLR1 as an androgen receptor (AR) coactivator selectively activates AR target genes to inhibit prostate cancer growth.', 'Amplification and co-regulators of androgen receptor gene in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Anticancer Imidazoacridinone C-1311 is Effective in Androgen-Dependent and Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Development of Prostate Cancer Organoid Culture Models in Basic Medicine and Translational Research.', 'The identification of a novel antibody for CD133 using human antibody phage display.', 'MEIS1 and MEIS2 Expression and Prostate Cancer Progression: A Role For HOXB13 Binding Partners in Metastatic Disease.', 'Resolving the Coffey Paradox: what does the androgen receptor do in normal vs. malignant prostate epithelial cells?']"""

However, little is known about domestic immigration and its impact on the measures of health conditions and behaviours used to develop and evaluate public health policies and programmes. The objective of this research is to compare health conditions and behaviours between domestic immigrants and established residents in Nevada, the fastest-growing state in the USA.  Methods:   The Nevada 2004-2006 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance Survey and added state residency questions were used to examine the associations between length of residence and 24 explanatory variables on health behaviours and conditions. Weighted multiple logistic regressions were used for data analyses.  Results:   Among the 8663 respondents weighted to the total Nevada population, long-term residents (5 to <10 years), compared with newcomers or short-term residents, were more likely to report fair or poor health (OR=1.98, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.40) and obesity (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.32), and to live with firearms in the home (OR=6.34, 95% CI 1.75 to 22.9). They were less likely to report having diabetes (OR=0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.96), having had an HIV test (OR=0.60 95% CI 0.41 to 0.89), having prostate cancer (OR=0.20 95% CI 0.04 to 0.93) or having had a mammogram (OR=0.41, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.70).

Previously, we have shown that paxillin, a multidomain adaptor protein, is a critical regulator of testosterone-induced MAPK-signaling during Xenopus oocyte maturation. Here we examine the nongenomic effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in prostate cancer cells, focusing on how paxillin mediates Erk signaling and downstream physiologic actions. We show that in LnCAP cells DHT functions as a growth factor that indirectly activates the EGF-receptor (EGFR) via androgen receptor binding and matrix metalloproteinase-mediated release of EGFR ligands. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of paxillin expression in androgen-dependent LnCAP cells as well as in androgen-independent PC3 cells abrogates DHT- and/or EGF-induced Erk signaling. Furthermore, EGFR-induced Erk activation requires Src-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin on tyrosines 31/118. In contrast, paxillin is not required for PKC-induced Erk signaling. However, Erk-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin on serines 83/126/130 is still needed for both EGFR and PKC-mediated cellular proliferation. Thus, paxillin serves as a specific upstream regulator of Erk in response to receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling but as a general regulator of downstream Erk actions regardless of agonist. Importantly, Erk-mediated serine phosphorylation of paxillin is also required for DHT-induced prostate-specific antigen mRNA expression in LnCAP cells as well as EGF-induced cyclin D1 mRNA expression in PC3 cells, suggesting that paxillin may regulate prostate cancer proliferation by serving as a liaison between extra-nuclear kinase signaling and intra-nuclear transcriptional signals.

Hence, changes in UGT2B17 gene expression may affect the capacity of the prostate to inactivate and eliminate male sex hormones. In this work, we identify a prevalent polymorphism, -155G/A, in the proximal promoter of the UGT2B17 gene. This polymorphism modulates UGT2B17 promoter activity, because luciferase-gene reporter constructs containing the -155A allele were 13-fold more active than those containing the -155G allele in prostate cancer LNCaP cells. The -155G/A polymorphism is contained within a putative binding site for the transcription factor Forkhead Box A1 (FOXA1). Using gene reporter, electromobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, we show that FOXA1 binds to this site and stimulates the UGT2B17 promoter. Furthermore, down-regulation of FOXA1 in LNCaP cells substantially reduces UGT2B17 mRNA levels. The binding of FOXA1 and subsequent stimulation of the UGT2B17 promoter is greatly reduced in the presence of the -155G allele compared with the -155A allele. Consonant with its capacity to be stimulated by FOXA1, the UGT2B17 -155A allele, compared with the -155G allele, is associated with higher levels of circulating androstane-3α,17β-diol glucuronide. Although the initial phases of prostate cancer are androgen-dependent and UGT2B17 inactivates androgens, there was no association of the UGT2B17 -155G/A polymorphism with prostate cancer risk.

To study the metabolism and bioactivity of green tea polyphenols in human prostate tissue, men with clinically localized prostate cancer consumed six cups of green tea (n = 8) daily or water (n = 9) for 3 to 6 weeks before undergoing radical prostatectomy. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, 4''-O-methyl EGCG (4''-MeEGCG) and EGCG were identified in comparable amounts, and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate was identified in lower amounts in prostatectomy tissue from men consuming green tea (38.9 +/- 19.5, 42.1 +/- 32.4, and 17.8 +/- 10.1 pmol/g tissue, respectively). The majority of EGCG and other green tea polyphenols were not conjugated. Green tea polyphenols were not detected in prostate tissue or urine from men consuming water preoperatively. In the urine of men consuming green tea, 50% to 60% of both (-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-epicatechin were present in methylated form with 4'-O-MeEGC being the major methylated form of (-)-epigallocatechin. When incubated with EGCG, LNCaP prostate cancer cells were able to methylate EGCG to 4''-MeEGCG. The capacity of 4''-MeEGCG to inhibit proliferation and NF-kappaB activation and induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells was decreased significantly compared with EGCG. In summary, methylated and nonmethylated forms of EGCG are detectable in prostate tissue following a short-term green tea intervention, and the methylation status of EGCG may potentially modulate its preventive effect on prostate cancer, possibly based on genetic polymorphisms of catechol O-methyltransferase.""","""['Piwen Wang', 'William J Aronson', 'Min Huang', 'Yanjun Zhang', 'Ru-Po Lee', 'David Heber', 'Susanne M Henning']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Tea polyphenols and theaflavins are present in prostate tissue of humans and mice after green and black tea consumption.', 'Review: green tea polyphenols in chemoprevention of prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical studies.', 'Chemopreventive effects of tea in prostate cancer: green tea versus black tea.', 'Enhanced inhibition of prostate cancer xenograft tumor growth by combining quercetin and green tea.', 'Molecular mechanisms of green tea polyphenols.', 'Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Therapeutic Potential in Cancer: Mechanism of Action and Clinical Implications.', 'Green Tea and Benign Gynecologic Disorders: A New Trick for An Old Beverage?', 'Natural biomolecules and derivatives as anticancer immunomodulatory agents.', 'Research Trend and Detailed Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of Food Bioactive Compounds against Cancer: A Comprehensive Review with Special Emphasis on Probiotics.', 'Structural Elucidation of Novel Stable and Reactive Metabolites of Green Tea Catechins and Alkyl Gallates by LC-MS/MS.']"""

We used an in vivo bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) enhancer-trapping strategy in mice to scan a half-megabase of the 8q24 gene desert encompassing the prostate cancer-associated regions for long-range cis-regulatory elements. These BAC assays identified both prostate and mammary gland enhancer activities within the region. We demonstrate that the 8q24 cancer-associated variant rs6983267 lies within an in vivo prostate enhancer whose expression mimics that of the nearby MYC proto-oncogene. Additionally, we show that the cancer risk allele increases prostate enhancer activity in vivo relative to the non-risk allele. This allele-specific enhancer activity is detectable during early prostate development and throughout prostate maturation, raising the possibility that this SNP could assert its influence on prostate cancer risk before tumorigenesis occurs.

Patients and methods:   Prostate cancer incidence and mortality data (1980-2007) alongside treatment data (1987-2005) were obtained from the national, population-based Cancer Registry of Norway. Joinpoint regression models were fitted to age-adjusted incidence, treatment and mortality rates to identify linear changes in the trends.  Results:   Both age-adjusted incidence rates and rates of curative treatment of prostate cancer increased significantly in all five regions of Norway since the early 1990s. There was a strong positive correlation between increasing incidence and increasing use of curative treatment. The frequency of curative treatment in Western Norway was almost threefold that in the Northern and Central regions around year 2000. Subsequently, the regional trends converged and only minor differences in prostate cancer incidence and use of curative treatment were observed by 2005. The declines in mortality were observed earliest in the regions with the highest incidence and the most frequent use of curative treatment, while the largest decreases in mortality were found in counties where the largest increases in curative treatment were observed.  Conclusions:   The elucidation of the prostate cancer mortality trends is hindered by an inability to tease out the potential effects of early treatment from the more general impact of improved and more active treatment.

Results:   We initially describe heterogeneity in expression of PTEN in non-malignant prostate tissue of men deemed to be at risk of prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   Fifty-one consecutive patients with organ-confined prostate cancer underwent RARP by one of two experienced surgeons. UVA was performed in two layers, using a unidirectional barbed suture fashioned into a double-ended stitch. Perioperative outcomes and 30-day complications were recorded.  Results:   All anastomoses were performed without assistance and without tying a knot. Median time for entire dual-layer anastomosis was 14.0 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 12-20) and that for urethrovesical anastomosis was 11 minutes (IQR: 9-15). Not having to rely on an assistant to follow the suture decreased instrument clashes, entangling of the suture around an instrument, and made the anastomosis faster. Eight patients underwent anterior/lateral reconstruction of the bladder neck, and there were no leaks on cystography at 1 week.  Conclusions:   We describe the first reported clinical experience with a novel technique of performing UVA during RARP that is safe and efficient.

It also aimed to search for the genes that play key roles in the tumorigenesis of PCa, and probe into the molecular mechanism of PCa pathogenesis in Chinese men.  Methods:   The relevant domestic literature of recent years were reviewed to sum up differentially expressed genes in PCa according to the screened microarray data.

There has been an interest in examining phytochemicals, the secondary metabolites of plants, in order to determine their potential anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo. In this study we document the effects of proanthocyanidins (PACs) from the American Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in DU145 human prostate cancer cells. Cranberry PACs decreased cellular viability of DU145 cells at a concentration of 25 µg/ml by 30% after 6 h of treatment. Treatment of DU145 cells with PACs resulted in an inhibition of both MMPs 2 and 9 activity. PACs increased the expression of TIMP-2, a known inhibitor of MMP activity, and decreased the expression of EMMPRIN, an inducer of MMP expression. PACs decreased the expression of PI-3 kinase and AKT proteins, and increased the phosphorylation of both p38 and ERK1/2. Cranberry PACs also decreased the translocation of the NF-κB p65 protein to the nucleus. Cranberry PACs increased c-jun and decreased c-fos protein levels. These results suggest that cranberry PACs decreases MMP activity through the induction and/or inhibition of specific temporal MMP regulators, and by affecting either the phosphorylation status and/or expression of MAP kinase, PI-3 kinase, NF-κB and AP-1 pathway proteins. This study further demonstrates that cranberry PACs are a strong candidate for further research as novel anti-cancer agents.""","""['Bob A Déziel', 'Kunal Patel', 'Catherine Neto', 'Katherine Gottschall-Pass', 'Robert A R Hurta']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Treatment of epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 via inhibition of activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-jun and NF-kappaB in human prostate carcinoma DU-145 cells.', 'Inhibition of interleukin 1β-stimulated interleukin-6 production by cranberry components in human gingival epithelial cells: effects on nuclear factor κB and activator protein 1 activation pathways.', 'Proanthocyanidins from grape seeds inhibit expression of matrix metalloproteinases in human prostate carcinoma cells, which is associated with the inhibition of activation of MAPK and NF kappa B.', 'Cranberry proanthocyanidins: natural weapons against periodontal diseases.', 'Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of bioactive phytochemicals from cranberry.', 'Modulation of Cytoskeleton, Protein Trafficking, and Signaling Pathways by Metabolites from Cucurbitaceae, Ericaceae, and Rosaceae Plant Families.', 'Regulation of interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinases syntheses by bioflavonoids and photobiomodulation in human gingival fibroblasts.', 'HPLC/ESI-MS and NMR Analysis of Chemical Constitutes in Bioactive Extract from the Root Nodule of Vaccinium emarginatum.', 'Dietary feeding of freeze-dried whole cranberry inhibits intestinal tumor development in Apcmin/+ mice.', 'Co-supplementation of isomalto-oligosaccharides potentiates metabolic health benefits of polyphenol-rich cranberry extract in high fat diet-fed mice via enhanced gut butyrate production.']"""

Materials and methods:   This is a retrospective population-based study including all prostate cancer cases aged over 20 reported to the Singapore Cancer Registry (SCR) from 1968 to 2002 who are Singapore Chinese residents. Follow-up was ascertained by matching with the National Death Register until 2002. Metastatic status was obtained from the SCR. Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates, as well as the 5-year relative survival ratios (RSRs), were obtained for each 5-year period and grouped by metastatic stage. A weighted linear regression was performed on the log-transformed age-standardised incidence and mortality rates over the study period.  Results:   In the most recent period of 1998 to 2002, the age-standardised incidence and mortality rates (per 100,000) for prostate cancer among the Chinese were 30.9 (95% CI, 29.1 to 32.8) and 9.6 (95% CI, 8.6 to 10.7), respectively. The percentage increase in the age-standardised incidence and age-standardised mortality rates per year were 5.6% and 6.0%, respectively, for all Chinese Singapore residents. There was an improvement in the 5-year RSRs for Chinese diagnosed with non-metastatic cases from 51.3% in 1973 to 1977, to 76.1% in 1998 to 2002. However, the RSR remains poor (range, 11.1% to 49.7%) for Chinese diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Both age-standardised incidence and mortality rates for prostate cancer among Chinese Singapore residents are still on the rise especially since the 1990s.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the functional and structural impact of all known SNPs in this gene using publicly available computational prediction tools. Out of a total of 2412 SNPs in IGF1R retrieved from dbSNP, we found 32 nsSNPs, 58 sSNPs, 83 mRNA 3' UTR SNPs, and 2225 intronic SNPs. Among the nsSNPs, a total of six missense nsSNPs were found to be damaging by both a sequence homology-based tool (SIFT) and a structural homology-based method (PolyPhen), and one nonsense nsSNP was found. Further, we modeled mutant proteins and compared the total energy values with the native IGF1R protein, and showed that a mutation from arginine to cysteine at position 1216 (rs61740868) on the surface of the protein caused the greatest impact on stability. Also, the FASTSNP tool suggested that 31 sSNPs and 3 intronic SNPs might affect splicing regulation.

From the patients with record of family history, 65.4% (n=17) had relevant family history of cancer. The majority of the first malignancy diagnosed was prostate, colon, head and neck and bladder. Lung cancer was essentially the second malignancy. The mean time lag between the two diagnoses was 62.9+/-64.9 months (max. 240, min. 0), with the second cancer usually detected at an advanced stage. The mean survival of patients who had a second primary lung cancer was 8.6+/-8.24 months (max. 32, min. 1), with four patients still surviving.

CRCaP prostate cancers continue to express the AR, a pivotal prostate regulator, but it is not known whether the AR targets similar or different genes in different castrate-resistant cells. In this study, we investigated AR binding and AR-dependent transcription in two related castrate-resistant cell lines derived from androgen-dependent CWR22-relapsed tumors: CWR22Rv1 (Rv1) and CWR-R1 (R1). Expression microarray analysis revealed that R1 and Rv1 cells had significantly different gene expression profiles individually and in response to androgen. In contrast, AR chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with promoter DNA microarrays (ChIP-on-chip) studies showed that they have a similar AR-binding profile. Coupling of the microarray study with ChIP-on-chip analysis identified direct AR targets. The most prominent function of transcripts that were direct AR targets was transcriptional regulation, although only one transcriptional regulator, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein δ, was commonly regulated in both lines.

However, studies of common variation in genes involved in steroid hormone and IGF-I metabolism have yet to provide convincing evidence that such variants predict breast cancer risk. The Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) is a collaboration of large US and European cohorts. We genotyped 1416 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 37 steroid hormone metabolism genes and 24 IGF-I pathway genes in 6292 cases of breast cancer and 8135 controls, mostly Caucasian, postmenopausal women from the BPC3.

Among 770 estrogen receptor-negative cases, an SNP located 3' of growth hormone receptor (GHR) was marginally associated with increased risk after correction for multiple testing (P(trend) = 1.5 × 10(-4)). We found no significant overall associations between breast cancer and common germline variation in 61 genes involved in steroid hormone and IGF-I metabolism in this large, comprehensive study.

Patients and methods:   Between March and September 2009 we operated on five patients with early-stage prostate cancer (T1c) and a normal body mass index (<25). The procedure was carried out with a specially-designed multichannel trocar which contains two 5 mm and one 10 mm ports plus a 5 mm port placed in the left iliac fossa in order to have an adequate working angle. The first two patients received a nerve sparing radical prostatectomy.  Results:   All cases were completed successfully in a mean operative time of 225 minutes (range 210-250) with blood losses of less than 100 ml. All patients were discharged from the hospital in 3rd postoperative day and the catheter was always removed seven days from surgery. No intraoperative complications occurred. The pathological tumour stage revealed pT2bNo prostate cancer in all five cases without positive surgical margins. After a mean follow-up of 4 months (range 1-7) all patients have an undetectable prostate-specific antigen level and no postoperative early major complications. The first two patients were fully continent respectively after 3 and 8 weeks after surgery, the third patient uses one safety pad after three month from surgery. The last two patients have a moderate incontinence and are currently under rehabilitation.

This work simulated, quantified, and evaluated the thermal impact of these treatments on the rectum, pelvic bone, neurovascular bundles (NVBs), and urinary sphincters because damage to these structures can lead to complications.  Methods:   Twenty 3D anatomical models of prostate cancer patients were used with detailed bioacoustic simulations incorporating an active feedback algorithm which controlled a rotating, planar ultrasound transducer (17, 4 x 3 mm2 elements, 10 W(acoustic)/cm2). Heating of the adjacent surrounding anatomy was evaluated at 4.7, 9.7, and 14.2 MHz using thermal tolerances reported in literature.  Results:   Heating of the rectum posed the most important safety concern, influenced largely by the water temperature of an endorectal cooling device (ECD); depending on anatomy, temperatures of 7-37 degrees C were required to limit potential damage to less than 10 mm3 on the outer 1 mm layer of the rectal wall. Heating of the pelvic bone could be important at 4.7 MHz. A smaller sized ECD or a higher ultrasound frequency in sectors where the bone was less than 10 mm from the prostate reduced heating in all cases below the threshold for irreversible damage. Heating of the NVB was significant in 75% of the patient models in the absence of treatment planning; this proportion was reduced to 5% by increasing treatment margins up to 4 mm. To avoid damaging the urinary sphincters, the transducer should be positioned at least 2-4 mm from the sphincters, depending on the transurethral cooling temperature.  Conclusions:   Simulations show that MRI-guided transurethral therapy can treat the prostate accurately, but in the absence of treatment planning, some thermal impact can be predicted on the surrounding anatomy.

Shifting the patient away from skin mark alignment causes the radiation beams to pass through a patient geometry different from that planned. Yet, dose calculations on the new geometry are not commonly performed. The intention of this work was to compare the dosimetric consequences of treating the patient with and without setup correction for the common clinical scenario of prostate interfraction motion.  Methods:   In order to account for prostate motion, 32 patients initially aligned to the room lasers via skin marks were realigned under the treatment beams by shifting the treatment couch based on ultrasound image guidance. An intramodality 3D ultrasound image guidance system was used to determine the setup correction, so that errors stemming from different tissue representations on different imaging modalities were eliminated. Two scenarios were compared to the reference static treatment plan: (1) Uncorrected patient alignment and (2) corrected patient alignment. Prostate displacement statistics and the dose to the clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum are reported. Monte Carlo dose calculation methods were employed.  Results:   Comparing the uncorrected and corrected scenarios using the static treatment plan as the reference, the average percent difference in D95 for the CTV improved from -5.1% (range -40%, 1.3%) to 0.0% (-3.5%, 2.0%) and the average percent difference in V90 for the bladder and rectum changed from -11% (-84%, 232%) to -8.3% (-61%, 5.2%) and from -47% (-100%, 108%) to 0.9% (-62%, 102%), respectively. There was no simple correlation between displacement and dose discrepancy before correction. After patient realignment, the prescribed dose to the CTV was achieved within 1% for 75% (24/32) of the patients. After patient realignment, 50% of the patients had doses that differed from the static treatment plan by 25% for the bladder and 8% for the rectum.  Conclusions:   The dose degradation due to prostate motion (before correction) is not accurately predicted from the average trends for all patients. Outliers included smaller displacements that lead to larger dosimetric differences in the corrected scenario, especially for the bladder and rectum, which exhibited doses substantially different from that planned.""","""['Danielle J Fraser', 'Yong Chen', 'Emily Poon', 'Fabio L Cury', 'Tony Falco', 'Frank Verhaegen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric impact of image-guided 3D conformal radiation therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric consequences of a translational isocenter correction based on image guidance for intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) of the prostate.', 'The dosimetric impact of daily setup error on target volumes and surrounding normal tissue in the treatment of prostate cancer with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Transrectal three dimensional sonography.

Sublethal radiation damage repair during tau(d), the time between imaging and treatment, could reduce the effectiveness of the imaging dose, resulting in tumor underdosage. The theoretical magnitude of this effect was quantified using radiobiological modeling.  Methods:   The therapeutic effective dose (TED), which, if delivered using only therapeutic beams, would result in the same tumor cell survival as for both the imaging and therapeutic beams, was derived using the generalized linear-quadratic model. The correction factor P(d) by which therapeutic dose can be scaled to compensate for sublethal damage repair was also derived. TED and P(d) are dependent on alpha/beta, sublethal damage repair half-time (T(r)), imaging dose (D(I)) and dose rate (D(I)), therapeutic dose (D(T)) and dose rate (D(T)), and tau(d). TED and P(d) were calculated as a function of tau(d), and each parameter was varied independently while holding the remaining parameters at their reference values. The reference values were based on prostate cancer cells and were D(p) = D(I)+D(T) = 1.8 Gy, D(I)/D(p) = 5%, D(I) = 0.33 Gy/min, D(T) = 1.0 Gy/min, alpha/beta = 3.1 Gy, T(r) = 16 min, and tau(d) = 0 min. Estimates of the expected values of TED and P(d), (TED) and (P(d)), were calculated using tau(d) and D(T) distributions from a few thousand prostate treatment fractions.  Results:   For a typical tau(d) value of 5.0 min and all other parameters set to their reference values, TED was 0.5% lower than the prescription dose D(p). For tau(d) = 20 min and all other parameters at reference conditions, TED dropped by 5% relative to D(p) when D(I)/D(p) was 20% and by 2% relative to D(p) when alpha/beta = 1 Gy or T(r) = 5 min. TED/D(p) varied more with D(T) than D(I) when tau(d) < or = 20 min, varying by up to 1% over 0.05 < or = D(T) < or = 10 Gy/min and by less than 0.1% over 0.05 < or = D(I) < or = 2.0 Gy/min. Under the reference conditions, (TED) was lower than D(p) by 0.5%. For the extreme D(I)/D(p) = 20% and all other parameters at their reference values, setting alpha/beta = 1 Gy resulted in (TED) dropping below D(p) by 2.5% and setting T(r) = 5 min resulted in (TED) dropping below D(p) by 4%. For tumors with a T(r) of 16 min or greater and alpha/beta of 11 Gy, (TED) dropped below D(p) by 0.2% or less.  Conclusions:   For prostate tumors receiving a reasonable percentage of 5% of their total dose from imaging beams, the theoretical drop in (TED) relative to D(p) was 0.5%. This loss could be accounted for during treatment planning by scaling the therapeutic dose by the expected sublethal damage repair factor (P(d)).

Intraoperative dosimetry optimization is possible using a combination of TRUS and fluoroscopy, but requires localization of the fluoroscopy-derived seed cloud, relative to the anatomy as seen on TRUS. The authors propose to develop a method of registration of TRUS images and the implants reconstructed from fluoroscopy.  Methods:   A phantom was implanted with 48 seeds then imaged with TRUS and CT. Seeds were reconstructed from CT yielding a cloud of seeds. Fiducial-based ground-truth registration was established between the TRUS and CT. TRUS images are filtered, compounded, and registered to the reconstructed implants by using an intensity-based metric. The authors evaluated a volume-to-volume and point-to-volume registration scheme. In total, seven TRUS filtering techniques and three image similarity metrics were analyzed. The method was also tested on human subject data captured from a brachytherapy procedure.  Results:   For volume-to-volume registration, noise reduction filter and normalized correlation metrics yielded the best result: An average of 0.54 +/- 0.11 mm seed localization error relative to ground truth. For point-to-volume registration, noise reduction combined with beam profile filter and mean squares metrics yielded the best result: An average of 0.38 +/- 0.19 mm seed localization error relative to the ground truth. In human patient data, C-arm fluoroscopy images showed 81 radioactive seeds implanted inside the prostate. A qualitative analysis showed clinically correct agreement between the seeds visible in TRUS and reconstructed from intraoperative fluoroscopy imaging. The measured registration error compared to the manually selected seed locations by the clinician was 2.86 +/- 1.26 mm.

II. Pareto optimal surfaces and linear combinations of modulated blocked arcs for a prostate geometry""","""Purpose:   The purpose of this work is twofold: To further develop an approach to multiobjective optimization of rotational therapy treatments recently introduced by the authors [J. Pardo-Montero and J. D. Fenwick, ""An approach to multiobjective optimization of rotational therapy,"" Med. Phys. 36, 3292-3303 (2009)], especially regarding its application to realistic geometries, and to study the quality (Pareto optimality) of plans obtained using such an approach by comparing them with Pareto optimal plans obtained through inverse planning.  Methods:   In the previous work of the authors, a methodology is proposed for constructing a large number of plans, with different compromises between the objectives involved, from a small number of geometrically based arcs, each arc prioritizing different objectives. Here, this method has been further developed and studied. Two different techniques for constructing these arcs are investigated, one based on image-reconstruction algorithms and the other based on more common gradient-descent algorithms. The difficulty of dealing with organs abutting the target, briefly reported in previous work of the authors, has been investigated using partial OAR unblocking. Optimality of the solutions has been investigated by comparison with a Pareto front obtained from inverse planning. A relative Euclidean distance has been used to measure the distance of these plans to the Pareto front, and dose volume histogram comparisons have been used to gauge the clinical impact of these distances. A prostate geometry has been used for the study.  Results:   For geometries where a blocked OAR abuts the target, moderate OAR unblocking can substantially improve target dose distribution and minimize hot spots while not overly compromising dose sparing of the organ. Image-reconstruction type and gradient-descent blocked-arc computations generate similar results. The Pareto front for the prostate geometry, reconstructed using a large number of inverse plans, presents a hockey-stick shape comprising two regions: One where the dose to the target is close to prescription and trade-offs can be made between doses to the organs at risk and (small) changes in target dose, and one where very substantial rectal sparing is achieved at the cost of large target underdosage. Plans computed following the approach using a conformal arc and four blocked arcs generally lie close to the Pareto front, although distances of some plans from high gradient regions of the Pareto front can be greater. Only around 12% of plans lie a relative Euclidean distance of 0.15 or greater from the Pareto front. Using the alternative distance measure of Craft [""Calculating and controlling the error of discrete representations of Pareto surfaces in convex multi-criteria optimization,"" Phys. Medica (to be published)], around 2/5 of plans lie more than 0.05 from the front. Computation of blocked arcs is quite fast, the algorithms requiring 35%-80% of the running time per iteration needed for conventional inverse plan computation.  Conclusions:   The geometry-based arc approach to multicriteria optimization of rotational therapy allows solutions to be obtained that lie close to the Pareto front. Both the image-reconstruction type and gradient-descent algorithms produce similar modulated arcs, the latter one perhaps being preferred because it is more easily implementable in standard treatment planning systems. Moderate unblocking provides a good way of dealing with OARs which abut the PTV. Optimization of geometry-based arcs is faster than usual inverse optimization of treatment plans, making this approach more rapid than an inverse-based Pareto front reconstruction.""","""['Juan Pardo-Montero', 'John D Fenwick']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Investigation of effective decision criteria for multiobjective optimization in IMRT.', 'Coverage optimized planning: probabilistic treatment planning based on dose coverage histogram criteria.', 'PARETO: A novel evolutionary optimization approach to multiobjective IMRT planning.', 'Three-dimensional conformal brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Outcome-based multiobjective optimization of lymphoma radiation therapy plans.', 'Approach and assessment of automated stereotactic radiotherapy planning for early stage non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'A new strategy for volumetric-modulated arc therapy planning using AutoPlanning based multicriteria optimization for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Automated IMRT planning with regional optimization using planning scripts.']"""

Methods:   A standard CT phantom (Catphan 500) was used to evaluate the influence of iBeam evo carbon fiber couchtop on the quality of CBCT image obtained from an Elekta synergy machine. The evaluation indices were contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), spatial resolution, image uniformity, and image noise. With using the Beer-Lambert law and the energy-response function of the flat-panel imager, a method was applied to deduct the image signal of the couchtop (and the positioning devices) from each projection image of a phantom/patient, and then used all corrected projection images to reconstruct a CBCT image. The performance of the correction method was evaluated using the CBCT images of a Catphan 500 phantom, a head-and-neck cancer patient, and a prostate cancer patient.  Results:   In two phantom studies (the phantom to simulate a human head and neck and the one to simulate a human body), the CNR of the CBCT images obtained with the couchtop reduced 18.1% and 29.8%, respectively with respect to those obtained without the couchtop; meanwhile, the image uniformity reduced 16.4% and 24.1% due to the use of the carbon fiber couchtop. The couchtop also induced extra image noise (16.5% for the h&n phantom and 4.2% for the body phantom). However, CBCT imaging with the couchtop did not affect the spatial resolution. After applying the projection image correction, there was a significant improvement in CNR (by 19.5% and 25.8%), image uniformity (by 9.2% and 13.1%), and image noise (by 10.2% and 3.9%), with respect to CBCT images obtained with the couchtop.  Conclusions:   The presence of the carbon fiber couchtop and the patient positioning devices can significantly impair CBCT image quality in terms of the CNR, the image uniformity, and the image noise.

The purpose of this study is to develop a dose correction strategy in optimization that can minimize the disagreement.  Methods:   VMAT delivery is modeled using a number of static equispaced beams. Dose correction factors (C(ij)) are associated with each beam i and point j inside the region of interest. C(ij) is calculated as the ratio of dose obtained from the full scatter dose calculation over that from the partial scatter dose calculation in optimization. VMAT optimization algorithm is a multiple resolution approach. The dose correction factors are calculated at the beginning of each resolution and applied as multiplicative corrections to the partial scatter dose during optimization. Clinical cases for brain, prostate, paraspinal, and esophagus are utilized to evaluate the method. Treatment plans created with and without the correction scheme are normalized such that the complication rates of organs at risk (OARs) are comparable. The resulting planning target volume (PTV) mean doses are used to compare plan quality.  Results:   The difference between the dose calculated at the end of optimization and at the end of the final forward dose calculation is reduced from 7% and 5% for the PTV and OAR mean doses without correction to approximately 1% with correction. Applying dose correction during optimization saves planners 2-4 h in average in treatment planning, and has a positive impact on plan quality, evidenced by a noticeably higher PTV mean dose: 2.1%, 2.4%, 0.5%, and 9.3% of the corresponding prescription dose in the brain, esophagus, prostate, and paraspinal cases, respectively.  Conclusions:   When dose correction is applied during optimization, dose discrepancies between optimization and full dose calculation are reduced. Integrating dose correction in VMAT optimization allows planners to adjust the optimization constraints more easily and confidently during optimization and has the potential to improve plan quality.""","""['Pengpeng Zhang', 'Jie Yang', 'Margie Hunt', 'Gig Mageras']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Determination of action thresholds for electromagnetic tracking system-guided hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy using volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'An approach to multiobjective optimization of rotational therapy.

In this study, we investigated the ability of a nanosensor array to discriminate between breath VOCs that characterise healthy states and the most widespread cancer states in the developed world: lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers.  Methods:   Exhaled alveolar breath was collected from 177 volunteers aged 20-75 years (patients with lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancers and healthy controls). Breath from cancerous subjects was collected before any treatment. The healthy population was healthy according to subjective patient's data. The breath of volunteers was examined by a tailor-made array of cross-reactive nanosensors based on organically functionalised gold nanoparticles and gas chromatography linked to the mass spectrometry technique (GC-MS).  Results:   The results showed that the nanosensor array could differentiate between 'healthy' and 'cancerous' breath, and, furthermore, between the breath of patients having different cancer types. Moreover, the nanosensor array could distinguish between the breath patterns of different cancers in the same statistical analysis, irrespective of age, gender, lifestyle, and other confounding factors. The GC-MS results showed that each cancer could have a unique pattern of VOCs, when compared with healthy states, but not when compared with other cancer types.

In this study we investigate Mcm5 as a urinary biomarker for prostate cancer detection.  Methods:   Urine was obtained from 88 men with prostate cancer and from two control groups negative for malignancy. A strictly normal cohort included 28 men with complete, normal investigations, no urinary calculi and serum PSA <2 ng ml(-1). An expanded control cohort comprised 331 men with a benign final diagnosis, regardless of PSA level. Urine was collected before and after prostate massage in the cancer patient cohort. An immunofluorometric assay was used to measure Mcm5 levels in urine sediments.  Results:   The Mcm5 test detected prostate cancer with 82% sensitivity (confidence interval (CI)= 72-89%) and with a specificity ranging from 73 (CI=68-78%) to 93% (CI=76-99%).

It has been shown that cancerous prostate tissue has significantly different electrical properties when compared to benign tissues. Based on these electrical property findings, a transrectal electrical impedance tomography (TREIT) system is proposed as a novel prostate imaging modality. The TREIT system comprises an array of electrodes interfaced with a clinical transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe. We evaluate this imaging system through a series of phantom imaging experiments to assess the system's ability to image high and low contrast objects at various positions. We found that the TREIT system can easily discern high contrast inclusions of 1 cm in diameter at distances centered at two times the radius of the TREIT probe away from the probe surface.

However, in a cell line-dependent manner, overexpression of PIM1 can inhibit cell and tumor growth. In 22Rv1 human prostate cells, but not in Du145 or RWPE-2, PIM1 overexpression was associated with marked increases in cellular senescence, as shown by changes in the levels of beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal), p21, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 mRNA and protein. During early cell passages, PIM1 induced cellular polyploidy. As the passage number increased, markers of DNA damage, including the level of gammaH2AX and CHK2 phosphorylation, were seen. Coincident with these DNA damage markers, the level of p53 protein and genes transcriptionally activated by p53, such as p21, TP53INP1, and DDIT4, increased. In these 22Rv1 cells, the induction of p53 protein was associated not only with senescence but also with a significant level of apoptosis. The importance of the p53 pathway to PIM1-driven cellular senescence was further shown by the observation that expression of dominant-negative p53 or shRNA targeting p21 blocked the PIM1-induced changes in the DNA damage response and increases in SA-beta-Gal activity. Likewise, in a subcutaneous tumor model, PIM1-induced senescence was rescued when the p53-p21 pathways are inactivated. Based on these results, PIM1 will have its most profound effects on tumorigenesis in situations where the senescence response is inactivated.""","""['Marina Zemskova', 'Michael B Lilly', 'Ying-Wei Lin', 'Jin H Song', 'Andrew S Kraft']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Cooperation between p21 and Akt is required for p53-dependent cellular senescence.', 'Knockdown of CDK2AP1 in primary human fibroblasts induces p53 dependent senescence.', 'Senescence sensitivity of breast cancer cells is defined by positive feedback loop between CIP2A and E2F1.', 'Why target PIM1 for cancer diagnosis and treatment?', 'Ionizing radiation-induced responses in human cells with differing TP53 status.', 'The landscape of human tissue and cell type specific expression and co-regulation of senescence genes.', 'c-MYC and p53 expression highlight starry-sky pattern as a favourable prognostic feature in R-CHOP-treated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.', 'Redd1 knockdown prevents doxorubicin-induced cardiac senescence.', 'The Oncogene PIM1 Contributes to Cellular Senescence by Phosphorylating Staphylococcal Nuclease Domain-Containing Protein 1 (SND1).', 'Pim1 promotes cell proliferation and regulates glycolysis via interaction with MYC in ovarian cancer.']"""

Methods:   This retrospective study included 53 patients with advanced prostate cancer initially treated with androgen deprivation monotherapy alone. An antiandrogen was added to androgen deprivation monotherapy as the second-line treatment after the failure of the initial androgen deprivation monotherapy. Another antiandrogen, estrogen or steroid was given as the third-line treatment after the second-line treatment failed.  Results:   The initial androgen deprivation monotherapy was effective in all 53 patients for a median of 9.6 months. Thirty-three (62.3%) patients showed a prostate-specific antigen response to the second-line treatment for a median of 10.7 months. Of the 46 patients who received the third-line treatment, 16 (34.8%) showed a prostate-specific antigen response for a median of 6.0 months. Patients who responded to the second-line treatment had a significantly higher cancer-specific survival rate than those without a response. In multivariate analysis, a nadir prostate-specific antigen of 4.0 ng/ml or greater during androgen deprivation monotherapy and prostate-specific antigen doubling time of less than 10 months after androgen deprivation monotherapy failure were independent risk factors for prostate cancer death after androgen deprivation monotherapy failure, with hazards ratios of 5.59 and 8.00, respectively.

Methods and materials:   A total of 20 consecutive prostate cancer patients, treated with curative external beam radiotherapy, were included. Four fiducial GMs were implanted in the prostate. Positioning was verified according to the shift in BA and GMs on daily electronic portal images. Position corrections were determined using on- and off-line position verification protocols according to the position of the GMs (GM-on and GM-off) and BA (BA-off). For all patients, intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans were made for the GM (8-mm planning target volume margin) and BA (10-mm planning target volume margin) protocols. The dose distribution was recomputed on 11 repeat computed tomography scans to estimate the accumulated dose to the prostate and anorectal wall while considering internal organ motion.  Results:   The dose that is at least received by 99% of the prostate was, on average, acceptable for all protocols. The individual patient data showed the best coverage for both GM protocols, with >95% of the prescribed dose for all patients. The anorectal wall dose was significantly lower for the GM protocols.

We report on a group of patients at a median follow-up of 13.9 years after salvage radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   From 1990 to 1995, 92 patients were referred postoperatively for radiation for a rising PSA level. PSA level at the time of referral ranged from 0.1 to 30.5 ng/ml (median, 1.5 ng/ml). The median time from surgery to radiation was 2.1 years (range,, 0.3-7.4 years). Radiation was directed to the prostatic fossa only with a median dose of 6,500 cGy (range, 6,000-7,000 cGy).  Results:   Eighty-five patients experienced a PSA drop after radiation, as predicted by Gleason score and PSA level at the start of radiation. Five- and 10-year biochemical failure free survival (BFFS) was 35% and 26%, respectively, and overall survival was 86% and 67%, respectively. Median survival was 12.0 years, and median BFF was 2.3 years. The presurgery PSA level was not predictive, but the PSA level at the start of radiation predicted a response. Patients with Gleason 8 to 9 cancers had a significantly higher progression rate than those with lower Gleason scores. There were no significant differences in outcomes based on pathology findings (none vs. positive margins vs. positive seminal vesicles). Overall, 22 (24%) patients died directly from prostate cancer, resulting in a 10-year cancer-specific survival rate of 82%. Multivariate analysis risk factors for dying of cancer were Gleason's score (8 to 9) and PSA at the start of radiation therapy (>1.0 ng/ml).

Of the 112 patients, 15 were considered low risk, 29 intermediate risk, and 68 as high risk. The prescribed dose was uniformly 54 Gy in nine fractions within 5 days. Of the 112 patients, 94 also received hormonal therapy. The median follow-up time was 5.4 years.  Results:   All the patients safely completed the treatment regimen. The 5-year prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure-free, local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rate was 83%, 97%, 87%, and 96%, respectively.

Methods and materials:   A variety of clinical and treatment factors were examined in 820 patients who had a minimum of 3 years of PSA follow-up with T1-T2cN0M0 prostate cancer. Four different PSA threshold values were used for defining a PSA bounce: a PSA rise of ≥ 0.2, ≥ 0.4, ≥ 0.6, and ≥ 0.8 ng/mL.  Results:   A PSA bounce of ≥ 0.2, ≥ 0.4, ≥ 0.6, and ≥ 0.8 ng/mL was noted in 247 patients (30.1%), 161 (19.6%), 105 (12.8%), and 78 (9.5%), respectively.

Methods and materials:   Prostate position after online correction was measured during dose delivery using simultaneous kV fluoroscopy and posttreatment CBCT in 572 fractions to 30 patients. We reconstructed the dose distribution to the clinical tumor volume (CTV) using a convolution of the static dose with a probability density function (PDF) based on the kV fluoroscopy, and we calculated the minimum dose received by 99% of the CTV (D(99)). We compared reconstructed doses when the convolution was performed per beam, per patient, and when the PDF was created using posttreatment CBCT. We determined the minimum axis-specific margins to limit CTV D(99) reduction to 1%.  Results:   For 3-mm margins, D(99) reduction was ≤5% for 29/30 patients. Using post-CBCT rather than localizations at treatment delivery exaggerated dosimetric effects by ~47%, while there was no such bias between the dose convolved with a beam-specific and patient-specific PDF. After eight fractions, final cumulative D(99) could be predicted with a root mean square error of <1%.

A well-balanced population of patients was investigated to assess the effect of the tumor location on the accuracy of the technique.  Methods and materials:   Range verification was achieved by comparing the measured positron emission tomography activity distributions with the corresponding Monte Carlo-simulated distributions. Observed differences in the distal end of the activity distributions were analyzed as potential indicators for the range differences between the actual delivered and planned dose.  Results:   The average spatial agreement between the measured and simulated activity distribution was within ±3 mm, and the corresponding average absolute agreement was within ±45% (derived from gamma index analysis). The mean absolute range deviation at 93 randomly chosen positions in 17 treatment fields delivered to 11 patients was 3.6 mm. Characteristic differences in the agreement of the measured and simulated activity distribution for the different tumor/target sites were found. This resulted from the different effect of factors such as biologic washout effects, motion, or limitations in the Monte Carlo-simulated activity patterns.

Methods:   Retrospectively investigated the history of drug treatment in 1029 cases of BPH in patients from February 1998 to December 2004. According to the history of drug use, the patients were divided into 4 groups: finasteride group, alpha-receptor inhibitor group, finasteride and alpha-receptor inhibitor combination group and control group (untreated group). We gathered pathology sections of patients in all groups, and gave Gleason Score to each. The difference of incidence and pathology grading of prostate cancer were analyzed by Stata 7.0.

Several studies suggest that the beta-catenin signal pathway may play an important role in EMT. However, there is no direct evidence showing that this pathway actually determines the EMT induced by exogenous signal. Our previous study has successfully proved that over-expression of HIF-1alpha could induce EMT in LNCaP cells, but not in PC-3. So the present study was intended to indicate that the signal of HIF-1alpha for inducing prostate cancer cell to undergo EMT might pass through the beta-catenin pathway.  Methods:   Firstly, we analyzed the expression of HIF-1alpha and its target proteins in LNCaP/HIF1alpha and PC-3/HIF1alpha by Western blot. And then EMT-associated proteins were detected by Western blot. Furthermore the potency of invasiveness and proliferation of several cell lines were evaluated by transwell and MTT assay. Lastly the expressions of beta-catenin and GSK-3beta in these cells were analyzed by Western blot and RT-PCR.  Results:   HIF-1alpha, Glut-1 and VEGF were highly expressed in LNCaP/HIF1alpha and PC-3/HIF1alpha. And PC-3, LNCaP and PC-3/HIF1alpha were EMT-negative cell lines whereas LNCaP/HIF1alpha and IA8 had undergone EMT process. LNCaP/HIF1alpha, IA8 and PC-3/HIF1alpha exhibited a much stronger potency of invasiveness and proliferation than those of PC-3 and LNCaP. The protein levels of total GSK-3beta and phospho-GSK-3beta in LNCaP/HIF1alpha, IA8 and PC-3/HIF1alpha cells significantly decreased; however, the relative ratios of p-GSK3beta/t-GSK3beta increased. Consistently, beta-catenin protein expression increased in LNCaP/HIF1alpha and IA8 cells, but not in PC-3/HIF1alpha; RT-PCR confirmed these results, except for an enhanced transcription activity of beta-catenin mRNA in PC-3/HIF1alpha.  Conclusion:   The activation of the beta-catenin signaling pathway correlates with the characteristic of EMT and potency of invasiveness and proliferation. And it may be one critical factor directly controlling the process of EMT induced by HIF-1alpha in prostate cancer.""","""['Yong Luo', 'Da-lin He', 'Yong-guang Jiang', 'Liang Ning', 'Shu-lin Shen', 'Jia-hui Zhao', 'Xin-hao Cui']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi""","""['Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostatecancer cells.', 'Over-expression of HIF-1alpha induces EMT of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer progression: a crucial role for the endothelin axis.', 'HIF1α expression under normoxia in prostate cancer--which pathways to target?', 'Downregulation of esophageal cancer-related gene 4 promotes proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

The five SSTR subtypes (SSTR1 to 5) were evaluated immunohistochemically in the secretory cells of normal-looking epithelium (Nep), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and PCa in 20 radical prostatectomies (RPs) with Gleason score 3+3=6 acinar PCa; 20 RPs with GS 4+4=8 and 4+5=9 PCa; and 20 RPs with PCa with NE differentiation. The basal cells were evaluated in Nep and HGPIN. In all groups the stromal smooth muscle and endothelial cells were also analyzed. Concerning the secretory cells, (i) the greatest mean proportions of cells with strong cytoplasmic staining in PCa were seen for SSTR2, mainly in the group of RP with NE differentiation, and for SSTR4 in all three groups; the mean values in HGPIN were intermediate between Nep and PCa; (ii) Membrane staining was seen for SSTR3 and SSTR4; the mean percentages of positive cells, higher in SSTR3 than in SSTR4, decreased from Nep to HGPIN and PCa in all three RP groups; in the latter two, the mean percentages were similar; and (iii) Nuclear staining was seen with SSTR4 and SSTR5; for SSTR4, the mean percentages in the PCa of the three groups were higher than in HGPIN and Nep, the highest proportion being with PCa with NE differentiation. Concerning the basal cells, in Nep the mean proportions of cells with strong staining intensity were greater for SSTR1 and SSTR3 than for the other subtypes, the lowest being with SSTR2; in HGPIN the highest mean propositions of positive cells was with SSTR3, the proportions in the three RP groups being similar. Concerning the stromal smooth muscle and endothelial cells, the highest mean values being in SSTR1 and the lowest in SSTR5; for the former subtype the highest proportion of endothelial cells with strong intensity was seen in the RP NE group. In conclusion, this immunohistochemical study expands our knowledge on the expression and localization of five SSTRs in the various tissue components in the prostate with PCa with NE differentiation, compared with conventional PCa.

Minimizing patient morbidity and cost by avoiding separate surgical procedures is advantageous, provided technical feasibility, and safety data. Our goal was to assess the feasibility and safety of single-setting robotic renal surgery and prostatectomy. We present our initial experience.  Purpose:   To assess the feasibility and safety of single-setting concurrent robot-assisted renal surgery and radical prostatectomy utilizing the same port access scheme.  Patients and methods:   From February 2009 to June 2009, we performed single-setting concurrent robot-assisted radical nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy on two patients with synchronous kidney tumors and prostate cancer. Identical port sites were used during both aspects of the procedure with the exception of one additional port during prostatectomy. Prostate cancer clinical stage and Gleason scores were T1c and 6 and T2a and 7, respectively. Corresponding renal tumors were 5 cm, respectively.  Results:   Both operations were performed, with no conversion to open surgery. There were no intraoperative complications and the postoperative course was uneventful in both patients. Discharge was on postoperative day 2 and 3, respectively. Patient 2 had an episode of delayed bleeding on postoperative day 9, treated by selective angio-embolization. Mean operative time for nephrectomy and prostatectomy (135 and 139 minutes, respectively) and estimated blood loss (75 and 100 mL, respectively) were reasonable. We began with the renal portion utilizing a lateral decubitus position before re-positioning into the lithotomy position for the prostatic portion. Clamping time was 34 minutes during partial nephrectomy.  Conclusion:   Single-setting robotic radical/partial nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy is technically feasible and safe in properly selected patients who present with synchronous primary renal and prostate malignancies.""","""['Nicholas Boncher', 'Gino Vricella', 'Graham Greene', 'Rabii Madi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Simultaneous Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy.', 'Multiquadrant Combined Robotic Radical Prostatectomy And Left Partial Nephrectomy: A Combined procedure by A Single Approach.', 'A novel robotic system for single-port urologic surgery: first clinical investigation.', ""Comparison of laparoscopic versus robotic assisted partial nephrectomy: one surgeon's initial experience."", 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: conventional and robotic.', 'Combined Open Prostatectomy and Kidney Surgery: Feasibility and 12-Month Outcome.', 'Combined Robotic Surgery for Double Renal Masses and Prostate Cancer: Myth or Reality?', 'Synchronous abdominal tumors: is combined laparoscopic surgery in a single approach a safe option?', 'Simultaneous robot-assisted laparoendoscopic single-site partial nephrectomy and standard radical prostatectomy.', 'Initial clinical experience of simultaneous robot-assisted bilateral partial nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy.']"""

Recent studies suggest that these activities are due to the generation of constitutively active AR splice variants, but the mechanisms by which these splice variants could mediate such effects are not fully understood. Here we have identified what we believe to be a novel human AR splice variant in which exons 5, 6, and 7 are deleted (ARv567es) and demonstrated that this variant can contribute to cancer progression in human prostate cancer xenograft models in mice following castration. We determined that, in human prostate cancer cell lines, ARv567es functioned as a constitutively active receptor, increased expression of full-length AR (ARfl), and enhanced the transcriptional activity of AR. In human xenografts, human prostate cancer cells transfected with ARv567es cDNA formed tumors that were resistant to castration. Furthermore, the ratio of ARv567es to ARfl expression within the xenografts positively correlated with resistance to castration. Importantly, we also detected ARv567es frequently in human prostate cancer metastases. In summary, these data indicate that constitutively active AR splice variants can contribute to the development of castration-resistant prostate cancers and may serve as biomarkers for patients who are likely to suffer from early recurrence and are candidates for therapies directly targeting the AR rather than ligand.""","""['Shihua Sun', 'Cynthia C T Sprenger', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Kathleen Haugk', 'Kathryn Soriano', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Stephanie T Page', 'Ilsa M Coleman', 'Holly M Nguyen', 'Huiying Sun', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Stephen R Plymate']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Prostate cancer: New insight into mechanisms of castration resistance.', 'Vav3 enhances androgen receptor splice variant activity and is critical for castration-resistant prostate cancer growth and survival.', 'Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Growth Inhibition by Testosterone in an Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-Driven Prostate Cancer Model.', 'Androgen receptor variant-driven prostate cancer: clinical implications and therapeutic targeting.', 'Androgen receptor variants in prostate cancer.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Niclosamide Analogs as Therapeutic Agents for Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC7 inhibits androgen receptor and suppresses prostate cancer.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Using the AR-V7 biomarker to determine treatment in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, a feasibility randomised control trial, conclusions from the VARIANT trial version 2; peer review: 2 approved.', 'Co-expression and clinical utility of AR-FL and AR splice variants AR-V3, AR-V7 and AR-V9 in prostate cancer.']"""

Here, we determined the effect of SY supplementation on global serum protein expression in healthy men to provide new insights into the mechanism of selenium chemoprevention; such proteins may also serve as biomarkers of disease progression.  Methods:   Serum samples from 36 adult men were obtained from our previous SY clinical trial, 9 months after supplementation with either SY (247 microg/d; n = 17) or placebo (nonenriched yeast; n = 19).  Results:   Proteomic profiling using two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed a total of 1,496 candidate proteins, of which, 11 were differentially expressed in the SY group as compared with placebo. Eight proteins were upregulated [clusterin isoform 1 (CLU), transthyretin, alpha-1B-glycoprotein, transferrin, complement component 4B proprotein, isocitrate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, and keratin 1] and three proteins were downregulated [alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), angiotensin precursor, and albumin precursor] by SY. All of the identified proteins were redox-sensitive or involved in the regulation of redox status. Because both AAT and CLU have been previously linked to PCa development, their identities were confirmed by two-dimensional Western blot analysis.  Conclusions:   We identified AAT and CLU as potential candidate proteins involved in the mechanism of PCa prevention by SY. Collectively, proteins identified in this study might serve as potential new biomarkers for monitoring and comparing responses to selenium-based chemopreventive agents.

Intraoperative localization of the implanted seeds provides potential for dose evaluation and optimization during therapy. A reduced-dimensionality matching algorithm for prostate brachytherapy seed reconstruction (REDMAPS) that uses multiple X-ray fluoroscopy images obtained from different poses is proposed. The seed reconstruction problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, and REDMAPS finds a solution in a clinically acceptable amount of time using dimensionality reduction to create a smaller space of possible solutions. Dimensionality reduction is possible since the optimal solution has approximately zero cost when the poses of the acquired images are known to be within a small error. REDMAPS is also formulated to address the ""hidden seed problem"" in which seeds overlap on one or more observed images. REDMAPS uses a pruning algorithm to avoid unnecessary computation of cost metrics and the reduced problem is solved using linear programming. REDMAPS was first evaluated and its parameters tuned using simulations. It was then validated using five phantom and 21 patient datasets. REDMAPS was successful in reconstructing the seeds with an overall seed matching rate above 99% and a reconstruction error below 1 mm in less than 5 s.""","""['Junghoon Lee', 'Christian Labat', 'Ameet K Jain', 'Danny Y Song', 'Everette Clif Burdette', 'Gabor Fichtinger', 'Jerry L Prince']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Matching and reconstruction of brachytherapy seeds using the Hungarian algorithm (MARSHAL).', 'Intraoperative 3D reconstruction of prostate brachytherapy implants with automatic pose correction.', 'An image-guidance system for dynamic dose calculation in prostate brachytherapy using ultrasound and fluoroscopy.', 'Prostate brachytherapy seed localization by analysis of multiple projections: identifying and addressing the seed overlap problem.', 'Optimal matching for prostate brachytherapy seed localization with dimension reduction.', 'Deformable registration of X-ray to MRI for post-implant dosimetry in prostate brachytherapy.', 'A deformable multimodal image registration using PET/CT and TRUS for intraoperative focal prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of PET/CT and ultrasound for disease-targeted focal prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of x ray and MRI for postimplant dosimetry in low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Intraoperative Registered Ultrasound and Fluoroscopy (iRUF) for dose calculation during prostate brachytherapy: Improved accuracy compared to standard ultrasound-based dosimetry.']"""

Methods and materials:   Seventeen consecutive patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the prostate bed were studied. For patients with large anatomical variations, quantified by either a rectal wall displacement of >5 mm or bladder volume change of >50% on the CBCT compared with the planning CT, an intervention was performed to adjust the rectum and/or bladder filling. Cumulative doses over the pre- and post-intervention fractions were calculated by tracking the position of the planning CT voxels on different CBCTs using a deformable surface-mapping algorithm. Dose and displacements vectors were projected on two-dimensional maps, the minimal dose received by the highest 95% of the planing target volume (PTV D95) and the highest 10% of the rectum volume (D10) as well as the bladder volume receiving >2 Gy (V2) were evaluated.  Results:   Of 544 fractions, 96 required intervention. Median (range) number of interventions per patient was 5 (2-12). Compared with the planning values, the mean (SD) pre- vs. postintervention value for PTV D95 was -2% (2%) vs. -1% (2%) (p < 0.12), for rectum D10 was -1% (4%) vs. +1% (4%) (p < 0.24), and for bladder V2 was +6% vs. +20% (p < 0.84).  Conclusions:   Interventions to reduce treatment volume deformations due to bladder and rectum fillings are not necessary when patients receive daily accurate CBCT localization, and the frequency of those potential interventions is low. However, for hypofractionated treatments, the relative frequency can significantly increase, and interventions can become more dosimetrically beneficial.""","""['Quentin Diot', 'Christine Olsen', 'Brian Kavanagh', 'David Raben', 'Moyed Miften']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Relationship between pelvic organ-at-risk dose and clinical target volume in postprostatectomy patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Does Interfraction Cone Beam Computed Tomography Improve Target Localization in Prostate Bed Radiotherapy?', 'Dosimetric and volumetric effects in clinical target volume and organs at risk during postprostatectomy radiotherapy.', 'Post-Prostatectomy Image-Guided Radiotherapy: The Invisible Target Concept.', 'Evaluating deviations in prostatectomy patients treated with IMRT.', 'Rationale and development of image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy post-prostatectomy: the present standard of care?']"""

In total, 80 men had an IPSS ≥ 15, 48% of whom were taking genitourinary (GU) medications before RT. The IPSS was followed over time and analyzed as a pretreatment factor against Radiation Therapy Oncology Group acute and late GU toxicity.  Results:   The median follow-up was 44 months. Among men with a pre-RT IPSS ≥ 15, the median IPSS at baseline, first follow-up, and last follow-up was 18 (range, 15 to 34), 17 (range, 0 to 32), and 13 (range, 0 to 34), respectively.

Methods and materials:   2134 Kilovoltage (kV) cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were analyzed, with three shifts recorded for each image. The number of times that the vector of the combined shifts would have exceeded the planning tumor volume (PTV) margin was tallied. Then, the average scalar shift of the first five images was removed from all subsequent images for a given patient, and the number of days for which the shift vector was greater than the three-dimensional clinical tumor volume-PTV (3D CTV-PTV) margin (8 mm, created with rolling ball technique) was recorded. Additionally, the scalar shifts from every other fraction were studied to determine if the individual patient's shift vector would be adequately sampled if CBCT was not performed daily, thus reducing patient imaging dose without compromising treatment quality.  Results:   There were 297 cases where the vector shift was initially greater than the PTV margin. By correcting each patient's data set by the average shift of their first five images the total was 248 cases. By considering only every other image of each patient data set (after correction for the first 5 days), only 137 days in which the CTV was outside the PTV would have been seen.  Conclusions:   Daily imaging is recommended for prostate cancer IMRT patients in order to know the 3D (vector) position of the CTV and to ensure that it is always within the PTV margin.

One study suggested that androgen deprivation therapy may also be associated with nonfragility fractures in older men. Whether other clinical risk factors independently increase the risk of fractures is not certain.  Materials and methods:   Using linked administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, we matched 19,079 men 66 years old or older with prostate cancer with at least 6 months of continuous androgen deprivation therapy or bilateral orchiectomy with men with prostate cancer who had never received androgen deprivation. Matching variables were age, prior cancer treatment, diagnosis year, comorbidity, medication, prior fractures and socioeconomic variables. Primary outcomes were a typical fragility fracture of the spine, hip or wrist and any fracture. Independent predictors of fracture outcomes were assessed with Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   At a mean 6.47-year followup androgen deprivation therapy was associated with an increased risk of fragility fracture (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.53-1.78) and any fracture (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.39-1.54). Independent predictors of fragility and any fracture were increasing age, prior bone thinning medications, chronic kidney disease, prior dementia, prior fragility fracture and prior osteoporosis diagnosis or treatment (p <0.05).

Aggressive postoperative prostate specific antigen surveillance is costly and anxiety provoking. In this study we investigate the need for yearly prostate specific antigen measurements in patients with surgically treated low risk prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We identified 2,219 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1994 and 2004 for low risk localized prostate cancer. Low risk was defined as prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml, pathological stage pT2c or less, Gleason score 6 or less, negative lymph nodes and negative surgical margins. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy were excluded from analysis. Biochemical failure was defined as a prostate specific antigen greater than 0.4 ng/ml and prostate specific antigen values less than 0.15 ng/ml were considered undetectable. Biochemical failure rates were calculated according to the duration of the prostate specific antigen-free period after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   A total of 142 (6.4%) patients experienced biochemical failure during the course of the study. The risk of biochemical failure decreased with increasing duration of the prostate specific antigen-free interval. For example 1, 3 and 5-year biochemical failure rates calculated at surgery were 1.8%, 4.2% and 6.3%, respectively. For patients with undetectable prostate specific antigen measurements 5 years after surgery the 1, 3 and 5-year biochemical failure rates were 0.0%, 0.7% and 1.3%, respectively. In addition, 1-year biochemical failure rates were 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.0% and 0.0% after a prostate specific antigen-free period of 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively.  Conclusions:   The risk of biochemical failure is inversely proportional to the duration of the prostate specific antigen-free interval after radical prostatectomy in low risk patients. Biochemical failure 1 year after an undetectable prostate specific antigen is uncommon, especially after a prostate specific antigen-free period of 3 years. These data suggest that annual prostate specific antigen measurements are unnecessary, especially after a prostate specific antigen-free interval of 3 years. Prostate specific antigen measurements every 2 years should capture the majority of low risk patients who experience progression.""","""['Matthew K Tollefson', 'Michael L Blute', 'Laureano J Rangel', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Igor Frank']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Prostate cancer: Postoperative PSA surveillance in patients treated with radical prostatectomy: might less be more?', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Long-term hazard of progression after radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer: continued risk of biochemical failure after 5 years.', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: 5-year oncological and biochemical outcomes.', 'Predictors of time to biochemical recurrence in a radical prostatectomy cohort within the PSA-era.', 'Interval to biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy does not affect survival in men with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic potential of ERG (ETS-related gene) expression in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'The relationship of the intensity of posttreatment prostate-specific antigen surveillance and prostate cancer outcomes: results from a population-based cohort.', 'Can we stop prostate specific antigen testing 10 years after radical prostatectomy?']"""

We determined whether prostate specific antigen velocity could predict repeat biopsy results in men with persistently increased prostate specific antigen after initial negative biopsy.  Materials and methods:   We identified 1,837 men who participated in the Göteborg or Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Screening study of Prostate Cancer and who underwent 1 or more subsequent prostate biopsies after an initial negative finding. We evaluated whether prostate specific antigen velocity improved predictive accuracy beyond that of prostate specific antigen alone.  Results:   Of the 2,579 repeat biopsies 363 (14%) were positive for prostate cancer, of which 44 (1.7%) were high grade (Gleason score 7 or greater). Prostate specific antigen velocity was statistically associated with cancer risk but had low predictive accuracy (AUC 0.55, p <0.001). There was some evidence that prostate specific antigen velocity improved AUC compared to prostate specific antigen for high grade cancer. However, the small increase in risk associated with high prostate specific antigen velocity (from 1.7% to 2.8% as velocity increased from 0 to 1 ng/ml per year) had questionable clinical relevance.  Conclusions:   Men with prior negative biopsy are at lower risk for prostate cancer at subsequent biopsies with high grade disease particularly rare.

Materials and methods:   We measured sex steroid hormones between 1984 and 1987 in the Rancho Bernardo Study. Between 1992 and 1996 surviving participants were evaluated for benign prostatic hyperplasia at followup clinic visits. Benign prostatic hyperplasia was defined as a history of noncancer prostate surgery or a medical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Regression modeling was used to examine associations of serum hormone measures with benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Results:   In 340 surviving participants with complete data available and no history of prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia at baseline mean +/- SD age was 64 +/- 9 years and mean followup was 8.4 +/- 0.8 years. Men who reported benign prostatic hyperplasia during followup were older at baseline than those who did not (p <0.001). Higher baseline serum dihydrotestosterone was associated with an increased risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The OR for the second, third and fourth quartiles of dihydrotestosterone was 1.83 (95% CI 0.96-3.47), 1.50 (0.79-2.85) and 2.75 (1.46-5.19), respectively (p trend = 0.02).

We evaluated the association between prostate size and high grade (Gleason score 7 or greater) cancer.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed data from 2,880 patients who underwent surgical treatment of prostate cancer between January 2000 and June 2008. Prostate size measured at prostatectomy was compared across a strata of clinical variables (age, body mass index, prostate specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage and year of surgery) and pathological outcomes (final Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, positive surgical margin, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node involvement). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess prostate size as a predictor of high grade cancer.  Results:   Older age, higher prostate specific antigen and later year of surgery were associated with larger gland size. Small prostate size was associated with high grade prostate cancer as well as extraprostatic extension and positive surgical margins on univariate and adjusted analysis. The probability of high grade disease decreased approximately 15% across the lowest vs highest prostate sizes. On multivariate analysis adjusted for age, race, prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score and date of surgery prostate size was an important predictor of high grade disease (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.92, 0.97 per 2 gm increments, p <0.001).

MRBot, an MR-stealth brachytherapy delivery device, was used in a closed-bore 3T MRI and a clinical brachytherapy cone beam CT suite. Targets included ceramic dummy seeds, MR-Spectroscopy-sensitive metabolite, and a prostate phantom. Acquired DICOM images were exported to planning software to register the robot coordinates in the imager's frame, contour and verify target locations, create dose plans, and export needle and seed positions to the robot. The coordination of each system element (imaging device, brachytherapy planning system, robot control, robot) was validated with a seed delivery accuracy of within 2 mm in both a phantom and soft tissue. An adaptive workflow was demonstrated by acquiring images after needle insertion and prior to seed deposition. This allows for adjustment if the needle is in the wrong position. Inverse planning (IPSA) was used to generate a seed placement plan and coordinates for ten needles and 29 seeds were transferred to the robot. After every two needles placed, an image was acquired. The placed seeds were identified and validated prior to placing the seeds in the next two needles. The ability to robotically deliver seeds to locations determined by IPSA and the ability of the system to incorporate novel needle patterns were demonstrated. Shown here is the ability to overcome this critical step. An adaptive brachytherapy workflow is demonstrated which integrates a clinical anatomy-based seed location optimization engine and a robotic brachytherapy device. Demonstration of this workflow is a key element of a successful translation to the clinic of the MRI stealth robotic delivery system, MRBot.""","""['J Adam Cunha', 'I-Chow Hsu', 'Jean Pouliot', 'Mack Roach Iii', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'John Kurhanewicz', 'Galen Reed', 'Dan Stoianovici']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Minim Invasive Ther Allied Technol""","""['An automated optimization tool for high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy with divergent needle pattern.', 'AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy: report of Task Group 192.', 'Automatic brachytherapy seed placement under MRI guidance.', 'Robotic system for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Brachytherapy--an example of a urological minimally invasive robotic procedure.', 'Kinematic and mechanical modelling of a novel 4-DOF robotic needle guide for MRI-guided prostate intervention.', 'Concepts and Trends n Autonomy for Robot-Assisted Surgery.', 'A novel multi-DoF surgical robotic system for brachytherapy on liver tumor: Design and control.', 'Feasibility of interstitial stepping-source electronic brachytherapy to locally inoperable tumors.', 'Image-guided robotic interventions for prostate cancer.']"""

Design and setting:   Analysis of 78 708 deaths occurring between 1981 and 2008, within the Nottingham randomised controlled trial of biennial faecal occult blood testing.  Main outcome measures:   Cause of death, age at death by sex and by cause.  Results:   Significantly more subjects died from verified colorectal cancer in the trial's control group than in the intervention group (3.2% vs 2.9%). For no other major cause of death was the difference in proportion across the two groups statistically significant. Age at death was lower for cancer than for other principal causes, except for ischaemic heart disease among women. However, mean age at death was higher for colorectal cancer than for other cancers, except for prostate cancer among men. Increasing levels of material deprivation significantly lowered the expected ages at death, independently of cause. For both men and women, the mean age at death from all causes for screening participants was higher than that of controls and non-participants. Mean deprivation was lowest among participants. Of those participating in screening, and dying from colorectal cancer, subjects receiving negative test results lived significantly longer than those who received positive test results. However, if dying from other causes, they died at an earlier age.  Conclusions:   The age at death from colorectal cancer is higher than that of most other cancers. Those accepting a screening invitation live longer than non-participants. In part, this difference is explained by relative deprivation.

In these cases, combination therapy using chemotherapeutic agents and Fas may be more suitable than therapy using Fas alone. In the present study, we demonstrate that the apoptosis inhibitory protein, Bcl-2, was highly expressed in response to Fas in DU145 prostate cancer cells, thereby conferring resistance to apoptosis. We have screened a number of naturally occurring products that may overcome this resistance. Here we report that cryptotanshinone, the major tanshinone isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, can suppress Bcl-2 expression and augment Fas sensitivity in DU145 cells. We further show that JNK and p38 MAPK act upstream of Bcl-2 expression in Fas-treated DU145 cells, and that cryptotanshinone significantly blocked activation of these kinases. Moreover, cryptotanshinone sensitized several tumor cells to a broad range of anti-cancer agents.

TGFα and EGFR overexpression have been reported in various human cancers. However, whether TGFα induces cancer by itself is unknown in urogenital organs. To investigate whether TGFα overexpression induces carcinogenesis in urogenital organs, we analyzed the phenotypes of urogenital organs in male TGFα transgenic (TG) mice of the CD1 strain. Urogenital organs including the kidney, bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, testes, and epididymis were isolated from 4- to 48-week-old TGFα TG and wild-type (WT) CD1 mice. Prostates were separated into anterior prostate (AP), dorsolateral prostate (DLP), and ventral prostate (VP). Neither tumor formation nor epithelial hyperplasia was observed in the TGFα TG mouse urogenital organs that we have investigated. Histopathologically, in prostate, we found an increased number of p63-positive basal epithelial cells in the TGFα TG mice AP and DLP. There was no morphological change in the stromal component, such as hypercellular stroma or fibrosis. However, bladder weight was greater in TGFα TG mice than that in WT mice, and distended bladders were observed macroscopically in 19 of 20 TGFα TG mice over 20 weeks of age. Ki67 labeling index was increased significantly in the TGFα TG mouse urethral epithelium, whereas neither epithelial hyperplasia nor hypertrophy was observed. In conclusion, our results suggest that TGFα overexpression in mouse urogenital organs alone may not be responsible for tumor formation and epithelial hyperplasia, but is involved in bladder outlet obstruction.""","""['Yuko Yoshio', 'Kenichiro Ishii', 'Shigeki Arase', 'Yasuhide Hori', 'Kohei Nishikawa', 'Norihito Soga', 'Hideaki Kise', 'Kiminobu Arima', 'Yoshiki Sugimura']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Differentiation""","""['Transforming growth factor alpha and mouse models of human breast cancer.', 'Paradoxical tumor inhibitory effect of p53 loss in transgenic mice expressing epidermal-targeted v-rasHa, v-fos, or human transforming growth factor alpha.', 'Integrative roles of transforming growth factor-alpha in the cytoprotection mechanisms of gastric mucosal injury.', 'Cell cycle basis for the onset and progression of c-Myc-induced, TGFalpha-enhanced mouse mammary gland carcinogenesis.', 'Sex differences in expression of transforming growth factor-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA in Waved-1 and C57Bl6 mice.', 'Role of Stromal Paracrine Signals in Proliferative Diseases of the Aging Human Prostate.', 'Why are epididymal tumours so rare?', 'Segment- and cell-specific expression of D-type cyclins in the postnatal mouse epididymis.']"""

Next, small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for Akt isoforms were used to elucidate their role on the in vitro and in vivo growth of prostate cancer cells. Expression of Akt1 and Akt2 was detected in all cells tested, but Akt3 was expressed only in cancer cells that did not express androgen receptors.

Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated in a clinical study including 26 patients and 14 controls.  Materials and methods:   Reduced field-of-view acquisition was established by non-coplanar application of the excitation and the refocusing pulse in conjunction with outer volume suppression. Accuracy for cancer detection of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping and T2-weighted imaging was calculated and compared with reference to the findings of trans-rectal ultrasound-guided octant biopsy. Mean ADCs and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the patients with positive and negative biopsies were compared to each other and to the controls.  Results:   Fine anatomical details were successfully depicted on the ADC maps with sub-millimeter resolution. Accuracy for prostate cancer detection was 73.5% for ADC maps and 71% for T2-weighted images, respectively. Cohen's kappa (κ=0.48) indicated moderate agreement of the two methods. The mean ADCs were significantly lower, the FA values higher, in the patients with positive biopsy than in the patients with negative biopsy and the controls. Monte Carlo simulations showed that the FA values, but not the ADCs, were slightly overestimated. Bootstrap analysis revealed that the ADC, but not the FA value, is a highly repeatable marker.

Currently, its histogenetic origin is unclear and its distinction from metastatic small cell lung cancer is challenging. The aim of our study was to determine whether the ERG rearrangement commonly observed in acinar prostatic cancer can distinguish small cell prostatic cancer from small cell lung cancer samples.  Methods and results:   We assessed 15 small cell prostatic cancers and 22 small cell lung cancers for ERG rearrangement using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Commonly used and novel immunohistochemical markers (i.e. androgen receptor, calcium activated nucleotidase 1, Golgi phosphoprotein 2, prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific membrane antigen, CD56, epithelial membrane antigen, thyroid transcription factor 1, chromogranin A, synaptophysin and Ki67) were further studied. ERG rearrangement occurred in 86% of small cell prostatic cancers but in none of the small cell lung cancers and was the best marker to differentiate between both tumours (P < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   The ERG rearrangement is commonly observed in small cell prostatic cancer, supporting the hypothesis that ERG rearrangement occurs in aggressive prostatic cancers.

MTs belong to a family of low-molecular weight proteins, which bind metal ions endogenously and its over-expression has been reported in a variety of cancers that include breast, prostate, and colon.

Our results demonstrate that adheren junctions may play important roles in the formation of cell-in-cell cytostructure after MT-2A gene downregulation and the entotic process does not appear to involve genes associated with autophagy.

Obesity-related variations in insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and -II) and their binding proteins (IGFBPs) could underlie these associations.  Methods:   We investigated associations of adiposity throughout the life course (determined retrospectively) with serum levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 in a population-based study of 1,106 healthy men.  Results:   IGF-I and IGF-II showed inverted U-shaped associations with adult body mass index (BMI) (p quadratic model = 0.04 and 0.06, respectively), although differences between quartiles with the highest and lowest IGF-I levels were small (no more than 5 ng/ml). IGFBP-2 was strongly inversely related to adult BMI (-22% change per SD increase in BMI; 95% confidence interval (CI) -24% to -19%) and waist circumference (-18% change per SD increase in waist circumference; 95% CI -20% to -15%) (p < 0.001). IGFBP-3 was positively related to BMI (63.5 ng/ml increase per SD increase in BMI; 95% CI -2.69 to 129.8, p = 0.06). IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 were strongly related to body shape change from childhood to adulthood, with men who gained the most weight having the lowest IGFBP-2 (9% lower per category body shape change; 95% CI -11% to -7%, p < 0.001) and the highest IGFBP-3 (50 ng/ml increase per category; 95% CI 8 to 92, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   We provide evidence that adiposity and change in body shape through the life course are related to the IGF system, with the largest effect of adiposity being to lower IGFBP-2, a possible marker of insulin resistance. The results suggest that circulating IGF-I levels may not be important mediators of the association of adiposity with aggressive prostate cancer, but the role of IGFBP-2 deserves further investigation.""","""['Mari-Anne Rowlands', 'Jeff M P Holly', 'David Gunnell', 'Rebecca Gilbert', 'Jenny Donovan', 'J Athene Lane', 'Gemma Marsden', 'Simon M Collin', 'Freddie Hamdy', 'David E Neal', 'Richard M Martin']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Associations of adiposity from childhood into adulthood with insulin resistance and the insulin-like growth factor system: 65-year follow-up of the Boyd Orr Cohort.', 'Insulin-like growth factors, their binding proteins, and prostate cancer risk: analysis of individual patient data from 12 prospective studies.', 'A cross-sectional analysis of the association between diet and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, and IGFBP-3 in men in the United Kingdom.', 'Does milk intake promote prostate cancer initiation or progression via effects on insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)?

Methods:   Between April 1998 and April 2003, 70 Japanese patients with T3N0M0 prostate cancer who received radical 3D-CRT treatment were evaluated. The median age, initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and duration of NAHT were 73 years old, 26.3 ng/ml, and 4 months, respectively. Seventy grays were given in 35 fractions that were confined to the prostate and seminal vesicles. Adjuvant hormonal therapy was not administered after 3D-CRT in any of the cases.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 64.9 months. The median PSA value at the time of initiation of SHT was 5.0 ng/ml (range 0.1-21.6 ng/ml). Overall, disease-specific, PSA failure-free (based on the Phoenix definition) and SHT-free survival rates at 5 years were 90.3% (95% CI 86.5-94.0), 96.5% (94.0-98.9), 60.5% (48.2-72.7), and 63.5% (57.2-69.8), respectively. Therefore, two-thirds of the patients were still hormone-free at 5 years.  Conclusions:   PSA control rates in our series of Japanese patients with stage T3N0M0 prostate cancer treated with the standard dose of 3D-CRT combined with NAHT seemed higher than expected.

Here, we characterize a rabbit anti-ERG monoclonal antibody (clone EPR 3864; Epitomics, Burlingame, CA) using immunoblot analysis on prostate cancer cell lines, synthetic TMPRSS2-ERG constructs, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. We correlated ERG protein expression with the presence of ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancer tissues using a combined immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. We independently evaluated two patient cohorts and observed ERG expression confined to prostate cancer cells and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia associated with ERG-positive cancer, as well as vessels and lymphocytes (where ERG has a known biologic role). Image analysis of 131 cases demonstrated nearly 100% sensitivity for detecting ERG rearrangement prostate cancer, with only 2 (1.5%) of 131 cases demonstrating strong ERG protein expression without any known ERG gene fusion. The combined pathology evaluation of 207 patient tumors for ERG protein expression had 95.7% sensitivity and 96.5% specificity for determining ERG rearrangement prostate cancer. In conclusion, this study qualifies a specific anti-ERG antibody and demonstrates exquisite association between ERG gene rearrangement and truncated ERG protein product expression.

We previously demonstrated that TLR3 activation mediated by its agonist poly(I:C) induces antitumor signaling, leading to apoptosis of prostate cancer cells LNCaP and PC3 with much more efficiency in the former than in the second more aggressive line. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) regulates several cellular processes, including apoptosis, in response to hypoxia and to other stimuli also in normoxic conditions. Here we describe a novel protumor machinery triggered by TLR3 activation in PC3 cells consisting of increased expression of the specific I.3 isoform of HIF-1 alpha and nuclear accumulation of HIF-1 complex in normoxia, resulting in reduced apoptosis and in secretion of functional vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Moreover, we report that, in the less aggressive LNCaP cells, TLR3 activation fails to induce nuclear accumulation of HIF-1 alpha. However, the transfection of I.3 isoform of hif-1 alpha in LNCaP cells allows poly(I:C)-induced HIF-1 activation, resulting in apoptosis protection and VEGF secretion.

Methods:   In an experiment of 34 participants with clinical backgrounds, we used a custom-built simulator to determine whether certain finger palpation techniques improved one's ability to detect abnormalities smaller in size and dispersed as multiples over a volume. The intent was to test abnormality cases of clinical relevance near the limits of size perceptibility (ie, 5-mm diameter). The simulator can present abnormalities in various configurations and record finger movement. To characterize finger movement, four palpation techniques were quantitatively defined (global finger movement, local finger movement, average intentional finger pressure, and dominant intentional finger frequency) to represent the qualitative definitions of other researchers.  Results:   Participants who used more thorough patterns of global finger movement (V and L) ensured that the entire prostate was searched and detected more abnormalities. A higher magnitude of finger pressure was associated with the detection of smaller abnormalities. The local finger movement of firm pressure with varying intensities was most indicative of success and was required to identify the smallest (5-mm diameter) abnormality. When participants used firm pressure with varying intensities, their dominant intentional finger frequency was about 6 Hz.

A retrospective analysis was performed on 614 pT2-4N0 patients with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. All 614 patients underwent limited or extended PLND during RP. BCR-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression was applied to analyse survivals rates. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n=295) had 1 to 9 retrieved LNs and group 2 (n=319) had 10 or more retrieved. The parameters analysed were age, PSA, clinical and pathological Gleason score (GS), stage, margin status and adjuvant radiotherapy (ART). BCR was defined as PSA greater than 0.2 ng/ml.  Results:   Mean follow-up time was 62.5+/-39.7 months. Group 2 showed a significantly lower BCR than group 1 (p=0.019).

The present study investigated whether clioquinol targets both pathways dependently or independently in human prostate cancer DU 145 cells. Clioquinol inhibited NF-kappaB activity, an effect being more pronounced in the presence of zinc. This inhibition was mediated through a reduced nuclear level of p65, the most frequently detected NF-kappaB subunit. Clioquinol also induced alterations of lysosome permeability in a zinc concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of the cells with ammonium, a lysosome protection agent, attenuated clioquinol-induced disruption of the lysosomes, yet ammonium had no effect on clioquinol-induced inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling. MG132, an established NF-kappaB inhibitor, suppressed NF-kappaB activity without causing alterations of lysosome permeability.

In this study, we examined the expression and function of VGSCs in a panel of colon cancer cell lines by electrophysiologic recordings. Na(+) channel activity and invasive potential were inhibited pharmacologically by tetrodotoxin or genetically by small interfering RNAs (siRNA) specifically targeting SCN5A. Clinical relevance was established by immunohistochemistry of patient biopsies, with strong Na(v)1.5 protein staining found in colon cancer specimens but little to no staining in matched-paired normal colon tissues. We explored the mechanism of VGSC-mediated invasive potential on the basis of reported links between VGSC activity and gene expression in excitable cells. Probabilistic modeling of loss-of-function screens and microarray data established an unequivocal role of VGSC SCN5A as a high level regulator of a colon cancer invasion network, involving genes that encompass Wnt signaling, cell migration, ectoderm development, response to biotic stimulus, steroid metabolic process, and cell cycle control. siRNA-mediated knockdown of predicted downstream network components caused a loss of invasive behavior, demonstrating network connectivity and its function in driving colon cancer invasion.""","""['Carrie D House', 'Charles J Vaske', 'Arnold M Schwartz', 'Vincent Obias', 'Bryan Frank', 'Truong Luu', 'Narine Sarvazyan', 'Rosalyn Irby', 'Robert L Strausberg', 'Tim G Hales', 'Joshua M Stuart', 'Norman H Lee']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Voltage-gated Na+ Channel Activity Increases Colon Cancer Transcriptional Activity and Invasion Via Persistent MAPK Signaling.', 'Therapeutic potential for phenytoin: targeting Na(v)1.5 sodium channels to reduce migration and invasion in metastatic breast cancer.', 'Expression of voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit in human ovarian cancer.', 'Molecular pharmacology of voltage-gated sodium channel expression in metastatic disease: clinical potential of neonatal Nav1.5 in breast cancer.', 'Regulation of the voltage-gated cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 by interacting proteins.', 'Antiproliferative, Antioxidant, Chemopreventive and Antiangiogenic Potential of Chromatographic Fractions from Anemonia sulcata with and without Its Symbiont Symbiodinium in Colorectal Cancer Therapy.', 'Voltage-gated sodium channels: from roles and mechanisms in the metastatic cell behavior to clinical potential as therapeutic targets.', 'NALCN is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in human cancers.', 'Inactivation of epithelial sodium ion channel molecules serves as effective diagnostic biomarkers in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel NaV1.5 Controls NHE-1-Dependent Invasive Properties in Colon Cancer Cells.']"""

Here we report that expression of ITGA7 induced apoptosis in the human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the C-terminus of ITGA7 interacts with high temperature requirement A2 (HtrA2), a serine protease with a critical role in apoptosis. Expression of ITGA7 increases the protease activity of HtrA2 both in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of the HtrA2 interaction domain abrogates the cell death activity of ITGA7, whereas down-regulation of HtrA2 dramatically reduced cell death mediated by ITGA7. In addition, site-directed protease-null mutant HtrA2S306A expression blocked apoptosis induced by ITGA7. Interestingly, interaction between ITGA7 and its ligand laminin 2 appears to protect against cell death, since depleting laminin beta2 with a small-interfering RNA significantly exacerbated apoptosis induced by ITGA7 expression.

Our objective was to determine whether these SNPs affect the progression of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We genotyped 26 SNPs previously associated with prostate cancer risk among 788 aggressive prostate cancer patients who were treated by radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Prostate cancer progression was defined as biochemical recurrence based on posttreatment prostate-specific antigen levels of >0.3 ng/mL for radical prostatectomy patients or a 2-ng/mL increase above the nadir for radiation therapy patients, initiation of hormone treatment, or metastases. We assessed the association between independent and combined SNPs and disease progression by Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Five SNPs showed independent associations with prostate cancer progression (rs12621278, rs629242, rs9364554, rs4430796, and rs5945572) based on stepwise regression analysis. The strongest SNP was rs12621278 in the ITGA6 locus, which was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of progression (P = 0.0003). When considering the sum of risk alleles across these five SNPs, each additional allele was associated with a 29% increase in risk of progression (95% confidence interval, 1.12-1-47).  Conclusions:   We found that five of the recently highlighted prostate cancer susceptibility loci also influence prostate cancer progression beyond the known clinicopathologic predictors. If confirmed, these genetic variants might help clarify which tumors are likely to progress and require more aggressive treatment in contrast to those that might not have substantial effects on morbidity or mortality.

We believe that all urologists should be trained in this procedure. This DVD provides an overview of TURBT with particular focus on basic skills, including basic surgical techniques such as the obturator nerve block. Important basic surgical skills required for complete TURBT in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer are: (i) resection of all visible tumors; (ii) resection of apparently normal mucosa on the border of the tumor; (iii) resection of the muscle layer at the base of the tumor until normal muscle fibers are visible; (iv) in applicable cases, random biopsy of apparently normal urothelium of the bladder wall and transurethral resection (TUR) biopsy of both sides of the prostatic urethra; and (v) when possible, after these procedures are completed, a different operating surgeon should inspect the bladder lumen to confirm that there are no remaining tumors. In particular, sampling resection should be implemented in apparently normal mucosa for approximately 1 cm around the tumor, and at the base of the tumor down to the superficial muscle layer. Resected specimens should be examined histopathologically in order to confirm the absence of malignant findings. Fundamental procedures for TURBT include both one-stage and two-stage resection. One-stage resection is used for relatively small tumors and involves a single procedure with simultaneous resection of both the tumor and the tissue at the tumor base down to the superficial muscle layer. In the two-stage resection, the first resection exposes the lower level of the mucosa and the second resection removes that lower mucosal layer in order to sample the superficial muscle layer for cancer staging. At the start of the resection, the loop is electrified before it makes contact with the mucosa. Delicate movements of the sheath should be used, along with delicate movement of the loop itself to adjust the depth of resection. The illustration of surgical techniques shows not only the basic techniques but also some points for caution during the resection. For actual resection, it is important to fully understand the properties of the tumor and to combine these techniques appropriately for each individual resection procedure. When resecting multiple tumors, the same basic resection techniques used for single tumors should be applied, and repeated as necessary.

A major obstacle to successful development is P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated resistance. Here, we have assessed a compound that inhibited growth of cancer cells, for effects on JNK and tubulin and as a substrate for P-gp.  Experimental approach:   Several pharmacological and biochemical assays were used to characterize signalling pathways of 2-phenyl-5-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-1H-benzimidazole (PPTMB), a benzimidazole analogue, in prostate cancer cells.  Key results:   PPTMB inhibited proliferation of several human prostate cancer cell lines. It displayed similar activity against a P-gp-rich cell line, indicating that PPTMB was not a substrate for P-gp. PPTMB induced G2/M arrest of the cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis, using flow cytometry. Tubulin polymerization assays and Western blot analysis showed that PPTMB directly acted on tubulin and caused disruption of microtubule dynamics, inducing mitotic arrest and sustained high levels of cyclin B1 expression and Cdk1 activation. Subsequently, mitochondria-related apoptotic cascades were induced, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL phosphorylation, Mcl-1 down-regulation, truncated Bad formation and activation of caspase-9 and -3. PPTMB stimulated JNK phosphorylation at Thr(183)/Tyr(185). SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor, significantly inhibited apoptotic signalling, indicating that JNK plays a key role in PPTMB action. PPTMB showed a 10-fold higher potency against prostate cancer cells than normal prostate cells.  Conclusions and implications:   PPTMB is an effective anti-cancer agent. It disrupted microtubule dynamics, leading to mitotic arrest of the cell cycle and JNK activation, which in turn stimulated the mitochondria-related apoptotic cascades in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Wei-Ling Chang', 'Chih-Shiang Chang', 'Po-Cheng Chiang', 'Yunn-Fang Ho', 'Ju-Fang Liu', 'Kai-Wei Chang', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Br J Pharmacol""","""['Investigation of anti-tumor mechanisms of K2154: characterization of tubulin isotypes, mitotic arrest and apoptotic machinery.', 'Repurposing of phentolamine as a potential anticancer agent against human castration-resistant prostate cancer: A central role on microtubule stabilization and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.', 'The newly synthesized 2-arylnaphthyridin-4-one, CSC-3436, induces apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by inhibiting tubulin dynamics and activating CDK1.', 'Benzimidazole hybrids as anticancer drugs: An updated review on anticancer properties, structure-activity relationship, and mechanisms of action (2019-2021).', 'Recent advances of benzimidazole as anticancer agents.', 'Targeting of tubulin polymerization and induction of mitotic blockage by Methyl 2-(5-fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-1H-benzodimidazole-5-carboxylate (MBIC) in human cervical cancer HeLa cell.', 'New benzimidazole acridine derivative induces human colon cancer cell apoptosis in vitro via the ROS-JNK signaling pathway.', 'KUD773, a phenylthiazole derivative, displays anticancer activity in human hormone-refractory prostate cancers through inhibition of tubulin polymerization and anti-Aurora A activity.', 'MAP Kinases and Prostate Cancer.']"""

In addition to reducing inflammation and pain, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, CAS 50-78-2), like other synthetic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), has been shown to exert anti-proliferative effects and to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell lines, e.g., colon, stomach, and prostate cancer cells. To investigate the mechanism of action and possible anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects of willow bark, a water extract (STW 33-I) and a polyphenol rich fraction (fraction E) have been tested by using the colon-carcinoma cell line HT-29. Both, STW 33-I and its fraction E showed significant anti-proliferative and (1) Introduction The most well-known component of willow bark extract is salicin, which is metabolized in vivo to salicylic acid. The standardized aqueous willow bark extract STW 33-I, which is an effective analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug, contains 23-26% total salicin derivatives and additionally flavonoids, condensed tannins and polyphenols. Typical representatives of the flavonoids are glycosides of naringenin, isosalipurpuroside or eriodictyol. In vitro experiments have demonstrated for pro-apoptotic effects on HT-29 cancer cells. Related to the salicin content of the willow bark extract, a higher dosage of ASA was needed. Furthermore, compared to ASA and to diclofenac (Diclo, CAS 15307-79-6), the COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expressions were influenced differently by STW 33-I and fraction E. ASA and Diclo inhibited both the COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expressions, whereas STW 33-I and its fraction E increased the COX-1 mRNA expression. In addition to the already well-known anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, willow bark extract has been found to possess anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects similar to NSAIDs. The different influence of willow bark on the COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expressions in comparison to NSAIDs might be relevant, e.g., for prevention of undesirable side effects such as gastric erosions.""","""['Gabriel Alejandro Bonaterra', 'Olaf Kelber', 'Dieter Weiser', 'Jürgen Metz', 'Ralf Kinscherf']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Arzneimittelforschung""","""['Mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of a standardized willow bark extract.', 'Mechanisms of the anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of the herbal fixed combination STW 5 (Iberogast®) on colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) cells in vitro.', 'Anti-inflammatory effects of the willow bark extract STW 33-I (Proaktiv(®)) in LPS-activated human monocytes and differentiated macrophages.', 'Willow bark extract: the contribution of polyphenols to the overall effect.', 'Efficacy and Safety of White Willow Bark (Salix alba) Extracts.', 'Phytochemical Screening of Ultrasonic Extracts of Salix Species and Molecular Docking Study of Salix-Derived Bioactive Compounds Targeting Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines.', 'Heat Stress in Broiler Chickens and the Effect of Dietary Polyphenols, with Special Reference to Willow (Salix spp.) Bark Supplements-A Review.', 'Identification and accumulation of phenolic compounds in the leaves and bark of Salix alba (L.) and their biological potential.', 'Miyabeacin: A new cyclodimer presents a potential role for willow in cancer therapy.', 'The Health-Promoting Potential of Salix spp. Bark Polar Extracts: Key Insights on Phenolic Composition and In Vitro Bioactivity and Biocompatibility.']"""

There are currently five categories of available treatment options for erectile dysfunction for men following radical prostatectomy. The first and most common treatment is oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil). Despite their popularity, these medications do not always produce an erection sufficient for intercourse after prostatectomy. The second treatment option is the noninvasive option of either a venous constriction band or the vacuum constriction device. Both treatments use a venous occlusive tension band or ring to maintain erection by retaining blood in the penis. The vacuum constriction device also utilizes external suction pressure to create an erection prior to application of the tension ring. The third treatment option is Muses, an intraurethral suppository containing alprostadil that dilates the penile blood vessels. The fourth treatment option involves penile injections. The fifth treatment is the penile prosthesis, in which artificial rods are surgically implanted into the corpora cavernosa to provide penile rigidity. Oral agents, the vacuum device, Muse, and injections have been used for penile rehabilitation to encourage spontaneous return of erectile function in men after radical prostatectomy with varied success. Untreated erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy has been associated with penile atrophy and further diminished erectile function. Therefore, it is critically important that clinicians provide comprehensive information about the positive and negative aspects of all treatment options and the penile rehabilitation potential of each.

Methods:   Prospective cohort design was used to recruit 512 newly diagnosed PCa patients from urology clinics of an urban academic hospital and a Veterans Administration medical center. Participants provided demographic information and completed self-reported generic and prostate-specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and indirect-cost surveys at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up. Linear mixed models were applied to study the association between OPI costs, treatment and HRQoL outcomes. Propensity scores adjusted for potential confounders and Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple testing.  Results:   Total mean OPI costs varied between RP group and EBRT group at 3-month ($5576 vs. $2010), 6-month ($1776 vs. $2133), 12-month ($757 vs. $774), and at 24-month follow-up ($458 vs. $871).

Quercetin significantly increases the proapoptotic mRNA levels of Bad, IGFBP-3 and protein levels of Bad, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase-9, caspase-10, cleaved PARP and caspase-3 activity in PC-3 cells. IGF-IRβ, PI3K, p-Akt, and cyclin D1 protein expression and mRNA levels of IGF-I, II and IGF-IR were decreased significantly. Further, treatment with PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and quercetin showed decreased p-Akt levels. Apoptosis is confirmed by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in quercetin treated PC-3 cells.

Pleural effusion is frequently observed in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, and cytological analysis is effective to detect malignant pleural mesothelioma. However, cytological discrimination between malignant pleural mesothelioma and reactive mesothelium is often difficult. Increased expression of CD146, a cell adhesion molecule, has been reported to be closely associated with an advanced stage of malignant melanoma, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer. In this study, to evaluate the diagnostic utility of CD146 for discrimination between malignant pleural mesothelioma and reactive mesothelium, we examined immunocytochemical expression of CD146 in malignant pleural mesothelioma and reactive mesothelium using two clones of CD146 antibody, OJ79 and EPR3208, on smear specimens of effusion fluids. Immunocytochemical stains were semiquantitatively scored on the basis of immunostaining intensity (0, negative; 1, weak positive; 2, moderate positive; and 3, strong positive). CD146 expression was detected in 15 of 16 malignant pleural mesothelioma with median immunostaining score of 3 by OJ79, and in 19 of 21 malignant pleural mesothelioma with median immunostaining score of 2 by EPR3208. Strong immunoreactivity of CD146 was observed at the apposing surfaces of cell-cell interactions on the plasma membrane of mesothelioma cells. In addition, one OJ79-negative case of malignant pleural mesothelioma was positive for CD146 by EPR3208 and two EPR3208-negative cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma were CD146 positive by OJ79, showing that all 23 malignant pleural mesothelioma cases were positive for CD146 by either OJ79 or EPR3208. On the other hand, CD146 expression was undetectable in all reactive mesothelium cases by OJ79 and EPR3208. The sensitivity of OJ79 and EPR3208 was 94 and 90%, respectively, and the specificity was 100% for both clones.

Patients and methods:   In this retrospective study, we examined prostate biopsy specimen of 220 consecutive patients, who had undergone repeat prostate biopsies in our department. The first screening round was performed between 2000 and 2005. These first prostate biopsies were examined by two pathologists blinded to the patient's follow-up. Inflammation and several histological criterions were evaluated: acute/chronic and focal/diffuse inflammation, atrophy, high grade PIN (HGPIN) and ASAP. We compared PCa incidences rates (IR) for the different histologic markers using chi(2) analysis and estimated the relative risk (RR) of PCa.  Results:   Two hundred and one patients were included definitively with a median follow-up of 2.1 years (42 days - 8.9 years, period between the first and the last biopsy). One hundred and twenty-six patients (62.7%) were identified with inflammation in the first biopsies (inflammatory group [IG]). Ninety-seven patients (48.3%) had PCa, 58 from the IG. PCa IR did not differ significantly between patients with or without inflammation (RR: 0.9, p=0.6).

The drug encapsulation efficiency of Dtxl was 83.6% and the sustained drug release was observed over 30days. The Dtxl-NPs exhibited significantly more cytotoxicity in both prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and DU145) compared with Dtxl in vitro and increased the Dtxl-induced apoptosis in the PC3 cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that the PC3 cells treated with Dtxl-NPs exhibited significant arrest in the G2-M phase but a higher sub-G(0)/G(1) population when compared with Dtxl. The enhanced apoptosis induced by Dtxl-NPs in the PC3 cells was associated with the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and seemed to involve the activation of caspase-2. The kinetic studies of caspases demonstrated an early activation of caspase-2 in Dtxl-NPs-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells, which differs from Dtxl-induced apoptosis. The inhibition of caspase-2 activation by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown resulted in the significant inhibition of Dtxl-NPs-induced disruption of MMP and Dtxl-NPs-induced apoptosis, indicating that the activation of caspase-2 was the critical event before the mitochondrial depolarization in the PC3 cells.

Methods:   We used data from the 2007 Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the Florida Tobacco Callback Survey to examine screening behaviors related to four cancer types (breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal). Using multiple logistic regression analyses, we examined the association between smoking status and health screening behaviors.  Results:   For 10 of the 11 cancer screening variables, being a current smoker was significantly associated with being less likely to ever have been screened and also less likely to be compliant with screening guidelines. For breast and cervical cancer, level of nicotine dependence was also significantly related to compliance with screening recommendations; women with higher levels of dependence were less likely to be compliant.  Conclusions:   Our results support the notion that individuals' actions related to their health are consistent across different types of behaviors.

Investigating the aggregation of cancer in couples might provide valuable insights into cancer development.  Methods:   The 2008 update of the Swedish Family-Cancer Database includes over 2 million couples with at least one child in common with one single partner. We quantified the contribution of shared adulthood environment by standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and population attributable fractions (PAFs). Estimated SIRs were used to build an etiological map reflecting the similarity of cancers by adult environmental exposures.  Results:   Increased risks of concordant types amongst spouses were found for lung, upper aerodigestive tract and skin cancers (SIRs from 1.24 to 1.97),which are probably related to shared exposure to smoking and UV radiation. PAFs were low with the highest value of 1.46% for uterus cancer in wives of men affected by prostate cancer. Further analysis, based on all non-sex-specific concordant and discordant types, revealed a clustering of lung, stomach, pancreas and bladder cancers sharing smoking as a risk factor. This aggregation was used as a cut-point to identify further ""novel"" clusters.  Conclusion:   Shared lifestyles including smoking and drinking habits as well as human papilloma virus infection (HPV) might be associated with an excess of cancer incidence amongst spouses. We observed significantly an increased risk for smoking-related cancers such as lung, upper aerodigestive tract and oesophageal cancers. The present population-based study confirms that the lifestyle shared by spouses plays a minor role in cancer causation. Only strong environmental risk factors such as smoking seem to influence cancer development in adulthood. The proposed etiological map based on 24 cancer types identifies novel clusters--for example, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukaemia, bone cancer and myeloma--that are not completely explained by established risk factors. Some of the identified clusters relied on reproduced associations between cancer risks amongst husband and wives; however, the role of chance cannot be excluded.""","""['Marianne Weires', 'Justo Lorenzo Bermejo', 'Jan Sundquist', 'Kari Hemminki']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Cancer risks to spouses and offspring in the Family-Cancer Database.', 'Sick leave of spouses to cancer patients before and after diagnosis.', 'Familial cancer risks in affected sibships: results from the Swedish family-cancer database.', 'Cancer prevention: major initiatives and looking into the future.', 'Healthy life style seems to reduce the risk of cancer.

The volume is most commonly measured using the formula, prostate volume = height x width x length x pi/6, which is derived considering the gland as ellipsoid. There are conflicting data regarding the accuracy of this method, with most studies comparing this calculated volume with that measured radiologically using planimetry with summation of sequential area measurements. The aim was to determine the relationship between prostate gland volume and weight.  Methods and results:   The accuracy of prostate gland volume calculated from three-dimensional measurements of the gland in 20 radical prostatectomy specimens relative to the true gland volume determined using water displacement was prospectively evaluated. Since volume measurement by water displacement is not practical in routine practice, the relationship between prostate weight and volume was also evaluated. Our findings indicate that the calculated gland volume consistently underestimates the true volume. The volume of the prostate gland (in cm(3)) very closely correlates with its weight (in g).

It is argued that the risk of incomplete resection could be higher than in open surgery. Furthermore, difficulty in dissection could lead to a very high rate of conversion. There is little information on this. The study aimed at assessing feasibility and operative and oncologic results of laparoscopic resection for T4 colorectal cancer.  Method:   Between 2006 and 2009, 39 patients with colorectal cancer with suspected involvement of another organ (T4) on computed tomography scanning and/or magnetic resonance imaging were included. The cancers were in the right colon (n = 18), left colon (n =9) and rectum (n = 12). The distribution of possible organ involvement was abdominal or pelvic side-wall (n = 21), urinary bladder (n = 4), small bowel or colon (n = 6), vagina and ovary (n = 3), prostate or seminal vesicles (n = 3) and duodenum (n = 2).  Results:   The overall conversion rate was 18%. Postoperative mortality and morbidity were 2.5 and 33%, respectively. Clinical anastomotic leakage rate was 15% (n = 6). Abdominal reoperation was required in three (7%) patients. Pathological invasion to other organs (pT4) was confirmed in 30 (77%) patients. The R1 resection rate was 13% (4 of 30). After a median follow up of 19 months (range 1.5-45 months), the overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 97 and 89%, respectively.

Despite its technical advancements, the da Vinci(®) Surgical System still lacks haptic feedback to the surgeon, resulting in a maximally applied compressive force by the robotic needle driver during every grasping maneuver. Without this perceptional sense of touch and grip control, repetitive robotic needle driver manipulation may unknowingly lead to irreparable damage to fine sutures used during delicate anastomotic repairs. For robotic prostatectomy, any such loss of integrity can potentially lead to premature breakdown of the urethrovesical anastomosis and urine extravasation, especially important for a less-than-perfectly fashioned anastomotic repair. Although it has already been established that overhandling of sutures using handheld laparoscopic instruments can lead to reduced suture strength, it has not been established to what extent this may occur after robotic surgical procedures. We present analytical data and analyses concerning the failure strength of fine sutures commonly used for urethrovesical anastomotic repair during robotic prostatectomy, after repetitive robotic needle driver manipulation. When compared with noncompromised monofilament suture controls, the average maximal failure force after repetitive robotic manipulation was significantly reduced by 35% (p < 0.0001). Similarly, the average maximal failure force of braided sutures was significantly reduced after repetitive robotic manipulation by 3% (p = 0.009). This work demonstrates that significant reductions in monofilament and braided suture strength integrity can occur after customary repetitive manipulation by robotic needle drivers in an ex vivo model, with further research warranted in the in vivo setting.""","""['Daniel Ricchiuti', 'Jeffrey Cerone', 'Scott Shie', 'Ajay Jetley', 'Donald Noe', 'Mark Kovacik']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Effect of robotic manipulation on unidirectional barbed suture integrity: evaluation of tensile strength and sliding force.', 'Suture damage after grasping with EndoWrist of the da Vinci Surgical System.', 'Suture damage during robot-assisted vascular surgery: is it an issue?', 'Intraoperative breakage of needle driver jaw during robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Robotic mitral valve surgery.', 'Tips and tricks for robotic pancreatoduodenectomy with superior mesenteric/portal vein resection and reconstruction.', 'Prevalence of haptic feedback in robot-mediated surgery: a systematic review of literature.', 'Robotic pancreatoduodenectomy with vascular resection.', 'Comparison of perioperative outcomes between running versus interrupted vesicourethral anastomosis in open radical prostatectomy: A single-surgeon experience.', 'Laparoscopic robot-assisted versus open total pancreatectomy: a case-matched study.']"""

The sensitivity of ADAM9 knockdown cells toward radiation and chemotherapeutic agents were determined. Additionally, the effects of ADAM9 knockdown on prostate cancer cell morphology, biochemical and functional alterations were accessed.  Results:   Both transient and stable knockdown of ADAM9 resulted in increased apoptosis and increased sensitivity to radiation. ADAM9 knockdown also increased prostate cancer sensitivity to several chemotherapeutic drugs. ADAM9 knockdown resulted in increased E-cadherin and altered integrin expression and underwent phenotypic epithelial transition. These were reflected by the morphological, biochemical, and functional alterations in the ADAM9 knockdown cells.

Galectin-3 function is regulated by proteolytic cleavage that destroys galectin-3 multivalency while preserving carbohydrate-binding activity. In human semen, galectin-3 is present in seminal plasma and is also associated with prostasomes, exosome-like vesicles secreted by the prostate. In the current study, we characterized the proteolytic activity that cleaves galectin-3 in human seminal plasma.  Methods:   An in vitro assay was developed to investigate galectin-3 cleavage in seminal plasma. The effect of protease inhibitors, divalent ion chelators, and Zn(2+) on the cleavage activity was determined. Proteases enriched from seminal plasma were tested for their ability to cleave galectin-3. Affinity purification and microsequence analysis were used to identify the cleavage site in galectin-3.  Results:   Galectin-3 was identified in human seminal plasma in an intact and truncated form. Gelatinases enriched from seminal plasma did not cleave galectin-3. Inhibitor studies indicated that the galectin-3 cleavage activity in seminal plasma is a Zn(2+) sensitive, serine protease. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was demonstrated to cleave galectin-3 between tyrosine¹⁰⁷-glycine¹⁰⁸ and produce a functionally active, monovalent lectin.  Conclusions:   PSA is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease secreted by the prostatic epithelium and normally functions in liquefaction of semen following ejaculation. Furthermore, PSA is implicated in the promotion of localized prostate tumors and bone metastases by its roles in immunomodulation, invasion, and apoptosis.

PCa screening would benefit from additional biomarkers of higher specificity and could be used in conjunction with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, in order to better determine biopsy candidates.  Methods:   We used urine sediments after prostate massage (PM) from 215 consecutive patients, who presented for prostate biopsy. We tested whether prostate-specific G-protein coupled receptor (PSGR), a biomarker previously described to be over-expressed in PCa tissue, could also be detected by quantitative real-time PCR in post-PM urine sediment. We combined these findings with prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3), the current gold standard for PCa diagnosis in urine, to test if a combination of both biomarkers could improve the sensitivity of PCA3 alone.  Results:   By univariate analysis we found that PSGR and PCA3 were significant predictors of PCa. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis and its multivariate extension, multivariate ROC (MultiROC), were used to assess the outcome predictive values of the individual and the paired biomarkers. We obtained the following area under the curve values: PSA (0.602), PSGR (0.681), PCA3 (0.656), and PSGRvPCA3 (0.729). Then, we tested whether a combination of PSGR and PCA3 could improve specificity by fixing the sensitivity at 95%. We obtained specificities of 15% (PSGR), 17% (PCA3), and 34% (PSGRvPCA3).  Conclusions:   A multiplexed model including PSGR and PCA3 improves the specificity for the detection of PCa, especially in the area of high sensitivity.

In human prostate cancer, matriptase expression correlates with progression. It is therefore of interest to determine how matriptase may contribute to epithelial neoplastic progression. One approach for studying this is to identify potential matriptase substrates involved in epithelial integrity and/or transformation like the extracellular matrix macromolecule, laminin-332 (Ln-332), which is found in the basement membrane of many epithelia, including prostate. Proteolytic processing of Ln-332 regulates cell motility of both normal and transformed cells, which has implications in cancer progression.  Methods:   In vitro cleavage experiments were performed with purified Ln-332 protein and matriptase. Western blotting, enzyme inhibition assays, and mass spectrometry were used to confirm cleavage events. Matriptase overexpressing LNCaP prostate cancer cells were generated and included in Transwell migration assays and single cell motility assays, along with other prostate cells.  Results:   We report that matriptase proteolytically cleaves Ln-332 in the β3 chain. Substrate specificity was confirmed by blocking cleavage with the matriptase inhibitor, Kunitz domain-1. Transwell migration assays showed that DU145 cell motility was significantly enhanced when plated on matriptase-cleaved Ln-332. Similarly, Transwell migration of matriptase-overexpressing LNCaP cells was significantly increased on Ln-332 and, as determined by live single-cell microscopy, two motility parameters of this cell line, speed and directional persistence, were also higher.  Conclusions:   Proteolytic processing of Ln-332 by matriptase enhances speed and directional persistence of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Manisha Tripathi', 'Alka A Potdar', 'Hironobu Yamashita', 'Brandy Weidow', 'Peter T Cummings', 'Daniel Kirchhofer', 'Vito Quaranta']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Laminin-332 is a substrate for hepsin, a protease associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Membrane type-1-matrix metalloproteinase expressed by prostate carcinoma cells cleaves human laminin-5 beta3 chain and induces cell migration.', 'The Kunitz Domain I of Hepatocyte Growth Factor Activator Inhibitor-2 Inhibits Matriptase Activity and Invasive Ability of Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Potent and specific inhibition of the biological activity of the type-II transmembrane serine protease matriptase by the cyclic microprotein MCoTI-II.', 'Matriptase: potent proteolysis on the cell surface.', 'Clinical Significance of Hepsin and Underlying Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Entosis and apical cell extrusion constitute a tumor-suppressive mechanism downstream of Matriptase.', 'Cell surface-anchored serine proteases in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Targeting metastatic breast cancer with peptide epitopes derived from autocatalytic loop of Prss14/ST14 membrane serine protease and with monoclonal antibodies.', 'The extracellular matrix in tumor progression and metastasis.']"""

Methods:   Of 16,934 men participating in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, 1,179 were diagnosed with prostate cancer during an average follow-up of 13.4 years to the end of December 2007. Information on asthma history was obtained at baseline interview. Participants were asked to bring their current medications to the study center. The names of the drugs were entered into a form and coded. Asthma medications were categorized into four groups and corresponding hazard ratios (HR) were estimated from Cox regression models adjusted for country of birth.  Results:   Asthma was associated with a small increase in prostate cancer risk [HR 1.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.05-1.49]. The HRs for use of medications were 1.39 (95% CI, 1.03-1.88) for inhaled glucocorticoids, 1.71 (95% CI, 1.08-2.69) for systemic glucocorticoids, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.05-1.76) for bronchodilators, and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.45-1.35) for antihistamines. The HRs for asthma and asthma medication use changed only slightly after mutual adjustment.  Conclusions:   A history of asthma and the use of asthma medications, particularly systemic glucocorticoids, are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, although it is difficult to disentangle the effects of asthma medications from those of asthma per se.

NK cells in combination with monoclonal antibodies to surface antigens of the tumor cell have been proved to be effective in a number of clinical trials. A limiting step in the development of successful cellular immunotherapy lies in developing an efficient and economic method to expand appropriate amount of NK cells and CD8(+) T cells. In this study, we constructed a humanized IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc, which mimicked IL-15 trans-presentation. The feasibility of expanding populations of the human NK and CD8(+) T cells by IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc complexes was tested. We then measured the cytotoxicity of expanded NK and CD8(+) T cells against tumor cell lines and primary tumor cells. When tested ex vivo, IL-2/IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc complexes significantly enhanced NK and CD8(+) T cells expansion, isolated or non-isolated from PBMCs. The effect of IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc was dependent on the presence of IL-2 or IL-15. IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc complexes increased NK, CD8(+) T and NKT cells ratio in PBMC and BMMC after 14 days incubation. High level of granzyme B expression was observed in the supernatant of the complexes-treated NK cells. Expanded NK and CD8(+) T cell populations had cytotoxic function against the PC3, LNCaP, K562 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient primary B cell lymphoma. We concluded that IL-2/IL-15Ralpha-IgG1-Fc significantly enhanced NK, CD8(+) T and NKT cells expansion, which possess strong anti-tumor activity.

In this study, we investigated the effect of HDL on prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, intracellular cholesterol levels, and the role of cholesterol transporters, namely ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI in these processes. HDL induced cell proliferation and migration of the androgen-independent PC-3 and DU145 cells by a mechanism involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and Akt, but had no effect on the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell, which did not express ABCA1 unlike the other cell lines. Treatment with HDL did not significantly alter the cholesterol content of the cell lines. Knockdown of ABCA1 but not ABCG1 or SR-BI by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited HDL-induced cell proliferation, migration, and ERK1/2 and Akt signal transduction in PC-3 cells. Moreover, after treatment of LNCaP cells with charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, ABCA1 was induced ∼10-fold, enabling HDL to induce ERK1/2 activation, whereas small interfering RNA knockdown of ABCA1 inhibited HDL-induced ERK1/2 activation. Simvastatin, which inhibited ABCA1 expression in PC-3 and DU145 cells, attenuated HDL-induced PC-3 and DU145 cell proliferation, migration, and ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. In human prostate biopsy samples, ABCA1 mRNA expression was ∼2-fold higher in the androgen deprivation therapy group than in subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia or pretreatment prostate cancer groups. In summary, these results suggest that HDL by an ABCA1-dependent mechanism can mediate signal transduction, leading to increased proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Yoshitaka Sekine', 'Steve J Demosky', 'John A Stonik', 'Yosuke Furuya', 'Hidekazu Koike', 'Kazuhiro Suzuki', 'Alan T Remaley']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Lycopene and the LXRα agonist T0901317 synergistically inhibit the proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via the PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1 pathway.', 'Androgenic suppression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 expression in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Ligand, receptor, and cell type-dependent regulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA in prostate cancer epithelial cells.', 'ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1, HDL metabolism, cholesterol efflux, and inflammation: important targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis.', 'Lipid efflux by the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1.', 'HDL as Bidirectional Lipid Vectors: Time for New Paradigms.', 'ABCA1 is associated with the development of acquired chemotherapy resistance and predicts poor ovarian cancer outcome.', 'Suppression of the ABCA1 Cholesterol Transporter Impairs the Growth and Migration of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'Mechanistic Insights Delineating the Role of Cholesterol in Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition and Drug Resistance in Cancer.', 'Expression of SR-B1 receptor in breast cancer cell lines, MDAMB-468 and MCF-7: Effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis.']"""

Methods:   This prospective study included 2263 patient episodes of suspected deep vein thrombosis, which were excluded radiologically.

Results:   D-dimer levels greater than 4000 ng FEU/ml (4.9% of patients), and greater than 8000 ng FEU/ml (1.8%) were associated with a reduced overall survival. D-dimer levels greater than 8000 ng FEU/ml and age over 60 years were independent poor prognostic factors for overall survival (p<0.001.). D-dimer levels greater than 8000 ng FEU/ml were associated with an increased incidence of malignancy (p=0.003).  Conclusions:   This study provides evidence of very high D-dimer levels in patients with cancer who do not have VTE.

These tumoral LH-RH receptors mediate the direct cytotoxic effects of LH-RH analogs and are potential therapeutic targets. Although pituitary LH-RH receptors are downregulated following prolonged exposure to LH-RH agonists, there is no evidence that tumoral receptors behave in a similar manner. To better characterize expression of tumoral LH-RH receptors, specimens of prostate cancer from various cohorts of patients were analyzed.  Experimental design:   Surgical specimens were obtained from untreated patients with prostate cancer and from patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with bilateral orchiectomy. To address the possibility of receptor downregulation, two additional cohorts of patients who had been previously treated with LH-RH agonists were included. One group received neoadjuvant therapy prior to prostatectomy, and the other group was treated for metastatic disease with LH-RH agonists and, at progression, required palliative resection of the prostate. Lymph node metastases from previously untreated patients were subjected to similar analysis.  Results:   Expression of LH-RH receptors was found in most specimens. The relative expression of LH-RH receptor mRNA in untreated patients was greater in patients whose tumor had received a Gleason score <8.  Conclusions:   LH-RH receptor expression persisted despite prolonged exposure to LH-RH agonists.

A pilot project, funded by the Centers for Disease Control National Project for Cancer Registries in 2004, brought 4 pathology services in 3 states, with differing baseline implementations of the checklists, the opportunity to partner with their state National Project for Cancer Registry and their laboratory information system vendors to evaluate the feasibility of using electronically encoded College of American Pathologists cancer checklists for melanoma and tumors of the breast and prostate.  Objectives:   To identify existing and potential barriers to adoption of electronically encoded checklists and to also identify unique benefits not associated with text-only uses of the checklists.  Design:   Participants mapped an implementation process from their current state to an electronic checklist-capable state. For a sample of cases of melanoma, prostate, and breast cancers, the checklist elements were captured and transmitted to the registry using Health Level 7 (version 2.3.1). Process assessments with adoption of electronic checklists were conducted to assess pathologist effect and other potential barriers. An evaluation of the utility and usefulness of electronic checklists was performed after the project.  Results:   All 4 laboratories successfully performed the capture of individual data elements from the College of American Pathologists checklist into a discrete format suitable for electronic transmission. The effect on pathologist performance and laboratory workflow was neutral. Points of resistance were identified in the checklists and in individual users. Specific challenges in individual laboratories varied according to the personnel and the baseline system in use. Clinical responses to implemented changes were generally positive. Analysis of the postproject experiences of the laboratories showed expansion of use and additional utility in some, but not all, laboratories.  Conclusions:   Pathology laboratory adoption of the College of American Pathologists cancer checklists in an electronic format suited to direct transmission to cancer registries poses business case, information technology, and human resource challenges. Laboratory information system vendor readiness to upgrade systems to facilitate this process helps to reduce some of these challenges. Personalities and preferences in practices may yet pose barriers to widespread adoption.""","""['Lewis A Hassell', 'Anil V Parwani', 'Lawrence Weiss', 'Michael A Jones', 'Jay Ye']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Arch Pathol Lab Med""","""['Electronic capture and communication of synoptic cancer data elements from pathology reports: results of the Reporting Pathology Protocols 2 (RPP2) project.', 'Adequacy of surgical pathology reporting of cancer: a College of American Pathologists Q-Probes study of 86 institutions.', 'Intralaboratory timeliness of surgical pathology reports.

We identified 668 patients with thymoma from the Swedish Cancer Registry, and 2,719 population-based matched controls. We obtained information on autoimmunity from the nationwide inpatient/outpatient hospital discharge Registry. We constructed Kaplan-Meier curves for survival analysis, conditional regression and Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between thymoma and autoimmune diseases, and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) to evaluate the risk for second cancers following thymoma. Compared with controls, patients with benign or malignant thymoma had a poorer (p < 0.001) 5-year (79%, 53% vs. 91%), 10-year (65%, 39% vs. 78%) and 20-year (43%, 18% vs. 55%) overall survival. For thymoma patients, younger age at diagnosis and being diagnosed in recent years were associated with a better survival. Compared with controls, thymoma patients were more likely to have an autoimmune disease at some point during their lives (32.7% vs. 2.4%, respectively, p < 0.001), most frequently myasthenia gravis (24.5%), systemic lupus erythematosus (2.4%) and red cell aplasia (1.2%). Thymoma patients had twofold excess risk for second cancers compared with the general population, most notably: non-melanoma skin cancer (SIR = 10.6, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 6.0-17.3), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 6.8, 95% CI = 3.00-13.0), and cervical (SIR = 6.9, 95% CI = 1.4-20.1), endocrine (SIR = 4.7, 95% CI = 1.3-12.0), and prostate cancer (SIR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.7-4.8). Despite the improved survival for thymoma patients over time, they have worse survival than controls.

In yeast, Sec62 participates in the post-translational translocation of proteins into the ER, but its function in mammals remains elusive. Previously we described the amplification and over-expression of the SEC62 gene in prostate cancer cell lines and the protein has been described as a potential target gene in prostate cancer. In the current study we show that in the tumor tissue of prostate cancer patients Sec62 protein levels are elevated compared with tumor-free tissue derived from the same patients or from prostates of control group patients and that the higher Sec62 protein content correlates with an increasing de-differentiation of the cells. Therefore, up-regulation of Sec62 protein content indeed is a phenomenon associated with prostate cancer progression. Analysis of a multi-tissue tumor array showed that in addition to prostate cancer, overproduction of Sec62 is observed in various other tumors, most significantly in tumors of the lung and the thyroid. To examine the tumor-related functions of Sec62, we silenced the SEC62 gene in the prostate cancer cell-line PC3 as well as in a set of other tumor cell-lines with two different siRNAs. In general, after silencing of SEC62 the cell migration and the invasive potential of the cells was blocked or at least dramatically reduced while cell viability was hardly affected.

Methodology/principal findings:   We show that depletion of p120ctn by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in DU145 prostate cancer and MCF10A breast epithelial cells reduces the expression levels of the adherens junction proteins, E-cadherin, P-cadherin, beta-catenin and alpha-catenin, and induces loss of cell-cell adhesion. p120ctn-depleted cells also have increased migration speed and invasion, which correlates with increased Rap1 but not Rac1 or RhoA activity. Downregulation of P-cadherin, beta-catenin and alpha-catenin but not E-cadherin induces a loss of cell-cell adhesion, increased migration and enhanced invasion similar to p120ctn depletion. However, only p120ctn depletion leads to a decrease in the levels of other adherens junction proteins.

Besides pressing epidemiologic questions, the elucidation of the tissue and cell tropism of the virus, as well as its sensitivity to retroviral restriction factors is of fundamental importance. The Apobec3 (A3) proteins, a family of cytidine deaminases, are one important group of host proteins that control primary infection and efficient viral spread.  Methodology/principal findings:   Here we demonstrate that XMRV is resistant to human Apobec 3B, 3C and 3F, while being highly susceptible to the human A3G protein, a factor which is known to confer antiviral activity against most retroviruses. We show that XMRV as well as MoMLV virions package Apobec proteins independent of their specific restriction activity. hA3G was found to be a potent inhibitor of XMRV as well as of MoMLV infectivity. In contrast to MoMLV, XMRV infection can also be partially reduced by low concentrations of mA3. Interestingly, established prostate cancer cell lines, which are highly susceptible to XMRV infection, do not or only weakly express hA3G.  Conclusions:   Our findings confirm and extend recently published data that show restriction of XMRV infection by hA3G. The results will be of value to explore which cells are infected with XMRV and efficiently support viral spread in vivo.

Most oligos employed by investigators include only a single mRNA-binding site, and target only a single gene. However, some target multiple genes which share sequence homology. Recently, our lab has developed bispecific oligos, which target two different genes not related by sequence homology, and which are able to regulate activity in either the same or in different biological pathways. To date, the effectiveness of bispecific oligos has been evaluated solely by in vitro cell growth inhibition studies. This study evaluates the suppression of targeted mRNA by both mono- and bispecific oligos directed towards the apoptosis regulatory protein BCL-2. The bispecifics used contain binding sites for both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and BCL-2 mRNA and differ only in the 5' to 3' tandem orientation. LNCaP cells incubated for 24 hours in the presence of 6.25 muM of oligos suppress the expression of BCL-2 mRNA and support the finding that there is comparable biologic activity produced by both mono- and bispecific oligos in in vitro cell inhibition experiments. For each type of oligo (mono- or bispecific) evaluated, the greatest amount of BCL-2 mRNA suppression approached 100% as produced by the monospecific MR(4) (directed only against BCL-2) and for the bispecifics MR2(4) and MR(42), 86% and 100%, respectively. Suppression was found in duplicate PCR runs employing BCL-2 primers, as well as in multiple agarose gel quantifications. Based upon both inhibition of in vitro growth and bCL-2 expression measured by PCR, we conclude that bispecific antisense oligos directed against both EGFR and BCL-2 mRNAs are at least as effective as a monospecific oligo directed solely towards BCL-2. Therefore the addition of a second mRNA-binding site to these oligos does not prevent activity at the initial site specific for BCL-2.""","""['Marvin Rubenstein', 'Patrick Guinan']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""In Vivo""","""['Effects of BCL-2 suppression by antisense oligonucleotides on additional regulators of apoptosis compensatory change in non-targeted protein expression.', 'Bispecific antisense oligonucleotides with multiple binding sites for the treatment of prostate tumors and their applicability to combination therapy.', 'Synthesis of branched antisense oligonucleotides having multiple specificities.

Conclusion:   Because of the greater biologic potency of DIM when studied in parallel with I3C in vitro, this extent of dimerization shows that DIM rather than I3C is the active agent in cell culture studies.""","""['H L Bradlow', 'M A Zeligs']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""In Vivo""","""['Review.

Introduction of structural modifications yielded compound M-110, which inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines with IC(50)s of 0.6 to 0.9 μmol/L, with no activity on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells up to 40 μmol/L. Screening of 261 recombinant kinases and subsequent analysis revealed that M-110 is a selective inhibitor of the PIM kinase family, with preference for PIM-3. The prostate cancer cell line DU-145 and the pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa2 constitutively express activated STAT3 (pSTAT3(Tyr705)). Treatment of DU-145 cells with M-110 or with a structurally unrelated PIM inhibitor, SGI-1776, significantly reduces pSTAT3(Tyr705) expression without affecting the expression of STAT3. Furthermore, treatment of DU-145 cells with M-110 attenuates the interleukin-6-induced increase in pSTAT3(Tyr705). To determine which of the three PIM kinases is most likely to inhibit expression of pSTAT3(Tyr705), we used PIM-1-, PIM-2-, or PIM-3-specific siRNA and showed that knockdown of PIM-3, but not of PIM-1 or PIM-2, in DU-145 cells results in a significant downregulation of pSTAT3(Tyr705). The phosphorylation of STAT5 on Tyr694 in 22Rv1 cells is not affected by M-110 or SGI-1776, suggesting specificity for pSTAT3(Tyr705). These results identify a novel role for PIM-3 kinase as a positive regulator of STAT3 signaling and suggest that PIM-3 inhibitors cause growth inhibition of cancer cells by downregulating the expression of pSTAT3(Tyr705).""","""['Marisa Chang', 'Nisha Kanwar', 'Eric Feng', 'Allan Siu', 'Xiujie Liu', 'Dawei Ma', 'Jan Jongstra']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Pharmacologic inhibition of Pim kinases alters prostate cancer cell growth and resensitizes chemoresistant cells to taxanes.', 'PIM kinase isoform specific regulation of MIG6 expression and EGFR signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'AZD1208, a Pan-Pim Kinase Inhibitor, Has Anti-Growth Effect on 93T449 Human Liposarcoma Cells via Control of the Expression and Phosphorylation of Pim-3, mTOR, 4EBP-1, S6, STAT-3 and AMPK.', 'Potential Pharmacological Inhibitors of Pim Kinase Under Clinical Trials.', 'Mechanism-based combinations with Pim kinase inhibitors in cancer treatments.', 'ZAP70 Activation Compensates for Loss of Class IA PI3K Isoforms Through Activation of the JAK-STAT3 Pathway.', 'Stomatin-like Protein 2 Promotes Tumor Cell Survival by Activating the JAK2-STAT3-PIM1 Pathway, Suggesting a Novel Therapy in CRC.', 'PIM kinase inhibition: co-targeted therapeutic approaches in prostate cancer.', 'The kinase polypharmacology landscape of clinical PARP inhibitors.', 'Leflunomide Synergizes with Gemcitabine in Growth Inhibition of PC Cells and Impairs c-Myc Signaling through PIM Kinase Targeting.']"""

Once cancer metastasizes from the breast or prostate to other tissues of the body, therapies are limited, and there is no cure for the diseases. Currently used screening modalities for breast and prostate cancers have limitations. Routine screening for breast cancer includes clinical breast exams and mammograms. Improvements in imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance, ultrasound, digital breast tomosynthesis and ductography are being explored as adjuncts to mammography. A new approach to breast cancer screening involves the detection of abnormalities at the cellular level and uses various means to collect cellular material from the ductal system, including nipple aspirate fluid, breast ductal lavage, fiberoptic ductoscopy and random periareolar fine needle aspiration. Current screening methods for prostate cancer include digital rectal exam and serum PSA levels. However, these methods offer low sensitivity and specificity and do not allow differentiation between significant- and minimal-risk cancers. New approaches to prostate cancer screening involve different calculations using PSA, as well as molecular urine tests. With the recent advances in microarray technologies and whole-genome sequencing of tumors, the identification of specific biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as new therapeutic targets, is quickly paving the way for personalized medicine.

The prominence of observations with no expenditure for some short periods of observation and the extreme skewness typical of these data raise concerns about the robustness of estimators based on inverse probability weighting (IPW) with the survival from censoring probabilities. These estimators also cannot distinguish between the effects of covariates on survival and intensity of utilization, which jointly determine costs. In this paper, we propose a new estimator that extends the class of two-part models to deal with random right censoring and for continuous death and censoring times. Our model also addresses issues about the time to death in these analyses and separates the survival effects from the intensity effects. Using simulations, we compare our proposed estimator to the inverse probability estimator, which shows bias when censoring is large and covariates affect survival. We find our estimator to be unbiased and also more efficient for these designs.

Two groups of males over 60-years old were compared: a control group that included 180 healthy males, 45 suffering from benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and a study group of 127 males with prostate cancer: 67 who received complete androgen block treatment, and 60 who received different treatments or none at all. CT head scans were used to identify and classify HFI (Brilliance 64, Philips Medical Systems, slice thickness 3 mm x 1.5 mm). It was found that males who received a complete androgen block manifested significantly higher prevalence of HFI compared to healthy males. However, no significant difference in HFI prevalence was found between males suffering from BPH and healthy males or males with prostate cancer who had not received a complete androgen block. A positive association between length of hormonal treatment and manifestation of HFI was shown. It can be concluded that BPH does not promote development of HFI; males who are hormonally treated for prostate cancer are at a higher risk of developing HFI compared to healthy males; the longer the duration of hormonal treatment, the higher the risk of developing HFI.""","""['Hila May', 'Natan Peled', 'Gali Dar', 'Janan Abbas', 'Bahaa Medlej', 'Youssef Masharawi', 'Israel Hershkovitz']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Anat Rec (Hoboken)""","""['Hyperostosis frontalis interna: what does it tell us about our health?', 'Intracranial volume, cranial thickness, and hyperostosis frontalis interna in the elderly.', 'Hyperostosis frontalis interna: an anthropological perspective.', 'Micro-computed Tomography Study of Frontal Bones in Males and Females with Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna.', 'Hyperostosis frontalis interna: case report and review of literature.', 'Hyperostosis fronto-parietalis - radiology mimic of metastasis: A case report.', 'Estimated maximal and current brain volume predict cognitive ability in old age.', 'Influence of thickening of the inner skull table on intracranial volume measurement in older people.', 'Hyperostosis frontalis interna (HFI) and castration: the case of the famous singer Farinelli (1705-1782).']"""

Local factors in bone stromal extracellular matrix microenvironment affect tumor growth through paracrine interactions between tumor and stromal cells.  Methods:   Using co-culture and medium transfer, we used several methods to assess interactions between PCa and bone stromal cells using three PCa cell lines: PC3, LNCaP, and the LNCaP derivative, C4-2B.  Results:   Co-culture of LNCaP and C4-2B cells with bone marrow stromal cell lines, HS27a and HS5, decreased cell number, as did culture with conditioned medium (CM) harvested from these two cell lines suggesting a soluble paracrine factor was responsible. PC3 cell growth was unaffected. CM harvested from bone stromal cell lines triggered apoptosis in LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, but not in PC3 cells. Surviving C4-2B cells grown in bone stromal cell CM over several days were growth arrested, suggesting presence of a growth inhibitor. Apoptosis induced by CM was dose-dependent. Flow cytometry demonstrated that over a 5-day culture period in stromal cell CM, LNCaP, and C4-2B cell lines, but not PC3 cells, underwent greater apoptosis than parallel cultures in SF medium. The LNCaP and C4-2B cells showed morphology and biomarker expression consistent with transdifferentiation towards a neuroendocrine phenotype after exposure to stromal cell CM.  Conclusions:   The reactive bone stromal microenvironment initially is hostile to PCa cells producing widespread apoptosis.

Currently, there are no effective treatments for this form of the disease with Docetaxel only providing a small survival advantage. In this study, the effects of novel derivatives of titanocene dichloride on prostate cancer cell lines has been investigated.  Methods:   Cellular effects were assessed using the crystal violet assay and the clonogenic survival assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed by propidium iodide staining. DNA damage was analyzed by comet assay and Western analysis. DNA damage response inhibition was achieved by pre-incubation with an ATM/ATR inhibitor; CGK733 and DNA-PK inhibitor; DMNB.  Results:   These analogs caused a reduction in cell number. In particular titanocene Y and C had significant effects in all cell lines. A reduction in clonogenic survival was found in response to titanocene Y in three cell lines while the PC-3 cells exhibited increased resistance.Further analysis showed no effect on cell cycle however, the analogs were found to induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines. These analogs associate with DNA, induce DNA damage and a differential damage response. Inhibition of key regulators of this DNA damage response sensitized the PC-3 cell line to titanocene-induced apoptosis and significantly reduced the clonogenic capacity of the cells.

Inclusion criteria included men with advanced prostate cancer and the presence of moderate to severe fatigue. Patients with major depression, hypothyroidism, uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, or anemia were excluded. Fatigue levels, blood pressure, pulse, and other safety concerns were monitored regularly.  Results:   Thirty-two subjects were randomized to methylphenidate (n=16) or placebo (n=16). Brief Fatigue Inventory total scores significantly decreased for both groups; however, the methylphenidate group, as compared with placebo, reported greater decrease on Brief Fatigue Inventory severity scores (P=.03) and a trend toward greater decrease on Brief Fatigue Inventory total scores (P=.07). A significantly greater number of subjects in the methylphenidate group versus the placebo group demonstrated clinically significant improvement in fatigue on total Brief Fatigue Inventory scores (7 of 10 vs 3 of 13) and Brief Fatigue Inventory severity scores (8 of 10 vs 3 of 13). Importantly, 6 subjects in the methylphenidate group discontinued because of increased blood pressure or tachycardia. There were no serious adverse events.

In both groups the highest number of patients was in the 60 t0 79 age bracket (48 in group A , 70%, and 56 in group B (78%). Bladder blockage occurred in 32(47%) patients without packing and none (0%) in group B with packing. Average duration of bladder drainage was 14 days in each group. There was no persisting vesico-cutaneous fistula. Temporary urinary incontinence occurred in three (3%) patients who had no packing and in five (7%) with packing.

For this purpose mononuclear cells were separated from blood using differential centrifugation and then prostate cells were identified by using standard immunocytochemical method. Results indicated that among 409 men screened for prostate cancer 16.6% were positive for circulating prostate cells. Cells were positive for MMP-2 and HER-2 in 100 and 14.3% of cases, respectively, without an association with age or PSA levels.

An additional complication in these patients, that further affects the bones, is that their hormonal treatment, induces osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates (bpns) are standard drugs against osteoporosis and have been shown to have clinically significant anti-tumor effects. This study describes the development of a new polybisphosphonate conjugate (ODX) with enhanced dual efficacy i.e. with anti-bone resorption and anti-tumor properties. Zoledronic acid (Zometa) was used as a positive control (at equimolar concentrations). Alendronic acid and aminoguanidine were conjugated to oxidized dextran with subsequent reductive amination (on average approximately 8 alendronate and approximately 50 guanidine moieties per conjugate). ODX was tested in a bone resorption assay for its capacity to inhibit bone resorbing osteoclasts (bone organ culture from neonatal mice, 45Ca labelled bone mineral). Tumor cell toxicity was studied on prostate (PC3) and breast cancer (MDA231, MDA453) cell cultures. Two methods were employed, a fluorescent cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) and an apoptosis assay (Annexin V assay). In the bone resorption assay, Zometa and ODX showed very similar potency with 50% osteoclast inhibition at approximately 20 nM and 100% at 0.2 microM. In the FMCA, IC50 for ODX was at approximately 2 microM and 25 microM for Zometa (PC3). In the apoptosis assay, ODX induced approximately 85-97% apoptosis at 10 microM in both cell lines, while Zometa failed to induce any significant apoptosis in any of the cell lines at the tested concentration range (10 nM-10 microM). ODX appears to be a promising drug candidate with high dual efficacy for the treatment of bone metastasis and osteoporosis. It has both potent osteoclast inhibiting properties and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.""","""['Anders R Holmberg', 'Ulf H Lerner', 'Ayodele A Alayia', 'Mai Al-Mohanna', 'Chaker Adra', 'Marcela Marquez', 'Lennart Meurling', 'Sten Nilsson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Optimising treatment of bone metastases by Aredia(TM) and Zometa(TM).', 'Toward new horizons: the future of bisphosphonate therapy.', 'Preclinical studies with zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates: impact on the bone microenvironment.', 'Clinical efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in prostate and breast cancer.', 'The potential role of bisphosphonates in prostate cancer.', 'New Progress in Improving the Delivery Methods of Bisphosphonates in the Treatment of Bone Tumors.', 'Targeting anti-cancer agents to bone using bisphosphonates.', 'Bisphosphonate conjugation for bone specific drug targeting.', 'Development of Bone Targeting Drugs.', 'Local delivery of alendronate eluting chitosan scaffold can effectively increase osteoblast functions and inhibit osteoclast differentiation.']"""

The immunoreactivity of these proteins was stratified on a scale of 0 to 3 and was correlated with the pathologic features of prostate adenocarcinoma.  Results:   High expression of S100A2 was observed in the tissue of patients with BPH, whereas low or no expression was observed in prostate cancer (CaP) cells. The protein level of S100A4 was significantly higher in CaP than in BPH cells. The higher level of S100A4 observed in CaP tissue correlated with increasing tumor grade.  Conclusions:   Decreased expression of S100A2 and increased expression of S100A4 may be important in the progression of CaP. This finding could aid in identifying aggressive CaP.

A statistical model based on a panel of four kallikreins has been shown to predict the outcome of a first prostate biopsy. In this study, we apply the model to an independent data set of men with previous negative biopsy but persistently elevated PSA.  Methods:   The study cohort consisted of 925 men with a previous negative prostate biopsy and elevated PSA (>or=3 ng ml(-1)), with 110 prostate cancers detected (12%). A previously published statistical model was applied, with recalibration to reflect the lower positive biopsy rates on rebiopsy.  Results:   The full-kallikrein panel had higher discriminative accuracy than PSA and DRE alone, with area under the curve (AUC) improving from 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52, 0.64) to 0.68 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.74), P<0.001, and high-grade cancer (Gleason >or=7) at biopsy with AUC improving from 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.89) to 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.94), P=0.003). Application of the panel to 1000 men with persistently elevated PSA after initial negative biopsy, at a 15% risk threshold would reduce the number of biopsies by 712; would miss (or delay) the diagnosis of 53 cancers, of which only 3 would be Gleason 7 and the rest Gleason 6 or less.

Materials and methods:   This prospective study was approved by the local research ethics committee, and all patients gave written informed consent. Twenty-nine patients (mean age, 69.1 years; range, 56-80 years) with biopsy-proved prostate cancer underwent two DCE CT examinations within 1 week prior to radiation therapy. Parameter maps of transfer constant (K(trans)), the fraction of blood plasma (v(p)), the fraction of extravascular extracellular space (v(e)), and the flux rate constant between the extravascular extracellular space and plasma (k(ep)) were calculated at 15 different image resolutions, with kernel sizes ranging from 0.002 to 2.57 cm(3). Statistical analysis to quantify the voxel-wise repeatability was performed by using a Bland-Altman analysis on all tracer kinetic model parameter maps of each patient. From this analysis, the within-voxel standard deviation (wSD) was calculated as a function of spatial resolution.  Results:   A kernel size in the range of 0.1-0.3 cm(3) yields reliable information. At 0.15 cm(3), the median wSDs of K(trans), k(ep), v(p), and v(e) are 0.047 min(-1), 0.144 min(-1), 0.011, and 0.104, respectively. With increasing kernel size, these values reach stable levels of approximately 0.02 min(-1), 0.05 min(-1), 0.005, and 0.05, respectively.  Conclusion:   There is a high voxel-wise repeatability of the DCE CT imaging technique for prostate cancer for kernel sizes as small as 0.1 cm(3).

Such variation could confound efforts to correlate expression with clinical parameters. In principle, the proportion of each major tissue component can be estimated from the profiling data and used to triage samples before studying correlations with disease parameters. Four large gene expression microarray data sets from prostate cancer, whose tissue components were estimated by pathologists, were used to test the performance of multivariate linear regression models for in silico prediction of major tissue components. Ten-fold cross-validation within each data set yielded average differences between the pathologists' predictions and the in silico predictions of 8% to 14% for the tumor component and 13% to 17% for the stroma component. Across independent data sets that used similar platforms and fresh frozen samples, the average differences were 11% to 12% for tumor and 12% to 17% for stroma. When the models were applied to 219 arrays of ""tumor-enriched"" samples in the literature, almost one quarter were predicted to have 30% or less tumor cells. Furthermore, there was a 10.5% difference in the average predicted tumor content between 37 recurrent and 42 nonrecurrent cancer patients. As a result, genes that correlated with tissue percentage generally also correlated with recurrence. If such a correlation is not desired, then some samples might be removed to rebalance the data set or tissue percentages might be incorporated into the prediction algorithm.

However, the CTC analysis platforms commonly used cannot capture live CTCs and only apply to tumors of epithelial origin. To address these limitations, we have developed a novel cancer detection platform which measures telomerase activity from live CTCs captured on a parylene-C slot microfilter. Using a constant low-pressure delivery system, the new microfilter platform was capable of cell capture from 1 mL of whole blood in less than 5 minutes, achieving 90% capture efficiency, 90% cell viability, and 200-fold sample enrichment. Importantly, the captured cells retained normal morphology by scanning electron microscopy and could be readily manipulated, further analyzed, or expanded on- or off-filter. Telomerase activity--a well-recognized universal cancer marker--was reliably detected by quantitative PCR from as few as 25 cancer cells added into 7.5 mL of whole blood and captured on the microfilter. Moreover, significant telomerase activity elevation was also measured from patients' blood samples and from single cancer cells lifted off of the microfilter.

Reverse transcription and PCR were used to examine the expression of these genes in normal prostate epithelial and stromal cell lines, k-ras-transformed prostate epithelial cell lines, and in four prostate cancer cell lines. Secreted and cell-associated OXT peptide was measured by an enzyme immunoassay. OXT and its receptor (OXTR) were expressed in all eight prostate cell lines. Cell-associated OXT peptide was also found in all prostate epithelial cell lines except in DU145 cells. Neither AVP nor its cognate receptors (V1a receptor and V2 receptor) were expressed in any prostate cell line examined. These data point to the OXTR as the primary target of OXT and AVP, and suggest that OXT might be an autocrine/paracrine regulator in human prostate. We found that OXT induces the migration of PC3 and PC3M, but not DU145 prostate cancer cells. The effect of OXT is distinct from the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced migration of prostate cancer cells, in which ERK1/2 and EGF receptor kinase activities were required. When cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin, the effect of OXT, but not EGF, on cell migration was abolished. Pretreatment with the cyclic AMP analogue, 8-Br-cAMP, did not affect OXT-induced cell migration, which eliminated the nonspecific effect of pertussis toxin.

Previous studies have shown the capability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to target these disseminated tumor cells and to serve as therapeutic delivery vehicles. However, the molecular mechanisms that would enhance the migration of MSCs toward tumor areas are not well understood. In particular, very little is known about the role that epigenetic mechanisms play in cell migration and tropism of MSCs. In this study, we investigated whether histone deacetylation was involved in the repression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) expression in MSCs derived from umbilical cord blood (CB) and bone marrow (BM). Induction of uPA expression by histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A and sodium butyrate was observed in CB- and BM-derived MSCs examined. In vitro migration assays showed that induction of uPA expression by histone deacetylase inhibitors in CB- and BM-derived MSCs significantly enhanced tumor tropism of these cells. Furthermore, overexpression of uPA in CB-MSCs induced migration capacity toward human cancer cells in vitro. In addition, our results showed that uPA-uPAR knockdown in PC3 prostate cancer cells significantly inhibited tumor-specific migration of uPA-overexpressing MSCs.

In a previous report, we demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive cytoplasmic hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha), in both benign and malignant NE prostate cells. HIF1alpha and HIF1beta are two subunits of HIF1, a transcription factor important for angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the cytoplasmic stabilization of HIF1alpha in androgen independent NE differentiated prostate cancer is due to the presence of certain HIF1alpha isoforms.  Methods:   We studied the HIF1alpha isoforms present in 8 cases of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and 43 cases of prostate cancer with and without NE differentiation using RT-PCR, sequencing analysis, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.  Results:   We identified multiple isoforms in both benign and malignant prostate tissues. One of these isoforms, HIF1alpha1.2, which was previously reported to be testis specific, was found in 86% of NE-differentiated prostate tumors, 92% of HIF1alpha immunoreactive prostate tumors and 100% of cases of benign prostate hyperplasia. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization results showed that this isoform corresponds to the cytoplasmic HIF1alpha present in androgen-independent NE cells of benign and malignant prostate tissue and co-localizes with immunoreactive cytoplasmic HIF1beta.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that the cytoplasmic stabilization of HIF1alpha in NE-differentiated cells in benign and malignant prostate tissue is due to presence of an HIF1alpha isoform, HIF1alpha1.2. Co-localization of this isoform with HIF1beta indicates that the HIF1alpha1.2 isoform might sequester HIF1beta in the cytoplasm.""","""['Nastaran Monsef', 'Maria Soller', 'Ioannis Panagopoulos', 'Per Anders Abrahamsson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Localization of immunoreactive HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in neuroendocrine cells of both benign and malignant prostate glands.', 'Expression of c-kit and kit-ligand in benign and malignant prostatic tissues.', 'The expression of pluripotency marker Oct 3/4 in prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Neuroendocrine cells in benign and malignant prostate tissue: morphogenesis, proliferation, and androgen receptor status.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Human Red Blood Cells Modulate Cytokine Expression in Monocytes/Macrophages Under Anoxic Conditions.', 'Aberrant expression of alternative isoforms of transcription factors in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Foxp3 enhances HIF-1α target gene expression in human bladder cancer through decreasing its ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation.', 'Normoxic regulation of HIF-1α in prostate cancer.', 'The role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α in determining the properties of castrate-resistant prostate cancers.']"""

Our previous studies have demonstrated that beta-elemene exhibits strong inhibitory activity in ovarian cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of beta-elemene on prostate cancer cells as well as other types of tumour cells and to determine whether the effect of beta-elemene on prostate cancer cell death was mediated through the induction of apoptosis.  Methods:   The MTT assay was used to evaluate the ability of beta-elemene to inhibit cellular proliferation in cancer cells. Cellular apoptosis was assessed by annexin V binding, TUNEL and ELISA-based assays. Caspase activity was measured using a caspases assay kit. The protein levels of Bcl-2, caspases, cytochrome c and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were analysed by Western blotting.  Key findings:   Here, we showed that beta-elemene had an antiproliferative effect on androgen-insensitive prostate carcinoma DU145 and PC-3 cells. Treatment with beta-elemene also inhibited the growth of brain, breast, cervical, colon and lung carcinoma cells. The effect of beta-elemene on cancer cells was dose dependent, with IC50 values ranging from 47 to 95 microg/ml (230-465 microm). TUNEL assay and flow cytometric analysis using annxin V/propidium iodide staining revealed that the percentage of apoptotic prostate cancer cells was increased by beta-elemene in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, beta-elemene exposure resulted in a decreased Bcl-2 protein level, increased cytochrome c release, and activated PARP and caspase-3, -7, -9, and -10 in prostate cancer cells.

Although distinction between normal endometrial epithelium from adenocarcinoma is usually straightforward, the separation between normal and hyperplastic endometrium, particularly those cases without atypia, can be a diagnostic challenge. The same is true in separation of hyperplastic endometrium with atypia from endometrial-type endometrial adenocarcinoma. Type 2 3alpha-/type 5 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) (AKR1C3) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in androgen, estrogen, progesterone, and pros-taglandin metabolism. Its expression has been shown in the epithelium of the renal tubules, urothelial epithelium, and endothelial cells in normal tissues as well as in prostatic adenocarcinoma. The proliferation and maintenance of endometrial epithelium is dependent on both estrogen and progesterone; and AKR1C3-mediated steroid metabolism may play a critical role in the maintenance of viable normal and abnormal endometrial epithelium. We studied the expression of AKR1C3 in 33 endometrial biopsy specimens including 13 cases of normal proliferative endometrium, 8 cases of hyperplastic endometrium with and without atypia, and 12 cases of primary endometrial adenocarcinoma of endometrial type. We demonstrated a uniform, diffuse, and strong expression of AKR1C3 in normal endometrial epithelium but not in endometrial stromal cells. In contrast, the expression of AKR1C3 is reduced in both hyperplastic and carcinomatous endometrial epithelium. These findings suggest that AKR1C3 may play important roles in the physiology of endometrial cells and that suppressed AKR1C3 expression may represent a feature that allows differentiation of hyperplastic and neoplastic endometrial epithelium from normal endometrial epithelium. However, reduced AKR1C3 expression cannot distinguish hyperplastic endometrium from endometrial adenocarcinoma of endometrial type. The biologic and pathological roles of AKR1C3 in endometrial epithelium require further investigation.""","""['Vladislav Zakharov', 'Hsueh-Kung Lin', 'Joseph Azzarello', 'Scott McMeekin', 'Kathleen N Moore', 'Trevor M Penning', 'Kar-Ming Fung']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Pathol""","""['Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) is expressed in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma but not small cell carcinoma.', 'Differential expression of type 2 3α/type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C3) in tumors of the central nervous system.', 'Increased expression of type 2 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/type 5 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C3) and its relationship with androgen receptor in prostate carcinoma.', 'Inhibitors of type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C3): overview and structural insights.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgens in endometrial carcinoma: the killer or helper?', 'AKR1C3 Is Associated with Better Survival of Patients with Endometrial Carcinomas.', 'High serum Androgen and Insulin concentrations increase the tendency of Endometrial Carcinoma.', 'Intracrine Regulation of Estrogen and Other Sex Steroid Levels in Endometrium and Non-gynecological Tissues; Pathology, Physiology, and Drug Discovery.', 'The Importance of Steroid Uptake and Intracrine Action in Endometrial and Ovarian Cancers.']"""

Sprouty is downregulated in breast, prostate and liver cancers and appears to function as a tumor suppressor. The role of sprouty in colonic neoplasia, however, has not been investigated. Sprouty-2 protein and mRNA transcripts were significantly upregulated in human colonic adenocarcinomas. Strikingly, the c-Met receptor was also upregulated in tumors with increased sprouty-2. To delineate a potential causal relationship between sprouty-2 and c-Met, K-ras mutant HCT-116 colon cancer cells were transduced with purified TAT-sprouty-2 protein or stably transfected with full-length human sprouty-2 gene. Sprouty-2 upregulation significantly increased cell proliferation by accelerating cell cycle transition. Sprouty-2 transfectants showed strong upregulation of c-Met protein and mRNA transcripts and hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated ERK and Akt phosphorylation and enhanced cell migration and invasion. In contrast, knockdown of c-Met by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion in sprouty-2 transfectants. Further, knockdown of sprouty-2 by siRNA in parental HT-29 and LS-174T colon cancer cells also decreased cell invasion. Sprouty-2 transfectants formed significantly larger tumor xenografts and showed increased proliferation and angiogenesis and suppressed apoptosis. Sprouty-2 tumors metastasized to the liver from cecal orthotopic implants, suggesting that sprouty-2 might also enhance metastatic signals.

Zinc-α-2-glycoprotein (ZAG) and proteasome subunit β-Type 6 (PSMB-6) were found to be up-regulated in the serum of CaP patients with higher grade tumors after 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis analysis. The aim of this study was to investigate if ZAG and PSMB-6 were also overexpressed in prostatic tumor tissue of CaP patients. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on CaP tissue microarrays with samples from 199 patients. Confirmatory gene expression profiling for ZAG and PSMB-6 were performed on 4 cases using Laser Capture Microdissection and TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. ZAG expression in CaP epithelial cells was inversely associated with Gleason grade (benign prostatic hyperplasia>G3>G4/G5). PSMB-6 was not expressed in either tumor or benign epithelium. However, strong PSMB-6 expression was noted in stromal and inflammatory cells. Our results indicate ZAG as a possible predictive marker of Gleason grade. The inverse association between grade and tissue expression with a rising serum protein level is similar to that seen with prostate-specific antigen.

Methods:   We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results system to describe patient characteristics and treatment patterns in the cases of 123 934 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer from 2004 to 2006. Age-standardized treatment rates were calculated in 5-year age strata. Logistic regression was used to quantify the odds ratios (ORs) of men with low- and high-risk disease and the use of radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT).  Results:   Men with a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or lower represent 14% of incident prostate cancer cases. Fifty-four percent of men diagnosed as having prostate cancer and PSA levels lower than 4.0 ng/mL harbor low-risk disease (stage, < or =T2a, PSA level, < or =10 ng/mL, and Gleason score, < or =6), but over 75% of them received RP or RT. Men with screen-detected prostate cancer and PSA values lower than 4 ng/mL were 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-1.62) and 1.39 (95% CI, 1.30-1.49) times more likely to receive RP and RT, respectively, and were less likely to have high-grade disease than men who had non-screen-detected prostate cancer (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60-0.76).  Conclusions:   Most men diagnosed as having prostate cancer with a PSA threshold below 4.0 ng/mL had low-risk disease but underwent aggressive local therapy.

Many potent PBDs contain a C2-endo-exo unsaturated motif associated with the pyrrolo C-ring. The novel compound SG2202 is a PBD dimer containing this motif. SG2285 is a water-soluble prodrug of SG2202 in which two bisulfite groups inactivate the PBD N10-C11 imines. Once the bisulfites are eliminated, the imine moieties can bind covalently in the DNA minor groove, forming an interstrand cross-link. The mean in vitro cytotoxic potency of SG2285 against human tumor cell lines is GI(50) 20 pmol/L. SG2285 is highly efficient at producing DNA interstrand cross-links in cells, but they form more slowly than those produced by SG2202. Cellular sensitivity to SG2285 was primarily dependent on ERCC1 and homologous recombination repair. In primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples, the mean LD(50) was significantly lower than in normal age-matched B and T lymphocytes. Antitumor activity was shown in several human tumor xenograft models, including ovarian, non-small cell lung, prostate, pancreatic, and melanoma, with cures obtained in the latter model with a single dose.

DHEA and EPEA activated cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors in vitro with significant potency, suggesting that they are endocannabinoids. Both LNCaP and PC3 cells expressed CB(1) and CB(2) receptors, and the CB(1)- and CB(2)-selective antagonists, AM281 and AM630, administered separately or together, reduced the anti-proliferative potencies of EPEA and EPA but not of DHEA or DHA in PC3 cells and of EPA but not of EPEA, DHEA or DHA in LNCaP cells. Even so, EPEA and EPA may not have inhibited PC3 or LNCaP cell proliferation via cannabinoid receptors since the anti-proliferative potency of EPEA was well below the potency it displayed as a CB(1) or CB(2) receptor agonist. Indeed, these receptors may mediate a protective effect because the anti-proliferative potency of DHEA in LNCaP and PC3 cells was increased by separate or combined administration of AM281 and AM630. The anandamide-metabolizing enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), was highly expressed in LNCaP but not PC3 cells.

Our findings suggest that the expression of cannabinoid receptors and of FAAH in some tumour cells could well influence the effectiveness of DHA and EPA or their ethanolamide derivatives as anticancer agents.""","""['Iain Brown', 'Maria G Cascio', 'Klaus W J Wahle', 'Reem Smoum', 'Raphael Mechoulam', 'Ruth A Ross', 'Roger G Pertwee', 'Steven D Heys']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['The ω-3 endocannabinoid docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide reduces seizure susceptibility in mice by activating cannabinoid type 1 receptors.', 'Omega-3 PUFA ethanolamides DHEA and EPEA induce autophagy through PPARγ activation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.', 'Anticancer effects of n-3 EPA and DHA and their endocannabinoid derivatives on breast cancer cell growth and invasion.', 'Cannabinoid receptor as a novel target for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in prostate cancer prevention.', 'N-eicosapentaenoyl-ethanolamine decreases the proliferation of psoriatic keratinocytes in a reconstructed psoriatic skin model.', 'Sphingosine Kinases at the Intersection of Pro-Inflammatory LPS and Anti-Inflammatory Endocannabinoid Signaling in BV2 Mouse Microglia Cells.', ""The Plant Derived 3-3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) Behaves as CB2 Receptor Agonist in Prostate Cancer Cellular Models."", 'Need for Methods to Investigate Endocannabinoid Signaling.', 'Anti-Tumorigenic Effect of a Novel Derivative of 2-Hydroxyoleic Acid and the Endocannabinoid Anandamide on Neuroblastoma Cells.']"""

In the current study, we report the preparation of (89)Zr-desferrioxamine B (DFO)-J591, a novel (89)Zr-labeled monoclonal antibody (mAb) construct for targeted immunoPET and quantification of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression in vivo.  Methods:   The in vivo behavior of (89)Zr-chloride, (89)Zr-oxalate, and (89)Zr-DFO was studied using PET. High-level computational studies using density functional theory calculations have been used to investigate the electronic structure of (89)Zr-DFO and probe the nature of the complex in aqueous conditions. (89)Zr-DFO-J591 was characterized both in vitro and in vivo. ImmunoPET in male athymic nu/nu mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP (PSMA-positive) or PC-3 (PSMA-negative) tumors was conducted. The change in (89)Zr-DFO-J591 tissue uptake in response to high- and low-specific-activity formulations in the 2 tumor models was measured using acute biodistribution studies and immunoPET.  Results:   The basic characterization of 3 important reagents-(89)Zr-chloride, (89)Zr-oxalate, and the complex (89)Zr-DFO-demonstrated that the nature of the (89)Zr species dramatically affects the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. Density functional theory calculations provide a rationale for the observed high in vivo stability of (89)Zr-DFO-labeled mAbs and suggest that in aqueous conditions, (89)Zr-DFO forms a thermodynamically stable, 8-coordinate complex by coordination of 2 water molecules. (89)Zr-DFO-J591 was produced in high radiochemical yield (>77%) and purity (>99%), with a specific activity of 181.7 +/- 1.1 MBq/mg (4.91 +/- 0.03 mCi/mg). In vitro assays demonstrated that (89)Zr-DFO-J591 had an initial immunoreactive fraction of 0.95 +/- 0.03 and remained active for up to 7 d. In vivo biodistribution experiments revealed high, target-specific uptake of (89)Zr-DFO-J591 in LNCaP tumors after 24, 48, 96, and 144 h (34.4 +/- 3.2 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g], 38.0 +/- 6.2 %ID/g, 40.4 +/- 4.8 %ID/g, and 45.8 +/- 3.2 %ID/g, respectively). ImmunoPET studies also showed that (89)Zr-DFO-J591 provides excellent image contrast, with tumor-to-muscle ratios greater than 20, for the delineation of LNCaP xenografts between 48 and 144 h after administration.  Conclusion:   These studies demonstrate that (89)Zr-DFO-labeled mAbs show exceptional promise as radiotracers for immunoPET of human cancers. (89)Zr-DFO-J591 displays high tumor-to-background tissue contrast in immunoPET and can be used to delineate and quantify PSMA-positive prostate tumors in vivo.""","""['Jason P Holland', 'Vadim Divilov', 'Neil H Bander', 'Peter M Smith-Jones', 'Steven M Larson', 'Jason S Lewis']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Targeting the internal epitope of prostate-specific membrane antigen with 89Zr-7E11 immuno-PET.', 'Measuring the pharmacodynamic effects of a novel Hsp90 inhibitor on HER2/neu expression in mice using Zr-DFO-trastuzumab.', 'A radiopharmaceutical 89ZrZr-DFO-nimotuzumab for immunoPET with epidermal growth factor receptor expression in vivo.', '89Zr-Desferrioxamine B-J591 anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen monoclonal antibody.', '89Zr-Desferrioxamine B-7E11 anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen monoclonal antibody.', 'Image-Based Dosimetry in Dogs and Cross-Reactivity with Human Tissues of IGF2R-Targeting Human Antibody.', 'Medical Imaging Technology and Imaging Agents.', 'Radiolabeling and in vivo evaluation of lanmodulin with biomedically relevant lanthanide isotopes.', 'Characterization of Non-Specific Uptake and Retention Mechanisms of 177LuLu-PSMA-617 in the Salivary Glands.', 'Exploring the Potential of Zirconium-89 in Diagnostic Radiopharmaceutical Applications: An Analytical Investigation.']"""

We investigated how allelic variation in hTERT-VNTR2-2nd may affect susceptibility to prostate cancer.  Methods:   A case-control study was performed using DNA from 421 cancer-free male controls and 329 patients with prostate cancer. In addition, to determine whether the VNTR polymorphisms have a functional consequence, we examined the transcriptional levels of a reporter gene linked to these VNTRs and driven by the hTERT promoter in cell lines.  Results:   Three new rare alleles were detected from this study, two of which were identified only in cancer subjects. A statistically significant association between rare hTERT-VNTR2-2nd alleles and risk of prostate cancer was observed [OR, 5.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-24.43; P = 0.021]. Furthermore, the results indicated that these VNTRs inserted in the enhancer region could influence the expression of hTERT in prostate cancer cell lines.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to report that rare hTERT VNTRs are associated with prostate cancer predisposition and that the VNTRs can induce enhanced levels of hTERT promoter activity in prostate cancer cell lines.

However, most of the currently diagnosed CaP are low-grade and intraprostatic, with low metastatic risk, and there is recent evidence that most patients are overdiagnosed. The Italian National guidelines about organ acceptance from neoplastic donors changed in March 2005, extending the pool of potential candidates with CaP and introducing the function of a second opinion expert. Between 2001 and February 2005, 40 candidate donors with total PSA>/=10 and/or positive digital rectal examination underwent histopathological analysis of the prostate: 15 (37.5%) donors harboured CaP, and 25 (62%) were judged at 'standard risk'. After the introduction of the new guidelines in 2005, the second opinion expert judged at 'standard risk' 48 of 65 donors, while 17 of 65 needed histopathological analysis. Four (6.2%) donors harboured CaP, and 61 (94%) where judged at 'standard risk', with a significant increase of donated and actually transplanted organs.

The α6p variant is a 70 kDa form of the full-length α6 integrin (140 kDa) that remains paired with either the β1 or β4 subunit on the cell surface. α6p is produced by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which removes the extracellular β-barrel domain while the receptor is on the cell surface. The α6p integrin was present in human prostate cancer tissue but not in normal tissue and the cleavage of the α6 integrin extracellular domain promotes tumor cell invasion and migration on laminin. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the α6p integrin is observed in other models of carcinogenesis. Our results indicate detectable low levels of α6p in normal mouse skin, and comparatively elevated levels in mouse papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas induced by DMBA, TPA and MNNG treatments. Furthermore, we have found that α6p was present at high levels in skin melanomas of transgenic mice that over express activated Ha-ras under the control of the tyrosinase promoter. Finally, subcutaneous injection into athymic nude mice of a malignant mouse keratinocyte derived cell line (6M90) that is α6p negative, results in the development of tumors that contain α6p integrin. The latter results indicate that α6p is induced in vivo suggesting that the tumor microenvironment plays a major role in the production of α6p. Taken together, these data suggest that the cell surface cleavage of the α6 integrin may be a novel mechanism of integrin regulation and might be an important step during skin tissue remodeling and during carcinogenesis.""","""['Manolis C Demetriou', 'Kevin A Kwei', 'Marianne B Powell', 'Raymond B Nagle', 'G Tim Bowden', 'Anne E Cress']""","""[]""","""2008""","""None""","""Open Cancer J""","""['Extracellular alpha 6 integrin cleavage by urokinase-type plasminogen activator in human prostate cancer.', 'Integrin alpha6 cleavage: a novel modification to modulate cell migration.', 'Spatially and temporally regulated alpha6 integrin cleavage during Xenopus laevis development.', 'Extracellular engagement of alpha6 integrin inhibited urokinase-type plasminogen activator-mediated cleavage and delayed human prostate bone metastasis.', 'Integrin clipping: a novel adhesion switch?', 'Characterization of Laminin Binding Integrin Internalization in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Laminin-binding integrin gene copy number alterations in distinct epithelial-type cancers.', 'An novel role of sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1) in the invasion and metastasis of esophageal carcinoma.']"""
