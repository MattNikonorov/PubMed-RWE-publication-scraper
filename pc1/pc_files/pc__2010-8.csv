The goal of the study is to promote screening behavior in African American men. The objectives were: 1) to identify enablers and barriers to screening; 2) to develop and test the effectiveness of an education intervention; and 3) to determine the impact of the intervention on prostate cancer screening rates through follow-up survey. The study followed a quasi-experimental three-phase design: 1) focus group, 2) education intervention, and 3) follow-up. Focus groups (N = 76) indicate men are reluctant to talk about their health with anyone. Analysis of pre-test and post-test paired t-test indicate a significant increase in knowledge and awareness of prostate cancer (85%). Follow-up survey results indicate that 48% (N = 105) of the participants who had not been screened within the last 12 months were screened after attending the education session.""","""['Vivian L Carter', 'Fredrick Tippett', 'Dennis L Anderson', 'Berhanu Tameru']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Health Care Poor Underserved""","""['A tailored prostate cancer education intervention for low-income African Americans: impact on knowledge and screening.', 'Improvement of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs of African American Men Toward Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'PEP Talk: Prostate Education Program, ""Cutting Through the Uncertainty of Prostate Cancer for Black Men Using Decision Support Instruments in Barbershops"".', 'Do African-American men need separate prostate cancer screening guidelines?', 'Using the health belief model in understanding prostate cancer in African American men.', 'Training Community African American and Hispanic/Latino/a Advocates on Prostate Cancer (PCa): a Multicultural and Bicoastal Approach.', 'Enhancing public awareness and practice of prostate cancer screening among African men: A scoping review.', 'Cancer screening educational interventions in rural and farmworker communities: a systematic literature review.', 'A pilot study of prostate cancer knowledge among African American men and their health care advocates: implications for screening decisions.', 'Effects of an Educational Program for Prostate Cancer Prevention on knowledge and PSA Testing in Men Over 50 Years old in Community Areas of Shiraz in 2016.']"""

Spouses/partners are likely to experience the greatest personal impact, and may influence patient adjustment. Also, the intimate relationship may be affected by the illness experience. This study examined whether dyadic concordance on the characteristics of prostate cancer (PC) was related to health-related quality of life (HRQOL), psychological distress and marital adjustment in PC patients and their female partners. Couples (N=164) completed questionnaires on the appraisals of PC, and individual and dyadic adjustment. Patient and partner PC appraisal ratings were positively correlated. There was a general pattern of patients and partners in concordant dyads, versus those in dyads in which spouses maximised or minimised PC characteristics, reporting significantly better individual HRQOL outcomes, although there were several exceptions. Patient-partner appraisal (dis)agreement generally did not significantly predict dyadic adjustment.

Patients and methods:   A total of 750 patients who underwent RP (n = 575) or EBRT (n = 175) participated in our longitudinal outcomes study. Of these patients, 48 RP patients (8%) and 63 EBRT patients (36%) presented with cT3PC and were included in this analysis. Patients completed the general and disease-specific HRQOL with the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index, respectively.  Results:   When examining the mean SF-36 values by time, there was significant impact on treatment outcomes for several items of the general HRQOL in the RP subjects. Those who underwent EBRT reported no significant changes in the general HRQOL throughout the follow-up period. With regard to disease-specific HRQOL, the RP subjects had significantly worse urinary HRQOL post-operatively than the EBRT subjects (P < 0.001). The scores for sexual function declined over the 60 months, but more so in the RP group. The two groups showed similar bowel HRQOL scores throughout the follow-up periods.  Conclusions:   Both primary treatments for cT3PC can offer satisfactory functional outcomes from the HRQOL perspective, except for a persistent decrease in the sexual activity score. These results may guide the treatment selection and clinical management of patients with HRQOL impairments after treatment for cT3PC.""","""['Shunichi Namiki', 'Tatsuo Tochigi', 'Shigeto Ishidoya', 'Akihiro Ito', 'Isao Numata', 'Yoichi Arai']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Quality of life among elderly men treated for prostate cancer with either radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy.', 'Health-related quality of life and satisfaction with care among older men treated for prostate cancer with either radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy.', 'Oncological results, functional outcomes and health-related quality-of-life in men who received a radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: a study on long-term patient outcome with risk stratification.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life following prostate cancer treatments.', 'Health-related quality of life among long-term (≥5\xa0years) prostate cancer survivors by primary intervention: a systematic review.', 'Radical prostatectomy in locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'The value of prostate MRI with endorectal coil in detecting seminal vesicle involvement in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Validity testing of the stopwatch urine stream interruption test in radical prostatectomy patients.']"""

Methods:   Sixty-eight patients with a history of negative biopsies, negative digital rectal examination and elevated PSA were imaged before repeat biopsies. Dichotomous criteria were used with visual validation of T2-weighted MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and literature-derived cut-offs for 3D-spectroscopy MRI (choline-creatine-to-citrate ratio >0.86) and diffusion-weighted imaging (ADC × 10(3) mm(2)/s < 1.24).

The transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR) is modulated by interaction with coregulators, one of which is β-catenin. Curcumin, a dietary yellow pigment of Curcuma longa, has emerged as having a chemopreventive role. Although curcumin has been shown to inhibit AR expression, its molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, whether curcumin mediates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway with regard to AR/β-catenin interactions was studied. Curcumin was shown to induce significant inhibition of AR expression in a dose-dependent manner. Marked curcumin-induced suppression of β-catenin was shown in the nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts as well as whole cell lysates. Further analysis revealed that phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3β were attenuated, but phosphorylated β-catenin was increased after curcumin treatment. Finally, cyclin D1 and c-myc, the target gene of the β-catenin/T-cell factor transcriptional complex, were also decreased. These findings suggest that curcumin modulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and might have a significant role in mediating inhibitory effects on LNCaP prostate cancer cells.""","""['H Y Choi', 'J E Lim', 'J H Hong']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Anti-proliferative potential of curcumin in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells occurs through modulation of the Wingless signaling pathway.', 'Functional localization and competition between the androgen receptor and T-cell factor for nuclear beta-catenin: a means for inhibition of the Tcf signaling axis.', 'Quercetin inhibit human SW480 colon cancer growth in association with inhibition of cyclin D1 and survivin expression through Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Interplay Between SOX9, Wnt/β-Catenin and Androgen Receptor Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Applications of Curcumin: Update.', '3,4-Dimethoxychalcone, a caloric restriction mimetic, enhances TFEB-mediated autophagy and alleviates pyroptosis and necroptosis after spinal cord injury.', 'Delivery of curcumin within emulsome nanoparticles enhances the anti-cancer activity in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell.', 'Elk-1 regulates retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration after injury.', 'Shenkang injection improves chronic kidney disease by inhibiting multiple renin-angiotensin system genes by blocking the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.']"""

Treatment planning was performed for five prostate cancer patients. We simulated correction of a 3, 5, 7 and 10 mm prostate shift relative to the body contour in the anterior, posterior, superior and inferior directions. We applied the original treatment plan to each corrected prostate shift and recalculated the dose distribution using the same monitor units (MU). We calculated the dose differences with and without density information. The latter mimics geometrically correct MRI data. Physical path lengths, available in MRI data, are used to perform MU rescaling per beam and are shown to be of more importance than tissue densities for treatment plan adaptation in prostate cancer. As the change in the physical path length of the central beam axis is representative of the entire beam, MU rescaling based on central beam axis information works fine.

We examined whether common germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FASN gene affect prostate cancer (PCa) risk or PCa-specific mortality and whether these effects vary by body mass index (BMI).  Methods:   In a prospective nested case-control study of 1,331 white patients with PCa and 1,267 age-matched controls, we examined associations of five common SNPs within FASN (and 5 kb upstream/downstream, R(2) > 0.8) with PCa incidence and, among patients, PCa-specific death and tested for an interaction with BMI. Survival analyses were repeated for tumor FASN expression (n = 909).  Results:   Four of the five SNPs were associated with lethal PCa. SNP rs1127678 was significantly related to higher BMI and interacted with BMI for both PCa risk (P(interaction) = .004) and PCa mortality (P(interaction) = .056). Among overweight men (BMI > or = 25 kg/m(2)), but not leaner men, the homozygous variant allele carried a relative risk of advanced PCa of 2.49 (95% CI, 1.00 to 6.23) compared with lean men with the wild type. Overweight patients carrying the variant allele had a 2.04 (95% CI, 1.31 to 3.17) times higher risk of PCa mortality. Similarly, overweight patients with elevated tumor FASN expression had a 2.73 (95% CI, 1.05 to 7.08) times higher risk of lethal PCa (P(interaction) = .02).  Conclusion:   FASN germline polymorphisms were significantly associated with risk of lethal PCa. Significant interactions of BMI with FASN polymorphisms and FASN tumor expression suggest FASN as a potential link between obesity and poor PCa outcome and raise the possibility that FASN inhibition could reduce PCa-specific mortality, particularly in overweight men.""","""['Paul L Nguyen', 'Jing Ma', 'Jorge E Chavarro', 'Matthew L Freedman', 'Rosina Lis', 'Giuseppe Fedele', 'Christopher Fiore', 'Weiliang Qiu', 'Michelangelo Fiorentino', 'Stephen Finn', 'Kathryn L Penney', 'Anna Eisenstein', 'Fredrick R Schumacher', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Edward Giovannucci', 'Massimo Loda']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['P300 acetyltransferase regulates fatty acid synthase expression, lipid metabolism and prostate cancer growth.', 'Association of fatty-acid synthase polymorphisms and expression with outcomes after radical prostatectomy.', 'Selenoprotein P genetic variants and mrna expression, circulating selenium, and prostate cancer risk and survival.', 'Cohort study of fatty acid synthase expression and patient survival in colon cancer.', 'The role of single nucleotide polymorphisms in predicting prostate cancer risk and therapeutic decision making.', 'Ultrastructural analysis of prostate cancer tissue provides insights into androgen-dependent adaptations to membrane contact site establishment.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Physiological and pathological roles of lipogenesis.', 'Phase II Investigation of TVB-2640 (Denifanstat) with Bevacizumab in Patients with First Relapse High-Grade Astrocytoma.', 'Lipids as Targets for Renal Cell Carcinoma Therapy.']"""

Weighted multivariate linear regression was performed on log-transformed total PSA to determine the effect of the 10 most commonly prescribed medication classes, adjusting for potential confounders including demographics, clinical characteristics, physical examination, laboratory studies, and duration of medication use.  Results:   In total, 1,864 men met inclusion criteria. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID; P = .03), statin (P = .01), and thiazide diuretic (P = .025) intake was inversely related to PSA levels. Five years of NSAID, statin, and thiazide diuretic use was associated with PSA levels lower by 6%, 13%, and 26%, respectively. The combination of statins and thiazide diuretics showed the greatest reduction in PSA levels: 36% after 5 years. Concurrent calcium channel blocker use minimizes or negates the inverse relationship of statin use and PSA level.  Conclusion:   We found that men using NSAIDs, statins, and thiazide diuretics have reduced PSA levels by clinically relevant amounts. The impact of regularly consuming these common medications on prostate cancer screening is unknown.""","""['Steven L Chang', 'Lauren C Harshman', 'Joseph C Presti Jr']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer: Commonly used medications cause clinically relevant decreases in serum PSA levels.', 'Re: impact of common medications on serum total prostate-specific antigen levels: analysis of the national health and nutrition examination survey.', 'Re.: Impact of common medications on serum total prostate-specific antigen levels: analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.', 'Impact of common medications on serum total prostate-specific antigen levels and risk group assignment in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Re.: Impact of common medications on serum total prostate-specific antigen levels: analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.', 'Re: impact of common medications on serum total prostate-specific antigen levels: analysis of the national health and nutrition examination survey.', 'Prostate specific antigen reduction following statin therapy: Mechanism of action and review of the literature.', 'Benefits and Harms of Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence Update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'The 17-Gene Genomic Prostate Score Assay Is Prognostic for Biochemical Failure in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy at a Community Cancer Center.', 'Long-Term Treatment with Simvastatin Leads to Reduced Migration Capacity of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Biomarker sensing platforms based on fluorescent metal nanoclusters.', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.', 'Rates of False-Negative Screening in Prostate Specific Antigen Secondary to 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitor Usage: A Quality-Improvement Initiative.']"""

The activity of eIF4E is dysregulated in cancer. Regulation of eIF4E is partly achieved through phosphorylation. However, the physiological significance of eIF4E phosphorylation in mammals is not clear. Here, we show that knock-in mice expressing a nonphosphorylatable form of eIF4E are resistant to tumorigenesis in a prostate cancer model. By using a genome-wide analysis of translated mRNAs, we show that the phosphorylation of eIF4E is required for translational up-regulation of several proteins implicated in tumorigenesis. Accordingly, increased phospho-eIF4E levels correlate with disease progression in patients with prostate cancer. Our findings establish eIF4E phosphorylation as a critical event in tumorigenesis.

As an alternative to palpation, an increasing number of methods for estimation of the volume of the prostate are based on using imagery data. The necessity to process large volumes of such data creates a need for automatic segmentation tools which would allow the estimation to be carried out with maximum accuracy and efficiency. In particular, the use of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging in prostate cancer screening seems to be becoming a standard clinical practice because of the high benefit-to-cost ratio of this imaging modality. Unfortunately, the segmentation of TRUS images is still hampered by relatively low contrast and reduced SNR of the images, thereby requiring the segmentation algorithms to incorporate prior knowledge about the geometry of the gland. In this paper, a novel approach to the problem of segmenting the TRUS images is described. The proposed approach is based on the concept of distribution tracking, which provides a unified framework for modeling and fusing image-related and morphological features of the prostate. Moreover, the same framework allows the segmentation to be regularized by using a new type of weak shape priors, which minimally bias the estimation procedure, while rendering the procedure stable and robust. The value of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in a series of in silico and in vivo experiments.""","""['Robert Sheng Xu', 'Oleg Michailovich', 'Magdy Salama']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control""","""['Prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound using magnetic resonance imaging priors.', 'Rotationally resliced 3D prostate TRUS segmentation using convex optimization with shape priors.', 'Discrete deformable model guided by partial active shape model for TRUS image segmentation.', 'Fisher-Tippett region-merging approach to transrectal ultrasound prostate lesion segmentation.', 'A regularization technique for closed contour segmentation in ultrasound images.', '3D Prostate Segmentation of Ultrasound Images Combining Longitudinal Image Registration and Machine Learning.', '3D ultrasound image segmentation using wavelet support vector machines.', 'A Molecular Image-directed, 3D Ultrasound-guided Biopsy System for the Prostate.']"""

Preclinical in vitro studies suggest that zibotentan has the potential to act as a time-dependent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isozyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolic pathway. In clinical practice, it is likely that zibotentan will be coadministered with drugs metabolized by this pathway; the potential exists, therefore, that zibotentan-induced drug interactions could occur.  Objectives:   The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of zibotentan on the pharmaco-kinetics of a clinically relevant dose of midazolam in healthy volunteers. Secondary objectives were to evaluate exposure to zibotentan, ensure the safety of the healthy volunteers dosed, and investigate the effect of zibotentan on the pharmacokinetics of the midazolam metabolites 1-hydroxy midazolam and 4-hydroxy midazolam. The potency of zibotentan as a CYP3A4 inhibitor was also assessed.  Methods:   This was an open-label, randomized, singlecenter, 2-period, Phase I, crossover study. Volunteers were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 cohorts. In cohort 1, volunteers received a single dose of midazolam 7.5 mg on day 1 (treatment A) of a 2-day study period. After a minimum 7-day washout period, volunteers received zibotentan 10 mg once daily on days 1 through 7, plus a single dose of midazolam 7.5 mg on day 6 (treatment B) of a 7-day study period. In cohort 2, volunteers received treatment B followed by treatment A, with a minimum 7-day washout period between treatments. AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) data were expressed as geometric least squares mean ratios and 90% CIs for midazolam + zibotentan:midazolam. A moderate interaction between midazolam and zibotentan was predefined to have occurred if the upper 90% CI of the ratio was >1.5. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3. AE data were assessed based on information provided by the volunteer, through open-ended and nonleading verbal questions to the volunteer at each visit, and through observation by the investigational team, other care providers, or relatives.  Results:   Six volunteers (all white) were included in each cohort (cohort 1, mean [SD] age, 48 [7] years; mean weight, 74 [6] kg; cohort 2, mean age, 51 [11] years; mean weight, 75 [13] kg). Steady-state levels of zibotentan, achieved over 7 days, increased the midazolam AUC(0-infinity) by 1.2-fold compared with midazolam alone. The upper limits of the 90% CIs for the AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) ratios were below the predefined level of 1.5 (1.37 and 1.32, respectively). Zibotentan had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of 1-hydroxy midazolam and 4-hydroxy midazolam. Fatigue was reported in 11 volunteers (92%) receiving midazolam monotherapy and 10 (83%) receiving midazolam combined with zibotentan. Headache was reported in all 12 volunteers after zibotentan monotherapy.  Conclusions:   In this population of healthy male volunteers, once-daily zibotentan 10 mg increased the AUC(0-infinity) of midazolam 1.2-fold; however, the treatment ratio was below the predefined limit for clinical significance. Zibotentan was well tolerated when given alone or in combination with midazolam. The results indicate that once-daily zibotentan 10 mg acted as a weak inhibitor of the CYP3A4 pathway.

Materials and methods:   Subcutaneous tumor xenografts of human prostate cancer cells (CWR22) were initiated in athymic nude mice. A second-generation photosensitizer, Pc 4, was delivered to each animal by a tail vein injection 48 h before laser illumination. A dedicated high-field (9.4 Tesla) small animal MR scanner was used to acquire diffusion-weighted MR images pre-PDT and 24 h after the treatment. DW-MRI and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were analyzed for 24 treated and 5 control mice with photosensitizer only or laser light only. Tumor size, prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, and tumor histology were obtained at different time points to examine the treatment effect.  Results:   Treated mice showed significant tumor size shrinkage and decrease of PSA level within 7 days after the treatment. The average ADC of the 24 treated tumors increased 24 h after PDT (P < 0.001) comparing with pre-PDT. The average ADC was 0.511 +/- 0.119 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s pre-PDT and 0.754 +/- 0.181 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s 24 h after the PDT. There is no significant difference in ADC values pre-PDT and 24 h after PDT in the control tumors (P = 0.20).

An ultra scale-down (USD) approach is presented to allow the use of small quantities of cells available at the early discovery stage and to expose them to a wide range of hydrodynamic stresses. In this way an indication is gained of the relative properties of different cell lines and the challenge which may be faced during full-scale processing. A design of experiments approach allowed the interaction between a number of key processing factors such as capillary length, flow rate, and number of passes to be studied in a limited number of experiments. Out of this an USD test based on flow rate in a device of fixed geometry was proposed. Based on observations made elsewhere (Ma et al., 2002, Biotechnol Bioeng 80(4): 428-437) a detailed analysis of possible geometries was performed using a combination of USD experiments and computational fluid dynamics analysis of the capillary entry region. This allowed the properties of the cells to be characterized in terms of a critical stress below which there is no significant loss of cell integrity. The results suggested that the OnyCap23 and P4E6 cell lines, used as components of a whole cell prostate cancer vaccine, are resistant to damage below critical elongational shear stress values of 235 and 275 N/m(2), respectively. Above these stress values the loss of intact cells is predicted to be significant; such loss being due to a combination of whole cells becoming permeable to trypan blue and complete breakage of cells into debris at extreme stresses. The sensitivity of cell surface markers CD9, CD44, CD59, CD81, CD147, and MHC-1 to exposure to shear stress was considerably less than for cell membrane integrity. The surface marker levels for recovered whole cells (i.e., both with and without intact cell membranes) were either independent of shear stress or showed a slight decrease with increased shear stress, for example, as for CD9. The results were used to predict successfully a capillary design where no damage would occur at a specified high flow rate; for example, as required for cell dispensing or vialling operations. Equally, the extent of loss of cell integrity was also successfully predicted in a capillary flow system designed to yield high levels of break up as may be required in intracellular analysis without the use of chemical lysing reagents or relying on autolytic damage.""","""['J P Acosta-Martinez', 'I Papantoniou', 'K Lawrence', 'S Ward', 'M Hoare']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biotechnol Bioeng""","""['Ultra scale-down studies of the effect of shear on cell quality; Processing of a human cell line for cancer vaccine therapy.', 'Sub-population analysis of human cancer vaccine cells--ultra scale-down characterization of response to shear.', 'Ultra scale-down prediction using microwell technology of the industrial scale clarification characteristics by centrifugation of mammalian cell broths.', 'Safety and nutritional assessment of GM plants and derived food and feed: the role of animal feeding trials.', 'Role of hydrodynamic shear on activity and structure of proteins.', 'An ultra scale-down methodology to characterize aspects of the response of human cells to processing by membrane separation operations.', 'An ultra scale-down analysis of the recovery by dead-end centrifugation of human cells for therapy.']"""

The major metabolites of both GRPR agonist and antagonist were the result of peptide bond hydrolysis between W and A which was demonstrated by observation of the N-terminal fragment m/z 446 (Aca-QW-OH) for agonist and m/z 480 (fQW-OH) for antagonist. Both peptides were also hydrolyzed between A and V which formed peaks m/z 517 [Aca-QWA-OH] and m/z 555 (VGHLM-NH2) for the agonist and m/z 551 [fQWA-OH] and m/z 452 (VGHL-NHEthyl) for the antagonist. The peptide agonist also formed a unique metabolite that resulted from hydrolysis of the C-terminal amide. The antagonist showed significantly slower metabolism as compared to the agonist in both rat hepatocytes and PC-3 cells. The antagonist also showed significantly lower PC-3 cell internalization rate than that of the agonist. In conclusion, the metabolism profiles of both GRPR agonist and antagonist peptides were identified by LC/MS. The antagonist peptide was more stable than the agonist peptide in rat hepatocyte incubation. One major factor could be the hydrolysis-resistant C-terminal L-NHEthyl group compared with the unsubstituted amide of the agonist. Another factor could be different amino acid sequences of the agonist and antagonist that may also influence the enzymatic hydrolysis. The antagonist ligand is potentially more useful for receptor-targeted imaging due primarily to its higher metabolic stability.""","""['Dongyu Gu', 'Ying Ma', 'Gang Niu', 'Yongjun Yan', 'Lixin Lang', 'Haji Akber Aisa', 'Haokao Gao', 'Dale O Kiesewetter', 'Xiaoyuan Chen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Evaluation of fluorine-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) agonists and antagonists by LC/MS.', 'Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Prostate Cancer with Ga-68-Labeled Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Agonist BBN7-14 and Antagonist RM26.', 'Theranostic Perspectives in Prostate Cancer with the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist NeoBOMB1: Preclinical and First Clinical Results.', 'Prostate Cancer Theranostics Targeting Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptors.', 'An update of radiolabeled bombesin analogs for gastrin-releasing peptide receptor targeting.', 'Combined image guided monitoring the pharmacokinetics of rapamycin loaded human serum albumin nanoparticles with a split luciferase reporter.', 'Rational design of matrix metalloproteinase-13 activatable probes for enhanced specificity.', 'Evaluation of fluorine-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) agonists and antagonists by LC/MS.']"""

Korea is facing a very rapid change and increase in cancer incidence, which draws much attention in public health. This paper overviews the nationwide cancer statistics, including incidence, mortality, and survival rates, and their trends in Korea based on the cancer incidence data from The Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) in year 2006 and 2007. In Korea, there were 153,237 cancer cases and 65,519, cancer deaths observed in 2006, and 161,920 cancer cases and 67,561 cancer deaths in 2007, respectively. The incidence rate for all cancer combined showed an annual increase of 2.8% from 1999 to 2007. Specifically, there was significant increase in the incidence of colorectal, thyroid, female breast, and prostate cancers.

Interestingly, PSP94 expression is reduced or lost in the majority of the prostate tumours, whereas CRISP-3 expression is upregulated in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate tissue. To obtain a better understanding of the individual roles these proteins have in prostate tumourigenesis and the functional relevance of their interaction, we ectopically expressed either PSP94 or CRISP-3 alone or PSP94 along with CRISP-3 in three prostate cell lines (PC3, WPE1-NB26 and LNCaP) and performed growth inhibition assays. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were used to screen prostate cell lines for PSP94 and CRISP-3 expression. Mammalian expression constructs for human PSP94 and CRISP-3 were also generated and the expression, localization and secretion of recombinant protein were assayed by transfection followed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay. The effect that ectopic expression of PSP94 or CRISP-3 had on cell growth was studied by clonogenic survival assay following transfection. To evaluate the effects of co-expression of the two proteins, stable clones of PC3 that expressed PSP94 were generated. They were subsequently transfected with a CRISP-3 expression construct and subjected to clonogenic survival assay. Our results showed that PSP94 and CRISP-3 could each induce growth inhibition in a cell line specific manner. Although the growth of CRISP-3-positive cell lines was inhibited by PSP94, growth inhibition mediated by CRISP-3 was not affected by the presence or absence of PSP94. This suggests that CRISP-3 may participate in PSP94-independent activities during prostate tumourigenesis.""","""['Bhakti R Pathak', 'Ananya A Breed', 'Vaishali H Nakhawa', 'Dhanashree D Jagtap', 'Smita D Mahale']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Growth inhibition properties of the putative prostate cancer biomarkers PSP94 and CRISP-3.', 'Growth inhibition properties of the putative prostate cancer biomarkers PSP94 and CRISP-3.', 'Purification and characterization of CRISP-3 from human seminal plasma and its real-time binding kinetics with PSP94.', 'Mapping of the binding sites involved in PSP94-CRISP-3 interaction by molecular dissection of the complex.', 'Structural and molecular biology of PSP94: Its significance in prostate pathophysiology.', 'Relevance of CRISP proteins for epididymal physiology, fertilization, and fertility.', 'Site-Specific and Common Prostate Cancer Metastasis Genes as Suggested by Meta-Analysis of Gene Expression Data.', 'Screening differentially expressed proteins of coronary heart disease with congenital cold syndrome based on tandem mass tag (TMT) technology.', 'Loss of PSP94 expression is associated with early PSA recurrence and deteriorates outcome of PTEN deleted prostate cancers.', 'Cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 plays a role in prostate cancer cell invasion and affects expression of PSA and ANXA1.', 'The rs10993994 in the proximal MSMB promoter region is a functional polymorphism in Asian Indian subjects.']"""

Although reduced MAD2 expression is well recognised in human cancer cell lines, the mechanism(s) underlying its downregulation remain elusive. The objective of this study was to establish the impact of hypoxia on MAD2 expression and to investigate the potential role of aberrant promoter methylation as a possible mechanism of MAD2 downregulation. For this purpose, three ovarian cancer cell lines, displaying differing levels of MAD2, were treated with chromatin modifying drugs, pre and post-hypoxia exposure and a DHPLC analysis of DNA promoter methylation carried out. We show that hypoxia induces downregulation of MAD2 expression, independently of MAD2 promoter methylation. We also show no evidence of MAD2 promoter methylation in breast and prostate cancer cells or in breast cancer clinical material. While our findings provide no evidence for MAD2 promoter methylation, we show a concomitant upregulation of p21 with downregulation of MAD2 in hypoxia. Our in vitro results were also confirmed in an ovarian cancer tissue microarray (TMA), where a reciprocal staining of MAD2 and CAIX was found in 21/60 (35%) of tumours. In summary, MAD2 downregulation may be a crucial mechanism by which hypoxic cells become chemorefractory. This stems from our previous work where we demonstrated that MAD2 downregulation induces cellular senescence, a viable cellular fate, with resultant cellular resistance to paclitaxel. Moreover, MAD2 downregulation could play a central role in the induction of chemoresistance in hypoxia, a key tumour microenvironment associated with chemoresistance.""","""['Maria Prencipe', 'Aloysius McGoldrick', 'Antoinette S Perry', ""Anthony O'Grady"", 'Sine Phelan', 'Barbara McGrogan', 'Patricia Fitzpatrick', 'Jenny A Watson', 'Fiona Furlong', 'Donal J Brennan', 'Mark Lawler', 'Elaine Kay', 'Amanda McCann']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Cellular senescence induced by aberrant MAD2 levels impacts on paclitaxel responsiveness in vitro.', 'MAD2 depletion triggers premature cellular senescence in human primary fibroblasts by activating a p53 pathway preventing aneuploid cells propagation.', 'p31comet Induces cellular senescence through p21 accumulation and Mad2 disruption.', 'Expression of hypoxic marker CA IX is regulated by site-specific DNA methylation and is associated with the histology of gastric cancer.', 'Aneuploidy: instigator and inhibitor of tumorigenesis.', 'The fate of chemoresistance in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).', 'Rapamycin induces pluripotent genes associated with avoidance of replicative senescence.', 'Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascade inhibitors: how mutations can result in therapy resistance and how to overcome resistance.', 'A screen for selective killing of cells with chromosomal instability induced by a spindle checkpoint defect.', 'Low MAD2 expression levels associate with reduced progression-free survival in patients with high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer.']"""

We performed a matched case analysis comparing high-dose adjuvant intensity modulated radiotherapy (A-IMRT) with salvage IMRT (S-IMRT).  Methods and materials:   One hundred forty-four patients with high-risk disease at prostatectomy were referred for A-IMRT, and 134 patients with high-risk disease were referred at biochemical recurrence (rising prostate-specific antigen [PSA], following prostatectomy, above 0.2 ng/ml) for S-IMRT. Patients were matched in a 1:1 ratio according to preoperative PSA level, Gleason score, and pT stage. Median doses of 74 Gy and 76 Gy were prescribed for A-IMRT and S-IMRT, respectively. We report biochemical relapse free survival (bRFS) rates using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine tumour- and treatment-related factors.  Results:   A total of 178 patients were matched (89:89). From the end of radiotherapy, the median follow-up was 36 months for both groups. The 3-year bRFS rate for the A-IMRT group was 90% compared to 65% for the S-IMRT group (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, S-IMRT, Gleason grades of ≥ 4+3, perineural invasion, preoperative PSA level of ≥ 10 ng/ml, and omission of androgen deprivation (AD) were independent predictors for a reduced bRFS (p < 0.05). From the date of surgery, the median follow-up was 43 and 60 months for A-IMRT and S-IMRT, respectively. The 3-year bRFS rate for A-IMRT was 91% compared to 79% for S-IMRT (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, Gleason grades of ≥ 4+3, perineural invasion, and omission of AD were independent predictors for a reduced bRFS (p < 0.05).

Methods and materials:   A total of 12 consecutive prostate cancer patients with an IPL on magnetic resonance imaging were selected for the present study. Plans were made for three IMRT field setups (three, five, and seven fields) and one VMAT field setup (single arc). First, optimal plans were created for every technique using biologic and physical planning aims. Next, an additional escalation to the IPL was planned as high as possible without violating the planning aims of the first step.  Results:   No interaction between the technique and photon energy (p=.928) occurred. No differences were found between the 6- and 18-MV photon beams, except for a reduction in the number of monitor units needed for 18 MV (p<.05). All techniques, except for three-field IMRT, allowed for dose escalation to a median dose of ≥93±6 Gy (mean±standard deviation) to the IPL. VMAT was superior to IMRT for rectal volumes receiving 20-50 Gy (p<.05).

We investigate using biological modeling if the resulting variation in daily dose to normal tissues has a relevant detrimental biological effect.  Methods and materials:   For four patient groups, the cumulative normalized total dose (NTD) was determined for normal tissues (OARs) of each patient using the clinically delivered fractionation schedule (FS(clin)), and for hypothetical fractionation schedules delivering all fields every day (FS(all)) or only a single field each day (FS(single)). Cumulative three-dimensional NTD distributions were summarized using the generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) model.  Results:   For the skull base/cervical spine chordoma group, the largest effect is a 4-Gy increase in gEUD of the chiasm when treating only a subset of fields on any day. For lung cancer and pancreatic cancer patients, the variation in the gEUD of normal tissues is <0.2 Gy. For the prostate group, FS(clin) increases the gEUD of the femoral heads by 9 Gy compared with FS(all). Use of FS(single) resulted in the highest NTD to normal tissues for any patient. FS(all) resulted in an integral NTD to the patient that is on average 5% lower than FS(clin) and 10% lower than FS(single).

Patients and methods:   After the performance of more than 600 RARP over a 4-year period by a single surgeon using the daVinci® robot system at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey/Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, we reviewed the medical records of the first 200 patients retrospectively. All patients were divided into four groups according to the order of case numbers to compare intergroup differences in preoperative characteristics and perioperative parameters. Perioperative complications were determined in all patients, and complications were classified according to the Clavien classification system.  Results:   The mean operative time was 212 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 189 mL. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.13 days. Overall, 12% (24 men) experienced various perioperative complications among the 200 patients. Of the total 24 patients, 5 (20.8%) men experienced intraoperative complications, and 19 (79.2%) men showed postoperative complications. Rectal injury occurred in two (8.3%) men, and the injury was repaired primarily using two-layer suture techniques without any sequelae. Three (12.5%) patients had femoral neuropathy, and urinary retention developed in 7 (25.0%) patients. Among our 200 patients, no transfusion was needed intraoperatively and postoperatively. There were nine (4.5%) patients in the Clavien grade I complications category, and another 9 (4.5%) men were classified as grade II complications. Six (3.0%) men had grade IIIb complications, and there were no grade IV or V complications.

Methods:   The Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) registry comprises men from 40 urologic practice sites who are followed prospectively under uniform protocols, regardless of treatment. In the current study, 7538 men with localized disease were analyzed. Prostate cancer risk was assessed using the Kattan preoperative nomogram and the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score, both well validated instruments that are calculated from clinical data at the time of diagnosis. A parametric survival model was constructed to compare outcomes across treatments adjusting for risk and age.  Results:   In total, 266 men died of prostate cancer during follow-up. Adjusting for age and risk, the hazard ratio for cancer-specific mortality relative to prostatectomy was 2.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-3.24) for radiation therapy and 3.22 (95% CI, 2.16-4.81) for androgen deprivation. Absolute differences between prostatectomy and radiation therapy were small for men at low risk but increased substantially for men at intermediate and high risk. These results were robust to a variety of different analytic techniques, including competing risks regression analysis, adjustment by CAPRA score rather than Kattan score, and examination of overall survival as the endpoint.  Conclusions:   Prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer was associated with a significant and substantial reduction in mortality relative to radiation therapy and androgen-deprivation monotherapy.

Because current androgen ablation therapies of PC lead to resistance, novel approaches to block AR activity are urgently needed.  Methods:   We inhibited AR function beyond the level of hormone binding by blockade of the coactivator groove in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) using a high-affinity gelsolin FxxFF peptide. Following peptide selection, the effect of the gelsolin FxxFF peptide on AR functions was determined in Hep3B cells that were transiently transfected with pM-peptide expression vectors or were incubated with synthetic gelsolin FxxFF peptide coupled to the TAT cell-penetrating peptide. Lentiviruses expressing the gelsolin FxxFF peptide were used to study endogenous AR target gene expression in LNCaP cells.  Results:   pM-Gelsolin FxxFF efficiently interfered with AR N/C interaction and specifically inhibited AR-regulated reporter gene activity. The peptide did not inhibit progesterone receptor (PR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity, nor constitutively active gene promoters. The peptide also specifically blocked in vitro interactions of AR LBD with peptides. Like the gelsolin FxxFF peptide expressed by an expression vector, synthetic TAT-gelsolin FxxFF peptide efficiently blocked AR N/C interaction and inhibited full-length AR-regulated reporter gene activity. It hardly affected PR and GR activity, but the effect on constitutively active promoters was variable. Lentiviral gelsolin FxxFF peptide inhibited expression of KLK2 and NDRG1, but hardly affected PSA and TMPRSS2.

This study sought to determine whether such alterations could differentiate breast cancer patients from cancer-free subjects.  Methods:   The HER2 locus-an oncogene assigned to chromosome 17 whose amplification is associated with breast cancer (BCA)-and the pericentromeric satellite sequence of chromosome 17 (CEN17) were used for replication timing assessments. Aneuploidy was monitored by enumerating the copy numbers of chromosome 17. Replication timing and aneuploidy were detected cytogenetically using fluorescence in situ hybridization technology applied to phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes of 20 women with BCA and 10 control subjects.  Results:   We showed that both the HER2 and CEN17 loci in the stimulated BCA lymphocytes altered their characteristic pattern of synchronous replication and exhibited asynchronicity. In addition, there was an increase in chromosome 17 aneuploidy. The frequency of cells displaying asynchronous replication in the patients' samples was significantly higher (P < 10(-12) for HER2 and P < 10(-6) for CEN17) than the corresponding values in the control samples. Similarly, aneuploidy in patients' cells was significantly higher (P < 10(-9)) than that in the controls.

The collagen I (Col1) fiber matrix of solid tumors is the major structural part of the ECM. Col1 fiber density can increase tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, with cancer cell invasion occurring along radially aligned Col1 fibers. Here we have investigated the influence of hypoxia on Col1 fiber density in solid breast and prostate tumor models. Second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy was used to detect differences in Col1 fiber density and volume between hypoxic and normoxic tumor regions. Hypoxic regions were detected by fluorescence microscopy, using tumors derived from human breast and prostate cancer cell lines stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under transcriptional control of the hypoxia response element. In-house fiber analysis software was used to quantitatively analyze Col1 fiber density and volume from the SHG microscopy images. Normoxic tumor regions exhibited a dense mesh of Col1 fibers. In contrast, fewer and structurally altered Col1 fibers were detected in hypoxic EGFP-expressing tumor regions. Microarray gene expression analyses identified increased expression of lysyl oxidase and reduced expression of some matrix metalloproteases in hypoxic compared with normoxic cancer cells.

Nuclear AR immunostaining was decreased and apoptosis was increased, but cell proliferation remained largely unaffected in metastases within a few days after surgical castration. In CRPC patients, nuclear AR staining of metastases was increased when compared to short-term castrated patients. The nuclear AR staining score was related to tumour cell proliferation, but it was not associated with other downstream effects of AR activation such as apoptosis and PSA staining, and it was only marginally related to the presence of neuroendocrine tumour cells. Serum PSA at metastasis surgery, although related to outcome, was not associated with AR staining, markers of metastasis growth or PSA staining in metastases.

The multidomain structure, composed of a prodomain, a metalloproteinase, disintegrin-like, epidermal growth factor-like, cysteine-rich and transmembrane domains, and a cytoplasmic tail, allows ADAM-12 to promote matrix degradation, cell-cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling capacities and thereby to play a critical role in cancer growth and metastasis. Despite ample evidence linking increased ADAM-12 expression with cancer, the mechanisms controlling its upregulation are still unknown. In the present study, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is shown to increase ADAM-12 mRNA expression in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. We have identified a promoter element responsible for TGF-β1-mediated ADAM-12 induction. We show interaction of NF-κB with ADAM-12 promoter and that high level of NF-κB activity in breast carcinoma cells results in the upregulation of ADAM-12 expression. Site-directed mutagenesis of the NF-κB element in ADAM-12 promoter and inhibition of NF-κB activity by Bay-11-7085 and MG-132 significantly reduced TGF-β1-mediated increase of ADAM-12 promoter-driven gene expression. Transfection of cells with a dominant-negative mutant form of IκBα (IκBαΔN), which inhibits activation of NF-κB, significantly reduced transcription from ADAM-12 promoter-reporter in TGF-β1-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. In correlation, overexpression of NF-κB induced ADAM-12 expression in a dose-dependent manner. DNA-binding and ChIP assays indicated that p65 subunit of NF-κB binds to ADAM-12 promoter.

Methods and materials:   A patient with a previous history of total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer. He underwent prostate brachytherapy implant and his urinary, bowel, and sexual function were monitored preoperatively and regularly after his implant.  Results:   Approximately 1-year postimplant, the patient's serum prostate-specific antigen continued to decrease and urinary obstructive symptoms measured via a standardized patient-reported instrument increased transiently but returned to baseline. His sexual function remains slightly diminished. His self-reported bowel function has been essentially unchanged, and he specifically denies increased stool frequency, urgency, incontinence, tenesmus, or hematochezia.  Conclusions:   Prostate brachytherapy appears to be both safe and effective for treating low-risk prostate cancer in patients with a pre-existing ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.

The production of suitable matrices to study metastasis, carcinogenesis and in particular prostate cancer/bone micro-environment interaction has been limited to specific protein matrices or matrix secreted by immortalised cell lines that may have undergone transformation processes altering signaling pathways and modifying gene or receptor expression. We hypothesize that matrices produced by primary human osteoblasts are a suitable means to develop an in vitro model system for bone metastasis research mimicking in vivo conditions. We have used a decellularized matrix secreted from primary human osteoblasts as a model for prostate cancer function in the bone micro-environment. We show that this collagen I rich matrix is of fibrillar appearance, highly mineralized, and contains proteins, such as osteocalcin, osteonectin and osteopontin, and growth factors characteristic of bone extracellular matrix (ECM). LNCaP and PC3 cells grown on this matrix, adhere strongly, proliferate, and express markers consistent with a loss of epithelial phenotype. Moreover, growth of these cells on the matrix is accompanied by the induction of genes associated with attachment, migration, increased invasive potential, Ca(2+) signaling and osteolysis.

We demonstrate by biochemical and genetic approaches that CRKL is associated with the AR complex and is localised in the nucleus of prostate cancer cells and patient tissue biopsies. The interaction between CRKL and the AR is functionally relevant as demonstrated by its presence on the enhancer region of an androgen regulated gene (human Kallikrein-2), its upregulation of PSA, and reduction in AR transactivation following its disruption by siRNA knockdown. In the presence of the AR inhibitor casodex, the expression of CRKL co-stimulated by growth factors is able to rescue AR activity independent of hormone.

Methods:   We analyzed data on the first 9 months of clinical implementation to evaluate the validity of the STAR questionnaire to assess functional outcomes following radical prostatectomy. We assessed response rate, internal consistency within domains, and the association between survey responses and known predictors of sexual and urinary function, including age, time from surgery, nerve sparing status and co-morbidities.

A tissue microarray of 304 cases was constructed. IL16 and CCR5 expression levels were characterized by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   IL16 expression was correlated with high Gleason score (i.e., >7) (P < 0.01). It was not significant for CCR5. IL16 and CCR5 were not associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or capsular extension of the disease.

Methods:   Normal prostate tissues from UK-resident Caucasians (n = 10) were collected following either radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) or cystaprostatectomy (CyP).

We sought to investigate the role of glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c, on PCa aggressiveness and prognosis in men with DM and PCa from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.  Methods:   We identified 247 men in SEARCH with DM and a recorded HbA1c value within the 12 months prior to radical prostatectomy between 1988 and 2009. We divided these men into tertiles by HbA1c level. The associations between HbA1c tertiles and risk of adverse pathology and biochemical recurrence were tested using multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models, respectively.  Results:   Median HbA1c level was 6.9. On multivariate analysis, HbA1c tertiles were predictive of pathological Gleason score (P-trend = 0.001). Relative to the first tertile, men in the second (OR 4.68, P = 0.003) and third tertile (OR 6.60, P < 0.001) were more likely to have Gleason score > or = 4 + 3. HbA1c tertiles were not associated with margin status, node status, extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion (all P-trend > 0.2). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, increasing HbA1c tertiles were not significantly related to risk of biochemical recurrence (P-trend = 0.56).  Conclusion:   Men with higher HbA1c levels presented with more biologically aggressive prostate tumors at radical prostatectomy. Although risk of recurrence was unrelated to HbA1c levels, further studies are needed to better explore the importance of glycemic control on long-term outcomes in diabetic men with PCa.""","""['Howard S Kim', 'Joseph C Presti Jr', 'William J Aronson', 'Martha K Terris', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Significance of preoperative HbA1c level in patients with diabetes mellitus and clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of metastases and castration-resistant prostate cancer in men undergoing radical prostatectomy: Results from the SEARCH database.', 'Should a positive surgical margin following radical prostatectomy be pathological stage T2 or T3?

We hypothesized that tomato paste would have greater chemopreventive effects in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice relative to equivalent lycopene doses provided from lycopene beadlets.  Methods:   Fifty-nine TRAMP mice were randomized to a control diet or to diets providing 28 mg lycopene per kg diet from tomato paste (TP) or from lycopene beadlet (LB), and sacrificed at 20 weeks. Prostate histopathology, prostate weight and serum levels of IGF-I and IGF binding protein-3 were evaluated.  Results:   The incidence of prostate cancer was significantly decreased in the LB group relative to the control group (60% vs. 95%, respectively, P = 0.0197) whereas the difference between the TP and control groups was not statistically significant (80% vs. 95%, P = 0.34). There was no difference in prostate weights between the groups. Total lycopene levels in the serum and prostate tissue were similarly elevated in the LB and TP groups relative to the control group. The ratio of 5-cis-lycopene to trans-lycopene in the serum was significantly greater in the LB group relative to the TP group (P = 0.0001). Oxidative DNA damage was significantly reduced in the livers of mice fed LB and TP diets relative to the control group.

Our objective was to generate a novel cell line model representing the endocrine treatment naive prostate cancer for testing treatments that target the androgen receptor (AR) and androgen metabolism.  Methods:   After culturing DuCaP cells 20 passages with additional 1 nM R1881, DuCaP-N(aive) cell line was developed and validated for testing endocrine therapy combinations. Cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were assessed in DuCaP and DuCaP-N when interfering with the hormonal content.  Results:   Addition of 1 nM R1881 to DuCaP reduces cell viability and induces cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis. Eventually, an androgen accustomed DuCaP-N cell line developed. An antiandrogen (bicalutamide), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (trichostatin A) and a 5alpha-reductase (SRD5A) inhibitor (finasteride) reduce cell viability, and their combinations give a synergistic response in inducing apoptosis.

Reduced expression of the functionally connected apoptosis-regulators and candidate tumor suppressors Fau and Bcl-G has recently been implicated in oncogenesis in other tissues. The present study examines the hypothesis that reduced expression of these genes may be involved in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Fau and Bcl-G mRNA levels were determined by real time RT-PCR in two independent prostate tissue collections. In experiments in vitro, Fau and Bcl-G levels in prostate cancer cell lines were reduced using RNA interference and the effects on sensitivity to UVC irradiation were determined.  Results:   Fau and Bcl-G mRNA levels were both lower in prostate cancer tissue than in normal prostate and Benign Prostate Hyperplasia. Active down-regulation of Fau and Bcl-G expression in vitro resulted in decreased sensitivity to UVC-induced cytotoxicity. Simultaneous down-regulation of Fau and Bcl-G produced a decrease in sensitivity which was similar to either gene alone.  Conclusions:   Fau and Bcl-G mRNA levels are both decreased in prostate cancer. In prostate cancer cell lines in vitro such down-regulation results in reduced sensitivity to UVC-induced cytotoxicity, consistent with the putative roles of these genes as candidate prostate tumor suppressors.

We aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying paclitaxel resistance of hormone-refractory prostate cancer with a special focus on the roles of miR-34a and SIRT1.  Methods:   Paclitaxel-resistant cells (PC3PR) were generated from hormone-refractory PC3 cells. The expression levels of mRNA and miRNA were determined by reverse transcriptase PCR and those of protein were by Western blot analysis. Transfection of miRNA precursor or siRNA was performed using the liposome-mediated method.  Results:   MiR-34a over-expression and SIRT1 knockdown attenuated paclitaxel resistance of PC3PR cells. MiR-34a expression was reduced in PC3PR cells compared with PC3 cells, while the expression levels of HuR and Bcl2 as well as SIRT1 were elevated in PC3PR cells. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that both SIRT1 3'-UTR and promoter activities were higher in PC3PR cells than in PC3 cells. Introduction of miR-34a precursor into PC3PR cells resulted in decreases in HuR, Bcl2, and SIRT1 expression and inhibition of the SIRT1 3'-UTR activity. HuR knockdown reduced SIRT1 and Bcl2 expression. These results suggest that miR-34a not only directly but also indirectly via regulating HuR expression acts on the 3'-UTR of SIRT1 and Bcl2 mRNAs, thereby controlling their expression. Thus, in PC3PR cells, reduced expression of miR-34a confers paclitaxel resistance via up-regulating SIRT1 and Bcl2 expression.

Methods:   Parental LNCaP cells and an LNCaP-IL6+ subline, derived from parental LNCaP cells by continuous culture of the cells in the presence of recombinant IL-6 were used in the study.

Results:   Phosphorylation of ERK and STAT3 was increased in the LNCaP-IL6+ subline compared with LNCaP cells, whereas pAKT was decreased. Overexpression and inhibition experiments with SHP-1 siRNA showed that SHP-1 reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in both cell lines. Microarray analysis revealed 80 up-regulated and 87 down-regulated SHP-1-related genes in the LNCaP-IL6+ cell line compared with LNCaP cells.

This study assesses the combination of well tolerated and orally bioavailable formulations of ginsenoside Rh2 or its aglycone aPPD with docetaxel.  Methods:   The in vitro activity of Rh2, aPPD, and docetaxel was determined in four prostate cancer cell lines: PC-3, LNCaP, DU145, and C4-2. Combinations of Rh2 or aPPD with docetaxel were assessed using the constant ratio combination design. Combination Indices (CI) and Dose Reduction Indices (DRI) were subsequently estimated using Calcusyn. In vivo efficacy studies and Immunohistochemical analyses (PC-3 model) were also evaluated.  Results:   In PC-3, DU145 and C4-2 prostate cancer cells combinations of Rh2 or aPPD with docetaxel were predominantly additive or synergistic. Combinations of Rh2 + docetaxel and aPPD + docetaxel caused established PC-3 tumors to regress from their initial size by 15% and 27%, respectively.

Upregulation of this pathway can lead to an aberrant increase in cell growth and metabolism characteristic of malignant transformation.  Methods:   This study presents the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of the mTORC1 pathway in prostate neoplasia. The expression of p-mTOR and RAPTOR and p-p70(S6K1) and p-RPS6 were examined in HGPIN and PCa using tissue microarrays (TMA). Since each case in our TMAs was represented by three tissue cores, we quantified the IHC intratumoral heterogeneity of mTOR expression. This extensive analysis is the first detailed assessment documenting the IHC heterogeneity of mTOR expression in HGPIN and prostate cancer and represents the first IHC description of the mTORC1 pathway in HGPIN and PCa.  Results:   A Cochran-Armitage analysis demonstrated decreasing p-mTOR activity progressing from PIN through GL6 and GL7 to HG PCa. There was considerable intratumoral IHC heterogeneity within an individual patient. However, a statistically significant correlation was observed between p-mTOR, p-p70(S6K1), and p-RPS6 in each representative core.  Conclusion:   mTOR inhibitors may be an effective treatment for HGPIN and PCa.

The membrane anchored serine protease matriptase (also known as MT-SP1, epithin, and TADG15) has been implicated in prostate cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that the expression of this protease, both on the RNA and protein level is significantly increased during prostate cancer progression. Hepatocyte activator growth factor inhibitor-2 (HAI-2) has recently been identified as a physiological inhibitor of matriptase. It has been proposed that the increase of matriptase with a concomitant loss of its inhibitors may play a critical role in cancer progression.  Methods:   In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to determine the expression of HAI-2 protein in 136 prostate cancer samples, 20 prostate benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples, and 31 normal or tumor-adjacent prostate samples. Specificity of detection was ensured by using two unrelated HAI-2 antibodies and corresponding non-immune IgG antibodies.  Results:   We demonstrate that HAI-2 protein is significantly decreased in malignant lesions as compared to normal and BPH lesions, and that the most poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score 8-10) have the lowest level of HAI-2 expression.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that the loss of HAI-2 may be actively involved in prostate cancer progression by causing a reduced inhibitory capacity of proteolysis possibly of the physiological target for HAI-2 matriptase.""","""['Christopher Bergum', 'Karin List']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A novel biomarker for staging human prostate adenocarcinoma: overexpression of matriptase with concomitant loss of its inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1.', 'Expression of the serine protease matriptase and its inhibitor HAI-1 in epithelial ovarian cancer: correlation with clinical outcome and tumor clinicopathological parameters.', 'Strong expression association between matriptase and its substrate prostasin in breast cancer.', 'Serum hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type I (HAI-I) and type 2 (HAI-2) in prostate cancer.', 'Immunohistochemical analysis of the IL-6 family of cytokines and their receptors in benign, hyperplasic, and malignant human prostate.', 'The roles of proteases in prostate cancer.', 'Dysregulation of Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases and Ligand-Dependent Activation of MET in Urological Cancers.', 'Loss of SPINT2 expression frequently occurs in glioma, leading to increased growth and invasion via MMP2.', 'Cell surface-anchored serine proteases in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'STYK1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis by reducing SPINT2/HAI-2 expression in non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

This article compares the in vivo behavior and tumor uptake of three different radiolabeled anti-PSMA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and corresponding F(ab)(2) and Fab fragments thereof.  Methods:   The mAbs 3/A12, 3/F11, and 3/E7 and fragments of 3/A12 were conjugated with the chelating agent DOTA and radiolabeled with 64Cu. For the microPET imaging studies, SCID mice bearing PSMA-positive C4-2 and PSMA-negative DU 145 prostate cancer xenografts were used. Each animal received 20-30 microg radiolabeled mAb or fragment corresponding to an activity of 8-14 MBq. Imaging was performed 3, 24, and 48 hr post-injection. After the last scan, mice were sacrificed and tracer in vivo biodistribution was measured by gamma-counting.  Results:   Static microPET images of mice with PSMA-positive tumors revealed a high uptake of the mAbs in the C4-2 tumors at 24 and 48 hr after tracer injection and only a minimal distribution in the DU 145 tumors and other organs. In contrast, the F(ab)(2) and Fab fragments of 3/A12 were detected at a high extend in the kidney but not in the C4-2 tumors. These results were confirmed by gamma counting of dissected organs after the final imaging.

Methods:   Seventy-two patients with localized PCa were prospectively studied based on their blood samples before and after ADT for 6 months. Serum androgens and related values were measured.  Results:   Before ADT, there was no correlation between the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and androgen levels. After ADT, the serum PSA levels were correlated with each level of serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), and 3alpha-diol G (P < 0.010 in all). Before ADT, patients with Gleason score of > or = 8 were likely to have lower serum testosterone levels than those with Gleason score of < or = 6 (P = 0.058). After ADT, conversely, the testosterone levels in patients with Gleason score of > or = 8 appeared to be higher than in those with Gleason score of < or = 6 (P = 0.060). The serum DHEA-S level was correlated with Gleason score before and after ADT (P = 0.050 and P = 0.040, respectively).  Conclusions:   The serum PSA levels well reflect the androgen milieu in localized PCa patients receiving ADT, which can be explained by the Saturation Model and disease control. The androgen milieu in men with high Gleason score PCa is probably less affected by conventional ADT than that in men with low score cancer, which was suggested to be associated with adrenal androgen levels.""","""['Itsuhiro Takizawa', 'Tsutomu Nishiyama', 'Noboru Hara', 'Etsuko Isahaya', 'Tatsuhiko Hoshii', 'Kota Takahashi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Adrenocorticotropic hormone is involved in regulation of androgen synthesis in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-1 is associated with regulation of the luteinizing hormone production in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for localized prostate cancer.', 'The change in the dihydrotestosterone level in the prostate before and after androgen deprivation therapy in connection with prostate cancer aggressiveness using the Gleason score.', 'Testosterone and prostate cancer: revisiting old paradigms.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: anticipated side-effects and their management.', 'Using medical claims database to develop a population disease progression model for leuprorelin-treated subjects with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer volume associates with preoperative plasma levels of testosterone that independently predicts high grade tumours which show low densities (quotient testosterone/tumour volume).', 'Preoperative Plasma Levels of Total Testosterone Associated with High Grade Pathology-Detected Prostate Cancer: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Study in a Contemporary Cohort of Patients.', 'Predictive clinical indicators of biochemical progression in advanced prostate cancer patients receiving Leuplin depot as androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Maximal testosterone suppression in prostate cancer--free vs total testosterone.']"""

To translate this paradigm in the clinic, we completed a phase I study of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), and assessed 2DG uptake with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and the autophagy substrate p62 as a marker of 2DG resistance.  Methods:   Patients received 2DG orally on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle in cohorts of three in a dose-escalating manner. Correlative assessments included PET scans at baseline and day 2 and p62 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a potential marker of 2DG resistance.  Results:   The dose of 45 mg/kg was defined as the recommended phase II dose, secondary to dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 asymptomatic QTc prolongation at a dose of 60 mg/kg. PK evaluation of 2DG revealed linear pharmacokinetics with C(max) 45 microg/ml (277 microM), 73.7 microg/ml (449 microM), and 122 microg/ml (744 microM) in dose levels 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg, respectively. Five of eight patients assessed with FDG-PET scanning demonstrated decreased FDG uptake by day 2 of therapy, suggesting competition of 2DG with FDG. Five of six patients assessed for p62 had a decrease in p62 at 24 hr.  Conclusions:   These data support the safety of 2DG, defined 2DG PK, demonstrated the effect of 2DG on FDG-PET imaging, and demonstrated the feasibility of assessment of p62 as an autophagic resistance marker.

In order to help circumvent this challenge, we sought to develop an in vitro assay of human prostate cancer initiation employing a prostate-associated mesenchymal feeder layer.  Methods:   Rat seminal vesicle mesenchyme (rSVM) harvested from male neonatal rats was plated in 12-well plates and then irradiated with 30 Gy after approximately 75% confluence. Single-cell suspensions of two human non-adherent prostate cancer xenograft lines (TRPC and LAPC9) were then plated on irradiated rSVM. At 3-4 weeks, three-dimensional solid structures, termed glandoids, were harvested and analyzed or transplanted singly into the renal capsule of immunodeficient mice. Animals were assessed for tumor formation 8-12 weeks after engraftment. Finally, clonality assays were performed to determine whether glandoids usually arise from a single cell and are therefore clonal in origin.  Results:   Glandoids form with reliable frequency (1/ approximately 300 plated cells), are constituted by relevant cell types (CK8+, CK5-, PSA+) and after implantation into immunocompromised mice, give rise to tumors that recapitulate original xenograft histology and cell composition; defining a glandoid as a tumor-initiating unit. In addition, assessment of red fluorescent protein (RFP)-labeled glandoids revealed either all red or non-red structures, with few areas of fusion, suggesting glandoids are clonal in origin.

Since taxanes also stabilize microtubules, we hypothesized that the administration of vorinostat followed by docetaxel should result in synergistic cytotoxicity. We conducted a phase I trial to determine the dose level of vorinostat plus docetaxel that would result in dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in ≤30% of patients.  Methods:   Eligible patients had castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or relapsed urothelial or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after ≥1 prior chemotherapy regimen not containing docetaxel, performance status of 0-2, and adequate organ function. Vorinostat was given orally for 14 days beginning on day 1 of a 21-day cycle, with docetaxel given intravenously over 1 h on day 4. The time-to-event continuous reassessment method (TITE-CRM) guided dose escalation. Dose levels (DL) -1, 0, 1 and 2 corresponded to vorinostat 100, 100, 200 and 200 mg plus docetaxel 50, 60, 60, and 75 mg/m(2), respectively. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed on days 1 and 4 of cycle 1.  Results:   Twelve patients were enrolled: median age 65 years (range 49-74); 9 male, 3 female; 4 CRPC, 5 urothelial, 3 NSCLC. The median number of cycles administered was 2. Two patients were treated at DL -1, 4 at DL 0, 5 at DL 1 and 1 at DL 2. Five DLTs occurred in 5 patients: neutropenic fever/sepsis (2), anaphylactic reaction (1), myocardial infarction (1) and gastrointestinal bleed (1). Other toxicities included grade 3/4 neutropenia (4), peripheral neuropathy (1), and gastrointestinal bleed (n = 1). The estimated probability of DLT for DL -1 was 0.32 (90% posterior probability interval [PI], 0.11 to 0.53) for DL 0, 0.38 (90% PI, 0.16 to 0.58) and for DL 1, 0.43 (90% PI, 0.23 to 0.64). The trial was stopped due to excessive toxicity. No responses were noted.

In this study, we provided evidences that genipin induced the death of HeLa cells through apoptotic pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Genipin could remarkably induce cytotoxicity in HeLa cells and inhibit its proliferation. Induction of the apoptosis by genipin was confirmed by analysis of DNA fragmentation and induction of sub-G(1) peak through flow cytometry. The results also showed that genipin-treated HeLa cells cycle was arrested at G(1) phase. Western blot analysis revealed that the phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) protein, phospho-Jun protein, p53 protein and bax protein significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner after treatment of genipin for 24 h, and to our knowledge, the activation of JNK maybe result in the increase of the p53 protein level, and the increase of the p53 protein led to the accumulation of bax protein, bax protein further induced cell apoptotic death eventually.

Drug-specific modulation of oncogenic signaling pathways in specific patient subpopulations can predict responsiveness to targeted therapy. Here, we report a pathway-based phosphoprofiling approach to identify and quantify clinically relevant, drug-specific biomarkers for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors that target AKT, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), and PI3K-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We quantified 375 nonredundant PI3K pathway-relevant phosphopeptides, all containing AKT, PDK1, or mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate recognition motifs. Of these phosphopeptides, 71 were drug-regulated, 11 of them by all three inhibitors. Drug-modulated phosphoproteins were enriched for involvement in cytoskeletal reorganization (filamin, stathmin, dynamin, PAK4, and PTPN14), vesicle transport (LARP1, VPS13D, and SLC20A1), and protein translation (S6RP and PRAS40). We then generated phosphospecific antibodies against selected, drug-regulated phosphorylation sites that would be suitable as biomarker tools for PI3K pathway inhibitors. As proof of concept, we show clinical translation feasibility for an antibody against phospho-PRAS40(Thr246). Evaluation of binding of this antibody in human cancer cell lines, a PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10)-deficient mouse prostate tumor model, and triple-negative breast tumor tissues showed that phospho-PRAS40(Thr246) positively correlates with PI3K pathway activation and predicts AKT inhibitor sensitivity. In contrast to phosphorylation of AKT(Thr308), the phospho-PRAS40(Thr246) epitope is highly stable in tissue samples and thus is ideal for immunohistochemistry.

Numerous small animal models of cancer metastasis to bone have been developed to study tumor-induced bone destruction, but the advancement of imaging modalities utilized for these models has lagged significantly behind clinical imaging. Therefore, there is a significant need for improvements to live small animal imaging, particularly when obtaining high-resolution images for longitudinal quantitative analyses. Recently, live animal micro-computed tomography (μCT) has gained popularity due to its ability to obtain high-resolution 3-dimensional images. However, the utility of μCT in bone metastasis models has been limited to end-point analyses due to off-target radiation effects on tumor cells. We hypothesized that live animal in vivo μCT can be utilized to perform reproducible and quantitative longitudinal analyses of bone volume in tumor-bearing mice, particularly in a drug treatment model of breast cancer metastasis to bone. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the MDA-MB-231 osteolytic breast cancer model in which the tumor cells are inoculated directly into the tibia of athymic nude mice and imaged mice weekly by Faxitron (radiography), Imtek μCT (in vivo), and Maestro (GFP-imaging). Exvivo μCT and histology were performed at end point for validation. After establishing a high-resolution scanning protocol for the Imtek CT, we determined whether clear, measurable differences in bone volume were detectable in mice undergoing bisphosphonate drug treatments. We found that in vivo μCT could be used to obtain quantifiable and longitudinal images of the progression of bone destruction over time without altering tumor cell growth. In addition, we found that we could detect lesions as early as week 1 and that this approach could be used to monitor the effect of drug treatment on bone. Taken together, these data indicate that in vivo μCT is an effective and reproducible method for longitudinal monitoring of tumor-associated bone destruction in mouse models of tumor-induced bone disease.""","""['Lindsay C Johnson', 'Rachelle W Johnson', 'Steve A Munoz', 'Gregory R Mundy', 'Todd E Peterson', 'Julie A Sterling']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Bone""","""['Tracking the Progression of Osteolytic and Osteosclerotic Lesions in Mice Using Serial In Vivo μCT: Applications to the Assessment of Bisphosphonate Treatment Efficacy.', 'Evaluation of the combined use of metronomic zoledronic acid and Coriolus versicolor in intratibial breast cancer mouse model.', 'Flat-panel detector-based volume computed tomography: a novel 3D imaging technique to monitor osteolytic bone lesions in a mouse tumor metastasis model.', 'Parathyroid hormone-related protein and bone metastases.', 'Actions of bisphosphonate on bone metastasis in animal models of breast carcinoma.', 'Mouse Models of Tumor Bone Metastasis and Invasion for Studying CCN Proteins.', 'Animal Model for Glucocorticoid Induced Osteoporosis: A Systematic Review from 2011 to 2021.', 'Moderate tibial loading and treadmill running, but not overloading, protect adult murine bone from destruction by metastasized breast cancer.', 'Sex-specific responses in trabecular and cortical microstructure of tibia due to repeated irradiation from micro-computed tomography in adult CD-1 mice.', 'A highly efficient murine model of experimental myopia.']"""

The maximum diameters of the prostate were measured before treatment by transrectal ultrasound volumetry along right to left (RL), anterior to posterior (AP), and apex to base (Length) directions. The seeds were inserted by the modified peripheral loading method using real-time ultrasound-guided seed placement.

Methods:   We collected tissue samples and paired serum samples from 3 cases of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) treated by surgical resection, and included another 3 samples of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue and normal human serum in the control group. The total proteins extracted were separated and transmembrane by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by hybridization with the sera of the patients with ADPC and those with hormone-independent prostate cancer (HIPC) as the primary antibodies. The differentially expressed proteins were compared by Western blot, analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS mass spectrography, and verified by RT-PCR and Western blot following bioinformatic identification.  Results:   This modified method exhibited a significantly better effect in displaying differentially expressed proteins, by which 12 differentially expressed protein spots were identified, including Beclin1, glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1-1), ZBTB7, dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 2 (DDH), enolase (ENO1), glucose-dependent insulin-releasing peptide receptor (GIPR), Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), amino-peptidyl-prolyl cistrons isomerase (PPIA), and phospholipid-PE-binding protein (PEBP).

Osteoclastic cellular activity has been proposed as an initiating event for skeletal metastasis. Megakaryocytes (MKs) inhibit osteoclastogenesis, which could have an impact on tumor establishment in bone. Given the location of mature MKs at vascular sinusoids, they may be the first cells to physically encounter cancer cells as they enter the bone marrow. Identification of the interaction between MKs and prostate cancer cells was the focus of this study. K562 (human MK precursors) and primary MKs derived from mouse bone marrow hematopoietic precursor cells potently suppressed prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells in coculture. The inhibitory effects were specific to prostate carcinoma cells and were enhanced by direct cell-cell contact. Flow cytometry for propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V supported a proapoptotic role for K562 cells in limiting PC-3 cells. Gene expression analysis revealed reduced mRNA levels for cyclin D1, whereas mRNA levels of apoptosis-associated specklike protein containing a CARD (ASC) and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) were increased in PC-3 cells after coculture with K562 cells. Recombinant thrombopoietin (TPO) was used to expand MKs in the marrow and resulted in decreased skeletal lesion development after intracardiac tumor inoculation. These novel findings suggest a potent inhibitory role of MKs in prostate carcinoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo. This new finding, of an interaction of metastatic tumors and hematopoietic cells during tumor colonization in bone, ultimately will lead to improved therapeutic interventions for prostate cancer patients.""","""['Xin Li', 'Amy J Koh', 'Zhengyan Wang', 'Fabiana N Soki', 'Serk In Park', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Laurie K McCauley']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Bone Miner Res""","""['GSK-3β negatively regulates megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production from primary human bone marrow cells in vitro.', 'Growth and maturation of megakaryocytes is regulated by Lnk/Sh2b3 adaptor protein through crosstalk between cytokine- and integrin-mediated signals.', 'A novel role for thrombopoietin in regulating osteoclast development in humans and mice.', 'Megakaryocytes in Bone Metastasis: Protection or Progression?', 'The role of osteoclastic activity in prostate cancer skeletal metastases.', 'Role of Nitric Oxide in Megakaryocyte Function.', 'S100 Calcium-Binding Protein P Secreted from Megakaryocytes Promotes Osteoclast Maturation.', 'Emerging roles for myeloid immune cells in bone metastasis.', 'Bone marrow niches in the regulation of bone metastasis.', 'Platelets and Metastasis: New Implications of an Old Interplay.']"""

MS-MLPA detects genetic and epigenetic aberrations of 37 tumor suppressor genes (TSG) in a single reaction and might, therefore, avoid the cumbersome single gene analyses.  Methods:   The validity of MS-MLPA for using cell-free plasma DNA was assessed by analyzing blood and BM samples of 91 patients with prostate cancer. As reference analyses, the methylation patterns of 4 genes (CD44, E-cadherin, CDKN2A and PTEN) chosen from the TSG set of the MS-MLPA kit were investigated in single reactions by sodium bisulfite DNA sequencing.  Results:   Copy number changes and aberrant DNA methylation of 37 circulating TSG could be analyzed in BM and blood of 30 and 13 of the 91 patients, respectively, whereas the DNA content in the remaining samples was too low (<50 ng/μl of eluted DNA). The copy number of 28 of the 37 TSG was altered, and most changes were found for APC, CHFR, TP73 and GSTP1 genes in BM plasma. Statistical evaluations showed an association between copy number changes of TP73 and a positive resection margin of the prostate (p = 0.05). Both MS-MLPA and sodium bisulfite sequencing techniques showed that all genes were unmethylated.

Results:   Using propensity score adjustment with inverse probability weights, general anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia resulted in improved clinical progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.75, P=0.002).

There have been no head-to-head clinical trials comparing pamidronate and zoledronic acid among patients with advanced prostate cancer.  Objective:   To estimate the risk of developing an SRE among men with metastatic prostate cancer after being treated with either pamidronate or zoledronic acid.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted, using data from Kaiser Permanente's Southern California Region. The cohort included men aged > or = 18 years diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1998 to 2004 who received at least 1 infusion of either pamidronate or zoledronic acid after their cancer diagnosis. Patients receiving both drugs and those with a documented SRE prior to diagnosis were excluded. The primary outcome of SREs was defined using diagnosis codes for fractures, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Secondary outcomes were deterioration in renal function, based on serum creatinine laboratory results, and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict SREs and mortality risk for pamidronate compared to zoledronic acid. The proportion of patients with renal function deterioration was analyzed using chi(2) tests.  Results:   The cohort included 118 patients treated with pamidronate and 274 treated with zoledronic acid. Results showed no significant difference in risk of SREs for pamidronate versus zoledronic acid (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.67; p = 0.98). No significant difference was found in renal function deterioration (chi(2) 2.08; p = 0.15) or mortality (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17; p = 0.18).  Conclusions:   For patients with prostate cancer, the choice between these 2 bisphosphonates must be balanced between the shorter infusion time of zoledronic acid versus its increased costs.

Tumor tissues are a heterogeneous mixture of not only cancer cells, but also supportive and reactive tumor microenvironment elements. To clarify the clinical significance of altered miRNA expression in solid tumors, we developed a sensitive fluorescence-based in situ hybridization (ISH) method to visualize miRNA accumulation within individual cells in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. This ISH method was implemented to be compatible with routine clinical immunohistochemical (IHC) assays to enable the detection of miRNAs and protein markers in the same tissue section for colocalization and functional studies.  Experimental design:   We used this combined ISH/IHC assay to study a subset of cancer-associated miRNAs, including miRNAs frequently detected at low (miR-34a and miR-126) and high (miR-21 and miR-155) levels, in a panel of breast, colorectal, lung, pancreas, and prostate carcinomas.  Results:   Despite the distinct histopathologic alterations of each particular cancer type, general trends emerged that pinpointed distinct source cells of altered miRNA expression. Although altered expressions of miR-21 and miR-34a were manifested within cancer cells, those of miR-126 and miR-155 were predominantly confined to endothelial cells and immune cells, respectively. These results suggest a heterogeneous participation of miRNAs in carcinogenesis by intrinsically affecting cancer cell biology or by modulating stromal, vascular, and immune responses.  Conclusions:   We described a rapid and sensitive multicolor ISH/IHC assay and showed that it could be broadly applied as an investigational tool to better understand the etiologic relevance of altered miRNA expression in cancer.""","""['Lorenzo F Sempere', 'Meir Preis', 'Todd Yezefski', 'Haoxu Ouyang', 'Arief A Suriawinata', 'Asli Silahtaroglu', 'Jose R Conejo-Garcia', 'Sakari Kauppinen', 'Wendy Wells', 'Murray Korc']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['A method for conducting highly sensitive microRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis in pancreatic cancer.', 'Fully automated fluorescence-based four-color multiplex assay for co-detection of microRNA and protein biomarkers in clinical tissue specimens.', 'Demonstration of microRNA using in situ hybridisation on formalin fixed paraffin wax samples using conventional oligonucleotide probes: a comparison with the use of locked nucleic acid probes.', 'Tissue slide-based microRNA characterization of tumors: how detailed could diagnosis become for cancer medicine?', 'Quantitative measurement of cancer tissue biomarkers in the lab and in the clinic.', 'Extracellular vesicle biomarkers for pancreatic cancer diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', ""Nickel's Role in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: Potential Involvement of microRNAs."", 'Epigenetic regulation of ferroptosis via ETS1/miR-23a-3p/ACSL4 axis mediates sorafenib resistance in human hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Role of non-coding RNAs in tumor progression and metastasis in pancreatic cancer.', 'microRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer medicine.']"""

Nrf2, a redox-sensing transcription factor, on constitutive activation in non-small-cell lung cancer cells upregulates a wide spectrum of genes involved in redox balance, glutathione metabolism, and drug detoxification, which contribute to chemoresistance and tumorigenicity. This study examined the mechanism underlying Nrf2-dependent expression of ABCG2 and its role in the multidrug resistance phenotype. In silico analysis of the 5'-promoter flanking region of ABCG2 identified an antioxidant response element (ARE) at -431 to -420 bp. A detailed promoter analysis using luciferase reporter assays showed that ARE at -431 to -420 bp is critical for the Nrf2-mediated expression in lung cancer cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Nrf2 interacts with the ABCG2 ARE element at -431 to -420 bp in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of Nrf2 expression in lung and prostate cancer cells, by short hairpin RNA, attenuated the expression of ABCG2 transcript and protein, and dramatically reduced the SP fraction in Nrf2-depleted cancer cells. Moreover, depleted levels of ABCG2 in these Nrf2 knockdown cells sensitized them to mitoxantrone and topotecan, two chemotherapy drugs detoxified mainly by ABCG2. As expected, overexpression of Nrf2 cDNA in lung epithelial cells led to an increase in ABCG2 expression and a 2-fold higher SP fraction. Thus, Nrf2-mediated regulation of ABCG2 expression maintains the SP fraction and confers chemoresistance.""","""['Anju Singh', 'Hailong Wu', 'Ping Zhang', 'Christine Happel', 'Jinfang Ma', 'Shyam Biswal']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Elevated Expression of Nrf-2 and ABCG2 Involved in Multi-drug Resistance of Lung Cancer SP Cells.', 'Transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 regulate expression of human ABCG2 gene and chemoresistance phenotype.', 'Transcriptional modulation of BCRP gene to reverse multidrug resistance by toremifene in breast adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy and xenobiotic protection mediated by the half ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2.', 'Role of Nrf2 in cancer photodynamic therapy: regulation of human ABC transporter ABCG2.', 'The mechanistic insights of the antioxidant Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in oncogenesis: a deadly scenario.', 'NFR2/ABC transporter axis in drug resistance of breast cancer cells.', 'Ferroptosis and its role in skeletal muscle diseases.', 'Epigenetic Therapeutics Targeting NRF2/KEAP1 Signaling in Cancer Oxidative Stress.', 'Emerging role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in the mechanism of action and resistance to anticancer therapies.']"""

Furthermore, the activated state and the number of gamma delta T cells and changes in serum PSA levels were examined for patients who received ZOL infusion for the prevention of SREs. We found that ZOL activated gamma delta T cells, and the number of gamma delta T cell was increased when IL-2 was administered with ZOL in vitro. Comparisons before and after the first ZOL infusion revealed that gamma delta T cells in peripheral blood were activated by ZOL. Moreover, after the first ZOL treatment, reduction in serum PSA was observed in 3 of 11 patients, and reduction in PSA velocity was observed in 5 of 10 patients.

In particular, conflicting data exist whether ascorbate may increase the cytotoxic effects of antineoplastic drugs or may rather exert adverse effects on drug sensitivity during cancer treatment. Findings are further obscured regarding the distinction between ascorbate and dehydroascorbate (DHA). Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and directly compare the cytotoxic efficacy of ascorbate compared to DHA, and to analyse if ascorbate at pharmacological concentrations affects the efficacy of antineoplastic agents in prostate carcinoma cells.  Methods:   We directly compare the effects of ascorbate (supplied as 'Pascorbin solution for injection') and DHA on tumor cell viability, and determine IC(50) values for various cell lines. At concentrations well below the IC(50), ascorbate effects on cell proliferation and cell cycle are analysed. We furthermore determine changes in cellular sensitivity towards various cytostatic drugs upon pre-treatment of cells with ascorbate.  Results:   We demonstrate higher therapeutic efficacy of ascorbate over DHA in various cell lines, independent of cell line-specific differences in ascorbate sensitivity, and identify the extracellular generation of H(2)O(2) as critical mechanism of ascorbate action. We furthermore show that, in addition to pro-apoptotic effects described previously, ascorbate treatment already at concentrations well below the IC(50) exerts anti-proliferative effects on tumor cells. Those are based on interference with the cell cycle, namely by inducing a G(0)/G(1) arrest. Pre-treatment of tumor cells with ascorbate leads to increased cellular sensitivity towards Docetaxel, Epirubicin, Irinotecan and 5-FU, but not towards Oxaliplatin and Vinorelbin. For Docetaxel and 5-FU, a linear correlation between this sensitizing effect and the ascorbate dosage is observed.  Conclusions:   The redox-active form of vitamin C, ascorbate, shows therapeutic efficacy in tumor cells. These antitumor effects of ascorbate are mainly based on its extracellular action and, in addition to the induction of apoptosis, also include an anti-proliferative effect by inducing cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, ascorbate treatment specifically enhances the cytostatic potency of certain chemotherapeutics, which implicates therapeutic benefit during tumor treatment.""","""['Anja Frömberg', 'Daniela Gutsch', 'Daniel Schulze', 'Claudia Vollbracht', 'Gabriele Weiss', 'Frank Czubayko', 'Achim Aigner']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Docetaxel-ST1481 sequence exerts a potent cytotoxic activity on hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells by reducing drug resistance-related gene expression.', 'Dose enhancement effect of anticaner drugs associated with increased temperature in vitro.', 'Pharmacological Ascorbate Suppresses Growth of Gastric Cancer Cells with GLUT1 Overexpression and Enhances the Efficacy of Oxaliplatin Through Redox Modulation.', 'Gastric cancer.

Mortality due to metastatic melanoma, one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers, has increased steadily over the last several decades. Unfortunately, the arsenal of chemotherapeutic agents available today is most often unsuccessful at extending and improving the life expectancy of afflicted individuals. We sought to identify an effective and nontoxic agent against metastatic melanoma.  Methodology/principal findings:   We chose to study Cloudman S-91 mouse melanoma cells (sub-clone M3, CCL53.1) because these cells are highly aggressive and metastatic, representing one of the deadliest types of cancer. Melanoma cells also had an experimental advantage because their morphology, which is easily monitored, relates to the physiology of metastatic cells and normal melanocytes. We chose to test methyl sulfone as a chemotherapeutic agent for two reasons. Because of its chemical structure, we speculated a potential anti-cancer activity by targeting microtubules. Equally important, methyl sulfone has a well-established safety profile in humans. Surprisingly, we found that malignant melanoma cells exposed to methyl sulfone demonstrated the loss of phenotypes characteristic of malignant cells, and the reemergence of phenotypes characteristic of healthy melanocytes. Briefly, over time methyl sulfone induced contact inhibition, loss of ability to migrate through an extracellular matrix, loss of anchorage-independent growth, proper wound healing followed by contact inhibition, irreversible senescence followed by arborization with melanosomes in arbors as seen in normal melanocytes.  Conclusions/significance:   Methyl sulfone may have clinical potential as a non-toxic agent effective against metastatic melanoma. Additionally, methyl sulfone has promise as a tool to explore molecular mechanisms of metastatic transformation as well as fundamental processes such as cell migration, contact inhibition, wound healing and cellular senescence.""","""['Joan McIntyre Caron', 'Marissa Bannon', 'Lindsay Rosshirt', 'Jessica Luis', 'Luke Monteagudo', 'John M Caron', 'Gerson Marc Sternstein']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Methyl sulfone manifests anticancer activity in a metastatic murine breast cancer cell line and in human breast cancer tissue--part 2: human breast cancer tissue.', 'Methyl sulfone manifests anticancer activity in a metastatic murine breast cancer cell line and in human breast cancer tissue--part I: murine 4T1 (66cl-4) cell line.', 'Methyl Sulfone Blocked Multiple Hypoxia- and Non-Hypoxia-Induced Metastatic Targets in Breast Cancer Cells and Melanoma Cells.', 'Lessons from melanocyte development for understanding the biological events in naevus and melanoma formation.', 'The matrix environmental and cell mechanical properties regulate cell migration and contribute to the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.', 'Transforming cancer cells for long-term living with cancer: An inspiring new approach.', 'Mutation or not, what directly establishes a neoplastic state, namely cellular immortality and autonomy, still remains unknown and should be prioritized in our research.', 'Natural Sulfurs Inhibit LPS-Induced Inflammatory Responses through NF-κB Signaling in CCD-986Sk Skin Fibroblasts.', 'Non-toxic sulfur inhibits LPS-induced inflammation by\xa0regulating TLR-4 and JAK2/STAT3 through IL-6 signaling.', 'Potential antitumor activity of digitoxin and user-designed analog administered to human lung cancer cells.']"""

From 1996 to 2004, 608 patients with advanced prostate cancer were included in the study. Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups according to different therapeutic regimens. Of the 608 patients, 300 patients were treated with MAB (castration plus nonsteroidal antiandrogens) and the remaining 308 were treated with castration alone. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates of these patients were 73.7% and 56%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, MAB was associated with not only the improvement of progression-free survival (PFS) (increased by 10 months) but also a 20.6% reduction in mortality risk compared with castration alone. In contrast, the efficacy of MAB was not superior to castration alone for patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Interestingly, among patients with MAB, those using bicalutamide had a longer PFS than those using flutamide; this was especially so in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Almost all of the toxicities due to the hormone therapy were mild to moderate and manageable. To conclude, in China, hormone therapies, including MAB and castration alone, have been standard treatments for advanced prostate cancer. For patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, castration alone might be adequately practical and efficient. In patients with metastatic prostate cancer, however, MAB has superior efficacy over castration alone. It is clear that MAB should be considered the first-line standard treatment for patients with metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Xue-Qin Chen', 'Ying Huang', 'Xiang Li', 'Peng Zhang', 'Rui Huang', 'Juan Xia', 'Ni Chen', 'Qiang Wei', 'Yu-Chun Zhu', 'Yu-Ru Yang', 'Hao Zeng']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Alternative nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy for advanced prostate cancer that relapsed after initial maximum androgen blockade.', 'Clinical outcome of maximum androgen blockade using flutamide as second-line hormonal therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Maximal androgen blockade for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen response to deferred combined androgen blockade therapy using bicalutamide predicts survival after subsequent oestrogen and docetaxel therapies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Potential New Approaches for Prostate Cancer Management in Resource-Limited Countries in Africa.', 'A novel germline BRCA2 mutation in a Chinese patient with prostate cancer sensitive to platinum chemotherapy: a case report.', 'Adjuvant hormone therapy after radical prostatectomy in high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer: First multicenter, observational study in China.', 'Usefulness of combined androgen blockade therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist for bone metastatic prostate cancer with pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level ≥ 50 ng/mL.', 'Impact of ethnicity on the outcome of men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.']"""

In approximately 90% of cases, the rearrangement is characterized by fusion of the androgen-regulated gene TMPRSS2 with the oncogene ERG. A recent study suggested that TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion is lacking in cancers arising from the transition zone of the prostate. A dominant transition zone cancer was detected in 62/397 (16%) patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution and were reviewed and mapped by a single pathologist. In 46/62 specimens, a secondary tumor was identified in the peripheral zone of the prostate. A tissue microarray containing both transition and peripheral zone tumors was constructed and evaluated for gene fusion analysis. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion status was determined using a multicolor interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization assay for ERG break-apart. The median age of the patients was 59 years. Prostatectomy Gleason score was 6 in 21, 7 in 34, and ≥8 in 7 cases. Median tumor volume was 200 mm(2). TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion was present in 7/59 (12%) transition zone, and in 12/35 (34%) peripheral zone tumors. Transition zone fusion-positive cases were larger than their negative counterparts. No significant correlation was found between fusion status and Gleason score or pathologic stage. Gene fusion through deletion occurred in 4/7 transition zone and 7/12 peripheral zone tumors. Transition zone prostate cancers are considered biologically and genetically different from peripheral zone tumors. Although ERG rearrangement is more common in peripheral zone tumors, we have detected TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in a subset of transition zone cancers (12%). The lower frequency of gene fusion in transition zone prostate cancer may suggest distinct molecular alterations from peripheral zone tumors and the association with a high tumor volume may indicate a growth advantage for transition zone tumors harboring the gene fusion. Further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.""","""['Sara M Falzarano', 'Maria Navas', 'Kelly Simmerman', 'Eric A Klein', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Ming Zhou', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['ETS family-associated gene fusions in Japanese prostate cancer: analysis of 194 radical prostatectomy samples.', 'Prostate cancer of transition zone origin lacks TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.', 'Prevalence of TMPRSS2-ERG and SLC45A3-ERG gene fusions in a large prostatectomy cohort.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'Differences in the pathogenetic characteristics of prostate cancer in the transitional and peripheral zones and the possible molecular biological mechanisms.', 'Impact of Zone of Origin in Anterior Dominant Prostate Cancer: Long-Term Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in an Anatomically Well-Characterized Cohort.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.', 'Transition zone prostate cancer is associated with better clinical outcomes than peripheral zone cancer.', 'Prostate zones and cancer: lost in transition?']"""

It is now common knowledge that significant variability in gene alterations exists according to ethnic background in various kinds of cancer. In this study, we evaluated gene fusions involving the ETS gene family in Japanese prostate cancer. Total RNA from 194 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded prostate cancer samples obtained by radical prostatectomy was subjected to reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect the common TMPRSS2:ERG T1-E4 and T1-E5 fusion transcripts and five other non-TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts. We identified 54 TMPRSS2:ERG-positive cases (54/194, 28%) and two HNRPA2B1:ETV1-positive cases (2/194, 1%). The SLC45A3-ELK4 transcript, a fusion transcript without structural gene rearrangement, was detectable in five cases (5/194, 3%). The frequencies of both TMPRSS2:ERG- and non-TMPRSS2:ERG-positive cases were lower than those reported for European, North American or Brazilian patients. Internodular heterogeneity of TMPRSS2:ERG was observed in 5 out of 11 multifocal cases (45%); a frequency similar to that found in European and North American cases. We found a positive correlation between the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and a Gleason score of ≤7 and patient age, but found no relationship with pT stage or plasma prostate-specific antigen concentration. To exclude the possibility that Japanese prostate cancer displays novel TMPRSS2:ERG transcript variants or has unique 5' fusion partners for the ETS genes, we performed 5' RACE using fresh-frozen prostate cancer samples. We identified only the normal 5' cDNA ends for ERG, ETV1 and ETV5 in fusion-negative cases.

In addition to driving the expression of genes promoting malignancy, STAT3 associates with tubulin and can promote cell migration. Because microtubule-targeted drugs are among the most active agents used in the treatment of breast cancer, we examined whether microtubule-based chemotherapy modulates STAT3 activity. When treated with paclitaxel or vinorelbine, breast cancer cells with constitutive activation of STAT3 display a loss of STAT3 phosphorylation, and paclitaxel disrupts the interaction of STAT3 with tubulin. Paclitaxel also inhibits cytokine-induced STAT3 activation. This effect is specific for microtubule-targeted agents, because other chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin, have no effect on STAT3. The loss of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is also reflected in an inhibition of expression of STAT3 target genes. This effect is not restricted to breast cancer, because similar effects are also seen in ovarian cancer and prostate cancer cells. Thus, in addition to their role in disrupting microtubule function, microtubule-targeted agents also suppress STAT3 signaling. This may be an important component of their activity, raising the possibility that microtubule targeted therapy may be particularly effective in tumors characterized by STAT3 activation.""","""['Sarah R Walker', 'Mousumi Chaudhury', 'Erik A Nelson', 'David A Frank']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 pathway activation in drug-resistant ovarian cancer.', 'Inhibition of Stat3 increases doxorubicin sensitivity in a human metastatic breast cancer cell line.', '8-benzyl-4-oxo-8-azabicyclo3.2.1oct-2-ene-6,7-dicarboxylic acid (SD-1008), a novel janus kinase 2 inhibitor, increases chemotherapy sensitivity in human ovarian cancer cells.', 'Inhibiting aberrant Stat3 function with molecular therapeutics: a progress report.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3): a promising target for anticancer therapy.', 'S-72, a Novel Orally Available Tubulin Inhibitor, Overcomes Paclitaxel Resistance via Inactivation of the STING Pathway in Breast Cancer.', ""Why Don't the Mutant Cells That Evade DNA Repair Cause Cancer More Frequently?

The Web-based PSA decision aid, Prosdex, was developed as part of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme in order to help men make such informed decisions.  Objectives:   The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the Web-based PSA decision aid, Prosdex, on informed decision making.  Methods:   A Web-based randomized controlled trial was conducted in South Wales, United Kingdom. Men aged 50 to 75 who had not previously had a PSA test were randomly allocated to two intervention and two control groups. Participants in the intervention groups either viewed Prosdex or were given a paper version of the text. The main outcome measures were the three components of informed decision making: (1) knowledge of prostate cancer and PSA, (2) attitude toward PSA testing, (3) behavior using a proxy measure, intention to undergo PSA testing. Decisional conflict and anxiety were also measured as was uptake of the PSA test. Outcomes were measured by means of an online questionnaire for the Prosdex group, the paper version group, and one of two control groups. Six months later, PSA test uptake was ascertained from general practitioners' records, and the online questionnaire was repeated. Results are reported in terms of the Mann-Whitney U-statistic divided by the product of the two sample sizes (U/mm), line of no effect 0.50.  Results:   Participants were 514 men. Compared with the control group that completed the initial online questionnaire, men in the Prosdex group had increased knowledge about the PSA test and prostate cancer (U/mn 0.70; 95% CI 0.62 - 0.76); less favourable attitudes to PSA testing (U/mn 0.39, 95% CI 0.31 - 0.47); were less likely to undergo PSA testing (U/mn 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 - 0.48); and had less decisional conflict (U/mn 0.32, 95% CI 0.25 - 0.40); while anxiety level did not differ (U/mn 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 - 0.58). For these outcomes there were no significant differences between men in the Prosdex group and the paper version group. However, in the Prosdex group, increased knowledge was associated with a less favourable attitude toward testing (Spearman rank correlation [rho] = -0.49, P < .001) and lower intention to undergo testing (rho = -0.27, P = .02). After six months, PSA test uptake was lower in the Prosdex group than in the paper version and the questionnaire control group (P = .014). Test uptake was also lower in the control group that did not complete a questionnaire than in the control group that did, suggesting a possible Hawthorne effect of the questionnaire in favour of PSA testing.  Conclusions:   Exposure to Prosdex was associated with improved knowledge about the PSA test and prostate cancer. Men who had a high level of knowledge had a less favourable attitude toward and were less likely to undergo PSA testing. Prosdex appears to promote informed decision making regarding the PSA test.

Methods:   We restricted our study to 108 patients with Gleason score (GS) 7, nonfocal extraprostatic extension (EPE) (Stage pT3a), and positive surgical margins. Patients with a tertiary pattern 5, those who had received neoadjuvant therapy, and those with positive margins because of an intraprostatic incision were excluded.  Results:   The overall GS was 3 + 4 in 73 patients (67%) and 4 + 3 in 35 (33%). The median length of the positive margin was 3.0 mm (range 0.5-10). The GS at the margin was 3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, and 4 + 4 in 40 (37%), 41 (38%), 16 (14.8%), and 11 (10.2%) cases, respectively. Of the 108 patients, 45 (42%) remained free of disease after RP (median follow-up 6 years, range 3-13). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed no correlation between biochemical recurrence and either the preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen level (P = .7) or overall GS (P = .5). A strong association was noted between biochemical recurrence and the GS at the positive surgical margin (P = .007), with length of cancer at the margin also predictive (P = .015) on multivariate analysis. Using the median length of the positive margin (3 mm) as the cutoff, the association with biochemical recurrence was significantly different between the 2 groups (P = .004) using Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to show that the grade of cancer at the site of a positive margin influences the outcome. We were able to stratify the grade into 3 categories: 3 + 3, 3 + 4, and 4 + 3 or greater (4 + 3 and 4 + 4 at the positive margin provided equal prognostic information).""","""['Fadi Brimo', 'Alan W Partin', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.

Here, we observed that RB inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation and induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner, but exerted very little inhibitory effect on noncancerous prostate epithelial cell viability. Treatment of androgen-independent PC-3 cells with RB caused a moderate increase in p21(Cip1), and enforced the cell cycle arrest in the S phase. A block of S phase was accompanied with decreases in cyclin B, and increases in cyclin E and cyclin A proteins and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), whereas the expression of cdk2 remained almost unchanged in PC-3 cells exposed to RB. Moreover, RB significantly inhibited DNA synthesis with a dose-dependent reduction in the incorporation of BrdU into DNA, and enhanced apoptosis of PC-3 cells with induction of a higher ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 proteins, and activation of caspase-3 which, in turn, promoted the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). However, pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk only partially alleviated RB-triggered apoptosis in PC-3 cells, suggesting the involvement of both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. Additionally, treatment of androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells with RB led to a reduction in the expression of androgen receptor (AR), and subsequently decreased the transactivity of AR.

Methods:   Seed positions were independently determined using RUF and USD. RUF uses a radio-opaque fiducial for registration to ultrasound and 3-dimensional reconstruction of seeds relative to prostate using nonisocentric C-arm fluoroscopy. Postimplant CT was performed on Day 0. Squared differences between dosimetric measures for RUF vs. CT and USD vs. CT were calculated and mean squared differences evaluated. Paired t test was used to evaluate which method was more closely aligned with CT. Accuracies of USD and RUF compared with CT were estimated using a nonparametric approach.  Results:   Six patients were treated and compared with USD. RUF identified areas of underdosage intraoperatively in all patients and median 5 additional seeds were placed. In 40 of 42 measures, RUF was equally or more closely correlated with CT than USD.

While the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is an efficient method for selecting aptamers, it sometimes fails to obtain aptamers with high affinity and so additional improvements are required. We applied a genetic algorithm (GA) to post-SELEX screening as an in silico maturation of aptamers. First, we pre-selected DNA aptamers against prostate specific antigen (PSA) through three rounds of SELEX. To improve the PSA-binding ability of the aptamers, we carried out post-SELEX screening using GA with the pre-selected oligonucleotide sequences. For screening using GA, we replicated the oligonucleotide sequences obtained through SELEX, crossed over and mutated in silico resulting in 20 sequences. Those oligonucleotide sequences were synthesized and assayed in vitro. Then, the oligonucleotides were ranked according to PSA-binding ability and the top sequences were selected for the next cycle of GA operation. After GA operations, we identified the aptamer showing a 48-fold higher PSA-binding ability than candidates obtained by SELEX. The dissociation constant (K(D)) of the obtained aptamer was estimated to be several tens of nM. We demonstrated sensing of PSA using the obtained aptamer and succeeded in sensing PSA concentrations between 40 and 100 nM.

The purpose of this study was to investigate possibilities for the minimization of the number of needles and to investigate the consequences for the dose distribution.  Methods and materials:   A planning study for six different prostate volumes was performed. The number of needles was minimized by changing fixed 1cm interseed spacing to free interseed spacing within the needles and by increasing the seed activity. Dose-volume parameters of prostate and organs at risk (OAR) bladder, rectum, and urethra were determined. For plans with different needle and seed configurations, the sensitivity for random seed placement inaccuracies was tested. Dose distributions of realized implants based on fixed (n=21) and free interseed spacing (n=21) were compared.  Results:   The average number of needles (±1 standard deviation) could be reduced from 18.8±3.6 to 12.7±2.9 (-33%) when changing from fixed interseed spacing to free interseed spacing and subsequently to 7.3±1.0 (-42%) by increasing the seed strength from 0.57U to 1.14U. These needle reductions resulted in increased dose inhomogeneity within the prostate and increased sensitivity of dose-volume parameters of the OAR for random geometrical inaccuracies. Introduction of free interseed spacing in our clinic resulted in very satisfactory dose coverage of the prostate (D(90)=172±17Gy), while the average number of needles was reduced by 30%.  Conclusions:   Substantial reduction of the number of implantation needles is possible without compromising adequate dose coverage of the prostate. However, the chance of an unpredicted high dose to the OAR increases as fewer needles are used.""","""['Marcel J Steggerda', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Luc M F Moonen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Dose-volume impact in high-dose-rate Iridium-192 brachytherapy as a boost to external beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer--a phase II study.', 'Acute urinary retention after I-125 prostate brachytherapy in relation to dose in different regions of the prostate.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Second analysis to determine the correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Permanent implant prostate cancer brachytherapy: 2013 state-of-the art.', 'Radiation safety aspects of brachytherapy for prostate cancer using permanently implanted sources.

These were matched to nonrelapsing controls from the same era. Three copies of each CT were created and, after randomization and deletion of identifiers and original contours, were re-contoured by three radiation oncologists. Prostate contours were then divided into quadrants: Anterior-Superior (ASQ), Posterior-Superior (PSQ), Anterior-Inferior (AIQ), and Posterior-Inferior (PIQ), and dosimetric parameters calculated. Results were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression and multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   Whole prostate volume of the prostate receiving at least 100% of the prescribed dose (V(100)) and minimum dose, as a percentage of the prescribed dose, received by 90% of the prostate volume (D(90)) were similar for relapses and controls (p=0.40 and 0.48, respectively).

Materials and methods:   In this retrospective study, the MRI findings of 20 patients who had prostate cancer and were treated with EBRT were evaluated to detect tumor recurrence. The MRI findings were compared to those that had been obtained by TRUS and pathological analysis.  Results:   The sensitivity and specificity of TRUS in the detection of tumor recurrence in patients who had undergone EBRT were 53.3% and 60%, respectively. In the same group of patients, the sensitivity and specificity of T2-weighted MRI were 86% and 100%, respectively. Strikingly, the sensitivity and specificity of DCE T1-weighted MRI in the diagnosis of recurrent prostate cancer were 93% and 100%, respectively. The accuracy of the DCE T1-weighted images in the detection of recurrence was significantly higher in comparison to that obtained using T2-weighted images.  Conclusion:   During the follow-up of these patients, TRUS without the use of any other imaging or biochemical modality is not a sufficient method for the detection of prostate cancer recurrence. DCE T1-weighted MRI increases the sensitivity of MRI alone for the detection of recurrence during the follow-up of prostate cancer patients who have been treated with EBRT. Thus, DCE T1-weighted MRI must be used as part of the routine MRI analysis to check for tumor recurrence in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Taylan Kara', 'Deniz Akata', 'Fadıl Akyol', 'Muşturay Karçaaltıncaba', 'Mustafa Özmen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Diagn Interv Radiol""","""['Comparative sensitivities of functional MRI sequences in detection of local recurrence of prostate carcinoma after radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiotherapy.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for localization of recurrent prostate cancer after external beam radiotherapy.', 'Role of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of local prostate cancer recurrence after external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy.', 'Locally recurrent prostate cancer after high-dose-rate brachytherapy: the value of diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and T2-weighted imaging in localizing tumors.', 'Local staging of prostate cancer with MRI.', 'MR Imaging in Real Time Guiding of Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Detection and staging of radio-recurrent prostate cancer using multiparametric MRI.', 'A systematic review of salvage focal therapies for localised non-metastatic radiorecurrent prostate cancer.', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Diagnosis of Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Are All Pulse Sequences Helpful?', 'Accuracy of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Recently, many researchers discovered that oncogenes may be activated in some but not all samples in a given disease group. The existing statistical tools for detecting differentially expressed genes in a subset of the disease group mainly include cancer outlier profile analysis (COPA), outlier sum (OS), outlier robust t-statistic (ORT) and maximum ordered subset t-statistics (MOST). In this study, another approach named Least Sum of Ordered Subset Square t-statistic (LSOSS) is proposed. The results of our simulation studies indicated that LSOSS often has more power than previous statistical methods. When applied to real human breast and prostate cancer data sets, LSOSS was competitive in terms of the biological relevance of top ranked genes. Furthermore, a modified hierarchical clustering method was developed to classify the heterogeneous gene activation patterns of human breast cancer samples based on the significant genes detected by LSOSS. Three classes of gene activation patterns, which correspond to estrogen receptor (ER)+, ER- and a mixture of ER+ and ER-, were detected and each class was assigned a different gene signature.""","""['Yupeng Wang', 'Romdhane Rekaya']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Biomark Insights""","""['Cancer outlier differential gene expression detection.', 'MOST: detecting cancer differential gene expression.', 'A comparison of methods for data-driven cancer outlier discovery, and an application scheme to semisupervised predictive biomarker discovery.', 'Unsupervised outlier profile analysis.', 'Prognostic outlier genes for enhanced prostate cancer treatment.', 'A comprehensive survey of the approaches for pathway analysis using multi-omics data integration.', 'Detection and analysis of stable and flexible genes towards a genome signature framework in cancer.', 'DECO: decompose heterogeneous population cohorts for patient stratification and discovery of sample biomarkers using omic data profiling.', 'Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes in Kawasaki Disease Patients as Potential Biomarkers for IVIG Sensitivity by Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Identification of microRNAs as potential biomarker for gastric cancer by system biological analysis.']"""

However, several reports claim that there is no association between a higher insulin level and the risk of incident prostate cancer. In the present report, the insulin hypothesis was tested once more prospectively in men with a benign prostatic disorder. Three hundred and eighty-nine consecutive patients referred with lower urinary tract symptoms without clinical prostate cancer were included during 1994-2002. Follow-up was performed in 2006. Data were obtained from the Swedish National Cancer Register and the Regional Cancer Register, Oncological Centre, Göteborg, Sweden. At this follow-up, 44 of the patients included had developed prostate cancer. Men with prostate cancer diagnosis had a higher systolic (P<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P<0.000), were more obese as measured by BMI (P=0.010), waist (P=0.007) and hip measurements (P=0.041) than men who did not have prostate cancer diagnosis at follow-up. These men also had a higher uric acid level (P=0.040), and a higher fasting serum insulin level (P=0.023) than men who did not have prostate cancer diagnosis at follow-up. Following exclusion of T1a/b prostate cancer cases, the difference of the fasting serum insulin level between the groups was still significant (P=0.038). Our data support the hypothesis that a higher insulin level is a promoter of prostate cancer. Moreover, our data suggest that the insulin level could be used as a marker of the risk of developing prostate cancer. The present findings also seem to confirm that prostate cancer is a component of the metabolic syndrome.

Data were analyzed using constant comparison.  Results:   (1) Psychosexual problems gained importance over time, (2) men felt they were rarely invited to discuss psychosexual side effects within follow-up appointments and lack of rapport with health care professionals made it difficult to raise problems themselves, (3) problems were sometimes concealed or accepted and professionals' attempts to explore potential difficulties were resisted by some, and (4) older patients were too embarrassed to raise psychosexual concerns as they felt they would be considered 'too old' to be worried about the loss of sexual function.  Conclusion:   Men with prostate cancer, even the very elderly, have psychosexual issues for variable times after diagnosis. These are not currently always addressed at the appropriate time for the patient.

Up to now, only 21 urachal urothelial carcinomas (UCas) have been reported. Here, we describe a case of high grade UCa arising from the urachal remnants.  Case:   A 66-year-old man presented with voiding difficulties. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 5.46 ng/mL. Prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) (Gleason score 6) was diagnosed by needle biopsies. After the diagnosis of high grade, muscle invasive UCa with intact mucosa on frozen examination of the dome of bladder wall during the radical prostatectomy operation (RPO), partial cystectomy was performed. Microscopically, among the tumoral islands, cystic structures lined by cells with a benign appearance, which are considered urachal remnants, were noted. Cytokeratin 7 and high-molecular-weight cytokeratin were strongly positive, PSA and carcinoembryonic antigen were negative. Radiotherapy was given for both UCa and PCa. Six months after the diagnosis, an undifferentiated tumor was detected in a bladder transurethral resection specimen; thus, chemotherapy was given. After 1 course of chemotherapy, the patient was doing well.  Conclusion:   The origin of urachal carcinomas is usually obscured as it is a highly invasive carcinoma. The patient presented here was diagnosed incidentally during RPO. Although the stage was advanced, the tumor was detected before urachal remnants were destroyed. The treatment choice for urachal carcinomas is cystectomy.

MATERIALS AND METODS: Of the 180 patients with prostate cancer who were analyzed by Scintiscan in the last five years in our laboratory, 86 have a known PSAt value, and of these, 55 have a known Gleason Score. The 180 patients were divided into three age groups: (1) < or equal 60 years; (2) 60-70 years and (3) >70 years. The 86 patients with a known PSAt were also divided into five groups according to their PSAt value and the 55 patients with a known Gleason Score were divided in three groups. The scintigraphy results included all the patients in 3 groups, according to the presence, the absence or the likelihood of having bone metastasis. The 33 patients with proven bone metastasis were divided, according to their numbers, into the four Soloway groups.  Results:   Among the patients with PSAt >20 ng/mL, considered high risk for bone metastases, according to the Recomandations of CCAF, 21 (32.81%) of the 64 patients do not show the presence of bone metastases. For PSAt >50 ng/mL, all 5 patients <60 years of age have metastases, while only 15 (62.5%) of the 24 patients over 70 years old have metastases and 1 (4%) has low likelihood. 6 (21.42%) of the 28 patients with PSAt > sau egal 100 ng/mL do not have metastases. 10 (43.4 %) of the 23 patients with a Gleason Score <7, considered low risk, do have metastases (6 patients--26%) or low probability of metastases (4 patients--17.4%).  Conclusions:   Our study confirms that the probability of bone metastasis for a high PSAt value is reversely proportional to age.

However, data regarding patient expectations and satisfaction outcomes after RARP are scarce.  Methods:   We developed a structured program for preoperative education and evidence-based counseling using a multi-disciplinary team approach and measured its impact on patient satisfaction in a cohort of 377 consecutive patients who underwent RARP at our institution. Responses regarding overall, sexual, and continence satisfaction were assessed.  Results:   Fifty percent of our patient cohort replied to the questionnaire assessments. Ninety-three percent of responding patients expressed overall satisfaction after RARP with only 0.5% expressing regret at having had the operation. Biochemical recurrence and lack of continence correlated significantly with low levels of satisfaction, though sexual function was not significantly different among those satisfied and those not. Most patients (97%) valued oncologic outcome as their top priority, with regaining of urinary control being the commonest second priority (60%).

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have detected an association with markers on chromosome 8q24. Allele -8 of microsatellite DG8S737 with 22 repeats and allele A of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1447295 have been found to be significantly associated with prostate cancer. As GWAS are subjected to type 1 error, confirmation studies are required to validate the results. Here, we analysed the same markers in 277 cases and 282 controls from the Netherlands using a nested case-control study. Incident prostate cancer cases and controls selected were identified in the population of the Netherlands Cohort Study. We also investigated clinical features of the disease by stratifying by tumour stage. We did not replicate the association with the SNP rs1447295-A allele (P=0.10), although the effect estimate was in the same direction as previous studies (odds ratio (OR), 1.38). Interestingly a statistically significant decreased risk was observed for DG8S737 allele -8 (OR, 0.62; P=0.03). The apparent protective effect of the DG8S737 -8 allele observed in this study contrasts with the Amundadottir study. This suggests that DG8S737 and rs1447295 might be tightly linked markers flanking the actual causative variant and that there may be potentially more than one high-risk haplotype present in the Caucasian population.

Microvessel density and vascular lumen diameter in the prostate xenografts decreased rapidly after AD, reached a nadir on days 2-4, and recovered between days 4 and 14. The number of apoptotic endothelial cells peaked on day 2 after AD and decreased to precastration levels over days 4-7. Leakage of vascular contents in the interstitial space was apparent between days 1 and 3 after AD; however, the vascular permeability barrier reestablished between days 7 and 14. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF receptor-2, and basic fibroblast growth factor protein increased in endothelial cells between days 2 and 4 after AD, which preceded vascular recovery and appeared to be a direct and specific response of the endothelial cells to AD. Lack of comparable upregulation of these genes in primary cultures of human prostate endothelial cells in response to AD suggests a role for paracrine signaling mediated through stromal or epithelial cells.

To globally profile the genes silenced by hypermethylation in prostate cancer, we screened a whole genome expression microarray for genes reactivated in the LNCaP, DU-145, PC-3, and MDA2b prostate tumor cell lines after treatment with the demethylating drug 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and the histone deacetylation-inhibiting drug trichostatin A. A total of 2,997 genes showed at least 2-fold upregulation of expression after drug treatment in at least one prostate tumor cell line. For validation, we examined the first 45 genes, ranked by upregulation of expression, which had a typical CpG island and were known to be expressed in the normal cell counterpart. Two important findings were, first, that several genes known to be frequently hypermethylated in prostate cancer were apparent, and, second, that validation studies revealed eight novel genes hypermethylated in the prostate tumor cell lines, four of which were unmethylated in normal prostate cells and hypermethylated in primary prostate tumors (SLC15A3, 66%; KRT7, 54%; TACSTD2, 17%; GADD45b, 3%). Thus, we established the utility of our screen for genes hypermethylated in prostate cancer cells. One of the novel genes was TACSTD2/TROP2, a marker of human prostate basal cells with stem cell characteristics. TACSTD2 was unmethylated in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and may have utility in emerging methylation-based prostate cancer tests.

We examined the influence of the PCPT on finasteride prescribing within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  Methods:   We assessed trends on monthly new and total prescriptions for finasteride filled within the VHA from January 2000 to December 2005. Additionally, all VHA urologists and a random sample of VHA primary care physicians (PCP) were surveyed about their use of finasteride.  Results:   The number of men starting finasteride grew over the study period. Publication of the PCPT was not significantly associated with any change in this pattern (P = 0.45). Fifty-seven percent of urologists and 40% of PCPs endorsed prescribing finasteride more frequently in 2006 than 5 years prior. However, among those who reported changing prescribing patterns, fewer than 2% reported being influenced by the PCPT. Sixty-four percent of urologists and 80% of PCPs never prescribe finasteride for prostate cancer chemoprevention; 55% of urologists cited concerns of inducing high-grade tumors, whereas 52% of PCPs did not know it could be used for chemoprevention.  Conclusions:   The number of men starting finasteride in the VHA increased over time, but the change did not seem to be due to increased use of finasteride for chemoprevention.

CAF-induced EMT leads prostate carcinoma cells to enhance expression of stem cell markers, as well as the ability to form prostaspheres and to self-renew. Hence, the paracrine interplay between CAFs and cancer cells leads to an EMT-driven gain of cancer stem cell properties associated with aggressiveness and metastatic spread.""","""['Elisa Giannoni', 'Francesca Bianchini', 'Lorenzo Masieri', 'Sergio Serni', 'Eugenio Torre', 'Lido Calorini', 'Paola Chiarugi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Tumour-stroma interactions between metastatic prostate cancer cells and fibroblasts.', 'Differential influence of normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts on the growth of human epithelial cells in an in vitro cocultivation model of prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer progression.', 'Prostate cancer metastasis: role of the host microenvironment in promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition and increased bone and adrenal gland metastasis.', 'Tumour-stroma interaction: cancer-associated fibroblasts as novel targets in anti-cancer therapy?', 'Exploring the Onset and Progression of Prostate Cancer through a Multicellular Agent-based Model.', 'The role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer metastasis.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Translational assessment of a DATA-functionalized FAP inhibitor with facile 68Ga-labeling at room temperature.', 'Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Markers in Prostate Cancer: From Bench to Bedside.']"""

Tomato lycopene has been suggested to have beneficial effects against certain types of cancer, including that of prostate, although the exact molecular mechanism(s) is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that lycopene may exert its antitumor effects through changes in mevalonate pathway and in Ras activation. Incubation of the Ras-activated prostatic carcinoma LNCaP cells with a 24 h lycopene treatment (2.5-10 μM) dose dependently reduced intracellular total cholesterol by decreasing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase expression and by inactivating Ras, as evidenced by its translocation from cell membranes to cytosol. Concomitantly, lycopene reduced the Ras-dependent activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). Such a reduction was parallel to an inhibition of reactive oxygen species production and to a decrease in the phosphorylation ofc-jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38. These effects were also accompanied by an arrest of cell cycle progression and by apoptosis induction, as evidenced by a decrease in cyclin D1 and phospho-AKT levels and by an increase in p21, p27 and p53 levels and in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio. The addition of mevalonate prevented the growth-inhibitory effects of lycopene as well as its increase in Ras cytoplasmatic accumulation and the subsequent changes in NF-κB. The ability of lycopene in inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase expression and cell growth and in inactivating Ras was also found in prostate PC-3, colon HCT-116 and HT-29 and lung BEN cancer cells. These findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the growth-inhibitory effects of lycopene in cancer.""","""['Paola Palozza', 'Maria Colangelo', 'Rossella Simone', 'Assunta Catalano', 'Alma Boninsegna', 'Paola Lanza', 'Giovanni Monego', 'Franco O Ranelletti']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Novel signaling molecules implicated in tumor-associated fatty acid synthase-dependent breast cancer cell proliferation and survival: Role of exogenous dietary fatty acids, p53-p21WAF1/CIP1, ERK1/2 MAPK, p27KIP1, BRCA1, and NF-kappaB.', 'Diosgenin, a naturally occurring steroid corrected saponin suppresses 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase expression and induces apoptosis in HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells.', 'Activation of the cholesterol pathway and Ras maturation in response to stress.', 'Studies of the isoprenoid-mediated inhibition of mevalonate synthesis applied to cancer chemotherapy and chemoprevention.', 'Novel aspects of mevalonate pathway inhibitors as antitumor agents.', 'Recent advance of herbal medicines in cancer- a molecular approach.', 'Emerging Role of Plant-Based Dietary Components in Post-Translational Modifications Associated with Colorectal Cancer.', 'Chronic Inflammation in Non-Healing Skin Wounds and Promising Natural Bioactive Compounds Treatment.', 'Lycopene: A Natural Arsenal in the War against Oxidative Stress and Cardiovascular Diseases.', 'T63 induces apoptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells through mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.']"""

Identification of alternative pathways promoting prostate tumor growth is thus needed. Stat5 has been recently shown to promote human prostate cancer cell survival/proliferation and to be associated with early prostate cancer recurrence. Stat5 is the main signaling pathway triggered by prolactin (PRL), a growth factor whose local production is also increased in high-grade prostate cancers. The first aim of this study was to use prostate-specific PRL transgenic mice to address the mechanisms by which local PRL induces prostate tumorogenesis. We report that (i) Stat5 is the major signaling cascade triggered by local PRL in the mouse dorsal prostate, (ii) this model recapitulates prostate tumorogenesis from precancer lesions to invasive carcinoma, and (iii) tumorogenesis involves dramatic accumulation and abnormal spreading of p63-positive basal cells, and of stem cell antigen-1-positive cells identified as a stem/progenitor-like subpopulation. Because basal epithelial stem cells are proposed to serve as tumor-initiating cells, we challenged the relevance of local PRL as a previously unexplored therapeutic target. Using a double-transgenic approach, we show that Delta1-9-G129R-hPRL, a competitive PRL-receptor antagonist, prevented early stages of prostate tumorogenesis by reducing or inhibiting Stat5 activation, cell proliferation, abnormal basal-cell pattern, and frequency or grade of intraepithelial neoplasia.

This receptor mediates homing of tumor cells to specific organs that express the ligand CXCL12 for this receptor and plays an important role in tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Thus, a priori, agents that can downregulate CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling cascade have potential against cancer metastasis. In this study, we report the identification of butein (3, 4, 2', 4'-tetrahydroxychalcone) as a novel regulator of CXCR4 expression and function. We found that butein downregulated the expression of CXCR4 in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The decrease in CXCR4 expression induced by butein was not cell type-specific as the inhibition also occurred in pancreatic, prostate, multiple myeloma, head and neck, and hepatocellular cancer cell lines. When investigated for the molecular mechanism(s), it was found that the downregulation of CXCR4 was not due to proteolytic degradation but rather to transcriptional regulation as indicated by downregulation of mRNA expression, inhibition of NF-κB activation evident by both DNA binding, and reporter assays, and suppression of chromatin immunoprecipitation activity. Suppression of CXCR4 expression by butein correlated with the inhibition of CXCL12-induced migration and invasion of both breast and pancreatic cancer cells.

Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family that is expressed in the majority of human tumors including prostate cancer, but is barely detectable in terminally differentiated normal cells. Downregulation of survivin could sensitize prostate cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo. Selenium is an essential trace element. Several studies have shown that selenium compounds inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. The objective of this study is to investigate whether survivin gene silencing in conjunction with selenium treatment could enhance the therapeutic efficacy for prostate cancer and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.  Methods:   Expression of survivin was analyzed in a collection of normal and malignant prostatic tissues by immunohistochemical staining. In vitro studies were conducted in PC-3M, C4-2B, and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. The effect of selenium on survivin expression was analyzed by Western blotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Survivin gene knockdown was carried out by transfecting cells with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed against survivin. Cell proliferation was quantitated by the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay and apoptosis by propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. Finally, in vivo tumor growth assay was performed by establishing PC-3M xenograft in nude mice and monitoring tumor growth following transfection and treatment.  Results:   We found that survivin was undetectable in normal prostatic tissues but was highly expressed in prostate cancers. Survivin knockdown or selenium treatment inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells, but the selenium effect was modest. In contrast to what have been observed in other cell lines, selenium treatment had little or no effect on survivin expression in several androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines. Survivin knockdown sensitized these cells to selenium growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. In nude mice bearing PC-3M xenografts, survivin knockdown synergizes with selenium in inhibiting tumor growth.  Conclusions:   Selenium could inhibit the growth of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, but the effects were modest. The growth inhibition was not mediated by downregulating survivin expression. Survivin silencing greatly enhanced the growth inhibitory effects of selenium.""","""['Xichun Liu', 'Ruijuan Gao', 'Yan Dong', 'Lifang Gao', 'Yanying Zhao', 'Lijuan Zhao', 'Xuejian Zhao', 'Haitao Zhang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Monomethylated selenium inhibits growth of LNCaP human prostate cancer xenograft accompanied by a decrease in the expression of androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).', 'Apoptotic effect of tolfenamic acid in androgen receptor-independent prostate cancer cell and xenograft tumor through specificity protein 1.', 'Hydroxycamptothecin induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth in colon cancer by the downregulation of survivin and XIAP expression.', 'Monitoring survivin expression in cancer: implications for prognosis and therapy.', 'Impacting tumor cell-fate by targeting the inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin.', 'STAT3 as a target for sensitizing prostate cancer cells to irradiation.', 'Triptolide inhibits benign prostatic epithelium viability and migration and induces apoptosis via upregulation of microRNA-218.', 'Targeted nanoconjugate co-delivering siRNA and tyrosine kinase inhibitor to KRAS mutant NSCLC dissociates GAB1-SHP2 post oncogene knockdown.', 'Oncoapoptotic markers in oral cancer: prognostics and therapeutic perspective.', 'Small interfering RNA survivin and GRIM-19 co-expression salmonella plasmid inhibited the growth of laryngeal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.']"""

Design:   Retrospective cohort study.

Main measures:   We assessed follow-up care including additional PSA testing, urology consults, and biopsies. We compared stage at diagnosis for men who were biopsied within 24 months vs. those men biopsied and diagnosed>24 months after the elevated PSA test.  Key results:   Two-thirds of patients received follow-up evaluation within 24 months of the elevated PSA test: 32.8% of men underwent a biopsy, 15.5% attended a urology visit but were not biopsied, and 18.8% had a subsequent normal PSA test. Younger age, higher PSA levels, more prior PSA tests, no co-payment requirements, existing urologic conditions, low body mass index, and low comorbidity scores were associated with more complete follow-up. Among men who underwent radical prostatectomy, a delayed diagnosis was not significantly associated with having a pathologically advanced-stage cancer (T3/T4), although we found an increased likelihood of presenting with stage T2C relative to stage T2A or T2B cancer.

Methods:   This retrospective study was based on 305 consecutive patients submitted to RP. In whole-mount and totally embedded surgical specimens, tumor extent was evaluated with a point-count semi-quantitative method and correlated to several clinical and pathological variables. Biochemical progression was defined as PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml; time to progression-free outcome was studied using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit analysis and univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox stepwise logistic regression.  Results:   More extensive tumors showed significantly higher preoperative PSA (P < 0.01), higher clinical stage (P = 0.03), higher positive surgical margins (P < 0.01), higher pathological stage (P < 0.01), and higher Gleason score on needle biopsies (P < 0.01) and on surgical specimens (P < 0.01).

Therefore, we set out to examine the relationship between polymorphisms in these genes, obesity and prostate cancer in study of African-American men. Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOQ and ADIPOR1 were genotyped in DNA samples from 131 African-American prostate cancer cases and 344 controls participating in the Flint Men's Health Study. Logistic regression was then used to estimate their association with prostate cancer and obesity. While no significant associations were detected between any of the tested SNPs and prostate cancer, the rs1501299 SNP in ADIPOQ was significantly associated with body mass (P=0.03). Genetic variation in ADIPOQ and ADIPOR1 did not predict risk of prostate cancer in this study of African-American men. However, the rs1501299 SNP in ADIPOQ was associated with obesity.

Methods:   This comparative retrospective cohort study included 101 tamsulosin-treated eyes and 404 non-tamsulosin-treated eyes from January 1, 1998, to August 31, 2008. Main outcome measures were major and minor complication rates and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity. Complication rates were compared between August 11, 1999, to December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2006, to September 3, 2008, for both tamsulosin-treated and non-tamsulosin-treated eyes.  Results:   The major complication rates were 3.0% for tamsulosin-treated eyes and 8.9% for non-tamsulosin-treated eyes (P = .08), while the minor complication rates were 24.8% and 12.1%, respectively (P = .002). Both groups had an equal likelihood of attaining better than 20/40 postoperative visual acuities (82.2% vs 82.9%, respectively; P = .85).

The impact of BCR on subsequent mortality is uncertain, however, especially given competing causes of death.  Methods:   To describe patterns of BCR and subsequent mortality, we conducted an observational study in a community-based, ""high-comorbidity"" setting of 623 US veterans diagnosed as having prostate cancer from 1991 to 1995 and receiving radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. The main outcome measures were BCR, defined as a PSA level of 0.4 ng/mL or higher (treated with surgery) or ""PSA nadir+2 ng/mL"" (treated with radiation therapy), and prostate cancer mortality, determined through 2006.  Results:   With 5-, 10-, and 15-year follow-up periods, respectively (for all results shown herein), the cumulative incidence of BCR after prostatectomy (n=225) was 34%, 37%, and 37%; prostate cancer mortality among men who failed treatment (n=81) was 3%, 11%, and 21%. Among men receiving radiation therapy (n=398), the cumulative incidence of BCR was 35%, 46%, and 48%; prostate cancer mortality among those who failed treatment (n=161) was 11%, 20%, and 42%. Overall, BCR was associated with an increased risk of death from prostate cancer in the study population, but the individual probability of this outcome was relatively low.  Conclusions:   Biochemical recurrence is associated with increased prostate cancer mortality, yet when BCR occurs only a minority of men subsequently die of their disease. The phrase ""most men die with prostate cancer, not of it"" applies to elderly veterans, even after failure of primary treatment.

Therefore, we wished to determine the association between SNPs at MSMB, the gene encoding beta-MSP, and the levels of prostate-produced biomarkers beta-MSP, PSA, and human kallikrein 2 (hK2) in blood and semen.  Methods:   Blood and semen from 304 healthy young Swedish men (ages 18-21) were assayed for beta-MSP, PSA, and hK2. SNPs around MSMB were genotyped from matched DNA and analyzed for quantitative association with biomarker levels. Empirical P values were multiple test-corrected and the independence of each SNP's effect was determined.  Results:   rs10993994 was significantly associated with the blood and semen levels of beta-MSP (both P < 1.0 x 10(-7)) and PSA (P = 0.00014 and P = 0.0019), and semen levels of hK2 (P = 0.00027). Additional copies of the prostate cancer risk allele resulted in lower beta-MSP but higher PSA levels, and singly explained 23% and 5% of the variation seen in semen beta-MSP and PSA, respectively. Additional SNPs at MSMB are associated with beta-MSP and PSA independently of rs10993994.  Conclusions:   SNPs at MSMB correlate with physiologic variation in beta-MSP and PSA levels in the blood and semen of healthy young Swedish men. In particular, rs10993994 has a strong effect on beta-MSP levels.

Butein in vitro resulted in a moderate inhibition of cell proliferation and viability through G(2)/M phase arrest. We also analyzed the effect of butein on the activities of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-regulated MMP-9 and VEGF since they are prominently involved in the processes of tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Our results in vitro showed that butein attenuates VEGF and MMP-9 activities via the suppression of NF-κB activity. Furthermore, butein repressed the expression of VEGF and MMP-9 induced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate.

Material and methods:   Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies were performed on 233 patients at a single tertiary academic center. Patients were prospectively randomized to the two protocols (12 or 18 core). The cancer detection rates achieved using these two methods were analyzed at different PSA levels, PVs and PSADs.  Results:   Considering PSA level and PV simultaneously, patients were stratified into four groups (group A: PSA < 7 ng/ml and PV ≥ 45 cm(3); group B: PSA < 7 ng/ml and PV < 45 cm(3); group C: PSA ≥ 7 ng/ml and PV ≥ 45 cm(3); group D: PSA ≥ 7 ng/ml and PV < 45 cm(3)). 18-core biopsy had a higher cancer detection rate than 12-core biopsy only in group C (55.2% vs 24.1%, p = 0.015). The 233 patients were also stratified into three groups according to PSAD level: the low PSAD group (PSAD < 0.15 ng/ml/cm(3)), the intermediate PSAD group (0.15 ng/ml/cm(3) ≤ PSAD < 0.25 ng/ml/cm(3)) and the high PSAD group (PSAD ≥ 0.25 ng/ml/cm(3)). In the intermediate PSAD group, 18-core biopsy had a higher cancer detection rate than 12-core biopsy (54.2% vs 28.9%, p = 0.048).

For example, alterations in both survivin and p53 are reported to have crucial roles in prostate cancer progression. However, little is known regarding the interrelationships between p53 and survivin in prostate cancer. Our data demonstrate that the expression of survivin is inversely correlated with that of wtp53 protein (r(s)=0.548) in prostate cancer and in normal prostate tissues. We have developed a therapeutic strategy, in which two antitumor factors, small interfering RNA-survivin and p53 protein, are co-expressed from the same plasmid, and have examined their effects on the growth of PC3, an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line. When p53 was expressed along with a survivin-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA), tumor cell proliferation was significantly suppressed and apoptosis occurred. In addition, this combination also abrogated the expression of downstream target molecules such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and c-Myc, while enhancing the expression of GRIM19. These changes in gene expression occurred distinctly in the presence of survivin-shRNA/wtp53 compared with control or single treatment groups. Intratumoral injection of the co-expressed construct inhibited the growth and survival of tumor xenografts in a nude mouse model.

To make such behavioural changes, people need to have a correct assessment of their own risk, which is often underestimated or overestimated. These risk estimates depend, among others, on the calculation method that is used. Currently, the method that is used most often is 'indirect cumulative risk' (ICR). We discuss several drawbacks of using ICR in individual counselling and therefore use an alternative method. In this alternative (life table method) we calculated 10-year risks for a whole range of cancers as a function of the current age and risk profile, while taking into account other causes of death. These estimates can easily be used to give an individualized assessment of the risk of cancer. Regardless of the risk estimation method used, the risk needs to be broken down for 'risk factors'. If only the risk for an average person of the population is given, this means a small overestimation for the non-risk group, but a significant underestimation for the at-risk group. When we compare the life table risk as a function of risk factors to the more commonly used ICR, large differences are found, especially in prostate, breast and lung carcinomas. The life table method, although it has certain limitations, has advantages over the ICR method for individual counselling. To our knowledge this is the first overview in which 10-year risks as a function of the current risk profile are given for multiple cancers. The calculated risks are primarily intended to better inform people who are considering preventive measures. For example, for a 40-year-old woman without familial risk who is considering the pros and cons of breast cancer mammographic screening, it is more interesting to know that she has a 0.7% chance of getting breast cancer in the next 5 years, rather than being told that 11% of women get breast cancer during their lives (ICR 0-74). Current smokers can now be given absolute risk reduction estimates of smoking cessation. To keep the life table risk estimates up to date, they must be repeated every couple of years, using up-to-date incidence and mortality data.""","""['M C M Goossens', 'Jacques De Grève']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Prophylactic Oophorectomy: Reducing the U.S. Death Rate from Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.

This study examines disease severity among patients ages 18 to 99 from the National Cancer Database (NCDB).  Methods:   Patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2006 with prostate cancer were selected from the NCDB (n = 312,339). We evaluated the association among three disease severity measures: prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score 8 to 10, and clinical T-stage 3/4, by race/ethnicity and insurance while adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors.  Results:   Uninsured and Medicaid-insured patients had elevated PSA levels, higher odds of advanced Gleason score [uninsured odds ratio (OR), 1.97; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.82-2.12; Medicaid OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.55-1.79], and advanced clinical T stage (uninsured OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.69-2.03; Medicaid OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.35-1.63) compared with privately insured patients.

Conclusion:   Insurance status is strongly associated with disease severity among prostate cancer patients.  Impact:   Strong associations between insurance and disease severity may be related to lack of access to preventive services such as PSA screening and barriers to medical evaluation.

Zn homeostasis is therefore dynamically maintained by a variety of transporters and other proteins distributed in distinct cellular and subcellular compartments. Zn transport is mediated by two major protein families: the Zip family, which mediates Zn influx, and the ZnTs which are primarily linked to Zn sequestration into intracellular compartments and are, thereby, involved in lowering cytoplasmic Zn free ion concentrations. In the prostate epithelial cell, the accumulation of high cellular zinc is a specialized function that is necessary for these cells to carry out the major physiological functions of production and secretion of prostatic fluids. The loss of Zn accumulation is the most consistent and persistent characteristic of prostate malignancy. Currently, there are no direct methods to determine the relative Zn levels in various cell types of prostate gland (i.e. stroma, glandular epithelia, acini, and muscular) and no reliable ways to compare the Zn in normal versus malignant areas of the gland. Here we report a new method to show a differential Zn staining method that correlates with various stages of prostate cancer development in situ and expression of a human Zn transporter1-hZIP1 -in situ by in situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction hybridization (ISRTPCR) that correlate with the relative Zn levels determined by the differential Zn staining method. By utilizing these methods, we show for the first time that: (1) the relative Zn levels are very low to absent in the malignant glands, (2) normal glands show high Zn levels in both glandular epithelia as well as in stromal tissues, (3) the Zn levels begin to decrease in pre-malignant glands and precedes the development of malignancy, and (4) the expression of human Zn transporter1 (hZIP1) appears to correlate with the Zn levels in the prostate glands and may be the major Zn regulator in this organ.""","""['Leslie A Johnson', 'Mazhar A Kanak', ""Andre' Kajdacsy-Balla"", 'Joseph P Pestaner', 'Omar Bagasra']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Methods""","""['hZIP1 zinc uptake transporter down regulation and zinc depletion in prostate cancer.', 'hZip2 and hZip3 zinc transporters are down regulated in human prostate adenocarcinomatous glands.', 'hZIP1 zinc transporter down-regulation in prostate cancer involves the overexpression of ras responsive element binding protein-1 (RREB-1).', 'Zinc and zinc transporters in normal prostate and the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.', 'Zinc Transporters and the Progression of Breast Cancers.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'Zinc in Prostate Health and Disease: A Mini Review.', 'Carbon sources and pathways for citrate secreted by human prostate cancer cells determined by NMR tracing and metabolic modeling.', 'Metabolic reprogramming in prostate cancer.', 'Growth Modulatory Role of Zinc in Prostate Cancer and Application to Cancer Therapeutics.']"""

Methods:   Men are recruited to this study if their treatment plan is to receive ADT for at least 6 months. Men who are randomised to the intervention arm receive a home-based tailored intervention to meet the following guidelines a) > or = 5 servings vegetables and fruits/day; b) 30%-35% of total energy from fat, and < 10% energy from saturated fat/day; c) 10% of energy from polyunsaturated fat/day; d) limited consumption of processed meats; e) 25-35 gm of fibre/day; f) alcoholic drinks < or = 28 units/week; g) limited intake of foods high in salt and/or sugar. They are also encouraged to include at least 30 minutes of brisk walking, 5 or more days per week. The primary outcomes are change in body composition, fatigue and quality of life scores. Secondary outcomes include dietary intake, physical activity and perceived stress. Baseline information collected includes: socio-economic status, treatment duration, perceived social support and health status, family history of cancer, co-morbidities, medication and supplement use, barriers to change, and readiness to change their health behaviour. Data for the primary and secondary outcomes will be collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months from 47 intervention and 47 control patients.  Discussion:   The results of this study will provide detailed information on diet and physical activity levels in prostate cancer patients treated with ADT and will test the feasibility and efficacy of a diet and physical activity intervention which could provide essential information to develop guidelines for prostate cancer patients to minimise the side effects related to ADT.

In the present study, eight-armed polyethylene glycol (EAP) and low molecular weight (LMW) polyethylenimine (PEI) were used as basic units to construct the architecture of a new star-shaped EAP-PEI copolymer (EAPP). MC11, a peptide capable of selectively binding fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) on tumor cell membranes, was further conjugated to EAPP to produce the vector EAPP-MC11 (EAPPM) to enhance tumor targetability. This tumor-targeting vector EAPPM was observed to retard the plasmids mobility at a nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) ratio of 3. The vector could efficiently condense plasmids within 300 nm nanoparticles with a positive zeta potential at the N/P ratio of 20 or above. While the cytotoxicity of EAPPM polyplexes was similar to that of LMW PEI, it was significantly lower than that of PEI (25 kDa) in HepG2 and PC3 cell lines. In vitro gene transfection with pDNA mediated by EAPPM showed that the transfection efficiency increased 15 times in HepG2 cells but remained at a similar level in PC3 cells in comparison with that of EAPP. By systemic injection of EAPPM/pDNA complexes into a HepG2-bearing mice model, luciferase expression detected in lung, liver, and tumor tissues demonstrated EAPPM could deliver in a targeted manner a reporter gene into tumor tissues, where the luciferase expression of EAPPM was 4 times higher than that of EAPP and even 23 times higher than that of PEI (25 kDa).

Pancreatic-type ribonucleases are an especially attractive target, as their natural dimers can enter mammalian cells, evade the cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), and exert their toxic ribonucleolytic activity. Here, we report on the use of eight distinct thiol-reactive cross-linking reagents to produce dimeric and trimeric conjugates of four pancreatic-type ribonucleases. Both the site of conjugation and, to a lesser extent, the propinquity of the monomers within the conjugate modulate affinity for RI, and hence cytotoxicity. Still, the cytotoxicity of the multimers is confounded in vitro by their increased hydrodynamic radius, which attenuates cytosolic entry. A monomeric RI-evasive variant of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A) inhibits the growth of human prostate and lung tumors in mice. An RI-evasive trimeric conjugate inhibits tumor growth at a lower dose and with less frequent administration than does the monomer. This effect is attributable to an enhanced persistence of the trimers in circulation. On a molecular basis, the trimer is ∼300-fold more efficacious and as well tolerated as erlotinib, which is in clinical use for the treatment of lung cancer.

Although both primary breast and prostate cancer are manageable by ""classical"" therapies such as surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, when metastases (secondary cancers) disseminate to the bones these diseases are, by and large, incurable. Metastasis to the bone is implicated in around 70% of prostate and breast cancer deaths. The idea of harnessing the immune system to fight disseminated cancer has proven to be effective in experimental animal models against transplanted tumors. Here, both arms of the immune system, namely, the humoral one characterized by anti-tumor antibodies and the cellular one composed of a type of white blood cell, specifically the cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), were found to cause tumor rejection either following immunization of the experimental mice before the tumor inoculations (active-vaccination) or after adoptive transfer of cancer-specific antibodies or CTLs into tumor-bearing mice (passive-vaccination). Encouraged by these results, scientists and clinicians have joined forces in extensive efforts to apply both active and passive vaccination for the immunotherapy of cancer patients.

As an example, human prostate carcinoma-associated fibroblasts can promote tumorigenic transformation in initiated human prostate epithelial cells. Appreciation of the importance of the stromal response has led to the development of novel anti-cancer therapeutic agents targeted to frustrate stromal response factors, which support progressive tumor growth. Targets for investigation have included proteases, heparanase and other enzymes expressed by cancer cells or by adjacent stromal cells, which degrade extracellular matrix components and facilitate the release of cytokines and growth factors which stimulate angiogenesis, or support the growth and invasion of cancer cells.

In this way, molecular alterations of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), one of the most important inhibitory molecule of inflammatory signal transduction circuitries, could contribute to explain the pleiotropic role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in this type of cancer.  Methods:   We analyzed the methylation status and mRNA expression of SOCS3 in 20 benign prostate hyperplasias (BPH) and in 51 prostate cancer specimens. We analyzed the SOCS3 methylation status using methylation-specific PCR. Hypermethylation was confirmed by sequencing after subcloning. Epigenetic silencing of this gene was also demonstrated by real-time PCR and by immunohistochemistry. Results and correlation with clinical data were statistically analyzed.  Results:   We found that the promoter of SOCS3 was methylated in 39.2% of prostate cancer. On the contrary, all BPH and normal controls had an unmethylated pattern. Real-time analysis showed that in methylated cases SOCS3 mRNA expression was reduced by three and four folds as compared to BPH and unmethylated cases, respectively. Interestingly, SOCS3 mRNA level was higher in unmethylated prostate cancer than in BPH. The immunohistochemical staining analysis for SOCS 3 confirmed mRNA results. Moreover, methylation of SOCS3 promoter significantly associated with intermediate-high grade Gleason score (P = 0.0007) and with an unfavorable clinical outcome (P = 0.0019).

The 18 kDa propeptide domain of lysyl oxidase (LOX-PP) released from the secreted precursor protein (Pro-LOX) has been shown to inhibit RAS signaling and the transformed phenotype of breast, pancreatic, lung, and prostate cancer cells in culture, and formation of tumors by Her-2/neu-driven breast cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model. Here, we tested the effects of LOX-PP on MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells, driven by mutant RAS. In MIA PaCa-2 cells in culture, LOX-PP attenuated the ERK and AKT activities and decreased the levels of the NF-κB p65 and RelB subunits and cyclin D1, which are activated by RAS signaling. In mouse xenograft growth, LOX-PP reduced growth of tumors by these pancreatic cancer cells, and the nuclear levels of the p65 NF-κB subunit and cyclin D1 proteins. While biological agents attenuate tumor growth when used alone, often they have additive or synergistic effects when used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, we next tested the hypotheses that LOX-PP sensitizes pancreatic and breast cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Purified LOX-PP enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in pancreatic and breast cancer cells, as judged by ATP production, Cell Death ELISA assays, caspase 3 activation, PARP cleavage, and Annexin V staining. Thus, LOX-PP potentiates the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin on breast and pancreatic cancer cells, warranting additional studies with a broader spectrum of current cancer treatment modalities.""","""['Chengyin Min', 'Yingshe Zhao', 'Mathilde Romagnoli', 'Philip C Trackman', 'Gail E Sonenshein', 'Kathrin H Kirsch']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['The tumor suppressor activity of the lysyl oxidase propeptide reverses the invasive phenotype of Her-2/neu-driven breast cancer.', 'Repression of BCL2 by the tumor suppressor activity of the lysyl oxidase propeptide inhibits transformed phenotype of lung and pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Lysyl oxidase propeptide inhibits prostate cancer cell growth by mechanisms that target FGF-2-cell binding and signaling.', 'The lysyl oxidase pro-peptide attenuates fibronectin-mediated activation of focal adhesion kinase and p130Cas in breast cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of CIN85-mediated invasion by a novel SH3 domain binding motif in the lysyl oxidase propeptide.', 'Context Matters: Response Heterogeneity to Collagen-Targeting Approaches in Desmoplastic Cancers.', 'Targeting Lysyl Oxidase Family Meditated Matrix Cross-Linking as an Anti-Stromal Therapy in Solid Tumours.', 'Effects of High Glucose-Induced Lysyl Oxidase Propeptide on Retinal Endothelial Cell Survival: Implications for Diabetic Retinopathy.', 'Decreased lysyl oxidase level protects against development of retinal vascular lesions in diabetic retinopathy.', 'Inhibition of angiogenesis in endothelial cells by Human Lysyl oxidase propeptide.']"""

Immunohistochemistry was used to detect MTA1 on tissue microarrays (TMA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD31, and Ki67 in xenografts. We used retroviral or lentiviral RNAi transduction of PCa cells to establish MTA1 knockdowns. RT-PCR, Western blot, invasion, and endothelial cell migration assays were used to characterize the cells in vitro. The role of MTA1 in PCa tumorigenesis was evaluated in mouse xenografts.  Results:   We identified MTA1 as a component of bone metastasis signature in PCa, which suggested a possible role for MTA1 in PCa progression and metastasis. MTA1 was expressed at higher levels in PCa cell lines than in normal prostate epithelial cells. Silencing MTA1 significantly suppressed the invasion and angiogenic activity of the cells in vitro and delayed tumor formation and development in mouse xenografts. Tumors that express MTA1 had higher proliferative indices, secreted higher levels of VEGF and were more vascularized. Analysis of the human TMA showed positive correlation between MTA1 nuclear localization/staining intensity and PCa aggressiveness.

African American men have substantially increased risk of both being diagnosed and dying from the disease.

Recent epidemiological studies suggest that statins reduce serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and decrease the risk of prostate cancer. In the present study, we determined the molecular mechanisms related to the regulation of PSA, androgen receptor (AR) and cell proliferation in prostate cancer cell lines by statins.  Methods:   Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, cytotoxicity analysis and a cell proliferation assay were used to resolve the regulatory role of statins (mevastatin and simvastatin) in three prostate cancer cell lines, RWPE-1, 22Rv1, and LNCaP.  Results:   Western blotting revealed that both mevastatin and simvastatin downregulated AR and PSA protein. However, these statins did not downregulate AR mRNA expression, while they decreased PSA mRNA. The protease inhibitor MG132 inhibited the downregulation of AR protein which suggested that statins decreased AR protein levels by increasing AR proteolysis. Furthermore, statins reduced cell proliferation in AR positive cells but not in AR negative cells, suggesting that statins regulate cell proliferation via AR expression. In addition, cell proliferation assay at various concentrations of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) showed that statins decreased androgen sensitivity in LNCaP cells.

Methods:   Monocyte-derived DCs from PCa patients were matured using the ""standard"" cytokine cocktail (IL-1β/TNFα/IL-6/PGE₂) or using the αDC1-polarizing cocktail (IL-1β/TNFα/IFNα/IFNγ/poly-I:C), loaded with UV-irradiated LNCaP cells, and used to sensitize autologous CD8(+) T cells.  Results:   αDC1s from PCa patients secreted 10-30 times higher levels of IL-12p70 than sDCs. Importantly this elevated capacity for IL-12p70 secretion was not inhibited by loading with apoptotic tumor cells. Compared to standard DCs, αDC1s induced higher numbers of CD8(+) T cells capable of recognizing both the original PCa cells as well as another PCa cell line, DU145, in MHC class I-restricted fashion. Furthermore, αDC1s induced higher numbers of CD8(+) T cells recognizing defined PCa-specific class I-restricted peptide epitopes of prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase: PAP(135-143) (average 49-fold higher), PAP(112-120) (average 24-fold), PSA(141-150) (average 5.5-fold), and PSA(146-154) (average 11-fold).

Methods:   ShRNA was used to knockdown WASF3 function in prostate cell lines.

Results:   Increased levels of expression were seen in high-grade human prostate cancer and in the PC3 and DU145 cell lines. Inactivation of WASF3 using shRNAs reduced cell motility and invasion in these cells and reduced anchorage independent growth in vitro. The loss of motility was accompanied by an associated increase in stress fiber formation and focal adhesions. When injected subcutaneously into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, tumor formation was significantly reduced for PC3 and DU145 cells with WASF3 knockdown and in vivo metastasis assays using tail vain injection showed a significant reduction for PC3 and DU145 cells.

Initial results of the Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study""","""Background:   Cancer incidence is increasing in the United Kingdom, as well as on a global basis. Biochemical parameters, such as C-reactive protein and albumin (combined to form the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score, mGPS), alkaline phosphatase (Alk phos), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and serum calcium have been reported to be associated with cancer and non-cancer mortality. Therefore, to definitively examine the interrelationships between the above biochemical parameters, the mGPS and the presence of cancer, the Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study was undertaken. The aim of this initial study was to examine the effect of cancer on markers of systemic inflammation induced by the liver (mGPS) and on levels of routine biochemical parameters.  Methods:   Patients (n=223 303) who had a single incidental sample taken for C-reactive protein, albumin, calcium and serum liver function tests where available, between 2000 and 2008 were studied. Those with a pathological diagnosis of cancer (n=22 715) were identified. The mGPS was constructed and liver function tests classified in accordance with the local reference ranges.  Results:   Patients with cancer had higher C-reactive protein and lower albumin levels (and thus a higher mGPS), higher adjusted calcium, Alk phos and GGT levels, but lower aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels (all P<0.001). The strongest associations (Spearman's correlation > or =0.3) in both the non-cancer and cancer groups were found between albumin, C-reactive protein and Alk phos, AST and ALT, AST and GGT and ALT and GGT (all P<0.001). On multivariate analysis, the associations with the presence of cancer remained with age, deprivation, C-reactive protein, albumin, adjusted calcium, Alk phos and GGT (all P<0.01). Patients following a diagnosis of cancer had lower albumin levels and thus higher mGPS (all P<0.001). Also, post-diagnosis patients were more likely to have lower adjusted calcium, bilirubin, Alk Phos, AST, ALT and GGT levels (all P<0.05). When the cancer diagnoses were ranked from those with the lowest proportion of mGPS 1 or 2 to those with the highest, the percentage of cases with a mGPS of 1 or 2 ranged from 21% in breast cancer to 46% in prostate cancer and to 68% in pulmonary cancer. Compared with breast cancer the mGPS was significantly higher in those diagnosed with dermatological, bladder, endocrinological, gynaecological, prostate, musculoskeletal, gastroesophageal, haematological, renal, colorectal, head and neck, pancreaticobiliary and pulmonary cancers (all P<0.001).  Conclusion:   The results of the present study indicate that the systemic inflammatory response is common in a large patient cohort, increased by the presence of cancer and associated with the perturbation of a number of biochemical parameters previously reported to be associated with mortality. There is a striking parallel between the proportions of cases with a mGPS of 1 or 2 and reported survival rates in these tumours.""","""['M J Proctor', 'D Talwar', 'S M Balmar', ""D S J O'Reilly"", 'A K Foulis', 'P G Horgan', 'D S Morrison', 'D C McMillan']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['An inflammation-based prognostic score (mGPS) predicts cancer survival independent of tumour site: a Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study.', 'The relationship between an inflammation-based prognostic score (Glasgow Prognostic Score) and changes in serum biochemical variables in patients with advanced lung and gastrointestinal cancer.', 'A comparison of inflammation-based prognostic scores in patients with cancer.

The ultimate goal is to evaluate the possibility of reducing the patient dose while maintaining registration accuracy under different projection-number schemes for various clinical sites. An Elekta Synergy Linear accelerator with an onboard CBCT system was used in this study. The quality of the Elekta XVI cone-beam three-dimensional volumetric images reconstructed with a decreasing number of projections was quantitatively evaluated by a Catphan phantom. Subsequently, we tested the registration accuracy of imaging data sets on three rigid anthropomorphic phantoms and three real patient sites under the reduced projection-number (as low as 1/6th) reconstruction of CBCT data with different rectilinear shifts and rota-tions. CBCT scan results of the Catphan phantom indicated the CBCT images got noisier when the number of projections was reduced, but their spatial resolution and uniformity were hardly affected. The maximum registration errors under the small amount transformation of the reference CT images were found to be within 0.7 mm translation and 0.3 masculine rotation. However, when the projection number was lower than one-fourth of the full set with a large amount of transformation of reference CT images, the registration could easily be trapped into local minima solutions for a nonrigid anatomy. We concluded, by using projection-number reduction strategy under conscientious care, imaging-guided localization procedure could achieve a lower patient dose without losing the registration accuracy for various clinical sites and situations. A faster scanning time is the main advantage compared to the mA decrease-based, dose-reduction method.""","""['Bo Lu', 'Haibin Lu', 'Jatinder Palta']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Characterization of a prototype rapid kilovoltage x-ray image guidance system designed for a ring shape radiation therapy unit.', 'Dual-energy imaging method to improve the image quality and the accuracy of dose calculation for cone-beam computed tomography.', 'Low-dose megavoltage cone-beam CT for radiation therapy.', 'Combining scatter reduction and correction to improve image quality in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).', 'Applications of linac-mounted kilovoltage Cone-beam Computed Tomography in modern radiation therapy: A review.', 'Comparison of subjective image analysis and effective dose between low-dose cone-beam computed tomography machines.', 'A review on medical imaging synthesis using deep learning and its clinical applications.', 'Registration accuracy with the low dose kilovoltage cone-beam CT: A phantom study.', 'Dose reduction potential of using gold fiducial markers for kilovoltage image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Deep learning-based image quality improvement for low-dose computed tomography simulation in radiation therapy.']"""

The IPSA inverse planning algorithms were modified to include multiple dose matrices for the calculation of dose from different sources, and a selection algorithm was implemented to allow for the swapping of source type at any given source position. Five previously treated patients with a range of prostate volumes from 20-48 cm3 were re-optimized under two hybrid scenarios: (1) using 0.32 and 0.51 mGy m2 / h 125I, and (2) using 0.64 and 0.76 mGy m2 / h 125I. Isodose lines were generated and dosimetric indices , V150Prostate, D90Prostate, V150Urethra, V125Urethra, V120Urethra,V100Urethra, and D10Urethra were calculated. The algorithm allows for the generation of single-isotope, multi-activity hybrid brachytherapy plans. By dealing with only one radionuclide, but of different activity, the biology is unchanged from a standard plan. All V100Prostate were within 2.3 percentage points for every plan and always above the clinically desirable 95%. All V150Urethra were identically zero, and V120Urethra is always below the clinically acceptable value of 1.0 cm3. Clinical optimization times for the hybrid plans are still under one minute, for most cases. It is possible to generate clinically advantageous brachytherapy plans (i.e. obtain the same quality dose distribution as a standard single-activity plan) while incorporating leftover seeds from a previous patient treatment. This method will allow a clinic to continue to provide excellent patient care, but at a reduced cost. Multi-activity hybrid plans were equal in quality (as measured by the standard dosimetric indices) to plans with seeds of a single activity. Despite the expanded search space, optimization times for these studies were still under two minutes on a modern day laptop and can be reduced to below one minute in a clinical setting. With the typical cost of a set of PPI seeds on the order of thousands of dollars, it is possible to reduce the cost of brachytherapy treatments by allowing for easier use of seeds left over from a previous patient or unused due to a cancelled treatment.""","""['J Adam M Cunha', 'Barby Pickett', 'Jean Pouliot']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['An open-source genetic algorithm for determining optimal seed distributions for low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Intraoperative dynamic dose optimization in permanent prostate implants.', 'Comparison of IPSA and HIPO inverse planning optimization algorithms for prostate HDR brachytherapy.', 'Paradigm Shift in Radiation Treatment Planning Over Multiple Treatment Modalities.', 'Hybrid optimization based on non-coplanar needles for brachytherapy dose planning.', 'Application programming in C# environment with recorded user software interactions and its application in autopilot of VMAT/IMRT treatment planning.']"""

To clarify a susceptibility gene and functional variants in this locus, we performed re-sequencing and fine mapping of this region and identified 12 candidates of functional single nucleotide polymorphisms that were absolutely linked with each other. Screening of these variants by RNA stability assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and reporter assay indicated that rs11781886 in the 5'-UTR of NKX3.1 displayed different binding affinity to nuclear proteins between the alleles, and that the transcriptional activity of the NKX3.1 promoter was significantly lower in the susceptible allele of this variant.

Fortunately, the survival rate for early diagnosed patients is relatively high. Therefore, in vivo imaging plays an important role for the detection and treatment of the disease. Accurate prostate cancer localization with noninvasive imaging can be used to guide biopsy, radiotherapy, and surgery as well as to monitor disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed with an endorectal coil provides higher prostate cancer localization accuracy, when compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, in general, a single type of MRI is not sufficient for reliable tumor localization. As an alternative, multispectral MRI, i.e., the use of multiple MRI-derived datasets, has emerged as a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the localization of prostate cancer; however almost all studies are with human readers. There is a significant inter and intraobserver variability for human readers, and it is substantially difficult for humans to analyze the large dataset of multispectral MRI. To solve these problems, this study presents an automated localization method using cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs) and shows that this method results in improved localization accuracy than classical SVM. Additionally, we develop a new segmentation method by combining conditional random fields (CRF) with a cost-sensitive framework and show that our method further improves cost-sensitive SVM results by incorporating spatial information. We test SVM, cost-sensitive SVM, and the proposed cost-sensitive CRF on multispectral MRI datasets acquired from 21 biopsy-confirmed cancer patients. Our results show that multispectral MRI helps to increase the accuracy of prostate cancer localization when compared to single MR images; and that using advanced methods such as cost-sensitive SVM as well as the proposed cost-sensitive CRF can boost the performance significantly when compared to SVM.""","""['Yusuf Artan', 'Masoom A Haider', 'Deanna L Langer', 'Theodorus H van der Kwast', 'Andrew J Evans', 'Yongyi Yang', 'Miles N Wernick', 'John Trachtenberg', 'Imam Samil Yetik']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Image Process""","""['Supervised and unsupervised methods for prostate cancer segmentation with multispectral MRI.', 'Prostate cancer segmentation with simultaneous estimation of Markov random field parameters and class.', 'Automated detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution ex vivo MRI.', 'The role of magnetic resonance imaging in targeting prostate cancer in patients with previous negative biopsies and elevated prostate-specific antigen levels.', 'Staging and tissue characterization of prostate carcinoma: role of endorectal MR imaging and MR spectroscopy.', 'Multi-resolution super learner for voxel-wise classification of prostate cancer using multi-parametric MRI.', 'Autosegmentation of Prostate Zones and Cancer Regions from Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Images by Using Deep-Learning-Based Neural Networks.', 'Efficiently Updating ECG-Based Biometric Authentication Based on Incremental Learning.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of different computer-aided diagnostic systems for prostate cancer based on magnetic resonance imaging: A systematic review with diagnostic meta-analysis.', 'Automated reference tissue normalization of T2-weighted MR images of the prostate using object recognition.']"""

In addition, for most classification problems, selecting the best performing classification algorithm amongst a number of competing algorithms is a difficult task for various reasons. As for example, the order of performance may depend on the performance measure employed for such a comparison. In this work, we present a novel adaptive ensemble classifier constructed by combining bagging and rank aggregation that is capable of adaptively changing its performance depending on the type of data that is being classified. The attractive feature of the proposed classifier is its multi-objective nature where the classification results can be simultaneously optimized with respect to several performance measures, for example, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. We also show that our somewhat complex strategy has better predictive performance as judged on test samples than a more naive approach that attempts to directly identify the optimal classifier based on the training data performances of the individual classifiers.  Results:   We illustrate the proposed method with two simulated and two real-data examples. In all cases, the ensemble classifier performs at the level of the best individual classifier comprising the ensemble or better.  Conclusions:   For complex high-dimensional datasets resulting from present day high-throughput experiments, it may be wise to consider a number of classification algorithms combined with dimension reduction techniques rather than a fixed standard algorithm set a priori.""","""['Susmita Datta', 'Vasyl Pihur', 'Somnath Datta']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Classifier ensemble construction with rotation forest to improve medical diagnosis performance of machine learning algorithms.', 'Computer-aided diagnosis of pulmonary nodules using a two-step approach for feature selection and classifier ensemble construction.', 'An analysis of ensemble pruning techniques based on ordered aggregation.', 'Bias in error estimation when using cross-validation for model selection.', 'Reviewing ensemble classification methods in breast cancer.', 'Validating machine learning models for the prediction of labour induction intervention using routine data: a registry-based retrospective cohort study at a tertiary hospital in northern Tanzania.', 'Reliable Prediction Models Based on Enriched Data for Identifying the Mode of Childbirth by Using Machine Learning Methods: Development Study.', 'Metagenomic Geolocation Prediction Using an Adaptive Ensemble Classifier.', 'M-ary Rank Classifier Combination: A Binary Linear Programming Problem.', 'Unraveling bacterial fingerprints of city subways from microbiome 16S gene profiles.']"""

To establish the etiologic role of XMRV infection in human disease requires large scale epidemiologic studies. Development of assays to detect XMRV-specific antibodies would greatly facilitate such studies. However, the nature and kinetics of the antibody response to XMRV infection have yet to be determined.  Results:   Three rhesus macaques were infected with XMRV to determine the dynamics of the antibody responses elicited by infection with XMRV. All macaques developed antibodies to XMRV during the second week of infection, and the predominant responses were to the envelope protein gp70, transmembrane protein p15E, and capsid protein p30. In general, antibody responses to gp70 and p15E appeared early with higher titers than to p30, especially in the early period of seroconversion. Antibodies to gp70, p15E and p30 persisted to 158 days and were substantially boosted by re-infection, thus, were identified as useful serologic markers. Three high-throughput prototype assays were developed using recombinant proteins to detect antibodies to these viral proteins. Both gp70 and p15E prototype assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity by detecting all Western blot (WB) positive serial bleeds from the XMRV-infected macaques and good specificity (99.5-99.9%) with blood donors. Seroconversion sensitivity and specificity of the p30 prototype assay were 92% and 99.4% respectively.  Conclusions:   This study provides the first demonstration of seroconversion patterns elicited by XMRV infection. The nature and kinetics of antibody responses to XMRV in primates were fully characterized. Moreover, key serologic markers useful for detection of XMRV infection were identified. Three prototype immunoassays were developed to detect XMRV-specific antibodies.

We have developed a high-throughput microscopy and image analysis system permitting the examination of live mixed cell cultures growing on 384-well plates, at the single cell level and over time. We have tested the effect of 107 samples of low passage number (<5) primary human fibroblasts from pediatric and adult donors, on the growth of six human tumor cell lines. Three of the lines were derived from prostate carcinomas, two from lung carcinomas and one was an EBV transformed lymphoblastoid line. Labeled tumor cells were grown in the presence of unlabeled fibroblasts. The majority of the tested fibroblasts inhibited the proliferation of the tumor cells, compared to the control cultures where labeled tumor cells were co-cultured with unlabeled tumor cells. The proliferation inhibiting effect of the fibroblasts differed depending on their site of origin and the age of the donor. Inhibition required direct cell contact. Mouse 3T3 fibroblasts inhibited the growth of SV40-transformed 3T3 cells and human tumor cells, showing that the inhibitory effect could prevail across the species barrier.

Here, we show that ERG knockdown in VCaP prostate cancer cells causes an activation of cell adhesion, resulting in strongly induced active beta(1)-integrin and E-cadherin expression as well as changes in WNT signaling. These observations were corroborated by data from ERG-overexpressing nontransformed prostate epithelial cells as well as gene expression data from clinical prostate cancer samples, which both indicated a link between ERG and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Upregulation of several WNT pathway members was seen in ERG-positive prostate cancers, with frizzled-4 (FZD4) showing the strongest overexpression as verified by both reverse transcription-PCR and immunostaining. Both ERG knockin and knockdown modulated the levels of FZD4 expression. FZD4 silencing could mimic the ERG knockdown phenotype by inducing active beta(1)-integrin and E-cadherin expression, whereas FZD4 overexpression reversed the phenotypic effects seen with ERG knockdown.

Though studies have discussed perceptions of PGD from a general population, couples or high-risk women, no studies to date have specifically examined PGD usage among men. This study sought to explore perceptions and attitudes towards PGD among males who either carry a BRCA mutation or have a partner or first degree relative with a BRCA mutation.  Methods:   A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 228 men visiting the Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered or Craigslist website. Eligibility criteria included men who self-reported they had been tested for a BRCA mutation or had a partner or first degree relative tested for a BRCA mutation. A 41-item survey assessed socio-demographic, clinical characteristics, PGD knowledge and attitudinal factors and consideration of the use of PGD. Differences in proportions of subgroups were tested using the Monte Carlo exact test for categorical data. A multiple logistic regression model was then built through a backward elimination procedure.  Results:   Although 80% of men reported being previously unfamiliar with PGD, after learning the definition of PGD, 34% of the 228 respondents then said they would 'ever consider the use of PGD'. Respondents who thought of PGD only in terms of 'health and safety' were almost three times more likely (OR = 2.82; 95% 1.19-6.71) to 'ever consider the use of PGD' compared with respondents who thought of PGD in terms of both 'health and safety', and 'religion and morality'.

For example, fitness programs may preferentially enroll people who are already committed to healthy lifestyles, including use of preventive services. Some of our earlier studies have attempted to account for this potential bias by including an ad hoc preventive services index created from the patient's number of earlier clinical preventive services, to adjust for health-seeking behaviors. However, this index has not been validated. We formally evaluated the performance of this preventive services index by comparing it with its component parts and with an alternative index derived from principal component analysis by using the weighted sums of the principal components.  Methods:   We used data from a cohort of 38,046 older adults. We used the following variables from the administrative database of a health maintenance organization to create this index: fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, screening mammogram, prostate cancer screening, influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination, and preventive care office visits.  Results:   The preventive services index was positively correlated with each of the following components: colon cancer screening (r = .752), screening mammogram (r = .559), prostate cancer screening (r = .592), influenza vaccination (r = .844), pneumococcal vaccination (r = .487), and preventive care office visits (r = .737). An alternative preventive services index, created by using principal component analysis, had similar performance.  Conclusion:   A preventive services index created by using administrative data has good face validity and construct validity and can be used to partially adjust for selection bias in observational studies of cost and use outcomes.""","""['Barbara Williams', 'Paula Diehr', 'James LoGerfo']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prev Chronic Dis""","""['Surveillance for certain health behaviors among States and selected local areas - United States, 2010.', 'Surveillance for certain health behaviors among states and selected local areas - United States, 2008.', 'Surveillance for Certain Health Behaviors, Chronic Diseases, and Conditions, Access to Health Care, and Use of Preventive Health Services Among States and Selected Local Areas\u2028- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, United States, 2012.', 'A review of the cost-effectiveness of adult influenza vaccination and other preventive services.', 'Automated telephone communication systems for preventive healthcare and management of long-term conditions.', 'Osteoporotic patients treated with bisphosphonates do not show the increased mortality observed in those untreated.', 'Activation of persons living with HIV for treatment, the great study.']"""

Methods:   Data on prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) by Perez et al. (2004), Amdur et al. (1990) and Lai et al. (1991) were analyzed in this study. The stage-combined pelvic control rate from Perez et al. was calculated to be 0.95±0.01, 0.87±0.02, and 0.72±0.04 for patients treated ≤7 weeks, 7.1-9 weeks, and >9 weeks respectively. Based on the Linear-Quadratic model, extended to account for tumor repopulation, the least χ² method was used to fit the clinical data and derive the onset time (T(k)) and effective doubling time (T(d)) for prostate cancer. Similar analysis was performed for the other two datasets.  Results:   Best fit was achieved with onset time T(k)=34±7 days and doubling time T(d)=12±2 days. These parameters were independent of the choice of the α/β values currently published in the literature. Analyses of the other two datasets showed T(k)=42±7 days with T(d)=9 ± 3 days, and T(k)=34±6 days with T(d)=34±5 days, respectively. T(k) was found to be dependent on tumor stage.  Conclusions:   Consistent values for onset time T(k) were obtained from different datasets, while the range of doubling time T(d) was large.

Carbohydrate antigen arrays, or glycan arrays, have emerged as powerful tools for the high-throughput analysis of carbohydrate-protein interactions. Our group has focused on the development and application of neoglycoprotein arrays, a unique array format wherein carbohydrates are covalently attached to a carrier protein prior to immobilization on the surface. The neoglycoprotein format permits variations of glycan structure, glycan density, and neoglycoprotein density on a single array. The focus of this study was on the effects of neoglycoprotein density on antibody binding. First, we evaluated binding of five monoclonal antibodies (81FR2.2, HE-195, HE-193, B480, and Z2A) to the blood group A antigen and found that neoglycoprotein density had a substantial effect on recognition. Next, we profiled serum antibodies in 15 healthy individuals and showed that inclusion of multiple neoglycoprotein densities helps distinguish different subpopulations of antibodies. Finally, we evaluated immune responses induced by a prostate cancer vaccine and showed that variations in neoglycoprotein density enable one to detect antibody responses that could not be detected otherwise. Neoglycoprotein density is a useful element of diversity for evaluating antibody recognition and, when combined with variations in glycan structure and glycan density, provides multidimensional glycan arrays with enhanced performance for monoclonal antibody development, biomarker discovery, and vaccine optimization.""","""['Yalong Zhang', 'Christopher Campbell', 'Qian Li', 'Jeffrey C Gildersleeve']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Biosyst""","""['The Glycan Array Platform as a Tool to Identify Carbohydrate Antigens.', 'Glycan array analysis of the antigen repertoire targeted by tumor-binding antibodies.', 'Serum antibody screening by surface plasmon resonance using a natural glycan microarray.', 'Glycan microarrays: powerful tools for biomarker discovery.', 'Multi-dimensional glycan microarrays with glyco-macroligands.', 'Use of a glycomics array to establish the anti-carbohydrate antibody repertoire in type 1 diabetes.', 'General Strategies for Glycan Microarray Data Processing and Analysis.', 'Anti-glycan IgM repertoires in newborn human cord blood.', 'Multivalent binding of concanavalin A on variable-density mannoside microarrays.', 'Factors contributing to variability of glycan microarray binding profiles.']"""

Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) accentuates the infiltration of immune cells within the prostate. However, the immunosuppressive pathways regulated by androgens in PCa are not well characterized. Arginase 2 (ARG2) expression by PCa cells leads to a reduced activation of tumor-specific T cells. Our hypothesis was that androgens could regulate the expression of ARG2 by PCa cells.  Methodology/principal findings:   In this report, we demonstrate that both ARG1 and ARG2 are expressed by hormone-sensitive (HS) and hormone-refractory (HR) PCa cell lines, with the LNCaP cells having the highest arginase activity. In prostate tissue samples, ARG2 was more expressed in normal and non-malignant prostatic tissues compared to tumor tissues. Following androgen stimulation of LNCaP cells with 10 nM R1881, both ARG1 and ARG2 were overexpressed. The regulation of arginase expression following androgen stimulation was dependent on the androgen receptor (AR), as a siRNA treatment targeting the AR inhibited both ARG1 and ARG2 overexpression. This observation was correlated in vivo in patients by immunohistochemistry. Patients treated by ADT prior to surgery had lower ARG2 expression in both non-malignant and malignant tissues. Furthermore, ARG1 and ARG2 were enzymatically active and their decreased expression by siRNA resulted in reduced overall arginase activity and l-arginine metabolism. The decreased ARG1 and ARG2 expression also translated with diminished LNCaP cells cell growth and increased PBMC activation following exposure to LNCaP cells conditioned media. Finally, we found that interleukin-8 (IL-8) was also upregulated following androgen stimulation and that it directly increased the expression of ARG1 and ARG2 in the absence of androgens.

The IGF-1R is frequently upregulated in cancers and signals from the cell surface to promote proliferation and cell survival. Recent attention has focused on the IGF-1R as a target for cancer treatment. Here, we report that the nuclei of human tumor cells contain IGF-1R, detectable using multiple antibodies to alpha- and beta-subunit domains. Cell-surface IGF-1R translocates to the nucleus following clathrin-mediated endocytosis, regulated by IGF levels. The IGF-1R is unusual among transmembrane receptors that undergo nuclear import, in that both alpha and beta subunits traffic to the nucleus. Nuclear IGF-1R is phosphorylated in response to ligand and undergoes IGF-induced interaction with chromatin, suggesting direct engagement in transcriptional regulation. The IGF dependence of these phenomena indicates a requirement for the receptor kinase, and indeed, IGF-1R nuclear import and chromatin binding can be blocked by a novel IGF-1R kinase inhibitor. Nuclear IGF-1R is detectable in primary renal cancer cells, formalin-fixed tumors, preinvasive lesions in the breast, and nonmalignant tissues characterized by a high proliferation rate. In clear cell renal cancer, nuclear IGF-1R is associated with adverse prognosis. Our findings suggest that IGF-1R nuclear import has biological significance, may contribute directly to IGF-1R function, and may influence the efficacy of IGF-1R inhibitory drugs.""","""['Tamara Aleksic', 'Meenali M Chitnis', 'Olga V Perestenko', 'Shan Gao', 'Peter H Thomas', 'Gareth D Turner', 'Andrew S Protheroe', 'Mark Howarth', 'Valentine M Macaulay']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Over-accumulation of nuclear IGF-1 receptor in tumor cells requires elevated expression of the receptor and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9.', 'Nuclear translocation of IGF-1R via p150(Glued) and an importin-β/RanBP2-dependent pathway in cancer cells.', 'Novel nuclear localization and potential function of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor/insulin receptor hybrid in corneal epithelial cells.', 'The nuclear translocation of insulin-like growth factor receptor and its significance in cancer cell survival.', 'Insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) signaling systems: novel treatment strategies for cancer.', 'Drugging IGF-1R in cancer: New insights and emerging opportunities.', 'Insulin‑like growth factor axis: A potential nanotherapy target for resistant cervical cancer tumors (Review).', 'Emerging Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Cancer: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.', 'The Insulin-like Growth Factor Signaling Pathway in Breast Cancer: An Elusive Therapeutic Target.', 'Hallmarks of cancer: The insulin-like growth factors perspective.']"""

Nevertheless, this standard therapy allows relapse of hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) with a poor prognosis. HRPC cells often express variant ARs, such as point-mutated alleles and splicing isoforms, resulting in androgen-independent cell growth and resistance to antiandrogen (e.g., flutamide). However, a pharmacological strategy to block such aberrant ARs remains to be established. Here, we established a reporter system that monitors AR-mediated activation of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter. Our chemical library screening revealed that the antibiotic nigericin inhibits AR-mediated activation of the PSA promoter and PSA production in prostate cancer cells. Nigericin suppressed the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell growth even though the cells expressed a flutamide-resistant mutant AR. These effects were caused by AR suppression at the mRNA and post-translational levels. In HRPC 22Rv1 cells, which express the full-length AR and the constitutively active, truncated ARs lacking the carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of both AR isoforms efficiently suppressed the androgen-independent cell growth, whereas knockdown of the full-length AR alone had no significant effect. It is noteworthy that nigericin was able to mimic the knockdown of both AR isoforms: it reduced the expression of the full-length and the truncated ARs, and it induced G(1) cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of 22Rv1 cells. These observations suggest that nigericin-like compounds that suppress AR expression at the mRNA level could be applied as new-type therapeutic agents that inhibit a broad spectrum of AR variants in HRPC.""","""['Tetsuo Mashima', 'Sachiko Okabe', 'Hiroyuki Seimiya']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['Zyflamend inhibits the expression and function of androgen receptor and acts synergistically with bicalutimide to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Ligand-independent activation of the androgen receptor by the differentiation agent butyrate in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Short hairpin RNA knockdown of the androgen receptor attenuates ligand-independent activation and delays tumor progression.', 'Increased androgen receptor transcription: a cause of castration-resistant prostate cancer and a possible therapeutic target.', 'Prostate cancer and apoptosis.', 'Molecular Screening for Nigericin Treatment in Pancreatic Cancer by High-Throughput RNA Sequencing.', 'High-throughput sequencing of circRNAs reveals novel insights into mechanisms of nigericin in pancreatic cancer.', 'Raddeanin A down-regulates androgen receptor and its splice variants in prostate cancer.', 'Aberrant RNA Splicing in Cancer and Drug Resistance.', 'Targeting Splicing in Prostate Cancer.']"""

One of the most important biologic challenges is the relative lack of effective cellular immune adjuvants. Effective physiologic immune responses are characterized by the local generation of a complex cytokine environment that activates and regulates multiple immune cell types. IRX-2 is a primary cell-derived biologic with physiological levels of multiple active cytokine components, produced under pharmaceutical standards. The hypothesis that IRX-2 amplifies the T cell response to defined antigens was assessed in mice by measuring the T cell-specific peptide response to a dominant mouse peptide (NFT) derived from human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). IRX-2 enhances the T cell response to NFT when antigens were delivered either via irradiated cells expressing human PSMA, NFT peptide in Incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) or NFT peptide conjugated to KLH. The T cell-specific activity was measured in spleen or lymph nodes cells by IFN-γ ELISpot and/or IFN-γ secretion over 6 days or in vivo by peptide-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (DTH). Further more, a single administration of IRX-2 with the antigen was not active as compared to 4 or 9 additional administrations which were sufficient to enhance the T cell response to antigens. The influence of IRX-2 on the B cell response to ovalbumin when it was used as a carrier protein was measured by ELISA. IRX-2 was compared to a commercially available combination adjuvant (MPL+TDM in squalene/Tween 80) which based on the literature is a potent adjuvant in murine systems. In the T cell assay IRX-2 was superior to the commercially available combination adjuvant and while IRX-2 also increased antibody titer, it was not as potent as the combination adjuvant. Mice immunized with IRX-2 and antigen also exhibited delayed tumor progression following challenge with PSMA-expressing tumor cells. These studies demonstrate that IRX-2 is an immunomodulator with adjuvant activity which preferentially enhances the T cell-specific responses to tumor associated antigens. Based on these studies, IRX-2 is a candidate for evaluation as a T cell adjuvant in a variety of preclinical vaccine delivery systems as well as in human clinical trials with cancer vaccine candidates.""","""['Paul H Naylor', 'Karla E Hernandez', 'April E Nixon', 'Harvey J Brandwein', 'Gabriel P Haas', 'Ching Y Wang', 'John W Hadden']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Vaccine""","""['Vaccine adjuvant systems containing monophosphoryl lipid A and QS21 induce strong and persistent humoral and T cell responses against hepatitis B surface antigen in healthy adult volunteers.', 'Primary T-cell and activated macrophage response associated with tumor protection using peptide/poly-N-acetyl glucosamine vaccination.', 'HLA-A2 and -A24-restricted glypican-3-derived peptide vaccine induces specific CTLs: preclinical study using mice.', 'Novel vaccines against M. tuberculosis.', 'Idiotypic vaccination for B-cell malignancies as a model for therapeutic cancer vaccines: from prototype protein to second generation vaccines.', 'IRX-2 natural cytokine biologic for immunotherapy in patients with head and neck cancers.', 'Increased immune infiltration and chemokine receptor expression in head and neck epithelial tumors after neoadjuvant immunotherapy with the IRX-2 regimen.', 'Novel Immunotherapeutic Approaches for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Immunostimulatory Activity of the Cytokine-Based Biologic, IRX-2, on Human Papillomavirus-Exposed Langerhans Cells.', 'Peptide Based Vaccine Approaches for Cancer-A Novel Approach Using a WT-1 Synthetic Long Peptide and the IRX-2 Immunomodulatory Regimen.']"""

Methods:   Participants were 19,042 male subjects in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (ACLS), ages 20-82years, who received a baseline medical examination including a maximal treadmill exercise test between 1976 and 2003. CRF levels were defined as low (lowest 20%), moderate (middle 40%), and high (upper 40%) according to age-specific distribution of treadmill duration from the overall ACLS population. PrCA was assessed from responses to mail-back health surveys during 1982-2004. Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and incidence rates (per 10,000 person-years of follow-up).  Results:   A total of 634 men reported a diagnosis of incident PrCA during an average of 9.3 ± 7.1 years of follow-up. Adjusted HRs (95% CIs) in men with moderate and high CRF relative to low CRF were, 1.68 (1.13-2.48) and 1.74 (1.15-2.62), respectively. The positive association between CRF and PrCA was observed only in the strata of men who were not obese, had ≥ 1 follow-up examination, or who were diagnosed ≤ 1995.  Conclusions:   Rather than revealing a causal relationship, the unexpected positive association observed between CRF and incident PrCA is most likely due to a screening/detection bias in more fit men who also are more health-conscious.

However, patients with larger prostates may still pose increased challenges because of impaired visualization and mobility in the pelvis. For this reason, we undertook a study to better understand the relationships between large prostate size and robotic prostatectomy outcomes with respect to intraoperative and pathologic factors.  Methods:   Patients undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy from 2003 to 2008 at our institution were included in this retrospective study. Prostate size was categorized into 3 groups (< 50, 50-100, > 100 g). We compared surgical and quality of life (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] scores) outcomes among groups using generalized linear models and chi-square testing.  Results:   Patients with the largest prostates had longer operative times (> 100 vs < 50 g, 250 vs 232 minutes, P < .01) and more blood loss (> 100 vs < 50 g, 250 vs 155 mL, P = .01). Conversely, these patients had fewer positive surgical margins and lower Gleason sums (both P < .01). Despite worse baseline irritative symptoms (> 100 vs < 50 g, 79.7 vs 90.0, P < .001) and sexual function (> 100 vs < 50 g, 38.2 vs 77.9, P < .001), these differences resolved at 3 months (P = .92, P = .88, respectively). Recovery of continence was relatively sluggish compared with that in patients with the smallest prostates (> 100 vs < 50 g; 44.0, 62.2, P = .03).  Conclusions:   Not surprisingly, larger prostate size was associated with increased operative times and blood loss, although of questionable clinical significance. While these patients appeared to benefit regarding irritative symptoms, recovery of continence was delayed.

The glycosylation of PSA is altered in PCa but studies in this area have been limited to few clinical samples and/or require advanced laboratory facilities. An assay to assess PSA glycosylation was established using equipment available in most routine biomedical testing laboratories.  Methods:   Serum samples from patients with PCa or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were used. PSA (range 4-10 ng/ml) was affinity purified, separated and probed with the lectin Ulex europaeus (UEA-1; specific for α1,2 linked fucose). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent lectin assay (ELLA) with colorimetric detection was devised and PSA fucosylation assessed in a further independent set of 26 samples.  Results:   Free PSA (fPSA) from PCa patients showed a significant increase in fucosylation compared with fPSA from patients with BPH. The ELLA was 92% specific and 69% sensitive for PCa over BPH. In comparison, fPSA measurement was 70% specific and 56% sensitive (threshold set to 25% tPSA) for PCa over BPH.

Although the prevalence of urine leaks ranges from 4.5% to 7.5% at high-volume RALP centers, urine leaks prolong catheterization and may lead to ileus, peritonitis, and require intervention. Barbed polyglyconate sutures maintain running suture line tension and may be advantageous in RALP anastomosis for reducing this complication.  Objective:   To compare barbed polyglyconate and polyglactin 910 (Vicryl, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) running sutures for RALP anastomosis.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-surgeon study comparing RALP anastomosis using either barbed polyglyconate (n = 45) or polyglactin 910 (n = 36) sutures.  Surgical procedure:   RALP anastomosis using either barbed polyglyconate or polyglactin 910 sutures was studied.  Measurements:   Operative time, cost differential, perioperative complications, and cystogram contrast extravasation by anastomosis suture type were measured.  Results and limitations:   Although baseline characteristics and overall operative times were similar, barbed polyglyconate sutures were associated with shorter mean anastomosis times of 9.7 min versus 9.8 min (p = 0.014). In addition, anastomosis with barbed polyglyconate rather than polyglactin 910 sutures was associated with more frequent cystogram extravasation 8 d postoperatively (20.0% vs 2.8%; p = 0.019), longer mean catheterization times (11.1 d vs 8.3 d; p = 0.048), and greater suture costs per case ($51.52 vs $8.44; p < 0.001). After 8 of 29 (27.6%) barbed polyglyconate anastomosis sites demonstrated postoperative day 8 cystogram extravasation, we modified our technique to avoid overtightening, reducing cystogram extravasation to 1 (6.3%) of 16 subsequent barbed polyglyconate anastomosis sites. Potential limitations include small sample size and the single-surgeon study design.  Conclusions:   Compared to traditional sutures, barbed polyglyconate is more costly and requires technical modification to avoid overtightening, delayed healing, and longer catheterization time following RALP.""","""['Stephen B Williams', 'Mehrdad Alemozaffar', 'Yin Lei', 'Nathanael Hevelone', 'Stuart R Lipsitz', 'Blakely A Plaster', 'Jim C Hu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prospective randomized trial of barbed polyglyconate suture to facilitate vesico-urethral anastomosis during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: time reduction and cost benefit.', 'Does the use of a barbed polyglyconate absorbable suture have an impact on urethral anastomosis time, urethral stenosis rates, and cost effectiveness during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy?', 'A short-term cost-effectiveness study comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic and open retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'Is robotic surgery cost-effective: yes.', 'Prostatectomy-pros and cons on open surgery/laparoscopic surgery/robot-assisted surgery.', 'Description of the technique for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in canine cadavers: 2D vs. 3D camera.', ""Van Velthoven single-knot running suture versus Chlosta's running suture versus single barbed suture V-Loc for vesicourethral anastomosis in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a retrospective comparative study."", 'Case Report: Small Bowel Obstruction Owing to Self-Anchoring Barbed Suture Device After TAPP Repair.', 'Continuous poliglecaprone suture versus bidirectional barded suture for urethrovesical anastomosis during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single-institute retrospective analysis of Chinese patients.', 'Are There Lower Complication Rates with Bidirectional Barbed Suture in Total Knee Arthroplasty Incision Closure?

Molecular chaperones are involved in protein folding, protein degradation, and protein trafficking among subcellular compartments.  Methods:   We selected 107 patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer at our hospital from 1999 through 2004. We performed an analysis by western blot and immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Clinical data were used to determine associations between immunohistochemical expression of Hsp60 and tumor behavior.  Results:   The expression level of Hsp60 was significantly increased in tumors with high Gleason score (P < .001). Hsp60 expression was also significantly associated with initial serum PSA levels (P < .01) and with the presence of lymph node metastasis (P < .003). In 50 locally advanced cancers treated by androgen ablation we found an association between high Hsp60-expressing tumors and an early onset of hormone refractory disease (P < .02) and reduced cancer-specific survival (P < .05).  Conclusions:   Hsp60 protein is overexpressed in poorly differentiated prostate cancers. Hsp60 expression is strongly associated with prognostic clinical parameters, such as Gleason score, initial serum PSA levels, and lymph node metastasis and with the onset of hormone-refractory disease and reduced cancer-specific survival.

In a retrospective single-center study of 1990 renal transplant recipients between November 1979 and November 2009, records of patients with urological neoplasms including epidemiological, clinical and survival parameters were accessed. Sixty-six de novo urological malignancies in 58 recipients were recorded in the study period, being most common after skin cancers (15.6% of enregistered tumors).

Patients and methods:   From April 1995 to June 2005, 284 patients with high-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 8 or prostate-specific antigen > 20 ng/mL or clinical stage ≥ T2 c) underwent brachytherapy. Supplemental external beam radiation therapy was given to 257 (90.5%) patients and 179 (63.0%) received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Median follow up was 7.8 years. The median post-implant day 0 D90 was 118.9% of prescription dose. Patients with metastatic prostate cancer or castrate-resistant disease without obvious metastases who died of any cause were classified as dead from prostate cancer. Multiple parameters were evaluated for impact on survival.  Results:   Twelve-year CSS, bPFS and OS were 94.2%, 89.0% and 69.7%. On multivariate analysis, bPFS was best predicted by percent positive biopsies and ADT. The analysis failed to identify any predictors for CSS, while OS was highly correlated with patient age, percent positive biopsies and diabetes. Fourteen percent of patients died from diseases of the heart, while 8%, 8% and 6% of patients died from non-prostate cancer, other causes and prostate cancer, respectively.

The expression level of Transgelin was 25-fold higher in tumorigenic cells than nontumorigenic cells. Similar results were also observed in tumorigenic cells derived from colorectal adenocarcinoma and prostate carcinoma. More importantly, the elevated levels of Transgelin significantly increased the invasiveness of tumorigenic cells, whereas reduced levels decreased the invasive potential. Moreover, in tumors derived from Huh7-induced xenografts, Transgelin was also co-expressed with CXCR4, which is responsible for tumor invasion.

Specific detection studies of anti-PSMA-conjugated nanocarrier binding activity in LNCaP prostate cancer cells are carried out. LNCaP cells are targeted successfully in vitro by the conjugation of anti-PSMA on the nanocarrier surfaces. To further explore targeting, the nanocarriers conjugated with anti-PSMA are intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice.

ET-1 also contributes to the transition of hormonally regulated androgen-dependent PC to androgen-independent disease. ET-1 is generated from big-ET-1 by endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1). ECE-1 is present in PC cell lines and primary tissue and is elevated in primary malignant stromal cells compared with benign. siRNA or shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous ECE-1 in either the epithelial or stromal compartment significantly reduced PC cell (PC-3) invasion and migration. The re-addition of ET-1 only partially recovered the effect, suggesting ET-1-dependent and -independent functions for ECE-1 in pPC. The ET-1-independent effect of ECE-1 on PC invasion may be due to modulation of downstream signalling events. Addition of an ECE-1 specific inhibitor to PC-3 cells reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a signalling molecule known to play a role in PC. siRNA-mediated knockdown of ECE-1 resulted in a significant reduction in FAK phosphorylation. Accordingly, transient ECE-1 overexpression in PNT1-a cells increased FAK phosphorylation.

Acting to block tumor formation, induction of senescence has also been demonstrated to contribute to tumor clearance via the immune system following p53 reactivation. The Hdm2-antagonist, Nutlin-3a, has been shown to reactivate p53 and induce a quiescent state in various cancer cell lines, similar to the G(1) arrest observed upon RNAi targeting of Hdm2 in MCF7 breast cancer. In the present study we show that HdmX, a negative regulator of p53, impacts the senescence pathway. Specifically, overexpression of HdmX blocks Ras mediated senescence in primary human fibroblasts. The interaction of HdmX with p53 and the re-localization of HdmX to the nucleus through Hdm2 association appear to be required for this activity. Furthermore, inhibiting HdmX in prostate adenocarcinoma cells expressing wild-type p53, mutant Ras and high levels of HdmX induced cellular senescence as measured by an increase in irreversible b-galactosidase staining. Together these results suggest that HdmX overexpression may contribute to tumor formation by blocking senescence and that targeting HdmX may represent an attractive anti-cancer therapeutic approach.""","""['Kelly R Miller', 'Kevin Kelley', 'Rebecca Tuttle', 'Steven J Berberich']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Alterations in gene expression and sensitivity to genotoxic stress following HdmX or Hdm2 knockdown in human tumor cells harboring wild-type p53.', 'Levels of HdmX expression dictate the sensitivity of normal and transformed cells to Nutlin-3.', 'HDMX-L is expressed from a functional p53-responsive promoter in the first intron of the HDMX gene and participates in an autoregulatory feedback loop to control p53 activity.', 'Hdmx modulates the outcome of p53 activation in human tumor cells.', 'HDM2 and HDMX Proteins in Human Cancer.', 'Targeting MDM4 as a Novel Therapeutic Approach in Prostate Cancer Independent of p53 Status.', 'A Regulatory MDM4 Genetic Variant Locating in the Binding Sequence of Multiple MicroRNAs Contributes to Susceptibility of Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'MDM2 turnover and expression of ATRX determine the choice between quiescence and senescence in response to CDK4 inhibition.', 'FL118 induces p53-dependent senescence in colorectal cancer cells by promoting degradation of MdmX.', 'SIRT1 promotes proliferation and inhibits the senescence-like phenotype in human melanoma cells.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate whether increased diagnostic activity is related to the incidence of prostate cancer among brothers of men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data were from the nationwide population-based Prostate Cancer Database Sweden (PCBaSe Sweden), which includes data from the National Prostate Cancer Register, the Swedish Cancer Register, the Register of the Total Population, the Multi-Generation Register, and the Census database. We investigated the relationship of tumor characteristics, time from diagnosis of the index patient (i.e., prostate cancer patients in the National Prostate Cancer Register for whom at least one brother and their father could be identified), calendar period, geographic factors, and socioeconomic status to standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for prostate cancer among 22 511 brothers of 13 975 index patients in PCBaSe Sweden.  Results:   Brothers of index patients with prostate cancer were at increased risk for a diagnosis of prostate cancer (SIR = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.9 to 3.3). Risk was higher for T1c tumors (SIR = 3.4, 95% CI = 3.2 to 3.8) than for metastatic tumors (SIR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.5 to 2.6), and risk of T1c tumors was especially high during the first year after the diagnosis of the index patient (SIR = 4.3, 95% CI = 3.8 to 4.9), compared with the following years (SIR range = 2.8-3.3), and for brothers of index patients who had a higher socioeconomic status (SIR = 4.2, 95% CI = 3.7 to 4.7), compared with brothers of index patients with lower socioeconomic status (SIR = 2.8, 95% CI = 2.4 to 3.2).

Methods and materials:   Between May 2002 and September 2008, 214 consecutive patients received brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer at our institution. A prospective analysis of factors predicting urinary toxicity was carried out for these patients. To evaluate urinary morbidity, the posttreatment International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 3, 9, and 18 months together with rates of urinary retention was recorded.  Results:   The mean patient age was 62 years, and the mean followup period was 24.4 months. The median IPSS before treatment was 5 (range, 0-20). This increased to 15 (0-33) at 3 months, before subsequently falling to 8 (0-31) and 6 (0-35) at 9 and 18 months, respectively. Twenty-six of 214 (12%) patients experienced urinary retention. Both prostatic length (p-value=0.001, <0.001) and volume (p-value=0.002, <0.001) correlated with a higher posttreatment IPSS at 3 and 9 months. In addition, prostate length and volume predicted those patients developing urinary retention requiring catheterization (p-value <0.001, <0.001). Pretreatment IPSS predicted IPSS at 3, 9, and 18 months (p-value <0.001, <0.001, and 0.011) but did not significantly correlate with retention rates. Other factors predicting IPSS at 3 months included radiation dose (D(90)) (p-value=0.01) and number of needles used (p-value=0.01).

However, few groups have explored the potential interaction between surgical margin status and other cancer characteristics, specifically pathological stage. We addressed the first degree of interaction between positive surgical margins and other established adverse predictors of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We used univariate and multivariate analysis to test the effect of surgical margin status on biochemical recurrence in 4,490 patients treated at a single institution between 1992 and 2008. We systematically tested all first-degree interactions between surgical margin status, and pretreatment prostate specific antigen, pT and pN stage, and radical prostatectomy Gleason sum. If interactions were significant, we quantified the effect on the biochemical recurrence rate.  Results:   Overall 850 patients (18.9%) had positive surgical margins. In those with negative vs positive surgical margins the 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 95% vs 83%, 74% vs 62% and 47% vs 29% for pT2, pT3a and pT3b disease, respectively. In multivariate models only the pT stage-surgical margin status interaction achieved independent predictor status (p = 0.003). Negative vs positive surgical margin multivariate HRs were 1 vs 2.9, 2.3 vs 4.3 and 4.1 vs 5.6 in pT2, pT3a and pT3b cases, respectively.  Conclusions:   Compared to negative surgical margins, positive surgical margins increase the absolute biochemical recurrence 5-year rate by 12% to 18%.

Arterial stiffness is a independent predictor of cardiovascular events and is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether PSA values, are associated with arterial stiffness indices in patients with essential arterial hypertension.  Methods:   The study comprised 150 consecutive male patients (mean age 60 years) with uncomplicated never-treated essential hypertension. All patients underwent a complete clinical and laboratory evaluation, including measurement of PSA levels. Aortic stiffness and arterial wave reflection assessment was made by using carotid-femoral (PWVc-f) pulse wave velocity and aortic augmentation index corrected for heart rate (AIx75). Patients with prostate cancer or benign prostate hyperplasia (PSA > 4 ng/mL) were excluded from the study.  Results:   PSA was positively associated with waist-to-hip ratio (r = 0.235, P = 0.04), PWVc-f (r = 0.426, P < 0.001), AIx75 (r = 0.264, P = 0.001), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; r = 0.376, P < 0.001). In categorization to PSA quartiles, patients in the higher quartile presented with higher waist-to hip ratio (P = 0.009), PWVc-f (P < 0.00001), AIx75 (P < 0.001) and hsCRP (P < 0.001) values. In multivariate analysis after adjustment for various confounders PSA remained a significant determinant of PWVc-f values (beta [SE] = 0.477 [0.13], R(2) = 0.405, P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   The present study points towards an association between PSA levels and aortic stiffness in untreated essential hypertensive males.

Advanced stage PCA cells possess unlimited replication potential as well as resistance to apoptosis. Therefore, targeting survival mechanisms and activating apoptotic machinery in PCA cells using nontoxic phytochemicals is suggested as an attractive strategy against this deadly malignancy. In the present study, we assessed the effect of one such botanical agent, namely isosilybin A, on apoptotic machinery and key members of cell survival signaling [Akt, NF-κB, and androgen receptor (AR)] in different PCA cells. Results showed that isosilybin A (90-180 µM) treatment significantly induces apoptotic death by activating both extrinsic (increased level of DR5 and cleaved caspase 8) and intrinsic pathways (caspase 9 and 3 activation) of apoptosis in three different human PCA cell lines namely 22Rv1, LAPC4, and LNCaP. Further, isosilybin A treatment decreased the levels of phospho-Akt (serine-473), total Akt, and the nuclear levels of NF-κB constituents (p50 and p65). Isosilybin A treatment also decreased the AR and PSA level in 22Rv1, LAPC4, and LNCaP cells. Employing pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD.fmk), we confirmed that isosilybin A-mediated decreased AR is independent of caspases activation. Temporal kinetics analysis showed that the primary effect of isosilybin A is on AR, as decrease in AR was evident much earlier (4 h) relative to caspase activation and apoptosis induction (12 h). Overall, our results demonstrated that isosilybin A activates apoptotic machinery in PCA cells via targeting Akt-NF-κB-AR axis; thereby, indicating a promising role for this phytochemical in the management of clinical PCA.""","""['Gagan Deep', 'Subhash C Gangar', 'Nicholas H Oberlies', 'David J Kroll', 'Rajesh Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Isosilybin B causes androgen receptor degradation in human prostate carcinoma cells via PI3K-Akt-Mdm2-mediated pathway.', 'Isosilybin B and isosilybin A inhibit growth, induce G1 arrest and cause apoptosis in human prostate cancer LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells.', 'Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB contributes to induction of death receptors and apoptosis by the synthetic retinoid CD437 in DU145 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Heat shock and other apoptosis-related proteins as therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tanshinone against Prostate Cancer.', 'Core Structure-Activity Relationship Studies of 5,7,20-O-Trimethylsilybins in Prostate Cancer Cell Models.', 'Effect of Silibinin on Dyslipidemia and Glycemic Alteration Associated with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: An Experimental Study on Rats.', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'Role of Silymarin in Cancer Treatment: Facts, Hypotheses, and Questions.', '3-O-Carbamoyl-5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybins: Synthesis and Preliminary Antiproliferative Evaluation.']"""

Indications for transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy were: abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE, 52 cases) and/or a total prostate specific antigen (PSA) over 4.0 microg/L (305 cases). In the subjects, their ages were between 49 years and 90 years, the mean: 69 years; PSAs were between 0.6 microg/L and 142.5 microg/L, the mean: 20.8 microg/L; and the prostate volumes were between 12.3 mL and 255.5 mL, the mean: 60.4 mL. Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy of 13 core scheme was conducted in each patient. The cancer detection rate for each biopsy core was calculated. The sensitivities of different combinations of biopsy cores were compared with a 13 core biopsy protocol and the prostate volumes were divided into two groups (<50 mL and >or=50 mL). The optimum number of biopsy cores was determined in patients with different prostate volumes.  Results:   Of the 323 patients 120 (37.2%) were positive for prostate cancer.

Methods:   The number of cycles and the duration of ON/OFF therapy for 45 PCa patients receiving IHT were observed. Maximal androgen blockade (MAB) therapies were used for six to nine months, and then stopped until the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) was decreased below 0.2 microg/L, which lasted for three months. It was decided whether MAB went on according to the level of PSA.  Results:   The average follow-up time was 40.7+/-13.4 months. Forty-one patients started the second cycle of treatment, of whom, 8 became androgen-independent and 7 were at T3-4M0 or M1 stages and the Gleason scores were above 8. Sixteen patients entered the third cycle, of whom, 14 were at lower than stage III and 13 had the Gleason scores below 7. From the first to the fourth courses of treatment, the average intervals were 8.7+/-5.4 (47.1%), 8.4+/-4.9 (49.3%), 7.0+/-3.4 (43.7%), and 3.7+/-0.6(42.5%) months respectively. Five patients developed bone metastasis. No one died up to now. According to the evaluation criteria, patients were divided into tolerance (n=16) and intolerance groups (n=29).

The patient was found to have an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at a general health check-up and was referred to the hospital. His serum PSA was 4.2 ng/mL. Digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography did not reveal a lesion. Transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate detected atypical, small prostatic glands suspected for adenocarcinoma at 2 cores. However immunohistochemistry showed nuclear p63 expression in the suspicious glands. Repeat biopsy revealed only high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In the third transrectal biopsy, finding of the same atypical glands showing perineural invasion facilitated the diagnosis of malignancy. The patient underwent a radical prostatectomy. Five different small tumor foci were seen in the prostate after pathological evaluation, one of which was p63 positive and the others p63 negative. The largest of the classic p63-negative tumors showed a TMPRSS2-ERG translocation by fluorescent in situ hybridization while the p63-positive tumor did not.

We characterized determinants of performance and extent of PLND during radical prostatectomy in elderly men.  Methods:   A population-based study was conducted comprised of 5448 men ≥65 years undergoing RRP and MIRP during 2004 to 2006 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the effect of demographic and tumor characteristics, surgical approach, and surgeon volume on the likelihood of performing PLND.  Results:   PLND was performed for 87.6% vs. 38.3% of men undergoing RRP vs. MIRP (P <.001). Among RRP, 82.6% vs. 4.6% underwent extended vs. limited PLND, with a median yield of 4 vs. 3 lymph nodes (P <.001). Median MIRP PLND yield was 3 lymph nodes.

The nuclear targeting peptide, an HIV-1 protein-derived TAT sequence, has been previously shown to aid entry of cargo through the cell membrane via normal cellular processes, and furthermore, to localize small cargo to the nucleus of the cell. Previous work in our lab has verified cell uptake and distribution of the nanoprobes in clinically relevant mouse and human cell lines. In this work, two-dimensional SERS mapping was used to track the spatial and temporal progress of nanoparticle uptake in PC-3 human prostate cells and to characterize localization at various time points, demonstrating the potential for an intracellularly targeted multiplexed nanobiosensing system with excellent sensitivity and specificity. Silver nanoparticles co-functionalized with the TAT peptide showed greatly enhanced cellular uptake over the control nanoparticles lacking the targeting moiety. The ability to detect and monitor nanoprobe trafficking using SERS spectroscopy offers an improved alternative over previous tracking and detection methods such as light microscopy and fluorescence methods.

Since CSCs are able to proliferate and self-renew extensively due to their ability to express anti-apoptotic and drug resistant proteins, thus sustaining tumor growth. Therefore, the strategy to eradicate CSCs might have significant clinical implications. The objectives of this study were to examine the molecular mechanisms by which epigallocathechin gallate (EGCG) inhibits stem cell characteristics of prostate CSCs, and synergizes with quercetin, a major polyphenol and flavonoid commonly detected in many fruits and vegetables.  Results:   Our data indicate that human prostate cancer cell lines contain a small population of CD44+CD133+ cancer stem cells and their self-renewal capacity is inhibited by EGCG. Furthermore, EGCG inhibits the self-renewal capacity of CD44+alpha2beta1+CD133+ CSCs isolated from human primary prostate tumors, as measured by spheroid formation in suspension. EGCG induces apoptosis by activating capase-3/7 and inhibiting the expression of Bcl-2, survivin and XIAP in CSCs. Furthermore, EGCG inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition by inhibiting the expression of vimentin, slug, snail and nuclear beta-catenin, and the activity of LEF-1/TCF responsive reporter, and also retards CSC's migration and invasion, suggesting the blockade of signaling involved in early metastasis. Interestingly, quercetin synergizes with EGCG in inhibiting the self-renewal properties of prostate CSCs, inducing apoptosis, and blocking CSC's migration and invasion. These data suggest that EGCG either alone or in combination with quercetin can eliminate cancer stem cell-characteristics.  Conclusion:   Since carcinogenesis is a complex process, combination of bioactive dietary agents with complementary activities will be beneficial for prostate cancer prevention and/ortreatment.""","""['Su-Ni Tang', 'Chandan Singh', 'Dara Nall', 'Daniel Meeker', 'Sharmila Shankar', 'Rakesh K Srivastava']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Mol Signal""","""['Inhibition of sonic hedgehog pathway and pluripotency maintaining factors regulate human pancreatic cancer stem cell characteristics.', 'Resveratrol inhibits pancreatic cancer stem cell characteristics in human and KrasG12D transgenic mice by inhibiting pluripotency maintaining factors and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Sulforaphane synergizes with quercetin to inhibit self-renewal capacity of pancreatic cancer stem cells.', 'Human cancer stem cells are a target for cancer prevention using (-)-epigallocatechin gallate.', 'The ""Big Five"" Phytochemicals Targeting Cancer Stem Cells: Curcumin, EGCG, Sulforaphane, Resveratrol and Genistein.', 'The Role of Natural Flavonoids as Telomerase Inhibitors in Suppressing Cancer Growth.', 'A Comprehensive Analysis and Anti-Cancer Activities of Quercetin in ROS-Mediated Cancer and Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Pinostrobin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cancer stem-like cells through a reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism.', 'Bax/Bcl-2 Cascade Is Regulated by the EGFR Pathway: Therapeutic Targeting of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Quercetin Regulates Key Components of the Cellular Microenvironment during Early Hepatocarcinogenesis.']"""

The comparison concentrated on staffing, case mix and operational budgets, but was not able to look at changes in access to services. Data were collected from the two facilities from January 2008 to June 2008 inclusive. A number of factors were compared, including case mix, staffing levels, delay times for treatment, research, training and treatment costs. The case mix between the two areas was similar with curative treatments making up just over half the work load in both centres and two-thirds the work being made up of cancers of breast and prostate. Staffing levels were leaner in Toowoomba, especially in the areas of nursing, administration and trial coordinators. Research activity was slightly higher in Toowoomba. The average medicare cost per treatment course was similar in both centres ($5000 per course). Total costs of an average treatment including patient, State and Commonwealth costs, showed a 30% difference in costing favouring Toowoomba. This regional radiation oncology centre has provided state-of-the-art cancer care that is close to home for patients living in the Darling Downs region. Both public and private patients have been treated with modest costs to the patient and significant savings to QH. The case mix is similar to the QHF, and there has been significant activity in clinical research. A paperless working environment is one factor that has allowed staffing levels to be reduced.

All imaging results and other relevant data were extracted from the imaging reports and medical charts.  Results:   Based on all imaging-detected disease sites, both FCH-PET/CT and FDG-PET/CT (79%) were more sensitive than CI (14%), with the highest number of sites of nodal and distant disease on FCH PET/CT. FCH-PET/CT alone would have provided sufficient clinical information to form an appropriate management plan in 88% of cases, as compared with 56% for CI.

This study investigates how initial treatment choice affects short-term and long-term costs.  Methods:   This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study followed prostate-cancer cases diagnosed in 2000 for 5 years using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Men age≥66 years, in Medicare fee for service, diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer in 2000 while residing in a SEER region, were matched to noncancer controls using age, sex, race, region, comorbidity, and survival. On the basis of treatment received during the first 9 months postdiagnosis, patients were assigned to watchful waiting, radiation, hormonal therapy, hormonal+radiation, and surgery (may have received other treatments). Incremental costs for prostate cancer were the difference in costs for prostate cancer cases versus matched controls. Costs were divided into initial treatment (months -1 to 12), long-term (each 12 months thereafter), and total (months -1 to 60). Sensitivity analyses excluded the last 12 months of life.  Results:   A total of 13,769 prostate-cancer cases were matched to 13,769 noncancer controls. Watchful waiting had the lowest initial treatment ($4270) and 5-year total costs ($9130). Initial treatment costs were highest for hormonal+radiation ($17,474) and surgery ($15,197). At $26,896, 5-year total costs were highest for hormonal therapy only followed by hormonal+radiation ($25,097) and surgery ($19,214). After excluding the last 12 months of life, total costs were highest for hormonal+radiation ($23,488) and hormonal therapy ($23,199).

To understand aberrant signaling through the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CaR) in prostate cancer cells, we compared expression of CaR signaling components in human nonmalignant prostate epithelial cells and several prostate cancer cell lines, as well as normal human prostate and prostate tumor specimens. We found that levels of the CaR, Gα(12) and p115RhoGEF expression are significantly up-regulated in more tumorigenic prostate cancer cells and prostate tumor specimens. By silencing CaR, Gα(12), p115RhoGEF or choline kinase (ChoK) expression, analyzing the change in lipid profiles, blocking signaling pathways using chemical inhibitors, and co-immunoprecipitating the relevant signaling proteins, we demonstrate that p115RhoGEF, a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) with GAP activity for Gα(12/13) and with guanine nucleotide exchange activity for the small G protein Rho, plays an important role in the regulation of Ca(o)(2+)-induced ChoK activation and cell proliferation in more tumorigenic prostate cancer cell lines.

In an effort to explain the mechanism of tumour sensitivity to satraplatin, the cytotoxic effects in a panel of CRC cell lines was examined with regard to their p53 genotype in comparison with oxaliplatin.  Methods:   CRC cell lines were chosen to ascertain the mechanism of satraplatin-enhanced cytotoxicity. Cells were incubated with oxaliplatin and satraplatin for 24-72 h, followed by the assessment of cell chemosensitivity with MTS. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expressions of p53-related molecules. Flow cytometry was used to monitor cell cycle perturbation while qRT-PCR to detect mRNA and miRNAs activities.  Results:   Satraplatin treatment resulted an elevated increase in cell death in vitro compared to oxaliplatin preceded by an acute arrest at G2/M phase, along with cyclin B1 and p21(waf/cip1) up-regulation. It also exhibited fourfold higher cellular platinum accumulations compared to oxaliplatin. Satraplatin treatment induces p53-related genes and its direct microRNA target of miR-34a independently. Thus, it potentiates apoptosis via multiple death pathways including the caspase 8 cleavages and Fas protein expression. The data suggest that the loss of p53 can increase oxaliplatin resistance but not satraplatin resistance.  Conclusion:   Further molecular biology studies are needed to identify the activity of satraplatin in platinum-resistant cancer models and to determine whether this orally administered platinum analogue has synergistic effects in combination with other chemotherapy agents.""","""['Murugan Kalimutho', 'Antonella Minutolo', 'Sandro Grelli', 'Amanda Formosa', 'Giulia Sancesario', 'Alessandra Valentini', 'Giorgio Federici', 'Sergio Bernardini']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Preclinical antitumor activity of the oral platinum analog satraplatin.', 'Platinum-(IV)-derivative satraplatin induced G2/M cell cycle perturbation via p53-p21(waf1/cip1)-independent pathway in human colorectal cancer cells.', 'KRAS(D13) Promotes apoptosis of human colorectal tumor cells by ReovirusT3D and oxaliplatin but not by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.', 'Apoptosis and chemo-resistance in colorectal cancer.', 'P53 mutations in colorectal cancer - molecular pathogenesis and pharmacological reactivation.', 'COMMD3 loss drives invasive breast cancer growth by modulating copper homeostasis.', 'Platinum Nanoparticles in Biomedicine: Preparation, Anti-Cancer Activity, and Drug Delivery Vehicles.', 'LNC CRYBG3 inhibits tumor growth by inducing M phase arrest.', 'Interactions between anticancer active platinum complexes and non-coding RNAs/microRNAs.', 'CEP55 is a determinant of cell fate during perturbed mitosis in breast cancer.']"""

After sorting TIL-2742, the purified CD56(+)CD16(-)CD3(-) subset showed reactivity similar to TIL-2742 while the CD56(-)CD16(-)CD3(+) cells exhibited no tumor recognition. In co-culture assays, TIL-2742 and the NK subset expressed high reactivity to several pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines and could lyse the autologous tumor as well as pancreas and prostate cancer lines. Reactivity was partially abrogated by blockade of TRAIL. We thus identified a unique subset of NK cells (CD56(bright)CD16(dim)) isolated from a regressing metastatic pancreatic cancer in a patient responding to Ipilimumab.

Furthermore, BMPs play critical roles in maintaining the homeostasis of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, reproductive, urogenital, and nervous systems in adult life. Like all members of the TGF-beta superfamily, BMP signaling is mediated through a heteromeric complex of type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. The subsequent signal transduction cascade includes either the canonical Smad-dependent or non-canonical Smad-independent pathways. Reflecting the critical function of BMPs, BMP signaling is tightly regulated at multiple steps by various mechanisms including extracellular endogenous antagonists, neutralizing antibodies/extracellular soluble receptor domains, small molecule inhibitors, cytoplasmic inhibitory Smads, and transcriptional co-repressors. Recently, dorsomorphin, the first small molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling, was identified and suggested as a useful tool for dissecting the mechanisms of signaling pathways and for developing novel therapeutics for diverse human diseases that are related to the BMP signaling pathways.

In a previous small pilot study, we found 2 days per week of IF with ad libitum feeding on the other days resulted in trends toward prolonged survival of mice bearing prostate cancer xenografts. We sought to confirm these findings in a larger study. A total of 100 (7- to 8-week-old) male severe combined immunodeficiency mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 10(5) LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells. Mice were randomized to either ad libitum Western Diet (44% carbohydrates, 40% fat and 16% protein) or ad libitum Western Diet with twice-weekly 24 h fasts (IF). Tumor volumes and mouse bodyweights were measured twice weekly. Mice were killed when tumor volumes reached 1000 mm(3). Serum and tumor were collected for analysis of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) hormonal axis. Overall, there was no difference in mouse survival (P=0.37) or tumor volumes (P ≥ 0.10) between groups. Mouse body weights were similar between arms (P=0.84). IF mice had significantly higher serum IGF-1 levels and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratios at killing (P<0.001). However, no difference was observed in serum insulin, IGFBP-3 or tumor phospho-Akt levels (P ≥ 0.39). IF did not improve mouse survival nor did it delay prostate tumor growth.

The strategy of hybrid stimulus on PDA vesicle chip offers the amplification method of fluorescent signal which combines a primary response by the immune reaction of antigen-antibody and a secondary response by the mechanical pressure of pAb-conjugated magnetic beads. As the primary response result on PDA vesicle chip, the PSA-ACT complex in PBS buffer was detected at 10 ng/mL. However, this detection sensitivity was insufficient for diagnosis of prostate cancer because the normal human PSA concentration is less than 4.0 ng/mL. To solve this problem, polyclonal PSA antibody-conjugated magnetic beads were used as an amplifying agent after primary immunoresponse. As a result, the PSA-ACT complex concentrations (as low as 0.1 ng/mL) could be detected in the PBS buffer sample.

Methods and materials:   A total of 486 daily computed tomography (CT) sets acquired for 20 prostate cancer patients treated with daily CT-guided repositioning using a linear accelerator and CT-on-rail combination were analyzed. The prostate, rectum, and bladder, delineated on each daily CT data set, were compared with those from the planning CT scan. Several quantities, including Dice's coefficient and the maximal overlapping rate, were used to characterize the interfraction variations. The delivered dose was reconstructed by applying the original plan to the daily CT scan with consideration of proper repositioning.  Results:   The mean prostate Dice's coefficient and maximal overlapping rate after bony registration was 69.7%±13.8% (standard deviation) and 85.6%±7.8% (standard deviation), respectively. The daily delivered dose distributions were generally inferior to the planned dose distribution for target coverage and/or normal structure sparing. For example, for approximately 5% of the treatment fractions, the prostate volume receiving 100% of the prescription dose decreased dramatically (15-20%) compared with its planned value. The magnitudes of the interfraction variations and their dosimetric effects indicated that, statistically, current standard repositioning using prostate alignment might be adequate for two-thirds of the fractions, but for the rest of the fractions, better on-line correction strategies, such as on-line replanning, are needed.  Conclusion:   Different adaptive correction schemes for prostatic interfraction changes can be used according to the anatomic changes, as quantified by the organ displacement and deformation parameters. On-line replanning is needed for approximately one-third of the treatment fractions.""","""['Cheng Peng', 'Ergun Ahunbay', 'Guangpei Chen', 'Savannah Anderson', 'Colleen Lawton', 'X Allen Li']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Online adaptive replanning method for prostate radiotherapy.', 'Adaptive radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'PET and PET/CT in radiation treatment planning for prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of intrafraction motion and its dosimetric impact on prostate radiotherapy using an in-house developed position monitoring system.', 'Assessment of delivered dose in prostate cancer patients treated with ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy on 1.5-Tesla MR-Linac.', 'Impact of intrafraction changes in delivered dose of the day for prostate cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy via MR-Linac.', 'MR-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer: state of the art and future perspectives.', 'Dosimetric benefits of daily treatment plan adaptation for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.']"""

The structure and functions of caveolae have been shown to require caveolin-1, a major protein component of caveolae. Caveolin-1 expression and secretion are increased in metastatic prostate cancer, and caveolin-1 seems to contribute to prostate cancer growth and metastasis. Recently, a cytoplasmic protein named PTRF (Polymerase I and Transcript Release Factor) or cavin-1 was found to be required, in concert with caveolin-1, for the formation and functions of caveolae. Genetic ablation of PTRF results in loss of caveolae while caveolin-1 is still expressed, albeit at reduced level, but associates with flat plasma membrane. In metastatic PC3 prostate cancer cells that express abundant caveolin-1 but no PTRF, heterologous PTRF expression restores caveola formation and caveolin-1 distribution (Hill et al., 2008; Cell 132, 113-124). We now show that PTRF/cavin-1-expressing PC3 cells exhibit decreased migration, and that this effect is mediated by reduced MMP9 production. PTRF/cavin-1, and to a lesser extent, cavin-2, -3, and -4 all decreased MMP9. We further show that the PTRF/cavin-1-mediated reduction of MMP9 production is independent of caveola formation. Taken together, our results suggest that PTRF/cavin-1 expression alters prostate cancer aggressiveness.""","""['Cho Sanda Aung', 'Michelle M Hill', 'Michele Bastiani', 'Robert G Parton', 'Marie-Odile Parat']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur J Cell Biol""","""['PTRF/Cavin-1 decreases prostate cancer angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.', 'PTRF-Cavin, a conserved cytoplasmic protein required for caveola formation and function.', 'Caveola-forming proteins caveolin-1 and PTRF in prostate cancer.', 'Galectin-3 Overrides PTRF/Cavin-1 Reduction of PC3 Prostate Cancer Cell Migration.', 'Cavin Family: New Players in the Biology of Caveolae.', 'Caveolin-1 in Müller Glia Exists as Heat-Resistant, High Molecular Weight Complexes.', 'Caveolar and non-Caveolar Caveolin-1 in ocular homeostasis and disease.', 'Cavin3 Suppresses Breast Cancer Metastasis via Inhibiting AKT Pathway.', 'miR-1301-3p promotes the proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells via direct repression of polymerase I and transcript release factor.', 'Prognostic and diagnostic significance of Cavin 2 in lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

This longitudinal study investigates the association between prostate cancer diagnostic and treatment outcomes and key area-level characteristics and individual-level demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors.  Methods/design:   A total of 1064 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between February 2005 and July 2007 were recruited through hospital-based urology outpatient clinics and private practices in the centres of Brisbane, Townsville and Mackay (82% of those referred). Additional clinical and diagnostic information for all 6609 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Queensland during the study period was obtained via the population-based Queensland Cancer Registry.Respondent data are collected using telephone and self-administered questionnaires at pre-treatment and at 2 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months and 60 months post-treatment. Assessments include demographics, medical history, patterns of care, disease and treatment characteristics together with outcomes associated with prostate cancer, as well as information about quality of life and psychological adjustment. Complementary detailed treatment information is abstracted from participants' medical records held in hospitals and private treatment facilities and collated with health service utilisation data obtained from Medicare Australia. Information about the characteristics of geographical areas is being obtained from data custodians such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Geo-coding and spatial technology will be used to calculate road travel distances from patients' residences to treatment centres. Analyses will be conducted using standard statistical methods along with multilevel regression models including individual and area-level components.  Conclusions:   Information about the diagnostic and treatment patterns of men diagnosed with prostate cancer is crucial for rational planning and development of health delivery and supportive care services to ensure equitable access to health services, regardless of geographical location and individual characteristics.This study is a secondary outcome of the randomised controlled trial registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12607000233426).""","""['Peter D Baade', 'Joanne F Aitken', 'Megan Ferguson', 'Robert A Gardiner', 'Suzanne K Chambers']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A multilevel investigation of inequalities in clinical and psychosocial outcomes for women after breast cancer.', 'A multilevel study of the determinants of area-level inequalities in colorectal cancer survival.', 'Factors associated with treatment received by men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Queensland, Australia.', 'Appendix to dialysis centre guidelines: recommendations for the relationship between outpatient haemodialysis centres and reference hospitals.

Increased yields are required, particularly considering the conjugation of cost-intensive biomolecules like RNA aptamers.  Results:   Using a DNA aptamer directed against streptavidin, in situ conjugation results in nanoparticles with diameters of approximately 9 nm exhibiting a high aptamer surface density (98 aptamers per nanoparticle) and a maximal conjugation efficiency of 40.3%. We have demonstrated the functionality of the aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles using three independent analytical methods, including an agglomeration-based colorimetric assay, and solid-phase assays proving high aptamer activity. To demonstrate the general applicability of the in situ conjugation of gold nanoparticles with aptamers, we have transferred the method to an RNA aptamer directed against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Successful detection of PSMA in human prostate cancer tissue was achieved utilizing tissue microarrays.  Conclusions:   In comparison to the conventional generation of bio-conjugated gold nanoparticles using chemical synthesis and subsequent bio-functionalization, the laser-ablation-based in situ conjugation is a rapid, one-step production method.

Our results suggest that some but not all aspects of men's sexual well-being are affected by treatment for prostate cancer. Further, the specific aspects that were affected as well as their emotional impact varied considerably from individual to individual. Most of the men reported that, prior to diagnosis and treatment, they engaged in regular sexual activity and that they had been satisfied or very satisfied with their sexual relationship. Following treatment, most (but not all) of the men reported no change in the amount and type of affection expressed, the quality of their romantic relationship, their self-concept as a man, or their sexual desire. In contrast, nearly all of the men described negative changes that were distressing to them in erections, orgasmic consistency, and sexual satisfaction. Further, most of the men believed that their sex life was over due to their erectile difficulties and so had stopped engaging in any sexual activity with their partner, although one third of them continued to masturbate. Five themes emerged with respect to factors that either contributed to or buffered the emotional impact of these changes: partner responses to changes in sexual functioning, effectiveness of medical treatments, communication with their partner about sexual functioning, acceptance of or resignation to sexual changes, and communication with physicians about sexual functioning.

Methods:   This is a descriptive qualitative study of 23 rural and urban 65 years old and older African-American prostate cancer survivors. Five focus groups were conducted containing African-American prostate cancer survivors who were recruited from community-based centers (e.g., churches, barbershops, diners, and primary care clinics) in central Virginia and Maryland. Focus group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded. Data were organized and managed using a qualitative analysis software program. Emerging themes uncovered specific problems for older rural African-American men with cancer, and focus group data were examined for potential solutions to these problems.  Results:   Two common themes emerged: (1) family and physician support are important, and (2) insurance is a necessity for appropriate health care. A difference between rural and urban African-American prostate cancer survivors emerged as well: difference in spirituality during diagnosis and treatment.  Conclusions:   Rural and urban African-American prostate cancer survivors' major support resource was their wives. Health insurance played a critical role as a support source by decreasing anxiety and financial hardships. Understanding rural and urban African-American prostate cancer survivors' support needs and challenges in relation to cancer diagnosis and treatment will allow nurses and other health-care providers to tailor cancer health plans more effectively for this population.""","""['Randy A Jones', 'Jennifer Wenzel', 'Ivora Hinton', 'Michael Cary', 'Naomi R Jones', 'Sharon Krumm', 'Jean G Ford']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['African-American survivors of prostate cancer: a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies.', 'Cancer support and resource needs among African American older adults.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Exploring the role of community health workers in providing cancer navigation: perceptions of African American older adults.', 'Complementary and alternative medicine modality use and beliefs among African American prostate cancer survivors.', 'Barriers and facilitators to accessing and utilising post-treatment psychosocial support by Black men treated for prostate cancer-a systematic review and qualitative synthesis.', 'African-American survivors of prostate cancer: a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies.', 'The association of marital status and mortality among men with early-stage prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: insight into post-prostatectomy survival strategies.', 'Quality of Life Among Black Prostate Cancer Survivors: An Integrative Review.', ""African American elders' psychological-social-spiritual cultural experiences across serious illness: an integrative literature review through a palliative care lens.""]"""

Deregulation of MSTs has been associated with disease progression in prostate and colorectal cancer. The four human MSTs are regulated differently by C-terminal regions flanking the catalytic domains.  Principal findings:   We have determined the crystal structure of kinase domain of MST4 in complex with an ATP-mimetic inhibitor. This is the first structure of an inactive conformation of a member of the MST kinase family. Comparison with active structures of MST3 and MST1 revealed a dimeric association of MST4 suggesting an activation loop exchanged mechanism of MST4 auto-activation. Together with a homology model of MST2 we provide a comparative analysis of the kinase domains for all four members of the human MST family.  Significance:   The comparative analysis identified new structural features in the MST ATP binding pocket and has also defined the mechanism for autophosphorylation. Both structural features may be further explored for inhibitors design.

Methods:   We performed (i) in vitro studies including luciferase reporter gene assays, MTS cell viability assays, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in PC-3 AP-1 human PCa cells, (ii) in vivo temporal (3 h and 12 h) microarray studies in the prostate of Nrf2-deficient mice that was validated by qRT-PCR, and (iii) in silico bioinformatic analyses to delineate conserved Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) in the promoter regions of Nrf2 and AP-1, as well as coregulated genes including ATF-2 and ELK-1.  Results:   Our study shows that AP-1 activation was attenuated by the combinations of SFN (25 micromol/L) and EGCG (20 or 100 micromol/L) in PC-3 cells. Several key Nrf2-dependent genes were down-regulated (3-fold to 35-fold) after in vivo administration of the combination of EGCG (100 mg/kg) and SFN (45 mg/kg).

Previously, we isolated and analyzed a subpopulation of PC-3 prostate cancer cells, TEM4-18, and found that these cells both invaded an endothelial barrier more efficiently and exhibited enhanced metastatic colonization in vivo. Transendothelial migration of these cells depended on expression of ZEB1, a known regulator of EMT. Surprisingly, these cells were much less invasive than parental PC-3 cells in assays that involve matrix barriers. Here, we report that TEM4-18 cells express significantly reduced levels of two subunits of laminin-332 (β3 and γ2) and that exogenous laminin-332, or co-culture with laminin-332-expressing cells, rescues the in vitro invasion phenotype in these cells. Stable knockdown of ZEB1 in prostate cancer cells up-regulated LAMC2 and ITGB4 mRNA and protein and resulted in a concomitant increase in Transwell migration. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we show that ZEB1 directly interacts with the promoters of LAMC2 and ITGB4.

Among many functions, PTEN negatively regulates the cytoplasmic phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT anti-apoptotic pathway; and nuclear PTEN affects the cell cycle by also negatively regulating the MAPK pathway via cyclin D. Decreased PTEN expression is correlated with prostate cancer progression. Over-expression of AR and upregulation of AR transcriptional activity are often observed in the later stages of prostate cancer. Recent studies indicate that PTEN regulates AR activity and stability. However, the mechanism of how AR regulates PTEN has never been studied. Furthermore, resveratrol, a phytoalexin enriched in red grapes, strawberries and peanuts, has been shown to inhibit AR transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells. In this study, we use prostate cancer cell lines to test the hypothesis that resveratrol inhibits cellular proliferation in both AR-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We show that resveratrol inhibits AR transcriptional activity in both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells. Additionally, resveratrol stimulates PTEN expression through AR inhibition. In contrast, resveratrol directly binds epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) rapidly inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation, resulting in decreased AKT phosphorylation, in an AR-independent manner. Thus, resveratrol may act as potential adjunctive treatment for late-stage hormone refractory prostate cancer. More importantly, for the first time, our study demonstrates the mechanism by which AR regulates PTEN expression at the transcription level, indicating the direct link between a nuclear receptor and the PI3K/AKT pathway.""","""['Yu Wang', 'Todd Romigh', 'Xin He', 'Mohammed S Orloff', 'Robert H Silverman', 'Warren D Heston', 'Charis Eng']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['Liposome encapsulation of curcumin and resveratrol in combination reduces prostate cancer incidence in PTEN knockout mice.', 'Conditional expression of PTEN alters the androgen responsiveness of prostate cancer cells.', 'Decorin suppresses prostate tumor growth through inhibition of epidermal growth factor and androgen receptor pathways.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Dietary stilbenes as modulators of specific miRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Small Molecule Compounds of Natural Origin Target Cellular Receptors to Inhibit Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Nanostructured Lipid Carriers Deliver Resveratrol, Restoring Attenuated Dilation in Small Coronary Arteries, via the AMPK Pathway.', 'Prostate Apoptotic Induction and NFκB Suppression by Dammarolic Acid: Mechanistic Insight into Onco-Therapeutic Action of an Aglycone Asiaticoside.', 'Exploring the Biological Activity and Mechanism of Xenoestrogens and Phytoestrogens in Cancers: Emerging Methods and Concepts.']"""

Moreover, when high specificity is a prerequisite, as in some medical diagnostics, pAUC is preferable. In this paper, we propose a wrapper-type algorithm to select the best linear combination of markers that has high sensitivity within a confined specificity range. The markers selected by the proposed algorithm are different from those selected by AUC-based algorithms and therefore provide different information for further studies. Most notably, for example, within the given range of specificity, the markers selected by the proposed algorithm always have higher individual sensitivities than those selected by other AUC-based methods. This characteristic makes the proposed method a good addition to existing methods. Without assuming the underlying distributions of markers, we prove that the pAUC obtained with the proposed algorithm is a strongly consistent estimate of the true pAUC and then illustrate its performance with numerical studies using synthesized data and 2 real examples. The results are compared with those obtained by its AUC-based counterpart.

Since VEGF and their receptors are expressed by tumour cells, we hypothesised that Bvz, in addition to its impact on neo-vascularisation, could have an impact on tumour cells and enhance the DXL activity. Hence, we studied the effect of DXL and Bvz on metastatic breast (MDA MB-231) and prostate (PC3) cancer cells lines. Bvz alone did not decrease cell proliferation but in combination with DXL, Bvz enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of DXL. Other anti-angiogenic factors Sunitinib, Sorafenib and Gefitinib enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of DXL. qPCR experiments showed that DXL significantly increased the VEGF and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) mRNA levels. Activation of VEGF and VEGF-R2 promoters demonstrated that enhanced mRNA levels are partly due to transcriptional activation. ELISA assays showed that DXL induced accumulation of cytoplasmic VEGF but decreased extracellular levels by 39% (MDA) and 48% (PC3). Cell surface localisation of VEGF-R2 was increased by DXL alone, but decreased after combined treatment of DXL plus Bvz. Abnormal expression of VEGF-R2 was also shown on breast and prostate tumour samples reinforcing the results obtained on cellular models. In conclusion, DXL and Bvz in combination decreased extracellular VEGF and VEGF-R2 levels at the plasma membrane thereby blocking an important growth/survival loop.

In order to examine this, we investigated whether genetic variants that are associated with circulating CRP concentrations are associated with cancer risk.  Methods:   We pooled data from three population-based prospective Finnish studies: FINRISK 1992 (n = 5289), FINRISK 1997 (n = 7160) and Health 2000 (n = 6299). Cancer cases were identified from cancer registrations. Thirteen CRP-associated SNPs, identified from genome-wide association studies, were genotyped. We examined the associations of the SNPs and cancer risk using Cox, probit and instrumented probit regression models.  Results:   Compared to common allele homozygotes, individuals carrying one or two variant T alleles at rs1892534 had 1.05-fold (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90, 1.23) and 1.2-fold (95% CI: 1.01, 1.42) increased overall cancer risk, respectively. Individuals with one or two variant A alleles at rs1169300 or rs2464196 had approximately 1.5- and 2-fold increased risk of lung cancer, respectively (p trend for both: 0.007). CRP SNPs were not associated with colorectal, prostate or breast cancer risk nor was CRP-associated with the probability of developing cancer in the instrumented probit analyses.  Conclusions:   We found some evidence for an association of a small number of CRP-associated SNPs with the overall cancer risk and lung cancer risk. Our instrumental variable analyses provided no clear evidence for a causal association of CRP and cancer.

We explored consultation and prescribing behaviour for depression and anxiety amongst cancer survivors in British primary health care.  Methods:   This study uses data on 26,213 survivors of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer at least 5 years post-diagnosis, matched to four controls without cancer, from the UK General Practice Research Database. We compared consultations for depression and anxiety, and prescribing for anti-depressants and anxiolytics between cancer survivors and controls.  Results:   Multivariate, matched regression models showed no difference in consulting for depression or anxiety between any cancer survivors and matched controls. However, breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.22) and prostate cancer survivors (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.47) were more likely to receive a prescription for an antidepressant. Breast cancer survivors (IRR 2.49, 95% CI 1.82-3.42) and prostate cancer survivors (IRR 2.84, 95% CI 1.94-4.17) who died received significantly more antidepressants than controls who died.

However, breast cancer survivors nearing the end of life received a greater number of anxiolytic prescriptions compared to controls (IRR 1.84, 95% CI 1.36-2.49).  Conclusions:   In this cohort of cancer survivors, there were no differences in consultation behaviour for depression and anxiety compared to controls.

Materials and methods:   A total of 198 patients in whom prostate cancer was suspected were randomly assigned to undergo 10-core prostate biopsy with (71) or without (74) periprostatic nerve block. The 53 men with a history of negative prostate biopsy underwent 20-core saturation prostate biopsy with periprostatic nerve block. The International Prostate Symptom Score and International Index of Erectile Function were completed before, and 1, 4 and 12 weeks after biopsy to measure changes in voiding and erectile function, and quality of life. Upon prostate cancer diagnosis patients were excluded from further analysis.  Results:   The International Prostate Symptom Score was significantly increased in all patients at week 1, which persisted at weeks 4 and 12 after saturation biopsy (p = 0.007 and 0.035, respectively). After 10-core prostate biopsy with periprostatic nerve block patients had a higher International Prostate Symptom Score at weeks 4 and 12 but this was not statistically significant (p >0.05). Quality of life was significantly affected at all times after saturation prostate biopsy (p = 0.001, 0.003 and 0.010, respectively). International Index of Erectile Function scores decreased significantly in all groups at week 1 (p <0.05). The decrease persisted at week 4 in each 10-core prostate biopsy group.  Conclusions:   Prostate biopsy causes impaired voiding. Saturation prostate biopsy and periprostatic nerve block seem to have a lasting impact on voiding function. Erectile function is transiently affected by prostate biopsy regardless of periprostatic nerve block and the number of cores.

Stromal cells aid tumor cell growth by producing cytokines as well as by modifying the environment surrounding the tumor through modulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) are biologically active components of the ECM which can be altered in the stroma surrounding tumors. The influence tumor cells have on stromal cells has been well elucidated. However, little is understood about the effect metastatic cancer cells have on the cell biology and behavior of the local stromal cells. Our data reveal a significant down-regulation in the expression of ECM components such as collagens I, II, III, and IV, and the SLRPs, decorin, biglycan, lumican, and fibromodulin in stromal cells when grown in the presence of two metastatic prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145. Interestingly, TGF-β down-regulation was observed in stromal cells, as well as actin depolymerization and increased vimentin and α5β1 integrin expression. MT1-MMP expression was upregulated and localized in stromal cell protrusions which extended into the ECM. Moreover, enhanced stromal cell migration was observed after cross-talk with metastatic prostate tumor cells. Xenografting metastatic prostate cancer cells together with ""activated"" stromal cells led to increased tumorigenicity of the prostate cancer cells.

Material and methods:   All cancers from the period 1995-2006 were studied in four cohorts of three-year incident cases from 1995 to 2006 followed to death or to the end of 2008. Age-standardised one-, three- and five-year relative survival and excess mortality were computed.  Results:   The improved one- and three-year survival was confirmed. The five-year survival increased from 38% in 1995-1997 to 48% in 2004-2006 for men, but a five percentage point increase is owed to the incidence increase of prostate cancer without changed mortality. In women the increase in survival was from 50% to 55%, i.e. a five percentage point increase. Improved five-year survival was seen for cancers of the oesophagus, colon and rectum, lung, and for haematological cancers; for women, also pancreas, ovary, brain and melanoma, and for men prostate cancer survival improved.  Discussion:   The improved cancer survival was confirmed and it was also observed at the five-year follow-up. The excess mortality is largely present during the first year of follow-up and is a useful indicator of whether changes in diagnosis and care lead to the desired outcome. Overall survival should be interpreted in the context of major changes in recorded incidence due to the introduction of new diagnostic tools and biomarkers such as prostate-specific antigen, as such measures do not necessarily change mortality.

Concern regarding functional outcomes in patients prompted the development of nerve sparing to improve recovery of erectile function.  Aim:   To assess if a cumulative nerve damage grading system is a more precise predictor of recovery of erectile function as compared to the current ""all-or-none"" grading system.  Methods:   Baseline demographic, medical history, and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-erectile function domain (EFD) scores were collected. At the time of RP, patients were assigned a nerve sparing score (NSS) by their surgeon for each neurovascular bundle (left and right) to assess the quality of intraoperative nerve sparing (1-complete preservation, 4-complete resection). Patients completed IIEF questionnaires at 24 months after RP.  Main outcome measures:   Group comparisons and multiple regression analyses were used to test the association between the NSS and IIEF-EFD scores for patients with preoperative EFD scores ≥ 24.  Results:   A total of 173 patients were included in this analysis. Mean age for patients was 59, and 62% of patients had at least one comorbidity. Baseline EFD scores were comparable between all NSS assignments. At 24 months, EFD scores were reduced by 7.2, 11.6, 13.9, and 15.4 points for patients with NSS grades of 2, 3, 4, and 5-8, respectively (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated lower NSS predicted recovery of erectile function at 24 months (P = 0.001), as did age (P = 0.001) and baseline EFD score (P = 0.02).  Conclusion:   Our data support the adoption of a subjectively assigned NSS to more precisely predict erectile function outcomes and suggest that even minor nerve trauma significantly impairs the recovery of erectile function after procedures classically regarded as having achieved bilateral nerve sparing.

Under the hypothesis that potential disease-related genes should be near the seed genes in the network and only the seed genes that are located in the same module with the candidate genes will contribute to disease genes prediction, three modularized candidate disease gene prioritization algorithms (MCDGPAs) are proposed to identify disease-related genes. MCDGPA is divided into three steps: module partition, genes prioritization in each disease-associated module, and rank fusion for the global ranking. When applied to the prostate cancer and breast cancer network, MCDGPA significantly improves previous algorithms in terms of cross-validation and disease-related genes prediction.

The differentially expressed genes (>twofold change; P < 0.05) were clustered and their ontological annotations evaluated. In PC3 cells genes regulating immune and stress response, cell cycle and apoptosis were significantly up-regulated by multifractionated radiation compared to single-dose radiation. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the differentially expressed genes revealed that immune response and cardiovascular genes were in the top functional category in PC3 cells and cell-to-cell signaling in DU145 cells.

Interestingly, during the course of these studies, we found ARM-Ps to exhibit extraordinarily high potencies toward PSMA, compared to previously reported inhibitors. Here, we report in-depth biochemical, crystallographic, and computational investigations which elucidate the origin of the observed affinity enhancement. These studies reveal a previously unreported arene-binding site on PSMA, which we believe participates in an aromatic stacking interaction with ARMs. Although this site is composed of only a few amino acid residues, it drastically enhances small molecule binding affinity.

Not only does it cause intractable pain and other clinical problems such as fracture after trivial injury, it also signifies that the malignant process is incurable. Since life expectancy of metastasised cancer patients has improved due to advanced oncological treatment but is still limited, appropriate surgical intervention has increased.  Method:   This is a retrospective control study of 21 patients who underwent cemented intramedullary nailing for pathological fractures in the humeral shaft between 2005 and 2009 as compared to a historical control group of 19 patients that underwent locked intramedullary nailing for pathological fractures in the humeral shaft between 1999 and 2004. Four major outcomes were assessed, namely, pain relief, use of analgesics, recovery of function and rate of complication.  Results:   Patients treated with cemented intramedullary nailing had better pain relief, less use of analgesics and better functional restoration immediately after surgical procedure when compared to the patients without cement fixing. The rate of complication did not differ between these two groups.  Conclusion:   Since surgery for metastases does not prolong life but improves the quality of life, the aim towards a short postoperative rehabilitation time is recommended. Cement fixation gives immediate stabilisation to the fracture site and thus allows less pain but full range of motion from the first postoperative day.""","""['Minna Laitinen', 'Jyrki Nieminen', 'Toni-Karri Pakarinen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Arch Orthop Trauma Surg""","""['The invisible nail: a technique report of treatment of a pathological humerus fracture with a radiolucent intramedullary nail.', 'Impending and actual pathological fractures in patients with bone metastases of the long bones.

We have recently reported that 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) suppresses the ability of TGF-β to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of prostatic epithelial cells and provided evidence that such suppression was fueled by transcriptional down-regulation of TGF-β receptor II (ΤβRII). We now show that androgen receptor (AR) activated by DHT suppresses the TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Sma- and Mad-related protein (Smad)3 in LNCaP cells overexpressing TβRII under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter, which is not regulated by DHT, suggesting that transcriptional repression of TβRII alone does not fully account for the impact of DHT on TGF-β responses. Instead, we demonstrate that such suppression occurs through loss of total Smad3, resulting from transcriptional suppression of Smad3. We provide evidence that DHT down-regulates the promoter activity of Smad3 in various prostate cancer cell lines, including NRP-154+AR, DU145+AR, LNCaP, and VCaP, at least partly through androgen-dependent inactivation of Sp1. Moreover, we show that overexpression of Smad3 reverses the ability of DHT to protect against TGF-β-induced apoptosis in NRP-154+AR, supporting our model that loss of Smad3 by DHT is involved in the protection against TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Together, these findings suggest that deregulated/enhanced expression and activation of AR in prostate carcinomas may intercept the tumor suppressor function of TGF-β through transcriptional suppression of Smad3, thereby providing new mechanistic insight into the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Kyung Song', 'Hui Wang', 'Tracy L Krebs', 'Bingcheng Wang', 'Thomas J Kelley', 'David Danielpour']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['The androgen receptor represses transforming growth factor-beta signaling through interaction with Smad3.', 'TGF-beta signaling and androgen receptor status determine apoptotic cross-talk in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgenic control of transforming growth factor-beta signaling in prostate epithelial cells through transcriptional suppression of transforming growth factor-beta receptor II.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Growth Suppression of HPr-1AR and PC3-Lenti-AR Prostate Epithelial Cells.', 'Down-regulation of transforming growth factor beta receptors by androgen in ovarian cancer cells.', 'SMAD3 promotes expression and activity of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Cell Plasticity and Prostate Cancer: The Role of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Tumor Progression, Invasion, Metastasis and Cancer Therapy Resistance.', 'Effects of miR-129-3p on biological functions of prostate cancer cells through targeted regulation of Smad3.', 'TGFB1-Mediated Gliosis in Multiple Sclerosis Spinal Cords Is Favored by the Regionalized Expression of HOXA5 and the Age-Dependent Decline in Androgen Receptor Ligands.', 'Unanswered Questions Regarding Sex and BMP/TGF-β Signaling.']"""

The mechanisms of the antiproliferative effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 have yet to be fully elucidated but are known to require the vitamin D receptor. We previously developed a 1,25-(OH)2D3-resistant derivative of the human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, which retains active vitamin D receptors but is not growth inhibited by 1,25-(OH)2D3. Gene expression profiling revealed two novel 1,25-(OH)2D3-inducible genes, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene gamma (GADD45γ) and mitogen induced gene 6 (MIG6), in LNCaP but not in 1,25-(OH)2D3-resistant cells. GADD45γ up-regulation was associated with growth inhibition by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in human prostate cancer cells. Ectopic expression of GADD45γ in either LNCaP or ALVA31 cells resulted in G1 accumulation and inhibition of proliferation equal to or greater than that caused by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. In contrast, ectopic expression of MIG6 had only minimal effects on cell cycle distribution and proliferation. Whereas GADD45γ has been shown to be induced by androgens in prostate cancer cells, up-regulation of GADD45γ by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was not dependent on androgen receptor signaling, further refuting a requirement for androgens/androgen receptor in vitamin D-mediated growth inhibition. These data introduce two novel 1,25-(OH)2D3-regulated genes and establish GADD45γ as a growth-inhibitory protein in prostate cancer. Furthermore, the induction of GADD45γ gene expression by 1,25-(OH)2D3 may mark therapeutic response in prostate cancer.""","""['Omar Flores', 'Kerry L Burnstein']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Analysis of vitamin D-regulated gene expression in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells using cDNA microarrays.', 'CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta: a molecular target of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in androgen-responsive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', '1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits prostate cancer cell growth by androgen-dependent and androgen-independent mechanisms.', 'The role of vitamin D in prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma?', 'A Mouse Brain-based Multi-omics Integrative Approach Reveals Potential Blood Biomarkers for Ischemic Stroke.', 'Vitamin D in Triple-Negative and BRCA1-Deficient Breast Cancer-Implications for Pathogenesis and Therapy.', 'GSK-J4-Mediated Transcriptomic Alterations in Differentiating Embryoid Bodies.', 'Mechanism of androgen receptor corepression by CKβBP2/CRIF1, a multifunctional transcription factor coregulator expressed in prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin d, sunlight and prostate cancer risk.']"""

We suggest that cells are able to regulate the D/H ratio and the changes in the D/H ratio can trigger certain molecular mechanisms having a key role in cell cycle regulation. We suppose that not the shift in the intracellular pH, but the concomitant increase in the D/H ratio is the real trigger for the cells to enter into S phase.

Demographic, preoperative clinical data, and eMRI anatomic measurements, including calculated prostate volume (PV) and the pelvic cavity index (PCI), were recorded. PCI is the pelvic inlet multiplied by the interspinous distance and divided by the pelvic depth; PCI estimates the robotic working space. Correlative and multiple regression analyses of clinical and pelvimetric data were performed for prediction of estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time (OT), positive surgical margin (PSM), and transfusion rate as surrogates of surgical difficulty.  Results:   Prostatic transverse diameter, PV, and the PV-to-PCI ratio were significantly correlated with both OT and EBL (P < .05). Body mass index also correlated with EBL (P < .05). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the PV-to-PCI ratio significantly predicts OT and EBL. No factor significantly predicted PSM status or transfusion rate on regression analysis. Analysis within the PSM group revealed that those with an apical PSM had statistically narrower and deeper pelvises.  Conclusions:   Patients with larger prostates and with narrow, deep pelvises are predicted to have a more difficult RALP. The PV-to-PCI ratio statistically predicts lengthier and bloodier procedures.

For example, breast, prostate and lung cancers lack intrinsic pigmentation and thus do not generate photoacoustic waves. In order to induce optical contrast in non-pigmented cancer cells, we have attached gold nanoparticles to a prostate cancer cell line. This optical absorption will enable us to detect such cells in a photoacoustic flowmeter designed to find circulating tumor cells in blood samples.

The relation among abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), waist circumference (WC), and BMI was compared with clinical and pathologic findings in patients treated with radiotherapy for localized PC.  Methods:   VAT, SAT, WC (all measured by planning abdominopelvic computed tomography scan) and BMI were compared with clinical and pathologic factors using univariate analyses. Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate whether obesity measures significantly predicted risk for secondary malignancies.  Results:   Of 276 analyzed patients, 80 (29%) were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ). Median BMI at baseline was 27.6 kg/m(2) (interquartile range [IQR], 25.1-30.5 kg/m(2) ). Increased SAT and VAT were associated with a higher National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) PC risk group (P = .0001 and .008, respectively). Greater SAT was associated with a higher Gleason score (GS) (P = .030). Younger age at diagnosis was significantly correlated with higher SAT and BMI, whereas increased prostate size was found in patients with higher BMI, WC, SAT, and VAT. At a median follow-up of 42.3 months (IQR, 32.3-59.9 months), 15 secondary malignancies were observed. On multivariate analysis, VAT was a significant predictor for secondary cancers (adjusted hazards ratio, 1.014; P = .0001).  Conclusions:   Measurements of greater abdominal adiposity were strongly associated with adverse pathologic features in patients with localized PC, including higher GS and NCCN PC risk groups.

They play important roles in numerous cellular processes, including development, proliferation, and apoptosis. Currently, it is believed that miRNAs elicit their effect by silencing the expression of target genes. In this study, the authors demonstrated that miRNA-205 (miR-205) induced the expression the interleukin (IL) tumor suppressor genes IL24 and IL32 by targeting specific sites in their promoters.  Methods:   The methods used in this study included transfection of small RNAs; quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; in situ hybridization; fluorescence-labeled in situ hybridization; cell cycle, apoptosis, cell viability, migratory, clonability, and invasion assays; immunoblotting; and luciferase reporter, nuclear run-on, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.  Results:   The results revealed that miR-205 was silenced in prostate cancer. Its re-expression induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. It also impaired cell growth, migration, clonability, and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. Micro-RNA-205 induced the expression of tumor suppressor genes IL24 and IL32 at both the messenger RNA and protein levels. The induction of in vitro transcription and enrichment of markers for transcriptionally active promoters in the IL24 and IL32 genes was observed in response to miR-205.  Conclusions:   In this study, a new function for miR-205 was identified that specifically activated tumor suppressor genes by targeting specific sites in their promoters. These results corroborate a newly identified function that miRNAs have in regulating gene expression at the transcriptional level. The specific activation of tumor suppressor genes (eg, IL24, IL32) or other dysregulated genes by miRNA may contribute to a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Shahana Majid', 'Altaf A Dar', 'Sharanjot Saini', 'Soichiro Yamamura', 'Hiroshi Hirata', 'Yuichiro Tanaka', 'Guoren Deng', 'Rajvir Dahiya']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Epigenetic disruption of miR-130a promotes prostate cancer by targeting SEC23B and DEPDC1.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-205 directly regulates the tumor suppressor, interleukin-24, in human KB oral cancer cells.', 'Tumor Suppressor microRNAs in Gastrointestinal Cancers: A Mini-Review.', 'MicroRNA mediated therapeutic effects of natural agents in prostate cancer.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', 'Hsa-miR-422a Originated from Short Interspersed Nuclear Element Increases ARID5B Expression by Collaborating with NF-E2.', 'Roles of the Core Components of the Mammalian miRISC in Chromatin Biology.', 'MicroRNA Cues from Nature: A Roadmap to Decipher and Combat Challenges in Human Health and Disease?', 'MicroRNAs as Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Therapeutic Targeting of Ovarian Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Two cohorts were compared: one was a group with young-onset PrCa, tested for germline BRCA2 mutations (6 of 263 cases had a germline BRAC2 mutation), and the second was a validation set consisting of a clinical set from Manchester of known BRCA2 mutuation carriers (15 cases) with PrCa. Survival data were compared with a control series of patients in a single clinic as determined by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Loss of heterozygosity was tested for in the DNA of tumour tissue of the young-onset group by typing four microsatellite markers that flanked the BRCA2 gene, followed by sequencing.  Results:   Median survival of all PrCa cases with a germline BRCA2 mutation was shorter at 4.8 years than was survival in controls at 8.5 years (P=0.002). Loss of heterozygosity was found in the majority of tumours of BRCA2 mutation carriers. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the poorer survival of PrCa in BRCA2 mutation carriers is associated with the germline BRCA2 mutation per se.

Much attention has been focused on exploring their clinical application as a genetic tumor marker for the diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy. Although several studies have been done, the clinical utility of TMPRSS2 genetic alterations as biomarkers for prostate carcinoma remains indeterminate. In this study, we examined adenocarcinomas, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and normal epithelium of the prostate retrieved from radical prostatectomy specimens to determine the frequency, specificity, tissue heterogeneity, and prognostic value of TMPRSS2 genetic alterations using a direct-labeled TMPRSS2 dual-color break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe cocktail designed to detect all known TMPRSS2-associated deletions or translocations. Seventy-one patients (161 samples) with normal prostate tissue, 60 patients (153 samples) with PIN, and 61 patients (142 samples) with carcinoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays were tested. None of the 161 normal prostate samples showed TMPRSS2 translocation or deletion. Sixty-two percent patients of prostate carcinomas demonstrated TMPRSS2 gene alterations, including 39% with translocation, 16% with deletion, and 7% with a mixed pattern. Tissue heterogeneity for TMPRSS2 gene alterations was identified in 28% of prostate carcinomas. No difference in the frequency of TMPRSS2 gene alterations was found between Gleason 6 and 7 tumors. Seventeen percent of PIN had TMPRSS2 gene alterations and showed the same FISH patterns as in the carcinomas from respective prostatectomy specimens. The TMPRSS2 dual-color break-apart FISH probe cocktail provides a simple and reliable method for the detection of TMPRSS2-related genetic alterations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. TMPRSS2 genetic alterations detectable by this method are strictly restricted in prostate neoplasia, and can be identified in the majority of prostate carcinomas.

Here, we show that PN-1 is a substrate for MMP-9 and establish a link between PN-1 degradation by MMP-9 and regulation of invasion. PN-1 levels increased in prostate carcinoma cells after downregulation of MMP-9 and in tissues of MMP-9-deficient mice, consistent with PN-1 degradation by MMP-9. We identified three MMP-9 cleavage sites in PN-1 and showed that mutations in those sites made PN-1 more resistant to MMP-9. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is inhibited by PN-1. MMP-9 augmented uPA activity in the medium of PC3-ML cells by degrading PN-1. Prostate cancer cells, overexpressing PN-1 or treated with MMP-9 shRNA, had reduced cell invasion in Matrigel. PN-1 siRNA restored uPA activity and the invasive capacity. PN-1 mutated in the serpin inhibitory domain, the reactive center loop, failed to inhibit uPA and to reduce Matrigel invasion.

EGFR activation has been implicated in the transition of prostate cancer from androgen dependence to independence. Therefore, inhibition of EGFR may effectively suppress prostate cancer growth and progression. The goal of this study was to determine whether the natural compound psoralidin alters EGFR-mediated signaling resulting in the inhibition of prostate cancer growth. Results suggest that inhibition of EGFR alone (by serum deprivation) fails to induce stress-mediated protein kinases (SAPK), namely, Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase/c-Jun signaling, in androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) cells. Treatment with psoralidin, however, inhibited both constitutive and EGF-induced EGFR activation and simultaneously triggered SAPK signaling, resulting in the induction of apoptosis in AIPC cells. In addition, psoralidin downregulated EGFR-regulated MAPK signaling and inhibited cell proliferation in AIPC cells. Oral administration of psoralidin effectively suppressed PC-3 xenograft tumors in nude mice. Compared with control tumors, inhibition of pEGFR expression and an increase in the phosphorylation, activation, and nuclear translocation of c-Jun were observed in psoralidin-treated tumor sections.

In view of this notion, agents that target estrogens, in addition to androgens, may be a novel approach for PCa chemoprevention and treatment. Thus, the identification and development of nontoxic dietary agents capable of disrupting androgen receptor (AR) in addition to estrogen receptor (ER) could be extremely useful in the management of PCa. Through molecular modeling, we found that carnosol, a dietary diterpene, fits within the ligand-binding domain of both AR and ER-alpha. Using a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, we found that carnosol interacts with both AR and ER-alpha and additional experiments confirmed that it functions as a receptor antagonist with no agonist effects. LNCaP, 22Rv1, and MCF7 cells treated with carnosol (20-40 mumol/L) showed decreased protein expression of AR and ER-alpha. Oral administration of carnosol at 30 mg/kg 5 days weekly for 28 days to 22Rv1 PCa xenografted mice suppressed tumor growth by 36% (P = 0.028) and was associated with a decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen by 26% (P = 0.0042).

We hypothesized that the risk of prostate cancer on biopsy for a given PSA level is affected by identifiable characteristics of the cohort under study.  Experimental design:   We used data from five European and three U.S. cohorts of men undergoing biopsy for prostate cancer; six were population-based studies and two were clinical cohorts. The association between PSA and prostate cancer was calculated separately for each cohort using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing.  Results:   The final data set included 25,772 biopsies and 8,503 cancers. There were gross disparities between cohorts with respect to both the prostate cancer risk at a given PSA level and the shape of the risk curve. These disparities were associated with identifiable differences between cohorts: for a given PSA level, a greater number of biopsy cores increased the risk of cancer (odds ratio for >6- versus 6-core biopsy, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.54; P < 0.0005); recent screening led to a smaller increase in risk per unit change in PSA (P = 0.001 for interaction term) and U.S. cohorts had higher risk than the European cohorts (2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.99-2.30; P < 0.0005).  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that the relationship between PSA and risk of a positive prostate biopsy varies, both in terms of the probability of prostate cancer at a given PSA value and the shape of the risk curve.

Although regulation of these UGT genes by various endogenous and exogenous ligands, including steroid hormones and bile acids, is well documented, the mechanisms controlling their basal gene expression are poorly understood. We recently reported that Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) regulates the basal expression of the UGT2B17 gene in prostate cancer cells. In this study, we show that FOXA1 also regulates basal expression of the UGT2B15 gene in the prostate cell line LNCaP (lymph node carcinoma of the prostate). FOXA1 binds to a site -208 to -217 base pairs relative to the UGT2B15 translation start site, as shown by electromobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Mutation of this site prevents binding and substantially decreases basal UGT2B15 promoter activity. Silencing of FOXA1 expression by small interfering RNA significantly reduced UGT2B15 transcript levels, further confirming a crucial role of FOXA1 in controlling UGT2B15 gene expression. Because local inactivation of active androgens by UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 has been shown to be a major determinant of androgen response and signaling activity, regulation of the UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 genes by FOXA1 may have an important role in the maintenance of androgen homeostasis within prostate cancer cells.""","""['Dong Gui Hu', 'Peter I Mackenzie']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Drug Metab Dispos""","""['A novel polymorphism in a forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) binding site of the human UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2B17 gene modulates promoter activity and is associated with altered levels of circulating androstane-3α,17β-diol glucuronide.', 'Multiple roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)2B15 and UGT2B17 enzymes in androgen metabolism and prostate cancer evolution.', 'Regulation of Human UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 by miR-376c in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Androgen and Estrogen Receptors in Breast Cancer Coregulate Human UDP-Glucuronosyltransferases 2B15 and 2B17.', 'Characterization and regulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in steroid target tissues.', 'FOXA1 Promotes Cell Proliferation and Suppresses Apoptosis in HCC by Directly Regulating miR-212-3p/FOXA1/AGR2 Signaling Pathway.', 'Fork head transcription factor is required for ovarian mature in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål).']"""

Methods:   We examined the association between rs10993994 genotype and MSP levels in a sample of 500 prostate cancer-free men from four racial/ethnic populations in the Multiethnic Cohort (European Americans, African Americans, Latinos, and Japanese Americans). Generalized linear models were used to estimate the association between rs10993994 genotype and MSP levels.  Results:   We observed robust associations between rs10994994 genotype and MSP levels in each racial/ethnic population (all P < 10(-8)), with carriers of the C allele having lower geometric mean MSP levels (ng/mL; CC/CT/TT genotypes: European Americans, 28.8/20.9/10.0; African Americans, 29.0/21.9/10.9; Latinos, 29.2/17.1/8.3; and Japanese Americans, 25.8/16.4/6.7). We estimated the variant accounts for 30% to 50% of the variation in MSP levels in each population. We also observed significant differences in MSP levels between populations (P = 3.5 × 10(-6)), with MSP levels observed to be highest in African Americans and lowest in Japanese Americans.

The present study determined the effect of PI3K inhibition on the clonogenic survival of human cancer cells following exposure to various chemotherapeutic agents. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or Compound 15e resulted in increased survival of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells after exposure to doxorubicin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, and vincristine. Increased survival following PI3K inhibition was also observed in DU-145 prostate, HCT-116 colon and A-549 lung carcinoma cell lines exposed to doxorubicin. Increased cell survival mediated by LY294002 was correlated with a decrease in cell proliferation, which was linked to an increase in the proportion of cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Inhibition of PI3K signaling also resulted in higher levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1); and knockdown of p27(kip1) with siRNA attenuated resistance to doxorubicin in cells treated with LY294002. Incubation in the presence of LY294002 after exposure to doxorubicin resulted in decreased cell survival. These findings provide evidence that PI3K inhibition leads to chemoresistance in human cancer cells by causing a delay in cell cycle; however, the timing of PI3K inhibition (either before or after exposure to anti-cancer agents) may be a critical determinant of chemosensitivity.""","""['Gail T McDonald', 'Richard Sullivan', 'Geneviève C Paré', 'Charles H Graham']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases inhibitor LY294002 potentiates the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide in a panel of cancer cell lines.', 'Combined inhibition of PI3K and MEK has synergistic inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells.', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 suppresses proliferation and sensitizes doxorubicin chemotherapy in bladder cancer cells.', 'Advances in the researches on the biological activities and inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.', 'Treating cancer with phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitors: increasing efficacy and overcoming resistance.', 'Personalised Medicine for Colorectal Cancer Using Mechanism-Based Machine Learning Models.', 'PI3K activation promotes resistance to eribulin in HER2-negative breast cancer.', 'Signaling pathways involved in colorectal cancer progression.', 'Codelivery of Genistein and miRNA-29b to A549 Cells Using Aptamer-Hybrid Nanoparticle Bioconjugates.', 'Stem cell death and survival in heart regeneration and repair.']"""

We reviewed a large RALP database to determine if clinical outcomes are related to BMI.  Methods:   The records of patients who underwent a RALP from 2003-2009 were reviewed. BMI stratifications were concordant with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) standards: > or = 30, > or = 25 and < 30, and < 25 were classified as obese, overweight, and normal weight, respectively. Baseline, perioperative, histopathologic, and functional outcome data were collected.  Results:   A total of 1420 patients were identified and BMI information was available for 1112 patients. Median BMI in the three strata was 23.5 (n = 270), 27.3 (n = 600), and 32.1 (n = 242). There were no significant differences in preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA), clinical staging, and preoperative Gleason scores. Operating time was 6 minutes longer in the obese (p < 0.001) and prostate weight was 8 g greater (p < 0.001). Other perioperative factors were similar, including: EBL, pathologic stage and Gleason score and rates of positive surgical margins. The overall incidence of postoperative complications was similar between the three groups. Biochemical recurrence rates were similar among all patients, although there was a trend toward increased recurrence in the obese (p = 0.09). Recovery of erectile function and continence was similar regardless of BMI.  Conclusions:   RALP is an effective approach to prostatectomy in obese patients as perioperative and functional outcomes are almost identical across BMI strata.

Continuous testosterone suppression is essential to treatment efficacy. Recently a 1 year depot compound, histrelin, (VANTAS: Orion Pharmaceuticals, Finland; Endo Pharmaceuticals, USA), a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog, was approved for hormone therapy of prostate cancer. In the present study the therapeutic efficacy of this compound was investigated, in addition to its impact on testosterone values and velocity as well as PSA.  Method:   One hundred thirty-one patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer and normal testosterone levels were prospectively evaluated over 1 year. Androgen deprivation therapy was performed using a once yearly implant of the GnRH agonist histrelin. Testosterone and PSA levels, and histrelin serum profile were measured prospectively every month for 1 year. In addition, patients were stratified according to their PSA results and D'Amico risk profile.  Results:   Testosterone suppression (testosterone < or = 50 ng/dL) was measured in all patients between weeks 4 and 52; 88% of patients had a continuous testosterone level under 20 ng/dL. The PSA level in the total population decreased significantly within the first 2 weeks compared with baseline, and after 52 weeks the median PSA level of the total population was 0.2 ng/mL. PSA responses were grouped into three typical therapeutic outcomes and correlated with the clinical risk distribution, and levels were lowered in all three risk groups.  Conclusion:   The GnRH agonist histrelin successfully suppressed testosterone over the entire study period. This effect was measured across a number of different clinical definitions of PSA response and clinical risk. The GnRH agonist therefore offers an effective therapy option in hormone treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Bob Djavan', 'Peter Schlegel', 'Georg Salomon', 'Elisabeth Eckersberger', 'Helen Sadri', 'Markus Graefen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Reversibility of androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Individual variation of hormonal recovery after cessation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy in men receiving long-term medical castration therapy for prostate cancer.', 'An implant releasing the gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone agonist histrelin maintains medical castration for up to 30 months in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy: past, present and future.', 'Testosterone surge: rationale for gonadotropin-releasing hormone blockers?', 'Therapies Targeted to Androgen Receptor Signaling Axis in Prostate Cancer: Progress, Challenges, and Hope.']"""

Methods and materials:   We analyzed data from 215 consecutive patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer who received permanent seed brachytherapy at our center. Erectile function at baseline (prior to brachytherapy) was assessed using the Mount Sinai Erectile Function Score (MSEFS).

Results:   Epstein-Barr virus DNA was detected in 56% (28/50) and 60% (6/10) of the bladder and UTUC patients, respectively. The EBV DNA could not be detected in the normal control group. By pooling the UTUC and bladder patients in stage Ta,T1, the high copy number in fixed genomic DNA amount (100 ng/20 µL) was correlated with the high grading in stage Ta,T1 urothelial carcinoma (P = 0.014).

'High-risk' was defined as ≥ one first degree or two second degree relatives with PCA, any African American (AA) man regardless of familial PCA, and men with BRCA1/2 mutations. Men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations or other indications for PCA underwent biopsy. Men were followed from time of study entry to PCA diagnosis.

However, the clinical utility of AA has been limited by relatively low potency and in vivo efficacy. This study reports that the metalloporphyrin, Mn(III) tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin(5+) (MnTMPyP), has a potent synergistic cytotoxic effect when combined with AA in a variety of cancer cell lines. In the presence of MnTMPyP, the concentration of AA required to inhibit cancer cell growth was markedly reduced. In vitro (cell-free) experiments demonstrated that AA alone enhanced the Fenton reaction that produces cytotoxic hydroxyl radical (HO(*)); however, this reaction was limited by the low rate by which AA generates H(2)O(2) (Fenton reaction substrate) from O(2). MnTMPyP catalyzed H(2)O(2) generation through the AA-facilitated Mn(II <--> III)TMPyP redox cycle and thereby markedly potentiated the Fenton reaction. Accordingly, MnTMPyP and AA resulted in increased cellular levels of H(2)O(2) and HO(*) in cancer cells, which mediate the synergistic cytotoxicity of this combined treatment. This effect was inhibited by cellular enzymes that metabolize H(2)O(2), such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase, suggesting that selective killing of cancer cells deficient in such enzymes can be achieved in vivo.""","""['Junqiang Tian', 'Donna M Peehl', 'Susan J Knox']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Anticancer therapeutic potential of Mn porphyrin/ascorbate system.', 'Antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects of a manganese porphyrin complex against CYP2E1-dependent toxicity.', 'Manganoporphyrins and ascorbate enhance gemcitabine cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer.', 'Enzymatic/nonenzymatic sources of oxyradicals and regulation of antioxidant defenses.', 'Free oxygen radiacals and kidney diseases--part I.', 'Calculated cell-specific intracellular hydrogen peroxide concentration: Relevance in cancer cell susceptibility during ascorbate therapy.', 'The Addition of Manganese Porphyrins during Radiation Inhibits Prostate Cancer Growth and Simultaneously Protects Normal Prostate Tissue from Radiation Damage.', 'Peroxiporin Expression Is an Important Factor for Cancer Cell Susceptibility to Therapeutic H2O2: Implications for Pharmacological Ascorbate Therapy.', 'Tumor cells have decreased ability to metabolize H2O2: Implications for pharmacological ascorbate in cancer therapy.', 'Anticancer therapeutic potential of Mn porphyrin/ascorbate system.']"""

Although lycopene might function as a prostate cancer chemoprevention agent, little is known about its effects at the cellular level. To define general changes induced by treatment of cells with lycopene, and to gain insights into the possible chemoprevention properties of lycopene, we investigated changes in protein expression after lycopene treatment in human LNCaP cells. The high throughput proteomics data were then visualized and analyzed by novel biological protein pathway modeling software. Differentially expressed proteins were identified, and the data were analyzed by protein pathway simulation software without need for specialized programming by importing pathway models from a number of sources or creating their own. One notable outcome was the identification of a group of upregulated proteins involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species. This finding suggests that a possible mechanism of lycopene chemoprevention is the stimulation of detoxification enzymes associated with the antioxidant response element.

The influence of the different planning techniques on the coverage of planning volume and sparing of organs at risk (OARs) was investigated.  Patients and methods:   Nine patients with localized prostate and nine patients with head and neck cancer were chosen for this study. Treatment planning was performed in Eclipse (Varian) and in Tomotherapy planning software. Treatment plans were compared according to target volume coverage and sparing OARs, as well as by conformity and homogeneity index.  Results:   For both investigated tumor sites, the dosimetric effects of leaf widths between 2.5 mm, 5 mm and 10 mm were shown to be small in regard to target coverage. Tomotherapy plans had better target coverage (higher minimum dose). For prostate cancer, better sparing of bladder and rectum was achieved with RapidArc and dIMRT plans. For head and neck cancer, best sparing of parotid glands was achieved in HT plans. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in sparing of OARs between the dIMRT plans with different leaf widths neither for prostate cancer nor for head and neck cancer.

This technique has also been applied during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP); however, contradictory results have been reported.  Objective:   We describe here a modified technique for PR of the rhabdosphincter during RARP and report its impact on early recovery of urinary continence and on cystographic leakage rates.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed 803 consecutive patients who underwent RARP by a single surgeon over a 12-mo period: 330 without performing PR and 473 with PR.  Surgical procedure:   The reconstruction was performed using two 6-in 3-0 Poliglecaprone sutures tied together. The free edge of the remaining Denonvillier's fascia was identified after prostatectomy and approximated to the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter and the posterior median raphe using one arm of the continuous suture. The second layer of the reconstruction was then performed with the other arm of the suture, approximating the posterior lip of the bladder neck and vesicoprostatic muscle to the posterior urethral edge.  Measurements:   Continence rates were assessed with a self-administrated, validated questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) at 1, 4, 12, and 24 wk after catheter removal. Continence was defined as the use of ""no absorbent pads."" Cystogram was performed in all patients on postoperative day 4 or 5 before catheter removal.  Results and limitations:   There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to patient age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen levels, prostate weight, American Urological Association symptom score, estimated blood loss, operative time, number of nerve-sparing procedures, and days with catheter. In the PR group, the continence rates at 1, 4, 12, and 24 wk postoperatively were 28.7%, 51.6%, 91.1%, and 97%, respectively; in the non-PR group, the continence rates were 22.7%, 42.7%, 91.8%, and 96.3%, respectively. The modified PR technique resulted in significantly higher continence rates at 1 and 4 wk after catheter removal (p = 0.048 and 0.016, respectively), although the continence rates at 12 and 24 wk were not significantly affected (p = 0.908 and p = 0.741, respectively). The median interval to recovery of continence was also statistically significantly shorter in the PR group (median: 4 wk; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.39-4.61) when compared to the non-PR group (median: 6 wk; 95% CI: 5.18-6.82; log-rank test, p=0.037). Finally, the incidence of cystographic leaks was lower in the PR group (0.4% vs 2.1%; p=0.036). Although the patients' baseline characteristics were similar between the groups, the patients were not preoperatively randomized and unknown confounding factors may have influenced the results.  Conclusions:   Our modified PR combines the benefits of early recovery of continence reported with the original PR technique with a reinforced watertight closure of the posterior anastomotic wall. Shorter interval to recovery of continence and lower incidence of cystographic leaks were demonstrated with our PR technique when compared to RARP with no reconstruction.""","""['Rafael F Coelho', 'Sanket Chauhan', 'Marcelo A Orvieto', 'Ananthakrishnan Sivaraman', 'Kenneth J Palmer', 'Geoff Coughlin', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Corrigendum re: ""Influence of Modified Posterior Reconstruction of the Rhabdosphincter on Early Recovery of Continence and Anastomotic Leakage Rates after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy"" Eur Urol 2011;59:72-80.', 'A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Total Anatomical Reconstruction During Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Implications on Early Recovery of Urinary Continence.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Early Catheter Removal after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Surgical Technique and Outcomes for the Aalst Technique (ECaRemA Study).', 'Posterior musculofascial reconstruction after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Urinary Continence Recovery after Robotic Radical Prostatectomy without Anterior or Posterior Reconstruction: Experience from a Tertiary Referral Center.', 'The Efficacy of Urinary Continence in Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy with Bladder-Prostatic Muscle Reconstruction and Bladder Neck Eversion Anastomosis.', 'The association between the parameters of uroflowmetry and lower urinary tract symptoms in prostate cancer patients after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Mucosal coaptation technique for early urinary continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a comparative exploratory study.', 'Nerve spare robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with amniotic membranes: medium term outcomes.']"""

The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the IMRT and VMAT plans was calculated for 3 model parameter sets. The delivery efficiency and time for the IMRT and VMAT plans was compared. The VMAT plans resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the rectal V25Gy parameter of 8.2% on average over the IMRT plans. For one of the NTCP parameter sets, the VMAT plans had a statistically significant lower rectal NTCP. These reductions in rectal dose were achieved using 18.6% fewer monitor units and a delivery time reduction of up to 69%.

Because > 97% of men with LRPC are likely to die of something other than prostate cancer, it is critical that patients give thought to whether early curative treatment is the only option at diagnosis.  Objective:   To identify a group of men with LRPC who may not require initial treatment and monitor them on our active surveillance (AS) protocol, to determine the percentage treated and the outcome and to analyze the quality-of-life data.  Design, setting, and participants:   We defined patients eligible for AS as Gleason ≤ 6, PSA ≤ 10, and two or fewer biopsy cores with ≤ 20% tumor in each core.  Measurements:   Kaplan Meier analysis was used to predict the 5-year treatment free survival. Logistic regression determined the predictors of treatment. Data on sexual function, continence, and outcome were obtained and analyzed.  Results and limitations:   The AS cohort consisted of 230 patients with a mean age of 63.4 yr; 86% remained on AS for a mean follow-up of 44 mo. Thirty-two of the 230 patients (14%) were treated for a mean follow-up of 33 mo. Twelve had a total prostatectomy (TP). The pathologic stage of these patients was similar to initially treated TP patients with LRPC. Fourteen underwent radiation therapy, and six underwent androgen-deprivation therapy. Fifty percent of patients had no tumor on the first rebiopsy, and only 5% of these patients were subsequently treated. PSA doubling time and clinical stage were not predictors of treatment. No patient progressed after treatment. Among the AS patients, 30% had incontinence, yet < 15% were bothered by it. As measured by the Sexual Health Inventory for Men, 49% of patients had, at a minimum, moderate (≤ 16) erectile dysfunction.  Conclusions:   If guidelines for AS are narrowly defined to include only patients with Gleason 6, tumor volume ≤ 20% in one or two biopsy cores, and PSA levels ≤ 10, few patients are likely to require treatment.

TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion was identified more frequently in patients with low Gleason grade (primary Gleason pattern ≤ 3 or sum of Gleason score ≤ 7, P = .015 and .027). Patients with large cribriform glands in Gleason pattern 4 harbored a rare TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene compared with patients without large cribriform glands (P = .027). The incidence of biochemical recurrence did not differ according to TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene status (P = .598).  Conclusions:   ERG gene aberration did not correlate with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancers in Korean patients. Lower Gleason grade demonstrated higher rates of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion compared with high-grade tumors, including those demonstrating a large cribriform glands pattern. Prostate cancer with large cribriform glands revealed rare TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.""","""['Kyoungbun Lee', 'Ji Youn Chae', 'Cheol Kwak', 'Ja Hyeon Ku', 'Kyung Chul Moon']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Urology""","""['TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion associated with lethal prostate cancer in a watchful waiting cohort.', 'Clinical implications of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion expression in patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Genome-wide linkage analysis of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in familial prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: the revolution of the fusion genes.', 'The discovery of common recurrent transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-erythroblastosis virus E26 transforming sequence (ETS) gene fusions in prostate cancer: significance and clinical implications.', 'Prevalence and clinical application of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in Asian prostate cancer patients: a large-sample study in Chinese people and a systematic review.', 'Status of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in prostate cancer patients from India: correlation with clinico-pathological details and TMPRSS2 Met160Val polymorphism.', 'Predictive significance of TMRPSS2-ERG fusion in prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Diverse Immunoprofile of Ductal Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate with an Emphasis on the Prognostic Factors.', 'Prostate cancer in Jordanian-Arab population: ERG status and relationship with clinicopathologic characteristics.']"""

Previous investigators have demonstrated the ability to use serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels to estimate PV in men without prostate cancer; however, the ability of additional clinical variables to further enhance PV estimation in these men remains unclear.  Methods:   We applied linear regression modeling to data from an 80% random sample (n = 366) of the baseline cohort from the Olmsted County Study of Urinary Symptoms and Health Status among Men (OCS) to develop an equation for estimating PV in men without prostate cancer. We then evaluated the predictive ability of this equation by comparing estimated and measured PV values in 3 additional validation sets of men.  Results:   The final linear regression model included PSA, age, and weight as independent predictors of PV. For prediction in baseline OCS men, the multiple correlation coefficients increased from 0.62(PSAalone) to 0.71(fullmodel). In addition, the area under the curve estimates from the receiver operating characteristic curves increased from 0.79(PSAalone) to 0.85(fullmodel) for predicting PV >30 mL.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that PV can be estimated with easily obtained clinical variables. Moreover, we demonstrate that age and weight can be added to PSA level to achieve greater accuracy in predicting PV. This methodology may prove useful for estimating PV in men in settings where costs and practicality preclude the use of imaging techniques.""","""['Debra J Jacobson', 'Jennifer L St Sauver', 'Alexander S Parker', 'Michaela E McGree', 'Aruna V Sarma', 'Cynthia J Girman', 'Michael M Lieber', 'Steven J Jacobsen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Serum prostate-specific antigen as a predictor of prostate volume in the community: the Krimpen study.', 'Prostate-specific antigen as an estimator of prostate volume in the management of patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Relationship between serum prostate-specific antigen and prostate volume in Korean men with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a multicentre study.', 'Correlation between serum prostate specific antigen level and prostate volume in a community-based cohort: large-scale screening of 35,223 Korean men.', 'Relationships between total/free prostate-specific antigen and prostate volume in Chinese men with biopsy-proven benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Low suspicion lesions on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging predict for the absence of high-risk prostate cancer.', 'A novel equation and nomogram including body weight for estimating prostate volumes in men with biopsy-proven benign prostatic hyperplasia.']"""

Given this lack of consensus, we sought to identify patterns in physician knowledge of and attitudes towards PSA screening and to determine how these patterns along with patient and provider demographics influence PSA screening practices.  Methods:   A self-administered questionnaire, which assessed provider's knowledge of prostate cancer, confidence in his/her knowledge, and PSA screening practices, was mailed to PCPs at an academic medical center. Frequencies of responses were summarized and 3 outcome variables (knowledge, confidence, and propensity to screen) were derived. Association of covariates with the outcome variables was determined using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   Eight-two (30.4%) physicians completed the survey; 98% identified African-American race as a prostate cancer risk factor, 42% identified digital rectal exam and PSA as the accepted screening method, and 59% underestimated the likelihood of prostate cancer in a man with a PSA level > 4 ng/ml; 19% were confident in their knowledge of prostate cancer; 86% screened fewer than 60% of their male patients over 50. A knowledge score above the median was not associated with a higher propensity to screen (r = 0.06, P = 0.61). Confidence in one's knowledge was correlated with ordering PSA testing (r = 0.33, P < 0.01). Physician (e.g., ethnicity) and patient (e.g., request for PSA testing) related factors, as well as practice guidelines, particularly those of the US Preventative Services Task Force, influenced providers' decision to offer PSA screening.  Conclusions:   Respondents correctly identified prostate cancer risk factors but were less knowledgeable about prostate cancer screening tests and overall prostate cancer risk. Most respondents were not confident in their knowledge and did not screen men over 50.

Methods:   A prospective, single institution, IRB approved trial was conducted. Entry criteria required that all participants have serologic disease relapse only with serum PSA levels between 0.4 and 10.0 ng/ml. Enrolled participants were treated with 0.5 mg dutasteride daily. The primary endpoints were serum PSA level and clinical recurrence. The rate of durable decline in PSA was assessed according to the recommendations of the Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group.  Results:   Thirty-five patients provided informed consent and participated in the present study. At a median follow-up duration of 27 months (range, 4-42 months), 46% of enrolled men had a serum PSA decrease of greater than 10%, and 25% had a serum PSA decrease of greater than 50% (P < 0.001). Pre-study PSA doubling time (PSADT) (≥12 months vs. <12 months), and Gleason score (≤6 vs. ≥7) were associated with a better response to dutasteride, but only PSADT was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Thirty percent of patients experienced PSA progression (increase in serum PSA of greater than 50%). Two (6%) patients developed bone metastasis. No patient was removed from the study for drug-related toxicity.  Conclusions:   In the present pilot study, treatment with dutasteride resulted in a significant decrease in serum PSA in men with serologic relapse following radical treatment for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

Methods and materials:   Logistic regression analysis was performed with the results of histopathological evaluation of the LN as dependent variable and the nodal risk according to the NRF and the result of MRL as independent input variables. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the performance of the models.  Results:   The analysis included 375 patients. In the single-predictor regression models, the NRF and MRL results were both significantly (p<0.001) predictive of the presence of LN metastasis. In the models with both predictors included, NRF was nonsignificant (p=0.126), but MRL remained significant (p<0.001). For NRF, sensitivity was 0.79 and specificity was 0.38; for MRL, sensitivity was 0.82 and specificity was 0.93. After a negative MRL result, the probability of LN metastasis is 4% regardless of the NRF result. After a positive MRL, the probability of having LN metastasis is 68%.  Conclusions:   MRL is a better predictor of the presence of LN metastasis than NRF. Using only the NRF can lead to a significant overtreatment on the pelvic LN by radiation therapy.

Methods and materials:   Between 2002 and 2008, 110 patients were treated with 46-Gy EBRT followed by PDR brachytherapy (24.96-28.80 Gy). The investigated outcome variables, GI toxicity, GU toxicity, erectile dysfunction, and IPSS were prospectively scored at several time points during follow-up. Association between time (as continuous and categorical variable) and the outcome variables was assessed using generalized linear models.  Results:   No statistically significant association was found between time (continuous) and GI toxicity (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.06), GU toxicity (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.91-1.03), erectile dysfunction (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.11), and IPSS (-0.11; 95% CI, -0.41-0.20). Also, no statistically significant association was found between these variables and time as a categorical variable. GU toxicity was associated with IPSS resolution (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.09-1.24). Posttreatment IPSS was associated with pretreatment IPSS (0.52; 95% CI, 0.25-0.79).  Conclusions:   No accumulation of high-grade toxicity over time could be established for a group of patients treated with EBRT and PDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer, probably because high-grade late toxicity resolves with time.

Objective:   To report standardised complication rates for LRP, evaluate the development of complication rates over time, and show changes within the learning curves of laparoscopic surgeons.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a standardised analysis of 2200 consecutive patients who underwent LRP between 1999 and 2008 at a single institution.  Intervention:   LRP was performed using a transperitoneal (n=871) or extraperitoneal (n=1329) retrograde Heilbronn technique. Five surgeons operated on 96% of the patients.  Measurements:   Complications were classified according to the modified Clavien system. Total complication rates and changes over time were analysed. Three generations of surgeons were defined for evaluation of learning curves.  Results and limitations:   Minor complications occurred in 21.7% of patients (Clavien 1: 6.8%; Clavien 2: 14.9%); anaemia requiring transfusion (10.4%) dominated. Early reinterventions were necessary in 6.7% of patients (Clavien 3a: 3.6%; Clavien 3b: 1.5%; Clavien 4a: 1.5%; Clavien 4b: 0.1%). Late Clavien 3b complications occurred in 4.7% of patients-most of them anastomotic strictures. Mortality was 0.1% (Clavien 5). There was a significant decrease in overall complication rates over time, resulting predominantly from decreasing Clavien 1-2 events. Learning curves of third-generation surgeons plateaued earlier compared to the first generation (250 vs 700 cases). The limitation of this study is that data concerning comorbidity were not included.  Conclusions:   LRP is a safe procedure characterised by an acceptable profile of complications. Specifically, few major complications are reported.

This study aims to better understand these apparently inconsistent relationships among obese men by combining evidence from 3 nationally representative cross-sectional surveys.  Methods:   We evaluated relationships between obesity and 1) testosterone concentrations in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; n=845); 2) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in NHANES 2001-2004 (n=2458); and 3) prostate biopsy rates in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS 2000; n=4789) population. Mean testosterone, PSA concentrations, and biopsy rates were computed for Body Mass Index (BMI) categories.  Results:   Testosterone concentrations were inversely associated with obesity (P-trend <.0001) in NHANES III. In NHANES 2001-2004, obese (BMI >35) versus lean (BMI <25) men were less likely to have PSA concentrations that reached the biopsy threshold of >4 ng/mL (3% vs 8%; P <.0001). Among NHIS participants, all BMI groups had similar rates of PSA testing (P=.24). However, among men who had PSA tests, 11% of men with BMI >30 versus 16% with BMI <25, achieved a PSA threshold of 4 ng/mL; P=.01. Furthermore, biopsy rates were lower among men with BMI >30 versus BMI <25 in NHIS participants (4.6% vs 5.8%; P=.05).  Conclusions:   Obesity was associated with lower PSA-driven biopsy rates.

We recently demonstrated that morphine causes reciprocal transactivation of the MOR and VEGF receptors and that MOR-knockout mice do not develop significant tumors when injected with lung cancer cells as do their wild-type controls.

These nerves are at risk of injury during surgical removal of a cancerous prostate gland. In this work, a combination of segmentation, denoising, and edge detection algorithms are applied to time-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of rat prostate to improve identification of cavernous nerves. First, OCT images of the prostate are segmented to differentiate the cavernous nerves from the prostate gland. Then, a locally adaptive denoising algorithm using a dual-tree complex wavelet transform is applied to reduce speckle noise. Finally, edge detection is used to provide deeper imaging of the prostate gland. Combined application of these three algorithms results in improved signal-to-noise ratio, imaging depth, and automatic identification of the cavernous nerves, which may be of direct benefit for use in laparoscopic and robotic nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery.""","""['Shahab Chitchian', 'Thomas P Weldon', 'Michael A Fiddy', 'Nathaniel M Fried']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biomed Opt""","""['Segmentation of optical coherence tomography images for differentiation of the cavernous nerves from the prostate gland.', 'Denoising during optical coherence tomography of the prostate nerves via wavelet shrinkage using dual-tree complex wavelet transform.', 'Wavelet denoising during optical coherence tomography of the prostate nerves using the complex wavelet transform.', 'Wavelet analysis enables system-independent texture analysis of optical coherence tomography images.', 'OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY HEART TUBE IMAGE DENOISING BASED ON CONTOURLET TRANSFORM.', 'Assessment of Gradient-Based Algorithm for Surface Determination in Multi-Material Gap Measurements by X ray Computed Tomography.', 'Imaging modalities aiding nerve-sparing during radical prostatectomy.', 'Visualization of prostatic nerves by polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography.', 'Novel methods for mapping the cavernous nerves during radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate cancer diagnosis: the feasibility of needle-based optical coherence tomography.']"""

This article describes the incidence and the mortality from cancer in PR for the period of 1987 to 2004.  Methods:   We analyzed data from the PR Central Cancer Registry and the PR Demographic Registry from 1987-2004, for the leading cancer types in men and women in PR. Age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates were estimated by sex, municipality, health region and primary site and were age-standardized to the 2000 PR population.  Results:   Incidence rates for overall cancer remained constant in men and increased in women (APC = 0.6%, p < 0.05), while mortality rates decreased (APC = -1.0%) for both sexes. A significant increase was observed in the cancer incidence rates for colorectal cancer in men, while in women, an increase in breast, colorectal, and corpus and uterus cancer was observed. Mortality rates decreased for most of the major cancers types in both sexes, except for colorectal cancer in men which showed a significant increase (p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   The most important cancer types in PR (prostate, breast, colorectal, and lung) for both incidence and mortality are susceptible to primary prevention (eliminating or reducing risk factors) or to secondary prevention (early diagnosis) strategies.

Our aim was to assess the risk of developing prostate cancer in relation to exposure to specific active compounds in pesticides.  Method:   A case-control approach was used with 1,516 prostate cancer patients and 4,994 age-matched internal controls consisting of all other cancer sites excluding lung cancer and cancers of unknown primary site. Lifetime occupational history was obtained through a self-administered questionnaire and used in conjunction with a job exposure matrix to estimate the participants' lifetime cumulative exposure to approximately 180 active compounds in pesticides. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess prostate cancer risk, adjusting for potential confounding variables and effect modifiers. These include age, ethnicity, alcohol consumption, smoking, education, and proxy respondent.  Results and conclusions:   The significant association between prostate cancer risk and exposure to DDT (OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.04-2.70 for high exposure), simazine (OR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.08-3.33 for high exposure), and lindane (OR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.15-3.55 for high exposure) is in keeping with those previously reported in the literature. We also observed a significant excess risk for several active ingredients that have not been previously reported in the literature such as dichlone, dinoseb amine, malathion, endosulfan, 2,4-D, 2,4-DB, and carbaryl.

Sipuleucel-T is an antigen-presenting cell-based vaccine that recently demonstrated a significant 4.8-month improvement in overall survival in advanced prostate cancer patients and was well tolerated. The findings of that study have been met with skepticism, primarily because the agent did not change initial disease progression and yet led to longer survival. Although the commonly accepted treatment paradigm suggests that treatments should initially decrease tumor volume, perhaps vaccines work differently. Vaccines may induce delayed responses not seen in the first few months of therapy or they may initiate a dynamic immune response that ultimately slows the tumor growth rate, resulting in longer survival. Subsequent therapies may also combine with the induced immune response, resulting in a combination that is more effective than conventional treatments alone. Also, other treatments may alter tumor-associated antigen expression, enhancing the immune response. Future trials are currently planned to investigate these hypotheses; however, the results of the sipuleucel-T vaccine in prostate cancer should not be dismissed. Results with another vaccine in prostate cancer are similar, perhaps suggesting a class effect. In a broader context, clinicians may need to reconsider how they measure success. Several agents have been approved that produce superior disease progression results, but do not affect overall survival. Given the toxicity and costs of cancer therapies, perhaps studies should put more weight on long-term survival endpoints than on short-term endpoints that may be less consequential.""","""['Ravi A Madan', 'James L Gulley', 'Tito Fojo', 'William L Dahut']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Current vaccination strategies for prostate cancer.', 'Sipuleucel-T: APC 8015, APC-8015, prostate cancer vaccine--Dendreon.', 'Demystifying immunotherapy in prostate cancer: understanding current and future treatment strategies.', 'Immunotherapy for prostate cancer: recent advances, lessons learned, and areas for further research.', 'Recent advances in immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Potential of Personalized Dendritic Cell-Based Immunohybridoma Vaccines to Treat Prostate Cancer.', 'Vaccines as treatments for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Vaccines: Toward the Next Breakthrough in Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'The Potential Role for Immunotherapy in Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Putting the Pieces Together: Completing the Mechanism of Action Jigsaw for Sipuleucel-T.']"""

A criterion-based benchmark (CBB) approach was developed as an alternative to evidence-based methods of determining the need for radiotherapy in prostate cancer. Our primary objective was to determine the initial/lifetime CBB radiotherapy rates in prostate cancer and to compare results with evidence-based estimates. Secondary objectives were to compare observed radiotherapy rates in Ontario, Canada and the USA with the estimated rates.  Materials and methods:   Benchmarks were defined in Ontario as communities in proximity to cancer centres and without long waiting lists. Surgical and radiotherapy data, encompassing both external beam radiation and brachytherapy, for 1997-2001 were collected for Ontario cancer patients. The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) public use file described treatment in the USA.  Results:   In total, 35 379 cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed in Ontario and 93 275 in SEER. CBB estimates of the initial/lifetime need for radiotherapy were 37.2% (95% confidence interval: 35.8-38.7) and 59.1% (54.3-63.9). Our group's evidence-based estimate (Ebest) rates were 32.3% (28.5-36.1) and 61.2% (55.6-66.8). Observed initial radiotherapy rates were 28.0% (27.5-28.4) in Ontario and 37.0% (36.7-37.3) in SEER. In Ontario, the estimated lifetime rate was 42.6% (41.2-44.0).  Conclusions:   CBB provides a reasonable estimate of the need for radiotherapy in prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   Between 1997 and 2001, 276 patients were enrolled and the data from 261 were analyzed. The stratification risk factors were prostate-specific antigen level >20 ng/mL, Gleason score≥7, and Stage T3 or more. The intermediate-risk stratum had one factor and the high-risk stratum had two or more. Staging was done from the bone scan and computed tomography findings. The primary endpoint was biochemical failure-free survival.  Results:   The median follow-up was 102 months. The overall survival, biochemical failure-free survival. and prostate cancer-specific survival did not differ significantly between the two treatment arms, overall or at 5 years. The cumulative probability of overall survival at 5 years was 90% (range, 87-92%) in Arm 1 and 83% (range, 80-86%) in Arm 2. The biochemical failure-free survival rate at 5 years was 66% (range, 62-71%) in Arm 1 and 63% (range, 58-67%) in Arm 2.

To facilitate an improved definition of the adjuvant target volume, precise knowledge regarding the location of the relevant lymph nodes is necessary. Therefore, we generated a three-dimensional sentinel lymph node atlas.  Methods and materials:   In 61 patients with high-risk prostate cancer, a three-dimensional visualization of sentinel lymph nodes was performed using a single photon emission computed tomography system after transrectal intraprostatic injection of 150 to 362 (median 295) mega becquerel (MBq) (99m)Technetium-nanocolloid (1.5-3 h after injection) followed by an anatomic functional image fusion.  Results:   In all, 324 sentinel nodes in 59 of 61 patients (96.7%) were detected, with 0 to 13 nodes per patient (median 5, mean 5.3). The anatomic distribution of the sentinel nodes was as follows: external iliac 34.3%, internal iliac 17.9%, common iliac 12.7%, sacral 8.6%, perirectal 6.2%, left paraaortic 5.3%, right paraaortic 5.3%, seminal vesicle lymphatic plexus 3.1%, deep inguinal 1.5%, superior rectal 1.2%, internal pudendal 1.2%, perivesical 0.9%, inferior rectal 0.9%, retroaortic 0.3%, superficial inguinal 0.3%, and periprostatic 0.3%.  Conclusions:   The distribution of sentinel nodes as detected by single photon emission computed tomography imaging correlates well with the distribution determined by intraoperative gamma probe detection. A lower detection rate of sentinels in close proximity to the bladder and seminal vesicles is probably caused by the radionuclide accumulation in the bladder. In regard to intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques, the presented anatomic atlas may allow optimized target volume definitions.""","""['Ute Ganswindt', 'David Schilling', 'Arndt-Christian Müller', 'Roland Bares', 'Peter Bartenstein', 'Claus Belka']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Detection rate and operating time required for gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node resection after injection of technetium-99m nanocolloid into the prostate with and without preoperative imaging.', 'Value of SPECT/CT for detection and anatomic localization of sentinel lymph nodes before laparoscopic sentinel node lymphadenectomy in prostate carcinoma.', 'Distribution of prostate nodes: a PET/CT-derived anatomic atlas of prostate cancer patients before and after surgical treatment.', 'Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomographyfor sentinel node mapping in breast cancer.', 'RTOG GU Radiation oncology specialists reach consensus on pelvic lymph node volumes for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Utility of Lymphadenectomy in Prostate Cancer: Where Do We Stand?', 'On the probability of lymph node negativity in pN0-staged prostate cancer-a\xa0theoretically derived rule of thumb for adjuvant needs.', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy with Simultaneous Integrated Boost for Clinically Node-Positive Prostate Cancer: A Single-Institutional Retrospective Study.', 'Association between incidental dose outside the prostate and tumor control after modern image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Mesorectal Lymph Node Metastases as Index Lesion in 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT Imaging for Recurrent Prostate Cancer.']"""

The College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Checklists present pathology reports in synoptic form and allow registries to be updated electronically. To assess the challenge of employing the CAP Cancer Checklists in pathology laboratories and transmitting that information to cancer registries, we conducted a pilot project: the Reporting Pathology Protocols project (RPP2). The RPP2 project was a multi-year, ""proof of concept"" demonstration that assessed pathology report-generated data for 3 CAP Cancer Checklists (breast, prostate, and melanoma) in several different cancer registry-pathology laboratory combinations in 3 states. Collaborating pathology laboratories and state cancer registries in California, Maine, and Pennsylvania identified key questions (queries) to address in the course of the project, developed and tested standardized HL7 messaging specifications to link senders and recipients, and then assessed the actual process results using either parallel reporting or retrospective-prospective cases for each tumor type. Successful electronic transfer and capture of pertinent data elements for numerous examples of each tumor type was accomplished in each participating cancer registry/reporting laboratory/information system combination. We noted shortcomings in the electronically encoded CAP Checklists as opposed to text-based reports, particularly for breast cancers. We uncovered opportunities to improve Checklists and the information systems that incorporate them. Workflow, productivity, and timeliness of reporting are areas where electronically encoded reports may enhance cancer registry processes. The accuracy and completeness of electronically encoded data appears largely comparable to text-based data, but subject to the degree of synchrony between the formats of text-based and electronic reports.""","""['Lewis Hassell', 'Wendy Aldinger', 'Cheryl Moody', 'Sharon Winters', 'Ken Gerlach', 'Molly Schwenn', 'Deborah Perriello']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""J Registry Manag""","""['Synoptic tool for reporting of hematological and lymphoid neoplasms based on World Health Organization classification and College of American Pathologists checklist.', 'Usefulness of a synoptic data tool for reporting of head and neck neoplasms based on the College of American Pathologists cancer checklists.', 'Challenges and opportunities in the adoption of College of American Pathologists checklists in electronic format: perspectives and experience of Reporting Pathology Protocols Project (RPP2) participant laboratories.', 'Recommendations for the reporting of prostate carcinoma.', 'Cancer biomarkers: the role of structured data reporting.', 'Identification of barriers and facilitators in nationwide implementation of standardized structured reporting in pathology: a mixed method study.', 'Synoptic Reporting: Evidence-Based Review and Future Directions.', '""Minimally invasive research?""
