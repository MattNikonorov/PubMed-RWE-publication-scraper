Materials and methods:   A post-processing algorithm to correct for the endorectal coil reception effects on MRSI data was developed based upon theoretical modeling of the endorectal coil reception profile and of the spatial saturation pulse profiles. This algorithm was evaluated on three-dimensional (3D) MRSI data acquired at 3T from a uniform phantom and from 18 patients with known or suspected prostate cancer.  Results:   For the phantom data, the coefficient of variation of metabolite peak areas decreased 16% to 46% and the peak area distributions became more Gaussian with correction, as demonstrated by higher Q-Q plot linear correlations (R(2) = 0.98 +/- 0.007 vs. R(2) = 0.89 +/- 0.066). Across the 18 patients, the mean coefficient of variation for suppressed water decreased significantly, from 0.95 +/- 0.18, to 0.66 +/- 0.11, (P < 10(-6), paired t-test) and the linear correlations of the Q-Q plots for the suppressed water increased from R(2) = 0.91 to R(2) = 0.95 (P = 0.0083, paired t-test) with correction.  Conclusion:   An algorithm for reducing the effect of the inhomogeneous reception profile in endorectal coil acquired 3D MRSI prostate data was demonstrated, illustrating increased homogeneity and more Gaussian peak area distributions.""","""['Susan M Noworolski', 'Galen D Reed', 'John Kurhanewicz', 'Daniel B Vigneron']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Mapping of the prostate in endorectal coil-based MRI/MRSI and CT: a deformable registration and validation study.', 'Three-dimensional H-1 MR spectroscopic imaging of the in situ human prostate with high (0.24-0.7-cm3) spatial resolution.', 'High-Quality 3-Dimensional 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of the Prostate Without Endorectal Receive Coil Using A Semi-LASER Sequence.', 'Feasibility and characterization of a safe susceptibility-matched endorectal coil for MR spectroscopy.', 'Clinical use of endorectal coil MR in the study of prostatic pathology with special reference to hyperplasia and carcinoma.', 'Developments in proton MR spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Identification of prostate cancer using multiparametric MR imaging characteristics of prostate tissues referenced to whole mount histopathology.', 'Impact of the integration of proton magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy to PI-RADS 2 for prediction of high grade and high stage prostate cancer.', 'Characterization and stratification of prostate lesions based on comprehensive multiparametric MRI using detailed whole-mount histopathology as a reference standard.', 'Improved multiparametric MRI discrimination between low-risk prostate cancer and benign tissues in a small cohort of 5α-reductase inhibitor treated individuals as compared with an untreated cohort.']"""

Androgen receptor (AR) coactivator ARA70, was first identified as a gene fused to the ret oncogene and later characterized as an AR coactivator. We previously reported that the full length ARA70α functions as a tumor suppressor gene and that ARA70β functions as an oncogene in prostate cancer. Here we show that both ARA70α and ARA70β function as AR and estrogen receptor (ER) coactivators in breast cancer cells. However, ARA70α and ARA70β serve different functions in mammary gland development and breast cancer tumorigenesis. We observed hypoplastic development of mammary glands in MMTV driven ARA70α transgenic mice and overgrowth of mammary glands in ARA70β transgenic mice at virgin and pregnant stages. We determined that ARA70α inhibited cell proliferation, and that ARA70β promotes proliferation in MCF7 breast cancer cells. These effects were observed in hormone-free media, or in media with androgen or estrogen, though to varying degrees. Additionally, we observed that ARA70β strongly enhanced the invasive ability of MCF7 breast cancer cells in in vitro Matrigel assays. Significantly, decreased ARA70α expression is associated with increased tendency of breast cancer metastasis. In summary, ARA70α and ARA70β have distinct effects in mammary gland development and in the progression of breast cancer.""","""['Xinyu Wu', 'Fei Chen', 'Aysegul Sahin', 'Constance Albarracin', 'Zhiheng Pei', 'Xuanyi Zou', 'Baljit Singh', 'Ruliang Xu', 'Garrett Daniels', 'Yirong Li', 'Jianjun Wei', 'Marvin Blake', 'Robert J Schneider', 'Pamela Cowin', 'Peng Lee']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Androgen receptor coactivator ARA70alpha and ARA70beta isoform-specific antibodies: new tools for studies of expression and immunohistochemical localization.', 'Metastasis tumor antigen family proteins during breast cancer progression and metastasis in a reliable mouse model for human breast cancer.', 'Transgenic introduction of androgen receptor into estrogen-receptor-, progesterone-receptor-, and androgen-receptor-negative breast cancer cells renders them responsive to hormonal manipulation.', 'Dual effects of androgens on mammary gland.', 'The hyperplastic phenotype in PR-A and PR-B transgenic mice: lessons on the role of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the mouse mammary gland and breast cancer.', 'NCOA4-Mediated Ferritinophagy Is a Pancreatic Cancer Dependency via Maintenance of Iron Bioavailability for Iron-Sulfur Cluster Proteins.', 'The Emerging Role of PRMT6 in Cancer.', 'The Role of Iron in Cancer Progression.', 'The Role of NCOA4-Mediated Ferritinophagy in Ferroptosis.', 'Role of tumor and host autophagy in cancer metabolism.']"""

This number pertains to Europe, North America and parts of South America (Argentina). Men are more often afflicted than women (female:male ratio of about 1:1.5, though reports vary). There has been a very small but steady increase in the incidence over the last 50 years. Unfortunately, numbers for incidence and mortality are still practically identical for this cancer. The peak of incidence is between 60 and 80 years of age. In absolute numbers, there are 8,000 cases diagnosed annually in Germany, and 33,000 in the US. Pancreatic cancer at <40 years of age is extremely rare (2 cases per million per year), but among 80-year-olds, the incidence is about 200 new cases per 100,000 population per year. In men, carcinoma of the pancreas is the fourth most common cause of cancer death after lung, prostate and colorectal cancer. In women, it is the fifth most common cause of cancer death. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include high-fat diet, smoking, chronic pancreatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, hereditary pancreatitis, family history of pancreatic cancer and diabetes mellitus. In chronic pancreatitis, the risk for pancreatic cancer is increased 20-fold, in hereditary pancreatitis it is 60-fold higher than in the general population.

Clinically and histologically, AIP has two subsets: type 1--lymphoplasmatic sclerosing pancreatitis with abundant infiltration of the pancreas and other affected organs with immunoglobulin G4-positive plasma cells, and type 2--duct centric fibrosis, characterized by granulocyte epithelial lesions in the pancreas without systemic involvement. In the diagnosis of AIP, two diagnostic criterions are used--the HISORt criteria and Asian Diagnostic Criteria. In the differential diagnosis, the pancreatic cancer must be excluded by endosonographically guided pancreatic biopsy. Typical signs of AIP are concomitant disorders in other organs (kidney, liver, biliary tract, salivary glands, colon, retroperitoneum, prostate). Novel clinicopathological entity was proposed as an 'IgG4-related sclerosing disease' (IgG4-RSC). Extensive IgG4-positive plasma cells and T lymphocyte infiltration is a common characteristics of this disease. Recently, IgG4-RSC syndrome was extended to a new entity, characterized by IgG4 hypergammaglobulinemia and IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration, this being considered an expression of a lymphoproliferative disease, 'IgG4-positive multiorgan lymphoproliferative syndrome'. This syndrome includes Mikulicz's disease, mediastinal fibrosis, autoimmune hypophysitis, and inflammatory pseudotumor--lung, liver, breast. In the therapy of AIP, steroids constitute first-choice treatment. High response to the corticosteroid therapy is an important diagnostic criterion. In the literature, there are no case-control studies that determine if AIP predisposes to pancreatic cancer.

Methods:   We used publicly available databases of cancer incidence, cancer mortality and relative survival to correlate relative survival estimates and 1-(M/I) estimates from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the USA and the Netherlands. We visually examined for which tumour sites 5-year relative survival cannot simply be predicted by the 1-(M/I) and evaluated similarities between countries.  Results:   Country-specific linear regression analyses show that there is no systematic bias in predicting 5-year relative survival by 1-(M/I) in five countries. There is a small but significant systematic underestimation of survival from prognostically poor tumour sites in two countries. Furthermore, the 1-(M/I) overestimates survival from oral cavity and liver cancer with >10% in at least two of the seven countries. By contrast, the proxy underestimates survival from soft tissue, bone, breast, prostate and oesophageal cancer, multiple myeloma and leukaemia with >10% in at least two of the seven countries.

Here, we report that the cytokine IFN rapidly induces miR-21 expression in human and mouse cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was implicated in this pathway based on the lack of IFN effect on miR-21 expression in prostate cancer cells with a deletion in the STAT3 gene. STAT3 ablation abrogated IFN induction of miR-21, confirming the important role of STAT3 in regulating miR-21. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that STAT3 directly bound the miR-21 promoter in response to IFN. Experiments in mouse embryo fibroblasts with a genetic deletion of the p65 NF-κB subunit showed that IFN-induced miR-21 expression was also dependent on NF-κB. STAT3 silencing blocked both IFN-induced p65 binding to the miR-21 promoter and p65 nuclear translocation. Thus, IFN-induced miR-21 expression is coregulated by STAT3 and NF-κB at the level of the miR-21 promoter. Several cell death regulators were identified as downstream targets of miR-21, including PTEN and Akt. Functional experiments in prostate cancer cells directly showed that miR-21 plays a critical role in suppressing IFN-induced apoptosis.

Here, we tested whether targeting this receptor could impair metastatic colonization and progression, as well as prolong survival, either as primary or as combination therapy.  Experimental design:   We used a preclinical animal model of metastasis in which PC3-ML human prostate cancer cells are inoculated directly in the blood circulation. First, the humanized, monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 was administered to mice bearing established skeletal metastases. Second, we targeted the stromal PDGFRα with IMC-1E10, an antibody specific for the murine receptor. Third, IMC-3G3 and the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZA), administered separately or in combination, were tested on the progression of skeletal lesions and overall survival. In addition, the ability of IMC-3G3 and ZA to impair initial colonization of the bone marrow by prostate cancer cells was investigated.  Results:   The blockade of PDGFRα on prostate cancer cells by IMC-3G3 reduces the size of established skeletal metastases, whereas the IMC-1E10 antibody directed against the stromal PDGFRα fails to inhibit metastatic progression. IMC-3G3 and ZA, either separately or in combination, significantly slow tumor growth and seem to prolong survival. Lastly, the blockade of PDGFRα by IMC-3G3 inhibits the initial phase of bone colonization, whereas ZA is ineffective at this stage.  Conclusion:   This study presents compelling evidence that targeting PDGFRα with IMC-3G3 delays the progression of early metastatic foci and reduces the size of more established lesions.

Kindlin-2 was recently found overexpressed during cancer progression. In this study, we examined the functional role of Kindlin-2 in cisplatin-induced prostate cancer cell death. Kindlin-2 was highly expressed in the androgen-insensitive (PC-3 and DU-145), but not in the androgen-sensitive cell lines (e.g., LNCaP). Overexpression of Kindlin-2 in LNCaP protected the cells from cisplatin-induced death, while Kindlin-2 knock-down in PC-3 cells enhanced cisplatin sensitivity. Mechanistically, Kindlin-2 regulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL may explain the increased cell death in the absence of Kindlin-2. Taken together, Kindlin-2 appears to play a functional role in prostate cancer cell sensitivity to cisplatin. Targeting Kindlin-2 may therefore improve drug efficacy and reduce drug doses, and would likely be beneficial for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaowei Gong', 'Zhengwen An', 'Yunling Wang', 'Lizhao Guan', 'Weigang Fang', 'Staffan Strömblad', 'Yong Jiang', 'Hongquan Zhang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Molecular mechanisms of synergistic induction of apoptosis by the combination therapy with hyperthermia and cisplatin in prostate cancer cells.', 'PCPH/ENTPD5 expression confers to prostate cancer cells resistance against cisplatin-induced apoptosis through protein kinase Calpha-mediated Bcl-2 stabilization.', 'eNOS protects prostate cancer cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'Kindlin-2 promotes invasiveness of prostate cancer cells via NF-κB-dependent upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases.', 'Docetaxel induces Bcl-2- and pro-apoptotic caspase-independent death of human prostate cancer DU145 cells.', 'The Role of ARHGAP1 in Rho GTPase Inactivation during Metastasizing of Breast Cancer Cell Line MCF-7 after Treatment with Doxorubicin.', 'Kindlin-2 promotes Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of androgen receptor and contributes to breast cancer progression.', 'Kindlin-2 in Sertoli cells is essential for testis development and male fertility in mice.', 'Kindlin-2 deficiency induces fatal intestinal obstruction in mice.', 'Kindlin-2 regulates hepatic stellate cells activation and liver fibrogenesis.']"""

The interest in the development of novel epigenetic drugs has increased the demand for cell-based assays to evaluate drug performance in pre-clinical studies. An imaging-based cytometrical approach that can measure demethylation effects as changes in the spatial nuclear distributions of methylated cytosine and global DNA in cancer cells is introduced in this paper. The cells were studied by immunofluorescence with a specific antibody against 5-methylcytosine (MeC), and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for delineation of methylated sites and global DNA in nuclei. In the preprocessing step the segmentation of nuclei in three-dimensional images (3-D) is followed by an automated assessment of nuclear DAPI/MeC patterns to exclude dissimilar entities. Next, low-intensity MeC (LIM) and low-intensity DNA (LID) sites of similar nuclei are localized and processed to obtain specific nuclear density profiles. These profiles sampled at half of the total nuclear volume yielded two parameters: LIM(0.5) and LID(0.5). The analysis shows that zebularine and 5-azacytidine-the two tested epigenetic drugs introduce changes in the spatial distribution of low-intensity DNA and MeC signals. LIM(0.5) and LID(0.5) were significantly different (p<0.001) in 5-azacytidine treated (n=660) and zebularine treated (n=496) vs. untreated (n=649) DU145 human prostate cancer cells. In the latter case the LIM sites were predominantly found at the nuclear border, whereas treated populations showed different degrees of increase in LIMs towards the interior nuclear space, in which a large portion of heterochromatin is located. The cell-by-cell evaluation of changes in the spatial reorganization of MeC/DAPI signals revealed that zebularine is a more gentle demethylating agent than 5-azacytidine. Measuring changes in the topology of low-intensity sites can potentially be a valuable component in the high-throughput assessment of demethylation and risk of chromatin reorganization in epigenetic-drug screening tasks.""","""['Arkadiusz Gertych', 'Daniel L Farkas', 'Jian Tajbakhsh']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['3-D DNA methylation phenotypes correlate with cytotoxicity levels in prostate and liver cancer cell models.', 'Automated quantification of DNA demethylation effects in cells via 3D mapping of nuclear signatures and population homogeneity assessment.', 'A Comparative Analysis of 5-Azacytidine- and Zebularine-Induced DNA Demethylation.', 'DNA methylation topology: potential of a chromatin landmark for epigenetic drug toxicology.', 'Zebularine: a new drug for epigenetic therapy.', 'Highly sensitive noninvasive early lung cancer detection using DNA methylation topology in sputum-derived epithelial cells.', 'DNA methylation topology differentiates between normal and malignant in cell models, resected human tissues, and exfoliated sputum cells of lung epithelium.', 'Efficient automatic 3D segmentation of cell nuclei for high-content screening.', 'Biomedical Applications of Translational Optical Imaging: From Molecules to Humans.', 'Prostate cancer diagnosis using epigenetic biomarkers, 3D high-content imaging and probabilistic cell-by-cell classifiers.']"""

First, preoperative MR images were obtained with a specifically-made plastic outer-frame, with exactly the same shape as the real TRUS probe, placed in the rectum, in order to simulate the deformation of the prostate caused by the absence or presence of a TRUS probe during the acquisition of MR or TRUS images.

We focused on operative data, complications, pathological outcome and mid-term outcome and follow-up in terms of oncological results. The same surgeons performed both operations. The 2 groups were similar with respect to mean patient age, mean prostate specific antigen value, median Gleason score. No previous transurethral resection of the prostate nor neoadjuvant treatment, had been undertaken in both groups of pts. Mean operating time was significantly shorter after open surgery (126 minutes, range 90-185 minutes) [p = 0.03] compared to the laparoscopic group (188 minutes, range 130-250) but it did not differ significantly from the last 20 laparoscopic procedures, in which the time of procedure was reduced to a mean of 155 minutes group (range 140-184 minutes) [p = 0.1]. Mean blood loss (1,150 versus 800 cc) and transfusion rates (55.7% versus 19.6%) in the 2 groups significantly favored the laparoscopic group. Number of lymphnodes dissected during the procedures favoured, but not significantly, the RRP group: for RRP a mean 11 lymphnodes right side, 13 left side (ranges 2-20 and 2-19 respectively), while for LRP a mean of 9 lymphnodes right side, 11 left side (ranges 2-15 and 2-13 respectively) were collected. The complication rate was almost the same in both groups, with no major adverse events nor deaths, (19.2% versus 14.7%) but the spectrum differed. The laparoscopic group had a higher incidence of fever (1.8% versus 3.2% respectively) and subcutaneous or scrotal emphysema, whereas more lymphoceles (6.9% versus 0%), wound infection (2.3% versus 0.5%), embolism/pneumonia (2.3% versus 0.5%) and anastomotic strictures (15.9% versus 4%) occurred after open surgery. Median catheter time was longer after open retropubic prostatectomy (22 versus 8.9 days, respectively) but the continence rates (intended as complete continence with no use of pads) were similar in both groups at 12 months (90.3% versus 91.7%). The rate of positive margins did not differ significantly in groups, and was in all cases very low (8.2% versus 7.0%), prostate specific antigen biochemical recurrence was equivalent (10% vs 10%). Data regarding postoperative sexual function favoured the laparoscopic group, even if no statistical significance was recorded (55% vs 67%). No statistical differences were observed in terms of oncological results, with a 24 months mean follow-up. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is technically demanding, with an initially longer operative time and learning curve. The overall outcome in our series favours the laparoscopic approach regarding catheterization time, recover of continence and impotence, hospital stay, transfusion rate. The open approach is favoured for the still shorter time necessitating for the procedure.

Results:   Despite loss of the monocytes marker CD14, cytokine-matured DCs of tumor bearing patients expressed lower levels of the costimulatory molecule CD80 and of the maturation markers CD83 and CCR7 compared to mDC of normal subjects (NS, P = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.008, respectively). Prostatectomy restored CD80, CD83, and CCR7 expression to values not different from those of NS (P = 0.15, 0.60, and 0.71) and significantly higher than those of the pre-surgery state (CD83, P = 0.0003 and CCR7, P = 0.002). The frequency of Tregs, identified as either CD4 + CD25(high)FoxP3(+) or CD4(+)CD25(high)CD127(low/-), was significantly higher in pre-surgery patients than in NS (P = 0.0001 and 0.0003) and significant recovery of the CD4(+)CD25(high)CD127(low/-) (P = 0.0005) was observed after surgery.

We conducted a prospective influenza vaccination study to determine the influence of vitamin D status on serological response to influenza vaccine in prostate cancer (CaP) patients.  Methods:   During the 2006-2007 influenza season, CaP patients treated at Roswell Park Cancer Institute were offered vaccination with the trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone®, 2006-2007) and sera collected for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay titers before and 3 months after vaccination. Response to vaccination was defined as ≥1:40 titer ratio or a fourfold increase in titer at 3 months, against any of the three strains. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-D₃) levels were measured using DiaSorin ¹²⁵I radioimmunoassay kits.  Results:   Thirty-five patients with CaP participated in the study. Median baseline 25-D₃ level was 44.88 ng/ml (range: 9.16-71.98 ng/ml) Serological response against any of the three strains was noted in 80%. There was a significant effect of baseline 25-D3 level when tested as a continuous variable in relation to serological response (P = 0.0446). All patients in the upper quartile of 25-D3 level responded by mounting a serological response (P = 0.0344).

We also examined whether combining two cell-cycle arrest stimuli, cdk2ap1 plus bicalutamide (or casodex, CDX), could help enhance inhibition of prostate cancer cell phenotypes.  Methods:   We stably expressed cdk2ap1 in prostate cancer cell lines using lentiviral vectors, as well as several different co-culture assays to quantify cellular invasion, migration, and the effect of the treatments on interaction with the bone microenvironment.  Results:   We have determined that cdk2ap1 can further augment the effects of CDX on cell-cycle arrest, growth inhibition, and cellular invasion. Using a coculture model, we observed that either cdk2ap1 or cdk2ap1/CDX combination were able to reduce chemotaxis towards osteoblasts, and also reduce the osteoblastic proliferative response to prostate cancer. Also modified by cdk2ap1 and CDX were several signaling pathways associated with prostate cancer/bone crosstalk mechanisms involved in prostate cancer progression.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that either cdk2ap1 or the cdk2ap1/CDX combination hold promise in regulating prostate cancer growth and malignant phenotypes, and potentially also in reducing procarcinogenic interactions with a bone microenvironment model, restoring malignant phenotypes and signaling to a more benign state.""","""['Olga Zolochevska', 'Marxa L Figueiredo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Double edge: CDK2AP1 in cell-cycle regulation and epigenetic regulation.', 'Antagonistic interaction between bicalutamide (Casodex) and radiation in androgen-positive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Cell cycle regulator cdk2ap1 inhibits prostate cancer cell growth and modifies androgen-responsive pathway function.', 'Chronic azacitidine treatment results in differentiating effects, sensitizes against bicalutamide in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor regulates Cdc6 in synchronized LNCaP cells progressing from G1 to S phase.', 'An Asymmetric Genetic Signal Associated with Mechanosensory Expansion in Cave-Adapted Fish.', 'Combination of Interleukin-27 and MicroRNA for Enhancing Expression of Anti-Inflammatory and Proosteogenic Genes.', 'miR-205 promotes proliferation and invasion of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma by suppressing CDK2AP1 expression.', 'Interleukin-27 gene delivery for modifying malignant interactions between prostate tumor and bone.', 'Double edge: CDK2AP1 in cell-cycle regulation and epigenetic regulation.']"""

Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa tumorigenic development is critical for advancing treatment strategies for PCa. The role of Group VIA phospholipase A₂β (iPLA₂β) in cancers has recently emerged. However, the biological functions of iPLA₂β in PCa development have been minimally investigated and only in vitro studies have been reported.  Methods:   We tested the role of iPLA₂β in host cells using an iPLA₂β deficient mouse model and the role of iPLA₂β in tumor cells by comparing the proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.  Conclusions:   iPLA₂β deficiency did not affect tumor development in C57BL/6 mice injected with syngeneic PCa cell line TRAMP-C1P3 in any of three models (subcutaneous, orthotopic, or intratibia injection) tested, suggesting that host cell iPLA₂β is not required for PCa tumorigenesis and metastasis. In contrast, when iPLA₂β was down-regulated in TRAMP-C1P3 cells, cell proliferation was reduced in vitro and tumor growth was suppressed in vivo compared to control cells. In particular, iPLA₂β was required for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced migration and invasion in TRAMP-C1P3 cells. We compared human and mouse PCa cells and showed that they shared high similarities in LPA-stimulated effects and signaling pathways. LPA stimulated cell migration and/or invasion via a PI3K-dependent pathway.

Inhibition of Akt or activation of AMPK is cytotoxic to human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We previously demonstrated that 2-arylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid amides (ATCAA) are effective cytotoxic agents in prostate and melanoma cancer cell lines, with IC(50) values in the low/sub micromolar range. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, we further characterized the anti-cancer efficacy and mechanism of action of ATCAA-10, a potent lead. ATCAA-10 exhibited equal potency on both MES/SA and P-glycoprotein over-expressing multidrug resistant MES/SA/Dx5 cells, suggesting that ATCAA-10 may overcome multiple drug resistance. Cell-free kinase binding assays excluded the direct binding of ATCAA-10 to several kinases, including IGF-1R, EGFR, FGFR and PDGFR. However, in A549 and HeLa cells, ATCAA-10 effectively dephosphorylated Akt, with concomitant phosphorylation of AMPK. Determination of intracellular ATP and AMP concentrations revealed that ATCAA-10 activated AMPK by altering the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio. ATCAA-10 exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties in both mice and rats, including low clearance, low hepatic extraction rate, moderate volume of distribution and long half-life. In addition, ATCAA-10 inhibited A549 tumor xenograft growth with 46% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at 20 mg/kg dose.

The effects of the androgen-depleted medium, R1881 (synthetic androgen) and/or androgen receptor blocker, bicalutamide were examined in the human androgen-responsive but not dependent 22rv1 cells. R1881 supplementation significantly increased mitochondrial FA oxidation ((14)C-radiolabeled FA degradation studies), resulting in increased ROS production. Androgens increased the mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1), the rate limiting enzyme in the process of mitochondrial FA oxidation. Treatment with R1881 and bicalutamide inhibited these androgen regulated effects. Inhibition of mitochondrial ROS generation by two different inhibitors, rotenone and thenoyltrifluoroacetone, eliminated the androgen-induced ROS generation, to the same level as in cells deprived of androgens or treated with R1881 and bicalutamide. Taken together, androgens increase the mitochondrial oxidation of FA, leading to increased production of ROS that is associated with prostate cell proliferation and mutagenesis.

A total of 302 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were genotyped in >5,500 Caucasian men and 5,500 Caucasian women from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium.  Results:   After adjusting for multiple testing, SNPs in the IGF1 and SSTR5 genes were significantly associated with circulating IGF-I (P < 2.1 × 10(-4)); SNPs in the IGFBP3 and IGFALS genes were significantly associated with circulating IGFBP-3. Multi-SNP models explained R(2) = 0.62% of the variation in circulating IGF-I and 3.9% of the variation in circulating IGFBP-3. We saw no significant association between these multi-SNP predictors of circulating IGF-I or IGFBP-3 and risk of prostate or breast cancers.  Conclusion:   Common genetic variation in the IGF1 and SSTR5 genes seems to influence circulating IGF-I levels, and variation in IGFBP3 and IGFALS seems to influence circulating IGFBP-3. However, these variants explain only a small percentage of the variation in circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in Caucasian men and women.  Impact:   Further studies are needed to explore contributions from other genetic factors such as rare variants in these genes and variation outside of these genes.""","""['Fangyi Gu', 'Fredrick R Schumacher', 'Federico Canzian', 'Naomi E Allen', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Christine D Berg', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Heiner Boeing', 'H Bas Bueno-de-Mesquita', 'Julie E Buring', 'Nathalie Chabbert-Buffet', 'Stephen J Chanock', 'Françoise Clavel-Chapelon', 'Vanessa Dumeaux', 'J Michael Gaziano', 'Edward L Giovannucci', 'Christopher A Haiman', 'Susan E Hankinson', 'Richard B Hayes', 'Brian E Henderson', 'David J Hunter', 'Robert N Hoover', 'Mattias Johansson', 'Timothy J Key', 'Kay-Tee Khaw', 'Laurence N Kolonel', 'Pagona Lagiou', 'I-Min Lee', 'Loic LeMarchand', 'Eiliv Lund', 'Jing Ma', 'N Charlotte Onland-Moret', 'Kim Overvad', 'Laudina Rodriguez', 'Carlotta Sacerdote', 'Maria-José Sánchez', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Pär Stattin', 'Daniel O Stram', 'Gilles Thomas', 'Michael J Thun', 'Anne Tjønneland', 'Dimitrios Trichopoulos', 'Rosario Tumino', 'Jarmo Virtamo', 'Stephanie J Weinstein', 'Walter C Willett', 'Meredith Yeager', 'Shumin M Zhang', 'Rudolf Kaaks', 'Elio Riboli', 'Regina G Ziegler', 'Peter Kraft']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 polymorphisms predict circulating IGF levels but not breast cancer risk: findings from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3).', 'Common genetic variation of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-3, and acid labile subunit in relation to serum IGF-I levels and mammographic density.', 'Genotypes and haplotypes in the insulin-like growth factors, their receptors and binding proteins in relation to plasma metabolic levels and mammographic density.', 'Polymorphisms and circulating levels in the insulin-like growth factor system and risk of breast cancer: a systematic review.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-I and binding protein-3 and risk of cancer.', 'Bioinformatics and network biology approach to identifying type 2 diabetes genes and pathways that influence the progression of breast cancer.', 'Adult Height as a Risk Factor for Developing Colorectal Cancer: A Population-Based Cohort Study in Thailand.', 'Association of IGF-1 gene rs2195239 polymorphism with the risk and clinical features of gastric cancer in a Chinese Han population.', 'Comparative transcriptomic analysis of hypothalamus-pituitary-liver axis in bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) with differential growth rate.', 'International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology.

However radical radiotherapy historically treats the whole gland rather than individual cancer foci.Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to non-invasively locate individual cancerous tumours in prostate. Thus an intentionally non-uniform dose distribution treating the dominant intraprostatic lesion to different dose levels than the remaining prostate can be delivered ensuring the maximum achievable tumour control probability.The aim of this study is to evaluate, using radiobiological means, the feasibility of a MRS-guided high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost to the dominant lesion.  Methods:   Computed tomography and MR/MRS were performed for treatment planning of a high risk localised prostate cancer. Both were done without endorectal coil, which distorts shape of prostate during the exams.Three treatment plans were compared:- external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) only- combination of EBRT and HDR brachytherapy- combination of EBRT and HDR brachytherapy with a synchronous integrated boost to the dominant lesionThe criteria of plan comparison were: the minimum, maximum and average doses to the targets and organs at risk; dose volume histograms; biologically effective doses for organs at risk and tumour control probability for the target volumes consisting of the dominant lesion as detected by MR/MRS and the remaining prostate volume.  Results:   Inclusion of MRS information on the location of dominant lesion allows a safe increase of the dose to the dominant lesion while dose to the remaining target can be even substantially decreased keeping the same, high tumour control probability. At the same time an improved urethra sparing was achieved comparing to the treatment plan using a combination of EBRT and uniform HDR brachytherapy.  Conclusions:   MRS-guided HDR brachytherapy boost to dominant lesion has the potential to spare the normal tissue, especially urethra, while keeping the tumour control probability high.""","""['Aleksandra Kazi', 'Guy Godwin', 'John Simpson', 'Giuseppe Sasso']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Inverse planning for HDR prostate brachytherapy used to boost dominant intraprostatic lesions defined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Normal tissue dosimetric comparison between HDR prostate implant boost and conformal external beam radiotherapy boost: potential for dose escalation.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Radiotherapy Boost for the Dominant Intraprostatic Cancer Lesion-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Dosimetric Uncertainties in Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion Simultaneous Boost Using Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy.', 'Multiparametric MRI-guided dose boost to dominant intraprostatic lesions in CT-based High-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Long-term outcome of magnetic resonance spectroscopic image-directed dose escalation for prostate brachytherapy.', 'The potential role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer clinical application.']"""

We have recently shown that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (PGG) induced S-phase arrest in prostate cancer (PCa) cells through inhibiting DNA replicative synthesis and G(1) arrest, in addition to inducing cell death at higher levels of exposure. We and others have shown that PGG through intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection exerts a strong in vivo growth suppression of human PCa xenograft models in athymic nude mice. This study aims to test the hypothesis that the novel targeting actions of PGG are applicable to BCa cells, especially those lacking proven druggable targets.  Methods:   Mono-layer cell culture models of p53-wild type estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent MCF-7 BCa cells and p53-mutant ER-/progesterone receptor (PR)- and Her2-regular (triple-negative) MDA-MB-231 BCa were exposed to PGG for a comprehensive investigation of cellular consequences and molecular targets/mediators. To test the in vivo efficacy, female athymic mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 xenograft were treated with 20mg PGG/kg body weight by daily gavage starting 4 days after cancer cell inoculation.  Results:   Exposure to PGG induced S-phase arrest in both cell lines as indicated by the lack of 5-bromo2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation into S-phase cells as well as G(1) arrest. Higher levels of PGG induced more caspase-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7, in strong association with induction of P53 Ser(15) phosphorylation, than in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cell cycle arrests were achieved without an induction of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitory proteins P21(Cip1) and P27(Kip1). PGG treatment led to decreased cyclin D1 in both cell lines and over-expressing cyclin D1 attenuated G(1) arrest and hastened S arrest. In serum-starvation synchronized MCF-7 cells, down-regulation of cyclin D1 was associated with de-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein by PGG shortly before G(1)-S transition. In vivo, oral administration of PGG led to a greater than 60% inhibition of MDA-MB231 xenograft growth without adverse effect on host body weight.

This study was undertaken, to gain more insight on the role of PSMA in early prostate cancer and its distribution in various normal tissues.  Methods:   A total of 1,700 different prostate cancers treated by radical prostatectomy and 612 samples from 76 different normal tissue types were successfully analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a tissue microarray (TMA) format. PSMA immunostaining in cancers was also compared with clinical follow-up, preexisting HER2 expression and Ki67 labeling index data.  Results:   PSMA staining was only found in prostate epithelium and expression was higher in cancer cells than in benign tissue. PSMA staining was found in 94.1% of cancers and was significantly associated with tumor stage, high Gleason grade, preoperative PSA, and HER2 expression (P < 0.0001 each). Tumors with strong PSMA expression had a higher risk of biochemical recurrence than cancers with only weak PSMA staining intensity (P = 0.0483). There was no significant association between PSMA expression and Ki67 labeling index (P = 0.442).  Conclusions:   Based on the high frequency of PSMA overexpression in all stages and grades of prostate cancer and the high prevalence of PSMA overexpression, it can be speculated that increased PSMA expression may be related with prostate cancer development rather than progression.

Because DNMT catalysis features attack of cytosine bases by an enzyme thiol group, we tested whether disulfiram (DSF), a thiol-reactive compound with known clinical safety, demonstrated DNMT inhibitory activity.  Methods:   Inhibition of DNMT1 activity by DSF was assessed using methyltransferase activity assays with recombinant DNMT1. Next, prostate cancer cell lines were exposed to DSF and assessed for: i) reduction of global 5-methyl cytosine ((5me)C) content using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); ii) gene-specific promoter demethylation by methylation-specific PCR (MSP); and iii) gene-reactivation by real-time RT-PCR. DSF was also tested for growth inhibition using prostate cancer cell lines propagated in vitro in cell culture and in vivo as xenografts in nude mice.  Results:   Disulfiram showed a dose-dependent inhibition of DNMT1 activity on a hemimethylated DNA substrate. In prostate cancer cells in culture, DSF exposure led to reduction of global genomic (5me)C content, increase in unmethylated APC and RARB gene promoters, and associated re-expression of these genes, but did not significantly alter prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression. DSF significantly inhibited growth and clonogenic survival of prostate cancer cell lines in culture and showed a trend for reduced growth of prostate cancer xenografts.

The effect of salvage androgen deprivation therapy (SADT) on the risk of recurrence of prostate cancer is inadequately described by the existing literature. Furthermore, standard Cox regression yields biased estimates of the effect of SADT, since it is necessary to adjust for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is a time-dependent confounder and an intermediate variable. In this paper, we describe and compare two methods which appropriately adjust for PSA in estimating the effect of SADT. The first method is a two-stage method which jointly estimates the effect of SADT and the hazard of recurrence in the absence of treatment by SADT. In the first stage, PSA is predicted in the absence of SADT, and in the second stage, a time-dependent Cox model is used to estimate the benefit of SADT, adjusting for PSA. The second method, called sequential stratification, reorganizes the data to resemble a sequence of experiments in which treatment is conditionally randomized given the time-dependent covariates. Strata are formed, each consisting of a patient undergoing SADT and a set of appropriately matched controls, and analysis proceeds via stratified Cox regression. Both methods are applied to data from patients initially treated with radiation therapy for prostate cancer and give similar SADT effect estimates.""","""['Edward H Kennedy', 'Jeremy M G Taylor', 'Douglas E Schaubel', 'Scott Williams']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Impact of Early Salvage Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Localized Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis.', 'Less advanced disease at initiation of salvage androgen deprivation therapy is associated with decreased mortality following biochemical failure post-salvage radiation therapy.', 'Use of androgen deprivation therapy as salvage treatment after primary therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Survival outcomes in men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy as primary or salvage treatment for localized or advanced prostate cancer: 20-year single-centre experience.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Does Long-Term Post-Bariatric Weight Change Differ Across Antidepressants?', 'The Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Long-term Depression Treatment in Patients With Obesity.', 'Protocol: mixed-methods study of how implementation of US state medical cannabis laws affects treatment of chronic non-cancer pain and adverse opioid outcomes.', 'Association of Bariatric Surgical Procedures With Changes in Unhealthy Alcohol Use Among US Veterans.', 'Long-term opioid use after bariatric surgery.']"""

Methodology/principal findings:   FAAH immunoreactivity (FAAH-IR) was assessed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded non-malignant and tumour cores from 412 patients with prostate cancer. CB(1) receptor immunoreactivity (CB(1)IR) scores were available for this dataset. FAAH-IR was seen in epithelial cells and blood vessel walls but not in the stroma. Tumour epithelial FAAH-IR was positively correlated with the disease severity at diagnosis (Gleason score, tumour stage, % of the specimen that contained tumour) for cases with mid-range CB(1)IR scores, but not for those with high CB(1)IR scores. For the 281 cases who only received palliative therapy at the end stages of the disease, a high tumour epithelial FAAH-IR was associated with a poor disease-specific survival. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses indicated that FAAH-IR gave additional prognostic information to that provided by CB(1)IR when a midrange, but not a high CB(1)IR cutoff value was used. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor IR was found on tumour epithelial cells and incubation of prostate cancer PC-3 and R3327 AT1 cells with IL-4 increased their FAAH activity.  Conclusions/significance:   Tumour epithelial FAAH-IR is associated with prostate cancer severity and outcome at mid-range, but not high, CB(1)IR scores.

Over a median follow-up of 20 months (range, 3 to 46 months), BCR developed in 15 patients (11.2%) and median time to BCR was 7 months (range, 3 to 25 months). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference between those positive or negative for PSMA in terms of recurrence-free actuarial probability (log rank P=0.0039). Multivariate analysis showed that positivity for PSMA mRNA (HR: 3.697, 95% CI 1.285-10.634, P=0.015) and a biopsy Gleason score of >or=7 (HR: 4.500, 95% CI 1.419-14.274, P=0.011) were independent preoperative predictors of BCR.

Methods:   Data on recent use of two frequently ingested NSAIDs, aspirin and ibuprofen, were collected at baseline from participants aged 55-74 years in the 10 centers of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Participants randomized to the intervention arm of the trial received a flexible sigmoidoscopy during a baseline examination. Follow-up of detected polyps was accomplished outside the Trial setting and relevant records were sought and abstracted. Cases (n=4,017) included subjects with a biopsy-proven polyp in the left side of the colon (descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum) detected as a consequence of PLCO screening; controls (n=38,396) were subjects with no left-sided colon polyp.  Results:   Regular use of aspirin (≥ 4 times/month) in the past year was inversely associated with hyperplastic polyps (odds ratios (OR)=0.8, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.7-0.9), adenomatous polyps (OR=0.8, 95% CI=0.8-0.9), and advanced adenomas (OR=0.8, 95% CI=0.7-0.9). As frequency of aspirin use increased, the prevalence of polyps decreased significantly for each histological classification (P for trend ≤ 0.0004). Similar patterns were found for adenomas and ibuprofen. Overall protection was consistent in both the descending colon or sigmoid and the rectum, but more evident in males. In males, the OR for heavy use of combined aspirin and ibuprofen (≥ 2 times/day) was 0.6 (95% CI=0.5-0.8), as opposed to 0.9 (95% CI=0.8-1.1) in females. The protective effects of NSAIDs for females were apparent only among those with body mass index (BMI) <25 (OR=0.8, 95% CI=0.7-1.0 for regular use of NSAIDs; P interaction=0.04). We also found a slightly stronger protection of NSAIDs in the 70-74 years age group compared with those aged 55-69 years.  Conclusions:   This study of a large general risk population supports previous work that recent use of aspirin and ibuprofen is associated with a decreased risk of colorectal adenomas and demonstrates that this protective effect may be stronger in certain population subgroups and is also evident for aspirin and hyperplastic polyps.""","""['Christine Cole Johnson', 'Richard B Hayes', 'Robert E Schoen', 'Marc J Gunter', 'Wen-Yi Huang;PLCO Trial Team']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Am J Gastroenterol""","""['Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer: systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia-related outcomes and nocturia in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Interaction of calcium supplementation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the risk of colorectal adenomas.', 'Colorectal polyp prevention by daily aspirin use is abrogated among active smokers.', 'Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents.', 'Potential Factors Predicting Histopathologically Upgrade Discrepancies between Endoscopic Forceps Biopsy of the Colorectal Low-Grade Intraepithelial Neoplasia and Endoscopic Resection Specimens.', 'Aspirin, ibuprofen, and reduced risk of advanced colorectal adenoma incidence and recurrence and colorectal cancer in the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Evaluation of Aspirin Use With Cancer Incidence and Survival Among Older Adults in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Two Isoforms of the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor, Daple/CCDC88C Cooperate as Tumor Suppressors.', 'Underlying Causes and Therapeutic Targeting of the Inflammatory Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Docetaxel is an approved chemotherapy for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer; however, the mechanism underlying the action of this tubulin-targeting drug is not fully understood. This study investigates the contribution of microtubules and the cytoskeleton to androgen-mediated signaling and the consequences of their inhibition on AR activity in human prostate cancer. Tissue microarrays from docetaxel-treated and untreated prostate cancer patients were comparatively analyzed for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and AR immunoreactivity. The AR transcriptional activity was determined in prostate cancer cells in vitro, based on PSA mRNA expression and the androgen response element reporter activity. The interaction of AR with tubulin was examined by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Treatment of prostate cancer patients with docetaxel led to a significant translocation of AR. In untreated specimens, 50% prostate tumor cells exhibited nuclear accumulation of AR, compared with docetaxel-treated tumors that had significantly depleted nuclear AR (38%), paralleled by an increase in cytosolic AR. AR nuclear localization correlated with PSA expression. In vitro, exposure of prostate cancer cells to paclitaxel (1 μmol/L) or nocodazole (5 μg/mL) inhibited androgen-dependent AR nuclear translocation by targeting AR association with tubulin. Introduction of a truncated AR indicated the requirement of the NH(2)-terminal domain for AR-tubulin interaction. Our findings show that in addition to blocking cell division, docetaxel impairs AR signaling, evidence that enables new insights into the therapeutic efficacy of microtubule-targeting drugs in prostate cancer.""","""['Meng-Lei Zhu', 'Craig M Horbinski', 'Mark Garzotto', 'David Z Qian', 'Tomasz M Beer', 'Natasha Kyprianou']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Inhibition of the androgen receptor as a novel mechanism of taxol chemotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Activity of docetaxel with or without estramustine phosphate versus mitoxantrone in androgen dependent and independent human prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Docetaxel down-regulates the expression of androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen but not prostate-specific membrane antigen in prostate cancer cell lines: implications for PSA surrogacy.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Progression of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: impact of therapeutic intervention in the post-docetaxel space.', 'Crosstalk between Microtubule Stabilizing Agents and Prostate Cancer.', 'Synthetic biology-inspired cell engineering in diagnosis, treatment, and drug development.', 'Cabazitaxel-Loaded Nanoparticles Reduce the Invasiveness in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells: Beyond the Classical Taxane Function.', 'Vinyl azides in organic synthesis: an overview.', 'Development of machine learning classifiers to predict compound activity on prostate cancer cell lines.']"""

We herein report that a 28-mer peptide, SPI, derived from the Stat3 SH2 domain, replicates Stat3 biochemical properties. Studies show SPI and Stat3 (or Stat3 SH2 domain) bind with similar affinities to known Stat3-binding phosphotyrosine (pY) peptide motifs, including those of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the high-affinity, IL-6R/gp130-derived pY-peptide, GpYLPQTV-NH(2). Consequently, SPI functions as a potent and selective inhibitor of Stat3 SH2 domain:pTyr interactions and disrupts the binding of Stat3 to the IL-6R/gp130 peptide, GpYLPQTV-NH(2). Fluorescence imaging and immunofluorescence staining/laser-scanning confocal microscopy show SPI is cell membrane-permeable, associates with the cytoplasmic tail of EGFR in NIH3T3/hEGFR, and is present in the cytoplasm, but strongly localized at the plasma membrane and in the nucleus in malignant cells harboring persistently active Stat3. Moreover, SPI specifically blocks constitutive Stat3 phosphorylation, DNA binding activity, and transcriptional function in malignant cells, with little or no effect on the induction of Stat1, Stat5, and Erk1/2(MAPK) pathways, or on general pTyr profile at the concentrations that inhibit Stat3 activity. Significantly, treatment with SPI of human breast, pancreatic, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancer cells harboring constitutively active Stat3 induced extensive morphology changes, associated with viability loss and apoptosis. Our study identifies SPI as a novel molecular probe for interrogating Stat3 signaling and that functions as a selective inhibitor of Stat3 activation with antitumor cell effects.""","""['Wei Zhao', 'Soumya Jaganathan', 'James Turkson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['A novel small-molecule disrupts Stat3 SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions and Stat3-dependent tumor processes.', 'Novel peptidomimetic inhibitors of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 dimerization and biological activity.', 'Phosphotyrosyl peptides block Stat3-mediated DNA binding activity, gene regulation, and cell transformation.', 'STAT 3 as a target for cancer drug discovery.', 'Increasing the range of drug targets: interacting peptides provide leads for the development of oncoprotein inhibitors.', 'The Role of Natural Products as Inhibitors of JAK/STAT Signaling Pathways in Glioblastoma Treatment.', 'Analysis of CF patient survival confirms STAT3 as a CF-modifying gene with changing impact over time.', 'STAT family of transcription factors in breast cancer: Pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities and challenges.', 'SHF Acts as a Novel Tumor Suppressor in Glioblastoma Multiforme by Disrupting STAT3 Dimerization.', 'Novel STAT3 Inhibitors Targeting STAT3 Dimerization by Binding to the STAT3 SH2 Domain.']"""

Patients and methods:   Twentyone patients indicated for prostate bed radiotherapy were considered in this study. Here we present the preliminary results of 10 of them. Four patients were indicated for adjuvant, 6 for salvage radiotherapy. All the patients underwent, besides standard planning CT, MRI in the same position. Target volumes and organs at risk were delineated into CT,T1 and T2 MRI images - clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (PTV), urinary bladder and rectum. Based on the merging of images, the volumes delineated in MRI were copied into planning CT, where the evaluation was done. We evaluated the volumes of each structure, agreement in contouring with the help of the rate of union and intersection of the volumes and with Cohen's kappa, and 3D differences between volumes of CTV on CT, T1 and T2 MRI.  Results:   Statistically, volumes of CTV and PTV are not significantly different. The volume of the rectum is significantly smaller on T1 and also T2 MRI images. The index of agreement (union/intersection) is statistically significantly different from 1 for CTV and PTV as well. Cohen's kappa indicates moderate agreement for CTV CT and T1, T1 and T2 MRI, fair agreement for CTV CT and T2 MRI, and substantial agreement for PTV. In the superior and superolateral direction, the CTV volume on MRI in the central plane is smaller on T1 and T2 images. In the area of seminal vesicles (SV) the cranial border is similar on CT and MRI. In the superoposterior direction, the volume of CTV is smaller on CT than on T1 and T2 MRI, which means, that seminal vesicles are delineated larger in the posterior direction on MRI (about 0.24cm on T1; by about 0.20cm on T2 images). In the posterior direction, there are no differences in CTV on CT and T1 while on T2 the CTV is larger (a difference of 0.29 cm). In the posterolateral direction, CTV is smaller on T1 MRI than on CT on both sides, on the right as well as on the left.  Conclusion:   Preliminary results suggest that clinical target volume defined with the help of MRI is shifted compared with CTV defined on planning CT. The agreement of CTV delineation by one radiation oncologist is moderate to fair and is similar to interobserver variability in the contouring of the prostate bed in the planning CT. MRI provides more contrast imaging of the anterior rectal wall, where we have confirmed the most differences in contouring. Moreover, it provides better imaging of local recurrences and seminal vesicles, where the most differences in our group of patients were seen in comparison with planning CT.""","""['J Sefrová', 'Paluska', 'K Odrázka', 'Z Belobradek', 'P Hoffmann', 'P Prosvic', ""M Brod'ák"", 'M Louda', 'Z Macingová', 'M Vosmik']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Klin Onkol""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging in postprostatectomy radiotherapy planning.', 'Anatomic variations due to radical prostatectomy.

However, it is unclear exactly where and how often failures occur in the results management process. Our goal was to determine where breakdowns occur by examining 4 high-risk abnormal test results in a group of 11 clinics of an urban community health center organization.  Methods:   Using a chart audit, we counted failures in the management of abnormal results of 4 tests: Pap smears, mammograms, international normalized ratio (INR), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). We assessed documentation that the result was filed in the chart; the provider signed and responded to the result; the patient was notified of the result; the appropriate follow-up occurred, and it occurred in a timely manner or there was explicit patient refusal of the recommended follow-up.  Results:   There were 344 abnormal test results (105 Pap smears, 82 mammograms, 61 INRs, and 96 PSAs). The highest rate of failures in the management process was at follow-up care; 34% of the abnormal results did not have documentation that appropriate follow-up had occurred (11% for mammography, 26% for INR, 45% for Pap smears, and 46% for PSA). All of the earlier steps were performed with far fewer failures. For patients receiving follow-up care, 49% of the time, follow-up care did not occur in a timely manner.  Conclusions:   Most breakdowns in the testing process for these 4 abnormal tests were in the final step, documenting that appropriate follow-up care occurred.

The recurrence and the metastasis of PCa are tightly linked with the biology of prostate cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells that is reminiscent of the acquisition of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) phenotype. Increasing evidence suggests that EMT-type cells share many biological characteristics with cancer stem-like cells.  Methodology/principal findings:   In this study, we found that PCa cells with EMT phenotype displayed stem-like cell features characterized by increased expression of Sox2, Nanog, Oct4, Lin28B and/or Notch1, consistent with enhanced clonogenic and sphere (prostasphere)-forming ability and tumorigenecity in mice, which was associated with decreased expression of miR-200 and/or let-7 family. Reversal of EMT by re-expression of miR-200 inhibited prostasphere-forming ability of EMT-type cells and reduced the expression of Notch1 and Lin28B. Down-regulation of Lin28B increased let-7 expression, which was consistent with repressed self-renewal capability.  Conclusions/significance:   These results suggest that miR-200 played a pivotal role in linking the characteristics of cancer stem-like cells with EMT-like cell signatures in PCa. Selective elimination of cancer stem-like cells by reversing the EMT phenotype to Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (MET) phenotype using novel agents would be useful for the prevention of tumor recurrence especially by eliminating those cells that are the ""Root Cause"" of tumor development and recurrence.""","""['Dejuan Kong', 'Sanjeev Banerjee', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Yiwei Li', 'Zhiwei Wang', 'Seema Sethi', 'Fazlul H Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['miR-200 regulates PDGF-D-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition, adhesion, and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'Different Effects of BORIS/CTCFL on Stemness Gene Expression, Sphere Formation and Cell Survival in Epithelial Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Double-negative feedback loop between ZEB2 and miR-145 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem cell properties in prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cells: a coalition against cancer therapies.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'The Molecular and Cellular Strategies of Glioblastoma and Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells Conferring Radioresistance.', 'The systemic-level repercussions of cancer-associated inflammation mediators produced in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Cannabidiol inhibits invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer cells by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'LIN28 Family in Testis: Control of Cell Renewal, Maturation, Fertility and Aging.']"""

We propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be efficiently tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles by employing Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. Methods based on Information Theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells' transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. The relevance of the proposed methods can be evaluated using microarray datasets available in the public domain but the method is in principle applicable to other high-throughput methods.  Methodology/principal findings:   Using melanoma and prostate cancer datasets we illustrate how it is possible to employ Shannon Entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence to trace the transcriptional changes progression of the disease. We establish how the variations of these two measures correlate with established biomarkers of cancer progression. The Information Theory measures allow us to identify novel biomarkers for both progressive and relatively more sudden transcriptional changes leading to malignant phenotypes. At the same time, the methodology was able to validate a large number of genes and processes that seem to be implicated in the progression of melanoma and prostate cancer.  Conclusions/significance:   We thus present a quantitative guiding rule, a new unifying hallmark of cancer: the cancer cell's transcriptome changes lead to measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values (as measured by high-throughput technologies). At the same time, tumor cells increment their divergence from the normal tissue profile increasing their disorder via creation of states that we might not directly measure. This unifying hallmark allows, via the the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the processes from the gene expression profiles, and helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes. The deep mathematical basis of the approach allows us to suggest that this principle is, hopefully, of general applicability for other diseases.""","""['Regina Berretta', 'Pablo Moscato']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Integrative analysis reveals disease-associated genes and biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.', 'Quantitative network measures as biomarkers for classifying prostate cancer disease states: a systems approach to diagnostic biomarkers.', 'Immunological network signatures of cancer progression and survival.', 'Microarrays--identifying molecular portraits for prostate tumors with different Gleason patterns.', 'Applicability of spatial transcriptional profiling to cancer research.', 'Recent Advances in Plasma-Engineered Polymers for Biomarker-Based Viral Detection and Highly Multiplexed Analysis.', 'Biomaterial Scaffolds Recruit an Aggressive Population of Metastatic Tumor Cells In Vivo.', 'Basal-like breast cancer: molecular profiles, clinical features and survival outcomes.', 'Big data for big questions: it is time for data analysts to act.', 'Measuring intratumor heterogeneity by network entropy using RNA-seq data.']"""

Daily patient treatment totals and practice characteristics were queried. To date, there is no actual data to elucidate the motivation of radiation oncologists to form such an association.  Results:   All 75 respondents indicated that their practice model was a multispecialty group, in which the radiation oncologist has an employment agreement to receive the professional component for radiation treatment services, and was also a financial partner in the technical component. All respondents were economically displaced in a geographic region by existing radiation oncology groups, hospital-based radiation oncology practice, or both. All radiation oncologist respondents stated that they were unable to achieve professional partnership status within a radiation oncology group, and 98.6% were unable to obtain a share of the technical component for radiation treatment. Eighty-six percent of respondents treated patients with nonprostate malignancies in their facility, at a rate of 1.9 times more nonprostate patients than prostate patients.

This study was undertaken to evaluate differential localization and expression of two major transcripts of Oct-4, viz. Oct-4A and Oct-4B, in adult human testis. A novel population of 5- to 10-μm PSCs with nuclear Oct-4A was identified by ISH and immunolocalization studies.

A(dark) spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) were visualized in pairs and chains undergoing clonal expansion and stained positive for cytoplasmic Oct-4B. Quantitative PCR and Western blotting revealed both the transcripts, with higher expression of Oct-4B. It is proposed that PSCs undergo asymmetric cell division and give rise to A(dark) SSCs, which proliferate and initiate lineage-specific differentiation. The darkly stained nuclei in A(dark) SSCs may represent extensive nuclear reprogramming by epigenetic changes when a PSC becomes committed.

Among 42 organoselenium compounds tested, two compounds, 3-selena-1-dethiacephem 13 and 3-selena-1-dethiacephem 14 strongly activated the Nrf2/ARE (antioxidant response element) signaling and thus markedly increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a phase II antioxidant enzyme. Translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus preceded HO-1 protein induction by two compounds. The intracellular ROS level was strongly reduced immediately after treatment with these compounds, showing that they are potent antioxidants. Finally, both compounds inhibited cell growth via cell cycle arrest.

Case report:   We report the case of a 59-year-old man with a 2-year history of three large areas of persistent and asymptomatic livid erythema on trunk and flanks. These areas blanched under light pressure. Measurement of the surface temperature of the patch revealed a decrease of up to 2.5 degrees C with respect to surrounding skin. Histology showed superficial dermal capillary dilatation without other significant findings. The fixed nature of the lesions, consistent histopathology, and the finding of localized hypothermia allowed the diagnosis of nevus oligemicus.  Conclusions:   The diagnosis is mainly clinical. Our case is the eleventh case of nevus oligemicus reported in the literature.""","""['Leticia Sempau', 'Teresa Alonso-Alonso', 'Asunción González-Morán', 'Camino Prada', 'Marta Lamoca-Martín', 'Manuel Angel Rodríguez-Prieto']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Dermatol Online J""","""['Six cases of nevus oligemicus.', 'Nevus oligemicus: a case series.', 'Nevus oligemicus.

Blocking EET synthesis by a selective CYP epoxygenase inhibitor (N-methylsulfonyl-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl)hexanamide [MS-PPOH]) inhibited tonic (basal) invasion and migration (motility) while exogenously added EET induced cell motility in a concentration-dependent manner. An epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor (AG494) or a PI3 kinase inhibitor (LY294002) inhibited cell migration and reduced 11,12-EET-induced cell migration.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The risks of delayed radical prostatectomy for men who progress on active surveillance are largely unknown. Two series have reported that prostatectomy after active surveillance has similar results to immediate therapy. Our data add to this growing body of evidence that appropriately selected men with prostate cancer can undergo active surveillance with delayed prostatectomy without added risk of missing an opportunity for cure as the majority of tumours remain organ confined.  Objective:   • To compare the pathological outcomes of men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) after a period of active surveillance (AS) with those of a similar risk group undergoing immediate surgery.  Patients and methods:   • We identified men through our institutional database who underwent RP within 6 months of diagnosis or after a period of AS. The primary outcome of the present study was Gleason upgrade to ≥7 after prostatectomy. • Pathological stage and positive surgical margin rate were assessed as secondary outcomes. Binomial logistic regression models were used to determine associations of treatment subgroups with pathological upgrade, upstage and positive margins.  Results:   • Thirty-three men with initially low-risk cancer features underwent RP after a median (range) of 18 (7-76) months of AS. A total of 278 men with low-risk disease features underwent immediate RP within 6 months of diagnosis. Rates of Gleason upgrading to ≥7, pathological category pT3 and positive surgical margins did not differ significantly from the immediate RP group. • On multivariate analysis of low-risk patients, adjusting for baseline pathological features, treatment group (AS followed by prostatectomy vs immediate prostatectomy) was not associated with Gleason upgrading (odds ratio, OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.12-1.04), non-organ-confined disease (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.32-8.65) or positive surgical margins at prostatectomy (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.16-5.76).

We evaluated clinicopathologic findings that are associated with SVI to select patients for potential seminal vesicle-sparing surgery.  Patients and methods:   We reviewed our radical prostatectomy database from 1997 to 2006 to evaluate the incidence and clinical correlates of SVI. Variables analyzed included serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical stage, percentage of positive cores with cancer, Gleason score on biopsy, age, prostate weight, and urethral and vesical surgical margins. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate logistic regressions.  Results:   Of 267 patients, 32 (12%) had SVI. Preoperative PSA level, biopsy Gleason score, and percentage of positive cores were highly predictive of SVI on multivariate analysis.

The Ablatherm Maxis and the Integrated Imaging devices were used. The sites of BOO were recorded.  Results:   Median follow-up after HIFU was 52 months (range 24-80 mos). BOO developed in 58 (25.66%) patients. Repeated BOO episodes were observed in 27 (11.94%), three to seven episodes in 13 (5.75%) patients. Patients with repeated BOO were older than patients with singular BOO (71.75 ± 4.97 vs 68.18 ± 5.03; P = 0.024).

Curcumin has been found to have a wide range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activities. Curcumin is currently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of various types of cancers, including multiple myeloma, pancreatic cancer and colon cancer. Although no toxicity associated with curcumin (even at very high doses) has been observed, the effects of curcumin in other solid tumors have been modest, primarily due to poor water solubility and poor bioavailability in tissues remote from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, there is a need for the discovery of curcumin analogs with better water solubility or greater bioavailability for the treatment of solid tumors such as prostate cancer. In this study, curcumin acetates and amino acid conjugates of curcumin were studied in terms of their proteasome inhibitory and antiproliferative effects against several human cancer cell lines. It was found that the water soluble amino acid conjugates of curcumin showed a potent antiproliferative effect and are potent proteasome inhibitors. Docking studies of the curcumin amino acid conjugates for proteasome inhibition were carried out to explain their biological activities. It is suggested that they may serve as the water soluble analogs of curcumin.""","""['Sheng Biao Wan', 'Huanjie Yang', 'Zhongyuan Zhou', 'Qiuzhi Cindy Cui', 'Di Chen', 'Jyoti Kanwar', 'Imthiyaz Mohammad', 'Q Ping Dou', 'Tak Hang Chan']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Synthesis and biological evaluation of curcumin derivatives modified with α-amino boronic acid as proteasome inhibitors.', 'Curcumin inhibits the proteasome activity in human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'A New Water-Soluble Nanomicelle Formed through Self-Assembly of Pectin-Curcumin Conjugates: Preparation, Characterization, and Anticancer Activity Evaluation.', 'Natural compounds with proteasome inhibitory activity for cancer prevention and treatment.', 'Curcumin: from ancient medicine to current clinical trials.', 'Evolution of Natural Product Scaffolds as Potential Proteasome Inhibitors in Developing Cancer Therapeutics.', ""Enhancing curcumin's solubility and antibiofilm activity via silica surface modification."", 'Synthesis of new curcumin-based aminocarbonitrile derivatives incorporating 4H-pyran and 1,4-dihydropyridine heterocycles.', 'Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system for cancer treatment: discovering novel inhibitors from nature and drug repurposing.', 'Up-Regulatory Effects of Curcumin on Large Conductance Ca2+-Activated K+ Channels.']"""

Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5/ARA55) is a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)-induced coactivator of androgen receptor (AR) expressed in the prostate stroma. Interestingly, following castration, we identified epithelial expression of Hic-5/ARA55 in mouse and human prostate tissues. To determine the role of epithelial Hic-5 in prostate cancer progression and castration responsiveness, we compared LNCaP cells having Hic-5 stably expressed with the parental LNCaP cells following tissue recombination xenografts with mouse prostate stromal cells. We previously identified knocking out prostate stromal TGF-β signaling potentiated castrate-resistant prostate tumors, in a Wnt-dependent manner. The LNCaP chimeric tumors containing prostate fibroblasts conditionally knocked out for the TGF-β type II receptor (Tgfbr2-KO) resulted in larger, more invasive, and castration-resistant tumors compared those with floxed (control) stromal cells. However, the LNCaP-Hic5 associated with Tgfbr2-KO fibroblasts generated chimeric tumors with reduced tumor volume, lack of invasion and restored castration dependence. Neutralization of canonical Wnt signaling is shown to reduce prostate tumor size and restore regression following castration. Thus, we hypothesized that epithelial Hic-5/ARA55 expression negatively regulated Wnt signaling. The mechanism of the Hic-5/ARA55 effects on castration was determined by analysis of the c-myc promoter. C-myc luciferase reporter activity suggested Hic-5/ARA55 expression inhibited c-myc activity by β-catenin. Sequential ChIP analysis indicated β-catenin and T-cell-specific 4 (TCF4) bound the endogenous c-myc promoter in the absence of Hic-5 expression. However, the formation of a TCF4/Hic-5 repressor complex inhibited c-myc promoter activity, by excluding β-catenin binding with TCF4 on the promoter. The data indicate Hic-5/ARA55 expression in response to castration-enabled epithelial regression through the repression of c-myc gene at the chromatin level.""","""['X Li', 'M Martinez-Ferrer', 'V Botta', 'C Uwamariya', 'J Banerjee', 'N A Bhowmick']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Hic-5/ARA55, a LIM domain-containing nuclear receptor coactivator expressed in prostate stromal cells.', 'Stromal transforming growth factor-beta signaling mediates prostatic response to androgen ablation by paracrine Wnt activity.', 'Mechanism of action of Hic-5/androgen receptor activator 55, a LIM domain-containing nuclear receptor coactivator.', 'Hic-5/ARA55: a prostate stroma-specific AR coactivator.', 'Interplay Between SOX9, Wnt/β-Catenin and Androgen Receptor Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Physiological and pathological roles of\xa0Hic‑5 in several organs (Review).', 'Antagonizing Glutamine Bioavailability Promotes Radiation Sensitivity in Prostate Cancer.', 'SOX4: The unappreciated oncogene.', 'A Targeted Bivalent Androgen Receptor Binding Compound for Prostate Cancer Therapy.']"""

The prognostic significance of plasma chromogranin-A (CgA) was assessed in a series of consecutive patients with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa).  Patients and methods:   Twenty-three patients presenting high-risk PCa and 8 healthy individuals, as control group, had their blood samples collected to evaluate CgA, free and total prostate specific antigen, and free and total testosterone in a pilot study. The correlations of serum CgA levels with PSA, testosterone, Gleason score, number of foci of hypercaptation in bone scan, age, and outcomes were evaluated at baseline and after 12 months.  Results:   Patients with PCa had significantly higher levels of plasma CgA (mean, 8.7; range, 1.9-73) than healthy patients (mean, 3.45; range, 0.6-5.6), P = 0.02. Analyzing only the patients group through correlation of the ranks, it was observed that CgA has low, insignificant correlations with PSA (P = 0.07) and with metastatic extension (P = 0.09). No association was found between the plasma CgA levels and the Gleason score (P = 0.20), age (P = 0.15), or disease progression (P = 0.27).  Conclusion:   The serum levels of CgA were significantly increased in the group with PCa compared with the healthy group. However, there were low correlations between serum CgA and known prognostic factors (such as total and free PSA, age, Gleason score, and bone metastases) or clinical deterioration. Although future studies are needed with larger samples and longer follow-up, the presented data envisage a limited role to serum CgA as high-risk PCa prognostic factor.""","""['Leonardo O Reis', 'Larissa F M Vieira', 'Emerson L Zani', 'Fernandes Denardi', 'Laurione C de Oliveira', 'Ubirajara Ferreira']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Investig Med""","""['Independent prognostic role of circulating chromogranin A in prostate cancer patients with hormone-refractory disease.', 'The chromogranin-A (CgA) in prostate cancer.', 'Distribution of high chromogranin A serum levels in patients with nonmetastatic and metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Prognostic value of serum markers for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation and clinical value of neuroendocrine differentiation in human prostatic tumors.', 'An Update on the Prognostic and Predictive Serum Biomarkers in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Chromogranin A (CgA) as poor prognostic factor in patients with small cell carcinoma of the cervix: results of a retrospective study of 293 patients.', 'N-acetyltransferase-2 gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer susceptibility in Latin American patients.', 'Review of small cell carcinomas of the prostate.', 'Old issues and new perspectives on prostate cancer hormonal therapy: the molecular substratum.']"""

Profiling DNA methylation patterns across the genome is vital to understand DNA methylation changes that occur during development and in disease phenotype. In this study, we compared two commonly used approaches to enrich for methylated DNA regions of the genome, namely methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) that is based on enrichment with antibodies specific for 5'-methylcytosine (5MeC), and capture of methylated DNA using a methyl-CpG binding domain-based (MBD) protein to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in cancer. The enriched methylated DNA fractions were interrogated on Affymetrix promoter tiling arrays and differentially methylated regions were identified. A detailed validation study of 42 regions was performed using Sequenom MassCLEAVE technique. This detailed analysis revealed that both enrichment techniques are sensitive for detecting DMRs and preferentially identified different CpG rich regions of the prostate cancer genome, with MeDIP commonly enriching for methylated regions with a low CpG density, while MBD capture favors regions of higher CpG density and identifies the greatest proportion of CpG islands. This is the first detailed validation report comparing different methylated DNA enrichment techniques for identifying regions of differential DNA methylation.

Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were estimated. Risk factors for biochemical failure and death were evaluated. Late toxicity and quality of life were evaluated.

Cancer detection rates were compared between the 2 protocols in univariate and multivariate analyses with results expressed as odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Characteristics of cancer detected were also compared. Sensitivity analyses were performed for different population subgroups.  Results:   The overall positive biopsy rate was 49.9%, 51.2% in the 8-core group and 49.2% in the 12-core group.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 119 men who had undergone 140 BAS procedures for SUI from May 2000 to May 2009 at our institution. All complications were recorded during the follow-up visits. Pad test and questionnaire results were recorded, as available.  Results:   BAS was performed in 140 cases for 119 men with SUI. Mean patient age was 65.8 years (range 23-89). Main etiologies for SUI included previous treatment of prostate cancer (82.4%), neurologic dysfunction (12.6%), and previous transurethral resection of the prostate (3.6%). Recurrent SUI, de novo urge incontinence, and wound infection were the most frequent complications encountered (25.2%, 17.6%, and 16%, respectively). The 3 most common reasons for reoperation included bulking agent injection for recurrent SUI (5.9%), sling revision for bone screw dislodgement (5.9%), and sling revision for recurrent SUI (5.0%). Overall complication and reoperation rate for the index cases was 58.8% and 26.9%, respectively.  Conclusions:   The incidence of complications after male BAS placement might be greater than previously reported. Patient counseling before surgery regarding the potential complications is important. Men treated for prostate cancer should be informed of the risk of recurrent SUI. In appropriately selected patients, we believe the BAS is a reasonable surgical option; however, the risk of postoperative complication is not equivocal.""","""['Nicholas R Styn', 'Edward J McGuire', 'Jerilyn M Latini']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Safety and efficacy of sling for persistent stress urinary incontinence after bulking injection.', 'Recurrent stress urinary incontinence after dislodged screws in patient with bone-anchored suburethral sling.', 'Surgery insight: management of failed sling surgery for female stress urinary incontinence.', 'An adjustable sling for the treatment of all degrees of male stress urinary incontinence: retrospective evaluation of efficacy and complications after a minimal followup of 14 months.', 'Complications of mid urethral slings: important outcomes for future clinical trials.', 'The role of synthetic slings in male stress incontinence.', 'Pedicled rectus abdominis muscle and fascia flap sling the bulbar urethra for treatment for male-acquired urinary incontinence: report of ten cases.', 'Simultaneous penile prosthesis and male sling/artificial urinary sphincter.', 'Combination surgery for erectile dysfunction and male incontinence.']"""

High stathmin levels have been associated with the development of resistance to the widely used anti-cancer drug taxol ((®)Taxol, paclitaxel). The mechanisms of stathmin-mediated taxol resistance are not well-understood at the molecular level. To better understand the role of stathmin in taxol resistance, we stably overexpressed stathmin twofold in BT549 human breast cancer cells and characterized several cell processes involved in the mechanism of action of taxol. After stable overexpression of stathmin, neither the cell doubling time nor the mitotic index was altered and the microtubule polymer mass was reduced only modestly (by 18%). Unexpectedly, microtubule dynamicity was reduced by 29% after stathmin overexpression, resulting primarily from reduction in the catastrophe frequency. Sensitivity to taxol was reduced significantly (by 44%) in a clonogenic assay, and stathmin appeared to protect the cells from the spindle-damaging effects of taxol. The results suggest that in the stably stathmin-overexpressing clones, compensatory gene expression occurred that resulted in normal rates of cell proliferation and prevented the increase in catastrophe frequency expected in response to stathmin. Stathmin overexpression protected the cells from taxol-induced abnormal mitoses, and thus induced taxol resistance.

DTX was loaded inside micelles (DTX-TR(m) and DTX-ST(m)) with high efficiency and released slowly for more than two weeks. DTX-loaded micelles based on both copolymers had very similar properties in terms of mean size, zeta potential, loading ability and release rate in buffered saline. However, the stability of DTX-ST(m) was very poor in aqueous media with proteins resulting in a strong and progressive aggregation. We studied the effect of increasing concentrations of free DTX or DTX-loaded micelles on growth inhibition of human breast MCF-7 and MDA-MB468 and prostate PC3 and DU145 adenocarcinoma cell lines. DTX-loaded TR micelles induced cell growth inhibition similarly to free DTX whereas DTX-ST(m) showed lower cytotoxicity. On the other hand, by normalizing IC(50) values for the actual amount of DTX released from micelles in the medium, DTX-loaded ST micelles became more active than free DTX in all cell lines tested. Both free DTX and DTX-loaded TR micelles displayed a significantly lower cytotoxic activity in G(2)/M phase synchronized cells, whereas cytotoxicity of DTX-loaded ST micelles did not change. Cytotoxicity was related to micelle stability, uptake and release rate in cell culture media.

Materials and methods:   The debate was centered on presentations arguing for radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy as the optimal treatment for this condition. The meeting presentations are summarized by their respective presenters herein.  Results:   Dr. James Eastham presents the varied definitions for ""high-risk"" prostate cancer as strongly influencing which patients end up in this cohort. Based upon this, between 3% and 38% of patients with high-risk features could be defined as ""high-risk"". Despite that, these men do not have a uniformly poor prognosis after RP, and attention to surgical principles as outlined improve outcomes. Disease-specific survival at 12 years is excellent and up to one-half of these men may not need adjuvant or salvage therapies, depending on their specific disease characteristics. Adjuvant or salvage radiotherapies improve outcomes and are part of a sequential approach to treating these patients. Dr. Anthony Zietman presented radiotherapy as the gold-standard based upon large, randomized clinical trials of intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients. Compared with androgen deprivation alone, the addition of radiotherapy provided a 12% cancer-specific survival advantage and 10% overall survival advantage. Dose escalation seems to confer further improvements in cancer control without significant escalation of toxicities, with more data forthcoming.  Conclusions:   There are no randomized trials comparing RP to radiotherapy for any risk category.

Organ-specific animal models are employed to determine which agents or classes of agents are likely to be the most effective at nontoxic doses to prevent organ-specific forms of cancer. These results are then used to target specific organs in high-risk populations in clinical trials. The animal models used are either carcinogen-induced with carcinogens specific for particular organ sites or they are transgenic/mutant animals with insertions, deletions, or mutations at targeted gene sites known to enhance cancers in a specific organ. Animal tumor models with characteristics favorable to chemoprevention studies are available for cancers of the lung, colon, skin, bladder, mammary, prostate, head and neck, esophagus, ovary, and pancreas. In addition to single-agent dose-response testing, such models are frequently used for testing combinations of agents, testing different routes of administration, evaluating surrogate endpoint biomarkers, and generating initial pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. For some of the more standard animal models there is significant correlation with human chemopreventive trial results. There are a growing number of positive human chemoprevention trials that have used agents or combinations that were positive in animal testing. There have been fewer negative human clinical trials, but their results again correlate with negative animal results.

The evaluation of these service screening programs is subject to study design, data availability, and the precise data analysis for adjusting bias. We developed a computer-aided system that allows the evaluation of population-based service screening to unify these aspects and facilitate and guide the program assessor to efficiently perform an evaluation.  Methods:   This system underpins two experimental designs: the posttest-only non-equivalent design and the one-group pretest-posttest design and demonstrates the type of data required at both the population and individual levels. Three major analyses were developed that included a cumulative mortality analysis, survival analysis with lead-time adjustment, and self-selection bias adjustment. We used SAS AF software to develop a graphic interface system with a pull-down menu style.  Results:   We demonstrate the application of this system with data obtained from a Swedish population-based service screen and a population-based randomized controlled trial for the screening of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer, and one service screening program for cervical cancer with Pap smears. The system provided automated descriptive results based on the various sources of available data and cumulative mortality curves corresponding to the study designs. The comparison of cumulative survival between clinically and screen-detected cases without a lead-time adjustment are also demonstrated. The intention-to-treat and noncompliance analysis with self-selection bias adjustments are also shown to assess the effectiveness of the population-based service screening program. Model validation was composed of a comparison between our adjusted self-selection bias estimates and the empirical results on effectiveness reported in the literature.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate a computer-aided system allowing the evaluation of population-based service screening programs with an adjustment for self-selection and lead-time bias.

The laminin G-like domain in all these proteins binds to a unique glycan structure, so-called laminin-binding glycan, attached to alpha-DG with high affinity. Formation of the laminin-binding glycan is required for the BM assembly, and loss or deficiency of the glycan causes muscular dystrophy. We studied the role of this alpha-DG-specific glycan modification in tumor development, and identified a tumor suppressor function of the laminin-binding alpha-DG.

Although several papers have been reported that increased core2 O-glycan is detected with several cancer progression (Dalziel, et al., 2001; Machida, et al., 2001), very little is known about the function of core3 O-glycan in tumorigenesis. Core3 O-glycan is synthesized by beta1, 3-N-acetylglucosamintraseferase 6 (core3 synthase). To understand the function of core3 O-glycan in cancer, ectopic expression of core3 synthase to prostate cancer cells were used for tumor formation assay. Since core3 expressing prostate cancer cells show decreased tumor formation and metastasis to lymph node through attenuating the maturation and heterodimerization of integrin alpha2beta1, those findings indicate that core3 structure acts as tumor suppressor through regulating the integrin functions. In this chapter, we discuss methods used to reveal the mechanisms how core3 glycan act as tumor suppressor.""","""['Seung Ho Lee', 'Minoru Fukuda']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Methods Enzymol""","""['Core3 O-glycan synthase suppresses tumor formation and metastasis of prostate carcinoma PC3 and LNCaP cells through down-regulation of alpha2beta1 integrin complex.', 'Study of the biological functions of mucin type core 3 O-glycans.', 'Core2 O-glycan structure is essential for the cell surface expression of sucrase isomaltase and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV during intestinal cell differentiation.', 'Two opposing roles of O-glycans in tumor metastasis.', 'Roles of mucin-type O-glycans in cell adhesion.']"""

Methods:   The expression vector Id3/pET32a was transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) and expression of histidine (His)-tagged Id3 fusion protein was induced with IPTG and confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot techniques. Id3 fusion protein was purified through immolbilized Ni(2+); absorption chromatographic column.The purified protein was used to immunize rabbits.The titer and specificity of rabbit antisera were evaluated by immunodouble gel diffusion, ELISA and Western blot techniques. The collected rabbit antisera were purified with polypeptide affinity column. The intracellular distributions of Id3 expression in human human breast cancer cells (MCF7), prostate cancer cells (PC-3M) and lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) were observed by indirect immunofluorescence assay(IFA).  Results:   Id3 fusion protein with 6xhis-tag was successfully expressed in E.coli BL 21. The expressed Id3 with the relative molecular mass size of 34 kD was purified specifically through affinity chromatographic column and confirmed by Western blot. The titers of the rabbit anti-Id3 polyclonal antibodies were 1:8 by immunodouble gel diffusion and 1:8 000 by ELISA. Western blot revealed that the prepared antisera reacted specifically with Id3. IFA showed that in A549 , MCF7 and PC-3M cells, Id3 was mainly distributed in nucleoplasm and the Id3 expression level was significantly higher in MCF7 and PC-3M than in A549 cells.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study was based on 264 consecutive patients submitted to radical retropubic prostatectomy. Their NPB were matched with whole-mount processed and totally embedded surgical specimens. Tumor extent on NPB was evaluated as the percentage of linear tissue in mm containing carcinoma in all cores. Considering the median value, patients were stratified into 2 groups: harboring less or more extensive tumors on NPB. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to relate stage > pT2 to PNI and other clinical and pathological variables.  Results:   In patients with more extensive tumors, PNI was predictive of stage > pT2 in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis. In less extensive tumors, PNI showed no association between any clinical or pathological variables studied; no difference in the time to biochemical progression-free status compared to patients without PNI; and, no predictive value for pathological stage > pT2 on both univariate and multivariate analyses.

Our aim was to compare serum VEGF levels across different prostate pathologies (including benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer) in patients at high risk of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We consecutively enrolled 186 subjects with abnormal digital rectal examination and/or total PSA (tPSA) > or = 2.5 ng/mL.

Unconditional logistic regression was used to compute age-, tPSA- and free/total PSA-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between serum VEGF and different prostatic pathologies.  Results:   Prostate biopsy main diagnoses were normal or benign prostatic hyperplasia (27.3%), prostatitis (16.6%), and prostatic cancer (55.0%). The median VEGF levels (ng/mL) in these groups were 178.2, 261.3 and 266.4 (p = 0.029), respectively, but no significant differences were observed for benign vs. malignant pathologies (215.2 vs. 266.4, p = 0.551).

Conclusions:   In patients at high risk of prostate cancer, circulating VEGF levels have no clinical role in deciding which patients should be submitted to prostate biopsy.

We report our early experience using the CyberKnife to deliver a hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) boost to patients with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer. Twenty-four patients were treated with hypofractionated SBRT and supplemental external radiation therapy plus or minus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients were treated with SBRT to a dose of 19.5 Gy in 3 fractions followed by intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Quality of life data were collected with American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaires before and after treatment. PSA responses were monitored; acute urinary and rectal toxicities were assessed using Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) v3. All 24 patients completed the planned treatment with an average follow-up of 9.3 months. For patients who did not receive ADT, the median pre-treatment PSA was 10.6 ng/ml and decreased in all patients to a median of 1.5 ng/ml by 6 months post-treatment. Acute effects associated with treatment included Grade 2 urinary and gastrointestinal toxicity but no patient experienced acute Grade 3 or greater toxicity. AUA and EPIC scores returned to baseline by six months post-treatment. Hypofractionated SBRT combined with IMRT offers radiobiological benefits of a large fraction boost for dose escalation and is a well tolerated treatment option for men with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer.

These were correlated with prostate cancer mortality, in univariate and multivariate analysis including Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Nevertheless, docetaxel resistance frequently appears after several cycles of treatment, raising the problem of salvage treatment for docetaxel-resistant PC patients. Although the combination of docetaxel and estramustine prolongs metastasis-free and overall survival of patients with androgen-independent PC, the use of this modality remains limited in elderly patients or patients with several comorbidities, especially vascular disease or gastrointestinal toxicity, because of unacceptable toxicity including venous thrombosis. The aims of this study were therefore (i) to evaluate the in-vivo efficacy of estramustine combined with docetaxel since initial tumor growth and following the appearance of docetaxel resistance in the androgen-dependent human PC xenograft PAC120, and (ii) to evaluate the efficacy of estramustine in six human androgen-independent PC models derived from PAC120. In docetaxel-resistant tumor-bearing mice, estramustine alone induced a TGD2 of 18 days, whereas the combination of docetaxel and estramustine induced a TGD2 of 50 days (P<0.05) with no significantly different overall survival of mice treated by docetaxel and estramustine since day 1 or since the onset of resistance to docetaxel. Among the six human androgen-independent tumors treated with estramustine alone, two highly sensitive models, two intermediate responding tumors, and two resistant models were observed.

Thus, in this current investigation, to pursue our newly developed anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) in prostate cancer, its inhibitory effect was investigated in PC3 cells. The binding specificity of antibody was examined by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. The cultivated cells were treated with various doses of the anti-EGFR mAb at different time points and the cellular and/or molecular impacts were assessed. MTT assay was utilized to examine the cytotoxic effects. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of EGFR and some important apoptosis signaling molecules (e.g., MAPK-1, STAT-5, Akt-1 kinase). Flow cytometric and immunofluorescence staining analyses showed that the anti-EGFR mAb can bind to EGFR with high specificity.

However, demographic metrics are surrogates for the complex contributions of genotypes, exposures, health care, socioeconomic and sociocultural environment, and many other factors. Macroenvironmental factors represent novel surrogates for exposures, lifestyle, and other factors that are difficult to measure but might influence cancer outcomes.  Methods:   We applied a ""multilevel molecular epidemiology"" approach using a prospective cohort of 444 White prostate cancer cases who underwent prostatectomy and were followed until biochemical failure (BF) or censoring without BF. We applied Cox regression models to test for joint effects of 86 genome-wide association study-identified genotypes and macroenvironment contextual effects after geocoding all cases to their residential census tracts. All analyses were adjusted for age at diagnosis and tumor aggressiveness.  Results:   Residents living in census tracts with a high proportion of older single heads of household, high rates of vacant housing, or high unemployment had shorter time until BF postsurgery after adjustment for patient age and tumor aggressiveness. After correction for multiple testing, genotypes alone did not predict time to BF, but interactions predicting time to BF were observed for MSMB (rs10993994) and percentage of older single heads of households (P = 0.0004), and for HNF1B/TCF2 (rs4430796) and census tract per capita income (P = 0.0002).

It has been reported that the naturally occurring antioxidant α-tocopherol (vitamin E) attenuates prostate cancer cell proliferation in cultured cells and mouse models. We hypothesized that overexpression of the tocopherol transfer protein (TTP), a vitamin E-binding protein that regulates tocopherol status, will sensitize prostate cancer cells to the anti-proliferative actions of the vitamin. To test this notion, we manipulated the expression levels of TTP in cultured prostate cells (LNCaP, PC3, DU145, and RWPE-1) using overexpression and knockdown approaches. Treatment of cells with tocopherol caused a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. Overexpression of TTP dramatically sensitized the cells to the apoptotic effects of α-tocopherol, whereas reduction (""knockdown"") of TTP expression resulted in resistance to the vitamin. TTP levels also augmented the inhibitory effects of vitamin E on proliferation in semi-solid medium. The sensitizing effects of TTP were paralleled by changes in the intracellular accumulation of a fluorescent analog of vitamin E and by a reduction in intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species and were not observed when a naturally occurring, ligand binding-defective mutant of TTP was used. We conclude that TTP sensitizes prostate cancer cells to the anti-proliferative effects of vitamin E and that this activity stems from the ability of protein to increase the intracellular accumulation of the antioxidant. These observations support the notion that individual changes in the expression level or activity of TTP may determine the responsiveness of prostate cancer patients to intervention strategies that utilize vitamin E.""","""['Samantha Morley', 'Varsha Thakur', 'David Danielpour', 'Robert Parker', 'Hiroyuki Arai', 'Jeffrey Atkinson', 'Jill Barnholtz-Sloan', 'Eric Klein', 'Danny Manor']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Tocopherol transfer protein sensitizes prostate cancer cells to vitamin E.', 'Vitamin E and Phosphoinositides Regulate the Intracellular Localization of the Hepatic α-Tocopherol Transfer Protein.', 'Differential retention of alpha-vitamin E is correlated with its transporter gene expression and growth inhibition efficacy in prostate cancer cells.', 'Hepatic α-tocopherol transfer protein: ligand-induced protection from proteasomal degradation.', 'α-Tocopherol transfer protein (α-TTP).', 'Non-antioxidant activities of vitamin E.', 'Microalgal Co-Cultivation Prospecting to Modulate Vitamin and Bioactive Compounds Production.', 'Organoids Increase the Predictive Value of in vitro Cancer Chemoprevention Studies for in vivo Outcome.', 'Alpha tocopherol transfer protein (αTTP) is expressed in endometrial carcinoma and is correlated with FIGO stage and 5-year survival.', 'Vitamin E and Phosphoinositides Regulate the Intracellular Localization of the Hepatic α-Tocopherol Transfer Protein.', 'Vitamin E: a dark horse at the crossroad of cancer management.']"""

Common tumors, such as breast, multiple myeloma, and prostate tumors, frequently metastasize to the bone. It is now well recognized that osteoclasts are responsible for the osteolysis observed in bone metastases of the tumor. Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and an activator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, has emerged as a major mediator of bone loss, commonly associated with cancer and other chronic inflammatory diseases. Embelin (2,5-dihydroxy-3-undecyl-1,4-benzoquinone), derived from the Ayurvedic medicinal plant Embelia ribes, has been shown to bind and inhibit X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and inhibit inflammatory pathways. We investigated whether embelin could inhibit osteoclastogenesis-associated bone loss induced by RANKL and by tumor cells in vitro. We found that embelin suppressed the RANKL-induced differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts. This benzoquinone also suppressed the osteoclastogenesis induced by multiple myeloma and by breast cancer cells. This effect of embelin correlated with the suppression of NF-κB activation and inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation and IκBα degradation. Inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation was due to the inhibition of IκBα kinase (IKK) activation. Furthermore, by using an inhibitor of the IKKγ or NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), the regulatory component of the IKK complex, we showed that the NF-κB signaling pathway is mandatory for RAW 264.7 cell differentiation into osteoclasts. Thus, embelin, an inhibitor of RANKL-induced NF-κB activation has great potential as a therapeutic agent for osteoporosis and cancer-linked bone loss.""","""['Simone Reuter', 'Sahdeo Prasad', 'Kanokkarn Phromnoi', 'Ramaswamy Kannappan', 'Vivek R Yadav', 'Bharat B Aggarwal']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Retraction: Embelin Suppresses Osteoclastogenesis Induced by Receptor Activator of NF-κB Ligand and Tumor Cells In vitro through Inhibition of the NF-κB Cell Signaling Pathway.', 'Thiocolchicoside suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and cancer cells through inhibition of inflammatory pathways: a new use for an old drug.', 'Guggulsterone inhibits osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand and by tumor cells by suppressing nuclear factor-kappaB activation.', 'Simvastatin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand through modulation of NF-kappaB pathway.', 'NF-κB signaling and bone resorption.', 'Roles of the RANKL-RANK Axis in Immunity-Implications for Pathogenesis and Treatment of Bone Metastasis.', 'Embelin and Its Derivatives: Design, Synthesis, and Potential Delivery Systems for Cancer Therapy.', 'Embelin Promotes Oncolytic Vaccinia Virus-Mediated Antitumor Immunity Through Disruption of IL-6/STAT3 Signaling in Lymphoma.', 'Tetrabromobisphenol A Promotes the Osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 Cells Induced by Receptor Activator of NF-kappa B Ligand In Vitro.', 'Retraction: Embelin Suppresses Osteoclastogenesis Induced by Receptor Activator of NF-κB Ligand and Tumor Cells In vitro through Inhibition of the NF-κB Cell Signaling Pathway.', 'Intracellular apoptotic pathways: a potential target for reducing joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis.']"""

Here, we report the generation of transgenic mice and prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP cells that overexpress E6-AP protein. Using these models we show that the levels of total Akt and phosphorylated Akt (active Akt) are increased in E6-AP overexpressing prostate gland and LNCaP cells suggesting that E6-AP regulates the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The prostate glands in our transgenic mice are ~20% larger and produce preneoplastic lesions at the age of 18 months. Our data also suggest that E6-AP modulates PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by both androgen-independent and -dependent mechanisms. In the androgen-independent mechanism, E6-AP modulates PI3K-Akt signaling by regulating the protein levels of RhoA, a small GTPase, which is a negative regulator of the Akt signaling pathway. Further, we show that E6-AP, a known coactivator of AR, amplifies the androgen-dependent activation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In addition, we show that stable overexpression of E6-AP in prostate cancer cells results in increased cell size and proliferation. Overall our data suggests that E6-AP regulates both the positive and negative modulators of the PI3K-Akt pathway in prostate cells which results in increased prostate cell growth, proliferation and decreased apoptosis.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled The 26S Proteasome: When degradation is just not enough!""","""['Sathish Srinivasan', 'Zafar Nawaz']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Multifunction steroid receptor coactivator, E6-associated protein, is involved in development of the prostate gland.', 'Impact of E6-associated protein on the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells in bone metastasis.', 'Overexpression of ligase defective E6-associated protein, E6-AP, results in mammary tumorigenesis.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'HPV E6 inhibits E6AP to regulate epithelial homeostasis by modulating keratinocyte differentiation commitment and YAP1 activation.', 'Metagenomic analysis of primary colorectal carcinomas and their metastases identifies potential microbial risk factors.', 'Regulation of p53 by E3s.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The HECT E3 Ligase E6AP/UBE3A as a Therapeutic Target in Cancer and Neurological Disorders.']"""

We attempted to correlate PSA doubling time (PSAdt) and time of undetectable PSA (TUPSA) with biopsy-proven cancer recurrence (BPR) in men treated with primary third-generation cryotherapy for clinically localized CaP.  Materials and methods:   Demographic, clinical, and pathologic data was retrieved including age, race, use of preoperative hormones or 5-α reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs), initial biopsy PSA, biopsy Gleason score, cT stage, prostate volume, presence/absence median lobe, and follow-up. Post-cryotherapy biopsy was considered for PSA levels ≥ 0.5 ng/ml. PSAdt was determined by the log-slope method. TUPSA was defined as time from surgery to a PSA value ≥ 0.2 ng/ml or most recent follow-up if undetectable.  Results:   Ninety-seven patients were identified. Preoperative hormonal manipulation was used in 25 (26%); 5 (5%) were using a 5-ARI. Twenty-seven (29%) underwent post-cryotherapy biopsy, 12 (12%) had a BPR. In 41 (42%), PSAdt was calculated (median 11.9 months, IQR 6.6-34.8); no significant difference between patients with BPR and without CaP was found (P = 0.46). TUPSA was a median of 4.9 months (IQR 3.2-9.9) vs. 15.6 months (IQR 6.1-30.3) for BPR or no CaP, respectively (P = 0.005). On proportional hazards regression, TUPSA was the only independent predictor of BPR (P = 0.03, OR 0.91).  Conclusions:   Post-cryosurgery PSAdt does not appear to be associated with BPR risk, whereas TUPSA reduces the risk of BPR by 9% per month.

Objectives:   To describe the surgical steps of pubovesical complex (PVC)-sparing robot-assisted laparoscopic RP (RALP) and present the preliminary results of our technique.  Design, setting, and participants:   Thirty PVC-sparing RALP procedures were performed in patients <60 yr with clinically localised prostate cancer between 2007 and 2009 by the same surgeon.  Surgical procedure:   The principles of bladder neck preservation, tension and energy-free dissection of the bundles as well as seminal vesicle sparing are applied. Ventrally, a plane of dissection is developed between the detrusor apron and the prostate. The soft connective tissue between Santorini's plexus and the prostate is blandly dissected, leaving the plexus intact and in place.  Measurements:   The rates and location of positive surgical margins (PSM) as well as functional outcomes are presented.  Results and limitations:   Three of 30 patients (10%) had a PSM (two apical margins and one on the left posterolateral side). At catheter removal, 24 of 30 patients (80%) were dry (0 pads), and 6 of 30 patients (20%) needed one security pad. After 3 mo, 22 of 30 patients (73%) presented an International Index of Erectile Function score >17 (with or without phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors). Thirteen of 22 potent patients had an Erection Hardness Score of 3, and 9 of 22 patients had a score of 4. Small sample size, low mean age of enrolled patients (52 yr), and the absence of diseases that could impair the continence and potency recovery are some of the limitations of the study. Moreover, it is difficult to quantify the effect of each applied continence-sparing technique.  Conclusions:   The holistic preservation of the PVC during RALP is technically feasible.

Some urologists contribute to the discussion and seem to have a corrective influence, but their involvement is judged diversely. As mainly lay people with different levels of knowledge are involved in the discussion, a tentative language style is frequently used. The disease itself appears to be a linguistic taboo. Besides treatment recommendations, emotional support is of major concern. Being personally affected establishes a sense of unity, which adds to the subjective value of the communication.

Methods and findings:   We have modeled PND tumor immunity in a clinical trial in which apoptotic allogeneic prostate tumor cells were used to generate an apoptotic tumor-autologous dendritic cell vaccine. Twenty-four prostate cancer patients were immunized in a Phase I, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine. Vaccinations were safe and well tolerated. Importantly, we also found that the vaccine was immunogenic, inducing delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation, with no effect on FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. A statistically significant increase in T cell proliferation responses to prostate tumor cells in vitro (p = 0.002), decrease in prostate specific antigen (PSA) slope (p = 0.016), and a two-fold increase in PSA doubling time (p = 0.003) were identified when we compared data before and after vaccination.

The prostate is comprised of a functional secretory epithelium, a basal epithelium, and a supporting stroma comprised of structural elements, and a spectrum of cell types that includes smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells. As reciprocal interactions between epithelium and stromal constituents are essential for normal organogenesis and serve to maintain normal functions, discordance within the stroma could permit or promote disease processes. In this study we sought to identify aging-associated alterations in the mouse prostate microenvironment that could influence pathology.  Methodology/principal findings:   We quantitated transcript levels in microdissected glandular-adjacent stroma from young (age 4 months) and old (age 20-24 months) C57BL/6 mice, and identified a significant change in the expression of 1259 genes (p<0.05). These included increases in transcripts encoding proteins associated with inflammation (e.g., Ccl8, Ccl12), genotoxic/oxidative stress (e.g., Apod, Serpinb5) and other paracrine-acting effects (e.g., Cyr61). The expression of several collagen genes (e.g., Col1a1 and Col3a1) exhibited age-associated declines. By histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy we determined that the collagen matrix is abundant and disorganized, smooth muscle cell orientation is disordered, and inflammatory infiltrates are significantly increased, and are comprised of macrophages, T cells and, to a lesser extent, B cells.  Conclusion/significance:   These findings demonstrate that during normal aging the prostate stroma exhibits phenotypic and molecular characteristics plausibly contributing to the striking age associated pathologies affecting the prostate.""","""['Daniella Bianchi-Frias', 'Funda Vakar-Lopez', 'Ilsa M Coleman', 'Stephen R Plymate', 'May J Reed', 'Peter S Nelson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Hyaluronan in aged collagen matrix increases prostate epithelial cell proliferation.', 'Role of stroma in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'A system for studying epithelial-stromal interactions reveals distinct inductive abilities of stromal cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Age-related changes in guinea pig prostatic stroma.', 'Role of the stromal microenvironment in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'Chronic consumption of a hypercaloric diet increases neuroinflammation and brain senescence, promoting cognitive decline in middle-aged female Wistar rats.', 'Correlation between metastatic patterns and age in patients with metastatic primary liver cancer: A population-based study.', 'METTL3 promotes prostatic hyperplasia by regulating PTEN expression in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner.', 'Role of prostate stem cells and treatment strategies in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Androgens, aging, and prostate health.']"""

Methods:   Publications through 2008 with the keywords 'osteopontin AND cancer' were retrieved. Titles and abstracts were screened for studies presenting original data on human subjects. This left 228 publications for data extraction. We applied categorical data analysis for testing the relationship between Osteopontin and a clinical variable.  Results:   Osteopontin ranks correlated with lower overall and disease-free/relapse-free survival in all tumors combined, as well as in lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer, and liver cancer. Further, Osteopontin levels correlated with tumor grade and stage for all tumors combined and for several individual tumor types. Osteopontin levels were significantly associated with the early progression of eight cancers, independent in one, and inversely correlated in two.  Conclusions:   Osteopontin is significantly associated with survival in several forms of cancer.

Several of them have already been characterized as causal in various diseases, including cancer. We also predicted novel microRNAs that have never been associated to this type of tumor. Furthermore, the condition-dependent expression of several modules could be linked to the value of a clinical parameter characterizing the aggressiveness of the prostate cancer.

In most cases, however, GSA relies on the invalid assumption that the members of each gene set are sampled independently, which increases false predictions.  Results:   We propose an algorithm, termed DECO, to remove (or alleviate) the bias caused by the correlation of the expression data in GSAs. This is accomplished through the eigenvalue-decomposition of covariance matrixes and a series of linear transformations of data. In particular, moderate de-correlation methods that truncate or re-scale eigenvalues were proposed for a more reliable analysis. Tests of simulated and real experimental data show that DECO effectively corrects the correlation structure of gene expression and improves the prediction accuracy (specificity and sensitivity) for both gene- and sample-randomizing GSA methods.

To arrest the uncontrolled replication of malignant cells, conventional chemotherapies systemically disrupt cell division, causing diverse and often severe side effects as a result of collateral damage to normal cells. Seeking to address this shortcoming, we pursue therapeutic regulation that is conditional, activating selectively in cancer cells. This functionality is achieved using small conditional RNAs that interact and change conformation to mechanically transduce between detection of a cancer mutation and activation of a therapeutic pathway. Here, we describe small conditional RNAs that undergo hybridization chain reactions (HCR) to induce cell death via an innate immune response if and only if a cognate mRNA cancer marker is detected within a cell. The sequences of the small conditional RNAs can be designed to accept different mRNA markers as inputs to HCR transduction, providing a programmable framework for selective killing of diverse cancer cells. In cultured human cancer cells (glioblastoma, prostate carcinoma, Ewing's sarcoma), HCR transduction mediates cell death with striking efficacy and selectivity, yielding a 20- to 100-fold reduction in population for cells containing a cognate marker, and no measurable reduction otherwise.

The most studied variant (called AR-V7 or AR3) activates AR reporter genes in the absence of ligand and therefore, could play a role in castration resistance. To explore the range of potential ARVs, we screened additional human and murine prostate cancer models using conventional and next generation sequencing technologies and detected several structurally diverse AR isoforms. Some, like AR-V7/AR3, display gain of function, whereas others have dominant interfering activity. We also find that ARV expression increases acutely in response to androgen withdrawal, is suppressed by testosterone, and in some models, is coupled to full-length AR (AR-FL) mRNA production. As expected, constitutively active, ligand-independent ARVs such as AR-V7/AR3 are sufficient to confer anchorage-independent (in vitro) and castration-resistant (in vivo) growth. Surprisingly, this growth is blocked by ligand binding domain-targeted antiandrogens, such as MDV3100, or by selective siRNA silencing of AR-FL, indicating that the growth-promoting effects of ARVs are mediated through AR-FL. These data indicate that the increase in ARV expression in castrate-resistant prostate cancer is an acute response to castration rather than clonal expansion of castration or antiandrogen-resistant cells expressing gain of function ARVs, and furthermore, they provide a strategy to overcome ARV function in the clinic.""","""['Philip A Watson', 'Yinan F Chen', 'Minna D Balbas', 'John Wongvipat', 'Nicholas D Socci', 'Agnes Viale', 'Kwanghee Kim', 'Charles L Sawyers']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Prostate cancer: New insight into mechanisms of castration resistance.', 'Rapid induction of androgen receptor splice variants by androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and its splice variant, AR-V7, differentially regulate FOXA1 sensitive genes in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor variant-driven prostate cancer: clinical implications and therapeutic targeting.', 'Molecular Origin, Expression Regulation, and Biological Function of Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of PARP inhibitors in prostate cancer: from specific to broader application.', 'Androgen Receptor Upregulates Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue 1 to Induce NF-κB Activity via Androgen-Dependent and -Independent Pathways in Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Co-expression and clinical utility of AR-FL and AR splice variants AR-V3, AR-V7 and AR-V9 in prostate cancer.', 'Urolithin A analog inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer by targeting the androgen receptor and its variant, androgen receptor-variant 7.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Therefore, the search for a combination of functional polymorphisms using cell cycle and apoptotic genes as tumor markers is fundamental for a more precise and reliable diagnosis. In the present study, we investigated the diagnostic value of 3 different genes associated with CaP carcinogenesis, encoding for cell cycle (MDM2, CCND1) and apoptotic (Fas) genes that are differentially expressed in CaP.  Methods:   In a hospital-based case control study of northern India, blood samples were obtained from 192 CaP patients and 224 cancer-free age matched unrelated healthy controls of similar ethnicity. They were genotyped for MDM2 G309T, CCND1 G870A, Fas A670G, and G1377A polymorphisms using polymerase chain restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.  Results:   MDM2 309GG variant was at reduced risk for developing CaP (P = 0.041; OR, 0.59). Whereas CCND1 AA genotype demonstrated increased risk (P = 0.018; OR, 1.86).

Our objective was to perform an external validation of the CAPRA score as a predictor of 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) in a single-surgeon radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) series.  Materials and methods:   We examined the performance characteristics of the preoperative CAPRA score (0-10) to predict biochemical progression-free survival (PFS) in 990 men who underwent RRP by a single surgeon from 2003 to 2009.  Results:   CAPRA scores were significantly associated with the risk of early biochemical progression in our series. For example, 5-year PFS was markedly different for scores at the extremes of 0 to 1 vs. ≥7 (95% vs. 40%, respectively). The concordance index was 0.764 for the prediction of biochemical progression using CAPRA scores in this cohort, which compares favorably with the concordance index of 0.66 in the original CaPSURE dataset.

The direct effect of zinc on the expression levels of zinc transporters (ZnT-1 and ZnT-4) and apoptosis-related genes (Bax, Bcl-2, and survivin) was determined by RT-PCR analysis.  Results:   When LNCaP and PC-3 cells were exposed to various concentrations of zinc sulfate for 48 hors, their growth was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The levels of zinc in both cell lines treated with zinc sulfate for 24 hours were higher than in untreated cells. Exposure to zinc induced apoptosis and necrosis in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Apoptosis became more extensive as the treatment time with zinc increased. There was a significant increase in the gene expression levels of ZnT-1 and ZnT-4 in both cell lines treated with zinc sulfate compared with untreated cells. The expression of Bax mRNA was up-regulated, while the expression of Bcl-2 and survivin were decreased in both cell lines following zinc treatment.  Conclusions:   Exposure to zinc sulfate in human prostate cancer cells increased intracellular levels of zinc, which resulted in increased apoptosis.

In the present study, we present a comparative study of the tissue specific promoter prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and the tumour-type specific hOC promoter driving the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transgene using both in vitro and in vivo models.  Methods:   In vitro cytotoxicity was assessed by clonogenic assay. Quantification of nitric oxide expression was determined by the Griess test. In vivo anti-tumour efficacy was determined by tumour growth delay following direct intra-tumoural injection of the constructs into PC3 xenografts. In addition, tumours were dissected post mortem and examined for morphological differences as well as changes in apoptotic protein expression.  Results:   PSMA/iNOS produced cytotoxicity in both androgen dependant and independent cell lines. Nitric oxide quantification confirmed that increased cytotoxicity was directly associated with nitric oxide production. Tumour growth delays were observed in all groups treated with the iNOS-expressing constructs ranging from 10.7 days for the hOC/iNOS single dose treatment group to a maximum of 52.2 days for the hOC/iNOS multiple dose group. Intra-tumoural assessment of iNOS and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase protein expression demonstrated a significant up-regulation of both proteins, indicating cytotoxicity mediated through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.  Conclusions:   Highly significant tumour growth delay coupled with no detrimental side-effects were observed following treatment with the PSMA/iNOS and hOC/iNOS constructs.

In prostate cancer, evidence has accumulated for the contribution of the androgen-dependent gene network to tumor growth, although the precise functions of miRNAs in prostate cancer remain to be investigated. Here, we identified androgen-responsive miRNAs by the short RNA sequencing analysis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.

However, the frequency of C-MYC alterations in CaP has remained uncertain. A recent study, using a new anti-MYC antibody, described prevalent upregulation of nuclear C-MYC protein expression as an early oncogenic alteration in CaP. Further, we have recently reported regulation of C-MYC expression by ERG and a significant correlation between C-MYC overexpression and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in early stage CaP. These emerging data suggest that increased C-MYC expression may be a critical and early oncogenic event driving CaP progression. In this study, we assessed whether C-MYC mRNA overexpression in primary prostate tumors was predictive of more aggressive tumor or disease progression. Our approach was to quantitatively determine C-MYC mRNA expression levels in laser capture micro-dissected tumor cells and matched benign epithelial cells in a radical prostatectomy cohort with long follow-up data available. On the basis of our results, we conclude that elevated C-MYC expression in primary prostate tumor is biologically relevant and may be a predictor of future biochemical recurrence.""","""['D Hawksworth', 'L Ravindranath', 'Y Chen', 'B Furusato', 'I A Sesterhenn', 'D G McLeod', 'S Srivastava', 'G Petrovics']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Unopposed c-MYC expression in benign prostatic epithelium causes a cancer phenotype.', 'Combined c-Myc and caveolin-1 expression in human prostate carcinoma predicts prostate carcinoma progression.', '8q24 amplification is associated with Myc expression and prostate cancer progression and is an independent predictor of recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'MicroRNAs and prostate cancer.', 'Molecular biology and prostate cancer: evolution or revolution?.', 'FOXA1 regulates alternative splicing in prostate cancer.', 'Prediction of recurrence free survival for esophageal cancer patients using a protein signature based risk model.', 'O-GlcNAcylation: an important post-translational modification and a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy.', 'Race and prostate cancer: genomic landscape.', 'Aspalathus linearis suppresses cell survival and proliferation of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of c-Myc and stability of androgen receptor.']"""

We also sought to determine time trends and to compare the results with international studies.  Methods:   We asked 11 population-based cancer registries to submit individual data for patients diagnosed from 1993 to 1999, together with data on outcome after 5 years. Although all these registries submitted data (491 772 cases), only six met the required standards for the quality of registration data and follow-up investigation. The relative 5-year survival calculated by pooling data from 151 061 cases from six registries was taken as the survival for cancer patients in Japan.  Results:   Relative 5-year survival (1997-99) was 54.3% for all cancers (males: 50.0%, females: 59.8%). Survival figures for all sites changed slightly over the 7-year period, from 53.2% for the first 4 years of the study (1993-96) to 54.3% for the last 3 years (1997-99), however, a major improvement was observed in several primary sites. Some overall survival was lower in Japan than in the USA, but similar to that in European countries. Specifically, survival for uterine cancer, prostate cancer, testis cancer, lymphoma and leukemia was much lower in Japan than in other countries. However, survival was better in Japan mainly for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, liver and gallbladder.

This study was carried out to evaluate the impact of the dietary factor lycopene on DNA synthesis, activity and expression of the androgen receptor gene element in prostate LnCaP cells and to report our pilot phase II study investigating its effect on prostate-specific antigen velocity over one year.  Methods:   LnCaP cells were grown with or without different concentrations of lycopene or tetrahydrofuran (THF solvent) added to the culture medium for 48 hours. DNA synthesis was measured by the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) into DNA during a 4-hour pulse, followed by immunostaining and visualization of stained cells using fluorescence microscopy. A transient transfection of a plasmid DNA recombinant containing an androgen receptor element-luciferase (ARE-Luc) report gene into LnCaP cells was developed and the impact of different concentrations of lycopene on the androgen receptor element was reflected by quantitative analysis of the luciferase enzyme function. Expression of the androgen gene was also studied by Western blotting. The phase II pilot study patients (n=41) previously diagnosed with prostate cancer were enrolled and given lycopene supplement, 10 mg per day, and response was measured by observing changes in the plasma prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Results:   The addition of 0.5 micromol/L, 5 micromol/L, 10 micromol/L and 15 micromol/L of lycopene was shown to inhibit cell growth by 2.66%, 4.29%, 3.73% and 13.66%, respectively, compared with the THF solvent control samples (P=0.015). As compared with the RPMI1640 medium group, cell proliferation in the presence of 5 micromol/L, 10 micromol/L, and 15 micromol/L lycopene was inhibited by 8.12%, 6.33% and 12.00%, respectively (P=0.024). We showed for the first time that lycopene inhibited the activity of the androgen receptor gene element in a dose-related manner. Inhibition was seen in the transcription of the luciferase construct and confirmed by androgen receptor element expression assayed by Western blotting. Regression slopes of (log) PSA vs. time decreased in 26/37 (70%, 95%CI 53%-84%) of the patients after supplementation and in eight cases (21%) the post-treatment slope was negative. For these eight patients, the average fall in PSA was equivalent to 2% over 28 days (i.e. an average slope/d of -0.000713). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed an overall statistically significant decrease in slope (P=0.0007). Analysis of the PSA doubling time (pretreatment vs. posttreatment) showed a median increase after supplementation for 174 days; however, this was not statistically significant (P=0.18).  Conclusions:   Lycopene as an antioxidant dietary factor could significantly inhibit DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent pattern; the result revealed lycopene might inhibit androgen receptor gene element activity and expression. Dietary lycopene may play an important role in prostate cancer cell proliferation and further supports a large randomized study into the role of lycopene supplementation in malignant prostate disease.""","""['Xin Zhang', 'Qi Wang', 'Barber Neil', 'Xiao Chen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Chin Med J (Engl)""","""['Role of coordinated molecular alterations in the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer: an in vitro model that corroborates clinical observations.', 'Growth factor regulation of gene expression in the human prostatic carcinoma cell line LNCaP.', 'Lycopene inhibits DNA synthesis in primary prostate epithelial cells in vitro and its administration is associated with a reduced prostate-specific antigen velocity in a phase II clinical study.', 'Comparative effects of DHEA vs. testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol on proliferation and gene expression in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate specific antigen gene regulation by androgen receptor.', 'Lycopene inhibits endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition of choroidal vascular endothelial cells in laser-induced mouse choroidal neovascularization.', 'Can Lycopene Impact the Androgen Axis in Prostate Cancer?: A Systematic Review of Cell Culture and Animal Studies.', 'Prostate cancer prophylaxis by dietary supplements: more than just an illusion?.', 'In vitro anti-telomerase activity of novel lycopene-loaded nanospheres in the human leukemia cell line K562.', 'Recent progress on nutraceutical research in prostate cancer.']"""

Based on their sizes, tRNase Zs can be divided into the long (tRNase ZL) and short (tRNase ZS) forms. tRNase ZL is thought to have arisen from a tandem gene duplication of tRNase ZS with further sequence divergence. The species distribution of tRNase Z is complex. Fungi represent an evolutionarily diverse group of eukaryotes. The recent proliferation of fungal genome sequences provides an opportunity to explore the structural and functional diversity of eukaryotic tRNase Zs.  Results:   We report a survey and analysis of candidate tRNase Zs in 84 completed fungal genomes, spanning a broad diversity of fungi. We find that tRNase ZL is present in all fungi we have examined, whereas tRNase ZS exists only in the fungal phyla Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota and Zygomycota. Furthermore, we find that unlike the Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina, which contain a single tRNase ZL, Schizosaccharomyces fission yeasts (Taphrinomycotina) contain two tRNase ZLs encoded by two different tRNase ZL genes. These two tRNase ZLs are most likely localized to the nucleus and mitochondria, respectively, suggesting partitioning of tRNase Z function between two different tRNase ZLs in fission yeasts. The fungal tRNase Z phylogeny suggests that tRNase ZSs are ancestral to tRNase ZLs. Additionally, the evolutionary relationship of fungal tRNase ZLs is generally consistent with known phylogenetic relationships among the fungal species and supports tRNase ZL gene duplication in certain fungal taxa, including Schizosaccharomyces fission yeasts. Analysis of tRNase Z protein sequences reveals putative atypical substrate binding domains in most fungal tRNase ZSs and in a subset of fungal tRNase ZLs. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of pseudo-substrate recognition and catalytic motifs at the N-terminal halves of tRNase ZLs.  Conclusions:   This study describes the first comprehensive identification and sequence analysis of candidate fungal tRNase Zs. Our results support the proposal that tRNase ZL has evolved as a result of duplication and diversification of the tRNase ZS gene.""","""['Wei Zhao', 'Haiyan Yu', 'Shuzhen Li', 'Ying Huang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Evol Biol""","""[""Identification and sequence analysis of metazoan tRNA 3'-end processing enzymes tRNase Zs."", ""A survey of green plant tRNA 3'-end processing enzyme tRNase Zs, homologs of the candidate prostate cancer susceptibility protein ELAC2."", 'The N-terminal half-domain of the long form of tRNase Z is required for the RNase 65 activity.', 'tRNase Z: the end is not in sight.', 'The making of tRNAs and more - RNase P and tRNase Z.', 'ELAC2/RNaseZ-linked cardiac hypertrophy in Drosophila melanogaster.', 'Substitutions in conserved regions preceding and within the linker affect activity and flexibility of tRNase ZL, the long form of tRNase Z.', 'Identification of glutathione (GSH)-independent glyoxalase III from Schizosaccharomyces pombe.', ""Partitioning of the nuclear and mitochondrial tRNA 3'-end processing activities between two different proteins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe."", ""Identification and sequence analysis of metazoan tRNA 3'-end processing enzymes tRNase Zs.""]"""

Aim:   To assess if pre-RP female sexual function predicts of partner compliance with an EP protocol.  Main outcome measures:   Compliance, defined as use of localized penile EP therapy (intracavernosal injections [ICIs], vacuum erection device [VED], or alprostadil) at 3 and 6 months after RP.  Methods:   Records of patients enrolled in our EP program from April 2007 to June 2008 were reviewed. Before surgery, patients completed the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) and their female partners completed the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. Prior to surgery, patients were advised to take sildenafil 25 mg every nightly and use a 250-µg alprostadil suppository three times/week. At 1 month, additional daily use of a VED was encouraged. All patients unable to achieve erections sufficient for penetration were encouraged to initiate ICI of Trimix (phentolamine, papaverine, and PGE1) twice weekly after 3 months following surgery. Data were analyzed using binary logistic regression analysis holding all input variables constant.  Results:   Twenty-nine patients had preoperative SHIM>7 and pre-RP partner FSFI data available. After a 4-week follow-up, compliance with alprostadil suppository declined and both ICI and VED usage increased. At 6 months, six (25.0%) patients had return of natural erectile function and 22 (91.7%) were achieving assisted erections. Higher preoperative partner FSFI scores were associated with greater compliance to the localized penile therapy component of our EP protocol (risk ratio 3.8, P=0.05).  Conclusions:   Preoperative female sexual function correlated with greater partner compliance with the localized component of our EP protocol. Consideration of a female partner's preoperative sexual function in predicting patient erectile function recovery after RP is warranted.

Consequently, almost every cell, tissue, and animal tightly regulates cholesterol homeostasis, including complex mechanisms of synthesis, transport, uptake, and disposition of cholesterol molecules. We hypothesize that cellular recognition of cholesterol insufficiency causes cell cycle arrest in order to avoid a catastrophic failure in membrane synthesis. Here, we demonstrate using unbiased proteomics and standard biochemistry that cholesterol insufficiency causes upregulation of prohibitin, an inhibitor of cell cycle progression, through activation of a cholesterol-responsive promoter element.

Considering this clinical importance of selenium, we aimed to identify the genes associated with resistance to selenium treatment. We have applied a previous methodology developed by our group, which is based on the genetic and pharmacological data publicly available for the NCI60 cancer cell line panel. In short, we have categorized the NCI60 cell lines as selenium resistant and sensitive based on their growth inhibition (GI50) data. Then, we have utilized the Affymetrix 125K SNP chip data available and carried out a genome-wide case-control association study for the selenium sensitive and resistant NCI60 cell lines. Our results showed statistically significant association of four SNPs in 5q33-34, 10q11.2, 10q22.3 and 14q13.1 with selenium resistance. These SNPs were located in introns of the genes encoding for a kinase-scaffolding protein (AKAP6), a membrane protein (SGCD), a channel protein (KCNMA1), and a protein kinase (PRKG1). The knock-down of KCNMA1 by siRNA showed increased sensitivity to selenium in both LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. Furthermore, SNP-SNP interaction (epistasis) analysis indicated the interactions of the SNPs in AKAP6 with SGCD as well as SNPs in AKAP6 with KCNMA1 with each other, assuming additive genetic model. These genes were also all involved in the Ca(2+) signaling, which has a direct role in induction of apoptosis and induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is consistent with the chemopreventive action of selenium. Once our findings are further validated, this knowledge can be translated into clinics where individuals who can benefit from the chemopreventive characteristics of the selenium supplementation will be easily identified using a simple DNA analysis.""","""['Sevtap Savas', 'Laurent Briollais', 'Irada Ibrahim-zada', 'Hamdi Jarjanazi', 'Yun Hee Choi', 'Mireia Musquera', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Vasundara Venkateswaran', 'Hilmi Ozcelik']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Bioinformatic analyses identifies novel protein-coding pharmacogenomic markers associated with paclitaxel sensitivity in NCI60 cancer cell lines.', 'NCI60 cancer cell line panel data and RNAi analysis help identify EAF2 as a modulator of simvastatin and lovastatin response in HCT-116 cells.', 'Cross-species global and subset gene expression profiling identifies genes involved in prostate cancer response to selenium.', 'Molecular targets of selenium in prostate cancer prevention (Review).', 'Selenium and signal transduction: roads to cell death and anti-tumour activity.', 'Features of the cytoprotective effect of selenium nanoparticles on primary cortical neurons and astrocytes during oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation.', 'An emerging spectrum of variants and clinical features in KCNMA1-linked channelopathy.', 'Detection of candidate biomarkers of prostate cancer progression in serum: a depletion-free 3D LC/MS quantitative proteomics pilot study.', 'Signatures of Evolutionary Adaptation in Quantitative Trait Loci Influencing Trace Element Homeostasis in Liver.', 'The CC genotype of the delta-sarcoglycan gene polymorphism rs13170573 is associated with obstructive sleep apnea in the Chinese population.']"""

Lesions of the proximal epiphysis were treated with resection and endoprosthetic replacement (n=30). The remaining 57 fractures were stabilized with antegrade unreamed intra-medullary locked nailing without (9 cases) or with resection and use of cement (48 cases). The function of the upper limb was assessed using the Musculo-Skeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) rating scale and survival rate was retrospectively analysed. The mean survival time of patients after surgery was 8.3 months. Complications of endoprosthetic replacement recorded included disease relapse (n=3), soft tissue infection (n=2) and palsy of musculocutaneous nerve (n=1) whereas, for intra-medullary locked nailing there were three cases of soft tissue infection and one case of radial nerve palsy. The mean MSTS score at follow-up was 73% for endoprosthesis and 79.2% for locked intra-medullary nailing. Endoprosthetic replacement of the proximal humerus provides a good function of the upper limb, a low risk of local relapse with a low complication rate at follow-up.

Transcriptional control of NKX3.1 expression and in particular, factors that function via the NKX3.1 5' proximal promoter are poorly characterized.  Methods:   Deletion reporter analyses, bioinformatics, electromobility shift assays (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Western blotting were performed to identify and functionally characterize sites of transcription factor binding within the initial 2,062 bp of the NKX3.1 5' promoter.  Results:   Deletion reporter studies of the 2,062 bp NKX3.1 5' promoter sequence localized positive transcriptional activity between -1069 and -993. Bioinformatic analyses identified the presence of two overlapping ETS1 binding sites within this region, designated EBS1 and EBS2, which exhibited 82% and 74% homology, respectively, to the ETS consensus binding sequence. EMSA and supershift assays indicated binding of both endogenous ETS1 and a recombinant GST-ETS1 protein solely to EBS1, a result that was confirmed in vivo by ChIP analysis. ETS1 overexpression transactivated NKX3.1 promoter reporter activity and upregulated endogenous NKX3.1 mRNA and protein levels in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, demonstrating a functional role for ETS1 in the regulation of NKX3.1 expression.  Conclusions:   ETS1 upregulation of NKX3.1 expression in LNCaP cells is mediated in part via its interaction with an EBS located in the NKX3.1 5' proximal promoter.

The 10 HRPC patients were administered docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Quantification of miR-21 was assayed by specific TaqMan qRT-PCR.  Results:   Serum miR-21 level was found to correlate to serum PSA level in patients with ADPC and HRPC, P = 0.012 and 0.049, respectively. There was no significant difference in serum miR-21 level between BPH, localized CaP and ADPC with PSA level <4 ng/ml. Higher levels of miR-21 were detected in patients with HRPC and ADPC with PSA level >4 ng/ml. Six of the 10 HRPC patients reached partial remission with a decreased PSA level of >50% after chemotherapy.

For cells to become invasive, the prostate gland must undergo degradation of the basement membrane and disruption of the basal cell layer underneath the luminal epithelia. Although the roles of proteinases in breaking down the basement membrane have been well-studied, little is known about the factors that induce basal cell layer disruption, degeneration, and its eventual disappearance in invasive cancer. It is hypothesized that microenvironmental factors may affect the degradation of the basal cell layer, which if protected may prevent tumor progression and invasion. In this study, we have revealed differential protein expression patterns between epithelial and stromal cells isolated from different prostate pathologies and identified several important epithelial and stromal proteins that may contribute to inflammation and malignant transformation of human benign prostate tissues to cancerous tissues using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and proteomics methods.

Proto-oncogene Wnt-3 was downregulated in endothelial cells of prostatitis tissue and tyrosine phosphatase non receptor type 1 was only found in normal and benign endothelial cells.

No published studies have examined the clinical impact of concurrent ketoconazole and acid suppressive therapy in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Objective:   To evaluate the effect of acid suppressive therapy on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate in CRPC patients receiving ketoconazole.  Methods:   This retrospective study evaluated CRPC patients treated with ketoconazole 3 times daily between January 1, 1999, and September 30, 2009. Patients included in the analysis had failed androgen deprivation therapy, and were subsequently initiated on ketoconazole. Response (PSA decline ≥50% maintained ≥4 weeks) was evaluated in patients receiving ketoconazole with (group 1 [G1]) or without (group 2 [G2]) concurrent acid suppressive therapy.  Results:   Thirty patients (G1: 11 patients; G2: 19 patients) were included in the analysis. Mean age in G1 and G2 was 71.8 and 69.6 years, respectively. Most patients had received prior therapy with an antiandrogen (90.9% G1; 100% G2) and fewer patients received antiandrogen withdrawal therapy (27.3% G1; 21.1% G2). Median baseline PSA was 109.4 (G1) and 86.9 ng/mL (G2) (p = 0.55). Median duration of ketoconazole was 7.2 months in G1 and 5.8 months in G2 (p = 0.09). Ketoconazole adherence was 82% (G1) and 100% (G2). Median duration of concurrent acid suppressive therapy was 3.8 months (range 2.0-20.4) in G1. PSA response (72.7% and 47.4%; p = 0.26) and time to PSA response (1.2 vs 0.9 mo; p = 0.53) were statistically similar between G1 and G2, respectively. Median progression free survival was higher in G1 (11.5 vs 6.9 months in G2; p = 0.047).  Conclusions:   Use of concurrent acid suppressive therapy and ketoconazole in CRPC patients did not decrease PSA response rate, and progression free survival was unexpectedly higher compared with the non-acid suppressive therapy group.

We investigated whether specific histone modifications are prognostic for prostate cancer relapse, and whether the expression of epigenetic genes is altered in prostate tumorigenesis.  Methods:   Global levels of histone H3 lysine-18 acetylation (H3K18Ac) and histone H3 lysine-4 dimethylation (H3K4diMe) were assessed immunohistochemically in a prostate cancer cohort of 279 cases. Epigenetic gene expression was investigated in silico by analysis of microarray data from 23 primary prostate cancers (8 with biochemical recurrence and 15 without) and 7 metastatic lesions.  Results:   H3K18Ac and H3K4diMe are independent predictors of relapse-free survival, with high global levels associated with a 1.71-fold (P < 0.0001) and 1.80-fold (P = 0.006) increased risk of tumor recurrence, respectively. High levels of both histone modifications were associated with a 3-fold increased risk of relapse (P < 0.0001). Epigenetic gene expression profiling identified a candidate gene signature (DNMT3A, MBD4, MLL2, MLL3, NSD1, and SRCAP), which significantly discriminated nonmalignant from prostate tumor tissue (P = 0.0063) in an independent cohort.  Conclusions:   This study has established the importance of histone modifications in predicting prostate cancer relapse and has identified an epigenetic gene signature associated with prostate tumorigenesis.

In the present study, we show that knockdown of the inwardly rectifying K(+) channel Kir2.2 induced growth arrest without additional cellular stress in cancer cells lacking functional p53, p16, and/or Rb. Kir2.2 knockdown also induced senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and upregulated senescence marker proteins in multiple cancer cell lines derived from different tissues, including prostate, stomach, and breast. Interestingly, knockdown of Kir2.2 induced a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was accompanied by cell cycle arrest, characterized by significant upregulation of p27, with concomitant downregulation of cyclinA, cdc2, and E2F1. Kir2.2 knockdown cells displayed increased levels of PML bodies, DNA damage (γH2AX) foci, senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, mitochondrial dysfunction, secretory phenotype, and phosphatase inactivation. Conversely, overexpression of Kir2.2 decreased doxorubicin-induced ROS accumulation and cell growth inhibition. Kir2.2 knockdown-induced cellular senescence was blocked by N-acetylcysteine, indicating that ROS is a critical mediator of this pathway. In vivo tumorigenesis analyses revealed that tumors derived from Kir2.2 knockdown cells were significantly smaller than those derived from control cells (P < 0.0001) and showed a remarkable increase in senescence-associated proteins, including senescence-associated β-galactosidase, p27, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Moreover, the preestablished tumors are reduced in size after the injection of siKir2.2 (P = 0.0095). Therefore, we propose for the first time that Kir2.2 knockdown induces senescence of cancer cells by a mechanism involving ROS accumulation that requires p27, but not Rb, p53, or p16.""","""['Inkyoung Lee', 'Chaehwa Park', 'Won Ki Kang']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Inhibition of monocarboxylate transporter 2 induces senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and suppresses progression of colorectal malignancies in vivo.', 'Upregulation of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (KCNJ2) modulates multidrug resistance of small-cell lung cancer under the regulation of miR-7 and the Ras/MAPK pathway.', 'Wogonin induces cellular senescence in breast cancer via suppressing TXNRD2 expression.', 'Cellular Senescence: The Sought or the Unwanted?', 'Damaged DNA binding protein 2 in reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation and premature senescence.', 'Potassium Ion Channels in Malignant Central Nervous System Cancers.', 'Potassium Channels as a Target for Cancer Therapy: Current Perspectives.', 'pH-Channeling in Cancer: How pH-Dependence of Cation Channels Shapes Cancer Pathophysiology.', 'Physiological Significance of Ion Transporters and Channels in the Stomach and Pathophysiological Relevance in Gastric Cancer.', 'Ion channels or aquaporins as novel molecular targets in gastric cancer.']"""

We have identified AR from a primitive vertebrate with a sex reversal characteristic, the rice field eel. AR of this species (eAR) is distinct from human AR, especially in the ligand binding domain (LBD), and its expression in gonads shows an increasing tendency during gonadal transformation from ovary via ovotestis to testis. eAR has a restricted androgen-dependent transactivation function after a nuclear translocation upon dihydrotestosterone exposure. A functional nuclear localization signal was further identified in the DNA binding domain and hinge region. Although nuclear export is CRM1-independent, eAR has a novel nuclear export signal, which is negatively charged, indicating that a nuclear export pathway may be mediated by electrostatic interaction. Further, our studies have identified critical sequences for ligand binding in the C terminus. A structure of three α-helices in the LBD has been conserved from eels to humans during vertebrate evolution, despite a distinct amino acid sequence. Mutation analysis confirmed that the LBD is essential for dihydrotestosterone-induced nuclear import of eAR and following transactivation function in the nucleus. In addition, eAR interacts with both Sox9a1 and Sox9a2, and their interaction regulates transactivation of eAR. Our data suggest that the primitive species conserves and especially acquires key novel domains, the nuclear export signal and LBD, for the eAR function in spite of a rapid sequence evolution.""","""['Fang Zhou', 'Wei Zhao', 'Zhixiang Zuo', 'Yue Sheng', 'Xiang Zhou', 'Yu Hou', 'Hanhua Cheng', 'Rongjia Zhou']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Androgen induces a switch from cytoplasmic retention to nuclear import of the androgen receptor.', ""Characterization of nuclear import of the domain-specific androgen receptor in association with the importin alpha/beta and Ran-guanosine 5'-triphosphate systems."", 'Structural basis for the nuclear import of the human androgen receptor.', 'Identification and characterization of a ligand-regulated nuclear export signal in androgen receptor.', 'Karyopherins in nuclear transport of homeodomain proteins during development.', 'Genome-wide analysis of brain and gonad transcripts reveals changes of key sex reversal-related genes expression and signaling pathways in three stages of Monopterus albus.', 'Proteomic analysis of three gonad types of swamp eel reveals genes differentially expressed during sex reversal.', 'Androgen receptor-beta mRNA levels in different tissues in breeding and post-breeding male and female sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus.']"""

Methods:   • We studied IGF-1R expression in 44 prostate cancer specimens from 18 patients who had undergone serial chTURP at least 3 months apart. • Retrospective analysis of the hospital notes was undertaken to obtain clinical information, including age, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, hormone treatment and metastatic disease status at the time of each operation. • After an optimization process using three commercially-available IGF-1R antibodies, we used two antibodies for semiquantititve immunostaining of serial chTURP chips.  Results:   • Santa Cruz antibody sc713 gave positive staining in IGF-1R null R- cells, and was not used further. Antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA) (CS) and NeoMarkers Inc. (Fremont, CA, USA) (NM) did not stain R- cells and, in prostate tissue, showed staining of the glandular epithelium, with negligible stromal staining. All 44 chTURP samples contained identifiable malignant tissue and, of these, 73% and 64% scored moderately or strongly (score 3 or 4) with the CS and NM antibodies respectively. • There was significant correlation of IGF-1R scores of malignant tissue between the two antibodies (P < 0.001). By contrast, staining of benign glands showed poor correlation between antibodies: CS gave significantly weaker staining than malignant epithelium in the same sections (P < 0.001), whereas NM showed poor discrimination between malignant and benign glands. IGF-1R staining scores generated by the CS antibody were used to analyze the clinical data. • Most patients (six of seven) with falling IGF-1R staining scores were responding to androgen deprivation therapy (confirmed by PSA response) between operations. Conversely, in seven of eight patients who had progression to androgen-independence between procedures, IGF-1R levels increased or remained high. Finally, seven of 11 patients who developed radiologically confirmed metastases between procedures showed stable or increasing IGF-1R staining scores.  Conclusion:   • The present study is the first to assess changes in IGF-1R expression in serial prostate cancer samples. The results obtained indicate that IGF-1R expression usually remains high throughout the course of histologically-proven disease progression in serial specimens, suggesting that the IGF-1R remains a valid treatment target for advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Benjamin W Turney', 'Gareth D H Turner', 'Simon F Brewster', 'Valentine M Macaulay']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Differential localization of MT1-MMP in human prostate cancer tissue: role of IGF-1R in MT1-MMP expression.', 'Expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in local and metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor axis components in human primary prostate cancer correlates with tumor grade.', 'Plasma and tissue insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer and anti-IGF-IR agents as novel therapeutic strategy for refractory cases: a review.', 'Prostate-specific antigen doubling time and survival in patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer.', 'IGF-1R nuclear import and recruitment to chromatin involves both alpha and beta subunits.', 'IGF-1 and hyperglycaemia-induced FOXA1 and IGFBP-2 affect epithelial to mesenchymal transition in prostate epithelial cells.', 'IGF signalling in germ cells and testicular germ cell tumours: roles and therapeutic approaches.', 'Does milk intake promote prostate cancer initiation or progression via effects on insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)?

Patients and methods:   Patients with CRPC and bone metastases who were pain free or mildly symptomatic for pain were randomized to receive once-daily oral tablets of zibotentan 10 mg, 15 mg or placebo. The primary endpoint was the time to progression and secondary endpoints included overall survival, change in the number of bone metastases, and safety.  Results:   In total, 312 patients were randomized (placebo, n= 107; zibotentan 10 mg, n= 107; zibotentan 15 mg, n= 98). The median duration of study treatment and median follow-up time were 4 and 22 months, respectively. At the final analysis, there were no statistical differences of the primary outcome of time to progression between treatment groups, although an improvement in overall survival was observed in the zibotentan groups compared to placebo. Consistent with the previous analyses for overall survival, hazard ratios (HRs) of less than one were sustained for both zibotentan 15 mg (HR, 0.76; 80% CI, 0.61-0.94; P= 0.103) and 10 mg (HR, 0.83; 80% CI, 0.67-1.02; P= 0.254). The most commonly reported adverse events considered to be related to zibotentan treatment were peripheral oedema, headache and nasal congestion.

This measure implicitly assumes linearity of the log-rates over the intervals in question, which may not be valid, especially for relatively longer time-intervals. An alternative is the Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC), which computes a weighted average of APC values over intervals where log-rates are piece-wise linear. In this article, we propose a Bayesian approach to calculating APC and AAPC values from age-adjusted cancer rate data. The procedure involves modeling the corresponding counts using age-specific Poisson regression models with a log-link function that contains unknown joinpoints. The slope-changes at the joinpoints are assumed to have a mixture distribution with point mass at zero and the joinpoints are assumed to be uniformly distributed subject to order-restrictions. Additionally, the age-specific intercept parameters are modeled nonparametrically using a Dirichlet process prior. The proposed method can be used to construct Bayesian credible intervals for AAPC using age-adjusted mortality rates. This provides a significant improvement over the currently available frequentist method, where variance calculations are done conditional on the joinpoint locations. Simulation studies are used to demonstrate the success of the method in capturing trend-changes.

A total of 42,503 men, aged 55-74 years, were included in a clinical population in Northern Ireland. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <20.0 ng/mL was measured in all men at study entry. All men were followed for prostate cancer incidence and causes of death until December 31, 2006.  Results:   The adjusted absolute difference in prostate cancer specific mortality between the intervention population and the clinical population increased with increasing PSA level at study entry, ie, 0.05 per 10,000 person-years for men who had a serum PSA level of 0.0-1.9 ng/mL and 8.8 per 10,000 person-years for men who had a serum PSA level of 10-19.9 ng/mL. To evaluate the risks of early detection, the number needed to investigate (NNI) and number needed to treat (NNT) to save 1 death from prostate cancer were calculated.

The main aim of the present work was to investigate the potential cytotoxic effects of aqueous and methanolic extracts of four Phyllanthus species (P.amarus, P.niruri, P.urinaria and P.watsonii) against skin melanoma and prostate cancer cells.  Methodology/principal findings:   Phyllanthus plant appears to possess cytotoxic properties with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 150-300 µg/ml for aqueous extract and 50-150 µg/ml for methanolic extract that were determined using the MTS reduction assay. In comparison, the plant extracts did not show any significant cytotoxicity on normal human skin (CCD-1127Sk) and prostate (RWPE-1) cells. The extracts appeared to act by causing the formation of a clear ""ladder"" fragmentation of apoptotic DNA on agarose gel, displayed TUNEL-positive cells with an elevation of caspase-3 and -7 activities. The Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) level was lower than 15% in Phyllanthus treated-cancer cells. These indicate that Phyllanthus extracts have the ability to induce apoptosis with minimal necrotic effects. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that Phyllanthus induced a Go/G1-phase arrest on PC-3 cells and a S-phase arrest on MeWo cells and these were accompanied by accumulation of cells in the Sub-G1 (apoptosis) phase. The cytotoxic properties may be due to the presence of polyphenol compounds such as ellagitannins, gallotannins, flavonoids and phenolic acids found both in the water and methanol extract of the plants.  Conclusions/significance:   Phyllanthus plant exerts its growth inhibition effect in a selective manner towards cancer cells through the modulation of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis via caspases activation in melanoma and prostate cancer cells.

To circumvent this, cancer cells develop mechanisms to cluster supernumerary centrosomes to form bipolar spindles, enabling successful mitosis. Disruption of centrosome clustering thus provides a selective means of killing supernumerary centrosome-harboring cancer cells. Although the mechanisms of centrosome clustering are poorly understood, recent genetic analyses have identified requirements for both actin and tubulin regulating proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that the integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a protein critically involved in actin and mitotic microtubule organization, is required for centrosome clustering. Inhibition of ILK expression or activity inhibits centrosome clustering in several breast and prostate cancer cell lines that have centrosome amplification. Furthermore, cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes are significantly more sensitive to ILK inhibition than cells with two centrosomes, demonstrating that inhibiting ILK offers a selective means of targeting cancer cells. Live cell analysis shows ILK perturbation leads cancer cells to undergo multipolar anaphases, mitotic arrest and cell death in mitosis. We also show that ILK performs its centrosome clustering activity in a focal adhesion-independent, but centrosome-dependent, manner through the microtubule regulating proteins TACC3 and ch-TOG.

Current evidence suggests a role for GPR55 as a receptor for the lysophospholipid lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). In this study, we show that GPR55 is expressed in several prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines, both at the mRNA and at the protein level, and that it has a critical role in regulating proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. We further show that GPR55 mediates the effects of LPI in prostate and ovarian cancer cells. Indeed we demonstrate that LPI is able to induce calcium mobilization and activation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in these cells and that both pharmacological blockade of GPR55 and its downregulation using specific small interfering RNA strongly inhibits these processes. We further identify an autocrine loop by which LPI is synthesized by cytosolic phospholipase A2, pumped out of the cell by the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCC1/MRP1, and is then able to initialize cascades downstream of GPR55. All together, these data demonstrate a role of LPI and its receptor GPR55 in cancer cells in activating an autocrine loop that regulates cell proliferation. These findings may have important implications for LPI as a novel cancer biomarker and for its receptor GPR55 as a potential therapeutic target.""","""['R Piñeiro', 'T Maffucci', 'M Falasca']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Lysophosphatidylinositol: a novel link between ABC transporters and G-protein-coupled receptors.', 'The GPR 55 agonist, L-α-lysophosphatidylinositol, mediates ovarian carcinoma cell-induced angiogenesis.', 'Lysophosphatidylinositol signalling: new wine from an old bottle.', 'L-α-lysophosphatidylinositol meets GPR55: a deadly relationship.', 'The actions and metabolism of lysophosphatidylinositol, an endogenous agonist for GPR55.', 'Lysophosphatidylinositol Promotes Chemotaxis and Cytokine Synthesis in Mast Cells with Differential Participation of GPR55 and CB2 Receptors.', 'Drug-Drug Interactions of Cannabidiol with Standard-of-Care Chemotherapeutics.', 'Thienopyrimidine Derivatives as GPR55 Receptor Antagonists: Insight into Structure-Activity Relationship.', 'Use of Cannabis and Cannabinoids for Treatment of Cancer.', 'Lysophosphatidylinositol Induced Morphological Changes and Stress Fiber Formation through the GPR55-RhoA-ROCK Pathway.']"""

Elevated cellular SK1 activity and S1P levels enhance cell proliferation and survival, and are strongly implicated in tumourigenesis. Regulation of SK1 activity can occur through various mechanisms, including phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions. We have previously shown that eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) interacts with and directly activates SK1, but the mechanisms regulating this were undefined. Notably, eEF1A has GTPase activity and can exist in GTP- or GDP-bound forms, which are associated with distinct structural conformations of the protein. Here, we show that the guanine nucleotide-bound state of eEF1A regulates its ability to activate SK1, with eEF1A.GDP, but not eEF1A.GTP, enhancing SK1 activity in vitro. Furthermore, we show that enhancing cellular eEF1A.GDP levels through expression of a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor of eEF1A, translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP), increased SK1 activity in cells. We also examined a truncated isoform of eEF1A1, termed prostate tumour inducer-1 (PTI-1), which can induce neoplastic cell transformation through undefined mechanisms. PTI-1 lacks the G protein domain of eEF1A1 and is therefore unable to undergo the GTP-binding-induced conformational change. Notably, we found that PTI-1 can directly activate SK1 and that this seems to be essential for neoplastic transformation induced by PTI-1, as chemical SK1 inhibitors or overexpression of a dominant-negative SK1 blocked this process. Thus, this study defines the mechanism regulating eEF1A-mediated SK1 activation, and also establishes SK1 as being integral for PTI-1-induced oncogenesis.""","""['T M Leclercq', 'P A B Moretti', 'S M Pitson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Eukaryotic elongation factor 1A interacts with sphingosine kinase and directly enhances its catalytic activity.', 'De novo biosynthesis of dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate by sphingosine kinase 1 in mammalian cells.', 'Enhanced expression of transferrin receptor 1 contributes to oncogenic signalling by sphingosine kinase 1.', 'Roles, regulation and inhibitors of sphingosine kinase 2.', 'The translation elongation factor 1A in tumorigenesis, signal transduction and apoptosis: review article.', 'Overexpressing eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) proteins to promote corticospinal axon repair after injury.', ""A novel 3'tRNA-derived fragment tRF-Val promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis by targeting EEF1A1 in gastric cancer."", 'Binding of eEF1A2 to the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR modulates its activity and promotes tumour cell survival.', 'EEF1D overexpression promotes osteosarcoma cell proliferation by facilitating Akt-mTOR and Akt-bad signaling.', 'Insights into the role and regulation of TCTP in skeletal muscle.']"""

In the United States, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is common and increases the detection of prostate cancer. We evaluated whether the prostate cancer deficit among men with AIDS reflects differential PSA screening.  Methods:   Data from the U.S. HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study were used to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for prostate cancer, comparing men with AIDS (N = 287,247) to the general population. Furthermore, we estimated PSA testing rates in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort.  Results:   Prostate cancer rates increased over time in the general population and, beginning in the 1990s, were consistently higher than among men with AIDS. Men with AIDS had the same prostate cancer risk as the general population in the pre-PSA era (<1992, SIR = 1.00), but significantly reduced risk during the PSA era overall (1992-2007, SIR = 0.50) and across age, race, HIV risk group, antiretroviral therapy era, and CD4 counts. Local and regional stage prostate cancer risk was lower among men with AIDS (SIRs, 0.49 and 0.14, respectively), but distant stage cancer risk did not differ (SIR = 0.85). Among HIV-infected men ≥40 years old, PSA testing was uncommon (18.7% per year), but increased 2.4-fold from 2000 to 2008, after age adjustment.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer risk was decreased by 50% among men with AIDS compared with the general population. This deficit was limited to the PSA era and early stage cancers.

To date, only high Gleason scores are best associated with a poor prognosis in prostate cancer. No validated serum biomarker has been identified with prognostic power. Previous studies showed that secretory phospholipase A2-IIa (sPLA2-IIa) is overexpressed in almost all human prostate cancer specimens and its elevated levels are correlated with high tumor grade. Here, we found that sPLA2-IIa is overexpressed in androgen-independent prostate cancer LNCaP-AI cells relative to their androgen-dependent LNCaP cell counterparts. LNCaP-AI cells also secrete significantly higher levels of sPLA2-IIa. Blocking sPLA2-IIa function compromises androgen-independent cell growth. Inhibition of the ligand-induced signaling output of the HER network, by blocking PI3K-Akt signaling and the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB)-mediated pathway, compromises both sPLA2-IIa protein expression and secretion, as a result of downregulation of sPLA2-IIa promoter activity. More importantly, we demonstrated elevated serum sPLA2-IIa levels in prostate cancer patients. High serum sPLA2-IIa levels are associated significantly with high Gleason score and advanced disease stage. Increased sPLA2-IIa expression was confirmed in prostate cancer cells, but not in normal epithelium and stroma by immunohistochemistry analysis. We showed that elevated signaling of the HER/HER2-PI3K-Akt-NF-κB pathway contributes to sPLA2-IIa overexpression and secretion by prostate cancer cells. Given that sPLA2-IIa overexpression is associated with prostate development and progression, serum sPLA2-IIa may serve as a prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer and a potential surrogate prostate biomarker indicative of tumor burden.""","""['Zhongyun Dong', 'Yin Liu', 'Kieran F Scott', 'Linda Levin', 'Krishnanath Gaitonde', 'R Bruce Bracken', 'Barbara Burke', 'Qihui Jim Zhai', 'Jiang Wang', 'Leslie Oleksowicz', 'Shan Lu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Secretory phospholipase A2-IIa is a target gene of the HER/HER2-elicited pathway and a potential plasma biomarker for poor prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'Vav3 oncogene is involved in regulation of secretory phospholipase A2-IIa expression in prostate cancer.', 'Secretory phospholipase A2-IIa upregulates HER/HER2-elicited signaling in lung cancer cells.', 'Chemoaffinity capture of pre-targeted prostate cancer cells with magnetic beads.', 'Old but New: Group IIA Phospholipase A2 as a Modulator of Gut Microbiota.', 'Corosolic Acid Inhibits Secretory Phospholipase A2IIa as an Anti-Inflammatory Function and Exhibits Anti-Tumor Activity in Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma Bearing Mice.', 'Quercitrin neutralizes sPLA2IIa activity, reduces the inflammatory IL-6 level in PC3 cell lines, and exhibits anti-tumor activity in the EAC-bearing mice model.', 'Inflammatory Effects of Bothrops Phospholipases A2: Mechanisms Involved in Biosynthesis of Lipid Mediators and Lipid Accumulation.', 'Human Group IIA Phospholipase A2-Three Decades on from Its Discovery.', 'Prostate Cancer Progression: as a Matter of Fats.']"""

Our findings indicate that only mutations in the G-helix attenuated inhibition of cell migration by maspin and that this structural element is also involved in the effect of maspin on cell adhesion.

The EphA2 receptor is highly expressed in most cancer cell types, where it has disparate activities that are not well understood. It has been reported that interplay of EphA2 with oncogenic signaling pathways promotes cancer cell malignancy independently of ephrin ligand binding and receptor kinase activity. In contrast, stimulation of EphA2 signaling with ephrin-A ligands can suppress malignancy by inhibiting the Ras-MAP kinase pathway, integrin-mediated adhesion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Here we show that ephrin-A1 ligand-dependent activation of EphA2 decreases the growth of PC3 prostate cancer cells and profoundly inhibits the Akt-mTORC1 pathway, which is hyperactivated due to loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor. Our results do not implicate changes in the activity of Akt upstream regulators (such as Ras family GTPases, PI3 kinase, integrins, or the Ship2 lipid phosphatase) in the observed loss of Akt T308 and S473 phosphorylation downstream of EphA2. Indeed, EphA2 can inhibit Akt phosphorylation induced by oncogenic mutations of not only PTEN but also PI3 kinase. Furthermore, it can decrease the hyperphosphorylation induced by constitutive membrane-targeting of Akt. Our data suggest a novel signaling mechanism whereby EphA2 inactivates the Akt-mTORC1 oncogenic pathway through Akt dephosphorylation mediated by a serine/threonine phosphatase. Ephrin-A1-induced Akt dephosphorylation was observed not only in PC3 prostate cancer cells but also in other cancer cell types. Thus, activation of EphA2 signaling represents a possible new avenue for anti-cancer therapies that exploit the remarkable ability of this receptor to counteract multiple oncogenic signaling pathways.""","""['Nai-Ying Yang', 'Carlos Fernandez', 'Melanie Richter', 'Zhan Xiao', 'Fatima Valencia', 'David A Tice', 'Elena B Pasquale']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Protein kinase A can block EphA2 receptor-mediated cell repulsion by increasing EphA2 S897 phosphorylation.', 'Regulation of EphA2 receptor endocytosis by SHIP2 lipid phosphatase via phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase-dependent Rac1 activation.', 'Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and Raf/Pyk2 by growth factor-mediated Eph receptor 2 (EphA2) is required for cholangiocarcinoma growth and metastasis.', 'Targeting the translational apparatus to improve leukemia therapy: roles of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'Deregulation of the EGFR/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway in breast cancer: possibilities for therapeutic intervention.', 'A computational and laboratory approach for the investigation of interactions of peptide conjugated natural terpenes with EpHA2 receptor.', 'Eph Receptors in Cancer.', 'Molecular Patho-mechanisms of cervical cancer (MMP1).', 'Loss of H3K27 Trimethylation Promotes Radiotherapy Resistance in Medulloblastoma and Induces an Actionable Vulnerability to BET Inhibition.', 'Ligands with different dimeric configurations potently activate the EphA2 receptor and reveal its potential for biased signaling.']"""

A total of 914 patients diagnosed by TURP of the prostate between 1990 and 1996, managed conservatively were identified. The clinical end point was death from prostate cancer. Diagnostic serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and contemporary Gleason grading was available. Cancer extent was measured by the percentage of chips infiltrated by cancer. Death rates were compared by univariate and multivariate proportional hazards models, including baseline PSA and Gleason score. The percentage of positive chips was highly predictive of prostate cancer death when assessed as a continuous variable or as a grouped variable on the basis of and including the quintiles, quartiles, tertiles and median groups.

The incidence of both syndromes is much higher in males than females. Clinical and basic studies suggest that testosterone plays an important role in ventricular repolarization.  Methods and results:   Standard surface 12-lead electrocardiograms recorded in 640 healthy subjects were studied (310 males, 330 females ranging in age from 5 to 89 years) (Study 1). The 3 ST levels (ST-J, -M, and -E) were measured in leads V(2) and V(5), which are representative of the right and left ventricles, respectively. The effect of androgen-deprivation therapy on the ST segment was also evaluated in 21 prostate cancer patients (Study 2). In both leads, the 3 ST levels were significantly higher in adult males than females (P<0.0001) due to a marked increase after puberty in males. As their age increased, males manifested a gradual reduction in the ST level in both leads; in females, there was a reduction in lead V(5) only. In both sexes, all 3 ST levels were significantly higher in lead V(2) than V(5) (P<0.0001). Androgen-deprivation therapy significantly decreased all 3 ST segments in both leads.

Background:   Recruitment of participants to cancer prevention trials is challenging and costly and more efficient methods are needed.  Methods:   SELECT participants were males ≥60 years old who were solicited with two recruitment strategies. In the control strategy, potential participants, identified through purchased mailing lists, were sent a SELECT invitation letter. In the 'spouse' strategy, letters were sent to married postmenopausal women already participating in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) at our clinical center asking them to provide an enclosed SELECT invitation letter (identical to the one in the control strategy) to the 'man in her life'. Our hypothesis was that SELECT recruitment of men would be enhanced by this indirect mailing to their spouses already participating in a similar program.  Results:   In the control strategy, 183,315 invitation letters were mailed to 60,000 men; cumulative response was 2.16%; 600 men ultimately enrolled in SELECT (15.1% of respondents) for a mailing recruitment cost of $259 per participant. In the spouse strategy, 800 women participating in WHI clinical studies had husbands; of the 2214 invitation letters mailed to this group of women, cumulative response was 2.75%; 34 men ultimately enrolled in SELECT (55.7% of respondents) for a mailing recruitment cost of $59 per participant.  Limitation:   Process information on how invitation letters were handled in the spouse strategy was not collected.

Single-shot echo planner images (SS-EPI) were used for comparison.  Materials and methods:   Twenty prostate tumors were examined by conventional MRI in 14 patients prior to radical prostatectomy. All patients were examined with a 1.5-T MR imager (Signa CV/i ver. 9.1 GE Medical System Milwaukee, WI, USA). Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) using LSDI was performed with a pelvic phased-array coil, with b values of 5 and 800 s/mm². DWI using SS-EPI was performed with a body coil, with b values of 0 and 800 s/mm². The ADCs of each sequence for 14 normal prostate and 20 prostate cancers were histopathologically assessed. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on DWI was estimated and compared for each sequence.  Results:   The mean ADCs (±S.D.) of normal peripheral zones (PZ), transition zones (TZ) and cancer (in 10⁻³ mm²/s) that used LSDI were 1.42±0.12, 1.23±0.10 and 0.79±0.19, respectively. Those that used SS-EPI were 1.76±0.26, 1.38±0.20 and 1.05±0.27, respectively. Using unpaired t test (P<.05), we found a significant difference in each sequence between normal tissue (both PZ and TZ) and the cancer. Paired t test (P<.05) also registered a significant difference between LSDI and SS-EPI. Mean SNR for DWI using LSDI was 16.49±5.03, while the DWI using SS-EPI was 18.85±9.26. The difference between the SNR of each sequence was not statistically significant by paired t test.

Knockdown of FUT3 expression in MDA PCa2b cells by small interference RNA (siRNA) significantly reduced FUT3 expression. Cell-surface sialyl Lewis antigens were largely abolished. Cell adhesion and cell rolling on the blood vessel wall were simulated by perfusing cancer cells through microtubes coated with recombinant human E-selectin. At physiological levels of wall shear stress, the number of flowing cancer cells recruited to the microtube surface was dramatically reduced by FUT3 knockdown. Higher rolling velocity was also observed, which is consistent with reduced E-selectin binding activity. Interestingly, FUT3 siRNA treatment also significantly reduced the cell growth rate.

It has been proposed that cancer cells can be selectively sensitized to radiation by adenovirus replication or by using radiosensitizing transgenes. Adenoviral proteins E1B55K, E4orf3, and E4orf6 play a role in radiosensitization, by targeting the Mre11, Rad50, and NBS1 complex (MRN) and inhibiting DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. We hypothesize that combined with irradiation, these adenoviral proteins increase cell killing through the impairment of DSB repair.  Methods and materials:   We assessed the radiosensitizing/additive potential of replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing E1B55K, E4orf3, and E4orf6 proteins. Combination treatments with low-dose external photon beam radiotherapy were studied in prostate cancer (PC-3MM2 and DU-145), breast cancer (M4A4-LM3), and head and neck cancer (UT-SCC8) cell lines. We further demonstrated radiosensitizing or additive effects in mice with PC-3MM2 tumors.  Results:   We show enhanced cell killing with adenovirus and radiation combination treatment. Co-infection with several of the viruses did not further increase cell killing, suggesting that both E4orf6 and E4orf3 are potent in MRN inhibition.

Methods and materials:   A group of 120 patients (60 in each group) was surveyed prospectively before radiation therapy (RT) (time A), at the last day of RT (time B), at a median time of 2 months (time C) and >1 year after RT (time D) using a validated questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite). All patients were treated with 1.8- to 2.0-Gy fractions up to 70.2 to 72.0 Gy with or without WPRT up to 45 to 46 Gy. Pairs were matched according to the following criteria: age±5 years, planning target volume±10 cc (considering planning target volume without pelvic nodes for WPRT patients), urinary/bowel/sexual function score before RT±10, and use of antiandrogens.  Results:   With the exception of prognostic risk factors, both groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics. No significant differences were found with regard to urinary and sexual score changes. Mean bladder function scores reached baseline levels in both patient subgroups after RT. However, bowel function scores decreased significantly more for patients after WPRT than in those receiving PORT at all times (p<0.01, respectively). Significant differences were found for most items in the bowel domain in the acute phase. At time D, patients after WPRT reported rectal urgency (>once a day in 15% vs. 3%; p=0.03), bloody stools (≥half the time in 7% vs. 0%; p=0.04) and frequent bowel movements (>two on a typical day in 32% vs. 7%; p<0.01) more often than did patients after PORT.  Conclusion:   In comparison to PORT, WPRT (larger bladder and rectum volumes in medium dose levels, but similar volumes in high dose levels) was associated with decreased bowel quality of life in the acute and chronic phases after treatment but remained without adverse long-term urinary effects.""","""['Michael Pinkawa', 'Marc D Piroth', 'Richard Holy', 'Karin Fischedick', 'Jens Klotz', 'Dalma Székely-Orbán', 'Michael J Eble']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Health-related quality of life after adjuvant and salvage postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer - a prospective analysis.', 'Low-grade toxicity after conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer--impact of bladder volume.', 'Volume and hormonal effects for acute side effects of rectum and bladder during conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', '18F-fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine (FET) in glioblastoma (FIG) TROG 18.06 study: protocol for a prospective, multicentre PET/CT trial.', ""Prostate only radiotherapy using external beam radiotherapy: A clinician's perspective."", 'Association between pelvic nodal radiotherapy and patient-reported functional outcomes through 5 years among men undergoing external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: An assessment of the comparative effectiveness analysis of surgery and radiation (CEASAR) cohort.', 'Toxicity of pelvic nodal radiation for localized prostate cancer.', 'Treatment-Related Toxicity Using Prostate-Only Versus Prostate and Pelvic Lymph Node Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy: A National Population-Based Study.']"""

Recently, we presented quasi intensity modulated arc therapy (qIMAT), a step-and-shoot technique that simulates a rotational technique by using a high number of beams and reducing the number of segments. In the present work, we applied a combination of both techniques to optimize an anal cancer case. Because of the limited memory of standard computers, two techniques for reducing the size of the inverse kernel (IK) were investigated. The standard deviation degradation technique (SDDT) and the reduced resolution technique (RRT) were applied to a 7-field IMRT plan on the CarPet phantom. Several IKs with an estimated standard deviation (SD) of the MC-calculation of 5%, 10% and 15% and another three IKs with voxel size of 4, 8 and 16mm were calculated. All IKs were optimized with DMCO; after optimization, a final dose calculation with 5% SD and 4mm resolution was carried out. SDDT was a better compromise between plan quality and IK-size reduction than RRT. PTV homogeneity and dose sparing to the OAR was almost identical for SDDT, while for RRT the quality was degraded by low resolution. Therefore, SDDT was applied to the anal cancer case. The IK-file of a quasi-IMAT plan with 30 beams was calculated with XVMC with 15% SD and a voxel size of 4mm. After optimization with DMCO using one segment per beam, a final dose calculation with 2% variance was performed. By comparing the DVHs of qIMAT with a 7-field IMRT (commercial therapy planning system) and with a 7-field IMRT (DMCO), qIMAT showed considerably advantages over IMRT in OARs dose sparing. In this way, the DMCO optimization with qIMAT of complex cases with large treatment volumes, such as anal cancer, are possible. Furthermore, for anal cancer, the comparison of qIMAT with IMRT showed that qIMAT can improve the plan quality.""","""['Judith Alvarez-Moret', 'Thomas Dirscherl', 'Mark Rickhey', 'Ludwig Bogner']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Z Med Phys""","""['Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Fast direct Monte Carlo optimization using the inverse kernel approach.', 'Advantage of biological over physical optimization in prostate cancer?', 'Foundations of the Monte Carlo method for dose calculation in radiotherapy.', 'Monte Carlo-assisted voxel source kernel method (MAVSK) for internal beta dosimetry.']"""

Here it is investigated what the possible dosimetric impact of such a marker could be, if used in proton or carbon ion treatment.  Material and methods:   The simulations have been done using the Monte Carlo particle transport code FLUKA with its default hadron therapy settings. A 3 cm long stent is approximated in FLUKA by stacking hollow tori. To simulate realistic clinical conditions a field 5 × 5 cm has been used, delivering a 5 cm wide spread out Bragg peak located 5 cm deep for protons and carbon ions. For protons fields mimicking active and passive beam delivery have been investigated. The stent has been arranged perpendicular, turned 45 degrees, and parallel to the beam axis.  Results:   The position of the 95% dose level shifts for carbon ions 7 mm in proximal direction for the marker perpendicular to the beam and 8 mm if the stent is turned 45 degree for a 1 × 1 cm dose binning on the centre beam axis. For the case where the stent was parallel to beam direction the 95% dose level shifts 26 mm. For active delivered protons, the shift of the 95% dose level is less. The shift for a perpendicular arranged marker is 6 mm, for 45 degrees turned it is 7 mm. For the case where the stent was oriented parallel to the beam, the observed shift is 21 mm. Dose inhomogeneities caused by straggling effects occur only near the distal edge of the field.  Conclusions:   The results of our investigations show that the Ni-Ti marker has a non negligible impact on the dose distributions for the used radiation types. However if the treatment plan rules out narrow angles between symmetry axis of the stent and the beam direction, this may be compensated.""","""['Rochus Herrmann', 'Jesper Carl', 'Oliver Jäkel', 'Niels Bassler', 'Jørgen B B Petersen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Monte Carlo investigation of collimator scatter of proton-therapy beams produced using the passive scattering method.', 'Dosimetric characterization of a microDiamond detector in clinical scanned carbon ion beams.', 'Quantification of dose perturbations induced by external and internal accessories in ocular proton therapy and evaluation of their dosimetric impact.', 'Dosimetry of clinical neutron and proton beams: an overview of recommendations.', 'A review of proton beam radiation therapy.', 'Assessment of dose perturbations for metal stent in photon and proton radiotherapy plans for hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Experimental Comparison of Fiducial Markers Used in Proton Therapy: Study of Different Imaging Modalities and Proton Fluence Perturbations Measured With CMOS Pixel Sensors.', 'Value of Three-Dimensional Imaging Systems for Image-Guided Carbon Ion Radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of different fiducial markers for image-guided radiotherapy and particle therapy.', 'A semi-empirical model for the therapeutic range shift estimation caused by inhomogeneities in proton beam therapy.']"""

The motion may be compensated by dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) tracking. Previous work has demonstrated that a single kV imager can accurately localize moving targets for DMLC tracking during rotational delivery, however this method has not been investigated for the static gantry geometry used for conformal and IMRT treatments. In this study we investigate the accuracy of single kV-imager based DMLC tracking for static-gantry delivery.  Material and methods:   A 5-field treatment plan with circular field shape and 200 MU per field was delivered in 20 s per field to a moving phantom with an embedded gold marker. Fluoroscopic kV images were acquired at 5 Hz perpendicular to the treatment beam axis during a 120° pre-treatment gantry rotation, during treatment delivery, and during inter-field gantry rotations. The three-dimensional marker position was estimated from the kV images and used for MLC adaptation. Experiments included 12 thoracic/abdominal tumor trajectories and five prostate trajectories selected from databases with 160 and 548 trajectories, respectively. The tracking error was determined as the mismatch between the marker position and the MLC aperture center in portal images. Simulations extended the study to all trajectories in the databases and to treatments with prolonged duration of 60 s per field.  Results:   In the experiments, the mean root-mean-square (rms) tracking error was 0.9 mm (perpendicular to MLC) and 1.1 mm (parallel to MLC) for thoracic/abdominal tumor trajectories and 0.6 mm (perpendicular) and 0.5 mm (parallel) for prostate trajectories. Simulations of these experiments agreed to within 0.1 mm. Simulations of all trajectories in the databases resulted in mean rms tracking errors of 0.6 mm (perpendicular) and 0.9 mm (parallel) for thorax/abdomen tumors and 0.4 mm (perpendicular) and 0.2 mm (parallel) for prostate for both 20 s and 60 s per field.  Conclusion:   Single kV imager DMLC tracking, which is fully compatible with IMRT, was demonstrated for static fields.

Methods to predict adverse effects in the rectum are therefore important but their precision often limited, not the least by the internal motion of this organ. In this study late rectal morbidity is investigated in relation to the internal motion of the rectum by applying the 'Planning organ at Risk Volume' (PRV) concept.  Materials and methods:   Late rectal morbidity was analysed in 242 prostate cancer patients treated to 70 Gy with conformal RT to either the prostate, the prostate and seminal vesicles or the whole pelvis (initial 50 Gy only). Late rectal morbidity was classified by the late gastro-intestinal (GI) RTOG toxicity scoring system. Cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were derived for the rectum OR and six rectum PRVs i.e. the OR expanded with six different margins (narrow/intermediate/wide in anterior direction or in both anterior and posterior direction). The difference in rectum dose-volume parameters between patients with Grade 0-1 vs. Grade 2 or higher morbidity was investigated by logistic regression and permutation tests.  Results:   Late Grade 2 or higher morbidity was observed in 25 of 242 (10%) patients. The logistic regression analysis and the permutation tests reached significance (p ≤ 0.05) for only one dose level of the rectum OR (40 Gy). For the PRVs, several dose levels were found to be significant (p-value range: 0.01-0.046), most pronounced for the PRV with narrow margins of 6 mm anterior and 5 mm posterior with five intermediate (38-42 Gy) and ten high (62-71 Gy) dose levels.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a deformable image registration application for propagation of contours using repeat CT scans of the pelvis, a region where considerable deformations are expected.  Material and methods:   The study involved four prostate cancer patients, each with 9-11 repeat CT scans. An oncologist contoured bladder, rectum, clinical target volume of pelvic lymph nodes (CTV-ln) and prostate (CTV-p) in all CT scans. The reference CT was retrospectively registered to the repeat CT scans with both rigid and deformable registration using a recently released commercial clinical software application. Two different diffusion-based 'demons' deformable registration algorithms were applied, differing in the amount of deformations being allowed, with algorithm A being more generous than algorithm B. The evaluation of the propagated structures included both quantitative measures and qualitative scoring.  Results:   We found the differences between the algorithms to be most evident for bladder and rectum. An increase in mean Dice similarity coefficient relative the rigid registrations of 12% and 13% was obtained with algorithm A for bladder and rectum, compared to 2% with algorithm B. For bladder the mean sensitivity and positive predictive value was 0.92 and 0.87 with algorithm A and 0.82 and 0.83 with algorithm B.

Further, we evaluate the potential of such parameters in radiotherapy response assessment.  Material and methods:   Male, athymic mice with prostate carcinoma xenografts were subjected to dynamic PET either untreated (n=8) or 24 h post-irradiation (7.5 Gy single dose, n=8). After 10 h of fasting, intravenous bolus injections of 10-15 MBq (18)F-FDG were administered and a 1 h dynamic PET scan was performed. 4D emission data were reconstructed using OSEM-MAP, before remote post-processing. Individual arterial input functions were extracted from the image series. Subsequently, tumor (18)F-FDG uptake was fitted voxel-by-voxel to a compartment model, producing kinetic parameter maps.  Results:   The kinetic model separated the (18)F-FDG uptake into free and bound tracer and quantified three parameters; forward tracer diffusion (k(1)), backward tracer diffusion (k(2)), and rate of (18)F-FDG phosphorylation, i.e. the glucose metabolism (k(3)). The fitted kinetic model gave a goodness of fit (r(2)) to the observed data ranging from 0.91 to 0.99, and produced parametrical images of all tumors included in the study. Untreated tumors showed homogeneous intra-group median values of all three parameters (k(1), k(2) and k(3)), whereas the parameters significantly increased in the tumors irradiated 24 h prior to (18)F-FDG PET.

This study aimed to investigate its expression in prostate cancer and its role as a prognostic factor in this setting.  Material and methods:   A tissue microarray was constructed of 289 prostate cancers from radical prostatectomy specimens with a median follow-up of 48.9 months. Slides were immunostained for β-tubulin III. The intensity and extent of immunoreactivity and their product [immunoreactivity product (IRP)] were evaluated.  Results:   Tubulin III was expressed in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells but not in benign glands. Only 11.6% of cancers were positive for tubulin III. Among low-grade (Gleason score 5-6) and high-grade (Gleason score 7-10) cancers, 6.0% and 16.6% were positive, respectively (p = 0.006). β-Tubulin III expression was more often seen in high-stage disease and more often in metastases (62.5%) than in primary lesions (11.6%) (p < 0.001). The intensity, extent and IRP of tubulin III all predicted biochemical recurrence in univariate Cox analysis (p = 0.02, p = 0.048 and p = 0.012, respectively). IRP was an independent predictor of prognosis when adjusted for serum prostate-specific antigen in a multivariate Cox analysis (p = 0.005), but not when the Gleason score was added to the model (p = 0.17).  Conclusion:   β-Tubulin III predicts biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in a subset of patients.

The purpose of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of detecting systematic errors in MLC leaf bank position with patient specific checks.  Methods:   9 head and neck (H&N) and 14 prostate IMRT beams were delivered using MLC files containing systematic offsets (+/- 1 mm in two banks, +/- 0.5 mm in two banks, and 1 mm in one bank of leaves). The beams were measured using both MAPCHECK (Sun Nuclear Corp., Melbourne, FL) and the aS1000 electronic portal imaging device (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Comparisons with calculated fields, without offsets, were made using commonly adopted criteria including absolute dose (AD) difference, relative dose difference, distance to agreement (DTA), and the gamma index.  Results:   The criteria most sensitive to systematic leaf bank offsets were the 3% AD, 3 mm DTA for MAPCHECK and the gamma index with 2% AD and 2 mm DTA for the EPID. The criterion based on the relative dose measurements was the least sensitive to MLC offsets. More highly modulated fields, i.e., H&N, showed greater changes in the percentage of passing points due to systematic MLC inaccuracy than prostate fields.  Conclusions:   None of the techniques or criteria tested is sufficiently sensitive, with the population of IMRT fields, to detect a systematic MLC offset at a clinically significant level on an individual field.

Methods:   Dosimetry of 3D and IMRT plans for 48 patients was compared. Volumes of prostate, SV, rectum, and bladder, and prescriptions were the same for both plans. For both 3D and IMRT plans, expansion margins to prostate+SV (CTV) and prostate were 0.5 cm posterior and superior and 1 cm in other dimensions to create PTV and CDPTV, respectively. Six-field 3D plans were prepared retrospectively. For 3D plans, an additional 0.5 cm margin was added to PTV and CDPTV. Prescription for both 3D and IMRT plans was the same: 45 Gy to CTV followed by a 36 Gy boost to prostate. Dosimetry parameters common to 3D and IMRT plans were used for comparison: Mean doses to prostate, CDPTV, SV, rectum, bladder, and femurs; percent volume of rectum and bladder receiving 30 (V30), 50 (V50), and 70 Gy (V70), dose to 30% of rectum and bladder, minimum and maximum point dose to CDPTV, and prescription dose covering 95% of CDPTV (D95).  Results:   When the data for all patients were combined, mean dose to prostate and CDPTV was higher with 3D than IMRT plans (P < 0.01). Mean D95 to CDPTV was the same for 3D and IMRT plans (P > 0.2). On average, among all cases, the minimum point dose was less for 3D-CRT plans and the maximum point dose was greater for 3D-CRT than for IMRT (P < 0.01). Mean dose to 30%, rectum with 3D and IMRT plans was comparable (P > 0.1). V30 was less (P < 0.01), V50 was the same (P > 0.2), and V70 was more (P < 0.01) for rectum with 3D than IMRT plans. Mean dose to bladder was less with 3D than IMRT plans (P < 0.01). V30 for bladder with 3D plans was less than that of IMRT plans (P < 0.01). V50 and V70 for 3D plans were the same for 3D and IMRT plans (P > 0.2). Mean dose to femurs was more with 3D than IMRT plans (P < 0.01). For a given patient, mean dose and dose to 30% rectum and bladder were less with 3D than IMRT plans for prostate or prostate+SV volumes <65 (38/48) and 85 cm3 (39/48), respectively (P < 0.01). The larger the dose to rectum or bladder with 3D plans, the larger also was the dose to these structures with IMRT (P < 0.001). For both 3D and IMRT plans, dose to rectum and bladder increased with the increase in the volumes of prostate and seminal vesicles (P < 0.02 to 0.001).  Conclusions:   Volumes of prostate and seminal vesicles provide a reproducible and consistent basis for considering patients for treatment with image-guided 3D or IMRT plans. Patients with prostate and prostate+SV volumes <65 and 85 cm3, respectively, would be suitable for 3D-CRT.

The images are used to determine a couch shift that realigns the tumor with the position obtained in the planning CT. However, this manual image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) technique is operator dependent, time consuming, offers limited degrees of freedom, and requires significant imaging dose over the course of treatment. To overcome these problems, the authors propose two fully automatic IGRT techniques that require significantly less imaging dose.  Methods:   Dose is reduced by lowering the x-ray tube mA s during CBCT acquisition at the cost of increasing image noise. In ""forward"" IGRT, the CBCT image is automatically registered to the planning CT to obtain the necessary couch shift. The ""reverse"" technique offers additional degrees of freedom as it involves nonrigid registration of the planning CT to the CBCT. Both techniques were evaluated using images of an anthropomorphic phantom with simulated motion and by retrospectively analyzing data from ten prostate cancer patients.  Results:   IGRT error for the phantom data at 100% relative imaging dose was 8.2 +/- 3.7, 3.5 +/- 1.2,, and 2.1 +/- 0.6 mm for setup only, forward, and reverse techniques, respectively. For patient images acquired at 100% relative imaging dose, the errors were 5.4 +/- 1.7, 5.0 +/- 1.6, 5.0 +/- 2.0, and 4.0 +/- 1.6 mm for setup only, manual forward (performed clinically), automatic forward, and reverse IGRT, respectively. Furthermore, imaging dose could be reduced to 20% without a significant loss in image guidance accuracy.  Conclusions:   The presented image guidance methods are accurate while requiring only 20% of the standard imaging dose. The combination of low dose, automation, and accuracy enables frequent corrections during treatment, possibly leading to reduced margins and improved treatment outcomes.""","""['Marcin Wierzbicki', 'Bryan Schaly', 'Terry Peters', 'Rob Barnett']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Validation of a deformable image registration technique for cone beam CT-based dose verification.', 'Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'Set-up errors and planning margins in planar and CBCT image-guided radiotherapy using three different imaging systems: A clinical study for prostate and head-and-neck cancer.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Technological approaches to in-room CBCT imaging.', 'A comparison of robotic arm versus gantry linear accelerator stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Computerized estimation of patient setup errors in portal images based on localized pelvic templates for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Reconstruction of a cone-beam CT image via forward iterative projection matching.']"""

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a group of tanshinones from a Chinese herb Salvia Miltiorrhiza, cryptotanshinone (CT), tanshinone IIA (T2A) and tanshinone I (T1) on prostate cancer. The in vitro studies showed that these tanshinones inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. Among three compounds, T1 had the most potent activity with IC(50) s around 3-6 μM. On the other hand, tanshinones had much less adverse effects on the growth of normal prostate epithelial cells. The epigenetic pathway focused array assay identified Aurora A kinase as a possible target of tanshinone actions. The expression of Aurora A was overexpressed in prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, knockdown of Aurora A in prostate cancer cells significantly decreased cell growth. Tanshinones significantly downregulated the Aurora A expression, suggesting Aurora A may be a functional target of tanshinones. Tanshinones, especially T1, also showed potent anti-angiogenesis activity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, T1 inhibited the growth of DU145 prostate tumor in mice associated with induction of apoptosis, decrease of proliferation, inhibition of angiogenesis and downregulation of Aurora A, whereas it did not alter food intake or body weight. Our results support that T1 may be an efficacious and safe chemopreventive or therapeutic agent against prostate cancer progression.""","""['Yi Gong', 'Yanli Li', 'Yin Lu', 'Linglin Li', 'Hamid Abdolmaleky', 'George L Blackburn', 'Jin-Rong Zhou']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Bioactive tanshinone I inhibits the growth of lung cancer in part via downregulation of Aurora A function.', 'Tanshinones inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells through epigenetic modification of Aurora A expression and function.', 'Tanshinones from Chinese medicinal herb Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) suppress prostate cancer growth and androgen receptor signaling.', 'Tanshinones: sources, pharmacokinetics and anti-cancer activities.', 'Pharmacological properties of tanshinones, the natural products from Salvia miltiorrhiza.', 'Tanshinone IIA targeting cell signaling pathways: a plausible paradigm for cancer therapy.', 'Epigenetic effects of herbal medicine.', 'Neuroprotective Effects of Geopung-Chunghyuldan Based on Its Salvianolic Acid B Content Using an In Vivo Stroke Model.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tanshinone against Prostate Cancer.', 'Research and Development of Natural Product Tanshinone I: Pharmacology, Total Synthesis, and Structure Modifications.']"""

Methods:   We evaluated 102 consecutive patients (mean age = 68 years, range = 54-82 years) previously treated with RP and who presented during FU a mild increase of trigger PSA serum levels <1.5 ng/ml: mean 0.86 ± 0.40 ng/ml (range 0.2-1.5) and median 0.93 ng/ml (range 0.67-1.10). In this patient series (11)C-choline PET/CT was used as the first imaging examination at the time of the detection of a mild serum PSA increase <1.5 ng/ml. (11)C-Choline PET/CT was performed following standard procedures in our centre. At the time of PET/CT, 86 patients were not receiving any pharmacologic treatment, while 16 were under anti-androgenic therapy. Positive PET findings were validated by: (a) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy in cases of local recurrence, (b) surgical lymphadenectomy, (c) other imaging procedures or (d) FU lasting for at least 12 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the following variables: age, TNM staging, Gleason score, time from RP to the biochemical relapse, anti-androgen therapy at the time of (11)C-choline PET/CT scan, trigger PSA value and PSA kinetics, i.e. PSA doubling time (PSAdt) and PSA velocity (PSAvel), in order to assess the significant predictive factors related to the findings of a positive (11)C-choline PET/CT scan.  Results:   Overall, (11)C-choline PET/CT showed positive findings in 29 of 102 patients (28% of cases). In detail, (11)C-choline PET/CT detected: local relapse in 7 patients, bone metastases in 13 patients (4 single and 9 multiple) and lymph node metastases in 9 patients (6 single and 3 multiple). Positive PET findings were validated by: (a) TRUS-guided biopsy in 7 patients with local recurrence, (b) surgery and lymphadenectomy in 3 patients, (c) other targeted imaging procedures (MR or bone scan) in 5 patients and (d) clinical FU lasting a minimum of 12 months and including also a contrast-enhanced CT (CECT), an MR, a bone scan and a repeated (11)C-choline PET/CT in 14 patients. Age, time to biochemical relapse (TTR), initial T staging, Gleason score and trigger PSA were not statistically significant in predicting a positive (11)C-choline PET/CT scan both at univariate and multivariate analysis. Instead, PSA kinetics (PSAdt and PSAvel), N status and anti-androgenic therapy at the time of PET scan were statistically significant predictive factors at univariate analysis. Of note, only PSAdt and initial N status were found to be significant and independent predictive factors at multivariate analysis. The mean PSAdt in PET-positive patients was 4.34 months (SD 2.82) while in PET-negative patients it was 13.30 months (SD 9.75) (p = 0.0001). The optimal threshold for PSAdt established by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was 7.25 months (AUC 0.85; 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.91) providing 93% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 60% positive predictive value and 96% negative predictive value.  Conclusion:   In our study, (11)C-choline PET/CT was able to detect recurrent disease in 28% of the patients with mild biochemical relapse characterized by very low trigger PSA levels (PSA <1.5 ng/ml). Very interestingly (11)C-choline PET/CT detected distant unexpected metastases in 21% of the patients. At multivariate statistical analysis only PSAdt and node status were shown to be significant and independent predictive factors for positive (11)C-choline PET/CT. Therefore, (11)C-choline could be suggested to be performed early during initial biochemical relapse in patients presenting with fast PSA kinetics. The early detection of the site of recurrence could lead to a prompt instauration of the most appropriate treatment, i.e. local surgery or radiation treatment vs systemic treatment. In this view, one of the main advantages should be the avoidance of unnecessary local radiotherapy in those patients showing distant metastasis at (11)C-choline PET/CT.""","""['Paolo Castellucci', 'Chiara Fuccio', 'Domenico Rubello', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Ivan Santi', 'Cristina Nanni', 'Vincenzo Allegri', 'Gian Carlo Montini', 'Valentina Ambrosini', 'Stefano Boschi', 'Giuseppe Martorana', 'Maria Cristina Marzola', 'Stefano Fanti']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['The rising PET: the increasing use of choline PET/CT in prostate cancer.', 'Influence of trigger PSA and PSA kinetics on 11C-Choline PET/CT detection rate in patients with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy.', '(11)C-Choline PET/CT in patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer showing biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical utility of (18)F-fluorocholine positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after radical treatment: results of a multicentre study.', 'The role of choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of patients with prostate-specific antigen progression after radical treatment of prostate cancer.', 'PET/CT with (11)C-choline for evaluation of prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence: meta-analysis and critical review of available data.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of F-18-Fluorocholine PET/CT and multiparametric MRI for prostate cancer.', 'Detection Rate and Clinical Impact of PET/CT with 18F-FACBC in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Bicentric Study.', 'Localization and restaging of carcinoma prostate by 68Gallium prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography computed tomography in patients with biochemical recurrence.', 'Detection Rate of 18F-Fluorethylcholine-PET/CT in relation to PSA Value in PCA Patients Referred with Biochemical Relapse.', '18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for the Detection of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Consequently, it is important to identify markers that may facilitate this distinction. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a homeodomain containing transcription factor expressed selectively in the thyroid, lung, and diencephalon. TTF-1 is also expressed in adenocarcinomas of the lung and is widely used as a pulmonary adenocarcinoma marker in surgical specimens. However, the utility of TTF-1 has rarely been investigated in cytology. In this study, we evaluated the expression of TTF-1 in malignant pleural effusions. The primary tumors included 26 pulmonary adenocarcinomas, 26 non-pulmonary adenocarcinomas (13 breast, 5 ovarian, 2 gastric, 2 prostatic, 1 esophageal, 1 colonic, 1 pancreatic and 1 renal) and 4 malignant mesotheliomas. Immunocytochemistry was performed on sections of cell blocks, using a mouse monoclonal TTF-1 antibody (clone 8G7G3/1) and a biotin-streptavidin detection system. Nuclear immunoreactivity for TTF-1 was detected in 19 pulmonary adenocarcinomas. All non-pulmonary adenocarcinomas and malignant mesotheliomas were negative. These data indicate that TTF-1 maintains its sensitivity (73%) and specificity (100%) in cell block preparations and is useful in separating adenocarcinoma of the lung from non-pulmonary adenocarcinoma and malignant mesothelioma in cytology specimens.""","""['Andras Khoor', 'Angela L Byrd-Gloster', 'Santo V Nicosia']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Pathol Oncol Res""","""['Thyroid transcription factor-1 is highly sensitive and specific in differentiating metastatic pulmonary from extrapulmonary adenocarcinoma in effusion fluid cytology specimens.', 'Immunohistochemistry in the distinction between malignant mesothelioma and pulmonary adenocarcinoma: a critical evaluation of new antibodies.', 'Diagnostic utility of thyroid transcription factor-1 expression in adenocarcinomas presenting in serous fluids.', 'TTF-1 protein expression in pleural malignant mesotheliomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung.', 'Immunocytochemistry of effusion fluids: Introduction to SCIP approach.', 'Diagnostic value of thyroid transcription factor-1 for pleural or other serous metastases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma: a meta-analysis.', 'Nkx2-1: a novel tumor biomarker of lung cancer.']"""

The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) promotes the metabolism of glucose by aerobic glycolysis and contributes to anabolic metabolism. Paradoxically, decreased pyruvate kinase enzyme activity accompanies the expression of PKM2 in rapidly dividing cancer cells and tissues. We demonstrate that phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the substrate for pyruvate kinase in cells, can act as a phosphate donor in mammalian cells because PEP participates in the phosphorylation of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM1) in PKM2-expressing cells. We used mass spectrometry to show that the phosphate from PEP is transferred to the catalytic histidine (His11) on human PGAM1. This reaction occurred at physiological concentrations of PEP and produced pyruvate in the absence of PKM2 activity. The presence of histidine-phosphorylated PGAM1 correlated with the expression of PKM2 in cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. Thus, decreased pyruvate kinase activity in PKM2-expressing cells allows PEP-dependent histidine phosphorylation of PGAM1 and may provide an alternate glycolytic pathway that decouples adenosine triphosphate production from PEP-mediated phosphotransfer, allowing for the high rate of glycolysis to support the anabolic metabolism observed in many proliferating cells.""","""['Matthew G Vander Heiden', 'Jason W Locasale', 'Kenneth D Swanson', 'Hadar Sharfi', 'Greg J Heffron', 'Daniel Amador-Noguez', 'Heather R Christofk', 'Gerhard Wagner', 'Joshua D Rabinowitz', 'John M Asara', 'Lewis C Cantley']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Science""","""['Metabolism: Less is sometimes more.', 'Tyr26 phosphorylation of PGAM1 provides a metabolic advantage to tumours by stabilizing the active conformation.', 'Lack of Evidence for PKM2 Protein Kinase Activity.', 'Bisphosphoglycerate mutase controls serine pathway flux via 3-phosphoglycerate.', 'Pyruvate kinase: Function, regulation and role in cancer.', 'PKM2, cancer metabolism, and the road ahead.', 'Role of Glucose Metabolic Reprogramming in Breast Cancer Progression and Drug Resistance.', 'The potential role of T-cell metabolism-related molecules in chronic neuropathic pain after nerve injury: a narrative review.', 'ZFP36-mediated mRNA decay regulates metabolism.', 'Putrescine supplementation shifts macrophage L-arginine metabolism related-genes reducing Leishmania amazonensis infection.', 'The Role of Reprogrammed Glucose Metabolism in Cancer.']"""

However, little data is available on the precision of this image-guidance technique. This study quantified impact of different registration surrogates and patient factors on the interobserver variability of manual EPI alignment during prostate radiotherapy. For 50 prostate radiotherapy patients previously implanted with 3 IPM, five observers manually aligned 150 pairs of orthogonal EPI to the reference digital reconstructed radiograph using Varian Vision EPI analysis software. Images were aligned using: Bony anatomy (BA), single mid-prostate IPM (SM); and 2 strategies using 3 IPM: center of mass (COM) and rotate & translate (R&T). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to quantify interobserver variability. The absolute displacements measured using SM and R&T were compared with those using COM. The impact of patients' pelvic diameter and adjuvant hormone therapy on interobserver variability were also evaluated. Twelve thousand displacement values were collected for analysis. The maximum discrepancy between the 5 observers was >2 mm in 47% of measurements using BA, 5% using SM, 4% using R&T, and 3% using COM. Both of the 3 IPM alignment strategies demonstrated lower interobserver variability than the single IPM strategy (ICC 0.94-0.97 vs. 0.82-0.94). BA had the highest interobserver variability (ICC = 0.43-0.90). Pelvic diameter and hormone therapy had no discernible impact on interobserver variability. Compared with COM, the absolute displacements measured using the other IPM strategies were statistically different (p < 0.001), but 95% of the absolute magnitude of differences between the strategies were ≤1 mm. The high reproducibility among the observers demonstrated the precision of prostate localization using multiple IPM and EPI, which was not influenced by the patient factors studied. Bony anatomy displayed the highest interobserver variability of the 4 alignment, likely because of the limited EPI field-of-view. Alignment using more than one IPM is recommended to minimize interobserver variability.""","""['Vickie Kong', 'Gina Lockwood', 'Jing Yan', 'Charles Catton', 'Peter Chung', 'Andrew Bayley', 'Tara Rosewall']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Prostate position relative to pelvic bony anatomy based on intraprostatic gold markers and electronic portal imaging.', 'Application of the No Action Level (NAL) protocol to correct for prostate motion based on electronic portal imaging of implanted markers.', 'Initial experience with megavoltage (MV) CT guidance for daily prostate alignments.', 'Daily online localization using implanted fiducial markers and its impact on planning target volume for carcinoma prostate.', 'Electronic portal imaging vs kilovoltage imaging in fiducial marker image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer: an analysis of set-up uncertainties.', 'Quantification of interobserver variability in image registration using cone beam CT for partial bladder radiotherapy-a comparison between lipiodol and bladder wall surface.']"""

Methods:   From 2003 to 2009, 1234 men with data on prostate weight and total tumor volume underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon. Prostate size was classified into tertiles: small (≤ 41.2 g), medium (41.3-54.5 g), and large (≥ 54.6 g). Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationship of PSA with prostate size and tumor volume across different prostate sizes.  Results:   Median preoperative PSA was 4.9 ng/mL (standard deviation ± 4.6), mean prostate size was 51.7 g, and mean tumor volume was 5.6 cm(3). PSA had a significant correlation with prostate size only at a prostate weight ≥ 54.6 g (P = .02). Regardless of prostate size, PSA had a more robust significant correlation with tumor volume than with prostate size (all P < .0001).

We evaluated the relationship between high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on initial biopsy and the future presence of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   From December 1997 to February 2008 a total of 328 men underwent a second prostate biopsy after being initially diagnosed with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Men with prostate cancer or atypia on initial biopsy were excluded from study. Another 335 men without high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, prostate cancer or atypia underwent a second prostate biopsy based on clinical suspicion alone. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the effect of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on the subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer after adjustment for prostate specific antigen, age, presence of inflammation, abnormal digital rectal examination and number of cores obtained at biopsy. High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was also stratified into multifocal disease and laterality. Adjusted Kaplan-Meier plots were generated to estimate the rates of prostate cancer.  Results:   High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia alone on initial prostate biopsy had a significant effect on the subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer (HR 1.89; 95% CI 1.39, 2.55; p <0.0001).

Three taxometric procedures were used in analysis, including maximum covariance, mean above minus mean below a cut and latent mode. The comparison curve fit index was calculated for each procedure and the 3 results were averaged. A priori thresholds for the mean comparison curve fit index were that values greater than 0.55 were considered evidence of categorical structure and values less than 0.45 were considered evidence of dimensional structure. Values between 0.45 and 0.55 were deemed ambiguous.  Results:   Maximum covariance, mean above minus mean below a cut and latent mode analyses yielded a comparison curve fit index of 0.168, 0.401 and 0.465, respectively (mean 0.345).

Results:   Median time between atypical biopsy and repeat biopsy showing cancer was 6.1 months (range 0.7 to 94.8). An initial diagnosis of atypical glands suspicious but not diagnostic for carcinoma correlated significantly with nonpalpable disease, biopsy Gleason score 6 and lower tumor volume on needle cores. Compared to radical prostatectomy without prior atypical findings, radical prostatectomy cases with an initial atypical biopsy had a significantly lower Gleason score (p <0.0001) and pathological stage (p = 0.001), with 126 (74.5%) Gleason score 6 and 140 (83.0%) organ confined. Only 2 (1.2%) cases showed seminal vesicle involvement and none had lymph node metastases. In addition to known preoperative parameters (clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score), the presence of initial atypical biopsy was an independent predictor of organ confined disease at radical prostatectomy. However, when tumor volume on needle biopsy was included in the multivariate analysis a diagnosis of atypical glands suspicious but not diagnostic for carcinoma lost its independent predictive value.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer diagnosed on needle biopsy following a diagnosis of atypical glands suspicious but not diagnostic of carcinoma demonstrates a significantly lower tumor grade and pathological stage at radical prostatectomy than cancer without such a diagnosis. Correlating with lower tumor volume on biopsy, the presence of initial atypical biopsy predicts organ confined disease at radical prostatectomy.

However, DCA is based on expected utility theory, which has been routinely violated by decision makers. Decision-making is governed by intuition (system 1), and analytical, deliberative process (system 2), thus, rational decision-making should reflect both formal principles of rationality and intuition about good decisions. We use the cognitive emotion of regret to serve as a link between systems 1 and 2 and to reformulate DCA.  Methods:   First, we analysed a classic decision tree describing three decision alternatives: treat, do not treat, and treat or no treat based on a predictive model. We then computed the expected regret for each of these alternatives as the difference between the utility of the action taken and the utility of the action that, in retrospect, should have been taken. For any pair of strategies, we measure the difference in net expected regret. Finally, we employ the concept of acceptable regret to identify the circumstances under which a potentially wrong strategy is tolerable to a decision-maker.  Results:   We developed a novel dual visual analog scale to describe the relationship between regret associated with ""omissions"" (e.g. failure to treat) vs. ""commissions"" (e.g. treating unnecessary) and decision maker's preferences as expressed in terms of threshold probability. We then proved that the Net Expected Regret Difference, first presented in this paper, is equivalent to net benefits as described in the original DCA. Based on the concept of acceptable regret we identified the circumstances under which a decision maker tolerates a potentially wrong decision and expressed it in terms of probability of disease.  Conclusions:   We present a novel method for eliciting decision maker's preferences and an alternative derivation of DCA based on regret theory. Our approach may be intuitively more appealing to a decision-maker, particularly in those clinical situations when the best management option is the one associated with the least amount of regret (e.g. diagnosis and treatment of advanced cancer, etc).""","""['Athanasios Tsalatsanis', 'Iztok Hozo', 'Andrew Vickers', 'Benjamin Djulbegovic']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['Acceptable regret in medical decision making.', 'Defining optimum treatment of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma using regret-based decision curve analysis.', 'Reporting and Interpreting Decision Curve Analysis: A Guide for Investigators.', 'When is diagnostic testing inappropriate or irrational?

We recently illustrated by an in vitro kinase assay that a novel peptide to YB-1 was highly phosphorylated by the serine/threonine p90 S6 kinases RSK-1 and RSK-2, and to a lesser degree PKCα and AKT. Herein, we sought to develop this decoy cell permeable peptide (CPP) as a cancer therapeutic. This 9-mer was designed as an interference peptide that would prevent endogenous YB-1(S102) phosphorylation based on molecular docking. In cancer cells, the CPP blocked P-YB-1(S102) and down-regulated both HER-2 and EGFR transcript level and protein expression. Further, the CPP prevented YB-1 from binding to the EGFR promoter in a gel shift assay. Notably, the growth of breast (SUM149, MDA-MB-453, AU565) and prostate (PC3, LNCap) cancer cells was inhibited by ∼90% with the CPP. Further, treatment with this peptide enhanced sensitivity and overcame resistance to trastuzumab in cells expressing amplified HER-2. By contrast, the CPP had no inhibitory effect on the growth of normal immortalized breast epithelial (184htert) cells, primary breast epithelial cells, nor did it inhibit differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. These data collectively suggest that the CPP is a novel approach to suppressing the growth of cancer cells while sparing normal cells and thereby establishes a proof-of-concept that blocking YB-1 activation is a new course of cancer therapeutics.""","""['Jennifer H Law', 'Yvonne Li', 'Karen To', 'Michelle Wang', 'Arezoo Astanehe', 'Karen Lambie', 'Jaspreet Dhillon', 'Steven J M Jones', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Connie J Eaves', 'Sandra E Dunn']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Y-box binding protein-1 serine 102 is a downstream target of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase in basal-like breast cancer cells.', 'Luteolin is a novel p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) inhibitor that suppresses Notch4 signaling by blocking the activation of Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1).', 'Targeting p90 ribosomal S6 kinase eliminates tumor-initiating cells by inactivating Y-box binding protein-1 in triple-negative breast cancers.', 'Targeting the Y-box Binding Protein-1 Axis to Overcome Radiochemotherapy Resistance in Solid Tumors.', 'An update of the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in breast cancer: Gefitinib (Iressa) -induced changes in the expression and nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of HER-ligands (Review).', 'YB-1 activating cascades as potential targets in KRAS-mutated tumors.', 'Why Be One Protein When You Can Affect Many?

We screened rodents and other mammals for sequence variation in the Xpr1 receptor for the mouse xenotropic or polytropic mouse leukemia viruses (X-MLVs or P-MLVs, respectively) of the gammaretrovirus family and for susceptibility to mouse-derived X/P-MLVs and to XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus), an X-MLV-like virus isolated from humans with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. We identified multiple distinct susceptibility phenotypes; these include the four known Xpr1 variants in Mus and a novel fifth Xpr1 gene found in Mus molossinus and Mus musculus. We describe the geographic and species distribution of the Mus Xpr1 variants but failed to find the X-MLV-restrictive laboratory mouse allele in any wild mouse. We used mutagenesis and phylogenetic analysis to evaluate the functional contributions made by constrained, variable, and deleted residues. Rodent Xpr1 is under positive selection, indicating a history of host-pathogen conflicts; several codons under selection have known roles in virus entry. All non-Mus mammals are susceptible to mouse X-MLVs, but some restrict other members of the X/P-MLV family, and the resistance of hamster and gerbil cells to XMRV indicates that XMRV has unique receptor requirements. We show that the hypervariable fourth extracellular XPR1 loop (ECL4) contains three evolutionarily constrained residues that do not contribute to receptor function, we identify two novel residues important for virus entry (I579 and T583), and we describe a unique pattern of ECL4 variation in the three virus-restrictive Xpr1 variants found in MLV-infected house mice; these mice carry different deletions in ECL4, suggesting either that these sites or loop size affects receptor function.""","""['Yuhe Yan', 'Qingping Liu', 'Kurt Wollenberg', 'Carrie Martin', 'Alicia Buckler-White', 'Christine A Kozak']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['Wild mouse variants of envelope genes of xenotropic/polytropic mouse gammaretroviruses and their XPR1 receptors elucidate receptor determinants of virus entry.', 'The mouse ""xenotropic"" gammaretroviruses and their XPR1 receptor.', 'Endogenous gammaretrovirus acquisition in Mus musculus subspecies carrying functional variants of the XPR1 virus receptor.', 'Permissive XPR1 gammaretrovirus receptors in four mammalian species are functionally distinct in interference tests.', 'Evolution of different antiviral strategies in wild mouse populations exposed to different gammaretroviruses.', 'Unique Structure and Distinctive Properties of the Ancient and Ubiquitous Gamma-Type Envelope Glycoprotein.', 'Patterns of Coevolutionary Adaptations across Time and Space in Mouse Gammaretroviruses and Three Restrictive Host Factors.', 'Retroviral Restriction Factors and Their Viral Targets: Restriction Strategies and Evolutionary Adaptations.', 'Characterization of a new case of XMLV (Bxv1) contamination in the human cell line Hep2 (clone 2B).', 'Xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 regulates procoagulant platelet polyphosphate.']"""

Design:   Case-control study with 1:3 matching nested within a highly representative population based cohort study.  Setting:   General population of Sweden taking part in the Malmo Preventive Project. Cancer registry at the National Board of Health and Welfare.  Participants:   1167 men aged 60 who provided blood samples in 1981 and were followed up to age 85.  Main outcome measures:   Metastasis or death from prostate cancer.  Results:   The rate of screening during the course of the study was low. There were 43 cases of metastasis and 35 deaths from prostate cancer. Concentration of prostate specific antigen at age 60 was associated with prostate cancer metastasis (area under the curve 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.92; P<0.001) and death from prostate cancer (0.90, 0.84 to 0.96; P<0.001). The greater the number for the area under the curve (values from 0 to 1) the better the test. Although only a minority of the men with concentrations in the top quarter (>2 ng/ml) develop fatal prostate cancer, 90% (78% to 100%) of deaths from prostate cancer occurred in these men. Conversely, men aged 60 with concentrations at the median or lower (≤1 ng/ml) were unlikely to have clinically relevant prostate cancer (0.5% risk of metastasis by age 85 and 0.2% risk of death from prostate cancer).  Conclusions:   The concentration of prostate specific antigen at age 60 predicts lifetime risk of metastasis and death from prostate cancer. Though men aged 60 with concentrations below the median (≤1 ng/ml) might harbour prostate cancer, it is unlikely to become life threatening.

We compared the chronic disease care in cancer survivors and their matched controls.  Results:   The proportion of patients meeting quality standards for chronic disease care was high in both cancer survivors and control patients. Although cancer survivors were slightly less likely to receive blood pressure monitoring and cholesterol tests, this difference was no longer apparent if patients who died during the study period were excluded. For instance, 93% of breast cancer survivors received blood pressure monitoring compared with 94% of matched control patients. Similarly, control of disease was comparable among all patients, with the exception of diabetic prostate cancer survivors, who had fewer cholesterol readings under the control limit (17% reduction, 95% CI, 7%-26%) and diabetic colorectal survivors, who had fewer calendar quarters of glycated hemoglobin control (12% reduction, 95% CI, 2%-23%).

Methods and materials:   Four weeks after (125)I permanent prostate seed implant, CT scans were performed on the whole pelvis of patients using our standard protocol for prostate planning. The acquired CT data sets were reconstructed using different sizes of field of view (FOV).

Results:   The dose matrix resulted from the postimplant dosimetry was exported from Variseed in standard DICOM format and imported into Eclipse TPS. The brachytherapy dose matrix was registered with the patient images with full FOV in Eclipse TPS. Targets for dose boost were defined based on the isodose curves generated from brachytherapy. An external photon beam plan was successfully generated to deliver dose for selected underdose regions.

The second neoplasia was antecedent in 115 patients (average latency period 8.5 years), synchronous in 97 patients, and subsequent in 103 patients (average latency period 4.4 years). The sites of associated neoplasia were, in descending order of frequency, prostate, bladder, and bowel for men and breast, gynecologic organs, thyroid, and bladder for women. Compared with the patients not affected by a second neoplasm, those with multiple malignancies generally were older and had a smaller, low-grade, low-stage, and asymptomatic renal tumor. Comparing patients with associated neoplasia with a group without associated neoplasia matched for gender, mode of diagnosis, dimension, grade, stage, and histologic subtype of renal cancer, at survival analysis, no significant differences were noticed in renal cancer-related survival. However, among patients with multiple malignancies, the contemporaneous diagnosis of renal and associated cancer had an independent negative impact on survival.  Conclusions:   The association between renal cancer and other malignancies is a frequent event with an unremarkable impact on prognosis, and it shall not limit surgical indication to treat renal cancer, even if the negative prognostic impact of synchronous occurrence of multiple neoplasias should be regarded, especially in older or unhealthy patients, since ablative therapies or active surveillance could be considered as viable alternative options.""","""['Alessandro Antonelli', 'Stefano Calza', 'Nicola Arrighi', 'Danilo Zani', 'Serena Corti', 'Alberto Cozzoli', 'Tiziano Zanotelli', 'Sergio Cosciani Cunico', 'Claudio Simeone']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Multiple primary malignancies in patients with renal cell carcinoma: a national population-based cohort study.', 'De novo renal cell carcinoma of native kidney in renal transplant recipients.', 'Multiple primary malignancies in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Metastatic tumors to the nail unit: subungual metastases.', 'Second primary renal cell carcinomas following solid tumors.

These rare cells are supposed to be highly tumorigenic and to be involved in maintenance of tumor homeostasis and mediation of tumor metastasis. Methods for sorting PrCSCs are mainly based on sorting cells with the marker (CD133(+)/CD44(+)) or side population cells. However, CD133(+)/CD44(+) cells or side population cells are very rare or even undetectable. The scarcity of approaches for isolation and purification of PrCSCs is the main obstacle to studying PrCSCs.  Methods:   In the present study, suspension culture was used for enrichment of PrCSCs. And PrCSCs were verified by side population technology, drug sensitivity assays, and the molecular marker analysis of prostate cancer stem cell.  Results:   PC3 cells survived and formed spheres in nonadherent suspension culture. The percentage of CD44(+)/CD133(+) cells was 18-fold higher in the nonadherent sphere-forming cell population than in the adherent PC3 cell population (13.94% vs. 0.77%, respectively). This side population was increased to 3.1% in the nonadherent population but undetectable in adherent population. Resistance to cisplatin was higher in the nonadherent cells than adherent cells.  Conclusion:   Suspension culture can be used to enrich for PrCSCs.

Another aim was examination of relation of MER by bicolor FISH with expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C).  Methods:   The bicolor FISH technique used cyanin 5 (cy5)-labeled MMP-2 and -9 probes, and a cyanin 3 (cy3)-labeled ECD probe on needle biopsy specimens from 67 prostate cancer cases. The ISH was followed by computerized detection of the signal intensities and cy5-to-cy3 ratios using a fluorescence detector. VEGF-C expression was examined using cy5-labeled VEGF-C by computerized detection.  Results:   The bicolor FISH-based MER was well correlated with CISH-based MER (P < 0.0001). The bicolor FISH-based MER correlated with Gleason score and pathologic stage of the cases. VEGF-C mRNA expression was associated with the pathologic stage and maximum lymph vessel density (LVD). The LVD was associated with VEGF-C expression at the tumor area where the maximum MER was detected (P < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   The MER was correlated with the VEGF-C expression and LVD, indicating lymph node metastasis of prostate cancer.

The initiator-conjugated polyclone PSA antibodies (Ab2*), prepared by coupling of N-hydroxysuccinmidyl bromoisobutyrate (initiator) with polyclone PSA antibodies (Ab2), were immobilized on the substrate surface through sandwiched immunoreactions to trigger polymerization. AGET ATRP is used for local accumulation of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) monomers. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was chosen as signal species for its well-characterized chemiluminescent and electrochemical behavior, strong enzyme activity, good solubility and ease in coupling. Growth of long chain polymeric materials provided excess epoxy groups for HRP coupling, which in turn significantly increased the loading of signal molecules and enhanced the chemiluminescent and electrochemical readouts. With the proposed strategy, a detection limit of 4.0 and 1.3 pg mL(-1) was obtained for flow injection chemiluminescent and electrocatalytic measurements, respectively. A more than 13- and 14-fold enhancement in the chemiluminescent intensity and electrocatalytic current was achieved comparing to the traditional sandwiched immunoassays using HRP-conjugated antibody directly.

SES category may thus point to differential effects of lifestyle changes but early detection may also affect this.  Patients and methods:   We studied patients diagnosed in 1996-2008 and registered in the South Netherlands Cancer registry. Incidence rates and estimated annual percentage changes were calculated according to SES category, age group (25-44, 45-64 and > or =65) and sex.  Results:   People with a low SES exhibited elevated incidence rates of cancer of the head and neck, upper airways (both sexes), gastro-intestinal tract, squamous cell skin cancer, breast (> or =65) and all female genital, bladder, kidney and mature B-cells (all in females only), whereas prostate cancer, basal cell skin cancer (BCC) and melanoma (both except in older females) were most common among those with a high SES. Due to the greater increase in prostate cancer and melanoma in high SES males and the larger reduction of lung cancer in low SES males, incidence of all cancers combined became more elevated among males of > or =45 years with a high and intermediate SES, and approached rates for low SES men aged 45-64. In spite of more marked increases in the incidence of colon, rectal and lung cancer in high SES women, the incidence of all cancers combined remained highest for low SES women of > or =45 years. However, at age 25-44 years, the highest incidence of cancer of the breast and melanoma was observed among high SES females. During 1996-2008 inequalities increased unfavourably among higher SES people for prostate cancer, BCC (except in older women) and melanoma (at middle age), while decreasing favourably among low SES people for cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, pancreas and kidney (both in females only), breast (> or =65 years), corpus uteri and ovary.  Conclusions:   Although those with a low SES exhibited the highest incidence rates of the most common cancers, higher risks were observed among those with high SES for melanoma and BCC (both except older females) and for prostate and breast (young females) cancer. Altogether this might also have contributed to the recent higher cancer awareness in Dutch society which is usually promoted more by patients of high SES and those who know or surround them.""","""['M J Aarts', 'M A van der Aa', 'J W W Coebergh', 'W J Louwman']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Increase in basal cell carcinoma incidence steepest in individuals with high socioeconomic status: results of a cancer registry study in The Netherlands.', 'Trends in the incidence and death from cancer from 1989-2003 in The Netherlands.', 'Trends in the incidence and prevalence of cancer and in the survival of patients in southeastern Netherlands, 1970-1999.', 'Trends in cancer incidence and cancer mortality in Netherlands: good and bad news.', 'Social inequalities in cancer with special reference to South Asian countries.', ""Do patients' preferences prevail in hospital selection?: a comparison between discrete choice experiments and revealed hospital choice."", 'Incidence trends for twelve cancers in younger adults-a rapid review.', 'Concurrent versus sequential use of trastuzumab and chemotherapy in early HER2+ breast cancer.', 'On selecting quality indicators: preferences of patients with breast and colon cancers regarding hospital quality indicators.', 'Physician And Patient Barriers To Radiotherapy Service Access: Treatment Referral Implications.']"""

Methods:   We generalize previously derived TCP formulas of Zaider and Minerbo and of Dawson and Hillen to derive a TCP formula from our cell population model. We then use six prostate cancer treatment protocols as a case study to show how our TCP formula works and how the cell cycle affects the tumor treatment.  Results:   The TCP formulas of Zaider-Minerbo and of Dawson-Hillen are special cases of the TCP formula presented here. The former one represents the case with no quiescent cells while the latter one assumes that all newly born cells enter a quiescent cell phase before becoming active. From our case study, we observe that inclusion of the cell cycle lowers the TCP.  Conclusion:   The cell cycle can be understood as the sequestration of cells in the quiescent compartment, where they are less sensitive to radiation.

It is asymptomatic disease in its early period and if the person does not have an enlarged prostate it will be overlooked without screening. Consequently, the only way to diagnose prostate cancer in its early period is to determine the serum PSA (prostate-specific antigen) level of men aged 40+ and to do a digital rectal examination (DRE).  Objective:   The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of prostate cancer among men aged 40+, to mention the significance of DRE and PSA by means of a training to be done with the aid of a booklet about early diagnosis, and to encourage men to consult a doctor and get the right treatment at the right time.  Methods:   The research was a descriptive field study. carried out among 660 men aged 40+ out of 3,285 men who live in Osman Gazi Health Care District, connected with the Presidency of Training and Research Health Group of Bornova.

Results:   Increase in the serum PSA level (4 ng/mL<) was determined in 10 men. Nodules were detected in 3 men together with the increase in PSA. One further nodule was detected only in DRE one examination of 12 participants. In the light of these data, it was decided to conduct a biopsy on 25 people, who had an increase in PSE and/or whose abnormalities were detected during DRE, in company with TRUS, and prostate cancer was detected in the biopsies of 5 people (1.89%).

However, there was a significant link with the null alleles of the GSTM1 (p=0.000, OR=2.24, 95%CI=1.46-3.42) gene. The combined analysis of the three genotypes demonstrated further increase in the risk of symptomatic BPH (p= 0.009, OR= 8.31 95%CI=1.71-40.37). Polymorphisms of GST genes were not associated with responders or non-responders.

Using the DU145 human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, we show that silencing of mutant p53 gene by RNA interference led to significant inhibition of cell viability and growth, which was associated with cell cycle arrest at G1 and G2/M phase, and ultimately induced massive apoptosis. Mechanistically, p53-siRNA inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, which might be responsible for the reduced proliferation and apoptosis induction.

Results:   Docetaxel clearance was increased by approximately 100% in castrated men and was associated with a two-fold reduction in area under the curve (P = .0001), although hepatic activity of CYP3A4 was unchanged (P = .26). In rats, castration was associated with higher uptake of docetaxel in the liver and a concurrent increase in the expression of rOat2 (Slc22a7), an organic anion transporter that regulates, in part, the transfer of docetaxel from the circulation into hepatocytes.

Methods:   A total of 6,112 adults ages 50 years and above without a history of cancer at baseline in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994) were included in the analysis. Albuminuria was measured with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in mg/mmol. Cancer mortality was obtained from the NHANES III-linked follow-up database (up to December 31, 2006). Cox-regression models were used to examine the associations of interest.  Results:   Albuminuria was present in 705 men (17.5%) and 592 women (14.3%). During an average follow-up of 149 months, 613 subjects died of cancers including 184 lung cancers, 65 colorectal cancers, 55 prostate cancers, and 309 other cancers. There was an increased mortality risk associated with logarithmically transformed UACR for all-cancer [relative risk (RR), 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.36], lung cancer (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43), and prostate cancer mortality (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.01-1.95) in men. No associations between UACR and cancer were apparent in women.  Conclusions:   The analysis shows that albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of cancer death, specifically for all-cause, lung, and prostate cancers in men ages 50 and above.  Impact:   Further studies are needed to explore the relationship between albuminuria and specific cancers.

Skeletal involvement is commonly an aggressive, lytic process which causes substantial morbidity through skeletal complications and occurrence of skeletal related events (SREs). However, compared with bone metastases in breast and prostate cancer, there is a paucity of data relating to the demographics of bone metastases in RCC and their sequelae in terms of SREs and survival. The study population included all patients (N=803) with advanced or metastatic RCC treated in a tertiary centre serving a regional population of 2.6 million between 1998 and 2007. Demographic and survival data and information relating to metastatic disease were extracted from electronic records. Thirty-two percent (N=254) of the study population presented with (N=131) or later developed (N=123) bone metastases and 83% of these (N=210) also developed metastases elsewhere. The mean number of SREs experienced by the bone metastatic patients over the course of their disease was 2.4 and only 37 patients experienced no SRE. A high proportion of patients (80%) received radiotherapy for bone pain and there was a surprising and strikingly high incidence of spinal cord/nerve root compression, which was experienced by 28% patients. Although bisphosphonate use increased following the availability of zoledronic acid in 2004, approximately 50% patients with bone metastases did not receive bisphosphonate treatment. The skeletal morbidity rate (number of SREs per patient years at risk) was 1.0 and 1.4 for patients who received or did not receive bisphosphonates, respectively. The median survival following diagnosis of RCC was similar in patients who developed bone metastases (20.4 months) and those who did not (20.9 months). Median survival from diagnosis of metastases was 13.3 months for those who never developed bone metastases, 10.6 months for those who presented with them, 19.6 months for those who developed them later and 22.6 months for patients who had bone only metastases. This is the largest study to date focusing specifically on skeletal complications in RCC. A striking finding was the high incidence of spinal cord/nerve root compression and more research into this area is needed.

Here, we show by Western blotting and electromobility shift assay that Stat5a/b protein in human prostate cancer is N-terminally truncated. This short form of Stat5a/b is generated post-translationally in vivo in prostate cancer cells and is the predominant form of Stat5a/b that binds to DNA. We further demonstrate by mutagenesis and co-immunoprecipitations that the N-domain of Stat5a/b is required for binding to PIAS3, and that PIAS3 inhibits transcriptional activity of Stat5a/b in breast cancer cells but not in prostate cancer cells. Thus, the proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminus of Stat5a/b may be a mechanism by which Stat5 evades the transcriptional repression by PIAS3 in prostate cancer cells, and results in increased Stat5-driven gene expression and prostate cancer progression.""","""['Ayush Dagvadorj', 'Shyh-Han Tan', 'Zhiyong Liao', 'Jianwu Xie', 'Martti Nurmi', 'Kalle Alanen', 'Hallgeir Rui', 'Tuomas Mirtti', 'Marja T Nevalainen']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 promotes growth of human prostate cancer cells in vivo.', 'Pharmacologic inhibition of Jak2-Stat5 signaling By Jak2 inhibitor AZD1480 potently suppresses growth of both primary and castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Structure-Based Screen Identifies a Potent Small Molecule Inhibitor of Stat5a/b with Therapeutic Potential for Prostate Cancer and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a/b: biomarker and therapeutic target in prostate and breast cancer.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A/B in prostate and breast cancers.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Targeting the SUMO Pathway in Cancer.', 'JAK/STAT pathway and molecular mechanism in bone remodeling.', 'A Hierarchical Machine Learning Model to Discover Gleason Grade-Specific Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting Oncogenic Transcription Factors: Therapeutic Implications of Endogenous STAT Inhibitors.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.']"""

We investigated the hypothesis that the tissue expression of three cell cycle markers, Rb, p21 and p16, would provide helpful prognostic information in a well characterised series of prostate cancers which were clinically localised and treated conservatively.  Methods:   The immunohistochemical staining expression of these markers was assessed in tissue microarrays and correlated with 10 year prostate cancer survival and overall survival and then compared with pathological data including contemporary Gleason score, age, measures of tumour extent and initial serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level.  Results:   Rb overexpression did not show any significant association with Gleason score or prostate cancer survival. p21 protein expression showed a significant association with prostate cancer survival (p = 0.02) and overall survival (p = 0.01) in a univariate model but not in a multivariate model with pathological and serum PSA data.

DNA from peripheral blood of 172 patients and 172 controls were analyzed by RFLP-PCR method. The polymorphisms were also evaluated in relation to clinical and pathological parameters.

Deprivation of intracellular amino acids or block of amino acid uptake has been shown to be cytotoxic to many established human cancer cell lines in vitro and in human cancer xenograft models.  Results:   In this paper, we provide evidence that the two small molecule oxyphenisatine analogs TOP001 and TOP216 exert their anti-cancer effect by affecting tumor cell metabolism and inducing intracellular amino acid deprivation, leading to a block of cell proliferation. GCN2-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α as well as mTOR pathway inhibition supports the above notion. In addition, these novel anti-cancer compounds inhibit DNA and protein synthesis and induce apoptosis in a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines. In vivo, the compounds induce tumor stasis and regression in mouse xenograft models of human breast, prostate, ovarian and pancreatic cancer, both when administered intravenously and orally.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, these small molecules, built on a 1,3-dihydroindole-2-one scaffold, elicit strong anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activity, and importantly, a strong anti-tumorigenicity is observed in in vivo xenograft models of human breast, ovary, prostate and pancreatic cancers encouraging the translation of this class of compounds into the clinic.""","""['Christina Trojel-Hansen', 'Kamille Dumong Erichsen', 'Mette Knak Christensen', 'Peter Buhl Jensen', 'Maxwell Sehested', 'Søren Jensby Nielsen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Voreloxin, formerly SNS-595, has potent activity against a broad panel of cancer cell lines and in vivo tumor models.', ""2-Arylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid amides (ATCAA) target dual pathways in cancer cells: 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways."", 'Benzethonium chloride: a novel anticancer agent identified by using a cell-based small-molecule screen.', 'Nutrient transporters in cancer: relevance to Warburg hypothesis and beyond.', 'Amino Acid transporters in cancer and their relevance to ""glutamine addiction"": novel targets for the design of a new class of anticancer drugs.', 'Necrocide 1 mediates necrotic cell death and immunogenic response in human cancer cells.', 'Evolution of 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)indoline-2-one as a scaffold for potent and selective anticancer activity.', 'Oxyphenisatin acetate (NSC 59687) triggers a cell starvation response leading to autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autocrine TNFα-mediated apoptosis.', '18FFLT PET for non-invasive assessment of tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy: studies with experimental chemotherapy TP202377 in human cancer xenografts in mice.']"""

Anticarcinogenic effects of selenium are supposedly mediated through cellular protective and redox properties of selenoenzymes in vivo. We evaluated the association between serum selenium status and prostate cancer risk in a population with relative low selenium concentrations considering effect modification by genetic variants in selenoprotein genes.  Materials and methods:   A case-control study of 248 incident prostate cancer cases and 492 matched controls was nested within the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort. Baseline blood samples were analyzed for serum selenium and selenoprotein P concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activity. Genotyping was carried out for SEP15 (rs5859, rs540049), SEPP1 (rs3877899, rs7579), GPX1 (rs1050450), and GPX4 (rs713041). Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).  Results:   The OR for prostate cancer was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79-1.01) per 10 μg/L increase of serum selenium concentration.

Materials and methods:   A total of 130 patients with prostate cancer detected by extended pattern prostate biopsy underwent magnetic resonance imaging before radical prostatectomy. Tumor laterality on extended prostate biopsy was compared with the corresponding lobe on the radical prostatectomy specimen. In patients with unilateral prostate cancer on biopsy we calculated the probability of a tumor in the contralateral lobe on magnetic resonance images and calculated area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of combined T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images to that of T2-weighted magnetic resonance images alone.  Results:   Of the 130 patients 88 (67.7%) had unilateral disease on extended prostate biopsy. Radical prostatectomy pathology showed that 19% of these patients had unilateral disease but 81% had bilateral disease. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of combined diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was greater than that of T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging alone (0.814, 95% CI 0.716-0.889 vs 0.510, 95% CI 0.401-0.618). T2-weighted plus diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging had significantly higher sensitivity (84.1% vs 61.9%, p = 0.003) and specificity (72.0% vs 36.0%, p = 0.004) to predict cancer in the contralateral lobe than T2-weighted magnetic resonance alone.

Methods:   Among 332 individuals referred to 5 clinical centers in Europe because of development of jawbone abnormalities after or during exposure to bisphosphonates, we identified a total of 96 patients who presented with the nonexposed variant of osteonecrosis. Relevant data were obtained via clinical notes; radiological investigations; patients' history, and referral letters.  Results:   The most common clinical feature of nonexposed osteonecrosis was jaw bone pain (88/96; 91.6%); followed by sinus tract (51%), bone enlargement (36.4%); and gingival swelling (17.7%).

We evaluated the mechanisms of cardiac glycosides, including digoxin, digitoxin and ouabain (Sigma®), on prostate specific antigen gene expression in vitro.  Materials and methods:   We cultured LNCaP cells (ATCC®) and used them to determine the effect of cardiac glycosides on prostate derived Ets factor and prostate specific antigen expression. We determined prostate derived Ets factor and prostate specific antigen expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, transient gene expression assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  Results:   Noncytotoxic doses (100 nM) of cardiac glycosides for 24 hours inhibited prostate specific antigen secretion by LNCaP cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot revealed that cardiac glycosides significantly down-regulated prostate specific antigen and prostate derived Ets factor expression. Transient gene expression assays showed that prostate derived Ets factor over expression enhanced prostate specific antigen promoter activity. However, prostate specific antigen and prostate derived Ets factor gene promoter activity was attenuated when LNCaP cells were treated with 100 nM cardiac glycosides. When LNCaP cells were treated with 25 nM digitoxin or digoxin for 60 hours, prostate specific antigen secretion decreased by 30%.  Conclusions:   Results suggest that cardiac glycoside inhibition of prostate specific antigen gene expression may be caused by the down-regulation of prostate derived Ets factor gene expression. When cells were chronically treated with digoxin or digitoxin at concentrations close to or at therapeutic plasma levels, prostate specific antigen secretion decreased.

Materials and methods:   The study included 55 patients treated for prostate cancer only with androgen deprivation therapy and in whom tissue was available before treatment induction and after recurrence. Immunohistochemistry was performed using tissue microarray with antibodies directed against androgen receptor, phosphorylated androgen receptor, estrogen receptor α, estrogen receptor β, 5α-reductase 1 and 2, aromatase, BCAR1 and the proliferation marker Ki67.  Results:   Compared to hormone sensitive samples, tissues collected after hormonal relapse were characterized by increased expression of Ki67, androgen receptor, phosphorylated androgen receptor (p <0.001) and BCAR (p = 0.03), and by lower staining for 5α-reductase 2 (p = 0.002), estrogen receptor β (p = 0.016) and aromatase (p <0.001). Shorter time to hormonal relapse was associated with high expression of aromatase and BCAR1 on diagnostic biopsy, together with low staining for estrogen receptor α in stromal cells. Overall survival was significantly shorter when tissues collected after relapse showed a high proliferation index and low estrogen receptor α expression.

We determined 1) predictors of satisfaction between 3 months and 2 years after open radical retropubic prostatectomy, and 2) whether these factors are time dependent.  Materials and methods:   This prospective cohort study included 1,542 men who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy from October 2000 to July 2008. The primary outcome was satisfaction self-assessed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. We used multivariate logistic regression and repeated measures analysis to determine predictors of satisfaction, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics.  Results:   Median followup was 24 months. About 93% of the men were satisfied. On multivariate analysis men were significantly less satisfied at 3 months when the urinary catheter was indwelling for 3 weeks or greater (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.54), or they required intervention for anastomotic stricture (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11-0.49) or experienced 4-point or greater worsening in American Urological Association symptom score (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.49). At 6 months worsening urinary function (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.88) and biochemical failure (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.05-0.43) were significantly associated with satisfaction. Worsening sexual function became significant at 12 and 24 months. These associations were confirmed on repeated measures analysis.  Conclusions:   Most men were satisfied after radical retropubic prostatectomy. Satisfaction determinants showed a nonsignificant trend toward time dependence. Postoperative factors, such as the duration of indwelling Foley catheterization, were associated with short-term satisfaction while sexual and urinary function, and biochemical failure were associated with long-term satisfaction.

Cell specific phenotypes can be induced in normal cells by the transfer of material in microvesicles, leading to genetic changes. We report the identification and expression of prostate specific genes in normal human marrow cells co-cultured with human prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   We harvested prostate tissue from 11 patients with prostate cancer. In 4 cases prostate tissue was co-cultured across from human marrow for 2 or 7 days but separated from it by a 0.4 μM polystyrene membrane. In 5 cases conditioned medium from patient cancer tissue was collected and ultracentrifuged, and microvesicles were collected for co-culture (3) and vesicle characterization (3). Explanted human marrow was harvested from cultures and RNA extracted. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was done for select prostate specific genes.  Results:   Marrow exposed to human prostate tumor or isolated microvesicles in culture in 4 and 3 cases, respectively, showed at least 2-fold or greater prostate gene expression than control marrow. In 1 case in which normal prostate was co-cultured there were no prostate gene increases in normal marrow.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer tumor cells co-cultured with human bone marrow cells induce prostate specific gene expression.

In proteomics research, a number of methods can be used to obtain systemic information on protein and pathway level on cells and tissues. One fundamental tool in analysing protein expression has been two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). Several cancer 2DE studies have reported partially redundant lists of differently expressed proteins. To be able to further extract valuable information from existing 2DE data, the power of a multivariate meta-analysis will be evaluated in this work.  Results:   We here demonstrate a multivariate meta-analysis of 2DE proteomics data from human prostate and colon tumours. We developed a bioinformatic workflow for identifying common patterns over two tumour types. This included dealing with pre-processing of data and handling of missing values followed by the development of a multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) model for prediction and variable selection. The variable selection was based on the variables performance in the PLS model in combination with stability in the validation. The PLS model development and variable selection was rigorously evaluated using a double cross-validation scheme. The most stable variables from a bootstrap validation gave a mean prediction success of 93% when predicting left out test sets on models discriminating between normal and tumour tissue, common for the two tumour types. The analysis conducted in this study identified 14 proteins with a common trend between the tumour types prostate and colon, i.e. the same expression profile between normal and tumour samples.  Conclusions:   The workflow for meta-analysis developed in this study enabled the finding of a common protein profile for two malign tumour types, which was not possible to identify when analysing the data sets separately.""","""['Lina Hultin Rosenberg', 'Bo Franzén', 'Gert Auer', 'Janne Lehtiö', 'Jenny Forshed']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Possibilities and limitations of 2DE-based analyses for identifying low-abundant tumor markers in human serum and plasma.', 'A proteomic profile of washing fluid from the colorectal tract to search for potential biomarkers of colon cancer.', 'Comparative proteomic analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma and adjacent non-tumour tissue from Thailand.', 'Treatment of missing values for multivariate statistical analysis of gel-based proteomics data.', ""A Method for Increasing the Robustness of Stable Feature Selection for Biomarker Discovery in Molecular Medicine Developed Using Serum Small Extracellular Vesicle Associated miRNAs and the Barrett's Oesophagus Disease Spectrum."", 'Meta-analysis of clinical metabolic profiling studies in cancer: challenges and opportunities.', 'Urinary Volatile Organic Compounds for the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'A survey of computational tools for downstream analysis of proteomic and other omic datasets.', 'Two of Them Do It Better: Novel Serum Biomarkers Improve Autoimmune Hepatitis Diagnosis.']"""

To address this need, an effective and relevant in vitro model for the study of prostate cancer bone metastases would be useful. Therefore, a 3D in vitro tissue system was established using prostate cancer cells (PC3), suitable culture conditions and a 3D silk scaffold biomaterial to provide mechanically robust and slow degrading matrices to support the tissues for extended time frames. The role of BMP-2 on the progression of prostate cancer was investigated using this 3D tissue system. The results suggest that BMP-2 stimulates the migration of PC3 cells, suggesting insight into mechanisms involved in this critical step in the disease. The data support the conclusion that this in vitro system mimics aspects of prostate cancer metastasis in the presence of BMP-2, thus the system can be utilized as a starting point as an in vitro model for further studies of prostate cancer development and metastasis, as well as in the screening of new therapeutic treatments.""","""['Heenam Kwon', 'Hyeon Joo Kim', 'William L Rice', 'Balajikarthick Subramanian', 'Sang-Hyug Park', 'Irene Georgakoudi', 'David L Kaplan']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Tissue Eng Regen Med""","""['Influence of BMPs on the formation of osteoblastic lesions in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The use of collagen-based scaffolds to simulate prostate cancer bone metastases with potential for evaluating delivery of nanoparticulate gene therapeutics.', 'Overexpression of noggin inhibits BMP-mediated growth of osteolytic prostate cancer lesions.', 'The effect of bone morphogenetic protein-2 on osteosarcoma metastasis.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins and their receptor signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Cutaneous Regeneration Mechanism of β-Sheet Silk Fibroin in a Rat Burn Wound Healing Model.', 'Nanostructured Biomaterials for In Vitro Models of Bone Metastasis Cancer.', 'Modeling the Human Bone-Tumor Niche: Reducing and Replacing the Need for Animal Data.', 'High Levels of BMP2 Promote Liver Cancer Growth via the Activation of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells.', 'Prostate Cancer Phenotype Influences Bone Mineralization at Metastasis: A Study Using an In Vitro Prostate Cancer Metastasis Testbed.']"""

In this study, cDNA microarrays were performed using a microarray chip from Affymetrix to characterize and compare gene expression profiles in LNCaP and C4-2, which may provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism mediating prostate cancer progression. Three hundred eighteen genes consistently exhibited differential expression in LNCaP and C4-2 in 2-time microarray data. Based on their function, the differentially expressed genes can be grouped into several subcategories, including growth factors and signal transducers, oncogenes and tumor suppressors, tumor-specific antigens, transcriptional factors, transporters, and factors involved in invasion, metastasis, and metabolism. Some genes are novel and unexplored in prostate cancer progression and are of potential interest for follow-up investigation. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR were performed to corroborate the microarray results, and 76 differentially expressed genes were validated out of 104 candidates. Expression pattern analyses were performed in these 76 differentially expressed genes, and a series of genes was found to be positively or negatively correlated to prostate cancer progression in the LNCaP prostate cancer progression model and to possess predominant prostate cell specificity. ELF5/ESE-2b and long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (ACADL) expressions were found to be positively associated with malignant progression in LNCaP, C4-2, and C4-2B, and predominantly expressed in prostate cancer cells. Functional evaluation revealed that ELF5/ESE-2b and ACADL expressions contributed to the malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells. Accordingly, our microarray data may provide clues for finding novel genes involved in prostate cancer progression to androgen independent and metastasis, and shed light on finding new targets for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer.""","""['Bang-Xiang Xie', 'Hui Zhang', 'Jian Wang', 'Bo Pang', 'Rui-Qin Wu', 'Xiao-Long Qian', 'Lan Yu', 'Shan-Hu Li', 'Qing-Guo Shi', 'Cui-Fen Huang', 'Jian-Guang Zhou']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Androl""","""['Gene expression in the LNCaP human prostate cancer progression model: progression associated expression in vitro corresponds to expression changes associated with prostate cancer progression in vivo.', 'Profiling of gene expression changes caused by p53 gain-of-function mutant alleles in prostate cancer cells.', 'Microarray analysis of differential gene expression in androgen independent prostate cancer using a metastatic human prostate cancer cell line model.', 'Human prostate cancer progression models and therapeutic intervention.', 'Molecular analysis for prostate cancer.', 'Long-Chain Acyl Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase, a Key Player in Metabolic Rewiring/Invasiveness in Experimental Tumors and Human Mesothelioma Cell Lines.', 'Construction of a fatty acid metabolism-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and immune response in breast cancer.', 'A Metabolism-Related Gene Prognostic Index Bridging Metabolic Signatures and Antitumor Immune Cycling in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'The oncogenic landscape of the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a narrative review.', 'Identification of hub genes associated with obesity-induced hepatocellular carcinoma risk based on integrated bioinformatics analysis.']"""

The purpose of this study is to provide an explicit description of [(153)Sm]Sm-EDTMP pharmacokinetics, adopting a simple three-compartmental model with the analytical expressions calculating the rate constants and determining biodistribution parameters, like radiopharmaceutical uptake and clearance. This biokinetic model allowed us to calculate on an individual basis the dose to bone surface and to red bone marrow and to assess the degree of variability in dosimetric parameters using a fixed administered activity based only on patient weight. In this study twenty patients were enrolled and were treated with [(153)Sm]Sm-EDTMP, administering a fixed activity per kilogram (37 MBq/kg); blood and urine samples were collected during 24 h post treatment. The median value of the administered activity was 2.7 GBq. Blood clearance confirmed that an aliquot of [(153)Sm]Sm-EDTMP rapidly localizes and is retained in bone, while the remainder is rapidly cleared from the blood pool by the urinary system. Our data show a bi-exponential clearance from blood: the rapid component has a half life median value of 6 min (range: 2-24 min), while the slow one has a half life median value of 1.4 h (range: 0.6-5.8 h). Median value of the urinary excretion is 40 (range: 3-75) % of the administered activity. Our model shows the behaviour of a tracer which is distributed in the extracellular space of the body, localized in the skeleton and excreted via glomerular filtration. Half life median values of [(153)Sm]Sm-EDTMP transferring between compartments, T(1/2) (blood→ECF), T(1/2) (ECF→blood) are 7.4 (range: 1.9-37) and 48 (range: 8-408) min, respectively. Median values of half lives of [(153)Sm]Sm-EDTMP clearance through the urine and of uptake into bone are 1.0 (range: 0.1-6.0) and 1.6 (range: 0.6-9.0) h, respectively. Median value of red marrow absorbed dose is 2.1 (range: 0.7-3.5) Gy and 0.8 (range: 0.3-2.1) Gy/GBq, while median value of bone surface absorbed dose is 11.5 Gy (range: 5.0-18.4) and 4.4 (range: 2.3-14.3) Gy/GBq. It is remarkable that there is a really great biological variability within patients, especially considering the excreted activity. The cumulated activity in bone and red marrow doses were significantly higher in prostate cancer, where metastatic bone lesions are osteoblastic, than in breast cancer where metastatic bone lesions are osteolytic or mixed (lytic/blastic). The relevant biological variability in biodistribution and metabolism of [(153)Sm]Sm-EDTMP suggests that the fixed administered activity based on patient weight is not sufficient to optimize the treatment and a better optimization would be reached by using a predictive dosimetry tailored to individual patient characteristics.""","""['L Vigna', 'R Matheoud', 'S Ridone', 'D Arginelli', 'P Della Monica', 'M Rudoni', 'E Inglese', 'M Brambilla']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Improving the dose-myelotoxicity correlation in radiometabolic therapy of bone metastases with 153Sm-EDTMP.', 'Dosimetry and toxicity of Quadramet for bone marrow ablation in multiple myeloma and other haematological malignancies.', 'Pharmacokinetic, Dosimetry and Toxicity Study of ¹⁷⁷Lu-EDTMP in Patients: Phase 0/I study.', '153Sm-EDTMP for bone pain palliation in skeletal metastases.', 'Samarium lexidronam (153Sm-EDTMP): skeletal radiation for osteoblastic bone metastases and osteosarcoma.', 'Quantitative Imaging for Targeted Radionuclide Therapy Dosimetry - Technical Review.', 'The elements of life and medicines.', 'Beyond Palliation: Therapeutic Applications of 153Samarium-EDTMP.', 'Improving the dose-myelotoxicity correlation in radiometabolic therapy of bone metastases with 153Sm-EDTMP.']"""

Methods and materials:   From April 2007 to October 2008, 36 patients with prostate cancer received intensity-modulated radiotherapy with daily localization by use of implanted fiducials. Orthogonal kilovoltage (kV) portal imaging preceded all 1244 treatments. Cone-beam computed tomography images were also obtained before 286 treatments (23%). Shifts in the anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), and left-right (LR) dimensions were made from kV fiducial imaging. Cone-beam computed tomography shifts based on soft tissues were recorded. Shifts were compared by use of Bland-Altman limits of agreement. Mean and standard deviation of absolute differences were also compared. A difference of 5 mm or less was acceptable. Subsets including start date, body mass index, and prostate size were analyzed.  Results:   Of 286 treatments, 81 (28%) resulted in a greater than 5.0-mm difference in one or more dimensions. Mean differences in the AP, SI, and LR dimensions were 3.4 ± 2.6 mm, 3.1 ± 2.7 mm, and 1.3 ± 1.6 mm, respectively. Most deviations occurred in the posterior (fiducials, 78%; CBCT, 59%), superior (79%, 61%), and left (57%, 63%) directions. Bland-Altman 95% confidence intervals were -4.0 to 9.3 mm for AP, -9.0 to 5.3 mm for SI, and -4.1 to 3.9 mm for LR. The percentages of shift agreements within ±5 mm were 72.4% for AP, 72.7% for SI, and 97.2% for LR. Correlation between imaging techniques was not altered by time, body mass index, or prostate size.  Conclusions:   Cone-beam computed tomography and kV fiducial imaging are similar; however, more than one-fourth of CBCT and kV shifts differed enough to affect target coverage. This was even more pronounced with smaller margins (3 mm). Fiducial imaging requires less daily physician input, is less time-consuming, and is our preferred method for prostate image-guided radiotherapy.""","""['Brandon M Barney', 'R Jeffrey Lee', 'Diana Handrahan', 'Keith T Welsh', 'J Taylor Cook', 'William T Sause']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['The potential failure risk of the cone-beam computed tomography-based planning target volume margin definition for prostate image-guided radiotherapy based on a prospective single-institutional hybrid analysis.', 'The impact of the three degrees-of-freedom fiducial marker-based setup compared to soft tissue-based setup in hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of kV Orthogonal Radiographs and kV-Cone-Beam Computed Tomography Image-Guided Radiotherapy Methods With and Without Implanted Fiducials in Prostate Cancer.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'The role of image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'In Regard to Shee et al.', 'Reducing ExacTrac intrafraction imaging uncertainty for prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy using a pre-treatment CBCT.', 'A cycle generative adversarial network for improving the quality of four-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography images.', 'Dosimetric Study of Deep Learning-Guided ITV Prediction in Cone-beam CT for Lung Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.']"""

However, a recently presented analysis for the first time challenged this association between body mass index (BMI) and treatment failure. It is therefore important to provide further data on this issue.  Methods and materials:   This was a retrospective analysis of 564 men treated with risk-adapted conformal EBRT at a single institution. Low-risk patients received EBRT alone, and the other patients received EBRT plus endocrine treatment. In addition, high-risk patients were treated to higher EBRT doses (74 Gy). A rectal balloon catheter for internal immobilization, which can be identified on portal images, was used in 261 patients (46%). Thus, localization did not rely on bony landmarks alone in these cases.  Results:   The median BMI was 26, and 15% of patients had BMI≥30. Neither univariate nor multivariate analyses detected any significant impact of BMI on biochemical relapse, prostate cancer-specific survival, or overall survival. The 5-year biochemical relapse rate was 21% and prostate cancer-specific survival 96%.

Extended biopsy improves diagnostic accuracy and provides more reliable prognostic information. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that greater biopsy core number should result in improved treatment outcome through better tailoring of therapy.  Methods and materials:   From April 1995 to May 2006, 1,613 prostate cancer patients were treated with permanent brachytherapy. Patients were divided into five groups stratified by the number of prostate biopsy cores (≤6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-20, and >20 cores). Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated as a function of core number.  Results:   The median patient age was 66 years, and the median preimplant prostate-specific antigen was 6.5 ng/mL. The overall 10-year bPFS, CSS, and OS were 95.6%, 98.3%, and 78.6%, respectively. When bPFS was analyzed as a function of core number, the 10-year bPFS for patients with >20, 13-20, 10-12, 7-9 and ≤6 cores was 100%, 100%, 98.3%, 95.8%, and 93.0% (p < 0.001), respectively. When evaluated by treatment era (1995-2000 vs. 2001-2006), the number of biopsy cores remained a statistically significant predictor of bPFS. On multivariate analysis, the number of biopsy cores was predictive of bPFS but did not predict for CSS or OS.  Conclusion:   Greater biopsy core number was associated with a statistically significant improvement in bPFS. Comprehensive regional sampling of the prostate may enhance diagnostic accuracy compared to a standard biopsy scheme, resulting in better tailoring of therapy.""","""['Nathan Bittner', 'Gregory S Merrick', 'Robert W Galbreath', 'Wayne M Butler', 'Edward Adamovich', 'Kent E Wallner']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Whole-pelvis radiotherapy in combination with interstitial brachytherapy: does coverage of the pelvic lymph nodes improve treatment outcome in high-risk prostate cancer?', 'Androgen deprivation therapy does not impact cause-specific or overall survival in high-risk prostate cancer managed with brachytherapy and supplemental external beam.', 'Optimized prostate brachytherapy minimizes the prognostic impact of percent of biopsy cores involved with adenocarcinoma.', 'High-risk prostate cancer with Gleason score 8-10 and PSA level ≤15 ng/mL treated with permanent interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Prostate brachytherapy in men > or =75 years of age.', 'Tumor burden and location as prognostic factors in patients treated by iodine seed implant brachytherapy for localized prostate cancers.', 'Cost-containment protocols for prostate core needle biopsies: hypothetical scenarios to reduce procedural costs.', 'An appraisal of analytical tools used in predicting clinical outcomes following radiation therapy treatment of men with prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Stratification of brachytherapy-treated intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients into favorable and unfavorable cohorts.']"""

The higher the number of samples, the greater is the pain and discomfort. The objective of this study was to compare three anesthetic techniques in this group of patients.  Methods:   Forty-five patients were included in this study. Patients were divided into three groups: 1 - Propofol; 2 - Propofol + Prostatic Plexus Block; 3 - Propofol + Fentanyl. Patients were monitored with non-invasive blood pressure, continuous electrocardioscopy, pulse oximetry (SpO₂), and Bispectral Index. Patients did not receive pre-anesthetic medication. Intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic parameters, intraoperative bispectral index, and postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) and the use of dypirone to treat postoperative pain were evaluated.  Results:   A significant difference among the three groups was not observed for: anthropometric parameters, amount of propofol, number of fragments, and duration of the exam.

However, previous studies have not accurately reproduced the precise conditions of current clinical cryotherapy. The objective of this study is to assess the immunological effects of cryotreated whole tumour cells on dendritic cells (DC) maturation and function using an in vitro model. Prostate cancer cells were cooled using Endocare cryo-system to mimic temperatures achieved during clinical cryotherapy. Human DC were prepared from cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 monocytes and matured with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cryotreated cancer cells were added to DC on day 3. On day 7, DC were harvested and phenotyped. Cytokine gene expression was assessed using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Functional activity of DC was assessed in allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) and the molecular changes using gene microarray technology. There was statistically significant upregulation of costimulatory molecules and maturation markers (CD86, CD83, CD80 and CL II) in DC loaded with cryotreated whole tumour cells compared to both control DC and DC matured with LPS (P < 0.001). There was a significant increase in stimulatory cytokines gene expression (IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18 and IFN-γ). However, IL-10 and TGF-β expression reduced significantly. The effect of different freezing temperature was equal. cDNA microarray analysis showed upregulation of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and cycline dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A (p21) and downregulation of Caspase 8 and BCL2. Overall, our findings suggest that the effect of cryotherapy is generally stimulatory to DC which may enhance anti-tumour effects.

Objective:   To describe technique and outcomes for athermal DVC division followed by selective suture ligation (DVC-SSL) compared with DVC suture ligation followed by athermal division (SL-DVC).  Design, settings, and participants:   Retrospective study of prospectively collected data from February 2008 to July 2010 for 303 SL-DVC and 240 DVC-SSL procedures.

Runx2, an osteoblast master transcription factor, is aberrantly expressed in PCa cells, and promotes their metastatic phenotype. The transcriptional programs regulated by Runx2 have been extensively studied during osteoblastogenesis, where it activates or represses target genes in a context-dependent manner. However, little is known about the gene regulatory networks influenced by Runx2 in PCa cells. We therefore investigated genome wide mRNA expression changes in PCa cells in response to Runx2.  Results:   We engineered a C4-2B PCa sub-line called C4-2B/Rx2 dox, in which Doxycycline (Dox) treatment stimulates Runx2 expression from very low to levels observed in other PCa cells. Transcriptome profiling using whole genome expression array followed by in silico analysis indicated that Runx2 upregulated a multitude of genes with prominent cancer associated functions. They included secreted factors (CSF2, SDF-1), proteolytic enzymes (MMP9, CST7), cytoskeleton modulators (SDC2, Twinfilin, SH3PXD2A), intracellular signaling molecules (DUSP1, SPHK1, RASD1) and transcription factors (Sox9, SNAI2, SMAD3) functioning in epithelium to mesenchyme transition (EMT), tissue invasion, as well as homing and attachment to bone. Consistent with the gene expression data, induction of Runx2 in C4-2B cells enhanced their invasiveness. It also promoted cellular quiescence by blocking the G1/S phase transition during cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the cell cycle block was reversed as Runx2 levels declined after Dox withdrawal.  Conclusions:   The effects of Runx2 in C4-2B/Rx2 dox cells, as well as similar observations made by employing LNCaP, 22RV1 and PC3 cells, highlight multiple mechanisms by which Runx2 promotes the metastatic phenotype of PCa cells, including tissue invasion, homing to bone and induction of high bone turnover. Runx2 is therefore an attractive target for the development of novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches to PCa management. Targeting Runx2 may prove more effective than focusing on its individual downstream genes and pathways.""","""['Sanjeev K Baniwal', 'Omar Khalid', 'Yankel Gabet', 'Ruchir R Shah', 'Daniel J Purcell', 'Deepak Mav', 'Alice E Kohn-Gabet', 'Yunfan Shi', 'Gerhard A Coetzee', 'Baruch Frenkel']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Recruitment of coregulator G9a by Runx2 for selective enhancement or suppression of transcription.', 'MicroRNA-466 inhibits tumor growth and bone metastasis in prostate cancer by direct regulation of osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2.', 'Role of Runx2 phosphorylation in prostate cancer and association with metastatic disease.', 'Regulatory roles of Runx2 in metastatic tumor and cancer cell interactions with bone.', 'Networks and hubs for the transcriptional control of osteoblastogenesis.', 'Decoding key cell sub-populations and molecular alterations in glioblastoma at recurrence by single-cell analysis.', 'The RUNX/CBFβ Complex in Breast Cancer: A Conundrum of Context.', 'RUNX2 interacts with SCD1 and activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Deregulated molecules and pathways in the predisposition and dissemination of breast cancer cells to bone.', 'Translational Strategies to Target Metastatic Bone Disease.']"""

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) and prostate-specific acid phosphatase (PSAP) are expressed in benign and malignant prostatic tissue, and immunohistochemical staining for these markers is often used to confirm the prostatic origin of metastatic carcinoma. PSA expression has been reported in male and female breast carcinoma and in gynecomastia, raising concerns about the utility of PSA for differentiating prostate carcinoma metastasis to the male breast from primary breast carcinoma. This study examined the frequency of PSA, PSAP, and hormone receptor expression in male breast carcinoma (MBC), female breast carcinoma (FBC), and gynecomastia.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical staining for PSA, PSAP, AR, ER, and PR was performed on tissue microarrays representing six cases of gynecomastia, thirty MBC, and fifty-six FBC.  Results:   PSA was positive in two of fifty-six FBC (3.7%), focally positive in one of thirty MBC (3.3%), and negative in the five examined cases of gynecomastia. PSAP expression was absent in MBC, FBC, and gynecomastia. Hormone receptor expression was similar in males and females (AR 74.1% in MBC vs. 67.9% in FBC, p = 0.62; ER 85.2% vs. 68.5%, p = 0.18; and PR 51.9% vs. 48.2%, p = 0.82).  Conclusions:   PSA and PSAP are useful markers to distinguish primary breast carcinoma from prostate carcinoma metastatic to the male breast. Although PSA expression appeared to correlate with hormone receptor expression, the incidence of PSA expression in our population was too low to draw significant conclusions about an association between PSA expression and hormone receptor status in breast lesions.""","""['Teresa S Kraus', 'Cynthia Cohen', 'Momin T Siddiqui']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Diagn Pathol""","""['Expression of androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen in male breast carcinoma.', 'Immunohistochemical localization of prostate-specific antigen in ductal epithelium of male breast.

Because it has been thought that identifying the disease earlier leads to better outcomes, there has been a great deal of interest in screening for the disease. Since the late 1980s, testing for elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in blood has been the most prominent screening tool. Despite widespread adoption of PSA testing, however, it remains controversial. It has been shown that elevated PSA levels do not always indicate cancer and low PSA levels do not ensure that cancer is absent. In addition, there has been conflicting evidence about whether definitive treatment of prostate cancer is always indicated. As a result of the conflicting evidence on the efficacy of PSA testing as a screening tool and the necessity of treatment of prostate cancer in all cases, national organizations have issued various guidelines for screening. Thus, the decision to screen or not to screen remains in the court of the individual patient and physician.

Different diagnostic tests are usually sensitive to different aspects of the disease. A desirable approach is to combine multiple diagnostic tests so as to obtain an optimal composite diagnostic test with higher sensitivity and specificity that detects the presence of the disease more accurately. To accomplish this, it has been observed via signal detection theory developed in the 1950s and 1960s, that the optimal combination of different diagnostic variables (i.e. the diagnostic test results) is determined by the likelihood ratio function for the diseased and nondiseased groups. The conventional approach is to fit parametric models for the diseased and nondiseased groups separately and then to use the fitted likelihood ratio function for the best combination of test results. However, this approach is not so robust if the underlying distribution functions are misspecified. Since the optimal combination depends only on the likelihood ratio function, it would be more appropriate to model this function directly. A two-sample semiparametric inference technique is applied to the model for the likelihood ratio function. We consider the best combination of multiple diagnostic tests, and study semiparametric likelihood estimation of the optimal receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve.

Twenty-six patients with castration-resistant prostate carcinoma had FCH, BS and CT imaging within a 2-month period. Individual FCH-positive lesions in bone were compared to the BS and soft tissue lesions were compared to CT. The lesions were then classified as concordant or discordant for the presence or absence of prostate cancer metastases. Discordant bone or soft tissue lesions were followed up with BS or CT, respectively, at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years or until a definitive diagnosis of the discordant lesion could be made.  Results:   In 13 (50%) of the patients, all lesions identified were concordant; this included 5 patients in whom no lesions could be identified with any imaging modality. In 21 patients, 183 lesions were observed with 149 being concordant and 34 (19%) being discordant (13 patients). Based on follow-up, FCH correctly identified the presence or absence of disease in 27 of 34 lesions, and in 14 cases FCH-positive lesions, not identified on initial imaging, were confirmed as disease on follow-up.

Until now, it is not known which part of the prostate shrinks more. We examined patients with and without ADT undergoing intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) and performed 3-dimensional measurements of the peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland (CG) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Methods and materials:   Prostate gland volumes of PZ and CG between planning MRI and first available follow-up MRI were retrospectively determined in 44 patients with localized prostate carcinoma. A total of 24 patients had ADT with a median time interval of 5 months (range, 1.5-24 months). Median time interval between both MRI time points was 132 days (range, 104-224 days). Two observers performed PZ and CG delineation in consensus using planimetry. Volume changes over time were determined and compared.  Results:   Patients who had ADT showed smaller prostate volume in the first MRI (mean [SD], 32 [16.7] mL), which was still present after IMRT (28.1 [16.7] mL). Patients who had no ADT started with 44.6 (16.9) mL and showed 37.5 (13.9) mL after IMRT. Shrinking effect in PZ was significantly larger than in CG for all patients (-18.3% vs -6.3%, P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Because, typically, most tumors are located in PZ and this area also shows the largest shrinkage effect after IMRT, this should be taken into account for planning purposes. Notably, there are only minor differences in the relative shrinking effects between patients with and without ADT, although they start with different volumes.""","""['Christian M Zechmann', 'Tobias Simpfendörfer', 'Frederik L Giesel', 'Patrik Zamecnik', 'Christian Thieke', 'Thomas Hielscher', 'Hans-Peter Meinzer', 'Stefan Delorme']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Comput Assist Tomogr""","""['Changes of prostate gland volume with and without androgen deprivation after intensity modulated radiotherapy - A follow-up study.', 'Clinical toxicities and dosimetric parameters after whole-pelvis versus prostate-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'The radiation doses to erectile tissues defined with magnetic resonance imaging after intensity-modulated radiation therapy or iodine-125 brachytherapy.', 'Anal wall sparing effect of an endorectal balloon in 3D conformal and intensity-modulated prostate radiotherapy.', 'Predictive value of MRI in the localization, staging, volume estimation, assessment of aggressiveness, and guidance of radiotherapy and biopsies in prostate cancer.', 'Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Values of the Benign Central Zone of the Prostate: Comparison With Low- and High-Grade Prostate Cancer.', 'Effect of pretreatment prostate volume on urinary quality of life following intensity-modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Normal central zone of the prostate and central zone involvement by prostate cancer: clinical and MR imaging implications.']"""

It is a quadruplex-forming oligodeoxynucleotide that binds to nucleolin as an aptamer, but its mechanism of action is not completely understood. Mechanistic insights could lead to clinically useful markers for AS1411 response and to novel targeted therapies. Previously, we proposed a model where cell surface nucleolin serves as the receptor for AS1411, leading to selective uptake in cancer cells. Here, we compare uptake of fluorophore-labeled AS1411 (FL-AS1411) in DU145 prostate cancer cells (sensitive to AS1411) and Hs27 nonmalignant skin fibroblasts (resistant to AS1411). Uptake of FL-AS1411 occurred by endocytosis in both cell types and was much more efficient than an inactive, nonquadruplex oligonucleotide. Unexpectedly, uptake of FL-AS1411 was lower in cancer cells compared with Hs27 cells. However, the mechanism of uptake was different, occurring by macropinocytosis in cancer cells, but by a nonmacropinocytic pathway in Hs27 cells. Additionally, treatment of various cancer cells with AS1411 caused hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis, provoking an increase in its own uptake, whereas no stimulation was observed for nonmalignant cells. Nucleolin was not required for initial FL-AS1411 uptake in DU145 cells but was necessary for induced macropinocytosis and FL-AS1411 uptake at later times. Our results are inconsistent with the previous mechanistic model but confirm that nucleolin plays a role in mediating AS1411 effects. The data suggest a new model for AS1411 action as well as a new role for nucleolin in stimulating macropinocytosis, a process with potential applications in drug delivery.""","""['E Merit Reyes-Reyes', 'Yun Teng', 'Paula J Bates']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Mechanistic studies of anticancer aptamer AS1411 reveal a\xa0novel role for nucleolin in regulating Rac1 activation.', 'Aptamer-based Targeted Delivery of a G-quadruplex Ligand in Cervical Cancer Cells.', 'The nucleolin targeting aptamer AS1411 destabilizes Bcl-2 messenger RNA in human breast cancer cells.', 'G-quadruplex oligonucleotide AS1411 as a cancer-targeting agent: Uses and mechanisms.', 'Therapeutic applications of AS1411 aptamer, an update review.', 'Identification of new aptamer BC-3 targeting RPS7 from rapid screening for bladder carcinoma.', 'An insight into fluorescence and magnetic resonance bioimaging using a multifunctional polyethyleneimine-passivated gadocarbon dots nanoconstruct assembled with AS1411.', 'NIR/pH-triggered aptamer-functionalized DNA origami nanovehicle for imaging-guided chemo-phototherapy.', 'DNA-Based Nanomaterials as Drug Delivery Platforms for Increasing the Effect of Drugs in Tumors.', 'Quantitative Evaluation of a Multimodal Aptamer-Targeted Long-Circulating Polymer for Tumor Targeting.']"""

Small hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of DLC1 was insufficient to promote more aggressive phenotypes associated with tumor cell growth. In contrast, DLC1 silencing promoted pro-angiogenic responses through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) upregulation, accompanied by the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and its nuclear localization. Notably, modulation of VEGF expression by DLC1 was dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor-MAP/ERK kinase-hypoxia-inducible factor 1 signaling but on RhoA pathways.

Previously published results found a significant difference between specific glycan levels in patients with advanced prostate cancer and healthy controls. N-Glycans from the whole serum glycoproteins were measured using our fully quantitative high-throughput N-glycan analysis in combination with exoglycosidase digestions in sera from 13 BPH and 34 prostate cancer samples (17 Gleason score 5 and 17 Gleason score 7). The levels of core-fucosylated biantennary glycans and α2-3-linked sialic acids were significantly increased in prostate cancer patients compared with patients with BPH. Triantennary trigalactosylated glycans and tetraantennary tetrasialylated glycans with outer arm fucose were significantly decreased, and tetraantennary tetrasialylated glycans increased in Gleason 7 compared with Gleason 5. All these glycans can distinguish prostate cancer patients from BPH or Gleason 7 from Gleason 5 prostate cancer patients better than the current clinical test, prostate-specific antigen; therefore, their measurement may provide a new noninvasive approach to diagnose prostate cancer. However, additional validation studies would need to be carried out to further support this finding. Decreases in triantennary trigalactosylated glycans and/or bisected core-fucosylated biantennary monosialylated glycans and increases in tetraantennary tetrasialylated glycans correlate with perineural invasion, which could further help to diagnose tumor spread and predict patients' survival.""","""['Radka Saldova', 'Yue Fan', 'John M Fitzpatrick', 'R William G Watson', 'Pauline M Rudd']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Glycobiology""","""[]"""

Previous studies have suggested changes in the expression of specific components in prostate cancer, especially of 4.1 proteins (encoded by EPB41 genes) which form nodes in this network.  Methods:   Expression of EPB41L1, EPB41L2, EPB41L3 (protein: 4.1B), EPB41L4B (EHM2), EPB41L5, EPB49 (dematin), VIL2 (ezrin), and DLG1 (summarized as ""cortical cytoskeleton"" genes) as well as ERG was measured by quantitative RT-PCR in a well-characterized set of 45 M0 prostate adenocarcinoma and 13 benign tissues. Hypermethylation of EPB41L3 and GSTP1 was compared in 93 cancer tissues by methylation-specific PCR. Expression of 4.1B was further studied by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   EPB41L1 and EPB41L3 were significantly downregulated and EPB41L4B was upregulated in cancer tissues. Low EPB41L1 or high EPB41L4B expression were associated with earlier biochemical recurrence. None of the other cortical cytoskeleton genes displayed expression changes, in particular EPB49 and VIL2, despite hints from previous studies. EPB41L3 downregulation was significantly associated with hypermethylation of its promoter and strongly correlated with GSTP1 hypermethylation. Protein 4.1B was detected most strongly in the basal cells of normal prostate epithelia. Its expression in carcinoma cells was similar to the weaker one in normal luminal cells. EPB41L3 downregulation and EPB41L4B upregulation were essentially restricted to the 22 cases with ERG overexpression. Expression changes in EPB41L3 and EPB41L4B closely paralleled those previously observed for the extracellular matrix genes FBLN1 and SPOCK1, respectively.  Conclusions:   Specific changes in the cortical cytoskeleton were observed during prostate cancer progression. They parallel changes in the expression of extracellular matrix components and all together appear to be associated with oncogenic ERG overexpression.

Thus, involving patients and their family members in treatment choices is complex and little is known about how patients and their partners process these decisions when there is uncertainty about different outcomes. This paper has reviewed the literature on the way couples approach such decision making in relation to treatment for prostate cancer.  Objective:   A meta-ethnographic synthesis of published qualitative papers that focused on the influences on patients', and their partners' treatment decision making for prostate cancer, was conducted in order to identify and understand barriers and facilitators which impact on this process.  Results:   Our synthesis indicates that the couples' relationship 'dynamic' provides a contextual background against which treatment decisions are negotiated and made.

Castration therapy has rather modest effects on cell death in tumours but can be enhanced by other treatments targeting tumour stroma and vasculature. This study shows that the prostate becomes hypoxic following castration and that targeting hypoxic cells during castration therapy potently enhances the effects of castration.  Objective:   To explore the effects of castration therapy, the standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer, in relation to tumour hypoxia and to elicit its importance for the short- and long-term therapeutic response.  Material and methods:   We used the androgen-sensitive rat Dunning H prostate tumour model that transiently responds to castration treatment followed by a subsequent relapse, much like the scenario in human patients. Tumour tissues were analysed using stereological methods in intact, 1 and 7 days after castration therapy.  Results:   Hypoxia was transiently up-regulated after castration therapy and correlated with the induction of tumour cell apoptosis. When castration therapy was combined with tirapazamine (TPZ), a drug that targets hypoxic cells and the vasculature, the effects on tumour cell apoptosis and tumour volume were enhanced in comparison to either castration or TPZ alone.

Methods:   We examined 203 men of European ancestry with clinical stage T1c CaP diagnosed at a ""normal"" PSA and 611 healthy volunteer controls. The genotypes for 17 different risk alleles were compared between CaP cases and controls. Additional analyses were used to compare the pathologic features between carriers and non-carriers (defined using best-fit genetic model) of these variants.  Results:   All risk alleles were present at an increased frequency in cases with ""normal"" PSA values and DRE compared to controls. Amongst CaP patients, carriers of an increasing number of genetic risk factors (i.e., alleles and positive family history) were at a significantly increased risk of CaP (P-trend <0.001). Specifically, men with >10 genetic risk factors had an 11.2-fold risk (95% CI 4.3-29.2) of having the disease compared to men with ≤5 variants. There also was a higher frequency of many the variants amongst men with adverse pathologic features.  Conclusions:   A substantial proportion of biopsy-detectable CaP occurs in men with ""normal"" PSA levels and negative DRE.

The purpose of this study was to develop a standardized method to provide a representative high quality research sample from radical prostatectomy specimens without interfering with the routine histopathological procedure.  Methods:   A complete transversal slice is collected and snap-frozen before formalin fixation and routine processing of the remaining gland. The freezing preserves the original geometric shape, thus allowing subsampling of specific cell populations without thawing. RNA was extracted from 53 cylindrical subsamples (diameter 3 mm, thickness 2 mm) from 16 consecutive frozen slices. The histological pattern was evaluated by microscopy of a cryosection from sample before further analysis.  Results:   Using this novel harvesting method close to 400 slices have been collected. Whenever tumor was present in both adjacent surrounding hematoxylin-eosin sections, we found cancer in 88% of the frozen slices.

In the present study, we have addressed the question whether these coactivators enhance activity of estrogen receptor-beta (ER-β), which is variably expressed in prostate cancers.  Methods:   Expression levels of the coactivators p300 and CBP were manipulated by plasmid or siRNA transfections and activity of ER-β was measured by luciferase assays. Viability was measured by MTT assays and cellular migration was determined by wound-healing and Boyden chamber assays.  Results:   High expression of ER-β was found in PC3 cells which were used for the experiments. p300 or CBP enhanced activation of ER-β by genistein. Antiestrogens did not acquire agonistic properties in the presence of increased concentrations of either coactivator. Inhibition of p300 or CBP decreased genistein stimulation of ER-β. Genistein reduced migration of PC3 prostate cancer cells and down-regulation of p300 potentiated this effect.

It is validated by treatment plan comparisons for three intra-cranial, pancreas, and prostate cases each. Based on a patient specific matrix listing the radiological quality of candidate beam directions individually for every target voxel, a set of locally ideal beam angles is generated. The spherical distribution of locally ideal beam angles is characteristic for every treatment site and patient: ideal beam angles typically cluster around distinct orientations. We interpret the cluster centroids, which are identified with a spherical K-means algorithm, as irradiation angles of an intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment plan. The fluence profiles are subsequently optimized during a conventional inverse planning process. The average computation time for the pre-optimization of a beam ensemble is six minutes on a state-of-the-art work station. The treatment planning study demonstrates the potential benefit of the proposed beam angle optimization strategy. For the three prostate cases under investigation, the standard treatment plans applying nine coplanar equi-spaced beams and treatment plans applying an optimized non-coplanar nine-beam ensemble yield clinically comparable dose distributions. For symmetric patient geometries, the dose distribution formed by nine equi-spaced coplanar beams cannot be improved significantly. For the three pancreas and intra-cranial cases under investigation, the optimized non-coplanar beam ensembles enable better sparing of organs at risk while guaranteeing equivalent target coverage. Beam angle optimization by spherical cluster analysis shows the biggest impact for target volumes located asymmetrically within the patient and close to organs at risk.""","""['Mark Bangert', 'Uwe Oelfke']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Development of methods for beam angle optimization for IMRT using an accelerated exhaustive search strategy.', 'Beam orientation optimization for intensity-modulated radiation therapy using mixed integer programming.', 'On the beam direction search space in computerized non-coplanar beam angle optimization for IMRT-prostate SBRT.', 'Robust Angle Selection in Particle Therapy.', 'A reinforcement learning application of a guided Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for beam orientation selection in radiation therapy.', 'A data-driven approach to optimal beam/arc angle selection for liver stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Comparison of non-coplanar optimization of static beams and arc trajectories for intensity-modulated treatments of meningioma cases.', 'Machine learning applications in radiation oncology.', 'Dosimetric comparison of coplanar and non-coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy in head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy.']"""

Based on measured HSP expression data, a mathematical model was developed for predicting thermally induced HSP expression. Cell viability was measured with propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry to quantify the injury parameters necessary for predicting cell death following hyperthermia.  Results:   Significant Hsp27 and Hsp70 levels were induced in both cell types with maximum HSP expression occurring at 16 h post-heating, and diminishing substantially after 72 h. PC3 cells were slightly more sensitive to thermal stress than RWPE-1 cells. Arrhenius analysis of injury data suggested a transition between injury mechanisms at 54°C. HSP expression and injury models were effective at predicting cellular response to hyperthermia.  Conclusion:   Measurement of thermally induced HSP expression kinetics and cell viability associated with hyperthermia enabled development of thermal dosimetry guidelines and predictive models for HSP expression and cell injury as a function of thermal stress to investigate and design more effective hyperthermia therapies.""","""['Marissa Nichole Rylander', 'Yusheng Feng', 'Kristen Zimmermann', 'Kenneth R Diller']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['Heat shock protein expression and temperature distribution in prostate tumours treated with laser irradiation and nanoshells.', 'Optimizing heat shock protein expression induced by prostate cancer laser therapy through predictive computational models.', 'Heat shock protein expression independently predicts clinical outcome in prostate cancer.', 'Thermally induced injury and heat-shock protein expression in cells and tissues.', 'Heat shock proteins in prostate cancer: from tumorigenesis to the clinic.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Interventions for Liver Transplantation.', 'Multilayer In Vitro Human Skin Tissue Platforms for Quantitative Burn Injury Investigation.', 'In Vitro Measurement and Mathematical Modeling of Thermally-Induced Injury in Pancreatic Cancer Cells.', 'Interstitial Optical Monitoring of Focal Laser Ablation.', 'Fast and high temperature hyperthermia coupled with radiotherapy as a possible new treatment for glioblastoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   Hyperthermic cell death of human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) was determined after various heating settings and correlated to the thermal conditions using an Arrhenius model prior to LGNS ablation. PC-3 cells with gold nanoshells (GNS) and QDs were exposed to a near-infrared laser and QD excitation light. When the cells were heated by GNS, local temperature was measured using the temperature-dependent fluorescence intensity of QDs. Using the predetermined Arrhenius model, the thermal dose (i.e., cell death of PC-3 cells) by LGNS was estimated with local temperatures measured with QD-mediated thermometry. The estimated thermal dose was confirmed with calcein-acetoxy-methylester viability assay.  Results:   For PC-3 cell line, the activation energy and frequency factor of the Arrhenius model were 86.78 kcal/mol and 6.35 × 10(55) Hz, respectively. During LGNS ablation of PC-3 cells, QD-mediated temperature measurement showed that the temperature of the laser spot increased rapidly to ∼58 °C ± 4 °C. The estimated thermal dose showed that cell death reached to ∼90% in 120 seconds. The death cell zone observed after staining corresponded to a peak area of the temperature profile generated after analysis of the QD fluorescence intensity.  Conclusions:   This study shows that the QD fluorescence thermometry can accurately monitor the PC-3 cell death by LGNS ablation.

Therefore, early detection by prostate-specific antigen screening and a comprehensive strategy for cancer prevention are essential for Asian people. The exposure rate of prostate-specific antigen screening is very low in Asian countries. Increased prostate-specific antigen screening may reduce the mortality rate. The stances regarding population screening differ among countries. Urological associations should promote population screening. Reliable data from Asian countries are needed. The prostate cancer incidence is low in Asian countries, perhaps due to high soy consumption. Isoflavones may prevent prostate cancer in Asian countries, but that is not yet clear. A large, multinational study in Asia is needed to clarify whether or not isoflavone consumption shows efficacy in preventing prostate cancer. Clinical data suggest that hormonal therapy is more effective in Asians than in Westerners.

We sought to further characterize the association of IL-18BP with prostate cancer and determine whether IL-18BP levels in patient serum and urine samples had clinical relevance. IL-18BP was expressed and secreted by the prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3 but not by LNCaP and CWR22, upon interferon-γ (IFN-γ) stimulation. IFN-γ-induced secretion of IL-18BP was enhanced by added TNF-α, IFN-α and IFN-β. The IL-18BP secreted from DU145 and PC3 functionally inhibited IL-18. Immunohistochemical analyses showed positive IL-18BP staining in prostate cancer cells as well as in macrophages in radical prostatectomy specimens. Significant differences in urinary IL-18BP levels (normalized by total protein) collected post-DRE were found between cases with and without cancer on biopsy (p = 0.02) and serum IL-18BP levels correlated with Gleason score (p = 0.03).

The purpose of this study is to identify candidate miRNAs whose levels are altered in response to radiation in prostate cancer cells and to investigate the molecular pathway of such miRNAs in the regulation of radiation-induced cellular response.  Methods:   Using a miRNA microarray assay, we screened 132 cancerous miRNAs in LNCaP cells in response to radiation treatment. The function of one candidate miRNA was investigated for checkpoint protein expression, cell cycle arrest, cell proliferation, and cell survival in cells transfected with precursor or antisense miRNA.  Results:   In response to radiation, multiple miRNAs, including mi-106b, showed altered expression. Cells transfected with precursor miR-106b were able to suppress radiation-induced p21 activation. Functionally, exogenous addition of precursor miR-106b overrode the G2/M arrest in response to radiation and resulted in a transient diminishment of radiation-induced growth inhibition.  Conclusion:   We have shown a novel role of miR-106b, in the setting of radiation treatment, in regulating the p21-activated cell cycle arrest.

Their ability to identify men at high risk and the impact of increasing numbers of SNPs on predictive performance are not well understood.  Methods:   Absolute risk for PCa was estimated in a population-based case-control study in Sweden (2,899 cases and 1,722 controls) using family history and three sets of sequentially discovered PCa risk-associated SNPs. Their performance in predicting PCa was assessed by positive predictive values (PPV) and sensitivity.  Results:   SNPs and family history were able to differentiate individual risk for PCa and identify men at higher risk; ∼18% and ∼8% of men in the study had 20-year (55-74 years) absolute risks that were twofold (0.24) or threefold (0.36) greater than the population median risk (0.12), respectively. When predictive performances were compared at absolute risk cutoffs of 0.12, 0.24, or 0.36, PPV increased considerably (∼20%, ∼30%, and ∼37%, respectively) while sensitivity decreased considerably (∼55%, ∼20%, and ∼10%, respectively). In contrast, when increasing numbers of SNPs (5, 11, and 28 SNPs) were used in risk prediction, PPV approached a constant value while sensitivity increased steadily.

Considering the potential great medical and social relevance of this discovery, we investigated whether this finding could be confirmed in an independent group of Dutch sporadic PrCa cases.  Methods:   We investigated the occurrence of XMRV in fresh-frozen PrCa specimens of 74 PrCa patients from The Netherlands. Total RNA and DNA were isolated, subjected to cDNA synthesis, and analyzed by real-time PCR targeting conserved XMRV sequences.  Results:   Spiking experiments showed that we were able to detect at least 10 copies of XMRV sequences in 100,000 cells by real-time PCR, demonstrating high sensitivity of the assay. XMRV sequences were detected in 3 out of 74 (i.e., 4%) PrCa specimens. The number of XMRV containing cells was extremely low (1 in 600-7,000 cells). This was corroborated by the fact that XMRV could not be detected in consecutive tissue sections of the initial XMRV-positive cases.  Conclusions:   XMRV was rarely detected, and at extremely low levels, in sporadic PrCa samples from Dutch patients. When XMRV would play a causal role in prostate carcinogenesis, integration of the provirus could be expected to be present in, at least, a proportion of tumor cells. Therefore, our data do not support the claim that there is an association between XMRV infection and PrCa in Dutch PrCa patients.""","""['Gerald W Verhaegh', 'Arjan S de Jong', 'Frank P Smit', 'Sander A Jannink', 'Willem J G Melchers', 'Jack A Schalken']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prevalence of human gammaretrovirus XMRV in sporadic prostate cancer.', 'Prevalence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus infection in different risk populations in Spain.', 'Seroprevalence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in normal and retrovirus-infected blood donors.', 'Distribution of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) infection in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'Lack of evidence for a role of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and/or chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'The differential presence of human polyomaviruses, JCPyV and BKPyV, in prostate cancer and benign prostate hypertrophy tissues.', 'Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-Related Virus (XMRV) and the Safety of the Blood Supply.', 'No detection of the retrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in individuals with hemophilia.', 'No association between XMRV or related gammaretroviruses in Australian prostate cancer patients.', 'XMRV induces cell migration, cytokine expression and tumor angiogenesis: are 22Rv1 cells a suitable prostate cancer model?']"""

Although previous studies indicate that human breast cancers and a murine PCa model develop more slowly in murine hosts homozygous for a missense mutation in the GH-releasing hormone receptor (lit/lit) whose ""little"" dwarfed phenotype is caused by suppressed GH and IGF-I production, the role of these two hormones remains controversial.  Methods:   To assess how the GH/IGF-I axis influences androgen-responsive, castration-resistant (CR), and androgen-independent (AI) growth of human PCa, we compared xenograft growth of the androgen-responsive human PCa cells, LNCaP, and AI human PCa cells, PC3, in intact and castrate Nod/SCID lit/lit and lit/+ mice, and in vitro growth of these cell lines in lit/lit and lit/+ serum-containing media supplemented with GH or IGF-I.  Results:   Tumor growth and PSA accumulation rates were suppressed in LNCaP tumor-bearing lit/lit mice pre- and post-castration. Growth of PC3 xenografts in lit/lit mice was also suppressed. In vitro proliferation of LNCaP and PC3 cells cultured in media containing lit/lit mouse serum was decreased as compared to growth in media containing lit/+ serum. Suppressed growth in lit/lit serum could be restored by the addition of IGF-I, and to a lesser extent, GH. Differences in growth correlated with differences in steady-state AKT and ERK1/2 activation.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that circulating GH and IGF-I can promote androgen-responsive growth, CR progression, and AI expansion of PTEN-deficient human PCa cell xenografts and indicates that IGF-I can promote PCa growth in a suppressed GH environment.""","""['Kiyoshi Takahara', 'Howard Tearle', 'Mazyar Ghaffari', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Michael Pollak', 'Michael E Cox']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['In vivo progression of LAPC-9 and LNCaP prostate cancer models to androgen independence is associated with increased expression of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR).', 'Increased insulin-like growth factor I receptor expression and signaling are components of androgen-independent progression in a lineage-derived prostate cancer progression model.', 'Reduced growth of human breast cancer xenografts in hosts homozygous for the lit mutation.', 'Hormone refractory prostate cancer: Lessons learned from the PTEN prostate cancer model.', 'Apoptosis in prostate cancer.

Despite the almost inevitable development of resistance in prostate tumors to AR antagonists, no new AR antagonists have been approved for over a decade. Treatment failure is due in part to mutations that increase activity of AR in response to lower ligand concentrations as well as to mutations that result in AR response to a broader range of ligands. The failure to discover new AR antagonists has occurred in the face of continued research; to enable progress, a clear understanding of the reasons for failure is required.  Methods:   Non-clinical drug safety studies and safety pharmacology assays were performed on previously approved AR antagonists (bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide), next generation antagonists in clinical testing (MDV3100, BMS-641988), and a pre-clinical drug candidate (BMS-501949). In addition, non-clinical studies with AR mutant mice, and EEG recordings in rats were performed. Non-clinical findings are compared to disclosures of clinical trial results.  Results:   As a drug class, AR antagonists cause seizure in animals by an off-target mechanism and are found in vitro to inhibit GABA-A currents. Clinical trials of candidate next generation AR antagonists identify seizure as a clinical safety risk.  Conclusions:   Non-clinical drug safety profiles of the AR antagonist drug class create a significant barrier to the identification of next generation AR antagonists. GABA-A inhibition is a common off-target activity of approved and next generation AR antagonists potentially explaining some side effects and safety hazards of this class of drugs.""","""['William R Foster', 'Bruce D Car', 'Hong Shi', 'Paul C Levesque', 'Mary T Obermeier', 'Jinping Gan', 'Joseph C Arezzo', 'Stephanie S Powlin', 'Joseph E Dinchuk', 'Aaron Balog', 'Mark E Salvati', 'Ricardo M Attar', 'Marco M Gottardis']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Drug insight: role of the androgen receptor in the development and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer cells increase androgen sensitivity by increase in nuclear androgen receptor and androgen receptor coactivators; a possible mechanism of hormone-resistance of prostate cancer cells.', 'Discovery and mechanistic characterization of a novel selective nuclear androgen receptor exporter for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Switch from antagonist to agonist of the androgen receptor bicalutamide is associated with prostate tumour progression in a new model system.', 'Androgen receptor: role and novel therapeutic prospects in prostate cancer.', 'Elevated labile iron in castration-resistant prostate cancer is targetable with ferrous iron-activatable antiandrogen therapy.', 'A novel inhibitor of ARfl and ARv7 induces protein degradation to overcome enzalutamide resistance in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonists and challenges in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Neurocognitive impairment associated with traditional and novel androgen receptor signaling inhibitors\u2009±\u2009androgen deprivation therapy: a pharmacovigilance study.', 'Activity and safety of SHR3680, a novel antiandrogen, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a phase I/II trial.']"""

More information about AR distribution is needed to optimize evaluation methods and to better understand the role of AR in development and progression of prostate cancer.  Methods:   A tissue microarray was constructed from 119 hormone-naïve nodal positive, surgically treated prostate cancers containing tissues from all GP present in every primary tumor and the matched metastases. ARs were evaluated immunohistochemically and an expression score (intensity × percentage of positive cells) was assigned for each tissue spot.  Results:   ARs were up-regulated in primary tumors compared to normal glands and significantly different expressed in the GP (mean AR scores: GP 3=128.7, GP 4=159.1, GP 5=123.5; P=0.016). A similar expression profile was observed in metastases, however, on significantly (P<0.001) lower level (mean AR scores: GP 3=70.5, GP 4=90.4, GP 5=71.7; P=0.114). High AR expression in metastases was associated with larger total size of metastases (P=0.008). All other correlations of AR expression in primary tumors and metastases with quantitative (age, prostate cancer volume, number of metastases) or categorical (tumor stage, Gleason score of the primary tumor and metastases) tumor characteristics or with survival were insignificant.  Conclusion:   ARs are differentially expressed in GP what should be considered in prognostic models which include AR. In nodal metastases, ARs are significantly down-regulated suggesting decreased dependence on androgens already under hormone-naïve conditions.

Methods:   We conducted 16 diagnosis- and sex-specific focus groups with patients recruited from the Duke University tumor registry and oncology/hematology clinics (N=109). A trained note taker produced field notes summarizing the discussions. An independent auditor verified field notes against written transcripts. The content of the discussions was analyzed for major themes by two independent coders.  Results:   Across all cancers, the most commonly discussed cancer- or treatment-related effects on sexual functioning and intimacy were fatigue, treatment-related hair loss, weight gain and organ loss or scarring. Additional barriers were unique to particular diagnoses, such as shortness of breath in lung cancer, gastrointestinal problems in colorectal cancers and incontinence in prostate cancer. Sexual functioning and intimacy were considered important to quality of life. While most effects of cancer were considered negative, many participants identified improvements to intimacy after cancer.  Conclusion:   Overall evaluations of satisfaction with sex life did not always correspond to specific aspects of functioning (e.g. erectile dysfunction), presenting a challenge to researchers aiming to measure sexual functioning as an outcome.

Method:   Eighty-one couples were interviewed at the time of diagnosis; 69 participated at 3 months and 61 at 12 months. Paired t-tests were used to examine dyadic congruence on seven domains of psychosocial adjustment. Repeated Measures ANOVAs were used to examine the congruence over time. Multiple regressions were used to determine whether mood disturbance, urinary and sexual bother, sense of coherence, and social support were predictors of congruence within couples on each of the adjustment domains.  Results:   At time 1, couples had incongruent perceptions in 3 of 7 domains: health care, psychological, and social adjustment. Three months later, health care, psychological, and sexual domains showed incongruence within couples. One year after the diagnosis, there were incongruent perceptions only in sexual and psychological domains. There was little variation of the congruence within couples over time. Husbands and wives' mood disturbance, urinary and sexual bother, sense of coherence, and social support accounted for 25-63% of variance in couple congruence in the adjustment domains in the study periods.

We transfected the AR gene with a point mutation at codon 741 (tryptophan to leucine; W741L) into human androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 cells lacking the expression of AR, and established PC3 cells overexpressing mutant type AR (PC3/W741L). Changes in the phenotype in these cells were compared to those in PC3 cells transfected with wild- type AR (PC3/Wild) and control vector alone (PC3/Co). There was no significant differences in the growth among PC3/Co, PC3/Wild and PC3/W741L cells. A transactivation assay using these cells showed that bicalutamide activated W741L mutant type AR, but not wild-type AR, while hydroxyflutamide failed to activate either type of ARs. Treatment with specific inhibitors of the MAPK or STST3 pathway (UO126 or AG490, respectively), in contrast to treatment with the Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002, significantly inhibited the dihydrotestosterone-induced activation of both wild-type and mutant ARs; however, activation of W741L mutant AR by bicalutamide was significantly inhibited by treatment with UO126, in contrast to treatment with AG490 or LY294002.

Immunohistochemical study of SSTR2a was performed on 95 prostate carcinoma cases, and the results showed expression of SSTR2a in 14 of the 95 cases (14.74%); the histological grade (Gleason) and capsular invasion of the prostate carcinoma were directly related to SSTR2a expression. Among the ten cases of lymph node metastasis, SSTR2a expression was markedly higher. In vitro studies were performed using SSTR2a-positive prostate cancer cells, DU145 and PC3. Migration and invasion abilities of DU145 and PC3 cells were inhibited by SA in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was reversed by Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Morphological changes of the prostate cancer cells treated with SA and Y27632 corroborate the migration and invasion assays, although SA had no effect on proliferation of DU145 and PC3 cells.

Methods:   We studied 2208 parents and siblings of 504 unselected population-based Caucasian women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 35 years (103 from USA, 124 from Canada and 277 from Australia), 41 known to carry a mutation (24 in BRCA1, 16 in BRCA2 and one in both genes). Cancer-specific standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated by comparing the number of affected relatives (50% verified overall) with that expected based on incidences specific for country, sex, age and year of birth.  Results:   For relatives of carriers, the female breast cancer SIRs were 13.13 (95% CI 6.57-26.26) and 12.52 (5.21-30.07) for BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. The ovarian cancer SIR was 12.38 (3.1-49.51) for BRCA1 and the prostate cancer SIR was 18.55 (4.64-74.17) for BRCA2.

We describe here a novel mechanism of tumor progression by matrix degradation involving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in response to membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) induction at the edge of tumors expressing the FGFR4-R388 risk variant. Both FGFR4 and MT1-MMP were upregulated in tissue biopsies from several human cancer types including breast adenocarcinomas, where they were partially coexpressed at the tumor/stroma border and tumor invasion front. The strongest overall coexpression was found in prostate carcinoma. Studies with cultured prostate carcinoma cell lines showed that the FGFR4-R388 variant, which has previously been associated with poor cancer prognosis, increased MT1-MMP-dependent collagen invasion. In this experimental model, knockdown of FGFR4-R388 or MT1-MMP by RNA interference blocked tumor cell invasion and growth in collagen. This was coupled with impaired phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 and Src, upregulation of E-cadherin, and suppression of cadherin-11 and N-cadherin. These in vitro results were substantiated by reduced MT1-MMP content and in vivo growth of prostate carcinoma cells after the FGFR4-R388 gene silencing. In contrast, knockdown of the alternative FGFR4-G388 allele enhanced MT1-MMP and invasive tumor cell growth in vivo and within three-dimensional collagen.

Downregulation of endogenous RasGRP3 in PC-3 and DU 145 cells reduced Ras-GTP formation, inhibited cell proliferation, impeded cell migration, and induced apoptosis. Anchorage-independent growth of the PC-3 cells and tumor formation in mouse xenografts of both cell lines were likewise inhibited. Inhibition of RasGRP3 expression reduced AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and sensitized the cells to killing by carboplatin. Conversely, exogenous RasGRP3 elevated Ras-GTP, stimulated proliferation, and provided resistance to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. RasGRP3-overexpressing LNCaP cells displayed a markedly enhanced rate of xenograft tumor formation in both male and female mice compared with the parental line. Suppression of RasGRP3 expression in these cells inhibited downstream RasGRP3 responses, caused the cells to resume the LNCaP morphology, and suppressed growth, confirming the functional role of RasGRP3 in the altered behavior of these cells.

In the current report, we provide evidence that this activation has a more profound role. Using a mass spectrometry-based phospholipid analysis approach, we show that clinical tumor tissues that display the lipogenic phenotype show an increase in the degree of lipid saturation compared with nonlipogenic tumors. Reversal of the lipogenic switch in cancer cells by treatment with the lipogenesis inhibitor soraphen A or by targeting lipogenic enzymes with small interfering RNA leads to a marked decrease in saturated and mono-unsaturated phospholipid species and increases the relative degree of polyunsaturation. Because polyunsaturated acyl chains are more susceptible to peroxidation, inhibition of lipogenesis increases the levels of peroxidation end products and renders cells more susceptible to oxidative stress-induced cell death. As saturated lipids pack more densely, modulation of lipogenesis also alters lateral and transversal membrane dynamics as revealed by diffusion of membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein and by the uptake and response to doxorubicin. These data show that shifting lipid acquisition from lipid uptake toward de novo lipogenesis dramatically changes membrane properties and protects cells from both endogenous and exogenous insults.

BIM-23244 (sstr₂-sstr₅ selective agonist) significantly increased the co-immunoprecipitation of sstr₂/sstr₅, and induced a -41.36% inhibition of proliferation. BIM-23A760, a new somatostatin/DA chimeric agonist with a high affinity for sstr₂ and D₂R and a moderate affinity for sstr₅, significantly increased the sstr₅/D₂R and sstr₂/D₂R complexes and was the most powerful in inhibiting proliferation (-42.30%). The chimeric compound was also the most efficient in modulating receptor interaction in Calu-6, increasing the co-immunoprecipitation of D₂R/sstr₅ and inhibiting cell proliferation (-30.54%). However, behind BIM-23A760, BIM-53097 (D₂R-preferential compound) also significantly inhibited Calu-6 proliferation (-17.71%), suggesting a key role for D₂R in receptor cross talk and in controlling cell growth. Indeed, activation of monomeric receptors did not affect receptor co-immunoprecipitation, whereas cell proliferation was significantly inhibited when the receptors were synergistically activated. In conclusion, our data show a dynamic ligand-induced somatostatin and DA receptor interaction, which may be crucial for the antiproliferative effects of the new analogues.""","""['M Arvigo', 'F Gatto', 'M Ruscica', 'P Ameri', 'E Dozio', 'M Albertelli', 'M D Culler', 'M Motta', 'F Minuto', 'P Magni', 'D Ferone']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""J Endocrinol""","""['Efficacy of a dopamine-somatostatin chimeric molecule, BIM-23A760, in the control of cell growth from primary cultures of human non-functioning pituitary adenomas: a multi-center study.', 'Somatostatin and dopamine receptor expression in lung carcinoma cells and effects of chimeric somatostatin-dopamine molecules on cell proliferation.', 'The dopamine-somatostatin chimeric compound BIM-23A760 exerts antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in human non-functioning pituitary tumors by activating ERK1/2 and p38 pathways.', 'The role of somatostatin and dopamine D2 receptors in endocrine tumors.', 'Relevance of coexpression of somatostatin and dopamine D2 receptors in pituitary adenomas.', 'Somatostatin Analogue Treatment Primarily Induce miRNA Expression Changes and Up-Regulates Growth Inhibitory miR-7 and miR-148a in Neuroendocrine Cells.', 'Repositioning Dopamine D2 Receptor Agonist Bromocriptine to Enhance Docetaxel Chemotherapy and Treat Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'BIM-23A760 influences key functional endpoints in pituitary adenomas and normal pituitaries: molecular mechanisms underlying the differential response in adenomas.', 'Could Somatostatin Enhance the Outcomes of Chemotherapeutic Treatment in SCLC?', 'Repurposing the antipsychotic trifluoperazine as an antimetastasis agent.']"""

The influence of TP53 codon 72, MDM2 SNP309, and MDM2 C1797G polymorphisms in southern Chinese PCa patients was investigated. In the comparison of genotype distributions of TP53 codon 72 between cases and controls, the adjusted odds ratios for PCa associated with the Pro/Pro, Arg/Pro, and Arg/Arg genotypes were 1.00, 1.89 (95% CI = 1.20-2.97), and 2.01 (95% CI = 1.11-3.64), respectively; however, MDM2 SNP309 and C1797G did not show any significant difference between cases and controls. When TP53 and MDM2 polymorphisms were combined based on the numbers of variant risk alleles (i.e., G-allele of TP53 codon 72, G-allele of MDM2 SNP309, and G-allele of MDM2 C1797G), individuals with 3-5 variants had a 1.56-fold greater risk of PCa than those with 0-2 variants (95% CI = 1.07-2.26). Moreover, subjects with 0-2 variants had 33.3% positive p53 expression, whereas subjects with 3-5 variants had 23.3% p53 expression (P = 0.39).

Methods:   We investigated the expression profiles of 6 microRNAs (let-7g, let-7d, miR-98, miR-96, miR-182 and miR-183) using the method of locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotide in situ hybridization (ISH) and the technology of tissue microarray (TMA) with the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens from 52 patients with PCa and 38 with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Then we analyzed the correlation among the expressions of the 6 microRNAs in PCa and their correlation with the Gleason score and clinical stages of PCa.  Results:   Compared with BPH, the PCa patients showed decreased expressions of miR-98, let-7d and let-7g, and decreased expressions of miR-96, miR-182 and miR-183, with statistically significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.05). The positive rate of the 6 microRNAs was significantly correlated with the Gleason grades of PCa (P < 0.05), but not with the age and serum PSA concentration of the patients (P > 0.05).

Over-expression of MUC1 has also been implicated in prostate cancer, but neither the role of MUC1 in the cancer progression nor the mucin O-glycosylation has been fully elucidated. In this study, we characterized the O-glycans on MUC1 when over-expressed in the human prostate cancer cell line C4-2B(4). We found that the main O-glycan consisted of the neutral core 2 oligosaccharide Galβ3(Galβ3/4GlcNAcβ6)GalNAc-ol, with minor components being fucosylated and sialylated variants of the same core 2 oligosaccharide. Small amounts of the shorter core 1 O-glycans were also detected.We then used the MUC1 over-expressing cell lines to study the effects of MUC1 on prostate cancer cell behavior. The results demonstrate that over-expression of MUC1 did not affect the cells' proliferation, but led to a decreased adhesion to the extracellular matrix components fibronectin and collagen I in vitro. When inoculated in BALB/c nude mice, C4-2B(4) cells expressing MUC1 showed a tendency to form fewer tumors than wt cells and the tumors also grew more slowly, but there was a large variation between different tumors.

However, once drug resistance develops, further chemotherapy is less effective. The objective of this study is to investigate the anti-proliferative activity of the phyto-active chemicals (PACs) oridonin and wogonin in chemo-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Primary cell cultures from the ascitic fluid of three patients at diagnosis, two patients chemo-resistant to carboplatin and paclitaxel, and one patient treated with letrozole for breast cancer were studied and compared to the ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and PTX10, by cell viability assay (MTS). Effects on cell cycle modulation and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis (WB). WB was further conducted to investigate protein expressions altered by PACs. The results show that IC(50) of the primary cultures ranged from 0.6 to 5.4 μg/ml for oridonin and 0.3-12.7 μg/ml for wogonin. The paclitaxel-resistant cell line PTX10 was more sensitive to each of the PACs than the chemo-sensitive cell line A2780. Of particular interest is that in combination, the two PACs were synergistic in their cytotoxicity to five of six of the primary cultures and to both the cell lines (combination indices of 0.39-0.95). The inhibition is attributable to apoptosis and cell cycle modulation induced by the PACs as demonstrated in A2780 and PTX10. Up-regulation of the functional p53 protein in A2780 and down-regulation of Akt protein in PTX10 have in part contributed to the apoptosis. These findings suggest that oridonin and wogonin may have activity in ovarian cancer following its development of resistance to carboplatin and paclitaxel.""","""['Sophie Chen', 'Matt Cooper', 'Matt Jones', 'Thumuluru Kavitha Madhuri', 'Julie Wade', 'Ashleigh Bachelor', 'Simon Butler-Manuel']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cell Biol Toxicol""","""['Oridonin effectively reverses cisplatin drug resistance in human ovarian cancer cells via induction of cell apoptosis and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase expression.', 'The cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of oridonin (Rubescenin), a diterpenoid from Rabdosia rubescens, on tumor cells of different lineage.', 'Impact of the putative cancer stem cell markers and growth factor receptor expression on the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to treatment with various forms of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and cytotoxic drugs.', 'Advances in the treatment of ovarian cancer: a potential role of antiinflammatory phytochemicals.', 'Molecular diagnosis and molecular profiling to detect treatment-resistant ovarian cancer.', 'Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and Their Natural Flavonoid Compounds in the Treatment of Ovarian Cancer: A Review.', 'Oridonin and its derivatives for cancer treatment and overcoming therapeutic resistance.', 'Wogonin Increases Cisplatin Sensitivity in Ovarian Cancer Cells Through Inhibition of the Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K)/Akt Pathway.', 'Therapy Effects of Wogonin on Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Advances of wogonin, an extract from Scutellaria baicalensis, for the treatment of multiple tumors.']"""

Two tumors from two unrelated families with known MMR mutations were MSI-high and one additional case from a third family was MSI-low. The remainder of the prostate cancer cases demonstrated no evidence of MSI. PCa incidence in families enriched for hereditary PCa with a history of Lynch Syndrome cancers is not strongly suggestive of the presence of an MMR mutation.

Morphological and histomorphological evaluation of this disease is a well established technique for the cancer classification and has remained relatively unchanged since several decades, although it remains a time consuming and subjective technique, with unsatisfactory levels of inter- and intra-observer discrepancy. Novel approaches for histological recognition are necessary to identify and to investigate cancer in detail. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging has become an essential tool for the detection, identification and characterization of the molecular components of biological processes, such as those responsible for the dynamic properties of cancer progression. Major advantage of this new technique is the acquisition of local molecular expression profiles while maintaining the topographic integrity of the tissue and avoiding time-consuming extraction, purification and separation steps. By using this method it is possible to investigate the spatial distribution of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, cholesterols, nucleic acids, phospholipids and small molecules within biological systems by in situ analysis of tissue sections. We applied this technique on prostate cancer patients radical prostatectomy specimens in order to develop new tools for histomorphological analysis and the characterization of snap frozen prostate cancer tissues. As a first step, an optimization of sample preparation, tissue section thickness and IR slide material was performed. Special preparation methods for FTIR imaging are the essential requirements to maintain the spatial arrangement of compounds and avoid delocalization and degradation of the analytes. Subsequently, selected cancer samples were characterized with the prior optimized parameters and analyzed by univariate and cluster analysis. For the interpretation and calibration of the system we correlated the FTIR-images with the histopathological information. With this method it is possible to distinguish between cancer and noncancer areas within a prostate cancer tissue with a resolution of 6.25 μm × 6.25 μm on frozen sections.""","""['Christine Pezzei', 'Johannes D Pallua', 'Georg Schaefer', 'Christof Seifarth', 'Verena Huck-Pezzei', 'Lukas K Bittner', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Georg Bartsch', 'Guenther K Bonn', 'Christian W Huck']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Biosyst""","""['Fourier transform infrared imaging analysis in discrimination studies of squamous cell carcinoma.', 'FTIR microspectroscopy for improved prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Infrared spectroscopic imaging for histopathologic recognition.', 'Histopathology of localized prostate cancer.

Guidelines for diagnosing and managing prostate cancer in the UK are set out by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2008). Diagnosis includes a number of elements, of which the Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) test is highly significant both in the diagnosis process and in monitoring patients following treatment. Ongoing monitoring of service provision within the outpatients' department highlighted an urgent need for improvements in the care received by prostate cancer patients. There is evidence (Department of Health (DH), 2007) to suggest that in undertaking initiatives aimed at improving service delivery and patient satisfaction, the skills of the multidisciplinary team are paramount (specifically the specialist nurse) in the provision of a nurse-led service. Over time, demands for nurse-led services have increased. In particular, telephone consultations have been shown to provide significant improvements in service delivery. A nurse-led PSA telephone follow-up clinic was developed and implemented in 2005 to increase efficiency within the uro-oncology outpatient clinic. Between August 2005 and March, 2009, a total of 67 patients were recruited into the clinic, 46 of which are still being followed-up at the time of writing.

Measuring and identifying issues of quality of life (QoL) may create an opportunity for the patient to discuss problems and induce information transfer from health professional to patient and vice versa. Many practitioners already assess QoL in patients with prostate cancer because treatment for the disease can have a dramatic impact on lifestyle. QoL may facilitate a more holistic approach to patient care. Using a QoL assessment tool may promote and enhance the current service provision and aid identification of bothersome side-effects, for example loss of libido, gynaecomastia (i.e. abnormal over-development of the breasts in a man), and hot flushes. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate scale (FACT-P) (Cella et al, 1993) is a prostate-specific QoL assessment tool, which can be self-administered and takes little time to complete. This may be a useful tool in the ongoing management of patients with advanced prostate cancer. With the emphasis on quality of service for cancer patients (Department of Health (DH), 2000; DH, 2007a; National Health Service Improvement, 2009), it is paramount that health professionals continually examine practice and the quality of the service delivered.

Using a chemical biology approach, it was determined that compounds, previously shown to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling, also inhibited the transcriptional activity of ERRα. The significance of this association was revealed in a series of biochemical and genetic experiments that show that (a) ERRα, β-catenin (β-cat), and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 form macromolecular complexes in cells, (b) ERRα transcriptional activity is enhanced by β-cat expression and vice versa, and (c) there is a high level of overlap among genes previously shown to be regulated by ERRα or β-cat. Furthermore, silencing of ERRα and β-cat expression individually or together dramatically reduced the migratory capacity of breast, prostate, and colon cancer cells in vitro. This increased migration could be attributed to the ERRα/β-cat-dependent induction of WNT11.

Among these prostate specific antigen is widely acknowledged to be the simplest and routine clinical parameter the purpose of this study is to reveal the contribution of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the diagnosis and tracking of prostate cancer compared to the PSA density (PSAD). 182 unrelated Tunisian men divided in two groups were considered by this study. The first, formed of 116 patients, comprised 91 subjects with a prostate benign hyperplasia (HBP) and 25 patients developing a prostate cancer (CaP). The second included 66 men without symptomatology of prostate pathologies. The serum prostate specific antigen values are measured in all the cases by immunoenzymatic method. However, the clinical characteristics of all subjects of the first group were determined by recourse to Gleason score, digital rectal examination and prostate echography. Nevertheless, those of the second group were given just for 7 subjects with PSA>4 ng/mL by making a biopsy. The present study shows, on the one hand, a clear correlation between PSA level and prostate pathology frequencies in a Tunisian population, on the other, it demonstrates a considerable relationship between the pathologic PSA level and patient age especially in the 7th decade. Besides, it points out to the contribution of additional parameters essentially the PSAD. PSA measurement can be considered as a reliable tool for early detection, staging, and monitoring of prostate cancer in elderly men even in the absence of clinical signs only for remarkable high levels (>20 ng/mL). Conversely, it cannot be in case of moderate levels (4≤PSA≥20 ng/mL) from where, the need of its combination to other complementary parameters specifically the PSAD which is very beneficial for early diagnosis of the prostate cancer. In fact, when compared to the result of pathological analysis of prostate biopsies, sensibility, specificity, diagnostic efficacy, positive and negative predictive values and the like hood ratio of total PSA were respectively, 100%, 71%, 77%, 0.49, 1.0 and 2.5; those of PSA density respectively 100%, 92%, 95%, 0.86, 1.0 and 12.25.""","""['Souiden Yousra', 'Elkamel Rafik', 'Mahdouani Manel', 'Mahdouani Kacem']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ann Biol Clin (Paris)""","""['Early diagnosis of prostate carcinoma with reference to the density of prostate-specific antigen.', 'Usefulness and predictive value of PSA density, adjusted by transition zone volume, in men with PSA levels between 2 and 4 ng/ml.', 'Prostate specific antigen density of the transition zone for early detection of prostate cancer.', 'The incidence of the variability of the free PSA/total PSA ratio on the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Additional aids in detection of prostate carcinomas?

Materials and methods:   A 71-year-old patient was evaluated for a 2 year history of painless hematuria and found to have a localized Skene's gland adenocarcinoma resembling prostate adenocarcinoma with a pre-therapy PSA of 54.52 ng/ul. She elected to undergo definitive radiotherapy holding radical surgery for salvage. She received 73.8 Gy of intensity modulated radiotherapy in 41 fractions. Serum PSA, imaging, and cystoscopy were followed at 6 month intervals for 2.5 years.  Results:   The PSA decreased to 0.65 ng/ul 32 months after treatment, her clinical symptoms resolved, and on imaging and exam she has no evidence of residual disease. The PSA half life was 6.16 months (r(2) = 0.97).  Conclusions:   For this rare tumor we show that PSA is a reliable marker for disease response and also show that definitive radiotherapy can be an option for organ and functional preservation in patients with localized disease.

Furthermore, tumor characteristics were analyzed to define the relationship, if any, with benign prostatic hyperplasia/benign prostatic enlargement.  Results:   For bladder urothelial tumors, the percentage of carcinoma increased significantly with increasing age (P < 0.001), and differences were found among 3 age groups in the distribution of high grade carcinoma (P = 0.012).

Despite being a strong indicator of poor prognosis, there have been few large studies investigating the impact of extent of prostatic stromal invasion on patient outcome. A search of the surgical pathology and expert consultation files at our institution was made for cystoprostatectomy specimens diagnosed as urothelial carcinoma with prostatic stromal invasion from 2002 to 2009. Cases were further stratified as follows: group 1--focal prostatic stromal invasion and group 2--extensive prostatic stromal invasion. Only patients who had surgery as monotherapy and those with available follow-up information were selected for this study. Thirty-five cases of urothelial carcinoma with prostatic stromal invasion and follow-up information were identified. Mean patient age was 70 years (range, 44-88 years). Of these 35 patients, 15 (43%) had focal prostatic stromal invasion and 20 (57%) had extensive prostatic stromal invasion. Angiolymphatic invasion was identified in 93% of group 1 cases and 79% of group 2 cases. Positive margins were identified in 50% of group 1 cases and 45% of group 2 cases. Incidence of nodal metastasis was 64% for group 1 and 60% for group 2. Four (27%) of 15 cases in group 1 and 6 (30%) of 20 cases in group 2 had various histologic variants identified. In group 1, there were 2 cases of urothelial carcinoma with micropapillary features and urothelial carcinoma with focal squamous differentiation. In group 2, there were 3 cases of urothelial carcinoma with focal squamous differentiation, 2 cases of urothelial carcinoma with focal sarcomatoid differentiation, and 1 case of urothelial carcinoma with focal micropapillary features. One- and 3-year overall survival for group 1 was 53% and 27%, respectively. One- and 3-year overall survival for group 2 was 47% and 12%, respectively. Mean survival was 17.4 and 16.3 months for groups 1 and 2, respectively. Overall survival curves did not show a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups from initial diagnosis (P = .889) and radical cystoprostatectomy (P = .369). Our study suggests that extent of prostatic stromal invasion by urothelial carcinoma of the bladder as an independent factor does not impact overall patient survival. Other well-known prognostic factors including positive margin status, presence of aggressive histologic variants of urothelial carcinoma, angiolymphatic invasion, and distant metastasis likely play more critical roles in predicting outcome in male patients who have urothelial carcinoma with prostatic stromal invasion.""","""['Irma V Oliva', 'Stacey L Smith', 'Zhengjia Chen', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Validation of new AJCC exclusion criteria for subepithelial prostatic stromal invasion from pT4a bladder urothelial carcinoma.', 'Utility of p63 and high molecular weight cytokeratin in the distinction between urothelial carcinoma with prostatic stromal invasion and urothelial carcinoma with colonisation of prostatic ducts and acini.', 'Transitional cell carcinoma involving the prostate with a proposed staging classification for stromal invasion.', 'Urothelial carcinoma in the prostatic urethra and prostate: current controversies.', 'Pathology of the prostate in radical cystectomy specimens: a critical review.', 'Double cocktail immunostains with high molecular weight cytokeratin and GATA-3: useful stain to discriminate in situ involvement of prostatic ducts or acini from stromal invasion by urothelial carcinoma in the prostate.', 'Clinical outcomes of urothelial carcinoma of the prostate detected in radical cystectomy specimens.']"""

GRPr are expressed in high numbers on specific human cancers, including human prostate cancer. Therefore, copper-64 ((64)Cu) radiolabeled BBN(7-14)NH(2) conjugates could have potential for diagnosis of human prostate cancer via positron-emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to produce [(64)Cu-NO2A-(X)-BBN(7-14)NH(2)] conjugates for prostate cancer imaging, where X=pharmacokinetic modifier (beta-alanine, 5-aminovaleric acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, 9-aminonanoic acid or para-aminobenzoic acid) and NO2A=1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid [a derivative of NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid)].  Methods:   [(X)-BBN(7-14)NH(2)] Conjugates were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), after which NOTA was added via manual conjugation. The new peptide conjugates were radiolabeled with (64)Cu radionuclide. The receptor-binding affinity was determined in human prostate PC-3 cells, and tumor-targeting efficacy was determined in PC-3 tumor-bearing severely combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Whole-body maximum intensity microPET/CT images of PC-3 tumor-bearing SCID mice were obtained 18 h postinjection (pi).  Results:   Competitive binding assays in PC-3 cells indicated high receptor-binding affinity for the [NO2A-(X)-BBN(7-14)NH(2)] and [(nat)Cu-NO2A-(X)-BBN(7-14)NH(2)] conjugates. In vivo biodistribution studies of the [(64)Cu-NO2A-(X)-BBN(7-14)NH(2)] conjugates at 1, 4 and 24 h pi showed very high uptake of the tracer in GRPr-positive tissue with little accumulation and retention in nontarget tissues. High-quality, high-contrast microPET images were obtained, with xenografted tumors being clearly visible at 18 h pi.  Conclusions:   NO2A chelator sufficiently stabilizes copper(II) radiometal under in vivo conditions, producing conjugates with very high uptake and retention in targeted GRPr.

A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PEBP1 with high specificity and affinity was generated and characterized using ELISA, western blot analysis, immunofluorescent staining and immunohistochemical staining. PEBP1 expression in normal 293 cells and a few pancreatic cancer cell lines was detected with mAb 7F12 in western blot analysis. To screen for a pair of mAbs with optimal binding affinity to soluble PEBP1, ForteBio's Octet system was used. Sandwich ELISA with mAb pair 4F10 and 8E2 showed a linear correlation between absorbance and PEBP1 protein concentration over a range of 7 to 100 ng/ml. MAb 4A11 detected a high level expression of PEBP1 in normal pancreatic tissue, and cancer adjacent normal pancreatic tissue in a pancreatic tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 80 human tissue cores. Pancreatic cancer tissues show a no or very weak staining intensity of PEBP1. In 69 valid cases, PEBP1 expression was significantly lower in tumor than in normal pancreas (p=8.40E-14) and adjacent normal tissue (p=8.46E-17). PEBP1 expression in pancreatic cancer was not associated with pTMN stage, differentiation grade and pathologic diagnosis.

Objective:   To evaluate oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing RARP at a high-volume tertiary center, with a focus on 5-yr biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS).  Design, setting, and participants:   The study cohort consisted of 1384 consecutive patients with localized PCa who underwent RARP between September 2001 and May 2005 and had a median follow-up of 60.2 mo. No patient had secondary therapy until documented biochemical recurrence (BCR). BCR was defined as a serum prostate-specific antigen ≥ 0.2 ng/ml with a confirmatory value. BCRFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Event-time distributions for the time to failure were compared using the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine variables predictive of BCR.  Intervention:   All patients underwent RARP.  Measurements:   BCRFS rates were measured.  Results and limitations:   This cohort of patients had moderately aggressive PCa: 49.0% were D'Amico intermediate or high risk on biopsy; however, 60.9% had Gleason 7-10 disease, and 25.5% had ≥ T3 disease on final pathology.

Methods:   Between 2003 and 2008, 300 patients with PCa were treated with BT using (125)I stranded seeds, of whom 86 received 3-month NHT to downsize the prostate before treatment. Urinary complaints were measured on all occasions with the International Prostate Symptom Score (n = 134) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire PR25 (EORTC-QLQ-PR25 questionnaire; n = 118) and HRQL with the EORTC-QLQ-C30 (n = 120) questionnaire.  Results:   Post-BT, urinary function became worse over the first 6 weeks and then improved steadily, but did not return to baseline levels at 1 year. At baseline, the NHT group reported worse urinary function compared with the non-NHT group (P < .01). However, the post-BT improvement of urinary function was better in the NHT group at 3 months (P < .05). Global HRQL, physical, role and social functioning decreased over the first 3 months (P < .05) post-BT but returned to baseline levels within 1 year. Emotional function steadily improved over the 1-year follow-up period (P < .001). The NHT group reported better global HRQL, social and emotional functioning 1 year post-BT compared with baseline (P < 05). All results were adjusted for comorbidity. This is a single-center study with a follow-up of 1 year, thereby potentially limiting the general applicability of the results.  Conclusions:   Three months of NHT before BT might positively influence urinary function and HRQL up to 1 year post-BT. Therefore, PCa patients should not be dissuaded from considering NHT followed by BT because of prostate size.""","""['Judith Evers', 'Nina Kupper', 'Dionne Kessing', 'Rob Davits', 'Antoine Engelen', 'Philip Poortmans', 'Floortje Mols']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Association of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy with adverse health-related quality of life after permanent iodine-125 brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Bicalutamide alone prior to brachytherapy achieves cytoreduction that is similar to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues with less patient-reported morbidity.', 'Salvage therapy with bicalutamide 150 mg in nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'First line therapy in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Hormonal treatment of cancer of the prostate: review and present status.', 'Ten-year longitudinal health-related quality of life following iodine-125 brachytherapy monotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'A comparative study on the efficacies of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and GnRH antagonist in neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy combined with transperineal prostate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy leads to immediate impairment of vitality/hormonal and sexual quality of life: results of a multicenter prospective study.']"""

We have recently demonstrated the activation of Akt by OPN. Integrin-linked kinase and PI3-kinase are integral proteins in OPN/AKT pathway in PC3 cells. To investigate the role of the extracellular receptors in OPN signaling, we have examined the spatio-temporal regulation of CD44 and integrin αvβ3 receptor in OPN-induced Akt activation in PC3 cells.  Results:   Here, our studies demonstrate that OPN can activate Akt either through the αVβ3 integrin or the CD44 cell surface receptor. Members of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) family have been shown to be up-regulated in a variety of human cancers and have been implicated in the metastatic behavior. Our studies have demonstrated an increase in the phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser259 and Ser338 in PC3 cells over-expressing OPN. This increase matches up with the Erk1/2 phosphorylation at Thr202/204 and activation. However, the inhibition of Akt activity augments the phosphorylation state of ERK1/2 to two to three fold with a concomitant reduction in the phosphorylation state of c-Raf at Ser259.  Conclusions:   Regulation c-Raf phosphorylation at Ser259 has a role in the anti-apoptotic pathways mediated by Akt or Raf/MEK/ERK proteins. OPN may have dual effects in the activation of Erk1/2. We propose this based on the observations that while OPN activates c-Raf and Erk1/2; it also acts to inhibit c-Raf and Erk1/2 activation through Akt pathway. Our observations suggest that the activation of c-Raf-ERK cascade may promote cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells and OPN signaling has a role in the anti-apoptotic mechanism.""","""['Brian W Robertson', 'Lauren Bonsal', 'Meenakshi A Chellaiah']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Osteopontin induces AP-1-mediated secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator through c-Src-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation in breast cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms of osteopontin and CD44 as metastatic principles in prostate cancer cells.', 'AKT upregulates B-Raf Ser445 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation in prostate cancer cells in response to androgen depletion.', ""Osteopontin: it's role in regulation of cell motility and nuclear factor kappa B-mediated urokinase type plasminogen activator expression."", 'ERK1/2 MAP kinases: structure, function, and regulation.', 'Thrombin Cleavage of Osteopontin and the Host Anti-Tumor Immune Response.', 'The Intracellular and Secreted Sides of Osteopontin and Their Putative Physiopathological Roles.', 'The Role of Osteopontin in Tumor Progression Through Tumor-Associated Macrophages.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Cancer-associated mesothelial cells promote ovarian cancer chemoresistance through paracrine osteopontin signaling.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed the transcriptome of human LNCaP prostate cancer cells as they progress to CRPC in vivo using replicate LongSAGE libraries. We refer to these libraries as the LNCaP atlas and compared these gene expression profiles with current suggested models of CRPC.  Results:   Three million tags were sequenced using in vivo samples at various stages of hormonal progression to reveal 96 novel genes differentially expressed in CRPC. Thirty-one genes encode proteins that are either secreted or are located at the plasma membrane, 21 genes changed levels of expression in response to androgen, and 8 genes have enriched expression in the prostate. Expression of 26, 6, 12, and 15 genes have previously been linked to prostate cancer, Gleason grade, progression, and metastasis, respectively. Expression profiles of genes in CRPC support a role for the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (CCNH, CUEDC2, FLNA, PSMA7), steroid synthesis and metabolism (DHCR24, DHRS7, ELOVL5, HSD17B4, OPRK1), neuroendocrine (ENO2, MAOA, OPRK1, S100A10, TRPM8), and proliferation (GAS5, GNB2L1, MT-ND3, NKX3-1, PCGEM1, PTGFR, STEAP1, TMEM30A), but neither supported nor discounted a role for cell survival genes.

Transection of the deep dorsal vein complex remains among the most challenging aspects, however. Safe and secure completion of this procedure is important to minimize blood loss and maximize the chance of cure. Liberal use of coagulation for hemostasis at the dorsal vein complex (DVC) risks thermal damage to the sphincteric muscle. DVC ligation before transection, though commonly performed, can cause loss of some sphincteric fibers and potentially result in delayed recovery of urinary continence. Furthermore, ligation may at times prove difficult, especially in obese patients with a short and broad DVC, a large prostate gland, and a narrow pelvis. The presence of prominent pubic tubercles may further increase the difficulty. We have found that bleeding from the DVC is easily controlled without suture ligation through a combination of a modest pneumoperitoneum with pinpoint coagulation of one or two small arteries that are consistently found in the superficial layer of the complex. Precise, even-level transection is possible under direct vision with no more than modest blood loss. A stitch in a Z-shaped fashion is then applied to the entire transected stump of the DVC. This procedure is simple and easily performed, even by those with limited experience.

Herein, we extend this canine work to show that the selenium dose that minimizes prostatic DNA damage also maximizes apoptosis-a cancer-suppressing death switch used by prostatic epithelial cells. These provocative findings suggest a new line of thinking about how selenium can reduce cancer risk. Mid-range selenium status (.67-.92 ppm in toenails) favors a process we call ""homeostatic housecleaning""-an upregulated apoptosis that preferentially purges damaged prostatic cells. Also, the U-shaped relationship provides valuable insight into stratifying individuals as selenium-responsive or selenium-refractory, based upon the likelihood of reducing their cancer risk by additional selenium. By studying elderly dogs, the only non-human animal model of spontaneous prostate cancer, we have established a robust experimental approach bridging the gap between laboratory and human studies that can help to define the optimal doses of cancer preventives for large-scale human trials.
