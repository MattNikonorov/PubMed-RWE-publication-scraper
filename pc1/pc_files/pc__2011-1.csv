Emerging evidence indicates that miR-143 plays causal roles in cancer tumorigenesis as a tumor suppress gene; however, its role in prostate cancer tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. The aims of this study were to verify the effect of miR-143 on proliferation and migration abilities of prostate cancer cells. The expression level of miR-143 and its target gene KRAS were measured by realtime PCR and western blotting, respectively. Effects of miR-143 in cell proliferation, migration and chemosensitivity were evaluated by MTT assay, FACS cell cycle analysis, colony formation assay, and transwell migratory assay. Our results revealed an inverse correlation of expression between miR-143 and KRAS protein in prostate cancer samples (Pearson's correlation scatter plots: R = -0.707, P < 0.05). Moreover, over-expression of miR-143 in prostate cancer cells suppressed their proliferation and migration and increased their sensitivity to docetaxel by targeting EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway. These findings suggest that miR-143 plays an important role in prostate cancer proliferation, migration and chemosensitivity by suppressing KRAS and subsequent inactivation of MAPK pathway, which provides a potential development of a new approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Bin Xu', 'Xiaobing Niu', 'Xiangxiang Zhang', 'Jun Tao', 'Deyao Wu', 'Zidun Wang', 'Pengchao Li', 'Wei Zhang', 'Hongfei Wu', 'Ninghan Feng', 'Zengjun Wang', 'Lixin Hua', 'Xinru Wang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['miR-200b suppresses cell proliferation, migration and enhances chemosensitivity in prostate cancer by regulating Bmi-1.', 'miR-134 functions as a tumor suppressor in cell proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal Transition by targeting KRAS in renal cell carcinoma cells.', 'MicroRNA-217 functions as a tumour suppressor gene and correlates with cell resistance to cisplatin in lung cancer.', 'MiR-346 promotes the biological function of breast cancer cells by targeting SRCIN1 and reduces chemosensitivity to docetaxel.', 'Nanoways to overcome docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'microRNAs in Liquid Biopsy: The Way to a Simple and Rapid Test for Early Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis?', 'The biological function of m6A methyltransferase KIAA1429 and its role in human disease.', 'circCYP24A1 promotes Docetaxel resistance in prostate Cancer by Upregulating ALDH1A3.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Restoration of miRNA-143 Expression Inhibits Growth and Migration of MKN-45 Gastric Cancer Cell Line.']"""

Therefore, it is crucial to create a model with a biomimetic microenvironment that allows such interactions to fully represent the pathophysiology of a disease for an in vitro study. This is achievable by using three-dimensional (3D) models instead of conventional two-dimensional (2D) cultures with the aid of tissue engineering technology. We are now able to better address the complex intercellular interactions underlying prostate cancer (CaP) bone metastasis through such models. In this study, we assessed the interaction of CaP cells and human osteoblasts (hOBs) within a tissue engineered bone (TEB) construct. Consistent with other in vivo studies, our findings show that intercellular and CaP cell-bone matrix interactions lead to elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases, steroidogenic enzymes and the CaP biomarker, prostate specific antigen (PSA); all associated with CaP metastasis. Hence, it highlights the physiological relevance of this model. We believe that this model will provide new insights for understanding of the previously poorly understood molecular mechanisms of bone metastasis, which will foster further translational studies, and ultimately offer a potential tool for drug screening.""","""['Shirly Sieh', 'Amy A Lubik', 'Judith A Clements', 'Colleen C Nelson', 'Dietmar W Hutmacher']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Organogenesis""","""['Paracrine interactions between LNCaP prostate cancer cells and bioengineered bone in 3D in vitro culture reflect molecular changes during bone metastasis.', 'A 3D in\xa0vitro model of patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft for controlled interrogation of in\xa0vivo tumor-stromal interactions.', 'Prostate cancer cells-osteoblast interaction shifts expression of growth/survival-related genes in prostate cancer and reduces expression of osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts.', 'Emerging Players in Prostate Cancer-Bone Niche Communication.', 'Endothelial Cells as Precursors for Osteoblasts in the Metastatic Prostate Cancer Bone.', 'Key aspects for conception and construction of co-culture models of tumor-stroma interactions.', 'Nano-Hydroxyapatite/PLGA Mixed Scaffolds as a Tool for Drug Development and to Study Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Bone.', 'Mechanobiological evaluation of prostate cancer metastasis to bone using an in vitro prostate cancer testbed.', 'Three-Dimensional Cell Cultures as an In Vitro Tool for Prostate Cancer Modeling and Drug Discovery.', 'Trends in Bone Metastasis Modeling.']"""

Trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy was performed in 135 patients who had elevated PSA level and/or palpable nodule on digital rectal examination. The PSA level was ≤ 10 ng/mL in 81 patients and >10 ng/mL in 54 patients. We designed a new formula consisting of prostate volume, patient's age, and free prostate specific antigen. Its resultant was defined as prostate biopsy index and was compared with the most currently used parameters. Histology results yielded prostate gland malignancy in 40 (30%) patients. Our new index differed significantly between the malignant and the non-malignant patient categories (P = 0.01). The ROC curve analysis at different specificity and sensitivity levels (85%, 90% and 95%) and regarding the area under the curve (AUC), our new index was significantly better than the other studied parameters (P = 0.001). Additionally, the AUC in patients with a PSA level ≤ 10 ng/mL and between 10.1 and 20 ng/mL was 0.75 and 0.78, with a sensitivity of 91% and 83% and a specificity of 24% and 73%, respectively, at a cut-off point of 1.7. The overall sensitivity and specificity at the same point were 80% and 41%, respectively. In conclusion, the performance of our new index was superior to all other evaluated parameters.

Methods:   Analysis of safety data from a cohort of RA patients who received at least one course of RTX. RA patients with previous malignancies were followed-up and compared to the group of patients with no history of malignancy.  Results:   One hundred and eighty-six RA patients, 33 (17.7%) males, the mean age and disease duration were 55.8 ± 13.0 and 14.5 ± 11.1 years, respectively. The mean follow-up was 22.3 ± 15.1 months, corresponding to a follow-up of 346 pt-years of RTX exposure. Among these, 24 (12.9%) patients had a history of a prior malignancy. Five cancers were diagnosed during follow-up with four new malignancies (1 prostate, 1 breast, 1 colon and 1 cervical cancers) and one recurrence of a known breast cancer. The overall cancer rate was 1.45/100 pt-years (95%CI: 0.19 to 2.70), which is comparable to previously studied DMARD-treated cohorts. No new hematopoietic neoplasms were reported and the six lymphomas that have been in remission prior to RTX-therapy remained under follow-up. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics and the cancer-risk of the 24 patients who presented with a prior malignancy were similar to those with no cancer history (162 patients).  Conclusions:   Although based on a modest number of observed cancers, and despite selection bias (12.9% of prior malignancies in our RTX treated RA), this observational study suggests that RTX does not increase the cancer risk in RA patients.""","""['Samy Slimani', 'Cédric Lukas', 'Bernard Combe', 'Jacques Morel']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Joint Bone Spine""","""['Late-onset neutropenia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis after treatment with rituximab.', 'The incidence of cancer in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a prior malignancy who receive TNF inhibitors or rituximab: results from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register-Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Up to Two Courses of the Rituximab Biosimilar CT-P10 Versus Innovator Rituximab in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: Results up to Week 72 of a Phase I Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review of efficacy and safety.', 'A pharmacokinetic evaluation of the rituximab biosimilar CT-P10 in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Cancer risks with JAKi and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis: a national real-world cohort study.', 'A comprehensive review of rituximab therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients.', 'Epidemiology and treatment patterns of rheumatoid arthritis in a large cohort of Arab patients.', 'Abatacept initiation in rheumatoid arthritis and the risk of cancer: a population-based comparative cohort study.', 'Immunosuppressive therapy for eye diseases: Effectiveness, safety, side effects and their prevention.']"""

Here, we demonstrate the radiosensitization efficacy of adenovirus (Ad)-E2F1 infection in growing (orthotopic) LNCaP and (subcutaneous) PC3 nude mice xenograft tumors.  Methods and materials:   Ad-E2F1 was injected intratumorally in LNCaP (3 × 10(8) plaque-forming units [PFU]) and PC3 (5 × 10(8) PFU) tumors treated with or without radiation. LNCaP tumor volumes (TV) were measured by magnetic resonance imaging, caliper were used to measure PC3 tumors, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling, and key proteins involved in cell death signaling were analyzed by Western blotting.  Results:   Intracellular overexpression of Ad-E2F1 had a significant effect on the regression of TV and reduction of PSA levels relative to that of adenoviral luciferase (Ad-Luc)-infected control. The in vivo regressing effect of Ad-E2F1 on LNCaP tumor growth was significant (PSA, 34 ng/ml; TV, 142 mm(3)) compared to that of Ad-Luc control (PSA, 59 ng/ml; TV, 218 mm(3); p <0.05). This effect was significantly enhanced by radiation therapy (compare: Ad-E2F1+RT/PSA, 16 ng/ml, and TV, 55 mm(3) to Ad-Luc+RT/PSA, 42 ng/ml, and TV, 174 mm(3), respectively; p <0.05). For PC3 tumors, the greatest effect was observed with Ad-E2F1 infection alone; there was little or no effect when radiotherapy (RT) was combined. However, addition of RT enhanced the level of in situ apoptosis in PC3 tumors. Molecularly, addition of Ad-E2F1 in a combination treatment abrogated radiation-induced BCL-2 protein expression and was associated with an increase in activated BAX, and together they caused a potent radiosensitizing effect, irrespective of p53 and androgen receptor functional status.  Conclusions:   We show here for the first time that ectopic overexpression of E2F1 in vivo, using an adenoviral vector, significantly inhibits orthotopic p53 wild-type LNCaP tumors and subcutaneous p53-null PC3 tumors in nude mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E2F1 strongly sensitizes LNCaP tumors to RT.

Methods and materials:   From 1992 to 2007, 472 patients were treated with a HDR boost at William Beaumont Hospital. They had at least one of the following: a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of >10 ng/ml, a Gleason score of ≥7, or clinical stage ≥T2b. Patients received 46-Gy P-EBRT and an HDR boost. The HDR dose fractionation was divided into two dose levels. The prostate biologically equivalent dose (BED) low-dose-level group received <268 Gy, and the high-dose group received >268 Gy . Phoenix biochemical failure (BF) definition was used.  Results:   Median follow-up was 8.2 years (range, 0.4-17 years). The 10-year biochemical failure rate of 43.1% vs. 18.9%, (p < 0.001), the clinical failure rate of 23.4% vs. 7.7%, (p < 0.001), and the distant metastasis of 12.4% vs. 5.7%, (p = 0.028) were all significantly better for the high-dose level group. On Cox multivariate analysis, higher BED levels (p = 0.017; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.586), pretreatment PSA assays (p < 0.001, HR = 1.022), and Gleason scores (p = 0.004) were significant variables for reduced biochemical failure. Higher dose levels (p, 0.002; HR, 0.397) and Gleason scores (p < 0.001) were significant for clinical failure. Grade 3 genitourinary complications were 2% and 3%, respectively, and grade 3 gastrointestinal complication was <0.5%.  Conclusions:   This prospective trial using P-EBRT with HDR boost and hypofractionated dose escalation demonstrates a strong dose-response relationship for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients.

Methods:   We used in silico analysis and molecular cloning to discover new AMACR variants and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to measure the transcript levels of AMACR and its variants in 4 prostate cell lines and in 23 pairs of CaP and adjacent normal tissue.  Results:   We found 4 novel variants, IAs, IBL, IBLd, and IBLi. Transcript levels of most AMACR variants were significantly upregulated in CaP compared with its adjacent normal counterparts. A variants, the functional variants based on bioinformatic analysis, showed levels of transcript expression in CaP in this order: IA≫IAd=IIA≫IIAs>IAs. In contrast, the expression of the B variants, which appear to be nonfunctional due to the absence of exon 3, was lower than that of the A variants. IB was the most abundant form of B variant; and expression of IIB was negligible. More important, the difference between levels of variant IA, IAd, IIA, IIAs, IB, and IBLi in CaP and normal tissue was significantly higher than the difference in levels of total AMACR.

PSAV rose continuously with increasing PSA (P <.0001), and was significantly higher in cancers than controls for observations at PSA levels <3 ng/mL (P = .02) and 3-10 ng/mL (P = .0008). The probability of life-threatening CaP was 3% at a PSA <3 ng/mL, but increased to 13.6% with PSAV >0.4 ng/mL/y. At PSA levels of 3-10 ng/mL, the probability of life-threatening CaP was 9.8% based on PSA alone vs 12% with PSAV >0.4 ng/mL/y.  Conclusions:   PSAV was significantly higher in CaP observations than controls in all PSA ranges studied and altered the risk of overall and life-threatening CaP at a given PSA level. Because the value of PSAV is PSA-dependent, the PSA level should be taken into account when interpreting PSAV.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Anna Kettermann', 'Luigi Ferrucci', 'E Jeffrey Metter']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'PSA velocity for assessing prostate cancer risk in men with PSA levels between 2.0 and 4.0 ng/ml.', 'Prostate-specific antigen velocity in healthy Korean men with initial PSA levels of 4.0 ng/mL or less.', 'Prostate-specific antigen velocity risk count assessment: a new concept for detection of life-threatening prostate cancer during window of curability.', 'The role of prostate-specific antigen velocity in prostate cancer early detection.', 'PSA velocity: a systematic review of clinical applications.', 'Relationships between holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen Trends Predict the Probability of Prostate Cancer in a Very Large U.S. Veterans Affairs Cohort.', 'The use of multiphase nonlinear mixed models to define and quantify long-term changes in serum prostate-specific antigen: data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.', 'A longitudinal study of PSA and its influential factors in a cohort of Chinese men with initial PSA levels less than 4 ng ml(-1).', 'An examination of the dynamic changes in prostate-specific antigen occurring in a population-based cohort of men over time.']"""

These PICMs have the ability to lose their shell and release the PAMAM/nucleic acid core under mildly acidic conditions such as those encountered in the endosomal compartment. In this work, pH-sensitive PICMs composed of PEG-b-P(PrMA-co-MAA), different PAMAMs, and siRNAs were prepared and characterized. These micelles had mean diameters ranging from 50 to 100 nm depending on the structure of the polycationic component. In order to trigger PICM uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis, the micelles were decorated with an antibody fragment directed against the transferrin receptor (anti-CD71). The targeting ligand was stably conjugated to a semi-telechelic amino-PEG-b-P(PrMA-co-MAA) via a maleimide/activated ester bifunctional linker, yielding up to 60%-80% functionalization of the maleimide groups. The cellular uptake of the micelles was assessed on human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) via flow cytometry. Native PICMs and micelles bearing a non-specific antibody fragment were taken up to the same extent with a low efficiency, whereas anti-CD71 Fab'-decorated PICMs exhibited significantly higher uptake. The capacity of the targeted, siRNA-loaded, PICMs to downregulate the expression of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic oncoprotein was investigated using the appropriate unmodified or 2'-modified (2'F-RNA and 2'F-ANA) siRNA sequence. Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels were greatly reduced when the cells were transfected with anti-CD71 decorated PICMs. Optimal silencing was achieved with the chemically modified siRNA.

Manual segmentation of the prostate boundary is, however, time consuming and subject to inter- and intra-reader variability. T2-weighted (T2-w) magnetic resonance (MR) structural imaging (MRI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS) have recently emerged as promising modalities for detection of prostate cancer in vivo. MRS data consists of spectral signals measuring relative metabolic concentrations, and the metavoxels near the prostate have distinct spectral signals from metavoxels outside the prostate. Active Shape Models (ASM's) have become very popular segmentation methods for biomedical imagery. However, ASMs require careful initialization and are extremely sensitive to model initialization. The primary contribution of this paper is a scheme to automatically initialize an ASM for prostate segmentation on endorectal in vivo multi-protocol MRI via automated identification of MR spectra that lie within the prostate. A replicated clustering scheme is employed to distinguish prostatic from extra-prostatic MR spectra in the midgland. The spatial locations of the prostate spectra so identified are used as the initial ROI for a 2D ASM. The midgland initializations are used to define a ROI that is then scaled in 3D to cover the base and apex of the prostate. A multi-feature ASM employing statistical texture features is then used to drive the edge detection instead of just image intensity information alone. Quantitative comparison with another recent ASM initialization method by Cosio showed that our scheme resulted in a superior average segmentation performance on a total of 388 2D MRI sections obtained from 32 3D endorectal in vivo patient studies. Initialization of a 2D ASM via our MRS-based clustering scheme resulted in an average overlap accuracy (true positive ratio) of 0.60, while the scheme of Cosio yielded a corresponding average accuracy of 0.56 over 388 2D MR image sections. During an ASM segmentation, using no initialization resulted in an overlap of 0.53, using the Cosio based methodology resulted in an overlap of 0.60, and using the MRS-based methodology resulted in an overlap of 0.67, with a paired Student's t-test indicating statistical significance to a high degree for all results. We also show that the final ASM segmentation result is highly correlated (as high as 0.90) to the initialization scheme.""","""['Robert Toth', 'Pallavi Tiwari', 'Mark Rosen', 'Galen Reed', 'John Kurhanewicz', 'Arjun Kalyanpur', 'Sona Pungavkar', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Multi-attribute non-initializing texture reconstruction based active shape model (MANTRA).', 'A hierarchical spectral clustering and nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme for detection of prostate cancer from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).', 'Spatially varying accuracy and reproducibility of prostate segmentation in magnetic resonance images using manual and semiautomated methods.', 'The Evidence for Using Artificial Intelligence to Enhance Prostate Cancer MR Imaging.', 'Multiparametric MRI of prostate cancer: an update on state-of-the-art techniques and their performance in detecting and localizing prostate cancer.', 'Challenge of prostate MRI segmentation on T2-weighted images: inter-observer variability and impact of prostate morphology.', 'Convolutional Neural Network-Based Humerus Segmentation and Application to Bone Mineral Density Estimation from Chest X-ray Images of Critical Infants.', 'A Point Says a Lot: An Interactive Segmentation Method for MR Prostate via One-Point Labeling.', 'Radiomic features on MRI enable risk categorization of prostate cancer patients on active surveillance: Preliminary findings.', 'A supervoxel-based segmentation method for prostate MR images.']"""

One possibility is that the LE-cancer relation may depend on other biological factors pertinent to stress and cancer.  Methods:   This study examined the relationship between LE and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, a tumor marker, and whether cortisol mediates or moderates a LE-PSA relationship. During a voluntary screening for prostate cancer risk, 139 men (mean age=57.3 years) were assessed with the Holmes and Rahe questionnaire about their LE during the past 1-5 years, and their PSA and serum cortisol levels were measured.  Results:   LE and cortisol alone were unrelated to PSA. However, statistically controlling for age, body mass index and the ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol, we found evidence for a synergistic interaction between LE and cortisol. Among men with low cortisol, number of LE were inversely and significantly correlated with PSA (r=-0.265, p<0.05), while in men with high cortisol, number of LE were positively and significantly correlated with PSA (r=0.344, p<0.01). These results more consistently stemmed from the effects of uncontrollable LE. Similar results were found, using a clinically significant PSA cut-off.  Conclusions:   These results suggest considering the joint effects of psychosocial and biological factors in relation to possible cancer risk, where the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis may moderate stress-cancer risk associations.""","""['Yori Gidron', 'Bibiana Fabre', 'Halina Grosman', 'Carlos Nolazco', 'Viviana Mesch', 'Osvaldo Mazza', 'Gabriela Berg']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Psychoneuroendocrinology""","""['Relationship between cortisol, life events and metabolic syndrome in men.', 'Early and late life events and salivary cortisol in older persons.', 'Diurnal cortisol decline is related to coronary calcification: CARDIA study.', 'A new look at the neural diathesis--stress model of schizophrenia: the primacy of social-evaluative and uncontrollable situations.', 'Psychological stress in oncology: the role of glucocorticoids.', 'Circadian Rhythm Disruption as a Contributor to Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer.', 'Psychosocial Stress, Glucocorticoid Signaling, and Prostate Cancer Health Disparities in African American Men.', 'Multi-Dimensional Scaling Analysis of Key Regulatory Genes in Prostate Cancer Using the TCGA Database.', 'Placing prostate cancer disparities within a psychosocial context: challenges and opportunities for future research.']"""

Prostate-specific antigen density was evaluated as a diagnostic tool to predict upstaging using ROC-curve analysis.  Results:   Of the patients, 30.8% had bilateral prostate cancer or extracapsular extension in the surgical specimen.

Conclusions:   A considerable amount of patients that are initially diagnosed with unilateral prostate cancer on biopsy are underdiagnosed and are upstaged in the radical prostatectomy specimen.

Main methods:   PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP cells were treated with RAD001, VPA or with an RAD001-VPA combination for 3 or 5 days. Tumor cell growth, cell cycle progression and cell cycle regulating proteins were then investigated by MTT assay, flow cytometry and Western blotting, respectively. Effects of drug treatment on cell signaling pathways were determined.  Key findings:   Separate application of RAD001 or VPA distinctly reduced tumor cell growth and impaired cell cycle progression. Significant additive effects were evoked when both drugs were used in concert. Particularly, the cell cycle regulating proteins cdk1, cdk2, cdk4 and cyclin B were reduced, whereas p21 and p27 were enhanced by the RAD001-VPA combination. Signaling analysis revealed deactivation of EGFr, ERK1/2 and p70S6k. Phosphorylation of Akt was diminished in DU-145 but elevated in PC-3 and LNCaP cells.

One explanation for this lack of predictive power may be the inaccurate application of staging criteria.  Methods:   Data from men in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database with localized prostate cancer (clinical T1-T2) were analyzed. Correct stage was determined by digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings and was compared with the clinical stage reported directly by the practitioner. DRE/TRUS findings and biopsy results were evaluated to determine factors influencing staging errors. The ability of corrected stage to predict biochemical disease recurrence after prostatectomy was assessed using multivariable analysis.  Results:   Clinical stage was assigned incorrectly in 1370 of 3875 men (35.4%). Errors more commonly resulted in patient downstaging than upstaging (55.1% vs 44.9%; P < .001). Patients with TRUS lesions were more likely to be staged incorrectly than those with abnormal DRE findings (65.8% vs 38.2%; P < .001). Biopsy laterality was found to strongly influence stage assignment. Even after correction of staging errors, there was no association noted between clinical stage and biochemical disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Errors in applying clinical staging criteria for localized prostate cancer are common. TRUS findings are frequently disregarded, and practitioners incorrectly incorporate biopsy results when assigning stage. However, staging errors do not appear to account for the inconsistent reliability of clinical stage in predicting prostate cancer outcomes. These findings further challenge the utility of a DRE-based and/or TRUS-based staging system for risk assessment of localized prostate cancer.""","""['Adam C Reese', 'Natalia Sadetsky', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Transrectal ultrasound for staging prostate carcinoma prior to radiation therapy: an evaluation based on disease outcome.', 'Relationship of ultrasound staging and bilateral biopsy positivity to outcome in stage T1c prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy.', 'Minimal impact of clinical stage on prostate cancer prognosis among contemporary patients with clinically localized disease.', 'Staging prostate cancer--1997: current methods and limitations.', 'T3 prostate cancer: how reliable is clinical staging?', 'A Novel Risk Score (P-score) Based on a Three-Gene Signature, for Estimating the Risk of Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'Clinical annotations for prostate cancer research: Defining data elements, creating a reproducible analytical pipeline, and assessing data quality.', 'Comparison of Multimodal Therapies and Outcomes Among Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer With Adverse Clinicopathologic Features.', 'Comparative performance and external validation of the multivariable PREDICT Prostate tool for non-metastatic prostate cancer: a study in 69,206 men from Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe).', 'Risk stratification for prostate cancer management: value of the Cambridge Prognostic Group classification for assessing treatment allocation.']"""

We have recently shown that resveratrol can enhance the apoptosis-inducing potential of TRAIL in prostate cancer cells through multiple mechanisms in vitro. Therefore, the present study was designed to validate whether resveratrol can enhance the apoptosis-inducing potential of TRAIL in a xenograft model of prostate cancer.  Methodology/principal findings:   Resveratrol and TRAIL alone inhibited growth of PC-3 xenografts in nude mice by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation (PCNA and Ki67 staining) and inducing apoptosis (TUNEL staining). The combination of resveratrol and TRAIL was more effective in inhibiting tumor growth than single agent alone. In xenografted tumors, resveratrol upregulated the expressions of TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5, Bax and p27(/KIP1), and inhibited the expression of Bcl-2 and cyclin D1. Treatment of mice with resveratrol and TRAIL alone inhibited angiogenesis (as demonstrated by reduced number of blood vessels, and VEGF and VEGFR2 positive cells) and markers of metastasis (MMP-2 and MMP-9). The combination of resveratrol with TRAIL further inhibited number of blood vessels in tumors, and circulating endothelial growth factor receptor 2-positive endothelial cells than single agent alone. Furthermore, resveratrol inhibited the cytoplasmic phosphorylation of FKHRL1 resulting in its enhanced activation as demonstrated by increased DNA binding activity.  Conclusions/significance:   These data suggest that resveratrol can enhance the apoptosis-inducing potential of TRAIL by activating FKHRL1 and its target genes. The ability of resveratrol to inhibit tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, and enhance the therapeutic potential of TRAIL suggests that resveratrol alone or in combination with TRAIL can be used for the management of prostate cancer.""","""['Suthakar Ganapathy', 'Qinghe Chen', 'Karan P Singh', 'Sharmila Shankar', 'Rakesh K Srivastava']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Expression of Concern: Resveratrol Enhances Antitumor Activity of TRAIL in Prostate Cancer Xenografts through Activation of FOXO Transcription Factor.', 'Curcumin sensitizes TRAIL-resistant xenografts: molecular mechanisms of apoptosis, metastasis and angiogenesis.', 'Resveratrol induces growth arrest and apoptosis through activation of FOXO transcription factors in prostate cancer cells.', 'Sulforaphane enhances the therapeutic potential of TRAIL in prostate cancer orthotopic model through regulation of apoptosis, metastasis, and angiogenesis.', 'TRAIL/Apo-2L: mechanisms and clinical applications in cancer.', 'Metastasis-associated protein 1-mediated antitumor and anticancer activity of dietary stilbenes for prostate cancer chemoprevention and therapy.', 'Inhibition of ANO1 by Cis- and Trans-Resveratrol and Their Anticancer Activity in Human Prostate Cancer PC-3 Cells.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', ""Resveratrol and Its Analogue 4,4'-Dihydroxy-trans-stilbene Inhibit Lewis Lung Carcinoma Growth In Vivo through Apoptosis, Autophagy and Modulation of the Tumour Microenvironment in a Murine Model."", 'FOXO3a and Its Regulators in Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibitory effect of polyphenols (phenolic acids, lignans, and stilbenes) on cancer by regulating signal transduction pathways: a review.']"""

Objectives:   The objective of the study was to analyse the early complications and to predict immediate outcomes of transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) in a single tertiary care institute.  Materials and methods:   We prospectively evaluated 100 patients undergoing transurethral resection of prostate at B and B Hospital, Gwarko, Lalitpur, Nepal, from August 2008 till April 2009. Case records containing 32 variables concerning preoperative status, operative details, complications and immediate outcome were recorded for each patient.  Results:   The cumulative short-term postoperative significant morbidity was 10% and the peroperative morbidity was 6%. The most relevant postoperative complication was failure to void (24%). Among significant postoperative morbidities, surgical revision had to be performed in two patients (2%), open prostatectomy in one patient, transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome in 5% and significant urinary tract infection in 2%. Among significant intra operative morbidity, we had one case with bladder perforation, significant cardiac arrhythmia requiring prompt attention in 4% and TUR syndrome during resection in 1%. We did not have any mortality related to the procedure during the study period. The resected tissue averaged 25.67 gm. Incidental carcinoma of the prostate was diagnosed by histological examination in 4% of patients. Urine peak flow rate (Q-max) increased to 12.88 ml per second from 9.24 ml per second and average fl ow rate increased to 7.36 ml per second from 5.03 ml per second. The postoperative mean residual urine measured by ultrasound decreased to 28.46 ml from preoperative 86.59 ml.  Conclusions:   TURP has, for decades, been the standard surgical therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia though significant morbidities can be associated with the procedure.

Here, we propose an efficient p-value evaluation procedure by adapting the stochastic approximation Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The new procedure can be used easily for estimating the p-value for any resampling-based test. We show through numeric simulations that the proposed procedure can be 100-500 000 times as efficient (in term of computing time) as the standard resampling-based procedure when evaluating a test statistic with a small p-value (e.g. less than 10( - 6)).

Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, has repeatedly been shown to be associated with adverse outcome in this malignancy. We hypothesized that a regulatory BCL2 -938C>A promoter polymorphism, which significantly affects promoter activity and Bcl-2 expression in different malignancies, may influence survival. Reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveled that the -938C>A BCL2 promoter polymorphism significantly affects promoter activity and transcription factor binding in prostate cancer cells. Significantly higher BCL2 mRNA expression was observed in primary prostate carcinomas derived from patients with the AA, compared to CC, genotype. Survival analysis showed that the -938AA genotype was an independent, unfavorable prognostic factor for relapse-free survival in a primary cohort of 142 patients and in an independent replication cohort of 148 patients, with hazard ratios (HR) of 4.4 (95% CI, 1.3-15.1; p = 0.018) and 4.6 (95% CI, 1.5-14.2; p = 0.009).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BITC on DU 145 human prostate cancer cells in order to clarify whether a time/concentration range for optimal BITC-induced apoptosis exists and to find the associated signaling pathway. Cell morphological changes, percentage of cell viability, DNA damage and apoptosis in DU 145 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy, flow cytometric assay, 4',6-diamidine-20-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining, comet assay and Western blotting analysis. The results indicate that BITC induces cell morphological changes, decreases the percentage of viable cells (induction of cell cytotoxicity), and induces DNA damage and apoptosis in DU 145 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric assays indicated that BITC promoted reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ productions and decreased the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΤYm), while the pre-treatment with N-acetylcysteine caused an increase in the percentage of viable cells. BITC also promoted caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities. Furthermore, when cells were pre-treated with the caspase-3 inhibitor and then treated with BITC, this led to an increase in the percentage of viable cells. Confocal laser microscopy examination indicated that BITC promoted the expression of AIF and Endo G, which were released from the mitochondria in DU 145 cells.

Metastatic cancer cells may physically contact osteoblasts in the bone microenvironment; however, the biological significance of this interaction is not fully understood.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cells (the osteolytic cell line PC-3 and the osteoblastic cell line MDA-PCa 2b) and human osteoblasts (hFOB1.19) were cocultured under two different conditions (bilayer and contact conditions). Differential gene expression profiles of prostate cancer cells were then investigated using microarray analysis. Differentially expressed genes were analysed using RT-PCR and western blotting, and the effect of anti-cadherin neutralising antibodies on their expression was assayed. The osteoclastogenic activity of cells grown under these different conditions was also investigated using an in vitro assay.  Results:   When PC-3 or MDA-PCa 2b cells were cocultured with hFOB1.19 cells under contact conditions, the expression of eight genes was upregulated and that of one gene was downregulated in PC-3 cells compared with gene expression in bilayer culture. No differentially expressed genes were detected in MDA-PCa 2b cells. Four of the eight upregulated genes (interleukin-1β (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), IL-6 and the third component of complement (C3)) have already been reported to participate in osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, a cell lysate of PC-3 cells grown under contact coculture conditions significantly enhanced osteoclastogenesis in vitro (P<0.005). neutralisation of cadherin-11 with a specific antibody inhibited upregulation of COX-2 and C3 mRNA in PC-3 cells. In contrast, neutralisation of N-cadherin induced upregulation of COX-2 mRNA.  Conclusion:   Physical contact between osteolytic prostate cancer cells and osteoblasts may upregulate osteoclastogenesis-related gene expression in prostate cancer cells and enhance osteoclastogenesis. Additionally, cadherin-11 and N-cadherin are involved in this process.

Membrane androgen receptors (mARs) have been characterized in human prostate cancer, being preferentially expressed in tumor rather than benign gland areas. Furthermore, mAR agonists (protein-conjugated testosterone) decrease in vitro prostate cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis, whereas in vivo they regress growth of tumor xenografts alone or in combination with taxane drugs. In this respect, targeting mARs might be a novel therapeutic approach in prostate cancer. In our search for new small-molecule ligands of mAR, we report that flavanol dimers B1-B4 (oligomeric procyanidins) decrease in vitro growth of the androgen-sensitive (LnCaP) and androgen-resistant (DU145) human prostate cancer cell lines in the following order: B3 = B4 > B2 ≫ B1 (LnCaP) and B2 ≫ B3 = B4 ≫ B1 (DU145). Some of these analogs were previously shown to trigger signaling cascades similar to testosterone-bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugate.

Although a function in both tumor onset and metastasis has been proposed, the role played by EphA2 in tumor progression is still debated. In melanoma, EphA2 has been reported to affect cell migration and invasiveness allowing cells to move by a proteolysis-independent strategy, commonly referred as amoeboid motility. With the aim to understand the role of EphA2 in prostate cancer metastatic spreading, we stably silenced EphA2 expression in a model of aggressive metastatic prostate carcinoma. Our results show that EphA2 drives the metastatic program of prostate carcinoma, although its involvement greatly differs among metastatic steps. Indeed, EphA2 expression (i) greatly affects prostate carcinoma cell motility style, guiding an amoeboid movement based on Rho-mediated cell rounding and independent from metalloprotases, (ii) is ineffective on transendothelial migration, adhesion onto extracellular matrix proteins, and on resistance to anoikis, (iii) regulates clonogenic potential of prostate carcinoma, thereby increasing anchorage-independent growth and self-renewal, prostasphere formation, tumor onset, dissemination to bone, and growth of metastatic colonies. Our finding indicate that EphA2-overexpressing prostate carcinoma cells gain an invasive benefit from their amoeboid motility style to escape from primary tumors and then, enhancing their clonogenic potential successfully target bone and grow metastases, thereby acknowledging EphA2 as a target for antimetastatic therapy of aggressive prostate cancers.""","""['Maria Letizia Taddei', 'Matteo Parri', 'Adriano Angelucci', 'Francesca Bianchini', 'Chiara Marconi', 'Elisa Giannoni', 'Giovanni Raugei', 'Mauro Bologna', 'Lido Calorini', 'Paola Chiarugi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['EphA2 reexpression prompts invasion of melanoma cells shifting from mesenchymal to amoeboid-like motility style.', 'Vav3-rac1 signaling regulates prostate cancer metastasis with elevated Vav3 expression correlating with prostate cancer progression and posttreatment recurrence.', 'Kinase-dependent and -independent roles of EphA2 in the regulation of prostate cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Key molecular mechanisms in lung cancer invasion and metastasis: a comprehensive review.', 'm6A methylated EphA2 and VEGFA through IGF2BP2/3 regulation promotes vasculogenic mimicry in colorectal cancer via PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 signaling.', 'Invadopodia play a role in prostate cancer progression.', 'Claisened Hexafluoro Inhibits Metastatic Spreading of Amoeboid Melanoma Cells.', 'EphA2 Is a Clinically Relevant Target for Breast Cancer Bone Metastatic Disease.', 'Development of EphA2 siRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles and combination with a small-molecule histone demethylase inhibitor in prostate cancer cells and tumor spheroids.']"""

Patients and methods:   We evaluated physical activity in relation to overall and PCa mortality among 2,705 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study diagnosed with nonmetastatic PCa observed from 1990 to 2008. Proportional hazards models were used to evaluate physical activity and time to overall and PCa-specific death.  Results:   Among men who lived at least 4 years after their postdiagnosis physical activity assessment, we documented 548 deaths, 20% of which were a result of PCa. In multivariable analysis, men who were physically active had lower risk of all-cause mortality (P(trend) < .001) and PCa mortality (P(trend) = .04). Both nonvigorous activity and vigorous activity were associated with significantly lower overall mortality. Those who walked ≥ 90 minutes per week at a normal to very brisk pace had a 46% lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71) compared with shorter durations at an easy walking pace. Men with ≥ 3 hours per week of vigorous activity had a 49% lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.72). For PCa-specific mortality, brisk walking at longer durations was suggestively inverse but not statistically significant. Men with ≥ 3 hours per week of vigorous activity had a 61% lower risk of PCa death (HR, 0.39, 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.84; P = .03) compared with men with less than 1 hour per week of vigorous activity. Men exercising vigorously before and after diagnosis had the lowest risk.  Conclusion:   In men with PCa, physical activity was associated with lower overall mortality and PCa mortality.

If fatal form of cancer was a highly familial subtype, then familial risk for mortality may exceed that of incidence, which would be particularly relevant for clinical decision making and counseling.  Patients and methods:   The individuals in the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database were classified according to family history of fatal and nonfatal cancer. Familial risks of incident and fatal concordant cancer were calculated for offspring based on their parental family history using a Cox model with hazard ratio (HR); offspring without family history were the reference.  Results:   Most HRs for offspring incident cancers were somewhat higher for fatal compared with nonfatal parental family history. For breast (HR, 1.87 fatal v 1.66 nonfatal; P < .001) and prostate (HR, 2.30 fatal v 1.84 nonfatal; P < .001) cancers, 51.0% of patients with familial breast cancer and 56.6% of patients with prostate cancer had fatal family history. HRs for death in offspring according to a fatal compared with nonfatal family history were significantly increased for colorectal (HR, 1.76 v 1.47, respectively; P = .02), breast (HR, 1.97 v 1.51, respectively; P = .002), and prostate (HR, 2.03 v 1.59, respectively; P = .002) cancers. TNM classification did not seem to differ between the family histories. We showed also that an overwhelming proportion of offspring were diagnosed after the parental death.

However, their direct actions on stromal cells surrounding cancer cells have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of subtype-selective α(1)-AR antagonists (naftopidil, tamsulosin, and silodosin) on prostate tumor growth with a focus on the role of stroma, using commercially available fibroblast cells (PrSC). Tumorigenic studies in vivo showed significant reductions in tumor growth when E9 cells (an androgen low-sensitive LNCaP subline) grafted with PrSC were treated with naftopidil. In in vitro analyses, naftopidil and silodosin showed antiproliferative effects on PCa cells regardless of androgen sensitivity and α(1)-AR subtype expression. In PrSC, a strong growth inhibitory effect was observed with naftopidil but not silodosin. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that naftopidil, but not silodosin, induced G(1) cell-cycle arrest in both PCa cells and PrSC. In naftopidil-treated PrSC, total interleukin-6 protein was significantly reduced with increased suppression of cell proliferation. Silodosin induced weak early apoptosis only in PCa cells. These findings demonstrated that naftopidil strongly suppressed cell proliferation of stromal cells, resulting in decreased tumorigenic soluble factor, suggesting that naftopidil might be effective in preventing stromal support of tumor cells.""","""['Yasuhide Hori', 'Kenichiro Ishii', 'Hideki Kanda', 'Yoichi Iwamoto', 'Kohei Nishikawa', 'Norihito Soga', 'Hideaki Kise', 'Kiminobu Arima', 'Yoshiki Sugimura']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Drug Repositioning of the α1-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonist Naftopidil: A Potential New Anti-Cancer Drug?', 'Prostate growth inhibition by subtype-selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist naftopidil in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Oral naftopidil suppresses human renal-cell carcinoma by inducing G(1) cell-cycle arrest in tumor and vascular endothelial cells.', 'Naftopidil, a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibits growth of human prostate cancer cells by G1 cell cycle arrest.', 'Apoptotic impact of alpha1-blockers on prostate cancer growth: a myth or an inviting reality?', 'Piperazine-Derived α1D/1A Antagonist 1- Benzyl-N- (3-(4- (2-Methoxyphenyl) Piperazine-1-yl) Propyl) -1H- Indole-2- Carboxamide Induces Apoptosis in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Independently of α1-Adrenoceptor Blocking.', 'Effects of α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists on the development and progression of urothelial cancer.', 'First small-molecule PROTACs for G protein-coupled receptors: inducing α 1A-adrenergic receptor degradation.', 'Drug Repositioning of the α1-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonist Naftopidil: A Potential New Anti-Cancer Drug?', 'Naftopidil reduced the proliferation of lung fibroblasts and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice.']"""

Here, we investigated the expression of p32 in 148 prostate carcinoma tissues by immunohistochemistry and found a positive correlation of p32 expression to clinicopathological parameters including follow-up data. p32 is highly expressed in prostate tumor samples and its expression is significantly associated with the Gleason score, pathological stage and relapse. For localized cancers, high p32 is a strong and independent predictor of clinical recurrence in multivariate analysis (P=0.01). In addition, p32 is overexpressed in the prostate cancer cell lines examined. The selective knockdown of p32 by RNA interference inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cell lines but not of a non-cancerous cell line.

Aim:   We aimed to examine the association of INSR H1085H C>T and IRS1 G972R polymorphisms with prostate cancer (PC). We also aimed to examine possible association with cancer severity assessed by Gleason score.  Materials and methods:   We have studied 180 consecutive patients referred for PC screening. The genotyping of two polymorphisms (INSR H1085H C>T and IRS1 G972R) was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.  Results:   There was no difference in genotype (p=0.794) or allelic (p=0.621) frequency of the IRS1 G972R polymorphism between PC (n=119) and control (n=61) groups.

Identification of causal mutations may have significant impact on clinical management of such families. Despite high mutation detection rate, many HBOC cases remain without identified cause. These cases warrant use of several analysis methods, such as those for large genomic rearrangements and DNA copy number changes, or analysis other genes, shown to be associated with increased HBOC risk. We assessed 585 Slovak HBOC for the presence of mutations in BRCA genes. Sequencing revealed mutations in 100 families, representing 17.1% (88 and 12% of mutations were located in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively). Four of the mutations, c.80+4del4, c.1938_1947del10 and c.1166delG in BRCA1 and c.6589delA in BRCA2 gene have been described only in Slovak population. Using MLPA analysis, we detected two large genomic rearrangements in three families, a deletion of exons 21 and 22, and a rare deletion of a whole BRCA1 gene. Twenty-seven different variants of uncertain clinical effect (four novel) and 14 distinct SNP BRCA1 haplotypes were detected. Their potential effect was considered using the prediction software packages Align-GVGD, Pmut and Polyphen. We observed that the best clinical criterion for the initiation of BRCA1 analysis is the presence of breast cancer at 40 years of age in the association with the presence of ovarian cancer diagnosed around the age of 50. Conversely, the best clinical criterion for starting with BRCA2 analysis is the presence of breast cancer diagnosed in older age (above 50), or the presence of breast cancer in conjunction with carcinomas at different sites e.g., prostate, colorectum, ovary and uterus.

New conditions might worsen management of existing conditions because of competing demands or improve management of existing conditions because of increased engagement with heath care. We assessed the effect of incident stage 0, 1, 2 or 3 breast, colon or prostate cancer; incident depression; or an exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease on control of type 2 diabetes (DM2).  Methods:   We conducted a longitudinal, historical cohort study within an integrated, not-for-profit HMO. Of a cohort of persons with diagnoses of DM2 between 1998 and 2008, 582, 2,959 and 2,332 developed incident cancer, depression or pulmonary disease exacerbation, respectively. We assessed change in hemoglobin A1c (A1c) as a function of the occurrence of the incident comorbidity in each subcohort for a period of 1 to 5 years after the occurrence of the incident comorbidity. Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. Multivariate linear regression was adjusted for demographics, morbidity level, BMI, numbers of primary and specialty visits, and continuity of primary care. Latent class analyses assessed post-comorbidity outcome trajectories. All time-varying covariates were calculated for a 24-month pre-diagnosis period and 0 to 24- and 24 to 60-month post-diagnosis periods.  Results:   For each condition, A1c did not change significantly from before to after the incident comorbidity. This was confirmed by latent class growth curve analyses that grouped patients by their A1c trajectories. SBP and LDL were also not significantly changed pre- and post-diagnosis of the incident comorbidities.  Discussion:   Although incident comorbidities inevitably will affect patients' and clinicians' care priorities, we did not observe changes in these particular outcomes. Additional investigation of interactions between diseases will inform changes in care that benefit complex patient populations.""","""['Elizabeth A Bayliss', 'Patrick J Blatchford', 'Sophia R Newcomer', 'John F Steiner', 'Diane L Fairclough']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Gen Intern Med""","""['Depression Is Associated with Readmission for Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.', 'Impact of comorbidity type on measures of quality for diabetes care.', 'Physical activity and risk of comorbidities in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cohort study.', 'Asthma COPD overlap: Impact of associated comorbidities.', 'Co-morbidities of COPD in primary care: frequency, relation to COPD, and treatment consequences.', 'Great diversity in the utilization and reporting of latent growth modeling approaches in type 2 diabetes: A literature review.', 'The bidirectional longitudinal association between depressive symptoms and HbA1c : A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The impact of cancer on diabetes outcomes.', 'Quality of diabetes care in breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer.', 'Quality of diabetes care in cancer: a systematic review.']"""

Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs), including the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFRs) are also important in development and disease. However, a direct relationship between growth factor signaling pathways and NFκB activation has not been previously described, although FGFs have been known to antagonize TNFα-induced apoptosis.  Methodology/principal findings:   Here, we demonstrate an interaction between FGFR4 and IKKβ (Inhibitor of NFκB Kinase β subunit), an essential component in the NFκB pathway. This novel interaction was identified utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen [1] and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. We demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of IKKβ in the presence of activated FGFR4, but not kinase-dead FGFR4. Following stimulation by TNFα (Tumor Necrosis Factor α) to activate NFκB pathways, FGFR4 activation results in significant inhibition of NFκB signaling as measured by decreased nuclear NFκB localization, by reduced NFκB transcriptional activation in electophoretic mobility shift assays, and by inhibition of IKKβ kinase activity towards the substrate GST-IκBα in in vitro assays. FGF19 stimulation of endogenous FGFR4 in TNFα-treated DU145 prostate cancer cells also leads to a decrease in IKKβ activity, concomitant reduction in NFκB nuclear localization, and reduced apoptosis. Microarray analysis demonstrates that FGF19 + TNFα treatment of DU145 cells, in comparison with TNFα alone, favors proliferative genes while downregulating genes involved in apoptotic responses and NFκB signaling.  Conclusions/significance:   These results identify a compelling link between FGFR4 signaling and the NFκB pathway, and reveal that FGFR4 activation leads to a negative effect on NFκB signaling including an inhibitory effect on proapoptotic signaling. We anticipate that this interaction between an RTK and a component of NFκB signaling will not be limited to FGFR4 alone.""","""['Kristine A Drafahl', 'Christopher W McAndrew', 'April N Meyer', 'Martin Haas', 'Daniel J Donoghue']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Protein Kinase-Mediated Decision Between the Life and Death.', 'IL-1β inhibits β-Klotho expression and FGF19 signaling in hepatocytes.', 'Metabolic regulator betaKlotho interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) to induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell proliferation.', 'Interrupting the FGF19-FGFR4 Axis to Therapeutically Disrupt Cancer Progression.', 'Regulation and function of IKK and IKK-related kinases.', 'Low Baseline CXCL9 Predicts Early Progressive Disease in Unresectable HCC with Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab Treatment.', 'Characterization of the Impact of Merkel Cell Polyomavirus-Induced Interferon Signaling on Viral Infection.', 'Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 promotes glioblastoma progression: a central role of integrin-mediated cell invasiveness.', 'Cholecystectomy as a risk factor for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: unveiling the metabolic and chronobiologic clues behind the bile acid enterohepatic circulation.', 'Gut Microbiota, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors, and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

Recent studies have shown that the miR-17-92 cluster is overexpressed in many types of cancer. The oncogenic function of mature miRNAs encoded by the miR-17-92 cluster has been identified from the 5' arm of six precursors. However, the function of the miRNAs produced from the 3' arm of these precursors remains unknown. The present study demonstrates that miR-17* is able to suppress critical primary mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes, such as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), glutathione peroxidase-2 (GPX2) and thioredoxin reductase-2 (TrxR2). Transfection of miR-17* into prostate cancer PC-3 cells significantly reduces levels of the three antioxidant proteins and activity of the luciferase reporter under the control of miR-17* binding sequences located in the 3'-untranslated regions of the three target genes. Disulfiram (DSF), a dithiolcarbomate drug shown to have an anticancer effect, induces the level of mature miR-17* and cell death in PCa cells, which can be attenuated by transfection of antisense miR-17*. Increasing miR-17* level in PC-3 cells by a Tet-on based conditional expression system markedly suppresses its tumorigencity.

However, several subsequent studies failed to detect the virus in patients suffering from these illnesses or in healthy subjects. Here we report the results of efforts to detect antibody responses and viral sequences in samples from a cohort of German CFS and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with fatigue symptoms.  Methodology:   Blood samples were taken from a cohort of 39 patients fulfilling the Fukuda/CDC criteria (CFS), from 112 patients with an established MS diagnosis and from 40 healthy donors. Fatigue severity in MS patients was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Validated Gag- and Env-ELISA assays were used to screen sera for XMRV antibodies. PHA-activated PBMC were cultured for seven days in the presence of IL-2 and DNA isolated from these cultures as well as from co-cultures of PBMC and highly permissive LNCaP cells was analyzed by nested PCR for the presence of the XMRV gag gene. In addition, PBMC cultures were exposed to 22Rv1-derived XMRV to assess infectivity and virus production.  Conclusion:   None of the screened sera from CFS and MS patients or healthy blood donors tested positive for XMRV specific antibodies and all PBMC (and PBMC plus LNCaP) cultures remained negative for XMRV sequences by nested PCR. These results argue against an association between XMRV infection and CFS and MS in Germany.

Using a well-characterised cohort of prostate cancer patients, we have previously reported that expression levels of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR-IR) and CB(1) receptor (CB(1)IR) in tumour tissue at diagnosis are markers of disease-specific survival, but it is not known whether the two markers interact in terms of their influence on disease severity at diagnosis and disease outcome.  Methodology/principal findings:   Data from a cohort of 419 patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at transurethral resection for voiding difficulties was used. Scores for both tumour CB(1)IR and pEGFR-IR were available in the database. Of these, 235 had been followed by expectancy until the appearance of metastases. For patients scored for both parameters, Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses using optimal cut-off scores indicated that the two measures provided additional diagnostic information not only to each other, but to that provided by the tumour stage and the Gleason score. When the cases were divided into subgroups on the basis of these cut-off scores, the patients with both CB(1)IR and pEGFR-IR scores above their cut-off had a poorer disease-specific survival and showed a more severe pathology at diagnosis than patients with high pEGFR-IR scores but with CB(1)IR scores below the cut-off.

We aimed to fill this gap by developing a user-friendly flowchart to assist urologists when incidental PCa is diagnosed and a clinical decision is required.  Methods:   We analyzed 158 T1a-T1b prostate cancers patients who underwent RP between 1996 and 2009. A risk stratification tool was developed applying the tree modeling technique of classification and regression tree analysis (CART) and relying on all the available pre-RP characteristics (age, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] before SxBPH, PSA after SxBPH, cT1a-T1b stage, prostate volume and Gleason sum at SxBPH). Then, the accuracy of the proposed model using 200 bootstrap resamples for internal validation was calculated.  Results:   A total of 95 patients (60.1%) were stage T1a, and 63 (39.9%) were stage T1b. The median values of PSA before and after SxBPH were 4.2 and 1.1 ng/mL, respectively. A total of 22 patients (13.9%) showed no residual tumor (pT0) at RP. The CART analyses identified three groups at risk of having residual disease at RP: (i) PSA after SxBPH > 1.0 ng/mL (pT0 prevalence: 3.8%); (ii) PSA after SxBPH < 1.0 ng/mL and PSA before SxBPH > 2.0 ng/mL (pT0 prevalence: 14.8%); and (iii) PSA after SxBPH < 1.0 ng/mL and PSA before SxBPH < 2.0 ng/mL (pT0 prevalence: 42.3%). The accuracy of the proposed model was 77.1%. Clinical stage (T1a vs T1b) was not associated with pT0 (P = 0.4).  Conclusions:   Clinical stage (T1a vs T1b) assessment does not help in predicting pT0 cases.

The relationship between PSA level and obesity-related factors was analyzed by simple and multiple regression analysis. The relationships between six body mass index (BMI) categories, and PSA level and PSA mass (PSA concentration × plasma volume) were analyzed. PSA level decreased significantly with increasing BMI, but the coefficient of determination was very low. Mean PSA values decreased from 1.02 to 0.85 ng/mL as BMI increased from underweight (BMI <18.5) to morbidly obese (BMI >35). However, PSA mass peaked in the overweight category and was slightly reduced with increasing BMI. On multiple regression analysis, PSA level was influenced by age, diastolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein as well as BMI.

This study is to investigate the effect of several bisphosphonates on inhibiting proliferation of different lung cancer cell lines in vitro, and to validate whether this inhibitive effect is comprehensive or selective.  Methods:   The cytotoxic effect of bisphosphonates on lung cancer cells and human normal liver cells was determined by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay.  Results:   After incubation of lung cancer cells with bisphosphonates for 72h, the proliferation was inhibited in different degrees. The inhibiting activity of medronate (MDP) was the lowest, while the activity of ibandronate and incadronate (YM175) was between MDP and alendronate. The effects of bisphosphonates on human normal liver cells were different. The toxicity of MDP, ibandronate and YM175 was low, while alendronate had high toxicity. The sensitivity of lung cancer cells to bisphosphonates was also different. The sensitivity of H446 and SPC-A1 was comparatively lower, while H460 and A549 were more sensitive.

In Japan, prostate brachytherapy (PB) with iodine-125 has become a treatment option for localized prostate cancer since 2003. Nevertheless, severe acute urinary toxicity (AUT) remains as one of the intractable side effects. We assessed AUT and the changes in international prostate symptom score (IPSS) before and after PB for localized prostate cancer. IPSS is a questionnaire tool for tracking the subjective urinary symptoms. Between 2006 and 2009, 104 eligible patients underwent PB with iodine-125 were analyzed. AUT was graded with the radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) scale. Eligible patients filled out IPSS questionnaires before and after PB. Clinical and treatment-related factors were examined for correlation with the severity of AUT and the interval to IPSS resolution. AUT of RTOG Grade 0 (no changes) and Grade 2 was detected in one and 96 patients, respectively, whereas seven patients (6.7%) experienced AUT of Grade 3. Thus, the incidence of severe AUT (Grade 3) after PB was low. A greater number of needles (p = 0.012) were associated with AUT of RTOG Grade 3 on the univariate analysis. The median interval to IPSS resolution was 6 months (7 ± 6 months). Greater post-implant maximal IPSS (p < 0.001) was associated with slower IPSS resolution, whereas higher pre-implant IPSS (p < 0.001) was associated with faster IPSS resolution on the multivariate analysis.

To overcome the lack of reproducibility, we profiled miRNAs by next generation sequencing and locked nucleic acid miRNA microarrays and verified concordant changes by quantitative RT-PCR. Notably, miR-125b and the miR-99 family members miR-99a, -99b, and -100 were downregulated in all assays in advanced prostate cancer cell lines relative to the parental cell lines from which they were derived. All four miRNAs were also downregulated in human prostate tumor tissue compared with normal prostate. Transfection of miR-99a, -99b, or -100 inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells and decreased the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), suggesting potential roles as tumor suppressors in this setting. To identify targets of these miRNAs, we combined computational prediction of potential targets with experimental validation by microarray and polyribosomal loading analysis. Three direct targets of the miR-99 family that were validated in this manner were the chromatin-remodeling factors SMARCA5 and SMARCD1 and the growth regulatory kinase mTOR.

Given the frequency of cyclin D1 alterations in cancer, it is imperative to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which cyclin D1 controls key transcription factor networks in human disease. Prostate cancer was used as a paradigm because this tumor type is reliant at all stages of the disease on androgen receptor (AR) signaling, and cyclin D1 has been shown to negatively modulate AR-dependent expression of prostate-specific antigen (KLK3/PSA). Strategies were employed to control cyclin D1 expression under conditions of hormone depletion, and the effect of cyclin D1 on subsequent androgen-dependent gene expression was determined using unbiased gene expression profiling. Modulating cyclin D1 conferred widespread effects on androgen signaling and revealed cyclin D1 to be a selective effector of hormone action. A subset of androgen-induced target genes, known to be directly regulated by AR, was strongly suppressed by cyclin D1. Analyses of AR occupancy at target gene regulatory loci of clinical relevance demonstrated that cyclin D1 limits AR residence after hormone stimulation.

Circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a serologic marker of the inflammatory response, have been positively associated with colorectal cancer development in some studies; however, there are limited data on the relation of CRP with colorectal adenomas, established precursors of colorectal cancer.  Methods:   A nested case-control investigation of CRP levels and incident colorectal adenoma was conducted in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, a randomized trial of 154,942 individuals designed to test the efficacy of flexible sigmoidoscopy on colorectal cancer mortality when performed once, and then repeated 3 to 5 years later. Serum CRP levels were measured in baseline blood specimens from participants who were free of polyps in the left-sided colorectum at the baseline screening procedure, but who were found at the subsequent screen to have at least one colorectal adenoma (n=356), and in a set of polyp-free, frequency-matched controls (n=396).  Results:   In a multivariable logistic regression model that included established colorectal adenoma risk factors, a 1-unit increase in log CRP level was associated with a 15% reduction in risk of developing colorectal adenoma (OR=0.85, 95% CI, 0.75-0.98, Ptrend=0.01). This association did not differ according to body size, smoking behavior, gender, use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or adenoma location.

No prior work had shown the effect of 5-ARIs on those already diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer.  Objective:   Our aim was to determine the effect of 5-ARIs on pathologic progression in men on active surveillance.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a single-institution retrospective cohort study comparing men taking a 5-ARI versus no 5-ARI while on active surveillance for prostate cancer.  Measurements:   Pathologic progression was evaluated and defined as Gleason score >6, maximum core involvement >50%, or more than three cores positive on a follow-up prostate biopsy. Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted along with multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression modeling for predictors of pathologic progression.  Results and limitations:   A total of 288 men on active surveillance met the inclusion criteria. The median follow-up was 38.5 mo (interquartile range: 23.6-59.4) with 93 men (32%) experiencing pathologic progression and 96 men (33%) abandoning active surveillance. Men taking a 5-ARI experienced a lower rate of pathologic progression (18.6% vs 36.7%; p=0.004) and were less likely to abandon active surveillance (20% vs 37.6%; p=0.006). On multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis, lack of 5-ARI use was most strongly associated with pathologic progression (hazard ratio: 2.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.6).

We compared the cost-effectiveness of the five different 3-month formulations of LHRH agonists currently available for advanced prostate cancer in Italy, because these differ both in their capacity to suppress testosterone and in their acquisition costs.  Methods:   A probabilistic, patient-level simulation model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness, from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (INHS), of leuprorelin 11.25 mg and 22.5 mg, triptorelin 11.25 mg, buserelin 9.9 mg, and goserelin 10.8 mg. The model incorporated testosterone-dependent progression-free and cancer-specific survival functions, LHRH agonist effectiveness data, and national costs and tariffs. Cox's proportional hazard models were used to compute total and progression-free survival functions based on clinical data from 129 patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated in an Italian center. Bayesian random effects models were employed to summarize evidence from published literature on testosterone suppression obtained with the available LHRH agonists.  Results:   Estimated total survival was ≈5 years, with a maximum difference between treatment options of ≈2 months. There was a mean difference of almost €2,500 in lifetime total costs between the least costly option (leuprorelin 22.5 mg) and the most expensive (goserelin). In the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, leuprorelin 22.5 mg dominated all alternatives except buserelin, which had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio versus leuprorelin 22.5 mg of ≈€12,000 per life-month gained.

Pre-intervention levels of psychological and relationship functioning were evaluated as moderators of intervention effects.  Methods:   Seventy-one survivors and their partners completed a baseline survey and were subsequently randomly assigned to receive five sessions of IET or UC (no treatment). Eight weeks after the baseline assessment, a follow-up survey was administered to survivor and partner.  Main outcome measures:   Distress, well-being, relationship satisfaction, relationship intimacy, and communication were investigated as the main outcomes.  Results:   IET effects were largely moderated by pre-intervention psychosocial and relationship factors. Those survivors who had higher levels of cancer concerns at pretreatment had significantly reduced concerns following IET. Similar moderating effects for pre-intervention levels were reported for the effects of IET on self-disclosure, perceived partner disclosure, and perceived partner responsiveness. Among partners beginning the intervention with higher cancer-specific distress, lower marital satisfaction, lower intimacy, and poorer communication, IET improved these outcomes.

Twenty-four Cancer Registries (CRs) (covering 27% of the Italian population) collected information on the incidence and vital status of 1,275,353 cases diagnosed between 1978 and 2005. For each CR, the observed prevalence was calculated up to the maximum observable duration. To estimate the complete prevalence (all living patients, independently from time since diagnosis) and the prevalence for lengths of time exceeding the CR maximum duration of registration, the observed prevalence was corrected through a completeness index. Completeness indices, gender, age and site specific, were estimated by means of statistical regression models using cancer incidence and survival data available from CRs with more than 15 years of observation. As of 1 January 2006, the prevalence was estimated (as absolute numbers and as a proportion per 100,000 inhabitants) for 46 cancer sites, by gender, age class, years since diagnosis and geographic areas.  Results:   as of 2006, 2,244,000 persons (4%of the Italian population) were alive with a cancer diagnosis. A relevant geographic variability emerged, with proportions between 4%-5% among CRs in the Centre and North of Italy, and proportions between 2%-3% in the South. Forty-four percent of prevalent subjects (988,000) were males and 56% (1,256,000) females. Fifty-seven percent (1,285,680 people, 2.2% of total population) of these patients was represented by long-term survivors. In patients aged 75 years or more, the proportions of prevalent cases were 19%in males and 13%in females, and 10%between 60 and 75 years of age in both genders.More than half a million Italian women were alive with a breast cancer diagnosis (42%of women with a neoplasm), followed by women with cancers of the colonrectum (12%), corpus uteri (7%), thyroid (5%), and cervix uteri (4%). In men, 22%of prevalent cases (216,716) included patients with prostate cancer, 18% with bladder cancer, and 15%with colon-rectum cancer. Percentages of long-term survivors higher than 70% were reported for cancers of the cervix uteri (82% at five years, and 55% at 15 years from diagnosis), Hodgkin lymphoma, testis, brain and central nervous system, bone and connective tissue. Many patients with these types of cancers (often occurring in young people) can be considered ""cured"", i.e., with a life expectancy overlapping that of the general population.The estimated proportions of prevalent cases emerging from this study in Italy were quite similar to those reported in Northern Europe, but at least 15%lower than those in the United States.  Conclusions:   in 2006, the number of prevalent cases nearly doubled compared to 1992. The increase over time in the proportion of elderly patients, related to population ageing, requires adequate health policies. Knowing the number of people alive many years after cancer diagnosis (either cured or long-term survivors) provides the scientific bases for the definition of health policies focusing on them. Furthermore, it promotes the conduction of studies aimed at improving the present knowledge on the quality of life of these patients during and after the active phase of treatments, in addition to studies on the long-term effects of treatments.""","""['AIRTUM Working Group']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Epidemiol Prev""","""['Italian cancer figures, report 2014: Prevalence and cure of cancer in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Cancer treatment and survivorship statistics, 2014.', 'Common cancers in the elderly.', 'Cancer: New Needs, New Models.

We previously reported that the miR-34a gene is subject to epigenetic inactivation by CpG methylation of its promoter region in primary prostate cancer and melanomas, and in 110 different cancer cell lines of diverse origin. Here we analyzed the methylation status of miR-34a and miR-34b/c in additional primary tumors of divergent sites. We found methylation of miR-34a or miR-34b/c in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from 178 patients with the following frequencies: colorectal cancer (74% miR-34a, 99% miR-34b/c; n = 114), pancreatic cancer (64%, 100%; n = 11), mammary cancer (60%, 90%; n = 10), ovarian cancer (62%, 69%; n = 13), urothelial cancer (71%, 57%; n = 7), and renal cell cancer (58%, 100%; n = 12). Furthermore, soft tissue sarcomas showed methylation of miR-34 gene promoters in FFPE samples (64%, 45%; n = 11), in explanted, cultured cells (53%, 40%; n = 40), and in frozen tissue samples (75%, 75%, n = 8). In the colorectal cancer samples a statistically significant correlation of miR-34a methylation and the absence of p53 mutation was detected. With the exception of sarcoma cell lines, the inactivation of miR-34a and miR-34b/c was concomitant in most cases. These results show that miR-34 inactivation is a common event in tumor formation, and suggest that CpG methylation of miR-34a and miR-34-b/c may have diagnostic value. The mutual exclusiveness of miR-34a methylation and p53 mutation indicates that miR-34a inactivation may substitute for loss of p53 function in cancer.""","""['Markus Vogt', 'Johanna Munding', 'Martha Grüner', 'Sven-Thorsten Liffers', 'Berlinda Verdoodt', 'Jennifer Hauk', 'Lars Steinstraesser', 'Andrea Tannapfel', 'Heiko Hermeking']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['Inactivation of miR-34a by aberrant CpG methylation in multiple types of cancer.', 'Hypermethylation of potential tumor suppressor miR-34b/c is correlated with late clinical stage in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.', 'Epigenetic inactivation of DAPK1, p14ARF, mir-34a and -34b/c in acute promyelocytic leukaemia.', 'The miR-34 family in cancer and apoptosis.', 'The comprehensive landscape of miR-34a in cancer research.', 'Three specific gut bacteria in the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer: a concerted effort.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of miR-34a and miR-34b/c in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells: comprehensive characterization after exposure to 5-FU reveals EMT and autophagy as key processes regulated by miR-34.', 'CORM-A1 Alleviates Pro-Atherogenic Manifestations via miR-34a-5p Downregulation and an Improved Mitochondrial Function.', 'Curcumin activates a ROS/KEAP1/NRF2/miR-34a/b/c cascade to suppress colorectal cancer metastasis.', 'Analysis of the p53/microRNA Network in Cancer.']"""

To this end, we isolated the cancer stem cell-like side population (SP) cells from the human PCa cell line DU-145 by a flow cytometry-based SP technique. The isolated DU-145 SP cells comprised a small population of the DU-145 cells. The SP cells had an up-regulation of ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) which enables these cells to efflux vital dyes and chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, we detected a strong up-regulation of 12-LOX in these DU-145 SP cells compared to the parental DU-145 cells by RT-PCR and Western blot approaches. We also detected 12-LOX overexpression in PCa SCs in human PCa tissue samples by paraffin-section based immunofluorescent 4-channel confocal microscopy.

Manipulation of PAR mRNA in DU145 and NIH3T3 cells indicated that its expression level is an important determinant of cell in vitro proliferation, clonogenicity in soft agar and in vivo tumorigenicity. In this study, we showed that PAR is a short-lived protein with a peak in G2/M phase. Using immunofluorescent antibodies we showed that PAR moves from centrosomes in prophase and metaphase to spindle midzone in anaphase, and concentrates to midbody in telophase and cytokinesis. During mitosis a fraction of PAR can also be detected in the cytoplasm. PAR pattern of expression and its dynamic localization suggested a functional relationship to chromosomal passenger proteins (CPP). This protein colocalized with Aurora A at centrosomes in metaphase, and with survivin at midbody in telophase and cytokinesis. It also formed complexes with Aurora A, and with survivin, Aurora B and INCENP. In addition, PAR increased Aurora B kinase activity on histone H3. The decreased PAR levels in DU145 cells resulted in defects in centrosome segregation, in failed cytokinesis and chromosome alignment, and in increased number of apoptotic cells, polyploidy and aberrant mitosis. It is known that such defects could lead to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. In this study we also confirm our earlier findings that PAR is overexpressed in many tumors.

Loss of miR-8/200 microRNAs (miRNAs) is commonly observed in advanced tumours and correlates with their invasion and acquisition of stem-like properties. Here, we show that this miRNA family controls Notch signalling activation in Drosophila and human cells. In an overexpression screen, we identified the Drosophila miR-8 as a potent inhibitor of Notch-induced overgrowth and tumour metastasis. Gain and loss of mir-8 provoked developmental defects reminiscent of impaired Notch signalling and we demonstrated that miR-8 directly inhibits Notch ligand Serrate. Likewise, miR-200c and miR-141 directly inhibited JAGGED1, impeding proliferation of human metastatic prostate cancer cells. It has been suggested that JAGGED1 may also be important for metastases. Although in metastatic cancer cells, JAGGED1 modestly regulated ZEB1, the miR-200c's target in invasion, studies in Drosophila revealed that only concurrent overexpression of Notch and Zfh1/ZEB1 induced tumour metastases.

A classic site of involvement in the pelvis is the ischium, and the aim of this study was to assess the value of single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging in patients with focal ischial uptake on the planar scan.  Materials and methods:   This was a retrospective study of consecutive 150 patients with prostate cancer who were referred for a whole-body bone scan between August 2007 and 2008. Two experienced nuclear medicine consultants along with a musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed the scans.  Results:   Sixty-eight patients were diagnosed with widespread metastases and 46 patients showed typical degenerative disease changes on planar whole-body imaging. SPECT/CT imaging was done in 36 patients to clarify the diagnosis in areas of indeterminate uptake noted on planar whole-body imaging. Ten of these 36 patients who had focal increased ischial uptake were included in the study. Only three of these 10 patients were diagnosed as having a metastatic lesion with the presence of an enthesopathy, a common finding.  Conclusion:   Isolated focal uptake in the ischium is a relatively common finding in patients with prostate cancer and there is concern that this, on occasion, could be misinterpreted as metastasis.

Objective:   To evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral therapy for reducing persistent postprostatectomy incontinence and to determine whether the technologies of biofeedback and pelvic floor electrical stimulation enhance the effectiveness of behavioral therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective randomized controlled trial involving 208 community-dwelling men aged 51 through 84 years with incontinence persisting 1 to 17 years after radical prostatectomy was conducted at a university and 2 Veterans Affairs continence clinics (2003-2008) and included a 1-year follow-up after active treatment. Twenty-four percent of the men were African American; 75%, white.  Interventions:   After stratification by type and frequency of incontinence, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 8 weeks of behavioral therapy (pelvic floor muscle training and bladder control strategies); behavioral therapy plus in-office, dual-channel electromyograph biofeedback and daily home pelvic floor electrical stimulation at 20 Hz, current up to 100 mA (behavior plus); or delayed treatment, which served as the control group.  Main outcome measure:   Percentage reduction in mean number of incontinence episodes after 8 weeks of treatment as documented in 7-day bladder diaries.  Results:   Mean incontinence episodes decreased from 28 to 13 per week (55% reduction; 95% confidence interval [CI], 44%-66%) after behavioral therapy and from 26 to 12 (51% reduction; 95% CI, 37%-65%) after behavior plus therapy. Both reductions were significantly greater than the reduction from 25 to 21 (24% reduction; 95% CI, 10%-39%) observed among controls (P = .001 for both treatment groups). However, there was no significant difference in incontinence reduction between the treatment groups (P = .69).

Activation of the prosurvival Akt pathway accompanies androgen ablation. We discovered that the androgen receptor induces the expression of the tumor suppressor inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) but not PTEN in prostate cancer cells. Optimal induction of INPP4B by an androgen receptor required the expression of the transcriptional coactivator NCoR. INPP4B dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3, 4-bisphosphate, which leads to reduced phosphorylation and activity of Akt. In support of a key role for INPP4B in Akt control, INPP4B depletion activated Akt and increased cellular proliferation. The clinical significance of INPP4B in androgen-dependent prostate cancers was determined in normal or primary tumor prostate tissues derived from radical prostatectomy specimens. In primary tumors, the expression of both INPP4B and PTEN was substantially reduced compared with normal tissue.

Current international research activities toward defining the role of the tumor microenvironment in cancer progression were the subject of the first Tianjin Forum on Tumor Microenvironment held at Nankai University in Tianjin, China, July 2 to 4, 2010. The importance of variety of processes, such as inflammation and angiogenesis, in the role of tumor progression was described for multiple tumor types including breast, prostate, and hepatic cancers, as well as the process of bone metastasis. Identification of novel signaling pathways that impact both angiogenesis and bone remodeling were presented. Several themes emerged from this meeting, such as: (i) tumor cells modify the microenvironment to enhance their own survival and progression; (ii) targeting host factors, in addition to targeting tumor cells, will have important therapeutic effects; and (iii) host cells distribution within the tumor has both prognostic and therapeutic significance. Several priorities for future research were defined including use of a systems biology approach to define the role of host factors in tumor progression, to define the importance of targeting both arms of the bone remodeling process for therapy of bone metastasis, and to determine how different cell subsets contribute to microenvironment-mediated regulation of tumor progression.""","""['Evan T Keller', 'Lu-Yuan Li']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Tumor-associated macrophages: role in cancer development and therapeutic implications.', 'Role of the tumor microenvironment in regulating apoptosis and cancer progression.', 'The matrix environmental and cell mechanical properties regulate cell migration and contribute to the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.', 'Identification of a new pro-invasion factor in tumor microenvironment: progress in function and mechanism of extracellular ATP.', 'Immune mediators in the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer.', 'TLR4 ligand/H₂O₂ enhances TGF-β1 signaling to induce metastatic potential of non-invasive breast cancer cells by activating non-Smad pathways.', 'The PCa Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

In this study, we report a functional impact in prostate cancer cells for overexpression of the microRNA miR-616, which occurred consistently in cells that were androgen-independent (AI) versus androgen-dependent (AD). miR-616 overexpression was confirmed in malignant prostate tissues as opposed to benign prostate specimens. Stable miR-616 overexpression in LNCaP cells by a lentiviral-based approach stimulated AI prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro whereas concomitantly reducing androgen-induced cell growth. More importantly, miR-616 overexpressing LNCaP cells overcame castration resistance as shown by an enhanced ability to proliferate in vivo after bilateral orchiectomy. Conversely, antagonizing miR-616 in AI prostate cancer cells yielded opposite effects. Microarray profiling and bioinformatics analysis identified the tissue factor pathway inhibitor TFPI-2 mRNA as a candidate downstream target of miR-616. In support of this candidacy, we documented interactions between miR-616 and the 3'UTR of TFPI-2 and determined TFPI-2 expression to be inversely correlated to miR-616 in a series of prostate cell lines and clinical specimens. Notably, reexpression of TFPI-2 in LNCaP cells with stable miR-616 overexpression rescued the AD phenotype, as shown by a restoration of androgen dependence and cell growth inhibition.

We investigated the effects of AZD1152, an AURKB inhibitor, on radiosensitivity of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells. The goal of this study was to test whether AZD1152 increases the susceptibility of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells to radiation-induced DNA damage and to determine the conditions of AZD1152 treatment that maximize radiosensitization. PC3 and DU145 cells were treated with various AZD1152 doses for various durations to elucidate the conditions that yielded maximal increases in G(2)/M-phase and polyploid cells. To assess DNA damage, γ-H2AX phosphorylation was quantified for cells grown under radiosensitizing conditions and subjected to either no radiation or 5 Gy radiation. Radiosensitivity was determined by clonogenic assays. Cell cycle effects in both cell lines were maximized by treatment with 60 nM AZD1152 for 48 h. AZD1152-treated cells exhibited significantly increased DNA damage 30 min postirradiation (PC3: 100% compared to 68%, P = 0.035; DU145: 100% compared to 69%, P = 0.034), with additional DNA damage 6 h postirradiation (PC3: 85% compared to 15%, P = 0.002; DU145: 67% compared to 21%, P = 0.012). Radiosensitivity was increased in both cell lines, with dose enhancement ratios of 1.53 for PC3 cells (P = 0.017) and 1.71 for DU145 cells (P = 0.02). This study identifies the optimal AZD1152 treatment conditions to maximize the radiosensitization of PC3 and DU145 cells.

Two large placebo-controlled randomized trials found that men receiving 5-ARI were about 25% less likely than controls to be detected with cancer. However, most cancers were detected on routine biopsies required by study protocols. The benefit from receiving 5-ARI was minimal among men who underwent biopsy for clinical indications. Additionally, men receiving 5-ARI were more likely than controls to be diagnosed with high-grade cancers, though post-hoc analyses adjusting for biases accounted for the excess risk in one of the studies. A recent guideline recommended that men considering prostate cancer screening also consider chemoprevention. The rationale is that reducing cancer incidence, given the known risks for overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment, is sufficient justification for chemoprevention. However, a large randomized controlled trial found that screening was associated with a 70% increase in prostate cancer diagnosis--which chemoprevention would then reduce by 25%.

VD3 (calcitriol) has been identified as a possible adjunct in the treatment of cancer because of its antiproliferative and antitumorigenic properties. This study aimed to identify the cellular responses and molecular pathways activated when VD3 (calcitriol) is combined with cryotherapy in a murine CaP model. Single freeze-thaw events above -15 °C had little effect on cancer cell viability; however, pretreatment with calcitriol in conjunction with cryo significantly increased cell death. The -15 °C calcitriol combination increased cell death to 55% following a single freeze compared with negligible cell loss by freezing or calcitriol alone. Repeated cryo combination yielded 90% cell death compared with 65% in dual freeze-only cycles. Western blot analysis following calcitriol cryosensitization regimes confirmed the activation of apoptosis. Specifically, proapoptotic Bid and procaspase-3 were found to decrease at 1 h following combination treatment, indicating cleavage to the active forms. A parallel in vivo study confirmed the increased cell death when combining cryotherapy with calcitriol pretreatment. The development of an adjunctive therapy combining calcitriol and cryotherapy represents a potentially highly effective, less toxic, minimally invasive treatment option.

We previously reported that phosphorylation of tyrosine 211 (Y211) on PCNA is important for the proliferative function of PCNA when this protein is associated with the chromatin in cancer cells. Here, we show that the Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA is a frequent event in advanced prostate cancer. To explore the potential of this signaling event in inhibition of cancer cell growth, we used a synthetic peptide, the Y211F peptide, which when present inhibits phosphorylation of Y211 on endogenous PCNA. Treatment with this peptide, but not a scrambled control peptide, resulted in S-phase arrest, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and enhanced cell death in a panel of human prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, treatment with the Y211F peptide led to decreased tumor growth in PC3-derived xenograft tumors in vivo in nude mice. Our study shows for the first time that PCNA phosphorylation at Y211 is a frequent and biologically important signaling event in prostate cancer.

Results:   KPNA2 expression was significantly upregulated in carcinomas of the prostate, especially in metastatic and castration-resistant prostate cancer samples.

Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are a highly tumorigenic cell type found in developmentally diverse tumors or cancer cell lines, and they are often resistant to standard chemotherapeutic drugs. The origins of CSCs and their relationships to nonstem cancer cells (NSCCs) are poorly understood. In an inducible breast oncogenesis model, CSCs are generated from nontransformed cells at a specific time during the transformation process, but CSC formation is not required for transformation. MicroRNA profiles indicate that CSCs and NSCCs are related, but different cell types arising from a common nontransformed population. Interestingly, medium from the transformed population stimulates NSCCs to become CSCs, and conversion of NSCCs to CSCs occurs in mouse xenografts. Furthermore, IL6 is sufficient to convert NSCCs to CSCs in genetically different breast cell lines, human breast tumors, and a prostate cell line. Thus, breast and prostate CSCs and NSCCs do not represent distinct epigenetic states, and these CSCs do not behave as or arise from classic stem cells. Instead, tumor heterogeneity involves a dynamic equilibrium between CSCs and NSCCs mediated by IL6 and activation of the inflammatory feedback loop required for oncogenesis. This dynamic equilibrium provides an additional rationale for combining conventional chemotherapy with metformin, which selectively inhibits CSCs.""","""['Dimitrios Iliopoulos', 'Heather A Hirsch', 'Guannan Wang', 'Kevin Struhl']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Role of the IL-6-JAK1-STAT3-Oct-4 pathway in the conversion of non-stem cancer cells into cancer stem-like cells.', 'Arsenic exposure transforms human epithelial stem/progenitor cells into a cancer stem-like phenotype.', 'By promoting cell differentiation, miR-100 sensitizes basal-like breast cancer stem cells to hormonal therapy.', 'Breast cancer stem cells and intrinsic subtypes: controversies rage on.', 'Prostate cancer stem cell biology.', 'Cancer stem cell fate determination: mito-nuclear communication.', 'Polyploid giant cancer cells, cytokines and cytomegalovirus in breast cancer progression.', 'Reciprocal Interaction of Cancer Stem Cells of Cholangiocarcinoma with Macrophage.', 'LncRNA XIST regulates breast cancer stem cells by activating proinflammatory IL-6/STAT3 signaling.', 'Activation of an actin signaling pathway in pre-malignant mammary epithelial cells by P-cadherin is essential for transformation.']"""

Best understanding of biological mechanisms and new molecules to inhibit targets allow in certain case, to use therapeutic targeting in the true sense. The identification of the gene of fusion EML4-ALK in lung adenocarcinoma, and its inhibition by the crizotinib, constitute a considerable progress for 5% of patients with this disease. Molecular biology with the mutations of the exon 11 in GIST, allow to better define the population which is going to benefit from adjuvant imatinib. In Advanced non-small cell lung cancer, myeloma and advanced lymphoma, maintenance therapy by monoclonal anti-body or inhibitors of tyrosines kinases showed the proof of their effectiveness. In advanced melanoma, ipilimumab is a light of hope in a pathology in always prognostic is so dark.

[(11)C]Choline finds particular utility in the imaging of brain and prostate tumor metabolic status, where 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ('FDG') shows high background uptake. More recently we have extended the clinical utility of [(11)C]choline to breast cancer where radiotracer uptake correlates with tumor aggressiveness (grade). In the present study, a new choline analog, [(18)F]fluoro-[1,2-(2)H(4)]choline, was synthesized and evaluated as a potential PET imaging probe.  Methods:   [(18)F]Fluorocholine, [(18)F]fluoro-[1-(2)H(2)]choline and [(18)F]fluoro-[1,2-(2)H(4)]choline were synthesized by alkylation of the relevant precursor with [(18)F]fluorobromomethane or [(18)F]fluoromethyl tosylate. Radiosynthesis of [(18)F]fluoromethyl tosylate required extensive modification of the existing method. [(18)F]Fluorocholine and [(18)F]fluoro-[1,2-(2)H(4)]choline were then subjected to in vitro oxidative stability analysis in a chemical oxidation model using potassium permanganate and an enzymatic model using choline oxidase. The two radiotracers, together with the corresponding di-deuterated compound, [(18)F]fluoro-[1-(2)H(2)]choline, were then evaluated in vivo in a time-course biodistribution study in HCT-116 tumor-bearing mice.  Results:   Alkylation with [(18)F]fluoromethyl tosylate proved to be the most reliable radiosynthetic route. Stability models indicate that [(18)F]fluoro-[1,2-(2)H(4)]choline possesses increased chemical and enzymatic (choline oxidase) oxidative stability relative to [(18)F]fluorocholine. The distribution of the three radiotracers, [(18)F]fluorocholine, [(18)F]fluoro-[1-(2)H(2)]choline and [(18)F]fluoro-[1,2-(2)H(4)]choline, showed a similar uptake profile in most organs. Crucially, tumor uptake of [(18)F]fluoro-[1,2-(2)H(4)]choline was significantly increased at late time points compared to [(18)F]fluorocholine and [(18)F]fluoro-[1-(2)H(2)]choline.

Membrane type matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MT1-MMP) is a critical modulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover through pericellular proteolysis and thus plays crucial roles in neoplastic cell invasion and metastasis. MT1-MMP and its substrates pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 are often overexpressed in a variety of cancers including prostate cancer and the expression levels correlate with the grade of malignancy in prostate cancer cells. The purpose of this study is to determine any functional relation between LIMK1 and MT1-MMP and its implication in cell invasion.  Results:   Our results showed that treatment with the hydroxamate inhibitor of MT1-MMP, MMP-2 and MMP-9 ilomastat inhibited LIMK1-induced invasion of benign prostate epithelial cells. Over expression of LIMK1 resulted in increased collagenolytic activity of MMP-2, and secretion of pro-MMP2 and pro-MMP-9. Cells over expressing LIMK1 also exhibited increased expression of MT1-MMP, transcriptional activation and its localization to the plasma membrane. LIMK1 physically associates with MT1-MMP and is colocalized with it to the Golgi vesicles. We also noted increased expression of both MT1-MMP and LIMK1 in prostate tumor tissues.  Conclusion:   Our results provide new information on regulation of MT1-MMP function by LIMK1 and showed for the first time, involvement of MMPs in LIMK1 induced cell invasion.""","""['Tenekua Tapia', 'Richard Ottman', 'Ratna Chakrabarti']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Rho-Associated Protein Kinase (ROCK) Promotes Proliferation and Migration of PC-3 and DU145 Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting LIM Kinase 1 (LIMK1) and Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2).', 'LIMK Regulates Tumor-Cell Invasion and Matrix Degradation Through Tyrosine Phosphorylation of MT1-MMP.', 'Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 acts synergistically with synthetic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors but not with TIMP-4 to enhance the (Membrane type 1)-MMP-dependent activation of pro-MMP-2.', 'Coordinate action of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MT1-MMP) and MMP-2 enhances pericellular proteolysis and invasion.', 'The membrane tethered matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP at the forefront of melanoma cell invasion and metastasis.', 'Novel Roles of MT1-MMP and MMP-2: Beyond the Extracellular Milieu.', 'Long non-coding RNA Lnc-408 promotes invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cell by regulating LIMK1.', 'Role of microRNAs in Lung Carcinogenesis Induced by Asbestos.', 'Associations of LIM kinase1 (LIMK1) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms with prostate cancer susceptibility in Chinese population.', 'miR-27b-3p suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting LIMK1 in colorectal cancer.']"""

Overall, the transsexuals had a better psychological response to chemical castration than the PCa patients. The transsexuals showed more enthusiasm about the changes in their life; they viewed their lives as beginning anew, accepted their reduced libido, and were more comfortable with their increased emotionality. Different responses in the two groups are not surprising given that they undergo androgen deprivation under very different medical contexts. However, the fact that the transwomen are able to conceptualize the effects as positive suggests that some androgen-deprived PCa patients may benefit from reconceptualizing their changes within a positive framework. Additionally, difference in the two populations may be attributed, in part, to the fact that the transsexuals take supplemental estrogen.

LITAF was initially identified as a transcription factor that activates transcription of proinflammatory cytokine in macrophages in response to LPS. Mutations of the LITAF gene are associated with a genetic disease, called Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. Recently, we have reported that mRNA levels of LITAF and TNF superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15) are upregulated by 5' adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The present study further assesses their biological functions. Thus, we show that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), a pharmacological activator of AMPK, increases the abundance of LITAF and TNFSF15 in LNCaP and C4-2 prostate cancer cells, which is abrogated by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or the dominant-negative mutant of AMPK α1 subunit. Our data further demonstrate that AMPK activation upregulates the transcription of LITAF. Intriguingly, silencing LITAF by shRNA enhances proliferation, anchorage-independent growth of these cancer cells and tumor growth in the xenograft model. In addition, our study reveals that LITAF mediates the effect of AMPK by binding to a specific sequence in the promoter region. Furthermore, we show that TNFSF15 remarkably inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells in vitro, with a more potent effect toward the latter. In conjuncture, intratumoral injection of TNFSF15 significantly reduces the size of tumors and number of blood vessels and induces changes that are characteristic of tumor cell differentiation. Therefore, our studies for the first time establish the regulatory axis of AMPK-LITAF-TNFSF15 and also suggest that LITAF may function as a tumor suppressor.""","""['J Zhou', 'Z Yang', 'T Tsuji', 'J Gong', 'J Xie', 'C Chen', 'W Li', 'S Amar', 'Z Luo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor (LITAF)-deficient mice express reduced LPS-induced cytokine: Evidence for LITAF-dependent LPS signaling pathways.', 'p53 short peptide (p53pep164) regulates lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor/cytokine expression.', 'Down-modulation of TNFSF15 in ovarian cancer by VEGF and MCP-1 is a pre-requisite for tumor neovascularization.', 'IL6 and LIF mRNA expression in skeletal muscle is regulated by AMPK and the transcription factors NFYC, ZBTB14, and SP1.', 'Lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α factor enhances inflammation and is associated with cancer (Review).', 'The Transcription Factor Twist1 Has a Significant Role in Mycosis Fungoides (MF) Cell Biology: An RNA Sequencing Study of 40 MF Cases.', 'Addition of Losartan to FOLFIRINOX and Chemoradiation Reduces Immunosuppression-Associated Genes, Tregs, and FOXP3+ Cancer Cells in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Hsa_Circ_0066351 Acts as a Prognostic and Immunotherapeutic Biomarker in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Enhanced Anti-Cancer Effects of Conditioned Medium from Hypoxic Human Adult Dermal Fibroblasts on Cervical Cancer Cells.', 'How metformin affects various malignancies by means of microRNAs: a brief review.']"""

However, the differences between ordered categories may not be of equal importance (eg, the difference between grades 1 vs 2 compared with 1 vs 3). Weighted kappa can be used to adjust for this when comparing a small number of readers, but this has not as yet been applied to the large number of readers typical of a national EQA scheme.  Aim:   To develop and validate a method for applying weighted kappa to a large number of readers within the context of a real dataset: the UK National Urological Pathology EQA Scheme for prostatic biopsies.  Methods:   Data on Gleason grade recorded by 19 expert readers were extracted from the fixed text responses of 20 cancer cases from four circulations of the EQA scheme. Composite kappa, currently used to compute an unweighted kappa for large numbers of readers, was compared with the mean kappa for all pairwise combinations of readers. Weighted kappa generalised for multiple readers was compared with the newly developed 'pairwise-weighted' kappa.  Results:   For unweighted analyses, the median increase from composite to pairwise kappa was 0.006 (range -0.005 to +0.052). The difference between the pairwise-weighted kappa and generalised weighted kappa for multiple readers never exceeded ±0.01.

Survivin is expressed in a vast majority of human cancers, but not in normal adult tissues. Survivin expression is often correlated with poor prognosis in a wide variety of cancer patients. These features make survivin an attractive target against which cancer therapeutics could be developed. We have identified a survivin antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that potently downregulated survivin expression in human cancer cells derived from lung, colon, pancreas, liver, breast, prostate, ovary, cervix, skin, and brain as measured by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis. Specific inhibition of survivin expression in multiple cancer cell lines by this ASO (LY2181308) induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest in the G(2)-M phase, and multinucleated cells. We also showed that inhibition of survivin expression by LY2181308 sensitized tumor cells to chemotherapeutic-induced apoptosis. Most importantly, in an in vivo human xenograft tumor model, LY2181308 produced significant antitumor activity as compared with saline or its sequence-specific control oligonucleotide and sensitized to gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel. Furthermore, we showed that this antitumor activity was associated with significant inhibition of survivin expression in these xenograft tumors. On the basis of these, LY2181308 is being evaluated in a clinical setting (Phase II) in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Rosa A Carrasco', 'Nancy B Stamm', 'Eric Marcusson', 'George Sandusky', 'Philip Iversen', 'Bharvin K R Patel']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Antitumor activity of YM155, a selective small-molecule survivin suppressant, alone and in combination with docetaxel in human malignant melanoma models.', 'Survivin gene silencing sensitizes prostate cancer cells to selenium growth inhibition.', 'SPC3042: a proapoptotic survivin inhibitor.', 'Trace of survivin in cancer.', 'Survivin Small Molecules Inhibitors: Recent Advances and Challenges.', 'Isoalantolactone mediates the degradation of BCR-ABL protein in imatinib-resistant CML cells by down-regulating survivin.', 'Antisense oligonucleotide is a promising intervention for liver diseases.', 'Amphiphilic Anionic Oligomer-Stabilized Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles with Prospects in siRNA Delivery via Convection-Enhanced Delivery.', 'Survivin expression starts before hepatocellular cancer development in the liver of chronic hepatitis B patients: a pilot, cross-sectional study.', 'Cancer therapeutics using survivin BIRC5 as a target: what can we do after over two decades of study?']"""

Pharmacologic targeting of Stat5 is a rational approach to delay castrate-resistant progression, in part, because Stat5 cooperates with the androgen receptor (AR) to promote PCa progression. Immunostaining of tissue microarrays was used to correlate Stat5 expression with Gleason grade and to characterize changes in treatment-naive and androgen-deprived human PCa. Potency of a Stat5 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) on Stat5 knockdown, cell growth, and apoptosis was assessed in LNCaP, C4-2, and DU145 cells. Effects of Stat5 knockdown on AR activity and stability was assessed using a PSA transactivation-luciferase assay and cyclohexamide plus MG132 treatment, respectively. LNCaP tumor-bearing mice were castrated and randomly assigned to treatment with Stat5-ASO or controls. Here, we show that the frequency of Stat5 expression is significantly increased in high Gleason grade as well as in hormone-treated PCa. Also, specific knockdown of Stat5 with ASO abrogates androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation and PSA transactivation despite R1881 stimulation. Moreover, Stat5 knockdown destabilizes AR, which leads to AR degradation via the proteasome. Shown for the first time as a preclinical proof-of-principle, Stat5 knockdown with Stat5-ASO significantly delays CRPC tumor progression in vivo.

Different studies have proposed several risk factors such as ethnic origin, age, genetic factors, hormonal factors, diet and insulin-like growth factor, but the spatial distribution of the disease suggests that other environmental factors are involved. This paper studies the spatial distribution of prostate cancer mortality in an industrialized area using distances from each of a number of industrial facilities as indirect measures of exposure to industrial pollution.  Materials and methods:   We studied the Gran Bilbao area (Spain) with a population of 791,519 inhabitants distributed in 657 census tracts. There were 20 industrial facilities within the area, 8 of them in the central axis of the region. We analysed prostate cancer mortality during the period 1996-2003. There were 883 deaths giving a crude rate of 14 per 100,000 inhabitants. We extended the standard Poisson regression model by the inclusion of a multiplicative non-linear function to model the effect of distance from an industrial facility. The function's shape combined an elevated risk close to the source with a neutral effect at large distance. We also included socio-demographic covariates in the model to control potential confounding.  Results:   We aggregated the industrial facilities by sector: metal, mineral, chemical and other activities. Results relating to metal industries showed a significantly elevated risk by a factor of approximately 1.4 in the immediate vicinity, decaying with distance to a value of 1.08 at 12km. The remaining sectors did not show a statistically significant excess of risk at the source.  Discussion:   Notwithstanding the limitations of this kind of study, we found evidence of association between the spatial distribution of prostate cancer mortality aggregated by census tracts and proximity to metal industrial facilities located within the area, after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics at municipality level.""","""['Rebeca Ramis', 'Peter Diggle', 'Koldo Cambra', 'Gonzalo López-Abente']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Environ Int""","""['Environmental pollutants and prostate cancer: epidemiological data.', 'A multicountry ecologic study of risk and risk reduction factors for prostate cancer mortality.', 'Risk of bone tumors in children and residential proximity to industrial and urban areas: New findings from a case-control study.', 'Municipal distribution of bladder cancer mortality in Spain: possible role of mining and industry.', 'Diet, lifestyle and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Incidence Trends in the Oil Shale Industrial Region in Estonia.', 'Cancer Mortality and Deprivation in the Proximity of Polluting Industrial Facilities in an Industrial Region of Spain.', 'Different spatial pattern of municipal prostate cancer mortality in younger men in Spain.', 'Particulate Matter (Fine Particle) and Urologic Diseases.', 'Childhood cancer in small geographical areas and proximity to air-polluting industries.']"""

Increasing number of prostate biopsies was associated with increasing prostate volume (P <.01), prostate-specific antigen (P <.01), associated prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (P <.01), and increased likelihood of clinical Gleason 6 or less disease (P <.01). On pathologic analysis, increasing number of prostate biopsies was associated with increased risk of low-volume (P <.01), organ-confined (P <.01) disease. The risk of clinically insignificant disease was found to be 31.1%, 43.8%, and 46.8% in those undergoing 1, 2, and 3+ prostate biopsies, respectively. Conversely, the risk of adverse pathology was found to be 64.6%, 53.0%, and 52.0% in those undergoing 1, 2, and 3+ prostate biopsies, respectively.  Conclusions:   Patients undergoing multiple prostate biopsies before RP are more likely to harbor clinically insignificant prostate cancer than those who only undergo 1 biopsy before resection. Nonetheless, the risk of adverse pathology in patients undergoing serial biopsies remains significant. The increased risk of prostate cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment must be balanced with the continued risk of clinically significant disease when counseling patients regarding serial biopsies.""","""['Matthew J Resnick', 'Daniel J Lee', 'Laurie Magerfleisch', 'Keith N Vanarsdalen', 'John E Tomaszewski', 'Alan J Wein', 'S Bruce Malkowicz', 'Thomas J Guzzo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.

We sought to identify factors that predicted surgery failure within our patient cohort and to describe key aspects of the operation aimed at preservation of the dorsal urethral plate and longitudinal blood supply within the urethra.  Methods:   We reviewed our prospectively collected database and identified 45 men who underwent definitive perineal urethrostomy from 1989 to 2009. Primary success was defined as no need for additional treatment. If 1 urethral dilation was performed, outcome was defined as a secondary success.

Results:   Urethral pathology was varied and included idiopathic strictures (20%), lichen sclerosis (20%), infection (16%), radiation for prostate cancer (13%), prior hypospadias repair (11%), instrumentation or catheter trauma (11%), and penile cancer or condyloma (9%). Of these men, 21 (48%) had prior urethroplasty. Forty patients had follow-up greater than 3 months (median, 31 months). Postoperative stenosis occurred in 7 (18%) patients.

We have recently demonstrated that monoclonal antibody (mAb) libraries screened by fiber-modified adenovirus vector (Adv-FZ33), which is capable of binding to immunoglobulin-G (IgG), provide a powerful approach for the identification of suitable target antigens for prostate cancer therapy. Hybridoma libraries from mice immunized with androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP were screened and mAb were selected. Through this screening, we obtained one mAb, designated LNI-29, that recognizes a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kD. It was identified as neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2). Some prostate and breast cancer cell lines highly expressed NCAM2 whereas normal prostate cell lines expressed NCAM2 at low levels. In contrast to the low efficiency of gene transduction by Adv-FZ33 with a control antibody, LNI-29-mediated Adv-FZ33 infection induces high rates of gene delivery in NCAM2-positive cancers. NCAM2-mediated therapeutic gene transduction of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) had a highly effective cytotoxic effect on NCAM2-positive cancer cells, whereas it had less of an effect in cases with a control antibody. In conclusion, NCAM2 should be a novel gene therapy target for the treatment of prostate and breast cancer.""","""['Shu Takahashi', 'Kazunori Kato', 'Kiminori Nakamura', 'Rika Nakano', 'Kazuishi Kubota', 'Hirofumi Hamada']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Carcinoembryonic antigen-targeted selective gene therapy for gastric cancer through FZ33 fiber-modified adenovirus vectors.', 'Exploration of target molecules for prostate cancer gene therapy.', 'Gene therapy for prostate cancer using the cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase suicide system.', 'NCAM2/OCAM/RNCAM: cell adhesion molecule with a role in neuronal compartmentalization.', 'A novel screening method to establish tumor-targeting antibodies reliable for drug delivery system.', 'Pan-cancer assessment of mutational landscape in intrinsically disordered hotspots reveals potential driver genes.', 'Re-Expression of Poly/Oligo-Sialylated Adhesion Molecules on the Surface of Tumor Cells Disrupts Their Interaction with Immune-Effector Cells and Contributes to Pathophysiological Immune Escape.', 'The molecular underpinning of geminin-overexpressing triple-negative breast cancer cells homing specifically to lungs.', 'A Fucoxanthinol Induces Apoptosis in a Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia Cell.', 'Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor induces cell proliferation in the mouse urogenital sinus.']"""

In this study, we established PC3 in which the expression vector containing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting IL-6 was introduced (PC3/sh-IL6). Changes in the growth and sensitivity to docetaxel in PC3/sh-IL6 were compared with those in PC3 transfected with control vector alone (PC3/Co). Concentration of IL-6 in the culture supernatant from PC3/sh-IL6 was approximately 20% of that from PC3/Co. Both in vitro and in vivo, the growth of PC3/sh-IL-6 was significantly inferior to that of PC3/Co, accompanying downregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, phosphorylated Akt, p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and signal transducers and activation of transcription 3 in PC3/sh-IL-6 compared with that in PC3/Co. Despite the higher sensitivity of PC3/sh-IL6 to docetaxel than that of PC3/Co, the secretion of IL-6 by both cell lines was increased after treatment with docetaxel due to the formation of positive autocrine loops between these cell lines and NFκB signaling pathways. Furthermore, combined treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which completely inhibited the docetaxel-induced IL-6 secretion via the inactivation of NFκB signaling, resulted in the marked sensitization of these cell lines to docetaxel both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that suppressed IL-6 secretion using shRNA, either alone or in combination with docetaxel and bortezomib, could be a useful therapeutic strategy against androgen-independent prostate cancer.""","""['Iori Sakai', 'Hideaki Miyake', 'Tomoaki Terakawa', 'Masato Fujisawa']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Suppressed tumour growth and enhanced chemosensitivity by RNA interference targeting Aurora-A in the PC3 human prostate cancer model.', 'Rapamycin enhances docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity in a androgen-independent prostate cancer xenograft model by survivin downregulation.', 'Effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell lines.', 'New targeted therapies in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Interleukin-6 and prostate cancer progression.', 'GCN5 inhibition prevents IL-6-induced prostate cancer metastases through PI3K/PTEN/Akt signaling by inactivating Egr-1.', 'An Interleukin-6 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and Susceptibility to Prostate Adenocarcinoma and Bone Metastasis in an Iranian Population.', 'Meta-analysis of the role of IL-6 rs1800795 polymorphism in the susceptibility to prostate cancer: Evidence based on 17 studies.', 'IκB-Kinase-epsilon (IKKε) over-expression promotes the growth of prostate cancer through the C/EBP-β dependent activation of IL-6 gene expression.', 'Hepcidin regulation in prostate and its disruption in prostate cancer.']"""

Acute and late toxicities were graded as per the NCI CTCAEv3.0. The median follow-up was 22 months. The magnitude and direction of prostate displacement and daily shifts in three axes are reported. Of note, 9.1% and 12.9% of prostate displacements were ≥ 5 mm in the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions, respectively. Acute grade 2 GI and GU events occurred in 11% and 39% of patients, respectively, however no grade 3 or higher acute GI or GU events were observed. Regarding late toxicity, 2% and 17% of patients developed grade 2 toxicities, and similarly no grade 3 or higher events had occurred by last follow-up.

In Helical Tomotherapy (HT) treatment, a megavoltage CT (MVCT) image is usually acquired to evaluate daily changes in the patient's internal anatomy and setup position. This MVCT image is subsequently compared to the kilovoltage CT (kVCT) study that was used for dosimetric planning, by applying a registration process. This study aims at investigating the expected effect of patient setup correction using the Hi-Art tomotherapy system by employing radiobiological measures such as the biologically effective uniform dose (D) and the complication-free tumor control probability (P(+)). A new module of the Tomotherapy software (TomoTherapy, Inc, Madison, WI) called Planned Adaptive is employed in this study. In this process the delivered dose can be calculated by using the sinogram for each delivered fraction and the registered MVCT image set that corresponds to the patient's position and anatomical distribution for that fraction. In this study, patients treated for lung, pancreas and prostate carcinomas are evaluated by this method. For each cancer type, a Helical Tomotherapy plan was developed. In each cancer case, two dose distributions were calculated using the MVCT image sets before and after the patient setup correction. The fractional dose distributions were added and renormalized to the total number of fractions planned. The dosimetric and radiobiological differences of the dose distributions with and without patient setup correction were calculated. By using common statistical measures of the dose distributions and the P(+) and D concepts and plotting the tissue response probabilities vs. D a more comprehensive comparison was performed based on radiobiological measures. For the lung cancer case, at the clinically prescribed dose levels of the dose distributions, with and without patient setup correction, the complication-free tumor control probabilities, P(+) are 48.5% and 48.9% for a D(ITV) of 53.3 Gy. The respective total control probabilities, P(B) are 56.3% and 56.5%, whereas the corresponding total complication probabilities, P(I) are 7.9% and 7.5%. For the pancreas cancer case, at the prescribed dose levels of the two dose distributions, the P(+) values are 53.7% and 45.7% for a D(ITV) of 54.7 Gy and 53.8 Gy, respectively. The respective P(B) values are 53.7% and 45.8%, whereas the corresponding P(I) values are ~0.0% and 0.1%. For the prostate cancer case, at the prescribed dose levels of the two dose distributions, the P(+) values are 10.9% for a D(ITV) of 75.2 Gy and 11.9% for a D(ITV) of 75.4 Gy, respectively. The respective P(B) values are 14.5% and 15.3%, whereas the corresponding P(I) values are 3.6% and 3.4%. Our analysis showed that the very good daily patient setup and dose delivery were very close to the intended ones. With the exception of the pancreas cancer case, the deviations observed between the dose distributions with and without patient setup correction were within ±2% in terms of P(+). In the radiobiologically optimized dose distributions, the role of patient setup correction using MVCT images could appear to be more important than in the cases of dosimetrically optimized treatment plans were the individual tissue radiosensitivities are not precisely considered.""","""['P Mavroidis', 'F-C Su', 'D Giantsoudi', 'S Stathakis', 'G Komisopoulos', 'C Shi', 'G Swanson', 'N Papanikolaou']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Expected clinical impact of the differences between planned and delivered dose distributions in helical tomotherapy for treating head and neck cancer using helical megavoltage CT images.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Comparison of the 3D-conformal, helical tomotherapy and multileaf collimators-based intensity modulated radiotherapy modalities using radiobiological measures.', 'Helical tomotherapy: an innovative technology and approach to radiation therapy.', 'Clinical implementation of adaptive helical tomotherapy: a unique approach to image-guided intensity modulated radiotherapy.']"""

These findings were based on comparison with histological slides and McNeal's zonal anatomy. In ARFI images, the central zone (CZ) appears darker (smaller displacement) than other anatomic zones and prostate cancer (PCa) is darker than normal tissue in the peripheral zone (PZ). Since displacement amplitudes in ARFI images are determined by both the underlying tissue stiffness and the amplitude of acoustic radiation force that varies with acoustic attenuation, one question that arises is how the relative displacements in prostate ARFI images are related to the underlying prostatic tissue stiffness. In linear, isotropic elastic materials and in tissues that are relatively uniform in acoustic attenuation (e.g., liver), relative displacement in ARFI images has been shown to be correlated with underlying tissue stiffness. However, the prostate is known to be heterogeneous. Variations in acoustic attenuation of prostatic structures could confound the interpretation of ARFI images due to the associated variations in the applied acoustic radiation force. Therefore, in this study, co-registered three-dimensional (3D) ARFI datasets and quantitative shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) datasets were acquired in freshly-excised human prostates to investigate the relationship between displacement amplitudes in ARFI prostate images and the matched reconstructed shear moduli. The lateral time-to-peak (LTTP) algorithm was applied to the SWEI data to compute the shear-wave speed and reconstruct the shear moduli. Five types of prostatic tissue (PZ, CZ, transition zone (TZ) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PCa and atrophy) were identified, whose shear moduli were quantified to be 4.1 +/- 0.8 kPa, 9.9 +/- 0.9 kPa, 4.8 +/- 0.6 kPa, 10.0 +/- 1.0 kPa and 8.0 kPa, respectively. Linear regression was performed to compare ARFI displacement amplitudes and the inverse of the corresponding reconstructed shear moduli at multiple depths. The results indicate an inverse relation between ARFI displacement amplitude and reconstructed shear modulus at all depths. These findings support the conclusion that ARFI prostate images portray underlying tissue stiffness variations.""","""['Liang Zhai', 'John Madden', 'Wen-Chi Foo', 'Vladimir Mouraviev', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Mark L Palmeri', 'Kathryn R Nightingale']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ultrason Imaging""","""['Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging of human prostates: initial in vivo demonstration.', 'Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging of human prostates ex vivo.', 'Quantifying hepatic shear modulus in vivo using acoustic radiation force.', 'Acoustic radiation force elasticity imaging in diagnostic ultrasound.', 'Real-time elastography of the prostate.', 'Effects of substrate stiffness on the viscoelasticity and migration of prostate cancer cells examined by atomic force microscopy.', 'Adhesion strength and contractility enable metastatic cells to become adurotactic.', 'Why Are Viscosity and Nonlinearity Bound to Make an Impact in Clinical Elastographic Diagnosis?', 'Advanced ultrasound in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Impact of a novel ultrasound microvascular imaging and elastography on prostate cancer classification.']"""

For this purpose, total RNA from four human prostrate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, DU-145, and ND-I) and human fetal (n = 10) and adult (n = 10) prostates was extracted and mRNA expression was analyzed for four DNA repair genes by RT-PCR using specific oligonucleotides. For quantitation, we used β-actin as an internal standard in each tube as baseline gene expression. The results of these experiments suggest that human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, DU-145, and ND-I) have 2- to 10-fold lower mRNA expression for all four DNA repair genes compared with human fetal and adult prostate tissues.

The MMP-7 (matrilysin) gene is overexpressed in prostate cancer as well as colorectum and brain cancer. In order to clarify the relation of MMP-7 to clinical stages of prostate cancer, recombinant human MMP-7 was produced to prepare antibodies for immunohistochemistry and immunoassay. Preproform of human MMP-7 was produced in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies that could be solubilized and refolded to yield an activatable proenzyme. PreproMMP-7 (Mr 31,000) solubilized from inclusion bodies was converted to proMMP-7 (Mr 30,000) during the refolding steps. The refolded proMMP-7 was purified to about 80% homogeneity as MMP-7 by sequential ion-exchange and molecular-sieve chromatography. The active, mature form of MMP-7 (Mr 20,000) could be produced from proforms of MMP-7 by treatment with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Activated MMP-7 was shown to have proteolytic activity to fibronectin, casein, and diazotized, denatured collagen (Azocoll). Specific activity, as assayed with the denatured collagen as substrate, was measured to be about 3,100 units/mg protein of mature enzyme. Using recombinant proMMP-7 as antigen, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were prepared. A sandwich ELISA was developed using monoclonal antibody as the capture antibody and rabbit anti-proMMP-7 polyclonal IgG conjugated with biotin as the detection antibody; MMP-7 at 10 ng/ml was significantly detectable. The assay system is applicable on the measurement of MMP-7 levels in the clinical and pathologic specimens including serum from patients with different stages in malignancy of prostate cancer.

In this report, we studied expression of cyclin DI in three human prostate cancer cell lines: the androgen-dependent LNCaP and the androgen-independent PC3 and DU 145 cell lines. Northern blot analysis showed that DU145 and PC3 cells expressed more abundant cyclin DI than LNCaP cells. Southern blot analysis showed no evident gene amplification or rearrangement of cyclin DI in any of these cell lines. Serum starvation and replenishment were used in the cell culture to study the regulation of expression of cyclin DI. Cyclin DI mRNA expression was detected by Northern blot analysis when LNCaP cells grew in medium with serum but was not detected after serum withdrawal; however, cyclin DI mRNA was induced after serum was added. Cyclin DI mRNA expression by PC3 and DU 145 cells was detected both when they grew in medium with serum and after serum withdrawal, although expression decreased greatly after 24 hours in the PC3 cell line. Immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical staining also showed that cyclin D I protein was always expressed in PC3 and DU 145 cells under different growth factor environment, whereas it decreased significantly in LNCaP cells deprived of serum and the level resumed again when serum was re-added.

The clinical progression of prostate cancer has been partially attributed to a cascade of interactions between the cancer compartment and microenvironment compartments. The expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) parallels the activity of the epithelial compartment of prostate cancer. However, the clinical study of the bone-epithelial interaction has been limited by the lack of accessible relevant human tissue for study. This study was designed (1) to assess the value of human bone marrow as a source of tissue to study the bone-epithelial interaction and (2) to determine whether bone marrow supernatant regulates the expression of PSA in a human prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) in vitro. The acellular bone marrow supernatant derived from patients with prostate cancer with different degrees of tumor spread, hormonal status, and histology were assayed for their ability to induce PSA expression in a human LNCaP. The bone marrow supernatants were derived from 53 patients with prostate cancer (49 with adenocarcinoma and 4 with small cell carcinoma) and eight control patients, who had cancers in other sites. In addition, the match serum specimens derived from 25 of the study patients also had been assayed for its PSA inductivity. In addition to the comparison with ""static"" serum and BM concentration of PSA, the rate of significant PSA induction by clinical stage and hormonal status was assessed. Patients with androgen-independent disease had the highest rate of PSA-inducing ability. Only two patients (8%) had weak PSA-inducing ability from their serum (both with high volume disease) and none of the bone marrow supernatants derived from patients without prostate cancer or small cell carcinoma had inducing ability. No correlation between the static BM or serum PSA concentrations and the inducing ability was seen. These results indicate that PSA expression can be regulated by androgen-independent factors. The bone marrow supernatant of patients with prostate cancer has unique properties and is a valuable source of tissue for clinical study of the progression of prostate cancer. These preliminary data suggest that induction of PSA by bone marrow supernatant should be studied for its clinical utility as an assay for the interaction between the epithelial and bone compartments, and it supports the existence of androgen-independent pathways of PSA regulation by the bone marrow supernatant of patients with advanced prostate cancer. If confirmed, these findings would support the use of bone marrow supernatant to study the osseous specific progression of prostate cancer.""","""['J T Hsieh', 'H C Wu', 'Y Wang', 'W T Song', 'W Li', 'L Finn', 'C J Logothetis']""","""[]""","""1995""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'LNCaP progression model of human prostate cancer: androgen-independence and osseous metastasis.', 'Suramin-induced decrease in prostate-specific antigen expression with no effect on tumor growth in the LNCaP model of human prostate cancer.', 'Human prostate cancer progression models and therapeutic intervention.', 'The utility of prostate-specific antigen in the management of advanced prostate cancer.']"""

In the future, a significant further increase in the incidence of prostate cancer is expected. The indication to perform a prostate biopsy is digital rectal examination suspicious for prostate cancer, total prostate specific antigen (PSA) value, free PSA/total PSA ratio, PSA density and PSA velocity, and an evidence of hypoechoic area at transrectal ultrasound scan. Unfortunately the specificity and sensibility are still poor. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the specificity and sensibility of real time elastography versus ultrasound transrectal B-mode scan.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 108 pts. having undergone TRUS-guided transrectal prostate biopsy (10 samples). The indication for biopsy is: digital rectal examination, total prostate specific antigen (PSA) value, PSA ratio, PSA density and PSA velocity suspicious for prostate cancer, and/or an evidence of hypoechoic area at transrectal ultrasound scan, and/or hard area at real-time elastography. The mean age of patients is 66.8 years, mean PSA 6.5 ng/mL, and mean ratio 16.5%. We compared the histopathological findings of needle prostate biopsies with the results of transrectal ultrasound and transrectal real-time elastography.  Results:   32/108 (29.6%) pts. were positive for prostate cancer (mean Gleason score 7.08), mean PSA 14 ng/mL and mean ratio 9.5%. Transrectal ultrasound scan shows a sensibility of 69% and specificity of 68%. Transrectal ultrasound scan shows a VPP of 51.4%. Transrectal ultrasound scan shows a VPN of 80.9%. Real-time elastography shows a sensibility of 56% and specificity of 85.7%. Real-time elastography shows a VPP of 60.1%. Real-time elastography shows a VPN of 83%.

Also, we report that Fyn, which forms a complex with CDCP1 and mediates its signaling to PKCδ, is a HIF-1 target gene. Mechanistically, we found that CDCP1 specifically regulates phosphorylation of PKCδ, but not of focal adhesion kinase or Crk-associated substrate. Signal transduction from CDCP1 to PKCδ leads to its activation, increasing migration of CC-RCC. Furthermore, patient survival can be stratified by CDCP1 expression at the cell surface of the tumor.

Monocytes continuously extravasate from the bloodstream into tumors where they differentiate into macrophages and accumulate in hypoxic areas, thereby opening up the possibility of using these cells as vehicles to deliver gene therapy to these otherwise inaccessible sites. We describe a new cell-based method that selectively targets an oncolytic adenovirus to hypoxic areas of prostate tumors. In this approach, macrophages were cotransduced with a hypoxia-regulated E1A/B construct and an E1A-dependent oncolytic adenovirus, whose proliferation is restricted to prostate tumor cells using prostate-specific promoter elements from the TARP, PSA, and PMSA genes. When such cotransduced cells reach an area of extreme hypoxia, the E1A/B proteins are expressed, thereby activating replication of the adenovirus. The virus is subsequently released by the host macrophage and infects neighboring tumor cells. Following systemic injection into mice bearing subcutaneous or orthotopic prostate tumors, cotransduced macrophages migrated into hypoxic tumor areas, upregulated E1A protein, and released multiple copies of adenovirus. The virus then infected neighboring cells but only proliferated and was cytotoxic in prostate tumor cells, resulting in the marked inhibition of tumor growth and reduction of pulmonary metastases. This novel delivery system employs 3 levels of tumor specificity: the natural ""homing"" of macrophages to hypoxic tumor areas, hypoxia-induced proliferation of the therapeutic adenovirus in host macrophages, and targeted replication of oncolytic virus in prostate tumor cells.""","""['Munitta Muthana', 'Athina Giannoudis', 'Simon D Scott', 'Hsin-Yu Fang', 'Seth B Coffelt', 'Fiona J Morrow', 'Craig Murdoch', 'Julian Burton', 'Neil Cross', 'Bernard Burke', 'Roshna Mistry', 'Freddie Hamdy', 'Nicola J Brown', 'Lindsay Georgopoulos', 'Peter Hoskin', 'Magnus Essand', 'Claire E Lewis', 'Norman J Maitland']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Etoposide enhances antitumor efficacy of MDR1-driven oncolytic adenovirus through autoupregulation of the MDR1 promoter activity.', 'A novel oncolytic adenovirus targeting Wnt signaling effectively inhibits cancer-stem like cell growth via metastasis, apoptosis and autophagy in HCC models.', 'E1A, E1B double-restricted adenovirus with RGD-fiber modification exhibits enhanced oncolysis for CAR-deficient biliary cancers.', 'Tropism and transduction of oncolytic adenovirus vectors in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Oncolytic Virus as a Novel Modality for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'HSV1716 Prevents Myeloma Cell Regrowth When Combined with Bortezomib In Vitro and Significantly Reduces Systemic Tumor Growth in Mouse Models.', 'Therapy with oncolytic viruses: progress and challenges.', 'Development of a Personalised Device for Systemic Magnetic Drug Targeting to Brain Tumours.', 'Repeated dosing improves oncolytic rhabdovirus therapy in mice via interactions with intravascular monocytes.', 'Inconsistencies in Modeling the Efficacy of the Oncolytic Virus HSV1716 Reveal Potential Predictive Biomarkers for Tolerability.']"""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel (64)Cu-labeled peptide with high receptor binding affinity for PET of EphB4 receptors.  Methods:   The EphB4-binding peptide TNYLFSPNGPIARAW (TNYL-RAW) was conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and DOTA. DOTA-TNYL-RAW was labeled with (64)Cu with high labeling efficiency. The binding affinity of TNYL-RAW and its derivatives to purified recombinant EphB4 was determined using surface plasmon resonance technology. In vitro binding of both FITC-TNYL-RAW and (64)Cu-DOTA-TNYL-RAW to cancer cells was assessed by fluorescent microscopy and a radioactivity count method. In vivo biodistribution and small-animal PET/CT were performed in mice bearing EphB4-expressing CT26 and PC-3M tumors as well as EphB4-negative A549 tumors.  Results:   TNYL-RAW and its derivatives displayed high binding affinity to EphB4, with equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.98-23 nM.

The signal was reduced by removing Ca(2+). DADS-induced Ca(2+) influx was not inhibited by nifedipine, econazole, SK&F96365, and protein kinase C modulators; but was inhibited by aristolochic acid. In Ca(2+)-free medium, pretreatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitors thapsigargin or 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) nearly abolished DADS-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise.

C. Alberti Prostate carcinoma, even at advanced stages, responds in most patients to androgen deprivation therapies, that are able to exploit the androgen-sensitivity of prostate cancer cells. However, more than half of such tumors, within one to three years, escape these treatments, thus progressing to the hormone-refractory condition. Intriguing links between the development of hormone-insensitivity and neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation in prostate carcinoma have been hypothesized. While, some time ago, NE cells have been considered as derived from progenitor neural crest cells, currently are thought to arise, as well as both basal and secretory cells of prostate gland, from common pluripotent stem cells. NE cell are nonproliferative, terminally differentiated, PSA/acid phosphatase and androgen receptor (AR)-negative cells, moreover exhibiting an antiapoptotic phenotype due to survivin expression. They secrete a wide range of peptide hormones and biogenic amine serotonin and express neuronal markers such as chromogranins A, B, C (CgA, B, C) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) together with synaptophysin. The propensity of prostate cancer cells to undergo a transdifferentiation pathway towards NE phenotype is due to several microenvironmental conditions such as androgen depletion (induced by LH-RH analogs or antagonists, antiandrogens, 5-α-reductase inhibitors), ionizing-radiation therapy, adrenergic factors, increase in interleukin-6 signaling cascade. NE differentiation in prostate malignancy arises in three different forms: carcinoid, oat cell carcinoma, focally NE-differentiated conventional tumor. Selective expression of stem cell-associated markers, such as CD44/Oct4A gene, in NE cancerous cells explain their therapy escape together with tumor recurrence and metastasis. Malignant NE cells, although unable to proliferate, increase the proliferation of the neighboring nonneuroendocrine cancer cells, by providing them with hormone peptide-mediated growth paracrine stimuli. Aberrantly activated glutamic acid decarboxylase-independent pathway for production of GABA (γ-amino-butyric acid) appears to be a constant feature of invasive NE tumors. Serum levels of CgA reflect NE differentiation in prostate carcinoma more suitably than those of NSE. Intriguingly, intermittent androgen deprivation therapy, by preventing NE differentiation, significantly reduces the risk of a rise in serum CgA levels meanwhile delaying the time of cancer progression due to hormone-independence. Although valuable insights into the nature of NE differentiation in prostate carcinoma have been achieved in the last decades, additional understanding is needed about its pathogenetic mechanisms in order to devise novel therapy strategies to target them.""","""['C Alberti']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""G Chir""","""['Androgen deprivation induces human prostate epithelial neuroendocrine differentiation of androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells.', 'The neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate cancer: basic and clinical aspects.', 'Acquisition of neuroendocrine characteristics by prostate tumor cells is reversible: implications for prostate cancer progression.', 'New perspective in the management of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Androgen deprivation of the PC-310 correction of prohormone convertase-310 human prostate cancer model system induces neuroendocrine differentiation.', 'Rare paraneoplastic syndrome of prostatic cancer: limbic encephalitis: a case report.', 'Targeting Wnt/EZH2/microRNA-708 signaling pathway inhibits neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'EMT, stemness and tumor plasticity in aggressive variant neuroendocrine prostate cancers.', 'Imaging Somatostatin Receptor Activity in Neuroendocrine-differentiated Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor signaling regulates T-type Ca2+ channel expression and neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer cells.']"""

Methods:   First, in vitro equol binding affinity for 5alpha-DHT was determined using 14C5alpha-DHT combined with cold 5alpha-DHT (3.0 nM in all samples). These steroids were incubated with increasing concentrations of equol (0-2,000 nM) and analyzed by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. 14C5alpha-DHT peak/profiles were determined by scintillation counting of column fractions. Using the 14C5alpha-DHT peak (0 nM equol) as a reference standard, a binding curve was generated by quantifying shifts in the 14C5alpha-DHT peaks as equol concentrations increased. Second, equol's in vitro effects on LNCap cells were determined by culturing cells (48 hours) in the presence of increasing concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vehicle-control), 5alpha-DHT, equol or 5alpha-DHT+equol. Following culture, prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were quantified via ELISA. Finally, the in vivo effects of equol were tested in sixteen male Long-Evans rats fed a low isoflavone diet. From 190-215 days, animals received 0.1 cc s.c. injections of either DMSO-control vehicle (n = 8) or 1.0 mg/kg (body weight) of equol (in DMSO) (n = 8). At 215 days, body and prostate weights were recorded, trunk blood was collected and serum assayed for luteinizing hormone (LH), 5alpha-DHT, testosterone and 17beta-estradiol levels.  Results:   Maximum and half maximal equol binding to 5alpha-DHT occurred at approximately 100 nM and 4.8 nM respectively. LNCap cells cultured in the presence of 5alpha-DHT significantly increased PSA levels. However, in the presence of 5alpha-DHT+equol, equol blocked the significant increases in PSA levels from LNCap cells.

Materials and methods:   • Between July 2007 to February 2010, a total of 307 RALPs were performed at our institution by two surgeons. A total of 187 patients operated on by surgeon 1 received perioperative heparin prophylaxis, whereas 120 patients operated on by surgeon 2 did not receive any. • All demographic, clinical and pathological data were prospectively recorded, whereas the incidence of venous thromboembolism within 30 days of the operation was retrospectively reviewed. Evaluation for potential VTE was based on clinical symptoms.  Results:   • Cohorts were comparable with respect to PSA, clinical stage, preoperative Gleason score, body mass index, smoking status, pathological stage, path Gleason score and margin status. A total of two thromboemoblic events occurred (0.6%) within 30 days of surgery (one in each arm of the study). • Heparin prophylaxis did not influence estimated blood loss (P= 0.076) or haematocrit change from preoperative levels (P= 0.378). Length of stay was comparable between the two groups (1.4 vs 1.3 days; P= 0.159).

The main aim of this study was to investigate the best gossypol application with irradiation, when gossypol was applied either sequentially (24 h before and after irradiation) or concurrently in PC-3 hormone-refractory and radioresistant prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The XTT viability assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of different concentrations of gossypol in PC- 3 cells. Irradiation was applied to PC-3 cells via 6 MV photon linear accelerator and delivered 24 h before, 24 h after radiation or at the same time with gossypol administration.  Results:   gossypol caused radiosensitization of PC-3 cells that are known to be radioresistant, with high Bcl-2 levels. Among different applications of gossypol and irradiation (before, after and concurrent) in prostate cancer cells, the best results were observed by the application of gossypol 24 h before irradiation.

In the present study, we examined whether DIM inhibits the development of prostate cancer using the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. DIM feeding inhibited prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP mice, reduced the number of cells expressing the SV40 large tumor antigen and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and increased the number of terminal dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells in the dorsolateral lobes of the prostate. Additionally, DIM feeding reduced the expression of cyclin A, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2, CDK4, and Bcl-xL, and increased p27 and Bax expression. To assess the mechanisms by which DIM induces apoptosis, LNCaP and DU145 human prostate cancer cells were cultured with various concentrations of DIM. DIM induced a substantial reduction in the numbers of viable cells and induced apoptosis in LNCaP and DU145 cells. DIM increased the cleavage of caspase-9, -7, -3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). DIM increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and the translocation of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo from the mitochondria. Additionally, DIM induced increases in the levels of cleaved caspase-8, truncated Bid, Fas, and Fas ligand, and the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK was shown to mitigate DIM-induced apoptosis and the cleavage of caspase-3, PARP, and Bid.

However, incidence, survival, and practice patterns have been changing for the majority of cancers.  Methods:   Cancer prevalence was estimated and projected by phase of care (initial year following diagnosis, continuing, and last year of life) and tumor site for 13 cancers in men and 16 cancers in women through 2020. Cancer prevalence was calculated from cancer incidence and survival models estimated from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data. Annualized net costs were estimated from recent SEER-Medicare linkage data, which included claims through 2006 among beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with a cancer diagnosis. Control subjects without cancer were identified from a 5% random sample of all Medicare beneficiaries residing in the SEER areas to adjust for expenditures not related to cancer. All cost estimates were adjusted to 2010 dollars. Different scenarios for assumptions about future trends in incidence, survival, and cost were assessed with sensitivity analysis.  Results:   Assuming constant incidence, survival, and cost, we projected 13.8 and 18.1 million cancer survivors in 2010 and 2020, respectively, with associated costs of cancer care of 124.57 and 157.77 billion 2010 US dollars. This 27% increase in medical costs reflects US population changes only. The largest increases were in the continuing phase of care for prostate cancer (42%) and female breast cancer (32%). Projections of current trends in incidence (declining) and survival (increasing) had small effects on 2020 estimates. However, if costs of care increase annually by 2% in the initial and last year of life phases of care, the total cost in 2020 is projected to be $173 billion, which represents a 39% increase from 2010.  Conclusions:   The national cost of cancer care is substantial and expected to increase because of population changes alone.

Objective:   Our objective was to determine whether dietary zinc assessed near the time of prostate cancer diagnosis is associated with improved disease-specific survival.  Design:   This population-based cohort consists of 525 men aged <80 y from Örebro County, Sweden, with a diagnosis of prostate cancer made between 1989 and 1994.

This study focuses on the potential carcinogenic effects of the prosthesis; it is a long-term follow-up of all patients in Sweden between 1975 and 2006.  Methods:   The incidence of cancer in a total population of operated individuals was compared to the overall national cancer incidence in Sweden by means of standardised incidence ratios. Analysis of cancer latency period was performed to identify potential aetiological factors.  Results:   For male and female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA), the overall cancer risks were elevated, ranging from 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.18) for men with OA to 1.26 (1.23-1.29) for men with RA. The greatest increases in risk were observed for the leukaemia subtypes, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and essential thrombocytosis (ET), ranging from 3.31 (1.24-8.83) for ET in men with OA to 7.38 (1.85-29.51) for ET in women with RA. Increases in risk were also observed for breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma. The latency analysis revealed elevated risks late in the study period for both solid and haematopoietic cancers. However, only increases in MDS and possibly prostate cancer and melanoma rates appeared to be connected to the operation.  Conclusion:   This study showed that OA and RA arthroplasty patients have a significantly higher risk of cancer than the general population. Elevated risks of MDS and possibly prostate cancer and melanoma indicated a potential connection to exposure to metals in the implant. The observed excessive incidence of ET was likely associated with the inflammatory disease.""","""['Philippe Wagner', 'Håkan Olsson', 'Lars Lidgren', 'Otto Robertsson', 'Jonas Ranstam']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Incidence of cancer among patients with knee implants in Sweden, 1980-1994.', 'Do rheumatoid arthritis and lymphoma share risk factors?: a comparison of lymphoma and cancer risks before and after diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Occupation and cancer - follow-up of 15 million people in five Nordic countries.', 'Familial prostate cancer in Sweden.

A novel model for prediction of adverse pathologic outcomes was developed using preoperative characteristics.  Patients and methods:   Between 2003 and 2007, 1159 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) at our institution. GL 6 prostate cancer in one or two biopsy cores was identified in 416 (36%) patients. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the rate of GL ≥7 and/or extraprostatic extension at RARP. Covariates consisted of age, body mass index (BMI), number of positive cores, greatest percent of cancer in a core (GPC), clinical stage, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. After backward variable selection, the developed model was internally validated using the area under the curve and subjected to methods of calibration.  Results:   Respectively, 278 (67%) and 138 (33%) patients had one or two positive biopsy cores. At RARP, 90 (22%) patients were upgraded to GL ≥7 and 37 (9%) had extraprostatic extension. The novel model relied on age, BMI, preoperative PSA level, and GPC for prediction of adverse pathologic outcomes and was 69% accurate. Calibration plot revealed a virtually perfect relationship between predicted and observed probabilities.  Conclusions:   In patients with GL 6 prostate cancer in one or two biopsy cores, 25% have more ominous pathology at RARP. The model provides an individual assessment of adverse outcomes at surgery.

The microcapsules are based on negatively charged poly(methacrylic acid) nanometer thin films containing cross-linking disulfide bonds. One system is polycation-free and another contains polylysine for siRNA complexation in the microcapsule void. When microcapsules containing a siRNA targeting survivin were delivered to PC-3 prostate cancer cells, a significant inhibition of the expression of the antiapoptotic protein was observed. However, down-regulation of survivin was also observed in PC-3 cells exposed to microcapsules embedded with a scrambled siRNA as well as in cells treated with empty microcapsules. These findings indicate a capsule-dependent off-target effect, which is supported by a reduction in the expression of other survivin-unrelated proteins. The microcapsules and their polymeric constituents do not affect cell proliferation, as determined by a metabolic assay, even after 4 days of exposure. In addition, in PC-3 cells exposed to microcapsules, we observed a marked accumulation of LC3b, a marker related to autophagy (i.e., self-digestion), a degradation pathway involved in the maintenance of cell homeostasis in response to different stresses.

Recent studies indicating that the p75(NTR) can transduce signals that induce apoptosis suggest that diminished p75(NTR) in transformed prostate cells may contribute to immortalization. Mutations in the transmembrane domain of the p75(NTR) gene have been associated with decreased p75(NTR) protein expression and may block the ability of the p75(NTR) to induce apoptosis. Therefore, we used Western blot to analyze prostate cancer (PC) cell lines for p75(NTR) protein expression and gene single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing to analyze mutations in the transmembrane domain of the p75(NTR). p75(NTR) Protein was present in all cell lines, and mutations in the p75(NTR) gene were not detected in cDNA derived from any cell line. To define the expression pattern of p75(NTR) in PCs in vivo, we used immunohistochemical techniques to examine tissue specimens from 20 benign, 19 malignant primary, and 14 metastatic prostate specimens. In benign prostate tissues, expression of p75(NTR) was universally detected in basal cells but not in secretory epithelial or stromal cells. In both primary and metastatic PC tissues, p75(NTR) immunoreactivity could not be detected in malignant prostate epithelial cells. However, in contrast to the benign prostate, p75(NTR) protein was expressed in stromal cells surrounding malignant epithelial cells. Stromal p75(NTR) expression was present in 84% (16 of 19) primary and in 86% (12 of 14) metastatic specimens. These data show that in the benign prostate p75(NTR) protein is expressed by basal cells and not stromal cells whereas in malignant prostate p75(NTR) protein is expressed by stromal cells but not prostatic carcinoma cells.

The origin of this cell type and the reason for their appearance in prostate tumors remains unresolved. Previously, Bang et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1994;91:5330) reported that dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate (db-cAMP), an agent that upregulates intracellular cAMP, was able to induce a NE cell-like phenotype of cultured human prostate cancer cells, including the androgen-sensitive LNCaP line. Here we report that chronic incubation of LNCaP cells in a medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (CSFBS) likewise induces NE differentiation of these cells. Within 5 days of switching low density cultures of LNCaP cells to this modified medium, the cells growth arrest and acquire an altered morphology with numerous cytoplasmic secretory granules and elongated processes that resemble cultured neurons. This morphology predominates at 10 days with complete transformation seen by 20 days of culture. Electron microscopic analysis of sections of CS-FBS maintained cells showed the presence of abundant dense core secretory granules characteristic of NE cells. Immunohistochemical staining identified the upregulation of the expression of NE markers bombesin, neuron-specific enolase, and S-100 in this modified culture medium. Once established, the NE cell-like phenotype was found to be reversible upon replacement with a medium containing unmodified fetal bovine serum, but not by direct supplementation of CS-FBS medium with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (I nM). DHT supplementation did, however, suppress the development of the NE cell-like phenotype when it was present at the initiation of exposure to CS-FBS medium. In contrast to db-cAMP treatment, which did not affect prostate specific antigen (PSA) or androgen receptor (AR) expression of LNCaP cells, NE-differentiated LNCaP cells derived in this hormone-deficient medium showed marked downregulation of PSA and AR expression. These in vitro results further support the concept that prostate cancer cells can tranform in vivo to cells with a NE phenotype and suggest that this transformation might be accelerated in patients by certain therapies for prostate cancer.""","""['R Shen', 'T Dorai', 'M Szaboles', 'A E Katz', 'C A Olsson', 'R Buttyan']""","""[]""","""1997""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Acquisition of neuroendocrine characteristics by prostate tumor cells is reversible: implications for prostate cancer progression.', 'Multipathways for transdifferentiation of human prostate cancer cells into neuroendocrine-like phenotype.', 'Transdifferentiation of prostate cancer cells to a neuroendocrine cell phenotype in vitro and in vivo.', 'Neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer cells: neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma cells.', 'The neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate cancer: basic and clinical aspects.', 'Establishment of the LNCaP Cell Line - The Dawn of an Era for Prostate Cancer Research.', 'ETS transcription factor ELF3 (ESE-1) is a cell cycle regulator in benign and malignant prostate.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Narrative review of challenges in the management of advanced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'SLX4IP Promotes Telomere Maintenance in Androgen Receptor-Independent Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer through ALT-like Telomeric PML Localization.']"""

The results showed that taxol inhibited DNA synthesis and induced apoptosis in all tumors. The taxol-induced DNA inhibition and the apoptotic index increased with drug concentration, but reached a maximal plateau level at a concentration between 120 and 1,200 nM. Increasing the concentration by 10- to 100-fold to 12,000 nM did not significantly increase either effect. To address the existing controversy regarding the effect of treatment duration on cytotoxicity, we evaluated two treatment schedules, (i.e., 24 and 96 hours). Prolonging the treatment time from 24 to 96 hours significantly increased the average maximal inhibition of DNA synthesis (E(max)) from 47% to 70% (p < 0.001) and reduced the incidence of relatively resistant tumors (E(max) < 30%) from 31% to 0% (p = 0.04). By contrast, the prolonged treatment time did not increase the apoptotic effect (p = 0.48).

Initially, we established the bicalutamide-resistant subline CDX25R from the androgen receptor (AR)-positive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP through continuous exposure to bicalutamide. CDX25R cells lost the ability to respond to androgens, but still expressed AR. They showed significant resistance to bicalutamide, but had high sensitivity to hydroxyflutamide (OH-flutamide) compared with LNCaP cells. The CDX25R subline was thus considered to be a suitable model for prostate cancer that has developed resistance to first-line hormonal therapy but shows sensitivity to an alternative approach. Combined treatment with 5-FU and OH-flutamide had a synergistic effect on CDX25R cells. OH-flutamide decreased expression of the transcription factor E2F1, and subsequently of thymidylate synthase (TS), in CDX25R cells but not in AR-negative DU145 cells. This suggested that OH-flutamide enhanced the growth-inhibitory activity of 5-FU in CDX25R cells by reducing TS expression through the AR pathway.

Screening rates were 56% at ages 50-64, 68% at ages 65-79 and 64% among men age 80 and older. Adjusted analyses indicated that age, income, marital status, possessing health insurance and a personal health care provider, and talking with a provider about prostate cancer screening tests were all positively associated with screening status. In the physician survey, most physicians recommend screening to their average-risk male patients. Three-fourths (74%) of physicians discussed benefits and risks of PSA testing with their patients; but few used educational tools. Only 35% discussed the side effects of prostate cancer treatment with their patients. The rates of screening reported by men were relatively high, given that current recommendations promote informed decision making rather than universal screening.

In this study, we report that HDAC4 binds to and inhibits the activity of the AR. This inhibition was found to depend on the SUMOylation, instead of deacetylation, of the AR. Consistently, HDAC4 increases the level of AR SUMOylation in both whole-cell and cell-free assay systems, raising the possibility that the deacetylase may act as an E3 ligase for AR SUMOylation. Knock down of HDAC4 increases the activity of endogenous AR and androgen induction of prostate-specific antigen expression and prostate cancer cell growth, which is associated with decreased SUMOylation of the receptor.

Objective:   The objective of the present study was to understand the regret that patients report following a RP and the influencing factors for their regret.  Methods:   Patients who had a diagnosis of prostate cancer and who underwent a RP between 2004 and 2010 were recruited for this study. The data gathered included a regret scale; the University of California, Los Angeles, Prostate Cancer Index; and demographic and disease-related information.  Results:   A total of 100 patients participated in our study. Of those who participated, 31% regretted that they had received an RP. Stepwise regression showed that the following 5 variables were predictors of patient regret after an RP: whether the patient would choose to have an RP again, understanding the treatment and complications, bothersome adverse sexual effects, age, and bothersome adverse bowel effects.  Conclusion:   We found that 31% of the participants reported experiencing regret after receiving an RP. Our data suggest that urologists and nurses should carefully portray the risks and benefits of RPs during preoperative counseling to minimize patient regret and maximize patient satisfaction.  Implications for practice:   Patient regret after an RP is common. Urological nurses should therefore counsel patients regarding the impacts of complications associated with RPs and seek appropriate nursing interventions to reduce patient regret following an RP.""","""['Yu-Hua Lin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""['Regret in Surgical Decision Making: A Systematic Review of Patient and Physician Perspectives.', 'Quality of life, sexual function and decisional regret at 1 year after surgical treatment for localized prostate cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life and satisfaction with care among older men treated for prostate cancer with either radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy.', 'Regret in men treated for localized prostate cancer.', 'Why do patients regret their prostate cancer treatment?

Recently, nuclear compartmentalization of PTEN was found as a key component of its tumor-suppressive activity; however its nuclear function remains poorly defined. Here we show that nuclear PTEN interacts with APC/C, promotes APC/C association with CDH1, and thereby enhances the tumor-suppressive activity of the APC-CDH1 complex. We find that nuclear exclusion but not phosphatase inactivation of PTEN impairs APC-CDH1. This nuclear function of PTEN provides a straightforward mechanistic explanation for the fail-safe cellular senescence response elicited by acute PTEN loss and the tumor-suppressive activity of catalytically inactive PTEN. Importantly, we demonstrate that PTEN mutant and PTEN null states are not synonymous as they are differentially sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of APC-CDH1 targets such as PLK1 and Aurora kinases. This finding identifies a strategy for cancer patient stratification and, thus, optimization of targeted therapies.

Gene expression data has a special characteristic that there is a mismatch in gene dimension as opposed to sample dimension. All genes do not contribute for efficient classification of samples. A robust feature selection algorithm is required to identify the important genes which help in classifying the samples efficiently. In order to select informative genes (features) based on relevance and redundancy characteristics, many feature selection algorithms have been introduced in the past. Most of the earlier algorithms require computationally expensive search strategy to find an optimal feature subset. Existing feature selection methods are also sensitive to the evaluation measures. The paper introduces a novel and efficient feature selection approach based on statistically defined effective range of features for every class termed as ERGS (Effective Range based Gene Selection). The basic principle behind ERGS is that higher weight is given to the feature that discriminates the classes clearly.

Methods:   We produced pCX-shh-IG mice that overexpress Hedgehog protein persistently in adult prostates, allowing for elucidation of the mechanism during prostate cancer initiation and progression. Various markers were used to characterize and confirm the transformation of normal prostate basal/stem cells into malignant cancer stem cells under the influence of Hedgehog overexpression.  Results:   The pCX-shh-IG mice developed prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) that led to invasive and metastatic prostate cancers within 90 days. The prostate cancer was initiated through activation of P63+ basal/stem cells along with simultaneous activation of Hedgehog signalling members, suggesting that P63+/Patch1+ and P63+/Smo+ cells may serve as cancer-initiating cells and progress into malignant prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs). In the hyperplastic lesions and tumors, the progeny of PCSCs differentiated into cells of basal-intermediate and intermediate-luminal characteristics, whereas rare ChgA+ neuroendocrine differentiation was seen. Furthermore, in the metastatic loci within lymph nodes, kidneys, and lungs, the P63+ PCSCs formed prostate-like glandular structures, characteristic of the primitive structures during early prostate development. Besides, androgen receptor (AR) expression was detected heterogeneously during tumor progression. The existence of P63+/AR-, CK14+/AR- and CD44+/AR- progeny indicates direct procurement of AR- malignant cancer trait.  Conclusions:   These data support a cancer stem cell scenario in which Hedgehog signalling plays important roles in transforming normal prostate basal/stem cells into PCSCs and in the progression of PCSCs into metastatic tumor cells.""","""['Han-Hsin Chang', 'Bo-Yie Chen', 'Chia-Yung Wu', 'Zih-Jay Tsao', 'Ying-Yu Chen', 'Chin-Pao Chang', 'Chi-Rei Yang', 'David Pei-Cheng Lin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biomed Sci""","""['Gli Transcription Factors Mediate the Oncogenic Transformation of Prostate Basal Cells Induced by a Kras-Androgen Receptor Axis.', 'Sonic hedgehog signaling is associated with resistance to zoledronic acid in CD133high/CD44high prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: do they have a basal or luminal phenotype?', 'New insights into prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Cancer Stem Cells and Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Drug and apoptosis resistance in cancer stem cells: a puzzle with many pieces.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Tol suppressed the specificity protein 1 (Sp1) protein in both PC-3 and DU145 cells.

Tol also downregulated protein levels, mRNA levels and promoter activities of survivin and myeloid cell leukemia-1, which are downstream targets of Sp1. The expressions of survivin and Mcl-1 and cancer cell growth were lower in the PC-3 cells treated with Sp1 interfering RNA and mithramycin A. Moreover, an oral injection of Tol decreased tumor growth and downregulated the Sp1 protein in athymic nude mice bearing DU145 cell xenografts without hepatotoxicity.

Design, setting and participants:   Descriptive study of state-wide population-based data from the Queensland Cancer Registry on patients aged 15-89 years who were diagnosed with invasive cancer between 1982 and 2007.  Main outcome measure:   Conditional 5-year relative survival for the 13 most common types of invasive cancer, and all cancers combined.  Results:   The prognosis for patients with cancer generally improves with each additional year that they survive. A significant excess in mortality compared with the general population ceases to occur within 10 years after diagnosis for survivors of stomach, colorectal, cervical and thyroid cancer and melanoma, with these groups having a conditional 5-year relative survival of at least 95% after 10 years. For the remaining cancers we studied (pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukaemia), conditional 5-year relative survival estimates (at 10 years after diagnosis) ranged from 82% to 94%, suggesting that patients in these cohorts continue to have poorer survival compared with the age-matched general population.  Conclusions:   Estimates of conditional survival have the potential to provide useful information for cancer clinicians, patients and their carers as they are confronted by personal and surveillance-related decisions. This knowledge may be effective in building realistic hope and helping people manage uncertainty about the future.

Methods:   We evaluated 1,395 RP pathology reports from our center between 1980 and 2006. All patients who underwent (neo)-adjuvant therapy were excluded, leaving a cohort of 1,009 patients, with 249 (24.7%) subjects having a PSM at RP of whom 29.4% had multiple PSMs (≥ 2 sites), while 13.6% had bilateral PSMs. Median follow-up was 40 months (range 0-258 months). We used BCR-free survival as the primary study outcome. BCR was defined as any rise in PSA above or equal to 0.2 ng/ml.  Results:   Of patients with a PSM status, 41% (95% CI: 33-49%) developed BCR within 5 years, compared to 12% (95% CI: 9-15%) in the population without a PSM. Multivariable analysis identified PSA at diagnosis and RP Gleason score as independent predictive factors for BCR. Increasing number and/or bilaterality of PSM did not lead to significant higher rates of BCR.  Conclusion:   In patients with a PSM, the number of positive sites or bilaterality of PSM status does not add prognostic information for risk of BCR.

We report here that the chemopreventive agent curcumin from the rhizome of Curcuma longa was able to affect cell proliferation of androgen-dependent prostate cancer through the induction of cell cycle arrest in G2 and modulation of Wnt signaling. Curcumin decreases the level of Tcf-4, CBP and p300 proteins implicated in the Wnt transcriptional complex that leads to the decrease of ß-catenin/Tcf-4 transcriptional activity and of the expression of ß-catenin target genes (cyclin D1 and c-myc). Subsequent cell death induction is linked to autophagy. Interestingly, in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, curcumin does not affect Wnt/ß-catenin transcriptional activity.

MSMB and CRISP3 protein expressions were assessed on tissue microarrays constructed from 3268 radical prostatectomy specimens. Whole-slide digital images were captured, and a novel cytoplasmic algorithm was used to develop a quantitative scoring model for cytoplasmic staining. Classification regression tree analysis was used to group patients, with different risk for biochemical recurrence, depending on level of protein expression. Patients with tumors expressing high levels of MSMB had a significantly reduced risk for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (HR=0.468; 95% CI 0.394-0.556; P<0.001). Multivariate analysis adjusted for clinicopathological parameters revealed that MSMB expression was an independent predictor of decreased risk of recurrence (HR=0.710; 95% CI 0.578-0.872; P<0.001).

Enhancing patient knowledge through education can significantly reduce feelings of uncertainty while simultaneously increasing confidence in decision making. Serious games have been shown in other populations to increase health knowledge and assist with the health decision-making process. We developed an interactive serious game, Time After Time, which translates evidence-based treatment outcome data into an accessible and understandable format that men can utilize in their prostate cancer treatment decision-making process. The game specifically aims to raise men's awareness and understanding of the impact of health-related quality of life issues associated with the major treatment options and to enrich their conversations with their health care providers.  Objective:   This study determined the acceptability and usability of the alpha version of Time After Time, an interactive decision aid for men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, in order to inform future iterations of the serious game.  Methods:   The study employed a mixed methods approach to assess the acceptability and usability of the Time After Time serious game using qualitative focus groups and a quantitative Likert scale survey.  Results:   A total of 13 men who had already completed treatment for localized prostate cancer completed the survey and participated in focus group meetings. The majority of the study participants rated Time After Time as an appropriate decision tool for localized prostate cancer and verified that it meets its goals of increasing focus on side effects and generating questions for the patient's health care team. However, participants also expressed concerns about game usability and the diversity of information covered regarding treatment options and potential treatment outcomes.  Conclusions:   Serious games are a promising approach to health education and decision support for older men.

An understanding of the treated natural history of screen detected cancers and the pathological risk factors for prostate cancer specific mortality are needed for treatment decision making.  Materials and methods:   Using Fine and Gray competing risk regression analysis we modeled clinical and pathological data, and followup information on 11,521 patients treated with radical prostatectomy at a total of 4 academic centers from 1987 to 2005 to predict prostate cancer specific mortality. The model was validated on 12,389 patients treated at a separate institution during the same period. Median followup in the modeling and validation cohorts was 56 and 96 months, respectively.  Results:   The overall 15-year prostate cancer specific mortality rate was 7%. Primary and secondary Gleason grade 4-5 (each p<0.001), seminal vesicle invasion (p<0.001) and surgery year (p=0.002) were significant predictors of prostate cancer specific mortality. A nomogram predicting 15-year prostate cancer specific mortality based on standard pathological parameters was accurate and discriminating with an externally validated concordance index of 0.92. When stratified by patient age at diagnosis, the 15-year prostate cancer specific mortality rate for pathological Gleason score 6 or less, 3+4, 4+3 and 8-10 was 0.2% to 1.2%, 4.2% to 6.5%, 6.6% to 11% and 26% to 37%, respectively. The 15-year prostate cancer specific mortality risk was 0.8% to 1.5%, 2.9% to 10%, 15% to 27% and 22% to 30% for organ confined cancer, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node metastasis, respectively. Only 3 of 9,557 patients with organ confined, pathological Gleason score 6 or less cancer died of prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Poorly differentiated cancer and seminal vesicle invasion are the prime determinants of prostate cancer specific mortality after radical prostatectomy.

Materials and methods:   A total of 77,536 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1997 and 2006 were identified in PCBaSe Sweden from the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden. Logistic, Cox and competing risk regression were used to assess associations among Charlson comorbidity index, treatment and mortality. The Charlson comorbidity index was categorized into no (0), mild (1) and severe comorbidity (2+).  Results:   In men with low risk prostate cancer 5,975 of the 13,245 (45.1%) patients without comorbidity underwent radical prostatectomy compared to 256 of the 1,399 (18.9%) men with severe comorbidity. Following adjustment for age and period of diagnosis, radical prostatectomy was less likely to be offered to men with severe comorbidity (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.41-0.55). In men with high risk prostate cancer, radiotherapy was more common (range 7.7% to 21.3%) than radical prostatectomy (range 3.0% to 11.2%) regardless of comorbidity burden. All cause and competing cause but not prostate cancer specific mortality were increased in men with severe comorbidity (all cause HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.93-2.05; competing cause sHR 2.66, 95% CI 2.56-2.78; prostate cancer specific sHR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93-1.03). The cumulative probability of prostate cancer death given no death from competing causes was significantly higher in men with severe comorbidity in all risk groups (p<0.01).  Conclusions:   Comorbidity affects treatment choices, and is associated with all cause, competing cause and conditional prostate cancer specific mortality. An increased conditional prostate cancer specific mortality in men with severe comorbidity may reflect less aggressive treatment, impaired tumor defense, lifestyle factors and poor general health behavior.""","""['Anders Berglund', 'Hans Garmo', 'Carol Tishelman', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Pär Stattin', 'Mats Lambe']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Editorial comment.', 'Psychiatric treatment in men with prostate cancer--results from a Nation-wide, population-based cohort study from PCBaSe Sweden.', 'Impact of comorbidity on survival of Danish prostate cancer patients, 1995-2006: a population-based cohort study.', 'Effects of prostate-specific antigen testing on familial prostate cancer risk estimates.', 'Familial prostate cancer in Sweden.

We determined the best interval in which prostate specific antigen acceleration can be calculated with the best result in terms of specificity and sensitivity for prostate cancer diagnosis.  Materials and methods:   Entered in the study were 741 men who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy with 12 or more cores and at least 3 prior consecutive prostate specific antigen measurements in at least 365 days. Prostate specific antigen acceleration was calculated as the slope of log prostate specific antigen vs time using a minimum of 3 prostate specific antigen measurements. Acceleration was evaluated at different intervals, including within 1 year (365 days), 2 years (730 days), 3 years (1,095 days), 4 years (1,460 days), 5 years (1,825 days) and 6 years (2,190 days) before the last measurement.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR4 gene, such as +896A/G, known to attenuate receptor signaling, have been described. The +896A/G SNP is significantly less frequent in patients with myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease or prostate cancer, whereas it is overrepresented in centenarians. To clarify and confirm the biological effects of +896A/G SNP and its role in the pathophysiology of age-related diseases and longevity, we assessed the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10 and eicosanoids (LTB4 and PGE2) in LPS-stimulated whole blood samples in vitro of 50 young healthy Sicilians, screened for the presence of this SNP. To evaluate the possible influence of SNPs in PTGS2 and 5-Lo genes on eicosanoid production, the enrolled individuals were also genotyped for -765G/C PTGS2 and -1708G/A 5-Lo SNPs. Both pro-inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids were significantly lower in carriers bearing the TLR4 mutation, whereas the anti-inflammatory IL-10 values were higher. On the basis of data reported herein, some suggestions can be drawn. First, pathogen load, by interacting with the host genotype, determines the type and intensity of inflammatory responses, according to the pro-inflammatory status and tissue injury, implicated in the pathophysiology of major age-related diseases. Second, adequate control of inflammatory response might reduce the risk of these diseases, and, reciprocally, might increase the chance of extended survival in an environment with reduced antigen (that is, pathogen) load.""","""['Carmela Rita Balistreri', 'Calogero Caruso', 'Florinda Listì', 'Giuseppina Colonna-Romano', 'Domenico Lio', 'Giuseppina Candore']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mech Ageing Dev""","""['Role of TLR4 polymorphisms in inflammatory responses: implications for unsuccessful aging.', 'Inflammation, longevity, and cardiovascular diseases: role of polymorphisms of TLR4.', 'Pre- and postoperative cytokine release after in vitro whole blood lipopolysaccharide stimulation and frequent toll-like receptor 4 polymorphisms.', 'Impact of Toll-like receptor 4 polymorphisms on risk of cancer.', 'Genetic variants and the risk for invasive mould disease in immunocompromised hematology patients.', 'SARS CoV2 infection _The longevity study perspectives.', ""TLR4 Cross-Talk With NLRP3 Inflammasome and Complement Signaling Pathways in Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Young and aged TLR4 deficient mice show sex-dependent enhancements in spatial memory and alterations in interleukin-1 related genes.', 'Cardiovascular Disease in Ageing: An Overview on Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm as an Emerging Inflammatory Disease.', 'Can the TLR-4-mediated signaling pathway be ""a key inflammatory promoter for sporadic TAA""?']"""

Methods:   All senior social and housing centers in El Paso, TX were randomized to intervention, a group-based Spanish language educational program facilitated by promotores (12 centers; 161 men) [I's], or to control, promotores-facilitated diabetes video and discussion (13 centers; 160 men) [C's].  Results:   Participants had low levels of schooling and baseline knowledge; 44% reported previous PSA testing. At post-test, the I's made large knowledge gains, increased their understanding that experts disagree about testing, shifted toward more active decision making roles, were more likely to believe that it is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of screening and to anticipate potential screening outcomes in making a decision, and were less likely to consider the screening decision easy. The I's did not change in their screening intention or the belief that choosing not to be screened could be a responsible choice.  Conclusions:   A community-based intervention to support IDM for prostate cancer screening can increase knowledge and may promote more active involvement in decision making about prostate cancer screening.

Methods and materials:   A prospective Phase I-II study of patients with any of the following: clinical Stage T3 disease, prostate-specific antigen level ≥ 20 ng/mL, or Gleason score 8-10. A dose of 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) was delivered to the pelvic lymph nodes with a concomitant 22.5 Gy prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost, to a total of 67.5 Gy (2.7 Gy/fraction) in 25 fractions within 5 weeks. Image guidance was performed using three gold seed fiducials.

To identify biological pathways likely to be affected by methylation-mediated alterations in gene expression in prostate cancer, we performed a genome-wide methylation analysis of 27,578 CpG sites, corresponding to 14,495 genes on a pooled sample of 12 pairs of prostate tumor and adjacent normal tissues. In all, 972 CpG sites were significantly hypermethylated while 209 sites were hypomethylated in prostate tumor tissue (FDR adjusted p-value<0.05; fold change≥2) corresponding to 1043 unique genes, which is consistent with genome-wide gene-specific hypermethylation patterns previously observed in multiple cancer models. Global hypomethylation in prostate tumor was also detected by measuring methylation changes in ALU repeat sequences. Pathway analysis of the genes with altered methylation patterns identifies the involvement of a cancer related network of genes whose activity may be heavily regulated by TNF-α in prostate tumorigenesis. Our results suggest that epigenetic dysregulation of cellular processes relevant to TNF-α-dependent apoptosis and electrophile detoxification may be intimately involved in prostate carcinogenesis.

We report a dual-institution study comparing dosimetric aspects of these two modalities.  Methods and materials:   Eight patients each were selected from the University of Maryland (UMM) and the University of Wisconsin Cancer Center Riverview (UWR), for a total of 16 cases. Four cancer sites including brain, head and neck (HN), lung, and prostate were selected. Single-arc IMAT plans were generated at UMM using Varian RapidArc (RA), and HT plans were generated at UWR using Hi-Art II TomoTherapy. All 16 cases were planned based on the identical anatomic contours, prescriptions, and planning objectives. All plans were swapped for analysis at the same time after final approval. Dose indices for targets and critical organs were compared based on dose-volume histograms, the beam-on time, monitor units, and estimated leakage dose. After the disclosure of comparison results, replanning was done for both techniques to minimize diversity in optimization focus from different operators.  Results:   For the 16 cases compared, the average beam-on time was 1.4 minutes for RA and 4.8 minutes for HT plans. HT provided better target dose homogeneity (7.6% for RA and 4.2% for HT) with a lower maximum dose (110% for RA and 105% for HT). Dose conformation numbers were comparable, with RA being superior to HT (0.67 vs. 0.60). The doses to normal tissues using these two techniques were comparable, with HT showing lower doses for more critical structures. After planning comparison results were exchanged, both techniques demonstrated improvements in dose distributions or treatment delivery times.  Conclusions:   Both techniques created highly conformal plans that met or exceeded the planning goals.

Methods and materials:   Images and IGRT shift results from three different treatment systems (Tomotherapy Hi-Art, Elekta Synergy, Varian Trilogy) have been sent from various institutions to the Image-Guided Therapy QA Center (ITC) for evaluation for the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trials. Nine patient datasets (five head-and-neck and four prostate) were included in the comparison, with each patient having 1-4 daily individual IGRT studies. In all cases, daily shifts were re-calculated by re-registration of the planning CT with the daily IGRT data using three independent software systems (MIMvista, FocalSim, VelocityAI). Automatic fusion was used in all calculations. The results were compared with those submitted from institutions. Similar regions of interest (ROIs) and same initial positions were used in registrations for inter-system comparison. Different slice spacings for CBCT sampling and different ROIs for registration were used in some cases to observe the variation of registration due to these factors.  Results:   For the 54 comparisons with head-and-neck datasets, the absolute values of differences of the registration results between different systems were 2.6±2.1 mm (mean±SD; range 0.1-8.6 mm, left-right [LR]), 1.7±1.3 mm (0.0-4.9 mm, superior-inferior [SI]), and 1.8±1.1 mm (0.1-4.0 mm, anterior-posterior [AP]). For the 66 comparisons in prostate cases, the differences were 1.1±1.0 mm (0.0-4.6 mm, LR), 2.1±1.7 mm (0.0-6.6 mm, SI), and 2.0±1.8 mm (0.1-6.9 mm, AP). The differences caused by the slice spacing variation were relatively small, and the different ROI selections in FocalSim and MIMvista also had limited impact.

This issue is tackled from the perspective of intracellular siRNA kinetics using a novel lipid-based ""nanostructured siRNA carrier"" (NSC), which incorporates variable amount of oil phase into the solid-lipid matrix to modify its siRNA release behaviors. We demonstrate that by manipulating the degradation responses of NSC device to lysosomal enzyme, tailoring of intracellular siRNA kinetics is achievable. A tailored NSC design delivering survivin-siRNA can extend the survivin knockdown period to 9 days, translating into steady, effective in vitro and in vivo chemosensitization of prostate cancer to docetaxel for over a week.

Results:   It was demonstrated that this designed hybrid Antp-TPR peptide inhibited the interaction of Hsp90 with the TPR2A domain, inducing cell death of breast, pancreatic, renal, lung, prostate, and gastric cancer cell lines in vitro. In contrast, Antp-TPR peptide did not affect the viability of normal cells.

Methods:   A total of 100 patients entered a prospective study of IAS. Androgen blockade was prolonged until a serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir was reached and then resumed for a PSA threshold of 10 ng/mL, in repeated cycles. During I phase, we assessed testosterone levels, well-being with quality-of-life score, and sexual function.  Main outcome measures:   All patients were followed up every 3 months with PSA and total testosterone determinations, and with quality-of-life score using a 10-point questionnaire. Side effects were assessed using yes/no questions. Sexual function was assessed using yes/no questions and in the sexually active patients with International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF).  Results:   All patients completed I cycle of treatment (I ON plus I OFF phase). During the OFF phase, 46% of patients showed low testosterone levels, while the others recovered normal testosterone concentrations at a mean of 6.2 months after therapy. There is a negative correlation between baseline PSA values and length of OFF phase and testosterone recovery, and a negative correlation between length of OFF phase and testosterone value during OFF phase. Worsening in Quality of Life (QOL) was significant during active treatment with respect to baseline, but therapy withdrawal showed a positive impact with respect to treatment period. Improvement in quality of life correlated to testosterone recovery and time to testosterone recovery. Fifty-four percent of subjects had normal sexual intercourse at therapy withdrawal, with a correspondence to time to testosterone recovery.

Results:   The study accrued 115 patients and 61 (55%) completed all three IIEF assessments.

However, as few as 21% of patients had a treatment-specific response, only improving during sildenafil but not during the placebo phase.  Conclusions:   This is the first controlled trial to suggest a positive sildenafil response for ED treatment in patients previously treated with RT/ADT, however, only a minority of patients responded to treatment.

The number of relevant webpages was recorded and compared to the prevalence of each cancer according to Cancer Research UK.  Results:   Of the 985,687,623 webpages identified, the majority were related to breast cancer (37.2%), followed by lung (16.2%) and prostate cancer (12.5%).

Arsenic concentration-dependent increased expression of mtTFA and its regulator NRF-1 was observed in arsenic-exposed cells, suggesting that arsenic regulates mitochondrial activity through an NRF-1-dependent pathway. In summary, this study suggests that chronic exposure to arsenic causes DNA damage and increased cell survival that may ultimately result in neoplastic transformation of human prostate epithelial cells. Additionally, this study also provides evidence that arsenic controls mitochondrial function by regulating mtTFA expression.""","""['Kamaleshwar P Singh', 'Ragini Kumari', 'Justin Treas', 'James W DuMond']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Chem Res Toxicol""","""['Human mitochondrial transcription factor A functions in both nuclei and mitochondria and regulates cancer cell growth.', 'MnCl2-induced functional damage of mitochondria in human lung cells in vitro.', 'Mitochondrial transcription factor A regulates BCL2L1 gene expression and is a prognostic factor in serous ovarian cancer.', 'Arsenic carcinogenesis in the skin.', 'Lesions of the mitochondrial genome and ways of its preservation.', 'A Comprehensive Transcriptomic Analysis of Arsenic-Induced Bladder Carcinogenesis.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Arsenic co-carcinogenesis: Inhibition of DNA repair and interaction with zinc finger proteins.', 'Oxygen sensing, mitochondrial biology and experimental therapeutics for pulmonary hypertension and cancer.', 'Mitochondrial HMG-Box Containing Proteins: From Biochemical Properties to the Roles in Human Diseases.']"""

A nationwide observational survey, 'EDIFICE', was conducted by telephone from December 2007 to January 2008 on a representative sample of 600 general practitioners (GPs) working in France, to investigate how a GP's characteristics may influence patient participation in screening for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. For breast cancer screening, systematic recommendation was associated with female physicians [odds ratio (OR) =1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-3.1]. This systematic recommendation was also correlated with systematic referral for colorectal cancer (OR=1.5; 95% CI=1.0-2.5) and prostate cancer screening (OR=2.7; 95% CI=1.8-4.1).

The age of the GP was not associated with a higher rate of systematic recommendation for screening for the three types of cancer. Male GPs were more likely than female GPs to perform digital rectal examinations on male patients (69 vs. 54%; OR=1.86; 95% CI=1.31-2.63). There is a global pattern of physicians being screening-prone (as suggested by the cross impact of recommendations from one cancer type to another). Although the frequency of systematic recommendation for breast cancer screening is higher with female GPs, systematic recommendation for prostate cancer is not higher among male GPs.

The impact of awareness on screening behaviour seems to be greatest for the same cancer location as that in the affected acquaintance, as opposed to cancers at other sites.

In this study, we reported a flexible bead-based immunoassay to measure total PSA (tPSA) and fPSA simultaneously.  Materials and methods:   We used the Luminex xMAP bead array technology to measure tPSA and fPSA at one time, employing two mouse monoclonal anti-PSA antibodies (5G6 and 8A6) for coating and another mouse monoclonal anti-PSA antibody (5A6) for detection. Then we compared the data of Luminex assay with that of the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  Results:   The assay was fast with a wide dynamic range. The lower detection limit for tPSA and fPSA were 2.3 and 1.3 pg/ml. The inter-assay coefficients for tPSA and fPSA were between 5.64 and 7.65%, and the intra-assay coefficients for tPSA and fPSA were between 4.15 and 5.89%.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate all in Austria available patient information materials on PSA-screening with regard to their evidence-based content and their potential to facilitate informed decision-making.  Methods:   To get information materials, we contacted a wide variety of public, industry, and academic institutions, professional organisations, patient advocacy groups, and other organisations that are concerned with prostate cancer screening in Austria. Two persons independently evaluated the quality of each information product based on adapted criteria of the UK (United Kingdom) General Medical Council.  Results:   We evaluated a total of 17 information leaflets. Not a single brochure fulfilled all of the criteria necessary for informed decision-making. More than half fulfilled less than 50% of the recommended criteria. All of the analysed leaflets provided information about the benefits of screening, while only 35% mentioned the possibility of harms caused by screening.

Uptake and internalization of anti-EGFR mAbs (cetuximab) and affibody molecule (Z2377) labeled with indium-111 was investigated.

Breast and prostate cancer are the 2 most common cancers in women and men, respectively. Most previous studies on self-reported attentional fatigue evaluated patients with breast cancer.  Objectives:   The objectives of the study were to determine if self-reported attentional fatigue differed in patients with breast cancer and prostate cancer before radiation therapy (RT) and to determine the relationships between attentional fatigue and other symptoms in these 2 groups.  Methods:   Patients (n = 155) completed questionnaires before RT. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and analysis of covariance were used for data analyses.  Results:   After controlling for age, patients with breast cancer reported significantly higher levels of attentional fatigue. In both groups, more attentional fatigue correlated significantly with more anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and physical fatigue. These correlations were stronger for patients with breast cancer.  Conclusions:   The present study is the first to identify differences in self-reported attentional fatigue between these 2 groups before RT. Additional research is warranted to determine factors that contribute to these differences, as well as mechanisms that underlie the development of attentional fatigue.  Implications for practice:   Clinicians should consider the capacity of their patients to direct attention when learning about RT and other treatments.

Here, we report the first PKC isozyme-specific analysis of global gene expression by microarray using RNAi depletion of diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-regulated PKCs. A thorough analysis of this microarray data revealed unique patterns of gene expression controlled by PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε, which are remarkably different in cells growing in serum or in response to phorbol ester stimulation. PKCδ is the most relevant isoform in controlling the induction of genes by phorbol ester stimulation, whereas PKCε predominantly regulates gene expression in serum. We also established that two PKCδ-regulated genes, FOSL1 and BCL2A1, mediate the apoptotic effect of phorbol esters or the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide in prostate cancer cells.

Treatment of mice with clodronate liposomes significantly decreased the number of TAMs and osteoclasts in the bone tumors, the expression of IL-6 in the PC3-MM2 cells, and the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by TAMs. These findings correlated with a significant decrease in tumor size, bone lysis, and lymph node metastasis.

Getting up 2 or more times at night to urinate was coded as nocturia. Potential factors included age, race/ethnicity, education, waist circumference, self-reported health status, chronic diseases, and prior diagnosis of benign prostatic enlargement and/or prostate cancer (men 40 years old or older). Prevalence and prevalence odds ratios were estimated from a multivariable logistic regression analysis using appropriate sampling weights.  Results:   The prevalence of nocturia was 21% (weighted 95% CI 19.3-23.0). Nocturia increased in prevalence with age (p<0.001) from 8.2% (CI 6.7-10.2) in men 20 to 34 years old up to 55.8% (CI 51.3-60.2) in men 75 years old or older.

We evaluated an approach combining in the same operative step a limited transurethral resection (TURP) of the median lobe, immediately followed by permanent implant-free seed brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   From January 2007 to November 2008, 22 patients underwent a customized limited TURP of their median lobe immediately before brachytherapy. All patients fulfilled our criteria for permanent implant brachytherapy, but presented with a more or less prominent median lobe and/or a high IPSS.  Results:   The procedure appeared to be technically feasible, with only 0.3% of migrating seeds, a mean post-implant D90 of 173.4 Gy and a mean post-implant V100 of 96.6%. However, 5 patients (23%) experienced a urinary retention, with two patients having to undergo a complementary post-implant TURP. Moreover, urinary toxicity was more pronounced than in our current experience, with high IPSS at 2 months (mean 19.2) and 6 months (mean 15.8).  Conclusion:   Although technically feasible, with relatively few migrating seeds and satisfactory post-implant dosimetric parameters, one-step TURP and brachytherapy was found to be poorly tolerated, with higher than usual urinary retention and urinary toxicity rates.

In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SPA-1 in human prostate cancer (CaP). Immunohistochemical studies of tumor specimens from CaP patients revealed a positive correlation of SPA-1 expression with disease progression and metastasis. The correlation was recapitulated in human CaP cell lines; LNCaP that rarely showed metastasis in SCID mice expressed an undetectable level of SPA-1, whereas highly metastatic PC3 showed abundant SPA-1 expression. Moreover, SIPA1 transduction in LNCaP caused prominent abdominal lymph node metastasis without affecting primary tumor size, whereas shRNA-mediated SIPA1 knockdown or expression of a dominant-active Rap1 mutant (Rap1V12) in PC3 suppressed metastasis. LNCaP transduced with SPA-1 (LNCaP/SPA-1) showed attenuated adhesion to the precoated extracellular matrices (ECM) including collagens and fibronectin, due to defective ECM-medicated Rap1 activation. In addition, LNCaP/SPA-1 showed a diminished level of nuclear Brd4, which is known to bind SPA-1, resulting in reduced expression of a series of ECM-related genes.

MW antennae exhibit overall average penetration depths of approximately 6 mm, excluding hot spots. RF radiators exhibit penetration depths of not more than approximately 3 mm, a value too low considering the superior penetration of the RF plane wave radiation. Assuming that a mismatch at the RF radiator-tissue interface is causing the poor energy transfer of RF energy, we developed new RF radiators with controlled dielectric matching interfaces for evaluating the potential of RF radiation in EHT and in interstitial hyperthermia (IHT) treatments. We designed, developed and assessed 27.12 MHz, 8 mm OD inductive and capacitive devices of novel and existing designs, each provided an optimised bi-layer matching interface. The assessment results reveal features such as customisable length and shape, independence of insertion depth, uncritical air gap, longitudinal heating uniformity, outstanding penetration depths (19-20 mm) and high SAR gradients at both radiator ends--i.e. prostatic urethra ends--for added safety. These data clear the way for the development of pre-optimised EHT inductive and capacitive RF applicators. Evidence of positive effects of high near-fields density in cavity microenvironments is given.

Western blot analysis in HL60 cells showed that poricotriol A activated caspases-3, -8, and -9, while increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. This suggested that poricotriol A induced apoptosis via both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways in HL60. On the other hand, poricotriol A did not activate caspases-3, -8, and -9, but induced translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria and increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in A549. This suggested that poricotriol A induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway mostly by translocation of AIF, independent from the caspase pathway in A549.

Detection and isolation of multiple tumor markers or tumor cells from complex samples sensitively and with high efficiency is critical for the early diagnosis of tumors, especially malignant tumors or cancers, which will improve clinical diagnosis outcomes and help to select effective treatment approaches. Here, we expanded the application of the monoclonal antibody (mAb)-coupled FMBMNs for multiplexed assays. Multiple types of cancer cells, such as leukemia cells and prostate cancer cells, were detected and collected from mixed samples within 25 min by using a magnet and an ordinary fluorescence microscope.

Traditionally, new drugs are evaluated for their potential to kill cancer cell lines. This approach is obviously not sufficient, and molecules with new modes of action are required. We suggest here that the infrared spectrum of cells exposed to anticancer drugs could offer an opportunity to obtain a fingerprint of the metabolic changes induced by the drugs. Because the infrared spectrum of cells yields a precise image of all the chemical bonds present in the sample, different drug targets are likely to yield different infrared fingerprints characteristic of the 'mode of action' of the therapeutic agent under investigation. In turn, drug-induced metabolic disorders should be amenable to classification in the same way that bacteria gender, species, and strains can be classified. We examined here a human prostate cancer PC-3 cell line exposed to 7 well described antimitotics. In a first step the IC(50) values were determined. For FTIR imaging, PC-3 cells were exposed to the IC(50) concentration of each drug for 48 h. About one hundred images of 4096 IR spectra at 8 cm(-1) spectral resolution were acquired. We show with a Student t-test that the different molecules tested induced different infrared spectral modifications. Furthermore, drugs known to induce similar types of metabolic disturbances appear to cluster when spectrum shapes are analyzed. Finally, supervised statistical methods allowed the building of an efficient and discriminant model. When the discriminant model was applied to a full infrared image a good sorting was generally obtained and misclassified spectra generally belonged to a small number of specific cells.

Extracellular antagonists are crucial for the modulation of their activity. Lack of expression of the BMP antagonist noggin by osteoinductive, carcinoma-derived cell lines is a determinant of the osteoblast response induced by their bone metastases. In contrast, osteolytic, carcinoma-derived cell lines express noggin constitutively. We hypothesized that cancer cell-derived noggin may contribute to the pathogenesis of osteolytic bone metastasis of solid cancers by repressing bone formation. Intra-osseous xenografts of PC-3 prostate cancer cells induced osteolytic lesions characterized not only by enhanced osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, but also by decreased osteoblast-mediated bone formation. Therefore, in this model, uncoupling of the bone remodeling process contributes to osteolysis. Bone formation was preserved in the osteolytic lesions induced by noggin-silenced PC-3 cells, suggesting that cancer cell-derived noggin interferes with physiologic bone coupling. Furthermore, intra-osseous tumor growth of noggin-silenced PC-3 cells was limited, most probably as a result of the persisting osteoblast activity. This investigation provides new evidence for a model of osteolytic bone metastasis where constitutive secretion of noggin by cancer cells mediates inhibition of bone formation, thereby preventing repair of osteolytic lesions generated by an excess of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Therefore, noggin suppression may be a novel strategy for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases.""","""['Chiara Secondini', 'Antoinette Wetterwald', 'Ruth Schwaninger', 'George N Thalmann', 'Marco G Cecchini']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Overexpression of noggin inhibits BMP-mediated growth of osteolytic prostate cancer lesions.', 'Lack of noggin expression by cancer cells is a determinant of the osteoblast response in bone metastases.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins in bone stimulate osteoclasts and osteoblasts during bone development.', 'Molecular mechanisms of osteolytic bone metastases.', 'Basic mechanisms responsible for osteolytic and osteoblastic bone metastases.', 'A Graph Neural Network Approach for the Analysis of siRNA-Target Biological Networks.', 'β-Ecdysterone Enhanced Bone Regeneration Through the BMP-2/SMAD/RUNX2/Osterix Signaling Pathway.', 'Chordin-Like 1 Regulates Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Metastasis via the MAPK Signaling Pathway in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Mediterranean Diet Food Components as Possible Adjuvant Therapies to Counteract Breast and Prostate Cancer Progression to Bone Metastasis.', 'Modeling bystander effects that cause growth delay of breast cancer xenografts in bone marrow of mice treated with radium-223.']"""

Subterranean termites are dependent on protozoa in the hindguts of workers to efficiently digest wood. Lytic peptides have been shown to kill a variety of protozoan parasites (Mutwiri et al. 2000) and also protozoa in the gut of the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus (Husseneder and Collier 2009). Lytic peptides are part of the nonspecific immune system of eukaryotes, and destroy the membranes of microorganisms (Leuschner and Hansel 2004). Most lytic peptides are not likely to harm higher eukaryotes, because they do not affect the electrically neutral cholesterol-containing cell membranes of higher eukaryotes (Javadpour et al. 1996). Lytic peptide action can be targeted to specific cell types by the addition of a ligand. For example, Hansel et al. (2007) reported that lytic peptides conjugated with cancer cell membrane receptor ligands could be used to destroy breast cancer cells, while lytic peptides alone or conjugated with non-specific peptides were not effective. Lytic peptides also have been conjugated to human hormones that bind to receptors on tumor cells for targeted destruction of prostate and testicular cancer cells (Leuschner and Hansel 2004). In this article we present techniques used to demonstrate the protozoacidal activity of a lytic peptide (Hecate) coupled to a heptapeptide ligand that binds to the surface membrane of protozoa from the gut of the Formosan subterranean termite. These techniques include extirpation of the gut from termite workers, anaerobic culture of gut protozoa (Pseudotrichonympha grassii, Holomastigotoides hartmanni,Spirotrichonympha leidyi), microscopic confirmation that the ligand marked with a fluorescent dye binds to the termite gut protozoa and other free-living protozoa but not to bacteria or gut tissue. We also demonstrate that the same ligand coupled to a lytic peptide efficiently kills termite gut protozoa in vitro (protozoa culture) and in vivo (microinjection into hindgut of workers), but is less bacteriacidal than the lytic peptide alone. The loss of protozoa leads to the death of the termites in less than two weeks. In the future, we will genetically engineer microorganisms that can survive in the termite hindgut and spread through a termite colony as ""Trojan Horses"" to express ligand-lytic peptides that would kill the protozoa in the termite gut and subsequently kill the termites in the colony.

Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from E(2)-treated prostatic stromal cell line WPMY-1 and primary PrSC. The CM of E(2)-treated WPMY-1 and PrSC promoted invasion of PCa cells, as measured by Matrigel transwell assays. Treatment with E(2) and 1,3,5-Tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-propyl-1H-pyrazole, an estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) specific agonist, significantly up-regulated MMP2 expression in WPMY-1 and PrSC cells at both mRNA and protein levels. The CM treated with an anti-MMP2 antibody lost the stimulatory effect on invasion of PCa cells. The ER inhibitor ICI 182,780, as well as a TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody and ERα-specific small interfering RNA effectively suppressed E(2)-induced MMP2 expression in WPMY-1 cells. Mechanistic studies showed that E(2) up-regulated MMP2 in an indirect manner: E(2) induced TGFβ1 expression via ERα; TGFβ1 stimulated MMP2 expression in PrSC; the invasion of PCa cells were stimulated by elevated MMP2 expression induced by E(2) in a paracrine manner.

Recently, alternative splicing has been described as a mechanism giving rise to COOH-terminally truncated, constitutively active AR isoforms that can support the CRPCa phenotype. However, the pathologic origin of these truncated AR isoforms is unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate alterations in AR expression arising in a cell-based model of PCa progression driven by truncated AR isoform activity. We show that stable, high-level expression of truncated AR isoforms in 22Rv1 CRPCa cells is associated with intragenic rearrangement of an approximately 35-kb AR genomic segment harboring a cluster of previously described alternative AR exons. Analysis of genomic data from clinical specimens indicated that related AR intragenic copy number alterations occurred in CRPCa in the context of AR amplification. Cloning of the break fusion junction in 22Rv1 cells revealed long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1) flanking the rearranged segment and a DNA repair signature consistent with microhomology-mediated, break-induced replication. This rearrangement served as a marker for the emergence of a rare subpopulation of CRPCa cells expressing high levels of truncated AR isoforms during PCa progression in vitro.

Materials and methods:   16 patients were examined on a 1.5 T MR system. All patients underwent the same MR protocol using an endorectal coil: T2-weighted triplanar turbo-spin-echo (TSE), axial echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), 3D chemical-shift imaging MR spectroscopy (MRS) and axial dynamic-contrast-enhanced TurboFLASH (DCE). Parametric maps of the choline+creatine/citrate ratio (CC-CR), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and plasma flow/mean transit time (PF/MTT) were calculated. Additionally, average time for reading and scanning were evaluated. As reference, biopsy results were used.  Results:   Sensitivity/specificity were 50.0-85.7%/44.4-72.2% for the T2 weighted images, 78.6-100.0%/38.9-55.6% for the ADC maps, 71.4-85.7%/44.4-55.6% for the PF/MTT maps and 64.3-78.6%/50.0-77.8% for the CC-CR.

It is characterized primarily, but not exclusively, by antiangiogenic mechanisms of action and the absence of high-grade adverse effects commonly seen with MTD chemotherapy. However, similar to other anticancer therapies, inherent resistance to LDM chemotherapy is common. Moreover, even tumors that initially respond to metronomic regimens eventually develop resistance through mechanisms that are as yet unknown. Thus, we have developed in vivo models of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells resistant to extended LDM cyclophosphamide therapy. Such PC-3 variants show stable resistance to LDM cyclophosphamide in vivo yet retain in vitro sensitivity to 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (precursor of the active cyclophosphamide metabolite 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide) and other chemotherapeutic agents, namely, docetaxel and doxorubicin. Moreover, LDM cyclophosphamide-resistant PC-3 variants remain sensitive to MTD cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo. Conversely, PC-3 variants made resistant in vivo to MTD cyclophosphamide show varying levels of resistance to metronomic cyclophosphamide when grown in mice. These results and additional studies of variants of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 suggest that resistance to LDM cyclophosphamide is a distinct phenomenon from resistance to MTD cyclophosphamide and that LDM cyclophosphamide administration does not select for MTD chemotherapy resistance.

In this report, we show that apart from its primary direct cancer-killing activity, reovirus oncotherapy overrides tumor-associated immune evasion strategies and confers protective antiprostate cancer immunity. Prostate cancer represents an ideal target for immunotherapies. However, currently available immune interventions fail to induce clinically significant antiprostate cancer immune responses, owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment associated with this disease. We show here that during the process of oncolysis, reovirus acts upon prostate cancer cells and initiates proinflammatory cytokines and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule expression. In an immunocompetent transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model, reovirus oncotherapy induces the homing of CD8(+) T and NK cells in tumors and the display of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and endows dendritic cells (DCs) with a capacity to successfully present TAAs to tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. These newly generated immunological events lead to the development of strong antiprostate cancer T cell responses, which restrict the growth of subsequently, implanted syngeneic tumor in an antigen-specific, but reovirus-independent manner. Such reovirus-initiated antiprostate cancer immunity represents a clinically valuable entity that can promote long-term cancer-free health even after discontinuation of the primary oncotherapy.""","""['Shashi A Gujar', 'D A Pan', 'Paola Marcato', 'Katy A Garant', 'Patrick W K Lee']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Ther""","""['Reovirus virotherapy overrides tumor antigen presentation evasion and promotes protective antitumor immunity.', 'Therapy-Induced MHC I Ligands Shape Neo-Antitumor CD8 T Cell Responses during Oncolytic Virus-Based Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Reovirus-induced cell-mediated immunity for the treatment of multiple myeloma within the resistant bone marrow niche.', 'Dendritic Cells in Oncolytic Virus-Based Anti-Cancer Therapy.', 'Role of Myeloid Cells in Oncolytic Reovirus-Based Cancer Therapy.', 'Dendritic cells and natural killer cells: The road to a successful oncolytic virotherapy.', 'Oncolyic Virotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Lighting a Fire in Winter.', 'The Combined Use of Orf Virus and PAK4 Inhibitor Exerts Anti-tumor Effect in Breast Cancer.', 'Engineering strategies to enhance oncolytic viruses in cancer immunotherapy.', 'Emerging systemic delivery strategies of oncolytic viruses: A key step toward cancer immunotherapy.']"""

(213)Bi is considered an α-emitter with high clinical potential, due to its short half-life (45.6 minutes) being well matched for use in peptide-receptor radionuclide α-therapy; however, there is limited knowledge available within this context of use.

Mir-221 and miR-222, two closely related miRNAs encoded in cluster from a genomic region on chromosome X, are strongly upregulated in several forms of human tumours. In this work, we report that the ectopic modulation of NF-kB modifies miR-221/222 expression in prostate carcinoma and glioblastoma cell lines, where we had previously shown their oncogenic activity. We identify two separate distal regions upstream of miR-221/222 promoter which are bound by the NF-kB subunit p65 and drive efficient transcription in luciferase reporter assays; consistently, the site-directed mutagenesis disrupting p65 binding sites or the ectopical inhibition of NF-kB activity significantly reduce luciferase activity. In the most distal enhancer region, we also define a binding site for c-Jun, and we show that the binding of this factor cooperates with that of p65, fully accounting for the observed upregulation of miR-221/222.

We found that H2A.Z and ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) are each required for transcriptional activation of the androgen receptor (AR)-regulated PSA and KLK3 genes. USP10 directly deubiquitylates H2A.Z in vitro and in vivo, and reducing USP10 expression in prostate cancer cells results in elevated steady-state levels of mono-ubiquitylated H2A.Z (H2A.Zub1). Moreover, knockdown of USP10 ablates hormone-induced deubiquitylation of chromatin proteins at the AR-regulated genes. Finally, by sequential ChIP assays, we found that H2A.Zub1 is enriched at the PSA and KLK3 regulatory regions, and loss of H2A.Zub1 is associated with transcriptional activation of these genes.

We also asked partners to rate their satisfaction with the patients' providers.  Results:   • Family members of 80% of newly diagnosed patients agreed to participate; most (93%) were partners (i.e. spouses or significant others). Most partners (93%) had direct contact with the patients' physicians. • Among the partners who had contact with providers, most (67%) were very satisfied with the patients' providers and 80% indicated that the doctor encouraged them to participate in the treatment decision. Overall, 91% of partners reported very frequent discussions with their loved one about the pending treatment decision, and 69% reported that their role was to help the patient make a decision. • In multivariate models, provider encouragement of partner participation was associated with higher partner satisfaction (odds ratio 3.4, 95% CI 1.4-8.4) and an increased likelihood of partners reporting very frequent discussions with their loved one (odds ratio 6.1, 95% CI 1.3-27.7).

Grape seed extract (GSE) has a known protective effect against prostate cancer. Here, we showed that GSE significantly inhibited HAT activity by 30-80% in vitro (P < .05). Furthermore, we demonstrated significant repression of androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcription by GSE in prostate cancer cells by measuring luciferase activity using a pGL3-PSA construct bearing the AR element in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (P < .05). GSE treatment also decreased the mRNA level of the AR-regulated genes PSA and NKX 3.1. Finally, GSE inhibited growth of LNCaP cells.

This was accomplished without any protecting groups resident upon either thioester bearing epoxy-aldehyde or the tetrapeptide. However, the ineffective production of largazole via the final macrolactonization led to an alternative intramolecular esterification/macrolactamization strategy employing the established two building blocks. This provided largazole along with its C2-epimer via an unexpected inversion of the α-stereocenter at the valine residue. The biological evaluation demonstrated that both largazole and 2-epi-largazole led to dose-dependent increases of acetylation of histone H3, indicating their potencies as class I histone deacetylase selective inhibitiors.

In this study, the stabilities of (64)Cu-DOTA and diamsar (two bifunctional Cu-64 chelators (BFCs)) conjugated DGEA peptides were evaluated. The in vitro stabilities of (64)Cu-DOTA-DGEA, (64)Cu-DOTA-Ahx-DGEA, and (64)Cu-Z-E(diamsar)-Ahx-DGEA were evaluated in PBS. A carboxyl-protected DOTA-DGEA was also synthesized to study the potential inter- and intramolecular interactions between DOTA and the carboxylate groups of DGEA peptide. microPET imaging of (64)Cu-DOTA-DGEA and (64)Cu-Z-E(diamsar)-Ahx-DGEA were performed in PC-3 prostate tumor model to further investigate the in vivo behavior of the tracers. DOTA-DGEA, DOTA-Ahx-DGEA, Z-E(diamsar)-Ahx-DGEA, and protected DOTA-DGEA peptides were readily obtained, and their identities were confirmed by MS. (64)Cu(2+) labeling was performed with high radiochemical yields (>98%) for all tracers after 1 h incubation. Stability experiments revealed that (64)Cu-DOTA-DGEA had unexpectedly high (64)Cu(2+) dissociation when incubated in PBS (>55% free (64)Cu(2+) was observed at 48 h time point). The (64)Cu(2+) dissociation was significantly reduced in the carboxyl-protected (64)Cu-DOTA-DGEA complex but not in the (64)Cu-DOTA-Ahx-DGEA complex, which suggests the presence of competitive binding for (64)Cu(2+) between DOTA and the carboxyl groups of the DGEA peptide. In contrast, no significant (64)Cu(2+) dissociation was observed for (64)Cu-Z-E(diamsar)-Ahx-DGEA in PBS. For microPET imaging, the PC-3 tumors were clearly visualized with both (64)Cu-DOTA-DGEA and (64)Cu-Z-E(diamsar)-Ahx-DGEA tracers. However, (64)Cu-DOTA-DGEA demonstrated 5× higher liver uptake than (64)Cu-Z-E(diamsar)-Ahx-DGEA. This biodistribution variance could be attributed to the chelating stability difference between these two tracers, which correlated well with the PBS stability experiments. In summary, the in vitro and in vivo evaluations of (64)Cu-Z-E(diamsar)-Ahx-DGEA and (64)Cu-DOTA-DGEA have demonstrated the significantly superior Cu-chelation stability for the diamsar derivative compared with the established DOTA chelator. The results also suggest that diamsar may be preferred for Cu chelation especially when multiple carboxylic acid groups are present. Free carboxyl groups may naturally compete with DOTA for (64)Cu(2+) binding and therefore reduce the complex stability.""","""['Chiun-Wei Huang', 'Zibo Li', 'Hancheng Cai', 'Tony Shahinian', 'Peter S Conti']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Evaluation of copper-64 labeled AmBaSar conjugated cyclic RGD peptide for improved microPET imaging of integrin alphavbeta3 expression.', '(64)Cu-labeled CB-TE2A and diamsar-conjugated RGD peptide analogs for targeting angiogenesis: comparison of their biological activity.', 'An improved synthesis and biological evaluation of a new cage-like bifunctional chelator, 4-((8-amino-3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo6.6.6icosane-1-ylamino)methyl)benzoic acid, for 64Cu radiopharmaceuticals.', '64Cu-Z-E-(1,8-Diamino-3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo(6,6,6)eicosane)-aminohexanoyl-Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala.', '64Cu-1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid-Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala.', 'Lewis acid-assisted isotopic 18F-19F exchange in BODIPY dyes: facile generation of positron emission tomography/fluorescence dual modality agents for tumor imaging.', 'Kinetic quantification of protein polymer nanoparticles using non-invasive imaging.', 'Comparison of (64)Cu-complexing bifunctional chelators for radioimmunoconjugation: labeling efficiency, specific activity, and in vitro/in vivo stability.', 'Positron emission tomography imaging of CD105 expression with a 64Cu-labeled monoclonal antibody: NOTA is superior to DOTA.']"""

At the moment, PSA (prostate specific antigen) values point out to either successful or unsuccessful prostate cancer therapy. Depending on therapeutic strategies, biochemical recurrence (BCR) is differently defined. After radical prostatectomy, the PSA declines to undetectable levels in 3-4 weeks; BCR: PSA = 0.2-0.5 ng/mL for a single measurement or two consecutive values which surpass 0,2-0,4 ng/mL. PSADT < 10 months is a predictor for the progression of the disease. After external beam therapy, PSA is slowly decreasing reaching up the nadir of 0.2-0.5 ng/mL in months or years; BCR: PSA = nadir + 2 ng/mL. In the case of brachytherapy, the nadir is reached in 2-4 years; BCR: nadir + 2 ng/mL. After hormonal therapy, PSA declines in 3-6 months, maintains low values for 18-24 months, then increases, settling for hormone independency. After chemotherapy, PSA is considered normal at values < 2 ng/mL; the response of PSA represents a confirmed decreasing from the second test at 4 or more weeks after the initial decline; the length of the response is the period between first decline with 50 % of PSA to 50 % increase from nadir; the progression of PSA is shown in the increase with 25 % in comparison to the basic level.

Growing evidence suggests that miRNAs function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in human cancers. The down-regulation of miR-145 has been reported in many types of human cancer, including prostate cancer (PC), suggesting that miR-145 functions as a tumor suppressor. Using the PC cell lines, PC3 and DU145, gain-of-function assays revealed that miR-145 transfection inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Fascin homolog 1 (FSCN1), an actin-bundling protein, is a candidate target gene of miR-145 based on genome-wide gene expression analysis.

However, whether IL-6 has a causative role in de novo prostate tumorigenesis was never investigated. We now provide the first evidence that IL-6 can induce tumorigenic conversion and further progression to an invasive phenotype of non-tumorigenic benign prostate epithelial cells. Moreover, we find that paracrine IL-6 stimulates the autocrine IL-6 loop and autocrine activation of insulin-like type I growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) to confer the tumorigenic property and also that activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is critical in these processes. Inhibition of STAT3 activation or IGF-IR signaling suppresses IL-6-mediated malignant conversion and the associated invasive phenotype. Inhibition of STAT3 activation suppresses IL-6-induced upregulation of IGF-IR and its ligands, namely IGF-I and IGF-II. These findings indicate that IL-6 signaling cooperates with IGF-IR signaling in the prostate microenvironment to promote prostate tumorigenesis and progression to aggressiveness. Our findings suggest that STAT3 and IGF-IR may represent potential effective targets for prevention or treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['A Rojas', 'G Liu', 'I Coleman', 'P S Nelson', 'M Zhang', 'R Dash', 'P B Fisher', 'S R Plymate', 'J D Wu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Targeting heat shock protein 90 in pancreatic cancer impairs insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signaling, disrupts an interleukin-6/signal-transducer and activator of transcription 3/hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha autocrine loop, and reduces orthotopic tumor growth.', 'The ETS factor ESE3/EHF represses IL-6 preventing STAT3 activation and expansion of the prostate cancer stem-like compartment.', 'An androgen-IL-6-Stat3 autocrine loop re-routes EGF signal in prostate cancer cells.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Implications of insulin-like growth factor-I for prostate cancer therapies.', 'Evolving cognition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway: autoimmune disorders and cancer.', 'Repurposing ketotifen as a therapeutic strategy for neuroendocrine prostate cancer by targeting the IL-6/STAT3 pathway.', 'Cellular Senescence as a Brake or Accelerator for Oncogenic Transformation and Role in Lymphatic Metastasis.', 'Cell polarity opposes Jak/STAT-mediated Escargot activation that drives intratumor heterogeneity in a Drosophila tumor model.', 'Association between trichomoniasis and prostate and bladder diseases: a population-based case-control study.']"""

Anogenital warts (condylomata acuminata) are the most common lesions presented in men, however, during the last decade the other HPV-associated exaggerated lesions such as condylomata plana, penile, scrotal, and anal intraepithelial neoplasias, as well as the penile, urine bladder and prostate cancer have been studied somewhat more extensively. The clinical variations might range from clinically invisible, asymptomatic lesions to the bizarre forms of giant condyloma of Buschke-Löwenstein type, including Bowenoid papulosis, Mb. Bowen, different kinds of eryhtroplasia both in men and women and a large spectrum of HPV-induced dermatovenereological entities in genital region including high-grade intraepithelial genital neoplasias, such as penile, anal, scrotal, vulvar, vaginal etc. (thus not only cervical), and, last but not least - the anogenital warts. A prophylactic vaccine that targets these types should thus substantially reduce the burden of HPV-associated clinical diseases. Ultimately, within the spectrum of therapeutic options for condylomata, no method is really superior to others; recurrences occurred in 30-70% of cases. We definitely need the HPV vaccination programme to eliminate one of the oldest and up to now unsolved problems of the mankind.

Long term use of bisphosphonates has recently been associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) defined as a three month non-healing defect in the jaw. ONJ is commonly precipitated by a tooth extraction or other stomatological procedure in patients treated with long-term, potent, high dose intravenous bisphosphonates for the management of myeloma, breast or prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of ONJ in patients with MM treated with bisphosphonates during the last 8 years in our institution and to pre-sent the first two cases. We have analysed 247 myeloma patients diagnosed in our institution in the period 2002-09. Only 190/247 patients (76.9%) were treated with bisphosphonates. The incidence of ONJ in our group of patients treated with bisphosphonates was 2/190 (1%). The most commonly used bisphosponate was i.v. pamidronate (17.8%) and 46.6% were treated with two or more types of bisphosphonates. Sixty-five patients (34.2%) received oral forms of bisphosphonates; 42.1% patients were treated with i.v. forms of pamidronate, ibondronate or clodronate, and 45 patients (23.7%) received a combination of oral and i.v. forms of bisphosphonates. The mean duration of bisphosphonates therapy was 24.7±17.7 months. The low incidence of ONJ in our institution could be explained by the rare use of zolendronate, which is the most commonly referred bisphosphonate causing ONJ, and by a relatively shorter duration of bisphosphonates treatment in patients with MM. Despite the fact that ONJ is a rare complication in our institution, preventive measures must be considered.""","""['M Pavkovic', 'G Petrushevska', 'R Jovanovic', 'O Karanfilski', 'L Cevreska', 'S Stankovic', 'A Stojanovic']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prilozi""","""['Osteonecrosis of the Jaw After Bisphosphonates Treatment in Patients with Multiple Myeloma.', 'Osteonecrosis of the jaw in cancer after treatment with bisphosphonates: incidence and risk factors.', 'Bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaws: prospective study of 80 patients with multiple myeloma and other malignancies.', 'A review of the literature on osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with osteoporosis treated with oral bisphosphonates: prevalence, risk factors, and clinical characteristics.', 'Osteonecrosis of the jaw in cancer patients receiving IV bisphosphonates.', 'The association between the severity of periodontitis and osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with different cancer locations: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Prevalence of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Patients with Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, and Multiple Myeloma.', 'Osteonecrosis of the Jaw After Bisphosphonates Treatment in Patients with Multiple Myeloma.', 'Risk of osteonecrosis in patients taking bisphosphonates for prevention of osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Use of bisphosphonates and the risk of osteonecrosis among cancer patients: a systemic review and meta-analysis of the observational studies.']"""

This led us to speculate that spontaneous smoking cessation may be a presenting symptom of lung cancer.  Methods:   Patients from the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center with lung cancer and for comparison, prostate cancer and myocardial infarction underwent a structured interview about their smoking habits preceding diagnosis. Severity of nicotine addiction was graded using the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence. Among former smokers, dates of cessation, onset of symptoms, and diagnosis were recorded. Difficulty quitting was rated on a scale of 0 to 10. Distributions of intervals from cessation to diagnosis were compared between groups.  Results:   All 115 patients with lung cancer had been smokers. Fifty-five (48%) quit before diagnosis, and only six of these (11%) were symptomatic at quitting. Patients with lung cancer who quit were as dependent on nicotine, when smoking the most, as those who continued to smoke, unlike the other groups. Despite this, 31% quit with no difficulty. The median interval from cessation to diagnosis was 2.7 years for lung cancer, 24.3 years for prostate cancer, and 10.0 years for patients with myocardial infarction.  Conclusions:   These results challenge the notion that patients with lung cancer usually quit smoking because of disease symptoms.

As usually only a very limited number of data for new patients is available; in this paper the analysis is extended to use population data.

The expected number was derived from mortality of all study participants before a possible diagnosis with PC. The disease-specific mortality rate was based on the number of men who died from PC.

Materials and methods:   A total of 110 patients with prostate cancer who had undergone endorectal prostate MRI at 1.5 T before radical prostatectomy were included. ADC values were derived by drawing a region of interest on the histologically confirmed tumors. Tumor volume was obtained by manual segmentation on T2-weighted images (T2WIs) and ADC maps. The relationship between the ADC value or tumor volume and the Gleason grade was assessed by using multivariate mixed linear and effect models. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the accuracy of ADC and tumor volume in determining the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.  Results:   A total of 197 tumors were studied; 128 (65%) tumors were found in the peripheral zone and 69 (35%) were found in the central gland. The ADC value was found to be negatively correlated with the Gleason grade (r = -0.39 for peripheral zone cancer). Higher ADC values were found to be associated with lower Gleason grades in the peripheral zone prostate cancers. No association was found in the central zone prostate cancers. Both ADC values and tumor volumes were found to significantly predict tumor aggressiveness, specifically in the peripheral zone (area under the curve, 0.78).  Conclusion:   ADC values were found to be negatively correlated with the postsurgical Gleason grade in patients with prostate cancer.

Extending the survival of prostate cancer patients thus requires knowledge of all causes of death.  Methods:   Data on the population, cancers, and causes of death were gathered from the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database. A Cox regression model, comparing prostate cancer patients with all other men, was applied. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated both for the underlying cause and for dying with a specific cause listed among multiple causes of death.  Findings:   Among 686,500 observed deaths, 62,500 were prostate cancer patients. For underlying causes other than prostate cancer, the highest cause-specific HRs were found for external causes (HR, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.31), diseases of the pulmonary circulation (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.09-1.37), and heart failure (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.24).

Interpretations:   Prostate cancer patients have a higher risk for dying from various causes other than prostate cancer, including external causes and heart failure.

Material and methods:   Segmented regression methods were investigated for characterising the 'signatures' in log(PSA) descent patterns between intervention and nadir.  Results:   The segmented regression method can automatically identify and parameterise features in a PSA distribution including failure points and doubling time patterns following nadir. The method has previously been applied to the analysis of descent patterns on a large clinical data series (Radiother Oncol 2009;90:382-8). Batch-processing of data using the method for all patients in a clinical trial would establish population parameter values and ranges. Subsequent application to an individual patient's PSA data would determine which resulting prognostic group they fall into.  Conclusions:   As more complete and higher-resolution PSA progression datasets become available, techniques such as presented here will allow flexible definition of the characteristics being examined and rapid extraction of parameters for correlation with clinical progression data.""","""['Martin A Ebert', 'David S Lamb', 'David J Joseph', 'Allison Steigler', 'James W Denham']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['PSA bouncing after short term androgen deprivation and 3D-conformal radiotherapy for localized prostate adenocarcinoma and the relationship with the kinetics of testosterone.', 'Hierarchical changepoint models for biochemical markers illustrated by tracking postradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen series in men with prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and radiotherapy in locally confined prostate cancer.', 'Value of determining prostate specific antigen in follow-up of prostatic cancer.', 'PSA relapse prostate cancer: the importance of tailored therapy.']"""

Recently it was reported that argon plasma coagulation (APC) is effective for HRP. However, previous studies documented complications such as ulcers, strictures, and perforations in as many as 20% of APC-treated patients.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to determine the optimal parameters for APC by using swine rectum and to assess the safety and effectiveness of APC in HRP patients.  Design:   Prospective case series.  Setting:   University teaching hospital.  Patients:   Sixty-five patients with HRP were prospectively enrolled between 2000 and 2010.  Interventions:   APC for HRP.  Main outcome measurements:   Optimal APC parameters, number of treatments, success rate, complications, clinical remissions.  Results:   APC in swine rectal wall ex vivo was optimal with a 40-W current, 1.2-L/min gas flow rate, and 2-second application, which was sufficient to treat the submucosal telangiectasia but did not adversely affect the muscle layer. Sixty-five patients (46 men, 19 women; median age 72 years) with HRP occurring at a mean of 20 months after radiotherapy were studied. Proctopathy was classified as grade A (mild) in 7 patients (10.8%), grade B (moderate) in 41 (63.1%), and grade C (severe) in 17 (26.2%). The treatment success rate was 98.5% after a median of 2 (range 1-5) APC sessions. The median clinical score for rectal bleeding was significantly decreased after APC (P < .0001), and the hemoglobin level was significantly increased (P < .0001). APC was well tolerated, and no significant side effects or complications occurred. During a mean follow-up of 34.6 months (range 3.6 -121.1 months), 4 patients (6.3%) had minor recurrent rectal bleeding and 60 (93.8%) remained in remission.  Limitations:   Nonrandomized study.

Methods:   Between 2002 and 2005, 288 patients, irradiated for prostate cancer (T1-3N0M0), were studied prospectively in two clinics. In one clinic almost all patients received (neo)adjuvant androgen deprivation (Bicalutamide+Gosereline). In a second clinic hormonal therapy was prescribed mainly for high risk patients. This allowed us to separate the effects of hormonal therapy and the patient's prognosis.  Results:   During the course of hormonal therapy, depression was significantly heightened by both hormone use (p<0.001) and poor prognosis (p<0.01). After completion of hormonal therapy, poor prognosis continued to affect the depression score (p<0.01). The increase was, however, small.  Conclusions:   Depression was mildly increased in patients receiving hormonal therapy. The increase appeared to be related to both the hormone therapy itself and the high risk status of patients. High risk status, with the associated poor prognosis, had a more sustained effect on depression.

Methods:   Patients with low-risk parameters on initial and repeat biopsy were offered surveillance regardless of age. Regular clinical evaluation and repeat prostate biopsy were recommended every 1-2 years, and intervention was recommended based on adverse clinical and pathologic parameters on follow-up. Acceptance rate of active surveillance, freedom from intervention, and freedom from recommended intervention were measured.  Results and limitations:   Of 202 low-risk patients, 86 (43%) chose immediate treatment and 116 (57%) underwent repeat biopsy for consideration of surveillance. Intervention was recommended after initial repeat biopsy in 27 (23%) men because of higher-risk features, leaving a total of 89 men on surveillance. Over a median follow-up of 33 months, 16 men were ultimately treated and 8 were recommended to undergo treatment because of adverse clinical features on subsequent evaluations. Of the men on surveillance, the 3-year freedom from intervention and freedom from recommended intervention was 87% (95% CI, 78-93) and 93% (95% CI, 85-97), respectively.

Methods:   We reviewed the records of 35 patients with chemotherapy-naive castrate-resistant prostate cancer who had received docetaxel 45 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks, with oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Treatment was held when the patients had reached a >50% prostate-specific antigen reduction from baseline that was confirmed by a second measurement 4 weeks later, in the absence of disease progression.

The concordance index on multivariate analysis was calculated without the LLPM, with LLPM as a continuous variable, and with the LLPM as a binary variable (≤1 mm vs >1 mm).  Results:   The mean LLPM was 3.90 mm (median 2.0, range 0.1-30.5). The LLPM was an independent prognostic factor for BCR (P < .05) on both univariate and multivariate analysis. The concordance index was 0.6802 when the LLPM was not included and was 0.6865 and 0.7189 when the latter was modeled as a binary and continuous variable, respectively. When the patients were stratified according to their pathologic stage, the LLPM was an independent prognostic factor for BCR in the 185 patients with Stage pT2 tumors but not in the 109 patients with Stage pT3 tumors.  Conclusions:   The LLPM in the radical prostatectomy specimen was an independent predictive factor for BCR in patients with a positive margin.

One of the options of compassionate use currently available is the use of Sunitinib. We present a joint preliminary experience with the use of Sunitinib in this clinical case.  Patients and methods:   a series of eight cases is presented, which sets forth a prospective multicentre experience with Sunitinib in patients with hormone-refractory metastatic and progressive prostate cancer, previously treated with at least a regime of Docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Other alternative chemotherapy regimes had already been tried in some patients. The primary objective of our study was the PSA response rate and our secondary objective was the progression-free period. We administered a dosage of 50mg/day for four-week cycles, followed by a two-week rest per cycle, until we reached a total of eight cycles or up to clinical progression or intolerable toxicity.

We intend to relate the expression of NF-kB (p50 and p65) with serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), both in normal males and in those with pathologic conditions of the prostate.  Materials and methods:   this study was carried out in 5 normal, 24 benign prostatic hyperplastic (BPH) and 19 patients with prostate cancer (PC). Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses were performed on tissue and serum PSA was assayed by PSA DPC Immulite assays (Diagnostics Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA).  Results:   in controls, p65 NF-kB was not found and p50 was scantly detected in 60% normal samples in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Both p50 and p65 were expressed in 62.5% of the samples with BPH and in 63.2% of those with PC. Both increased its frequency of expression with higher PSA serum levels.  Conclusions:   Activation of NF-kB revealed by its nuclear translocation in prostate cancer could be related to cancer progression and elevated seric PSA levels. A better understanding of the biologic mechanism by which circulating PSA levels increase and its relation with NF-kB expression is needed.

We aim to check the accuracy of different criteria in this context including PSA derivatives to detect prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   Four different criteria for indication of prostate biopsy were compared: (A) PSA-density (>15 ng/ ml/ cc); (B) PSA > 2,5 ng/ml; (C) PSA-velocity (> 0.7 ng/ ml/ year); (D) free/total PSA ratio (<15%). All biopsies and histopathological examinations were performed by the same urologist and pathologist, respectively.  Results:   The study was performed on 180 consecutive biopsies with 37.7% overall cancer detection rate: 29 (16.1%) performed following criterion A, 42 (23.3%) criterion B, 65 (36.1%) criterion C and 44 (24.4%) criterion D. Based on PSA criteria alone, the predictive positive value (PPV) was 37.9% for criterion A, 33.3% for B, 32.3% for C and 50.0% for criterion D, respectively, (p > 0.05). Associating positive DRE with changed PSA, the PPV increased to 50%, 50%, 43.9% and 68.2% for criteria A, B, C and D, respectively (p>0.05). In univariate analysis, DRE (positive versus negative), PSA level (>10 ng/ ml versus <4.0 ng/ ml), free/total PSA ratio (<10% versus >15%) and age were associated with PC. In multivariate analysis only positive DRE was associated with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   All the criteria of PSA derivatives are complementary and useful predictors of cancer risk. However, a positive DRE increased the PPV of PSA derivatives.

Thus, WYC02-9 was investigated for its cytotoxicity against DU145 prostate cancer cells, as was the underlying mechanisms by which WYC02-9 might induce DNA damage and apoptotic cell death through reactive oxygen species (ROS). WYC02-9 inhibited the cell growth of three prostate cancer cell lines, especially DU145 cells. In DU145 cells, WYC02-9 increased the generation of intracellular ROS, followed by induction of DNA damage and activation of the ATM-p53-H2A.X pathway and checkpoint-related signals Chk1/Chk2, which led to increased numbers of cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, WYC02-9 induced apoptotic cell death through mitochondrial membrane potential decrease and activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP. The above effects were all prevented by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine. Administration of WYC02-9 in a nude mouse DU145 xenograft model further identified the anti-cancer activity of WYC02-9.

Method:   A total of 240 healthy men (mean age and standard deviation = 53.8 ± 10.8) was selected by convenient sampling. In this methodological study, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used for psychometric evaluation. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to evaluate the reliability of the scale.

One such scenario is in the context of men with prostate cancer who have had pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before radical prostatectomy. For these cases, the prostate cancer extent from ex vivo whole-mount histology is to be mapped to in vivo MRI. The need for determining radiology-image-based disease signatures is important for (a) training radiologist residents and (b) for constructing an MRI-based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for disease detection in vivo. However, a prerequisite for this data mapping is the determination of slice correspondences (i.e. indices of each pair of corresponding image slices) between histological and magnetic resonance images. The explicit determination of such slice correspondences is especially indispensable when an accurate 3D reconstruction of the histological volume cannot be achieved because of (a) the limited tissue slices with unknown inter-slice spacing, and (b) obvious histological image artifacts (tissue loss or distortion). In the clinic practice, the histology-MRI slice correspondences are often determined visually by experienced radiologists and pathologists working in unison, but this procedure is laborious and time-consuming. We present an iterative method to automatically determine slice correspondence between images from histology and MRI via a group-wise comparison scheme, followed by 2D and 3D registration. The image slice correspondences obtained using our method were compared with the ground truth correspondences determined via consensus of multiple experts over a total of 23 patient studies. In most instances, the results of our method were very close to the results obtained via visual inspection by these experts.""","""['Gaoyu Xiao', 'B Nicolas Bloch', 'Jonathan Chappelow', 'Elizabeth M Genega', 'Neil M Rofsky', 'Robert E Lenkinski', 'John Tomaszewski', 'Michael D Feldman', 'Mark Rosen', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['Automated detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution ex vivo MRI.', 'Image registration of ex-vivo MRI to sparsely sectioned histology of hippocampal and neocortical temporal lobe specimens.', 'Registration of functional and anatomical MRI: accuracy assessment and application in navigated neurosurgery.', 'Challenges in accurate registration of 3-D medical imaging and histopathology in primary prostate cancer.', 'Histological Validation of MRI: A Review of Challenges in Registration of Imaging and Whole-Mount Histopathology.', 'Current Approaches for Image Fusion of Histological Data with Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Challenges and Practical Solutions to MRI and Histology Matching and Measurements Using Available ImageJ Software Tools.', 'Three-dimensional label-free histological imaging of whole organs by microtomy-assisted autofluorescence tomography.', 'Using IVIM Parameters to Differentiate Prostate Cancer and Contralateral Normal Tissue through Fusion of MRI Images with Whole-Mount Pathology Specimen Images by Control Point Registration Method.', 'Automatic 3D Nonlinear Registration of Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data.']"""

We determined the correlation of miRNA expression profiles with prostate cancer progression.  Materials and methods:   We studied frozen specimens from 49 patients treated for prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy. We intentionally chose 28 men without and 21 with biochemical recurrence, defined as prostate specific antigen greater than 0.2 ng/ml. The expression of 14 miRNAs was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. All radical prostatectomy specimens were studied in toto to determine tumor volume, Gleason score and 2002 TNM pathological stage. Benign prostate tissue from benign prostatic hyperplasia served as a control.  Results:   Four miRNAs were related to tumor recurrence. Using the Cox regression test the risk of recurrence was 3.0, 3.3, 2.7 and 3.4 for high levels of miR-100, miR-145, miR-191 and miR-let7c, respectively. When considering statistically significant clinical variables on univariate analysis of biochemical-free survival, prostate specific antigen and tumor volume, results revealed that miR-100 and tumor volume were independently related to tumor recurrence.  Conclusions:   A high level of miR-100 is related to biochemical recurrence of localized prostate cancer in patients treated with radical prostatectomy. The role of miR-100 during carcinogenesis must be resolved in future studies to better understand the molecular pathways in which miR-100 is involved.

One member of the claudin family, claudin-3, has been shown to be overexpressed in breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. Here we use immunohistochemistry to evaluate its expression in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), normal tissue adjacent to prostatic adenocarcinoma (NAC), primary prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa), and metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma (Mets).  Methods:   Tissue microarrays were immunohistochemically stained for claudin-3, with the staining intensities subsequently quantified and statistically analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with subsequent Tukey tests for multiple comparisons or a nonparametric equivalent. Fifty-three cases of NAC, 17 cases of BPH, 35 cases of PIN, 107 cases of PCa, and 55 cases of Mets were analyzed in the microarrays.  Results:   PCa and Mets had the highest absolute staining for claudin-3. Both had significantly higher staining than BPH (p < 0.05 in both cases) and NAC (p < 0.05 in both cases). PIN had a lower, but non-significant, staining score than PCa and Mets, but a statistically higher score than both BPH and NAC (p < 0.05 for both cases). No significant differences were observed between PCa, Mets, and PIN.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this represents one of the first studies comparing the immunohistochemical profiles of claudin-3 in PCa and NAC to specimens of PIN, BPH, and Mets.

In this case-control study, we aimed to investigate the possible association between PSCA rs2294008 C/T with clinicopathological features and the prognosis of gastric cancer in a Southern Chinese population. Genotypes of 460 gastric cancer patients and 549 controls were determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing. We found that individuals with at least one copy of the rs2294008T allele (CT or TT genotype) had an increased risk for gastric cancer compared with CC genotype (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.10-1.82, P = 0.006). Further stratification analyses indicated that the effect of PSCA rs2294008T carriers was noteworthy in intestinal type (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.18-2.04, P = 0.002), poorly differentiated (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.19-2.13, P = 0.002), noncardia (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.17-2.04, P = 0.002) subtypes of gastric cancer.

The present pilot study compared the perioperative single-dose of piperacillin/tazobactam to the administration of ciprofloxacin or cotrimoxazol for 5 days with regard to postoperative infections. For the first time these antibiotic regimes were described in radical retropubic prostatectomy.  Material and methods:   The patients were divided into three groups, each consisting of 17 patients: group 1: a single-dose of piperacillin / tazobactam 4.5 g i. v., group 2: ciprofloxacin 500 mg or cotrimoxazol 960 mg i. v. / p. o. and group 3: varying administration and duration of different kinds of antibiotics as control group. The basic characteristics of the patients such as age, body-mass-index, risk factors, diseases, former surgeries and medication were similar between all three groups. Also there were no significant differences in intraoperative parameters such as operation time, blood loss and other postoperative complications.  Results:   The piperacillin / tazobactam group showed a significantly lower body temperature on postoperative days (POD) 1-3. The laboratory values were not significantly different among the groups, except the piperacillin / tazobactam group showed a significantly lower CRP level on POD 1-3 than group 3. All antibiotic regimes could afford an efficient protection: None of the patients died and there were no cases of serious consequences such as pneumonia, urosepsis or bacteriuria. Although not statistically significant, the piperacillin / tazobactam group showed better clinical outcomes: here the length of hospitalisation was two days less than in the other groups, no cases of wound infection occurred, the antimicrobial resistance rates were lower and fewer patients were treated with antibiotics in the postoperative course.  Conclusions:   Comparable to similar studies with a larger number of patients our pilot study demonstrated, although statistically not significant, better clinical results overall. We therefore conclude that a single-dose of piperacillin / tazobactam appears to be an efficient antibiotic prophylaxis in radical retropubic prostatectomy and even in some clinical parameters piperacillin / tazobactam seems to be equivalent or better than the usual 5-day administration of antimicrobial prophylaxis.""","""['M Schenck', 'A Luetzke', 'H Ruebben', 'T Schneider']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Adherence to European Association of Urology Guidelines on Prophylactic Antibiotics: An Important Step in Antimicrobial Stewardship.', 'Antimicrobial prophylaxis for transrectal prostatic biopsy: a prospective study of ciprofloxacin vs piperacillin/tazobactam.', 'Antibiotic prophylaxis in radical prostatectomy: 1-day versus 4-day treatments.', 'Rationale and evidence for extended infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam.', 'Piperacillin/tazobactam: a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in moderate to severe bacterial infections.']"""

Although we are broadly aware of the specifics of the genomic actions of AR in prostate cancer cells, relatively little is known regarding the gene targets of functional AR in prostate stromal cells. Here, we describe a novel human prostate stromal cell model that enabled us to study the effects of AR on gene expression in these cells. The model involves a genetically manipulated variant of immortalized human WPMY-1 prostate stromal cells that overexpresses wildtype AR (WPMY-AR) at a level comparable to LNCaP cells and is responsive to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation. Use of WPMY-AR cells for gene expression profiling showed that the presence of AR, even in the absence of DHT, significantly altered the gene expression pattern of the cells compared to control (WPMY-Vec) cells. Treatment of WPMY-AR cells, but not WPMY-Vec control cells, with DHT resulted in further changes that affected the expression of 141 genes by 2-fold or greater compared to vehicle treated WPMY-AR cells. Remarkably, DHT significantly downregulated more genes than were upregulated but many of these changes reversed the initial effects of AR overexpression alone on individual genes. The genes most highly effected by DHT treatment were categorized based upon their role in cancer pathways or in cell signaling pathways (transforming growth factor-β, Wnt, Hedgehog and MAP Kinase) thought to be involved in stromal-epithelial crosstalk during prostate or prostate cancer development. DHT treatment of WPMY-AR cells was also sufficient to alter their paracrine potential for prostate cancer cells as conditioned medium from DHT-treated WPMY-AR significantly increased growth of LNCaP cells compared to DHT-treated WPMY-Vec cell conditioned medium.""","""['Matthew J Tanner', 'R Charles Welliver Jr', 'Mengqian Chen', 'Michael Shtutman', 'Alejandro Godoy', 'Gary Smith', 'Badar M Mian', 'Ralph Buttyan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prosaposin is an AR-target gene and its neurotrophic domain upregulates AR expression and activity in prostate stromal cells.', 'Increased expression of androgen receptor sensitizes prostate cancer cells to low levels of androgens.', 'Sonic hedgehog and androgen signaling in tumor and stromal compartments drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Stromal androgen receptor in prostate development and cancer.', 'Local endocrine, paracrine and redox signaling networks impact estrogen and androgen crosstalk in the prostate cancer microenvironment.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Role of prostate stem cells and treatment strategies in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Evidence that HDAC7 acts as an epigenetic ""reader"" of AR acetylation through NCoR-HDAC3 dissociation.', 'A Review of Prostate Organogenesis and a Role for iPSC-Derived Prostate Organoids to Study Prostate Development and Disease.', ""Aquaglyceroporin-3's Expression and Cellular Localization Is Differentially Modulated by Hypoxia in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.""]"""

The lack of our understanding of underlying genetic alterations for the transition from androgen-dependent (AD) to ADI prostate cancer growth hampers our ability to develop target-driven therapeutic strategies for the efficient treatment of ADI prostate cancer.  Methodology/principal findings:   By screening a library of activated human kinases, we have identified TPL2, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, as driving ADI prostate cancer growth. TPL2 activation by over-expressing either wild-type or a constitutively activated form of TPL2 induced ADI growth, whereas the suppression of TPL2 expression and its kinase activity in ADI prostate cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation under androgen-depleted conditions. Most importantly, TPL2 is upregulated in ADI prostate cancers of both the Pten deletion mouse model and the clinical prostate cancer specimens.  Conclusions/significance:   Together these data suggest that TPL2 kinase plays a critical role in the promotion of ADI prostate cancer progression. Furthermore, the suppression of TPL2 diminishes ADI prostate cancer growth and a high frequency of TPL2 overexpression in human ADI prostate cancer samples validates TPL2 as a target for the treatment of this deadly disease.""","""['Joseph H Jeong', 'Ayesha Bhatia', 'Zsolt Toth', 'Soohwan Oh', 'Kyung-Soo Inn', 'Chun-Peng Liao', 'Pradip Roy-Burman', 'Jonathan Melamed', 'Gerhard A Coetzee', 'Jae U Jung']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Tpl2 induces castration resistant prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Tpl2 kinase impacts tumor growth and metastasis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Tumor progression locus 2 (Map3k8) is critical for host defense against Listeria monocytogenes and IL-1 beta production.', 'TPL2 kinase action and control of inflammation.', 'Advancement in TPL2-regulated innate immune response.', 'Epigenetic Regulation of MAP3K8 in EBV-Associated Gastric Carcinoma.', 'Deleted in liver cancer 1 suppresses the growth of prostate cancer cells through inhibiting Rho-associated protein kinase pathway.', 'MAP3K8 Is a Prognostic Biomarker and Correlated With Immune Response in Glioma.', 'Tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2) in tumor-promoting Inflammation, Tumorigenesis and Tumor Immunity.', 'TPL2 Is a Key Regulator of Intestinal Inflammation in Clostridium difficile Infection.']"""

Few large-scale studies exist assessing obesity in relation to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-detected prostate cancer.  Methods:   We used cases and stratum-matched controls from the population-based PSA-testing phase of the Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment study to examine the hypothesis that obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is associated with increased prostate cancer risk, and with higher tumour stage and grade. In all, 2167 eligible cases and 11 638 randomly selected eligible controls with PSA values were recruited between 2001 and 2008. A maximum of 960 cases and 4156 controls had measurement data, and also complete data on age and family history, and were included in the final analysis. BMI was categorised as <25.0, 25.0-29.9, ≥ 30.0 in kg m(-2).  Results:   Following adjustment for age and family history of prostate cancer, we found little evidence that BMI was associated with total prostate cancer (odds ratio (OR): 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67, 1.03; highest vs lowest tertile; P-trend 0.1). A weak inverse association was evident for low-grade (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.97; highest vs lowest tertile; P-trend 0.045) prostate cancer.

Methods:   Normal and tumourigenic human prostate epithelial cell lines were incubated with [(3)H]-Cho to label choline phospholipids. Protein kinase C was activated with phorbol ester and blocked with inhibitors. Choline metabolites were resolved by ion-exchange chromatography. Phospholipase D (PLD) activity was measured by transphosphatidylation. Protein expression was detected by western blotting and/or RT-PCR. Choline uptake was measured on cells in monolayers over 60 min.  Results:   Normal prostate epithelial cell lines principally released phosphocholine (PCho) in contrast to tumourigenic lines, which released Cho. In addition, only with normal cell lines did PKC activation stimulate Cho metabolite release. Protein kinase C alpha expression varied between normal and tumourigenic cell lines but all showed a PKCα link to myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein. The five cell lines differed in Cho uptake levels, with normal PNT2C2 line cells showing highest uptake over 60 min incubation. Normal and tumourigenic cell lines expressed mRNA for PLD1 and PLD2, and showed similar levels of basal and PKC-activated PLD activity.  Conclusions:   The transition to tumourigenesis in prostate epithelial cell lines results in major changes to Cho metabolite release into the medium and PKC signalling to phosphatidylcholine turnover.

Current treatment modalities for PCa can be useful, but may be accompanied by deleterious side effects and often do not confer long-term control. Accordingly, additional modalities, such as immunotherapy, may represent an important approach for PCa treatment. The identification of tissue-specific antigens engenders PCa an attractive target for immunotherapeutic approaches. Delivery of DNA vaccines with electroporation has shown promising results for prophylactic and therapeutic targets in a variety of species including humans. Application of this technology for PCa immunotherapy strategies has been limited to single antigen and epitope targets. We sought to test the hypothesis that a broader collection of antigens would improve the breadth and effectiveness of a PCa immune therapy approach. We therefore developed highly optimized DNA vaccines encoding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) as a dual antigen approach to immune therapy of PCa. PSA-and PSMA-specific cellular immunogenicity was evaluated in a mouse model for co-delivery and single antigen vaccination. Mice received 2 immunizations spaced 2 weeks apart and immunogenicity was evaluated 1 week after the second vaccination. Both the PSA and PSMA vaccines induced robust antigen-specific IFNγ responses by ELISpot. Further characterization of cellular immunogenicity by flow cytometry indicated strong antigen-specific TNFα production by CD4+ T cells and IFNγ and IL-2 secretion by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. There was also a strong humoral response as determined by PSA-specific seroconversion.

SNPs in SLCO2B1 and SLCO1B3 were genotyped in a population-based cohort of 1,309 Caucasian prostate cancer patients. Median survival follow-up was 7.0 years (0.77-16.4). The risk of prostate cancer recurrence/progression and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) was estimated with Cox proportional hazards analysis.  Results:   Six SLCO genes were highly expressed in CRPC metastases versus untreated prostate cancer, including SLCO1B3 (3.6-fold; P = 0.0517) and SLCO2B1 (5.5-fold; P = 0.0034). Carriers of the variant alleles SLCO2B1 SNP rs12422149 (HR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.11-3.55) or SLCO1B3 SNP rs4149117 (HR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.00-3.08) had an increased risk of PCSM.  Conclusions:   CRPC metastases show increased expression of SLCO genes versus primary prostate cancer. Genetic variants of SLCO1B3 and SLCO2B1 are associated with PCSM. Expression and genetic variation of SLCO genes which alter androgen uptake may be important in prostate cancer outcomes.  Impact:   OATP/SLCO genes may be potential biomarkers for assessing risk of PCSM. Expression and genetic variation in these genes may allow stratification of patients to more aggressive hormonal therapy or earlier incorporation of nonhormonal-based treatment strategies.""","""['Jonathan L Wright', 'Erika M Kwon', 'Elaine A Ostrander', 'R Bruce Montgomery', 'Daniel W Lin', 'Robert Vessella', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Elahe A Mostaghel']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['SLCO transport genes in prostate cancer--letter.', 'Polymorphisms of the androgen transporting gene SLCO2B1 may influence the castration resistance of prostate cancer and the racial differences in response to androgen deprivation.', 'SLCO2B1 and SLCO1B3 may determine time to progression for patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Association of prostate cancer SLCO gene expression with Gleason grade and alterations following androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Genetic polymorphisms of uptake (OATP1B1, 1B3) and efflux (MRP2, BCRP) transporters: implications for inter-individual differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statins and other clinically relevant drugs.', 'Impact of OATP transporters on pharmacokinetics.', 'Regulatory genes in the androgen production, uptake and conversion (APUC) pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Glycyrrhizic Acid Prevents Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathy via Inhibition of OATP-Mediated Neuronal Uptake.', 'Prognostic Biomarker SLCO4A1 Is Correlated with Tumor Immune Infiltration in Colon Adenocarcinoma.', 'The Role of Solute Carrier Transporters in Efficient Anticancer Drug Delivery and Therapy.', 'Genetic variations predicting progression with docetaxel and novel androgen-receptor pathway inhibitors.']"""

We analysed EGFR expression, EGFR mutation status and gene expression profiles of prostate cancer (PC) to supply a rationale for EGFR targeted therapies in this disease.  Methods:   Mutational analysis of EGFR TK domain (exons from 18 to 21) and immunohistochemistry for EGFR were performed on tumour tissues derived from radical prostatectomy from 100 PC patients. Gene expression profiling using oligo-microarrays was also carried out in 51 of the PC samples.  Results:   EGFR protein overexpression (EGFRhigh) was found in 36% of the tumour samples, and mutations were found in 13% of samples. Patients with EGFRhigh tumours experienced a significantly increased risk of biochemical relapse (hazard ratio-HR 2.52, p=0.02) compared with patients with tumours expressing low levels of EGFR (EGFRlow). Microarray analysis did not reveal any differences in gene expression between EGFRhigh and EGFRlow tumours. Conversely, in EGFRhigh tumours, we were able to identify a 79 gene signature distinguishing mutated from non-mutated tumours. Additionally, 29 genes were found to be differentially expressed between mutated/EGFRhigh (n=3) and mutated/EGFRlow tumours (n=5). Four of the down-regulated genes, U19/EAF2, ABCC4, KLK3 and ANXA3 and one of the up-regulated genes, FOXC1, are involved in PC progression.  Conclusions:   Based on our findings, we hypothesize that accurate definition of the EGFR status could improve prognostic stratification and we suggest a possible role for EGFR-directed therapies in PC patients.

Patients and methods:   We reviewed 12,115 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1987 and 2002 to identify patients with pT3bN0 prostate cancer who received adjuvant ADT (n= 191). These patients were matched by clinical and pathological variables to a group of patients with pT3b prostate cancer who did not receive adjuvant ADT. Median postoperative follow-up was 10 years. Clinical endpoints included biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), systemic progression-free survival (SPFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival.  Results:   Patients who underwent adjuvant ADT experienced improved 10-year BPFS (60% vs 16%, P < 0.001), LRFS (87% vs 76%, P= 0.002), SPFS (91% vs 78%, P= 0.004) and CSS (94% vs 87%, P= 0.037). Overall survival was not significantly different between groups (75% vs 69%, P= 0.12).

When stratified by type of ADT (hormonal therapy vs orchiectomy), there was no difference in survival outcomes.  Conclusions:   Adjuvant ADT improves local, and systemic control after radical prostatectomy for pT3b prostate cancer. There is no difference in survival between patients receiving medical hormonal therapy vs patients undergoing orchiectomy.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients who had undergone salvage HIFU for biopsy-proven prostate cancer after primary radiation therapy. Patient characteristics and oncological outcomes were assessed.  Results:   Records of 22 patients with a median (range) follow-up of 24 (5-80) months were reviewed. Patients were men with presumed organ-confined disease who had been treated with salvage HIFU following recurrent disease after EBRT (fourteen patients), brachytherapy (five patients: four with high-dose brachytherapy using In(192) ; and one with low-dose brachytherapy using Au(98) ) or proton therapy (three patients). The median (range) age at salvage HIFU was 65 (52-80) years, with a median (range) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before radiation therapy of 14.3 (5.7-118) ng/mL and a median (range) PSA level of 4.0 (1.2-30.1) ng/mL before HIFU. The median (range) period to HIFU after radiation therapy was 36 (4-96) months. The biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) rate in all patients at 5 years was 52%. Rates of bDFS in low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups were 100%, 86%, and 14%, respectively. One of the twelve patients who received post-HIFU prostate biopsy showed malignancy. Side effects included urethral stricture in four patients, grade I urinary incontinence in four patients, rectourethral fistula and epididymitis in one of each patient.

Results:   During a median follow-up of 12 years, the overall cost in the RP group was 34% higher (p < 0.01) than in the WW group, corresponding to €6123 in Sweden. The difference was driven almost exclusively by the cost of the surgical procedure. The cost difference between RP and WW was two times higher among men with low (2-6) than among those with high (7-10) Gleason score.

Several lines of evidence indicate that p66Shc plays a critical role in steroid-related carcinogenesis, and steroids play a role in its elevated levels in those cells without known mechanism.  Methods and findings:   In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which steroid hormones up-regulate p66Shc protein level. In steroid-treated human prostate and ovarian cancer cells, p66Shc protein levels were elevated, correlating with increased cell proliferation. These steroid effects on p66Shc protein and cell growth were competed out by the respective antagonist. Further, actinomycin D and cyclohexamide could only partially block the elevated p66Shc protein level by steroids. Treatment with proteasomal inhibitors, but not lysosomal protease inhibitor, resulted in elevated p66Shc protein levels, even higher than that by steroids. Using prostate cancer cells as a model, immunoprecipitation revealed that androgens and proteasomal inhibitors reduce the ubiquitinated p66Shc proteins.  Conclusions:   The data collectively indicate that functional steroid receptors are required in steroid up-regulation of p66Shc protein levels in prostate and ovarian cancer cells, correlating with cell proliferation. In these steroid-treated cells, elevated p66Shc protein level is apparently in part due to inhibiting its ubiquitination. The results may lead to an impact on advanced cancer therapy via the regulation of p66Shc protein by up-regulating its ubiquitination pathway.""","""['Santosh Kumar', 'Satyendra Kumar', 'Mythilypriya Rajendran', 'Syed Mahfuzul Alam', 'Fen-Fen Lin', 'Pi-Wan Cheng', 'Ming-Fong Lin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['p66Shc longevity protein regulates the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells.', 'Reactive oxygen species induced by p66Shc longevity protein mediate nongenomic androgen action via tyrosine phosphorylation signaling to enhance tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells.', 'p66Shc--a longevity redox protein in human prostate cancer progression and metastasis : p66Shc in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Mitochondrial redox signaling by p66Shc is involved in regulating androgenic growth stimulation of human prostate cancer cells.', 'The interplay between p66Shc, reactive oxygen species and cancer cell metabolism.', 'Dynamics of antioxidant heme oxygenase-1 and pro-oxidant p66Shc in promoting advanced prostate cancer progression.', 'Roles of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biological Behaviors of Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrin αvβ3 in the Mediating Effects of Dihydrotestosterone and Resveratrol on Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation.', 'ErbB-2 signaling in advanced prostate cancer progression and potential therapy.', 'p66Shc protein through a redox mechanism enhances the progression of prostate cancer cells towards castration-resistance.']"""

To explore whether this role of USP19 extends to other cellular systems, we tested the effects of silencing of USP19 in several human prostate and breast models, including carcinoma cell lines. Depletion of USP19 inhibited proliferation in prostate cancer DU145, PC-3 and 22RV1 cells, which was similar to the pattern established in fibroblasts in that it was due to decreased progression from G1 to S phase and associated with a stabilization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). However, in contrast to previous findings in fibroblasts, the stabilization of p27(Kip1) upon USP19 depletion was not associated with changes in the levels of the KPC1 ligase. USP19 could also regulate the growth of immortalized MCF10A breast epithelial cells through a similar mechanism. This regulatory pattern was lost, though, in breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and in prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. Of interest, the transformation of fibroblasts through overexpression of an oncogenic form of Ras disrupted the USP19-mediated regulation of cell growth and of levels of p27(Kip1) and KPC1. Thus, the cell context appears determinant for the ability of USP19 to regulate cell proliferation and p27(Kip1) levels. This may occur through both KPC1 dependent and independent mechanisms. Moreover, a complete loss of USP19 function on cell growth may arise as a result of oncogenic transformation of cells.""","""['Yu Lu', 'Nathalie Bedard', 'Simone Chevalier', 'Simon S Wing']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['USP19 deubiquitinating enzyme supports cell proliferation by stabilizing KPC1, a ubiquitin ligase for p27Kip1.', 'Induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells by a recombinant adenovirus expressing p27(Kip1).', 'Cytoplasmic ubiquitin ligase KPC regulates proteolysis of p27(Kip1) at G1 phase.', 'KPC1 expression and essential role after acute spinal cord injury in adult rat.', 'p27(Kip1) signaling: Transcriptional and post-translational regulation.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Deubiquitinases in Cancers: Aspects of Proliferation, Metastasis, and Apoptosis.', 'Emerging Role of Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 19 in Oncogenesis and Cancer Development.', 'Deubiquitination in prostate cancer progression: role of USP22.', 'USP19 modulates cancer cell migration and invasion and acts as a novel prognostic marker in patients with early breast cancer.']"""

Here we propose a dose calculation strategy to accelerate IMPT optimization while reducing memory requirements. By using two adjustable threshold parameters, our method separates dose contributions from proton beamlets into major and minor components for each dose voxel. The optimization proceeds with two levels of iterations: in inner iterations, doses are updated in correspondence with changes in beamlet intensities from only the major contributions while keeping the portions from the minor contributions constant; in outer iterations, doses are recalculated exactly by considering both major and minor contributions. Since the number of elements in the influence matrix for major contributions is relatively small, each inner iteration proceeds quickly. Each outer iteration requires a longer computation time, but only a few such iterations are needed. Our study shows that the proposed strategy leads to nearly identical dose distributions as those optimized with the full influence matrix, but reducing computing time by at least a factor of 3 and internal memory requirements by a factor of 10 or more. In addition, we show that the proposed approach could enhance other optimization-related applications such as optimizing beam angles. By using an advanced lung cancer case that would demand large computing resources by conventional optimization approach, we show how our method may potentially help improve IMPT treatment planning in real clinical situations.""","""['Yupeng Li', 'Xiaodong Zhang', 'Radhe Mohan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['The influence of the optimization starting conditions on the robustness of intensity-modulated proton therapy plans.', 'Uncertainty reduction in intensity modulated proton therapy by inverse Monte Carlo treatment planning.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Proton radiation therapy for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base.', 'Comparing the use of protons and carbon ions for treatment.', 'Intensity modulated proton arc therapy via geometry-based energy selection for ependymoma.', 'Global optimization for spot-based treatment planning.', 'Proton energy optimization and reduction for intensity-modulated proton therapy.', 'On the interplay effects with proton scanning beams in stage III lung cancer.', 'Incorporating deliverable monitor unit constraints into spot intensity optimization in intensity-modulated proton therapy treatment planning.']"""

Due to its effects on aromatase gene expression and enzyme activity, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) has been proposed as an interesting substance in breast cancer treatment and prevention. In the present study, we have examined the effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) on estrogen and androgen metabolism in adrenocortical NCI-H295R cells, breast cancer MCF-7 cells and prostate cancer LNCaP cells. The NCI-H295R cell line has been proposed as a screening tool to study endocrine disruptors. We therefore studied whether this cell line reacted to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) treatment in the same way as cells from important endocrine target tissues. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) exerted cell line-specific effects on estrogen and androgen metabolism. In breast cancer MCF-7 cells, aromatase gene expression and estradiol production were decreased, while production of androgens was markedly increased. In NCI-H295R cells, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) stimulated aromatase expression and decreased dihydrotestosterone production. In prostate cancer LNCaP cells, aromatase expression increased after the same treatment, as did production of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In summary, our data show that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) exerts tissue-specific effects on estrogen and androgen production and metabolism. This is important knowledge about 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) as an interesting substance for further research in the field of breast cancer prevention and treatment.

Deep transcriptional sequencing (RNA-Seq) now makes it possible to study the occurrence and expression levels of TICs in individual samples across the genome.  Methods:   We performed single-end RNA-Seq on three human prostate adenocarcinoma samples and their corresponding normal tissues, as well as brain and universal reference samples. We developed two bioinformatics methods to specifically identify TIC events: a targeted alignment method using artificial exon-exon junctions within 200,000 bp from adjacent genes, and genomic alignment allowing splicing within individual reads. We performed further experimental verification and characterization of selected TIC and fusion events using quantitative RT-PCR and comparative genomic hybridization microarrays.  Results:   Targeted alignment against artificial exon-exon junctions yielded 339 distinct TIC events, including 32 gene pairs with multiple isoforms. The false discovery rate was estimated to be 1.5%. Spliced alignment to the genome was less sensitive, finding only 18% of those found by targeted alignment in 33-nt reads and 59% of those in 50-nt reads. However, spliced alignment revealed 30 cases of TICs with intervening exons, in addition to distant inversions, scrambled genes, and translocations. Our findings increase the catalog of observed TIC gene pairs by 66%.We verified 6 of 6 predicted TICs in all prostate samples, and 2 of 5 predicted novel distant gene fusions, both private events among 54 prostate tumor samples tested. Expression of TICs correlates with that of the upstream gene, which can explain the prostate-specific pattern of some TIC events and the restriction of the SLC45A3-ELK4 e4-e2 TIC to ERG-negative prostate samples, as confirmed in 20 matched prostate tumor and normal samples and 9 lung cancer cell lines.  Conclusions:   Deep transcriptional sequencing and analysis with targeted and spliced alignment methods can effectively identify TIC events across the genome in individual tissues. Prostate and reference samples exhibit a wide range of TIC events, involving more genes than estimated previously using ESTs. Tissue specificity of TIC events is correlated with expression patterns of the upstream gene.

Methods:   In this prospective cohort study, we recruited 121 Caucasian and 77 African American men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Participants completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) instrument at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months follow-up. To determine the between and within group differences on all functional measures (physical well-being, social/family well-being, functional well-being, emotional well-being, and prostate cancer specific concerns), we used repeated measures ANOVA.  Results:   Except for education, income and hospital type, the two racial groups had comparable socio-demographic and clinical attributes. At 3 months post-treatment, both groups experienced a decline in physical well-being and increase in prostate cancer specific concerns. Baseline values of these measures were not recovered by 24-month follow-up. In particular, lack of energy was the most prominent contributor to declining physical well-being. The ability to have and maintain an erection was the most severe prostate cancer specific concern. Lack of energy and concern regarding erection ability varied between the two groups over the follow-up period.  Conclusions:   Our findings provide an insight into not only the overall racial variation in physical health and prostate cancer specific concern, but also the temporal differences in these measures that can occur over a 24-month follow-up.

However, whether DHTS can induce apoptosis through an endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress pathway was examined herein. In this study, we found that DHTS significantly inhibited the proliferation of human prostate DU145 carcinoma cells and induced apoptosis. DHTS was able to induce ER stress as evidenced by the upregulation of glucose regulation protein 78 (GRP78/Bip) and CAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein/growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (CHOP/GADD153), as well as increases in phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA splicing forms. DHTS treatment also caused significant accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, indicating that DHTS might be a proteasome inhibitor that is known to induce ER stress or enhance apoptosis caused by the classic ER stress-dependent mechanism. Moreover, DHTS-induced apoptosis was reversed by salubrinal, an ER stress inhibitor.

A total of 494,630 men for all ages and 204,741 men ≥ 40 years old and without prostate cancer at the beginning of 2003 were followed to the end of 2005. Cumulative incidence and risk ratio between diabetic and nondiabetic men were calculated. Logistic regression estimated the adjusted odds ratios for risk factors.  Results:   The trend of prostate cancer incidence increased significantly (P < 0.0001). The cumulative incidence markedly increased with age in either the diabetic or nondiabetic men. The respective risk ratio (95% CI) for all ages and age 40-64, 65-74, and ≥ 75 years was 5.83 (5.10-6.66), 2.09 (1.60-2.74), 1.35 (1.07-1.71), and 1.39 (1.12-1.71). In logistic regression for all ages or for age ≥ 40 years, age, diabetes, nephropathy, ischemic heart disease, dyslipidemia, living region, and occupation were significantly associated with increased risk, but medications including insulin and oral antidiabetic agents were not.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer incidence is increasing in Taiwan. A positive link between diabetes and prostate cancer is observed, which is more remarkable in the youngest age of 40-64 years.

Increased local production of TGFβ1 is considered the inducing stimulus. Given that stromal remodeling actively promotes BPH/PCa development, there is considerable interest in developing stromal-targeted therapies. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis of primary human prostatic stromal cells induced to undergo fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation with TGFβ1 revealed up-regulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) producer reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (NOX4) and down-regulation of the selenium-containing ROS-scavenging enzymes glutathione peroxidase 3, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), and the selenium transporter selenoprotein P plasma 1. Consistently, NOX4 expression correlated specifically with the myofibroblast phenotype in vivo, and loss of selenoprotein P plasma 1 was observed in tumor-associated stroma of human PCa biopsies. Using lentiviral NOX4 short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, pharmacological inhibitors, antioxidants, and selenium, we demonstrate that TGFβ1 induction of NOX4-derived ROS is required for TGFβ1-mediated phosphorylation of c-jun N-terminal kinase, which in turn is essential for subsequent downstream cytoskeletal remodeling. Significantly, selenium supplementation inhibited differentiation by increasing ROS-scavenging selenoenzyme biosynthesis because glutathione peroxidase 3 and TXNRD1 expression and TXNRD1 enzyme activity were restored.

To date outcomes have focused on older prostate cancer survivors, though more heterogeneous groups of older survivors are in-need. The purpose of this exploratory pilot study is to examine whether resistance exercise via negative eccentrically-induced work (RENEW) improves muscle and mobility in a diverse sample of older cancer survivors.  Methods:   A total of 40 individuals (25 female, 15 male) with a mean age of 74 (± 6) years who have survived (8.4 ± 8 years) since their cancer diagnosis (breast, prostate, colorectal and lymphoma) were assigned to a RENEW group or a non-exercise Usual-care group. RENEW was performed for 12 weeks and measures of muscle size, strength, power and mobility were made pre and post training.  Results:   RENEW induced increases in quadriceps lean tissue average cross sectional area (Pre: 43.2 ± 10.8 cm2; Post: 44.9 ± 10.9 cm2), knee extension peak strength (Pre: 248.3 ± 10.8 N; Post: 275.4 ± 10.9 N), leg extension muscle power (Pre: 198.2 ± 74.7 W; Post 255.5 ± 87.3 W), six minute walk distance (Pre: 417.2 ± 127.1 m; Post 466.9 ± 125.1 m) and a decrease on the time to safely descend stairs (Pre: 6.8 ± 4.5 s; Post 5.4 ± 2.5 s). A significant (P < 0.05) group x time interaction was noted for the muscle size and mobility improvements.  Conclusions:   This exploration of RENEW in a heterogeneous cohort of older cancer survivors demonstrates increases in muscle size, strength and power along with improved mobility.

Barriers to pain and fatigue relief have been classified into three categories: patient, professional, and system barriers. The overall objective of this study was to test the effects of a clinical intervention on reducing barriers to pain and fatigue management in oncology.  Methods:   This longitudinal, three-group, quasi-experimental study was conducted in three phases: phase 1 (usual care), phase 2 (intervention), and phase 3 (dissemination). A sample of 280 patients with breast, lung, colon, or prostate cancers, stage III and IV disease (80%), and a pain and/or fatigue of 4 or more (moderate to severe) were recruited. The intervention group received four educational sessions on pain/fatigue assessment and management, whereas the control group received usual care. Pain and fatigue barriers and patient knowledge were measured at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months post-accrual for all phases. A 3 × 2 repeated measures statistical design was utilized to derive a priori tests of immediate effects (baseline to 1 month) and sustained effects (baseline or 1 month to 3 months) for each major outcome variable, subscale, and/or scale score.  Results:   There were significant immediate and sustained effects of the intervention on pain and fatigue barriers as well as knowledge.

However, information on specific malignancies is limited. From a cohort study of male US veterans we identified incident cancer cases (n = 412,008) and compared survival patterns among those with versus without a history of deep venous thrombosis. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals as measures of the relative risk of dying. Individuals with (versus without) a concomitant deep venous thrombosis and cancer diagnosis had a higher risk of dying (HR = 1.38; 1.28-1.49). The most prominent excess mortality (HR = 1.29-2.55) was observed among patients diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis at the time of diagnosis of lung, gastric, prostate, bladder, or kidney cancer. Increased risk of dying was also found among cancer patients diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis 1 year (HR = 1.14; 1.07-1.22), 1-5 years (HR = 1.14; 1.10-1.19), and >5 years (HR = 1.27; 1.23-1.31) before cancer; this was true for most cancer sites (HR = 1.17-1.64).

Methods:   We obtained formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks of prostatectomy samples of 40 patients with PSA recurrence, matched 1:1 (for year of surgery, race, age, Gleason grading, and pathology TNM classification) with tissue blocks from 40 patients without recurrence (n = 80).

Molecular events involved in the progression to CR-PCa remain largely unknown. A previous study reported significantly higher levels of Iκ-B kinase-epsilon (IKKε) expression in CR compared to androgen-responsive cell lines. In the present study, we evaluate IKKε expression in human prostate tissue.  Methods:   In order to evaluate the modulation of IKKε expression in PCa tissue IKKε immunostaining was performed on paraffin-embedded prostate tissue microarrays containing cores from normal tissues (n = 47), non-malignant tissues adjacent to the tumor (n = 53), prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) (n = 28), HS (n = 62), and CR tumors (n = 31).  Results:   We found a low cytoplasmic expression of IKKε in non-malignant tissue. HS tumors showed a significant increase in cytoplasmic IKKε expression compared to non-malignant tissues. CR tissues presented the highest cytoplasmic IKKε expression levels. We also report, for the first time, the presence of a nuclear localization of IKKε in prostate epithelial cells, in particular we observed an increase of IKKε nuclear localization in HS malignant tissues. Finally, we found a strong link between an increase of IKKε cytoplasmic expression in PCa and metastatic progression.

Our objective in this study is to propose a novel paradigm for a better discrimination of drug-targets and non-drug-targets with minimum disruptive side-effects under a biological pathway context. We introduce a novel metric, namely, ""pathway closeness centrality"", for each gene that jointly considers the relationships of its neighboring enzymes and cross-talks of biological processes, to evaluate its probability of being a drug-target. This metric could distinguish drug-targets with non-drug-targets. Genes with lower pathway closeness centrality values are prone to play marginal roles in biological processes and have less lethality risk, but appear to have tissue-specific expressions. Compared with traditional metrics, our method outperforms degree, betweenness and bridging centrality under the human pathway context. Analysis of the existing top 20 drugs with the most disruptive side-effects indicates that pathway closeness centrality is an appropriate index to predict the probability of the occurrence of adverse pharmacological effects. Case studies in prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus indicate that the pathway closeness centrality metric could distinguish likely drug-targets well from human pathways.

In this study we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of Saq-NO on the p53-deficient hormone resistant prostate cancer PC-3 cells. We demonstrate that the absence of functional p53 is not essential for the capacity of Saq-NO to reduce prostate cancer cell growth. In contrast to its previously described cytostatic action in B16 and C6 cell lines, Saq-NO exerted cytotoxic effects in PC-3 cells leading to dominant induction of apoptosis and enhanced production of proapoptotic Bim. In addition, differently from saquinavir, Saq-NO restored TRAIL sensitivity that was correlated with increased expression of DR5 independent from ROS/RNS production and YY1 repression. NF-κB activation may be responsible of the Saq-NO induced DR5 expression. Moreover, Saq-NO but not saquinavir, exerted synergistic activity with conventional cytostatic therapy. In agreement with these in vitro studies, Saq-NO inhibited the in vivo growth of PC-3 cells xenotransplants to a greater extent than the parental compound.

The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which activates NF-κB, significantly augmented viral Gag protein production in XMRV-infected cells. Reporter assays showed that TNF-α and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), an intrinsic NF-κB activator, increased long terminal repeat (LTR)-dependent XMRV transcription. We identified two NF-κB binding sites (designated κB-1 and κB-2) in the LTR U3 region of XMRV and demonstrated that both sites bind to the NF-κB component p65/RelA. Mutation of the κB-1 site, but not the κB-2 site, impaired responsiveness to TNF-α and LMP1 in reporter assays. A mutant XMRV with a mutation at the κB-1 site replicated significantly less efficiently than the wild-type XMRV in the prostate carcinoma LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 cell lines, HEK293 cells, the EBV-immortalized cell line IB4, and the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BJAB. These results demonstrate that TNF-α and EBV LMP1 enhance XMRV replication in prostate carcinoma and B-lineage cells through the κB-1 site in the XMRV LTR, suggesting that inflammation, EBV infection, and other conditions leading to NF-κB activation may promote XMRV spread in humans.""","""['Shuhei Sakakibara', 'Kaori Sakakibara', 'Giovanna Tosato']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus establishes an efficient spreading infection and exhibits enhanced transcriptional activity in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 trans-activates miR-155 transcription through the NF-kappaB pathway.', 'LMP1-augmented kappa intron enhancer activity contributes to upregulation expression of Ig kappa light chain via NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathways in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'Evidence and controversies on the role of XMRV in prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Prostate Microbiota and Prostate Cancer: A New Trend in Treatment.', 'Prevention of contamination by xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus: susceptibility to alcohol-based disinfectants and environmental stability.', 'Utilization of replication-competent XMRV reporter-viruses reveals severe viral restriction in primary human cells.', ""A20/TNFAIP3 inhibits NF-κB activation induced by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus vFLIP oncoprotein."", 'XMRV Discovery and Prostate Cancer-Related Research.']"""

Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 in 25 cases of prostate cancer tissues.  Results:   The total positivity rates of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 were 80% and 76% in these cancer tissues, respectively. The positivity rates of VEGF-C was 94.7% in the 19 cases with Gleason scores no less than 6 (group I), significantly higher than the rate (33%) in the 6 cases with Gleason scores between 4 and 6 (group II) (P<0.01). The positivity rates for VEGFR-3 also showed a significant difference between groups I and II (89.5% vs 33.3%, P<0.05). The expression level of VEGF-C was correlated to the Gleason score of prostate cancer (R=0.436, P<0.05), and the correlation between VEGFR-3 and the Gleason score was even more obvious (R=0.608, P<0.01). Their expressions, however, did not show any correlations to the patients age, PSA or the volume of the prostate.

Ensembles of classifiers are built using expert-annotated tiles from training images, and scores for the probability of cancer presence are calculated from the responses of each classifier in the ensemble. Spatial filtering of tile-based texture features prior to classification results in increased heat-map coherence as well as AUC values of 95% using ensembles of either random forests or support vector machines.

Methods:   Three hundred and fifteen patients treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) underwent planning CT scans before radiation and after 45 Gy. For each scan, RV and RD were recorded and compared using a two-tailed paired t-test. Robust linear regression analysis assessed correlation between initial RV and percent RV change.  Results:   The mean change in RV was -8.62 cm(3) and in RD was -0.19 cm(3), (p<0.05). A decrease ≥10% in RV and RD was seen in 159 patients (50.5%) and 117 patients (37.1%), respectively. Patients with ≥10% volume change had larger initial RVs than those with <10% decrease, (78.1 vs. 50.8 cm(3), p<0.0001).  Conclusions:   A significant decrease in RV and RD occurs during prostate IMRT delivery. More than half of patients had decreased RV and over a third had decreased RD. This observation is pertinent to prostate localization, planning margins, and implies that dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis of rectal irradiation based on pre-treatment CT scanning may inaccurately estimate the risk of rectal toxicity when the initial RV is larger than 70 cm(3).""","""['Nicole S Anderson', 'James B Yu', 'Richard E Peschel', 'Roy H Decker']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Distinct effects of rectum delineation methods in 3D-conformal vs. IMRT treatment planning of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical toxicities and dosimetric parameters after whole-pelvis versus prostate-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Optimization of collimator parameters to reduce rectal dose in intensity-modulated prostate treatment planning.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy as primary treatment for prostate cancer: acute toxicity in 114 patients.', 'Benefit of intensity modulated and image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Bowel and Bladder Reproducibility in Image Guided Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Results of a Patterns of Practice Survey.', 'Bladder surface dose modeling in prostate cancer radiotherapy: An analysis of motion-induced variations and the cumulative dose across the treatment.', 'Autosegmentation of the rectum on megavoltage image guidance scans.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy of the prostate using daily CBCT: the feasibility and likely benefit of implementing a margin reduction.', 'Dose/volume-response relations for rectal morbidity using planned and simulated motion-inclusive dose distributions.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a case-control study of men aged 60+ years with BCR on ADT (n = 63) vs PCa survivors without recurrence (n = 71). Frailty prevalence, ""obese"" frailty, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores, and falls were compared. An exploratory analysis of frailty biomarkers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hemoglobin, albumin, and total cholesterol) was performed. Summary statistics and univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted.  Results:   More patients on ADT were obese (body mass index >30; 46.2% vs 20.6%; P = .03). There were no statistical differences in SPPB (P = .41) or frailty (P = .20). Using a proposed ""obese"" frailty criteria, 8.7% in ADT group were frail and 56.5% were ""prefrail,"" compared with 2.9% and 48.8% of controls (P = .02). Falls in the last year were higher in the ADT group (14.3% vs 2.8%; P = .02). In analyses controlling for age, clinical characteristics, and comorbidities, the ADT group trended toward significance for ""obese"" frailty (P = .14) and falls (OR = 4.74, P = .11). Comorbidity significantly increased the likelihood of ""obese"" frailty (P = .01) and falls (OR 2.02, P = .01).

One of the shortcomings of microarray data is that they provide a small quantity of samples with respect to the number of genes. This problem reduces the classification accuracy of the methods, so gene selection is essential to improve the predictive accuracy and to identify potential marker genes for a disease. Among numerous existing methods for gene selection, support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVMRFE) has become one of the leading methods, but its performance can be reduced because of the small sample size, noisy data and the fact that the method does not remove redundant genes.  Methods:   We propose a novel framework for gene selection which uses the advantageous features of conventional methods and addresses their weaknesses. In fact, we have combined the Fisher method and SVMRFE to utilize the advantages of a filtering method as well as an embedded method. Furthermore, we have added a redundancy reduction stage to address the weakness of the Fisher method and SVMRFE. In addition to gene expression values, the proposed method uses Gene Ontology which is a reliable source of information on genes. The use of Gene Ontology can compensate, in part, for the limitations of microarrays, such as having a small number of samples and erroneous measurement results.  Results:   The proposed method has been applied to colon, Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and prostate cancer datasets. The empirical results show that our method has improved classification performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the study of the molecular function of selected genes strengthened the hypothesis that these genes are involved in the process of cancer growth.  Conclusions:   The proposed method addresses the weakness of conventional methods by adding a redundancy reduction stage and utilizing Gene Ontology information. It predicts marker genes for colon, DLBCL and prostate cancer with a high accuracy. The predictions made in this study can serve as a list of candidates for subsequent wet-lab verification and might help in the search for a cure for cancers.""","""['Azadeh Mohammadi', 'Mohammad H Saraee', 'Mansoor Salehi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['A combinational feature selection and ensemble neural network method for classification of gene expression data.', 'A novel gene selection algorithm for cancer classification using microarray datasets.', 'Feature selection and classification of MAQC-II breast cancer and multiple myeloma microarray gene expression data.', 'National Oncology Forum: perspectives for the year 2000.', 'Filter versus wrapper gene selection approaches in DNA microarray domains.', 'Measurement of Conditional Relatedness Between Genes Using Fully Convolutional Neural Network.', 'Prediction of key regulators and downstream targets of E. coli induced mastitis.', 'Integration of machine learning and meta-analysis identifies the transcriptomic bio-signature of mastitis disease in cattle.', 'Identification of altered pathways in breast cancer based on individualized pathway aberrance score.', 'Multiple criteria optimization joint analyses of microarray experiments in lung cancer: from existing microarray data to new knowledge.']"""
