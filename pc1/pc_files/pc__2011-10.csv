In this study, we observed a dramatic reduction in the expression of androgen receptor mRNA and protein in hyperproliferative prostate epithelium of keratin 5 promoter driven E2F1 transgenic mice. To confirm an inhibitory function for E2F1 on AR transcription, we showed that E2F1 inhibited the transcription of endogenous AR mRNA, subsequent AR protein, and AR promoter activity in both human and mouse epithelial cells. E2F1 also inhibited androgen-stimulated activation of two AR target gene promoters. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of E2F-mediated inhibition of AR, we evaluated the effects of two functional E2F1 mutants on AR promoter activity and found that the transactivation domain appears to mediate E2F1 repression of the AR promoter. Because DNMT1 is a functional intermediate of E2F1 we examined DNMT1 function in AR repression. Repression of endogenous AR in normal human prostate epithelial cells was relieved by DNMT1 shRNA knock down. DNMT1 was shown to be physically associated within the AR minimal promoter located 22 bps from the transcription start site; however, methylation remained unchanged at the promoter regardless of DNMT1 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that DNMT1 operates either as a functional intermediary or in cooperation with E2F1 inhibiting AR gene expression in a methylation independent manner.""","""['Conrad David Valdez', 'Joanne N Davis', 'Hana M Odeh', 'Tristan L Layfield', 'Craig S Cousineau', 'Thomas R Berton', 'David G Johnson', 'Kirk J Wojno', 'Mark L Day']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 transcription in BRCA1-mutated breast cancer: a novel crosstalk between E2F1 motif hypermethylation and loss of histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation.', 'Direct cooperation between androgen receptor and E2F1 reveals a common regulation mechanism for androgen-responsive genes in prostate cells.', 'Elevated E2F1 inhibits transcription of the androgen receptor in metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of a novel androgen receptor target gene, the cyclin B1 gene, through androgen-dependent E2F family member switching.', 'DNMT1: catalytic and non-catalytic roles in different biological processes.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Downregulation of CAMK2N1 due to DNA Hypermethylation Mediated by DNMT1 that Promotes the Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'Roles of Key Epigenetic Regulators in the Gene Transcription and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', ""Lifetime Impact of Cow's Milk on Overactivation of mTORC1: From Fetal to Childhood Overgrowth, Acne, Diabetes, Cancers, and Neurodegeneration.""]"""

Most epidemiological studies have assessed the effects of dietary intake only, although endogenous production after sun exposure is the main source of vitamin D. The aim of our pilot study was to study serum levels of vitamin D in general population and in patients with different type of cancer.  Patients and methods:   The control group consisted of 214 healthy individuals. Pathological groups of patients included 170 patients with different cancer types (28 patients with prostate cancer, 43 patients with breast cancer, 49 patients with colorectal cancer and 50 patients with lung cancer). All of the patients were enrolled in the early clinical stage of cancer up to clinical stage III. Advanced stages were not included into the study. Vitamin D serum levels were measured using ECLIA Roche method.  Results:   All the results for serum vitamin D from pathological groups were significantly lower compared to the levels of the control group. All the cancer types had a high incidence rate of very low serum levels of vitamin D. Lung cancer had the highest incidence rate of very low vitamin D serum levels.  Conclusion:   We found a high incidence of hypovitaminosis D in cancer patients compared to a healthy control group among a Czech population. This incidence rate is higher in comparison to data found in literature from the other parts of the world. Based on the data from this study, a large epidemiological study monitoring vitamin D serum levels in the healthy population and in cancer patients in the Czech Republic has been already proposed.""","""['Petr Pazdiora', 'Sarka Svobodova', 'Radka Fuchsova', 'Radek Kucera', 'Marketa Prazakova', 'Jindra Vrzalova', 'Andrea Narsanska', 'Marketa Strakova', 'Inka Treskova', 'Ladislav Pecen', 'Vladislav Treska', 'Lubos Holubec Jr', 'Milos Pesek', 'Jindrich Finek', 'Ondrej Topolcan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Seasonal and geographical variations in lung cancer prognosis in Norway.

Growth proliferation assays were performed in three cell lines (LNCaP, PC3 and Du145).  Results:   Treatment of LNCaP cells with resveratrol (1-100 μM) resulted in the inhibition of androgen-promoted growth, inhibition of AR transcriptional activity and decrease in the AR and prostate-specific antigen protein levels through degradation pathways.

Systematic leaf position errors are generated by directly changing a leaf offset in a linac controller; dose distributions are measured by a two-dimensional diode array; pass rates of the dose difference between measured planar doses with and without the position errors are calculated as a function of the leaf position error. Three different treatment planning systems (TPSs) were employed to create VMAT plans for five prostate cancer cases and the pass rates were compared between the TPSs under various leaf position errors. The impact of the leaf position errors on dose distributions depended upon the final optimization result from each TPS, which was explained by the correlation between the dose error and the average leaf gap width.

Proton Monte Carlo simulations are performed in water phantoms and for two patients, considering all primary and secondary particles, including recoils from inelastic nuclear interactions. Our results show that secondary protons exhibit LET(d) values up to a factor 10 higher than those of the primary protons at the same depth. Thus, secondary protons have a significant impact on the LET(d). Their contribution increases the LET(d) by ∼50% along the central axis and even >200% in the penumbra. Furthermore, the LET maximum after the peak changes from 12 to 15 keV µm(-1) when adding secondary protons to the primary contribution. This is important when modeling LET(d) with analytical methods. The contribution of recoils (A > 3) is observed to be 1.2% in the entrance region considering a prostate case.

Up to date there are just a hundred cases described. They are benign mesenchymal tumors without evidence of disease recurrence after surgery. When they present symptomatology, they emulate benign hyperplasia with urinary tract infections. Although it has benign nature, surgical intervention is indicated when severe clinical symptoms appear.

Furthermore, metastatic nodules are often refractory to current therapies, necessitating the elucidation of molecular changes that affect the chemosensitivity of metastases. Drug resistance exhibited by tumor spheroids has been shown to be mediated by cell adhesion and can be abrogated by addition of E-cadherin blocking antibody. We have previously shown that hepatocyte coculture induces the re-expression of E-cadherin in breast and prostate cancer cells. In this study, we show that this E-cadherin re-expression confers a survival advantage, particularly in the liver microenvironment. E-cadherin re-expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells resulted in increased attachment to hepatocytes. This heterotypic adhesion between cancer cells and secondary organ parenchymal cells activated ERK MAP kinase, suggesting a functional pro-survival role for E-cadherin during metastatic colonization of the liver. In addition, breast cancer cells that re-expressed E-cadherin in hepatocyte coculture were more chemoresistant compared to 231-shEcad cells unable to re-express E-cadherin. Similar results were obtained in DU-145 prostate cancer cells induced to re-express E-cadherin in hepatocyte coculture or following chemical induction by the GnRH agonist buserelin or the EGFR inhibitor PD153035. These results suggest that E-cadherin re-expression and other molecular changes imparted by a partial mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transition at the secondary site increase post-extravasation survival of the metastatic cancer cell and may help to elucidate why chemotherapy commonly fails to treat metastatic breast cancer.""","""['Yvonne Chao', 'Qian Wu', 'Christopher Shepard', 'Alan Wells']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are involved in hepatocyte-mediated phenotypic switching in prostate cancer cells.', 'Breast carcinoma cells re-express E-cadherin during mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transition.', 'Co-culturing human prostate carcinoma cells with hepatocytes leads to increased expression of E-cadherin.', 'The role of cadherin-mediated adhesion in breast cancer.', 'Prostate tumor cell plasticity: a consequence of the microenvironment.', 'Analysis of the metastatic mechanism and progress in the treatment of breast cancer liver metastasis: a narrative review.', 'Possible Mechanisms of Resistance Development to Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) In Vulvar Cancer Cells.', 'Breast cancer liver metastasis: Pathogenesis and clinical implications.', 'Exogenous growth hormone promotes an epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid phenotype in cancerous HeLa cells but not in non-cancerous HEK293 cells.', 'Interferon-γ increases sensitivity to chemotherapy and provides immunotherapy targets in models of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Objectives:   To compare breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer stage at diagnosis between Duals/SHIP and LI/nonduals, adjusting for sociodemographic variables, comorbidities, and nursing home status.  Research design:   Cross-sectional study using a database developed by linking records from the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System with Medicare and Medicaid files, as well as US census data.

Measures:   (1) Unknown stage/unstaged cancer and (2) distant-stage cancer at diagnosis.  Results:   Duals/SHIP were more likely than LI/nonduals to have unknown stage/unstaged breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio: 1.43, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.02-2.0; P = .035).

Methods:   The study was performed in a cohort of rheumatologists who usually prescribe bone mineral density assessment according to HAS criteria (one or more criteria) for bone mineral density (BMD) measurement as defined by: (a): vertebral fracture; (b): non traumatic non vertebral fracture; (c): corticosteroid therapy; (d): hypogonadism or GnRH agonist therapy; (e): endocrine disorders; (f): osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). BMD was measured by dual photon absorptiometry (DXA) at lumbar spine, femoral or total neck sites. Osteoporosis was defined as a T-score value less or equal to 2.5 at one of those region of interest (ROI); LBM as a T-score value between -1 and -2.5.  Results:   A total of 431 rheumatologists included 1198 male patients (66.6 ± 12.2 years). According to DXA results, 888 patients (74.1 %) had osteoporosis and 231 (19.3 %) had osteopenia. BMD was considered as normal for 79 patients (6.6 %). A total of 1146 patients (95.7 %) satisfied to the criteria of reimbursement of DXA measurement. Six hundred and eighty-six patients (57.3 %) had suffered from vertebral fractures and 349 patients (29.2 %) from non vertebral fractures. Corticosteroids had been prescribed in 28.7 % of patients and 6.6 % were treated with GnRH agonists for prostate cancer. Hypogonadism was diagnosed in 27 %. Five patients suffered from OI. Other risk factors were detected: alcoholism and smoking in 28.1 % and 42.9 % respectively; rheumatoid arthritis or spondylarthropathy in 12.5 % of patients; chronic pulmonary disorders in 16.1 %. By contrast endocrinopathies were rare (2.5 %). Several risk factors were more frequently encountered for patients with osteoporosis as compared with osteopenia, i.e., smoking, alcohol abuse, low calcium intake, vitamin D insufficiency and maternal history of hip fracture.  Conclusion:   A diagnosis of osteoporosis (BMD ≤ 2.5) was established by rheumatologists in 74.1 % of patients with clinical risk factors: LBM was found in 93.4 %.

To determine whether collagen XXIII facilitates cancer cell metastasis in vivo and to establish a function for collagen XXIII in cancer progression, collagen XXIII knockdown cells were examined for alterations in in vivo metastasis as well as in vitro cell adhesion. In experimental and spontaneous xenograft models of metastasis, H460 cells expressing collagen XXIII shRNA formed fewer lung metastases than control cells. Loss of collagen XXIII in H460 cells also impaired cell adhesion, anchorage-independent growth and cell seeding to the lung, but did not affect cell proliferation.

Our aims were to characterize OPN-SI expression in prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, besides evaluating their potential as biomarkers for PCa diagnosis and prognostic implications. Prostatic tissue specimens were obtained from 40 PCa and 30 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure OPN-SI mRNA expression. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using an anti-OPNc polyclonal antibody. Biostatistical analyses evaluated the association of OPN-SI and total Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) serum levels with clinical and pathological data. PCa tissue samples presented significantly higher levels of OPNa, OPNb and OPNc transcripts (p<0.01) than in BPH specimens. OPN-SI mRNA expression were positively correlated with Gleason Score (p<0.01). ROC curves and logistic regression analyses demonstrated that OPN-SI and PSA were able to distinguish PCa from BPH patients (p<0.01). The OPNc isoform was the most upregulated variant and the best marker to distinguish patients' groups, presenting sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively. Immunohistochemistry analysis also demonstrated OPNc upregulation in PCa samples as compared to BPH tissues. OPNcprotein was also strongly stained PCa tissues presenting High Gleason Score. Multivariate analysis indicated that OPNc expression levels above the cut-off value presented a chance 4-fold higher for PCa occurrence. We conclude that OPN-SI were overexpressed in PCa tissues, strongly associated with PCa occurrence and with tumor cell differentiation. Our results suggest OPNc splicing isoform as an important biomarker contributing to improve PCa diagnosis and prognosis, besides providing insights into early steps of PCa carcinogenesis.""","""['T M Tilli', 'L C Thuler', 'A R Matos', 'C M Coutinho-Camillo', 'F A Soares', 'E A da Silva', 'A F Neves', 'L R Goulart', 'E R Gimba']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['Kallikrein-related peptidase 4 gene (KLK4) in prostate tumors: quantitative expression analysis and evaluation of its clinical significance.', 'Differential display code 3 (DD3/PCA3) in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'IGF-II serum levels increase discrimination between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer and improve the predictive value of PSA in clinical staging.', 'Tumor markers.

The purpose of this study was to: (1) quantify the sensitivity of the dosimeter to detect imposed treatment errors under well controlled and clinically relevant experimental conditions, and (2) test a new statistical error decision concept based on full uncertainty analysis.  Materials and methods:   Phantom studies of two gynecological cancer PDR and one prostate cancer HDR patient treatment plans were performed using tandem ring applicators or interstitial needles. Imposed treatment errors, including interchanged pairs of afterloader guide tubes and 2-20mm source displacements, were monitored using a real-time fiber-coupled carbon doped aluminum oxide (Al(2)O(3):C) crystal dosimeter that was positioned in the reconstructed tumor region. The error detection capacity was evaluated at three dose levels: dwell position, source channel, and fraction. The error criterion incorporated the correlated source position uncertainties and other sources of uncertainty, and it was applied both for the specific phantom patient plans and for a general case (source-detector distance 5-90 mm and position uncertainty 1-4mm).  Results:   Out of 20 interchanged guide tube errors, time-resolved analysis identified 17 while fraction level analysis identified two. Channel and fraction level comparisons could leave 10mm dosimeter displacement errors unidentified. Dwell position dose rate comparisons correctly identified displacements ≥ 5mm.  Conclusion:   This phantom study demonstrates that Al(2)O(3):C real-time dosimetry can identify applicator displacements ≥ 5mm and interchanged guide tube errors during PDR and HDR brachytherapy.

This paper describes a method for the determination of tasquinimod in human plasma. The method is based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using stable isotope labeled tasquinimod as internal standard (IS). The plasma samples were processed by protein precipitation using acidic acetonitrile containing the IS. The precipitated samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was injected directly into the LC-MS/MS system. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase column using fast gradient elution, with a total run cycle time of 4 min. The method was validated with respect to accuracy, precision, dynamic range, lower limit of quantification, selectivity and robustness. Furthermore, the stability of tasquinimod in spiked plasma, in processed extracts and in incurred samples was thoroughly studied. The method was validated in the range of 1.0-2400 nmol/L, defining the lower and upper limits of quantification. The repeatability, reproducibility and overall bias were 1.5-7.1%, 3.5-7.4%, and 1.3-4.7%, respectively, in the range of 1-2000 nmol/L. Excellent selectivity was demonstrated in the validation, as well as in study samples from both healthy volunteers and cancer patients. Robustness was demonstrated by the calculated carry-over as low as 0.06%, and by an incurred sample reproducibility (ISR) experiment where 97% of the reanalyzed samples fulfilled the acceptance criteria of 20% deviation from initial analysis result. Also, tasquinimod was found to be stable in all investigated matrices, including in incurred samples. In an incurred sample stability (ISS) investigation, tasquinimod was demonstrated to be stable for 24 months, and 97% of the reanalyzed samples were within 20% from the initial analysis result. In conclusion, the method was demonstrated to be accurate, precise, robust and reliable for the determination of tasquinimod. The method was successfully used in several clinical studies for the support of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations.""","""['G P Hansson', 'M Olin', 'C Svanström', 'L D Svensson', 'C J Sennbro']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci""","""['Quantitative determination of the anti-tumor agent tasquinimod in human urine by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Determination of ticagrelor and two metabolites in plasma samples by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.', 'Simultaneous determination of tolbutamide, omeprazole, midazolam and dextromethorphan in human plasma by LC-MS/MS--a high throughput approach to evaluate drug-drug interactions.', 'Evaluation of microextraction by packed sorbent and micro-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as a green approach in bioanalysis.', 'LC-MS/MS quantitation of antimalarial drug piperaquine and metabolites in human plasma.', 'Phase Ib Trial of Cabazitaxel and Tasquinimod in Men With Heavily Pretreated Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC): The CATCH Trial.']"""

Methods:   From 2005 onwards, a consecutive series of patients undergoing 12-core prostate biopsy for PSA value ≥ 4 ng/ml and/or positive digital rectal examination (DRE) were enrolled. Before the biopsy, patients underwent a physical examination, including height and weight measurement. Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m(2). Blood samples were drawn from all patients and analyzed for total PSA and testosterone.  Results:   885 patients were enrolled with a median age and PSA of 67 years (range 37-95) and 6.4 ng/ml (range 1-30) respectively. Median BMI was 27.1 kg/m(2) (range 18-46.6) with 185 patients classified as obese. 363 patients had cancer at biopsy; 76 were obese.

The purpose of this work was to assess the PK and biodistribution of HSA/TIMP-2 as well as to quantify accumulated HSA/TIMP-2 in tumors.  Methods:   Cy5.5 near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence was conjugated to the HSA/TIMP-2 protein (Cy5.5-HSA/TIMP-2) for monitoring spatio-temporal changes in vivo. For PK and biodistribution analysis, 0.2 μg/g body weight of Cy5.5-HSA/TIMP-2 was injected into MAT-LyLu prostate tumor xenografts, which were then imaged using an IVIS-200 optical imaging system. To quantify the accumulated HSA/TIMP-2 in tumors, we introduced a standard curve with depth-corrected fluorescence measurement.  Results:   In the vascular tube formation assay with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), Cy5.5-HSA/TIMP-2 showed an antiangiogenic effect. In prostate cancer xenografts, Cy5.5-HSA/TIMP-2 exhibited a prolongation of blood half-life to 19.6 h and relatively preferential distribution to the tumor. The amount of tumor-accumulated Cy5.5-HSA/TIMP-2 was calculated to be 4.5 ± 0.5 ng/g body weight at 2 days, representing 2.25 ± 0.25% of the initial dose.  Conclusions:   We evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile and biodistribution of HSA/TIMP-2 with favorable results, providing new information for more effective approaches to cancer therapeutics using HSA/TIMP-2.

Patients and methods:   From May 2004 through March 2010, 154 patients with local and locally advanced prostate cancer underwent EBRT + HDR-BT. One hundred thirteen patients with more than 6 months follow-up were evaluated. A median follow-up was 33 months. The patients consisted of 12 low-, 65 intermediate- and 36 high-risk patients. No patients received adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy with EBRT + HDR-BT. Biochemical freedom from failure (bFFF) was determined using the Phoenix definition.  Results:   The 5-year bFFF rate was 100%, 94.7%, and 59.2% for low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients. The 58-month bFFF rate of high-risk patients with one ominous factor was significantly lower than that of high-risk patients with more than ominous two factors (87.4% vs 26.9%, p = 0.022). With respect to acute adverse events, transurethral electric coagulation was performed for vesical bleeding and tamponade after removal of applicator needles in only one patient.

However, the role of genetic variation in the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and receptor genes (ADIPOR1/R2) in prostate cancer is largely unknown.  Methods:   In a nested case-control study of 1,286 cases and 1,267 controls within the Physicians' Health Study, we evaluated 29 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in ADIPOQ (n = 13), ADIPOR1 (n = 5), and ADIPOR2 (n = 11) in relation to the risk of prostate cancer. In subgroups, we also evaluated the association of genotype and circulating adiponectin levels (n = 951) and prostate tumor expression of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-IR) receptor (n = 181).  Results:   Among the 12 tagging polymorphisms in ADIPOQ, four (rs266729, rs182052, rs822391, and rs2082940) were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with overall prostate cancer risk, with no significant difference by tumor grade or clinical stage. Two of the risk SNPs (rs266729 and rs182052) plus four other SNPs (rs16861209, rs17366568, rs3774261, and rs7639352) were also associated with plasma adiponectin levels, and three of these (rs1686109, rs17366568, and rs3774261) were also significantly associated with IR expression in prostate tumor tissue. One additional SNP was associated with IGFI-R tumor tissue expression (rs16861205). None of the 16 variants in ADIPOR1/R2 were related to cancer risk or circulating adiponectin levels.

One recent finding that the PCa risk SNPs are enriched in genomic regions containing androgen receptor (AR)-binding sites has suggested altered AR signaling as a potentially important mechanism.  Methods:   To explore novel associations by leveraging this knowledge, we utilized a meta-analysis previously done over SNPs harbored in ChIP-on-chip identified AR-binding genomic regions using the GWAS data from the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) and the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) study, and subsequently evaluated the top associations in a third population from the CAncer of the Prostate in Sweden (CAPS) study.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the dose specifications of our IMRT treatment plans for locally advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   Seventy-seven clinically applied IMRT plans treated between September 2003 and December 2005, in which patients were irradiated with 78 Gy in the prone position, were retrospectively analyzed. Dosimetric data output from dose volume histograms were evaluated in detail.  Results:   The mean dose ± standard deviation, homogeneity index, and conformity index to the planning target volume (PTV) were 78.3 ± 0.7 Gy (100.4 ± 0.9%), 13.7 ± 3.0, and 0.83 ± 0.04, respectively. For the clinical target volume, the mean dose was 80.3 ± 0.7 Gy (102.9 ± 0.9%).The V40, V60, and V70 Gy of the rectal wall were 58.3 ± 2.8, 29.6 ± 2.7, and 15.2 ± 3.0%, respectively. Planning difficulties were encountered in patients whose bowels were displaced downward, as constraints imposed by the bowel position altered the dose index of the PTV. In many cases, additional bowel optimization parameters were required to satisfy constraints for organs at risk. However, major deviation could be avoided by inverse planning with computer optimization.

However, due to the inherent dimensionality differences in MR imaging and spectral information, quantitative integration of T(2) weighted MRI (T(2)w MRI) and MRS for improved CaP detection has been a major challenge. In this paper, we present a novel computerized decision support system called multimodal wavelet embedding representation for data combination (MaWERiC) that employs, (i) wavelet theory to extract 171 Haar wavelet features from MRS and 54 Gabor features from T(2)w MRI, (ii) dimensionality reduction to individually project wavelet features from MRS and T(2)w MRI into a common reduced Eigen vector space, and (iii), a random forest classifier for automated prostate cancer detection on a per voxel basis from combined 1.5 T in vivo MRI and MRS. A total of 36 1.5 T endorectal in vivo T(2)w MRI and MRS patient studies were evaluated per voxel by MaWERiC using a three-fold cross validation approach over 25 iterations. Ground truth for evaluation of results was obtained by an expert radiologist annotations of prostate cancer on a per voxel basis who compared each MRI section with corresponding ex vivo wholemount histology sections with the disease extent mapped out on histology. Results suggest that MaWERiC based MRS T(2)w meta-classifier (mean AUC, μ = 0.89 ± 0.02) significantly outperformed (i) a T(2)w MRI (using wavelet texture features) classifier (μ = 0.55 ± 0.02), (ii) a MRS (using metabolite ratios) classifier (μ = 0.77 ± 0.03), (iii) a decision fusion classifier obtained by combining individual T(2)w MRI and MRS classifier outputs (μ = 0.85 ± 0.03), and (iv) a data combination method involving a combination of metabolic MRS and MR signal intensity features (μ = 0.66 ± 0.02).""","""['P Tiwari', 'S Viswanath', 'J Kurhanewicz', 'A Sridhar', 'A Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['Multi-kernel graph embedding for detection, Gleason grading of prostate cancer via MRI/MRS.', 'A hierarchical spectral clustering and nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme for detection of prostate cancer from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).', 'Spectral embedding based probabilistic boosting tree (ScEPTre): classifying high dimensional heterogeneous biomedical data.', 'Update of prostate magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Decision fusion in healthcare and medicine: a narrative review.', 'Diagnosis of Lung Cancer by FTIR Spectroscopy Combined With Raman Spectroscopy Based on Data Fusion and Wavelet Transform.', 'Algorithms applied to spatially registered multi-parametric MRI for prostate tumor volume measurement.', 'A Deep Learning-Based Approach for the Detection and Localization of Prostate Cancer in T2 Magnetic Resonance Images.', 'Development of a measure for evaluating lesion-wise performance of CAD algorithms in the context of mpMRI detection of prostate cancer.']"""

However, it is unknown whether changes in PSA kinetics influence metastasis-free survival (MFS).  Methods:   We performed a retrospective post hoc analysis of 146 men treated in 4 phase II trials examining the investigational agents marimastat (a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; n = 39), imatinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor; n = 25), ATN-224 (a copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase inhibitor; n = 22), and lenalidomide (an antiangiogenic/immunomodulatory drug; n = 60). We investigated factors influencing MFS, including within-subject changes in PSA kinetics (PSA slope, doubling time, and velocity) before and after treatment initiation.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 16.8 months, 70 patients (47.9%) developed metastases. In multivariable Cox regression models, factors that were independently predictive of MFS after adjusting for age and other clinical prognostic variables were baseline PSA doubling time (PSADT) (P = .05), baseline PSA slope (P = .01), on-study change in PSADT (P = .02), and on-study change in PSA slope (P = .03). In a landmark Kaplan-Meier analysis, median MFS was 63.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.6-not reached) and 28.9 months (95% CI, 13.5-68.0) for men with or without any decrease in PSA slope by 6 months after treatment, respectively.  Conclusions:   This hypothesis generating analysis suggests that within-subject changes in PSADT and PSA slope after initiation of experimental therapy may correlate with MFS in men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.

Endourologic management usually does not result in very high cure rates but is associated with very high rates of recurrences. There is no standard management of these postoperative long-term complications and quite often the patient ends up having a transurethral or suprapubic catheter as a simple long-term solution.  Results:   Twenty-four patients with recurrent anastomotic strictures and a mean of 3.5 (2-9) previous transurethral surgical interventions were operated between 2004 and 2011. All patients underwent perineal bladder neck closure and a continent vesicostomy with either an appendiceal or an ileal stoma implanted in the bladder. The mean OR time was 125 (100-195) min, and the mean time of hospitalisation was 12.5 (9-27) days. There were no significant intra- or perioperative complications. Three patients developed a significant urinary tract infection, two patients had to be treated for the development of a paralytic ileus and one patient needed to undergo revision surgery for a urethral fistula. After a mean follow-up of 37 (10-78) months, two patients developed a stomal stenosis which was corrected surgically.  Conclusions:   Based on our experience, bladder neck closure and continent vesicostomy represent a valuable therapeutic option in the management of recurrent anastomotic strictures following radical prostatectomy.""","""['D Pfister', 'R Epplen', 'D Porres-Knoblauch', 'A Heidenreich']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Complications after radical prostatectomy: anastomotic stricture and rectourethral fistula.', 'Antegrade endourethroplasty with free skin graft for recurrent vesicourethral anastomotic strictures after radical prostatectomy.', 'Anastomotic stricture following radical retropubic prostatectomy: insights into incidence, management and factors predisposing for occurrence.', 'Anastomotic strictures following radical prostatectomy: risk factors and management.', 'Stricture of the vesicourethral anastomosis after radical prostatectomy.', 'Differences in Recurrence Rate and De Novo Incontinence after Endoscopic Treatment of Vesicourethral Stenosis and Bladder Neck Stenosis.', 'Comparison between Two Different Two-Stage Transperineal Approaches to Treat Urethral Strictures or Bladder Neck Contracture Associated with Severe Urinary Incontinence that Occurred after Pelvic Surgery: Report of Our Experience.']"""

Three observers contoured the prostate and rectum of 13 patients with CT and CT-MRI fusion. Prostate delineations were classified into three sub-parts, and the volumes and distances to the rectum (PR distance) were calculated. 3D radiotherapy plans were generated. A dose-volume histogram (DVH) was constructed for the rectum. The intermodality and interobserver variations were assessed. CT-MRI fusion yielded a significantly lower prostate volume by 31%. In the sub-part analysis, the greatest difference was seen for the apical side. The PR distance was significantly extended by 3.5-mm, and the greatest difference was seen for the basal side. The irradiated rectal volume was reduced in the CT-MRI fusion-based plan. The reduction rates were greater in the relatively high-dose regions. The decrease of the prostate volume and length alteration of the distance between the prostate and rectum were correlated with the decrease of the irradiated rectal volume. The prostate volume delineated by CT-MRI fusion was negatively correlated with the decrease of the irradiated rectal volume. CT showed a tendency towards overestimation of the prostate volume and underestimation of the PR distance as compared to CT-MRI fusion.

Methods:   Using PCa cells (DU145, PC-3, LNCaP) and PrECs, we performed the following in vitro experiments: time-course, kinetics, competitive inhibition by synthetic/naturally occurring amino acids (AAs), exchange transport with synthetic/naturally occurring AAs and pH-dependency of anti-[(14)C]FACBC uptake. We also examined the amino acid transporter (AAT) expression using flow cytometry.  Results:   The uptake of anti-[(14)C]FACBC by LNCaP and DU145 cells was higher than that by PC-3 and PrECs. The K(m) values for anti-[(14)C]FACBC were 64.4 and 191.7 μmol/L in the DU145 cells and PrECs, respectively. Total levels of anti-[(14)C]FACBC uptake were positively correlated with the expression level of system ASC in PCa cells. The contributions of Na(+)-dependent AATs to anti-[(14)C]FACBC uptake were greater than those of Na(+)-independent AATs, especially in PCa cells. In the presence of Na(+), glutamine and serine showed the strongest inhibitory effect against anti-[(14)C]FACBC uptake, suggesting that system ASC, especially ASCT2, is an important AAT for anti-[(14)C]FACBC. In contrast, phenylalanine and 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid, but not N-ethylmaleimide, almost completely inhibited the anti-[(14)C]FACBC uptake in the absence of Na(+), indicating the contribution of LAT1. In the exchange transport experiments, glutamine showed the strongest transstimulation of intracellular anti-[(14)C]FACBC efflux in DU145 cells. Furthermore, the contributions of Na(+)-independent AATs to the uptake of anti-[(14)C]FACBC in DU145 and PrECs were greater under acidic pH conditions than under neutral or alkaline pH conditions.  Conclusions:   Total uptake of anti-[(14)C]FACBC by PCa cells correlates with the expression level of system ASC in PCa cells. Furthermore, LAT1 is an important transport system for anti-[(14)C]FACBC uptake, especially in an acidic environment, such as the intra-tumoural environment.""","""['Shuntaro Oka', 'Hiroyuki Okudaira', 'Yasunori Yoshida', 'David M Schuster', 'Mark M Goodman', 'Yoshifumi Shirakami']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Comparative evaluation of transport mechanisms of trans-1-amino-3-¹⁸Ffluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid and L-methyl-¹¹Cmethionine in human glioma cell lines.', 'Putative transport mechanism and intracellular fate of trans-1-amino-3-18F-fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid in human prostate cancer.', '(14)CFluciclovine (alias anti-(14)CFACBC) uptake and ASCT2 expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Review of 18F-Fluciclovine PET for Detection of Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of Prostate Cancer with Radiolabeled Amino Acid Analogs.', 'An overview of radiolabeled amino acid tracers in oncologic imaging.', 'Impact of 18 F-Fluciclovine PET/CT Findings on Failure-Free Survival in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer Following Salvage Radiation Therapy.', 'Differences in Failure-Free Survival After Salvage Radiotherapy Guided by Conventional Imaging Versus 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in Postprostatectomy Patients: A Post Hoc Substratification Analysis of the EMPIRE-1 Trial.', 'Effect of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on the Results of PET/CT with 18F-Fluciclovine in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Amino acid transporter expression and 18F-FACBC uptake at PET in primary prostate cancer.']"""

Some of these factors are enzymes that add or remove histone marks in the vicinity of regulatory regions of target genes. Numerous histone modifications added by specific writer enzymes and removed by eraser enzymes have been identified. Histone methylation is a modification with a complex outcome, as it can lead to gene activation or repression, depending on the modified residue and the context. Methylation marks are added by different enzyme families displaying exquisite substrate specificity. Lysine methylation is reversible and two different demethylase families have been identified in humans, the Jumonji C and the lysine-specific demethylase families. A regulatory role of histone demethylases in fine-tuning the function of steroid receptors, especially the androgen receptor and estrogen receptor, has emerged in recent years. This is mostly inferred from in vitro studies, but more recently first in vivo data have further supported this concept.

Results:   Of 436 eligible patients, 321 (74%) and 87 (20%) received at least two or four secondary HT regimens, respectively.

However, these technologies need to be further improved with regard to reproducibility and applicability to clinical samples and settings.  Methods:   Using identification of genetic variations in prostate cancer as an example we address three crucial challenges in the field of targeted re-sequencing: Small nucleotide variation (SNV) detection in samples of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue material, minimal amount of input sample and sampling in view of tissue heterogeneity.  Results:   We show that FFPE tissue material can supplement for fresh frozen tissues for the detection of SNVs and that solution-based enrichment experiments can be accomplished with small amounts of DNA with only minimal effects on enrichment uniformity and data variance.Finally, we address the question whether the heterogeneity of a tumor is reflected by different genetic alterations, e.g. different foci of a tumor display different genomic patterns. We show that the tumor heterogeneity plays an important role for the detection of copy number variations.  Conclusions:   The application of high throughput sequencing technologies in cancer genomics opens up a new dimension for the identification of disease mechanisms. In particular the ability to use small amounts of FFPE samples available from surgical tumor resections and histopathological examinations facilitates the collection of precious tissue materials. However, care needs to be taken in regard to the locations of the biopsies, which can have an influence on the prediction of copy number variations.

This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of faecal carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli strains before TRUSPB and at evaluating potential predisposing risk factors. The incidence of sepsis after prostate biopsy was determined, and our routine practice for antibiotic prophylaxis for TRUSPB was evaluated. A prospective study was conducted in 342 consecutive patients undergoing prostate biopsy between December 2009 and July 2010. Before TRUSPB, a rectal swab was cultured. The correlation between the presence of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and plausible risk factors was investigated by the use of a questionnaire. Of the 236 patients included, 22.0% (52/236) harboured ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli strains. The use of fluoroquinolones in the 6 months before biopsy was associated with an increased risk of faecal carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli strains (p <0.01). Faecal carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli strains was an important risk factor for infectious complications after TRUSPB (p <0.01). In conclusion, a significant number of patients have faecal carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli strains (22.0%) before TRUSPB. The use of fluoroquinolones in the previous 6 months before biopsy is a risk factor for faecal carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli strains and for infectious complications after TRUSPB.

In this study, a mixture of herbal extracts, Zyflamend®, was used as a treatment in a model of castrate-resistant prostate cancer using CWR22Rv1 cells. Zyflamend reduced androgen receptor and IGF-1R expression along with a reduction of IGF-1-mediated proliferation of CWR22Rv1 cells. IGF-1 induced downstream AKT phosphorylation; however, the induction of pAKT was not associated with androgen receptor expression. Further, constitutively active form of AKT had no effect on nuclear expression of androgen receptor, indicating that upregulation of pAKT did not promote androgen receptor expression or nuclear translocation in castrate-resistant CWR22Rv1 cells. Conversely, Zyflamend reduced androgen receptor expression following IGF-1 stimulation and in cells overexpressing pAKT. These results demonstrated that Zyflamend inhibited IGF-1-stimulated cell growth, IGF-1R expression, and androgen receptor expression and its nuclear localization, but these effects were not dependent upon phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/pAKT signaling.

Methods:   Prostate interfraction displacement data was collected prospectively for the first 4 fractions in 333 patients treated with IGRT with daily pre-treatment EPI or KVI orthogonal imaging. Displacement was recorded in the anteroposterior (AP), left-right (LR) and superoinferior (SI) directions. The proportion of displacement <3 mm and the difference in median absolute displacements were calculated in all directions.  Results:   1088 image pairs were analysed in total, 448 by EPI and 640 by KVI. There were 23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18-28%) more displacements under 3 mm for EPI than for KVI in the AP direction, 14% (95% CI 10-19%) more in the LR direction and 10% (95% CI 5-15%) more in the SI direction. The differences in absolute median displacement (KVI>EPI) were AP 1 mm, LR 1 mm and SI 0.5 mm. Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed that distributions were significantly different for all three dimensions (p<0.0001 for AP and LR and p=0.02 for SI).  Conclusion:   EPI has a statistically significant smaller set-up error distribution than KVI. We would expect that, because fiducial marker imaging is less clear for EPI, the clinical target volume to planning target volume margin would be greater when using IGRT; however, relying wholly on displacement data gives the opposite result.

Methods:   In phase 1, 16 men received dasatinib 50 to 120 mg once daily and docetaxel 60 to 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. In phase 2, 30 additional men received dasatinib 100 mg once daily/docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. Efficacy endpoints included changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), measurable disease, bone scans, and markers of bone metabolism. Safety and pharmacokinetics were also studied.  Results:   Combination dasatinib and docetaxel therapy was generally well tolerated. Thirteen of 46 patients (28%) had a grade 3-4 toxicity. Drug-drug interactions and a maximum tolerated dose were not identified. Durable 50% PSA declines occurred in 26 of 46 patients (57%). Of 30 patients with measurable disease, 18 (60%) had a partial response. Fourteen patients (30%) had disappearance of a lesion on bone scan. In bone marker assessments, 33 of 38 (87%) and 26 of 34 (76%) had decreases in urinary N-telopeptide or bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels, respectively. Twenty-eight patients (61%) received single-agent dasatinib after docetaxel discontinuation and had stabilization of disease for an additional 1 to 12 months.  Conclusions:   The high objective response rate and favorable toxicity profile are promising and justify randomized studies of docetaxel and dasatinib in castration-resistant PC. Parallel declines in levels of PSA and bone markers are consistent with cotargeting of epithelial and bone compartments of the cancer.

Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) is produced by the bacterial Clostridium type A strain. The transmembrane proteins claudin-3 and -4, often overexpressed in numerous human epithelial tumors (for example, colon, breast, pancreas, prostate and ovarian), are the targeted receptors for CPE. CPE binding to them triggers formation of membrane pore complexes leading to rapid cell death. In this study, we aimed at selective tumor cell killing by CPE gene transfer. We generated expression vectors bearing the bacterial wild-type CPE cDNA (wtCPE) or translation-optimized CPE (optCPE) cDNA for in vitro and in vivo gene therapy of claudin-3- and -4-overexpressing tumors. The CPE expression analysis at messenger RNA and protein level revealed more efficient expression of optCPE compared with wtCPE. Expression of optCPE showed rapid cytotoxic activity, hightened by CPE release as bystander effect. Cytotoxicity of up to 100% was observed 72 h after gene transfer and is restricted to claudin-3-and -4-expressing tumor lines. MCF-7 and HCT116 cells with high claudin-4 expression showed dramatic sensitivity toward CPE toxicity. The claudin-negative melanoma line SKMel-5, however, was insensitive toward CPE gene transfer. The non-viral intratumoral in vivo gene transfer of optCPE led to reduced tumor growth in MCF-7 and HCT116 tumor-bearing mice compared with the vector-transfected control groups. This novel approach demonstrates that CPE gene transfer can be employed for a targeted suicide gene therapy of claudin-3- and -4-overexpressing tumors, leading to the rapid and efficient tumor cell killing in vitro and in vivo.""","""['W Walther', 'S Petkov', 'O N Kuvardina', 'J Aumann', 'D Kobelt', 'I Fichtner', 'M Lemm', 'J Piontek', 'I E Blasig', 'U Stein', 'P M Schlag']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Gene Ther""","""['Rapid eradication of colon carcinoma by Clostridium perfringens Enterotoxin suicidal gene therapy.', 'Claudin-4-targeted therapy using Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin for prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of claudin-3 and claudin-4 receptors in uterine serous papillary carcinoma: novel targets for a type-specific therapy using Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE).', 'Bacterial Toxins for Oncoleaking Suicidal Cancer Gene Therapy.', 'Claudins overexpression in ovarian cancer: potential targets for Clostridium Perfringens Enterotoxin (CPE) based diagnosis and therapy.', 'Nanotechnology-enabled gene delivery for cancer and other genetic diseases.', 'Claudin and pancreatic cancer.', 'Differential Expression of Claudin 1 and 4 in Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin.', 'From Immunotoxins to Suicide Toxin Delivery Approaches: Is There a Clinical Opportunity?', 'Application of C-Terminal Clostridium Perfringens Enterotoxin in Treatment of Brain Metastasis from Breast Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Completeness of Indigenous identification was assessed for the eight Australian cancer registries using an innovative indirect assessment method based on registry-specific registration rates for smoking-related cancers. National age-standardised incidence rates and rate ratios (Indigenous:non-Indigenous) were calculated for all cancers combined and 26 individual cancer sites. Multivariate regression analysis was used to investigate trends in Indigenous cancer incidence by time or remoteness of residence, and whether the incidence rate ratio (Indigenous:non-Indigenous) was different in younger than older age-groups.  Results:   Four registries covering 84% of the Indigenous population had sufficiently complete Indigenous identification to be included in analysis. Compared to other Australians, Indigenous Australians had much higher incidence of lung and other smoking-related cancers, cervix, uterus and liver cancer, but much lower incidence of breast, prostate, testis, colorectal and brain cancer, melanoma of skin, lymphoma and leukaemia. Incidence was higher in remote areas for some cancers (including several smoking-related cancers) but lower for others. The incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for smoking-related cancers were higher in younger than older people.  Conclusions:   Indigenous Australians have a different pattern of incidence of specific cancers than other Australians and large geographical variations for several cancers.  Implications:   All cancer registries need to further improve Indigenous identification, but national Indigenous cancer incidence statistics can, and should, be regularly reported.

Glucose transporters are often used as targets for in vivo imaging of tumors. The efficiency of a tumor-seeking fluorescent probe can be enhanced by attaching one or more glucosamine (GlcN) moieties. This study was designed to evaluate the use of previously developed GlcN-linked NIRF probes for in vitro and in vivo optical imaging of cancer.  Procedures:   Cellular uptake of the probes (1 μM) was investigated in monolayer cultures of luciferase-expressing PC3 (PC3-luc) cells. The prostate tumors were established as subcutaneous xenografts using PC3-luc cells in nude mice. The biodistributions and tumor-targeting specificities of cypate (cyp), cypate-D: -(+)-glucosamine (cyp-GlcN), and D: -(+)-gluosamine-cypate-D: -(+)-gluosamine (cyp-2GlcN) were studied. The tumor, muscle, and major organs were collected for ex vivo optical imaging.  Results:   The tumor cell uptake of the probe containing two glucosamine residues, cyp-2GlcN, was significantly higher than the uptake of both the probe with one glucosamine residue, cyp-GlcN, and the probe without glucosamine, cyp only. Similarly, in in vivo experiments, cyp-2GlcN demonstrated higher maximum fluorescence intensity and longer residence lifetime in tumors than cyp-GlcN or cyp. The ex vivo biodistribution analysis revealed that tumor uptake of cyp-2GlcN and cyp-GlcN was four- and twofold higher than that of cyp at 24 h post-injection, respectively.  Conclusion:   Both cyp-GlcN and cyp-2GlcN NIRF probes exhibited good tumor-targeting properties in prostate cancer cell cultures and live mice. The cyp-2GlcN probe showed the highest uptake with good retention characteristics in vivo. The uptake of cyp-2GlcN and cyp-GlcN is likely mediated by glucosamine-recognizing transporters. The uptake mechanism is being explored further for developing cypate-glucosamine-based probes for in vivo imaging.""","""['Alexandru V Korotcov', 'Yunpeng Ye', 'Yue Chen', 'Fayun Zhang', 'Sophia Huang', 'Stephen Lin', 'Rajagopalan Sridhar', 'Samuel Achilefu', 'Paul C Wang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['cypate-d: -(+)-glucosamine (cyp-GlcN), and d: -(+)-glucosamine-cypate-d: -(+)-glucosamine (cyp-2GlcN).', 'Cypate and Cypate-Glucosamine as Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probes for In Vivo Tumor Imaging.', 'Evaluation of four affibody-based near-infrared fluorescent probes for optical imaging of epidermal growth factor receptor positive tumors.', 'Comparison of near-infrared fluorescent deoxyglucose probes with different dyes for tumor diagnosis in vivo.', 'Near-infrared fluorescent probes in cancer imaging and therapy: an emerging field.', 'Unraveling the Chemistry of meso-Cl Tricarbocyanine Dyes in Conjugation Reactions for the Creation of Peptide Bonds.', 'Enhanced Tumor Imaging Using Glucosamine-Conjugated Polyacrylic Acid-Coated Ultrasmall Gadolinium Oxide Nanoparticles in Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Magnetic Mixed Micelles Composed of a Non-Ionic Surfactant and Nitroxide Radicals Containing a D-Glucosamine Unit: Preparation, Stability, and Biomedical Application.', 'New FTY720-docetaxel nanoparticle therapy overcomes FTY720-induced lymphopenia and inhibits metastatic breast tumour growth.', 'Targeting breast cancer with sugar-coated carbon nanotubes.']"""

The aim of this study was validation of the ability of the PRIX score to predict biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy in a series of patients from a single Japanese center.  Methods:   From 1995 to 2008, 519 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer with no adjuvant therapies were included in the validation cohort. The biochemical relapse-free rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The performance of the PRIX score was assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression model, concordance index and a calibration plot. For comparison, the performance of the D'Amico classification was also assessed.  Results:   Biochemical relapse-free rate continuously decreased as the PRIX score increased. Each 1-point increment in the PRIX score led to an increase in hazard ratio for biochemical relapse. The concordance index of the PRIX score and the D'Amico classification to predict biochemical relapse was 0.719 and 0.730, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier plots and the calibration plots demonstrated the possibility that the PRIX score could present more detailed stratification than the D'Amico classification.

One radiation-induced PCA component was detected for each cell line by identification of statistically significant changes in the PCA score distributions for irradiated samples, as compared to unirradiated samples, in the first 24-72 h post-irradiation. These RS response signatures arise from radiation-induced changes in cellular concentrations of aromatic amino acids, conformational protein structures and certain nucleic acid and lipid functional groups. Correlation analysis between the radiation-induced PCA components separates the cell lines into three distinct RS response categories: R1 (H460 and MCF7), R2 (MDA-MB-231 and PC3) and R3 (DU145 and LNCaP). These RS categories partially segregate according to radiosensitivity, as the R1 and R2 cell lines are radioresistant (SF(2) > 0.6) and the R3 cell lines are radiosensitive (SF(2) < 0.5). The R1 and R2 cell lines further segregate according to p53 gene status, corroborated by cell cycle analysis post-irradiation. Potential radiation-induced biochemical response mechanisms underlying our RS observations are proposed, such as (1) the regulated synthesis and degradation of structured proteins and (2) the expression of anti-apoptosis factors or other survival signals. This study demonstrates the utility of RS for noninvasive radiobiological analysis of tumour cell radiation response, and indicates the potential for future RS studies designed to investigate, monitor or predict radiation response.""","""['Q Matthews', 'A Jirasek', 'J J Lum', 'A G Brolo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Raman spectroscopy of single human tumour cells exposed to ionizing radiation in vitro.', 'A Raman spectroscopic study of cell response to clinical doses of ionizing radiation.', 'Radiation-induced apoptosis and cell cycle alterations in human carcinoma cell lines with different radiosensitivities.', 'Overview of radiosensitivity of human tumor cells to low-dose-rate irradiation.', 'A quantitative overview of radiosensitivity of human tumor cells across histological type and TP53 status.', 'Investigating ionizing radiation-induced changes in breast cancer cells using stimulated Raman scattering microscopy.', 'Understanding radiation response and cell cycle variation in brain tumour cells using Raman spectroscopy.', 'Raman Spectroscopy Revealed Cell Passage-Dependent Distinct Biochemical Alterations in Radiation-Resistant Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Raman microspectroscopy and machine learning for use in identifying radiation-induced lung toxicity.', 'Application of Advanced Non-Linear Spectral Decomposition and Regression Methods for Spectroscopic Analysis of Targeted and Non-Targeted Irradiation Effects in an In-Vitro Model.']"""

However, their roles in tumor biology remain largely unknown. According to the assumption that miRNAs implicated in a specific tumor phenotype will show aberrant regulation of their target genes, we introduce an approach based on the miRNA target-dysregulated network (MTDN) to prioritize novel disease miRNAs. Target genes have predicted binding sites for any miRNA. The MTDN is constructed by combining computational target prediction with miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in tumor and nontumor tissues. Application of the proposed method to prostate cancer reveals that known prostate cancer miRNAs are characterized by a greater number of dysregulations and coregulators and the tendency to coregulate with each other and that they share a higher proportion of targets with other prostate cancer miRNAs. Support vector machine classifier, based on these features and changes in miRNA expression, is constructed and gives an average overall prediction accuracy of 0.8872 in cross-validation tests. The classifier is then applied to miRNAs in the MTDN. Functions enriched by dysregulated targets of novel predicted miRNAs are closely associated with oncogenesis. In addition, predicted cancer miRNAs within families or from different families show combinatorial dysregulation of target genes, as revealed by analysis of the MTDN modular organization. Finally, 3 miRNA target regulations are verified to hold in prostate cancer cells by transfection assays. These results show that the network-centric method could prioritize novel disease miRNAs and model how oncogenic lesions are mediated by miRNAs, providing important insights into tumorigenesis.""","""['Juan Xu', 'Chuan-Xing Li', 'Jun-Ying Lv', 'Yong-Sheng Li', 'Yun Xiao', 'Ting-Ting Shao', 'Xiao Huo', 'Xiang Li', 'Yan Zou', 'Qing-Lian Han', 'Xia Li', 'Li-Hua Wang', 'Huan Ren']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Global gene expression analysis reveals reduced abundance of putative microRNA targets in human prostate tumours.', 'Identification of candidate miRNA biomarkers from miRNA regulatory network with application to prostate cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis of microRNA-regulated protein interaction network reveals the tumor suppressive role of microRNA-149 in human hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting AKT-mTOR pathway.', 'MicroRNAs as regulators of signal transduction in urological tumors.', 'The microRNA signatures: aberrantly expressed miRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Prediction of miRNA-disease associations in microbes based on graph convolutional networks and autoencoders.', 'miRNA-mRNA-protein dysregulated network in COPD in women.', 'MEAHNE: miRNA-Disease Association Prediction Based on Semantic Information in a Heterogeneous Network.', 'Predicting miRNA-disease associations based on multi-view information fusion.', 'A Novel Strategy for Identifying NSCLC MicroRNA Biomarkers and Their Mechanism Analysis Based on a Brand-New CeRNA-Hub-FFL Network.']"""

In this study, we identified a FOXO1-derived peptide termed FO1-6nls that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2 (CDK1/2)-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 at the serine 249 residue in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of FO1-6nls in prostate cancer (PCa) cells not only blocked CDK1-induced cytoplasmic localization of FOXO1 but also augmented FOXO1's transcriptional activity. This effect of FO1-6nls requires its binding to CDK1 and CDK2. Moreover, the ectopic expression of FO1-6nls inhibited the growth of PTEN-positive DU145 PCa cells. Importantly, the growth-inhibitory function of FO1-6nls is dependent on FOXO1. Finally, the ectopic expression of FO1-6nls overcame CDK1-mediated inhibition of FOXO1-induced apoptosis of PCa cells.

Herein, we have used a highly disseminating variant of the human PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell line, PC-hi/diss, as a prototype of aggressive carcinomas to investigate the mechanisms whereby pro-uPA activation and uPA-generated plasmin functionally contribute to specific stages of metastasis. The PC-hi/diss cells secrete and activate significant amounts of pro-uPA, leading to efficient generation of plasmin in solution and at the cell surface. In a mouse orthotopic xenograft model, treatment with the specific pro-uPA activation-blocking antibody mAb-112 significantly inhibited local invasion and distant metastasis of the PC-hi/diss cells. To mechanistically examine the uPA/plasmin-mediated aspects of tumor cell dissemination, the anti-pro-uPA mAb-112 and the potent serine protease inhibitor, aprotinin, were used in parallel in a number of in vivo assays modeling various rate-limiting steps in early metastatic spread. Our findings demonstrate that, by generating plasmin, activated tumor-derived uPA facilitates early stages of PC-hi/diss dissemination, specifically the escape from the primary tumor and tumor cell intravasation. Moreover, through a series of in vitro and in vivo analyses, we suggest that PC-hi/diss-invasive escape and dissemination may be enhanced by cleavage of stromal fibronectin by uPA-generated plasmin.

Surprisingly, a population of enhancer modules in androgen-deprived cultures showed nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) in all three loci. Under androgen-deprived conditions, NDRs at the TMPRSS2 enhancer were maintained by the pioneer AR transcriptional collaborator GATA-2. Androgen treatment resulted in AR occupancy, an increased number of enhancer modules with NDRs without changes in footprint width, increased levels of histone H3 acetylation (AcH3), and dimethylation (H3K4me2) at nucleosomes flanking the NDRs. Our data suggest that, in the absence of ligand, AR enhancers exist in an equilibrium in which a percentage of modules are occupied by nucleosomes while others display NDRs. We propose that androgen treatment leads to the disruption of the equilibrium toward a nucleosome-depleted state, rather than to enhancer de novo ""remodeling.""

It is of clinical significance in kidney, breast, and bladder cancer. There are no data available for XPA-210 in prostate cancer (PC). Herein, we aim to determine the clinical usefulness of XPA-210 in PC.  Materials and methods:   In a retrospective study, cancer and benign tissue samples of 103 patients (median age 65 years, median PSA 9.04 ng/ml, median Gleason score 6) who underwent prostatectomy were constructed to a tissue micro array and stained for XPA-210. Semi-quantitative results were correlated with pathological and clinical data by Wilcoxon-Kruskall-Wallis and linear regression analysis. Expression levels in PC were correlated between the time of biochemical recurrence and the time to development of metastasis by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was done to correlate those with the resection status.  Results:   Mean staining score was 0.51-0.14 for tumor and benign tissue (P < 0.0001). Tumor staining score was significantly associated with Gleason score <6/≥6 (P < 0.0001) and T2/T >2 (P = 0.0007). When dividing the tumor score by the mean value, higher expression of XPA-210 was associated with a shorter time to biochemical recurrence (P = 0.003) and time to development of metastasis (P = 0.0061). Tumor staining (P = 0.0371) was an independent prognostic factor for biochemical relapse regardless of resection status.  Conclusions:   XPA-210 is a new tissue-based prognostic marker for prostate cancer histopathology.

These androgen effects as well as others would have produced a survival advantage under the severe selection pressure created by the inhumane and physiologically challenging circumstances under which the slaves were transported from the interior of the African continent and West Africa to the 'New World'. This would result in a population shift favouring increased androgen receptor responsiveness in descendants of African slaves populating the Americas and a corresponding geographic and racial distribution of androgen related phenomena such as sprinting prowess and prostate cancer. African-Americans having the highest prostate cancer incidence rate and the Caribbean having the highest prostate cancer mortality rates in the world are consistent with this hypothesis as is the observation that the 10 fastest men and 9 fastest women of all time are exclusively the descendants of West African slaves who survived the middle passage. It is predicted that as yet undiscovered as well as known biological correlates of enhanced androgen receptor responsiveness such as relatively short CAG-repeats in the poly Q tail of exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene will be more prevalent among African-Americans and Afro-Caribbean peoples than among West Africans. It is also predicted that African-Americans and Afro-Caribbean peoples will have relatively shorter CAG-repeats in the androgen receptor gene compared to West Africans.""","""['W D Aiken']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Hypotheses""","""['Extent of linkage disequilibrium between the androgen receptor gene CAG and GGC repeats in human populations: implications for prostate cancer risk.', ""The androgen receptor CAG and GGN repeat polymorphisms and prostate cancer susceptibility in African-American men: results from the Flint Men's Health Study."", 'Racial variation in CAG repeat lengths within the androgen receptor gene among prostate cancer patients of lower socioeconomic status.', 'Androgen receptor CAG repeats and prostate cancer.', 'Roots of prostate cancer in African-American men.', 'The Impact of African Ancestry on Prostate Cancer Disparities in the Era of Precision Medicine.', 'Disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates: Solvable or not?', 'Placing prostate cancer disparities within a psychosocial context: challenges and opportunities for future research.', 'Polymorphisms in CYP17 and CYP3A4 and prostate cancer in men of African descent.']"""

In contrast to the positive regulatory effect of androgens on body hair growth, they are thought to alter scalp hair follicle behaviour pathophysiologically, leading to male pattern baldness. However, the exact mechanisms of this paradoxical action have not yet been elucidated. The role of microRNAs, a novel group of noncoding RNAs impacting almost every aspect of biology, health and human diseases, has been documented in hair follicle formation. In addition, their deregulation in cancer of the prostate, a target organ of androgens, has also been well established.  Objectives:   To investigate the possible contribution of microRNAs in the pathophysiology of male pattern baldness.  Methods:   We initially screened microRNA expression profiles of balding and nonbalding hair follicle papillae with a sensitive microRNA cloning method, microRNA amplification profiling, and statistically analysed significant differentially expressed microRNAs in balding relative to nonbalding dermal papillae, with real-time polymerase chain reaction as a confirmatory method to quantify expression in eight individuals affected with the disorder.  Results:   We detected the significant upregulation of miR-221, miR-125b, miR-106a and miR-410 in balding papilla cells.

To date, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) have not demonstrated clinical efficacy in prostate cancer, with one of the major obstacles being the inability to monitor drug activity during the trial. Given the high frequency and specificity of GSTP1 DNA methylation in prostate cancer, we investigated whether GSTP1 is a useful marker of DNMTi treatment efficacy. LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) either with a single high dose (5-20 µM), every alternate day (0.1-10 µM) or daily (0.005-2.5 µM). A daily treatment regimen with 5-aza-CdR was optimal, with significant suppression of cell proliferation achieved with doses of 0.05 µM or greater (p<0.0001) and induction of cell death from 0.5 µM (p<0.0001). In contrast, treatment with a single high dose of 20 µM 5-aza-CdR inhibited cell proliferation but was not able to induce cell death. Demethylation of GSTP1 was observed with doses of 5-aza-CdR that induced significant suppression of cell proliferation (≥ 0.05 µM). Re-expression of the GSTP1 protein was observed only at doses of 5-aza-CdR (≥ 0.5 µM) associated with induction of cell death. Treatment of LNCaP cells with a more stable DNMTi, Zebularine required at least a 100-fold higher dose (≥ 50 µM) to inhibit proliferation and was less potent in inducing cell death, which corresponded to a lack of GSTP1 protein re-expression. We have shown that GSTP1 DNA methylation and protein expression status is correlated with DNMTi treatment response in prostate cancer cells. Since GSTP1 is methylated in nearly all prostate cancers, our results warrant its testing as a marker of epigenetic therapy response in future clinical trials. We conclude that the DNA methylation and protein expression status of GSTP1 are good indicators of DNMTi efficacy.""","""['Karen Chiam', 'Margaret M Centenera', 'Lisa M Butler', 'Wayne D Tilley', 'Tina Bianco-Miotto']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cytosine methylation represses glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) gene expression in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Reversal of GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation and reactivation of pi-class glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1) expression in human prostate cancer cells by treatment with procainamide.', 'Promoter demethylation and chromatin remodeling by green tea polyphenols leads to re-expression of GSTP1 in human prostate cancer cells.', ""Antineoplastic activity of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in anaplastic large cell lymphoma."", ""Epigenetic therapy of cancer with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine)."", 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Sex and Race-Related DNA Methylation Changes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Silencing of long non-coding RNA LINC01270 inhibits esophageal cancer progression and enhances chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil by mediating GSTP1methylation.', ""The Effect of 5-Aza-2'-Deoxycytidine in Combination to and in Comparison with Vorinostat on DNA Methyltransferases, Histone Deacetylase 1, Glutathione S-Transferase 1 and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Genes Expression, Cell Growth Inhibition and Apoptotic Induction in Hepatocellular LCL-PI 11 Cell Line."", 'miR-375 is downregulated by promoter hypermethylation in MIN6 insulinoma cells.']"""

However, there is evidence from in vitro experiments that in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells the AR is able to translocate into the nucleus in a ligand-independent manner. The recent finding that inhibition of the glycogen-synthase-kinase 3β (GSK-3β) induces a rapid nuclear export of the AR in androgen-stimulated prostate cancer cells prompted us to analyze the effects of a GSK-3β inhibition in the castration-resistant LNCaP sublines C4-2 and LNCaP-SSR. Both cell lines exhibit high levels of nuclear AR in the absence of androgenic stimuli. Exposure of these cells to the maleimide SB216763, a potent GSK-3β inhibitor, resulted in a rapid nuclear export of the AR even under androgen-deprived conditions. Moreover, the ability of C4-2 and LNCaP-SSR cells to grow in the absence of androgens was diminished after pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3β in vitro. The ability of SB216763 to modulate AR signalling and function in CRPC in vivo was additionally demonstrated in a modified chick chorioallantoic membrane xenograft assay after systemic delivery of SB216763. Our data suggest that inhibition of GSK-3β helps target the AR for export from the nucleus thereby diminishing the effects of mislocated AR in CRPC cells.

This in turn may result in a loss of sensitivity to physiologic levels of TGF-β in aggressive prostate cancer (CaP). The specific mechanisms of DNMT's role in CaP remain undetermined. In this study, we describe the mechanism of TGF-β-mediated DNMT in CaP and its association with clinical outcomes following radical prostatectomy.  Methodology/principal findings:   We used human CaP cell lines with varying degrees of invasive capability to describe how TGF-β mediates the expression of DNMT in CaP, and its effects on methylation status of TGF-β receptors and the invasive capability of CaP in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we determined the association between DNMT expression and clinical outcome after radical prostatectomy. We found that more aggressive CaP cells had significantly higher TGF-β levels, increased expression of DNMT, but reduced TβRs when compared to benign prostate cells and less aggressive prostate cancer cells. Blockade of TGF-β signaling or ERK activation (p-ERK) was associated with a dramatic decrease in the expression of DNMT, which results in a coincident increase in the expression of TβRs. Blockade of either TGF-β signaling or DNMT dramatically decreased the invasive capabilities of CaP. Inhibition of TGF-β in an TRAMP-C2 CaP model in C57BL/6 mice using 1D11 was associated with downregulation of DNMTs and p-ERK and impairment in tumor growth. Finally, independent of Gleason grade, increased DNMT1 expression was associated with biochemical recurrence following surgical treatment for prostate cancer.  Conclusions and significance:   Our findings demonstrate that CaP derived TGF-β may induce the expression of DNMTs in CaP which is associated with methylation of its receptors and the aggressive potential of CaP. In addition, DNMTs is an independent predictor for disease recurrence after prostatectomy, and may have clinical implications for CaP prognostication and therapy.""","""['Qiang Zhang', 'Lin Chen', 'Brian T Helfand', 'Thomas L Jang', 'Vidit Sharma', 'James Kozlowski', 'Timothy Michael Kuzel', 'Lihua J Zhu', 'Ximing J Yang', 'Borko Javonovic', 'Yinglu Guo', 'Scott Lonning', 'Jay Harper', 'Beverly A Teicher', 'Charles Brendler', 'Nengwang Yu', 'William J Catalona', 'Chung Lee']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated transforming growth factor-beta-induced expression of vimentin is an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'DNA methyltransferase and demethylase in human prostate cancer.', 'Transforming growth factor β1 induces the expression of collagen type I by DNA methylation in cardiac fibroblasts.', 'Angiogenesis, p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in the progression of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Mysteries of TGF-β Paradox in Benign and Malignant Cells.', 'Downregulation of CAMK2N1 due to DNA Hypermethylation Mediated by DNMT1 that Promotes the Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'TGF-β controls stromal telomere length through epigenetic modifications.', 'Emerging role of different DNA methyltransferases in the pathogenesis of cancer.', 'Structural insight into ASH1L PHD finger recognizing methylated histone H3K4 and promoting cell growth in prostate cancer.', 'The Interplay Between Prostate Cancer Genomics, Metabolism, and the Epigenome: Perspectives and Future Prospects.']"""

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) form a class of non-coding small RNA molecules considered to be key regulators of gene expression. Their dysregulation has been shown to play a role in cancer onset, progression and metastasis, and miRNAs represent a promising new class of cancer biomarkers. The objective of this study was to identify down- and up-regulated miRNAs in prostate cancer that could provide potential biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for prostate cancer metastasis.  Methods:   Next generation sequencing technology was applied to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in a transplantable metastatic versus a non-metastatic prostate cancer xenograft line, both derived from one patient's primary cancer. The xenografts were developed via subrenal capsule grafting of cancer tissue into NOD/SCID mice, a methodology that tends to preserve properties of the original cancers (e.g., tumor heterogeneity, genetic profiles).  Results:   Differentially expressed known miRNAs, isomiRs and 36 novel miRNAs were identified.

Despite the importance of matrix remodeling, systematic and quantitative studies on the process have largely been lacking. Furthermore, it remains unclear if the disrupted tensional homeostasis characteristic of malignancy is due to initially altered ECM and tissue properties, or to the alteration of the tissue by tumor cells. To explore these questions, we studied matrix remodeling by two different prostate cancer cell lines in a three-dimensional collagen system. Over one week, we monitored structural changes in gels of varying collagen content using confocal reflection microscopy and quantitative image analysis, tracking metrics of fibril fraction, pore size, and fiber length and diameter. Gels that were seeded with no cells (control), LNCaP cells, and DU-145 cells were quantitatively compared. Gels with higher collagen content initially had smaller pore sizes and higher fibril fractions, as expected. However, over time, LNCaP- and DU-145-populated matrices showed different structural properties compared both to each other and to the control gels, with LNCaP cells appearing to favor microenvironments with lower collagen fiber fractions and larger pores than DU-145 cells. We posit that the DU-145 cells' preference for denser matrices is due to their higher invasiveness and proteolytic capabilities. Inhibition of matrix proteases resulted in reduced fibril fractions for high concentration gels seeded with either cell type, supporting our hypothesis. Our novel quantitative results probe the dynamics of gel remodeling in three dimensions and suggest that prostate cancer cells remodel their ECM in a synergistic manner that is dependent on both initial matrix properties as well as their invasiveness.""","""['Dewi Harjanto', 'Joseph S Maffei', 'Muhammad H Zaman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The phenotype of cancer cell invasion controlled by fibril diameter and pore size of 3D collagen networks.', 'Time-lapse confocal reflection microscopy of collagen fibrillogenesis and extracellular matrix assembly in vitro.', 'Pore size variable type I collagen gels and their interaction with glioma cells.', 'Toward single cell traction microscopy within 3D collagen matrices.', 'Mechanical homeostasis in tissue equivalents: a review.', 'Network and functional analyses of differentially expressed genes in gastric cancer provide new biomarkers associated with disease pathogenesis.', 'Development of a scoring function for comparing simulated and experimental tumor spheroids.', '3D microfluidics-assisted modeling of glucose transport in placental malaria.', 'Prostate cancer histopathology using label-free multispectral deep-UV microscopy quantifies phenotypes of tumor aggressiveness and enables multiple diagnostic virtual stains.', 'A novel jamming phase diagram links tumor invasion to non-equilibrium phase separation.']"""

However, the association of genomic variation of CRYAB and breast cancer is not well studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of polymorphic genotypes of CRYAB with breast cancer within a Taiwanese population.  Patients and methods:   In this hospital-based study, 1232 patients with breast cancer and an equal number of healthy controls in central Taiwan were genotyped via polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and the association of CRYAB A-1215G (rs2228387), C-802G (rs14133) and intron 2 (rs2070894) polymorphisms with breast cancer risk in a central Taiwanese population was investigated.  Results:   Those individuals with CRYAB C-802G CG and GG genotypes had 1.50- and 2.22-fold risk for breast cancer than those with the CC genotype. As for the A-1215G and intron 2 polymorphisms, there was no significant association of the genotype with breast cancer risk. In allelic frequency analysis, the G allele CRYAB C-802G conferred a significantly (p=5.63×10(-10)) increased risk of breast cancer.

As circulating chromogranin-A (CgA) levels are found to correlate with tumor progression and the status of hormone refractoriness, our current study attempted to assess whether CgA-positive cells would be preferentially distributed in epithelial structures with FBCLD. Paraffin-embedded specimens from 50 patients with organ-confined prostate cancer were subjected to double immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibodies to basal cells and CgA. From each case, 3-5 randomly selected fields were digitally photographed and the photos were magnified 400% and the numbers of CgA-positive cells in epithelial structures with non-disrupted, focally disrupted, and lost basal cell layer were separately counted. The averaged number of cell for each category was statistically compared with the Pearson's Chi-square test. In addition, morphologically similar structures with and without CgA-positive cell clusters were microdissected from four selected cases and subjected to a comparison of differential micro-RNA expression levels. Our study revealed that, although isolated CgA-positive cells were seen in both the basal cell layer and the luminal cell population in all cases, only 8 cases (16%) harbored large clusters of CgA-positive cells that were concentrated in a given area, in which all or nearly all cells appeared to share a similar morphological and immunohistochemical profile. Microdissected epithelial structures with CgA-positive cell clusters exhibited a more than 5- and 7-fold lower expression of miR-146a and miR-146b-5p than their CgA-negative counterparts. As focal basal cell layer disruptions and the reduction or loss of miR-146a and miR-146b-5p has been documented to correlate with prostate tumor invasion and hormone refractoriness, our findings suggest that aberrant CgA expression in epithelial structures with FBCLD may represent an early sign of these events.""","""['Y G Man', 'S W Fu', 'A J Liu', 'A Stojadinovic', 'M J Izadjoo', 'L Chen', 'W A Gardner']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Genomics Proteomics""","""['Focal degeneration of basal cells and the resultant auto-immunoreactions: a novel mechanism for prostate tumor progression and invasion.', 'Cell clusters overlying focally disrupted mammary myoepithelial cell layers and adjacent cells within the same duct display different immunohistochemical and genetic features: implications for tumor progression and invasion.', 'Differential impact of tumor-infiltrating immune cells on basal and luminal cells: implications for tumor invasion and metastasis.', 'The prognostic role of immunohistochemical chromogranin a expression in prostate cancer patients is significantly modified by androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'The most likely but largely ignored triggering factor for breast (or all) cancer invasion.', 'The most effective but largely ignored target for prostate cancer early detection and intervention.', 'Urine Cell-Free MicroRNAs in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'MiR-455-5p Suppresses the Progression of Prostate Cancer by Targeting CCR5.', 'Tumour budding in rectal cancer.

This study was initiated to examine a potential beneficial effect of these drugs on prostate cancer (PC) development. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 106 patients under long-term treatment with antiepileptic drugs and known HDACi properties were examined. PSA represents a hallmark in the early detection of PC, and its levels may predict an invasive disease in subsequent years. For in-vitro experiments, the PC cell line LNCaP was treated with HDACi drugs; subsequently, PSA and further PC markers were assessed. When men over 50 years of age were treated with HDACi drugs they had lower age-corrected PSA levels compared with control groups, according to the following ranking: valproic acid>levetiracetam>carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine>lamotrigine. Furthermore, there was a correlation between PSA reduction and the number of HDACi drugs within the medication, lending credence to the idea that a synergistic effect might be possible. Moreover, in vitro, HDACi drugs decrease PSA on mRNA and protein levels and exhibit further oncoprotective properties.The fact that HDACi drugs exert antiproliferative effects on neoplastic cells in vitro and in vivo, which are paralleled by expression alterations of aberrantly regulated genes, underlines the potential therapeutic value of HDACi drugs. These data suggest that long-term HDACi treatment can positively influence the characteristically slow transformation of tumour precursor cells in the prostate and may thus reduce a patient's risk of developing PC.""","""['Mark Stettner', 'Günter Krämer', 'Arne Strauss', 'Tatjana Kvitkina', 'Sandra Ohle', 'Bernd C Kieseier', 'Paul Thelen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Expressional changes after histone deacetylase inhibition by valproic acid in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Formation of AR-SMRT binding in prostate cancer cells treated with natural histone deacetylase inhibitor.', 'Effects of Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor (HDACi); Trichostatin-A (TSA) on the expression of housekeeping genes.', 'Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for prostate specific antigen in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors for cardiovascular conditions and healthy longevity.', 'Use of Antiepileptic Drugs and Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Case-Control Study in Prostate Cancer Data Base Sweden.', ""From HDAC to Voltage-Gated Ion Channels: What's Next?

So far, only one study has compared the prognostic abilities of worst (WGS) and overall (OGS) modified Gleason scores after the ISUP 2005 conference. Prostatic needle biopsies are individually paraffin-embedded in 57% of European pathology laboratories, whereas the rest of laboratories embed multiple (2 - 6) biopsies per one paraffin-block. Differences in the processing method can have a far-reaching effect, because reporting of the Gleason score (GS) is different for individually embedded and pooled biopsies, and GS is one of the most important factors when selecting treatment for patients.  Methods:   The study material consisted of needle biopsies from 236 prostate cancer patients that were endocrine-treated in 1999-2003. Biopsies from left side and right side were embedded separately. Haematoxylin-eosin-stained slides were scanned and analyzed on web-based virtual microscopy. Worst and overall Gleason scores were assessed according to the modified Gleason score schema after analyzing each biopsy separately. The compound Gleason scores (CGS) were obtained from the original pathology reports. Two different grade groupings were used: GS 6 or less vs. 7 vs. 8 or above; and GS 7(3 + 4) or less vs. 7(4 + 3) and 8 vs. 9-10. The prognostic ability of the three scoring methods to predict biochemical progression was compared with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.  Results:   The median follow-up time of the patients was 64.5 months (range 0-118). The modified GS criteria led to upgrading of the Gleason sums compared to the original CGS from the pathology reports 1999-2003 (mean 7.0 for CGS, 7.5 for OGS, 7.6 for WGS). In 43 cases WGS was > OGS. In a univariate analysis the relative risks were 2.1 (95%-confidence interval 1.8-2.4) for CGS, 2.5 (2.1-2.8) for OGS, and 2.6 (2.2-2.9) for WGS. In a multivariate analysis, OGS was the only independent prognostic factor.  Conclusions:   All of the three Gleason scoring methods are strong predictors of biochemical recurrence. The use of modified Gleason scoring leads to upgrading of GS, but also improves the prognostic value of the scoring. No significant prognostic differences between OGS and WGS could be shown, which may relate to the apparent narrowing of the GS scale from 2-10 to 5-10 due to the recent modifications.""","""['Teemu T Tolonen', 'Paula M Kujala', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Vilppu J Tuominen', 'Jorma J Isola', 'Tapio Visakorpi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Outcomes of Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer with minimal amounts (<6%) vs ≥6% of Gleason pattern 4 tissue in needle biopsy specimens.', 'Upgrading and downgrading of prostate cancer from biopsy to radical prostatectomy: incidence and predictive factors using the modified Gleason grading system and factoring in tertiary grades.', 'Role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to predict postoperative Gleason score upgrading in prostate cancer with Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20094.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Nomogram for predicting the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.', 'The prognostic impact of lung adenocarcinoma predominance classification relating to pathological factors in lobectomy, the Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry Database in 2010.', 'AI Model for Prostate Biopsies Predicts Cancer Survival.', 'Utility of Newly Proposed Grading System From International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer for Invasive Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'A Grading System for Invasive Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma: A Proposal From the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Pathology Committee.']"""

The authors notice the slight decrease of treatment quality with increase of time gap between the clinical image set acquisition and the patient irradiation. 4D analysis of dose-volume-histograms (DVHs) for prostate: CTV1 = PTV, and urethra, rectum, and bladder as organs at risk (OARs) and conformity index (COIN) is presented, demonstrating the effect of prostate, OARs, and needles displacement.  Results:   The authors show that in the case that the patient body movement/anatomy alteration takes place, this results in modification of DVHs and radiobiological parameters, hence the plan quality. The observed average displacement of needles (1 mm) and of prostate (0.57 mm) is quite small as compared with the average displacement noted in several other reports [A. A. Martinez et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 49(1), 61-69 (2001); S. J. Damore et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 46(5), 1205-1211 (2000); P. J. Hoskin et al., Radiotherm. Oncol. 68(3), 285-288 (2003); E.

Conclusions:   Although the decrease of quality of dosimetric and radiobiological parameters occurs, this does not cause clinically unacceptable changes to the 3D dose distribution, according to our clinical protocol.""","""['Natasa Milickovic', 'Panayiotis Mavroidis', 'Nikolaos Tselis', 'Iliyana Nikolova', 'Zaira Katsilieri', 'Vasiliki Kefala', 'Nikolaos Zamboglou', 'Dimos Baltas']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['3-D conformal HDR brachytherapy as monotherapy for localized prostate cancer.

Human prostate cancer tissues and in vitro and in vivo models were used to verify this hypothesis. We demonstrated that tumor cells continuously treated with bicalutamide (BCLT) or cultured in androgen-depleted medium progressively acquire higher DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity and expression than cells cultured in standard condition. Increased DNMT expression and activity also paralleled the up-regulation of truncated AR isoforms, which favors the development of the hormone-resistant phenotype. After androgen stimulation with 10(-12) m dihydrotestosterone, DNMT activity was significantly reduced in comparison with hormonal therapy. Consistent with these observations, the silencing of DNMT3a and DNMT3b significantly decreased the DNMT activity levels. These findings were also directly correlated with phosphatase and tensin homolog down-regulation and activation of ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases/AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homolog pathways. The use of a pan-DNMT inhibitor (5-Azacitidine) greatly reduced the development of the hormone-resistant phenotype induced by long-term BCLT treatment, and this finding correlated with low DNMT activity. The regulation of DNMT activity was, in some measure, dependent on the androgen receptor, as small interfering RNA treatment targeting the androgen receptor greatly decreased the modulation of DNMT activity under androgenic and antiandrogenic stimulation. These observations were correlated in vivo in patients, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Patients treated by BCLT before surgery had higher DNMT3a and DNMT3b expression than patients who had not undergone this treatment.

Objective:   To determine the long-term effect of vitamin E and selenium on risk of prostate cancer in relatively healthy men.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 35,533 men from 427 study sites in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico were randomized between August 22, 2001, and June 24, 2004. Eligibility criteria included a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 4.0 ng/mL or less, a digital rectal examination not suspicious for prostate cancer, and age 50 years or older for black men and 55 years or older for all others. The primary analysis included 34,887 men who were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: 8752 to receive selenium; 8737, vitamin E; 8702, both agents, and 8696, placebo. Analysis reflect the final data collected by the study sites on their participants through July 5, 2011.

Methods:   A manualised CECT programme was delivered to 12 couples facing a diagnosis of PCa within the previous 12 months by psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. Participants completed measures of psychological distress, marital function and coping pattern before and after CECT. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine couples shortly after the completion of CECT.  Results:   The application of CECT was both feasible and acceptable as indicated by favourable participant compliance (10 of the 12 couples attended all six designated sessions), completion of measures before and after CECT and participation in semi-structured interviews by nine couples. Preliminary results included reduced levels of avoidance and hyperarousal after the programme, with this effect stronger in partners than in patients. Interviews demonstrated that couples valued the therapist's contribution to their overall care.  Conclusions:   Previous research suggests that a couple-focused psychological intervention is desirable in the context of early stage PCa. This pilot study has established that CECT is acceptable, feasible and valued by couples facing a recent PCa diagnosis and demonstrates a potential for reduced psychological distress following CECT.

A technically robust ELISA assay specific for a MMP-2, -9 and -13 neo-epitope was produced and seen to be statistically elevated in BDL rats compared to baseline levels as well as significantly elevated in CCL4 rats stratified according to the amount of total collagen in the livers. CO1-764 levels also correlated significantly with total liver collagen and type I collagen mRNA expression in the livers.

Among the most frequent cancer sites, it is the one with the lowest available knowledge about etiology. Smoking and alcohol apparently do not play a role. Regarding food intake, indications exist for a protective association to tomatoes or lycopene consumption and a protective association was also seen with high physical activity, while risk seems to be elevated in obese men. Associations to hormonal factors have been observed and are under consideration. Trials with potential chemopreventive agents have been unsuccessful so far. For early detection, digital rectal examination has been part of the German statutory early detection program"" from the very beginning in 1971 and the test for prostate specific antigen (PSA) is being used in the framework of the so-called individual health services, both without scientific evidence of effectiveness. The available data show that the progression of prostate cancer to the leading male cancer site was chiefly driven by the unstructured introduction of the PSA test as a screening tool. Cynically addressed, the figures indicate that the most efficient known preventive intervention was not to attend screening. This delicate situation should, however, not discourage from further examinations of prostate cancer screening. Recent results including the European randomized prostate cancer screening study (ERSPC) indicated that intelligently structured screening, possibly even using the PSA test, might be effective.

Furthermore, higher levels of activated YB-1 and clusterin are seen in taxane-resistant, compared with parental, prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of either YB-1 or clusterin sensitized prostate cancer cells to paclitaxel, whereas their overexpression increased resistance to taxane. Clusterin overexpression rescued cells from increased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis following YB-1 knockdown; in contrast, however, YB-1 overexpression did not rescue cells from increased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis following clusterin knockdown.

Methods:   Between 1992 and 2002, 94 patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer with distant metastases in our facility. Various pretreatment clinical findings including serum PSA, testosterone, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), digital rectal examination (DRE) and extension of disease score were investigated for predicting outcomes in step-up hormonal treatment. We also investigated the impact of pathological findings including Gleason grading, tumor volume indices, various Gleason grade 5 volume indices in biopsy specimens, and post-treatment PSA nadir following step-up hormonal treatment on overall survival.  Results:   The 3- and 5-year overall survival was 72.4% and 62.5%, respectively. According to univariate analyses, patients with PSA ≤ 100 ng ml(-1), ALP <440 IU l(-1), T1c to T3 on DRE, extension of disease (EOD) score 0-3, no Gleason grade 5 cancer in biopsy specimens or less such cancer and good response at any stage of hormonal therapy had significantly better overall survival than did patients with alternative status. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model revealed that PSA nadir after first-line hormonal treatment, PSA nadir after second-line treatment and Gleason grade 5 volume index were independent prognostic factors.  Conclusions:   Even in very advanced prostate cancer, local pathological indices, a Gleason grade 5 volume index in particular, could differentiate patients with better prognosis from worse prognosis.

Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed with individual-level characteristics at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level.  Results:   The age-standardized prostate cancer mortality rate was 1.5 times higher in men living in high-deprivation neighborhoods than in those living in the most affluent neighborhoods. Mortality rates were also associated with certain individual-level characteristics, that is, age, marital status, family income, educational attainment, immigration status, urban/rural status, mobility and comorbidity. For example, there was a strong relationship between prostate cancer mortality and being unmarried, having a low income or educational attainment, and hospitalization for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the full model, the risk of prostate cancer mortality was 25% higher in men living in the most deprived neighborhoods than in those living in the most affluent neighborhoods.

MAK associates with CDH1 (FZR1, fizzy/cell division cycle 20 related 1) and phosphorylates CDH1 at sites phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases. When MAK is overexpressed, the binding of CDH1 to anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome decreased, resulting in an attenuation of anaphase-promoting complex/C ubiquitin ligase activity and the consequential stabilization of the CDH1 targets such as Aurora kinase A and Polo-like kinase 1. As such, overexpression of MAK leads to mitotic defects such as centrosome amplification and lagging chromosomes. Our immunohistochemistry result showed that MAK is overexpressed in prostate tumor tissues, suggesting a role of MAK in prostate carcinogenesis.

Results:   Absence of high-risk factors in clinical stage (≤ T2b), Gleason score (≤ 7), and pretreatment PSA (≤ 20 ng/mL) was significantly associated with achieving nPSA <0.5 ng/mL. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients achieving nPSA <0.5 ng/mL had significantly higher long-term freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) than nonresponders (5-year FFBF: 95.2 ± 0.8% vs. 71.5 ± 6.7%; p < 0.0005). Among responders, those who achieved nPSA <0.5 ng/mL in ≤ 5 years had higher FFBF than those requiring >5 years (5-year FFBF: 96.7 ± 0.7% vs. 80.8 ± 4.6%; p < 0.0005). On multivariate analysis, patients who achieved nPSA <0.5 ng/mL in ≤ 5 years had significantly higher FFBF than other patients.  Conclusions:   Pretreatment risk factors (clinical tumor stage, Gleason score, pretreatment PSA) strongly predict for patients achieving nPSA <0.5 ng/mL following brachytherapy, and this cohort had significantly higher long-term FFBF.""","""['Eric C Ko', 'Nelson N Stone', 'Richard G Stock']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['PSA nadir predicts biochemical and distant failures after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a multi-institutional analysis.', 'Radiation dose predicts for biochemical control in intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Improved biochemical relapse-free survival with increased external radiation doses in patients with localized prostate cancer: the combined experience of nine institutions in patients treated in 1994 and 1995.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Ten-year disease free survival after transperineal sonography-guided iodine-125 brachytherapy with or without 45-gray external beam irradiation in the treatment of patients with clinically localized, low to high Gleason grade prostate carcinoma.', 'Prostate brachytherapy with iodine-125 seeds: analysis of a single institutional cohort.', 'Prostate-specific antigen nadir within 12 months as an early surrogate marker of biochemical failure and distant metastasis after low-dose-rate brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of PSA value at last follow-up of patients who underwent low-dose rate brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'A comparative study of radical prostatectomy and permanent seed brachytherapy for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Long term outcome and side effects in patients receiving low-dose I125 brachytherapy: a retrospective analysis.']"""

Methods and materials:   The self-reported questionnaires (before RT, 1 month after RT, and every 6 months for ≤3 years after RT) of 586 patients were available. The peak incontinence (P_INC) and two longitudinal definitions (chronic incontinence [C_INC], defined as the persistence of Grade 1 or greater incontinence after any Grade 2-3 event; and mean incontinence score [M_INC], defined as the average score during the 3-year period after RT) were considered. The correlation between the clinical/dosimetric parameters (including rectal dose-volume histograms) and P_INC (Grade 2 or greater), C_INC, and M_INC of ≥1 were investigated using multivariate logistic analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve were used to assess the predictive value of the different multivariate models.  Results:   Of the 586 patients, 36 with a Grade 1 or greater incontinence score before RT were not included in the present analysis. Of the 550 included patients, 197 (35.8%) had at least one control with a Grade 1 or greater incontinence score (M_INC >0). Of these 197 patients, 37 (6.7%), 22 (4.0%), and 17 (3.1%) were scored as having P_INC, M_INC ≥1, and C_INC, respectively. On multivariate analysis, Grade 2 or greater acute incontinence was the only predictor of P_INC (odds ratio [OR], 5.9; p = .0009). Grade 3 acute incontinence was predictive of C_INC (OR, 9.4; p = .02), and percentage of the rectal volume receiving >40 Gy of ≥80% was predictive of a M_INC of ≥1 (OR, 3.8; p = .008) and of C_INC (OR, 3.6; p = .03). Previous bowel disease, previous abdominal/pelvic surgery, and the use of antihypertensive (protective factor) correlated highly with both C_INC and M_INC ≥1. The predictive values of the models for C_INC (area under the curve, 0.83) and M_INC ≥1 (area under the curve, 0.73) were greater than the ones for P_INC (area under the curve, 0.62) and more reliable (p = .0001-.0003 against p = .02). Nomograms for the two longitudinal definitions were derived.  Conclusions:   The longitudinal definitions of fecal incontinence (C_INC and M_INC ≥1) were helpful in accounting for both the persistence and the severity of the incontinence.

Abiraterone acetate was developed to specifically inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP)17A1, which is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of testosterone. In a pivotal phase III trial in patients with metastatic CRPC who have previously received docetaxel-containing chemotherapy, abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily significantly prolonged overall survival compared with placebo plus prednisone. In this trial, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone was significantly more effective than placebo plus prednisone in prolonging the time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression and in prolonging progression-free survival. Significantly more abiraterone acetate plus prednisone recipients than placebo plus prednisone recipients were considered to be responders, when assessed by PSA levels or radiographic imaging. Treatment with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in the phase III trial was associated with an acceptable tolerability profile, which was generally similar to that of the placebo plus prednisone group. However, adverse events of special interest (e.g. cardiac disorders and liver-function test abnormalities and adverse events resulting from elevated mineralocorticoid levels because of CYP17A1 inhibition [i.e. fluid retention and oedema, hypokalaemia, hypertension]) occurred in significantly more abiraterone acetate plus prednisone than in placebo plus prednisone recipients.""","""['Lily P H Yang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Drugs""","""['Abiraterone acetate: a guide to its use in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate: a novel therapeutic option in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate: a review of its use in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Effect of abiraterone acetate and prednisone compared with placebo and prednisone on pain control and skeletal-related events in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis of data from the COU-AA-301 randomised trial.', 'Abiraterone plus Prednisone in Metastatic, Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Tight binding of cytochrome b5 to cytochrome P450 17A1 is a critical feature of stimulation of C21 steroid lyase activity and androgen synthesis.', 'Obesity-induced excess of 17-hydroxyprogesterone promotes hyperglycemia through activation of glucocorticoid receptor.', 'Considerations for interactions of drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19 with anti-cancer treatments.', 'Abiraterone and prednisone therapy may cause severe hypoglycemia when administered to prostate cancer patients with type 2 diabetes receiving glucose-lowering agents.', 'Systemic treatment for metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   A convenience sample of cancer survivors residing in Connecticut were invited to complete a self-administered (print or online) needs assessment (English or Spanish). Participants identified commonly occurring problems and completed a modified version of the Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form (SNCS-SF34) assessing needs across five domains (psychosocial, health systems/information, physical/daily living, patient care /support, and sexuality).  Results:   The majority of the 1,516 cancer survivors (76.4%) were women, 47.5% had completed high school or some college, 66.1% were diagnosed ≤5 years ago, and 87.7% were non-Hispanic white. The breast was the most common site (47.6%), followed by the prostate, colorectal, lung, and melanoma. With multivariate adjustment, need on the SCNS-SF34 was greatest among women, younger survivors, those diagnosed within the past year, those not free of cancer, and Hispanics/Latinos. We also observed some differences by insurance and education status. In addition, we assessed the prevalence of individual problems, with the most common being weight gain/loss, memory changes, paying for care, communication, and not being told about services.  Conclusions:   Overall and domain specific needs in this population of cancer survivors were relatively low, although participants reported a wide range of problems. Greater need was identified among cancer survivors who were female, younger, Hispanic/Latino, and recently diagnosed.

Clinical trials targeting the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) in different tumors, including prostate cancer, are under way. Although studies on the IGF axis in prostate cancer have already entered into clinical trials, the expression and functional role of the IGF axis in benign prostate and in prostate cancer needs to be better defined. We determined mRNA expression levels of the IGF axis in microdissected tissue specimens of local prostate cancer using quantitative PCR. All members of the IGF axis, including IGF1, IGF2, IGF binding proteins 1 through 6, and insulin receptor, were measured in both the stromal and epithelial compartments of the prostate. IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, and insulin receptor were down-regulated in local prostate cancer tissue compared with matched benign tissue, suggesting that the IGF axis is not induced during prostate cancer development. Using a new prostate epithelial differentiation model, we demonstrate that the expression of the IGF axis is enhanced during normal prostate epithelial differentiation and regulated by tumor growth factor (TGF)-β. Our data reveal a functional role of the IGF axis in prostate differentiation, underscoring the importance of the IGF axis in normal development and emphasizing the importance of accurate target validation before moving to advanced clinical trials.""","""['Petra Massoner', 'Michael Ladurner Rennau', 'Isabel Heidegger', 'Anita Kloss-Brandstätter', 'Monika Summerer', 'Eva Reichhart', 'Georg Schäfer', 'Helmut Klocker']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['The effect on the insulin-like growth factor system in human prostate epithelial cells of immortalization and transformation by simian virus-40 T antigen.', 'Diverse functions of IGF/insulin signaling in malignant and noncancerous prostate cells: proliferation in cancer cells and differentiation in noncancerous cells.', 'Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in the prostate and in prostate cancer: local production, distribution and secretion pattern indicate a role in stromal-epithelial interaction.', 'Role of the adjacent stroma cells in prostate cancer development and progression: synergy between TGF-β and IGF signaling.', 'Peptide growth factors in the prostate as mediators of stromal epithelial interaction.', 'Periprostatic adipose tissue promotes prostate cancer resistance to docetaxel by paracrine IGF-1 upregulation of TUBB2B beta-tubulin isoform.', 'Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor affects the survival of primary prostate cancer patients depending on TMPRSS2-ERG status.', 'Does milk intake promote prostate cancer initiation or progression via effects on insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)?

The androgen receptor (AR) is a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in normal and cancerous prostate tissue. AR interacts with a number of proteins modulating its stability, localization, and activity. To test the hypothesis that an increased expression of AR partners might foster tumor development, we immunopurified AR partners in human tumors xenografted into mice. One of the identified AR partners was the multifunctional enzyme carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD), which catalyzes the 3 initial steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis. We combined experiments in C4-2, LNCaP, 22RV1, and PC3 human prostate cell lines and analysis of frozen radical prostatectomy samples to study the CAD-AR interaction. We show here that in prostate tumor cells, CAD fosters AR translocation into the nucleus and stimulates its transcriptional activity. Notably, in radical prostatectomy specimens, CAD expression was not correlated with proliferation markers, but a higher CAD mRNA level was associated with local tumor extension (P=0.049) and cancer relapse (P=0.017). These results demonstrate an unsuspected function for a key metabolic enzyme and identify CAD as a potential predictive marker of cancer relapse.""","""['Aurélie Morin', 'Lauriane Fritsch', 'Jacques R R Mathieu', 'Cristèle Gilbert', 'Basma Guarmit', 'Virginie Firlej', 'Catherine Gallou-Kabani', 'Annick Vieillefond', 'Nicolas Barry Delongchamps', 'Florence Cabon']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""FASEB J""","""['Appearance of CAD activity, the rate-limiting enzyme for pyrimidine biosynthesis, as B cells progress into and through the G1 stage of the cell cycle.', 'Quantitative phosphoproteomics reveal mTORC1 activates de novo pyrimidine synthesis.', 'Androgen receptor stabilization in recurrent prostate cancer is associated with hypersensitivity to low androgen.', 'Pyrimidine Biosynthetic Enzyme CAD: Its Function, Regulation, and Diagnostic Potential.', 'CAD gene sequence and the domain structure of the mammalian multifunctional protein CAD.', 'A Five Glutamine-Associated Signature Predicts Prognosis of Prostate Cancer and Links Glutamine Metabolism with Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Texture analysis based on PI-RADS 4/5-scored magnetic resonance images combined with machine learning to distinguish benign lesions from prostate cancer.', 'Key Enzymes in Pyrimidine Synthesis, CAD and CPS1, Predict Prognosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Identification of Genes Required for Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro.', 'Comprehensive analysis reveals a metabolic ten-gene signature in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Here, we examine cytosine-phosphorothioate-guanine (CpG)-DNA oligonucleotides (ODN) to boost cytokine responses and costimulatory molecule expression on murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (mBMDC). Furthermore, we evaluate the potency of a PSA-peptide based vaccine in combination with CpG-DNA to elicit specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses.  Materials and methods:   mBMDC were stimulated with CpG-DNA (1668: 5'-TCCATGACGTTCCTGATGCT-3') or non-stimulatory control-ODN (1720: 5'-TCCATGAGCTTCCTGATGCT-3'). Subsequently, expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 and induction of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12) were analyzed. For induction of PSA-peptide specific CTL, female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with PSA-peptide 65-73 (HCIRNKSVI) alone or in combination with 1668 or 1720-ODN. In vivo cytotoxicity assay determined PSA-peptide specific cytotoxicity 1 week after vaccination.  Results:   Treatment of mBMDC with stimulatory CpG-DNA ODN resulted in pronounced up-regulation of costimulatory molecule expression on mBMDC in a dose-dependent manner. CpG-ODN significantly increased production of IL-6 and IL-12 in mBMDC (P < 0.001). Induction of PSA-peptide specific CTL responses in mice immunized with PSA-peptide and CpG-DNA were significantly greater than those of PSA-peptide and control-ODN immunized mice or PSA-peptide only vaccination.  Conclusions:   CpG-DNA acts as potent adjuvant for vaccination therapies and elicits profound PSA-peptide specific CTL responses in combination with an immunodominant PSA-peptide. CpG-ODN mediated immunotherapy represents a potentially inexpensive, safe, easy-to-produce, and easy-to-handle treatment alternative.

We recently synthesized a novel bone-seeking agent by coupling a bisphosphonate with the (68)Ga chelator 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA). This study presents a first report on the potential of this (68)Ga bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical in the detection of bone metastases.  Methods:   4-Amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate was conjugated with 2-[4,7-di(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazonan-1-yl]pentanedioic acid, yielding 2-[4,7-di(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazonan-1-yl]-5-[(4-hydroxy-4,4-diphosphonobutyl)amino]-5-oxopentanoic acid (NOTA-BP).

Results:   The labeling of NOTA-BP with (68)Ga was completed by heating for 10 min. [(68)Ga]NOTA-BP was determined to have a radiochemical purity of over 95%, a high affinity for hydroxyapatite and a high stability in plasma.

However, the low in vivo stability of BN conjugates may limit their clinical application. In an attempt to improve their pharmacokinetics and counteract their rapid enzymatic degradation, we prepared a series of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-ylated BN(7-14) analogues for radiolabeling with (99m)Tc(CO)(3) and evaluated them in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Derivatization of a stabilized (N(α)His)Ac-BN(7-14)[Cha(13),Nle(14)] analogue with linear PEG molecules of various sizes [5 kDa (PEG(5)), 10 kDa (PEG(10)) and 20 kDa (PEG(20))] was performed by PEGylation of the ɛ-amino group of a β(3)hLys-βAla-βAla spacer between the stabilized BN sequence and the (N(α)His)Ac chelator. The analogues were then radiolabeled by employing the (99m)Tc-tricarbonyl technique. Binding affinity and internalization/externalization studies were performed in vitro in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells. Stability was investigated in vitro in human plasma and in vivo in Balb/c mice. Finally, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/X-ray computed tomography studies were performed in nude mice bearing PC-3 tumor xenografts.  Results:   PEGylation did not affect the binding affinity of BN analogues, as the binding affinity for BN(2)/GRP receptors remained high (K(d)<0.9 nM). However, in vitro binding kinetics of the PEGylated analogues were slower. Steady-state condition was reached after 4 h, and the total cell binding was 10 times lower than that for the non-PEGylated counterpart. Besides, PEGylation improved the stability of BN conjugates in vitro and in vivo. The BN derivative conjugated with a PEG(5) molecule showed the best pharmacokinetics in vivo, i.e., faster blood clearance and preferential renal excretion. The tumor uptake of the (99m)Tc-PEG(5)-Lys-BN conjugate was slightly higher compared to that of the non-PEGylated analogue (3.91%±0.44% vs. 2.80%±0.28% injected dose per gram 1 h postinjection, p.i.). Tumor retention was also increased, resulting in a threefold higher amount of radioactivity in the tumor at 24 h p.i. Furthermore, decreased hepatobiliary excretion and increased tumor-to-nontarget ratios (tumor-to-blood: 17.1 vs. 2.1; tumor-to-kidney: 1.1 vs. 0.4; tumor-to-liver: 5.8 vs. 1.0, 24 h p.i.) were observed and further confirmed via small-animal SPECT images 1 h p.i.

Although Docetaxel (Taxotere®) represents the most active chemotherapeutic agent it only gives a modest survival advantage with most patients eventually progressing because of inherent or acquired drug resistance. The aims of this study were to further investigate the mechanisms of resistance to Docetaxel. Three Docetaxel resistant sub-lines were generated and confirmed to be resistant to the apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of increasing concentrations of Docetaxel.  Results:   The resistant DU-145 R and 22RV1 R had expression of P-glycoprotein and its inhibition with Elacridar partially and totally reversed the resistant phenotype in the two cell lines respectively, which was not seen in the PC-3 resistant sublines. Resistance was also not mediated in the PC-3 cells by cellular senescence or autophagy but multiple changes in pro- and anti-apoptotic genes and proteins were demonstrated. Even though there were lower basal levels of NF-κB activity in the PC-3 D12 cells compared to the Parental PC-3, docetaxel induced higher NF-κB activity and IκB phosphorylation at 3 and 6 hours with only minor changes in the DU-145 cells. Inhibition of NF-κB with the BAY 11-7082 inhibitor reversed the resistance to Docetaxel.

Methods:   We evaluated the association of 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HNF1B gene with prostate cancer risk and clinical characteristics (Gleason score and tumor stage) in Korean men (240 case subjects and 223 control subjects) using unconditional logistic regression analysis.

As clinical experience using TKIs in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) matures, Phase II trials show a heterogeneous response to sunitinib in CRPC patients. Change in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level has proven unreliable for prediction of CRPC response to TKIs. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a critical mediator of prostate cancer pathogenesis, has been shown to rise in patients with disease progression. As such, we investigated whether cellular IL-6 production can predict TKI response in both in vitro and in vivo models.  Methods:   IL-6 mRNA levels and protein expression were examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Apoptosis was examined using the terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay. For in vivo studies, a CRPC xenograft model in C.B17/Icr-scid mice was used.  Results:   PC-3 and DU-145 CRPC cell lines exhibited a heterogeneous response to sunitinib and pazopanib. Dose-dependent reduction of IL-6 was observed in TKI-sensitive DU-145 cells. In contrast, the TKI-resistant PC-3 cells failed to suppress IL-6 secretion. Instead, in the presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6 rose significantly upon administration of TKIs. Findings of in vitro experiments were confirmed in an in vivo mouse model of CRPC.  Conclusion:   Sensitivity of CRPC cells to TKIs is heterogeneous. These findings are consistent with results of recently published Phase II clinical trials using sunitinib in patients with CRPC. A substantial rise in IL-6 occurs both in vitro and in vivo in the presence of TKIs in resistant PC-3 cells but not in TKI-sensitive DU-145 cells. These findings suggest that IL-6 may represent a biomarker for TKI resistance in patients with CRPC.""","""['Alexander Kutikov', 'Peter Makhov', 'Konstantin Golovine', 'Daniel J Canter', 'Mohit Sirohi', 'Ryan Street', 'Jay Simhan', 'Robert G Uzzo', 'Vladimir M Kolenko']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibition produces discordant changes between 99mTc-MDP bone scans and other disease biomarkers: analysis of a phase II study of sunitinib for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Synergistic antitumor effect of NVP-BEZ235 and sunitinib on docetaxel-resistant human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Nuclear factor-kappa B and interleukin-6 related docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Expression Predicts Response to Sunitinib in Breast Cancer.', 'Interleukin-6 induces drug resistance in renal cell carcinoma.', 'PPP2R2A prostate cancer haploinsufficiency is associated with worse prognosis and a high vulnerability to B55α/PP2A reconstitution that triggers centrosome destabilization.', 'RNF25 promotes gefitinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells by inducing NF-κB-mediated ERK reactivation.', 'The convergent roles of NF-κB and ER stress in sunitinib-mediated expression of pro-tumorigenic cytokines and refractory phenotype in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Accumulation of Palmitoylcarnitine and Its Effect on Pro-Inflammatory Pathways and Calcium Influx in Prostate Cancer.', 'A novel anticancer agent icaritin inhibited proinflammatory cytokines in TRAMP mice.']"""

To improve therapeutic outcome radiotherapy (RT) may be combined with cytotoxic agents.  Methods:   In this study we have investigated the combination of RT with the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin (DXR) encapsulated in pegylated liposomes (PL-DXR). The PL-DXR formulation Caelyx was administered to male mice bearing human, androgen-sensitive CWR22 prostate carcinoma xenografts in a dose of 3.5 mg DXR/kg, in combination with RT (2 Gy/day × 5 days) performed under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic RT was achieved by experimentally inducing tumor hypoxia by clamping the tumor-bearing leg five minutes prior to and during RT. Treatment response evaluation consisted of tumor volume measurements and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI) with subsequent pharmacokinetic analysis using the Brix model. Imaging was performed pre-treatment (baseline) and 8 days later. Further, hypoxic fractions were determined by pimonidazole immunohistochemistry of excised tumor tissue.  Results:   As expected, the therapeutic effect of RT was significantly less effective under hypoxic than normoxic conditions. However, concomitant administration of PL-DXR significantly improved the therapeutic outcome following RT in hypoxic tumors. Further, the pharmacokinetic DCE MRI parameters and hypoxic fractions suggest PL-DXR to induce growth-inhibitory effects without interfering with tumor vascular functions.  Conclusions:   We found that DXR encapsulated in liposomes improved the therapeutic effect of RT under hypoxic conditions without affecting vascular functions. Thus, we propose that for cytotoxic agents affecting tumor vascular functions liposomes may be a promising drug delivery technology for use in chemoradiotherapy.""","""['Eirik Hagtvet', 'Kathrine Røe', 'Dag R Olsen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Vascular responses to radiotherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy in experimental prostate cancer.', 'Drug release rate influences the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, therapeutic activity, and toxicity of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin formulations in murine breast cancer.', 'Radiation improves the distribution and uptake of liposomal doxorubicin (caelyx) in human osteosarcoma xenografts.', ""Development of Fab' fragments of anti-GD(2) immunoliposomes entrapping doxorubicin for experimental therapy of human neuroblastoma."", 'The development of live microorganism-based oxygen shuttles for enhanced hypoxic tumor therapy.', 'Preclinical evaluation of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin as an effective radiosensitizer in chemoradiotherapy for lung cancer.', 'Nanovectorization of Prostate Cancer Treatment Strategies: A New Approach to Improved Outcomes.', 'Evolving role of biomaterials in diagnostic and therapeutic radiation oncology.', 'Combination treatment with naftopidil increases the efficacy of radiotherapy in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Gold nanoparticles enhance anti-tumor effect of radiotherapy to hypoxic tumor.']"""

Furthermore, F-32 was able to inhibit the binding of AR to the PSA enhancer region and to inhibit Akt-mediated AR phosphorylation at Ser 213.

Objective:   The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF) in patients with prostate cancer receiving ADT in UK primary care, and to evaluate the risks associated with individual ADT and combination ADT.  Methods:   The UK General Practice Research Database was used to identify a cohort of patients with a first prostate cancer diagnosis during 1999-2005. These patients were followed up to assess the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), death from CHD, incident HF and hospitalization due to acute decompensated HF. Nested case-control analyses were performed to assess the risk of these outcomes associated with anti-androgen therapy, as well as different types of ADT and combinations of ADT.  Results:   Current anti-androgen use was associated with a significant increase in the risk of hospitalization due to HF (odds ratio [OR] 2.15; 95% CI 1.08, 4.29), but not of incident HF, CHD or AMI. When assessed individually, there was no significant association of bicalutamide or cyproterone use with the risk of AMI or CHD. Current use of bicalutamide 50 mg/day was associated with a significant increase in the risk of HF (OR 3.28; 95% CI 1.31, 8.18); however, this increased risk of HF was only found in patients taking bicalutamide 50 mg/day in combination with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) receptor agonists. There were no cases of hospitalized HF in patients taking bicalutamide 50 mg/day as monotherapy and there was no significant association between current use of bicalutamide 150 mg/day and the risk of hospitalized HF. Combination therapy with LHRH agonists and anti-androgens was associated with a significant increase in the risk of CHD (OR 4.35; 95% CI 1.94, 9.75), AMI (OR 3.57; 95% CI 1.44, 8.86), incident HF (OR 3.19; 95% CI 1.10, 9.27) and hospitalized HF (OR 3.39; 95% CI 1.07, 10.70) compared with non-use of these drugs.

We characterized analytical performance, compared its accuracy with a commercially available test, and analyzed longitudinal serum samples from a pilot study of 33 RP patients.  Results:   The assay exhibited a functional sensitivity (20% interassay CV) <0.05 pg/mL, total imprecision <10% from 1 to 50 pg/mL, and excellent agreement with the comparator method.

We discovered GDC-0980, a selective, potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of Class I PI3 kinase and mTOR kinase (TORC1/2) with excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmaceutical properties. GDC-0980 potently inhibits signal transduction downstream of both PI3K and mTOR, as measured by pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers, thereby acting upon two key pathway nodes to produce the strongest attainable inhibition of signaling in the pathway. Correspondingly, GDC-0980 was potent across a broad panel of cancer cell lines, with the greatest potency in breast, prostate, and lung cancers and less activity in melanoma and pancreatic cancers, consistent with KRAS and BRAF acting as resistance markers. Treatment of cancer cell lines with GDC-0980 resulted in G1 cell-cycle arrest, and in contrast to mTOR inhibitors, GDC-0980 induced apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, including those with direct pathway activation via PI3K and PTEN. Low doses of GDC-0980 potently inhibited tumor growth in xenograft models including those with activated PI3K, loss of LKB1 or PTEN, and elicited an exposure-related decrease in PD biomarkers.

Tanshinone IIA significantly inhibited the growth and proliferation of LNCaP cells by colony formation and BrdU incorporation assays, respectively. Tanshinone IIA induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and down-regulated cyclin D1, CDK2 and CDK4. Furthermore, tanshinone IIA activated the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 15 residue and its downstream p21 and p27. Additionally, tanshinone IIA suppressed the expression of AR and prostate specific antigen (PSA). Conversely, silencing p53 using its specific siRNA reversed cyclin D1 expression inhibited by tanshinone IIA. However, knockdown of AR had no effect on the p53/p21/p27 signaling pathway activated by tanshinone IIA in LNCaP cells. In AR siRNA-transfected cells, tanshinone IIA did not cause cell cycle arrest and reduce cyclin D1, implying that AR is essential to induce G1 arrest by tanshinone IIA in LNCaP cells.

Here, we report that Hic-5 binds to Smads 1, 5 and 8, and represses bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling responses. Myc-Hic-5 but not Myc-paxillin was specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG IgG1 from lysates of HEK293 co-transfected with either Myc-Hic-5 or Myc-paxillin and FLAG-tagged Smads 1, 5 or 8.

Anti-Hic-5 antibody specifically pulled down endogenous Smad1 in both the PC3 human prostate cell line and primary cultures of rat prostate fibroblasts, supporting that Hic-5 binds to Smad1 at the endogenous level. Bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Smads 1, 5 or 8, but not GST alone, pulled down in vitro transcribed and translated Hic-5, implicating that Hic-5 binds directly to Smads 1, 5 and 8. Significantly, using Hic-5 small hairpin RNA silencing and overexpression systems, we show that Hic-5 (at both the endogenous and exogenous levels) represses the ability of BMP4 to induce expression of the inhibitor of differentiation-1 (Id1; a downstream target gene of BMP), activate the Id1 gene promoter and induce apoptosis in human and rat prostate epithelial cells. Moreover, silencing of Hic-5 in PC3 cells as well as in the WPMY-1 human prostate stroma cell line greatly enhances the levels of endogenous phospho-Smad1/5/8. Finally, we provide fluorescent microscopic imaging to support that Smad1 and Hic-5 mutually interact also at the level of their nuclear export mechanisms.

The identified genetic alteration is within intron 9, but the mechanisms by which LMTK2 may impact upon prostate cancer are not clear because the functions of LMTK2 are poorly understood. Here, we show that LMTK2 regulates a known pathway that controls phosphorylation of kinesin-1 light chain-2 (KLC2) by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). KLC2 phosphorylation by GSK3β induces the release of cargo from KLC2. LMTK2 signals via protein phosphatase-1C (PP1C) to increase inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β on serine-9 that reduces KLC2 phosphorylation and promotes binding of the known KLC2 cargo Smad2. Smad2 signals to the nucleus in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) receptor stimulation and transport of Smad2 by kinesin-1 is required for this signalling. We show that small interfering RNA loss of LMTK2 not only reduces binding of Smad2 to KLC2, but also inhibits TGFβ-induced Smad2 signalling.

Acini formed by PC-3 and PC-3M, less pronounced also in other PrCa cell lines, spontaneously undergo an invasive switch, leading to the disintegration of epithelial structures and the basal lamina, and formation of invadopodia. This demonstrates the highly dynamic nature of epithelial plasticity, balancing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition against metastable acinar differentiation. This study assessed the role of lipid metabolites on epithelial maturation. PC-3 cells completely failed to form acinar structures in delipidated serum. Adding back lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) rescued acinar morphogenesis and repressed invasion effectively. Blocking LPA receptor 1 (LPAR1) functions by siRNA (small interference RNA) or the specific LPAR1 inhibitor Ki16425 promoted invasion, while silencing of other G-protein-coupled receptors responsive to LPA or S1P mainly caused growth arrest or had no effects. The G-proteins Gα(12/13) and Gα(i) were identified as key mediators of LPA signalling via stimulation of RhoA and Rho kinases ROCK1 and 2, activating Rac1, while inhibition of adenylate cyclase and accumulation of cAMP may be secondary. Interfering with these pathways specifically impeded epithelial polarization in transformed cells. In contrast, blocking the same pathways in non-transformed, normal cells promoted differentiation. We conclude that LPA and LPAR1 effectively promote epithelial maturation and block invasion of PrCa cells in 3-D culture. The analysis of clinical transcriptome data confirmed reduced expression of LPAR1 in a subset of PrCa's.

Results:   The correlation coefficients between the IPSS-QOL score and the seven questions on the VAS were higher than those between the IPSS-QOL and the seven questions on the IPSS. Multivariate analysis showed that the strongest factor for determining IPSS-QOL at each time point was nocturia on the VAS.

After we recently found an almost two-fold increased risk of hematologic malignancies associated with high use of acetaminophen in the prospective VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) study, we herein further examined the association between acetaminophen use and cancer risk in the VITAL cohort.  Methods:   A total of 62,841 men and women aged 50 to 76 years were recruited from 2000 to 2002, and incident malignancies other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 5,750) were identified through December 2008 via linkage to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry. HRs associated with acetaminophen use for incidence of total cancers and nonhematologic cancer subcategories were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models that were adjusted for age, demographics, cancer risk factors, and medical conditions that may be indications for acetaminophen use.  Results:   Use of acetaminophen was not associated with total cancer risk. We also observed no associations for most major nonhematologic cancer sites, including cancers of the gastrointestinal system, lung, urinary tract, skin, prostate, or female organs.  Conclusion:   This study failed to provide evidence of an association between acetaminophen use and total cancer risk or incidence of nonhematologic malignancies.

Bone pain may predict patients' prognosis and there is a need to further explore CRPC patients' experiences of bone pain in the overall context of disease pathology. Due to the subjective nature of pain, assessments of pain severity, onset and progression are reliant on patient assessment. Patient reported outcome (PRO) measures, therefore, are commonly used as key endpoints for evaluating the efficacy of CRPC treatments. Evidence of the content validity of leading PRO measures of pain severity used in CRPC clinical trials is, however, limited.  Methods:   To document patients' experience of CRPC symptoms including pain, and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL), semi-structured in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 17 patients with CRPC and bone metastases. The content validity of the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) scale from the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), and the 'Average Pain' and 'Worst Pain' items of the Brief Pain Inventory Short-Form (BPI-SF) was also assessed.  Results:   Patients with CRPC and bone metastases present with a constellation of symptoms that can have a profound effect on HRQL. For patients in this study, bone pain was the most prominent and debilitating symptom associated with their condition. Bone pain was chronic and, despite being generally well-managed by analgesic medication, instances of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) were common. Cognitive debriefing of the selected PRO measures of pain severity highlighted difficulties among patients in understanding the verbal response scale (VRS) of the MPQ PPI scale. There were also some inconsistencies in the way in which the BPI-SF 'Average Pain' item was interpreted by patients. In contrast, the BPI-SF 'Worst Pain' item was well understood and interpreted consistently among patients.  Conclusions:   Study findings support the importance of PRO measures of pain severity as key endpoints for evaluating the efficacy of treatments for CRPC, particularly for patients with bone metastases where episodes of BTcP are common.

Level of Evidence 4. What's known on the subject? And what does the study add? In lymph node dissections for cancer, the more extended the dissection, the higher the number of lymph nodes removed. In addition, the higher the number of nodes retrieved, the better the staging. This leads many investigators to set a threshold of a minimal number of nodes below which the dissection is considered inadequate. Although the minimal threshold concept is generally good, it is not based on very objective data. a number of factors might influence the final number of nodes removed: (i) the surgeon and the surgical technique; (ii) the pathologists and tissue processing technique; (iii) the patient; and (iv) the audit effect and feedback to the surgeons about the number of nodes removed.  Objective:   • To examine the number of lymph nodes removed over time for men undergoing a standard pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) during radical prostatectomy.  Patients and methods:   • In total, 2119 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were scheduled for non-salvage radical prostatectomy between February 2005 and September 2009. • All patients underwent PLND, including the external iliac, hypogastric and obturator fossa nodal groups. • We tested whether the number of lymph nodes increased over time by including the date of each patient's surgery into a linear regression model using nonlinear terms.  Results:   • From 2008 onward, there appears to be a large increase in the number of nodes removed. • Date of surgery was a significant predictor of the number of nodes removed (P < 0.001). • The anatomical template of dissection, the specimen submission and pathological assessment were reportedly unchanged. • The nodal yield increase in the later part of the study coincides with an increase in the academic interest in PLND and nodal metastasis in prostate cancer at the institutional level and worldwide.  Conclusions:   • Without any intentional change in surgical technique or pathological processing, the number of lymph nodes removed in our radical prostatectomy experience increased. • This change coincided with an increased academic interest in the subject and highlights the positive feedback effect. • The change also raises concerns about unaccounted for confounding factors that could affect multi-institutional datasets and surgical clinical trials.""","""['Clarisse Mazzola', 'Caroline Savage', 'Youness Ahallal', 'Victor E Reuter', 'James A Eastham', 'Peter T Scardino', 'Bertrand Guillonneau', 'Karim A Touijer']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Impact of surgical volume on the rate of lymph node metastases in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Laparoscopic extended pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer: description of the surgical technique and initial results.', 'The impact of robotic surgery on pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer: the Brown University early robotic experience.', 'Current status of pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer: the New York PLND nomogram.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection for cervical or bladder cancer: embedding residual fat tissue offers no added value.', 'External Validation of the Briganti Nomogram to Predict Lymph Node Invasion in Prostate Cancer-Setting a New Threshold Value.', 'Current status of pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Histological step sectioning of pelvic lymph nodes increases the number of identified lymph node metastases.']"""

RESULTS • Overall, 11/31 (35.5%) men developed BCR. • Mean AccuPSA(TM) nadir levels were significantly different (P < 0.001) between the non-BCR group (2.27 pg/mL) and the BCR group (46.99 pg/mL). • Using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, AccuPSA(TM) nadir level was a significant predictor of BCR-free survival (P < 0.01). • Kaplan-Meier analysis of up to 5 years follow-up showed that 100% of men with AccuPSA(TM) nadir values <3 pg/mL did not develop BCR, whereas 62.5% of men with values >3 pg/mL developed BCR (P= 0.00024). • The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the AccuPSA(TM) method was 100%, 75%, 69% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS • AccuPSA(TM) assay predicts 5-year BCR- free survival after RP. • Identifying a reliable predictor of BCR soon after RP has important implications for frequency of PSA testing, selection of candidates for adjuvant therapy, and reassuring a large subset of men that they are not at risk of recurrence. • Larger studies are needed to validate these findings.""","""['Herbert Lepor', 'Carol D Cheli', 'Robert P Thiel', 'Samir S Taneja', 'Juliana Laze', 'Dan W Chan', 'Lori J Sokoll', 'Leslie Mangold', 'Alan W Partin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Three-year postoperative ultrasensitive prostate-specific antigen following open radical retropubic prostatectomy is a predictor for delayed biochemical recurrence.', 'Prostate-specific antigen measured 3 months after radical prostatectomy as a new predictor of biochemical recurrence.', 'Timing of Prostate-specific Antigen Nadir After Radical Prostatectomy and Risk of Biochemical Recurrence.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Markers and meaning of primary treatment failure.', 'The kinetic profile and clinical implication of SCC-Ag in squamous cervical cancer patients undergoing radical hysterectomy using the Simoa assay: a prospective observational study.', 'Claros System: A Rapid Microfluidics-Based Point-of-Care System for Quantitative Prostate Specific Antigen Analysis from Finger-Stick Blood.', 'Ultrasensitive prostate-specific antigen level as a predictor of biochemical progression after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Towards risk adapted follow-up.', 'Advancing the speed, sensitivity and accuracy of biomolecular detection using multi-length-scale engineering.', 'Toward rapid, high-sensitivity, volume-constrained biomarker quantification and validation using backscattering interferometry.']"""

Patients and methods:   • Between December 2003 and September 2010, 1480 men underwent RALP of whom 160 fulfilled the National Comprehensive Control Network criteria for high-risk disease (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 20 ng/mL and/or clinical stage, cT ≥ 3 and/or biopsy Gleason score ≥ 8). • Biochemical recurrence (postoperative PSA ≥ 0.2) was used to assess outcome after RALP monotherapy. • Treatment failure was defined as either a rising PSA level after salvage RT or the initiation of ADT.  Results:   • The mean age ± standard deviation was 63.1 ± 6.3 years. Median PSA level was 9.95 ng/mL (interquartile range 6.0-21.4). • Analysis of prostatectomy specimen showed Gleason 8-10 cancers in 65 (41%), and extracapsular disease, pT ≥ 3, in 96 (60%) of which seminal vesicle invasion was evident in 36 (23%). Downgrading by prostatectomy occurred in 64 (40% of total group) and five (3%) were downstaged to pT2 disease. By contrast, any upgrading occurred in 29 (18% of total group) and upstaging occurred in 68 (43%). The overall positive surgical margin rate was 38%, correlating with stage pT2 (15%) or pT3 (53%). • With median follow-up of 26.2 months (interquartile range 5.5-37.3), two non-cancer-related deaths have occurred (overall survival 98.8%; cancer-specific survival 100%), and biochemical recurrence has occurred in 53 men (33%). RALP surgery has served as monotherapy (n= 117, 73%), or has been followed by salvage RT (n= 24, 15%) and/or ADT (n= 43, 27%). Overall 2-year and 3-year treatment failure was 31 and 41%, respectively. • Serum PSA level was the only independent predictor of overall treatment failure (hazard ratio [HR] 1.02, P= 0.001) although a strong trend was observed for both clinical stage (HR 1.22, P= 0.058) and the number of positive biopsy cores on transrectal biopsy (HR 1.06, P= 0.057).  Conclusions:   • RALP incorporating the use of postoperative RT is a good multimodal management strategy for men with this aggressive variant of prostate cancer. • At median follow-up in excess of 2 years, we found low rates of treatment failure enabling a high proportion of men to remain free of ADT.""","""['Stephen S Connolly', 'Paul J Cathcart', 'Paul Gilmore', 'Michael Kerger', 'Helen Crowe', 'Justin S Peters', 'Declan G Murphy', 'Anthony J Costello']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Robotic radical prostatectomy as the initial step in multimodal therapy for men with high-risk localised prostate cancer: initial experience of 160 men.', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Cryotherapy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and oncological outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with nerve sparing vs. non-nerve sparing for high-risk prostate cancer cases.', 'Pathological outcomes and biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer in the Indian population.', 'Positive surgical margin is associated with biochemical recurrence risk following radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis from high-quality retrospective cohort studies.', 'Biochemical Recurrence Prediction in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients, Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Safety of selective nerve sparing in high risk prostate cancer during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

A dedicated team, using robot-assisted surgery, with a skillful assistant are required for the procedure to become standard practice. We would recommend the retro-apical approach for all patients receiving RARP, as it was not found to increase surgical risk or complication. The continence rate at 3 months and 6 months were similar between two groups (70% and 95% in retro-apical group vs 60% and 90% in anterior-apical group).  Objective:   To assess the feasibility of retro-apical transection of the urethra during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in an Asian population.  Patients and methods:   Eighty consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent RARP performed by a single surgeon. Patients who underwent retro-apical or anterior-apical urethral transection during RARP were allocated to Group 1 or Group 2, respectively. Preoperative clinical characteristics were recorded, pelvic bone measurements taken and prostatic apex shape was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. Operating characteristics were compared between the groups and pathological outcomes were assessed.  Results:   Of the 80 patients, 75% were in Group 1 and 25% in Group 2. Pelvic bone size and apex shape were similar between the two groups. Group 2 had a significantly higher mean (sd) preoperative body mass index (BMI) than Group 1 (27.43 [4.15] vs 23.50 [2.71] kg/m(2); P < 0.001) and significantly higher prostate weight than Group 1 (52.00 [31.89] vs 36.55 [11.57] g; P < 0.05). More of those in Group 2 than in Group 1 had undergone previous transurethral resection of the prostate ([TURP] 25% vs 1.67%; P = 0.003) and the mean tumour volume in Group 2 was significantly higher than in Group 1 (15.17 vs 8.10 mL; P = 0.049). The incidence of retro-apical transection of the urethra was 62.5% and 82.5% in the initial 40 cases and subsequent 40 cases, respectively (P = 0.02).

Level of Evidence 2b. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The cancer-specific outcomes of salvage cryotherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer have been well established within contemporary scientific literature. However, very little is known about the outcomes of salvage cryotherapy encompassing health-related quality of life considerations such as continence after treatment. We think the present study is quite novel, as it proposes a new therapeutic endpoint to evaluate the efficacy and outcomes of salvage therapies for locally recurrent prostate cancer, which we have termed the 'bifecta'. In addition, we report that in a large multicentre data registry, such as the COLD Registry, the therapeutic 'bifecta' can be achieved in most patients.  Objectives:   • To evaluate the contemporary outcomes of salvage cryotherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer using the Cryo On-Line Data (COLD) Registry. • We also evaluate the outcomes of salvage cryotherapy in achieving the therapeutic 'bifecta' consisting of: (i) achieving a post-cryotherapy nadir serum PSA level of <0.6 ng/mL and (ii) no urinary incontinence.  Patients and methods:   • A prospectively, centrally collected secure online database has been developed of patients undergoing salvage cryoablation for locally recurrent prostate cancer. Of the patients undergoing salvage cryotherapy (in the absence of neoadjuvant hormonal ablative therapy) included within the COLD Registry, complete medical records pertaining to continence status and serial PSA measurements after treatment were available in 183 patients.  Results:   • The therapeutic 'bifecta' was achieved in 133 of these patients (72.7%). • Of the patients achieving the 'bifecta', the mean (sd) age at presentation was 71.5 (6.6) years. • Most patients (91%) had a baseline pre-salvage total serum PSA level of <10 ng/mL and a pre-treatment biopsy Gleason score of <8 (85%). • The mean duration of follow-up of patients achieving the 'bifecta' was 36.5 months.  Conclusions:   • The therapeutic 'bifecta', a new surrogate benchmark for salvage therapies, can be achieved in most patients undergoing salvage cryotherapy. • Therefore, salvage cryotherapy is a reasonable treatment choice for locally recurrent prostate cancer in appropriately selected patients.""","""['Philippe E Spiess', 'Robert W Given', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Disease-free survival following salvage cryotherapy for biopsy-proven radio-recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Locally recurrent prostate cancer after initial radiation therapy: a comparison of salvage radical prostatectomy versus cryotherapy.', 'Salvage prostate cryoablation: initial results from the cryo on-line data registry.', 'Local tumor control with salvage cryotherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after external beam radiotherapy.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound and cryotherapy as salvage treatment in local radio-recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Management of recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy: long-term results from CALGB 9687 (Alliance), a prospective multi-institutional salvage prostatectomy series.', 'Salvage Therapy Options for Local Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Primary Radiotherapy: a Literature Review.', 'Assessment of Cryosurgical Device Performance Using a 3D Tissue-Engineered Cancer Model.', 'Focal Cryotherapy in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: Are We Treating the Cancer or the Mind? - The Cancer.', ""Re-purposing cryoablation: a combinatorial 'therapy' for the destruction of tissue.""]"""

Methods:   Three dimensional external and organ outlines were generated from a computed tomography image set of a male pelvis, forming the basis of design for an anatomically realistic phantom. Clinically relevant points of interest were selected throughout the dataset where point-dose values could be measured with thermoluminescence dosimeters and a small-volume ionization chamber. Following testing, three materials were selected and the phantom was manufactured using modern prototyping techniques into five separate coronal slices. Time lines and resource requirements for the phantom design and manufacture were recorded. The ability of the phantom to mimic the entire treatment chain was tested.  Results:   The phantom CT images indicated that organ densities and geometries were comparable to those of the original patient. The phantom proved simple to load for dosimetry and rapid to assemble. Due to heat release during manufacture, small air gaps and density heterogeneities were present throughout the phantom. The overall cost for production of the prototype phantom was comparable to other commercial anthropomorphic phantoms. The phantom was shown to be suitable for use as a ""patient"" to mimic the entire treatment chain for typical external beam radiotherapy for prostate and rectal cancer.  Conclusions:   The phantom constructed for the present study incorporates all characteristics necessary for accurate Level III intercomparison studies.

The authors propose a computational motion compensation method for tomosynthesis-based reconstruction that enables 3D localization of prostate implants from C-arm images despite C-arm oscillation and sagging.  Methods:   Five C-arm images are captured by rotating the C-arm around its primary axis, while measuring its rotation angle using a protractor or the C-arm joint encoder. The C-arm images are processed to obtain binary seed-only images from which a volume of interest is reconstructed. The motion compensation algorithm, iteratively, compensates for 2D translational motion of the C-arm by maximizing the number of voxels that project on a seed projection in all of the images. This obviates the need for C-arm full pose tracking traditionally implemented using radio-opaque fiducials or external trackers. The proposed reconstruction method is tested in simulations, in a phantom study and on ten patient data sets.  Results:   In a phantom implanted with 136 dummy seeds, the seed detection rate was 100% with a localization error of 0.86 ± 0.44 mm (Mean ± STD) compared to CT. For patient data sets, a detection rate of 99.5% was achieved in approximately 1 min per patient. The reconstruction results for patient data sets were compared against an available matching-based reconstruction method and showed relative localization difference of 0.5 ± 0.4 mm.  Conclusions:   The motion compensation method can successfully compensate for large C-arm motion without using radio-opaque fiducial or external trackers. Considering the efficacy of the algorithm, its successful reconstruction rate and low computational burden, the algorithm is feasible for clinical use.""","""['Ehsan Dehghan', 'Mehdi Moradi', 'Xu Wen', 'Danny French', 'Julio Lobo', 'W James Morris', 'Septimiu E Salcudean', 'Gabor Fichtinger']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Brachytherapy seed reconstruction with joint-encoded C-arm single-axis rotation and motion compensation.', 'An image-guidance system for dynamic dose calculation in prostate brachytherapy using ultrasound and fluoroscopy.', 'Prostate brachytherapy seed reconstruction using C-arm rotation measurement and motion compensation.', 'Intra-operative prostate brachytherapy dosimetry based on partial seed localization in ultrasound and registration to C-arm fluoroscopy.', 'Seed localization in ultrasound and registration to C-arm fluoroscopy using matched needle tracks for prostate brachytherapy.', 'A low-cost tracked C-arm (TC-arm) upgrade system for versatile quantitative intraoperative imaging.', 'C-arm angle measurement with accelerometer for brachytherapy: an accuracy study.', 'Ultrasound-fluoroscopy registration for prostate brachytherapy dosimetry.']"""

Prostate cancer is the sixth leading cause of death from cancer in men (6.1% of the total).The incidence of prostate cancer in Nigerian men is believed to be on the increase and it had become the number one cancer in 1999, constituting 11% of all male cancers in the population served by the Ibadan cancer Registry. Studies from Ibadan and from other sites in Nigeria (Benin, Calabar, Kano, Lagos, Maiduguri, and Zaria) have shown an increasing incidence of prostate cancer accounting for anything between 6 and 12 % of total cancers in these centres and up to about 18% of prostatic neoplasms in some. Most patients present in late stage disease, and the mortality is high.It is uncertain whether there is a biophysical component to the increased incidence of prostate cancer in Nigerian and other West African men although a few studies point in this direction.It appears there is inadequate information regarding the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer, and that health care professionals do not routinely provide information regarding the importance of screening for prostate cancer before age 50 for high-risk populations.The Revised National health Policy for Nigeria (Sept 2004) has as its long term goal 'to provide the entire population with adequate access, not only to primary health care but also to secondary and tertiary services through a well functioning referral system' and also ""Ensuring equitable distribution of human resources for healthcare delivery between urban and rural areas, including difficult terrain, such as mountainous, riverine and inaccessible areas of the country.""At the moment however, Public expenditure on health is less than $8 per capita, compared to the $34 recommended internationally. Private expenditures are estimated to be over 70% of total health expenditure, most of this from out-of-pocket. Yet there is endemic poverty. The National Health Insurance scheme (NHIS) is presently severely limited in its allowances and certainly so for cancer care.  Conclusions:   The following recommendations are therefore made:* Establishment of community outreaches for education and screening.* Improved completeness of records to understand the real burden of disease and funding studies to explore biophysical components that may be important in racial differences for this disease.* Increased access by increasing numbers of specialists required for clinical assessment and management.* Increase laboratory diagnostic support* Improved availability of drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer cases.""","""['Olufemi J Ogunbiyi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Infect Agent Cancer""","""['Tuberculosis.', 'Healthcare utilisation, cancer screening and potential barriers to accessing cancer care in rural South West Nigeria: a cross-sectional study.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Colon Cancer Screening - Is It Time Yet?', 'Assessing equity in health care through the national health insurance schemes of Nigeria and Ghana: a review-based comparative analysis.', 'Safety profile of colocasia esculenta tuber extracts in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Prostate Cancer and Challenges in Management in a Semi-urban Centre: A 10-year Experience.', 'Prostate cancer characteristics: A descriptive analysis of clinical features at presentation in the last decade in a black African community.', 'Comparison of health access, lifestyle, prostate cancer knowledge and screening among black men residing in West Africa and the USA.', 'Prostate adenocarcinoma associated with prostatic infection due to Schistosoma haematobium.

Treatment of PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells with apigenin (20-40 µM) resulted in the inhibition of HDAC enzyme activity, specifically HDAC1 and HDAC3 at the protein and message level. Apigenin-mediated HDAC inhibition resulted in global histone H3 and H4 acetylation, as well as localized hyperacetylation of histone H3 on the p21/waf1 promoter. A corresponding increase was observed in p21/waf1 and bax protein and mRNA expression after apigenin exposure, consistent with the use of HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A. The downstream events demonstrated cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in both cancer cells. Studies of PC-3 xenografts in athymic nude mice further demonstrated that oral intake of apigenin at doses of 20 and 50 µg/mouse/d over an 8-wk period resulted in a marked reduction in tumor growth, HDAC activity, and HDAC1 and HDAC3 protein expression at both doses of apigenin. An increase in p21/waf1 expression was observed in apigenin-fed mice, compared to the control group. Furthermore, apigenin intake caused a significant decrease in bcl2 expression with concomitant increase in bax, shifting the bax/bcl2 ratio in favor of apoptosis. Our findings confirm for the first time that apigenin inhibits class I HDACs, particularly HDAC1 and HDAC3 and its exposure results in reversal of aberrant epigenetic events that promote malignancy. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.""","""['Mitali Pandey', 'Parminder Kaur', 'Sanjeev Shukla', 'Ata Abbas', 'Pingfu Fu', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Inhibition of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth by apigenin through induction of G2/M arrest and histone H3 acetylation-mediated p21WAF1/CIP1 expression.', 'Green tea polyphenols causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by suppressing class I histone deacetylases.', 'Apigenin induces apoptosis by targeting inhibitor of apoptosis proteins and Ku70-Bax interaction in prostate cancer.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors: signalling towards p21cip1/waf1.', 'Epigenetic mechanisms and alcohol use disorders: a potential therapeutic target.', 'Metabolo-epigenetic interplay provides targeted nutritional interventions in chronic diseases and ageing.', 'Phenolic compounds as histone deacetylase inhibitors: binding propensity and interaction insights from molecular docking and dynamics simulations.', 'Mediterranean Food Industry By-Products as a Novel Source of Phytochemicals with a Promising Role in Cancer Prevention.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Use of Saponinosomes from Ziziphus spina-christi as Anticancer Drug Carriers.']"""

There are several TCP models in the literature, from the simplest (Poissonian TCP) to the well-advanced stochastic birth-death processes. Simple and complex models often make the same predictions. Hence, here, we present a systematic study where we compare six of these TCP models: the Poisson TCP, the Zaider-Minerbo TCP, a Monte Carlo TCP and their corresponding cell cycle (two-compartment) models. Several clinical non-uniform treatment protocols for prostate cancer are employed to evaluate these models. These include fractionated external beam radiotherapies, and high and low dose rate brachytherapies. We find that in realistic treatment scenarios, all one-compartment models and all two-compartment models give basically the same results. A difference occurs between one-compartment and two-compartment models due to reduced radiosensitivity of quiescent cells.We find that care must be taken for the right choice of parameters, such as the radiosensitivities α and β and the hazard function h. Typically, different hazard functions are used for fractionated treatment (fractionated survival fraction) and for brachytherapies (Lea-Catcheside protraction factor). We were able to combine these two approaches into one 'effective' hazard function. Based on our results, we can recommend the use of the Poissonian TCP for everyday treatment planning.

Recently, we showed that the expression of some glycosphingolipids (GSLs) is down-regulated during EMT in human and mouse cell lines. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of GalNAc-type (or mucin-type) O-glycosylation in EMT process, induced with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in human prostate epithelial cell lines. We found that: (i) TGF-β treatment caused up-regulation of oncofetal fibronectin (onfFN), which is defined by mAb FDC6, and expressed in cancer or fetal cells/tissues, but not in normal adult cells/tissues. The reactivity of mAb FDC6 requires the addition of an O-glycan at a specific threonine, inside the type III homology connective segment (IIICS) domain of FN. (ii) This change is associated with typical EMT characteristics; i.e., change from epithelial to fibroblastic morphology, enhanced cell motility, decreased expression of a typical epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, and enhanced expression of mesenchymal markers. (iii) TGF-β treatment up-regulated mRNA level of FN containing the IIICS domain and GalNAc-T activity for the IIICS domain peptide substrate containing the FDC6 onfFN epitope. (iv) Knockdown of GalNAc-T6 and T3 inhibited TGF-β-induced up-regulation of onfFN and EMT process. (v) Involvement of GSLs was not detectable with the EMT process in these cell lines.

Methods:   Subjects undergoing first prostate biopsy enrolled in a multicenter, prospective cohort of the National Cancer Institute Early Detection Research Network (N = 635) were analyzed to develop a model for predicting histologically aggressive prostate cancers. The control arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (N = 3833) was used to validate the generalization of the predictive model.  Results:   The Early Detection Research Network cohort was comprised of men among whom 57% had no cancer, 14% had indolent cancer, and 29% had aggressive cancer. Age, body mass index, family history of prostate cancer, abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE), and PSA density (PSAD) were associated with aggressive cancer (all P < .001). The Early Detection Research Network model outperformed PSA alone in predicting aggressive cancer (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.81 vs 0.71, P < .01). Model validation in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial cohort accurately identified men at low (<10%) risk of aggressive cancer for whom biopsy could be averted (AUC = 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.80). Under criteria from the Early Detection Research Network model, prostate biopsy can be restricted to men with PSAD >0.1 ng/mL/cc or abnormal DRE. When PSAD is <0.1 ng/mL/cc, family history or obesity can identify biopsy candidates.  Conclusions:   A predictive model incorporating age, family history, obesity, PSAD, and DRE elucidates criteria whereby ¼ of prostate biopsies can be averted while retaining high sensitivity in detecting aggressive prostate cancer.""","""['Stephen B Williams', 'Simpa Salami', 'Meredith M Regan', 'Donna P Ankerst', 'John T Wei', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Martin G Sanda']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Selective detection of aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Prediction of prostate cancer risk: the role of prostate volume and digital rectal examination in the ERSPC risk calculators.', 'The use of prostate specific antigen density to improve the sensitivity of prostate specific antigen in detecting prostate carcinoma.', 'Cost-effective prostate cancer detection.

Methods:   Men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, whose PSA was <0.5 ng ml(-1) after 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy were randomized to pazopanib 800 mg daily or observation. The planned primary outcome was time to PSA progression >4.0 ng ml(-1).  Results:   Thirty-seven patients were randomized. Of 18 patients randomized to pazopanib, at the time of study closure, 4 had progressive disease, 1 remained on treatment and 13 (72%) electively disenrolled, the most common reason being patient request due to grade 1/2 toxicity (8 patients). Two additional patients were removed from treatment due to adverse events. Of 19 patients randomized to observation, at the time of study closure, 4 had progressive disease, 7 remained under protocol-defined observation and 8 (42%) had disenrolled, most commonly due to non-compliance with protocol visits (3 patients). Because of high dropout rates in both arms, the study was halted.  Conclusions:   IAS is a treatment approach that may facilitate investigation of novel agents in the hormone-sensitive state. This trial attempted to investigate the role of antiangiogenic therapy in this setting, but encountered several barriers, including toxicities and patient non-compliance, which can make implementation of such a study difficult.

Methods:   Records from 464,918 patients who were diagnosed with PC from 1998 to 2007 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The patients were categorized according to age into groups ages <50 years, 50 to 54 years, 55 to 59 years, 60 to 64 years, 65 to 69 years, 70 to 74 years, 75 to 79 years, 80 to 84 years, 85 to 89 years, and ≥ 90 years.

However it is unclear whether all CSC-like cells are within the ALDH(Hi) population, or whether all ALDH(Hi) cells are highly proliferative and tumourigenic. The ability to establish a stem cell hierarchy in vitro, whereby sub-populations of cells have differing proliferative and differentiation capacities, is an alternate indication of the presence of stem cell-like populations within cell lines. In this study, we have examined the interaction between ALDH status and the ability to establish a stem cell hierarchy in PC3 prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate that PC3 cells contain a stem cell hierarchy, and isolation of ALDH(Hi) cells enriches for the most primitive holoclone population, however holoclone formation is not restricted to ALDH(Hi) cells. In addition, we show that ALDH activity undergoes phenotypic plasticity, since the ALDH(Lo) population can develop ALDH(Hi) populations comparable to parental cells within 2 weeks in culture.

Sulforaphane (SFN) is a sulfur-containing compound that exhibits anticancer properties, and young sprouts of broccoli are particularly rich in SFN. There is consistent epidemiological evidence that the consumption of sulfur-containing vegetables, such as garlic and cruciferous vegetables, may help reduce the occurrence of prostate cancer. Here we found that a large amount of H(2)S is released when SFN is added into cell culture medium or mixed with mouse liver homogenates, respectively. Both SFN and NaHS (a H(2)S donor) decreased the viability of PC-3 cells (a human prostate cancer cell line) in a dose-dependent manner, and supplement of methemoglobin or oxidized glutathione (two H(2)S scavengers) reversed SFN-reduced cell viability. We further found both cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine beta-synthase are expressed in PC-3 cells and mouse prostate tissues. H(2)S production in prostate tissues from CSE knockout mice was only 20% of that from wild-type mice, suggesting CSE is a major H(2)S-producing enzyme in prostate. CSE overexpression enhanced H(2)S production and inhibited cell viability in PC-3 cells. In addition, both SFN and NaHS activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Pre-treatment of PC-3 cells with methemoglobin decreased SFN-stimulated MAPK activities. Suppression of both p38 MAPK and JNK reversed H(2)S- or SFN-reduced viability of PC-3 cells. Our results demonstrated that H(2)S mediates the inhibitory effect of SFN on the proliferation of PC-3 cells, which suggests that H(2)S-releasing diet or drug might be beneficial in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Yanxi Pei', 'Bo Wu', 'Qiuhui Cao', 'Lingyun Wu', 'Guangdong Yang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Butyrate-stimulated H2S production in colon cancer cells.', 'Involvement of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in G2/M arrest and caspase-mediated apoptosis induced by sulforaphane in DU145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Dysregulation of cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE)/hydrogen sulfide pathway contributes to ox-LDL-induced inflammation in macrophage.', 'Modulation of histone deacetylase activity by dietary isothiocyanates and allyl sulfides: studies with sulforaphane and garlic organosulfur compounds.', 'Multi-targeted prevention of cancer by sulforaphane.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha is a driving mechanism linking chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to lung cancer.', 'Cystathionine γ-lyase mediates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Hydrogen Sulfide Biology and Its Role in Cancer.', 'Gasotransmitters in the tumor microenvironment: Impacts on cancer chemotherapy (Review).', 'Stabilities of Three Key Biological Trisulfides with Implications for Their Roles in the Release of Hydrogen Sulfide and Bioaccumulation of Sulfane Sulfur.']"""

We compared the accuracy of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI combined with three-dimensional (3D) MRSI in locating prostate tumours and determined the influence of prostate weight on MRI accuracy.  Patients and methods:   Between March 1999 and October 2006, 507 patients with localised prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at the Jules Bordet Institute. Of these, 220 had undergone endorectal MRI (1.5 T Siemens Quantum Symphony) and 3D-MRSI prior to RP. We retrospectively reviewed data on tumour location and compared the results obtained by MRI and by TRUS-guided biopsy with those obtained on histopathology of the RP specimen.  Results:   Patient data were as follows: median age 62.4 years (45-74); median PSA 6.36 ng/ml (0.5-22.6); 73.6% of patients had non-palpable disease (T1c); median biopsy Gleason score 6 (3-9); median RP specimen weight 50 g (12-172); median pathological Gleason score 7 (4-10); 68.64% of patients had organ-confined (pT2) disease. Tumour localisation was correlated with RP data in a significantly higher percentage of patients when using MRI rather than TRUS-guided biopsy (47.4 vs. 36.6%, p < 0.0001). MRI was marginally superior to TRUS-guided biopsy in detecting malignancy at the prostate apex (48.3 vs. 41.9%, p = 0.0687) and somewhat better at the prostate base (46 vs. 39.1%, p = 0.0413). It was highly significantly better at mid-gland (52 vs. 41.1%, p = 0.0015) and in the transition zone (40.1 vs. 24.3%, p < 0.0001). MRI had higher sensitivity in larger (≥50 g) than smaller (<50 g) prostates (50.3 vs. 42.2%, p = 0.0017).

This truncated PSMA aptamer (A9L; 41mer) retains binding activity, functionality, and is amenable to large-scale chemical synthesis for future clinical applications. In addition, the modeled RNA tertiary structure and protein/RNA docking predictions revealed key nucleotides within the aptamer critical for binding to PSMA and inhibiting its enzymatic activity.

Most often this is accomplished by identifying genes with changes in mean expression level, so called differentially expressed (DE) genes, and a number of effective methods for identifying DE genes have been developed. Although useful, these approaches do not accommodate other types of differential regulation. An important example concerns differential coexpression (DC). Investigations of this class of genes are hampered by the large cardinality of the space to be interrogated as well as by influential outliers. As a result, existing DC approaches are often underpowered, exceedingly prone to false discoveries, and/or computationally intractable for even a moderately large number of pairs. To address this, an empirical Bayesian approach for identifying DC gene pairs is developed. The approach provides a false discovery rate controlled list of significant DC gene pairs without sacrificing power. It is applicable within a single study as well as across multiple studies. Computations are greatly facilitated by a modification to the expectation-maximization algorithm and a procedural heuristic. Simulations suggest that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in far less computational time; and case study results suggest that the approach will likely prove to be a useful complement to current DE methods in high-throughput genomic studies.""","""['John A Dawson', 'Christina Kendziorski']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biometrics""","""['Bayesian ranking and selection methods using hierarchical mixture models in microarray studies.', 'A Laplace mixture model for identification of differential expression in microarray experiments.', 'Confident difference criterion: a new Bayesian differentially expressed gene selection algorithm with applications.', 'Differential analysis of DNA microarray gene expression data.', 'Reuse of public genome-wide gene expression data.', 'Modeling dynamic correlation in zero-inflated bivariate count data with applications to single-cell RNA sequencing data.', 'Network-based Transcriptome-wide Expression Study for Postmenopausal Osteoporosis.', ""Shannon entropy approach reveals relevant genes in Alzheimer's disease."", 'Differential co-expression-based detection of conditional relationships in transcriptional data: comparative analysis and application to breast cancer.', 'Crosstalk analysis of dysregulated pathways in preeclampsia.']"""

For verification of this hypothesis, wild-type LNCaP prostate cancer cells and HDM2 transfected LNCaP-MST (HDM2 stably transfected) cells were studied. The data obtained from our experiments revealed that the HDM2 transfected LNCaP-MST cells possessed an ability to multiply rapidly and show distinct morphological features compared to non-transfected LNCaP cells. During exposures to hypoxia HDM2 expression in the LNCaP and LNCaP-MST cells was significantly higher compared to the normoxic levels. The LNCaP-MST cells also expressed higher levels of HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor-1α) and p-STAT3 even under the normoxic conditions compared to the non-transfected cells. The HIF-1α and p-STAT3 expressions were increased several fold when the cells were subjected to hypoxic conditions. The HIF-1α and p-STAT3 protein expressions observed in HDM2 transfected LNCaP-MST cells were 20 and 15 folds higher, respectively, compared to the non-transfected wild-type LNCaP cells. These results demonstrate that HDM2 may have an important regulatory role in mediating the HIF-1α and p-STAT3 protein expression during both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression that is typically regulated by HIF-1α and p-STAT3 was also increased significantly by 136% (P < 0.01) after HDM2 transfection.

Specifically, two sets of position-adaptive classifiers are respectively placed along the two coordinate directions, and further trained with the previous segmented treatment images to jointly perform the prostate segmentation.

However, most of these shape-based methods are computationally expensive. There are instances in an image where no overlapping objects are present and applying these schemes results in significant computational overhead without any accompanying, additional benefit. In this paper we present a novel adaptive active contour scheme (AdACM) that combines boundary and region based energy terms with a shape prior in a multi level set formulation. To reduce the computational overhead, the shape prior term in the variational formulation is only invoked for those instances in the image where overlaps between objects are identified; these overlaps being identified via a contour concavity detection scheme. By not having to invoke all 3 terms (shape, boundary, region) for segmenting every object in the scene, the computational expense of the integrated active contour model is dramatically reduced, a particularly relevant consideration when multiple objects have to be segmented on very large histopathological images. The AdACM was employed for the task of segmenting nuclei on 80 prostate cancer tissue microarray images. Morphological features extracted from these segmentations were found to able to discriminate different Gleason grade patterns with a classification accuracy of 84% via a Support Vector Machine classifier.

Incubation with the AMPK activator aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) dose-dependently inhibited cell growth, activated AMPK, and inhibited mTOR. Furthermore, AICAR treatment activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase-3, thereby initiating apoptosis. Within 60 min of treatment AICAR raised intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) which could be abolished in the presence of the free radical scavenger N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycin (NMPG), the AMPK inhibitor compound C (Comp C) and the respiratory chain complex I inhibitor rotenone, but not by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor VAS2870. Inhibition of ROS generation abolished AMPK activation by AICAR as well as JNK and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, AMPK activation, JNK phosphorylation and cleaved caspase-3 upon AICAR treatment were abolished in the presence of Comp C.

This investigation sought to characterize its optimal conditions for whole-body gamma camera imaging in patients.  Materials and methods:   Eleven patients with bone metastases underwent whole-body bone scanning using both ⁹⁹mTc-methyl-diphosphonate (⁹⁹mTc-MDP) and ¹⁷⁷Lu-EDTMP (29.4 ± 12.5 MBq/kg BW) utilizing a dual-head camera. For lutetium-177 imaging, two types of collimators, low-energy high-resolution (LEHR) and medium-energy general-purpose (MEGP), and two different peak energies of 113 and 208 keV were used.  Results:   The femur-to-muscle uptake ratio (F/M) of ⁹⁹mTc-MDP was 2.69 ± 1.06. For ¹⁷⁷Lu-EDTMP, the significantly highest F/Ms were found at 24 h (12.59 ± 5.73) and 48 h (12.54 ± 5.23) by applying MEGP collimators and collecting the 208 keV photons. In all the combinations of collimator and peak energy, the F/Ms at 24 and 48 h are significantly higher than those at 1 h, except the combination of LEHR collimator and 208 keV peak energy. Lesion-to-normal bone uptake ratios of the ⁹⁹mTc-MDP bone scan and images at the 24 and the 48-h phases of Lu-EDTMP were analyzed. MEGP and 208 keV had significantly higher values in lesion-to-normal bone uptake ratios. The combination of LEHR and 208 keV provided the poorest images.  Conclusion:   ¹⁷⁷Lu-EDTMP can provide fine whole-body images with the best results when applying medium-energy collimation and collecting the 208 keV energy photons and alternatively by collecting both 208 and 113 keV photons for higher count statistics.

PARP-1 hyperactivation causes DNA damage and cell death. The underlying mechanism is complicated and is through diverse pathways. The understanding of responsible signaling pathways may offer implications for effective therapies. After concentration-response determination of N-Methyl-N'-Nitro-N-Nitrosoguanidine (MNNG, a PARP-1 activating agent and an environmental mutagen) in human hormone-refractory prostate cancers, the data showed that concentrations below 5μM did not change cell survival but cause a time-dependent up-regulation of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in mRNA, total protein and cell surface levels. Detection of phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α and nuclear translocation of NF-κB showed that MNNG induced the activation of NF-κB that was responsible for the ICAM-1 up-regulation since PDTC (a NF-κB inhibitor) significantly abolished this effect. However, higher concentrations (e.g., 10μM) of MNNG induced a 61% detachment of the cells which were apoptosis associated with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Further identification showed that both AMPK and JNK other than p38 MAPK functionally contributed to cell death. The remaining 39% attached cells were survival associated with high ICAM-1 expression. In conclusion, the data suggest that NF-κB-dependent up-regulation of ICAM-1 plays a key role on cell attachment and survival; whereas, activation of AMPK and JNK participates in cytotoxic signaling pathways in detached cells caused by PARP-1 activation.""","""['Yi-Cheng Chen', 'Pin-Hsuan Lu', 'Jui-Ling Hsu', 'Chia-Chun Yu', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""[""The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 induced by CD40-CD40L ligand signaling in orbital fibroblasts in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy."", ""Vincristine attenuates N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-induced poly-(ADP) ribose polymerase activity in cardiomyocytes."", 'Oxidative stress initiates DNA damager MNNG-induced poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1-dependent parthanatos cell death.', 'Involvement of p42/p44 MAPK, JNK, and NF-kappaB in IL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 expression in human pulmonary epithelial cells.', 'Immune Cell Regulatory Pathways Unexplored as Host-Directed Therapeutic Targets for Mycobacterium tuberculosis: An Opportunity to Apply Precision Medicine Innovations to Infectious Diseases.', 'The Effect of Hypothermic Machine Perfusion to Ameliorate Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Donor Organs.', 'Rosmarinic Acid Activates AMPK to Inhibit Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer.', 'Resveratrol attenuates ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesiveness to TNF-α-treated endothelial cells: evidence for an anti-inflammatory cascade mediated by the miR-221/222/AMPK/p38/NF-κB pathway.', 'Coactivator MYST1 regulates nuclear factor-κB and androgen receptor functions during proliferation of prostate cancer cells.']"""

It gives an estimate for the probability of dying from cancer in the absence of other causes by estimating the excess mortality in the study population when compared to an external group. The external group is usually the general population within a country or state and mortality estimates are taken from national life tables that are broken down by age, sex, calendar year and, where applicable, race/ethnicity. One potential bias when using relative survival that is most often overlooked occurs when there are a high proportion of deaths due to a specific cancer in the external group.  Methods:   This paper uses data from the Finnish Cancer Registry to illustrate, through the use of a simple sensitivity analysis, the impact that specific cancer deaths in the population mortality figures can have on the estimate of relative survival.  Results:   We found that when examining specific diseases such as breast cancer and colon cancer, the proportion of deaths due to these specific cancers in the general population is so small in comparison to the total mortality that they make little difference to the relative survival estimates. However, prostate cancer proved to be an exception to this. For all cancer sites combined the sensitivity analysis illustrates a major limitation for this type of analysis, particularly with the older age groups.

UCHL1 plays an important role in ubiquitin system and different cellular processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation. We now show that the underlying mechanism of UCHL1 downregulation in PCa is linked to its promoter hypermethylation. Furthermore, we present evidences that UCHL1 expression can affect the behavior of prostate cancer cells in different ways.  Results:   Methylation specific PCR analysis results showed a highly methylated promoter region for UCHL1 in 90% (18/20) of tumor tissue compared to 15% (3/20) of normal tissues from PCa patients. Pyrosequencing results confirmed a mean methylation of 41.4% in PCa whereas only 8.6% in normal tissues. To conduct functional analysis of UCHL1 in PCa, UCHL1 is overexpressed in LNCaP cells whose UCHL1 expression is normally suppressed by promoter methylation and found that UCHL1 has the ability to decrease the rate of cell proliferation and suppresses anchorage-independent growth of these cells. In further analysis, we found evidence that exogenous expression of UCHL1 suppress LNCaP cells growth probably via p53-mediated inhibition of Akt/PKB phosphorylation and also via accumulation of p27kip1 a cyclin dependant kinase inhibitor of cell cycle regulating proteins. Notably, we also observed that exogenous expression of UCHL1 induced a senescent phenotype that was detected by using the SA-ß-gal assay and might be due to increased p14ARF, p53, p27kip1 and decreased MDM2.

Aberrant expression patterns promoting carcinogenesis, however, may arise from alternative promoter usage.  Results:   By profiling 108 colorectal samples using exon arrays, we identified nine genes (TCF12, OSBPL1A, TRAK1, ANK3, CHEK1, UGP2, LMO7, ACSL5, and SCIN) showing tumor-specific alternative TSS usage in both adenoma and cancer samples relative to normal mucosa. Analysis of independent exon array data sets corroborated these findings. Additionally, we confirmed the observed patterns for selected mRNAs using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Interestingly, for some of the genes, the tumor-specific TSS usage was not restricted to colorectal cancer. A comprehensive survey of the nine genes in lung, bladder, liver, prostate, gastric, and brain cancer revealed significantly altered mRNA isoform ratios for CHEK1, OSBPL1A, and TCF12 in a subset of these cancer types.To identify the mechanism responsible for the shift in alternative TSS usage, we antagonized the Wnt-signaling pathway in DLD1 and Ls174T colorectal cancer cell lines, which remarkably led to a shift in the preferred TSS for both OSBPL1A and TRAK1. This indicated a regulatory role of the Wnt pathway in selecting TSS, possibly also involving TP53 and SOX9, as their transcription binding sites were enriched in the promoters of the tumor preferred isoforms together with their mRNA levels being increased in tumor samples. Finally, to evaluate the prognostic impact of the altered TSS usage, immunohistochemistry was used to show deregulation of the total protein levels of both TCF12 and OSBPL1A, corresponding to the mRNA levels observed.

Study Type - Harm Reduction RCT Level of Evidence 1b The combination of perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine cream and periprostatic nerve block effectively counteracts probe and sampling related pain during transrectal prostate biopsy, but not pain due to periprostatic infiltration. The novel combination of lidocaine-prilocaine cream and lidocaine-ketorolac gel, both administered perianal-intrarectally, provides the same probe and sampling-related pain relief than combined perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine cream and periprostatic nerve block and prevents the non-negligible pain due to periprostatic infiltration, thus leading to better overall patients' compliance to the procedure.  Objective:   • To compare the efficacy and safety of combined perianal-intrarectal (PI) lidocaine-prilocaine (LP) cream and lidocaine-ketorolac (LK) gel with combined PI LP cream and periprostatic nerve block (PPNB) in relieving pain during transrectal ultrasonography guided prostate biopsy (TPB).  Patients and methods:   • In all, 200 patients were randomized to receive combined PI LP cream and LK gel (group 1) or combined PI LP cream and PPNB (group 2) before TPB. • The 0-10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for assessing pain at probe insertion and movements (VAS-1), periprostatic infiltration (VAS-2) when applied, and prostate sampling (VAS-3), as well as maximal procedural pain (MPP). • Complications occurring ≤ 20 days after the TPB were recorded.  Results:   • The groups were comparable for patients' age, serum PSA level, prostate volume, and cancer detection rate. • All patients tolerated the procedure well. The two anaesthetic regimens provided almost equal mean VAS-1 (0.33 vs 0.37; P= 0.701) and VAS-3 (0.52 vs 0.51; P= 0.954) scores, but patients in group 2 reported significantly greater MPP scores (0.68 vs 1.53; P < 0.001) as periprostatic infiltration was the most painful part of the procedure (mean VAS-2: 1.33). • Complications rate was similar in the two groups (1% vs 2%; P= 0.38).  Conclusions:   • The novel combination of PI LP cream and LK gel provided the same probe- and sampling- related pain relief as combined PI LP and PPNB; moreover, by preventing the non-negligible periprostatic infiltration pain, it provided significantly better overall patients' compliance to the procedure. • Being safe and easy to administer, this novel non-infiltrative regimen has the potential to replace infiltrative anaesthesia in relieving pain during TPB.""","""['Luigi Cormio', 'Vincenzo Pagliarulo', 'Fabrizio Lorusso', 'Oscar Selvaggio', 'Antonia Perrone', 'Francesca Sanguedolce', 'Pantaleo Bufo', 'Giuseppe Carrieri']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Noninfiltrative anesthesia for transrectal prostate biopsy: a randomized prospective study comparing lidocaine-prilocaine cream and lidocaine-ketorolac gel.', 'Combination of perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine cream and periprostatic nerve block for pain control during transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy: a randomized, controlled trial.', 'Perianal and intrarectal anaesthesia for transrectal biopsy of the prostate: a prospective randomized study comparing lidocaine-prilocaine cream and placebo.', 'Addition of intrarectal local analgesia to periprostatic nerve block improves pain control for transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Effectiveness of periprostatic block to prevent pain in transrectal prostate biopsy: a systematic review and a network meta-analysis.', 'Oncological outcomes of whole-gland cryoablation in patients with prostate cancer and high risk of lymph node invasion.', 'One-Day Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Digital Pathology by Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy.', 'Bioptic prostatic inflammation correlates with false positive rates of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'PSA Density Help to Identify Patients With Elevated PSA Due to Prostate Cancer Rather Than Intraprostatic Inflammation: A Prospective Single Center Study.', 'Prospective Validation of Pentraxin-3 as a Novel Serum Biomarker to Predict the Risk of Prostate Cancer in Patients Scheduled for Prostate Biopsy.']"""

We found no difference in sexual bother scores between patients who use and do not use phosphodiesterase inhibitors. This suggests that the current definition of potency, inclusive of medication use, is valid with respect to sexual bother.  Objective:   To determine whether the current definition of potency, inclusive of phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDEi) use, is valid with respect to sexual bother (SB). This will be assessed by characterizing the effect of PDEi use on SB scores in men who are potent post radical prostatectomy.  Patients and methods:   The study population consisted of patients who were potent both before and after radical prostatectomy, with at least 2 years of follow-up. Disease-specific quality of life data were evaluated by the University of California, Los Angeles, Prostate Cancer Index (PCI) survey. The relationships between changes in sexual function (SF) and SB and use of PDEi over time were evaluated by mixed model analysis controlling for age, clinical risk group, marital status, and time of PCI assessment.  Results:   Of the 246 patients who met the study criteria, 39% reported PDEi use at some point after treatment. PDEi use was not associated with improved SF (P= 0.81). Furthermore, PDEi use was not associated with a change in SB (P= 0.36). Both SF and SB were significantly associated with time of assessment and age, and SF and SB each improved over time. In addition, SB was significantly associated with marital status.  Conclusions:   In this analysis, there was no difference in SF scores between men who were potent with or without the use of PDEi.

Findings from a prospective national study of the relation between sexual function, activity and bother""","""What's known on the subject? And what does the study add? Sexual function is often impaired after radical prostatectomy resulting in reduced sexual activity and sexual bother. The main focus in the literature concerning sexual adverse effects has been on erectile dysfunction and impairment of sexual function rather than the actual sexual bother it causes, although the sexual bother is most important to the individual patient's quality of life. The relation between these measures, and in particular preoperative prediction of postoperative sexual bother, has only been studied in a limited way and with varying results. Some studies have found good mental health, low levels of preoperative sexual bother, and higher education to be associated with absence of postoperative sexual bother, but another study could not identify any preoperative predictors of postoperative sexual bother. Severe sexual bother after radical prostatectomy was reported by 64% to 95% of patients 3 years after operation, and the prevalence was associated with the level of pretreatment sexual bother and peroperative nerve preservation. On the other hand, others have reported that only 43% of men have sexual bother 2 years after radical prostatectomy. However, none of these studies stratified patients according to their preoperative sexual activity and most of them were American. It has been shown that American findings concerning sexual bother may not always be valid for non-American patients due to differing sex role expectations, thus warranting the need for more non-American studies. This study has shown that two-thirds of patients experienced sexual bother 1 year after radical prostatectomy. We have identified patients with increased risk of experiencing overall sexual bother postoperatively: those who report preoperative sexual bother, those who are sexually active before radical prostatectomy, and those who display neurotic personality traits. Another important finding is that the proportion of patients who experienced bother relevant to having impaired postoperative sexual function was significantly higher among preoperatively sexually active patients than those who had been inactive. This study adds knowledge that patients' preoperative sexual activity, sexual bother and personality should be taken into account to be able to give individualized information about the risk of experiencing sexual bother after radical prostatectomy. Study Type--Therapy (outcomes research). Level of Evidence 2c.  Objective:   • To explore the prevalence and prediction of overall sexual bother (SB) 1 year after radical prostatectomy (RP) in relation to preoperative sexual activity and postoperative sexual function.  Patients and methods:   • This prospective national study included 453 men who completed the sexual domain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite before and 1 year after RP. • Preoperatively the patients were classified as sexually active or inactive based on frequency of intercourse during the previous 4 weeks. • The prevalence of 1-year SB and the proportion of bothered patients with impaired sexual function were calculated. • Preoperative factors significantly associated with postoperative SB on univariate analysis (P < 0.05) were included in multivariate regression analysis, post-prostatectomy SB being the dependent variable.  Results:   • The prevalence of SB increased from 18% preoperatively to 66% at 1 year after RP with a larger proportion of change in the active than the inactive group (59% vs 25%). • The proportion of men reporting postoperative SB related to their impaired sexual function 1 year after RP was significantly higher in the preoperatively sexually active group (83%) compared with the inactive group (63%). • In multivariate analysis preoperative SB, sexual activity and nervousness (neuroticism) significantly predicted postoperative SB with odds ratios of 3.71, 2.11 and 1.57, respectively.  Conclusion:   • Sexual activity and SB the last month before prostatectomy and neuroticism identify men at risk of developing SB 1 year postoperatively.

In this study, making use of in vitro neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of human LNCaP and mouse TRAMP-C2 cells after androgen withdrawal, and of the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model, we characterized a sequence of molecular events leading to NED and identified a number of markers that could be detectable by routine analyses not only in castration resistant PC but also in hormone naïve PC at the time of initial diagnosis. We found that NED associates with AKT activation that in turn regulates heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), androgen receptor (AR) and β-catenin levels. Addition of molecules targeting membrane-bound receptors and protein kinases blocks NE differentiation in LNCaP and TRAMP-C2 cells. The extent of AKT phosphorylation and hnRNP K, AR and β-catenin levels may have a potential value as prognostic indicators discriminating between androgen-responsive and unresponsive cells and could be used as molecular targets to monitor the anti-tumor action of new therapeutic protocols based on antireceptor agents and/or neuroendocrine hormone antagonists.""","""['Monica Ciarlo', 'Roberto Benelli', 'Ottavia Barbieri', 'Simona Minghelli', 'Paola Barboro', 'Cecilia Balbi', 'Nicoletta Ferrari']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Increased Akt signaling resulting from the loss of androgen responsiveness in prostate cancer.', 'Broadening of transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model to represent late stage androgen depletion independent cancer.', '5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol supports human prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation through androgen receptor-independent signaling pathways: implication of androgen-independent prostate cancer progression.', 'Prognostic significance of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Cross-talk between the androgen receptor and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in prostate cancer.', 'c-Myc-induced long noncoding RNA MIRE cooperates with hnRNPK to stabilize ELF2 mRNA and promotes clear cell renal cell carcinogenesis.', 'High-throughput drug screening identifies fluoxetine as a potential therapeutic agent for neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Molecular mechanisms of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer progression.', 'Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K promotes the progression of lung cancer by inhibiting the p53-dependent signaling pathway.']"""

The purpose of this study was to compare five GFMs regarding feasibility of ultrasound-based implantation in the prostate and intraprostatic lesion (IPL); toxicity; visibility on transabdominal ultrasound (TU) and cone-beam CT (CBCT); reliability of automatic, soft tissue, and GFM-based CBCT patient positioning by comparing manual and automatic fusion CBCT.  Methods and materials:   Twenty-five patients were included. Pain and toxicity were scored after implantation and high-dose radiotherapy. Fisher exact test was used to evaluate the correlation of patients' characteristics and prostatitis. Positioning was evaluated on TU and kilovoltage CBCT images. CBCT fusion was performed automatically (Elekta XVI technology, release 3.5.1 b27, based on grey values) and manually on soft tissue and GFMs. Pearson correlation statistics and Bland-Altman evaluation were used. Five GFMs were compared.  Results:   Twenty percent of the patients developed prostatitis despite antibiotic prophylaxis. Cigarette smoking was significantly correlated with prostatitis. The visualization of all GFMs on TU was disappointing. Consequently we cannot recommend the use of these GFMs for TU-based prostate positioning. For all GFMs, there was only fair to poor linear correlation between automatic and manual CBCT images, indicating that even when GFMs are used, an operator evaluation is imperative. However, when GFMs were analyzed individually, a moderate to very strong correlation between automatic and manual positioning was found for larger GFMs in all directions.  Conclusion:   The incidence of prostatitis in our series was high. Further research is imperative to define the ideal preparation protocol preimplantation and to select patients. Automatic fusion is more reliable with larger GFMs at the cost of more scatter. The stability of all GFMs was proven.""","""['Valérie Fonteyne', 'Piet Ost', 'Geert Villeirs', 'Willem Oosterlinck', 'Aline Impens', 'Werner De Gersem', 'Carlos De Wagter', 'Gert De Meerleer']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Registration free automatic identification of gold fiducial markers in MRI target delineation images for prostate radiotherapy.', 'A comparative assessment of prostate positioning guided by three-dimensional ultrasound and cone beam CT.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) for prostate cancer comparing kV imaging of fiducial markers with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).', 'Evaluation of kV cone-beam ct performance for prostate IGRT: a comparison of automatic grey-value alignment to implanted fiducial-marker alignment.', 'Recent advances on graphyne and its family members as membrane materials for water purification and desalination.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', 'Prostate positioning using cone-beam computer tomography based on manual soft-tissue registration: interobserver agreement between radiation oncologists and therapists.']"""

Materials and methods:   Male participants 40 to 79 years old were identified from the Southern Community Cohort Study, a prospective cohort based in the southeastern United States. Baseline data collection included a validated physical activity questionnaire, height and weight, health history and other information. We excluded participants with a history of or medication use for benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer. Participants (7,318, 60% African-American) completed the International Prostate Symptom Score approximately 5 years after baseline. Patients with an International Prostate Symptom Score greater than 8 or 20 were classified as having moderate or severe lower urinary tract symptoms, respectively, at followup. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationships among obesity, physical activity and lower urinary tract symptoms.  Results:   Moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptom severity at followup was significantly associated with a body mass index of 35 kg/m(2) or more (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.17-1.63). Similarly the lowest categories of physical activity were associated with the onset of severe lower urinary tract symptoms in men with a normal body mass index (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05-1.82). These associations were independent of race.

Materials and methods:   Mortality rates for prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney and renal pelvis cancer, and cancer at all sites for white patients in United States counties from 2003 to 2007 were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System. High and low rate groups of counties were reviewed for each type of cancer. The high rate groups consisted of 15 or 25 counties with the highest cancer mortality rates. The low rate groups consisted of counties, selected from the same states as high rate groups, with the lowest mortality rates. Levels of physicians per 10,000 general population, income, poverty and no health insurance were compared between the high and low cancer rate groups.  Results:   There was a statistically significant inverse association between physician population density levels and kidney and renal pelvis cancer mortality rates. The association was suggestive for bladder cancer and prostate cancer mortality but not for cancer at all sites.

In a recent phase III trial toremifene significantly decreased vertebral fractures in men on androgen deprivation therapy. Similar to other selective estrogen receptor modulators, toremifene was associated with an increase in venous thromboembolic events with the greatest risk in men 80 years old or older. In this post hoc analysis we evaluated the efficacy and safety of toremifene in men younger than 80 years.  Materials and methods:   This analysis included 847 men younger than 80 years, of whom 430 received toremifene 80 mg by mouth daily and 417 received placebo for up to 24 months. The primary end point was new vertebral fractures. Secondary end points included fragility fractures, bone mineral density and safety.  Results:   Compared with placebo, toremifene decreased the relative risk of new vertebral fractures by 79.5% (95% CI 29.8-94.0, p <0.005). The new vertebral fracture incidence was 1.0% for toremifene and 4.8% for placebo (absolute risk reduction 3.8%). Compared with placebo, toremifene significantly decreased the incidence of nontraumatic fracture or greater than 7% bone loss by 24 months (p <0.0001). Toremifene also significantly increased bone mineral density at all measured sites (all comparisons p <0.001). The incidence of venous thromboembolic events was similar in the toremifene and placebo groups (2.1% and 1.0%, respectively, p = 0.26). The rates of other adverse events were also similar between the groups.  Conclusions:   Toremifene significantly decreased new vertebral fractures in men younger than 80 years receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.

Predicting upgrading in men with low risk prostate cancer may be particularly important since high grade disease influences management decisions and impacts prognosis. We determined whether prostate size predicts Gleason score upgrading in patients with low risk prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A total of 1,251 consecutive patients with D'Amico low risk disease and complete data available underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution between January 2000 and June 2008. Patients were divided into 3 groups by pathological Gleason score, including no, minor (3 + 4 = 7) and major (4 + 3 = 7 or greater) Gleason score upgrading. We developed bivariate and multivariate models to determine whether prostate size was an important predictor of upgrading while controlling for clinical and biopsy characteristics.  Results:   Of 1,251 cases 387 (31.0%) were upgraded, including 324 (26%) and 63 (5%) with minor and major upgrading, respectively. As expected, Gleason score upgrading was associated with worse pathological and cancer control outcomes. On multivariate analysis smaller prostate size was an independent predictor of any and major upgrading (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48-0.69, p <0.01 and OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.96, p = 0.03, respectively). Men with prostate volume at the 25th percentile (36 cm(3)) were 50% more likely to experience upgrading than men with prostate volume at the 75th percentile (58 cm(3)).  Conclusions:   Of low risk cases 31% were upgraded at final pathology. Smaller prostate size predicts Gleason score upgrading in men with clinically low risk prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   A total of 106 men with findings suspicious for prostate cancer (median age 66 years, prostate specific antigen 8.0 ng/ml and prostate volume 47 ml) underwent multiparametric 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Suspicious lesions were marked and data were transferred to the novel biopsy system. Using a custom-made biplane transrectal ultrasound probe mounted on a stepper we gathered 3-dimensional ultrasound data and fused them with magnetic resonance imaging data. As a result, suspicious magnetic resonance imaging lesions were superimposed over the transrectal ultrasound data. Three-dimensional biopsy planning was done, including systematic biopsies. Perineal biopsies were taken under live ultrasound guidance and the precise site of each biopsy was documented in 3 dimensions. We evaluated feasibility, safety and cancer detection.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 63 of 106 patients (59.4%). Magnetic resonance imaging findings correlated positively with histopathology in 71 of 103 patients (68.9%). In magnetic resonance imaging lesions marked as highly suspicious, the detection rate was 95.8% (23 of 24 cases).

It is unknown whether prostate specific antigen doubling time calculated in the ultrasensitive range (prostate specific antigen less than 0.2 ng/ml) accurately reflects measures performed in the traditional range (prostate specific antigen greater than 0.2 ng/ml).  Materials and methods:   We studied 394 men in a national disease registry of men with prostate cancer (CaPSURE™) who underwent radical prostatectomy, experienced biochemical failure, and had prostate specific antigen doubling time assessed using ultrasensitive and traditional prostate specific antigen values. Agreement between these measurements was assessed using Cohen's kappa score.  Results:   Median ultrasensitive prostate specific antigen doubling time was 11.9 months (IQR 6-29) and median traditional prostate specific antigen doubling time was 240 months (IQR 18-240). Agreement between ultrasensitive and traditional prostate specific antigen doubling time was poor, with a weighted Cohen's kappa score of 0.04 (95% CI -0.02-0.10). Using a dichotomous prostate specific antigen doubling time cutoff of 9 months, there was a statistically significant difference between ultrasensitive and standard prostate specific antigen doubling time (exact McNemar p <0.01). Ultrasensitive prostate specific antigen doubling time was more or less rapid than traditional prostate specific antigen doubling time by more than 15 months in 244 (62%) and 35 (9%) patients, respectively.  Conclusions:   Agreement between prostate specific antigen doubling time calculated using ultrasensitive vs traditional prostate specific antigen values is poor. Ultrasensitive prostate specific antigen doubling time is often significantly more rapid than traditional prostate specific antigen doubling time, potentially overestimating the risk of clinical recurrence.

In utero/lactational exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) impairs fetal/neonatal development and the developing male reproductive tract are among the most sensitive tissues. TCDD causes antiestrogenic responses in rodent mammary gland and uterus and in human breast cancer cell lines in the presence of estrogen. Also, more recently an estrogen-like effect of TCDD/AhR has been suggested in the absence of estrogen. A transgenic mouse expressing a constitutively active AhR (CA-AhR) was developed as a model mimicking a situation of constant exposure to AhR agonists. Male and female reproductive tissues of CA-AhR mice were characterized for some of the effects commonly seen after dioxin exposure. Sexually mature CA-AhR female mice showed decreased uterus weight, while an uterotrophic assay in immature CA-AhR mice resulted in increased uterus weight. In immature mice, both TCDD-exposure and CA-AhR increased the expression of the estrogen receptor target gene Cathepsin D. When co-treated with 17β-estradiol no increase in Cathepsin D levels occurred in either TCDD-exposed or CA-AhR mice. In sexually mature male CA-AhR mice the weights of testis and ventral prostate were decreased and the epididymal sperm reserve was reduced. The results of the present study are in accordance with previous studies on dioxin-exposed rodents in that an activated AhR (here CA-AhR) leads to antiestrogenic effects in the presence of estrogen, but to estrogenic effects in the absence of estrogen. These results suggest the CA-AhR mouse model as a useful tool for studies of continuous low activity of the AhR from early development, resembling the human exposure situation.""","""['Sara Brunnberg', 'Patrik Andersson', 'Lorenz Poellinger', 'Annika Hanberg']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Chemosphere""","""['Responsiveness of the adult male rat reproductive tract to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exposure: Ah receptor and ARNT expression, CYP1A1 induction, and Ah receptor down-regulation.', 'Effects of aryl hydrocarbon receptor null mutation and in utero and lactational 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exposure on prostate and seminal vesicle development in C57BL/6 mice.', 'The constitutively active Ah receptor (CA-Ahr) mouse as a potential model for dioxin exposure--effects in vital organs.', 'Mechanisms of inhibitory aryl hydrocarbon receptor-estrogen receptor crosstalk in human breast cancer cells.', 'Modulation of gene expression and endocrine response pathways by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related compounds.', 'Natural and Synthetic Estrogens in Chronic Inflammation and Breast Cancer.', 'Chronic aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity phenocopies smoking-induced skeletal muscle impairment.', 'Exposure to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals and Risk of Breast Cancer.', ""The association of peripubertal serum concentrations of organochlorine chemicals and blood lead with growth and pubertal development in a longitudinal cohort of boys: a review of published results from the Russian Children's Study."", 'The AhR Ligand, TCDD, Regulates Androgen Receptor Activity Differently in Androgen-Sensitive versus Castration-Resistant Human Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Lifestyle and dietary changes are recommended for men diagnosed with early-stage PC. It has been shown that a diet rich in whole grain (WG) rye reduces the progression of early-stage PC, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. This study sought to identify changes in the metabolic signature of plasma in patients with early-stage PC following intervention with a diet rich in WG rye and rye bran product (RP) compared with refined white wheat product (WP) as a tool for mechanistic investigation of the beneficial health effects of RP on PC progression. Seventeen PC patients received 485 g RP or WP in a randomized, controlled, crossover design during a period of 6 wk with a 2-wk washout period. At the end of each intervention period, plasma was collected after fasting and used for (1)H NMR-based metabolomics. Multilevel partial least squares discriminant analysis was used for paired comparisons of multivariate data. A metabolomics analysis of plasma showed an increase in 5 metabolites, including 3-hydroxybutyric acid, acetone, betaine, N,N-dimethylglycine, and dimethyl sulfone, after RP. To understand these metabolic changes, fasting plasma homocysteine, leptin, adiponectin, and glucagon were measured separately. The plasma homocysteine concentration was lower (P = 0.017) and that of leptin tended to be lower (P = 0.07) after RP intake compared to WP intake. The increase in plasma 3-hydroxybutyric acid and acetone after RP suggests a shift in energy metabolism from anabolic to catabolic status, which could explain some of the beneficial health effects of WG rye, i.e., reduction in prostate-specific antigen and reduced 24-h insulin secretion. In addition, the increase in betaine and N,N-dimethylglycine and the decrease in homocysteine show a favorable shift in homocysteine metabolism after RP intake.""","""['Ali A Moazzami', 'Jie-Xian Zhang', 'Afaf Kamal-Eldin', 'Per Aman', 'Göran Hallmans', 'Jan-Erik Johansson', 'Sven-Olof Andersson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Nutr""","""['Metabolomics reveals the metabolic shifts following an intervention with rye bread in postmenopausal women--a randomized control trial.', 'Rye whole grain and bran intake compared with refined wheat decreases urinary C-peptide, plasma insulin, and prostate specific antigen in men with prostate cancer.', 'Consumption of whole grain/bran rye instead of refined wheat decrease concentrations of TNF-R2, e-selectin, and endostatin in an exploratory study in men with prostate cancer.', 'Targeted metabolomics reveals differences in the extended postprandial plasma metabolome of healthy subjects after intake of whole-grain rye porridges versus refined wheat bread.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Effects of a 12-week whole-grain or refined wheat intervention on plasma acylcarnitines, bile acids and signaling lipids, and association with liver fat: A post-hoc metabolomics study of a randomized controlled trial.', 'Metabolic Phenotyping in Prostate Cancer Using Multi-Omics Approaches.', 'A Scoping Review of the Application of Metabolomics in Nutrition Research: The Literature Survey 2000-2019.', 'Profiling of Endogenous and Gut Microbial Metabolites to Indicate Metabotype-Specific Dietary Responses: A Systematic Review.', 'Postoperative serum metabolites of patients on a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet after pancreatectomy for pancreatobiliary cancer: a nontargeted metabolomics pilot study.']"""

Methods:   Sera from 20 prostate cancer patients and 20 healthy controls were incubated on expression clone arrays containing more than 37,000 recombinant human proteins. Functional annotation clustering of the identified autoantigens was performed using the DAVID database. Autoantigens identified in the prostate cancer group were validated on microarrays using sera of 40 prostate cancer patients, 40 patients with elevated PSA levels but prostate cancer negative biopsies (benign disease), and 40 healthy controls.  Results:   We detected autoantibodies against 408 different antigens in sera of prostate cancer patients. One hundred seventy-four of these were exclusively detected in the cancer group compared to the healthy control group. Functional annotation clustering revealed an enrichment of RNA-associated, cytoskeleton, and nuclear proteins. The autoantibody panel was validated in serum samples of independent prostate cancer patients. Autoantibody profiles discriminated between prostate cancer patients and benign disease patients with an ROC curve AUC of 0.71. TTLL12, a protein recently described to be over-expressed in prostate cancer, was the highest ranked discrimination autoantigen.

How these four oncogenic ETS genes differ from the numerous other ETS genes expressed in normal prostate and contribute to tumor progression is not understood. We report that these oncogenic ETS proteins, but not other ETS factors, enhance prostate cell migration. Genome-wide binding analysis matched this specific biological function to occupancy of a unique set of genomic sites highlighted by the presence of ETS- and AP-1-binding sequences. ETS/AP-1-binding sequences are prototypical RAS-responsive elements, but oncogenic ETS proteins activated a RAS/MAPK transcriptional program in the absence of MAPK activation. Thus, overexpression of oncogenic ETS proteins can replace RAS/MAPK pathway activation in prostate cells.

The results demonstrate that all of the three oxoanions can cause G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, which is evidenced by the increase in the level of phosphorylated Cdc2 at its inactive Tyr-15 site. Moreover, even if the difference in cellular uptake among the three oxoanions is excluded from the possible factors affecting their antiproliferative activity, vanadate exerted a much more potent effect in PC-3 cells than the other two oxoanions. Our results also reveal that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated degradation of Cdc25C rather than Cdc25A or Cdc25B is responsible for vanadate-induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest.

Molecularly targeted agents are offering hope for their potential role in helping translate the improved activity of combination chemotherapy into improved survival. Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) is a chaperone implicated in several pathological processes such as cancer. Further, Hsp27 expression becomes highly upregulated in cancer cells after chemotherapy. Recently, a modified antisense oligonucleotide that is complementary to Hsp27 (OGX-427) has been developed, which inhibits Hsp27 expression and enhances drug efficacy in cancer xenograft models. Phase II clinical trials using OGX-427 in different cancers like breast, ovarian, bladder, prostate and lung are in progress in the United States and Canada. In this study, we demonstrate using TMA of 181 patients that Hsp27 expression and phosphorylation levels increase in moderately differentiated tumors to become uniformly highly expressed in metastatic samples. Using MiaPaCa-2 cells grown both in vitro and xenografted in mice, we demonstrate that OGX-427 inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis and also enhances gemcitabine chemosensitivity via a mechanism involving the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E. Collectively, these findings suggest that the combination of Hsp27 knockdown with OGX-427 and chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine can be a novel strategy to inhibit the progression of pancreas cancer.""","""['V Baylot', 'C Andrieu', 'M Katsogiannou', 'D Taieb', 'S Garcia', 'S Giusiano', 'J Acunzo', 'J Iovanna', 'M Gleave', 'C Garrido', 'P Rocchi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Phosphorylation status of heat shock protein 27 plays a key role in gemcitabine-induced apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells.', 'The Clinical Significance of Phosphorylated Heat Shock Protein 27 (HSPB1) in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Overexpression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) increases gemcitabine sensitivity in pancreatic cancer cells through S-phase arrest and apoptosis.', 'Suppression of heat shock protein 27 using OGX-427 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and potentiates heat shock protein 90 inhibitors to delay castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Heat-shock protein 27 plays the key role in gemcitabine-resistance of pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Resistance to Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer Is Connected to Methylglyoxal Stress and Heat Shock Response.', 'Translational alterations in pancreatic cancer: a central role for the integrated stress response.', 'Pancreatic Cancer: Nucleic Acid Drug Discovery and Targeted Therapy.', 'Targeting a Tumor-Specific Epitope on Podocalyxin Increases Survival in Human Tumor Preclinical Models.', 'The Role of Hsp27 in Chemotherapy Resistance.']"""

Methods:   An online survey distributed to members of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine elicited decisions on commencing full treatment (CFT), limiting treatment or palliation in hypothetical clinical scenarios. Quantitative data were summarised using number and percentage.  Results:   388 surveys yielded a 13.0% response rate, including 190 fellows (51.9%) and 176 trainees (48.1%). For a 75-year-old patient with major trauma and unknown comorbidities requiring laparotomy, most participants (355/365, 97.3%) chose CFT. When an AD limiting treatment was made available, CFT decreased substantially (63/364, 17.3%), and the modal response was palliation (175/364, 48.1%). The most frequently reported influential factor in this decision was ethical obligation (82/383, 21.4%). For an elderly nursing-home resident with dementia, metastatic cancer and possible septic shock, 10.7% (39/366) chose CFT, changing little (21/365, 5.8%) with a directive requesting full treatment. The patient's presentation and history (189/375, 50.4%) overrode legal obligations (14/375, 3.7%) in influencing the decision. For a 55-year-old man with prostate cancer, hypoxia and acute respiratory distress (potentially requiring ventilatory support) saying, 'I just want to end it all,' most (233/366, 63.7%) chose CFT. A directive requesting limitation resulted in fewer decisions on CFT (43/368, 11.7%). Clear documentation was most important (100/362, 27.6%) in influencing this decision.  Conclusion:   Hypothetical treatment decisions involving ADs made by emergency clinicians appear to be more influenced by ethical and clinical factors than by legal obligations.""","""['Rebecca E Wong', 'Tracey J Weiland', 'George A Jelinek']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Emerg Med J""","""['Attitudes of physicians, nurses and relatives towards end-of-life decisions concerning nursing home patients with dementia.', 'Personality characteristics of physicians and end-of-life decisions in Russia.', ""Advance directives in the prehospital setting -- emergency physicians' attitudes."", 'A model for emergency department end-of-life communications after acute devastating events--part I: decision-making capacity, surrogates, and advance directives.', 'Ethical issues in emergency care.', 'Recommendation-making in the emergency department: A qualitative study of how Canadian emergency physicians guide treatment decisions about resuscitation in critically ill patients.', 'Multidisciplinary Clinicians and the Relational Autonomy of Persons with Neurodegenerative Disorders and an Advance Care Plan: A Thematic Analysis.', 'Advance Care Plans and the Potentially Conflicting Interests of Bedside Patient Agents: A Thematic Analysis.', 'The Impact of Dementia on Cancer Treatment Decision-Making, Cancer Treatment, and Mortality: A Mixed Studies Review.', 'Ceilings of treatment: a qualitative study in the emergency department.']"""

Design:   Semistructured, qualitative interview study with purposive sampling and thematic analysis.  Participants:   28 patients treated for colorectal cancer.  Setting:   West Midlands.  Results:   Most men treated for colorectal cancer experience erectile dysfunction as a consequence. Not all, however, want the same response from health professionals. Although, erectile dysfunction is profoundly stressful for most men, affecting self image, behaviour, and relationships, some do not regard it as a health priority. Many of the men were uninformed about erectile dysfunction and were unprepared for it, and the majority neither helped themselves nor asked for help. Almost none were receiving adequate, effective, and affordable care. Evidence of ageism was strong.  Conclusions:   Unlike patients with prostate cancer, men with colorectal cancer are not routinely offered information and treatment for erectile dysfunction. Greater coordination of care and consistent strategies are needed to tackle the unmet needs of this widely diverse patient group.

Methods:   Separate prostate cancer IMRT plans were prepared for 6 and 15-MV beams. Organ-equivalent doses were obtained through thermoluminescent dosemeter measurements in an anthropomorphic Aldersen radiation therapy human phantom. The neutron dose contribution at 15 MV was measured using polyallyl-diglycol-carbonate neutron track etch detectors. Risk coefficients from the International Commission on Radiological Protection Report 103 were used to compare the risk of fatal secondary induced malignancies in out-of-field organs and tissues for 6 and 15 MV. For the bladder and the rectum, a comparative evaluation of the risk using three separate models was carried out. Dose-volume parameters for the rectum, bladder and prostate planning target volume were evaluated, as well as normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) and tumour control probability calculations.  Results:   There is a small increased theoretical risk of developing a fatal cancer from 6 MV compared with 15 MV, taking into account all the organs. Dose-volume parameters for the rectum and bladder show that 15 MV results in better volume sparing in the regions below 70 Gy, but the volume exposed increases slightly beyond this in comparison with 6 MV, resulting in a higher NTCP for the rectum of 3.6% vs 3.0% (p=0.166).  Conclusion:   The choice to treat using IMRT at 15 MV should not be excluded, but should be based on risk vs benefit while considering the age and life expectancy of the patient together with the relative risk of radiation-induced cancer and NTCPs.""","""['M Hussein', 'S Aldridge', 'T Guerrero Urbano', 'A Nisbet']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['In vivo and phantom measurements of the secondary photon and neutron doses for prostate patients undergoing 18 MV IMRT.', 'The impact of IMRT and proton radiotherapy on secondary cancer incidence.', 'Conformal irradiation of concave-shaped PTVs in the treatment of prostate cancer by simple 1D intensity-modulated beams.', 'Out-of-field organ doses and associated risk of cancer development following radiation therapy with photons.', 'Second primary cancers after radiation for prostate cancer: a review of data from planning studies.', 'Monte-Carlo calculation of output correction factors for ionization chambers, solid-state detectors, and EBT3 film in small fields of high-energy photons.', 'Effect of contrast medium on treatment modalities planned with different photon beam energies: a planning study.', 'Comparison of IMRT and VMAT plans with different energy levels using Monte-Carlo algorithm for prostate cancer.', 'Simultaneous integrated boost to intraprostatic lesions using different energy levels of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-arc therapy.', 'The effect of photon energy on intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for prostate cancer.']"""

However, this test does not take the possible trend of relative risks, which are due to genotype, into account. On the contrary, although Cochran-Armitage trend test with optimal scores is more powerful; it is usually difficult to assign the correct scores in advance since the true genetic model is rarely known in practice. If the unknown underlying genetic models are misspecified, the trend test may lose power dramatically. Therefore, it is desirable to find a powerful yet robust statistical test for genome-wide association studies. In this paper, we propose a new test based on the partition of Pearson's Chi-square test statistic.

However, novel suicide genes, such as Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), have been utilized to demonstrate more potent tumor killing and an enhanced bystander effect on local, non-expressing cells compared to HSV-tk.

After infection of various cell lines with ADV.ARR(2) PB-PNP and administration of androgen analog, R1881, expression of PNP mRNA was detected; in vivo, the antitumor effect of the ARR(2) PB-PNP/Fludara system was monitored and analyzed, as well as animal survival.  Results:   After in vitro infection with ADV.ARR(2) PB-PNP (multiplicity of infection = 10), LNCaP cells were more sensitive to a lower concentration Fludara (LD(50) , approximately 0.1 µg/ml) in the presence of R1881. Furthermore, robust bystander effects after R1881/Fludara treatment were observed in LNCaP cells after infection with bicistronic vector ADV.ARR2PB/PNP-IRES-EGFP in contrast to a much weaker effect in cells treated with ADV.CMV-HSV-tk/GCV. In vivo, tumor size in the ADV.ARR2PB-PNP/Fludara treatment group was dramatically smaller than in the control groups, and the mice treated with our system had a significantly prolonged survival, with three of eight mice surviving up to the 160-day termination point, as well as no systemic toxicity.

Multivariable logistic regression analyses, fitted with general estimation equations for clustering among hospitals, adjusted for confounding factors.  Results:   Overall, 61,167 RPs were identified. Of those, private insurance accounted for the majority of cases (n = 41,312, 67.5%), followed by Medicare (n = 18,759, 30.7%) and Medicaid (n = 1096, 1.8%). Insurance status other than private was associated with higher rates of blood transfusions (P < .001), higher overall postoperative complication rates (P < .001), higher rates of hospital stay above the median (P < .001), as well as higher in-hospital mortality (P = .01). In multivariable analyses, compared with patients with private insurance, Medicaid patients had higher rates of blood transfusion (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, P < .001), length of stay beyond the median (OR = 1.61, P < .001) postoperative complications (OR= 1.24, P = .02), and in-hospital mortality (OR = 4.91, = .01). Similarly, Medicare patients had higher rates of blood transfusions (OR = 1.21, P < .001), overall postoperative complications (OR = 1.17, P×< .001) and length of stay beyond the median (OR = 1.25, P < .001).  Conclusions:   Even after adjusting for confounding factors, patients with private insurance have better outcomes than their counterparts with nonprivate insurance.""","""['Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Jan Schmitges', 'Maxine Sun', 'Jesse Sammon', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Kevin Zorn', 'Shyam Sukumar', 'Marco Bianchi', 'Paul Perrotte', 'Markus Graefen', 'Craig G Rogers', 'James O Peabody', 'Mani Menon', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Leapfrog volume thresholds and perioperative complications after radical prostatectomy.', 'Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy: results from the nationwide inpatient sample.', 'The effect of gender on nephrectomy perioperative outcomes: a national survey.', 'Does Insurance Effect the Outcome in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome?: An Insight from the Most Recent National Inpatient Sample.', 'Radical prostatectomy: a systematic review of the impact of hospital and surgeon volume on patient outcome.', 'Disparities in access to robotic technology and perioperative outcomes among patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Development of a preoperative risk score predicting allogeneic red blood cell transfusion in children undergoing spinal fusion.', 'Association between the incidence and mortality rates for corpus uteri cancer and human development index (HDI): a global ecological study.', 'Interrelationship Between Health Insurance Status and Prostate Cancer Grade Can Have Critical Impact on Prostate Cancer Disease Control: A Retrospective Cohort Study.', 'Risk factors involved in treatment delays and differences in treatment type for patients with prostate cancer by risk category in an academic safety net hospital.']"""

Prostate carcinoma (PC) cells display the propensity to metastasize to bone marrow where they disrupt bone homeostasis as a result of mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions. The PC-dependent activation of osteoclasts represents the initial step of tumor engraftment into bone, followed by an accelerated osteoblastic activity and exaggerated bone formation. However, the interactions between PC cells and MSCs and their participation in the disease progression remain as yet unclear. In this study, we show that bone metastatic PC-3 carcinoma cells release factors that increase the expression by human (h)MSCs of several known pro-osteoblastic commitment factors, such as α5/β1 integrins, fibronectin, and osteoprotegerin. As a consequence, as shown in an osteogenesis assay, hMSCs treated with conditioned medium (C(ed) M) derived from PC-3 cells have an enhanced potential to differentiate into osteoblasts, as compared to hMSCs treated with control medium or with C(ed) M from non-metastatic 22RV1 cells. We demonstrate that FGF-9, one of the factors produced by PC-3 cells, is involved in this process. Furthermore, we show that PC-3 C(ed) M decreases the pro-osteoclastic activity of hMSCs. Altogether, these findings allow us to propose clues to understand the mechanisms by which PC favors bone synthesis by regulating MSC outcome and properties.""","""['V Fritz', 'J M Brondello', 'J O Gordeladze', 'J E Reseland', 'C Bony', 'H Yssel', 'D Noël', 'C Jorgensen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Osteolytic prostate cancer cells induce the expression of specific cytokines in bone-forming osteoblasts through a Stat3/5-dependent mechanism.', 'Antitumoral activity and osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells expressing the urokinase-type plasminogen antagonist amino-terminal fragment in a murine model of osteolytic tumor.', 'p65-Dependent production of interleukin-1β by osteolytic prostate cancer cells causes an induction of chemokine expression in osteoblasts.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases promote both osteolytic and osteoblastic activity.', 'Pathogenesis of osteoblastic bone metastases from prostate cancer.', 'Carcinoma-Associated Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells: Architects of the Pro-tumorigenic Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell-derived interleukin-28 drives the selection of apoptosis resistant bone metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen modulates the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs via the cadherin 11-Akt axis.', 'Stemness in Cancer: Stem Cells, Cancer Stem Cells, and Their Microenvironment.', 'Clonal heterogeneity in osteogenic potential of lung cancer-associated fibroblasts: promotional effect of osteogenic progenitor cells on cancer cell migration.']"""

Methods:   From 2008 to 2009, data on 526 consecutive patients who underwent prostate biopsy was prospectively recorded and analysed. 475 (90.3 percent) patients received PPNB with 10 ml of one percent lignocaine (Group 1), which was carried out under TRUS-guidance and prior to biopsy. 51 (9.7 percent) patients received diclofenac (100 mg) intramuscular injections or no analgesia (Group 2). Complications were defined as any adverse effects after biopsy. Serious complications were defined as those requiring hospitalisation or invasive/operative procedures for treatment.  Results:   At baseline, both groups were comparable. The mean prostate-specific antigen level in Group 1 was higher than that in Group 2 (48.6 +/- 13.8 versus 19.0 +/- 4.3 ng/ml; p-value is 0.04).

Because EBRT dose influences biochemical failure, the authors investigated the interval to biochemical failure in a cohort of patients treated with dose-escalated EBRT.  Methods:   From 1998 to 2008, 710 patients were treated with EBRT (≥75 grays) ± androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at the University of Michigan. Biochemical failure was defined using the Phoenix consensus definition (nadir + 2 ng/mL). A short interval to biochemical failure was defined as <18 months after completing radiotherapy and/or ADT. The associations between biochemical failure, the interval to biochemical failure, and clinical factors with cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.  Results:   There were 149 biochemical failures (21%), and short interval to biochemical failure accounted for 14% and 40% of biochemical failures in those with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease, respectively. Biochemical failure impacted CSS (P < .0001) but not OS (P = .36). However, a short interval to biochemical failure predicted decreased CSS (P < .0001; hazard ratio [HR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-13.0) and OS (P < .0001; HR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.3-10.3) when compared with a long interval to biochemical failure. The 8-year OS was 78% without biochemical failure, compared with 87% with a long interval to biochemical failure (P = .1; HR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.4-1.1) and 38% with a short interval to biochemical failure (P < .0001; HR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.3-5.9).

The PSA count, although invaluable in the early detection of PCa, is not being paid for by health insurance schemes, because its indiscriminate use would result in overdiagnosis of PCa which, in turn would burden patients with avoidable morbidity and the mutually supportive community with unnecessary costs. Accordingly, some clinically insignificant tumors are being detected and treated although treatment appears unnecessary. However, more importantly too many significant tumors which need early detection to be cured are being discovered too late due to diagnostic possibilities being neglected. At least one third of all tumors discovered are still found at a locally advanced stage. Following diagnosis by biopsy the therapeutic recommendations are guided by the clinical stage. In spite of recent advances in MR-based imaging the exact local extent of tumors remains uncertain. Prognostic and predictive biomarkers for aid in therapeutic decisions are also lacking. The more defensive therapeutic strategies, such as active surveillance should be recommended with special precautions in patients younger than 65 years, in the light of new Scandinavian data. Among the curative treatments radical prostatectomy claims the primary position.

Methods:   Prostate cancer diagnostic signatures were generated by applying linear discriminant analysis to microarray and real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) data from normal and tumoural prostate tissue samples. Additionally, after removal of biopsy tissues, material washed off from transrectal biopsy needles was used for molecular profiling and discriminant analysis.  Results:   Linear discriminant analysis applied to microarray data for a set of 318 genes differentially expressed between non-tumoural and tumoural prostate samples produced 26 gene signatures, which classified the 84 samples used with 100% accuracy. To identify signatures potentially useful for the diagnosis of prostate biopsies, surplus material washed off from routine biopsy needles from 53 patients was used to generate qRT-PCR data for a subset of 11 genes. This analysis identified a six-gene signature that correctly assigned the biopsies as benign or tumoural in 92.6% of the cases, with 88.8% sensitivity and 96.1% specificity.  Conclusion:   Surplus material from prostate needle biopsies can be used for minimal-size gene signature analysis for sensitive and accurate discrimination between non-tumoural and tumoural prostates, without interference with current diagnostic procedures.

RU486 is also used for treatment of several cancers, such as breast, ovarian, prostate, and glaucoma. Here, we investigated the effect of RU486 on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. Low dose of RU486 (30-50 μM) alone had no effect on apoptosis, but RU486 markedly sensitized Caki cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We found that up-regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5; receptor for TRAIL ligand), and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and c-FLIP (caspase regulator) contributes to RU-486 induced TRAIL sensitization. Down-regulation of DR5 by siRNA also blocked RU486 induced TRAIL sensitization. Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-1 or c-FLIP(L) inhibited the cell death induced by the combined treatment with RU486 and TRAIL. RU486 increased DR5 expression at the transcriptional levels through induction of CHOP expression. By contrast, RU486 did not sensitize normal human mesangial cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Effect of RU486 on TRAIL-induced cancer cell apoptosis was independent of glucocorticoid receptor and progesterone receptor.

Materials and methods:   Sixty-eight patients (group 1) were treated with RT following radical prostatectomy (RP) using CBCT-guided conformal RT to a median dose of 68.4Gy. CBCT images were acquired three to five times weekly and were automatically co-registered to a reference CT. A comparative group (group 2) included 150 patients who received post-RP RT with weekly port films to a median dose of 64.8Gy. GU and GI toxicities were graded in both the acute and late settings using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. Associations between toxicity and study variables were evaluated by odds ratios (ORs) estimated by logistic regression.  Results:   Grades 2 and 3 acute GU toxicity were experienced by 13% (n=9) and 2% (n=1) of patients in group 1, respectively, while 13% (n=19) had grade 2 acute GU toxicity in the control group (group 2). Grade 2 acute GI toxicity was experienced by 13% (n=9) and 15% (n=23) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Acute GU (P=0.67) and GI (P =0.84) toxicities were not significantly different between the two groups. There were no associations detected between CBCT and acute GI toxicity (OR 0.76, P=0.57) or acute GU (OR 1.16, P=0.75). Increased odds of acute GU toxicity were observed for doses>68.4Gy (OR 12.81, P=0.04), which were only delivered in the CBCT group. CBCT mean variations (standard deviation) for 1053 fractions were 2.8mm (2.8), 2.0mm (2.4) and 3.1mm (2.9) in the left-to-right, anterior-to-posterior (AP) and superior-to-inferior (SI) axes, respectively. Corrective shifts for variance≥5mm were required for 15%, 6% and 19% of fractions in the left-to-right, anterior-to-posterior and superior-to-inferior axes, respectively.  Conclusions:   Rates of acute toxicity with CBCT-guided post-RP RT to 68.4Gy were similar to treatment to 64.8Gy without image-guidance RT.

However, biomarker identification for specific diseases has been hindered by irreproducibility. Specifically, a peak profile extracted from a dataset for biomarker identification depends on a data pre-processing algorithm. Until now, no widely accepted agreement has been reached.  Results:   In this paper, we investigated the consistency of biomarker identification using differentially expressed (DE) peaks from peak profiles produced by three widely used average spectrum-dependent pre-processing algorithms based on SELDI-TOF MS data for prostate and breast cancers. Our results revealed two important factors that affect the consistency of DE peak identification using different algorithms. One factor is that some DE peaks selected from one peak profile were not detected as peaks in other profiles, and the second factor is that the statistical power of identifying DE peaks in large peak profiles with many peaks may be low due to the large scale of the tests and small number of samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the DE peak detection power in large profiles could be improved by the stratified false discovery rate (FDR) control approach and that the reproducibility of DE peak detection could thereby be increased.  Conclusions:   Comparing and evaluating pre-processing algorithms in terms of reproducibility can elucidate the relationship among different algorithms and also help in selecting a pre-processing algorithm. The DE peaks selected from small peak profiles with few peaks for a dataset tend to be reproducibly detected in large peak profiles, which suggests that a suitable pre-processing algorithm should be able to produce peaks sufficient for identifying useful and reproducible biomarkers.""","""['Jinfeng Zou', 'Guini Hong', 'Xinwu Guo', 'Lin Zhang', 'Chen Yao', 'Jing Wang', 'Zheng Guo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Sensitive and specific peak detection for SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a wavelet/neural-network based approach.', ""Identification of protein biomarkers in Dupuytren's contracture using surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS)."", 'Comparison of algorithms for pre-processing of SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry data.', 'SELDI-TOF serum proteomics and colorectal cancer: a current overview.', 'Reproducibility in protein profiling by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.', 'Identification of Tamoxifen-Resistant Breast Cancer Cell Lines and Drug Response Signature.', 'Proteins are potent biomarkers to detect colon cancer progression.', 'Advances in Proteomic Technologies and Its Contribution to the Field of Cancer.']"""

We previously described distinct expression and function of p44 in prostate, testis, and breast cancers. In this report, we examined the expression and function of p44 in ovarian cancer. In contrast to findings in prostate and testicular cancer and similar to breast cancer, p44 shows strong cytoplasmic localization in morphologically normal ovarian surface and fallopian tube epithelia, while nuclear p44 is observed in invasive ovarian carcinoma. We observed that p44 can serve as a coactivator of both androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) in ovarian cells. Further, overexpression of nuclear-localized p44 stimulates proliferation and invasion in ovarian cancer cells in the presence of estrogen or androgen. These findings strongly suggest that p44 plays a role in mediating the effects of hormones during ovarian tumorigenesis.""","""['Martin Ligr', 'Ruzeen Rohintan Patwa', 'Garrett Daniels', 'Lorraine Pan', 'Xinyu Wu', 'Yirong Li', 'Liantian Tian', 'Zhenxing Wang', 'Ruliang Xu', 'Jingjing Wu', 'Fan Chen', 'Jinsong Liu', 'Jian-Jun Wei', 'Peng Lee']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Androgen receptor coactivator p44/Mep50 in breast cancer growth and invasion.', 'Androgen receptor coactivators that inhibit prostate cancer growth.', 'Nuclear transport signals control cellular localization and function of androgen receptor cofactor p44/WDR77.', 'cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iβ interacts with p44/WDR77 to regulate androgen receptor-driven gene expression.', 'Estrogen and prostate cancer: an eclipsed truth in an androgen-dominated scenario.', 'WDR77 inhibits prion-like aggregation of MAVS to limit antiviral innate immune response.', 'Expression, Localization and Prognosis Association of MEP50 in Breast Cancer.', 'Molecular Regulation of Androgen Receptors in Major Female Reproductive System Cancers.', 'Hormone therapy for ovarian cancer: Emphasis on mechanisms and applications (Review).', 'Androgen/Androgen Receptor Signaling in Ovarian Cancer: Molecular Regulation and Therapeutic Potentials.']"""

Development of novel non-invasive methods to monitor response to treatment is therefore needed. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging are non-invasive imaging methods that can be employed to monitor metabolism, and previous studies indicate that these methods can be useful for monitoring the metabolic consequences of treatment that are associated with early drug target modulation. However, single-metabolite biomarkers are often not specific to a particular therapy. Here we used an unbiased 1H MRS-based metabolomics approach to investigate the overall metabolic consequences of treatment with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor 17AAG in prostate and breast cancer cell lines. LY294002 treatment resulted in decreased intracellular lactate, alanine fumarate, phosphocholine and glutathione. Following 17AAG treatment, decreased intracellular lactate, alanine, fumarate and glutamine were also observed but phosphocholine accumulated in every case. Furthermore, citrate, which is typically observed in normal prostate tissue but not in tumors, increased following 17AAG treatment in prostate cells. This approach is likely to provide further information about the complex interactions between signaling and metabolic pathways. It also highlights the potential of MRS-based metabolomics to identify metabolic signatures that can specifically inform on molecular drug action.""","""['Alessia Lodi', 'Sabrina M Ronen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['17-allyamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin treatment results in a magnetic resonance spectroscopy-detectable elevation in choline-containing metabolites associated with increased expression of choline transporter SLC44A1 and phospholipase A2.', 'Magnetic resonance spectroscopic pharmacodynamic markers of the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor 17-allylamino,17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) in human colon cancer models.', 'Molecular signature of response and potential pathways related to resistance to the HSP90 inhibitor, 17AAG, in breast cancer.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Drug-mediated targeted disruption of multiple protein activities through functional inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone complex.', 'Sunitinib versus Pazopanib Dilemma in Renal Cell Carcinoma: New Insights into the In Vitro Metabolic Impact, Efficacy, and Safety.', 'Carbon sources and pathways for citrate secreted by human prostate cancer cells determined by NMR tracing and metabolic modeling.', 'Pharmacometabolomics Applied to Personalized Medicine in Urological Cancers.', 'Current Status and Future Prospects of Clinically Exploiting Cancer-specific Metabolism-Why Is Tumor Metabolism Not More Extensively Translated into Clinical Targets and Biomarkers?', 'Novel Imaging in Detection of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

Although most prostate cancers are slow-growing and indolent, a proportion is aggressive, developing metastasis and resistance to androgen deprivation treatment. One hypothesis is that a portion of aggressive cancers initiate from stem-like, androgen-independent tumor-propagating cells. Here we demonstrate the in vitro creation of a mouse cell line, selected for growth as self-renewing stem/progenitor cells, which manifests many in vivo properties of aggressive prostate cancer. Normal mouse prostate epithelium containing floxed Pten and TP53 alleles was subjected to CRE-mediated deletion in vitro followed by serial propagation as protospheres. A polyclonal cell line was established from dissociated protospheres and subsequently a clonal daughter line was derived. Both lines demonstrate a mature luminal phenotype in vitro. The established lines contain a stable minor population of progenitor cells with protosphere-forming ability and multi-lineage differentiation capacity. Both lines formed orthotopic adenocarcinoma tumors with metastatic potential to lung. Intracardiac inoculation resulted in brain and lung metastasis, while intra-tibial injection induced osteoblastic bone formation, recapitulating the bone metastatic phenotype of human prostate cancer. The cells showed androgen receptor dependent growth in vitro. Importantly, in vivo, the deprivation of androgens from established orthotopic tumors resulted in tumor regression and eventually castration-resistant growth.

Yet despite high protein sequence homology, expression of π-class GSTs, the most abundant of the enzymes, varies significantly between species. In mouse liver, hepatocytes exhibit high mGstp expression, while in human liver, hepatocytes contain little or no hGSTP1 mRNA or hGSTP1 protein. π-class GSTs are known to be critical determinants of liver responses to drugs and toxins: when treated with high doses of acetaminophen, mGstp1/2+/+ mice suffer marked liver damage, while mGstp1/2-/- mice escape liver injury.  Methodology/principal findings:   To more faithfully model the contribution of π-class GSTs to human liver toxicology, we introduced hGSTP1, with its exons, introns, and flanking sequences, into the germline of mice carrying disrupted mGstp genes. In the resultant hGSTP1+mGstp1/2-/- strain, π-class GSTs were regulated differently than in wild-type mice. In the liver, enzyme expression was restricted to bile duct cells, Kupffer cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells, reminiscent of human liver, while in the prostate, enzyme production was limited to basal epithelial cells, reminiscent of human prostate. The human patterns of hGSTP1 transgene regulation were accompanied by human patterns of DNA methylation, with bisulfite genomic sequencing revealing establishment of an unmethylated CpG island sequence encompassing the gene promoter. Unlike wild-type or mGstp1/2-/- mice, when hGSTP1+mGstp1/2-/- mice were overdosed with acetaminophen, liver tissues showed limited centrilobular necrosis, suggesting that π-class GSTs may be critical determinants of toxin-induced hepatocyte injury even when not expressed by hepatocytes.

The controversial discussion about the virus being detected in PCA tissue, blood samples from patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), as well as from a significant number of healthy controls prompted us to deepen our studies about detection of XMRV infection applying different detection methods (PCR, cocultivation and immunohistochemistry [IHC]).  Methodology/principal findings:   Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 92 PCA and 7 healthy controls were isolated, PHA activated and cocultivated with LNCaP cells for up to 8 weeks.

Furthermore, the PBMCs and cocultivated LNCaP cells were tested for the presence of XMRV by PCR as well as Western Blot analysis. While all PCR amplifications and Western Blot analyses were negative for signs of XMRV infection, DERSE-iGFP cells displayed isolated GFP positive cells in three cases.

Methods:   The pathology database of the New York Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC), an equal access-of-care facility, was searched for patients with biopsy-proven PCa.

Two isoforms of AR, are AR-A and -B, which differ by a lack of the first 187 amino acids in the NH2-terminal transactivation domain of AR-A. Since little is known about the expression and basic function of the AR-A/B isoforms in prostate cancer, the aim of this study was to analyze this possible association. The AR-A, -B and AR-A/B ratio was determined in the tissues of healthy controls, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa by means of Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The elevation of AR-A, and -B, as well as the AR-A/B ratio with regard to Gleason scores, were assessed in prostate cancer compared to BPH and normal prostate. In order to further investigate the role of AR A/B isoform function, we transfected PC3 cells with an AR or AR-A expression vector. The overexpression of AR-A and -B significantly decreased the invasion and proliferation of PC3 cells. However, the overexpression of AR-A further decreased proliferation but accelerated the invasion of PC3 cells compared to AR-B. In conclusion, the elevation of AR-A and -B, and the AR-A/B ratio, is associated with prostate cancer occurrence and progression. Furthermore, AR-A could provide a new potential therapy with regard to the decrease in the invasion and proliferation of prostate cancer cells.

Previously, we have shown that diallyl trisulfide (DATS)-induced prostate cancer cell death was mediated by increased ROS formation. In this study, we investigated the role of p66Shc protein and its serine 36 phosphorylation in DATS induced decrease in prostate cancer cell viability (PC-3).  Methods:   PC-3 prostate cancer cells were used in this study. Stable cell lines expressing p66ShcS36A or an empty vector have been obtained. Cell viability, concentration of ROS, changes in P-p66Shc and P-Akt and DNA damage were determined.  Results:   We observed that DATS treatment increased p66Shc phosphorylation at serine 36. Importantly, the phosphorylation was abolished by JNK inhibitor SP600125. Cells expressing plasmid-encoded variant of p66ShcS36A showed much higher resistance to DATS-induced cells death. In addition to that, we observed that DATS-induced ROS formation was completely abolished in cells expressing the p66ShcS36A variant. Interestingly, SP600125 proved to prevent DATS-induced Akt inactivation. In order to confirm that the observed effect is related to phosphorylation of p66Shc, we performed experiments on a stable cell line expressing p66ShcS36A. In such cells, DATS-induced Akt dephosphorylation was significantly reduced. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide induced Akt activation in PC-3 cells, which was abrogated in cells expressing p66ShcS36A.

The rectal lesion had not been detected during the first procedure. The rectal bladder fistula appeared on the 14th post-operative day. After three weeks from the procedure,the patient underwent a laparoscopic repair of the rectovesical fistula. A temporary external colon conduit was performed at the same time.  Materials and methods:   We performed a cystoscopy before the surgery; it showed a fistula behind the bladder neck at 5 o'clock, distally to the left ureteral orifice. Two ureteral stents were inserted into both the ureters to make sure not to determine any injury to these structures during the operation. With the patient in the supine position, we introduced 5 trocars with the Hasson technique trans-peritoneally. The pouch of Douglas was opened and the bladder was divided from the rectum.The bladder posterior wall was widely opened till reaching the rectal bladder fistula.The fistula was located distally to the left ureteral orifice, very close to the bladder neck. Through a blunt dissection, we divided the margins of the rectal fistula from those of the posterior bladder wall.Indeed, we performed a suture of the rectal wall without any tension. The rectal lesion was closed in a double-layer suture with 3-0 Vicryl.We introduced a probe into the rectum to make sure there was no leakage on the suture. A flap of peritoneum of the Douglas was put between bladder and rectum.We closed the longitudinal opening of the trigone and the bladder posterior wall through a continuous suture.An external colic conduit was packaged to guarantee the closure of the fistula. The left colon was put through the abdominal wall widening the 5 mm trocar opening located on the left pararectal space.  Results:   The operative time was 240 minutes. There were no post-operative complications. The bladder catheter was removed at 1 month after surgery,only after performing a cystography, which showed no leakage.Two months later, the colostomy was closed. At a 12-month follow-up the patient had no fistula recurrence.  Conclusions:   The treatment of arectovesical fistula after radical prostatectomy remains a complex procedure: different types of corrective surgical approaches have been described. The laparoscopic approach is an alternative to standard procedures. The optical magnification allows a good view of the fistula in a very deep and narrow space. It also allows easy performing of the colostomy.""","""['Paolo Parma', 'Alessandro Samuelli', ""Bruno Dall'Oglio"", 'Livio Cappellaro', 'Candido Bondavalli', 'Francesco De Luca']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urologia""","""[""Robotic-assisted laparoscopic repair of rectovesical fistula after Hartmann's reversal procedure."", 'Laparoscopic rectovesical fistula repair.', 'Robotic repair of rectovesical fistula resulting from open radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic urorectal fistula repair: value of the salvage prostatectomy and review of current approaches.', 'Laparoscopic treatment of genitourinary fistulae.', 'Repair of a rectovesical fistula following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with Martius fat pad flap interposition: a proposal of a new technique.', ""Robotic-assisted laparoscopic repair of rectovesical fistula after Hartmann's reversal procedure.""]"""

A contrast agent was used to study the effects of ultrasound exposure in combination with microbubbles on liposomes, which transfect genes into human prostate cancer cells. The human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in suspension was exposed to ultrasound with a 20% duty cycle (i.e., 2 sec 'on' time and 8 sec 'off' time) lasting 5 min, with and without ultrasound contrast agent (SonoVue™) using a digital sonifier at a frequency of 21 kHz and an intensity of 4.6 mW/cm2. Immediately after exposure to ultrasound, cell viability and membrane damage were measured. After exposure to ultrasound, the cell suspensions were put into 12‑well plates and cultured for 24 h. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry were used to detect pEGFP transfection efficiency. Exposure to ultrasound alone and ultrasound combined with microbubbles resulted in minimal cell death and induced negligible cell membrane damage. Ultrasound combined with microbubbles had a greater effect on cell membrane damage in all groups: the average cell membrane damage was 41.87%, and it was approximately 42‑fold greater than in the control group. The average transfection efficiency of PC-3 cells was 20.30% for the liposome (Lipofectamine™)+pEGFP+ultrasound+ultrasound contrast agent (SonoVue) group; this was the highest rate of all groups measured and was approximately 81‑fold greater than that of the control group.

AGS-1C4D4 is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and has an identical sequence to AGS-PSCA, an anti-PSCA antibody produced in mouse hybridoma cells that has completed Phase I testing. Preclinical studies demonstrated comparability of AGS-1C4D4 to AGS-PSCA with respect to pharmacokinetics (PK) and tumor inhibition. However, because of differences in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity between AGS-PSCA and AGS-1C4D4, a limited Phase I trial using AGS-1C4D4 was performed evaluating safety and PK.  Patients and methods:   Thirteen patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were enrolled. AGS-1C4D4 was administered intravenously every 3 weeks for four planned doses at 6, 12, 24, or 48 mg/kg. Primary endpoints were safety and PK. Secondary endpoints were immunogenicity and clinical activity. Disease assessments were conducted every 12 weeks and included radiographic and PSA evaluations. Patients with stable disease could receive extended treatment beyond four infusions.  Results:   Adverse events were primarily grade 1-2, without any grade 3-4 drug-related toxicities or infusion reactions. Anti-AGS-1C4D4 antibodies were not detected. Similar to AGS-PSCA, serum AGS-1C4D4 concentrations declined biphasically and elimination was characterized by slow clearance (CL) and a long terminal half-life (t (1/2)). Median CL for the four dose levels ranged from 0.10 to 0.14 ml/h kg, and t (1/2) ranged from 2.2 to 2.9 weeks. No PSA reductions ≥50% were observed. Six patients (46%) had radiographically stable disease, lasting a median of 24 weeks.  Conclusion:   AGS-1C4D4 was well-tolerated and demonstrated linear PK.

We also studied the effect of monensin, an apoptosis inducing reagent, in X-ray-induced cell killing. Comparison of gene expressions between unirradiated LNCaP and PC3 cells revealed distinguished gene expression patterns. The data showed a significantly higher expression level of genes involved in the caspase/card family and the TNF ligand/receptor family in PC3 cells, whereas, LNCaP cells exhibited higher expressions in the p53 related genes.

There was no significant apoptosis-inducing effect of X-rays (up to 10 Gy) in both cell lines; however, monensin was shown to be effective in inducing apoptosis in LNCaP, but not in PC3 cells. In addition, the effect of combined treatment of monensin and X-rays in LNCaP cells appeared to be synergistic.

Various subforms of free PSA, which are associated with prostate cancer differently, have been identified in sera. Thus, specific detection of certain subforms could permit discrimination between benign and malignant cases. Although the monoclonal antibody 5D3D11 displays the desired selectivity, its relative weak binding affinity prevents its development into an effective diagnostic tool. The directed-evolution strategy presented here succeeds in enhancing affinity and immunoassay sensitivity while maintaining selectivity. Starting without structural data, we constructed four independent phage-display single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries targeting hot spots from CDR-L1, H1, H2, and H3. Mutations derived from each library were combined, yielding further affinity gains. This constitutes the first demonstration of additivity for independently selected complementarity-determining region (CDR) hot-spot mutations. The X-ray structure of the Fab' 5D3D11-PSA complex (after it became available) inspired the design of two new libraries targeting CDR-L3 that resulted in other higher-affinity variants. Attempts at combining the new variants with previous ones did not result in further gains, suggesting that mutations from the two strategies provide alternative but noncomplementary solutions for affinity enhancement of 5D3D11. The results can be interpreted to provide a plausible explanation for the observed lack of additivity. Finally, with respect to the wild-type scFv, the best binders show an enhancement of sensitivity in sandwich immunoassay. Its ability to discriminate between prostate cancer sera and benign prostatic hyperplasia sera has now been confirmed through the dosage of 63 patients.""","""['Bruno H Muller', 'Alexandra Savatier', ""Guillaume L'Hostis"", 'Narciso Costa', 'Marc Bossus', 'Sandrine Michel', 'Catherine Ott', 'Laurence Becquart', 'Alain Ruffion', 'Enrico A Stura', 'Frédéric Ducancel']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Mol Biol""","""['Crystal structure of human prostate-specific antigen in a sandwich antibody complex.', 'Phage display aided improvement of a unique prostate-specific antigen (PSA) antibody unreactive with Lys(145)-Lys(146) internally cleaved forms.', 'Improvement of anti-Burkholderia mouse monoclonal antibody from various phage-displayed single-chain antibody libraries.', 'Tumor-associated forms of prostate specific antigen improve the discrimination of prostate cancer from benign disease.', 'Prostate-specific antigen as a tumor marker of prostate carcinoma.', 'Bi-epitope SPR surfaces: a solution to develop robust immunoassays.', 'Aberrant PSA glycosylation--a sweet predictor of prostate cancer.', 'Combining different design strategies for rational affinity maturation of the MICA-NKG2D interface.', 'Molecular engineering of antibodies for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.']"""

The aim of this study was to quantify and characterize prostate intrafraction motion assessed by multiple kilovoltage (kV) and megavoltage (MV) imaging of implanted markers during treatment in a large patient group.  Methods and materials:   Intrafraction motion in the sagittal plane was studied by retrospective analysis of displacements of implanted gold markers on (nearly) lateral kV and MV images obtained at various time points during the treatment fractions (mean, 27 per patient) in 108 consecutive patients. The effective prostate motion in a fraction was defined as the time-weighted mean displacement.  Results:   Prostate displacements in the sagittal plane increased during the fraction (mean, 0.2 ± 0.2 mm/min). Forty percent of patients had a systematic (i.e., appearing in all fractions) effective displacement in the sagittal plane greater than 2 mm. Observed effective population mean-of-means (μeff) +/- systematic (Σeff) intrafraction motion (μ(eff) ± Σ(eff)) was 0.9 ± 1.1 mm and 0.6 ± 1.0 mm for the anterior-posterior and superior inferior directions, respectively. Corresponding random motion (σ(eff)) was 1.2 mm and 1.1 mm. Mean effective prostate motion in the first 5 fractions was predictive for mean effective displacement in the remaining fractions (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   For a large subgroup of patients, the systematic component of intrafraction prostate motion was substantial. Intrafraction motion correction prior to each beam delivery or offline corrections could likely be beneficial for the subgroup of patients with significant motion. The systematic component is well predicted by measurements in the initial fractions.""","""['Theodore F Mutanga', 'Hans C J de Boer', 'Vinayakrishnan Rajan', 'Maarten L P Dirkx', 'Luca Incrocci', 'Ben J M Heijmen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Relationship of imaging frequency and planning margin to account for intrafraction prostate motion: analysis based on real-time monitoring data.', 'Intrafraction motion of the prostate during an IMRT session: a fiducial-based 3D measurement with Cone-beam CT.', 'Software-controlled, highly automated intrafraction prostate motion correction with intrafraction stereographic targeting: System description and clinical results.', 'Dynamic targeting image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Organ motion and its management.', 'Prostate deformation during hypofractionated radiotherapy: an analysis of implanted fiducial marker displacement.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: Rationale, current applications, and clinical outcome.', 'Analysis of intra-fraction prostate motion and derivation of duration-dependent margins for radiotherapy using real-time 4D ultrasound.', 'Delivered dose quantification in prostate radiotherapy using online 3D cine imaging and treatment log files on a combined 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging and linear accelerator system.', 'Approach and assessment of automated stereotactic radiotherapy planning for early stage non-small-cell lung cancer.']"""

The purpose of the present study was to analyze the mechanism of radiation-mediated upregulation of adenoviral transgene expression.  Methods and materials:   Adenoviral transgene expression (luciferase or green fluorescent protein) was studied with and without radiation in three cell lines: breast cancer M4A4-LM3, prostate cancer PC-3MM2, and lung cancer LNM35/enhanced green fluorescent protein. The effect of the radiation dose, modification of the viral capsid, and five different transgene promoters were studied. The cellular responses were studied using mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence analysis. Double strand break repair was modulated by inhibitors of heat shock protein 90, topoisomerase-I, and DNA protein kinase, and transgene expression was measured.  Results:   We found that a wide range of radiation doses increased adenoviral transgene expression regardless of the cell line, transgene, promoter, or viral capsid modification. Treatment with adenovirus, radiation, and double strand break repair inhibitors resulted in persistence of double strand breaks and subsequent increases in adenovirus transgene expression.  Conclusions:   Radiation-induced enhancement of adenoviral transgene expression is linked to DNA damage recognition and repair. Radiation induces a global cellular response that results in increased production of RNA and proteins, including adenoviral transgene products. This study provides a mechanistic rationale for combining radiation with adenoviral gene delivery.""","""['Petri Nokisalmi', 'Maria Rajecki', 'Sari Pesonen', 'Sophie Escutenaire', 'Rabah Soliymani', 'Mikko Tenhunen', 'Laura Ahtiainen', 'Akseli Hemminki']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Amplification of recombinant adenoviral transgene products occurs by inhibition of histone deacetylase.', 'Novel adenoviral gene delivery system targeted against head and neck cancer.', 'Gene therapy for prostate cancer: toxicological profile of four HSV-tk transducing adenoviral vectors regulated by different promoters.', 'Advances in adenoviral vectors: from genetic engineering to their biology.', 'Adenoviral/retroviral vector chimeras: a novel strategy to achieve high-efficiency stable transduction in vivo.', 'Hitting the nail on the head: combining oncolytic adenovirus-mediated virotherapy and immunomodulation for the treatment of glioma.', 'Oncolytic immunotherapy: where are we clinically?']"""

We characterized the effect of paclitaxel (Sigma®) on Golgi involved apoptosis in human hormone refractory prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   FACScan™ flow cytometric analysis was used to determine cell cycle distribution and the subG1 (apoptosis) population. Protein expression and localization were detected by Western blot, confocal microscopic examination and the sucrose gradient separation technique.  Results:   Paclitaxel induced Golgi apparatus disassembly and interaction between Golgi complexes and mitochondria. Discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation was used to determine and collect Golgi containing fractions. Data revealed that paclitaxel induced an increase of Cdk1 activity and DR5 expression on the Golgi complex that was associated with increased cleavage of caspase-8, a DR5 downstream factor, and caspase-3 into catalytically active fragments. Data were validated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Golgi associated effects were inhibited by the Cdk1 inhibitor roscovitine (Sigma), suggesting a critical role for Golgi-Cdk1. Also, paclitaxel caused an increase of nuclear but not of Golgi associated PKC-δ activity. The selective PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin (Sigma) completely inhibited the increase of Golgi-Cdk1 activity, suggesting that nuclear PKC-δ served as an upstream regulator of Golgi-Cdk1.  Conclusions:   Data suggest that paclitaxel induces nuclear translocation and activation of PKC-δ, which in turn causes Golgi-Cdk1 activation, leading to Golgi associated DR5 up-regulation, and caspase-8 and 3 activation. Golgi mediated signaling cascades facilitate mitochondria involved apoptotic pathways and at least partly explain the anticancer activity of paclitaxel action.""","""['Pin-Hsuan Lu', 'Chia-Chun Yu', 'Po-Cheng Chiang', 'Yi-Cheng Chen', 'Yunn-Fang Ho', 'Fan-Lu Kung', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Protein kinase Cdelta amplifies ceramide formation via mitochondrial signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Alisol B acetate, a triterpene from Alismatis rhizoma, induces Bax nuclear translocation and apoptosis in human hormone-resistant prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Pretreatment with paclitaxel enhances apo-2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by inducing death receptors 4 and 5 protein levels.', 'Methylseleninic acid potentiates apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Implications of the Golgi apparatus in prostate cancer.', 'Protein Kinase C (PKC) Isozymes as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Cancer.', 'PBK attenuates paclitaxel-induced autophagic cell death by suppressing p53 in H460 non-small-cell lung cancer cells.', 'Golgi Structure and Function in Health, Stress, and Diseases.', 'Anticancer activity of the protein kinase C modulator HMI-1a3 in 2D and 3D cell culture models of androgen-responsive and androgen-unresponsive prostate cancer.', 'Prediction of novel drug indications using network driven biological data prioritization and integration.']"""

Diet, physical activity, and stress reduction may affect tumor promotion and disease progression.  Methods:   A randomized trial of an intensive diet, physical activity, and meditation intervention was conducted in men with rising post-treatment PSA after definitive treatment for PrCA. Intention-to-treat methods were used to compare usual care to the intervention in 47 men with complete data. Signal detection methods were used to identify dietary factors associated with PSA change.  Results:   The intervention and control groups did not differ statistically on any demographic or disease-related factor. Although the intervention group experienced decreases of 39% in intakes of saturated fatty acid (SFA as percent of total calories) (p<0.0001) and 12% in total energy intake (218 kcal/day, p<0.05)], no difference in PSA change was observed by intervention status. Signal detection methods indicated that in men increasing their consumption of fruit, 56% experienced no rise in PSA (vs. 29% in men who did not increase their fruit intake). Among men who increased fruit and fiber intakes, PSA increased in 83% of participants who also increased saturated fatty acid intake (vs. 44% in participants who decreased or maintained saturated fatty acid intake).  Conclusion:   Results are discussed in the context of conventional treatment strategies that were more aggressive when this study was being conducted in the mid-2000s.

However, there have been few efforts to definitively determine the optimal length of linker between PSMA inhibitor cores and their payload molecules with regard to the affinity to PSMA and in vitro performance. In our present model study, three spacer-length varied fluorescent inhibitors (FAM-CTT-54, FAM-X-CTT-54 and FAM-PEG(8)-CTT-54) were synthesized, and further enzymatic inhibition studies displayed linker length-dependent changes in: inhibitory potency (IC(50)=0.41 nM, 0.35 nM, 1.93 nM), modes of binding (reversible, slowly reversible, irreversible), respectively. Furthermore, cell-labeling imaging revealed the spacer length-related change of fluorescence intensity (FAM-X-CTT-54>FAM-PEG(8)-CTT-54>FAM-CTT-54).

Interestingly, the deacetylase core of Sirt1 by itself has no catalytic activity. We found within the C-terminal domain a 25 aa sequence that is essential for Sirt1 activity (ESA). Our results indicate that the ESA region interacts with and functions as an ""on switch"" for the deacetylase core. The endogenous Sirt1 inhibitor DBC1, which also binds to the deacetylase core, competes with and inhibits the ESA region from interacting with the deacetylase core.

High-grade prostate cancers are associated with poor disease-specific outcomes. A proportion of these tumours produce little PSA. This study demonstrates that among Gleason 8-10 prostate cancers, some of the worst survival outcomes are associated with the lowest PSA levels.  Objective:   • To assess outcomes of patients with Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer (CaP) with a low (≤ 2.5 ng/mL) vs higher preoperative serum PSA levels.  Patients and methods:   • From 1983 to 2003, 5544 patients underwent open radical prostatectomy, of whom 354 had a Gleason 8-10 tumour in the prostatectomy specimen. • Patients were stratified according to preoperative PSA level into four strata: ≤ 2.5 ng/mL (n= 31), 2.6-4 ng/mL (n= 31), 4.1-10 ng/mL (n= 174), and >10 ng/mL (n= 118). • We compared biochemical progression-free survival (PFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) as a function of preoperative PSA level.  Results:   • Patients with PSA level ≤ 2.5 ng/mL were more likely to have seminal vesicle invasion (P= 0.003). • On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with a PSA level ≤ 2.5 ng/mL had proportionately worse outcomes than their counterparts with higher PSA levels. • The 7-year PFS in the PSA ≤ 2.5 ng/mL stratum was lower than those of the PSA 2.6-4 ng/mL and 4-10 ng/mL strata (36% vs 50 and 42%, respectively); however, the lowest 7-year PFS was found in those with a PSA level >10 ng/mL (32%, P= 0.02). • Gleason score 8-10 tumours with a PSA level ≤ 2.5 ng/mL also tended to have the lowest 7-year MFS (75, 93, 89 and 92% for PSA level ≤ 2.5, 2.6-4, 4.1-10 and >10 ng/mL, respectively, P= 0.2) and CSS (81, 100, 94 and 90% for PSA level ≤ 2.5, 2.6-4, 4.1-10 and >10 ng/mL, respectively, P= 0.3), although these differences were not statistically significant. • In the subset with palpable disease, Gleason grade 8-10 disease with PSA level ≤ 2.5 ng/mL also was associated with a worse prognosis.  Conclusions:   • In patients with Gleason grade 8-10 disease, a proportion of these tumours are so poorly differentiated that they produce relatively little PSA. • Patients with high-grade, low-PSA tumours had less favourable outcomes than many of those with higher PSA levels.""","""['Barry B McGuire', 'Brian T Helfand', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Qiaoyan Hu', ""Daniel O'Brien"", 'Phillip Cooper', 'Ximing Yang', 'William J Catalona']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Invasion of seminal vesicles by adenocarcinoma of the prostate: PSA outcome determined by preoperative and postoperative factors.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Long-term biochemical disease-free and cancer-specific survival following anatomic radical retropubic prostatectomy.

Thus, it is assumed that serum TG plays an important role in carcinogenesis, and the key enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of plasma TG, may therefore be involved. Dysregulation of LPL has been reported to contribute to many human diseases, such as atherosclerosis, chylomicronaemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Recently, it has been reported that LPL gene deficiency, such as due to chromosome 8p22 loss, LPL gene polymorphism, and epigenetic changes in its promoter region gene, increases cancer risk, especially in the prostate. In animal experiments, high serum TG levels seem to promote sporadic/carcinogen-induced genesis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Interestingly, tumor suppressive effects of LPL inducers, such as PPAR ligands, NO-1886, and indomethacin, have been demonstrated in animal models.

ARLTS1 variants, especially Cys148Arg (T442C), increase susceptibility to different cancers, including PCa. In this study the role of Cys148Arg substitution was investigated as a risk factor for PCa using both genetic and functional analysis. Cys148Arg genotypes and expression of the ARLTS1 were explored in a large set of familial and unselected PCa cases, clinical tumor samples, xenografts, prostate cancer cell lines and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples. The frequency of the variant genotype CC was significantly higher in familial (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.08-2.56, P = 0.019) and unselected patients (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.18-1.97, P = 0.001) and the overall risk was increased (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.20-1.98, P = 0.0007). Additional analysis with clinicopathological data revealed an association with an aggressive disease (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.05-∞, P = 0.02). The CC genotype of the Cys148Arg variant was also contributing to the lowered ARLTS1 expression status in lymphoblastoid cells from familial patients. In addition significantly lowered ARLTS1 expression was observed in clinical tumor samples compared to BPH samples (P = 0.01). The ARLTS1 co-expression signature based on previously published microarray data was generated from 1587 cancer samples confirming the low expression of ARLTS1 in PCa and showed that ARLTS1 expression was strongly associated with immune processes.

In cancer studies, for example, data on copy number alterations indicate losses and amplifications of genomic regions in tumours, while transcriptomic data point to the impact of genomic and environmental events on the internal wiring of the cell. Fusing different data provides a more comprehensive model of the cancer cell than that offered by any single type. However, biological signals in different patients exhibit diverse degrees of concordance due to cancer heterogeneity and inherent noise in the measurements. This is a particularly important issue in cancer subtype discovery, where personalised strategies to guide therapy are of vital importance. We present a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering prognostic cancer subtypes by integrating gene expression and copy number variation data. Our model is constructed from a hierarchy of Dirichlet Processes and addresses three key challenges in data fusion: (i) To separate concordant from discordant signals, (ii) to select informative features, (iii) to estimate the number of disease subtypes. Concordance of signals is assessed individually for each patient, giving us an additional level of insight into the underlying disease structure. We exemplify the power of our model in prostate cancer and breast cancer and show that it outperforms competing methods. In the prostate cancer data, we identify an entirely new subtype with extremely poor survival outcome and show how other analyses fail to detect it. In the breast cancer data, we find subtypes with superior prognostic value by using the concordant results. These discoveries were crucially dependent on our model's ability to distinguish concordant and discordant signals within each patient sample, and would otherwise have been missed. We therefore demonstrate the importance of taking a patient-specific approach, using highly-flexible nonparametric Bayesian methods.""","""['Yinyin Yuan', 'Richard S Savage', 'Florian Markowetz']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['Breast and prostate cancers harbor common somatic copy number alterations that consistently differ by race and are associated with survival.', 'Genomic subtypes of breast cancer identified by array-comparative genomic hybridization display distinct molecular and clinical characteristics.', 'Micro-scale genomic DNA copy number aberrations as another means of mutagenesis in breast cancer.', 'Basal-like Breast cancer DNA copy number losses identify genes involved in genomic instability, response to therapy, and patient survival.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Applications of multi-omics analysis in human diseases.', 'A Drug Repurposing Pipeline Based on Bladder Cancer Integrated Proteotranscriptomics Signatures.', 'Statistical analysis of high-dimensional biomedical data: a gentle introduction to analytical goals, common approaches and challenges.', 'A data-fusion approach to identifying developmental dyslexia from multi-omics datasets.', 'A Machine Learning-Based Approach Using Multi-omics Data to Predict Metabolic Pathways.']"""

Currently, the molecule is in phase III development for second-line non-small cell lung cancer and first-line ovarian cancer patients.  Methods:   This phase I dose-escalation study assessed the safety and maximum tolerated dose of continuous daily treatment with BIBF 1120 plus standard-dose docetaxel (75 mg m(-2), every 3 weeks) and prednisone (5 mg BID) in patients with metastatic, chemo-naive, hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Secondary objectives were characterisation of BIBF 1120 and docetaxel pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary antitumour activity.  Results:   Patients received BIBF 1120 100 mg BID (n=3), 150 mg BID (n=3), 200 mg BID (n=3), and 250 mg BID (n=12). The most frequent drug-related adverse events were diarrhoea (71.4%), asthenia (61.9%), nausea (28.6%), vomiting (28.6%), and alopecia (23.8%). The maximum tolerated dose was 250 mg BID of BIBF 1120. Overall, reversible grade 3/4 liver enzyme elevations occurred in six of twelve patients at this dose level. Among 19 assessable patients, 13 (68.4%) showed a ≥50% reduction in prostate serum antigen levels from baseline and among 6 evaluable patients with measurable lesions 1 patient experienced a partial response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours criteria. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed no interactions between BIBF 1120 and docetaxel/prednisone.  Conclusion:   Based on the overall safety profile, 200 mg BID was the recommended dose for the combination of BIBF 1120 with the standard dose of 75 mg m(-2) of docetaxel and prednisone that might be further investigated in HRPC patients.

However, most patients eventually develop resistance to this treatment. In this study, we aimed to identify key molecular genes and networks associated with docetaxel resistance in two models of docetaxel-resistant CRPC cell lines and to test for the most differentially expressed genes in tumor samples from patients with CRPC. DU-145 and PC-3 cells were converted to docetaxel-resistant cells, DU-145R and PC-3R, respectively. Whole-genome arrays were used to compare global gene expression between these four cell lines. Results showed differential expression of 243 genes (P < 0.05, Bonferroni-adjusted P values and log ratio > 1.2) that were common to DU-145R and PC-3R cells. These genes were involved in cell processes like growth, development, death, proliferation, movement, and gene expression. Genes and networks commonly deregulated in both DU-145R and PC-3R cells were studied by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Exposing parental cells to TGFB1 increased their survival in the presence of docetaxel, suggesting a role of the TGF-β superfamily in conferring drug resistance. Changes in expression of 18 selected genes were validated by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in all four cell lines and tested in a set of 11 FFPE and five optimal cutting temperature tumor samples. Analysis in patients showed a noteworthy downexpression of CDH1 and IFIH1, among others, in docetaxel-resistant tumors.

Although androgen deprivation therapies are effective initially for the treatment of prostate cancer, the disease eventually relapses and progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Nonetheless, the AR still plays a critical role because late-stage investigational agents that deplete testosterone (abiraterone) or block ligand binding (MDV3100) can still control tumor growth in patients with CRPC. These findings indicate that downmodulation of AR expression may provide a complementary strategy for treating CRPC. In this article, we describe a novel, locked, nucleic acid-based antisense oligonucleotide, designated EZN-4176. When administered as a single agent, EZN-4176 specifically downmodulated AR mRNA and protein, and this was coordinated with inhibition of the growth of both androgen-sensitive and CRPC tumors in vitro as well as in animal models. The effect was specific because no effect on growth was observed with a control antisense oligonucleotide that does not recognize AR mRNA, nor on tumors derived from the PC3, AR-negative, tumor cell line. In addition, EZN-4176 reduced AR luciferase reporter activity in a CRPC model derived from C4-2b cells that were implanted intratibially, indicating that the molecule may control prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone.

The aim of the paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the robotic surgery versus traditional surgery for the treatment of early prostate cancer in Italy.  Methods:   Since this study is an observational study, we have no control over the treatment assignment. However, the treated (patient who undergo robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP)) and control groups (patient who undergo open radical prostatectomy (ORP)) may differ significantly prior to treatment in ways that may affect the outcomes under study. In order to avoid erroneous conclusions we have dealt with the problem of significant group differences by using a propensity score matching procedure.  Results:   The average age at radical prostatectomy for the two groups was similar. 97% of patients have bladder neck sparing during the open prostatectomy versus 77% of patients who belong to RALP group. RALP group presents higher urinary continence and lower blood loss rate with respect to ORP group (86.3% versus 65.6% and 9% versus 31.1% respectively). Among patients who underwent ORP 20.4% were spared nerves versus 4.5% of patients who were treated with RALP. The body mass and self-assessed health for the two groups were similar. In the logistic regression model used for the calculation of Propensity Score, bladder neck sparing and the size of the tumor were significant and presented a negative coefficient. Older age, advanced stage of the tumor, and linfonodal involvement negatively affect the likelihood of robotic technology. From our empirical analysis it arises that the robot technique does not significantly affect the hospital stay, blood loss nor the variables about post-intervention quality of life (urinary continence and self-assessed health).  Conclusions:   The robotic system does not seem to present major efficacy with respect to open radical prostatectomy.

The use of a new ionic liquid narrow bore column, as well as the automation and miniaturization of the preparation procedure by a customized configuration of the utilized XYZ robotic system, allowed a friendly use of the GC apparatus achieving a quantitation limit of 0.06 μg L(-1) for sarcosine, good repeatability with CV always lower than 7% and reduced analysis times useful for point-of-care testing. The method was then applied for the analysis of 56 samples of urine and urinary sediments in healthy subjects, in those with benign prostatic hypertrophy and in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. The results obtained showed that the medians of sarcosine/creatinine in urine were 103, 137 and 267 μg g(-1) respectively, thus assessing the potential use of sarcosine as urinary biomarker for prostate cancer detection. The highest values of sensitivity (79%) and specificity (87%) were obtained in correspondence of a cut-off value of 179 μg sarcosine(g creatinine)(-1), thus by using this cut-off threshold, sarcosine was significantly associated with the presence of cancer (p<0.0001).

However, the mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, which differ dramatically from normal cells in their zinc handling ability. Here, we studied the effects of the ionophore Zn-pyrithione (ZP) and the chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN). Both compounds induced cell death at micromolar concentrations when incubated with androgen-dependent (LNCaP), androgen-independent (PC3, DU145) and androgen-sensitive (C4-2) PCa cell-lines. Compared to PCa cells, RWPE1 prostate epithelial cells were less sensitive to ZP and more sensitive to TPEN, but total cellular zinc levels were changed similarly. ZnSO4 enhanced the toxicity of ZP, but inhibited the effects of TPEN as expected. The morphological/biochemical responses to ZP and TPEN differed. ZP decreased ATP levels and stimulated ERK, AKT and PKC phosphorylation. DNA laddering was observed only at low doses of ZP but all doses of TPEN. TPEN activated caspase 3/7 and induced PARP-cleavage, DNA-fragmentation, ROS-formation and apoptotic bodies. PKC and ERK-pathway inhibitors, and antioxidants protected against ZP-induced but not TPEN-induced death. Inhibitors of MPTP-opening protected both. Cell death in response to TPEN (but not ZP) was diminished by a calpain inhibitor and largely prevented by a caspase 3 inhibitor. Overall, the results indicated primarily a necrotic cell death for ZP and an apoptotic cell death for TPEN. The enhanced sensitivity of PCa cells to ZP and the apparent ability of ZP and TPEN to kill quiescent and rapidly dividing cells in a p53-independent manner suggest that ZP/TPEN might be used to develop adjunct treatments for PCa.""","""['Robert E Carraway', 'Paul R Dobner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Synthesis and initial in vitro biological evaluation of two new zinc-chelating compounds: comparison with TPEN and PAC-1.', 'Role of cellular zinc in programmed cell death: temporal relationship between zinc depletion, activation of caspases, and cleavage of Sp family transcription factors.', 'Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS) and protection against peroxynitrite-induced cytotoxicity by zinc chelation.', 'Role of intracellular zinc in programmed cell death.', 'TPEN, a Zn2+/Fe2+ chelator with low affinity for Ca2+, inhibits lamin assembly, destabilizes nuclear architecture and may independently protect nuclei from apoptosis in vitro.', 'Zn 2+ is Essential for Ca 2+ Oscillations in Mouse Eggs.', 'Intracellular Zinc Trafficking during Crotalus atrox Venom Wound Development.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Restoration of the GTPase activity and cellular interactions of Gαo mutants by Zn2+ in GNAO1 encephalopathy models.', 'Organelle-Level Labile Zn2+ Mapping Based on Targetable Fluorescent Sensors.']"""

The aim of this study is to explore patient-, general practitioner (GP)- and system-related delay in the interval from first cancer symptom to diagnosis and treatment, and to analyse the extent to which delays differ by cancer type.  Methods:   Population-based cohort study conducted in 2004-05 in the County of Aarhus, Denmark (640,000 inhabitants). Data were collected from administrative registries and questionnaires completed by GPs on 2,212 cancer patients newly diagnosed during a 1-year period. Median delay (in days) with interquartile interval (IQI) was the main outcome measure.  Results:   Median total delay was 98 days (IQI 57-168). Most of the total delay stemmed from patient (median 21 days (7-56)) and system delay (median 55 days (32-93)). Median GP delay was 0 (0-2) days. Total delay was shortest among patients with ovarian (median 60 days (45-112)) and breast cancer (median 65 days (39-106)) and longest among patients with prostate (median 130 days (89-254)) and bladder cancer (median 134 days (93-181)).  Conclusion:   System delay accounted for a substantial part of the total delay experienced by cancer patients. This points to a need for shortening clinical pathways if possible. A long patient delay calls for research into patient awareness of cancer. For all delay components, special focus should be given to the 4th quartile of patients with the longest time intervals and we need research into the quality of the diagnostic work-up process. We found large variations in delay for different types of cancer. Improvements should therefore target both the population at large and the specific needs associated with individual cancer types and their symptoms.""","""['Rikke P Hansen', 'Peter Vedsted', 'Ineta Sokolowski', 'Jens Søndergaard', 'Frede Olesen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['General practitioner characteristics and delay in cancer diagnosis. a population-based cohort study.', 'Cancer diagnostic delays and travel distance to health services: A nationwide cohort study in Denmark.', 'Socioeconomic patient characteristics predict delay in cancer diagnosis: a Danish cohort study.', 'Ovarian cancer suspicion, urgent referral and time to diagnosis in Danish general practice: a population-based study.', 'The effect of direct referral for fast CT scan in early lung cancer detection in general practice.

Here, we report the discovery of functional relationship between GLIPR1 and c-Myc in prostate cancer where c-Myc is often upregulated. We found that the expression of GLIPR1 and c-Myc were inversely correlated in human prostate cancer. Restoration of GLIPR1 expression in prostate cancer cells downregulated c-myc levels, inhibiting cell-cycle progression. Downregulation was linked to a reduction in β-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcription of the c-myc gene, which was caused by GLIPR1-mediated redistribution of casein kinase 1α (CK1α) from the Golgi apparatus to the cytoplasm where CK1α could phosphorylate β-catenin and mediate its destruction. In parallel, GLIPR1 also promoted c-Myc protein ubiquitination and degradation by glycogen synthase kinase-3α- and/or CK1α-mediated c-Myc phosphorylation. Notably, genetic ablation of the mouse homolog of Glipr1 cooperated with c-myc overexpression to induce prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer. Together, our findings provide evidence for CK1α-mediated destruction of c-Myc and identify c-Myc S252 as a crucial CK1α phosphorylation site for c-Myc degradation. Furthermore, they reveal parallel mechanisms of c-myc downregulation by GLIPR1 that when ablated in the prostate are sufficient to drive c-Myc expression and malignant development.""","""['Likun Li', 'Chengzhen Ren', 'Guang Yang', 'Elmoataz Abdel Fattah', 'Alexei A Goltsov', 'Soo Mi Kim', 'Ju-Seog Lee', 'Sanghee Park', 'Francesco J Demayo', 'Michael M Ittmann', 'Patricia Troncoso', 'Timothy C Thompson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 performs dual functions in tumor cells.', 'Systemic GLIPR1-ΔTM protein as a novel therapeutic approach for prostate cancer.', 'Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 induces prostate cancer cell death through Hsc70-mediated suppression of AURKA and TPX2.', 'GLIPR1-ΔTM synergizes with docetaxel in cell death and suppresses resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer cells.', 'Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1: tumor-suppressor activities and therapeutic potential.', 'Casein Kinase 1α as a Novel Factor Affects Thyrotropin Synthesis via PKC/ERK/CREB Signaling.', 'Expression and Genetic Effects of GLI Pathogenesis-Related 1 Gene on Backfat Thickness in Pigs.', 'GLIPR1 promotes proliferation, metastasis and 5-fluorouracil resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma by activating the PI3K/PDK1/ROCK1 pathway.', 'Key genes and drug delivery systems to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy.', 'Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 performs dual functions in tumor cells.']"""

Increased phosphorylation of choline is a hallmark characteristic of the malignant phenotype in a variety of neoplasms. However, in hypoxic cancer cells, choline phosphorylation is decreased. To understand the mechanism behind this altered metabolic state, we examined the expression and regulation of the major choline kinase isoform, choline kinase α (ChKα), in hypoxic PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. Hypoxia decreased choline phosphorylation, choline kinase activity, and ChKα mRNA and protein levels. Promoter analysis studies revealed a region upstream of the ChKα gene bearing a conserved DNA consensus binding motif, hypoxia response element-7 (HRE7), at position -222 relative to +1 translation start site, for binding the hypoxia dependent master regulator transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Electrophoretic mobility shift competition/supershift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed binding of HIF-1α to HRE7. A putative promoter of ChKα was isolated from PC-3 genomic DNA and cloned into a luciferase-based reporter vector system. In PC-3 cells, hypoxia decreased the expression of luciferase under the control of the ChKα promoter. Mutation of HRE7 abrogated this hypoxia effect, further demonstrating the involvement of HRE7 in hypoxia-sensitive regulation of ChKα.

Obesity has been associated with increased risk for advanced disease and biochemical failure after treatment. This association may be the result of changes in androgen metabolism that occur with obesity and are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR).  Methods:   To evaluate the effects of obesity and AR polymorphisms on biochemical failure, we conducted a study of 536 Caucasian prostate cancer cases. We determined the relationship between time to biochemical failure and obesity stratified by short and long AR-CAG and AR-GGN repeat sequence. The AR repeat groups were dichotomized at the median number of repeats for each polymorphism.  Results:   An association was found for obesity in the short CAG group (HR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.00-11.96). Among obese patients diagnosed with localized disease (T1/T2), the risk of biochemical failure was significantly higher (HR = 7.05, 95% CI = 1.55-32.06). No difference was observed for high stage (T3/T4) obese patients. Additionally, no differences in biochemical failure were observed in obese and non-obese men grouped by number of AR-GGN repeats.  Conclusions:   Obesity is significantly associated with increased risk of biochemical failure in men with the high-risk short CAG sequence on the AR gene. This effect is not observed in men with long CAG repeats. Therefore, it appears that the relationship between biochemical failure and obesity may be modified by the AR-CAG repeat pattern.

In the present study, we demonstrate that serum Cyr61 is a potential biomarker that correlates with PCa aggressiveness. Furthermore, we also explore the potential mechanism underlying the changes in Cyr61 expression during PCa progression.  Methods:   Cyr61 concentrations in the medium from PCa cell lines and in serum samples obtained from PCa patients were measured by sandwich ELISA. Serum Cyr61 levels were correlated with disease characteristics and the association between Cyr61 expression changes by several types of stimulation or stress and cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway were examined.  Results:   There was a positive correlation between Cyr61 levels in cell supernatants and mRNA expression in these cell lines.

Cyr61 expression was up-regulated in response to both lysophosphatidic acid and androgen treatments which promoted PCa cell invasion. Serum starvation and phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibition also resulted in Cyr61 up-regulation; however, they suppressed cell proliferation. Cyr61 up-regulation was correlated with an increase in cAMP and suppressed by PKA inhibition.

Recent work has shown that prostate cancer cells can acquire steroidogenic activity as they progress to a therapeutic-resistant state. However, benign prostate stromal cells (PrSCs) also have steroidogenic potential though they are often overlooked as a source of intratumoral androgens. Here, we present preliminary studies showing that the steroidogenic activity of primary human PrSCs is significantly increased by exposure to a Hedgehog agonist (SAG) or by transduction of PrSCs with lentiviruses that expresses active Gli2 (Gli2ΔN), a transcription factor that is triggered by Hh signaling. Comparative gene expression profiling on Chips, that was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR, revealed that hedgehog agonist treatment induced in these cells expressions of hedgehog target genes (Gli1, Ptch1, and SCUBE1) plus a specific cadre of genes involved in cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis, metabolism, and transport. Genes involved downstream in steroid hormone generation, including CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 were also induced. Both the hedgehog agonist and the Gli2-expressing lentivirus significantly increased the output of testosterone (T) from PrSCs that were supplemented with dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an adrenal precursor of T. Finally, knockdown of Gli2 by siRNA suppressed the ability of SAG to induce this response.

Methods:   RECK protein levels were determined by Western blotting in the human prostate cell lines BPH-1, DU-145, LNCaP, PC-3, and in tissue of 12 normal/tumor matches of patients after radical prostatectomy. Functional characteristics of DU-145 cells with stable RECK overexpression included proliferation, invasion, regulation of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14 measured by zymography (MMP-2 and -9) or commercially available assays.  Results:   RECK was expressed in cell lines and tissue with a significant decrease in malignant tissue (P = 0.002). RECK overexpression caused an up to 80% decrease in invasion for DU-145 cells (P < 0.001) and a decrease of pro-MMP-9 (42%) and of pro-/active MMP-14 (up to 53% of control).

The precise molecular abnormalities in prostatic atrophy compared to high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and carcinoma have not been fully defined.  Methods:   We utilized laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis to characterize cells of PIA, HGPIN, invasive prostatic carcinoma, and non-atrophic benign prostatic epithelium (NABE). Cytoglobin was selected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) validation. IHC stains were evaluated for proportion of positive glands, and intensity of cytoglobin staining. An immunoreactive score (IR score) was determined as the product of the percentage of positive staining and intensity.  Results:   Microarray analysis revealed probe sets that separated the microdissected cell types. Several genes showed overlapping expression patterns between PIA and PIN, and HGPIN and invasive carcinoma. Cytoglobin protein expression was detected in 57/93 (61%) of NABE and BPH cases, 92/93 atrophy (99%), 3/34 (9%) of PIN, and 23/61 carcinoma (37%) samples. The highest IHC scores were calculated for atrophy foci. A subset (33%) of atrophy cases showed the same low-cytoglobin expression level as PIN and carcinoma.  Conclusions:   Prostatic epithelium can be stratified into normal, atrophic, PIN, and invasive carcinoma categories based on differential genetic signatures. Cytoglobin, a protein that can be induced in response to oxidative stress, was elevated in most atrophy foci, suggesting hypoxic, and/or oxidative damage. The lower level of cytoglobin seen in neoplastic cells and 33% of atrophy foci may indicate a shared susceptibility to oxidative damage for this subset of atrophy cases and prostatic neoplasia.""","""['Ashish P Mogal', 'Mark A Watson', 'Fatih Ozsolak', 'Lorena Salavaggione', 'Peter A Humphrey']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Decreased NKX3.1 protein expression in focal prostatic atrophy, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and adenocarcinoma: association with gleason score and chromosome 8p deletion.', 'Morphological transition of proliferative inflammatory atrophy to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer in human prostate.', 'Amphiregulin expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma: a study of 93 cases.', 'Apoptotic regulators in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN): value in prostate cancer detection and prevention.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', ""Changes in mitochondrial stability during the progression of the Barrett's esophagus disease sequence."", 'Cytoglobin as a Marker of Hepatic Stellate Cell-derived Myofibroblasts.', 'Prognostic value of discs large homolog 7 transcript levels in prostate cancer.']"""

Human CaP cell lines frequently have nuclear lobulations, which are enriched in A-type lamins but lack B-type lamins and have been defined as lamin B-deficient microdomains (LDMDs). LDMD frequency is correlated with CaP cell line aggressiveness and increased cell motility. In addition, LNCaP cells grown in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) show an increased frequency of LDMDs. The LDMDs are enriched in activated RNA polymerase II (Pol IIo) and androgen receptor (AR) and A-type lamins form an enlarged meshwork that appears to co-align with chromatin fibres and AR. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization and comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated that chromosomal regions associated with CaP susceptibility are preferentially localized to LDMDs. Surprisingly, these regions lack histone marks for transcript elongation and exhibit reduced BrU incorporation, suggesting that Pol II is stalled within LDMDs. Real-time PCR of genes near androgen response elements (AREs) was used to compare transcription between cells containing LDMDs and controls. Genes preferentially localized to LDMDs showed significantly decreased expression, while genes in the main nuclear body were largely unaffected. Furthermore, LDMDs were observed in human CaP tissue and the frequency was correlated with increased Gleason grade.

MRP with robotic assistance is generally more expensive than ORP, but it is not clear whether subsequent costs of care vary by approach.  Methods:   In the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry linked with Medicare claims, men aged 66 years or older who received MRP or ORP in 2003 through 2006 for prostate cancer were identified. Total cost of care was estimated as the sum of Medicare payments from all claims for hospital care, outpatient care, physician services, home health and hospice care, and durable medical equipment in the first year from the date of surgical admission. The impact of surgical approach on costs was estimated, controlling for patient and disease characteristics.  Results:   Of 5445 surgically treated prostate cancer patients, 4454 (82%) had ORP and 991 (18%) had MRP. Mean total first-year costs were more than $1200 greater for MRP compared with ORP ($16,919 vs $15,692; P = .08). Controlling for patient and disease characteristics, MRP was associated with 2% greater mean total payments, but this difference was not statistically significant. First-year costs were greater for men who were older, black, lived in the Northeast, had lymph node involvement, more advanced tumor stage, or greater comorbidity.

Standardized incidence rates (SIRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated for comparison.  Results:   A total of 223 patients were diagnosed with SPC, 136 (11%) after brachytherapy and 87 (12%) after prostatectomy, with a median follow-up of 7.5 years. The SIR for all malignancies, bladder cancer, and rectal cancer were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.12), 1.69 (95% CI, 0.98 to 2.70), and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.41 to 1.72) for brachytherapy and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.83 to 2.28), 1.82 (95% CI, 0.87 to 3.35), and 1.50 (95% CI, 0.68 to 2.85) for prostatectomy, respectively. Bladder SPC risk was significantly increased after brachytherapy for patients age 60 years or younger (SIR, 5.84; 95% CI, 2.14 to 12.71; AER, 24.03) and in the first 4 years of follow-up (SIR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.94; AER, 12.24). Adjusted for age, the hazard ratio (brachytherapy v prostatectomy) for all SPCs combined was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.64 to 1.18).  Conclusion:   Overall, we found no difference in SPC incidence between patients with prostate cancer treated with prostatectomy or brachytherapy. Furthermore, no increased tumor incidence was found compared with the general population. We observed a higher than expected incidence of bladder SPC after brachytherapy in the first 4 years of follow-up, probably resulting from lead time or screening bias.

Androgen-independent prostate cancers have been shown to harbor Bcl-2 gene copy number gains frequently suggesting that this genetic alteration might play a role in Bcl-2 overexpression. The relation of Bcl-2 overexpression and copy number gains or translocation of the BCL-2 gene in prostate cancer under hormone-naïve conditions is unknown.  Methods:   Prostate cancers of 3,261 hormone-naïve patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were arrayed in a TMA with one tissue core (diameter 0.6 mm) per tumor. Bcl-2 immunohistochemistry, analyzed for Bcl-2 expression level (negative, low, and high), was correlated with clinical, histopathological and molecular (Ki67, p53) tumor features, and biochemical failure. Cancers with high-level Bcl-2 expression were evaluated for genetic aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  Results:   Bcl-2 expression was significantly up-regulated in tumors with aggressive phenotype as indicated by high Gleason score (P < 0.0001), advanced stage (P < 0.0001), and high proliferation index (P = 0.0114). The different Bcl-2 expression levels translated into significantly different survival curves showing better outcome for patients with lower Bcl-2 levels. The prognostic information obtained from the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 was independent from the proliferation index (Ki67) of the cancer. FISH analysis detected no copy number gains or translocation of the Bcl-2 gene.  Conclusion:   Bcl-2 overexpression in prostate cancers under hormone-naïve conditions is not associated with increased copy numbers of the gene.

Soy products are able to affect PSA kinetics in some men with prostate cancer, and this effect has been attributed to the decreased expression of the androgen receptor and other mechanisms.  Methods:   We treated 10 men with rising PSA levels after radical prostatectomy and salvage radiotherapy with commercially available soy products. Scans revealed no gross metastatic disease. Three men also had been receiving androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and had rising PSA levels that were consistent with castration-resistant (CR) disease. We reported the results of this modality on PSA levels, PSA kinetics, and the duration of PSA response.  Results:   Responses occurred in 4 of 7 (57%) patients with ADT-naïve disease and 1 of 3 (33%) patients with CR disease. The median duration of treatment response was 24 months. The overall clinical benefit, therefore, was noted in 5 of 10 (50%) patients. Therapy was well tolerated.  Conclusions:   Our findings are fairly congruent with what has been described in the literature on the use of this modality in prostate cancer. We used commercially available soy products.

Contrary to observations in cancer, the generation of sE-cad appears to correlate with ADAM10 activity in benign prostatic epithelium. The ADAM10-specific inhibitor INCB8765 and the ADAM10 prodomain inhibit the generation of sE-cad, as well as downstream signaling and cell proliferation. Addition of EGF or amphiregulin (AREG) to these untransformed cell lines increases the amount of sE-cad shed into the conditioned media, as well as sE-cad bound to EGFR. EGF-associated shedding appears to be mediated by ADAM10 as shRNA knockdown of ADAM10 results in reduced shedding of sE-cad. To examine the physiologic role of sE-cad on benign prostatic epithelium, we treated BPH-1 and large T immortalized prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) with an sE-cad chimera comprised of the human Fc domain of IgG(1), fused to the extracellular domains of E-cadherin (Fc-Ecad). The treatment of untransformed prostate epithelial cells with Fc-Ecad resulted in phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream signaling through ERK and increased cell proliferation. Pre-treating BPH-1 and PrEC cells with cetuximab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody against EGFR, decreased the ability of Fc-Ecad to induce EGFR phosphorylation, downstream signaling, and proliferation.

The prostate bed's daily total error shifts were evaluated for a total of 661 CT scans.  Results:   In the right-left, cranial-caudal, and posterior-anterior directions, 11.5%, 9.2%, and 6.5% of the 661 scans required no position adjustments; 75.3%, 66.1%, and 56.8% required a shift of 1 - 5 mm; 11.5%, 20.9%, and 31.2% required a shift of 6 - 10 mm; and 1.7%, 3.8%, and 5.5% required a shift of more than 10 mm, respectively.

Evidence indicates that COX-2 plays a role in carcinogenesis and that it is overexpressed in prostate tumors. We examined whether sequence variants in the COX-2 gene were associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk.  Methods:   In a hospital-based case/control study, 195 subjects with PCa and 250 healthy controls were investigated for the association of COX-2 -765 G>C (rs20417) and +8473 T>C (rs5275) promoter polymorphism with PCa susceptibility using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.  Result:   Variant allele 'C' carriers of COX-2 -765 G>C polymorphism were associated with a 1.7-fold increased risk for PCa (p = 0.016; OR = 1.74). The variant genotype CC of COX-2 +8473 T>C polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with the overall higher risk of PCa (p = 0.045; OR = 1.82). Combined genotype (TC + CC) also demonstrated a 1.5-fold significant risk with PCa (p = 0.040; OR = 1.52). The diplotype C-C was observed to be associated with a significant increase in PCa risk (Bonferroni corrected p value, Pc = 0.004; OR = 4.26). Stratification of cases based on clinical pathological grade of tumors revealed no association with PCa risk.

Although results have been conflicting, the potential of XMRV as an infectious human retrovirus has raised concerns about transfusion safety. To address this issue, normal and retrovirus-infected blood donors were screened for evidence of XMRV infection.  Study design and methods:   Plasma from 1000 US, 100 human immunodeficiency virus Type 1-infected Cameroonian, and 642 human T-lymphotropic virus Type I (HTLV-I)-infected or uninfected Japanese blood donors as well as 311 sexually transmitted disease diagnostic specimens were screened for antibodies to XMRV gp70 and p15E using chemiluminescent immunoassays (CMIAs). CMIA-reactive samples were evaluated by p30 CMIA, Western blot, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   XMRV seroreactivity was low (0%-0.6%) with the exception of the HTLV-I-infected donors (4.9%). Antibody was detected against only a single XMRV protein (p15E or gp70); none of the seroreactive samples had detectable XMRV pol or env sequences. The elevated seroreactivity in HTLV-I-infected donors was due to an increased p15E seroreactive rate (4.1%). Inspection of XMRV and HTLV sequences revealed a high level of conservation within the immunodominant region (IDR) of the transmembrane protein. In some cases, HTLV IDR peptide competitively reduced the XMRV p15E signal.  Conclusions:   Based on the low prevalence of seroreactivity, detection of antibody to only a single XMRV protein and the absence of XMRV sequences, this study finds no compelling evidence of XMRV in normal or retrovirus-infected blood donors. The increased p15E seroreactivity observed in HTLV infection is likely due to cross-reactive antibodies.""","""['Xiaoxing Qiu', 'Priscilla Swanson', 'Ning Tang', 'Gregor W Leckie', 'Sushil G Devare', 'Gerald Schochetman', 'John Hackett Jr']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Transfusion""","""['Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-Related Virus (XMRV) and the Safety of the Blood Supply.', 'Prevalence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus infection in different risk populations in Spain.', 'Absence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in blood donors in China.', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus does not pose a risk to blood recipient safety.', 'Distribution of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) infection in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-Related Virus (XMRV) and the Safety of the Blood Supply.', 'The saga of XMRV: a virus that infects human cells but is not a human virus.', 'The perils of pathogen discovery: origin of a novel parvovirus-like hybrid genome traced to nucleic acid extraction spin columns.', 'No evidence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus transmission by blood transfusion from infected rhesus macaques.', 'In-depth investigation of archival and prospectively collected samples reveals no evidence for XMRV infection in prostate cancer.']"""

The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell. Furthermore, an interactive table view is integrated which summarizes unique fluorescence patterns.

Study design:   A total of 920 core needle biopsy specimens of the prostate were stained with H & E and when necessary immunohistochemical analyses were performed with basal cell markers p63, 34ßE12, PSA and AMACR (P504 S) and neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin. The modified Gleason grading system was used.  Results:   In 43.5% of suspicious lesions adenocarcinomas of the prostate were found. In 53.2% the findings of atypical small acinar proliferations or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) were confirmed with a recommendation of serum PSA and morphological controls. The suspicion of prostatic carcinoma could be confirmed in 87.2% by the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. After Gleason grading 82.8% of all diagnosed carcinomas had scores 6 or 7(3 + 4) and belonged to the group of low grade carcinomas. High grade carcinomas were without diagnostic problems.

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified susceptibility loci shared by many types of cancer. Yet, a population level search for shared susceptibility between discordant cancers has been hampered because of lacking population sizes.  Methods:   Over 1.1million patients in the nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database were analysed for discordant familial cancers covering 33 sites. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for patients whose family members had a defined cancer compared to those whose family members did not have that cancer. Three independent tests for each pair of cancer sites were done using different family relationships.  Results:   Lung cancer showed 13 significant discordant associations but most of them were with sites for which smoking is a risk factor. An exception was the clustering of lung cancer and endocrine cancers. Four discordant associations reached a minimal significance level of 5×10(-6): colorectum-endometrium, breast-ovary, breast-prostate and melanoma-squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The association of melanoma and nervous system cancer reached a minimal significance of 10(-4). Discarding lung cancer, all other associations were based on a single test whereby they were liable to be chance associations.  Conclusions:   This study showed the extraordinary requirements for statistical power in study of multiple cancer sites. In addition to the smoking related sites, associations between breast and prostate cancers, melanoma and nervous system tumours and lung and endocrine tumours found strong statistical support.

Methods:   Rates estimated from smooth function age-period-cohort modelling of cancer incidence data from Great Britain 1975 to 2007 are extrapolated to 2030 and applied to UK population projections. Prostate and breast cancer projections take into account the effect of screening.  Results:   Overall rates of cancer are projected to be stable over the next 20 years, but this masks individual changes. In both sexes, age-standardised rates of cancers of the stomach, larynx, bladder and leukaemia are projected to fall by ≥1% per year, whereas cancers of the lip, mouth and pharynx (ICD-10 C00-C14) and melanoma are projected to increase by ≥1% per year. The growing and aging populations will have a substantial impact: numbers of cancers in men and women are projected to increase by 55% (from 149,169 to 231,026) and 35% (from 148,716 to 200,929), respectively, between 2007 and 2030.

Objective:   To discuss our experience with VC and to recommend guidelines for its detection.  Design:   One thousand seven hundred forty-one radical prostatectomy specimens (2004-2009) processed by whole-mount section procedure yielded 21 (1.2%) cases with VC and 6 (0.34%) cases with minimal carcinoma (≤ 2 mm) in the radical prostatectomy specimen. To find the eluding carcinoma in VC cases or more carcinoma in minimal carcinoma cases, the following was done: 3 levels of all the paraffin blocks were obtained; if negative, the paraffin blocks were melted, the tissue was flipped, and 3 levels were prepared. The tumor bank frozen tissue was also processed for routine examination.  Results:   Three deeper levels in the radical prostatectomy specimen of 21 VC cases failed to show malignancy; however, the flipping and recutting of the tissue yielded a focus of carcinoma (1-5 mm) in 16 of 21 cases and in 3 of 16 cases in the saved frozen tissue. In 1 of the 6 cases with minimal carcinoma, subsequent recuts of the flipped tissue displayed carcinoma (2 foci of tumor, <1 mm each).  Conclusions:   In VC we recommend: embed and process any remaining prostatic tissue including any saved fresh-frozen tissue; obtain 3 levels of each paraffin block; if results are negative, melt and flip the tissue and obtain 3 more levels.

Our groups recently showed that XMRV was created through recombination between two endogenous murine retroviruses, PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2, during the passaging of a prostate tumor xenograft in nude mice. Here, multiple approaches that led to the identification of PreXMRV-2, as well as the distribution of both parental proviruses among different mouse species, are described. The chromosomal loci of both proviruses were determined in the mouse genome, and integration site information was used to analyze the distribution of both proviruses in 48 laboratory mouse strains and 46 wild-derived strains. The strain distributions of PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2 are quite different, the former being found predominantly in Asian mice and the latter in European mice, making it unlikely that the two XMRV ancestors could have recombined independently in the wild to generate an infectious virus. XMRV was not present in any of the mouse strains tested, and among the wild-derived mouse strains analyzed, not a single mouse carried both parental proviruses. Interestingly, PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2 were found together in three laboratory strains, Hsd nude, NU/NU, and C57BR/cd, consistent with previous data that the recombination event that led to the generation of XMRV could have occurred only in the laboratory. The three laboratory strains carried the Xpr1(n) receptor variant nonpermissive to XMRV and xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV) infection, suggesting that the xenografted human tumor cells were required for the resulting XMRV recombinant to infect and propagate.""","""['Oya Cingöz', 'Tobias Paprotka', 'Krista A Delviks-Frankenberry', 'Sheryl Wildt', 'Wei-Shau Hu', 'Vinay K Pathak', 'John M Coffin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['Recombinant origin of the retrovirus XMRV.', 'Generation of multiple replication-competent retroviruses through recombination between PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2.', 'Evolution of functional and sequence variants of the mammalian XPR1 receptor for mouse xenotropic gammaretroviruses and the human-derived retrovirus XMRV.', 'Recombinant origin, contamination, and de-discovery of XMRV.', 'Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-Related Virus (XMRV) and the Safety of the Blood Supply.', 'Viral Interactions with Adaptor-Protein Complexes: A Ubiquitous Trait among Viral Species.', 'Fake Science: XMRV, COVID-19, and the Toxic Legacy of Dr. Judy Mikovits.', 'High-Throughput Sequence Analysis of Peripheral T-Cell Lymphomas Indicates Subtype-Specific Viral Gene Expression Patterns and Immune Cell Microenvironments.', 'XMRV and Public Health: The Retroviral Genome Is Not a Suitable Template for Diagnostic PCR, and Its Association with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Appears Unreliable.', 'A computational method for prediction of matrix proteins in endogenous retroviruses.']"""

Diagnostic follow-up of positive screening results was determined by participants and their health care practitioners. Participants in the usual care group were offered no interventions and received their usual medical care. All diagnosed cancers, deaths, and causes of death were ascertained through the earlier of 13 years of follow-up or until December 31, 2009.  Main outcome measures:   Mortality from lung cancer. Secondary outcomes included lung cancer incidence, complications associated with diagnostic procedures, and all-cause mortality.  Results:   Screening adherence was 86.6% at baseline and 79% to 84% at years 1 through 3; the rate of screening use in the usual care group was 11%. Cumulative lung cancer incidence rates through 13 years of follow-up were 20.1 per 10,000 person-years in the intervention group and 19.2 per 10,000 person-years in the usual care group (rate ratio [RR]; 1.05, 95% CI, 0.98-1.12). A total of 1213 lung cancer deaths were observed in the intervention group compared with 1230 in usual care group through 13 years (mortality RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87-1.22). Stage and histology were similar between the 2 groups. The RR of mortality for the subset of participants eligible for the NLST, over the same 6-year follow-up period, was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.81-1.10).

Here, we assess the dependency of prostate epithelium DDR on ATM and DNA-PKcs, the major kinases responsible for damage detection and repair by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), respectively. DNA damage was caused by ionizing radiation (IR) and cytotoxic drugs, cultured tissues were treated with ATM and DNA-PK inhibitors, and DDR was assessed by phosphorylation of ATM and its targets H2AX and KAP1, a heterochromatin binding protein. Phosphorylation of H2AX and KAP1 was fast, transient and fully dependent on ATM, but these responses were moderate in luminal cells. In contrast, DNA-PKcs was phosphorylated in both luminal and basal cells, suggesting that DNA-PK-dependent repair was also activated in the luminal cells despite the diminished H2AX and KAP1 responses. These results indicate that prostate epithelial cell types have constitutively dissimilar responses to DNA damage. We correlate the altered damage response to the differential chromatin state of the cells.

Intriguingly, caveolin-1 is also secreted from prostate cancer cell lines and has been identified in secreted prostasomes. Caveolin-1 is the major structural component of the plasma membrane invaginations called caveolae. Co-expression of the coat protein Polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF) is required for caveolae formation. We recently found that expression of caveolin-1 in the aggressive prostate cancer cell line PC-3 is not accompanied by PTRF, leading to noncaveolar caveolin-1 lipid rafts. Moreover, ectopic expression of PTRF in PC-3 cells sequesters caveolin-1 into caveolae. Here we quantitatively analyzed the effect of PTRF expression on the PC-3 proteome using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in culture and subcellular proteomics. We show that PTRF reduced the secretion of a subset of proteins including secreted proteases, cytokines, and growth regulatory proteins, partly via a reduction in prostasome secretion. To determine the cellular mechanism accounting for the observed reduction in secreted proteins we analyzed total membrane and the detergent-resistant membrane fractions. Our data show that PTRF expression selectively impaired the recruitment of actin cytoskeletal proteins to the detergent-resistant membrane, which correlated with altered cholesterol distribution in PC-3 cells expressing PTRF. Consistent with this, modulating cellular cholesterol altered the actin cytoskeleton and protein secretion in PC-3 cells. Intriguingly, several proteins that function in ER to Golgi trafficking were reduced by PTRF expression. Taken together, these results suggest that the noncaveolar caveolin-1 found in prostate cancer cells generates a lipid raft microenvironment that accentuates secretion pathways, possibly at the step of ER sorting/exit. Importantly, these effects could be modulated by PTRF expression.""","""['Kerry L Inder', 'Yu Zi Zheng', 'Melissa J Davis', 'Hyeongsun Moon', 'Dorothy Loo', 'Hien Nguyen', 'Judith A Clements', 'Robert G Parton', 'Leonard J Foster', 'Michelle M Hill']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cell Proteomics""","""['Differential impact of caveolae and caveolin-1 scaffolds on the membrane raft proteome.', 'PTRF-cavin-1 expression decreases the migration of PC3 prostate cancer cells: role of matrix metalloprotease 9.', 'PTRF/cavin-1 neutralizes non-caveolar caveolin-1 microdomains in prostate cancer.', 'Caveola-forming proteins caveolin-1 and PTRF in prostate cancer.', 'PTRF triggers a cave in.', 'Regulation of Adenine Nucleotide Metabolism by Adenylate Kinase Isozymes: Physiological Roles and Diseases.', 'Caveolar and non-Caveolar Caveolin-1 in ocular homeostasis and disease.', 'Caveolae-Associated Molecules, Tumor Stroma, and Cancer Drug Resistance: Current Findings and Future Perspectives.', 'Cholesterol-enriched membrane micro-domaindeficiency induces doxorubicin resistancevia promoting autophagy in breast cancer.', 'Caveolin-1-driven membrane remodelling regulates hnRNPK-mediated exosomal microRNA sorting in cancer.']"""

A significant decrease (P < 0.05) in cell survival was observed in the shielded area, outside the primary treatment field (out-of-field), that was lower than predicted when compared to uniform exposures fitted to the linear-quadratic model. Cellular radiosensitivity was demonstrated to be an important factor in the level of response for both the in- and out-of-field regions. These responses were shown to be dependent on secretion-mediated intercellular communication, because inhibition of cellular secreted factors between the in- and out-of-field regions abrogated the response. Out-of-field cell survival was shown to increase after pretreatment of cells with agents known to inhibit factors involved in mediating radiation-induced bystander signaling (aminoguanidine, DMSO or cPTIO). These data illustrate a significant decrease in survival out-of-field, dependent upon intercellular communication, in several cell lines with varying radiosensitivity after exposure to a modulated radiation field.

As highlighted in the UK National Cancer Survivorship Initiative, routine post-diagnostic collection of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) is required; to be most informative, PROMs must be linked and analysed with patients' diagnostic and treatment information. We have designed and built a potentially cost-efficient UK-scalable electronic system for collecting PROMs via the internet, at regular post-diagnostic time-points, for linking these data with patients' clinical data in cancer registries, and for electronically managing the associated patient monitoring and communications; the electronic Patient-reported Outcomes from Cancer Survivors (ePOCS) system. This study aims to test the feasibility of the ePOCS system, by running it for 2 years in two Yorkshire NHS Trusts, and using the Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry and Information Service.  Methods/design:   Non-metastatic breast, colorectal and prostate cancer patients (largest survivor groups), within 6 months post-diagnosis, will be recruited from hospitals in the Yorkshire Cancer Network. Participants will be asked to complete PROMS, assessing a range of health-related quality-of-life outcomes, at three time-points up to 15 months post-diagnosis, and subsequently to provide opinion on the ePOCS system via a feedback questionnaire. Feasibility will be examined primarily in terms of patient recruitment and retention rates, the representativeness of participating patients, the quantity and quality of collected PROMs data, patients' feedback, the success and reliability of the underpinning informatics, and the system running costs. If sufficient data are generated during system testing, these will be analysed to assess the health-related quality-of-life outcomes reported by patients, and to explore if and how they relate to disease, treatment and/or individual differences characteristics.  Discussion:   There is currently no system in the UK for collecting PROMs online and linking these with patients' clinical data in cancer registries. If feasible, ePOCS has potential to provide an affordable UK-scalable technical platform to facilitate and support longitudinal cohort research, and improve understanding of cancer survivors' experiences.

Modulation of the AMPK, Akt and mTOR pathways""","""Background:   Prostate cancer (PrCa) displays resistance to radiotherapy (RT) and requires radiotherapy dose escalation which is associated with greater toxicity. This highlights a need to develop radiation sensitizers to improve the efficacy of RT in PrCa. Ionizing radiation (IR) stimulates pathways of IR-resistance and survival mediated by the protein kinase Akt but it also activates the metabolic energy sensor and tumor suppressor AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK). Here, we examined the effects of the polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) on the IR-induced inhibition of cell survival, modulation of cell cycle and molecular responses in PrCa cells.  Methods:   Androgen-insensitive (PC3), sensitive (22RV1) PrCa and PNT1A normal prostate epithelial cells were treated with RSV alone (2.5-10 μM) or in combination with IR (2-8 Gy). Clonogenic assays, cell cycle analysis, microscopy and immunoblotting were performed to assess survival, cell cycle progression and molecular responses.  Results:   RSV (2.5-5 μM) inhibited clonogenic survival of PC3 and 22RV1 cells but not of normal prostate PNT1A cells. RSV specifically sensitized PrCa cells to IR, induced cell cycle arrest at G1-S phase and enhanced IR-induced nuclear aberrations and apoptosis. RSV enhanced IR-induced expression of DNA damage (γH2Ax) and apoptosis (cleaved-caspase 3) markers as well as of the cell cycle regulators p53, p21(cip1) and p27(kip1). RSV enhanced IR-activation of ATM and AMPK but inhibited basal and IR-induced phosphorylation of Akt.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that RSV arrests cell cycle, promotes apoptosis and sensitizes PrCa cells to IR likely through a desirable dual action to activate the ATM-AMPK-p53-p21(cip1)/p27(kip1) and inhibit the Akt signalling pathways.""","""['Ayesha Rashid', 'Caiqiong Liu', 'Toran Sanli', 'Evangelia Tsiani', 'Gurmit Singh', 'Robert G Bristow', 'Ian Dayes', 'Himu Lukka', 'James Wright', 'Theodoros Tsakiridis']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Ionizing radiation regulates the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in epithelial cancer cells: modulation of cellular signals regulating cell cycle and survival.', 'Salicylate enhances the response of prostate cancer to radiotherapy.', 'Ionizing radiation activates AMP-activated kinase (AMPK): a target for radiosensitization of human cancer cells.', 'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) beyond metabolism: a novel genomic stress sensor participating in the DNA damage response pathway.', 'Role of AMP-activated protein kinase in cancer therapy.', 'The role of AMPK in cancer metabolism and its impact on the immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment.', 'Resveratrol against Cervical Cancer: Evidence from In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.', 'Natural Radiosensitizers in Radiotherapy: Cancer Treatment by Combining Ionizing Radiation with Resveratrol.', 'RESVERATROL BINDS NUCLEAR RECEPTOR 4A1 (NR4A1) AND ACTS AS AN NR4A1 ANTAGONIST IN LUNG CANCER CELLS.', 'Cancer Chemoprevention: A Strategic Approach Using Phytochemicals.']"""

Xanthine oxidase (XO) is considered an oxygen derived free radicals producer and paraoxonasel (PON1) is known as a free radicals scavenger. This study was undertaken to determine the activity of PON1 and XO and their concentration along with the lipid profile, lipid peroxide, and thiol level in cancer patients and healthy persons.  Methods:   Antigen competitive ELISA was used to determine the level of paraoxonasel and xanthine oxidase in plasma. Paraoxonase and arylesterase activity of the PON1 enzyme and the activity of the XO enzyme were also determined. PON1 and XO activity, cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, lipid peroxides, and thiol level in patients with breast cancer (n = 50), prostate cancer (n = 20), lung cancer (n = 12,), cervix cancer (n = 15), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 10), and acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 8) and total age matched healthy persons (n = 115) were studied.  Results:   Low plasma paraoxonase/arylesterase activities (p < 0.05) and the concentration of the PON1 enzyme were observed in all cancer patients. An elevated level of XO activity was observed in cancer patients. Among different cancers, comparatively high level of XO activity was noted in acute lymphoblastic lymphoma patients (0.18 +/- 0.03, p = 0.001) except cervix cancer patients (0.053 +/- 0.03, p = 0.0029) where a low level was observed. Low HDL-C (p < 0.01), cholesterol (p < 0.01), triglycerides (p < 0.01), thiol levels (p < 0.01) and high lipid peroxide levels (p > 0.05) were observed in cancer patients.

Rather, support may facilitate an individual's self-regulation by enhancing perceived self-efficacy (i.e., enabling hypothesis). In the present study, patient-reported indicators of mobilized and received spousal support as predictors of their own and their spouses' self-efficacy beliefs were investigated within 1 year following radical prostatectomy. During this time frame, postoperative sequelae such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunctions are still likely to interfere with couples' everyday activities. Seventy-two patients receiving radical prostatectomy and their spouses participated. Patients' and spouses' self-efficacy beliefs and patients' received and mobilized spousal support were assessed prior to and 12 months following surgery. Additional patient-reported covariates at 1 year post-surgery were degree of bother by urinary incontinence, overall sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. Results indicated that patients' received spousal support was associated with higher levels of patients' self-efficacy only cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Support mobilized by the patient prior to and 1 year after surgery, however, positively predicted spouses' levels and changes in self-efficacy. Results, thus, did not fully confirm predictions by the enabling hypothesis of social support; rather, associated aspects, such as the degree of being mobilized as a provider of support or being needed, seem to enhance agency beliefs in spouses.""","""['Nina Knoll', 'Urte Scholz', 'Silke Burkert', 'Jan Roigas', 'Oliver Gralla']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""Int J Psychol""","""['Relationship satisfaction and erectile functions in men receiving laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: effects of provision and receipt of spousal social support.', 'Changes in reciprocal support provision and need-based support from partners of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Effects of provision and receipt of social support on adjustment to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Spousal responses to prostate cancer: an integrative review.', 'The positive aspects of caregiving for cancer patients: a critical review of the literature and directions for future research.', 'Self-efficacy in caregivers of adults diagnosed with cancer: An integrative review.', 'The experiences of giving and receiving social support for men with localised prostate cancer and their partners.', 'Postoperative self-efficacy and psychological morbidity in radical prostatectomy.', 'The interplay of dyadic and individual planning of pelvic-floor exercise in prostate-cancer patients following radical prostatectomy.']"""
