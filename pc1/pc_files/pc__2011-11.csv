The aim of this study is to explore the experiences of individuals who have survived at least 5 years following a cancer diagnosis, and to describe perceived unmet needs and interactions with primary care.  Methods:   Forty long-term survivors of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer were purposively selected for an in-depth qualitative study. We aimed for a maximum variation sample according to cancer site, gender, time since diagnosis, cancer needs, anxiety and depression. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded thematically using a grounded theory approach.  Results:   Analysis of the interview data is presented in four subthemes: the role they perceived for the general practitioner (GP), unmet needs, reasons for not using primary care for needs they perceived as cancer related, and ongoing care for cancer-related issues. The majority of cancer survivors did not see a role for their GP in their long-term care related to their cancer diagnosis as most considered that they did not need active follow-up, but some expressed a need for psychological services and information on possible long-term effects. Cancer survivors cited three main reasons for not using GP services in relation to their cancer diagnosis: GPs were seen as non-experts in cancer; they were perceived as too busy; and a lack of continuity within primary care made it difficult to talk about long-term issues. There was a wide variation in schedules and notification of PSA tests among the prostate cancer survivors.  Discussion:   The results from this project suggest that some cancer survivors have specific emotional and physical needs that could benefit from input from their primary care team, but not all cancer survivors look to their GP for their long-term cancer-related care. Better information care planning is required from specialists in order to identify those who would benefit most.""","""['N F Khan', 'J Evans', 'P W Rose']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Partners and close family members of long-term cancer survivors: health status, psychosocial well-being and unmet supportive care needs.', 'Supportive Care and Information Needs of Cancer Survivors: A Comparison of Two Cohorts of Longterm Cancers Survivors 5 and 10 Years after Primary Cancer Diagnosis.', 'GP experience and understandings of providing follow-up care in prostate cancer survivors in England.', 'Long-Term Survival of Women with Breast Cancer.

This study describes the inpatient and day case hospital activity among the population of cancer survivors in England. This is one measure of the burden of cancer on the individual and the health service.  Methods:   The national cancer registry data set for England (1990-2006) is linked to the NHS Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database. Cohorts of survivors were defined as those people recorded in the cancer registry data with a diagnosis of breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer before 2007. The person-time of prevalence in 2006 for each cohort of survivors was calculated according to the cancer type, sex, age and time since diagnosis. The corresponding HES episodes of care in 2006 were used to calculate the person-time of admitted hospital care for each cohort of survivors. The average proportion of time spent in hospital by survivors in each cohort was calculated as the summed person-time of hospital activity divided by the summed person-time of prevalence. The analysis was conducted separately for cancer-related episodes and non-cancer-related episodes.  Results:   Lung cancer survivors had the highest intensity of cancer-related hospital activity. For all cancers, cancer-related hospital activity was highest in the first year following diagnosis. Breast and prostate cancer survivors had peaks of cancer-related hospital activity in the relatively young and relatively old age groups. The proportion of time spent in hospital for non-cancer-related care was much lower than that for cancer-related care and increased gradually with age but was generally constant regardless of time since diagnosis.  Conclusion:   The person-time approach used in this study is more revealing than a simple enumeration of cancer survivors and hospital admissions. Hospital activity among cancer survivors is highest soon after diagnosis. The effect of age on the amount of hospital activity is different for each type of cancer.""","""['J Maddams', 'M Utley', 'H Møller']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Levels of acute health service use among cancer survivors in the United Kingdom.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Long-term inpatient disease burden in the Adult Life after Childhood Cancer in Scandinavia (ALiCCS) study: A cohort study of 21,297 childhood cancer survivors.', 'Long-term Risk of Hospitalization for Somatic Diseases in Survivors of Adolescent or Young Adult Cancer.', 'Trends in the prevalence of malignancy among patients admitted with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Health care services use among long-term breast cancer survivors: a systematic review.', 'A Population-Based, Nationwide Cross-Sectional Study on Influenza Vaccination Status among Cancer Survivors in Korea.', 'Using routinely collected data to stratify prostate cancer patients into phases of care in the United Kingdom: implications for resource allocation and the cancer survivorship programme.', 'Understanding NHS hospital admissions in England: linkage of Hospital Episode Statistics to the Hertfordshire Cohort Study.', 'Projections of cancer prevalence in the United Kingdom, 2010-2040.']"""

We sought to establish the burden of health outcomes that have been associated with treatment among British long-term cancer survivors.  Methods:   We identified 26,213 adults from the General Practice Research Database who have survived 5 years or more following breast, colorectal or prostate cancer. Four age-, sex- and general practice-matched non-cancer controls were selected for each survivor. We considered the incidence of treatment-associated health outcomes using Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   Breast cancer survivors had an elevated incidence of heart failure (hazards ratio (HR) 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-3.01), coronary artery disease (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.44), hypothyroidism (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02-1.56) and osteoporosis (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.40). Among colorectal cancer survivors, there was increased incidence of dementia (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.20-2.35), diabetes (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.12-1.72) and osteoporosis (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.15-1.73). Prostate cancer survivors had the highest risk of osteoporosis (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.93-3.22).  Conclusions:   The study confirms the occurrence of increased incidence of chronic illnesses in long-term cancer survivors attributable to underlying lifestyle and/or cancer treatments. Although the absolute risk of the majority of late effects in the cancer survivors cohort is low, identifying prior risk of osteoporosis by bone mineral density scanning for prostate survivors should be considered. There is an urgent need to improve primary care recording of cancer treatment.""","""['N F Khan', 'D Mant', 'L Carpenter', 'D Forman', 'P W Rose']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Pre- and Post-diagnosis Diabetes as a Risk Factor for All-Cause and Cancer-Specific Mortality in Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Survivors: a Prospective Cohort Study.', 'Quality of diabetes care in breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer.', 'Gynecological malignancy risk in colorectal cancer survivors: A\xa0population-based cohort study.', 'Vitamin and mineral supplement use among US adults after cancer diagnosis: a systematic review.', 'Trends in the prevalence of malignancy among patients admitted with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Genomic signature to guide adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions for early breast cancer patients in France: a cost-effectiveness analysis.', 'Fracture risk among patients with cancer compared to individuals without cancer: a population-based study.', 'Longitudinal changes of health-related quality of life over 10\xa0years in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery.', 'Hypothyroidism Evaluation after Radiotherapy of Breast and Supraclavicular in Patients with Breast Cancer.', 'Breast cancer, breast cancer-directed radiation therapy and risk of hypothyroidism: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

While most studies have addressed the estrogenic effects of phthalates in malignancies of the breast and the prostate, little is known about their role in the etiology of hormone-independent cancer. Here we show that treatments with the phthalates n-butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) at 1 μM induced proliferation (BBP, 3.2-fold; DBP, 3.2-fold), migration (BBP, 2.6-fold; DBP, 2.6-fold), invasion (BBP, 2.7-fold; DBP, 3.1-fold), and tumor formation (EC(50): BBP, 0.12 μM; DBP, 0.22 μM) in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). We further demonstrate that phthalates stimulated the cell surface aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and triggered the downstream cyclic AMP (cAMP)-PKA-CREB1 signaling cascade. The pathway led to increased expression of HDAC6, which facilitated nuclear assembly of the β-catenin-LEF1/TCF4 transcriptional complex and transactivation of the c-Myc oncogene. This nongenomic pathway emanated from the phthalate-induced AhR promoted tumorigenesis of ER-negative breast cancer. Collectively, our findings revealed a novel oncogenic mechanism of phthalates in breast cancer independent from their estrogenic activities.""","""['Tsung-Hua Hsieh', 'Cheng-Fang Tsai', 'Chia-Yi Hsu', 'Po-Lin Kuo', 'Jau-Nan Lee', 'Chee-Yin Chai', 'Shao-Chun Wang', 'Eing-Mei Tsai']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""FASEB J""","""['Phthalates stimulate the epithelial to mesenchymal transition through an HDAC6-dependent mechanism in human breast epithelial stem cells.', 'Biological impact of phthalates.', 'Lower concentrations of phthalates induce proliferation in human breast cancer cells.', 'Possible mechanism of phthalates-induced tumorigenesis.', 'Mechanism of phthalate esters in the progression and development of breast cancer.', 'The Role of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) and Its Ligands in Breast Cancer.', 'Association of Serum Levels of Plasticizers Compounds, Phthalates and Bisphenols, in Patients and Survivors of Breast Cancer: A Real Connection?', 'Developmental Exposure to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals and Its Impact on Cardio-Metabolic-Renal Health.', 'Differences in personal care product use by race/ethnicity among women in California: implications for chemical exposures.', 'The Long-Term DEHP Exposure Confers Multidrug Resistance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells through ABC Transporters and Intracellular ROS.']"""

Additional genetic prognosticators are needed to triage these patients toward intensified combination therapy with novel targeted therapeutics. We tested the role of the NKX3.1 gene as a determinant of treatment outcome given its reported roles in tumor initiating cell (TIC) renewal, the DNA damage response, and cooperation with c-MYC during prostate cancer progression.  Methods:   Using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), we profiled the copy number alterations in TIC genes using tumor DNA from frozen needle biopsies derived from 126 intermediate-risk patients who underwent IGRT. These data were correlated to biochemical relapse-free rate (bRFR) by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   A screen of the aCGH-IGRT data for TIC genes showed frequent copy number alterations for NKX3.1, PSCA, and c-MYC. NKX3.1 haploinsufficiency was associated with increased genomic instability independent of PSA, T-category, and Gleason-score. After adjusting for clinical factors in a multivariate model, NKX3.1 haploinsufficiency was associated with bRFR when tested alone (HR = 3.05, 95% CI: 1.46-6.39, P = 0.0030) or when combined with c-MYC gain (HR = 3.88, 95% CI: 1.78-8.49, P = 0.00067). A similar association was observed for patients following radical prostatectomy with a public aCGH database. NKX3.1 status was associated with positive biopsies post-IGRT and increased clonogen radioresistance in vitro.

Yet, there has been no assessment of whether vaccines currently in the research and development pipeline reflect the burden of disease and current survival patterns for different malignancies. The authors used data from the National Cancer Institute, Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, and clinicaltrials.gov registry to characterize the vaccine development pipeline with respect to 5 measures of disease burden and treatment effectiveness for cancer: annual incidence, annual mortality, five-year survival rate, recent change in five-year survival (1999-2006 vs 1990-1992), and five-year mortality estimate (=annual incidence*[1 - 5-yr survival rate]). In 2011, the authors identified 231 active clinical trials for therapeutic cancer vaccines. Of these trials, 81 vaccines are currently in Phase I, 140 in Phase II, and 10 vaccines in Phase III. Vaccine trials for melanoma are most common (n=40), followed by breast cancer (34), lung cancer (30), and prostate cancer (22). Correlation analyses revealed that only annual cancer incidence is significantly associated with current therapeutic cancer vaccine trial activity (r=.60; p=.003). Annual mortality, 5-year survival rate and 5-year mortality estimates were not associated with vaccine trial activity. The authors conclude that therapeutic cancer vaccine clinical trials correspond with disease incidence in the U.S., but not with measures of mortality and survival that reflect the effectiveness of currently available treatment modalities.

Functional imaging is used to acquire a heterogeneous dose prescription in terms of Dose Painting by Numbers and to create a patient-specific IMRT plan.  Method and materials:   Adapted from a method for selective dose escalation under the guidance of spatial biology distribution, a model, which translates heterogeneously distributed radiobiological parameters into voxelwise dose prescriptions, was developed. At the example of a prostate case with (18)F-choline PET imaging, different sets of reported values for the parameters were examined concerning their resulting range of dose values. Furthermore, the influence of each parameter of the linear-quadratic model was investigated. A correlation between PET signal and proliferation as well as cell density was assumed. Using our in-house treatment planning software Direct Monte Carlo Optimization (DMCO), a treatment plan based on the obtained dose prescription was generated. Gafchromic EBT films were irradiated for evaluation.  Results:   When a TCP of 95% was aimed at, the maximal dose in a voxel of the prescription exceeded 100Gy for most considered parameter sets. One of the parameter sets resulted in a dose range of 87.1Gy to 99.3Gy, yielding a TCP of 94.7%, and was investigated more closely. The TCP of the plan decreased to 73.5% after optimization based on that prescription. The dose difference histogram of optimized and prescribed dose revealed a mean of -1.64Gy and a standard deviation of 4.02Gy. Film verification showed a reasonable agreement of planned and delivered dose.  Conclusion:   If the distribution of radiobiological parameters within a tumor is known, this model can be used to create a dose-painting by numbers plan which maximizes the TCP. It could be shown, that such a heterogeneous dose distribution is technically feasible.""","""['Thomas Dirscherl', 'Mark Rickhey', 'Ludwig Bogner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Z Med Phys""","""['Intensity modulated radiation therapy dose painting for localized prostate cancer using ¹¹C-choline positron emission tomography scans.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for primary prostate cancer with selective intraprostatic boost determined by 18F-choline PET/CT.', 'Choline PET based dose-painting in prostate cancer--modelling of dose effects.', 'PET/CT imaging-guided dose painting in radiation therapy.', 'Imaging of prostate cancer with PET/CT and radioactively labeled choline derivates.', 'Plan Assessment Metrics for Dose Painting in Stereotactic Radiosurgery.', 'Uncertainty evaluation of image-based tumour control probability models in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using a visual analytic tool.', 'Voxel-level biological optimisation of prostate IMRT using patient-specific tumour location and clonogen density derived from mpMRI.', 'Progress towards Patient-Specific, Spatially-Continuous Radiobiological Dose Prescription and Planning in Prostate Cancer IMRT: An Overview.', 'Impact of different biologically-adapted radiotherapy strategies on tumor control evaluated with a tumor response model.']"""

They must consider both goals of optimising quantity and quality of life. The quality of life (QoL) is a psychometric outcome which is measured using validated questionnaires. Only few data are published concerning pre - and postoperative QoL.  Methods:   This study investigated pre perative QoL of 185 patients who consecutively underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy for organ-confined PCa to postoperative QoL of another 185 patients. The EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQPR25 module and 24 h ICS pad test were used (mean follow-up 28.6 months).  Results:   The examined symptom scores of the EORTC QLQ-PR25 were on lowest level. In the dyspnoea symptom score differences of age emerged: the amount of patients who are short of breath rose significantly in older patients after surgery (p < 0.05 paired, two-tailed student's t-test).. Lastly, the urinary symptom score was found postal-therapeutically low; this fact was age independent. The results of sexual symptom score need to be taken into consideration, since prostatectomy resulted in a significant reduction of sexual activity independent of age. All functioning scales postoperatively reached high values without significant changes (p > 0.05 student's t-test ), which implies a high QoL after surgery. A reliable and satisfying status of continence was found in our patients after retropubic prostatectomy. A high rate of patients (89.2%) would choose retropubic prostatectomy again.  Conclusion:   Retropubic prostatectomy represents a reliable and accepted procedure in the treatment of organ-confined PCa. For the first time it could be shown that patients` QoL remained on a high level after retropubic prostatectomy.

The authors propose a new device and a fast, automatic method to calibrate the brachytherapy system in the operating room, with instant error feedback.  Methods:   A device was CAD-designed and precision-engineered, which mechanically couples a calibration phantom with an exact replica of the standard brachytherapy template. From real-time TRUS images acquired from the calibration device and processed by the calibration system, the coordinate transformation between the brachytherapy template and the TRUS images was computed automatically. The system instantly generated a report of the target reconstruction accuracy based on the current calibration outcome.  Results:   Four types of validation tests were conducted. First, 50 independent, real-time calibration trials yielded an average of 0.57 ± 0.13 mm line reconstruction error (LRE) relative to ground truth. Second, the averaged LRE was 0.37 ± 0.25 mm relative to ground truth in tests with six different commercial TRUS scanners operating at similar imaging settings.

A key challenge in developing robust inverse planning solutions for IMAT is the need to account for the connectivity of the beam shapes as the gantry rotates from one beam angle to the next. To overcome this challenge, inverse planning solutions typically impose a leaf motion constraint that defines the maximum distance a multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf can travel between adjacent control points. The leaf motion constraint ensures the deliverability of the optimized plan, but it also impacts the plan quality, the delivery accuracy, and the delivery efficiency. In this work, the authors have studied leaf motion constraints in detail and have developed recommendations for optimizing the balance between plan quality and delivery efficiency.  Methods:   Two steps were used to generate optimized IMAT treatment plans. The first was the direct machine parameter optimization (DMPO) inverse planning module in the Pinnacle(3) planning system. Then, a home-grown arc sequencer was applied to convert the optimized intensity maps into deliverable IMAT arcs. IMAT leaf motion constraints were imposed using limits of between 1 and 30 mm∕deg. Dose distributions were calculated using the convolution∕superposition algorithm in the Pinnacle(3) planning system. The IMAT plan dose calculation accuracy was examined using a finer sampling calculation and the quality assurance verification. All plans were delivered on an Elekta Synergy with an 80-leaf MLC and were verified using an IBA MatriXX 2D ion chamber array inserted in a MultiCube solid water phantom.  Results:   The use of a more restrictive leaf motion constraint (less than 1-2 mm∕deg) results in inferior plan quality. A less restrictive leaf motion constraint (greater than 5 mm∕deg) results in improved plan quality but can lead to less accurate dose distribution as evidenced by increasing discrepancies between the planned and the delivered doses. For example, the results from our patient-specific quality assurance measurements demonstrated that the average gamma analysis passing rate decreased from 98% to 80% when the allowable leaf motion increased from 3 to 20 mm∕deg. Larger leaf motion constraints also led to longer treatment delivery times (2 to 4 folds) due to the additional MLC leaf motion.  Conclusions:   Leaf motion constraints significantly impact IMAT plans in terms of plan quality, delivery accuracy, and delivery efficiency with the impact magnified for more complex cases. Our studies indicate that a leaf motion constraint of 2 to 3 mm∕deg of gantry rotation can provide an optimal balance between plan quality, delivery accuracy, and efficiency.""","""['Fan Chen', 'Min Rao', 'Jin-song Ye', 'David M Shepard', 'Daliang Cao']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Incorporating geometric ray tracing to generate initial conditions for intensity modulated arc therapy optimization.', 'Clinical implementation of intensity-modulated arc therapy.', 'IMAT-SIM: a new method for the clinical dosimetry of intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT).', 'Direct aperture optimization as a means of reducing the complexity of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy plans.', 'Utilising the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training System to Support Undergraduate Teaching of IMRT, VMAT, DCAT Treatment Planning, and QA Concepts.', 'Accuracy Evaluation of Collapsed Cone Convolution Superposition Algorithms for the Nasopharynx Interface in the Early Stage of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Evaluation of complexity and deliverability of prostate cancer treatment plans designed with a knowledge-based VMAT planning technique.', 'Complexity metrics for IMRT and VMAT plans: a review of current literature and applications.', 'Multidimensional correlation among plan complexity, quality and deliverability parameters for volumetric-modulated arc therapy using canonical correlation analysis.', 'Dosimetric comparison of different treatment modalities for stereotactic radiotherapy.']"""

With the authors' recently developed deformable surface model, prostate boundaries in each treatment image can be rapidly segmented and their correspondences (or relative deformations) to the prostate boundaries in the planning image are also established automatically. However, the dense correspondences on the nonboundary regions, which are important especially for transforming the treatment plan designed in the planning image space to each treatment image space, are remained unresolved. This paper presents a novel approach to learn the statistical correlation between deformations of prostate boundary and nonboundary regions, for rapidly estimating deformations of the nonboundary regions when given the deformations of the prostate boundary at a new treatment image.  Methods:   The main contributions of the proposed method lie in the following aspects. First, the statistical deformation correlation will be learned from both current patient and other training patients, and further updated adaptively during the radiotherapy. Specifically, in the initial treatment stage when the number of treatment images collected from the current patient is small, the statistical deformation correlation is mainly learned from other training patients. As more treatment images are collected from the current patient, the patient-specific information will play a more important role in learning patient-specific statistical deformation correlation to effectively reflect prostate deformation of the current patient during the treatment. Eventually, only the patient-specific statistical deformation correlation is used to estimate dense correspondences when a sufficient number of treatment images have been acquired from the current patient. Second, the statistical deformation correlation will be learned by using a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, i.e., ridge regression (RR) model, which has the best prediction accuracy than other MLR models such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and principal component regression (PCR).  Results:   To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we first evaluate its registration accuracy by comparing the deformation field predicted by our method with the deformation field estimated by the thin plate spline (TPS) based correspondence interpolation method on 306 serial prostate CT images of 24 patients. The average predictive error on the voxels around 5 mm of prostate boundary is 0.38 mm for our method of RR-based correlation model. Also, the corresponding maximum error is 2.89 mm. We then compare the speed for deformation interpolation by different methods. When considering the larger region of interest (ROI) with the size of 512 × 512 × 61, our method takes 24.41 seconds to interpolate the dense deformation field while TPS method needs 6.7 minutes; when considering a small ROI (surrounding prostate) with size of 112 × 110 × 93, our method takes 1.80 seconds, while TPS method needs 25 seconds.  Conclusions:   Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve much faster registration speed yet with comparable registration accuracy, compared to the TPS-based correspondence (or deformation) interpolation approach.""","""['Yonghong Shi', 'Shu Liao', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Learning Statistical Correlation of Prostate Deformations for Fast Registration.', 'A Bayesian nonrigid registration method to enhance intraoperative target definition in image-guided prostate procedures through uncertainty characterization.', 'Validation of a deformable image registration technique for cone beam CT-based dose verification.', '""Patient-specific validation of deformable image registration in radiation therapy: Overview and caveats"".', 'A review of deep learning-based three-dimensional medical image registration methods.', 'Selection of optimal hyper-parameters for estimation of uncertainty in MRI-TRUS registration of the prostate.']"""

Clinical MVCBCT images are traditionally acquired with the same 6 MV treatment beam line (TBL) that is used for cancer treatment, a standard amorphous Si (a-Si) flat panel imager, and the Kodak Lanex Fast-B (LFB) scintillator. The IBL produces a greater fluence of keV-range photons than the TBL, to which the detector response is more optimal, and the SPA is a more efficient scintillator than the LFB.  Methods:   A prototype IBL + SPA system was installed on a Siemens Oncor linear accelerator equipped with the MVision(TM) image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) system. A SPA strip consisting of four neighboring tiles and measuring 40 cm by 10.96 cm in the crossplane and inplane directions, respectively, was installed in the flat panel imager. Head- and pelvis-sized phantom images were acquired at doses ranging from 3 to 60 cGy with three MVCBCT configurations: TBL + LFB, IBL + LFB, and IBL + SPA. Phantom image quality at each dose was quantified using the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and modulation transfer function (MTF) metrics. Head and neck, thoracic, and pelvic (prostate) cancer patients were imaged with the three imaging system configurations at multiple doses ranging from 3 to 15 cGy. The systems were assessed qualitatively from the patient image data.  Results:   For head and neck and pelvis-sized phantom images, imaging doses of 3 cGy or greater, and relative electron densities of 1.09 and 1.48, the CNR average improvement factors for imaging system change of TBL + LFB to IBL + LFB, IBL + LFB to IBL + SPA, and TBL + LFB to IBL + SPA were 1.63 (p < 10(- 8)), 1.64 (p < 10(- 13)), 2.66 (p < 10(- 9)), respectively. For all imaging doses, soft tissue contrast was more easily differentiated on IBL + SPA head and neck and pelvic images than TBL + LFB and IBL + LFB. IBL + SPA thoracic images were comparable to IBL + LFB images, but less noisy than TBL + LFB images at all imaging doses considered. The mean MTFs over all imaging doses were comparable, at within 3%, for all imaging system configurations for both the head- and pelvis-sized phantoms.  Conclusions:   Since CNR scales with the square root of imaging dose, changing from TBL + LFB to IBL + LFB and IBL + LFB to IBL + SPA reduces the imaging dose required to obtain a given CNR by factors of 0.38 and 0.37, respectively. MTFs were comparable between imaging system configurations. IBL + SPA patient image quality was always better than that of the TBL + LFB system and as good as or better than that of the IBL + LFB system, for a given dose.""","""['Elizabeth K Breitbach', 'Jonathan S Maltz', 'Bijumon Gangadharan', 'Ali Bani-Hashemi', 'Carryn M Anderson', 'Sudershan K Bhatia', 'Jared Stiles', 'Drake S Edwards', 'Ryan T Flynn']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric characterization and application of an imaging beam line with a carbon electron target for megavoltage cone beam computed tomography.', 'Comparison of patient megavoltage cone beam CT images acquired with an unflattened beam from a carbon target and a flattened treatment beam.', 'Physical performance and image optimization of megavoltage cone-beam CT.', 'Low dose megavoltage cone beam computed tomography with an unflattened 4 MV beam from a carbon target.', 'Cone Beam CT vs. Fan Beam CT: A Comparison of Image Quality and Dose Delivered Between Two Differing CT Imaging Modalities.', 'Low-dose megavoltage cone-beam computed tomography using a novel multi-layer imager (MLI).', 'Development of a novel high quantum efficiency MV x-ray detector for image-guided radiotherapy: A feasibility study.', 'Comparison between manual and automatic image registration in image-guided radiation therapy using megavoltage cone-beam computed tomography with an imaging beam line for prostate cancer.', 'A piecewise-focused high DQE detector for MV imaging.', 'Image quality and dose distributions of three linac-based imaging modalities.']"""

Methods:   An electronic motion sensor was developed based on a three axis accelerometer. HDR brachytherapy treatment for prostate is delivered at this institution in two fractions 24 h apart and 22 patients were monitored for movement over the interval between fractions. The motion sensors functioned as inclinometers, monitoring inclination of both thighs, and the inclination and roll of the abdomen. The implanted HDR brachytherapy catheter set was assessed for displacement relative to fiducial markers in the prostate. Angle measurements and angle differences over a 2 s time base were binned, and the standard deviations of the resulting frequency distributions used as a metric for patient motion in each monitored axis. These parameters were correlated to measured catheter displacement using regression modeling.  Results:   The mean implant displacement was 12.6 mm in the caudal direction. A mean of 19.95 h data was recorded for the patient cohort. Patients generally moved through a limited range of angles with a mean of the exception of two patients who spent in excess of 2 h lying on their side. When tested for a relationship between movement in any of the four monitored axes and the implant displacement, none was significant.

In a case-control study of 1056 lung cancer cases and 1056 sex and age frequency-matched cancer-free controls, we investigated the association between two common polymorphisms in DAB2IP gene (-1420T>G, rs7042542; 97906C>A, rs1571801) and the risk of lung cancer.

Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is induced by a variety of stress and inflammatory conditions and is over-expressed in many kinds of cancer cells. However, molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropic functions of ATF3 have remained elusive. Here we employed systems analysis to identify genome-wide targets of ATF3 that is either induced by an alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or over-expressed in a prostate tumour cell line LNCaP. We show that stress-induced and cancer-associated ATF3 is recruited to 5,984 and 1,423 targets, respectively, in the human genome, 89% of which are common. Notably, ATF3 targets are highly enriched for not only ATF/CRE motifs but also binding sites of several other stress-inducible transcription factors indicating an extensive network of stress response factors in transcriptional regulation of target genes. Further analysis of effects of ATF3 knockdown on these targets revealed that stress-induced ATF3 regulates genes in metabolic pathways, cell cycle, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and signalling including insulin, p53, Wnt, and VEGF pathways. Cancer-associated ATF3 is involved in regulation of distinct sets of genes in processes such as calcium signalling, Wnt, p53 and diabetes pathways. Notably, stress-induced ATF3 binds to 40% of p53 targets and activates pro-apoptotic genes such as TNFRSF10B/DR5 and BBC3/PUMA. Cancer-associated ATF3, by contrast, represses these pro-apoptotic genes in addition to CDKN1A/p21.

However, the extent of STAT3's reach on transcriptional control of the genome as a whole remains an important question. We predicted that this persistent STAT3 signaling affects a wide variety of cellular functions, many of which still remain to be characterized. We took a broad approach to identify novel STAT3 regulated genes by examining changes in the genome-wide gene expression profile by microarray, using cells expressing constitutively-activated STAT3. Using computational analysis, we were able to define the gene expression profiles of cells containing activated STAT3 and identify candidate target genes with a wide range of biological functions. Among these genes we identified Necdin, a negative growth regulator, as a novel STAT3 target gene, whose expression is down-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels when STAT3 is constitutively active. This repression is STAT3 dependent, since inhibition of STAT3 using siRNA restores Necdin expression. A STAT3 DNA-binding site was identified in the Necdin promoter and both EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirm binding of STAT3 to this region. Necdin expression has previously been shown to be down-regulated in a melanoma and a drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell line. Further analysis of Necdin expression demonstrated repression in a STAT3-dependent manner in human melanoma, prostate and breast cancer cell lines. These results suggest that STAT3 coordinates expression of genes involved in multiple metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, integrating signals that lead to global transcriptional changes and oncogenesis. STAT3 may exert its oncogenic effect by up-regulating transcription of genes involved in promoting growth and proliferation, but also by down-regulating expression of negative regulators of the same cellular processes, such as Necdin.""","""['Rachel Haviland', 'Steven Eschrich', 'Gregory Bloom', 'Yihong Ma', 'Susan Minton', 'Richard Jove', 'W Douglas Cress']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Stat3 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP-beta) regulate Jab1/CSN5 expression in mammary carcinoma cells.', 'Insulin/IGF-I regulation of necdin and brown adipocyte differentiation via CREB- and FoxO1-associated pathways.', 'Necdin, a p53-target gene, is an inhibitor of p53-mediated growth arrest.', 'Molecular disruption of oncogenic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein.', 'Targeting STAT3 affects melanoma on multiple fronts.', 'Necdin: A purposive integrator of molecular interaction networks for mammalian neuron vitality.', 'PGC1α: Friend or Foe in Cancer?', 'Small-molecule inhibition of STAT3 in radioresistant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Copy number changes and methylation patterns in an isodicentric and a ring chromosome of 15q11-q13: report of two cases and review of literature.', 'Stability of methylation markers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Regulation of hZIP1 by miR-182 via two binding sites was confirmed in primary prostate cell cultures. miR-96 and miR-183 are expressed as a cluster with miR-182 and share similar sequences. Array profiling of tissue showed that miR-183, -96, and -182 are higher in prostate cancer tissue compared with normal prostate. Overexpression of the entire miR-183-96-182 cluster suppressed five additional zinc transporters. Overexpression of miR-183, -96, and -182 individually or as a cluster diminished labile zinc pools and reduced zinc uptake, demonstrating this miR cluster as a regulator of zinc homeostasis. We observed regulation of zinc homeostasis by this cluster in prostate cells and HEK-293 cells, suggesting a universal mechanism that is not prostate-specific. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a miR cluster targeting a family of metal transport proteins. Individually or as a cluster, miR-183, -96, and -182 are overexpressed in other cancers too, implicating this miR cluster in carcinogenesis.""","""['Brittany L Mihelich', 'Ekaterina A Khramtsova', 'Nicole Arva', 'Avani Vaishnav', 'Daniel N Johnson', 'Angeline A Giangreco', 'Elena Martens-Uzunova', 'Omar Bagasra', 'André Kajdacsy-Balla', 'Larisa Nonn']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['The miR-183 family cluster alters zinc homeostasis in benign prostate cells, organoids and prostate cancer xenografts.', 'hZIP1 zinc transporter down-regulation in prostate cancer involves the overexpression of ras responsive element binding protein-1 (RREB-1).', 'hZIP1 zinc uptake transporter down regulation and zinc depletion in prostate cancer.', 'Zinc and zinc transporters in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Zinc transporters in prostate cancer.', 'Mir-183 functions as an oncogene via decreasing PTEN in breast cancer cells.', 'Differential Expression of miRNAs Contributes to Tumor Aggressiveness and Racial Disparity in African American Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'lncRNA LINC00960 promotes apoptosis by sponging ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1-targeting miR-183-5p.', 'elk1/miR-462-731 Feedback Loop Regulates Macrophages Polarization and Phagocytosis in Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.']"""

This high frequency of recurrent PTEN deletions in prostate cancer suggests there may be unusual genomic features close to this locus that facilitate DNA alteration at 10q23.3. To explore possible mechanisms for deletions in the PTEN region, a meta-analysis of 311 published human genome array datasets was conducted and determined that the minimal prostate cancer-associated deletion at 10q23.3 corresponds to ∼2.06 MB region flanked by BMPR1A and FAS. On a separate cohort comprising an additional 330 tumors, four-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using probes for BMPR1A, FAS, cen(10), and PTEN showed that 132 of 330 (40%) tumors had PTEN loss, 50 (15%) of which were homozygous losses (comprising in total 100 deletion events). Breakpoints between PTEN and BMPR1A or FAS were subsequently mapped in 100 homozygous and 82 hemizygous PTEN losses, revealing that 125/182 PTEN microdeletions occurred within the 940 kB interval between BMPR1A and PTEN. Furthermore, this breakpoint interval coincides with a repeat-rich region of 414 kB containing the SD17 and SD18 segmental duplications, which contain at least 13 homologous inverted repeat sequences. Together, these data suggest that a strong selective growth advantage for loss of PTEN and upregulation of PI3K/AKT, combined with the close proximity of PTEN to a large unstable segment of repeated DNA comprising SD17 and SD18, can lead to recurrent microdeletions of the PTEN gene in prostate cancer. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.""","""['Maisa Yoshimoto', 'Olga Ludkovski', 'Dave DeGrace', 'Julia L Williams', 'Andrew Evans', 'Kanishka Sircar', 'Tarek A Bismar', 'Paulo Nuin', 'Jeremy A Squire']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Genes Chromosomes Cancer""","""['FISH analysis of 107 prostate cancers shows that PTEN genomic deletion is associated with poor clinical outcome.', 'PTEN genomic deletion is associated with p-Akt and AR signalling in poorer outcome, hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'PTEN genomic deletion is an early event associated with ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'Juvenile polyposis and other intestinal polyposis syndromes with microdeletions of chromosome 10q22-23.', 'Genomic Rearrangements of PTEN in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pan-cancer genomic analysis shows hemizygous PTEN loss tumors are associated with immune evasion and poor outcome.', 'Race and prostate cancer: genomic landscape.', 'The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Precision Targets for Intercepting the Lethal Progression of Prostate Cancer: Potential Avenues for Personalized Therapy.', 'Transcriptional landscape of PTEN loss in primary prostate cancer.']"""

We observed uptake of this PET tracer in mediastinal lymph nodes in a significant number of patients. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of this finding and to determine whether it is correlated with tumour and nontumour-related aspects.  Materials and methods:   A total of 48 consecutive men (mean age: 65.6 years; range: 50-79 years, standard deviation: 7.1) with histopathologically proven prostate cancer were referred for F18-choline PET/CT imaging for restaging from March 2009 to October 2010. All patients had a suspicion of tumour recurrence because of an increased PSA or a rapidly increasing PSA. All studies were reviewed, and the results were correlated with general data such as age; smoking; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; tumor, lymph nodes and distant metastases stage; Gleason Score and PSA level; with a maximum interval of 3 months between serum PSA and the PET/CT scan.  Results:   In 27 patients (56.3%), F18-choline PET/CT showed positive lymph nodes in the mediastinum (mean standardized uptake values: 3.75; range: 1.7-13.8, standard deviation: 2.4). No histological biopsy was carried out in F18-choline-positive lymph nodes, but in none of the patients was mediastinal recurrence or pulmonary infection observed during a 6-month follow-up. Only one patient had histologically proven pulmonary metastasis. No significant relationship was observed between mediastinal F18-choline lymph node uptake and serum PSA level (P=0.785), initial T stage (P=0.555), N stage (P=0.548), M stage (P=0.426), smoking (P=0.537), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.115) or the presence of tumour recurrence on F18-choline PET/CT.  Conclusion:   Mediastinal lymph node uptake of F18 choline is frequently observed, without any significant relationship with tumour characteristics.

Although TRAIL and agonistic antibodies to DR4 and DR5 are considered safe and promising candidates in cancer therapy, many malignant cells are resistant to DR-mediated, TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In the current work, we screened a small library of fifty-five FDA and foreign-approved anti-neoplastic drugs in order to identify candidates that sensitized resistant prostate and pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.  Methods:   FDA-approved drugs were screened for their ability to sensitize TRAIL resistant prostate cancer cells to TRAIL using an MTT assay for cell viability. Analysis of variance was used to identify drugs that exhibited synergy with TRAIL. Drugs demonstrating the highest synergy were selected as leads and tested in different prostate and pancreatic cancer cell lines, and one immortalized human pancreatic epithelial cell line. Sequential and simultaneous dosing modalities were investigated and the annexin V/propidium iodide assay, in concert with fluorescence microscopy, was employed to visualize cells undergoing apoptosis.  Results:   Fourteen drugs were identified as having synergy with TRAIL, including those whose TRAIL sensitization activities were previously unknown in either prostate or pancreatic cancer cells or both. Five leads were tested in additional cancer cell lines of which, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and mithramycin demonstrated synergy in all lines. In particular, mitoxantrone and mithramycin demonstrated significant synergy with TRAIL and led to reduction of cancer cell viability at concentrations lower than 1 μM. At these low concentrations, mitoxantrone demonstrated selectivity toward malignant cells over normal pancreatic epithelial cells.

The study aimed to determine the bioavailability of green tea polyphenols in prostate tissue and to measure its effects on systemic and tissue biomarkers of prostate cancer carcinogenesis. Participants received either polyphenon E (containing 800 mg epigallocatechin gallate) or placebo daily for 3 to 6 weeks before surgery. Following the intervention, green tea polyphenol levels in the prostatectomy tissue were low to undetectable. Polyphenon E intervention resulted in favorable but not statistically significant changes in serum prostate-specific antigen, serum insulin-like growth factor axis, and oxidative DNA damage in blood leukocytes. Tissue biomarkers of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in the prostatectomy tissue did not differ between the treatment arms. The proportion of subjects who had a decrease in Gleason score between biopsy and surgical specimens was greater in those on polyphenon E but was not statistically significant.

Five founder mutations have been identified in two previous studies of breast cancer patients in the Bogota region [1,2]. It is important that the frequency of mutations be established among unselected cases of ovarian cancer in order to estimate the genetic burden of this cancer in Colombia and to plan genetic and preventive services.  Methods:   We enrolled 100 unselected women with ovarian cancer from the Bogota region, and from northern and southern central regions of Colombia. A detailed family history was obtained from each patient and a blood sample was processed for DNA analysis. DNA quality was adequate for BRCA testing for 96 women. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were sought using a Hispanic BRCA mutation testing panel. All mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing.  Results:   Fifteen mutations were identified (two in BRCA2 and thirteen in BRCA1) representing 15.6% of the total (95% CI: 7.8% to 21.3%). Among the 15 mutation-positive families there were nine breast-ovarian cancer families, one gastric cancer family, one prostate cancer family, three uterine cancer families, and one family with no history of cancer. A single founder mutation in BRCA1 (3450del4) was seen in 11 patients.  Conclusion:   In summary, BRCA1 founder mutations are common in Colombian women with ovarian cancer.

In unselected patients, some serious comorbidities have been shown to be associated with a 10-year competing mortality rate clearly superseding the 50% level. The present study shows that it is hardly possible to discern meaningful subsets of patients with a 10-year risk of competing mortality of >50% by using comorbidity classifications.

Patients and methods:   • In all, 2205 consecutive patients who underwent RP for clinically localized prostate cancer between 1992 and 2005 were studied. The 10-year cumulative competing mortality rates were determined in several worst-case scenarios formed by using comorbidity classifications and combinations of them.  Results:   • In this sample of men selected for RP, even those with the most severe comorbidity level had a competing mortality risk of <50% ≤ 10 years after RP. • Depending on the comorbidity classification used, the 10-year cumulative competing mortality rates differed between 16 and 39% in the whole sample and between 18 and 48% in men aged ≥ 65 years.

Active surveillance is a management option in patients with localized prostate cancer. One concern is the possible psychological burden and quality-of-life effects caused by consciousness of living with untreated cancer. Previous studies have reported controversial results about the impact of active surveillance on patient's health-related quality of life. The data of the present study support the idea that patients with low-risk prostate cancer manage well on active surveillance and do not develop short-term mental or physical quality-of-life sequelae.  Objective:   To analyse longitudinal changes in general, mental and physical health-related quality of life (HRQL) and urinary and erectile function in patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PC) on active surveillance (AS).  Patients and methods:   Patients comprised those (n= 124) enrolled in the Finnish arm of the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) study who were followed for at least 1 year (n= 80). All patients with PC received validated questionnaires at the start of surveillance and after 1 year of follow-up. General HRQL was assessed with the RAND 36-Item Health Survey (RAND-36), erectile function with the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), and urinary symptoms with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaires. Results were also compared with an age-stratified general Finnish male population. A paired t-test served to compare results over time and a non-paired t-test or a corresponding non-parametric test, when applicable, served to compare the study group with the general population. Pearson and Spearman correlations were analysed between possible HRQL-affecting factors (demographic and clinical data) and HRQL data, followed by linear regression analysis to further evaluate any possible associations.  Results:   Of the 124 patients, 105 (85%) returned the baseline RAND-36 questionnaire, and 75 (94%) of the 80 patients answered both the baseline and follow-up questionnaires; 15 patients (12%) had discontinued AS, all for protocol-based reasons, none due to anxiety or distress. No differences existed in the HRQL main categories at the 1-year follow-up (mental and physical: P= 0.142 and P= 0.154, respectively). When all the eight dimensions were analysed separately, the physical role showed statistically significant improvement from a mean of 81 to a mean of 89 (P= 0.010). No clinically significant correlations appeared between HRQL and age, diagnostic prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free PSA or PSA change during follow-up at any of the time points; in regression analysis, HRQL was not predictable by any of the variables available at diagnosis or during follow-up. No statistically significant changes occurred in urinary function as analysed by the IPSS (P= 0.121) or in erectile function by the IIEF-5 questionnaire (P= 0.583). Compared with an age-stratified Finnish general male population, patients with PC on AS had a significantly better general mental and physical HRQL at diagnosis and after 1 year of follow-up (P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Active surveillance does not provoke short-term quality-of-life disturbances as assessed by standardized RAND-36, IIEF-5 and IPSS questionnaires. None of the patients changed treatment due to anxiety. Unexpectedly, PC patients on AS had significantly better general mental and physical HRQL than did a general age-stratified Finnish male population.""","""['Hanna Vasarainen', 'Utku Lokman', 'Mirja Ruutu', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Antti Rannikko']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Health-related quality of life in early breast cancer.', 'Effects of prostate cancer screening on health-related quality of life: results of the Finnish arm of the European randomized screening trial (ERSPC).', 'Health-related quality of life in children and adolescents who have a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.', 'How does active surveillance for prostate cancer affect quality of life?

Although interleukin-32 (IL-32) is endogenously expressed in NK cells, cytolytic function of NK cells against cancer cells has not been fully demonstrated. In the present study, we found that the growth of cancer cells was suppressed when colon cancer cells or prostate cancer cells were co-cultured with NK-92 cells, an NK cell line. We also found that the expression of tumour necrosis factor receptor 2 and death receptor 3 (DR3) was increased in PC3 cells, and the expression of FAS and DR3 was increased in SW620 cells by co-culture with NK-92 cells. However, cancer cell growth inhibition and IL-32 expression were abolished when cancer cells were co-cultured with NK cells transfected with small interfering (si) RNA of IL-32. DR3 expression was also diminished by co-culture with IL-32-specific siRNA-transfected NK-92 cells. Expression of APO3L, a ligand of DR3, was elevated in NK cells that were co-cultured with cancer cells. It was also found that expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as cleaved caspase-3 and bax was increased in cancer cells co-cultured with NK-92 cells, but their expression was abolished by co-culture with IL-32 siRNA-transfected NK-92 cells. Moreover, knockdown of DR3 in co-culture of NK-92 cells with cancer cells by siRNA or antibodies of DR3 and APO3L reversed the growth inhibitory effect of NK-92 cells.

Intracellular redox is maintained by coupled reactions involving NADPH, glutathione (GSH), and vitamin C, as well as their corresponding oxidized counterparts. In addition to functioning as enzyme cofactors, these reducing agents have a critical role in dealing with reactive oxygen species (ROS), the toxic products of oxidative metabolism seen as culprits in aging, neurodegenerative disease, and ischemia/ reperfusion injury. Despite this strong relationship between redox and human disease, methods to interrogate a redox pair in vivo are limited. Here we report the development of [1-(13)C] dehydroascorbate [DHA], the oxidized form of Vitamin C, as an endogenous redox sensor for in vivo imaging using hyperpolarized (13)C spectroscopy. In murine models, hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] DHA was rapidly converted to [1-(13)C] vitamin C within the liver, kidneys, and brain, as well as within tumor in a transgenic prostate cancer mouse. This result is consistent with what has been previously described for the DHA/Vitamin C redox pair, and points to a role for hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] DHA in characterizing the concentrations of key intracellular reducing agents, including GSH. More broadly, these findings suggest a prognostic role for this new redox sensor in determining vulnerability of both normal and abnormal tissues to ROS.""","""['Kayvan R Keshari', 'John Kurhanewicz', 'Robert Bok', 'Peder E Z Larson', 'Daniel B Vigneron', 'David M Wilson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Hyperpolarized 1-13Cdehydroascorbate MR spectroscopy in a murine model of prostate cancer: comparison with 18F-FDG PET.', 'Noninvasive in vivo imaging of diabetes-induced renal oxidative stress and response to therapy using hyperpolarized 13C dehydroascorbate magnetic resonance.', 'Imaging glutathione depletion in the rat brain using ascorbate-derived hyperpolarized MR and PET probes.', 'Hyperpolarized 1-13Cdehydroascorbic acid.', 'Cellular pathways for transport and efflux of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate.', 'Oxidative stress in multiple sclerosis-Emerging imaging techniques.', 'Metabolic analysis as a driver for discovery, diagnosis, and therapy.', 'Hyperpolarized carbon 13 MRI in liver diseases: Recent advances and future opportunities.', 'Hypoxia Imaging As a Guide for Hypoxia-Modulated and Hypoxia-Activated Therapy.', 'Latest Advances in Imaging Oxidative Stress in Cancer.']"""

Results:   The mean pre-procedural level of state anxiety score was well correlated with the visual analog scale score (r=0.498; P < 0.001). The mean level of state anxiety scores before biopsy (39.7±9.4) and before getting the result (39.9±8.4) were significantly higher than the mean level of state anxiety score when the procedure was requested (31.4±7.9) (P < 0.001 for both).

We also investigated the association of disease-related and socio-demographic factors and job-related resources (organizational climate, social support, and avoidance behavior) with work ability and looked at whether these associations were different for the survivors and reference subjects.  Methods:   Working aged cancer patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2002 were identified from hospital or cancer registries in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Norway (Nordic Study on Cancer and Work). A cancer-free reference group was selected from population registries. We collected information on work ability and other factors from 1,490 employed survivors and 2,796 reference subjects via a questionnaire.  Results:   The adjusted mean value of work ability was slightly lower among the breast and prostate cancer survivors compared to the cancer-free population. Co-morbidity, chemotherapy, low workplace support, and low organizational commitment were associated with reduced work ability. Avoidance behavior from supervisors or colleagues was only related to work ability among the cancer survivors.  Conclusions and implications:   More attention should be paid to assisting cancer survivors in work life, particularly those who have chronic diseases or have undergone chemotherapy. Although most factors affecting the work ability of the survivors and reference subjects were the same, survivors' work ability seemed to be particularly sensitive to avoidance behavior.

Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) has emerged as a predictor of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We sought to define the utility of PCA3 in combination with other clinical data in predicting the risk of prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. We retrospectively obtained PCA3, PSA, PSA density (PSAD), digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings from 103 patients at a single institution who had at least one prior negative prostate biopsy. The sensitivity and specificity of PCA3 in detecting prostate cancer was determined. Receiver operating characteristics curves were produced for each variable individually and in multivariable analysis, controlling for PCA3, PSAD, TRUS, PSA and DRE. A nomogram was created, internally validated and compared to another recently published nomogram.  Results:   Of the 103 patients, 37 (31%) had prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. The sensitivity and specificity of PCA3 (using a cut point of 25) was 0.67 and 0.64, respectively. In multivariable analyses, PCA3 was independently associated with prostate cancer (odds ratio: 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.04), with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64. A multivariable model containing PCA3, PSAD, PSA, DRE and TRUS findings showed the most diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.82).

Materials and methods:   Group A comprised 25 consecutive patients who underwent RRP immediately prior to the acquisition of a cell saver machine. Group B consisted of the next 25 consecutive patients undergoing surgery using the Dideco Electa (Sorin Group, Italy) cell saver machine.

At therapeutic 100 nM concentration simvastatin had a cytostatic effect on normal cells: apoptosis was only slightly induced, but a decrease in cell cycle activity and an increase in senescence were observed. At therapeutic concentrations, lipophilic simvastatin caused a stronger growth inhibition than did hydrophilic rosuvastatin. In contrast, 10 μM simvastatin had a cytotoxic effect both on normal and cancer cells. Addition of LDL-cholesterol effectively reversed the cytostatic effect in all cell lines, but overcoming the cytotoxicity of 10 μM simvastatin required a combination of LDL-cholesterol and mevalonate. As LDL-cholesterol completely prevented the growth-inhibiting effect of therapeutic-dose simvastatin already at low, subphysiological concentrations it is unlikely that statins have direct effects on growth of prostate epithelial cells in vivo. Statins' possible benefits against prostate cancer could be due to systemic cholesterol-lowering, as suggested by epidemiological studies. Future clinical studies evaluating the effects of statins on prostate cancer prevention should monitor serum LDL and should probably administer statins at higher concentrations than those currently used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.""","""['Teemu J Murtola', 'Heimo Syvälä', 'Pasi Pennanen', 'Merja Bläuer', 'Tiina Solakivi', 'Timo Ylikomi', 'Teuvo L J Tammela']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Effects of simvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid, and rosiglitazone on proliferation of normal and cancerous prostate epithelial cells at therapeutic concentrations.', 'Anticancer efficacy of simvastatin on prostate cancer cells and tumor xenografts is associated with inhibition of Akt and reduced prostate-specific antigen expression.', 'Statin induces apoptosis and cell growth arrest in prostate cancer cells.', 'Meta-analysis of comparative efficacy of increasing dose of Atorvastatin versus Rosuvastatin versus Simvastatin on lowering levels of atherogenic lipids (from VOYAGER).', 'Pharmacologic options for aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering: benefits versus risks.', 'Paradoxical effects of statins on endothelial and cancer cells: the impact of concentrations.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment."", 'Inverse Association between Statin Use and Cancer Mortality Relates to Cholesterol Level.']"""

Until now, only (99m)Tc-labeled HYNIC-rh-annexin A5 has been extensively studied in clinical trials. In the ongoing search for an alternative imaging agent, we synthesized a series of fluorescent zinc-cyclen complexes as annexin A5 mimics and studied structural variations on the uptake behavior of cells undergoing apoptosis/necrosis. The number of cyclen chelators was varied and the spacer separating cyclen from the central scaffold was modified. Five zinc-cyclen complexes were labeled with fluorescein for flow cytometric studies and one was labeled with (18)F for in vivo applications. Jurkat cells were treated with staurosporine to induce apoptosis/necrosis, incubated with the fluorescein-labeled zinc complexes and analyzed them by flow cytometry. Fluorescent annexin A5 and propidium iodide were applied as reference dyes. Flow cytometry revealed greater accumulation of zinc-cyclen complexes in staurosporine treated cells. The uptake was contingent on the presence of zinc and the fluorescence intensity was dependent on the number of zinc-cyclen groups. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed the {bis[Zn(cyclen)]}(4+) complex distributed throughout the cytosol different to annexin A5. Owing to the structural similarity of the bis-cyclen ligands with CXCR4 binding bis-cyclam derivatives the zinc-cyclen complex uptake was challenged with the meta derivative of AMD3100. Lack of uptake depletion in staurosporine treated cells ruled out measurable CXCR4 interaction. PET imaging using the (18)F labeled zinc-cyclen complex revealed significantly higher uptake in an irradiated Dunning R3327-AT1 prostate tumor as compared to the contralateral control tumor. PET imaging of a HelaMatu tumor model additionally showed an increased uptake after taxol treatment.

Unfortunately, results with N-terminal inhibitors from initial clinical trials have been disappointing, as toxicity and resistance resulting from induction of the heat shock response (HSR) has led to both scheduling and administration concerns. Therefore, Hsp90 inhibitors that do not induce the heat shock response represent a promising new direction for the treatment of prostate cancer. Herein, the development of a C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitor, KU174, is described, which demonstrates anti-cancer activity in prostate cancer cells in the absence of a HSR and describe a novel approach to characterize Hsp90 inhibition in cancer cells.  Methods:   PC3-MM2 and LNCaP-LN3 cells were used in both direct and indirect in vitro Hsp90 inhibition assays (DARTS, Surface Plasmon Resonance, co-immunoprecipitation, luciferase, Western blot, anti-proliferative, cytotoxicity and size exclusion chromatography) to characterize the effects of KU174 in prostate cancer cells. Pilot in vivo efficacy studies were also conducted with KU174 in PC3-MM2 xenograft studies.  Results:   KU174 exhibits robust anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activity along with client protein degradation and disruption of Hsp90 native complexes without induction of a HSR. Furthermore, KU174 demonstrates direct binding to the Hsp90 protein and Hsp90 complexes in cancer cells. In addition, in pilot in-vivo proof-of-concept studies KU174 demonstrates efficacy at 75 mg/kg in a PC3-MM2 rat tumor model.

Cancer chemopreventive response to PEITC is characterized by its ability to inhibit multiple oncogenic signaling pathways, including nuclear factor-κB, Akt, and androgen receptor. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that PEITC treatment activates Notch signaling in malignant as well as normal human prostate cells. Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145) and a normal human prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC) to PEITC resulted in cleavage (active form) of Notch1 and Notch2, and increased transcriptional activity of Notch. In PC-3 and LNCaP cells, PEITC treatment caused induction of Notch ligands Jagged1 and Jagged2 (PC-3), overexpression of γ-secretase complex components Presenilin1 and Nicastrin (PC-3), nuclear enrichment of cleaved Notch2, and/or up-regulation of Notch1, Notch2, Jagged1, and/or Jagged2 mRNA. PEITC-induced apoptosis in LNCaP and PC-3 cells was significantly attenuated by RNA interference of Notch2, but not by pharmacological inhibition of Notch1. Inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell migration resulting from PEITC exposure was significantly augmented by knockdown of Notch2 protein as well as pharmacological inhibition of Notch1 activation. Nuclear expression of cleaved Notch2 protein was significantly higher in PC-3 xenografts from PEITC-treated mice and dorsolateral prostates from PEITC-fed TRAMP mice compared with respective control. Because Notch signaling is implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis, the present study suggests that anti-metastatic effect of PEITC may be augmented by a combination regimen involving a Notch inhibitor.""","""['Su-Hyeong Kim', 'Anuradha Sehrawat', 'Kozue Sakao', 'Eun-Ryeong Hahm', 'Shivendra V Singh']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Notch activation is dispensable for D, L-sulforaphane-mediated inhibition of human prostate cancer cell migration.', 'Notch2 activation by benzyl isothiocyanate impedes its inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell migration.', 'Phenethyl isothiocyanate inhibits oxidative phosphorylation to trigger reactive oxygen species-mediated death of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate cancer chemopreventive activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate through epigenetic regulation (review).', 'Notch signaling in prostate cancer: a moving target.', 'Polyphenolics, glucosinolates and isothiocyanates profiling of aerial parts of Nasturtium officinale (Watercress).', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Evaluation of Bioactive Properties of Lipophilic Fractions of Edible and Non-Edible Parts of Nasturtium officinale (Watercress) in a Model of Human Malignant Melanoma Cells.', 'Recent progress in natural dietary non-phenolic bioactives on cancers metastasis.', 'Delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER) orchestrates stemness and cancer progression in prostate cancer.']"""

Previous studies report that Wnt5a is upregulated in prostate cancer and suggested that Wnt5a affects migration and invasion of prostate tumor cell. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of Wnt5a protein expression in prostate cancer tissue and its potential to predict outcome after radical prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate cancer.  Methodology and results:   Immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray containing prostate specimens of 503 patients with localized prostate cancer showed significantly higher Wnt5a protein expression in cancer compared to benign cores from the same patients (p<0.0001). Patients with high expression of Wnt5a protein had significantly better outcome in terms of time to biochemical recurrence compared to patients with low expression levels (p = 0.001, 95%CI 1.361-3.570, Hazard's ratio 2.204). A combination of high Wnt5a expression with low levels of Ki-67 or androgen receptor expression had even better outcome compared to all other groups. Furthermore, we found that Wnt5a expression significantly correlated with VEGF and with Ki-67 and androgen receptor expression, although not highly significant. In vitro, we demonstrated that recombinant Wnt5a decreased invasion of 22Rv1 and DU145 cells and that siRNA knockdown of endogenous Wnt5a protein led to increased invasion of 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells.  Conclusion:   We demonstrate that preserved overexpression of Wnt5a protein in patients with localized prostate cancer predicts a favorable outcome after surgery. This finding together with our in vitro data demonstrating the ability of Wnt5a to impair the invasive properties of prostate cancer cells, suggests a tumor suppressing effect of Wnt5a in localized prostate cancer. These results indicate that Wnt5a can be used as a predictive marker and that it also is a plausible therapeutic target for treatment of localized prostate cancer.""","""['Azharuddin Sajid Syed Khaja', 'Leszek Helczynski', 'Anders Edsjö', 'Roy Ehrnström', 'Anna Lindgren', 'David Ulmert', 'Tommy Andersson', 'Anders Bjartell']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Emphasizing the role of Wnt5a protein expression to predict favorable outcome after radical prostatectomy in patients with low-grade prostate cancer.', 'Wnt5a signaling is involved in the aggressiveness of prostate cancer and expression of metalloproteinase.', 'Regulation of prostate cancer cell migration toward bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned medium by Wnt5a signaling.', 'Angiogenesis, p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in the progression of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Insight into the role of Wnt5a-induced signaling in normal and cancer cells.', 'Validation and analysis of expression, prognosis and immune infiltration of WNT gene family in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'The IGSF1, Wnt5a, FGF14, and ITPR1 Gene Expression and Prognosis Hallmark of Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'High stroma-derived WNT5A is an indicator for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Wnt5a expression and prognosis in stage II-III colon cancer.']"""

Identifying reliable biomarkers for predicting cancer treatment response needs understanding of all aspects of cancer cell death and survival. Galectin-3 and Beclin1 are involved in two coordinated pathways of programmed cell death, apoptosis and autophagy and are linked to necroptosis/necrosis. The aim of the study was to quantify galectin-3 and Beclin1 mRNA in human cancer tissue cDNA panels and determine their utility as biomarkers of cancer cell survival.  Methods and results:   A panel of 96 cDNAs from eight (8) different normal and cancer tissue types were used for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using ABI7900HT. Miner2.0, a web-based 4- and 3-parameter logistic regression software was used to derive individual well polymerase chain reaction efficiencies (E) and cycle threshold (Ct) values. Miner software derived formula was used to calculate mRNA levels and then fold changes. The ratios of cancer to normal tissue levels of galectin-3 and Beclin1 were calculated (using the mean for each tissue type). Relative mRNA expressions for galectin-3 were higher than for Beclin1 in all tissue (normal and cancer) types. In cancer tissues, breast, kidney, thyroid and prostate had the highest galectin-3 mRNA levels compared to normal tissues. High levels of Beclin1 mRNA levels were in liver and prostate cancers when compared to normal tissues. Breast, kidney and thyroid cancers had high galectin-3 levels and low Beclin1 levels.  Conclusion:   Galectin-3 expression patterns in normal and cancer tissues support its reported roles in human cancer.

The study of cancer cell dormancy is severely hampered by the lack of biological samples so that the mechanisms that regulate cell dormancy have not been extensively explored. In this work, we describe the rapid induction in vitro of a dormant state in prostate cancer cells by exposure to a slightly hypertonic growth medium. This quiescence is observed only when cells are seeded at low density and, once established, requires additional stimuli besides osmotic pressure to be reversed. Media conditioned by cells grown at high density can partially prevent or reverse dormancy, a phenomenon which can be reproduced with citric acid. In addition to this role of small metabolites, inactivation of the p53 and smad pathways also counters the entry into dormancy, whereas exposure to activin A induces it to some extent.

Mutated p53 (mp53) has been suggested to switch TGF-β to a tumor promoter. However, we found that mp53 does not always promote the oncogenic role of TGF-β. Here, we show that endogenous mp53 knockdown enhanced cell migration and phosphorylation of ERK in DU145 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of mp53 in p53-null PC-3 prostate cancer cells enhanced Smad-dependent signaling but inhibited TGF-β-induced cell migration by down-regulating activated ERK. Reactivation of ERK by the expression of its activator, MEK-1, restored TGF-β-induced cell migration. Because TGF-β is known to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway through direct phosphorylation of the adaptor protein ShcA and MAPK/ERK signaling is pivotal to tumor progression, we investigated whether ShcA contributed to mp53-induced ERK inhibition and the conversion of the role of TGF-β during carcinogenesis. We found that mp53 expression led to a decrease of phosphorylated p52ShcA/ERK levels and an increase of phosphorylated Smad levels in a panel of mp53-expressing cancer cell lines and in mammary glands and tumors from mp53 knock-in mice. By manipulating ShcA levels to regulate ERK and Smad signaling in human untransformed and cancer cell lines, we showed that the role of TGF-β in regulating anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and migration can be shifted between growth suppression and migration promotion.

Although some types of TLRs are also expressed in cancer cells, the effects and mechanisms of TLR signaling in cancer cells have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a TLR3 ligand, on three TLR3-expressing human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, and DU145). We then further characterized the underlying mechanisms, focusing on the poly(I:C)-sensitive LNCaP cell line. Poly(I:C) significantly reduced the viability of LNCaP cells TLR3 and endosome dependently. One mechanism for the antitumor effect was caspase-dependent apoptosis, and another mechanism was poly(I:C)-induced growth arrest. Cell survival and proliferation of LNCaP cells depended on the PI3K/Akt pathway, and PI3K/Akt inhibitors induced apoptosis and growth arrest similar to poly(I:C) treatment. Additionally, poly(I:C) treatment caused dephosphorylation of Akt in LNCaP cells, but transduction of the constitutively active form of Akt rendered LNCaP cells resistant to poly(I:C). Immunoblot analysis of proliferation- and apoptosis-related molecules in poly(I:C)-treated LNCaP cells revealed participation of cyclinD1, c-Myc, p53, and NOXA. Interestingly, poly(I:C) treatment of LNCaP cells was accompanied by autophagy, which was cytoprotective toward poly(I:C)-induced apoptosis. Together, these findings indicate that TLR3 signaling triggers apoptosis and growth arrest of LNCaP cells partially through inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and that treatment-associated autophagy plays a cytoprotective role.""","""['Nanae Harashima', 'Tohko Inao', 'Ryu Imamura', 'Shinji Okano', 'Takashi Suda', 'Mamoru Harada']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Toll-like receptor 3 triggers apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells through a PKC-alpha-dependent mechanism.', ""Involvement of Bcl-2 family members, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT and mitochondrial p53 in curcumin (diferulolylmethane)-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer."", 'Growth hormone (GH) receptors in prostate cancer: gene expression in human tissues and cell lines and characterization, GH signaling and androgen receptor regulation in LNCaP cells.', 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway in prostate cancer: challenges and opportunities (review).', 'Exploiting poly(I:C) to induce cancer cell apoptosis.', 'Rintatolimod: a potential treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer expressing Toll-like receptor 3.', 'TL-532, a novel specific Toll-like receptor 3 agonist rationally designed for targeting cancers: discovery process and biological characterization.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Immune mechanisms behind prostate cancer in men of African ancestry: A review.', 'Immunotherapeutic role of cabazitaxel treatment in the activation of TLR3 signalling in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in vitro.']"""

Normal tissues from the PZ and the TZ of 20 PCA patients were laser microdissected to separate glands from stroma. Two oligo microarrays were performed in order to investigate the variation in ETS family gene expression between the glands and the stroma of the two zones. The ETS members, ELF-3, ELF-5, ERG, ETV-1, ETV-4, ETV-5, ETV-7 and FEV, were found to be differentially expressed. A striking observation was that ERG and ETV-1 were found to be up-regulated in the glands of the PZ compared to the TZ, particularly when considering that ERG and ETV-1 fusions account for 50-80% and 20% of PCA occurrences, respectively.

In xenografted tumors, we observed that TSP1 altogether inhibited angiogenesis and fostered tumor development. Our results show that TSP1 is a potent stimulator of prostate tumor cell migration. This effect required CD36, which also mediates TSP1 antiangiogenic activity, and was mimicked by an antiangiogenic TSP1-derived peptide. As suspected for pharmacologic inhibitors of angiogenesis, the TSP1 capacities to increase hypoxia and to trigger cell migration are thus inherently linked. Importantly, although antiangiogenic TSP1 increases hypoxia in vivo, our data show that, in turn, hypoxia induced TSP1, thus generating a vicious circle in prostate tumors. In radical prostatectomy specimens, we found TSP1 expression significantly associated with invasive tumors and with tumors which eventually recurred.

Patients and methods:   Data from 191 patients treated with 30 Gy/10 fractions were matched to 191 patients (1:1) receiving higher doses (37.5 Gy/15 fractions or 40 Gy/20 fractions). All patients had favorable survival prognoses based on a validated scoring system and were matched for age, gender, tumor type, performance status, number of involved vertebrae, visceral or other bone metastases, interval from tumor diagnosis to radiotherapy, ambulatory status, and time developing motor deficits. Both groups were compared for local control, progression-free survival, overall survival, and functional outcome.  Results:   Local control rates at 2 years were 71% after 30 Gy and 92% after higher doses (p=0.012). Two-year progression-free survival rates were 68% and 90%, respectively (p=0.013).

However, current strategies including surgery and conventional radiotherapy are compromised by high rates of long-term genitourinary adverse effects. Therefore, a planning study combining organ preserving surgery with three different innovative adjuvant radiotherapy approaches was performed.  Patients and methods:   A case of a 21-month-old boy with BP-RMS treated with polychemotherapy according to the CWS 2002-P protocol, prostatectomy, partial cystectomy, and adjuvant high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) was used to perform a planning study comparing HDR-BT with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) planning.  Results:   All modalities provide good coverage of the target volume and spare critical normal tissues. Rectum doses could be reduced by 2/3 using IMPT and by 1/3 using BT compared to IMRT. In terms of sparing the pelvis growth plates, BT and IMPT are also superior to IMRT.  Conclusion:   All modalities provide good sparing of normal tissue.

The ability to identify the free PSA fraction associated with PCa could increase the reliability of the PSA diagnostic test. Here we present the crystal structure of human PSA from seminal fluid in a sandwich complex with two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). MAb 5D5A5 captures total PSA with exceptionally high affinity, and mAb 5D3D11 selectively discriminates between free PSA subforms that are more abundant in sera from patients with PCa. Although the antigen is not of seric origin, several insights into cancer diagnosis can be discerned from this complex. MAb 5D3D11 recognizes a PSA conformation different from that previously reported. Interacting with the kallikrein loop, the PSA N-linked glycan attached to asparagine 61 is an uncommonly complex sialated triantennary chain. O-linked glycosylation is observed at threonine 125. The description of how PSA subforms in prostatic fluid can be discriminated using pairs of antibodies is a first step in the design of new strategies that are capable of real discrimination among PSA subforms, which will lead to the formulation of more reliable diagnostic tests.

Our results showed that NK-18 (with 18 amino acids) possesses potent antitumor activity against bladder and prostate cancer cells by disrupting the integrity of cell membrane, but has negligible hemolysis activity against mouse erythrocytes. In addition, CD spectra was employed to study its conformation in membrane mimicking environment. NK-18 takes a standard α-helical conformation in membrane mimicking environment, which could be accounted for its more potent antitumor activity compared with its low α-helical content homologous derivatives.

Materials and methods:   Blocks and slides of prostate specimens received at the Department of Anatomical Pathology, University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital between January 1997 and December 2006 were retrospectively selected for this study. The slides were studied using a binocular Olympus light microscope. Patients' age at presentation, presenting symptoms, and clinical diagnosis were sorted out from the request cards and the department's archival register.  Results:   Carcinoma was diagnosed in 198 specimens (37.4%) of the 529 cases reviewed. Of these, 164 (82.8%) were clinical carcinoma (having been found in clinically suspected carcinoma cases for which trucut biopsies were undertaken), while 34 (17.2%) were incidental carcinoma cases (being found in prostatectomy biopsy cases of patients clinically diagnosed with nodular hyperplasia). All of the clinical carcinomas were adenocarcinomas predominantly moderately differentiated and of large acinar pattern. Also, all of the incidental carcinomas were adenocarcinomas predominantly well differentiated and of large acinar pattern. The Gleason scores (GSs) were varied but predominantly of high values, particularly with clinical carcinoma cases. The age range was 42 to 90 years and the mean was 70 years with a peak of 70 to 79 years.  Conclusion:   The incidence of prostate cancer in Port Harcourt is high relative to other Nigerian centers where similar studies have been carried out and compares well with the high incidence found among African American men. Histologically, all cases are acinar adenocarcinomas. Most patients present late with high GS carcinoma and therefore have poor prognosis.

Objective:   Describe the robotic and laparoscopic technique and the short-term outcomes of high extended pelvic LND (PLND) up to the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) during RC.  Design, setting, and participants:   From January 2007 through September 2009, we performed high extended PLND with proximal extent up to the IMA (n=10) or aortic bifurcation (n=5) in 15 patients undergoing robotic RC (n=4) or laparoscopic RC (n=11) at two institutions.  Surgical procedure:   We performed robotic extended PLND with the proximal extent up to the IMA or aortic bifurcation. The LND was performed starting from the right external iliac, obturator, internal iliac, common iliac, preaortic and para-aortic, precaval, and presacral and then proceeding to the left side. The accompanying video highlights our detailed technique.  Measurements:   Median age was 69 yr, body mass index was 26, and American Society of Anesthesiologists class ≥ 3 was present in 40% of patients. All urinary diversions, including orthotopic neobladder (n=5) and ileal conduit (n=10), were performed extracorporeally.  Results and limitations:   All 15 procedures were technically successful without need for conversion to open surgery. Median operative time was 6.7h, estimated blood loss was 500 ml, and three patients (21%) required blood transfusion. Median nodal yield in the entire cohort was 31 (range: 15-78). The IMA group had more nodes retrieved (median: 42.5) compared with the aortic bifurcation group (median: 20.5). Histopathology confirmed nodal metastases in four patients (27%), including three patients in the IMA group and one patient in the aortic bifurcation group. Perioperative complications were recorded in six cases (40%). During a median follow-up of 13 mo, no patient developed local or systemic recurrence. Limitations of the study include its retrospective design and small cohort of patients.  Conclusions:   High extended PLND during laparoscopic or robotic RC is technically feasible.

Methods:   Completeness was estimated by comparing the database of the Tarn cancer registry containing all the inhabitants of this department for whom prostate cancer was diagnosed in 2007 with the list of patients living in Tarn whose cases were discussed during a Midi-Pyrénées MDTM. Determinants of the case discussion in MDTM were studied from data collected in medical records (age, stage at diagnosis, PSA level, Gleason score, treatment). The MDTM quality study (delay in management, whether the case was seen before or after treatment, required elements for MDTM, clinical data, conformity between suggested treatment and guidelines, adequacy between suggested and performed treatments) was based on the MDTM forms retrieved from the DCO and from medical records.  Results:   Four hundred and fifty-nine patients were re-examined. The pretherapeutic passage rate within three months after diagnosis was 56.2%. The probability of a discussion in MDTM decreased for people over 85 years of age (OR=0.10) compared with the 70-74 year-old people and it increased for the N+M+ (OR=4.23) compared with the T1-T2. Patients for whom radiotherapy was considered were presented more frequently than the others. The MDTM quality was studied based on 220 DCO forms.

Leuprolide Acetate (LA) Eligard(®)45mg was the first 6-monthly LHRH agonist (agoniste luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRHa]) treatment available for use in prostate cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the use of the 3-monthly and the 6-monthly LHRHa in patients with prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   A two-step survey (registration and follow-up) was held between July 2008 and January 2009. One hundred and sixty doctors included patients treated with LHRHa for prostate cancer. Then, a follow-up registry was implemented for patients who had been prescribed a 3- or 6-monthly LHRHa.  Results:   Data analysis showed that the 1853 registered patients had a mean age of 75 years old. Time to diagnosis was 7 months. Among them, 26.4% had an N+ and/or M+ cancer. The most tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage represented was T3N0M0 with Gleason score 7. High prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and metastatic stage were the main motives for LHRHa prescription. Choice criteria for a 3 or a 6-monthly LHRHa were patient autonomy (3.2 vs 18.4%), age (27.2 vs 44%) and anxiety (28 vs 16.8%). Patients for 6-monthly LHRHa were likely to be with low urinary symptoms, older, less autonomous and less anxious. The reported advantage of the 3-monthly LHRHa was the high satisfying quality of medical follow-up. For the 6-monthly form, the advantages were the flexibility and the freedom to stop worrying about their cancer for up to 6 months.  Conclusion:   The 6-monthly LHRHa provides more flexibility in the management and follow-up of patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['I Ouzaid', 'M Rouprêt']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prog Urol""","""['Intermittent androgen suppression for locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer: preliminary report of a prospective multicenter study.', 'The long-term results with delayed-combined androgen blockade therapy in local or locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Effectiveness of cyproterone acetate in achieving castration and preventing luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue induced testosterone surge in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Combined androgen blockade: the gold standard for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Expert opinion on 6-monthly luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist treatment with the single-sphere depot system for prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy of Leuprorelide acetate (Eligard®) in daily practice in Brazil: a retrospective study with depot formulations in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Selection criteria for initiation and renewal of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy in patients with prostate cancer: a French prospective observational study.', 'Efficacy and tolerability of 1- and 3-month leuprorelin acetate depot formulations (Eligard(®)/Depo-Eligard(®)) for advanced prostate cancer in daily practice: a Belgian prospective non-interventional study.', 'Leuprolide acetate 1-, 3- and 6-monthly depot formulations in androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer in nine European countries: evidence review and economic evaluation.', 'Six-month leuprorelin acetate depot formulations in advanced prostate cancer: a clinical evaluation.']"""

All of these cases were diagnosed by one of the authors and all were sent in as a final diagnosis for which the outside pathologist was not requesting consultation because of difficulty with the diagnosis. The Gleason grades assigned to these cases at our institution were compared with the grade rendered by the submitting pathologists from the outside institution.  Results:   In 146 (48.7%) of the cases, Gleason pattern 5 was not identified by the outside pathologists. Of the 146 cases, the outside Gleason score was ≤7 in 61 (20.3%) and 4+4=8 in 85 (28.4%).

High doses of radiotherapy correspond to higher cure rates. Most radiation centers in the UK and Australia limit prescription doses to 74-78 Gy and do not use IGRT and IMRT for all patients. The combination of IGRT and IMRT can limit the rectum and bladder to low doses allowing doses above 78 Gy to be delivered, including pelvic lymph node treatment, with low side effects. This paper provides a detailed guide of planning technique and expected toxicity to enable implementation of similar dose escalated prostate programmes in other radiotherapy centres.  Objective:   To determine the short-term side-effects of dose-escalated image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) for the definitive treatment of prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Eligible patients were treated at doses >78 Gy and with definitive intent. Patients from a prospective database with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (CTCAE) toxicity were recorded weekly during treatment and at follow-up.  Results:   In all, 101 patients were included, with doses ranging from 78.3 to 84 Gy (median = 79.3). The median (range) age was 71 (46-83) years; 60% received concurrent androgen deprivation and 35% had pelvic lymph node treatment. The median (range) IPSS at baseline, on treatment and at first follow-up were 7 (0-35), 15 (1-34) and 6 (0-30), respectively. The percentages of patients with grade 2 or higher toxicity during treatment, at 3 months and at 2 years were, respectively, 6.9%, 1% and 2% for gastrointestinal symptoms and 39%, 6.9% and 3% for genitourinary symptoms. There was no significant difference in gastrointestinal toxicity during treatment (P= 0.860) or at 3 months (P= 0.334) between patients with and without lymph node treatment.

We report on toxicity symptoms experienced during radiotherapy treatment, with and without IGRT in prostate cancer patients treated radically.  Methods:   Between 2006 and 2009, acute toxicity data for ten symptoms were collected prospectively onto standardized assessment forms. Toxicity was scored during radiotherapy, according to the Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events V3.0, for 275 prostate cancer patients before and after the implementation of a fiducial marker IGRT program and dose escalation from 74 Gy in 37 fractions, to 78 Gy in 39 fractions. Margins and planning constraints were maintained the same during the study period. The symptoms scored were urinary frequency, cystitis, bladder spasm, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, diarrhoea, haemorrhoids, proctitis, anal skin discomfort and fatigue. Analysis was conducted for the maximum grade of toxicity and the median number of days from the onset of that toxicity to the end of treatment.  Results:   In the IGRT group, 14228 toxicity scores were analysed from 249 patients. In the non-IGRT group, 1893 toxicity scores were analysed from 26 patients. Urinary frequency ≥G3 affected 23% and 7% in the non-IGRT and IGRT group respectively (p = 0.0188). Diarrhoea ≥G2 affected 15% and 3% of patients in the non-IGRT and IGRT groups (p = 0.0174). Fatigue ≥G2 affected 23% and 8% of patients in the non-IGRT and IGRT groups (p = 0.0271). The median number of days with a toxicity was higher for ≥G2 (p = 0.0179) and ≥G3 frequency (p = 0.0027), ≥G2 diarrhoea (p = 0.0033) and ≥G2 fatigue (p = 0.0088) in the non-IGRT group compared to the IGRT group. Other toxicities were not of significant statistical difference.  Conclusions:   In this study, prostate cancer patients treated radically with IGRT had less severe urinary frequency, diarrhoea and fatigue during treatment compared to patients treated with non-IGRT.

In addition, prostate cancer bone metastases often become resistant to standard therapies including androgen deprivation, radiation and chemotherapy. There are currently few models to elucidate mechanisms of interaction between the bone microenvironment and prostate cancer. It is, thus, essential to develop new patient-derived, orthotopic models. Here we report the development and characterization of PCSD1 (Prostate Cancer San Diego 1), a novel patient-derived intra-femoral xenograft model of prostate bone metastatic cancer that recapitulates mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions.  Methods:   A femoral bone metastasis of prostate cancer was removed during hemiarthroplasty and transplanted into Rag2(-/-);γc(-/-) mice either intra-femorally or sub-cutaneously. Xenograft tumors that developed were analyzed for prostate cancer biomarker expression using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Osteoblastic, osteolytic and mixed lesion formation was measured using micro-computed tomography (microCT).  Results:   PCSD1 cells isolated directly from the patient formed tumors in all mice that were transplanted intra-femorally or sub-cutaneously into Rag2(-/-);γc(-/-) mice. Xenograft tumors expressed human prostate specific antigen (PSA) in RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses. PCSD1 tumors also expressed AR, NKX3.1, Keratins 8 and 18, and AMACR. Histologic and microCT analyses revealed that intra-femoral PCSD1 xenograft tumors formed mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions. PCSD1 tumors have been serially passaged in mice as xenografts intra-femorally or sub-cutaneously as well as grown in culture.  Conclusions:   PCSD1 xenografts tumors were characterized as advanced, luminal epithelial prostate cancer from a bone metastasis using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical biomarker analyses. PCSD1 intra-femoral xenografts formed mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions that closely resembled the bone lesions in the patient.

Taking cold-cup mapping biopsies from different areas of the bladder (BMAP) is commonly used in patients at risk of harbouring CIS. The diagnostic accuracy of this approach has not been assessed until now. By using the CIS found in the cystoprostatectomy specimen as an indicator of the true occurrence of CIS and comparing that with the findings of BMAP, it is clear that the sensitivity of BMAP to detect CIS when present is low and that negative findings should be considered unreliable.  Objectives:   To assess the value of bladder mapping and prostatic urethra biopsies for detection of urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS). CIS of the urinary bladder is a flat high-grade lesion of the mucosa associated with a significant risk of progression to muscle-invasive disease. CIS is difficult to identify on cystoscopy, and definite diagnosis requires histopathology. Traditionally, if CIS is suspected, multiple cold-cup biopsies are taken from the bladder mucosa, and resection biopsies are obtained from the prostatic urethra in males. This approach is often called bladder mapping (BMAP). The accuracy of BMAP as a diagnostic tool is not known.  Patients and methods:   Male patients with bladder cancer scheduled for cystectomy underwent cold-cup bladder biopsies (sidewalls, posterior wall, dome, trigone), and resection biopsies were taken from the prostatic urethra. After cystectomy, the surgical specimen was investigated in a standardised manner and subsequently compared with the BMAP biopsies for the presence of CIS.  Results:   The histopathology reports of 162 patients were analysed. CIS was detected in 46% of the cystoprostatectomy specimens, and multiple (≥2) CIS lesions were found in 30%. BMAP (cold-cup bladder biopsies + resection biopsies from the prostatic urethra) provided sensitivity of 51% for any CIS, and 55% for multiple CIS lesions. The cold-cup biopsies for CIS in the bladder mucosa showed sensitivity and specificity of 46% and 89%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Traditional cold-cup biopsies are unreliable for detecting CIS in bladder mucosa and negative findings must be interpreted with caution.""","""['Sigurdur Gudjónsson', 'Mats Bläckberg', 'Gunilla Chebil', 'Staffan Jahnson', 'Hans Olsson', 'Pär-Ola Bendahl', 'Wiking Månsson', 'Fredrik Liedberg']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prospective study of transitional cell carcinoma in the prostatic urethra and prostate in the cystoprostatectomy specimen.

Selective destruction of targeted prostate tissue is now technically feasible. Much has been theorized but little is known about the proper patient selection or treatment outcomes to determine if this organ preserving approach to prostate cancer has merit for further study and diffusion into wider practice. Herein we present the largest retrospective registry report of men treated with sub-total prostate cryotherapy in order to begin to understand how this treatment is being applied despite the paucity of data.  Objectives:   • To identify recent trends in focal cryotherapy from a prospectively maintained treatment registry. • To describe treatment outcomes after uncontrolled application of focally ablative techniques within community practice.  Materials and methods:   • We conducted an analysis of the COLD Registry to identify patients treated with partial gland prostate cryoablation between 1997 and 2007. • Preoperative characteristics and postoperative cancer-specific and functional outcomes were assembled for analysis.  Results:   • The COLD Registry contained information for 5853 patients and focal cryotherapy was the codified procedure in 1160 patients (19.8%). • A dramatic increase in focal treatments was observed, from 46 in 1999 to 567 in 2005 (P < 0.01). • The biochemical recurrence-free rate (ASTRO definition) at 36 months was 75.7%. • Prostate biopsy, performed in 164/1160 of patients (14.1%), was positive in 43 (26.3%) of those suspected of cancer recurrence, but in only 3.7% (43/1160) of treated patients. • Urinary continence (defined as use of 0 pads) was 98.4%. Maintenance of spontaneous erections was 58.1%. Prolonged urinary retention (>30 days) occurred in six (1.1%) patients. Rectourethral fistula was observed in one (0.1%) patient.  Conclusions:   • Focal cryoablation is increasingly used for selected patients with prostate cancer. • Oncological efficacy in the present series appears similar to that of whole-gland cryoablation. • The impact of focal cryoablation on urinary, sexual and bowel function appears to be less than that of radical therapies, although preservation of sexual function is not as high as might be expected.""","""['John F Ward', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prostate cancer: The optimal number and location of cores for repeat biopsy.', 'Whole gland primary prostate cryoablation: initial results from the cryo on-line data registry.', ""Achieving the 'bifecta' using salvage cryotherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer: analysis of the Cryo On-Line Data (COLD) registry data."", 'Salvage focal prostate cryoablation for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy: initial results from the cryo on-line data registry.', 'Nerve-sparing focal cryoablation of prostate cancer.', 'Cryotherapy for prostate cancer: ready for prime time?', 'Prediction and Mapping of Intraprostatic Tumor Extent with Artificial Intelligence.', 'Oncological results and cancer control definition in focal therapy\xa0for Prostate Cancer: a systematic review.', 'Functional outcomes and safety of focal therapy for prostate cancer: a systematic review on results and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).', 'Factors affecting the selection of eligible candidates for focal therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Focal therapy for localized prostate cancer - Current status.']"""

Generating training data for classifiers is problematic, since only domain experts (e.g. pathologists) can correctly label ground truth data. Additionally, digital pathology datasets suffer from the ""minority class problem"", an issue where the number of exemplars from the non-target class outnumber target class exemplars which can bias the classifier and reduce accuracy. In this paper, we develop a training strategy combining active learning (AL) with class-balancing. AL identifies unlabeled samples that are ""informative"" (i.e. likely to increase classifier performance) for annotation, avoiding non-informative samples. This yields high accuracy with a smaller training set size compared with random learning (RL). Previous AL methods have not explicitly accounted for the minority class problem in biomedical images. Pre-specifying a target class ratio mitigates the problem of training bias. Finally, we develop a mathematical model to predict the number of annotations (cost) required to achieve balanced training classes. In addition to predicting training cost, the model reveals the theoretical properties of AL in the context of the minority class problem.  Results:   Using this class-balanced AL training strategy (CBAL), we build a classifier to distinguish cancer from non-cancer regions on digitized prostate histopathology. Our dataset consists of 12,000 image regions sampled from 100 biopsies (58 prostate cancer patients). We compare CBAL against: (1) unbalanced AL (UBAL), which uses AL but ignores class ratio; (2) class-balanced RL (CBRL), which uses RL with a specific class ratio; and (3) unbalanced RL (UBRL). The CBAL-trained classifier yields 2% greater accuracy and 3% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) than alternatively-trained classifiers. Our cost model accurately predicts the number of annotations necessary to obtain balanced classes. The accuracy of our prediction is verified by empirically-observed costs. Finally, we find that over-sampling the minority class yields a marginal improvement in classifier accuracy but the improved performance comes at the expense of greater annotation cost.  Conclusions:   We have combined AL with class balancing to yield a general training strategy applicable to most supervised classification problems where the dataset is expensive to obtain and which suffers from the minority class problem. An intelligent training strategy is a critical component of supervised classification, but the integration of AL and intelligent choice of class ratios, as well as the application of a general cost model, will help researchers to plan the training process more quickly and effectively.""","""['Scott Doyle', 'James Monaco', 'Michael Feldman', 'John Tomaszewski', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Semi-supervised training of deep convolutional neural networks with heterogeneous data and few local annotations: An experiment on prostate histopathology image classification.', 'Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Evaluate Performance of a Classifier for Automatic Grading of Prostate Cancer From Digitized Histopathologic Images.', 'Combining weakly and strongly supervised learning improves strong supervision in Gleason pattern classification.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'A comprehensive data level analysis for cancer diagnosis on imbalanced data.', 'Histology segmentation using active learning on regions of interest in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.', 'A Pathologist-Annotated Dataset for Validating Artificial Intelligence: A Project Description and Pilot Study.', 'Active Semisupervised Model for Improving the Identification of Anticancer Peptides.', 'Quick Annotator: an open-source digital pathology based rapid image annotation tool.', 'Computational methods and next-generation sequencing approaches to analyze epigenetics data: Profiling of methods and applications.']"""

The Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ probe is highly specific to one isoform of phospholipase C, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), responsible for catabolizing phosphatidylcholine directly to phosphocholine. Incubation of Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ in vitro with PC-PLC demonstrated a 150-fold increase in fluorescence that could be inhibited by the specific PC-PLC inhibitor tricyclodecan-9-yl xanthogenate (D609) with an IC(50) of 34 ± 8 μM. Since elevations in phosphocholine have been consistently observed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a wide array of cancer cells and solid tumors, we assessed the utility of Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ as a probe for targeted tumor imaging. Injection of Pyro-PtdEtn-BHQ into mice bearing DU145 human prostate tumor xenografts followed by in vivo NIR imaging resulted in a 4-fold increase in tumor radiance over background and a 2 fold increase in the tumor/muscle ratio. Tumor fluorescence enhancement was inhibited with the administration of D609. The ability to image PC-PLC activity in vivo provides a unique and sensitive method of monitoring one of the critical phospholipase signaling pathways activated in cancer, as well as the phospholipase activities that are altered in response to cancer treatment.""","""['Theresa M Mawn', 'Anatoliy V Popov', 'Nancy J Beardsley', 'Klara Stefflova', 'Matthew Milkevitch', 'Gang Zheng', 'E James Delikatny']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Design and synthesis of phospholipase C and A2-activatable near-infrared fluorescent smart probes.', 'A quantitative continuous enzyme assay of intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic phospholipase substrates for molecular imaging.', 'NIR Fluorescent Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy with a Novel Theranostic Phospholipid Probe for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609) mechanism of actions: a mini-review of literature.', 'Pyro-Gly-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Gly-Ser-Gly-Lys(BHQ3).', 'Conjugates of Tetrapyrrolic Macrocycles as Potential Anticancer Target-Oriented Photosensitizers.', 'Practical Guidance for Developing Small-Molecule Optical Probes for In Vivo Imaging.', 'Focus on the glycerophosphocholine pathway in choline phospholipid metabolism of cancer.', 'Detection and Differentiation of Breast Cancer Sub-Types using a cPLA2α Activatable Fluorophore.', 'Nonprotecting Group Synthesis of a Phospholipase C Activatable Probe with an Azo-Free Quencher.']"""

The inverse correlation of tumour buds with peritumoural lymphocytic inflammation suggests an interaction with specific immune responses. The aims of this study were to characterize the immunological microenvironment of tumour buds and its impact on prognosis in mismatch repair (MMR)-proficient and -deficient colorectal cancers.  Methods and results:   A total of 297 colorectal cancers were double-immunostained for CK22 plus one of the following: CD138, CD16, CD20, CD21, CD56, CD68, CD8, forkhead box P2 (FoxP3), granzyme B, mast cell tryptase, CD3 or T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA)-1. Tumour buds and immune cells within the region of densest budding were evaluated [×40 high-power field (HPF)] simultaneously. In both MMR-proficient and -deficient cancers, CD8(+), FoxP3(+) and CD68(+) cells were observed most frequently (>40 cells/HPF) and were independent prognostic factors. A combined prognostic score of tumour budding and CD8(+), FoxP3(+) and CD68(+) distinctly identified patients with low-, moderate- or high-risk colorectal cancers with 5-year survival rates of 75.2% [confidence interval 95% (CI): 66-83], 56.3% (95% CI: 43-68) and 25.2% (95% CI: 14-38), respectively, in MMR-proficient and -deficient cancers.

In most of these cases, SRC-1 and SRC-3 have been shown to promote tumor cell growth by activating nuclear receptor and multiple growth factor signaling cascades that lead to uncontrolled tumor cell growth. Up until now, most targeted chemotherapeutic drugs have been designed largely to block a single pathway at a time, but cancers frequently acquire resistance by switching to alternative growth factor pathways. We reason that the development of chemotherapeutic agents against SRC coactivators that sit at the nexus of multiple cell growth signaling networks and transcriptional factors should be particularly effective therapeutics. To substantiate this hypothesis, we report the discovery of 2,2'-bis-(Formyl-1,6,7-trihydroxy-5-isopropyl-3-methylnaphthalene (gossypol) as a small molecule inhibitor of coactivator SRC-1 and SRC-3. Our data indicate that gossypol binds directly to SRC-3 in its receptor interacting domain. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, gossypol selectively reduces the cellular protein concentrations of SRC-1 and SRC-3 without generally altering overall protein expression patterns, SRC-2, or other coactivators, such as p300 and coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1. Gossypol reduces the concentration of SRC-3 in prostate, lung, and liver cancer cell lines. Gossypol inhibits cell viability in the same cancer cell lines where it promotes SRC-3 down-regulation. Additionally, gossypol sensitizes lung and breast cancer cell lines to the inhibitory effects of other chemotherapeutic agents. Importantly, gossypol is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells, whereas normal cell viability is not affected. This data establish the proof-of-principle that, as a class, SRC-1 and SRC-3 coactivators are accessible chemotherapeutic targets. Given their function as integrators of multiple cell growth signaling systems, SRC-1/SRC-3 small molecule inhibitors comprise a new class of drugs that have potential as novel chemotherapeutics able to defeat aspects of acquired cancer cell resistance mechanisms.""","""['Ying Wang', 'David M Lonard', 'Yang Yu', 'Dar-Chone Chow', 'Timothy G Palzkill', ""Bert W O'Malley""]""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Bufalin is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of the steroid receptor coactivators SRC-3 and SRC-1.', 'Steroid receptor coactivators present a unique opportunity for drug development in hormone-dependent cancers.', 'Identification of verrucarin a as a potent and selective steroid receptor coactivator-3 small molecule inhibitor.', 'An acetylation-enhanced interaction between transcription factor Sox2 and the steroid receptor coactivators facilitates Sox2 transcriptional activity and function.', 'Steroid receptor coactivators: servants and masters for control of systems metabolism.', 'SRC2 controls CD4+ T\xa0cell activation via stimulating c-Myc-mediated upregulation of amino acid transporter Slc7a5.', 'Estrogen-dependent activation of NCOA3 couples with p300 and NF-κB to mediate antiapoptotic genes in ER-positive breast cancer cells.', 'Steroid receptor coactivators - their role in immunity.', 'Drugging the Undruggable: Targeting the N-Terminal Domain of Nuclear Hormone Receptors.', 'Steroid receptor coactivator-1: The central intermediator linking multiple signals and functions in the brain and spinal cord.']"""

Induction of up-regulated genes was due to chromatin remodeling by a combinatorial complex between estrogen receptor (ER)-β and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Here we show that this complex can also repress transcription of prognostic genes that are down-regulated in PCa, such as the glutathione transferase gene GSTP1. Silencing of GSTP1 is a common early event in prostate carcinogenesis, frequently caused by promoter hypermethylation. We validated loss of glutathione transferase (GST) P1-1 expression in vivo, in tissue microarrays from a retrospective cohort of patients, and correlated it with decreased disease-specific survival. Furthermore, we show that in PCa cultured cells ERβ/eNOS causes GSTP1 repression by being recruited at estrogen responsive elements in the gene promoter with consequential remodeling of local chromatin. Treatment with ERβ antagonist or its natural ligand 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol, eNOS inhibitors or ERβ small interference RNA abrogated the binding and reversed GSTP1 silencing, demonstrating the direct involvement of the complex. In vitro, GSTP1 silencing by ERβ/eNOS was specific for cells from patients with worse clinical outcome where it appeared the sole mechanism regulating GSTP1 expression because no promoter hypermethylation was present. However, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays on fresh PCa tissues demonstrated that silencing by ERβ/eNOS can coexist with promoter hypermethylation. Our findings reveal that the ERβ/eNOS complex can exert transcriptional repression and suggest that this may represent an epigenetic event favoring inactivation of the GSTP1 locus by methylation. Moreover, abrogation of ERβ/eNOS function by 3β-adiol emphasizes the significance of circulating or locally produced sex steroid hormones or their metabolites in PCa biology with relevant clinical/therapeutic implications.""","""['A Re', 'A Aiello', 'S Nanni', 'A Grasselli', 'V Benvenuti', 'V Pantisano', 'L Strigari', 'C Colussi', 'S Ciccone', 'A P Mazzetti', 'F Pierconti', 'F Pinto', 'P Bassi', 'M Gallucci', 'S Sentinelli', 'F Trimarchi', 'S Bacchetti', 'A Pontecorvi', 'M Lo Bello', 'A Farsetti']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Endothelial NOS, estrogen receptor beta, and HIFs cooperate in the activation of a prognostic transcriptional pattern in aggressive human prostate cancer.', 'Estrogen-dependent dynamic profile of eNOS-DNA associations in prostate cancer.', 'Reversal of GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation and reactivation of pi-class glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1) expression in human prostate cancer cells by treatment with procainamide.', 'Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) hypermethylation in prostate cancer: review 2007.', 'Preneoplastic prostate lesions: an opportunity for prostate cancer prevention.', 'Targeting GSTP1-dependent ferroptosis in lung cancer radiotherapy: Existing evidence and future directions.', 'Gasotransmitters in the tumor microenvironment: Impacts on cancer chemotherapy (Review).', 'Current Advances of Nitric Oxide in Cancer and Anticancer Therapeutics.', 'H19-Dependent Transcriptional Regulation of β3 and β4 Integrins Upon Estrogen and Hypoxia Favors Metastatic Potential in Prostate Cancer.', ""Altered Nup153 Expression Impairs the Function of Cultured Hippocampal Neural Stem Cells Isolated from a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.""]"""

The increasing trend of prostate cancer risk was independent of age at immigration. The risk trends for ""other"" immigrants were between the risks of low- and high-risk countries. The gender-specific shifts in cancer risks in immigrants toward the risk in natives indicate a major role of sex, age at immigration and environmental exposures in colorectal and lung cancers risks.

The emergence of hormone-refractory prostate cancer and consequent failure of conventional androgen deprivation therapies make it necessary to bypass hormonal resistance by targeting the same signaling pathway at new intervention points. In our study, we showed that cryptotanshinone inhibited the growth of AR-positive prostate cancer cells, suggesting that cryptotanshinone affected AR function. Cryptotanshinone also profoundly inhibited the transcriptional activity of AR and suppressed the expression of several AR-target genes at the mRNA and the protein levels. At the molecular level, cryptotanshinone disrupted the interaction between AR and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), and inhibited the complex of AR and LSD1 to the promoter of AR target genes without affecting the protein degradation and translocation of AR. Cryptotanshinone increased the mono-methyl and di-methylation of Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9), a repressive histone marker which is demethylated and activated by LSD1. These data suggest that cryptotanshinone functions via inhibition of LSD1, a protein that promotes AR-dependent transcriptional activity via derepression of H3K9. In summary, we describe a novel mechanism whereby cryptotanshinone down-regulates AR signaling via functional inhibition of LSD1-mediated demethylation of H3K9 and represses the transcriptional activity of AR.

We estimated age-specific preclinical incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) for progressive cancer (from 128 for age group 55-58 years to 774 for age group 67-71 years) and nonprogressive cancer (from 40 for age group 55-58 years to 66 for age group 67-71 years), the mean sojourn time (7.72 years) and the sensitivity (42.8% at first screen and 59.8% at the second screen) by using a multistep epidemiological model with data from the Finnish randomized controlled trial. The overall number of screens for overdetection (NSO) was 29 (95% confidence interval (CI): 18, 48) for screenees aged 55-67 years, equivalent to 3.4 (95% CI: 2.1, 5.7) overdetected Pcas per 100 screenees. The NSO decreased from 63 (95% CI: 37, 109) at the first screen to 29 (95% CI: 18, 48) at the third screen and from 43 (95% CI: 36, 52) for age 55 years to 25 (95% CI: 8, 75) at age 67 years at the first screen. In conclusion, around 3.4 cases for every 100 screened men would be overdetected during three screen rounds (~ 13 years of follow-up) in the Finnish randomized controlled trial.

The purpose of the study was to compare PLND outcomes in patients at risk for lymph node involvement (LNI) who were undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) by different surgeons and surgical approaches.  Patients and methods:   Institutional policy initiated on January 1, 2010, mandated that all patients undergoing RP receive a standardized PLND with inclusion of the hypogastric region when predicted risk of LNI was ≥ 2%. We analyzed the outcomes of consecutive patients meeting these criteria from January 1 to September 1, 2010 by surgeons and surgical approach. All patients underwent RP; surgical approach (open radical retropubic [ORP], laparoscopic [LRP], RALP) was selected by the consulting surgeon. Differences in lymph node yield (LNY) between surgeons and surgical approaches were compared using multivariable linear regression with adjustment for clinical stage, biopsy Gleason grade, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and age.  Results:   Of 330 patients (126 ORP, 78 LRP, 126 RALP), 323 (98%) underwent PLND. There were no significant differences in characteristics between approaches, but the nomogram probability of LNI was slightly greater for ORP than RALP (P=0.04). LNY was high (18 nodes) by all approaches; more nodes were removed by ORP and LRP (median 20, 19, respectively) than RALP (16) after adjusting for stage, grade, PSA level, and age (P=0.015). Rates of LNI were high (14%) with no difference between approaches when adjusted for nomogram probability of LNI (P=0.15). Variation in median LNY among individual surgeons was considerable for all three approaches (11-28) (P=0.005) and was much greater than the variability by approach.  Conclusions:   PLND, including hypogastric nodal packet, can be performed by any surgical approach, with slightly different yields but similar pathologic outcomes. Individual surgeon commitment to PLND may be more important than approach.""","""['Jonathan L Silberstein', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Nicholas E Power', 'Raul O Parra', 'Jonathan A Coleman', 'Rodrigo Pinochet', 'Karim A Touijer', 'Peter T Scardino', 'James A Eastham', 'Vincent P Laudone']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Assessment of lymph node yield after pelvic lymph node dissection in men with prostate cancer: a comparison between robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and open radical prostatectomy in the modern era.', 'Indication for and extension of pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: an analysis of five European institutions.', 'Adherence of the indication to European Association of Urology guideline recommended pelvic lymph node dissection at a high-volume center: Differences between open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Utility of Lymphadenectomy in Prostate Cancer: Where Do We Stand?', 'Rise and fall of total mesorectal excision with lateral pelvic lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of 11,366 patients.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection: a combined technique.', 'Multicenter evaluation of guideline adherence for pelvic lymph node dissection in patients undergoing open retropubic vs. laparoscopic or robot assisted radical prostatectomy according to the recent German S3 guideline on prostate cancer.', 'Current technique and results for extended pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

It has been recently reported that silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 interacts with cortactin and promotes cell migration. Here, we examined the role of cortactin and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 in migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The cortactin expression levels in DU145, LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells, and in PrEC normal human prostate epithelial cells were evaluated by western blot analysis. In DU145 cells, the expression of cortactin or silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 was inhibited by small interfering RNA, and the effects of their knockdown on migration and invasion were examined by cell migration and invasion assays. To determine the localization of cortactin and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1, western blot and immunofluorescence microscopic analyses were carried out. The functional interaction between silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 and cortactin was also studied by in vivo acetylation assay.  Results:   The protein expression of cortactin was significantly higher in DU145 cells than in other cell lines. Knockdown of cortactin or silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 expression inhibited both migration and invasion of DU145 cells. Similarly to cortactin, silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 was found to be predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm. Finally, the knockdown of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 expression increased the acetylation level of cortactin.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that inhibition of cortactin or silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 expression attenuates migration and invasion of DU145 cells and this could represent a promising strategy to regulate metastasis of prostate cancer.""","""['Keita Nakane', 'Yasunori Fujita', 'Riyako Terazawa', 'Yuko Atsumi', 'Taku Kato', 'Yoshinori Nozawa', 'Takashi Deguchi', 'Masafumi Ito']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial comment to inhibition of cortactin and SIRT1 expression attenuates migration and invasion of prostate cancer DU145 cells.', 'Small interfering RNA-directed targeting of Toll-like receptor 4 inhibits human prostate cancer cell invasion, survival, and tumorigenicity.', 'Expression and functional role of CCR9 in prostate cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6) is a constitutively expressed survival factor in human prostate cancer.', 'Cortactin Expression in Hematopoietic Cells: Implications for Hematological Malignancies.', 'Cortactin in tumor invasiveness.', 'The Mechanistic Roles of Sirtuins in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The Roles of Sirtuin Family Proteins in Cancer Progression.', 'Nasal Placode Development, GnRH Neuronal Migration and Kallmann Syndrome.', 'SIRT1 Modulates the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Oncolysis.']"""

Stained slides were evaluated for the proportion and staining intensity of immunoreactive cells. Total immunoreactivity (IR) scores (range: 0-8) were calculated as the sum of the proportion and intensity scores. Associations between the clinicopathological features of the patients, SXR status, and CYP3A4 immunoreactivity were analyzed. Western blot analyses validated the specificity of the anti-SXR antibody in 293T cells transfected with pcDNA-FLAG-SXR. Positive (IR score: ≥ 2) nuclear SXR staining was observed in 91% (71/78) of benign foci and 47% (50/106) of cancerous lesions. Immunoreactivity scores were significantly lower in the cancerous lesions than in the benign foci (P < 0.0001). Clinicopathological analyses showed that cancer-specific survival in patients with high SXR IR scores (≥ 4) was significantly increased (P = 0.046). Combined data of present and previous studies showed that high IR scores for both the SXR and CYP3A4 correlated with significantly better cancer-specific survival rates in multivariate regression analyses (hazard ratio: 2.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.25-3.55, P = 0.007).

These SLN inhibit the adhesion of polymorphonuclear cells to the endothelium and may act as anti-inflammatory agents. As cancer cell adhesion to endothelium is crucial for metastasis dissemination, here we have evaluated the effect of cholbut SLN on adhesion and migration of cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Cholbut SLN was incubated with a number of cancer cell lines or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and adhesion was quantified by a computerized micro-imaging system. Migration was detected by the scratch 'wound-healing' assay and the Boyden chamber invasion assay. Expression of ERK and p38 MAPK was analysed by Western blot. Expression of the mRNA for E-cadherin and claudin-1 was measured by RT-PCR. KEY RESULTS Cholbut SLN inhibited HUVEC adhesiveness to cancer cell lines derived from human colon-rectum, breast, prostate cancers and melanoma. The effect was concentration and time-dependent and exerted on both cancer cells and HUVEC. Moreover, these SLN inhibited migration of cancer cells and substantially down-modulated ERK and p38 phosphorylation. The anti-adhesive effect was additive to that induced by the triggering of B7h, which is another stimulus inhibiting both ERK and p38 phosphorylation, and cell adhesiveness. Furthermore, cholbut SLN induced E-cadherin and inhibited claudin-1 expression in HUVEC.

Methods:   We used flow cytometry to calculate the percentage of CD4+ CD25(high) regulatory T cells in the CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 30 PCa patients (11 localized and 19 non-localized cases) and 20 healthy volunteer controls, determined the expressions of TGF-beta 1 and COX-2 in the serum by ELISA, and analyzed their correlation with the CD4+ CD25(high) regulatory T cells in the PCa patients as well as the differences between the localized and non- localized cases.  Results:   CD4+ CD25(high) regulatory T cells accounted for (18.32 +/- 7.49) % in the CD4+ T cells in PBMCs from the PCa patients, significantly higher than (7.77 +/- 1.86) % from the controls (P < 0.05), but with no statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatment in the PCa patients (P > 0.05). The expressions of TGF-beta 1 and COX-2 in the peripheral blood were (215.97 +/- 55.16) ng/ml and (6.88 +/- 5.14) ng/ml in the PCa patients, in comparison with (149.75 +/- 47.11) ng/ml (P < 0.05) and (6.88 +/- 5.14) ng/ml (P > 0.05) in the controls. Multiple linear regression analysis showed no significant correlation between the expression of CD4+ CD25(high) regulatory T cells in PBMCs and those of TGF-beta 1 and COX-2 in the peripheral blood of the PCa patients.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists, which proved effective for suppressing circulating testosterone levels and led to a significant shift away from surgical castration to medical management during the past 25 years. The luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists resulted in a periodic return of noncastrate testosterone levels once the receptor desensitization attenuated and the effect of androgen agonism resumed. Therefore, the introduction of an androgen receptor antagonist (gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist) appeared, conceptually at least, to be a preferable alternative.

This leads to a marked reduction in the secretion of bioactive hormones stimulating testosterone production and eventual induction of a reversible, but transient and incomplete, state known as ""selective medical hypophysectomy."" The treatment with LHRH agonists has proved effective in many settings; however, the dosage and timing strategies depend critically on the patient's disease risk and progression.

The TGFβ-associated kinase 1 (TAK1) is an upstream regulator of NF-κB signaling. In TGFβ-stimulated cells, TAK1 undergoes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys-34 by TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and is thereby activated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether TAK1 polyubiquitination at Lys-34 is also essential for NF-κB activation via TNF receptor, IL-1 receptor and toll-like receptor 4. We observed that TAK1 polyubiquitination occurred at Lys-34 and required the E3 ubiquitin ligase TNF receptor-associated factor 6 after stimulation of cells with IL-1β. Polyubiquitination of TAK1 also occurred at Lys-34 in cells stimulated by TNF-α and LPS, which activates TLR4, as well as in HepG2 and prostate cancer cells stimulated with TGFβ, which in all cases resulted in NF-κB activation. Expression of a K34R-mutant TAK1 led to a reduced NF-κB activation, IL-6 promoter activity, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion by TNF-α-stimulated PC-3U cells. Similar results were obtained in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 after LPS treatment.

Methods:   Twenty men who had been referred for a diagnostic work-up for prostate cancer were enrolled in this study. MET- and FDG-PET/CT by high-resolution mode were carried out on the same day prior to prostate biopsy and each maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was compared with the pathological findings. The regions of interest (about 100 mm(2) small round) were placed at standard 6 points of the peripheral zone and 4 points in the apex of the transitional zone in cases that had undergone biopsy of the internal gland. We summed two scores if a specimen had inhomogeneous Gleason scores (e.g. GS 7; 4 + 3) and doubled the score when the Gleason score was the same (e.g. GS 8; 4 × 2). We divided the tumors into three groups. If the summed Gleason score of the specimens was 5 or less, they were grouped as NG (no grade with the Gleason score). If the summed Gleason score was 6 or 7, the tumors were defined as LG (low Gleason score group), and if the summed Gleason score was 8, 9 or 10, the tumors were classified as HG (high Gleason score group). The mean SUVmax was calculated and one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test and the Tukey post hoc test were performed for statistical comparisons. The capabilities of MET and FDG for diagnosing prostate cancer were evaluated through analysis of the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The cut-off levels of SUVmax for the highest accuracy were determined by the results of the ROC analysis, and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated.  Results:   The PET images, obtained with Gemini TF PET/CT, allowed visual identification of anatomical locations within the prostate gland. Among the mean SUVmax of MET, FDG early phase and FDG delayed phase, the differences between NG and HG were all statistically significant (P < 0.01). With MET the difference between NG and LG was also significant (P < 0.05). And for the elevation rate from FDG early to delayed phase, the difference between NG and HG was significant (P < 0.05). The cut-off SUVmax, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy for distinguishing between NG and LG + HG by MET, FDG early and delayed phase were 3.15/78.7/75.6/78.3, 2.81/61.7/80.0/70.7 and 3.00/62.8/78.9/70.7, respectively. And the same factors between NG + LG and HG were 3.76/70.1/89.7/82.6, 2.88/70.1/82.9/78.3 and 3.47/62.7/86.3/77.7, respectively.

In the present study X-ray characterization, UV-Vis and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) calculations for six PdCl(2)(XPy)(2) complexes (where: Py = pyridine; X = H, CH(3) or Cl) were applied in order to investigate substituent effects on their crystal structures and electronic properties and to combine the results with their catalytic and cytotoxic activity. The structures of complexes PdCl(2)(3-MePy)(2), PdCl(2)(4-MePy)(2) and PdCl(2)(2-ClPy)(2), have been described for the first time and we compared our results with available data for the whole series of six complexes. All compounds exhibit a square planar coordination geometry in which the palladium ion coordinates two nitrogen atoms of pyridine ligands and two chlorine atoms in trans positions. For complexes with ortho substituted XPy ligands a cis disposition of substituents takes place, whereas for other ligands: 3-MePy and 3-ClPy--the substituents are in trans positions. For XPy the energies of π-π* and n-π* transitions depend on the position and nature of the X substituent in the XPy ring. After complex formation a hipsochromic shift (24-34 nm) of π-π* and a bathochromic shift of n-π* bands are observed. The UV-Vis spectra of PdCl(2)(XPy)(2) confirm that square planar coordination geometry of complexes I-VI and two dπ-π* transitions are expected. With the help of the TD-DFT calculations we proved that dπ-π* transitions in solutions of PdCl(2)(XPy)(2) complexes result from MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) with contribution from chlorine atoms to palladium. We also studied substituent effects on cytotoxic properties of Pd(II) complexes against the human breast cancer cell line MCF7, the human prostate cancer cell line PC3, and the human T-cell lymphoblast-like cell line CCRF.

Interestingly, miR-1 and miR-133a are located on the same chromosomal locus in the human genome. We examined the functional significance of miR-1 and miR-133a in prostate cancer (PCa) cells and identified the novel molecular targets regulated by both miR-1 and miR-133a.  Methods and results:   The expression levels of miR-1 and miR-133a were significantly downregulated in PCa compared with non-PCa tissues. Restoration of miR-1 or miR-133a in PC3 and DU145 cells revealed significant inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion. Molecular target identification by genome-wide gene expression analysis and luciferase reporter assay showed that purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) was directly regulated by both miRNAs. Silencing of the PNP gene inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion in both PC3 and DU145 cells. Immunohistochemistry detected positive staining of PNP in PCa specimens.  Conclusions:   Downregulation of miR-1 and miR-133a was a frequent event in PCa and both function as tumour suppressors.

Methods:   In 206 consecutive patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and prolactin levels were tested and correlated with disease. In patients with prostate cancer, hormone levels were also correlated with known prognostic factors. Predictive value was assessed for age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA ratio, PSA density, prostate volume and serum sex hormone levels using multiple logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves.  Results:   Considering sex hormones, only testosterone levels were significantly lower in patients with prostate cancer than those with BPH; testosterone levels appear to be independent predictor of prostate cancer, enhancing predictive accuracy for BPH and PC. Testosterone levels do not seem to be associated with known clinical prognostic factors.

The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) from primary therapy. Secondary endpoints were response of tumor(s), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and toxicity.  Results:   Median OS was significantly longer in the DOC group (n = 117) than the control group (n = 118) (94.0 vs. 70.0 months, P = 0.0077) and the corresponding hazard ratio (HR) for death in DOC group was 0.566 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) 0.370-0.867; P = 0.0088]. Effective DOC groups [medium dose (50-69 mg/m(2)) and high dose (≥70 mg/m(2))] had significantly longer median OS than control even when survival times were calculated from the start of castration-resistant events (151 vs. 36 months; P = 0.0173) and the corresponding HR for death in the DOC group was 0.515 (95%CI 0.293-0.903; P = 0.0205). In multivariate analysis, statistically significant prognostic indicators were Gleason score, time to CRPC events, and receipt of DOC therapy. Response rate of both measurable lesion and PSA was not significantly different between each DOC dose group.

Methods:   Using data from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we conducted secondary data analysis to compare PA between 31,078 cancer survivors with history of single-site cancer diagnosis at least 2 years prior to the survey, including cancer survivors of prostate [n = 2,951], female breast [n = 5,695], colon [n = 1,436], cervix [n = 2,211], endometrium [n = 1,080], and ovary [n = 732], and 235,351 non-cancer participants between 40 and 79 years of age. Self-reported PA and cancer history data were collected through telephone interviews. Weekly moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA levels were calculated in moderate-to-intensity physical activity equivalent (MIE). Least-squares means of MIE were obtained from sex, age groups (40-64 years [middle-aged] and 65-79 years [older]), and cancer site-specific multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for age, age(2), race/ethnicity, household income, and education.  Results:   Prostate cancer survivors reported participating in approximately 20 min/week more MIE, compared to their non-cancer counterparts (P < 0.10 for the middle-aged group; P < 0.01 for the older group). Middle-aged cervical and endometrial cancer survivors reported approximately 10 min/week less MIE (P < 0.05 and P < 0.15, respectively). Adjusted means of MIE were not different between cancer survivors of colon, female breast, or ovary and non-cancer participants.

The purpose of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism responsible for the suppression of prostate cancer cell proliferation by BBP. Treatment of lymph node-metastasised prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) and bone-metastasised prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and MDA-PCa-2b) with BBP (up to 0·8 %) for 72 h increased the percentage of cells at the G0/G1 phase and decreased those at the S and G2/M phases. The finding was supported by the reduction in the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells and of DNA synthesis measured by the incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine. Concomitantly, BBP treatment decreased the protein levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma, cyclin D1 and E, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 2, and pre-replication complex (CDC6 and MCM7) in LNCaP and PC-3 cells, whereas CDK inhibitor p27 was elevated in these cell lines.

Objective:   The objective of the study was to determine the impact of health information-seeking behavior (HISB) and personal factors on patients' preferred role in treatment decision making (TDM).  Methods:   Participants consisted of 150 men with newly diagnosed PC seen at 2 urology clinics in western Canada.

Conclusions:   At the time of diagnosis, the majority of men want to be involved in TDM and have access to information.

Here, we present experimental and clinical evidence supporting the importantance of the role of IDAGL in human diseases. A targeted RT-PCR screen coupled with sequencing of purified PCR products detects widespread transcription at multiple IDAGL and identifies 96 small noncoding trans-regulatory RNAs of ~100-300 nt in length containing SNPs (snpRNAs) associated with 21 common disorders. Multiple independent lines of experimental evidence support functionality of snpRNAs by documenting their cell type-specific expression and evolutionary conservation of sequences, genomic coordinates and biological effects. Chromatin state signatures, expression profiling experiments and luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that many IDAGL are Polycomb-regulated long-range enhancers. Expression of snpRNAs in human and mouse cells markedly affects cellular behavior and induces allele-specific clinically relevant phenotypic changes: NLRP1-locus snpRNAs rs2670660 exert regulatory effects on monocyte/macrophage transdifferentiation, induce prostate cancer (PC) susceptibility snpRNAs and transform low-malignancy hormone-dependent human PC cells into highly malignant androgen-independent PC. Q-PCR analysis and luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that snpRNA sequences represent allele-specific ""decoy"" targets of microRNAs that function as SNP allele-specific modifiers of microRNA expression and activity. We demonstrate that trans-acting RNA molecules facilitating resistance to androgen depletion (RAD) in vitro and castration-resistant phenotype (CRP) in vivo of PC contain intergenic 8q24-locus SNP variants (rs1447295; rs16901979; rs6983267) that were recently linked with increased risk of PC. Q-PCR analysis of clinical samples reveals markedly increased and highly concordant (r = 0.896; p < 0.0001) snpRNA expression levels in tumor tissues compared with the adjacent normal prostate [122-fold and 45-fold in Gleason 7 tumors (p = 0.03); 370-fold and 127-fold in Gleason 8 tumors (p = 0.0001) for NLRP1-locus and 8q24-locus snpRNAs, respectively]. Our experiments indicate that RAD and CR phenotype of human PC cells can be triggered by ncRNA molecules transcribed from the NLRP1-locus intergenic enhancer at 17p13 and by downstream activation of the 8q24-locus snpRNAs. Our results define the IDAGL at 17p13 and 8q24 as candidate regulatory loci of RAD and CR phenotypes of PC, reveal previously unknown molecular links between the innate immunity/inflammasome system and development of hormone-independent PC and identify novel molecular and genetic targets with diagnostic and therapeutic potentials, exploration of which should be highly beneficial for personalized clinical management of PC.""","""['Anna B Glinskii', 'Shuang Ma', 'Jun Ma', 'Denise Grant', 'Chang-Uk Lim', 'Ian Guest', 'Stewart Sell', 'Ralph Buttyan', 'Gennadi V Glinsky']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Bridging the gaps: from risk loci via non-coding RNAs to gene networks and prostate cancer phenotypes.', 'The riddle of intergenic disease-associated loci.', 'Identification of intergenic trans-regulatory RNAs containing a disease-linked SNP sequence and targeting cell cycle progression/differentiation pathways in multiple common human disorders.', 'The riddle of intergenic disease-associated loci.', 'Bridging the gaps: from risk loci via non-coding RNAs to gene networks and prostate cancer phenotypes.', 'Mechanistic insights into genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer genomics, biology, and risk assessment through genome-wide association studies.', 'Low expression of NLRP1 is associated with a poor prognosis and immune infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma patients.', 'Systematic Evaluation of the Diagnostic and Prognostic Significance of Competitive Endogenous RNA Networks in Prostate Cancer.', 'DNA Nanotweezers and Graphene Transistor Enable Label-Free Genotyping.', 'Micro RNAs and DNA methylation are regulatory players in human cells with altered X chromosome to autosome balance.', 'Explaining the disease phenotype of intergenic SNP through predicted long range regulation.']"""

However, information on its distribution in vascular tumors, such as angiosarcoma, is limited. In this study, we examined selected normal tissues and 314 vascular endothelial and 1086 nonvascular tumors to get an insight into the biology of these tumors and on potential diagnostic use of Prox1 as an immunohistochemical marker. In adult tissues, Prox1 was essentially restricted to lymphatic endothelia, with expression in subsets of pancreatic and gastrointestinal epithelia. However, it was also detected in embryonic liver and heart. Prox1 was consistently expressed in lymphangiomas, venous hemangiomas, Kaposi sarcoma, in endothelia of spindle cell hemangioma, Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, and retiform hemangioendothelioma, and in half of epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas. It was present in most cutaneous angiosarcomas from different sites but was less commonly expressed in deep soft tissue and visceral angiosarcomas. In contrast, Prox1 was generally absent in capillary and cavernous hemangiomas. In positive hemangiomas and angiosarcomas it was coexpressed with podoplanin, another marker of the lymphatic endothelial phenotype. There was an inverse correlation with CD34 expression. The expression in mesenchymal nonendothelial neoplasm was limited. Prox1 was detected in 5 of 27 synovial sarcomas, specifically in the epithelia of biphasic tumors. Four of 16 Ewing sarcomas and 5 of 15 paragangliomas were also positive. All melanomas and undifferentiated sarcomas were negative. Among epithelial neoplasms, Prox1 was detected in 18 of 38 colonic carcinomas and 10 of 15 cholangiocarcinomas and in a minority of pulmonary, prostatic, and endometrial adenocarcinomas. The common Prox1 expression in angiosarcoma and its rare presence in nonvascular mesenchymal tumors make this marker suitable for the diagnosis of angiosarcoma and Kaposi sarcoma. However, the presence of Prox1 in some malignant epithelial tumors necessitates caution in applying Prox1 as a marker for vascular tumors. Common Prox1 expression in angiosarcoma may reflect the lymphatic endothelial phenotype in these tumors.

Recently, we reported that the DGEA peptide is a promising targeting ligand for near-infrared fluorescence and microPET imaging of integrin α(2)β(1) expression in prostate cancers. Here, we aimed to further improve the targeting efficacy of this peptide by incorporating a series of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) into the DGEA sequence.  Methods:   After the conjugation with appropriate fluorescent dyes, the CPP-DGEA peptides were evaluated in human prostate cell lines (PC-3, CWR-22, and LNCaP) that contain different integrin α(2)β(1) expression levels. In addition, to reduce excess kidney uptake, a carboxypeptidase-specific sequence Gly-Lys was incorporated into the probe design, allowing for cleavage by the kidney brush border enzymes of the CPP before uptake by proximal tubule cells.  Results:   Although the CPP motif greatly facilitated the translocation of CPP-DGEA without affecting binding specificity in vitro, fluorescent dye-labeled CPP-DGEA demonstrated extremely high kidney uptake in vivo. Kidney uptake was dramatically decreased after a carboxypeptidase-specific peptide linker (Gly-Lys) had been incorporated into the probe design. The optimized probe demonstrated a prominent accumulation of activity in PC-3 tumor (integrin α(2)β(1)-positive). Receptor specificity was confirmed with blocking experiments and evaluation in a CWR-22 control tumor model with low α(2)β(1) expression.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrated that the introduction of a CPP sequence can facilitate the internalization of an integrin-targeted peptide probe in vitro.

Methods:   Of 294 patients who underwent cystectomy and urinary diversion, 101 men with preoperative TUPB were included in this study. For these patients, if the result of TUPB was positive for urothelial carcinoma, we performed urethrectomy as a rule. If it was negative, we presented the option of urethral preservation and decided the final type of urinary reconstruction. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of TUPB were assessed, and we investigated the number of final urethral recurrences. We also tried to identify which clinical and pathological findings by TUPB most accurately predicted the disease remaining in the prostate of cystectomy specimens.  Results:   Of the 25 patients with positive TUPB, 18 had disease in the prostatic urethra or stroma of cystectomy specimens. There were 3 patients with negative TUPB but with involvement of the prostate in cystectomy specimens. Thus, TUPB achieved 86% sensitivity, 91% specificity, 72% PPV, and 96% NPV. Two patients (1.9%) had urethral recurrence in this period. Among the findings for TUPB, non-papillary tumors most accurately predicted the disease in the prostate of cystectomy specimens.  Conclusions:   TUPB achieved a high NPV and the urethral recurrence rate was acceptable. If TUPB was negative, patients could have chance urethral preservation.

While this often takes the form of areas of distinct differentiation into recognized histological subtypes, or different pathological grade, often there are more subtle differences in phenotype which defy accurate classification (Figure 1). Ultimately, since morphology is dictated by the underlying molecular phenotype, areas with visible differences are likely to be accompanied by differences in the expression of proteins which orchestrate cellular function and behavior, and therefore, appearance. The significance of visible and invisible (molecular) heterogeneity for prognosis is unknown, but recent evidence suggests that, at least at the genetic level, heterogeneity exists in the primary tumor(1,2), and some of these sub-clones give rise to metastatic (and therefore lethal) disease. Moreover, some proteins are measured as biomarkers because they are the targets of therapy (for instance ER and HER2 for tamoxifen and trastuzumab (Herceptin), respectively). If these proteins show variable expression within a tumor then therapeutic responses may also be variable. The widely used histopathologic scoring schemes for immunohistochemistry either ignore, or numerically homogenize the quantification of protein expression. Similarly, in destructive techniques, where the tumor samples are homogenized (such as gene expression profiling), quantitative information can be elucidated, but spatial information is lost. Genetic heterogeneity mapping approaches in pancreatic cancer have relied either on generation of a single cell suspension(3), or on macrodissection(4). A recent study has used quantum dots in order to map morphologic and molecular heterogeneity in prostate cancer tissue(5), providing proof of principle that morphology and molecular mapping is feasible, but falling short of quantifying the heterogeneity. Since immunohistochemistry is, at best, only semi-quantitative and subject to intra- and inter-observer bias, more sensitive and quantitative methodologies are required in order to accurately map and quantify tissue heterogeneity in situ. We have developed and applied an experimental and statistical methodology in order to systematically quantify the heterogeneity of protein expression in whole tissue sections of tumors, based on the Automated QUantitative Analysis (AQUA) system(6). Tissue sections are labeled with specific antibodies directed against cytokeratins and targets of interest, coupled to fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies. Slides are imaged using a whole-slide fluorescence scanner. Images are subdivided into hundreds to thousands of tiles, and each tile is then assigned an AQUA score which is a measure of protein concentration within the epithelial (tumor) component of the tissue. Heatmaps are generated to represent tissue expression of the proteins and a heterogeneity score assigned, using a statistical measure of heterogeneity originally used in ecology, based on the Simpson's biodiversity index(7). To date there have been no attempts to systematically map and quantify this variability in tandem with protein expression, in histological preparations. Here, we illustrate the first use of the method applied to ER and HER2 biomarker expression in ovarian cancer. Using this method paves the way for analyzing heterogeneity as an independent variable in studies of biomarker expression in translational studies, in order to establish the significance of heterogeneity in prognosis and prediction of responses to therapy.""","""['Dana Faratian', 'Jason Christiansen', 'Mark Gustavson', 'Christine Jones', 'Christopher Scott', 'InHwa Um', 'David J Harrison']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Quantitative analysis of estrogen receptor heterogeneity in breast cancer.', 'Quantification of HER2 and estrogen receptor heterogeneity in breast cancer by single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization.', 'Novel image analysis approach for quantifying expression of nuclear proteins assessed by immunohistochemistry: application to measurement of oestrogen and progesterone receptor levels in breast cancer.', 'The predictive value of HER2 in breast cancer.', 'Quantitative Clinical Imaging Methods for Monitoring Intratumoral Evolution.', 'Spatial protein heterogeneity analysis in frozen tissues to evaluate tumor heterogeneity.', 'Digital Microscopy, Image Analysis, and Virtual Slide Repository.', 'Image Analysis in Surgical Pathology.', 'Detection of Phenotypic Alterations Using High-Content Analysis of Whole-Slide Images.', 'Bimodality of intratumor Ki67 expression is an independent prognostic factor of overall survival in patients with invasive breast carcinoma.']"""

In cancer cells, loss of DLC1 is known to enhance cancer cell migration. However, the role of DLC1 in normal cell migration has not been well studied. Here, we show that silencing of DLC1 (shDLC1) in normal prostate epithelial cells reduces cell migration in both Transwell and wound-healing assays. This migration defect is mainly due to upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Silencing of PAI-1 rescues the shDLC1-reduced migration phenotype. Reexpression of DLC1 suppresses PAI-1 and restores the migration defect as well. In contrast, DLC1-K714E (GAP inactive) mutant neither decreases the PAI-1 level nor rescues the shDLC1 migration defect. Interestingly, DLC1-Y442F (tensin-binding and focal adhesion-localizing defective) mutant is able to suppress PAI-1 expression but does not restore the migration defect. Furthermore, PAI-1 upregulation in shDLC1 cells is EGFR-MEK pathway dependent and is able to promote in vitro angiogenesis. Together, our results show that at least the following two new mechanisms are involved in DLC1-mediated normal cell migration: (i) DLC1 modulates the expression of PAI-1, which is a negative regulator for cell migration, in a GAP domain and EGFR-MEK-dependent manner and (ii) Independent of PAI-1, the interaction of DLC1 with tensin members positively regulates cell migration.""","""['Yi-Ping Shih', 'Yoshikazu Takada', 'Su Hao Lo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Down-regulation of DLC1 in endothelial cells compromises the angiogenesis process.', 'Expression of deleted in liver cancer 1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 protein in ovarian carcinoma and their clinical significance.', 'Differential regulation of the activity of deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) by tensins controls cell migration and transformation.', 'Tumor suppressor gene DLC1: Its modifications, interactive molecules, and potential prospects for clinical cancer application.', 'GAP-independent functions of DLC1 in metastasis.', 'Transcription Factor PLAGL1 Is Associated with Angiogenic Gene Expression in the Placenta.', 'Differential regulation of rho GTPases during lung adenocarcinoma migration and invasion reveals a novel role of the tumor suppressor StarD13 in invadopodia regulation.', 'Silencing of ELK3 Induces S-M Phase Arrest and Apoptosis and Upregulates SERPINE1 Expression Reducing Migration in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Upregulation of DLC-1 inhibits pancreatic cancer progression: Studies with clinical samples and a pancreatic cancer model.', 'Down-regulation of DLC1 in endothelial cells compromises the angiogenesis process.']"""

The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, TRAIL, COX-2, NOS2 and Hsp70 proteins was detected by western blot analysis. Generation of reactive oxygen species was measured by using a fluorescent probe. It was observed that atranorin (1), diffrattaic (2) and divaricatic (3) acids showed a lower activity inhibiting the prostate cancer cells only at more high concentrations (25 and 50μM). Whereas compounds vicanicin (4) and protolichesterinic acid (5) showed a dose-response relationship in the range of 6.25-50μM concentrations in DU-145 and LNCaP cells, activating an apoptotic process. The novel finding, in the present study, is that apoptosis induced by these compounds appears to be mediated, at least in part, via the inhibition of Hsp70 expression, that may be correlated with a modulation of redox-sensitive mechanisms. The combination of vicanicin (4) and protolichesterinic acid (5) with other anti-prostate cancer therapies could be considered a promising strategy that warrants further in vivo evaluation.""","""['A Russo', 'S Caggia', 'M Piovano', 'J Garbarino', 'V Cardile']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Chem Biol Interact""","""['Cytotoxic activity and antioxidant capacity of purified lichen metabolites: an in vitro study.', 'Pannarin inhibits cell growth and induces cell death in human prostate carcinoma DU-145 cells.', 'Anti-Cancer Activity of Lobaric Acid and Lobarstin Extracted from the Antarctic Lichen Stereocaulon alpnum.', 'Pharmaceutically relevant metabolites from lichens.', 'Lichens in Genus Parmelia: An Overview and their Application.', 'Bioactive Lichen Secondary Metabolites and Their Presence in Species from Chile.', 'Lichen Depsides and Tridepsides: Progress in Pharmacological Approaches.', 'Anti-cancer Evaluation of Depsides Isolated from Indonesian Folious Lichens: Physcia millegrana, Parmelia dilatata and Parmelia aurulenta.', 'Oxidative stress mediated by gyrophoric acid from the lichen Umbilicaria hirsuta affected apoptosis and stress/survival pathways in HeLa cells.', 'The Comprehensive Roles of ATRANORIN, A Secondary Metabolite from the Antarctic Lichen Stereocaulon caespitosum, in HCC Tumorigenesis.']"""

The complex structure of these lesions requires novel therapeutic approaches to both reduce tumor burden and restore structural stability. In photodynamic therapy (PDT), a minimally invasive approach can be used to employ light to activate a photosensitizing agent that preferentially accumulates in tumor tissue, leading to cell toxicity and death. Previous work in an osteolytic rat model (MT-1) demonstrated that PDT effectively ablates tumor and improves vertebral structural properties. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of PDT in a rat model of mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic spinal metastases. Mixed spinal metastases were generated through intracardiac injection of Ace-1 canine prostate cancer cells into female athymic rats (day 0). A single PDT treatment was applied to lumbar vertebra L2 of tumor-bearing and healthy control rats (day 14). PDT-treated and untreated control rats were euthanized and excised spines imaged with μCT to assess bone quality (day 21). Spines were mechanically tested or histologically processed to assess mechanical integrity, tumor burden, and remodelling properties. Untreated tumor-bearing vertebrae showed large areas of osteolysis and areas of immature, new bone formation. The overall bone quality resulting from these lesions consisted of decreased structural properties but without a significant reduction in mechanical integrity. PDT was shown to significantly decrease tumor burden and osteoclastic activity, thereby improving vertebral bone structural properties. While non-tumor-bearing vertebrae exhibited significantly more new bone formation following PDT, the already heightened level of new bone formation in the mixed tumor-bearing vertebrae was not further increased. As such, the effect of PDT on mixed metastases may be more influenced by suppression of osteoclastic resorption as opposed to the triggering of new bone formation.""","""['L Wise-Milestone', 'M K Akens', 'V C K Lo', 'A J Yee', 'B C Wilson', 'C M Whyne']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Photodynamic therapy in spinal metastases: a qualitative analysis of published results.', 'Evaluating the effects of mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic metastasis on vertebral bone quality in a new rat model.', 'Beyond radiation therapy: photodynamic therapy maintains structural integrity of irradiated healthy and metastatically involved vertebrae in a pre-clinical in vivo model.', 'Beyond bisphosphonates: photodynamic therapy structurally augments metastatically involved vertebrae and destroys tumor tissue.', 'Molecular mechanisms of tumor-bone interactions in osteolytic metastases.', 'Progress of Phototherapy Applications in the Treatment of Bone Cancer.', 'Assessment of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid-Mediated Photodynamic Therapy on Bone Metastases: An in Vitro Study.', 'Photodynamic therapy outcome modelling for patients with spinal metastases: a simulation-based study.', 'Photodynamic therapy in spinal metastases: a qualitative analysis of published results.', 'Antitumor activity of photodynamic therapy performed with nanospheres containing zinc-phthalocyanine.']"""

Thus, we examined their effects on IMRT and arc therapy. Five clinical prostate patients were planned with both 6 MV eight-field IMRT and 6 MV two-arc RapidArc techniques using the Eclipse treatment planning system. These plans neglected treatment couch attenuation, as is a common clinical practice. Dose distributions were then recalculated in Eclipse with the inclusion of the Varian Exact Couch (imaging couch top) and the rails in varying configurations. The changes in dose and coverage were evaluated using the dose-volume histograms from each plan iteration. We used a TCP model to calculate losses in tumor control resulting from not accounting for the couch top and rails. We also verified dose measurements in a phantom. Failure to account for the treatment couch and rails resulted in clinically unacceptable dose and volume coverage losses to the targets for both IMRT and RapidArc. The couch caused average prescription dose losses (relative to plans that ignored the couch) to the prostate of 4.2% and 2.0% for IMRT with the rails out and in, respectively, and 3.2% and 2.9% for RapidArc with the rails out and in, respectively. On average, the percentage of the target covered by the prescribed dose dropped to 35% and 84% for IMRT (rails out and in, respectively) and to 18% and 17% for RapidArc (rails out and in, respectively). The TCP was also reduced by as much as 10.5% (6.3% on average). Dose and volume coverage losses for IMRT plans were primarily due to the rails, while the imaging couch top contributed most to losses for RapidArc. Both the couch top and rails contribute to dose and coverage losses that can render plans clinically unacceptable. A follow-up study we performed found that the less attenuating unipanel mesh couch top available with the Varian Exact couch does not cause a clinically impactful loss of dose or coverage for IMRT but still causes an unacceptable loss for RapidArc. Therefore, both the imaging or mesh couch top and the rails should be accounted for in arc therapy. The imaging couch top should be accounted for in IMRT treatment planning or the mesh top can be used, which would not need to be accounted for, and the rails should be moved to avoid the beams during treatment.""","""['Kiley B Pulliam', 'Rebecca M Howell', 'David Followill', 'Dershan Luo', 'R Allen White', 'Stephen F Kry']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Characterization of dose impact on IMRT and VMAT from couch attenuation for two Varian couches.', 'Evaluation of volumetric modulated arc therapy for cranial radiosurgery using multiple noncoplanar arcs.', 'A treatment planning study comparing volumetric arc modulation with RapidArc and fixed field IMRT for cervix uteri radiotherapy.', 'Radiotherapy treatment plans with RapidArc for prostate cancer involving seminal vesicles and lymph nodes.', 'RapidArc radiotherapy for whole pelvic lymph node in cervical cancer with 6 and 15 MV: a treatment planning comparison with fixed field IMRT.', 'Effect of linear accelerator carbon fiber couch on radiotherapy dose.', 'Quantitative Comparison of Dosimetric Data Between the Indigenous Baseplate and Commercially Available Carbon Fiber Baseplate for 6 and 15 MV Photon Energy.', 'AAPM MEDICAL PHYSICS PRACTICE GUIDELINE 5.b: Commissioning and QA of treatment planning dose calculations-Megavoltage photon and electron beams.', 'Radiation dosimetry effect evaluation of a carbon fiber couch on novel uRT-linac 506c accelerator.', 'Dose Calculation Comparisons between Three Modern Treatment Planning Systems.']"""

The breast cancer risk did not change with longer exposure to insulin glargine (p=0.35) and the mean risk was similar for glargine and non-glargine (p=0.12). With higher dose of insulin glargine, there was an increase in risk of prostate (p=0.037) and breast cancer (p=0.019). In diabetics, the mean risk of prostate cancer was decreased (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.59-0.79) but similar for breast cancer (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78-1.14) compared to the general population and did not change with longer diabetes duration (p=0.68 and p=0.53 respectively).

No risk model has been established to date. Despite gender-specific differences, no comparative studies exist for this tumor stage.  Materials and methods:   Cancer-specific survival (CSS) of 245 UCB patients without neoadjuvant chemotherapy staged pT4a, pN0-2, M0 after RC were analyzed in a retrospective multi-center study. Seventeen patients were excluded from further analysis due to carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the prostatic urethra and/or positive surgical margins. Average follow-up period was 30 months (IQR: 14-45). The influence of different clinical and histopathologic variables on CSS was determined through uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Two risk groups were generated using factors with independent effect in multivariate models. Internal validity of the prediction model was evaluated by bootstrapping.  Results:   Eighty-four percent of the patients (n = 192) were male; 72% (n = 165) showed lymphovascular invasion (LVI). The 5-year CSS rate was 31%, and significantly different between male and female (35% vs. 15%, P = 0.003). Multivariate Cox regression modeling, female gender (HR = 1.83, P = 0.008), LVI (HR = 1.92, P = 0.005), and absence of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR = 0.61, P = 0.020) significantly worsened CSS. Two risk groups were generated using these 3 criteria, which differed significantly between each other in CSS (5-year-CSS: 46% vs. 12%, P < 0.001). The c-index value of the risk model was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.53-0.68, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Prognosis in UCB staged pT4a is heterogeneous. Female gender and LVI are adverse factors.

Methods and materials:   The outcomes were analyzed for 599 men treated for localized prostate cancer with external beam radiotherapy to a minimal planning target volume dose of 75 Gy (range, 75-79.2). We assessed the effect of PCV and the pretreatment and treatment-related factors on the freedom from biochemical failure, freedom from metastasis, cause-specific survival, and overall survival.  Results:   The median number of biopsy cores was 7 (interquartile range, 6-12), median PCV was 10% (interquartile range, 2.5-25%), and median follow-up was 62 months. The PCV correlated with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group and individual risk features, including T stage, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, and percentage of positive biopsy cores. On log-rank analysis, the PCV stratified by quartile was prognostic for all endpoints, including overall survival. In addition, the PCV was a stronger prognostic factor than the percentage of positive biopsy cores when the two metrics were analyzed together. On multivariate analysis, the PCV predicted a worse outcome for all endpoints, including freedom from biochemical failure, (hazard ratio, 1.9; p = .0035), freedom from metastasis (hazard ratio, 1.7, p = .09), cause-specific survival (hazard ratio, 3.9, p = .014), and overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.8, p = .02).  Conclusions:   For patients treated with dose-escalated external beam radiotherapy, the volume of cancer in the biopsy specimen adds prognostic value for clinically relevant endpoints, particularly in intermediate- and high-risk patients.

Symptom experience is complicated, reflecting symptom prevalence, frequency, and severity. Symptom burden is associated with treatment tolerance as well as patients' quality of life (QOL).  Objectives:   The purpose of this study was to document the symptom experience and QOL of patients with commonly diagnosed cancers. The relationship between symptoms and QOL was also explored.  Methods:   A convenience sample of patients with the five most common cancers at a comprehensive cancer center completed surveys assessing symptom experience (Memorial Symptom Assessment Survey) and QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy). Patients completed surveys at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months thereafter. This article describes the study's baseline findings.  Results:   Surveys were completed by 558 cancer patients with breast, colorectal, gynecologic, lung, or prostate cancer. Patients reported an average of 9.1 symptoms, with symptom experience varying by cancer type. The mean overall QOL for the total sample was 85.1, with results differing by cancer type. Prostate cancer patients reported the lowest symptom burden and the highest QOL.  Limitations:   The sample was limited in terms of racial diversity. Because of the method of recruitment, baseline data were collected 6-8 months after diagnosis, meaning that participants were at various stages of treatment.  Conclusions:   The symptom experience of cancer patients varies widely depending on cancer type. Nevertheless, most patients report symptoms, regardless of whether or not they are currently receiving treatment.

Echo planar imaging (EPI) is a fast sequence commonly used for diffusion imaging but has inherent magnetic susceptibility and chemical shift artefacts associated. A diffusion sequence that is less affected by these artefacts is therefore advantageous. The half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) sequence was chosen. The diffusion sequences were compared in image quality, repeatability of the ADC value and the effect on the ADC value with varied b values. Eight volunteers underwent three scans of each sequence, on a 1.5-T Siemens system, using b values of 0, 150, 300, 450, 600, 750, 900 and 1000 s/mm(2). ADC maps were created to address the reproducibility of the ADC value when using two b values compared to eight b values. The ADC value using all b values with the HASTE sequence gave the best performance in all tested categories. Both sequences gave significantly different ADC mean values for two b values compared to when using eight b values (P<.05) suggesting larger error is present when using two b values. HASTE was shown to be an improvement over EPI in terms of repeatability, signal variation within a region of interest and standard deviation over the volunteer set.

Average NPV and overall accuracy of basal and mid-lateral biopsies were inferior to those of medial biopsies on the same levels. However, sensitivity of these lateral cores was similar to that of the medial cores. Sensitivities of apical and mid cores were significantly lower in patients with larger prostates.  Conclusion:   Decreased accuracy in lateral mid- and basal cores results from higher frequencies of cancer in corresponding prostate areas, and therefore additional samples should be taken at these locations.

However, little is known about their functions in mammalian cells. We report the purification of the ALKBH3 complex and demonstrate its association with the activating signal cointegrator complex (ASCC). ALKBH3 is overexpressed in various cancers, and both ALKBH3 and ASCC are important for alkylation damage resistance in these tumor cell lines. ASCC3, the largest subunit of ASCC, encodes a 3'-5' DNA helicase, whose activity is crucial for the generation of single-stranded DNA upon which ALKBH3 preferentially functions for dealkylation. In cell lines that are dependent on ALKBH3 and ASCC3 for alkylation damage resistance, loss of ALKBH3 or ASCC3 leads to increased 3-methylcytosine and reduced cell proliferation, which correlates with pH2A.X and 53BP1 foci formation. Our data provide a molecular mechanism by which ALKBH3 collaborates with ASCC to maintain genomic integrity in a cell-type specific manner.""","""['Sebastian Dango', 'Nima Mosammaparast', 'Mathew E Sowa', 'Li-Jun Xiong', 'Feizhen Wu', 'Keyjung Park', 'Mark Rubin', 'Steve Gygi', 'J Wade Harper', 'Yang Shi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cell""","""['Unraveling a connection between DNA demethylation repair and cancer.', 'RNA ligase-like domain in activating signal cointegrator 1 complex subunit 1 (ASCC1) regulates ASCC complex function during alkylation damage.', 'Alkbh2 protects against lethality and mutation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts.', 'The interaction of DNA repair factors ASCC2 and ASCC3 is affected by somatic cancer mutations.', 'Intersections between transcription-coupled repair and alkylation damage reversal.', 'Bacterial DNA repair genes and their eukaryotic homologues: 3.

Methods:   Eighteen patients with prostate cancer of intermediate prognosis were injected with 240 MBq of (99m)Tc-nanocolloid in the peripheral zone of each quadrant of the prostate, guided by transrectal ultrasonography. Tracer administration was also controlled with a portable gamma camera to assure that there was no diffusion outside the prostate. The injection was followed by planar imaging at 15 min. and 2 h, performing a SPECT/CT study at 2 h. with 2 mm slices. On the same day, a laparoscopic sentinel node lymphadenectomy assisted by a gamma probe and a portable gamma camera was performed.  Results:   A total of 55 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were visualized. In 17/18 of patients (94%) SLNs were observed outside the obturator region. Twenty SLNs (36%) were observed along the external iliac artery, 14 in the obturator fossa (25.4%), 6 in internal iliac area (11%) and 4 in common iliac region (7.2%). Three SLNs were visualized in presacral (5.4%), paraaortic (5.4%), and pararectal areas (5.4%) and two in paravesical region (3.6%). SLN metastases were found in 6 patients (33%), and in one of them, a SLN located along the common iliac artery, was the only one with metastases.  Conclusion:   Lymphatic drainage from the prostate has high individual variability, and direct drainage outside the pelvic area is observed frequently. With the SLN procedure, SLNs outside the routine area of lymphadenectomy can also be sampled to stage the patient more accurately.""","""['A de Bonilla-Damiá', 'O Roberto Brouwer', 'W Meinhardt', 'R A Valdés-Olmos']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol""","""['Detection rate and operating time required for gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node resection after injection of technetium-99m nanocolloid into the prostate with and without preoperative imaging.', 'Comparing the hybrid fluorescent-radioactive tracer indocyanine green-99mTc-nanocolloid with 99mTc-nanocolloid for sentinel node identification: a validation study using lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT.', 'Limited pelvic lymphadenectomy using the sentinel lymph node procedure in patients with localised prostate carcinoma: a pilot study.', 'Sentinel node approach in prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of the sentinel lymph node combining SPECT/CT with the planar image and its importance for the surgical act.', 'Influence of lymph node degeneration on metastases in prostate cancer: or why we must look for a needle in a haystack.', 'Sentinel node biopsy and lymphatic mapping in penile and prostate cancer.', 'Beyond penile cancer, is there a role for sentinel node biopsy in urological malignancies?']"""

HGPIN was clearly associated with cancer risk in the sextant biopsy era, but this has not been clearly demonstrated in the extended biopsy era.  Materials and methods:   From 1999 to 2009, 314 men had at least 1 or more repeat biopsy due to the presence of exclusive HGPIN (without any other pathologic finding) in a previous extended biopsy. They were divided into 2 groups according to the initial follow-up biopsy scheme, 178 men were followed up using a second standard extended biopsy scheme and 136 were followed up using the saturation biopsy scheme.  Results:   In the standard repeat biopsy group, 35 of 178 (19.7%) men had cancer on initial repeat biopsy. In the saturation biopsy group, 42 of 136 (30.9%) had cancer on initial repeat biopsy (overall, P = .04). Multivariate analysis demonstrates that the biopsy scheme on repeat biopsy is an independent predictor of prostate cancer detection (OR 1.85, (95% CI; 1.03, 3.29), exclusive of age, PSA, days from initial biopsy, DRE status and multifocal PIN.

Cancer referral guidelines help GPs decide which patients to refer urgently for further investigation.  Aim:   To examine primary care referral patterns, compliance with referral guidance, and eventual outcome for patients.  Design and setting:   Prospective audit within general practice in Scotland.  Method:   GPs in Scotland reviewed all urgent suspected cancer referrals over a 6-month period. They noted the final diagnosis and assessed whether the referral was in accordance with agreed referral guidelines.  Results:   A total of 18 775 urgent suspected cancer referrals were analysed from 516 GP practices. The referral rate ranged from 3.7 to 24.0 per 1000 per annum; 30.8% of referrals were for patients aged under 50 years, yet this age group accounts for only 11.1% of all diagnosed cancers; 10.3% of all urgent cancer referrals were for suspected melanoma, despite this cancer accounting for only 4.1% of new cancers. The proportion of patients subsequently diagnosed with cancer was greatest for leukaemia (61.7%), prostate (52.6%), and lung cancer referrals (39.7%), and lowest for melanoma (11.8%), oesophago-gastric (11.2%), brain (10.6%), and laryngeal cancer referrals (7.8%). Compliance with referral guidelines was 90.9%. A large proportion of referrals considered to be outside the guidelines still had a cancer diagnosed (urological 15.9%, lung 8.8%, colorectal 8.4%, and breast 6.4%).

Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) and the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) are highly expressed in LC and since the expression of molecules in normal tissue is significantly lower as compared to tumor cells, these proteins are considered as potential tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) for developing T-cell based immunotherapy.  Methods:   We assessed the capacity of predicted CD4 T-cell epitopes from STEAP and EZH2 to induce anti-tumor immune responses to LC cell lines.  Results:   Out of several predicted epitopes, two synthetic peptides, STEAP281-296 and EZH295-109, were effective in inducing CD4 T-cell responses that were restricted by HLA-DR1, DR15, or DR53 molecules, indicating that the peptides function as promiscuous T-cell epitopes. Moreover, STEAP281-296 and EZH295-109-reactive T-cells could directly recognize STEAP or EZH2 expressing LC cells in an HLA-DR restricted manner. In addition, some STEAP-reactive T-cells responded to STEAP+ tumor cell lysates presented by autologous dendric cells. Most significantly, both of these peptides were capable of stimulating in vitro T-cell responses in patients with LC.  Conclusions:   Peptides STEAP281-296 and EZH295-109 function as strong CD4 T-cell epitopes that can elicit effective anti-tumor T-cell responses against STEAP or EZH2 expressing LC.

The median follow-up was 37 months (range 1 to 72 months). The serum PSA levels decreased continuously after PPB throughout the entire follow-up period in 97% of patients without neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. No relapse occurred during the follow-up period in patients at low risk. Our 6-year experience suggests that PPB is effective for localized prostate cancer.

It is highly cytotoxic to tumor endothelial cells overexpressing VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2/KDR/Flk1) and inhibits the growth of primary tumors in subcutaneous models of breast and prostate cancer and inhibits metastatic dissemination in orthotopic models of pancreatic cancer. We examined the efficacy of SLT-VEGF in limiting tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic melanoma model, using NCR athymic nude mice inoculated with highly metastatic Line IV Cl 1 cultured human melanoma cells. Twice weekly injections of SLT-VEGF were started when tumors became palpable at one week after intradermal injection of 1 × 10(6) cells/mouse. Despite selective depletion of VEGFR-2 overexpressing endothelial cells from the tumor vasculature, SLT-VEGF treatment did not affect tumor growth. However, after primary tumors were removed, continued SLT-VEGF treatment led to fewer tumor recurrences (p = 0.007), reduced the incidence of lung metastasis (p = 0.038), and improved survival (p = 0.002). These results suggest that SLT-VEGF is effective at the very early stages of tumor development, when selective killing of VEGFR-2 overexpressing endothelial cells can still prevent further progression.

The goal of radical prostatectomy is to completely remove the tumor while preserving erectile function and urinary continence as well as factors that determine the postoperative quality of life. There are many factors influencing sexual function after radical prostatectomy of localized prostate cancer. All factors can be divided into the preoperative, postoperative and intraoperative. In this paper we examine the significance of individual factors affecting erectile dysfunction following surgical treatment.  Material and methods:   The study included 36 patients who underwent nerve sparing radical prostatectomy at the Urology Clinic, Clinical Center of Sarajevo University in period from January 2009 until December 2010.  Results:   Out of 84 patients tested, radical retropubic prostatectomy with the reservation of neurovascular bundles was performed in 36 patients (42.8%). Of this number, both of the neurovascular bundles were preserved in 28 patients (77.7%) and one in 8 patients (22.2%).  Conclusion:   The positive predictive factor for erectile function after radical retropubic prostatectomy is the preoperative sexual function, younger age, preservation of both neurovascular bundles and early rehabilitation therapy.""","""['Dzelaludin Junuzovic', 'Munira Hasanbegovic', 'Dzenan Omerbegovic', 'Fahrudin Smajlovic']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Arh""","""['Prediction of postoperative sexual function after nerve sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Prospective comprehensive assessment of sexual function after retropubic non nerve sparing radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Recovery of Baseline Erectile Function in Men Following Radical Prostatectomy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Analysis Using Validated Measures.', 'Quality of life following radical prostatectomy.', 'Radical prostatectomy, preservation of sexual function, cancer control.

We performed a meta-analysis on familial clustering of prostate cancer. Out of 74 studies reporting data on familial aggregation of prostate cancer in unselected populations retrieved by a Pubmed search and browsing references, 33 independent studies meeting the inclusion criteria were used in the analysis performed with the random effects model. The pooled rate ratio (RR) for first-degree family history, i.e. affected father or brother, is 2.48 (95% confidence interval: 2.25-2.74). The incidence rate for men who have a brother who got prostate cancer increases 3.14 times (CI:2.37-4.15), and for those with affected father 2.35 times (CI:2.02-2.72). The pooled estimate of RR for two or more affected first-degree family members relative to no history in father and in brother is 4.39 (CI:2.61-7.39). First-degree family history appears to increase the incidence rate of prostate cancer more in men under 65 (RR:2.87, CI:2.21-3.74), than in men aged 65 and older (RR:1.92, CI:1.49-2.47), p for interaction = 0.002. The attributable fraction among those having an affected first-degree relative equals to 59.7% (CI:55.6-63.5%) for men at all ages, 65.2% (CI:57.7-71.4%) for men younger than 65 and 47.9% (CI:37.1-56.8%) for men aged 65 or older. For those with a family history in 2 or more first-degree family members 77.2% (CI:65.4-85.0%) of prostate cancer incidence can be attributed to the familial clustering.

The three conjugates showed ten-fold higher solubility in the liquid oil phase Miglyol 808 than DX. To further increase the drug entrapment efficiency in NPs, orthogonal design was performed. The optimized formulation was composed of Miglyol 808, Brij 78, and Vitamin E tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS). The conjugates were successfully entrapped in the reduced-surfactant NPs with entrapment efficiencies of about 50%-60% as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. All three conjugates showed 45% initial burst release in 100% mouse plasma. Whereas C12-DX showed another 40% release over the next 8 hours, C18-DX and C22-DX in NPs showed no additional release after the initial burst of drug. All conjugates showed significantly lower cytotoxicity than DX in human DU-145 prostate cancer cells. The half maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC(50)) of free conjugates and conjugate NPs were comparable except for C22-DX, which was nontoxic in the tested concentration range and showed only vehicle toxicity when entrapped in NPs. In vivo, the total area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)) values of all DX conjugate NPs were significantly greater than that of Taxotere, demonstrating prolonged retention of drug in the blood. The AUC(0-∞) value of DX in Taxotere was 8.3-fold, 358.0-fold, and 454.5-fold lower than that of NP-formulated C12-DX, C18-DX, and C22-DX, respectively. The results of these studies strongly support the idea that the physical/chemical properties of DX conjugates may be fine-tuned to influence the affinity and retention of DX in oil-filled lipid NPs, which leads to very different pharmacokinetic profiles and blood exposure of an otherwise potent chemo-therapeutic agent. These studies and methodologies may allow for improved and more potent nanoparticle-based formulations.""","""['Lan Feng', 'Huali Wu', 'Ping Ma', 'Russell J Mumper', 'S Rahima Benhabbour']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""[""Oil-filled lipid nanoparticles containing 2'-(2-bromohexadecanoyl)-docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer."", 'Docetaxel (DTX)-loaded polydopamine-modified TPGS-PLA nanoparticles as a targeted drug delivery system for the treatment of liver cancer.', 'Poly(lactide)-vitamin E derivative/montmorillonite nanoparticle formulations for the oral delivery of Docetaxel.', 'Recent advances in TPGS-based nanoparticles of docetaxel for improved chemotherapy.', 'Nanomedicine: enhancement of chemotherapeutical efficacy of docetaxel by using a biodegradable nanoparticle formulation.', 'A666-conjugated nanoparticles target prestin of outer hair cells preventing cisplatin-induced hearing loss.', 'Formulation of a Sustained Release Docetaxel Loaded Cockle Shell-Derived Calcium Carbonate Nanoparticles against Breast Cancer.', 'Improving DNA double-strand repair inhibitor KU55933 therapeutic index in cancer radiotherapy using nanoparticle drug delivery.', 'A single dose of dexamethasone encapsulated in polyethylene glycol-coated polylactic acid nanoparticles attenuates cisplatin-induced hearing loss following round window membrane administration.', 'Nanoways to overcome docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Accumulation and cytotoxicity of CdTe-MPA (mercaptopropionic acid) QDs in CSCs were assessed using flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting techniques as well as a colorimetric cell viability assay.  Results:   We investigated the expression of two cell surface-associated glycoproteins, CD44 and CD133, in four different cancer cell lines (glioblastoma, melanoma, pancreatic, and prostate adenocarcinoma). Only the melanoma cells were positive to both markers of CD44 and CD133, whereas the other cells were only CD44-positive. The QDs accumulated to a similar extent in all subpopulations of the melanoma cells. The phenotypical response after QD treatment was compared with the response after ionizing radiation treatment. The percentage of the CD44(high-)CD133(high) subpopulation decreased from 72% to 55%-58% for both treatments.

For example, SBP1 levels are typically reduced in tumors compared to non-cancerous tissue, with the degree of reduction associated with increasingly poor clinical outcome.  Methods:   In order to investigate inter-relationships between blood and tissue Se levels and GPx activity, tissue SBP1 levels, and disease aggressiveness using the Gleason score, we measured levels of selenium and selected selenoproteins in fasting serum and histologically normal prostate tissues obtained from 24 men undergoing radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer.  Results:   GPx enzyme activity was inversely correlated with SBP1 levels in prostate tissue as determined by densitometry of Western blots obtained using anti-SBP1 antibodies [partial Spearman's correlation coefficients and corresponding P-values overall and in African-Americans = -0.42 (0.08) and -0.53 (0.10), respectively], which is consistent with previous observations in cultured cells and mice. Of particular interest was the positive correlation between tissue GPx activity and Gleason score, with this relationship achieving statistical significance among African-Americans (r = 0.67, P = 0.02).

Methods:   Carbidopa was tested for its ability to enhance the effects of bicalutamide on cell viability, apoptosis and PSA transactivation in LNCaP and C4-2 cells. The castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) LNCaP xenograft tumor model was used in vivo. After CRPC progression, mice were treated with carbidopa (50 mg/kg) and bicalutamide (50 mg/kg) as monotherapy or in combination. Tumor volume and serum PSA were evaluated weekly.  Results:   Combination treatment of carbidopa plus bicalutamide significantly inhibited cell viability in both cell lines and induced apoptosis. The combination treatment also decreased androgen-induced PSA transactivation by 62.6% in LNCaP cells and by 55.6% in C4-2 cells compared to control, while bicalutamide monotherapy reduced PSA levels by 27.5% and 29.1% in LNCaP and C4-2 cells. In vivo, bicalutamide monotherapy delayed LNCaP CRPC tumor growth rate by 72.2%, while combination treatment reduced tumor growth by 84.4% compared to control. Serum PSA was also reduced 70.6% with bicalutamide monotherapy, while combination therapy reduced PSA levels by 76.7% compared to control.

ADT was associated with increased risk of a TE (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-1.61; P < .0001), and duration of ADT was associated with the total number of events (P < .0001).  Conclusions:   In this population-based cohort, ADT was associated with increased risk of a TE, and longer durations of ADT were associated with more TEs. Men with intermediate- and low-risk prostate cancer should be assessed for TE risk factors before starting ADT and counseled regarding the risks and benefits of this therapy.""","""['Behfar Ehdaie', 'Coral L Atoria', 'Amit Gupta', 'Andrew Feifer', 'William T Lowrance', 'Michael J Morris', 'Peter T Scardino', 'James A Eastham', 'Elena B Elkin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Androgen deprivation for prostate cancer: the case for ""first, do no harm"".', 'Association of androgen deprivation therapy with thromboembolic events in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Comparison of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists and Orchiectomy: Effects of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of peripheral arterial disease and venous thromboembolism.', 'Contemporary role of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Stroke related to androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.', 'Thrombophilia and hormonal therapy in transgender persons: A\xa0literature review and case series.', 'Low Risk of Venous Thromboembolism After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Through Systemic Image Assessment: A Prospective Study.', 'Real-World Evidence Prediction of a Phase IV Oncology Trial: Comparative Degarelix vs Leuprolide Safety.', 'Association of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Therapies With Venous Thromboembolic Events in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A National Cohort Study.', 'Cardiovascular Safety of Degarelix Versus Leuprolide in Patients With Prostate Cancer: The Primary Results of the PRONOUNCE Randomized Trial.']"""

Patients and methods:   Patients were treated weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks (Schedule A) or 2 out of 3 weeks (Schedule B) with KOS-862 (16-120 mg/m(2)). Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling was performed during cycles 1 and 2; pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment for microtubule bundle formation (MTBF) was performed after the 1st dose, only at or above 100 mg/m(2).  Results:   Thirty-two patients were enrolled, and twenty-nine completed ≥1 cycle of therapy. Dose limiting toxicity [DLT] was observed at 120 mg/m(2). PK data were linear from 16 to 100 mg/m(2), with proportional increases in mean C(max) and AUC(tot) as a function of dose. Full PK analysis (mean ± SD) at 100 mg/m(2) revealed the following: half-life (t (½)) = 9.1 ± 2.2 h; volume of distribution (V(z)) = 119 ± 41 L/m(2); clearance (CL) = 9.3 ± 3.2 L/h/m(2). MTBF (n = 9) was seen in 40% of PBMCs within 1 h and in 15% of PBMC at 24-hours post infusion at 100 mg/m(2). Tumor shrinkage (n = 2, lymphoma), stable disease >3 months (n = 5, renal, prostate, oropharynx, cholangiocarcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma), and tumor marker reductions (n = 1, colorectal cancer/CEA) were observed.  Conclusion:   KOS-862 was well tolerated with manageable toxicity, favorable PK profile, and the suggestion of clinical activity.

Using deep sequencing, gene expression levels of all transcripts including novel ones can be quantified digitally. Although extremely promising, the massive amounts of data generated by RNA-Seq, substantial biases and uncertainty in short read alignment pose challenges for data analysis. In particular, large base-specific variation and between-base dependence make simple approaches, such as those that use averaging to normalize RNA-Seq data and quantify gene expressions, ineffective.  Results:   In this study, we propose a Poisson mixed-effects (POME) model to characterize base-level read coverage within each transcript. The underlying expression level is included as a key parameter in this model. Since the proposed model is capable of incorporating base-specific variation as well as between-base dependence that affect read coverage profile throughout the transcript, it can lead to improved quantification of the true underlying expression level.

DNA damage response (DDR) is required for maintenance of genomic integrity.  Methods:   In this study we investigated the DDR and cell cycle checkpoint activation of these organs using orthotopic cultures of human surgery-derived tissues and primary cultures of isolated prostate and seminal vesicle cells.  Results:   We find that the activation of ATM signaling pathway by ionizing radiation (IR) was comparable in both tissues. Previously, we have shown that the prostate secretory cells express low levels of histone variant H2AX and phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) after IR. Here we demonstrate that H2AX levels are low also in the secretory seminal vesicle cells suggesting that this is a common phenotype of postmitotic cells. We consequently established primary epithelial cell cultures from both organs to compare their DDR. Interestingly, contrary to human prostate epithelial cells (HPEC), primary seminal vesicle epithelial cells (HSVEC) displayed effective cell cycle checkpoints after IR and expressed higher levels of Wee1A checkpoint kinase. Furthermore, HSVEC but not HPEC cells were able to activate p53 and to induce p21 cell cycle inhibitor.  Discussion:   Our results show that during replication, the checkpoint enforcement is more proficient in the seminal vesicle than in the prostate epithelium cells. This indicates a more stringent enforcement of DDR in replicating seminal vesicle epithelial cells, and suggests that epithelial regeneration combined with sub-optimal checkpoint responses may contribute to high frequency of genetic lesions in the prostate epithelium.""","""['Sari Jäämaa', 'Anna Sankila', 'Ville Rantanen', 'Karita Peltonen', 'Päivi M Järvinen', 'Taija M Af Hällström', 'Mirja Ruutu', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Leif C Andersson', 'Marikki Laiho']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Maintenance of genomic integrity after DNA double strand breaks in the human prostate and seminal vesicle epithelium: the best and the worst.', 'Human prostate epithelium lacks Wee1A-mediated DNA damage-induced checkpoint enforcement.', 'Spontaneous mutation in mice provides new insight into the genetic mechanisms that pattern the seminal vesicles and prostate gland.', 'The distribution of PAX-2 immunoreactivity in the prostate gland, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct: comparison with prostatic adenocarcinoma and discussion of prostatic zonal embryogenesis.', 'Genetic changes and DNA damage responses in the prostate.', 'Anima: modular workflow system for comprehensive image data analysis.', 'Optimization and comprehensive characterization of a faithful tissue culture model of the benign and malignant human prostate.', 'Maintenance of genomic integrity after DNA double strand breaks in the human prostate and seminal vesicle epithelium: the best and the worst.']"""

Methods:   Monoclonal antibodies were generated against AGR2. One antibody pair, P1G4 (IgG1) to capture and P3A5 (IgG2a) to detect, showed good performance characteristics in a sandwich ELISA. This assay could detect AGR2 at sub ng/ml quantities.  Results:   AGR2 was detected in tissue digestion media of tumor specimens and culture media of AGR2-secreting prostate cancer cell lines. Additional testings involved frozen section immunohistochemistry, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis. Voided urine samples were collected from pre-operative cancer patients, and urinary protein was desalted and concentrated by filtration. The amount of AGR2 detected was scored as pg/100 µg total protein, and then converted to pg/ml urine. The developed ELISA detected AGR2 protein, ranging from 3.6 to 181 pg/ml, in an initial cohort of samples. AGR2 was not detected in the urine of non-cancer and a bladder cancer patient.  Conclusions:   For prostate cancer, an AGR2 urine test could be used for diagnosis.

The major environmental change when metastatic cells arrive in the bone is the destruction of mineralized type I collagen matrix. Once metastatic niches establish in bone, the invading tumour cells initiate a vicious cycle of osteolytic lesion formation via the dysregulation of paracrine signals and uncoupling of normal bone resorption and production. Here we report that the collagen receptor Endo180 (CD280, MRC2, uPARAP) participates in collagen deposition by primary human osteoblasts during de novo osteoid formation. This newly recognized function of Endo180 was suppressed in osteoblasts following heterotypic direct cell-cell contact in co-culture with prostate tumour cells. Reciprocal Endo180 up-regulation in osteolytic prostate tumour cells (PC3 and DU145) followed their direct contact with osteoblasts and promoted de novo collagen internalization, which is a previously characterized function of the constitutively recycling Endo180 receptor. The osteoblastic suppression and tumour cell-associated enhancement of Endo180 expression were equally sustained in these direct co-cultures. These findings are the first to demonstrate that increased tumour cell participation in collagen degradation and decreased collagen formation by osteoblasts in the osteolytic microenvironment are linked to the divergent regulation of a collagen-binding receptor. Immunohistochemical analysis of core biopsies from bone metastasis revealed higher levels of Endo180 expression in tumour cell foci than cells in the surrounding stroma. Additional experiments in prostate cell-osteoblast co-cultures indicate that divergent regulation of Endo180 is the result of dysregulated TGFβ1 signalling. The findings of this study provide a rationale for targeting collagen remodelling by Endo180 in bone metastases and other collagen matrix pathologies.""","""['Matthew P Caley', 'Giolanta Kogianni', 'Adam Adamarek', 'Julian H Gronau', 'Mercedes Rodriguez-Teja', 'Ana-Violeta Fonseca', 'Francesco Mauri', 'Ann Sandison', 'Johng S Rhim', 'Dmitri Pchejetski', 'Carlo Palmieri', 'Justin P Cobb', 'Jonathan Waxman', 'Justin Sturge']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['Endo180 at the cutting edge of bone cancer treatment and beyond.', 'Tumor-associated Endo180 requires stromal-derived LOX to promote metastatic prostate cancer cell migration on human ECM surfaces.', 'AGE-modified basement membrane cooperates with Endo180 to promote epithelial cell invasiveness and decrease prostate cancer survival.', 'Loss of TGF-β responsiveness in prostate stromal cells alters chemokine levels and facilitates the development of mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bone lesions.', 'The collagen receptor uPARAP/Endo180.', 'uPARAP/Endo180: a multifaceted protein of mesenchymal cells.', 'Identification of Key Modules and Hub Genes of Annulus Fibrosus in Intervertebral Disc Degeneration.', 'Differential Proteomic Analysis Predicts Appropriate Applications for the Secretome of Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells and Dermal Fibroblasts.', 'Concise Review: Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Current Understanding.', 'Endo180 at the cutting edge of bone cancer treatment and beyond.']"""

Methods:   The authors characterized the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood of vaccinated patients to identify biomarkers to predict patient prognosis. Peripheral blood was obtained from advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, who survived for >900 days (long-term survivors, n = 20) or died within 300 days (short-term survivors, n = 20) after treatment with personalized peptide vaccination. Gene expression profiles in prevaccination and postvaccination peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were assessed by DNA microarray.  Results:   There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical or pathological features between the 2 groups. Microarray analysis of prevaccination PBMCs identified 19 genes that were differentially expressed between the short-term and long-term survivors. Among the 15 up-regulated genes in the short-term survivors, 13 genes, which were also differentially expressed in postvaccination PBMCs, were associated with gene signatures of granulocytes. When a set of 4 differentially expressed genes were selected as the best combination to determine patient survival, prognosis was correctly predicted in 12 of 13 patients in a validation set (accuracy, 92%).

Methods:   An evaluation was performed of a consecutive group of men with biochemical failure after external beam radiation therapy with histologically proven local recurrence and bone-scan and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging to exclude macroscopic metastases, and who chose to have whole-gland salvage HIFU (Sonablate 500) at 2 centers (3 expert HIFU surgeons at each center). The modified Clavien system was used to categorize adverse events and validated questionnaires for functional outcomes. Progression following HIFU treatment was defined as ASTRO-Phoenix criteria (prostate serum antigen [PSA] >nadir+2 ng/mL) and/or a positive biopsy and/or start of hormone therapy.  Results:   Eighty-four men underwent whole-gland salvage HIFU (2004-2009). Median age, pretreatment serum PSA, and biopsy Gleason score was 68 years (range, 64-72 years), 4.3 ng/mL (range, 1.9-7.9 ng/mL), and 7 (range, 6-7), respectively. Mean follow-up was 19.8 months (range, 3.0-35.1 months). After salvage HIFU, 62% of the men were pad-free and leak-free. Mean International Index of Erectile Function-5 point score fell from 8.8 to 4.7 (P < .001). International Prostate Symptoms Score and RAND-SF36 scores were not affected. Two men developed rectourethral fistulae after 1 salvage procedure. A further 2 fistulae occurred in the 6 men undergoing a second salvage HIFU. Intervention for bladder outlet obstruction was needed in 20% (17 of 84 patients). If PSA nonresponders were included, 1- and 2-year progression-free survival rates were 59% (50 of 84 patients) and 43% (36 of 84 patients), respectively. If PSA nonresponders were excluded, 1- and 2-year progression-free survival rates were 62% (48 of 77 patients) and 48% (37 of 77 patients), respectively.

The authors conducted a prostate cancer case-control study in the Greek population to evaluate the association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6983267, located at region 3 of chromosome 8q24, with this type of cancer.  Methods:   Samples of total blood from 86 patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer and 99 healthy individuals were genotyped using real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Growth factor receptors are actively implicated in oncogenesis. PDGFR/EGFR mediated exacerbated signaling has a central participation and is contributory in fueling the signal transductions that gear up prostate cancer progression.  Materials and methods:   In this particular study, androgen sensitive, Prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) was used. Pretreatment of cell line with PDGF resulted in an enhanced proliferation of cells which was evaluated by MTT assay. Treatment of cell line with either alone Curcumin, EGCG, sulforaphane or in combination was evaluated. PDGFR/EGFR activation (phosphorylation) was studied using western blot.  Results:   Results indicated that phosphorylation was gradually downregulated after treatment with individual compound. However there was a remarkable decrease in cellular proliferation after a combinatorial approach which is indicative of the fact that PDGFR phosphorylation was decreased outstandingly as evaluated by MTT assay. That also gave a prominent decline in the expression and subsequent decrease in proliferation pattern of cells.  Conclusion:   Despite the fact that little is still known regarding the mechanistic insights by which phytonutrients act as barrier to cancer, and attempts to translate the studies from benchtop to bedside are in progress.

Validate optimal protocols for IG-IMRT using kilovoltage cone-beam CT (CBCT) are required.  Patients and methods:   Seventy-six patients with prostate cancer were treated using adaptive IG-IMRT. Based on the CBCT performed during the first 10 fractions of radiotherapy, an average prostate position in relation to the pelvic bones was determined in antero-posterior AP, supero-inferior SI, and right-left axes. An adapted treatment plan for the second phase of the treatment included an isocenter shift into its average position (correction of the systematic error sigma). A margin between a clinical and planned target volume (CTV-PTV) was adjusted according to the magnitude of random error sigma. During the second phase of radiotherapy, set-up of patients was performed daily on pelvic bones using kilovoltage skiagraphic imaging in two projections (kV-kV). Follow-up CBCTs were repeated once a week.  Results:   An average isocenter position differed from the position of a reference planning CT isocenter in at least one axis in 63 patients (83%). Major changes were recorded in AP axis - shift > or = 2 mm in 33 patients (43%), shift > or = 5 mm in 7 patients (9%). PTV for the second phase of radiotherapy was in the range of 6-10 mm in AP axis, 6-8 mm in SI axis, and 6 mm in RL axis. Mean sigma value in the AP axis was smaller in patients with a specific diet compared to patients without the diet (2.2 mm vs. 2.7 mm, p = 0.05). We evaluated 446 follow-up CBCT images from the second phase of radiotherapy (66 patients had 6 CBCT, 10 patients had 5 CBCT). Set-up error exceeding CTV-PTV margin occurred in 4 cases with no more than once per patient. Safety margin was sufficient in 72/76 patients (95%).  Conclusion:   IG-IMRT protocol integrating CBCT and kV-kV imaging provided adequate coverage of the target volume and proved to be compatible with departmental workflow.

In order to achieve substantial gain at these issues, both, primary prevention and secondary prevention, which is early detection of malignant lesions at a small size, have to be improved. So far, there is not only a lack in the necessary infrastructure not only in Germany, but rather worldwide, but additionally the techniques developed so far for early detection have a significance and specificity too low as to warrant safe implementation for screening programs. However, the advancements recently achieved in endoscopy and in quantitative analysis of hypocellular specimens open new perspectives for secondary prevention. Chromoendoscopy and narrow band imaging (NBI) pinpoint suspicious lesions more easily, confocal endomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography obtain optical sections through those lesions, and hyperspectral imaging classifies lesions according to characteristic spectral signatures. These techniques therefore obtain optical biopsies. Once a ""bloody"" biopsy has been taken, the plethora of parameters that can be quantified objectively has been increased and could be the basis for an objective and quantitative classification of epithelial lesions (multiparametric cytometry, quantitative histology). Finally, cytomics and proteomics approaches, and lab-on-the-chip technology might help to identify patients at high-risk. Sensitivity and specificity of these approaches have to be validated, yet, and some techniques have to be adapted for the specific conditions for early detection of head and neck cancer. On this background it has to be stated that it is still a long way to go until a population based screening for head and neck cancer is available.

Aberrant PTK6 expression and intracellular localization have been detected in human prostate tumors. In the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, the pool of endogenous activated PTK6, which is phosphorylated on tyrosine residue 342, is localized at the membrane. Expression of ectopic membrane-targeted PTK6 led to dramatic morphology changes and formation of peripheral adhesion complexes in PC3 cells. Peripheral adhesion complex formation was dependent upon PTK6 kinase activity. We demonstrated that p130 CRK-associated substrate (p130CAS) is a novel direct substrate of PTK6, and it works as a crucial adapter protein in inducing peripheral adhesion complexes. Activation of ERK5 downstream of p130CAS was indispensable for this process. Knockdown of endogenous PTK6 led to reduced cell migration and p130CAS phosphorylation, whereas knockdown of p130CAS attenuated oncogenic signaling induced by membrane-targeted PTK6, including ERK5 and AKT activation. Expression of membrane-targeted PTK6 promoted cell migration, which could be impaired by knockdown of p130CAS or ERK5.

We uncovered two distinct mechanisms by which NKX3-1 controls the AR transcriptional network in prostate cancer. First, NKX3-1 and AR directly regulate each other in a feed-forward regulatory loop. Second, NKX3-1 collaborates with AR and FoxA1 to mediate genes in advanced and recurrent prostate carcinoma. NKX3-1- and AR-coregulated genes include those found in the ""protein trafficking"" process, which integrates oncogenic signaling pathways. Moreover, we demonstrate that NKX3-1, AR, and FoxA1 promote prostate cancer cell survival by directly upregulating RAB3B, a member of the RAB GTPase family.

Dosimetry software determines the optimal placement of seeds for achieving the prescribed dose based on ultrasonic determination of the gland boundaries. However, because of prostate movement and distortion during the implantation procedure, some seeds may not be placed in the desired locations; this causes the delivered dose to differ from the prescribed dose. Current ultrasonic imaging methods generally cannot depict the implanted seeds accurately. We are investigating new ultrasonic imaging methods that show promise for enhancing the visibility of seeds and thereby enabling real-time detection and correction of seed-placement errors during the implantation procedure. Real-time correction of seed-placement errors will improve the therapeutic radiation dose delivered to target tissues. In this work, we compare the potential performance of a template-matching method and a previously published method based on singular spectrum analysis for imaging seeds. In particular, we evaluated how changes in seed angle and position relative to the ultrasound beam affect seed detection. The conclusion of the present study is that singular spectrum analysis has better sensitivity but template matching is more resistant to false positives; both perform well enough to make seed detection clinically feasible over a relevant range of angles and positions.

Results:   Significant differences were found only between patients and controls in D541E, R461Q and I97L genotypes, the remainder of the variants did not seem relevant to our population in contrast to other populations, such as north-Caucasians, Afro Americans and Ashkenazi Jews. The genotypes associated with the worst prognoses are G/G in D541E, A/A in R462Q and A/G in I97L. The controls were included in our study to determine an approximation of the genotype in our population compared with the patients, but they did not account for the statistical process.  Conclusions:   The genetic profile of patients with this cancer combined with other parameters could be used as a prognosis factor in deciding to give more radical and frequent treatments, depending on personal genotype.""","""['M J Alvarez-Cubero', 'C Entrala', 'F Fernandez-Rosado', 'L J Martinez-Gonzalez', 'J C Alvarez', 'A Suarez', 'J A Lorente', 'J M Cozar']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['RNASEL study of genetics of prostate cancer and its relation to clinical staging.', 'Mutation screening and association study of RNASEL as a prostate cancer susceptibility gene.', 'Carriage of mutations R462Q (rs 486907) and D541E (rs 627928) of the RNASEL gene and risk factors in patients with prostate cancer in Burkina Faso.', 'RNASEL mutation screening and association study in Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi prostate cancer patients.', 'Inherited genotype and prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Metabolic syndrome and esophageal cancer risk: a\xa0systematic review and\xa0meta‑analysis.', 'The Impact of African Ancestry on Prostate Cancer Disparities in the Era of Precision Medicine.', 'Prostate Cancer Genetics: A Review.', 'Confirmation of genetic variants associated with lethal prostate cancer in a cohort of men from hereditary prostate cancer families.', 'The potential impact of adding genetic markers to clinical parameters in managing high-risk prostate cancer patients.']"""

Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify 120,392 men undergoing RP for clinically localized prostate cancer between 1988 and 2003. Cause-specific mortality data were extracted through 2006 and cumulative incidence was estimated using a competing risks approach.  Results:   The stage distribution of the cancers was 32% local, 28% regional, 40% unknown, and 80% of tumors Gleason ≤ 7. Median follow-up was 7 years. The 15-year prostate cancer-specific mortality was 5.3% and the non-prostate cancer mortality was 30.6%. Stage, grade and race had minimal impact on non-prostate cancer mortality. At 15 years following surgery, mortality due to cardiovascular diseases was 11%, other cancers 9.1%, and other causes 10.5%. Among men ≥ 65 years, 15-year cancer-specific mortality was 6% and non-prostate cancer mortality was 40.8%.  Conclusions:   Following RP, death from cardiovascular diseases, other cancers, and other causes is far more common than death from prostate cancer.

The human PCa cell line VCaP secretes PAP and induces an osteoblastic reaction in bone similar to that seen in human PCa bone metastases.

In this study, we investigated the effects of hexane extracts of S. lappa (HESLs) on the migration of DU145 and TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells. DU145 and TRAMP-C2 cells were cultured in the presence of 0-4 μg/mL HESL with or without 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF). HESL inhibited the basal and EGF-induced migration of prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas HESL did not influence the viability of these cancer cells under the conditions used in this study. Active fractions of HESL were separated via column chromatography, and the structure of the active principle was determined using (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The active compound, dehydrocostus lactone (DHCL), in fraction 7 dose-dependently inhibited the basal and EGF-induced migration of prostate cancer cells. HESL and DHCL reduced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 secretion but increased TIMP-2 levels in both the absence and presence of EGF. Our results demonstrate that the inhibition of MMP-9 secretion and the stimulation of TIMP-2 secretion contribute to reduced migration of DU145 cells treated with HESL and DHCL.

However, the impact of such treatment on the patients' quality of life remains to be elucidated.  Objective:   The objective is to assess the impact of adjuvant hormonotherapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue after radical radiotherapy on anxiety and depression levels, cognitive function, sexual function and quality of life of prostate cancer patients.  Material and methods:   Two groups of patients were tested: men treated with adjuvant hormonotherapy (88 patients) and men without hormonotherapy (61 patients). Anxiety, depression and cognitive functions were evaluated. Patients answered questions addressing problems linked to hormonal equilibrium. The patients rated their mental status, physical status, quality of life and quality of their relationship.  Results:   There were no statistically significant differences between patients on hormonotherapy and without hormonotherapy in the level of anxiety and depression (p = 0.844 and p = 0.954) as well as in cognitive function (p = 0.661). Satisfactory sexual performance was preserved in 9/65 patients (14%) on hormonotherapy and the same was applied to 19/49 patients (39%) without hormonotherapy. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.003). Hormonotherapy was associated with decreased libido (p = 0.031), hot flushes (p < 0.001) and sweating (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in the self-rated physical and psychological well-being (p = 0.476 and p = 0.597), quality of life (p = 0.622) and quality of relationship (p = 0.064).

The internationally accepted criteria for cancer staging, the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system, includes: (1) tumor size and local growth (T); (2) extent of lymph node metastases (N); and (3) occurrence of distant metastases (M). Clinical stage is established before initiation of therapy and depends on the physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Pathologic stage is determined following surgical exploration of disease spread and histological examination of tissue. The TNM classification system has evolved over 50 years to accommodate increasing knowledge about cancer biology. Efforts are ongoing to keep the system both synchronized with the most sophisticated cancer technology and simple for ease of clinician/patient use. Upcoming molecular technologies, such as genomic and proteomic profiling of tumors, microRNA profiling, and even ex vivo living tumor tissue treatment, could improve the current TNM staging system. This chapter describes the current TNM system using breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancer examples.""","""['Stacy M Cowherd']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Tumor Staging and Grading: A Primer.', 'TNM: evolution and relation to other prognostic factors.', 'The TNM classification adapted to palliative care.', ""The 'Sentinel Node' Concept: More Questions Raised than Answers Provided?"", 'Multicentric and multifocal versus unifocal breast cancer: is the tumor-node-metastasis classification justified?', 'Liposomes in Cancer Therapy: How Did We Start and Where Are We Now.', 'WAVE3 upregulation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its effect on the migration of human esophageal cancer cell lines in vitro.', 'Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy as a Cancer Screening and Diagnostic Tool: A Review and Prospects.', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-3 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer following chemotherapy.', 'Comparison of Myeloid Cells in Circulation and in the Tumor Microenvironment of Patients with Colorectal and Breast Cancers.']"""

Also, somatic point mutations of NF2 mutation have been reported in tumours originated from nerve structures. A recent study revealed that NF2 gene was mutated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as well, suggesting a possibility that NF2 gene might be somatically mutated in other human cancers. The aim of this study was to explore whether NF2 genes are somatically mutated, and contribute to tumorigenesis in common human cancers.  Methods:   For this, we analysed the entire coding region of NF2 gene in 45 colorectal carcinomas, 45 gastric, 45 breast, 45 lung, 45 hepatocellular (HCC), 45 prostate carcinomas, and 45 acute leukaemias by a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay.  Results:   Overall, we found NF2 mutations in one HCC (1/45; 2.2%) (hepatitis B virus-related HCC), one lung carcinoma (1/45; 2.2%) (squamous cell carcinoma), and one acute leukaemia (1/45; 2.2%) (acute myelogenous leukaemia minimally differentiated). All of the mutations were missense mutations that would substitute amino acids in the NF2 protein (p.A238 V, p.A451T and p.R467K).  Conclusion:   Our data indicate that somatic mutation of NF2 gene is not prevalent in common human cancers, and its mutation somatically occurs in a minor fraction of HCC, lung cancer and acute leukaemia. These data suggest that somatic mutation of NF2 tumour suppressor gene may not play a central role in development of common cancers.""","""['Nam Jin Yoo', 'Sang Wook Park', 'Sug Hyung Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Pathology""","""['Mutational analysis of caspase-14 gene in common carcinomas.', 'Somatic mutation of PHF6 gene in T-cell acute lymphoblatic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Somatic mutations of ERBB2 kinase domain in gastric, colorectal, and breast carcinomas.', 'Neurofibromatosis type 2 and von Hippel-Lindau disease: from gene cloning to function.', 'Genetic models of human cancer as a multistep process.

The geometric uncertainties in point-based rigid-body matching algorithms during localization of prostate fiducial markers can be quantified in terms of a fiducial registration error (FRE). In this study, the aim is to demonstrate how statistical process control (SPC) can be used to intercept potential problems with rigid-body matching algorithms in a retrospective study of FRE for a pilot cohort of 34 patients with fiducial markers. A procedure for estimating control parameters of a SPC control chart (x-chart) from a small number of initial observations (N) of FRE was implemented. The sensitivity analysis of N on the number of 'in-control' and 'out-of-control' x-charts was also performed. Uncorrected rotational offsets of an individual patient were examined to elucidate possible correlations with the behaviours of an x-chart. Four specific types of qualitative x-chart behaviour have been observed. The number of out-of-control processes was insensitive to the choice of N, provided N ≥ 5. Residual errors of rigid-body registration were contributed from uncorrected rotational offsets in 5 out of 15 'out-of-control' x-charts. Out-of-control x-charts were also shown to be correlated with potential changes in the IGRT processes, which may compromise the quality of the radiation treatment delivery.

Because overexpression of Bcl-2 family members are implicated in chemotherapeutic resistance in prostate cancer, we investigated the cooperative effects of Pim kinase inhibition with ABT-737, a small molecule antagonist of Bcl-2 family members. Strikingly, the addition of ABT-737 to Pim inhibitors triggered a robust apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Pim inhibitors decreased levels of the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1, both by blocking 5'-cap dependent translation and decreasing protein half life. In addition, Pim inhibition transcriptionally increased levels of the BH3 protein Noxa by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR), lead to eIF-2α phosphorylation and increased expression of CHOP. Increased levels of Noxa also inactivated the remaining levels of Mcl-1 protein activity. Notably, these specific protein changes were essential to the apoptotic process because ABT-737 did not inhibit Mcl-1 protein activity and Mcl-1 overexpression blocked the apoptotic activity of ABT-737.

There are considerable advantages to integrating both modalities in a single scanner that enables truly simultaneous acquisition. However, there are also concerns about the possible degradation of both PET and MR performance in an integrated system. This paper evaluates the performance of the Biograph mMR during independent and simultaneous acquisition of PET and morphologic MR data.  Methods:   The NEMA NU 2-2007 protocol was followed for studying the PET performance. The following measurements were performed: spatial resolution; scatter fraction, count losses, and randoms; sensitivity; accuracy of the correction for count losses and randoms; and image quality. The quality control manual of the American College of Radiology was followed for studying the MR performance. The following measurements were performed: geometric accuracy, spatial resolution, low-contrast detectability, signal-to-noise ratio, static field (B(0)) homogeneity, radiofrequency field (B(1)) homogeneity, and radiofrequency noise.  Results:   An average spatial resolution of 4.3 mm in full width at half maximum was measured at 1 cm offset from the center of the field of view. The system sensitivity was 15.0 kcps/MBq along the center of the scanner. The scatter fraction was 37.9%, and the peak noise-equivalent count rate was 184 kcps at 23.1 kBq/mL. The maximum absolute value of the relative count rate error due to dead-time losses and randoms was 5.5%. The average residual error in scatter and attenuation correction was 12.1%. All MR parameters were within the tolerances defined by the American College of Radiology. B(0) inhomogeneities below 1 ppm were measured in a 120-mm radius. B(1) homogeneity and signal-to-noise ratio were equivalent to those of a standard MR scanner. No radiofrequency interference was detected.  Conclusion:   These results compare favorably with other state-of-the-art PET/CT and PET/MR scanners, indicating that the integration of the PET detectors in the MR scanner and their operation within the magnetic field do not have a perceptible impact on the overall performance. The MR subsystem performs essentially like a standalone system. However, further work is necessary to evaluate the more advanced MR applications, such as functional imaging and spectroscopy.""","""['Gaspar Delso', 'Sebastian Fürst', 'Björn Jakoby', 'Ralf Ladebeck', 'Carl Ganter', 'Stephan G Nekolla', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Sibylle I Ziegler']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['NEMA NU 2-2012 performance studies for the SiPM-based ToF-PET component of the GE SIGNA PET/MR system.', 'Monte Carlo simulations of the count rate performance of a clinical whole-body MR/PET scanner.', 'Performance characteristics obtained for a new 3-dimensional lutetium oxyorthosilicate-based whole-body PET/CT scanner with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU 2-2001 standard.', 'Integrated PET/MR.', 'Combined PET/MR systems: an overview and comparison of currently available options.', 'Longitudinal associations between β-amyloid and cortical thickness in mild cognitive impairment.', 'Operationalizing the centiloid scale for 18Fflorbetapir PET studies on PET/MRI.', 'Is there more than meets the eye in PSMA imaging in prostate cancer with PET/MRI?

The current study aims at developing clinically translatable bombesin antagonist-based radioligands for SPECT and PET of GRPr-positive tumors.  Methods:   A potent bombesin antagonist (PEG(4)-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH(2) [AR]) was synthesized; conjugated to the chelators DOTA, 6-carboxy-1,4,7,11-tetraazaundecane (N4), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane, 1-glutaric acid-4,7 acetic acid (NODAGA), and 4,11-bis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,8,11-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane (CB-TE2A); and radiolabeled with (111)In, (99m)Tc, (68)Ga, and (64)Cu, respectively. The radioconjugates were evaluated in vitro and in vivo in PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice. Antagonist potency was determined by Ca(2+)-flux measurements and immunofluorescence.  Results:   All the conjugates showed high binding affinity to GRPr (inhibitory concentration of 50% [IC(50)], 2.5-25 nmol/L). The immunofluorescence and Ca(2+)-flux assays confirmed the antagonist properties of the conjugates. Biodistribution revealed high and specific uptake in PC-3 tumor and in GRPr-positive tissues. Tumor uptake of (64)Cu-CB-TE2A-AR (31.02 ± 3.35 percentage injected activity per gram [%IA/g]) was higher than (99m)Tc-N4-AR (24.98 ± 5.22 %IA/g), (111)In-DOTA-AR (10.56 ± 0.70 %IA/g), and (68)Ga-NODAGA-AR (7.11 ± 3.26 %IA/g) at 1 h after injection. Biodistribution at later time points showed high tumor-to-background ratios because of the fast washout of the radioligand from normal organs, compared with tumor. High tumor-to-background ratios were further illustrated by PET and SPECT images of PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice acquired at 12 h after injection showing high tumor uptake, clear background, and negligible or no radioactivity in the abdomen.

However, more recently it appeared that the gap junction proteins (connexins) could be re-expressed and participate to cancer cell dissemination during the late stages of tumor progression. Since primary tumors of prostate cancer (PCa) are known to be connexin deficient, it was interesting to verify whether their bone-targeted metastatic behaviour could be influenced by the re-expression of the connexin type (connexin43) which is originally present in prostate tissue and highly expressed in bone where it participates to the differentiation of osteoblastic cells. Thus, we investigated the effect of the increased Cx43 expression, by retroviral infection, on the metastatic behaviour of two well-characterized cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP) representing different stages of PCa progression. It appeared that Cx43 differently behaved in those cell lines and induced different phenotypes. In LNCaP, Cx43 was functional, localized at the plasma membrane and its high expression was correlated with a more aggressive phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, those Cx43-expressing LNCaP cells exhibited a high incidence of osteolytic metastases generated by bone xenografts in mice. Interestingly, LNCaP cells were also able to decrease the proliferation of cocultured osteoblastic cells. In contrast, the increased expression of Cx43 in PC-3 cells led to an unfunctional, cytoplasmic localization of the protein and was correlated with a reduction of proliferation, adhesion and invasion of the cells. In conclusion, the localization and the functionality of Cx43 may govern the ability of PCa cells to metastasize in bones.""","""['Coralie Lamiche', 'Jonathan Clarhaut', 'Pierre-Olivier Strale', 'Sophie Crespin', 'Nathalie Pedretti', 'François-Xavier Bernard', 'Christian C Naus', 'Vincent C Chen', 'Leonard J Foster', 'Norah Defamie', 'Marc Mesnil', 'Françoise Debiais', 'Laurent Cronier']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Suppression of human prostate cancer cell growth by forced expression of connexin genes.', 'Connexin 43 expression is associated with increased malignancy in prostate cancer cell lines and functions to promote migration.', 'Prognostic impact of reduced connexin43 expression and gap junction coupling of neoplastic stromal cells in giant cell tumor of bone.', ""Gap junction connexins in female reproductive organs: implications for women's reproductive health."", 'Beyond gap junctions: Connexin43 and bone cell signaling.', 'Intercellular delivery of therapeutic oligonucleotides.', 'A Connexin-Based Biomarker Model Applicable for Prognosis and Immune Landscape Assessment in Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Connexins and Glucose Metabolism in Cancer.', 'The global status of research in prostate cancer bone metastasis: A bibliometric and visualized analysis.', 'Tubulin Isotypes: Emerging Roles in Defining Cancer Stem Cell Niche.']"""

The objective of this study was to correlate immunohistochemical ERG protein expression with clinico-pathological parameters at radical prostatectomy specimens, and to determine its predictive value for postoperative disease recurrence and progression in a prostate cancer screening cohort. Since androgen receptor is downregulated by ERG in cell lines, we also compared the expression of respective proteins. We selected 481 participants from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer treated by radical prostatectomy for prostate adenocarcinoma. A tissue microarray was constructed containing representative cores of all prostate cancer specimens as well as 22 xenografts and seven cell lines. Immunohistochemical expression of ERG and androgen receptor was correlated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason sum, pT-stage, surgical margins, biochemical recurrence, local recurrence, overall death and disease-specific death. ERG expression was detected in 284 patients (65%). Expression occurred significantly more frequent in patients with PSA ≤10 ng/ml (P=0.024). There was no significant association between ERG and Gleason sum, pT-stage or surgical margin status. PSA (P=0.011), Gleason sum (P=0.003), pT-stage (P=0.001) and surgical margin status (P<0.001) all had independent value for postoperative biochemical recurrence, while positive surgical margin (P=0.021) was the only independent predictor for local recurrence. ERG protein expression did not have prognostic value for the clinical end points in uni- and multivariate analyses. A positive correlation existed between ERG and androgen receptor expression in single tissue cores (P<0.001).

Methods and materials:   A prospective Phase I-II study enrolled patients with any of the following: clinical Stage T3 disease, prostate-specific antigen level ≥20 ng/mL, or Gleason score 8-10. Radiotherapy consisted of 45 Gy (1.8 Gy per fraction) to the pelvic lymph nodes with a concomitant 22.5 Gy intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost to the prostate, for a total of 67.5 Gy (2.7 Gy per fraction) in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. Daily image guidance was performed using three gold seed fiducials. Quality of life was measured using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), a validated tool that assesses four primary domains (urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal).  Results:   From 2004 to 2007, 97 patients were treated. Median follow-up was 39 months. Compared with baseline, at 24 months there was no statistically significant change in the mean urinary domain score (p = 0.99), whereas there were decreases in the bowel (p < 0.01), sexual (p < 0.01), and hormonal (p < 0.01) domains. The proportion of patients reporting a clinically significant difference in EPIC urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal scores at 24 months was 27%, 31%, 55%, and 60%, respectively. However, moderate and severe distress related to these symptoms was minimal, with increases of only 3% and 5% in the urinary and bowel domains, respectively.  Conclusions:   Hypofractionated radiotherapy combined with long-term androgen deprivation therapy was well tolerated. Although there were modest rates of clinically significant patient-reported urinary and bowel toxicity, most of this caused only mild distress, and moderate and severe effects on QOL were limited.

Antioxidants could potentially counteract the pro-oxidant effects of RT and compromise therapeutic efficacy. We performed a prospective study nested within the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) randomized trial to determine if supplemental antioxidant use during RT for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer death or metastases.  Methods and materials:   PHS participants (383) received RT for prostate cancer while randomized to receive beta-carotene (50 mg on alternate days) or placebo. The primary endpoint was time from RT to lethal prostate cancer, defined as prostate cancer death or bone metastases. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival probabilities and the log-rank test to compare groups. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the effect of beta-carotene compared with that of placebo during RT.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 10.5 years, there was no significant difference between risk of lethal prostate cancer with the use of beta-carotene during RT compared with that of placebo (hazard ratio = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-1.24; p = 0.24). After we adjusted for age at RT, prostate-specific antigen serum level, Gleason score, and clinical stage, the difference remained nonsignificant. The 10-year freedom from lethal prostate cancer was 92% (95% CI, 87-95%) in the beta-carotene group and 89% (95% CI, 84-93%) in the placebo group.  Conclusion:   The use of supplemental antioxidant beta-carotene during RT was not associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer death or metastases.

We, therefore, developed an expansion/de-expansion tool to quantify the contour errors and determine the location of the deviations.  Methods and materials:   A planning CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging scan were prospectively acquired for 10 patients with prostate cancer. The prostate glands were contoured by 3 independent observers using the CT data sets with instructions to contour the prostate without underestimation but to minimize overestimation. The standard prostate for each patient was defined using magnetic resonance imaging and CT on multiple planes. After registration of the CT and magnetic resonance imaging data sets, the CT-defined prostates were scored for accuracy. The contours were defined as ideal if they were within a 2.5-mm expansion of the standard without underestimation, acceptable if they were within a 5.0-mm expansion and a 2.5-mm de-expansion, and unacceptable if they extended >5.0 mm or underestimated the prostate by >2.5 mm.  Results:   A total of 636 CT slices were individually analyzed, with the vast majority scored as ideal or acceptable. However, none of the 30 prostate contour sets had all the contours scored as ideal or acceptable. For all 3 observers, the unacceptable contours were more likely from underestimation than overestimation of the prostate. The errors were more common at the base and apex than the mid-gland.  Conclusions:   The expansion/de-expansion tool allows for directed feedback on the location of contour deviations, as well as the determination of over- or underestimation of the prostate.

Methods and materials:   A cohort of 1,060 prostate cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy was divided into nine subgroups based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk category and estimated 10-year overall survival (eOS 10y) derived from the age adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index. Patients with and without biochemical control were compared with respect to overall survival. Actuarial estimates of overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used for analysis of overall survival.  Results:   Median follow-up was 125 months (range, 51-176 months). Only the subgroups with high or intermediate risk disease and an eOS 10y of >90% had a statistically significantly improved overall survival when prostate cancer was biochemically controlled. In all other groups, biochemical control made no significant difference to overall survival. In the subgroup with high-risk disease and eOS 10y >90%, actuarial overall survival was 86.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 78.5%-94.1%) and 62.1% (95% CI 52.9%-71.3%) for patients with biochemical control and biochemical relapse respectively (p = 0.002).

Results:   Compared to lung tumor nodules treated with soy isoflavones or radiation, lung tissues from mice treated with both modalities showed that soy isoflavones augmented radiation-induced destruction of A549 lung tumor nodules leading to small residual tumor nodules containing degenerating tumor cells with large vacuoles. Soy isoflavones decreased the hemorrhages, inflammation and fibrosis caused by radiation in lung tissue, suggesting protection of normal lung tissue.

Objective:   Update a nomogram predicting the presence of LNI in patients treated with ePLND at the time of radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 588 patients with clinically localised PCa treated between September 2006 and October 2010 at a single tertiary referral centre.  Intervention:   All patients underwent RP and ePLND invariably including removal of obturator, external iliac, and hypogastric nodes.  Measurements:   Prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, and primary and secondary biopsy Gleason grade as well as percentage of positive cores were included in univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) logistic regression models predicting LNI and formed the basis for the regression coefficient-based nomogram. The area under the curve (AUC) method was used to quantify the predictive accuracy (PA) of the model.  Results and limitations:   The mean number of lymph nodes removed and examined was 20.8 (median: 19; range: 10-52). LNI was found in 49 of 588 patients (8.3%). All preoperative PCa characteristics differed significantly between LNI-positive and LNI-negative patients (all p<0.001). In UVA predictive accuracy analyses, percentage of positive cores was the most accurate predictor of LNI (AUC: 79.5%). At MVA, clinical stage, primary biopsy Gleason grade, and percentage of positive cores were independent predictors of LNI (all p≤0.006). The updated nomogram demonstrated a bootstrap-corrected PA of 87.6%. Using a 5% nomogram cut-off, 385 of 588 patients (65.5%) would be spared ePLND. and LNI would be missed in only 6 patients (1.5%). The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value associated with the 5% cut-off were 87.8%, 70.3%, and 98.4%, respectively. The relatively low number of patients included as well as the lack of an external validation represent the main limitations of our study.  Conclusions:   We report the first update of a nomogram predicting the presence of LNI in patients treated with ePLND. The nomogram maintained high accuracy, even in more contemporary patients (87.6%). Because percentage of positive cores represents the foremost predictor of LNI, its inclusion should be mandatory in any LNI prediction model.

Here we investigated FRS2 and FRS3 as a means of disrupting global FGF signalling in prostate cancer.  Methods:   FRS2 and FRS3 manipulation was investigated in vitro using over-expression, knockdown and functional assays. FRS2 and FRS3 expression was profiled in cell lines and clinical tumors of different grades.  Results:   In a panel of cell lines we observed ubiquitous FRS2 and FRS3 transcript and protein expression in both benign and malignant cells. We next tested functional redundancy of FRS2 and FRS3 in prostate cancer cells. In DU145 cells, specific FRS2 suppression inhibited FGF induced signalling. This effect was not apparent in cells stably over-expressing FRS3. Indeed FRS3 over-expression resulted in enhanced proliferation (p = 0.005) compared to control cells. Given this functional redundancy, we tested the therapeutic principle of dual targeting of FRS2 and FRS3 in prostate cancer. Co-suppression of FRS2 and FRS3 significantly inhibited ERK activation with a concomitant reduction in cell proliferation (p < 0.05), migration and invasion (p < 0.05). Synchronous knockdown of FRS2 and FRS3 with exposure to cytotoxic irradiation resulted in a significant reduction in prostate cancer cell survival compared to irradiation alone (p < 0.05). Importantly, this synergistic effect was not observed in benign cells. Finally, we investigated expression of FRS2 and FRS3 transcript in a cohort of micro-dissected tumors of different grades as well as by immunohistochemistry in clinical biopsies. Here, we did not observe any difference in expression between benign and malignant biopsies.

Patients and methods:   • Phi was developed as a combination of PSA, free PSA, and a PSA precursor form [-2]proPSA to calculate the probability of prostate cancer and was used as an aid in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostatic conditions for men with a borderline PSA test (e.g. PSA 2-10 ng/mL or 4-10 ng/mL) and non-suspicious digital rectal examination. • We constructed a Markov model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis to estimate expected costs and utilities of prostate cancer detection and consequent treatment for the annual prostate cancer screening in the male population aged 50-75 years old. • The transition probabilities, health state utilities and prostate cancer treatment costs were derived from the published literature. The diagnostic performance of phi was obtained from a multi-centre study. Diagnostic related costs were obtained from the 2009 Medicare Fee Schedule. • Cost-effectiveness was compared between the strategies of PSA test alone and PSA plus phi under two PSA thresholds (≥2 ng/mL and ≥4 ng/mL) to recommend a prostate biopsy.  Results:   • Over 25 annual screening cycles, the strategy of PSA plus phi dominated the PSA-only strategy using both thresholds of PSA ≥2 ng/mL and PSA ≥4 ng/mL, and was estimated to save $1199 or $443, with an expected gain of 0.08 or 0.03 quality adjusted life years, respectively. • The probabilities of PSA plus phi being cost effective were approximately 77-70% or 78-71% at a range of $0-$200,000 willingness to pay using PSA thresholds ≥2 ng/mL and ≥4 ng/mL, respectively.

Active surveillance (AS) is a well-recognised management strategy to minimise the morbidity associated with radical treatment of prostate cancer. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines initially suggested that all men with low-risk prostate cancer should first be offered AS. The cohort of men with upstaging and upgrading of prostate cancer from diagnosis to final pathology has been described in North American and European populations. As the rate of PSA testing in Britain is lower than North America and parts of Europe, the risk of more advanced disease at diagnosis of prostate cancer is higher. The present study is one of the first to examine this cohort in a British population and found the rate of features of advanced disease (extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement and Gleason 4 + 3, or 8-10) to be 37.2%.  Objective:   To determine if the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for men with low-risk prostate cancer were generally applicable in unscreened populations.  Patients and methods:   Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected case series from a single tertiary care centre in England. In all, 700 consecutive men treated for prostate cancer from 2005 by robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) were included. Patients satisfying NICE criteria for low-risk disease (PSA level < 10 ng/mL and Gleason score ≤ 6 and cT1-2a) had their pathological samples analysed for advanced disease, defined as extracapsular extension (ECE: pT3), seminal vesicle involvement (SVI), Gleason sum 7, or 8-10 or node-positive disease.  Results:   In all, 275 patients (39.2%) met the NICE low-risk criteria, but pathologically advanced disease was found in 37.2% of this group. There was ECE in 71 patients (25.8%), 10 had SVI (3.6%), nine (3.3%) had Gleason score 7(4 + 3), and 12 had Gleason sum 8-10 (4.4%).  Conclusions:   The NICE guidance was developed largely on data from North America where populations are highly screened using PSA testing. In the UK, many men with low-risk disease features have high-risk disease and the general applicability of the NICE guidance is questionable in unscreened populations.

Hypermethylation of genes such as glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) occurs with high frequency in prostate tumour tissue but is much less common in the benign prostate; however, the potential value of gene methylation biomarkers as an adjunct to biopsy histopathology has had little study. When measured in histologically benign prostate biopsy tissue, APC gene hypermethylation was found to have high negative predictive value and high sensitivity. GSTP1 hypermethylation was found to have lower performance than APC.  Objective:   To evaluate the performance of DNA methylation biomarkers in the setting of repeat biopsy in men with an initially negative prostate biopsy but a high index of suspicion for missed prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   We prospectively evaluated 86 men with an initial histologically negative prostate biopsy and high-risk features. All men underwent repeat 12-core ultrasonography-guided biopsy. DNA methylation of glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) was determined using tissue from the initially negative biopsy and compared with histology of the repeat biopsy. The primary outcome was the relative negative predictive value (NPV) of APC compared with GSTP1, and its 95% confidence interval (CI).  Results:   On repeat biopsy, 21/86 (24%) men had prostate cancer. APC and GSTP1 methylation ratios below the threshold (predicting no cancer) produced a NPV of 0.96 and 0.80, respectively. The relative NPV was 1.2 (95% CI: 1.06-1.36), indicating APC has significantly higher NPV. Methylation ratios above the threshold yielded a sensitivity of 0.95 for APC and 0.43 for GSTP1. Combining both methylation markers produced a performance similar to that of APC alone. APC methylation patterns were consistent with a possible field effect or occurrence early in carcinogenesis.  Conclusions:   APC methylation provided a very high NPV with a low percentage of false-negatives, in the first prospective study to evaluate performance of DNA methylation markers in a clinical cohort of men undergoing repeat biopsy.

IMP3 expression was associated with features of aggressive biology and aggressive prostate cancer recurrence after surgery. Although IMP3 is differentially expressed in patients with features of biologically aggressive prostate cancer, it does not have independent prognostic value in patients treated with RP.  Objective:   To evaluate the association of insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein 3 (IMP3) with pathological features and outcomes in patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   Immunohistochemical staining for IMP3 was performed on archival tissue microarray specimens from 232 consecutive patients treated with RP for clinically localized disease. None of the patients received neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation or hormone therapy. IMP3 expression was histologically categorized as normal or abnormal. Disease recurrence was classified as aggressive if metastases were present, post-recurrence prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time was less than 10 months, or if the patients failed to respond to salvage local radiation therapy.  Results:   The median follow-up was 69.8 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 40.1-99.5). IMP3 expression was abnormal in 42 (18.1%) of 232 patients. IMP3 expression was associated with extracapsular extension (P= 0.020), seminal vesicle invasion (P= 0.024), lymphovascular invasion (P= 0.036) and a high pathological Gleason score (P= 0.009). The 5-year PSA recurrence-free survival for IMP3-negative patients was 83% (standard error [SE]= 3) vs 67% (SE = 8) in IMP3-positive patients (log-rank test, P= 0.015).

Active surveillance for prostate cancer is gaining increasing acceptance for low risk prostate cancer. Focal therapy is an emerging tissue preservation strategy that aims for treat only areas of cancer. Early phase trials have shown that side-effects can be significantly reduced using focal therapy. There is significant uncertainty in both active surveillance and focal therapy. This consensus group paper provides a road-map for clinical practice and research for both tissue-preserving strategies in the areas of patient population, tools for risk stratification and cancer localisation, treatment interventions as well as comparators and outcome measures in future comparative trials.  Objective:   To reach consensus on key issues for clinical practice and future research in active surveillance and focal therapy in managing localized prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   A group of expert urologists, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists and computer scientists from North America and Europe met to discuss issues in patient population, interventions, comparators and outcome measures to use in both tissue-preserving strategies of active surveillance and focal therapy. Break-out sessions were formed to provide agreement or highlight areas of disagreement on individual topics which were then collated by a writing group into statements that formed the basis of this report and agreed upon by the whole Transatlantic Consensus Group.  Results:   The Transatlantic group propose that emerging diagnostic tools such as precision imaging and transperineal prostate mapping biopsy can improve prostate cancer care. These tools should be integrated into prostate cancer management and research so that better risk stratification and more effective treatment allocation can be applied.

Expression of RGMs was examined in prostate cancer cell lines and prostate cancer tissues using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Knockdown of each RGM in prostate cancer cells was performed using the respective anti-RGMA, RGMB and RGMC transgenes. A variety of in vitro function tests were employed to analyze the influence on cancer cell functions by RGM knockdown. The implications of RGM knockdown in BMP signalling were also examined using both Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR. Knockdown of RGMA had no effect on cell growth, migration and invasion, but promoted cell-matrix adhesion. Knockdown of RGMB and RGMC increased growth and adhesion, but only RGMB knockdown increased capacities of migration and invasion in PC-3 cells. Further investigations showed an increase in Smad-3 activation and reduced levels of Smad-1 in PC-3 cells by RGMB and RGMC knockdown, and also an up-regulation of ID1, a BMP target gene particularly in exposure to BMP7.

Here we demonstrate that a polyphenolic extract derived from ripe berries of Solanum nigrum (SN) differentially causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various human prostate cancer cells without affecting normal prostate epithelial cells. Virally transformed normal human prostate epithelial PZ-HPV-7 cells and their cancer counterpart CA-HPV-10 cells, were used to evaluate the growth-inhibitory effects of the SN extract. SN treatment (5-20 µg/ml) of PZ-HPV-7 cells resulted in growth inhibitory responses of low magnitude. In sharp contrast, SN treatment of CA-HPV-10 cells increased cytotoxicity, decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis. Similar results were noted in the human prostate cancer LNCaP, 22Rv1, DU145 and PC-3 cell lines, where significant reductions in cell viability and induction of apoptosis was observed in all these cells, an effect independent of disease stage and androgen association. Cell cycle analysis revealed that SN treatment (5-20 µg/ml) resulted in a dose-dependent G2/M phase arrest and subG1 accumulation in the CA-HPV-10 but not in the PZ-HPV-7 cell line. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate that the SN extract is capable of selectively inhibiting cellular proliferation and accelerating apoptotic events in prostate cancer cells.

However, little is known about the role of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to test ERG expression in ovarian cancer and its potential as a diagnostic marker for ovarian carcinoma progression. A tissue microarray containing 180 ovarian cancer tissues of various pathological types and grades were examined by immunohistochemical analysis for expression of ERG. We also used 40 prostate carcinoma tissues and 40 normal tissues for comparison in parallel experiments. ERG-positive expression was detected in 40% of the prostate tumor cancer, as well as in internal positive control endothelial cells, confirming over-expression of ERG in prostate cancer at relatively the same rate observed by others. In contrast, all of the ovarian tumor patient tissues of varying histologic types were ERG-negative, despite some positivity in endothelial cells.

The results were compared to pathological parameters and the MVD in the corresponding paraffin-embedded material, as determined by immunohistochemistry against CD31 and CD34. Comparing mRNA expression in matched normal and tumour samples, only CAV1 showed relevant differences, being down-regulated in tumour tissues (fold change=-1.89, P<0.0001). CAV1 down-regulation correlated with pT category (P=0.006) and the Gleason score (P=0.041). In a univariate analysis, lower CAV1 mRNA expression was associated with biochemical recurrence (P=0.019). By immunohistochemistry, CAV1 was mainly localized in endothelial and stromal cells and showed a weaker staining pattern in the tumour compared to normal tissue. Furthermore, MVD significantly correlated with tumour grade and pT category. There was no significant association between endothelial mRNA expression and histologically determined MVD in tumour tissues, but only a trend for CD31 mRNA (P=0.074) and an inverse trend for CAV1 mRNA (P=0.056).

Mechanisms by which SLUG promotes migration and invasion in prostate cancers remain elusive.  Methods:   Expression level of CXCR4 and CXCL12 was examined by Western blot, RT-PCR, and qPCR analyses. Forced expression of SLUG was mediated by retroviruses, and SLUG and CXCL12 was downregulated by shRNAs-expressing lentiviruses. Migration and invasion of prostate cancer were measured by scratch-wound assay and invasion assay, respectively.  Research:   We demonstrated that forced expression of SLUG elevated CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression in human prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145, 22RV1, and LNCaP; conversely, reduced expression of SLUG by shRNA downregulated CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression at RNA and protein levels in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of SLUG increased MMP9 expression and activity in PC3, 22RV1, and DU-145 cells, and SLUG knockdown by shRNA downregulated MMP9 expression. We showed that CXCL12 is required for SLUG-mediated MMP9 expression in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we found that migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells was increased by ectopic expression of SLUG and decreased by SLUG knockdown. Notably, knockdown of CXCL12 by shRNA impaired SLUG-mediated migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   In this prospective study bone mass density (BMD) was assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 97 PCa patients and 89 patients of compared group. DXA was examined at baseline and patients in the study group were subjected to ADT. PCa patients with osteoporosis were treated by calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonate and the subsequent DXA was made after 10 months. All other PCa patients (non-osteoporotic) had DXA examined every 12-14 months.  Results:   Patients of the study group had significantly lower baseline L1-L4 and total hip BMD (p=0.028, p=0.022). BMD was significantly lower in L1-L4 and total hip (p=0.004, p<0.001, resp.) after 10-14 months and in L1-L4, femoral neck, and total hip (p=0.001, p=0.037, p< 0.001, resp.) after 20-26 months of ADT. After the treatment for osteoporosis with bisphosphonate a significant increase of BMD (p=0.04) was found in a total of 23 patients. Overall, the incidence of fractures after 20-26 months of ADT was 8.5 %.  Conclusions:   Osteopenia is very common in hormone naive PCa patients. There was a significant loss of BMD after 12 months of ADT which was progressive while the patients were on ADT. Bisphosphonate therapy was effective after 20 months of treatment.

We define the degree of a node as the number of genes significantly associated with the node and identify hub genes as those with the highest degree. The correlation network was pruned using transcription factor binding information in VisANT (http://visant.bu.edu/) as a biological filter. The reliability of hub genes was determined using a strict permutation test. Separate networks for normal prostate samples, and prostate cancer samples from African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA) were generated and compared. We found that the same hubs control disease progression in AA and EA networks. Combining AA and EA samples, we generated networks for low low (<7) and high (≥7) Gleason grade tumors. A comparison of their major hubs with those of the network for normal samples identified two types of changes associated with disease: (i) Some hub genes increased their degree in the tumor network compared to their degree in the normal network, suggesting that these genes are associated with gain of regulatory control in cancer (e.g. possible turning on of oncogenes). (ii) Some hubs reduced their degree in the tumor network compared to their degree in the normal network, suggesting that these genes are associated with loss of regulatory control in cancer (e.g. possible loss of tumor suppressor genes). A striking result was that for both AA and EA tumor samples, STAT5a, CEBPB and EGR1 are major hubs that gain neighbors compared to the normal prostate network. Conversely, HIF-lα is a major hub that loses connections in the prostate cancer network compared to the normal prostate network. We also find that the degree of these hubs changes progressively from normal to low grade to high grade disease, suggesting that these hubs are master regulators of prostate cancer and marks disease progression. STAT5a was identified as a central hub, with ~120 neighbors in the prostate cancer network and only 81 neighbors in the normal prostate network. Of the 120 neighbors of STAT5a, 57 are known cancer related genes, known to be involved in functional pathways associated with tumorigenesis.

Prognostic tools, such as the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score and the 1998 Kattan and 2006 Stephenson nomograms, predicting biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy are widely used for treatment decision making and counselling patients. However, tools derived in certain cohorts tend to perform less well when they are applied to populations that are dissimilar in terms of population or disease characteristics, health systems or treatment practices. Some of the loss in accuracy of a prognostic tool is a consequence of unknown factors and hence the performance of a tool when applied to a different population is unknown and largely unpredictable. This study validates these widely used tools in South Australian patients treated at three public hospitals. All three tools discriminated well according to risk of recurrence in these patients. However, when compared against observed rates of recurrence, it was found that predictions of recurrence varied widely between the three tools, suggesting that their use in counselling patients on such risk may not be appropriate. Interestingly, the oldest of the three tools (Kattan 1998) was the best predictor of absolute risk of recurrence. In the paper, this is linked to later adoption of updated Gleason grading, among other factors.  Summary:   In many countries, prognostic tools, which draw on the experience of thousands of patients with cancer, are used to predict cancer outcomes, but accuracy varies. This paper compares the accuracy of three widely used tools predicting prostate cancer recurrence after surgery in Australian patients. The results show that all tools were good at predicting which patients were most likely to experience recurrence and which were least. However, prediction of absolute risk varied and the oldest tool was the most accurate.  Objective:   • To compare performance of the CAPRA score and two commonly used risk assessment nomograms, the 1998 Kattan and the 2006 Stephenson, in an untested Australian cohort.  Patients and methods:   • We present data on 635 men from the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Database who underwent radical prostatectomy between January 1996 and May 2009 and had all required variables for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR). • BCR was defined as prostate-specific antigen ≥ 0.2 ng/mL or secondary treatment for a rising prostate-specific antigen. • Accuracy was evaluated using Harrell's concordance index, plotting calibration curves, and constructing decision analysis curves.  Results:   • Concordance indices were high for all three tools: 0.791, 0.787 and 0.744 for the 2006 Stephenson nomogram, CAPRA score and 1998 Kattan nomogram respectively. • At 3 years, calibration of the tools (agreement between predicted and observed BCR-free probability) was close to ideal for the 1998 Kattan nomogram, whereas the 2006 Stephenson model underestimated and the CAPRA model overestimated BCR-free probability. • The 1998 Kattan and 2005 CAPRA tools performed better than the 2006 Stephenson nomogram across a wide range of threshold probabilities using decision curve analysis.  Conclusion:   • All three tools discriminate between patients' risk effectively. • Absolute estimates of risk are likely to vary widely between tools, however, suggesting that models should be validated and, if necessary, recalibrated in the population to which they will be applied. • Recent development does not mean a nomogram is more accurate for use in a particular population.""","""['David J Tamblyn', 'Samarth Chopra', 'Changhong Yu', 'Michael W Kattan', 'Carole Pinnock', 'Tina Kopsaftis']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Comparative analysis of three risk assessment tools in Australian patients with prostate cancer.', 'Cross-cultural validation of a prognostic tool: example of the Kattan preoperative nomogram as a predictor of prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Validity of the CAPRA score to predict biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy.

Increased sun exposure and blood levels of vitamin D have been postulated to be protective against prostate cancer. This is controversial. We investigated the relationship between prostate cancer incidence and solar radiation in non-urban Australia, and found a lower incidence in regions receiving more sunlight. In landmark ecological studies, prostate cancer mortality rates have been shown to be inversely related to ultraviolet radiation exposure. Investigators have hypothesised that ultraviolet radiation acts by increasing production of vitamin D, which inhibits prostate cancer cells in vitro. However, analyses of serum levels of vitamin D in men with prostate cancer have failed to support this hypothesis. This study has found an inverse correlation between solar radiation and prostate cancer incidence in Australia. Our population (previously unstudied) represents the third group to exhibit this correlation. Significantly, the demographics and climate of Australia differ markedly from those of previous studies conducted on men in the United Kingdom and the United States.  Objective:   • To ascertain if prostate cancer incidence rates correlate with solar radiation among non-urban populations of men in Australia.  Patients and methods:   • Local government areas from each state and territory were selected using explicit criteria. Urban areas were excluded from analysis. • For each local government area, prostate cancer incidence rates and averaged long-term solar radiation were obtained. • The strength of the association between prostate cancer incidence and solar radiation was determined.  Results:   • Among 70 local government areas of Australia, age-standardized prostate cancer incidence rates for the period 1998-2007 correlated inversely with daily solar radiation averaged over the last two decades.

At the time of biopsy, patients should be informed of their heightened PCa risk, particularly African Americans (AA) who have significantly higher diagnostic and mortality risk. We tested predictors of patients' estimation of their likelihood of having PCa at the time of biopsy.  Methods:   A convenience sample of AA (n = 207) and white (n = 271) biopsy patients was surveyed at the time of prostate biopsy. Participants gave likelihood estimations of having PCa and data on their socio-demographics, health, clinical status, and general and PCa-specific anxiety. Binary logistic regressions tested for predictors of the patients' estimations and biopsy results.  Results:   Fifty-one percent of AA men answered that they had a '0%' likelihood of having PCa versus 19% of whites, whereas 57% of AA men had abnormal biopsies compared with 42% of whites. In logistic regressions, predictors of patient answers of 0% chance of PCa were AA ethnicity (OR = 4.50; p < 0.001), lower cancer-specific anxiety (OR = 0.93; p < 0.01), less education (OR = 2.38; p < 0.05), and less urinary disturbance (OR = 0.70; p < .05). In a second regression, AA patients trended towards higher positive biopsy rates (OR = 1.43; p = 0.17).  Conclusions:   At biopsy, AA more often estimated their likelihood of PCa as 0%, despite higher risks.

Silencing this protein using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) has been correlated with tumor growth inhibition and decreases in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA). In our study, we have investigated the ability of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations of small-interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence AR in human prostate tumor cell lines in vitro and in LNCaP xenograft tumors following intravenous (i.v.) injection. In vitro screening studies using a panel of cationic lipids showed that LNPs containing the ionizable cationic lipid 2,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-[1,3]-dioxolane (DLin-KC2-DMA) exhibited the most potent AR silencing effects in LNCaP cells. This is attributed to an optimized ability of DLin-KC2-DMA-containing LNP to be taken up into cells and to release the siRNA into the cell cytoplasm following endocytotic uptake.

This study is undertaken to search for a potential molecular target connected with this process using a model system of androgen-dependent and androgen-unresponsive SC-3 and SC-4 cells.  Methods:   Expression profiles, actin stress fiber organization, and the levels of activated Rho GTPases were compared between SC-4 and SC-3 cells using an oligonucleotide microarray, phalloidin staining, and a Rho activation assay. The cell viability was analyzed with a Rho inhibitor or by stable transfection with either a dominant-negative (DN) form of RhoC or a mutant form of NET1 (mutNET1). The expressions of RhoC, NET1, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were immunohistochemically analyzed in human prostate cancer specimens after short-term endocrine therapy and in an untreated condition.  Results:   SC-4 cells exhibited mesenchymal phenotypes with activation of Rho signals. Treatment with a Rho inhibitor suppressed the cell viability in SC-4 cells, but not in SC-3 cells. The cell viability of SC-4 cells stably expressing DN-RhoC and mutNET1 was also attenuated. In the immunohistochemical analysis, NET1 and the EMT marker of N-cadherin were expressed at higher levels in prostate cancers after short-term endocrine therapy than in untreated tumors, and RhoC expression was maintained after short-term endocrine therapy.  Conclusions:   Rho signaling is involved in the cell survival of SC-4 cells. The higher expressions of RhoC and NET1 in human prostate cancers after short-term endocrine therapy suggest that RhoC and NET1 may become therapeutic targets during endocrine therapy.""","""['Hirotoshi Kawata', 'Naoki Shimada', 'Tomoko Kamiakito', 'Kenji Komatsu', 'Tatsuo Morita', 'Toshio Ota', 'Masaya Obayashi', 'Kenya Shitara', 'Akira Tanaka']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Steroid hormone receptors as targets for the therapy of breast and prostate cancer--recent advances, mechanisms of resistance, and new approaches.', 'RhoC GTPase, a novel transforming oncogene for human mammary epithelial cells that partially recapitulates the inflammatory breast cancer phenotype.', 'Development of an androgen-deprivation induced and androgen suppressed human prostate cancer cell line.', 'Androgen axis in prostate cancer.', 'Role of RhoC in cancer cell migration.', 'Src stimulates Abl-dependent phosphorylation of the guanine exchange factor Net1A to promote its cytosolic localization and cell motility.', 'RhoC: a fascinating journey from a cytoskeletal organizer to a Cancer stem cell therapeutic target.', 'RhoC upregulation is correlated with reduced E-cadherin in human breast cancer specimens after chemotherapy and in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.', 'RhoGEFs in cell motility: novel links between Rgnef and focal adhesion kinase.', 'Induction of reactive oxygen species generation inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes growth arrest in prostate cancer cells.']"""

However, whether common molecular events participate in the activation of these signaling pathways are less understood.  Method:   Hexim 1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry of human tissue microarrays and TRAMP mouse models. The in vivo significance of Hexim-1 was established by crossing the TRAMP mouse model of prostate cancer with Hexim-1 heterozygous mice. TRAMP C2 cell line was also modified to delete one copy of Hexim-1 gene to generate TRAMP-C2-Hexim-1+/- cell lines.  Results:   In this report, we observed that Hexim-1 protein expression is absent in normal prostate but highly expressed in adenocarcinoma of the prostate and a characteristic sub-cellular distribution among normal, benign hyperplasia, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Heterozygosity of the Hexim-1 gene in the prostate cancer mice model and the TRAMP-C2 cell line, leads to increased Cdk9-dependent serine phosphorylation on protein targets such as the androgen receptor (AR) and the TGF-β-dependent downstream transcription factors, such as the SMAD proteins.

Here, we provide evidence that much of this controversy may be explained by variability in antibody sensitivity and specificity and describe the development, characterization, and potential applications of a novel monoclonal antibody targeting full-length human ERβ and its splice variant forms. Specifically, we demonstrate that a number of commercially available ERβ antibodies are insensitive for ERβ and exhibit significant cross-reaction with ERα. However, our newly developed MC10 ERβ antibody is shown to be highly specific and sensitive for detection of full-length ERβ and its variant forms. Strong and variable staining patterns for endogenous levels of ERβ protein were detected in normal human tissues and breast tumors using the MC10 antibody. Importantly, ERβ was shown to be expressed in a limited cohort of both ERα positive and ERα negative breast tumors. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the use of poorly validated ERβ antibodies is likely to explain much of the controversy in the field with regard to the biological relevance of ERβ in breast cancer.

The X and Y chromosomes are responsible for numerous factors that must work in close concert for the proper development of a healthy sexual phenotype. The role of androgens in case of XY chromosomal constitution is crucial for normal male sex differentiation. The intracellular androgenic action is mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), and its impaired function leads to a myriad of syndromes with severe clinical consequences, most notably androgen insensitivity syndrome and prostate cancer. In this paper, we investigated the possibility that an alteration of the equine AR gene explains a recently described familial XY, SRY + disorder of sex development. We uncovered a transition in the first nucleotide of the AR start codon (c.1A>G). To our knowledge, this represents the first causative AR mutation described in domestic animals. It is also a rarely observed mutation in eukaryotes and is unique among the >750 entries of the human androgen receptor mutation database. In addition, we found another quiet missense mutation in exon 1 (c.322C>T). Transcription of AR was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification of several exons. Translation of the full-length AR protein from the initiating GTG start codon was confirmed by Western blot using N- and C-terminal-specific antibodies. Two smaller peptides (25 and 14 amino acids long) were identified from the middle of exon 1 and across exons 5 and 6 by mass spectrometry. Based upon our experimental data and the supporting literature, it appears that the AR is expressed as a full-length protein and in a functional form, and the observed phenotype is the result of reduced AR protein expression levels.""","""['T Révay', 'D A F Villagómez', 'D Brewer', 'T Chenier', 'W A King']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Sex Dev""","""['Missense Mutation in the Ligand-Binding Domain of the Horse Androgen Receptor Gene in a Thoroughbred Family with Inherited 64,XY (SRY+) Disorder of Sex Development.', 'Comparison of the molecular consequences of different mutations at residue 754 and 690 of the androgen receptor (AR) and androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) phenotype.', 'Partial androgen insensitivity caused by an androgen receptor mutation at amino acid 907 (Gly-->Arg) that results in decreased ligand binding affinity and reduced androgen receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels.', 'Identification of a novel mutation in exon 1 of\xa0androgen receptor gene in an azoospermic patient\xa0with mild androgen insensitivity syndrome: case report and literature review.', 'Disorders of sexual development in the domestic horse, Equus caballus.', 'Horse Clinical Cytogenetics: Recurrent Themes and Novel Findings.', 'Impaired Reproductive Function in Equines: From Genetics to Genomics.', 'Characterization of A Homozygous Deletion of Steroid Hormone Biosynthesis Genes in Horse Chromosome 29 as A Risk Factor for Disorders of Sex Development and Reproduction.', 'Androgen Receptor Gene Variants in New Cases of Equine Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.', 'Androgen receptor gene polymorphism in zebra species.']"""

The non-tumourigenic prostate PZHPV-7 cell line was the control.  Results:   Compared with PZHPV-7, cancer cells showed no major variations in EEF1A1 mRNA; eEF1A1 protein increased only in cytoskeletal/nuclear fraction.

Methods:   A total of 263 patients were recruited for this multivariate analysis. After a close follow-up, a series of pre-, peri- and post-operative factors were recorded and analyzed.  Results:   Urinary continence after radical prostatectomy was 14.8% at 4 weeks and 94.7% at 16 weeks. The most important recovery interval for urinary continence was 4 - 16 weeks post-operation.

Anatomical deformations require however replanning, involving an estimation of the cumulative dose, session after session. This is the objective of this study.  Patients and methods:   Two examples of arc-intensity modulated radiotherapy are presented: a case of prostate cancer (total dose=80 Gy) with tomographie conique (daily prostate registration) and one head and neck cancer (70 Gy). For the head and neck cancer, the patient had a weekly scanner allowing a dose distribution calculation. The cumulative dose was calculated per voxel on the planning CT after deformation of the dose distribution (with trilinear interpolation) following the transformation given by a non-rigid registration step (Demons registration method) from: either the tomographie conique (prostate), or the weekly CT. The cumulative dose was eventually compared with the planned dose.  Results:   In cases of prostate irradiation, the ""cumulative"" dose corresponded to the planned dose to the prostate. At the last week of irradiation, it was above the planned dose for the rectum and bladder. The volume of rectal wall receiving more than 50 Gy (V50) was 20% at the planning and 26% at the end of treatment, increasing the risk of rectal toxicity (NTCP) of 14%. For the bladder wall, V50 were 73% and 82%, respectively. In head and neck, the ""cumulative"" dose to the parotid exceeded the planned dose (mean dose increasing from 46 Gy to 54 Gy) from the 5th week of irradiation on, suggesting the need for replanning within the first 5 weeks of radiotherapy.

Prostate cancer is one of the few solid-organ cancers in which imaging is not used in the diagnostic process. Novel functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques offer promise but may not be cost-effective. Prostate HistoScanning(™) (PHS) is an ultrasound-based tissue characterisation technique that has previously shown encouraging results in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. The present study reports on the open 'unblinded' phase of a European multicentre study. The prospective 'blind' phase is currently in progress and will determine the value of PHS in a robust fashion overcoming many of the biases inherent in evaluating prostate imaging.  Objective:   To evaluate the ability of prostate HistoScanning(™) (PHS) an ultrasound (US)-based tissue characterization application, to detect cancer foci by correlating results with detailed radical prostatectomy (RP) histology.  Patient and methods:   In all, 31 patients with organ-confined prostate cancer, diagnosed on transrectal biopsies taken using US guidance, and scheduled for RP were recruited from six European centres. Before RP three-dimensional (3D) US raw data for PHS analysis was obtained. Histology by Bostwick Laboratories (London) examined sections obtained from whole mounted glands cut every 3-4 mm. Location and volume estimation of cancer foci by PHS were undertaken using two methods; a manual method and an embedded software tool. In this report we evaluate data obtained from a planned open study phase. The second phase of the study is 'blinded', and currently in progress.  Results:   31 patients were eligible for this phase. Three patients were excluded from analysis due to inadequate scan acquisition and pathology violations of the standard operating procedure. One patient withdrew from the study after 3D TRUS examination. PHS detected cancer ≥ 0.20 mL in 25/27 prostates (sensitivity 93%). In all, 23 patients had an index focus ≥ 0.5 mL at pathology, of which 21 were identified as ≥ 0.5 mL by PHS using the manual method (sensitivity 91%) and 19 were correctly identified as ≥ 0.5 mL by the embedded tool (sensitivity 83%). In 27 patients, histological analysis found 32 cancerous foci ≥ 0.2 mL, located in 97 of 162 sextants. After sextant analysis, PHS showed a 90% sensitivity and 72% specificity for the localisation of lesions ≥ 0.2 mL within a sextant.  Conclusions:   PHS has the ability to identify and locate prostate cancer and consequently may aid in pre-treatment and pre-surgical planning. In men with a lesion identified, it has potential to enable improved targeting, allowing better risk stratification by obtaining more representative cores.

Erectile dysfunction is a recognized complication of radical prostatectomy. Androgen deprivation therapy adversely impacts sexual function. Our study shows that the preoperative use of androgen deprivation therapy significantly reduces erectile function recovery after radical prostatectomy. The underneath pathophysiological mechanisms for this to occur are reviewed.  Objective:   To define the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), undergone before radical prostatectomy (RP), on erectile function (EF) recovery.  Material and methods:   A total of 38 consecutive patients presenting to a sexual medicine clinic after undergoing RP who had received ADT before RP (ADT+ group) were compared with a contemporary, age and comorbidity-matched cohort of 94 patients who did not receive ADT (ADT- group) before undergoing RP. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, comorbidity profiles and duration of ADT exposure. All the patients underwent Doppler penile ultrasonography within 6 months of RP and were administered the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. All the patients underwent evaluation of EF recovery. We analysed the incidence of venous leak (VL), mean IIEF EF domain score and proportion of men with EF domain scores ≥ 24 at 18 months after RP.  Results:   The mean age, comorbidity profiles, median Gleason score, median pre-treatment PSA level, and mean time to evaluation after RP were similar between the two groups. The median duration of ADT exposure in the ADT+ group was 3 months. The incidence of VL within 6 months of surgery was 60% for the ADT+ and 20% for the ADT- group (P < 0.001). Likewise, the IIEF EF domain scores and proportion of men with EF domain scores ≥ 24 at 18 months were significantly lower in the ADT+ group, even when controlled for nerve-sparing status.

In this study, we investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of Neu3 on cell invasion and migration in vivo and in vitro. Initially, we found that the levels of Neu3 expression were higher in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines than in normal prostate tissues based on RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses. We then applied a Neu3 siRNA approach to block Neu3 signaling using PC-3M cells as model cells. Transwell invasion assays and wound assays showed significantly decreased invasion and migration potential in the Neu3 siRNA-transfected cells. RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses revealed that Neu3 knockdown decreased the expressions of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9. In vivo, mice injected with PC-3M cell tumors were evaluated by SPECT/CT to determine the presence of bone metastases. Mice treated with attenuated Salmonella carrying the Neu3 siRNA developed fewer bone metastases than mice treated with attenuated Salmonella carrying a control Scramble siRNA, attenuated Salmonella alone or PBS. The results for bone metastasis detection by pathology were consistent with the data obtained by SPECT/CT. Tumor blocks were evaluated by histochemical, RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses.

Level of Evidence 2a. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The sequential administration of a GnRH antagonist followed by an LHRH agonist in the management of prostate cancer patients has not been studied, but such a program would provide a more physiologic method of achieving testosterone suppression and avoid the obligatory testosterone surge and need for concomitant antiandrogens that accompany LHRH agonist therapy. The current study which uses abarelix initiation therapy for 12 weeks followed by either leuprolide or goserelin demonstrates the ability to more rapidly achieve testosterone suppression, avoid the obligatory LHRH induced testosterone surge, avoid the necessity of antiandrogens, all of which were accomplished safely, without inducing either additional or novel safety issues.  Objective:   • To demonstrate the safety and endocrinological and biochemical efficacy of initiating treatment with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, abarelix, followed by administration of an luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist in patients with advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   • A multicentre, open-label design study was conducted at 22 centres in the US involving patients with: localized, locally advanced or metastatic disease; with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after definitive local treatment; patients undergoing neoadjuvant hormonal therapy before local therapy (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy or cryosurgery); and patients in whom intermittent therapy was the planned treatment. • All patients received abarelix for 12 weeks followed by an LHRH agonist (either leuprolide or goserelin) for 8 weeks • The primary efficacy endpoint was achievement and maintenance of castration defined as testosterone <50 ng/dL from day 29 through to day 141 and whether abarelix initiation therapy could eliminate the testosterone surge after two consecutive doses of LHRH agonist therapy. • PSA, LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were measured and adverse events were monitored.  Results:   • A total of 176 patients were enrolled into the present study, the majority of whom had localized prostate cancer (82%) and a PSA level <10 ng/mL (62%). • At the end of the abarelix treatment period (day 85), 93.8% of patients achieved castrate levels; during the first week of switch over to the LHRH agonist therapy (days 85-92) the rate was 86.5% and during the week after the second LHRH agonist injection (days 114-12) it was 93.3%. • A small, transient increase in testosterone occurred during the first injection of the LHRH agonist; mean (standard deviation [sd]) values increased from 17 (17.8) ng/dL at day 85 to 37.3 (51.07) ng/dL at day 86. • Mean (sd) PSA levels decreased from 20.5 (56.6) ng/mL at baseline to 3.7 (23.5) ng/mL on day 85 and remained stable throughout the LHRH agonist treatment phase. • Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 84% of patients overall; a similar incidence was reported during the two treatment phases.  Conclusions:   • Abarelix initiation therapy results in the desired effect of achieving rapid testosterone suppression; testosterone surges after subsequent LHRH agonist therapy are greatly abrogated or completely eliminated. • This treatment paradigm (abarelix initiation followed by agonist maintenance) obviates the need for an antiandrogen. • Abarelix was well tolerated and no clinically meaningful or novel adverse events were observed during abarelix treatment or in the transition to LHRH agonist maintenance therapy.""","""['Marc B Garnick', 'Nicolas Mottet']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist abarelix depot versus luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists leuprolide or goserelin: initial results of endocrinological and biochemical efficacies in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Incomplete testosterone suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists: does it happen and does it matter?', 'The efficacy and safety of degarelix: a 12-month, comparative, randomized, open-label, parallel-group phase III study in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Abarelix and other gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists in prostate cancer.', 'Abarelix for injectable suspension: first-in-class gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist for prostate cancer.', 'In vivo degradation forms, anti-degradation strategies, and clinical applications of therapeutic peptides in non-infectious chronic diseases.', 'Targeting signaling pathways in prostate cancer: mechanisms and clinical trials.', 'Definition of Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer: New Insights.', 'Serum Luteinizing Hormone Testing Can Identify Optimal Medical Castration.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy and side effects: are GnRH antagonists safer?']"""

Level of Evidence 4. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Low-risk prostate cancer is frequently diagnosed in the context of PSA screening or during a routine check-up. For those patients, to avoid possible overtreatment AS is an increasingly chosen treatment option. However, the concept of AS could possibly misclassify potentially dangerous PCa as a low-risk disease resulting in inferior cancer control outcomes. In the present study, we could demonstrate that the histopathological results of patients treated by RP in course of AS are significantly better if the selection criteria for AS are entirely fulfilled. Our findings underline the importance of a strict and precise admittance procedure for patients with early prostate cancer who are willing to undergo an AS programme.  Objective:   • To compare the histopathological outcomes of patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) after an initial active surveillance (AS) for localized, low-risk prostate cancers (PCa) among men who fulfilled the Epstein criteria at diagnosis with those who did not.  Patients and methods:   • In all, 283 patients with localized PCa were initially managed at our institution with AS. • In all, ≈ 50% originated from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) participants from Switzerland: 75 (26.5%) patients underwent treatment during follow-up and 61 were treated with RP (21.6%). • These patients were stratified into those who did (n= 39) vs those who did not (n= 22) entirely fulfil AS inclusion criteria according to Epstein et al. at PCa diagnosis.  Results:   • Patients who did completely fulfil the AS inclusion criteria had significantly lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-values (4.9 vs 7.8 ng/mL; P= 0.02), a significantly lower PSA density at diagnosis (0.09 vs 0.2 ng/mL/ccm; P= 0.007) and at RP, a higher proportion of organ-confined cancers (89.7% vs 59.1%, P= 0.02) and fewer positive surgical margins (25.6% vs 40.9%). • However, the rate of favourable histopathological outcome, defined as organ-confined disease with negative surgical margins, was statistically significantly higher in the group fulfilling AS criteria (69.2% vs 40.9%; P= 0.03).  Conclusions:   • In our AS series, 26.5% of the patients underwent definitive therapy. • Most patients treated with RP had organ-confined disease in the majority of cases, especially when the Epstein criteria were rigorously fulfilled at PCa diagnosis. • This underlines the importance of a strict and precise per protocol AS for patients with early PCa, otherwise there is a risk of missing more significant disease.""","""['Daniel Seiler', 'Marco Randazzo', 'Laurence Klotz', 'Rainer Grobholz', 'Martin Baumgartner', 'Hendrik Isbarn', 'Franz Recker', 'Maciej Kwiatkowski']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Outcomes of initially expectantly managed patients with low or intermediate risk screen-detected localized prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy improves progression-free and cancer-specific survival in men with lymph node positive prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era: a confirmatory study.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Debulking surgery in the setting of very high-risk prostate cancer scenarios.', 'A contemporary update on pathology reporting for prostate cancer: biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Adverse Pathological Findings at Radical Prostatectomy following Active Surveillance: Results from the Movember GAP3 Cohort.', 'Active surveillance for the management of localized prostate cancer: Guideline recommendations.', 'Surveillance biopsy and active treatment during active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: can multiparametric MR imaging help identify patients who are candidates for active surveillance?', 'Many young men with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screen-detected prostate cancers may be candidates for active surveillance.']"""

Level of Evidence 2b. What's known on the subject? And what does the study add? Previous studies have attempted to characterize the normal biological variability in PSA among men without prostate cancer. These reports suggest that PSA variability is unrelated to age, but there are conflicting data on its association with the baseline PSA level. There are limited published data regarding the effects of prostate volume on PSA variability. A prior study assessing whether prostate volume changes would confound the use of PSA velocity in clinical practice reported that prostate volume changes were not significantly related to PSA changes. This study did not directly address the effect of baseline prostate volume on serial PSA variability. The objective of the current study was to further examine the relationship between prostate volume and PSA variability. Our hypothesis was that larger baseline prostate volume would be associated with increased PSA variability in men without known prostate cancer and in those with suspected small-volume disease. The results of the study suggest that baseline PSA, not prostate volume, is the primary driver of PSA variability in these populations.  Objective:   • To clarify the relationship between serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) variability and prostate volume in both cancer-free participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and patients with low-risk prostate cancer from the Johns Hopkins Active Surveillance Program (AS).  Materials and methods:   • In all, 287 men from the BLSA and 131 patients from the AS were included in the analysis, all with at least two PSA measurements and concurrent prostate volume measurements. • PSA variability was calculated in ng/mL per year, and a linear mixed-effects model was used to determine the relative effects of prostate volume, baseline PSA and age on PSA change over time.  Results:   • In a model with prostate volume, age and baseline PSA, there was no significant relationship between prostate volume and PSA variability (BLSA, P= 0.57; AS, P= 0.49). • Only baseline PSA showed a significant relationship to PSA yearly variability (PSAYV) (P < 0.001). Specifically, a one unit higher baseline PSA (ng/mL) corresponded on average to 0.09 and 0.06 ng/mL per year higher PSAYV in the BLSA and AS populations, respectively.  Conclusions:   • The results of the present study suggest that the primary driver of PSA variability is the baseline PSA level, rather than prostate volume. • Clinicians might consider the baseline PSA level to help predict the expected variability in serial PSA measurements.""","""['John H Nichols', 'Stacy Loeb', 'E Jeffrey Metter', 'Luigi Ferrucci', 'H Ballentine Carter']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Low levels of prostate-specific antigen predict long-term risk of prostate cancer: results from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.', 'Comprehensive analysis of post-diagnostic prostate-specific antigen kinetics as predictor of a prostate cancer progression in active surveillance patients.', 'Effect of intra-observer variation in prostate volume measurement on prostate-specific antigen density calculations among prostate cancer active surveillance participants.', 'Natural history of changes in prostate specific antigen in early stage prostate cancer.', 'Additional aids in detection of prostate carcinomas?

Preclinical studies suggest that osteoclast inhibition might prevent bone metastases. We assessed denosumab, a fully human anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody, for prevention of bone metastasis or death in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study, men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer at high risk of bone metastasis (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≥8·0 μg/L or PSA doubling time ≤10·0 months, or both) were enrolled at 319 centres from 30 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg or subcutaneous placebo every 4 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by PSA eligibility criteria and previous or ongoing chemotherapy for prostate cancer. Patients, investigators, and all people involved in study conduct were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was bone-metastasis-free survival, a composite endpoint determined by time to first occurrence of bone metastasis (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or death from any cause. Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat. The masked treatment phase of the trial has been completed. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00286091.  Findings:   1432 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (716 denosumab, 716 placebo). Denosumab significantly increased bone-metastasis-free survival by a median of 4·2 months compared with placebo (median 29·5 [95% CI 25·4-33·3] vs 25·2 [22·2-29·5] months; hazard ratio [HR] 0·85, 95% CI 0·73-0·98, p=0·028). Denosumab also significantly delayed time to first bone metastasis (33·2 [95% CI 29·5-38·0] vs 29·5 [22·4-33·1] months; HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·71-0·98, p=0·032). Overall survival did not differ between groups (denosumab, 43·9 [95% CI 40·1-not estimable] months vs placebo, 44·8 [40·1-not estimable] months; HR 1·01, 95% CI 0·85-1·20, p=0·91). Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in both groups, except for osteonecrosis of the jaw and hypocalcaemia. 33 (5%) patients on denosumab developed osteonecrosis of the jaw versus none on placebo. Hypocalcaemia occurred in 12 (2%) patients on denosumab and two (<1%) on placebo.

They suggested that PSA mass ratio may be representative of a PSA value adjusted for potentially influencing factors, such as haemodilution and prostate volume. By adjusting for the combined effects of plasma volume and prostate volume, it can be hypothesized that PSA mass ratio would enhance the predictive value of the PSA test.

Results:   When compared one-on-one, PSA mass ratio had a significantly higher accuracy than PSA in the prediction of prostate cancer among our subjects (0.638 vs 0.565, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, when multivariable model for the prediction of prostate cancer detection via prostate biopsy was devised incorporating patient age, body mass index, digital rectal examination findings, PV, number of biopsy cores, and PSA level, the replacement of PSA level with PSA mass ratio (P = 0.102) or the addition of PSA mass ratio (P = 0.164) in the model was not associated with significantly increased accuracy of model for predicting prostate cancer detection via biopsy.

Focal therapy includes a variety of therapeutic approaches ranging from lesion treatment to sub-total gland treatment. In this context, an accurate selection of patients having unilateral prostate cancer is closely related to the success of these strategies, especially when a hemi-ablative approach is considered. As prostate cancer is often multifocal, the critical issue is whether it is possible to preoperatively predict a clinically significant unifocal and/or unilateral lesion with sufficient accuracy to recommend focal or hemi-ablative therapy, relying on clinical characteristics and pathological data derived from the biopsy. Our study clearly demonstrates that the prediction of unilateral prostate cancer is not accurate, based on preoperative variables (predictive accuracy 52.3%). Our study is the first study based on an extended biopsy template. Even in patients diagnosed with extended biopsy, the accuracy of the available predictors is far from the ideal prediction. To date, there is no way of correctly identifying patients who will harbour unilateral prostate cancer based on routinely available variables.  Objective:   o establish the predictors of unilateral prostate cancer in a population of patients with low risk prostate cancer, diagnosed with extended biopsy and submitted to radical prostatectomy, potentially candidates for focal therapy.  Patients and methods:   The study included 321 consecutive patients with low risk (clinical stage T1, Gleason score 3 + 3 or less, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] < 10 ng/mL) unilateral prostate cancer diagnosed after extended biopsy who were subsequently treated with radical prostatectomy between 2002 and 2009 at a single institution. We evaluated the rate of unilateral prostate cancers at final pathology following radical prostatectomy, defined as pT2a or pT2b stage. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of unilateral prostate cancers. Predictive accuracy was assessed with estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which were subjected to 200 bootstraps to reduce overfit bias.  Results:   At final pathology only 29.3% patients harboured unilateral prostate cancer. No significant differences in terms of age, preoperative PSA, prostate volume and percentage of positive cores were recorded between patients with unilateral prostate cancer and patients with more advanced stage (all P ≥ 0.07). Patients harbouring unilateral prostate cancer had a smaller number of positive biopsy cores (2.8 vs 3.2, P = 0.056) compared with patients with stage pT2c or higher at final pathology. Patients with unilateral prostate cancer had a higher rate of Gleason sum 6 compared with patients with more advanced pathological stage (pT2c or higher: 85.1% vs 65.6%; P = 0.002). On multivariable analyses, only the percentage of positive cores (odds ratio 0.57; P = 0.047) was an independent predictor of unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy, after controlling for age, PSA at diagnosis and prostate volume (all P ≥ 0.3). The newly developed model for identifying the presence of unilateral prostate cancer failed to achieve accurate prediction (area under the curve 52.3%). When only patients with a single positive core were considered, no differences in PSA and prostate volume were detected (all P ≥ 0.5) and a similar rate of unilateral prostate cancer was demonstrated (33.3% vs 28.4%; P = 0.5).  Conclusions:   In patients with unilateral low risk prostate cancer at biopsy, only one-third showed unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy. The number of cores and the number of positive cores represented independent predictors of unilateral prostate cancer. However, the accuracy of the multivariable model in predicting unilateral prostate cancer is low (52.3%), thus making prediction of unilateral prostate cancer extremely inaccurate.

It has also been shown that most of these tumours are located anteriorly in the prostate gland. The present study showed a high rate of prostate cancer in patients with previous negative transrectal biopsies but elevated PSA levels, and that the cancers were located anteriorly in the prostate gland. Also, most of these cancers were clinically significant in patients that underwent RP, i.e. a high proportion of cancers were high-grade/high-stage tumours. We also showed that the transperineal biopsy technique can be applied successfully to patients with a closed anal orifice after previous surgery for rectal cancer. Transperineal biopsy can be done safely without routine antibiotic prophylaxis.  Objective:   To investigate the outcomes of transperineal prostate biopsies in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and negative transrectal biopsies. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic yield of the transperineal biopsy approach in these patients, and to evaluate the pathology findings in subsequent radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens in patients undergoing RP.  Patients and methods:   In all, 69 consecutive patients with previous negative transrectal biopsies but elevated PSA levels investigated at urological units in Norway who had been referred to The Norwegian Radium Hospital were included. The patients had undergone a mean (median; range) of 2.42 (2; 0-7) transrectal biopsies. The mean (range) age was 63.1 (42-78) years. The median (range) PSA level was 12 (4.3-229) ng/mL. The patients were examined with transperineal biopsy of the prostate between July 2007 and February 2009. The results of the transperineal biopsies were reviewed for Gleason biopsy score, and these were compared with the histopathology results of the RP specimens, i.e. final Gleason scores. Pathological stage of the prostate specimens and tumour volume were also reviewed.  Results:   Prostate cancer was found in the biopsies of 38 of 69 patients (55%). In all, 20 of 38 patients had a Gleason score estimated at ≥3 + 4 = 7. In all, 26 patients underwent RP. The surgical specimens revealed pathological stage pT2c in 65%, pT3a in 27% and pT3b in 8% of the cases. In all, 23 of the 26 RP specimens showed a final Gleason score of ≥7. The vast majority of cancers detected were situated in the anterior/ventral portion of the prostate.  Conclusions:   Transperineal biopsy of the prostate in patients with an elevated PSA level after negative transrectal prostate biopsies appears to be a feasible and important option for further investigation to detect prostate cancer. The present study shows that the transperineal biopsy allows good access of the anterior/ventral part of the prostate.

Extensive research within the last decade has revealed that RANKL, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, plays a major role in cancer-associated bone resorption and thus is a therapeutic target. We investigated the potential of vitamin K3 analogue plumbagin (derived from Chitrak, an Ayurvedic medicinal plant) to modulate RANKL signaling, osteoclastogenesis, and breast cancer-induced osteolysis. Plumbagin suppressed RANKL-induced NF-κB activation in mouse monocytes, an osteoclast precursor cell, through sequential inhibition of activation of IκBα kinase, IκBα phosphorylation, and IκBα degradation. Plumbagin also suppressed differentiation of these cells into osteoclasts induced either by RANKL or by human breast cancer or human multiple myeloma cells. When examined for its ability to prevent human breast cancer-induced bone loss in animals, plumbagin (2 mg/kg body weight) administered via the intraperitoneal route significantly decreased osteolytic lesions, resulting in preservation of bone volume in nude mice bearing human breast tumors. Overall, our results indicate that plumbagin, a vitamin K analogue, is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis induced by tumor cells and of breast cancer-induced osteolytic metastasis through suppression of RANKL signaling.""","""['Bokyung Sung', 'Babatunde Oyajobi', 'Bharat B Aggarwal']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Plumbagin inhibits breast tumor bone metastasis and osteolysis by modulating the tumor-bone microenvironment.', 'Simvastatin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand through modulation of NF-kappaB pathway.', 'Embelin suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand and tumor cells in vitro through inhibition of the NF-κB cell signaling pathway.', 'Roles of the RANKL-RANK Axis in Immunity-Implications for Pathogenesis and Treatment of Bone Metastasis.', 'NF-κB signaling and bone resorption.', 'Functional Genomic Analysis of Breast Cancer Metastasis: Implications for Diagnosis and Therapy.', 'Plumbagin, a Biomolecule with (Anti)Osteoclastic Properties.', 'Plumbagin inhibits the proliferation and survival of esophageal cancer cells by blocking STAT3-PLK1-AKT signaling.', 'Plumbagin sensitizes breast cancer cells to tamoxifen-induced cell death through GRP78 inhibition and Bik upregulation.', 'Plant-derived anticancer agents: a promising treatment for bone metastasis.']"""

This prospective study compared the quality of life after surgery of patients treated with two different surgical methods (perineal RP, RPP; retropubic RP, RRP). The aim of this study was to compare perineal and retropubic RP with regard to stool behaviour and local pain symptoms.  Patients and methods:   257 radical prostatectomies (169 RPP, 88 RRP) were performed between July 2003 and December 2004. 208 (151 RPP, 57 RRP) prospectively evaluated patients replied to a physician-independent validated questionnaire (QLQ-C30 with prostate modul, IIEF 75, stool behaviour) followed by a phone survey regarding the continence of all 257 patients.  Results:   One year after surgery, the complete continence rate (no pads) was 75 % for the RPP group and 61 % for the RRP group. 22 % of the patients reported involuntary stool leakage in the RPP group and 19 % in the RRP group (not significantly different). 29 % of the patients in the RPP group complained of local pain after 12 months, one third of them while sitting. In the RRP group, 28 % of the patients complained of local pain after 12 months, 15 % of them while sitting.17 % in the RPP and 27 % in the RRP group who suffered of stool leakage had these symptoms preoperatively. One year after surgery, 52 % of preoperatively potent patients were still potent after nerve-sparing RPP and 40 % were potent after nerve-sparing RRP. 78 % of patients in the RPP group and 67 % in the RRP group had an overall satisfactory quality of life.  Conclusion:   The application of different surgical methods did not differ with regard to postoperative local pain, stool behaviour, or general health items of quality of life.

While exploring potential disease mechanisms, we found that XMRV infection induced apoptosis in SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, suggesting a mechanism for the neuromuscular pathology seen in CFS. Several lines of evidence show that the cell entry receptor for XMRV, Xpr1, mediates this effect, and chemical cross-linking studies show that Xpr1 is associated with the Gβ subunit of the G-protein heterotrimer. The activation of adenylate cyclase rescued the cells from XMRV toxicity, indicating that toxicity resulted from reduced G-protein-mediated cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling. Some proteins with similarity to Xpr1 are involved in phosphate uptake into cells, but we found no role of Xpr1 in phosphate uptake or its regulation. Our results indicate that Xpr1 is a novel, atypical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and that xenotropic or polytropic retrovirus binding can disrupt the cAMP-mediated signaling function of Xpr1, leading to the apoptosis of infected cells. We show that this pathway is also responsible for the classic toxicity of the polytropic mink cell focus-forming (MCF) retrovirus in mink cells. Although it now seems clear that the detection of XMRV in humans was the result of sample contamination with a recombinant mouse virus, our findings may have relevance to neurologic disease induced by MCF retroviruses in mice.""","""['Andrew E Vaughan', 'Ramon Mendoza', 'Ramona Aranda', 'Jean-Luc Battini', 'A Dusty Miller']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['Six host range variants of the xenotropic/polytropic gammaretroviruses define determinants for entry in the XPR1 cell surface receptor.', 'Evolution of functional and sequence variants of the mammalian XPR1 receptor for mouse xenotropic gammaretroviruses and the human-derived retrovirus XMRV.', 'The prostate cancer-associated human retrovirus XMRV lacks direct transforming activity but can induce low rates of transformation in cultured cells.', 'The mouse ""xenotropic"" gammaretroviruses and their XPR1 receptor.', 'Lack of evidence for a role of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and/or chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'PHOSPHATE exporter XPR1/SLC53A1 is required for the tumorigenicity of epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Clinical implication of xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'Interplay between primary familial brain calcification-associated SLC20A2 and XPR1 phosphate transporters requires inositol polyphosphates for control of cellular phosphate homeostasis.', 'Identification of the Genetic Requirements for Zinc Tolerance and Toxicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.', 'Xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 (XPR1) promotes progression of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) via activation of NF-κB signaling.']"""

Data from the interviews were subjected to content thematic analysis and development of categories based on psychodynamic references.  Results:   Three themes were identified: (1) sexuality called into question; (2) a body without governance; and (3) experiencing loss. These men reported difficulties in dealing both with the physical and emotional impotence resulting from the treatment. Urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction affected their body by accentuating conflicts related to masculinity, triggering subjective feelings of powerlessness, and psychological distress.  Conclusion:   Study respondents assigned multiple psychological meanings to issues related to feelings of powerlessness in general, leading to a narcissistic wound.

This study was aimed at exploring the use of serum glyoxalase as a supplemental biomarker to differentiate between malignant vs non-malignant diseases of the prostate in patients with PSA in the range of 4-20 ng/ml.  Methods:   Serum glyoxalase and PSA were measured in 92 men (30 control, 31 cases of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and 31 cases of adenocarcinoma of prostate). Of the latter group, 11 cases of prostate cancer in the PSA range of 4-20 ng/ml were included for studying the diagnostic utility of combination of both serum PSA and glyoxalase.  Results:   In prostate cancer cases with PSA in the range of 4-20 ng/ml, the glyoxalase was found to be 233.3 ± 98.6 μmol/min while for the non-malignant group it was 103.1 ± 19.7 μmol/min. A cut-off of 19.2 ng/ml PSA showed sensitivity of 9 per cent, specificity of 96.7 per cent, positive predictive value (PPV) of 50 per cent and negative predictive value (NPV) of 75 per cent. A serum glyoxalase cut-off of 141 μmol/min showed sensitivity of 81.8 per cent, specificity of 100 per cent, PPV of 100 per cent and NPV of 93.9 per cent. Further, ROC analysis showed a significant difference in the area under curve (AUC) for glyoxalase as compared to serum PSA (0.92 vs 0.57; P<0.001).

However, 24.8% of males negative in all examinations were biopsypositive. Thus, these examinations were considered to be inappropriate for secondary screening. In evaluation 2, the prostate was divided into 4 regions, and the findings from specimens following total prostatectomy were compared with MRI findings in each region. For the region containing prostate cancer, MRI showed a sensitivity of 26.0%, specificity of 98.3%, positive predictive value of 96.2%, and negative predictive value of 44. 4%. In patients with a Gleason score ≥7, cancer foci were more frequently detectable using MRI. MRI prior to prostate biopsy in patients in the PSA gray zone is inappropriate for secondary screening due to its low sensitivity. However, by virtue of its high positive predictive value, MRI is useful for determining patients indicated for biopsy, as well as DRE and TRUS. Accurate evaluation of the localization of all cancer lesions is difficult using MRI. However, when MRI findings are present, they frequently indicate the cancer lesion, which may be useful information for treatment.""","""['Yuma Sakura', 'Mutsuki Mishina', 'Kimihiko Masui', 'Norihiko Masuda', 'Takuma Katoh', 'Haruki Ito', 'Toru Yoshida', 'Takahito Soma', 'Toshiki Dodo', 'Satoshi Nakajima', 'Tsuyoshi Ito', 'Hiroshi Okuno']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Hinyokika Kiyo""","""['Localising prostate cancer: comparison of endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and 3D-MR spectroscopic imaging with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy.', 'Value of endorectal MRI and MRS in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and previous negative biopsies to localize peripheral zone tumours.', 'The value of free and total prostate specific antigen in identifying patients for prostatic biopsy and its relationship to Gleason score and number of positive cores.', 'Prospective evaluation of prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density in the detection of nonpalpable and stage T1C carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Diagnostic imaging of the prostate cancer.']"""

It is advantageous over conventional IMRT in terms of treatment delivery time. This study investigates the relation between the number of segments and plan quality in VMAT optimization for a single modulated arc. Five prostate, five lung, and five head-and-neck (HN) patient plans were studied retrospectively. For each case, four VMAT plans were generated. The plans differed only in the number of control points used in the optimization process. The control points were spaced 2°, 3°, 4°, and 6° apart, respectively. All of the optimization parameters were the same among the four schemes. The 2° spacing plan was used as a reference to which the other three plans were compared. The plan quality was assessed by comparison of dose indices (DIs) and generalized equivalent uniform doses (gEUDs) for targets and critical structures. All optimization schemes generated clinically acceptable plans. The differences between the majority of reference and compared DIs and gEUDs were within 3%. DIs and gEUDs which differed in excess of 3% corresponded to dose levels well below the organ tolerances. The DI and the gEUD differences increased with an increase in plan complexity from prostates to HNs. Optimization with gantry spacing resolution of 4° seems to be a very balanced alternative between plan quality and plan complexity.""","""['Ivaylo B Mihaylov', 'Bruce Curran', 'Edward Sternick']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Validation of the relative insensitivity of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan quality to gantry space resolution.', 'Multicriteria optimization informed VMAT planning.', 'Biological optimization in volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma.', 'A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Impact of gantry rotation time on plan quality and dosimetric verification--volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) vs. intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).', 'Evaluation of complexity and deliverability of prostate cancer treatment plans designed with a knowledge-based VMAT planning technique.', 'Assessment of Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy for Constant and Variable Dose Rates.', 'Validation of the relative insensitivity of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan quality to gantry space resolution.', 'Influence of increment of gantry angle and number of arcs on esophageal volumetric modulated arc therapy planning in Monaco planning system: A planning study.']"""

Three different plans for each of twenty patients were generated using either 6 MV or 15 MV alone, and both 6 and 15 MV beams. All the planning parameters, goals, and constraints were set to be identical except beam energy. The dose distributions were similar in terms of target coverage, conformity, and homogeneity regardless of beam energy. The V(70Gy) of rectal wall in 6 MV, 15 MV and mixed-energy plans was 16.7%, 17.9%, and 16.3%, respectively, while V(40Gy) was 55.6%, 53.2%, and 50%. The mean dose to femoral heads in 6 MV, 15 MV, and mixed-energy plans were 31.7 Gy, 26.3 Gy, and 26.2 Gy, respectively. The integral dose of 6 MV plans was 7% larger than those of 15 MV or mixed-energy plans. These results indicated that mixed-energy IMRT plans could take advantage of the dosimetric characteristics of low- and high-energy beams.

Registration of planning CT (PCT) and daily CBCT are the key issues in this process. In our work, a new multiscale deformable registration method is proposed by combining edge-preserving scale space with the multilevel free-form deformation (FFD) grids for CBCT-based AIGRT system. The edge-preserving scale space, which is able to select edges and contours of images according to their geometric size, is derived from the total variation model with the L1 norm (TV-L1). At each scale, despite the noise and contrast resolution differences between the PCT and CBCT, the selected edges and contours are sufficiently strong to drive the deformation using the FFD grid, and the edge-preserving property ensures more meaningful spatial information for mutual information (MI)-based registration. At last, the deformation fields are gained by a coarse to fine manner. Furthermore, in consideration of clinical application we designed an optimal estimation of the TV-L1 parameters by minimizing the defined offset function for automated registration. Six types of patients are studied in our work, including rectum, prostate, lung, H&N (head and neck), breast, and chest cancer patients. The experiment results demonstrate the significance of the proposed method both quantitatively with ground truth known and qualitatively with ground truth unknown. The applications for AIGRT, including adaptive deformable recontouring and redosing, and DVH (dose volume histogram) analysis in the course of radiation therapy are also studied.""","""['Dengwang Li', 'Hongjun Wang', 'Yong Yin', 'Xiuying Wang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Quantitative evaluation of a cone-beam computed tomography-planning computed tomography deformable image registration method for adaptive radiation therapy.', 'A 3D global-to-local deformable mesh model based registration and anatomy-constrained segmentation method for image guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Multiscale registration of medical images based on edge preserving scale space with application in image-guided radiation therapy.', 'Assessing the impact of choosing different deformable registration algorithms on cone-beam CT enhancement by histogram matching.', 'Online Adaptive Radiation Therapy.', 'Effect of different thresholds on the accuracy of linear and volumetric analysis of native- and grafted-bone.', 'Parotid gland radiation dose-xerostomia relationships based on actual delivered dose for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Investigation of dosimetric variations of liver radiotherapy using deformable registration of planning CT and cone-beam CT.']"""

The present study examined the relative risk of cancer in a nationwide cohort.  Methods:   The primary data source was the National Health Insurance database of Taiwan. Data recorded between 2000 and 2008 for subjects ≥20 years and with no history of malignancy were included for the analysis. A gout case definition was defined by records of gout diagnosis and anti-gout treatment (urate-lowering drugs, including allopurinol, benzbromazone, probenacid and sulfinpyrazone, and colchicine). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between gout and cancer.  Results:   A total of 694,361 patients (355,278 men, 339,083 women) were included; among them, 25,943 had a history of gout. Mean age (±standard deviation) was 42.3±16.3 years. During 5,471,272 patient-years of follow-up, cancer was detected in 24,088 patients (1745 with gout and 22,343 controls). The most cancers were liver, lung, and colonic cancers. The overall incidence of cancer was significantly higher among gout patients than controls (8.7 vs. 4.2 cases per 1000 patient-years, P<0.001). After adjustment for age and sex, gout was found to be associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.21; P<0.001) for cancer. Gout was most closely associated with prostate cancer, with an age- and sex-adjusted HR of 1.71 (1.45-2.02). On the other hand, gout tended to have an inverse, albeit insignificant, association with breast cancer (adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63-1.04).

Materials and methods:   Our cohort included 284 patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer, defined as clinical stage T2b/T2c, Gleason score 7 and/or prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml, and 1-year minimum followup. Treatment was 2 high dose rate brachytherapy sessions at 3 fractions of 6.5 Gy each for a mean of 19 days. Prostate specific antigen failure was defined as nadir +2 ng/ml.  Results:   Mean followup was 35.1 months (median 31.9). Actuarial 5-year cause specific survival and clinical local control were 100%, distant-metastasis-free survival 98.8% and biochemical disease-free survival 94.4%. Clinical stage predicted biochemical disease-free survival. For stage T2a or less 5-year biochemical disease-free survival was 95.1% vs 100% for stage T2b and 77.4% for T2c (p = 0.012). Percent positive biopsy cores and prostate specific antigen nadir were also predictive. International Prostate Symptom Score results remained stable and potency was maintained in 82.6% of patients at 2 years. Pads were used for the first time after brachytherapy in 22 patients (7.7%), mostly for grade 1 incontinence (occasionally or less per week). Excluding patients with prior transurethral prostatectomy, stroke or tremor 2.5% used pads for the first time after treatment. No patient had urethral stricture. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1 rectal toxicity developed in 12 patients (4.2%) but not beyond grade 1.  Conclusions:   High dose rate brachytherapy as monotherapy is safe and effective for patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer.

We determined the population level prevalence and correlates of appropriate and inappropriate imaging in this cohort.  Materials and methods:   We performed a cross-sectional study of men 66 to 85 years old who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2004 and 2005 from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare database. Low risk (no prostate specific antigen greater than 10 ng/ml, Gleason score greater than 7 or clinical stage greater than T2) and high risk (1 or more of those features) groups were formed. Inappropriate imaging was defined as any imaging for men at low risk and appropriate imaging was defined as bone scan for men at high risk as well as pelvic imaging as appropriate. Logistic regression modeled imaging in each group.  Results:   Of 18,491 men at low risk 45% received inappropriate imaging while only 66% of 10,562 at high risk received appropriate imaging. For patients at low risk inappropriate imaging was associated with increasing clinical stage (T2 vs T1 OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.27-1.44), higher Gleason score (7 vs less than 7 OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.69-1.92), increasing age and comorbidity as well as decreasing education. Appropriate imaging for men at high risk was associated with lower stage (T4, T3 and T2 vs T1 OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48-0.82, OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.60-0.80 and OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.86) and with higher Gleason score (greater than 8 and 7 vs less than 7 OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.92-2.48 and 1.51, 95% CI 1.35-1.70, respectively) as well as with younger age, white race, higher income, lower stage and more comorbidity.

For patients with prostate cancer the goal is to provide evaluations by urologists, medical and radiation oncologists at a single visit. Although additional resources are required, this strategy may enhance the overall health care experience. We compared utilization determinants between a multidisciplinary and a urology prostate cancer clinic at Duke University Medical Center and identified factors associated with pursuing treatment at the university medical center for multidisciplinary clinic patients.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data on patients referred for primary prostate cancer treatment evaluation at Duke University Medical Center from 2005 to 2009. Comparisons between 701 multidisciplinary clinic and 1,318 urology prostate cancer clinic patients were examined with the rank sum and chi-square tests. Predictive factors for pursuing treatment at the university medical center were assessed using multivariate adjusted logistic regression.  Results:   Compared to patients at the urology prostate cancer clinic those at the multidisciplinary clinic were more likely to be younger and white, have a higher income and travel a longer distance for evaluation. Of multidisciplinary clinic patients 58% pursued primary treatment at the university medical center. They were more likely to be younger, black and physician referred, have a lower income and reside closer to the medical center. Factors predictive of pursuing treatment at the medical center included high risk disease and physician referral. Factors predictive of not receiving care at the university medical center were income greater than $40,000 and a distance traveled of greater than 100 miles.

Here we report the use of the c-Myc adenocarcinoma cell line from the c-Myc transgenic mouse with prostate cancer to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity of the combination of the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat with the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus. Panobinostat/everolimus combination treatment resulted in significantly greater antitumor activity in mice bearing androgen sensitive Myc-CaP and castrate resistant Myc-CaP tumors compared to single treatments. We identified that panobinostat/everolimus combination resulted in enhanced anti-tumor activity mediated by decreased tumor growth concurrent with augmentation of p21 and p27 expression and the attenuation of angiogenesis and tumor proliferation via androgen receptor, c-Myc and HIF-1α signaling. Also, we observed altered expression of microRNAs associated with these three transcription factors. Overall, our results demonstrate that low dose concurrent panobinostat/everolimus combination therapy is well tolerated and results in greater anti-tumor activity compared to single treatments in tumor bearing immuno-competent mice.

We used ovalbumin, and a hapten-protein conjugate, phthalate-keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The evaluation of SIS was conducted in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice using both intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes. Inflammatory responses were studied by microarray profiling of chemokines and cytokines and by qPCR of inflammasomes-related genes. Results showed that SIS affected cytokine and chemokines microenvironments such as up-regulation of IL-4 and CD30-ligand and activation of chemotactic factors LIX and KC (neutrophil chemotactic factors), MCP-1 (monocytes chemotactic factors), MIP 1-α (macrophage chemotactic factor) and lymphotactin, as well as, growth factors like M-CSF. SIS also promoted gene expression of Nod-like receptors (NLR) and associated downstream effectors. However, in contrast to alum, SIS had no effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) or NLRP3, but it appeared to promote both Th1 and Th2 responses under different conditions.

The CB1 and its endogenous and synthetic agonists are emerging as therapeutic targets in several cancers due to their ability to suppress carcinoma cell invasion and migration. However, the mechanisms that the CB1 regulates cell motility are not well understood. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms that diminish cell migration upon the CB1 activation in prostate carcinoma cells. The CB1 activation with the agonist WIN55212 significantly diminishes the small GTPase RhoA activity but modestly increases the Rac1 and Cdc42 activity. The diminished RhoA activity is accompanied by the loss of actin/myosin microfilaments, cell spreading, and cell migration. Interestingly, the CB1 inactivation with the selective CB1 antagonist AM251 significantly increases RhoA activity, enhances microfilament formation and cell spreading, and promotes cell migration. This finding suggests that endogenously produced EC activate the CB1, resulting in chronic repression of RhoA activity and cell migration. Consistent with this possibility, RhoA activity is significantly diminished by the exogenous application of AEA but not by 2-AG in PC-3 cells (cells with very low AEA hydrolysis). Pretreatment of cells with a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor, JZL184, which blocks 2-AG hydrolysis, decreases the RhoA activity. These results indicate the unique CB1 signaling and support the model that EC, through their autocrine activation of CB1 and subsequent repression of RhoA activity, suppress migration in prostate carcinoma cells.""","""['Kasem Nithipatikom', 'Ana Doris Gomez-Granados', 'Alan T Tang', 'Adam W Pfeiffer', 'Carol L Williams', 'William B Campbell']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Type 1 cannabinoid receptor ligands display functional selectivity in a cell culture model of striatal medium spiny projection neurons.', 'Cannabinoid receptor agonists modulate calcium channels in rat retinal Müller cells.', 'Cannabinoid receptor agonists potentiate action potential-independent release of GABA in the dentate gyrus through a CB1 receptor-independent mechanism.', 'Role of activated endocannabinoid system in regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism in macrophages.', 'Regulation of endocannabinoid release by G proteins: a paracrine mechanism of G protein-coupled receptor action.', 'The function of the endocannabinoid system in the pancreatic islet and its implications on metabolic syndrome and diabetes.', 'Cannabinoid CB1 receptor gene inactivation in oligodendrocyte precursors disrupts oligodendrogenesis and myelination in mice.', 'Cannabinoid and planar cell polarity signaling converges to direct placentation.', 'The Pathophysiology and the Therapeutic Potential of Cannabinoids in Prostate Cancer.', 'Cannabinoids and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of Animal Studies.']"""

To compensate for cell viability change, we normalized H3K27me3 signal to the total amount of H3 in each sample well. As a result, we show that the assay has a good dynamic range with a robust assay window. Using a methlytransferase inhibitor, DZNep, we show that the change of H3K27me3 signal is target specific.

In this study, we present a DNA vaccine encoding for the prostate-specific antigen prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to the J-domain and the SV40 enhancer sequence. The PAP DNA vaccine induced a strong PAP-specific cellular immune response after electroporation (EP)-based delivery in C57BL/6 mice.

Thus, the authors undertook a replication study in 1,357 prostate cancer patients and 1,403 healthy Australian males of European descent (2004-2008).

Further, analysis from AceView (Thierry-Mieg and Thierry-Mieg, Genome Biol. 2006;7(suppl 1):S12) indicated that rs12653946 falls within the intron of a testis-expressed gene strongly predicted to translate a conceptual 8.1-kilodalton protein named tojy.aApr07.

Level of Evidence 4. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Treatment regret can have an adverse impact on a patient's overall outlook and has been associated with a poorer global quality of life. Understanding predictors of regret can help clinicians better counsel patients about their treatments so that later regret can be avoided. In previous studies, regret has been associated with lesser educational attainment, non-White race, greater post-treatment declines in sexual function and systemic symptoms. The present study found that, among men with recurrent prostate cancer, those with cardiovascular comorbidity were >50% more likely to regret their treatment choice than men without cardiovascular comorbidity. This study highlights the growing importance of considering comorbidity when counselling patients about prostate cancer treatment options, and provides a rationale for men with cardiovascular comorbidity to give additional consideration to active surveillance for their newly diagnosed prostate cancer.  Objective:   • To determine whether cardiovascular comorbidity is associated with increased treatment regret among men with recurrent prostate cancer.  Methods:   • The study cohort comprised 795 men in the Comprehensive, Observational, Multicenter, Prostate Adenocarcinoma (COMPARE) registry who experienced biochemical recurrence at a median (interquartile range) of 5.5 (2.8-9.1) years after prostatectomy (n= 410), external beam radiation therapy (n= 237), brachytherapy (n= 124) or primary androgen deprivation therapy (n= 24). • Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether cardiovascular comorbidity was associated with treatment regret. • Cardiovascular comorbidity, which included myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, angina, diabetes, stroke or circulation problems, was defined using a validated two-question screening process after adjusting for sociodemographic and treatment factors and post-treatment bladder and bowel toxicity.  Results:   • Of 795 men, 14.8% reported regret. • Men with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to experience post-therapy bowel toxicity (P= 0.022). • In the adjusted multivariable model, the factors associated with increased treatment regret were: cardiovascular comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]= 1.52 [95% CI:1.00-2.31], P= 0.048); younger age (AOR: 0.97 [95% CI 0.94-0.99] per year increase in age, P= 0.019); and bowel toxicity after treatment (AOR 1.58 [95% CI 1.03-2.43], P= 0.038).

Due to sampling error, the Gleason score of clinically localized prostate cancer is frequently underestimated at the time of initial biopsy. Given that this may lead to inappropriate surveillance of patients with high-risk disease, there is considerable interest in identifying predictors of significant undergrading. Recently PSAD has been proposed to be an accurate predictor of subsequent upgrading in patients diagnosed with Gleason 6 disease on biopsy. We examined the predictive characteristics of PSAD in patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease on biopsy subsequently treated with radical prostatectomy. We found that although PSAD was a significant predictor of upgrade of biopsy Gleason 6 and 3 + 4 = 7 tumours, it failed to predict upgrading in patients with Gleason 7 tumours taken as a whole. When we explored reasons for this discrepancy, we found that the amount of PSA produced per unit tumour volume decreased with increasing Gleason score, thereby diminishing the predictive value of PSAD.  Objectives:   To analyse the performance of PSA density (PSAD) as a predictor of Gleason score upgrade in a large cohort stratified by Gleason score. We and others have shown that an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and final radical prostatectomy (RP) pathology is a significant risk factor for recurrence after local therapy.  Patients and methods:   Patients undergoing RP with matching biopsy information were identified from two prospective databases. Patients were analysed according to the concordance between biopsy and final pathology Gleason score in three paired groups: 6/>6, 3 + 4/>3 + 4, 7/>7. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated stratified by Gleason score, and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated. Logistic regression models were fitted to identify significant predictors of tumour upgrade.  Results:   From 1516 patients, 435 (29%) had an upgrade in Gleason score. ROC analysis showed a decline in AUC with increasing biopsy Gleason score, from 0.64 for biopsy Gleason score 6, to 0.57 for Gleason score 7. In logistic regression models containing pretreatment variables, e.g. clinical stage and number of positive cores, for Gleason score 6 and 3 + 4, PSAD was the strongest predictor of subsequent tumour upgrade (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.18-1.83, P= 0.001 and OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.14-1.67, P= 0.002, respectively). Surprisingly, in tumours upgraded from Gleason score 7 to >7, PSAD was not predictive even on univariable analysis, whereas clinical stage and number of positive cores were significant independent predictors. To explore the relationship between serum PSA and Gleason score, tumour volume was calculated in 669 patients. There was a strong association between Gleason score and tumour volume, with the median volume of Gleason score 7 and Gleason score >7 tumours being approximately twice and four-times that of Gleason score 6 tumours, respectively (P < 0.001). In contrast, the median serum PSA level per millilitre tumour volume decreased significantly with increasing grade, from 5.4 ng/mL for Gleason score 6 to 2.1 ng/mL for >7 (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   There is a strong correlation between Gleason score and tumour volume in well/intermediate differentiated tumours, and as they produce relatively high amounts of PSA per unit volume of cancer, high PSAD is the strongest single predictor of tumour undergrading. However, as higher grade tumours produce less PSA per unit volume, PSAD loses its predictive ability, and other clinical markers of tumour volume such as palpable disease and numbers of positive cores become more predictive.""","""['Niall M Corcoran', 'Rowan G Casey', 'Matthew K H Hong', 'John Pedersen', 'Stephen Connolly', 'Justin Peters', 'Laurence Harewood', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Anthony J Costello', 'Chris M Hovens', 'S Larry Goldenberg']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prostate-specific antigen vs prostate-specific antigen density as a predictor of upgrading in men diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer by contemporary multicore prostate biopsy.', 'Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Upgrade in Gleason score between prostate biopsies and pathology following radical prostatectomy significantly impacts upon the risk of biochemical recurrence.', 'Debulking surgery in the setting of very high-risk prostate cancer scenarios.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Specific Antigen Density and PI-RADSv2 score help identify Apical Prostate Cancer.', 'Developing a predictive model for clinically significant prostate cancer by combining age, PSA density, and mpMRI.', 'Combining prostate-specific antigen density with prostate imaging reporting and data system score version 2.1 to improve detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: A retrospective study.', 'Clinicopathological factors associated with pathological upgrading from biopsy to prostatectomy in patients with ISUP grade group ≤2 prostate cancer.', 'Significance of the prostate central gland and total gland volume ratio in the diagnosis of prostate cancer patients in the prostate specific antigen grey zone.']"""

We genotyped a potentially functional polymorphism (rs779805) in 5' UTR region of VHL in a case-control study of 665 PCa patients and 715 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population using the Taqman assay. The genetic associations between the incidence and progression of PCa were assessed by logistic regression.

An important finding was the substantially larger correlation between county-level rates for Black and White men in 2002 relatively to 1996, which suggests a convergence in their spatial patterns. Major significant factors for late-stage diagnosis included lack of insurance, low household income, smoking, not being married and presence of farm house.

Given that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway repairs a broad range of DNA damage, we evaluated interactions between pesticide exposure and 324 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging 27 NER genes among 776 prostate cancer cases and 1444 male controls in a nested case-control study of white Agricultural Health Study pesticide applicators. We determined interaction P values using likelihood ratio tests from logistic regression models and three-level pesticide variables (none/low/high) based on lifetime days of use weighted to an intensity score. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) method. Of the 17 interactions that met FDR <0.2, 3 displayed a monotonic increase in prostate cancer risk with increasing exposure in one genotype group and no significant association in the other group. Men carrying the variant A allele at ERCC1 rs2298881 exhibited increased prostate cancer risk with high versus no fonofos use [odds ratio (OR) 2.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-5.39; P(interact) = 3.6 × 10(-4); FDR-adjusted P = 0.11]. Men carrying the homozygous wild-type TT genotype at two correlated CDK7 SNPs, rs11744596 and rs2932778 (r(2) = 1.0), exhibited increased risk with high versus no carbofuran use (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.31-3.10 for rs11744596; P(interact) = 7.2 × 10(-4); FDR-adjusted P = 0.09). In contrast, we did not observe associations among men with other genotypes at these loci. While requiring replication, our findings suggest a role for NER genetic variation in pesticide-associated prostate cancer risk.""","""['Kathryn Hughes Barry', 'Stella Koutros', 'Gabriella Andreotti', 'Dale P Sandler', 'Laurie A Burdette', 'Meredith Yeager', 'Laura E Beane Freeman', 'Jay H Lubin', 'Xiaomei Ma', 'Tongzhang Zheng', 'Michael C R Alavanja', 'Sonja I Berndt']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Genetic variation in base excision repair pathway genes, pesticide exposure, and prostate cancer risk.', 'Pesticide exposure and inherited variants in vitamin d pathway genes in relation to prostate cancer.', 'Pesticide use modifies the association between genetic variants on chromosome 8q24 and prostate cancer.', 'Xenobiotic-metabolizing gene variants, pesticide use, and the risk of prostate cancer.', 'A Critical Scoping Review of Pesticide Exposure Biomonitoring Studies in Overhead Cultures.', 'Monitoring residues of pesticides in food in Brazil: A multiscale analysis of the main contaminants, dietary cancer risk estimative and mechanisms associated.', 'Reduced DNA Repair Capacity in Prostate Cancer Patients: A Phenotypic Approach Using the CometChip.', 'Haplotypes of single cancer driver genes and their local ancestry in a highly admixed long-lived population of Northeast Brazil.', 'Effects of Xeroderma pigmentosum group C polymorphism on the likelihood of prostate cancer.', 'Relationship between XPD, RAD51, and APEX1 DNA repair genotypes and prostate cancer risk in the male population of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']"""

The androgen receptor (AR) is uncommon among NRs in that ligand triggers an intramolecular interaction between its N- and C-terminal domains (termed the N/C interaction) and that coactivators can alternatively bind to surfaces in the AR N-terminal or hinge regions. The evolutionary conserved Mediator complex plays a key coregulatory role in steroid hormone-dependent transcription and is chiefly targeted to NRs via the LXXLL-containing MED1 subunit. Whereas MED1 has been demonstrated to serve as a key transcriptional coactivator for AR, the mechanisms by which AR recruits MED1 have remained unclear. Here we show that MED1 binds to a distinct AR N-terminal region termed transactivation unit-1 (Tau-1) via two newly discovered noncanonical α-helical motifs located between MED1 residues 505 and 537. Neither of the two MED1 LXXLL motifs is required for AR binding, whereas loss of the intramolecular AR N/C interaction decreases MED1 binding. We further demonstrate that mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of MED1 enhances the AR-MED1 interaction in prostate cancer cells.

One way to shift the ratio of benefits to harm is to focus on men at highest risk, who have more to benefit than average. Neither family history nor any of the currently identified genomic markers offer sufficient risk stratification for practical use. However, there is considerable evidence that the levels of PSA in blood are strongly prognostic of the long-term risk of aggressive prostate cancer. Specifically, it is difficult to justify continuing to screen men aged 60 or older if they have a PSA less than 1 or 2 ng/ml; for men 45-60, intervals between PSA tests can be based on PSA levels, with 2-4-year retesting interval for men with PSA of 1 ng/ml or higher, and tests every 6-8 years for men with PSA <1 ng/ml.

WKRG (daily intraperitoneal injection) prevented prostate overgrowth and epithelial thickening induced by testosterone in rats, and suppressed a rat prostate kallikrein-S3. In human prostate cells, WKRG inhibited testosterone-induced cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle by inducing p21 and p27, and induced apoptosis. Testosterone-induced expression of human kallikrein-3 mRNA and activation of androgen receptor (AR) were effectively inhibited by WKRG. Of the major ginsenosides included in WKRG, 20(S)-Rg3 was identified to repress AR activity and to attenuate prostate cell growth during testosterone stimulation. Moreover, 20(S)-Rg3 downregulated AR by facilitating the degradation of AR protein. WKRG and 20(S)-Rg3 were found to have new pharmacological activities against testosterone-induced prostate overgrowth.

Given that hCMV is frequently resident in salivary gland (SG) ductal epithelium, we hypothesized that hCMV would be important to the pathogenesis of SG mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC). This was initially supported by our finding that purified CMV induces malignant transformation in SG cells in an in vitro mouse model, and utilizes a pathogenic pathway previously reported for human MEC. Here we present the histologic and molecular characterizations of 39 human SG MECs selected randomly from a repository of cases spanning 2004-2011. Serial sections were obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded, tissue blocks from previous incisional or excisional biopsies. Immunohistochemical assays were performed for active hCMV proteins (IE1 and pp65) and the activated COX/AREG/EGFR/ERK signaling pathway. All four prospective causal criteria for viruses and cancer are fully satisfied: (1) protein markers for active hCMV are present in 97% of MECs; (2) markers of active hCMV are absent in non-neoplastic SG tissues; (3) hCMV-specific proteins (IE1, pp65) are in specific cell types and expression is positively correlated with severity; (4) hCMV correlates and colocalizes with an upregulation and activation of an established oncogenic signaling pathway (COX/AREG/EGFR/ERK). Thus, the evidential support reported here and previously in a mouse model is strongly confirmatory of a causal relationship between hCMV and SG mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

It describes the structure of the body tissues and abnormal structure gives the suspicion of the cancer or some other diseases. Observing the structural changes of these chaotic textures from the human eye is challenging process. However, the challenge can be defeat by forming mathematical descriptor to represent the histologic texture and classify the structural changes via a sophisticated computational method.  Objective:   In this paper, we propose a texture descriptor to observe the histologic texture into highly discriminative feature space.  Method:   Fractal dimension describes the self-similar structures in different and more accurate manner than topological dimension. Further, the fractal phenomenon has been extended to natural structures (images) as multifractal dimension. We exploited the multifractal analysis to represent the histologic texture, which derive more discriminative feature space for classification.  Results:   We utilized a set of histologic images (belongs to liver and prostate specimens) to assess the discriminative power of the multifractal features. The experiment was organized to classify the given histologic texture as cancer and non-cancer. The results show the discrimination capability of multifractal features by achieving approximately 95% of correct classification rate.  Conclusion:   Multifractal features are more effective to describe the histologic texture. The proposed feature descriptor showed high classification rate for both liver and prostate data sample datasets.""","""['Chamidu Atupelage', 'Hiroshi Nagahashi', 'Masahiro Yamaguchi', 'Michiie Sakamoto', 'Akinori Hashiguchi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Anal Cell Pathol (Amst)""","""['Computational grading of hepatocellular carcinoma using multifractal feature description.', 'Morphology-based multifractal estimation for texture segmentation.', 'Wavelet domain multifractal analysis for static and dynamic texture classification.', 'Fractal and multifractal analysis: a review.', 'Multifractal framework based on blanket method.', 'Mining textural knowledge in biological images: Applications, methods and trends.', 'Introduction to multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis in matlab.']"""

Objective:   Evaluate previously identified SNPs for association with prostate cancer and accuracy in predicting prostate cancer in a large prospective population-based cohort of unscreened men.  Design, setting, and participants:   This study used a nested case-control design based on the Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort with 943 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2829 matched controls. Blood samples were collected between 1991 and 1996, and follow-up lasted through 2005.  Measurements:   We genotyped 50 SNPs, analyzed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in blood from baseline, and tested for association with prostate cancer using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. We further developed a predictive model using SNPs nominally significant in univariate analysis and determined its accuracy to predict prostate cancer.  Results and limitations:   Eighteen SNPs at 10 independent loci were associated with prostate cancer. Four independent SNPs at four independent loci remained significant after multiple test correction (p<0.001). Seven SNPs at five independent loci were associated with advanced prostate cancer defined as clinical stage≥T3 or evidence of metastasis at diagnosis. Four independent SNPs were associated with advanced or aggressive cancer defined as stage≥T3, metastasis, Gleason score≥8, or World Health Organization grade 3 at diagnosis. Prostate cancer risk prediction with SNPs alone was less accurate than with PSA at baseline (area under the curve of 0.57 vs 0.79), with no benefit from combining SNPs with PSA. This study is limited by our reliance on clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer; there are likely undiagnosed cases among our control group.  Conclusions:   Only a few previously reported SNPs were associated with prostate cancer risk in the large prospective Diet and Cancer cohort in Malmö, Sweden.

Objective:   Evaluate prognostic factors for recurrence, progression, and disease-specific mortality after adjuvant intravesical BCG immunotherapy in patients with T1G3 NMIBC and long-term follow-up.  Design, setting, and participants:   A single-institution retrospective analysis of 146 patients with primary stage T1G3 NMIBC.  Intervention:   All patients were treated with complete transurethral resection (TUR) plus multiple bladder biopsies that included the prostatic urethra. No second TUR was done. Patients underwent an induction course of intravesical BCG (Connaught strain, 81mg) without maintenance therapy.  Measurements:   The variables analysed for time to recurrence, progression, and death due to bladder cancer (BCa) were gender, age, tumour multiplicity, diameter, aspect, substaging, concomitant carcinoma in situ (CIS), and CIS in the prostatic urethra. Cox regression models were used to assess the univariate and multivariate prognostic importance of these factors and estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Time-to-event distributions were estimated using cumulative incidence functions.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 8.7 yr. Sixty-five patients (44.5%) had recurrence, 25 patients (17.1%) had progression, and 18 patients (12.3%) died because of BCa. Female gender and presence of CIS in the prostatic urethra were associated with an increased risk of recurrence (p=0.0003, HR: 2.53), progression (p=0.001, HR: 3.59), and death due to BCa (p=0.004, HR: 3.53).  Conclusions:   In primary T1G3 bladder tumours treated with induction BCG, female gender or having CIS in the prostatic urethra were the only prognostic factors for time to recurrence, progression, and disease-related mortality.

Research design and methods:   Prospective data on 599 diabetic and 17,681 nondiabetic adults from the CLUE II (Give Us a Clue to Cancer and Heart Disease) cohort in Washington County, Maryland, were analyzed. Diabetes was defined by self-reported use of diabetes medications at baseline. Cancer incidence was ascertained using county and state cancer registries. Mortality data were obtained from death certificates.  Results:   From 1989 to 2006, 116 diabetic and 2,365 nondiabetic adults developed cancer, corresponding to age-adjusted incidence of 13.25 and 10.58 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Adjusting for age, sex, education, BMI, smoking, hypertension treatment, and high cholesterol treatment using Cox proportional hazards regression, diabetes was associated with a higher risk of incident cancer (hazard ratio 1.22 [95% CI 0.98-1.53]) and cancer mortality (1.36 [1.02-1.81]). In individuals who developed cancer, adults with diabetes had a higher risk of cancer case fatality (1.34 [1.002-1.79]) and all-cause mortality (1.61 [1.29-2.01]). For colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers, the attributable fractions resulting from diabetes were larger for cancer fatality and mortality than cancer incidence.

Inhibitors of thiol-dependent hydroperoxide metabolism [L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) and auranofin] were combined with the glucose metabolism inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) to determine if 17AAG-mediated cancer cell killing could be enhanced. When 2DG (20mM, 24h), BSO (1mM, 24h), and auranofin (500nM, 3h) were combined with 17AAG, cell killing was significantly enhanced in three human cancer cell lines (PC-3, SUM159, MDA-MB-231). Furthermore, the toxicity of this drug combination was significantly greater in SUM159 human breast cancer cells, relative to HMEC normal human breast epithelial cells. Increases in toxicity seen with this drug combination also correlated with increased glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) oxidation and depletion. Furthermore, treatment with the thiol antioxidant NAC (15mM, 24h) was able to significantly protect from drug-induced toxicity and ameliorate GSH oxidation, Trx oxidation, and Trx depletion. These data strongly support the hypothesis that simultaneous inhibition of GSH- and Trx-dependent metabolism is necessary to sensitize human breast and prostate cancer cells to 2DG+17AAG-mediated killing via enhancement of thiol-dependent oxidative stress. These results suggest that simultaneous targeting of both GSH and Trx metabolism could represent an effective strategy for chemosensitization in human cancer cells.""","""['Peter M Scarbrough', 'Kranti A Mapuskar', 'David M Mattson', 'David Gius', 'Walter H Watson', 'Douglas R Spitz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Combined inhibition of glycolysis, the pentose cycle, and thioredoxin metabolism selectively increases cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in human breast and prostate cancer.', 'Enhancement of carboplatin-mediated lung cancer cell killing by simultaneous disruption of glutathione and thioredoxin metabolism.', 'Enhancement of Radiation Response in Breast Cancer Stem Cells by Inhibition of Thioredoxin- and Glutathione-Dependent Metabolism.', 'The thioredoxin antioxidant system.', 'Potential Anticancer Activity of Auranofin.', 'PLX4032 resistance of patient-derived melanoma cells: crucial role of oxidative metabolism.', 'Trends and recent progresses of selenium nanoparticles as novel autophagy regulators for therapeutic development.', 'Glutathione levels are associated with methotrexate resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines.', 'Upgrade of an old drug: Auranofin in innovative cancer therapies to overcome drug resistance and to increase drug effectiveness.', 'Antineoplastic effects of auranofin in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma preclinical models.']"""

We examined the effect of several indicators on discharge patterns after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   Within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we focused on RPs performed between 2001 and 2007. Multivariable logistic regression analyses predicting the likelihood of prolonged LOS and ADD were performed.  Results:   Overall, 89,883 eligible RPs were identified, yielding a weighted national estimate of 442,400 eligible RPs. The rates of prolonged LOS decreased from 28.9 in the early period (2001-2003) to 14.4% in the late period (2006-2007) (P < 0.001). Similarly, the rates of ADD decreased from 7.4 in the early period to 5.0% in the late period (P < 0.001). In multivariable analyses adjusted for clustering, both annual hospital caseload (AHC) and insurance status were independent predictors of prolonged LOS and ADD. For example, RP performed at low AHC hospitals were more frequently associated with prolonged LOS than intermediate (OR = 0.45, P < 0.001) and high (OR = 0.21, P < 0.001) AHC hospitals. Similarly, RP performed at low AHC hospitals were more frequently associated with ADD than intermediate (OR = 0.54, P < 0.001) and high (OR = 0.63, P < 0.001) AHC hospitals.  Conclusions:   An improving temporal trend in discharge patterns was recorded in patients undergoing RP, with significant reductions in the rates of prolonged LOS and ADD.

Incontinence after RP (P-RP-I) varies widely (2% to <60%) according to the definition and quantification of incontinence, timing of evaluation, and who evaluates (physician or patient). Conservative treatments, including pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), anal electrical stimulation (AES), lifestyle adjustment, or combination are usually recommended at first for P-RP-I.  Methods:   Between January 2002 and December 2004, a total of 911 patients, median age 63 years (46-78), with different grades of P-RP-I have been retrospectively examined for perioperative risk factors and effect of rehabilitation procedures. These consecutive patients were from 67 clinics with median postoperative interval of 26 days. Incontinence was graded by Stamey classification, number of used pads and pads' consistency (dry, lightly wet, and wet). Therapeutic measures were done by team of specialists in rehabilitation, psycho-oncology, physiotherapy, internal medicine, and urology.  Results:   Ninety-six percent of patients suffered different grades of incontinence at beginning of hospitalization. This was reported as Stamey first grade (49.4%), second grade (36.4%), and third grade (10.3%). Analysis included patients' age, body mass index (BMI), prostate volume, surgical approach, nerve sparing, pelvic lymphadenectomy, previous therapy, and catheterization time.

We investigated the contribution of these prostate cancer risk variants in the Chinese population.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated the association of 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms at 8q24 with prostate cancer risk using high resolution melting curve combined gene sequencing methods in case-control groups, including 265 cases and 288 controls. We explored the association between clinical covariates (age at diagnosis, prostate specific antigen, Gleason score and tumor stage) and risk loci in our study to infer their impact on aggressive prostate cancer.  Results:   Four of the 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with prostate cancer risk, including rs16901966 (OR 1.343, 95% CI 1.029-1.754, p = 0.030), rs1447295 (OR 1.499, 95% CI 1.109-2.027, p = 0.008), rs11986220 (OR 1.589, 95% CI 1.160-2.178, p = 0.004) and rs10090154 (OR 1.571, 95% CI 1.146-2.154, p = 0.005).

Thus, further identification of signaling molecules and pathways that influence tumorigenesis is needed to increase the overall therapeutic options. GRKs, originally recognized for their conserved role in GPCR signal control, have now emerged as regulators of additional biological molecules and functions.  Materials and methods:   We used Western blot analysis to determine GRK expression in prostate cancer and RNA interference to establish the role of GRK5 in prostate cancer growth and progression through the cell cycle.  Results:   GRK5 was expressed highly in the aggressive prostate cancer PC3 cell line and its silencing by RNA interference attenuated in vitro cell proliferation. PC3 cells that stably expressed lentiviral small hairpin RNA and targeted GRK5 evidence reduced xenograft tumor growth in mice. This was reversed by rescuing expression with wild-type but not with kinase inactive K215R GRK5, implying the need of GRK5 kinase activity for tumor growth. To investigate possible cellular mechanism(s) for GRK5 in cell growth regulation we tested whether kinase activity would impact cell cycle progression. Like forced over expression of kinase-inactive K215R GRK5, GRK5 knockdown led to G2/M arrest in the cell cycle. Also, evidence revealed that the loss of GRK5 activity resulted in decreased cyclin D1 expression, Rb protein phosphorylation and E2F target gene expression involved in cell cycle control.  Conclusions:   Results provide direct evidence that GRK5 has an immediate role in the regulation of prostate tumor growth.""","""['Jae Il Kim', 'Prabir Chakraborty', 'Zhimin Wang', 'Yehia Daaka']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK5 phosphorylates moesin and regulates metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'G-protein coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-5 regulates proliferation of glioblastoma-derived stem cells.', 'BMP signals inhibit proliferation and in vivo tumor growth of androgen-insensitive prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Targeting GRK5 for Treating Chronic Degenerative Diseases.', 'GRK5 - A Functional Bridge Between Cardiovascular and Neurodegenerative Disorders.', 'Co-Overexpression of GRK5/ACTC1 Correlates With the Clinical Parameters and Poor Prognosis of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'Circ_0001821 knockdown suppresses growth, metastasis, and TAX resistance of non-small-cell lung cancer cells by regulating the miR-526b-5p/GRK5 axis.', 'Differential Regulation of GPCRs-Are GRK Expression Levels the Key?', 'Identification of Candidate Biomarkers for Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura by Bioinformatics Analysis of Microarray Data.', 'The GRKs Reactome: Role in Cell Biology and Pathology.']"""

Here we summarize the data for Chinese patients with prostate cancer (PCa), describe available treatment options, and report 5-year outcomes at multiple tertiary care institutions.  Patients and methods:   A series of 1611 patients (mean age 76.51 years) diagnosed with PCa were enrolled. Survival rates for patients were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors for disease-specific survival were analyzed using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   Seven hundreds and thirty-two patients with a prostate tumor clinical stage of III or IV and 879 with a tumor clinical stage of I or II were diagnosed. The disease-specific survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 94.6%, 81.3% and 72.6%, respectively. Five-year disease-specific survival rates were 99.2% for patients with low clinical stage PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy, 76.5% for those who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate plus hormone therapy, 38% for those who received hormone therapy plus radiation therapy and 29% for those that received hormone therapy alone.  Conclusions:   In keeping with a lack of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening, Chinese men present later in life and course of their disease, with over 27% men dying of PCa at five years. Debulking of tumors by surgery and radiation therapy for high grade tumor may provide some survival benefit in the senior men but further study is required to validate these findings.

Methods:   All probands aged 20-79 years with bone marrow biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of WM between May 1, 1999 and January 1, 2010 at the Bing Center for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia were eligible for inclusion in our analysis.

The objective of this study was to assess in a single institution the clinical and morphologic characteristics of neuroendocrine carcinomas diagnosed in needle core biopsies.  Materials and methods:   The current study analyses seven cases diagnosed in needle biopsies at a large tertiary regional cancer center from Northeastern Brazil. Two pathologists reviewed specimens retrospectively, and demographic and morphologic characteristics were compared to 458 acinar tumors diagnosed in the same period.  Results:   There were five small cell carcinomas and two low-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (carcinoid). NEC were associated with an acinar component in 5/7 cases and the Gleason score of the acinar component was always > 6. The number of cores involved in prostates with NEC was greater (65% compared to 24% of acinar tumors, p < 0.05). The mean PSA at diagnosis was 417.7 (range 5.7-1593, SD 218.3), compared to 100.5 (p = 0.1) of acinar tumors (range 0.3-8545, SD 22.7). Prostates harboring NEC were bigger (p < 0.001, mean volume 240 mL vs. 53 mL of acinar tumors). Treatment of NEC included palliative surgery, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.

Methods and materials:   Between 1993 and 2004, 1,056 patients with clinical Stage T1c-T3N0M0 prostate cancer, who had four or more biopsy cores sampled and complete biopsy core data available, were treated with external beam RT, with or without a high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost at William Beaumont Hospital. The median follow-up was 7.6 years. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed with PPC, Gleason score, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen, T stage, PNI, radiation dose, androgen deprivation, age, prostate-specific antigen frequency, and follow-up duration. A new risk stratification (PPC classification) was empirically devised to incorporate PPC and replace the T stage.  Results:   On multivariate Cox regression analysis, the PPC was an independent predictor of distant metastasis, cause-specific survival, and overall survival (all p < .05). A PPC >50% was associated with significantly greater distant metastasis (hazard ratio, 4.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-8.61), and its independent predictive value remained significant with or without androgen deprivation therapy (all p < .05). In contrast, PNI and T stage were only predictive for locoregional recurrence. Combining the PPC (≤50% vs. >50%) with National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk stratification demonstrated added prognostic value of distant metastasis for the intermediate-risk (hazard ratio, 5.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.78-16.6) and high-risk (hazard ratio, 4.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.70-11.3) groups, regardless of the use of androgen deprivation and high-dose RT (all p < .05). The proposed PPC classification appears to provide improved stratification of the clinical outcomes relative to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network classification.

Methods and materials:   Thirty patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy, to a total dose of 80 Gy in 40 fractions. In 15 patients, a daily-inserted air-filled ERB was applied. Prostate motion was tracked, in real-time, using an electromagnetic tracking system. Interfraction displacements, measured before each treatment, were quantified by calculating the systematic and random deviations of the center of mass of the implanted transponders. Intrafraction motion was analyzed in timeframes of 150 s, and displacements >1 mm, >3 mm, >5 mm, and >7 mm were determined in the anteroposterior, left-right, and superoinferior direction, and for the three-dimensional (3D) vector. Manual table corrections, made during treatment sessions, were retrospectively undone.  Results:   A total of 576 and 567 tracks have been analyzed in the no-ERB group and ERB group, respectively. Interfraction variation was not significantly different between both groups. After 600 s, 95% and 98% of the treatments were completed in the respective groups. Significantly fewer table corrections were performed during treatment fractions with ERB: 88 vs. 207 (p = 0.02). Intrafraction motion was significantly reduced with ERB. During the first 150 s, only negligible deviations were observed, but after 150 s, intrafraction deviations increased with time. This resulted in cumulative percentages of 3D-vector deviations >1 mm, >3 mm, >5 mm, and >7 mm that were 57.7%, 7.0%, 0.7%, and 0.3% in the ERB-group vs. 70.2%, 18.1%, 4.6%, and 1.4% in the no-ERB group after 600 s.

With the use of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), there is a greater likelihood that the differences in normal tissue and tumor response are due to biological rather than physical factors. We tested the hypothesis that prospectively scored acute toxicity is associated with biochemical failure-free rate (BFFR) in prostate cancer patients treated with IGRT.  Methods and materials:   We retrospectively analyzed BFFR in 362 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with IGRT. We compared BFFR with prospectively collected Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) maximum acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity scores. Median follow-up for all patients was 58.3 months after total radiotherapy doses of 75.6-79.8 Gy.  Results:   Patients reporting RTOG acute GU or GI toxicity scores of ≥ 2 were considered ""sensitive"" (n = 141, 39%) and patients reporting scores <2 were considered ""nonsensitive"" (n = 221, 61%). When calculating biochemical failure (BF) using the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology definition at 5 years, 76% (CI 70-82%) of the ""nonsensitive"" patients were failure free, compared with only 53% (CI 43-62%) of the ""sensitive"" patients (log-rank test, p < 0.0001). This difference was also observed using the Phoenix definition; ""nonsensitive"" 5-year BFFR was 81% (CI 74-86%) vs. ""sensitive"" BFFR was 68% (CI 58-76%; log-rank test p = 0.0012). The difference in BF between cohorts remained significant when controlled for radiation dose (75.6 vs. 79.8 Gy), prognostic stratification (T category, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score), and prostate volume.  Conclusions:   This study unexpectedly shows that prostate cancer patients who develop ≥ Grade 2 RTOG acute toxicity during radiotherapy are less likely to remain BFF at 5 years. These results deserve further study and, if validated in other large IGRT cohorts, additional models would be required to study interaction between normal tissue and tumor biology in prostate cancer patients.""","""['Danny Vesprini', 'Charles Catton', 'Lindsay Jacks', 'Gina Lockwood', 'Tara Rosewall', 'Andrew Bayley', 'Peter Chung', 'Mary Gospodarowicz', 'Cynthia Ménard', 'Michael Milosevic', 'Alan Nichol', 'Marketa Skala', 'Padraig Warde', 'Robert G Bristow']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In regard to Vesprini et al.', 'In reply to Nieder.', 'Improved clinical outcomes with high-dose image guided radiotherapy compared with non-IGRT for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Comparative toxicity and dosimetric profile of whole-pelvis versus prostate bed-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy after prostatectomy.', 'Clinical toxicities and dosimetric parameters after whole-pelvis versus prostate-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Role of the technical aspects of hypofractionated radiation therapy treatment of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Conventional Versus Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis along with Therapeutic Implications.', 'Fitting NTCP models to bladder doses and acute urinary symptoms during post-prostatectomy radiotherapy.', 'Radiotherapy and Hormone Treatment in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Validation of the Roach formula in a large extended nodal dissection series""","""Purpose:   Previous studies have criticized the predicting ability of the Roach formula in assessing the risk of lymph node invasion (LNI) in contemporary patients with prostate cancer (PCa) due to a significant overestimation of LNI rates. However, all those studies included patients treated with limited pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), which is associated with high rates of false negative findings. We hypothesized that the Roach formula is still an accurate tool for LNI predictions if an extended PLND (ePLND) is performed.  Methods and materials:   We included 3,115 consecutive patients treated with radical prostatectomy and ePLND between 2000 and 2010 at a single tertiary referral center. Extended PLND consisted of removal of obturator, external iliac, and hypogastric lymph nodes. We externally validated the Roach formula by using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and calibration plot method. Moreover, we tested the performance characteristics of different formula-generated cutoff values ranging from 1% to 20%.  Results:   The accuracy of the Roach formula was 80.3%. The calibration showed only a minor underestimation of the LNI risk in high-risk patients (6.7%). According to the Roach formula, the use of 15% cut off would have allowed 74.2% (2,311/3,115) of patients to avoid nodal irradiation, while up to 32.7% (111/336) of all patients with LNI would have been missed. When the cut off was lowered to 6%, nodal treatment would have been spared in 1,541 (49.5%) patients while missing 41 LNI patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values associated with the 6% cut off were 87.9%, 54%, and 97.3%, respectively.  Conclusions:   The Roach formula is still accurate and does not overestimate the rate of LNI in contemporary prostate cancer patients if they are treated with ePLND. However, the recommended cut off of 15% would miss approximately one-third of patients with LNI. Based on our results, the cut off should be lowered to 6%.""","""['Firas Abdollah', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Andrea Gallina', 'Umberto Capitanio', 'Marco Bianchi', 'Manuela Tutolo', 'Andrea Salonia', 'Mariangela La Macchia', 'Nadia Di Muzio', 'Patrizio Rigatti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In regard to ""Indications for pelvic nodal treatment in prostate cancer should change.

SOX4 is overexpressed in many human malignancies, but the precise role of SOX4 in cancer progression is still not well understood. Thus, the identification of additional SOX4 binding partners is essential for elucidating the mechanism of SOX4-mediated effects in cancer progression.  Results:   Here, we have adapted a one-step affinity purification method that enables rapid purification of SOX4 complexes via intracellular biotinylation of the amino-terminus of SOX4 to perform large-scale proteomics analysis. We have discovered that junction plakoglobin (JUP) interacts with SOX4 in both the cytosol and the nucleus and the interaction between SOX4 and plakoglobin is significantly increased when prostate and breast cancer cells are stimulated with WNT3A. Interactions between SOX4 and plakoglobin were further enhanced by the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB), suggesting that plakoglobin promotes nuclear export of SOX4. The SOX4-plakoglobin complex affected the expression of Wnt pathway target genes and SOX4 downstream targets, such as AXIN2, DICER1, and DHX9. In addition, SOX4 DNA binding activity to the promoters of DICER1, AXIN2, DHX9 and SOX4 itself was reduced by conditions that promote SOX4-plakoglobin complex formation. Conditions that enhanced SOX4-plakoglobin interactions resulted in reduced transcriptional activity of β-catenin luciferase reporters.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that this newly identified interaction between SOX4 and plakoglobin is inhibitory and provides new insights into the role of SOX4 in key pathways in cell proliferation, development, and cancer progression.""","""['Yu-Heng Lai', 'Jessica Cheng', 'Dongmei Cheng', 'Mattie E Feasel', 'Kyle D Beste', 'Junmin Peng', 'Asma Nusrat', 'Carlos S Moreno']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Cell Biol""","""['Genome-wide promoter analysis of the SOX4 transcriptional network in prostate cancer cells.', 'Sox4-mediated Dicer expression is critical for suppression of melanoma cell invasion.', 'Inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation by targeting Wnt/β-catenin pathway through Sox4 RNA interference.', 'The role of SRY-related HMG box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) in tumorigenesis and metastasis: friend or foe?', 'Beyond cell-cell adhesion: Plakoglobin and the regulation of tumorigenesis and metastasis.', 'A pan-cancer analysis of the expression and molecular mechanism of DHX9 in human cancers.', 'Hsa-miR-133a-3p, miR-1-3p, GOLPH3 and JUP combination results in a good biomarker to distinguish between prostate cancer and non-prostate cancer patients.', 'KRT13 promotes stemness and drives metastasis in breast cancer through a plakoglobin/c-Myc signaling pathway.', 'The enigmatic helicase DHX9 and its association with the hallmarks of cancer.', 'SOX4 activates CXCL12 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells to modulate endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis in vivo.']"""

The transition from protein biomarker discovery to verification can be a rate limiting step in clinical development of new diagnostics. Liquid chromatography-selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-SRM MS) is becoming an important tool for biomarker verification studies in highly complex biological samples. Analyte enrichment or sample fractionation is often necessary to reduce sample complexity and improve sensitivity of SRM for quantitation of clinically relevant biomarker candidates present at the low ng/mL range in blood. In this paper, we describe an alternative method for sample preparation for LC-SRM MS, which does not rely on availability of antibodies. This new platform is based on selective enrichment of proteotypic peptides from complex biological peptide mixtures via isoelectric focusing (IEF) on a digital ProteomeChip (dPC) for SRM quantitation using a triple quadrupole (QQQ) instrument with an LC-Chip (Chip/Chip/SRM). To demonstrate the value of this approach, the optimization of the Chip/Chip/SRM platform was performed using prostate specific antigen (PSA) added to female plasma as a model system. The combination of immunodepletion of albumin and IgG with peptide fractionation on the dPC, followed by SRM analysis, resulted in a limit of quantitation of PSA added to female plasma at the level of ∼1-2.5 ng/mL with a CV of ∼13%. The optimized platform was applied to measure levels of PSA in plasma of a small cohort of male patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and healthy matched controls with concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 25 ng/mL. A good correlation (r(2) = 0.9459) was observed between standard clinical ELISA tests and the SRM-based assay. Our data demonstrate that the combination of IEF on the dPC and SRM (Chip/Chip/SRM) can be successfully applied for verification of low abundance protein biomarkers in complex samples.""","""['Agnes Rafalko', 'Shujia Dai', 'William S Hancock', 'Barry L Karger', 'Marina Hincapie']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Proteome Res""","""['Evaluation of strong cation exchange versus isoelectric focusing of peptides for multidimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Immunoaffinity enrichment and liquid chromatography-selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry for quantitation of carbonic anhydrase 12 in cultured renal carcinoma cells.', 'Targeted quantification of low ng/mL level proteins in human serum without immunoaffinity depletion.', 'Advancing the sensitivity of selected reaction monitoring-based targeted quantitative proteomics.', 'Fractionation of complex protein mixtures by liquid-phase isoelectric focusing.', 'Proteomic Profiling and Artificial Intelligence for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Translational Medicine.', 'Prostate cancer proteomics: Current trends and future perspectives for biomarker discovery.', 'Application of Differential Proteomic Analysis to Authenticate Ophiocordyceps sinensis.', 'The clinical impact of recent advances in LC-MS for cancer biomarker discovery and verification.', 'Long-gradient separations coupled with selected reaction monitoring for highly sensitive, large scale targeted protein quantification in a single analysis.']"""

Nanoshells utilised in combination with laser therapy can potentially enable selective heat deposition, greater thermal injury, and diminished HSP expression in the tumour. The study objective was to measure the distribution of temperature and HSP expression in prostate tumours in response to laser therapy alone or with nanoshells to determine if these combinatorial therapies can minimise HSP expression.  Methods:   PC3 cells were inoculated in the backs of CB17-Prkd c SCID/J mice and treated with external laser irradiation (wavelength of 810 nm, irradiance of 5 W/cm(2), spot size of 5 mm, and heating duration of 3 min) alone or in combination with gold nanoshells (diameter of 55 nm and outer gold shell thickness of 10 nm) introduced into the tumour 24 h prior to laser treatment. Magnetic resonance temperature imaging was used to measure the distribution of temperature elevation in the tumours during laser treatment. Tumours were sectioned 16 h following laser treatment, stained for Hsp27 and Hsp70, imaged with a confocal microscope, and HSP expression levels were quantified as a function of depth in the tumours.  Results:   Maximum temperature elevations at the tumour surface were 28°C for laser treatment only and 50°C for laser heating in combination with gold nanoshells. Laser therapy alone caused significant induction of HSP expression in the first few millimeters of the tumour depth, whereas decreasing HSP expression occurred with greater tumour depth. Tumours treated with laser and nanoshells experienced substantial temperatures (73-78°C) at the tumour surface and temperatures greater than 53°C in the first few millimeters which eliminated HSP expression.  Conclusion:   Inclusion of nanoshells in laser therapy can provide a mechanism for enhancing heat deposition capable of eliminating HSP expression within a larger tumour region compared to laser heating alone.""","""['Marissa Nichole Rylander', 'R Jason Stafford', 'John Hazle', 'Jon Whitney', 'Kenneth R Diller']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['Photothermal response of human and murine cancer cells to multiwalled carbon nanotubes after laser irradiation.', 'Patterns of heat shock protein (HSP70) expression and Kupffer cell activity following thermal ablation of liver and colorectal liver metastases.', 'Measurement and mathematical modeling of thermally induced injury and heat shock protein expression kinetics in normal and cancerous prostate cells.', 'Thermally induced injury and heat-shock protein expression in cells and tissues.', 'Heat shock proteins in prostate cancer: from tumorigenesis to the clinic.', 'Multilayer In Vitro Human Skin Tissue Platforms for Quantitative Burn Injury Investigation.', 'Picosecond Laser-Induced Photothermal Skin Damage Evaluation by Computational Clinical Trial.', 'Pulsed-laser irradiation of multifunctional gold nanoshells to overcome trastuzumab resistance in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.', 'Targeting Cancer Stem Cells to Overcome Chemoresistance.', 'Targeted heat activation of HSP promoters in the skin of mammalian animals and humans.']"""

Gold nanoshells (AuNS) can be tuned to absorb light in the range used for laser ablation and may facilitate more conformal tumor heating and sparing of normal tissue via enhanced tumor specific heating. This concept was investigated in a xenograft model of prostate cancer (PC-3) using MR temperature imaging (MRTI) in a 1.5T scanner to characterize the spatiotemporal temperature distribution resulting from nanoparticle mediated heating. Tumors with and without intravenously injected AuNS were exposed to an external laser tuned to 808 nm for 180 sec at 4 W/cm(2) under real-time monitoring with proton resonance frequency shift based MRTI. Microscopy indicated that these nanoparticles (140-150 nm) accumulated passively in the tumor and remained close to the tumor microvasculature. MRTI measured a statistically significant (p < 0.001) increase in maximum temperature in the tumor cortex (mean = 21 ± 7°C) in +AuNS tumors versus control tumors. Analysis of the temperature maps helped demonstrate that the overall distribution of temperature within +AuNS tumors was demonstrably higher versus control, and resulted in damage visible on histopathology. This research demonstrates that passive uptake of intravenously injected AuNS in PC-3 xenografts converts the tumor vasculature into a potent heating source for nanoparticle mediated ablation at power levels which do not generate significant damage in normal tissue. When used in conjunction with MRTI, this has implications for development and validation of more conformal delivery of therapy for interstitial laser ablations.""","""['R Jason Stafford', 'Anil Shetty', 'Andrew M Elliott', 'Jon A Schwartz', 'Glenn P Goodrich', 'John D Hazle']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['Theranostics with multifunctional magnetic gold nanoshells: photothermal therapy and t2* magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Heat shock protein expression and temperature distribution in prostate tumours treated with laser irradiation and nanoshells.', 'Selective prostate cancer thermal ablation with laser activated gold nanoshells.', 'Catheter-based ultrasound applicators for selective thermal ablation: progress towards MRI-guided applications in prostate.', 'Laser-induced thermal therapy for tumor ablation.', 'Gd2O3-mesoporous silica/gold nanoshells: A potential dual T1/T2 contrast agent for MRI-guided localized near-IR photothermal therapy.', 'Nanoparticle-assisted, image-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy for cancer treatment.', 'Alternating-Magnetic-Field-Mediated Wireless Manipulations of a Liquid Metal for Therapeutic Bioengineering.', 'Multi-parameter MRI to investigate vasculature modulation and photo-thermal ablation combination therapy against cancer.', 'The Combination of Laser Therapy and Metal Nanoparticles in Cancer Treatment Originated From Epithelial Tissues: A Literature Review.']"""

Inhibition of IGF-1 and the downstream signaling pathways mediated by the activation of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) may be involved in inhibiting prostate carcinogenesis. We investigated whether genistein downregulated the IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling pathway and inhibited cell growth in hormone refractory PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Genistein treatment caused a significant inhibition of IGF-1-stimulated cell growth. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that genistein significantly decreased the number of IGF-1-stimulated cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In IGF-1-treated cells, genistein effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of IGF-1R and the phosphorylation of its downstream targets, such as Src, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSk-3β). IGF-1 treatment decreased the levels of E-cadherin but increased the levels of β-catenin and cyclin D1.

Most investigations have compared aviators to the general population. Instead, our study compared prostate cancer incidence rates among officer aviators and non-aviators in the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to reduce confounding by socioeconomic status and frequency of medical exams.  Methods:   This retrospective analysis ascertained prostate cancer cases using the Automated Cancer Tumor Registry of the Department of Defense linked to personnel records from the USAF Personnel Center to identify aviators and non-aviators. Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards model allowed comparison of prostate cancer incidence rates in USAF aviators and non-aviators.  Results:   After adjustment for age and race, the hazards ratio for prostate cancer incidence comparing aviators with non-aviators was 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.85-1.44). Neither prostate cancer incidence nor time to diagnosis differed significantly between the two groups.  Conclusion:   Our study compared prostate cancer rates in aviators with a reference group of non-aviators similar in socio-economic level and frequency of exams.

We recently reported that C-terminal truncated constitutively active AR splice variants contribute to CRPC development. Since specific antibodies detecting all C-terminal truncated AR variants are not available, our aim was to develop an approach to assess the prevalence and function of AR variants in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methodology/principal findings:   Using 2 antibodies against different regions of AR protein (N- or C-terminus), we successfully showed the existence of AR variant in the LuCaP 86.2 xenograft. To evaluate the prevalence of AR variants in human PCa tissue, we used this method on tissue microarrays including 50 primary PCa and 162 metastatic CRPC tissues. RT-PCR was used to confirm AR variants. We observed a significant decrease in nuclear C-terminal AR staining in CRPC but no difference between N- and C-terminal AR nuclear staining in primary PCa. The expression of the AR regulated proteins PSA and PSMA were marginally affected by the decrease in C-terminal staining in CRPC samples. These data suggest that there is an increase in the prevalence of AR variants in CRPC based on our ability to differentiate nuclear AR expression using N- and C-terminal AR antibodies. These findings were validated using RT-PCR. Importantly, the loss of C-terminal immunoreactivity and the identification of AR variants were different depending on the site of metastasis in the same patient.  Conclusions:   We successfully developed a novel immunohistochemical approach which was used to ascertain the prevalence of AR variants in a large number of primary PCa and metastatic CRPC.

The proliferative action of the androgen receptor is activated by 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Thus, prostate growth is governed by the balance between androgen receptor and ERβ activation. 3β-Adiol is a high-affinity ligand and agonist of ERβ and is derived from DHT by 3-keto reductase/3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes. Here, we demonstrate that, when it is expressed in living cells containing an estrogen response element-luciferase reporter, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 6 (17βHSD6) converts the androgen DHT to the estrogen 3β-Adiol, and this leads to activation of the ERβ reporter. This conversion of DHT occurs at concentrations that are in the physiological range of this hormone in the prostate. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 17βHSD6 is expressed in ERβ-positive epithelial cells of the human prostate and that, in prostate cancers of Gleason grade higher than 3, both ERβ and 17βHSD6 are undetectable. Both proteins were present in benign prostatic hyperplasia samples.

Recent studies have implicated PTEN as a determinant of homologous recombination (HR) through defective RAD51 function. Similar to BRCA1/2-defective tumor cells, PTEN-null prostate and other cancer cells have been reported to be sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi). To date, no direct comparison between PTEN and RAD51 expression in primary prostate tumors has been reported.  Experimental design:   Prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts with known PTEN status (22RV1-PTEN(+/+), DU145-PTEN(+/-), PC3-PTEN(-/-)) and H1299 and HCT116 cancer cells were used to evaluate how PTEN loss affects RAD51 expression and PARPi sensitivity. Primary prostate cancers with known PTEN status were analyzed for RAD51 expression.  Results:   PTEN status is not associated with reduced RAD51 mRNA or protein expression in primary prostate cancers. Decreased PTEN expression did not reduce RAD51 expression or clonogenic survival following PARPi among prostate cancer cells that vary in TP53 and PTEN. PARPi sensitivity instead associated with a defect in MRE11 expression. PTEN-deficient cells had only mild PARPi sensitivity and no loss of HR or RAD51 recruitment. Clonogenic cell survival following a series of DNA damaging agents was variable: PTEN-deficient cells were sensitive to ionizing radiation, mitomycin-C, UV, H(2)O(2), and methyl methanesulfonate but not to cisplatin, camptothecin, or paclitaxel.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that the relationship between PTEN status and survival following DNA damage is indirect and complex.

Exposure of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells (harboring wild-type p53) and PC-3 cells (lacking p53) with 10-80 μg/ml of GTP for 24 h resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of class I HDAC enzyme activity and its protein expression. GTP treatment causes an accumulation of acetylated histone H3 in total cellular chromatin, resulting in increased accessibility to bind with the promoter sequences of p21/waf1 and Bax, consistent with the effects elicited by an HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A. GTP treatment also resulted in increased expression of p21/waf1 and Bax at the protein and message levels in these cells. Furthermore, treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitor, MG132 together with GTP prevented degradation of class I HDACs, compared with cells treated with GTP alone, indicating increased proteasomal degradation of class I HDACs by GTP. These alterations were consistent with G(0)-G(1) phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in both cell lines.

Methods:   Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) using time-dependent Cox regression for fracture incidence related to the recency of exposure and dose among prostate cancer patients on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, as well as mortality associated with fractures.  Results:   In our cohort of 80 844 patients, ADT was associated with an increased rate of fracture in both non-metastatic patients (aHR = 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-1.39) and metastatic patients (aHR = 1.51; 95%CI = 1.36-1.67). Fracture rates increased with increasing cumulative GnRH dose but decreased with increasing number of months since last use in each dose category.

Since cytokines have been associated with the biology of cancer and its prognosis, we determined whether transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1), interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor and IL-7 levels add additional prognostic information with regard to prostate cancer-specific survival.  Materials and methods:   Retrospective survival analysis of forty-four prostate cancer patients, that underwent radical prostatectomy, was performed (1989-2001). Age, Gleason score and pre-treatment PSA levels were collected. IL-7, IL-7 receptor and TGFβ1 levels in prostate cancer tissue were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and their additional prognostic value analyzed with regard to prostate cancer survival. Hazard ratios and their confidence intervals were estimated, and Akaike's information criterion was calculated for model comparison.  Results:   The predictive ability of a model for prostate cancer survival more than doubled when TGFβ1 and IL-7 were added to a model containing only the Gleason score and pre-treatment PSA (AIC: 18.1 and AIC: 6.5, respectively).  Conclusion:   IL-7 and TGFβ1 are promising markers to indicate those at risk for poor prostate cancer survival.

The relatively recent addition of frequent in-room imaging to assist with patient localization has provided a database of images that may be used to recalculate dose distributions for adaptive radiotherapy purposes. The TomoTherapy Hi-Art II unit (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) uses a helical scanning geometry and a megavoltage (MV) beam to acquire volumetric patient images. This study evaluated the uncertainty of dose calculations performed on megavoltage CT (MVCT) images as a function of temporal Hounsfield Unit (HU) variations observed in the imaging system over three years on two machines. A baseline error between dose calculations performed on kVCT and MVCT images was established using a series of phantoms. This baseline error ranged from -1.4% to 0.6%. Materials of differing densities were imaged and MVCT numbers were measured periodically. The MVCT number of solid water varied from 5 to 103 HU and consistently increased prior to target replacement. Finally, the dosimetric uncertainty of the temporal HU variation was assessed using MVCT images of typical head and neck, lung and prostate cancer patients. Worst-case MVCT recalculation errors could approach 5%, 7% and 10% for the head and neck, lung and prostate images, respectively.

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the in vitro proliferation of murine androgen insensitive prostate carcinoma cells RM1 in the presence of leptin and insulin. After assessing and confirming the presence of leptin and insulin receptors in RM1 cells by immunocytochemistry, cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of leptin (0, 25, 50, 100 and 200 ng/mL), insulin (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 nM) or leptin plus insulin ( 25 ng/ml + 50 nM; 50 ng/ml + 100 nM; 100 ng/ml + 150 nM; 200 ng/ml + 200 nM; 25 ng/ml + 150 nM; 100 ng/ml + 50 nM of leptin plus insulin, respectively). Cell proliferation was evaluated by assessing the percentage of resazurin reduction, a surrogate marker of cell metabolic rate. Leptin significantly decreased the percentage of resazurin reduction in all studied concentrations while there was only a slight or non significant difference in RM1cell proliferation in the presence of insulin or insulin combined with leptin when compared with control. These results show that leptin decreases RM1 prostate cancer cell proliferation at the studied concentrations, while insulin is able to antagonize the leptin inhibition of RM1 prostate cancer cell growth in vitro.

Early identification of men in whom radiotherapy and 6 months of androgen suppression is insufficient for cure is important. Thus, we assessed whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values can act as an early surrogate for prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).  Methods:   We systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials that showed improved overall and prostate cancer-specific survival with radiotherapy and 6 months of androgen suppression compared with radiotherapy alone and measured lowest PSA concentrations (PSA nadir) and those immediately after treatment (PSA end). We assessed a cohort of 734 men with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer from two eligible trials in the USA and Australasia that randomly allocated participants between Feb 2, 1996, and Dec 27, 2001. We used Prentice criteria to assess whether reported PSA nadir or PSA end concentrations of more than 0·5 ng/mL were surrogates for PCSM.  Findings:   Men treated with radiotherapy and 6 months of androgen suppression in both trials were significantly less likely to have PSA end and PSA nadir values of more than 0·5 ng/mL than were those treated with radiotherapy alone (p<0·0001). Presence of candidate surrogates (ie, PSA end and PSA nadir values >0·5 ng/mL) alone and when assessed in conjunction with the randomised treatment group increased risk of PCSM in the US trial (PSA nadir p=0·0016; PSA end p=0·017) and Australasian trial (PSA nadir p<0·0001; PSA end p=0·0012). In both trials, the randomised treatment group was no longer associated with PCSM (p ≥ 0·20) when the candidate surrogates were included in the model. Therefore, both PSA metrics satisfied Prentice criteria for surrogacy.  Interpretation:   After radiotherapy and 6 months of androgen suppression, men with PSA end values exceeding 0·5 ng/mL should be considered for long-term androgen suppression and those with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer with PSA nadir values exceeding 0·5 ng/mL should be considered for inclusion in randomised trials investigating the use of drugs that have extended survival in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.

This study aims to describe trends of prostate cancer testing and incidence by demographic and clinical characteristics and identify potential correlations between prostate cancer testing and incidence.  Methods:   We examined prostate cancer testing and incidence rates among American men under age of 50 using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008) and data from the National Program of Cancer Registries and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results programs (2001-2006). We conducted descriptive, logistic regression, and trend analyses using SUDAAN and SEER*Stat.  Results:   The prostate cancer incidence rate among black men was more than 2-fold that of white men. The overall prostate cancer incidence rate slightly increased from 2001 to 2006; however, the prevalence of prostate cancer testing declined over time. There was a borderline significant increase in prostate cancer incidence rate (APC=3.5, 95% CI=0.0, 7.0) for men aged 40-44. Well-differentiated prostate cancer incidence decreased significantly (APC=-24.7; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-34.9, -12.8) over time.  Conclusions:   We observed a large difference in prostate cancer incidence between blacks and whites under age 50. Similar patterns in prostate cancer testing and cancer incidence by race and ethnicity suggested prostate cancer testing might have influenced incidence to some extent in this young population. The different temporal patterns for prostate cancer testing and incidence, especially for men aged 40-44 years, suggested screening alone could not fully accounted for the increasing prostate cancer incidence rates.

In fact, there are more such changes in the stroma than the epithelium. These include down-regulated expression of genes involved in smooth muscle cell differentiation and those differentially expressed between prostate and bladder, i.e., organ-restricted. In development, the stromal cell type mediates tissue formation from differentiation of stem or progenitor cells. Diseases like cancer may arise as a result of defective stromal signaling. Stromal signaling can be demonstrated by co-culture of stromal cells and embryonal carcinoma NCCIT cells used as a stem cell substitute. In co-culture, stromal cells induce NCCIT cells through diffusible molecules to lose stem cell gene expression, gain expression of prostate genes, alter cytomorphology, and lower proliferation. This NCCIT response is varied as co-cultured bladder stromal cells induce a different gene expression. At the same time, NCCIT factors also affect gene expression of co-cultured stromal cells. NCCIT induces normal prostate tissue (NP) stromal cells to become more like cancer-associated (CP) stromal cells in both mRNA and microRNA expression.

For some organs, such as the oral cavity, cervix and skin, the respective putative pre-invasive lesions can be observed over time and documented to progress to invasive lesions. However, for less readily observable lesions, such as those of the prostate, the progression of the pre-invasive lesions, e.g., prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostatic proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) to prostatic cancer are more difficult to document. Thus, for most organ systems, specific pre-invasive neoplastic lesions have been proposed based upon the apparent observations of one or more of the following: 1) microinvasive disease developing from a pre-invasive neoplastic lesion, 2) the general association of the pre-invasive lesion with invasive lesions, 3) the subsequent development of invasive lesions following diagnosis of the pre-invasive lesion, 4) correlations of the molecular features of the putative pre-invasive lesion with the matching invasive lesions, and 5) reductions in the rate of cancer following removal of the pre-invasive lesion. When there are mixtures of pre-invasive lesions with actual cancers in the same case, some of the above specific associations are more difficult to make. Several terms have been used to describe pre-invasive lesions, many of which are now less useful as our knowledge of these lesions increases. It is now commonly accepted that these lesions are a features of the spectrum of neoplastic development and most are accepted as ``neoplastic lesions'' with associated molecular features, even though they may be reversible even if they have mutations in suppressor genes (e.g., p53) or are associated with viral etiologies (e.g., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). The overall term, ""pre-invasive neoplasia"", seems to best describe these putative pre-invasive lesions. Thus, terms such as incipient neoplasia should be abandoned. The term ""intra-epithelial neoplasia"" with an associated grade, which has been developed for pre-invasive neoplastic lesions of the cervix, i.e. cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), seems to be a terminology that adds consistency across epithelial organs. Thus, adoption of these terms for the additional organ sites of pancreas (PanIN) and prostate (PIN) seems accepted. Less descriptive terms such as the degrees of dysplasia of the oral cavity and bronchopulmonary system and actinic keratosis and Bowen's disease of the skin might be better designated as oral intraepithelial neoplasia (OIN), pulmonary intraepithelial neoplasia (PulIN) and dermal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN). The etiology of pre-invasive neoplasia is the etiology of the matching cancers. Some obvious initiating factors include exposure to the whole range of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, tobacco abuse and a broad range of other carcinogens (e.g., benzene). A frequent initiation factor is the setting of long standing continuing damage, inflammation and repair (LOCDIR) which leads to early molecular features associated with neoplasia after about one year. An excellent example of this is ulcerative colitis (UC) in which dysregulation of microsatellite repair enzymes have been documented one year following diagnosis of UC. While the nomenclature, description, diagnosis and etiology of pre-invasive neoplasia has advanced, approaches to therapy of such lesions have not progressed adequately even though it has been identified that, for example, removal of polyps periodically from the colorectum, DCIS from the breast, and high grade CIN from the cervix, results in a reduction in the development of cancers of the colorectum, breast, and cervix, respectively. With the development of more molecularly targeted therapy with fewer side effects, preventive therapies may be more successfully targeted to pre-invasive neoplastic lesions.""","""['William E Grizzle', 'Sudhir Srivastava', 'Upender Manne']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Biomark""","""['High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: the only accepted prostate cancer precursor lesion.', 'Topographic and quantitative relationship between prostate inflammation, proliferative inflammatory atrophy and low-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia: a biopsy study in chronic prostatitis patients.', 'Expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase in vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia and squamous cell carcinoma: an immunohistochemical study with survivin and p53.', 'Indigo carmine-assisted high-magnification chromoscopic colonoscopy for the detection and characterisation of intraepithelial neoplasia in ulcerative colitis: a prospective evaluation.', 'The significance of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia for the development of prostate carcinoma.

Level of Evidence 2a. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The present study is one of the first to investigate urologists' and patients' compliance with recommendations based on a risk calculator that calculates the probability of indolent prostate cancer. A threshold was set for a recommendation of active surveillance vs active treatment. Active surveillance recommendations based on a prostate cancer risk calculator were followed by most patients, but 30% with active treatment recommendations chose active surveillance instead. This indicates that the threshold may be too high for urologists and patients.  Objectives:   • To assess urologists' and patients' compliance with treatment recommendations based on a prostate cancer risk calculator (RC) and the reasons for non-compliance. • To assess the difference between patients who were compliant and non-compliant with recommendations based on this RC.  Patients and methods:   • Eight urologists from five Dutch hospitals included 240 patients with prostate cancer (PCa), aged 55-75 years, from December 2008 to February 2011. • The urologists used the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer RC which predicts the probability of potentially indolent PCa (P[indolent]), using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume and pathological findings on biopsy. • Inclusion criteria were PSA <20 ng/mL, clinical stage T1 or T2a-c disease, <50% positive sextant biopsy cores, ≤ 20 mm cancer tissue, ≥ 40 mm benign tissue and Gleason ≤ 3 + 3. If the P(indolent) was >70%, active surveillance (AS) was recommended, and active treatment (AT) otherwise. • After the treatment decision, patients completed a questionnaire about their treatment choice, related (dis)advantages, and validated measurements of other factors, e.g. anxiety.  Results:   • Most patients (45/55, 82%) were compliant with an AS recommendation. Another 54 chose AS despite an AT recommendation (54/185, 29%). • The most common reason for non-compliance with AT recommendations by urologists was the patient's preference for AS (n= 30). These patients most often reported the delay of physical side effects of AT as the main advantage (n= 19). • Those who complied with AT recommendations had higher mean PSA levels (8 vs 7 ng/mL, P= 0.02), higher mean amount of cancer tissue (7 vs 3 mm, P < 0.001), lower mean P(indolent) (36% vs 55%, P < 0.001), and higher mean generic anxiety scores (42 vs 38, P= 0.03) than those who did not comply.  Conclusions:   • AS recommendations were followed by most patients, while 29% with AT recommendations chose AS instead. • Although further research is needed to validate the RC threshold, the current version is already useful in treatment decision-making in men with localized PCa.""","""['Heidi A van Vugt', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Erik H A M van Muilekom', 'Martijn Busstra', 'Paul Kil', 'Eric H Oomens', 'Annemarie Leliveld', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Ida Korfage', 'Ewout W Steyerberg']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Compliance with biopsy recommendations of a prostate cancer risk calculator.', 'Pathological stage distribution in patients treated with radical prostatectomy reflecting the need for protocol-based active surveillance: results from a contemporary European patient cohort.', 'Outcomes of initially expectantly managed patients with low or intermediate risk screen-detected localized prostate cancer.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Noninvasive assays for apoptosis in cell cultures can aid in screening of new anticancer agents. We have previously demonstrated that elastic scattering spectroscopy can monitor apoptosis in cell cultures. In this report we present data on monitoring the detailed time-course of scattering changes in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and PC-3 prostate cancer cells treated with staurosporine to induce apoptosis. Changes in the backscattering spectrum are detectable within 10 min, and continue to progress up to 48 h after staurosporine treatment, with the magnitude and kinetics of scattering changes dependent on inducer concentration. Similar responses were observed in CHO cells treated with several other apoptosis-inducing protocols. Early and late scattering changes were observed under conditions shown to induce apoptosis via caspase activity assay and were absent under conditions where apoptosis was not induced. Finally, blocking caspase activity and downstream apoptotic morphology changes prevented late scattering changes. These observations demonstrate that early and late changes in wavelength-dependent backscattering correlate with the presence of apoptosis in cell cultures and that the late changes are specific to apoptosis.""","""['Christine S Mulvey', 'Kexiong Zhang', 'Wei-Han Bobby Liu', 'David J Waxman', 'Irving J Bigio']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biomed Opt""","""['Wavelength-dependent backscattering measurements for quantitative real-time monitoring of apoptosis in living cells.', 'Wavelength-dependent backscattering measurements for quantitative monitoring of apoptosis, part 2: early spectral changes during apoptosis are linked to apoptotic volume decrease.', 'Types of cell death and apoptotic stages in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells distinguished by Raman spectroscopy.', 'Low-concentration staurosporine improves recombinant antibody productivity in Chinese hamster ovary cells without inducing cell death.', 'Staurosporine induces apoptosis of melanoma by both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways.', 'Spatial frequency domain imaging for monitoring immune-mediated chemotherapy treatment response and resistance in a murine breast cancer model.', 'Noninvasive Optical Assessment of Implanted Tissue-Engineered Construct Success In Situ.', 'Activation of EphA receptors mediates the recruitment of the adaptor protein Slap, contributing to the downregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.', 'Polarized multispectral imaging in a rigid endoscope based on elastic light scattering spectroscopy.']"""

Our data indicates that the refractive index distribution of histopathology slides, which contains information about the molecular scale organization of tissue, reveals prostate tumors and breast calcifications. These optical maps report on subtle, nanoscale morphological properties of tissues and cells that cannot be recovered by common stains, including hematoxylin and eosin. We found that cancer progression significantly alters the tissue organization, as exhibited by consistently higher refractive index variance in prostate tumors versus normal regions. Furthermore, using the quantitative phase information, we obtained the spatially resolved scattering mean free path and anisotropy factor g for entire biopsies and demonstrated their direct correlation with tumor presence.

Although population-based data in Africa are quite limited, the available data from IARC showed that rates among blacks were highest in the East (10.7-38.1 per 100,000 man-years, age-adjusted world standard) and lowest in the West (4.7-19.8). These rates were considerably lower than those of 80.0-195.3 observed among African Americans. Rates in Africa increased over time (1987-2002) and have been comparable to those for distant stage in African Americans. These patterns are likely due to differences between African and African American men in medical care access, screening, registry quality, genetic diversity, and Westernization.

This protein has been shown to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancer cells. Despite the implication of LIV-1 in cancer growth and metastasis, there has been no study to determine the role of LIV-1 in prostate cancer progression. Moreover, there was no clear delineation of the molecular mechanism underlying LIV-1 function in cancer cells. In the present communication, we found increased LIV-1 expression in benign, PIN, primary and bone metastatic human prostate cancer. We characterized the mechanism by which LIV-1 drives human prostate cancer EMT in an androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells (ARCaP) prostate cancer bone metastasis model. LIV-1, when overexpressed in ARCaP(E) (derivative cells of ARCaP with epithelial phenotype) cells, promoted EMT irreversibly. LIV-1 overexpressed ARCaP(E) cells had elevated levels of HB-EGF and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP 9 proteolytic enzyme activities, without affecting intracellular zinc concentration. The activation of MMPs resulted in the shedding of heparin binding-epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) from ARCaP(E) cells that elicited constitutive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation and its downstream extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling.

The function of immature cells and their mutual relation with secretory cells are still poorly understood. Immature cells either have a hierarchical relation to secretory cells (stem cell model) or represent an inducible population emerging upon appropriate stimulation of differentiated cells. Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) receptor c-MET is specifically expressed in immature prostate cells. Our objective is to determine the role of immature cells in prostate cancer by analysis of the HGF/c-MET pathway.Gene-expression profiling of DU145 prostate cancer cells stimulated with HGF revealed induction of a molecular signature associated with stem cells, characterized by up-regulation of CD49b, CD49f, CD44 and SOX9, and down-regulation of CD24 ('stem-like signature'). We confirmed the acquisition of a stem-like phenotype by quantitative PCR, FACS analysis and Western blotting. Further, HGF led to activation of the stem cell related Notch pathway by up-regulation of its ligands Jagged-1 and Delta-like 4. Small molecules SU11274 and PHA665752 targeting c-MET activity were both able to block the molecular and biologic effects of HGF. Knock-down of c-MET by shRNA infection resulted in significant reduction and delay of orthotopic tumour-formation in male NMRI mice. Immunohistochemical analysis in prostatectomies revealed significant enrichment of c-MET positive cells at the invasive front, and demonstrated co-expression of c-MET with stem-like markers CD49b and CD49f.In conclusion, activation of c-MET in prostate cancer cells induced a stem-like phenotype, indicating a dynamic relation between differentiated and stem-like cells in this malignancy. Its mediation of efficient tumour-formation in vivo and predominant receptor expression at the invasive front implicate that c-MET regulates tumour infiltration in surrounding tissues putatively by acquisition of a stem-like phenotype.""","""['Geert J L H van Leenders', 'Rajesh Sookhlall', 'Wilma J Teubel', 'Corrina M A de Ridder', 'Suzanne Reneman', 'Andrea Sacchetti', 'Kees J Vissers', 'Wytske van Weerden', 'Guido Jenster']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prostate cancer stem-like cells/cancer-initiating cells have an autocrine system of hepatocyte growth factor.', 'MET Signaling Mediates Intestinal Crypt-Villus Development, Regeneration, and Adenoma Formation and Is Promoted by Stem Cell CD44 Isoforms.', 'Increased expression of putative cancer stem cell markers in the bone marrow of prostate cancer patients is associated with bone metastasis progression.', 'C-Met pathway promotes self-renewal and tumorigenecity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma stem-like cell.', 'Hepatocyte growth factor/MET and CD44 in colorectal cancer: partners in tumorigenesis and therapy resistance.', 'Targeting c-Met in the treatment of urologic neoplasms: Current status and challenges.', 'Immunotargeting of Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Zinc finger protein‑like 1 is a novel neuroendocrine biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptomic Signature and Growth Factor Regulation of Castration-Tolerant Prostate Luminal Progenitor Cells.', 'Adipsin-Dependent Secretion of Hepatocyte Growth Factor Regulates the Adipocyte-Cancer Stem Cell Interaction.']"""

Patients and methods:   The study involved 100 individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer. Age, percentage of positive cores at transrectal ultrasound scan biopsy (P+), biopsy Gleason score (BGS), PRL, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were the continuous clinical variables. All patients had histologically proven carcinoma of the prostate and had not previously received hormonal manipulations. Correlation and multiple linear regression analysis of the the variables along the pituitary-testis-prostate cancer axis was performed. The prostate cancer population was clustered according to the PRL/P+ ratio into group A (4.20≤PRL/P+ ≤20), B (20<PRL/P+ ≤44) and C (44<PRL/P+≤157.83). Correlation, multiple linear regression and analysis of variance of the clustered population along the pituitary-testis-prostate cancer axis was computed.  Results:   At diagnosis of prostate cancer, pituitary hormones were significantly correlated to FT (PRL, FSH, LH) and to PSA (FSH, LH); also close to significance was the correlation of both PRL and LH to P+ (p=0.07).

We previously reported a large difference in NE expression in benign prostate tissue among men of different ethnicities; African-American men had significantly fewer NE cells compared to all other groups. This report describes NE expression in malignant prostate tissue.  Patients and methods:   Paraffin-embedded tissue from 180 men who underwent radical prostatectomy at the University of Southern California between 1983 and 2003 was stained using standard immunohistochemistry technique for chromogranin A (ChrA), serotonin (Ser) and synaptophysin (Syn). There were 39 specimens from African-American patients, 39 Asian, 57 Hispanic and 45 non-Hispanic White. Staining intensity and the percentage of cells positive were determined by the automated cellular imaging system. Results were analyzed by univariate and multivariate general linear regression models.  Results:   There were significant differences in staining intensity for all markers between ethnic groups in univariate analysis. NE expression, judged by ChrA intensity, was highest in Hispanic patients, compared to non-Hispanic Whites and African-Americans. A similar pattern was observed for Syn and Ser. In multivariate analysis, controlling for age, Gleason score, PSA and stage, the differences in ChrA, Syn and Ser remained highly significant. Hispanic men had higher ChrA expression levels than African-Americans and non-Hispanic Whites (p=0.0077 and 0.0038, respectively); the p-values for the comparison were both <0.0001 for Ser. Both Hispanic and Asian patients had higher intensity Ser expression than African-American and Non-Hispanic Whites patients, with all p-values <0.018.

Results:   We observed elevated RRs for Kaposi sarcoma (KS; RR = 199; P < 0.001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; RR = 15; P < 0.001), anal cancer (RR = 55; P < 0.001), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL; RR = 19; P < 0.001), melanoma (RR = 1.8; P = 0.001), and liver cancer (RR = 1.8; P = 0.013), a reduced RR for prostate cancer (RR = 0.8; P = 0.012), and no increased risk for oral cavity/pharynx (RR = 1.4; P = 0.14), lung (RR = 1.2; P = 0.15), or colorectal (RR = 0.9; P = 0.34) cancers. Lung and oral cavity/pharynx cancers were elevated for HIV-infected subjects in models adjusted only for demographics. KS, NHL, anal cancer, HL, and colorectal cancer had significant (P < 0.05) trends for increasing RRs with decreasing recent CD4.

Materials and methods:   Seventy-three patients who underwent preoperative MRI and radical prostatectomy were included in our study. A radiologist and pathologist located the dominant tumor on the MR images based on histopathologic correlation. For each dominant tumor, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value and quantitative DCE-MRI parameters (i.e., contrast agent transfer rate between blood and tissue [K(trans)], extravascular extracellular fractional volume [v(e)], contrast agent backflux rate constant [k(ep)], and blood plasma fractional volume on a voxel-by-voxel basis [v(p)]) were calculated and the Gleason score was recorded. The mean blood vessel count, mean vessel area fraction, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression of the dominant tumor were determined using CD31, CD34, and VEGF antibody stains. Spearman correlation analysis between MR and histopathologic parameters was conducted.  Results:   The mean tumor diameter was 15.2 mm (range, 5-28 mm). Of the 73 prostate cancer tumors, five (6.8%) had a Gleason score of 6, 46 (63%) had a Gleason score of 7, and 22 (30.1%) had a Gleason score of greater than 7. ADC values showed a moderate negative correlation with Gleason score (r = -0.376, p = 0.001) but did not correlate with tumor angiogenesis parameters. Quantitative DCE-MRI parameters did not show a significant correlation with Gleason score or VEGF expression (p > 0.05).

Although this regimen effectively regresses androgen-dependent disease, relapse often occurs in an androgen-independent manner and is associated with poor prognosis. Such castration-resistant prostate cancer represents a major clinical challenge, and the mechanisms underlying castration resistance are not fully understood. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key developmental process and has also been implicated in cancer metastasis and therapeutic resistance in recent years. However, the factors contributing to EMT in human cancers remain unclear. Here, we show that both normal mouse prostate tissue and human LuCaP35 prostate tumor explants display an EMT as well as increased stem cell-like features following androgen deprivation. Importantly, we observed similar changes in mesenchymal features in prostate tumors from patients treated with androgen-deprivation therapy. In addition, we have delineated a feedback loop involving the androgen receptor and the Zeb1 transcription factor that seems to mediate this transition. In summary, we show for the first time that androgen deprivation induces EMT in both normal prostate and prostate cancer, revealing a potentially important consequence of a standard-of-care treatment for prostate cancer.

In addition, there has been little work on strategies to reposition experimental cancer agents for testing in alternate settings that could shorten their clinical development time. Progress in each area has lagged, in part, because of the lack of systematic methods to define drug off-target effects (OTE) that might affect important cancer cell signaling pathways. In this study, we addressed this critical gap by developing an OTE-based method to repurpose drugs for cancer therapeutics, based on transcriptional responses made in cells before and after drug treatment. Specifically, we defined a new network component called cancer-signaling bridges (CSB) and integrated it with a Bayesian factor regression model (BFRM) to form a new hybrid method termed CSB-BFRM. Proof-of-concept studies were conducted in breast and prostate cancer cells and in promyelocytic leukemia cells. In each system, CSB-BFRM analysis could accurately predict clinical responses to more than 90% of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and more than 75% of experimental clinical drugs that were tested. Mechanistic investigation of OTEs for several high-ranking drug-dose pairs suggested repositioning opportunities for cancer therapy, based on the ability to enforce retinoblastoma-dependent repression of important E2F-dependent cell-cycle genes.

We have previously shown that treatment of primary murine osteoblasts with conditioned medium of the human osteolytic prostate cancer cell line PC-3 results in a rapid induction of chemokine expression, thereby providing further evidence for a molecular crosstalk between bone and tumor cells. The aim of our current study was to identify PC-3-derived molecules mediating this effect. Using Affymetrix Gene Chip hybridization followed by qRT-PCR we were able to confirm that the expression of chemokine-encoding genes is markedly induced in human primary osteoblasts following incubation with PC-3-conditioned medium. Since this induction was significantly affected upon alteration of p65-levels in PC-3 cells, we performed a second genome-wide expression analysis to identify p65-regulated cytokines, which were then tested for their ability to induce chemokine expression. Here we observed that interleukin-1β (IL-1B) did not only increase the expression of chemokines in osteoblasts, but also the phosphorylation of p65 and thereby its own expression.

However, in vivo tumor xenografts acquire resistance to resveratrol by an unknown mechanism, while mouse models of metabolic disorders respond more consistently to the compound. Here we demonstrate that castration-resistant human prostate cancer C4-2 cells are more sensitive to resveratrol-induced apoptosis than isogenic androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. The MEK inhibitor U0126 antagonized resveratrol-induced apoptosis in C4-2 cells, but this effect was not seen with other MEK inhibitors. U0126 was found to inhibit mitochondrial function and shift cells to aerobic glycolysis independently of MEK. Mitochondrial activity of U0126 arose through decomposition, producing both mitochondrial fluorescence and cyanide, a known inhibitor of complex IV. Applying U0126 mitochondrial inhibition to C4-2 cell apoptosis, we tested the possibility that glutamine supplementation of citric acid cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate may be involved. Suppression of the conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate antagonized resveratrol-induced death in C4-2 cells. A similar effect was also seen by reducing extracellular glutamine concentration in the culture medium, suggesting that resveratrol-induced death is dependent on glutamine metabolism, a process frequently dysregulated in cancer. Further work on resveratrol and metabolism in cancer is warranted to ascertain if the glutamine dependence has clinical implications.""","""['Michael R Freeman', 'Jayoung Kim', 'Michael P Lisanti', 'Dolores Di Vizio']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Resveratrol sensitizes androgen independent prostate cancer cells to death-receptor mediated apoptosis through multiple mechanisms.', 'Probing treatment response of glutaminolytic prostate cancer cells to natural drugs with hyperpolarized 5-(13) Cglutamine.', 'Differential effects of resveratrol and its naturally occurring methylether analogs on cell cycle and apoptosis in human androgen-responsive LNCaP cancer cells.', 'Regulation of cell death and survival by resveratrol: implications for cancer therapy.', 'Molecular mechanism of the chemopreventive effect of resveratrol.', 'Metabolomics Analysis Reveals Novel Targets of Chemosensitizing Polyphenols and Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Dual contribution of the mTOR pathway and of the metabolism of amino acids in prostate cancer.', 'Natural Compounds in Prostate Cancer Prevention and Treatment: Mechanisms of Action and Molecular Targets.', 'Transcriptional activation of glucose transporter 1 in orthodontic tooth movement-associated mechanical response.', ""Cancer Chemoprevention by Phytochemicals: Nature's Healing Touch.""]"""

For the study, time courses of ten patients were reconstructed and calculation of a biologically equivalent uniform dose (EUD) was performed using a formula derived from the linear quadratic model (α/β = 3 for prostate cancer cells). The calculated EUD values obtained for the actual patient treatments were then compared with theoretical EUD values for delivering the same physical dose distribution except that the whole target being irradiated continuously (e.g. large-field 'dose-bathing' type of delivery). For all the case, the EUDs for the actual treatment delivery were found to correlate strongly with the EUDs for the large-field delivery: a linear correlation coefficient of R² = 0.98 was obtained and the average EUD for the actual Cyberknife delivery was somewhat higher (5.0 ± 4.7%) than that for the large-field delivery. However, no statistical significance was detected between the two types of delivery (p = 0.21).

Patients and methods:   The Israel Cancer Registry was queried to identify patients with PCa and RCa diagnosed between 1982 and 2005. The age adjusted standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of RCa was defined as the ratio between the observed and expected (calculated) RCa cases and compared among the following: overall Israeli male population, patients with PCa treated with radiation therapy, patients with PCa treated surgically.

Results:   Of 29,593 men diagnosed with PCa, 2163 were treated with radiation therapy, 6762 were treated surgically and 20,068 patients were treated with either primary androgen deprivation therapy or offered watchful waiting. Of the entire study cohort, 194 (0.65%) patients were diagnosed with subsequent RCa. Compared to the overall male population and stratified by treatment modality, the risk of developing RCa after radiation therapy was significantly increased (SIR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.2-2.5), whereas it was not increased in those managed by surgery (SIR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.85-1.65).

Here, we report the findings of a U.K.-based case-control study to investigate circulating IGFs and IGFBPs in PSA-detected prostate cancer with regard to their potential associations with different cancer stages or grades. PSA testing was offered to 110,000 men aged 50 to 69 years from 2002 to 2009. Participants with an elevated level of PSA (≥3.0 ng/mL) underwent prostate biopsy and measurements of blood serum IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 obtained at recruitment. We found that serum levels of IGF-II (OR per SD increase: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.08-1.24; P(trend) < 0.001), IGFBP-2 (1.18; 1.06-1.31; P(trend) < 0.01) and IGFBP-3 (1.27; 1.19-1.36; P(trend) < 0.001), but not IGF-I (0.99; 0.93-1.04; P(trend) = 0.62), were associated with PSA-detected prostate cancer. After controlling for IGFBP-3, IGF-II was no longer associated (0.99; 0.91-1.08; P(trend) = 0.62) and IGF-I was inversely associated (0.85; 0.79-0.91; P(trend) < 0.001) with prostate cancer. In addition, no strong associations existed with cancer stage or grade. Overall, these findings suggest potentially important roles for circulating IGF-II, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 in PSA-detected prostate cancer, in support of recent in vitro evidence.

In a metastatic setting, the first line of treatment is the elimination of testosterone. However, such interventions are not curative because cancer cells evolve via multiple mechanisms to a castrate-resistant state, allowing progression to a lethal outcome. It is hypothesized that administration of antiandrogen therapy in an intermittent, as opposed to continuous, manner may bestow improved disease control with fewer treatment-related toxicities. The present study develops a biochemically motivated mathematical model of antiandrogen therapy that can be tested prospectively as a predictive tool. The model includes ""personalized"" parameters, which address the heterogeneity in the predicted course of the disease under various androgen-deprivation schedules. Model simulations are able to capture a variety of clinically observed outcomes for ""average"" patient data under different intermittent schedules. The model predicts that in the absence of a competitive advantage of androgen-dependent cancer cells over castration-resistant cancer cells, intermittent scheduling can lead to more rapid treatment failure as compared to continuous treatment. However, increasing a competitive advantage for hormone-sensitive cells swings the balance in favor of intermittent scheduling, delaying the acquisition of genetic or epigenetic alterations empowering androgen resistance. Given the near universal prevalence of antiandrogen treatment failure in the absence of competing mortality, such modeling has the potential of developing into a useful tool for incorporation into clinical research trials and ultimately as a prognostic tool for individual patients.""","""['Harsh Vardhan Jain', 'Steven K Clinton', 'Arvinder Bhinder', 'Avner Friedman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Alternative nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy for advanced prostate cancer that relapsed after initial maximum androgen blockade.', 'The change in the dihydrotestosterone level in the prostate before and after androgen deprivation therapy in connection with prostate cancer aggressiveness using the Gleason score.', 'Kinetics of serum androgen normalization and factors associated with testosterone reserve after limited androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.', 'First-line treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.

Guidelines have been developed not only for mammography but also for screening at virtually all major cancer sites, especially for prostate cancer, and most recently, with the preliminary results of the National Lung Screening Trial, for lung cancer.

We must also question whether our practice of summoning women to have mammograms, while providing men informed choice for prostate cancer screening, is consistent with a scientific analysis of the relative harms and benefits. We have spent a staggering amount of time and energy over the past several decades developing, discussing, and debating guidelines.

Although rare, heterophilic antibodies may produce false elevations in PSA that could prompt unnecessary therapy in men previously treated for prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of small, spurious PSA elevations, and the role of heterophilic antibodies.  Methods:   Phase I: all PSA tests drawn and measured between 27 October 2008 and 26 October 2010 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center were analyzed (n=17 133). Patients who had been treated for prostate cancer with PSA values that changed from undetectable to detectable were evaluated. Phase II: patients with a detectable PSA ≤0.5 ng ml(-1) measured between 24 October 2010 and 19 January 2011 were studied prospectively (n=1288). If any patient had a previously undetectable PSA value, their serum was tested for heterophilic antibody interference.  Results:   Phase I: 11 men had a spuriously elevated PSA after curative treatment for prostate cancer (0.3%). Mean time to PSA elevation was 3.4±5.5 years, and mean elevation in PSA was 0.33±0.28 ng ml(-1). Each patient's PSA was undetectable after being repeated, and no patient went on to unnecessary treatment. Phase II: 10 men had a newly detectable PSA, 9 of whom had a history of prostate cancer. Each tested negative for interfering heterophilic antibodies when their PSA test was repeated with a heterophilic antibody-blocking reagent.  Conclusions:   In a large cohort, we estimate the prevalence of spuriously elevated PSA values in our population to be 0.3%. No patient with a prostate cancer history was subjected to unnecessary diagnostic evaluation or treatment. On prospective evaluation of PSA conversion to low detectable levels, no patient had evidence of interfering heterophilic antibodies. When using PSA for post-treatment surveillance, it is crucial to confirm all concerning values and consider the presence of a spurious elevation in PSA if the value does not correlate with the clinical scenario.""","""['C B Anderson', 'A L Pyle', 'A Woodworth', 'M S Cookson', 'J A Smith Jr', 'D A Barocas']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Serum heterophile antibodies interfere with prostate specific antigen test and result in over treatment in a patient with prostate cancer.', 'New onset of heterophilic antibody interference in prostate-specific antigen measurement occurring during the period of post-prostatectomy prostate-specific antigen monitoring.', 'Spurious prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after radical prostatectomy: interference by human antimouse heterophile antibodies.', 'False Elevation of Prostate-Specific Antigen Caused by Heterophilic Antibody Interference after Radical Prostatectomy : A Case Report.', 'PSA and follow-up after treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Identification of and solution for false D-dimer results.', 'Falsely Undetectable Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Due to Presence of an Inhibitory Serum Factor: A Case Report and Review of Pertinent Literature.', 'What makes D-dimer assays suspicious-heterophilic antibodies?']"""

Methods:   In a cross-sectional study 60 subjects were enrolled (20 patients with BPH or with PC and 20 healthy volunteers). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and the percentage of T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) and NKT cells, as well as subsets of T lymphocytes [CD3(+)CD56(-)CD4(+), T(regs) (CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+)) and CD3(+)CD56(-)CD8(+)] and NK cells (CD3(-)CD56(+dim) and CD3(-)CD56(+bright)) were analysed by flow cytometry.

Highly positive correlation between the PSA value and the percentage of Tregs was found in PC patients.

Objective:   Determine whether baseline PSA levels predict long-term risk of PCa incidence and mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   We examined 4383 men aged 20-94 yr from the Danish general population in the prospective Copenhagen City Heart Study. PSA was measured in plasma samples obtained in 1981-1983.  Measurements:   PCa incidence and mortality as a function of baseline PSA was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots of cumulative incidence and competing risk subhazard ratios.  Results and limitations:   During 28 yr of follow-up, 170 men developed PCa, and 94 men died from PCa. Median follow-up was 18 yr (range: 0.5-28 yr). For PCa incidence, the subhazard ratio was 3.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-4.6) for a PSA level of 1.01-2.00 ng/ml, 6.8 (95% CI, 4.2-11) for PSA 2.01-3.00 ng/ml, 6.6 (95% CI, 3.4-13) for PSA 3.01-4.00 ng/ml, 16 (95% CI, 10.4-25) for PSA 4.01-10.00 ng/ml, and 57 (95% CI, 32-104) for PSA >10.00 ng/ml versus 0.01-1.00 ng/ml. For PCa mortality, corresponding subhazard ratios were 2.2 (95% CI, 1.3-3.9), 5.1 (95% CI, 2.8-9.0), 4.2 (95% CI, 1.8-10), 7.0 (95% CI, 3.8-14), and 14 (95% CI, 6.0-32). For men with PSA levels of 0.01-1.00 ng/ml, the absolute 10-yr risk of PCa was 0.6% for ages <45 yr, 0.7% for ages 45-49 yr, 1.1% for ages 50-54 yr, 1.2% for ages 55-59 yr, 1.3% for ages 60-64 yr, 1.1% for ages 65-69 yr, 1.3% for ages 70-74 yr, and 1.5% for ages ≥75 yr; corresponding values for PSA levels >10.00 ng/ml were 35%, 41%, 63%, 71%, 77%, 69%, 75%, and 88%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Stepwise increases in PSA at first date of testing predicted a 3-57-fold increased risk of PCa, a 2-16-fold increased risk of PCa mortality, and a 35-88% absolute 10-yr risk of PCa in men with PSA levels >10.00 ng/ml.

Objective:   Develop and validate an RC based on digital rectal examination (DRE) that circumvents the need for TRUS but still includes information on PV.  Design, setting, and participants:   For development of the DRE-based RC, we studied the original ERSPC Rotterdam RC population including 3624 men (885 PCa cases) and 2896 men (547 PCa cases) detected at first and repeat screening 4 yr later, respectively. A validation cohort consisted of 322 men, screened in 2010-2011 as participants in ERSPC Rotterdam.  Measurements:   Data on TRUS-assessed PV in the development cohorts were re-coded into three categories (25, 40, and 60 cm3) to assess the loss of information by categorization of volume information. New RCs including PSA, DRE, and PV categories (DRE-based RC) were developed for men with and without a previous negative biopsy to predict overall and clinically significant PCa (high-grade [HG] PCa) defined as T stage>T2b and/or Gleason score≥7. Predictive accuracy was quantified by the area under the receiver operating curve. We compared performance with the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) RC in the validation study.  Results and limitations:   Areas under the curve (AUC) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) alone, PSA and DRE, the DRE-based RC, and the original ERSPC RC to predict PCa at initial biopsy were 0.69, 0.73, 0.77, and 0.79, respectively. The corresponding AUCs for predicting HG PCa were higher (0.74, 0.82, 0.85, and 0.86). Similar results were seen in men previously biopsied and in the validation cohort. The DRE-based RC outperformed the PCPT RC (AUC 0.69 vs 0.59; p=0.0001) and a model based on PSA and DRE only (AUC 0.69 vs 0.63; p=0.0075) in the relatively small validation cohort. Further validation is required.  Conclusions:   An RC should contain volume estimates based either on TRUS or DRE.

Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is an elasticity imaging method that uses remotely generated, focused acoustic beams to probe tissue stiffness. A previous study on excised human prostates demonstrated ARFI images portray various prostatic structures and has the potential to guide prostate needle biopsy with improved sampling accuracy. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of ARFI imaging to portray internal structures and PCa in the human prostate in vivo. Custom ARFI imaging sequences were designed and implemented using a modified Siemens Antares™ scanner with a three-dimensional (3-D) wobbler, end-firing, trans-cavity transducer, EV9F4. Nineteen patients were consented and imaged immediately preceding surgical prostatectomy. Pathologies and anatomic structures were identified in histologic slides by a pathologist blinded to ARFI data and were then registered with structures found in ARFI images. The results demonstrated that when PCa is visible, it generally appears as bilaterally asymmetric stiff structures; benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) appears heterogeneous with a nodular texture; the verumontanum and ejaculatory ducts appears softer compared with surrounding tissue, which form a unique 'V' shape; and the boundary of the transitional zone (TZ) forms a stiff rim separating the TZ from the peripheral zone (PZ). These characteristic appearances of prostatic structures are consistent with those found in our previous study of prostate ARFI imaging on excised human prostates. Compared with the matched B-mode images, ARFI images, in general, portray prostate structures with higher contrast. With the end-firing transducer used for this study, ARFI depth penetration was limited to 22 mm. Image contrast and resolution were decreased as compared with the previous ex vivo study due to the small transducer aperture. Even with these limitations, this study suggests ARFI imaging holds promise for guidance of targeted prostate needle biopsy and focal therapy, as well as aiding assessment of changes during watchful waiting/active surveillance.""","""['Liang Zhai', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Wen-Chi Foo', 'Stephen Rosenzweig', 'Mark L Palmeri', 'John Madden', 'Kathryn R Nightingale']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Ultrasound Med Biol""","""['Characterizing stiffness of human prostates using acoustic radiation force.', 'Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging of human prostates ex vivo.', 'Identifying Clinically Significant Prostate Cancers using 3-D In\xa0Vivo Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging with Whole-Mount Histology Validation.', 'Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) for differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules--A meta-analysis.', 'Any Correlation Between Prostate Volume and Incidence of Prostate Cancer: A Review of Reported Data for the Last Thirty Years.', 'Dynamic patterning of microparticles with acoustic impulse control.', 'The role of diagnostic ultrasound imaging for patients with known prostate cancer within an active surveillance pathway: A systematic review.', 'Why Are Viscosity and Nonlinearity Bound to Make an Impact in Clinical Elastographic Diagnosis?', 'Anatomic and Molecular Imaging in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Elastography in Determination of Severity of Benign Prostate Hyperplasia.']"""

Methods and materials:   A single-institution database of men with prostate cancer treated with EBRT from 1999 to 2009 was reviewed. Thirteen men with HIV were identified and matched to 2 control patients according to age, race, T stage, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, RT dose, intensity-modulated RT vs. three-dimensional conformal RT, and whole-pelvis vs. prostate-only RT, for a total of 39 cases. The median follow-up time was 39 months (range, 3-110 months).  Results:   The 4-year biochemical failure (BF)-free survival rate was 87% in the HIV-positive group vs. 89% in the controls (p = 0.94). Pre- and post-RT viral loads were found to be predictive of BF (p = 0.04 and p = 0.04, respectively). No men with HIV died, whereas 2 in the control group died of causes unrelated to prostate cancer. Acute and chronic genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity were less in the HIV-positive patients than in controls (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.003, and p < 0.001, respectively). The HIV-positive men experienced an average decline in CD4 count of 193 cells/mm(3).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that men with HIV treated with EBRT have a similar risk of BF; however, high viral loads may contribute to an increased risk. This analysis supports that HIV-positive men with prostate cancer can be treated with definitive EBRT with similar disease control and toxicity outcomes as in the general population.""","""['Shannon Kahn', 'Ashesh Jani', 'Scott Edelman', 'Peter Rossi', 'Karen Godette', 'Jerome Landry', 'Cynthia Anderson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Improved biochemical disease-free survival of men younger than 60 years with prostate cancer treated with high dose conformal external beam radiotherapy.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Effect of whole pelvic radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and long-term androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Prostate adenocarcinoma and human immunodeficiency virus: report of three cases and review of the literature.', 'Management of prostate cancer in HIV-positive patients.', 'Prostate Cancer Outcomes in Patients Living With HIV/AIDS Treated With Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Clinical management and outcomes of HIV-positive patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer: a single institution experience.', 'Is There an Optimal Curative Option in HIV-Positive Men with Localized Prostate Cancer?

Methods and materials:   Patients with low-risk RMS were nonrandomly assigned to receive radiotherapy doses dependent on the completeness of surgical resection of the primary tumor (clinical group) and the presence of involved regional lymph nodes. After resection, most patients with microscopic residual and uninvolved nodes received 36 Gy, those with involved nodes received 41.4 to 50.4 Gy, and those with orbital primary tumors received 45 Gy.

One of these enzymes is microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) which metabolizes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAH, carcinogens found in cigarette smoke. The activity of this enzyme is affected by two polymorphisms, a substitution of Tyr113 by His in exon 3 and a substitution of His139 by Arg in exon 4. The aim of this study was to use a population-based case-control study to investigate whether or not such genetic polymorphisms in EPHX1 gene can modify the relationship between smoking status and the risk of developing prostate cancer. We used restriction fragment length polymorphism, or PCR-RFLP to determine EPHX1 genotypes in subjects comprising 194 patients with histologically verified prostate cancer and 305 healthy individuals as control. We found no overall association between prostate cancer risk and functional polymorphisms of EPHX1 gene in exon 3 and exon 4.

Biopsy undergrading is a persistent diagnostic dilemma with therapeutic relevance. We questioned whether Gleason grading combined with an established alternative grading system incorporating cytological parameters improves grading accuracy.  Methods:   Needle biopsies of 968 patients and the corresponding radical prostatectomy specimens were graded according to the Gleason grading system. In addition, all biopsies were graded according to the histo- and cytological grading system of Helpap. Biopsy Gleason grade, as well as the combined Gleason/Helpap grade, was compared with the final Gleason score and the pathological tumor-stage of the corresponding radical prostatectomy.  Results:   In biopsy Gleason score 6 cancers, an upgrading was seen in 76.0% of the patients (98/129), and 30.2% of them (39/129) showed non-organ confined disease. In combined biopsy Gleason 6/Helpap 2a patients, a final Gleason score of 6 was found in 22 out of 24 patients (91.7%, P<0.0001), and all 24 patients showed organ-confined disease (pT2a). In biopsy Gleason 6/Helpap 2b cancers, a final Gleason score of 6 was found in just 9 out of 105 patients (8.6%), and the rate of organ-confined disease decreased to 62.8% (66/105, P=0.0001). In higher Gleason grades, combined biopsy grading failed to show a diagnostic benefit over sole Gleason grading.

Materials and methods:   Between 2001 and 2009, all patients who had PCa detected in an initial 21-core TRUS biopsy scheme and were treated by a radical prostatectomy (RP) were included. Patients were sorted in 3 groups according to the diagnosis site: sextant (6 first cores; group 1), peripheral zone (12 first cores; group 2) or midline/transitional zone (after 21 cores; group 3). Demographics, pathological features in biopsy and RP specimens and follow-up after RP were analyzed. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was studied in the 3 groups.  Results:   During the study period, 443 patients were included. Among them, 67, 23.7 and 9.2% were, respectively, diagnosed in groups 1, 2 and 3. Among PCa diagnosed in midline/transition zone cores, 42% were intermediate or high risk.

B-cell translocation gene 2 (Btg2) regulates the G1/S transition phases of the cell cycle. N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) is a differentiation-inducing gene upregulated by hypoxia. We evaluated the molecular mechanisms of L-mimosine on cell cycle modulation in PC-3 and LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells. The effect of L-mimosine on cell proliferation of prostate carcinoma cells was determined by the [3H]thymidine incorporation and flow cytometry assays. L-Mimosine arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase in PC-3 cells and at the S phase in LNCaP cells, thus attenuating cell proliferation. Immunoblot assays indicated that hypoxia and L-mimosine stabilized hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and induced Btg2 and Ndrg1 protein expression, but downregulated protein levels of cyclin A in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells. L-Mimosine treatment decreased cyclin D1 protein in PC-3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells. Dimethyloxalylglycine, a pan-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, also induced Btg2 and Ndrg1 protein expression in LNCaP cells. The transient gene expression assay revealed that L-mimosine treatment or cotransfection with HIF-1α expression vector enhanced the promoter activities of Btg2 and Ndrg1 genes. Knockdown of HIF-1α attenuated the increasing protein levels of both Btg2 and Ndrg1 by hypoxia or L-mimosine in LNCaP cells. Our results indicated that hypoxia and L-mimosine modulated Btg2 and Ndrg1 at the transcriptional level, which is dependent on HIF-1α.

In this article, we propose six quantitative quality control measures, covering internal homogeneity of coexpression structure among studies, external consistency of coexpression pattern with pathway database, and accuracy and consistency of differentially expressed gene detection or enriched pathway identification. Each quality control index is defined as the minus log transformed P values from formal hypothesis testing. Principal component analysis biplots and a standardized mean rank are applied to assist visualization and decision. We applied the proposed method to 4 large-scale examples, combining 7 brain cancer, 9 prostate cancer, 8 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 17 major depressive disorder studies, respectively.

Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and reporter assay show that the EGR-1 directly binds to the human IGF-1R gene and triggers the target gene expression.

The motion increased as a function of elapsed time for displacements >2-8 mm for the non-ERB group and >2-4 mm for the ERB group (p < 0.05). The percentage time distributions between the two groups were significantly different for motion >5 mm (p < 0.05). The 3D symmetrical internal margin (IM) can be reduced from 5 to 3 mm (40% reduction), whereas the asymmetrical IM can be reduced from 3 to 2 mm (33% reduction) in cranial, caudal, anterior, and posterior for 6 min of treatment, when ERB is used. Beyond 6 min, the symmetrical 3D and asymmetrical cranial, caudal, anterior, and posterior IMs can be reduced from 9, 4, 7, 7, and 8 to 5, 2, 5, 3, and 4 mm, respectively (up to 57% reduction).  Conclusion:   The percentage of time that the prostate was displaced in any direction was less in the ERB group for almost all magnitudes of motion considered. The directional analysis shows that the ERB reduced IMs in almost all directions, especially the anterior-posterior direction.""","""['Ken Kang-Hsin Wang', 'Neha Vapiwala', 'Curtiland Deville', 'John P Plastaras', 'Ryan Scheuermann', 'Haibo Lin', 'Voika Bar Ad', 'Zelig Tochner', 'Stefan Both']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['An endorectal balloon reduces intrafraction prostate motion during radiotherapy.', 'A comparison between hydrogel spacer and endorectal balloon: An analysis of intrafraction prostate motion during proton therapy.', 'Real-time study of prostate intrafraction motion during external beam radiotherapy with daily endorectal balloon.', 'Day-to-day reproducibility of prostate intrafraction motion assessed by multiple kV and MV imaging of implanted markers during treatment.', 'Organ motion and its management.', 'Reducing the margin in prostate radiotherapy: optimizing radiotherapy with a general-purpose linear accelerator using an in-house position monitoring system.', 'Clinical effects of rectal retractor application in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Spatial and dosimetric evaluation of residual distortions of prostate and seminal vesicle bed after image-guided definitive and postoperative radiotherapy of prostate cancer with endorectal balloon.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices in managing prostate motion: a\xa0systematic review.', 'Evaluation of an Open Source Registration Package for Automatic Contour Propagation in Online Adaptive Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy of Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this study we used resonance frequency shifts induced by mass-amplifying gold nanoparticles to detect a hybridization sandwich bound to functionalized nanowires. We selected PCA3 RNA as a marker for prostate cancer, optimized antisense binding sites, and defined conditions allowing single nucleotide mismatch discrimination, and used a hybrid resonator integration scheme, which combines elements of top-down fabrication with strengths of bottom-up fabrication, with a view to enable multiplexed sensing. Bound mass calculated from frequency shifts matched mass estimated by counting gold nanoparticles.

As a result, multiple series have advocated the use of more intensive prophylactic antibiotic regimens to augment the effect of the widely used fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for TRUSBx. The present study compares the cost-effectiveness fluoroquinolone prophylaxis to more intensive prophylactic antibiotic regimens, which is an important consideration for any antibiotic regimen used on a wide-scale for TRUSBx prophylaxis.  Objective:   To compare the cost-effectiveness of fluoroquinolones vs intensive antibiotic regimens for transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSBx) prophylaxis.  Patients and methods:   Risk of hospital admission for infectious complications after TRUSBx was determined from published data. The average cost of hospital admission due to post-biopsy infection was determined from patients admitted to our University hospital ≤1 week of TRUSBx. A decision tree analysis was created to compare cost-effectiveness of standard vs intensive antibiotic prophylactic regimens based on varying risk of infection, cost, and effectiveness of the intensive antibiotic regimen.  Results:   Baseline assumption included cost of TRUSBx ($559), admission rate (1%), average cost of admission ($5900) and cost of standard and intensive antibiotic regimens of $1 and $33, respectively. Assuming a 50% risk reduction in admission rates with intensive antibiotics, the standard regimen was slightly less costly with average cost of $619 vs $622, but was associated with twice as many infections. Sensitivity analyses found that a 1.1% risk of admission for quinolone-resistant infections or a 54% risk reduction attributed to the more intensive antibiotic regimen will result in cost-equivalence for the two regimens. Three-way sensitivity analyses showed that small increases in probability of admission using the standard antibiotics or greater risk reduction using the intensive regimen result in the intensive prophylactic regimen becoming substantially more cost-effectiveness even at higher costs.  Conclusion:   As the risk of admission for infectious complications due to TRUSBx increases, use of an intensive prophylactic antibiotic regimen becomes significantly more cost-effective than current standard antibiotic prophylaxis.""","""['Mehrad Adibi', 'Margaret S Pearle', 'Yair Lotan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Cost-effectiveness of standard vs intensive antibiotic regimens for transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy prophylaxis.', 'Reduction in hospital admission rates due to post-prostate biopsy infections after augmenting standard antibiotic prophylaxis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of standard vs intensive antibiotic regimens for transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy prophylaxis.', 'Ciprofloxacin resistance in the faecal carriage of patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'The role of targeted prophylactic antimicrobial therapy before transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy in reducing infection rates: a systematic review.', 'The use of prophylactic antibiotics in ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy.', 'Comparison of amikacin with fosfomycin as an add-on to ciprofloxacin for antibiotic prophylaxis in transrectal prostate biopsy: A single-center retrospective study.', 'Association of Warmer Weather and Infectious Complications Following Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Role of Prophylactic Antibiotics in Transperineal Prostate Biopsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'All change in the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway.', '18F-Choline PET/mpMRI for Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: Part 2.

Nomograms are based on large patient population. Their applicability should be externally validated. Among 747 brachytherapy patients we evaluated two Kattan nonograms and conclude that they have limited value to predict PSA-free survival.  Objective:   To validate and compare the preoperative and postoperative Kattan prediction nonograms for prostate cancer recurrence after brachytherapy.  Patients and methods:   Patients (n= 747) treated with (125) I-brachytherapy were evaluated. Both nomograms were used to calculate the prediction of 5-year biochemical-freedom from failure (BFFF) based on clinical stage, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, receipt of androgen deprivation therapy and the post-implant dosimetry variable D90 (values of the minimal dose received by 90% of the prostate volume). The predicted values using the Kattan nomograms and the observed values were compared. Predictive accuracy was determined using the concordance index.  Results:   The 5-year BFFF probability was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92-96%) for the modified American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) definition and 97% (95% CI, 95-98%) for the Phoenix definition using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The predicted values of BFFF using both Kattan nomograms were lower than the observed rates in our cohort. The concordance index values were 0.51 and 0.52 for preoperative and postoperative nomograms, respectively. Concordance correlation coefficient between the two nomograms was 0.15.  Conclusions:   In our population, the 5-year BFFF outcomes rates were superior to nomogram predictions. Neither nomogram predicted outcomes after (125) I-brachytherapy in this non-US cohort. The postoperative nomogram was also a poor predictor, although it included D90 dosimetry values, as a variable of treatment quality.

Materials and methods:   The cohort included 127,236 men from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) database who were treated with RP between 1988 and 2003. Pathological stage was organ confined in 38,684 men (30%), nonorgan confined in 41,806 (33%) and unstaged in 46,746 (37%). Gleason score 7 or less was present in 100,816 men (79%) and Gleason score 8 or greater in 26,420 (21%). Patients were stratified into groups, including group 1—71,106 (59%) with Gleason score 7 or less, organ confined, group 2—23,063 (19%) with Gleason score 7 or less, nonorgan confined, group 3—13,660 (12%) with Gleason score 8 or greater, organ confined and group 4—12,158 (10%) with Gleason score 8 or greater, nonorgan confined tumors. Median followup was 7.2 years (range 0 to 19). Hazard was estimated from a Cox regression model including patient age, race, stage and grade.  Results:   The overall annual prostate cancer specific mortality hazard rate was 0.4%, 0.7% and 1% 5, 10 and 15 years after radical prostatectomy, respectively. Between 5 and 15 years after radical prostatectomy the hazard increased annually from 0.2% to 0.5% in group 1, from 0.5% to 1.2% in group 2, from 0.7% to 1.6% in group 3 and from 1.5% to 3.7% in group 4.

Materials and methods:   Data from 1,299 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy performed by a single surgeon from January 2008 to June 2010 were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. Patients were categorized according to whether they regained continence (no pad and no urinary leakage) within 3 months and variables were then compared. A self-administered validated questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) was used for assessment of continence status and time to recovery.  Results:   Within 3 months after surgery 86.3% of patients (1,121/1,299) had recovered continence. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that only age (p <0.001, hazard ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99) and performance of a nerve sparing procedure were independent predictors. After adjusting for age, the hazard ratio was 1.61 (95% CI 1.25-2.07, p <0.001) for partial nerve sparing and 1.44 (1.13-1.83, p = 0.003) for bilateral nerve sparing compared to the nonnerve sparing group.

For several reasons, it is an ideal candidate disease for intervention with dietary botanical antioxidants. Indeed, many botanical antioxidants are showing promise for chemoprevention of PCa. Here, we determined the effect of an antioxidant butein (3,4,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalone) on cell growth, apoptosis, and signaling pathways in human PCa cells in-vitro and on tumor growth in athymic nude mice.  Results:   Treatment with butein (10-30 μM; 48 h) caused a decrease in viability of PCa cells but had only a minimal effect on normal prostate epithelial cells. In butein-treated cells, there was a marked decrease in the protein expression of cyclins D1, D2, and E and cdks 2, 4, and 6 with concomitant induction of WAF1/p21 and KIP1/p27. Treatment of cells with butein caused inhibition of (i) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85 and p110), (ii) phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser(473) and Thr(308), (iii) nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and IκB kinaseα, (iv) degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα, (v) NF-κB DNA-binding activity, (vi) induction of apoptosis, and (vii) Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage with activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9. Pretreatment of cells with caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) blocked butein-induced activation of caspases. In athymic nude mice implanted with human PCa cells, butein caused a significant inhibition of tumor growth with a decrease in the serum prostate-specific antigen levels.  Innovation:   For the first time, we have shown that butein caused inhibition of prostate tumor growth in-vivo.  Conclusion:   We suggest that butein could be developed as an agent against PCa.

It is hoped that these inhibitors will have widespread clinical impact in oncology because mTOR is a major downstream effector of PI3K signaling, one of the most frequently activated pathways in cancer. In cells, mTOR is the catalytic core subunit of two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are defined by unique mTOR-interacting proteins and have unique functions downstream of PI3K. Two classes of mTOR inhibitors are currently being evaluated as cancer therapeutics: rapamycin and its analogs, which partially inhibit mTORC1 and in some cell types mTORC2, and the recently described ATP-competitive inhibitors, which inhibit the kinase activity of both complexes. Although small molecules that selectively target mTORC2 do not yet exist, experiments using mouse genetics suggest that a theoretical mTORC2 inhibitor may have significant therapeutic value.

Experimental design:   Docetaxel was administered over 1 h at doses of 55, 70, and 75 mg/m(2). 17-AAG was administered over 1-2 h, following the completion of the docetaxel infusion, at escalating doses ranging from 80 to 650 mg/m(2) in 12 patient cohorts. Serum was collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies during cycle 1. Docetaxel, 17-AAG, and 17-AG levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Biologic effects of 17-AAG were monitored in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by immunoblot.  Results:   Forty-nine patients received docetaxel and 17-AAG. The most common all-cause grade 3 and 4 toxicities were leukopenia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia. An MTD was not defined; however, three dose-limiting toxicities were observed, including 2 incidences of neutropenic fever and 1 of junctional bradycardia. Dose escalation was halted at docetaxel 75 mg/m(2)-17-AAG 650 mg/m(2) due to delayed toxicities attributed to patient intolerance of the DMSO-based 17-AAG formulation. Of 46 evaluable patients, 1 patient with lung cancer experienced a partial response. Minor responses were observed in patients with lung, prostate, melanoma, and bladder cancers. A correlation between reduced docetaxel clearance and 17-AAG dose level was observed.  Conclusions:   The combination of docetaxel and 17-AAG was well tolerated in adult patients with solid tumors, although patient intolerance to the DMSO formulation precluded further dose escalation.

However, how metastatic tumor cells become dormant and how and why tumors recur in target organs are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that BMP7 (bone morphogenetic protein 7) secreted from bone stromal cells induces senescence in prostate cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21, and the metastasis suppressor gene, NDRG1 (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1). This effect of BMP7 depended on BMPR2 (BMP receptor 2), and BMPR2 expression inversely correlated with recurrence and bone metastasis in prostate cancer patients. Importantly, this BMP7-induced senescence in CSCs was reversible upon withdrawal of BMP7. Furthermore, treatment of mice with BMP7 significantly suppressed the growth of CSCs in bone, whereas the withdrawal of BMP7 restarted growth of these cells. These results suggest that the BMP7-BMPR2-p38-NDRG1 axis plays a critical role in dormancy and recurrence of prostate CSCs in bone and suggest a potential therapeutic utility of BMP7 for recurrent metastatic disease.""","""['Aya Kobayashi', 'Hiroshi Okuda', 'Fei Xing', 'Puspa R Pandey', 'Misako Watabe', 'Shigeru Hirota', 'Sudha K Pai', 'Wen Liu', 'Koji Fukuda', 'Christopher Chambers', 'Andrew Wilber', 'Kounosuke Watabe']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Exp Med""","""['Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) Mediates Metastatic Dormancy of Prostate Cancer in Bone.', 'BMP7, a putative regulator of epithelial homeostasis in the human prostate, is a potent inhibitor of prostate cancer bone metastasis in vivo.', 'Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) and BMP7 inhibit estrogen-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells by suppressing p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins and its receptors; therapeutic targets in cancer progression and bone metastasis?', 'Osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer cells: a hypothesis supporting the predilection of prostate cancer metastasis and growth in the bone environment.', 'The covert symphony: cellular and molecular accomplices in breast cancer metastasis.', 'Tumor dormancy is closely related to prognosis prediction and tumor immunity in neuroblastoma.', 'Cellular Dormancy in Cancer: Mechanisms and Potential Targeting Strategies.', 'Dormancy, stemness, and therapy resistance: interconnected players in cancer evolution.', 'The genomic regulation of metastatic dormancy.']"""

Patients were classified on the basis of their mRNA microarray signature profiles indicating embryonic stem cell expression patterns (stemness), inactivation of the tumor suppressors p53 and PTEN, activation of several oncogenic pathways, and the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. Unsupervised clustering identified a subset of tumors manifesting stem-like signatures together with p53 and PTEN inactivation, which had very poor survival outcome, a second group with intermediate survival outcome, characterized by the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, and three groups with benign outcome. The stratification was validated on a second independent dataset of 150 tumor and metastatic samples from a clinical cohort at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

The software ranks pathway-representing gene/protein sets in terms of the differences of the variance in the within-pathway expression levels across different biological conditions.

Results:   Of a total of 87 cases, 82 (94.2%) patients had suspicious lesion(s) on their MRI. Of these 82 patients, 46 (56.0%) patients had prostate cancer (PCA) as determined by the biopsy. The patients with PCA showed a significantly higher incidence of having suspicious lesion(s) (the anterior or apex) on MRI than the patients without PCA (P<0.05).

These problems are minimized when the Ca(2+) indicators are encapsulated inside porous and inert polyacrylamide nanoparticles. We present PEBBLE nanosensors encapsulated with rhodamine-based Ca(2+) fluorescence indicators. The rhod-2-containing PEBBLEs presented here show a stable sensing range at near-neutral pH (pH 6-9). Because of the protection of the PEBBLE matrix, the interference of protein-nonspecific binding to the indicator is minimal. The rhod-2 PEBBLEs give a nanomolar dynamic sensing range for both in-solution (K(d) = 478 nM) and intracellular (K(d) = 293 nM) measurements. These nanosensors are useful quantitative tools for the measurement and imaging of the cytosolic nanomolar free Ca(2+) levels.""","""['Di Si', 'Tamir Epstein', 'Yong-Eun Koo Lee', 'Raoul Kopelman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Generalized ratiometric fluorescence nanosensors based on carbon dots and an advanced chemometric model.', 'Optical nanosensors for chemical analysis inside single living cells. 2.

However, the sensitivity of such sensors to humidity is problematic, limiting their reliable and reproducible application in real-world environmental conditions. In this work, we employed a compensation method to explore the effect of humidity on a single MCNP chemiresistor as well as on an array of MCNP sensors used to analyze either synthetic or real-world samples. We show that an array of MCNP chemiresistors is able to precisely detect and estimate subtle concentrations of (mixtures of) volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under variable backgrounds of 2-83% relative humidity (RH) only after humidity compensation. Humidity effects were also tested in two clinical trials aimed at detecting prostate cancer and breast cancer through exhaled breath analysis. Analysis of the results showed improved cancer detection capabilities as a result of RH compensation, though less substantial than the impact of RH compensation on synthetic samples. This outcome is attributed to one - or a combination - of the following effects: (i) the RH variance was smaller in the breath samples than that in the synthetic samples; (ii) the VOC composition in the breath samples is less controlled than the synthetic samples; and (iii) the responses to small polar VOCs and water are not necessarily additive in breath samples. Ultimately, the results presented here could assist the development of a cost-effective, low-power method for widespread detection of VOCs in real-world applications, such as breath analysis, as well as for environmental, security, and food applications.""","""['Gady Konvalina', 'Hossam Haick']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Comparison of four identical electronic noses and three measurement set-ups.', 'Experimental setup and analytical methods for the non-invasive determination of volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde and NOx in exhaled human breath.', 'Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath of patients with breast cancer in a clinical setting.', 'Detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from exhaled breath as noninvasive methods for cancer diagnosis.', 'Advances in chemical sensing technologies for VOCs in breath for security/threat assessment, illicit drug detection, and human trafficking activity.', 'Breath Volatile Organic Compounds in Surveillance of Gastric Cancer Patients following Radical Surgical Management.', 'Heteronanostructural metal oxide-based gas microsensors.', 'Volatile Organic Compounds Analysis as a Potential Novel Screening Tool for Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Breath Sensor Technology for the Use in Mechanical Lung Ventilation Equipment for Monitoring Critically Ill Patients.', 'Breath Analysis: A Promising Tool for Disease Diagnosis-The Role of Sensors.']"""

The LSPR responses of single Au nanoparticles were obtained by tracking the wavelength shift of the corresponding resonant Rayleigh light scattering spectra via dark-field microspectroscopy. Using prostate specific antigen as a model, an LSPR lambda max shift of about 2.75 nm was recorded by a primary immunoresponse corresponding to 0.1 pg/mL of the target antigen.

J591, a monoclonal antibody against prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), was conjugated to the DSPE-SIPPs (J591-DSPE-SIPPs), and specific targeting of J591-DSPE-SIPPs to PSMA-expressing human prostate cancer cell lines was demonstrated using fluorescence confocal microscopy. The transverse relaxivity of the DSPE-SIPPs, measured at 4.7 Tesla, was 300.6 ± 8.5 s(-1) mM(-1), which is 13-fold better than commercially available SPIONs (23.8 ± 6.9 s(-1) mM(-1)) and ~3-fold better than reported relaxivities for Feridex(®) and Resovist(®).

Here, we carried out a systematic, genome-wide analysis of the functional significance of 615 epigenetic proteins in prostate cancer (PrCa) cells. We used the high-content cell-spot microarray technology and siRNA silencing of PrCa cell lines for functional screening of cell proliferation, survival, androgen receptor (AR) expression, histone methylation and acetylation. Our study highlights subsets of epigenetic enzymes influencing different cancer cell phenotypes. Plant homeo domain (PHD) finger proteins have a key role in cell survival and histone methylation, whereas histone deacetylases were primarily involved in regulating AR expression. In contrast, JumonjiC-domain (JmjC) containing histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) mainly had an impact on cell proliferation. Our results show that the KDMs JARID1B, PHF8, KDM3A, KDM3B and KDM4A were highly expressed in clinical PrCa samples. The PHD-finger protein 8 (PHF8), a transcriptional coactivator with both PHD- and JmjC-domains, was moderately to strongly expressed in 80% of clinical PrCa samples, whereas 76% of normal and benign samples were negative or only showed weak PHF8 expression. Strong PHF8 expression correlated significantly with high Gleason grade and was borderline significant for poor prognosis. The results of functional PHF8 knockdown implicate a role in cell migration and invasion, as shown by cell motility and 3-D invasion assays.

Spatial and temporal regulation of integrin traffic is critical for cell migration and cytokinesis. Impaired integrin endocytosis, because of the loss of Rab21 small GTPase or mutations in the integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tail, induces failure of cytokinesis in vitro. Here, we describe that repeatedly failed cytokinesis, because of impaired traffic, is sufficient to trigger the generation of aneuploid cells, which display characteristics of oncogenic transformation in vitro and are tumorigenic in vivo. Furthermore, in an in vivo mouse xenograft model, non-transformed cells with impaired integrin traffic formed tumors with a long latency. More detailed investigation of these tumors revealed that the tumor cells were aneuploid. Therefore, abnormal integrin traffic was linked with generation of aneuploidy and cell transformation also in vivo. In human prostate and ovarian cancer samples, downregulation of Rab21 correlates with increased malignancy. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that long-term depletion of Rab21 is sufficient to induce chromosome number aberrations in normal human epithelial cells.

The aim of this study was to analyse disease data to examine this issue further.  Methods:   We linked the Danish National Diabetes Register and Cancer Registry and performed a cohort analysis of the entire Danish population by diabetes status, duration of diabetes and insulin use, comparing cancer incidence rates in diabetic patients with the non-diabetic population for the 15 year period 1995-2009, using Poisson regression with natural splines to describe the variation by duration.  Results:   We found 20,032 cancer cases among patients not using insulin and 2,794 cancer cases among diabetic patients using insulin. The cancer incidence rate ratio among non-insulin users relative to the non-diabetic population decreased from over 2 at diagnosis to 1.15 after 2 years of diabetes duration. The cancer incidence rate ratio was higher among patients using insulin, decreasing from 5 at the start of insulin treatment to about 1.3 [corrected] after 5 years of insulin use. Among non-insulin users, cancers of the stomach, colorectum, liver, pancreas, lung, corpus uteri, kidney and brain, and lymphomas were elevated. Among insulin users the rate ratio of prostate cancer was decreasing by duration whereas we found higher risk of cancer of the stomach, lung, liver, pancreas and kidney. Breast cancer incidence rates were not affected by either diabetes or insulin use.  Conclusions:   The observed duration effects suggest that both increased surveillance for cancer in the first years after diagnosis of diabetes, and reverse causation, where undiagnosed cancers increase the likelihood of diabetes diagnosis, play a role. For longer durations, a combination of common causes for diabetes and cancer, as well as the effects of diabetes and insulin exposure per se, may play a role in the association between diabetes and some cancers.""","""['B Carstensen', 'D R Witte', 'S Friis']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Diabetologia""","""['Diabetes and risk of cancer incidence: results from a population-based cohort study in northern Italy.', 'Use of insulin glargine and cancer incidence in Scotland: a study from the Scottish Diabetes Research Network Epidemiology Group.', 'Metformin use and prostate cancer risk.', 'Use of insulin and insulin analogs and risk of cancer - systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'CARING (CAncer Risk and INsulin analoGues): the association of diabetes mellitus and cancer risk with focus on possible determinants - a systematic review and a meta-analysis.', 'Potential preventive properties of GLP-1 receptor agonists against prostate cancer: a nationwide cohort study.', 'Association of type 2 diabetes mellitus with lung cancer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.', 'Cancer of the Liver and its Relationship with Diabetes mellitus.', 'Duration of diabetes mellitus and risk of kidney and bladder cancer: a longitudinal nationwide cohort study.', 'The role of insulin and incretin-based drugs in biliary tract cancer: epidemiological and experimental evidence.']"""

Cys is primarily localized extracellularly, whereas GSH is present mostly inside the cell. We hypothesized that extra- or intracellular redox state alterations differentially regulate cell invasion in PC3 prostate carcinoma cells versus PrEC normal prostate epithelial cells. Cells were exposed to media with calculated Cys/CySS redox potentials (E(h)CySS) ranging from -60 to -180mV. After 3h exposure to a reducing extracellular redox state (E(h)CySS=-180mV), matrix metalloprotease (MMP), gelatinase, and NADPH oxidase activities increased, correlating with increases in cell invasion, cell migration, and extracellular hydrogen peroxide levels in PC3 cells but not PrECs. Knockdown of NADPH oxidase or MMP with silencing RNAs during cultivation with E(h)CySS=-180mV medium significantly decreased PC3 cell invasion. Modulation of extra- and intracellular redox states by exposure of PC3 cells to Cys/CySS-free medium (approx E(h)CySS=-87mV) containing 500μMN-acetylcysteine resulted in a more reducing intracellular redox state and a significant decrease in cell invasive ability. The decrease in PC3 cell invasion induced by these conditions correlated with a decrease in MMP activity. Our studies demonstrated that an extracellular redox state that was more reducing than a physiologic microenvironment redox state increased PC3 cancer cell invasive ability, whereas an intracellular redox environmental that was more reducing than an intracellular physiologic redox state inhibited PC3 cell invasive ability.""","""['Luksana Chaiswing', 'Weixiong Zhong', 'Yongliang Liang', 'Dean P Jones', 'Terry D Oberley']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Control of extracellular cysteine/cystine redox state by HT-29 cells is independent of cellular glutathione.', 'Oxidation of extracellular cysteine/cystine redox state in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.', 'Oxidation of plasma cysteine/cystine redox state in endotoxin-induced lung injury.', 'Cysteine/cystine redox signaling in cardiovascular disease.', 'Extracellular redox state: refining the definition of oxidative stress in aging.', 'The Association of Polymorphisms in Genes Encoding Antioxidant Enzymes GPX1 (rs1050450), SOD2 (rs4880) and Transcriptional Factor Nrf2 (rs6721961) with the Risk and Development of Prostate Cancer.', 'PGC1 alpha coactivates ERG fusion to drive antioxidant target genes under metabolic stress.', 'Effect of Supplementing Different Levels of L-Glutamine on Holstein Calves during Weaning.', 'GPI-80 Augments NF-κB Activation in Tumor Cells.', 'Nitroxyl Radical as a Theranostic Contrast Agent in Magnetic Resonance Redox Imaging.']"""

Patients:   Twenty patients undergoing elective open radical retro pubic prostatectomy (RRP).  Methods:   Cohort observational study. Ten patients receiving 20 mg/kg of delta-ALA orally prior to surgery (delta-ALA) and 10 patients undergoing RRP without the application of delta-ALA served as a retrospectively matched cohort (CONTROL).  Measurements:   Changes in heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and functional hemodynamic parameters were assessed by electrocardiogram, non-invasive and invasive blood pressure monitoring plus transcardiopulmonary thermodilution.  Results:   Patients of both groups did not differ in means of age, body mass index, or ASA classification. During surgery, HR and MAP did not differ significantly between both groups. Also, the amount of IV crystalloids and colloids did not differ significantly. In contrast, the amount of vasopressor necessary to maintain MAP within the target range of 70-90 mmHg was significantly higher in delta-ALA when compared to CONTROL (0.08 ± 0.04 μg/kg/min (delta-ALA) vs. 0.03 ± 0.02 μg/kg/min (CONTROL); P < 0.01). Immediately after surgery, patients of delta-ALA showed a significantly higher heart rate (82 ± 18 min(-1) vs. 67 ± 9 min(-1); P < 0.05) compared to patients of CONTROL. Cardiac index, global end-diastolic volume index, and extravascular lung water index were significantly higher after surgery, when compared to baseline values (P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Orally administered delta-ALA prior to open radical prostatectomy induces hemodynamic instability in the perioperative period requiring vasopressor support.

Materials and methods:   388 patients from the multicentre MRC-RT01 prostate conformal radiotherapy trial (ISRCTN 47772397) were used to derive independent Lyman Kutcher Burman model (LKB) parameters for five late rectal toxicity endpoints: rectal bleeding, proctitis, stool frequency, loose stools and rectal urgency. The parameters were derived using maximum likelihood estimation. Bootstrap and leave-one-out methods were employed to test the generalisability of the results for use in a general population.  Results:   A consistent pattern of increasing value of TD50(1) for Grade 2 toxicity only compared to Grades 1 and 2 toxicity was observed for all endpoints. Parameter values varied between endpoints (particularly for the volume parameter n). TD50(1), m and n were 68.5 Gy (95% CI)(66.8-70.8), 0.15 (0.13-0.17) and 0.13 (0.10-0.17), respectively, for G2 rectal bleeding. Bootstrap and leave-one-out results showed that the rectal bleeding and proctitis parameter fits were extremely robust.

Recently, we reported an adjacent polymorphism (SNP285G > C). SNP285C antagonises the effect of SNP309G by reducing Sp1 binding and lowers the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.  Methods:   We assessed the potential gender specificity in the effect of this polymorphism. We performed in silico predictions of transcription factor binding sites in the MDM2 promoter and analysed MDM2 SNP285 and SNP309 status in two independent cohorts of endometrial (n = 438 and 472) and 666 prostatic cancer patients, and compared to 3.140 healthy controls.  Results:   We identified three oestrogen-receptor binding elements (EREs) within the MDM2 intronic promoter, one of which overlapping the Sp1 binding-site harbouring SNP285. The SNP285C/309G haplotype was associated with a reduced Odds Ratio (OR) for endometrial cancer (OR1: 0.55; Confidence Interval (CI) 0.32-0.97; OR2: 0.65; CI 0.40-1.08, especially for ER+ tumours; OR: 0.48; CI 0.28-0.87) but not for prostatic cancer among SNP309TG heterozygotes. SNP309G (SNP309TG or SNP309GG genotype) was associated with a moderately increased risk of endometrial cancer (OR: 1.17; CI 1.00-1.37) compared to SNP309TT homozygotes.

Our aim was to realize the first detailed analysis of orgasm in patients treated by 125 I permanent prostate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   In a series of 270 sexually active men treated by prostate brachytherapy (125I permanent implantation), 241 (89%), mean age of 65 (43-80), participated in a mailed survey about sexual function after a mean time of 36 months (9-70). Erectile and ejaculatory functions and orgasm were explored using a mailed questionnaire. Two questions focused on orgasm. The first was about quality of orgasm (fast/intense/late, difficult/weak/absent) and the second about the presence of painful orgasm and its frequency (always/sometimes/often).  Results:   After prostate brachytherapy, 81.3% of sexually active men conserved ejaculation and 90% orgasm. There was a significant deterioration of the quality of orgasm (P=0.0001). More than 50% of the patients had an altered orgasm (weak, difficult, absent) after brachytherapy, vs 16% before implantation (P=0.001). Men with a diminished ejaculation volume often had a weak/difficult orgasm (P=0.007). Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy did not seem to impact the quality of orgasm or the frequency of painful ejaculation. Patients who had an IIEF-5 score higher than 12 had frequently intense orgasm (26.7% vs 2.7%; P<0.001) after brachytherapy. Sixty patients (30.3%) experienced often/sometimes painful ejaculation 12.9% (n=31) before implantation (P=0.0001).

Real time elastography is a promising modality to overcome this problem. The goal of the current study was an evaluation of real time elastography for the correct detection of prostate cancer lesions in prostatectomy specimens.  Patients and methods:   Between 11/2008 and 05/2009, 28 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and scheduled for radical prostatectomy underwent real time elastography before radical prostatectomy. Elastography was performed using a Hitachi(®) EUB 7500 ultrasound machine with a V53W rectal probe at 7,5MHz by one operator. During the exam, each prostate was partitioned into 12 sectors (anterior, posterior, left, right, base, middle gland, apex). Suspect zones were identified and filed depending on their localization. The prostatectomy specimens were processed according to the Stanford protocol in 3-5mm step sections. The preoperative and postoperative results regarding tumor localization were compared.  Results:   In total, 88 cancer lesions could be identified in the prostatectomy specimen, where 125 sectors were positive for a total of 336 sectors evaluated. Based on elastography 134 suspicious sectors were identified. For real time elastography, the sensitivity and specificity for correct cancer identification were 73.4 and 79.0 %, respectively. The negative and positive predictive value was 83.4 and 67.4 %, respectively. Accuracy for correct identification of the tumor lesion was 76.5 %.  Conclusion:   In this study, real time elastography showed high accuracy in the identification of prostate cancer lesions in the prostate.

We attempted to create an equation to predict the likelihood of having prostate cancer.  Methods:   Between January 2005 and May 2008, patients who received prostate biopsies were retrospective evaluated. The relationship between the possibility of prostate cancer and the following variables were evaluated: age; serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, prostate volume, numbers of prostatic biopsies, digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, and the presence of hypoechoic nodule under transrectal ultrasonography.  Results:   A multivariate regression model was created to predict the possibility of having prostate cancer, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn based on the predictive scoring equation. Using a predictive equation, P=1/(1-e(-x)), where X=-4.88,+1.11 (if DRE positive),+0.75 (if hypoechoic nodule of prostate present),+1.27 (when 7<PSA≤10),+2.02 (when 10<PSA≤24),+2.28 (when 24<PSA≤50),+3.93 (when 50<PSA),+1.23 (when 65<age≤75),+1.66 (when 75<age), followed by ROC curve analysis, we showed that the sensitivity was 88.5% and specificity was 79.1% in predicting the possibility of prostate cancer.

Healthy dietary practices may improve cancer survivors' health and well-being.  Objective:   The durability of the effects of the FRESH START intervention, a program of sequentially tailored mailed materials, and standardized mailed materials (for controls) on cancer survivors' dietary outcomes was assessed over a 2-year period. Greater dietary gains were expected for FRESH START participants relative to controls.  Design:   Participants were randomized to receive tailored vs standardized 10-month mailed print interventions promoting diet and exercise behaviors. Data were collected at baseline and 1- and 2-year follow-ups.  Participants/setting:   Breast and prostate cancer survivors (n=543) were recruited from 39 states and two provinces within North America. A total of 489 participants completed the 2-year follow-up assessment (10% attrition).  Intervention:   Participants were randomly assigned to either a 10-month program of tailored mailed print materials promoting fruit and vegetable consumption, reduced total and saturated fat intake, and/or increased exercise or to a 10-month program of publicly available mailed materials on diet and exercise.  Main outcome measures:   Telephone surveys (supported with blood biomarkers) assessed dietary habits at baseline and 1- and 2-year follow-ups.  Statistical analyses performed:   Paired-samples t tests were conducted to examine the durability of the intervention's effects on dietary outcomes within each study arm. Arm differences in follow-up outcomes were then tested with the general linear model, controlling for the baseline value of the outcomes.  Results:   Both arms reported decreased saturated fat intake, increased servings of fruits and vegetables, and better overall diet quality at year 2 relative to baseline. However, FRESH START participants reported better overall diet quality and lower total and saturated fat intake compared to controls at the 2-year follow-up.

The aim of the study was to possibly identifying new hereditary patterns predisposing for cancer in the different histopathologic subtypes of breast cancer, with focus on patients with lobular breast cancer and cancer in their first degree relatives.  Methods:   In 1676 consecutive breast cancer patients detailed family history of cancer was related to histopathologic subtype of breast cancer.  Results:   Patients with lobular breast cancer were found to be significantly positively associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, OR 2.17 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-3.46). The finding persisted after excluding breast cancer in the family. Ductal breast cancer was associated with having a mother diagnosed with cancer. There was a significant association between lobular breast cancer and having a father with prostate cancer, OR 2.4 (CI 1.1-5.3). The occurrence of having a father with prostate cancer for lobular breast cancer patients was higher in the younger patient group, OR 2.9 (CI 1.1-7.8), and was still high but lost statistical significance in the older patient group, OR 1.9 (CI 0.5-7.4). The association between lobular breast cancer and a father remained significant after excluding fathers with prostate cancer, OR 1.94 (CI 1.20-3.14). Other commonly occurring tumor types in the father included sarcoma and leukemia.  Conclusion:   We propose that lobular breast cancer is associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, most commonly prostate carcinoma. Since the association remained after excluding family history of breast cancer, the association seems independent of classical breast cancer heredity. The association with a father diagnosed with cancer also remained after removing prostate cancer, indicating an independence from prostate cancer as well.
