We evaluated 3.0 T dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in monitoring ADT response. Twenty-three consecutive patients with prostate cancer treated by primary ADT were included. Imaging was performed at baseline and 3 months posttreatment with ADT. After 3 months therapy there was a significant reduction in all dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI parameters measured in tumor regions of interest (K(trans), k(ep), v(p), IAUGC-90); P < 0.001. Areas of normal-appearing peripheral zone showed no significant change; P = 0.285-0.879. Post-ADT, there was no significant change in apparent diffusion coefficient values in tumors, whilst apparent diffusion coefficient values significantly decreased in areas of normal-appearing peripheral zone, from 1.786 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s to 1.561 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; P = 0.007. As expected the median Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) significantly reduced from 30 ng/mL to 1.5 ng/mL posttreatment, and median prostate volume dropped from 47.6 cm(3) to 24.9 cm(3) ; P < 0.001. These results suggest that dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI offer different information but that both could prove useful adjuncts to the anatomical information provided by T2-weighted imaging. dynamic contrast-enhanced as a marker of angiogenesis may help demonstrate ADT resistance and diffusion-weighted imaging may be more accurate in determining presence of tumor cell death versus residual tumor.""","""['T Barrett', 'A B Gill', 'M Y Kataoka', 'A N Priest', 'I Joubert', 'M A McLean', 'M J Graves', 'S Stearn', 'D J Lomas', 'J R Griffiths', 'D Neal', 'V J Gnanapragasam', 'E Sala']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['Prostate Cancer: assessing the effects of androgen-deprivation therapy using quantitative diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.', 'Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Volume Reduction and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'A 16-year clinical experience with intermittent androgen deprivation for prostate cancer: oncological results.', 'Degarelix versus goserelin plus bicalutamide therapy for lower urinary tract symptom relief, prostate volume reduction and quality of life improvement in men with prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Hormone therapy for radiorecurrent prostate cancer.', 'Radiomics based on biparametric MRI for the detection of significant residual prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy: using whole-mount histopathology as reference standard.', 'A Feasibility Study of the Therapeutic Response and Durability of Short-term Androgen-targeted Therapy in Early Prostate Cancer Managed with Surveillance: The Therapeutics in Active Prostate Surveillance (TAPS01) Study.', 'Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment response assessment of radiation therapy.', 'Impact of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy on magnetic resonance imaging features in prostate cancer before radiotherapy.', 'Multimodal imaging for radiation therapy planning in patients with primary prostate cancer.']"""

However, the lack of clinically relevant models hinders our understanding of the disease as well as development of effective therapies and imaging approaches. We used noninvasive MRI, histology and micro CT to further characterize the newly established prostate cancer bone metastases-derived model MDA-PCa-118b, and to compare it to the well-established PC-3MM2 model with regard to bone structure and vascular patterning. The PC-3MM2 model is highly osteolytic whereas the MDA-PCa-118b model shows a robust osteoblastic reaction, as often seen in clinical cases. Macromolecular contrast enhanced MRI revealed differences in vascular permeability patterns, which appeared peripheral for PC-3MM2 and nodular for MDA-PCa-118b, matching the microscopic cellular composition of each model: PC-3MM2 exclusively recruits endothelial cells to form thin tumor-core blood vessels and enlarged, leaky peripheral vessels, whereas MDA-PCa-118b also recruits bone-forming cells and pericytes such that small tumor nests are encircled with leaky vessels and embedded in bone-like tissue dotted with pericyte-covered vessels. Despite these structural differences, vascular permeability was reduced in both tumor models by either imatinib or SU10944 treatment. This study highlights the importance of clinically relevant osteogenic models of human prostate cancer and the value of such models not only in enhancing our understanding of tumorigenesis, metastasis and response to therapy, but also for development of appropriate methods for noninvasive imaging of these processes.""","""['Hagit Dafni', 'Andrew J Burghardt', 'Sharmila Majumdar', 'Nora M Navone', 'Sabrina M Ronen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['BMP4 promotes prostate tumor growth in bone through osteogenesis.', 'Macromolecular dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI detects reduced vascular permeability in a prostate cancer bone metastasis model following anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) therapy, indicating a drop in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) activation.', 'Secretome analysis of an osteogenic prostate tumor identifies complex signaling networks mediating cross-talk of cancer and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment.', 'Animal models of bone metastasis.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases promote both osteolytic and osteoblastic activity.', 'Bone-induced c-kit expression in prostate cancer: a driver of intraosseous tumor growth.']"""

Macrophages migrate from the circulation into the tissue, phagocytose debris, and return to the bloodstream. Hence it seems likely that activated macrophages containing tumor debris, i.e., tumor marker, are present in the stroma of colorectal carcinoma. After phagocytosis, they could follow a hematogenic or lymphogenic route to the peripheral blood. The aim of this study is to assess the presence of tumor marker-containing activated macrophages in the stroma of colon carcinoma and in regional lymph nodes. From 10 cases of colon carcinoma, samples of tumor tissue and metastasis-free lymph nodes were cut in serial sections and stained for CD68 to identify macrophages and for CEA, cytokeratin, or M30 presence. Slides were digitalised and visually inspected using two monitors, comparing the CD68 stain to the tumor marker stain to evaluate the presence of tumor marker-positive macrophages. Macrophages containing tumor marker could be identified in tumor stroma and in metastasis-free regional lymph nodes. The distribution varied for the different markers, CEA-positive macrophages being most abundant. The presence of macrophages containing tumor marker in the tumor stroma and lymph nodes from patients with colon carcinoma could be confirmed in this series using serial immunohistochemistry. This finding supports the concept of activated macrophages, after phagocytosing cell debris, being transported or migrating through the lymphatic system. These results support the potential of tumor marker-containing macrophages to serve as a marker for diagnosis and follow-up of colon cancer patients.""","""['T J E Faber', 'D Japink', 'M P G Leers', 'M N Sosef', 'M F von Meyenfeldt', 'M Nap']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['CD68+, but not stabilin-1+ tumor associated macrophages in gaps of ductal tumor structures negatively correlate with the lymphatic metastasis in human breast cancer.', 'Lymph node CXCL17 messenger RNA: A new prognostic biomarker for colon cancer.', 'TGF-beta receptor 2 downregulation in tumour-associated stroma worsens prognosis and high-grade tumours show more tumour-associated macrophages and lower TGF-beta1 expression in colon carcinoma: a retrospective study.', 'Lymph node metastasis could be predicted by evaluation of macrophage infiltration and hsp70 expression in superficial carcinoma of the esophagus.', 'The intratumoral distribution influences the prognostic impact of CD68- and CD204-positive macrophages in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Fibrocytes: A Critical Review and Practical Guide.', 'Monocytes carrying GFAP detect glioma, brain metastasis and ischaemic stroke, and predict glioblastoma survival.', 'Obesity, DNA Damage, and Development of Obesity-Related Diseases.', 'EDIM-TKTL1/Apo10 Blood Test: An Innate Immune System Based Liquid Biopsy for the Early Detection, Characterization and Targeted Treatment of Cancer.', 'Determining the potential of desmoglein 3 as a sensitive and specific immunohistochemical marker for the detection of micrometastasis in patients with primary oral squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed patients with advanced CRPC who had previously progressed to first-line docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Patients were given second-line chemotherapy with capecitabine and CTX plus thalidomide and prednisone throughout the course. Patients were evaluated for response and toxicity, and treatment was continued until the disease progression or excessive toxicity was noted.  Results:   From April 2007 to February 2010, a total of 28 patients (median age, 72.8 ± 2.9 years) received second-line chemotherapy. The median cycle and duration of metronomic chemotherapy were six (range: 1-12) cycles and 6.3 (range 1.5-20.5) months, respectively. Prostatic-specific antigen was decreased by more than 50% in 10 (35.7%) of the 28 patients. All patients had bone metastases, and 8 patients (28.6%) had measurable soft tissue lesions. Among the 8 patients, 1 patient achieved partial response, and 3 patients had stabilized disease.

In this study, we tested using in vitro and in vivo models the differential biological effects of a novel HDAC inhibitor [belinostat (PXD101)], in a wide panel of androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent tumor cells. Belinostat significantly increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Belinostat potently inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 range from 0.5 to 2.5 µM) with cytotoxic activity preferentially against tumor cells. This agent induced G2/M arrest and increased significantly the percentage of apoptosis mainly in androgen-sensitive tumor cells confirming its growth-inhibitory effects. The cell death mechanisms were studied in three different prostate cancer cell lines with different androgen dependence and expression of androgen receptor; LAPC-4 and 22rv1 (androgen-dependent and expressing androgen receptor) and PC3 (androgen-independent not expressing androgen receptor). Belinostat induced the expression of p21 and p27, acetylation of p53 and G2/M arrest associated with Bcl2 and Bcl-Xl downmodulation and significant reduction of survivin, IAPs and Akt/pAkt and increased caspase-8 and -9 expression/activity. Belinostat effectiveness was dependent on the androgen receptor (AR), since the stable transfection of AR greatly increased the efficacy of this HDAC inhibitor. These observations were correlated using in vivo models. We demonstrated that belinostat preferentially resulted in antitumor effect in androgen-dependent tumor cells expressing AR. Our findings provide evidence that belinostat may be a promising anticancer drug for prostate cancer expressing AR, supporting its clinical role in prostate cancer.""","""['Giovanni Luca Gravina', 'Francesco Marampon', 'Ilaria Giusti', 'Eleonora Carosa', 'Stefania Di Sante', 'Enrico Ricevuto', 'Vincenza Dolo', 'Vincenzo Tombolini', 'Emmanuele A Jannini', 'Claudio Festuccia']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor belinostat (PXD101) in preclinical models of prostate cancer.', 'Chronic administration of valproic acid inhibits prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.', 'Sodium butyrate regulates androgen receptor expression and cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen axis in prostate cancer.', 'The complex role of AR signaling after cytotoxic insult: implications for cell-cycle-based chemotherapeutics.', 'Multiple Antitumor Molecular Mechanisms Are Activated by a Fully Synthetic and Stabilized Pharmaceutical Product Delivering the Active Compound Sulforaphane (SFX-01) in Preclinical Model of Human Glioblastoma.', 'Anticancer Therapy with HDAC Inhibitors: Mechanism-Based Combination Strategies and Future Perspectives.', 'Schedule-Dependent Synergy Between the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Belinostat and the Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor Pralatrexate in T-and B-cell Lymphoma Cells in vitro.', 'HDAC inhibitors rescue multiple disease-causing CFTR variants.', 'Episode-like pulse testosterone supplementation induces tumor senescence and growth arrest down-modulating androgen receptor through modulation of p-ERK1/2, pARser81 and CDK1 signaling: biological implications for men treated with testosterone replacement therapy.']"""

However, the influence of DM on biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) has not been clearly defined for men with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy.  Materials and methods:   From April 1995 to May 2006, 1624 consecutive patients underwent brachytherapy with or without supplemental therapies. A prebrachytherapy diagnosis of diabetes was present in 199 patients (12.3%). Median follow-up was 7.8 years. Cause of death was determined for each deceased patient. Patients with metastatic prostate cancer or castrate-resistant disease without obvious metastases who died of any cause were classified as dead of prostate cancer. All other deaths were attributed to the immediate cause of death.  Results:   In patients without (n=1425) and with (n=199) DM, CSS was 97.2% versus 100% (P=0.168), bPFS was 95.6% versus 95.7% (P=0.960), and OS was 77.3% versus 56.0% at 12 years (P=0.003). In Cox regression analysis, OS in nondiabetic patients was most closely related to patient age, coronary artery disease, tobacco consumption, and androgen deprivation. In patients with diabetes, OS was related to patient age and coronary artery disease. In patients without diabetes, CSS was associated with Gleason score and clinical stage. No patient with diabetes died of prostate cancer. Patients with DM were more likely to die of cardiovascular disease (17.8% vs. 12.4%, P=0.007).  Conclusions:   DM does not impact CSS or bPFS after brachytherapy. OS is significantly lower in patients with diabetes due to more deaths from cardiovascular disease.""","""['Madhu B Shetti', 'Gregory S Merrick', 'Wayne M Butler', 'Robert Galbreath', 'Ashley Torlone', 'Jonathan H Lief', 'Edward Adamovich', 'Kent E Wallner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Distant metastases following permanent interstitial brachytherapy for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Primary Gleason pattern does not impact survival after permanent interstitial brachytherapy for Gleason score 7 prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy does not impact cause-specific or overall survival in high-risk prostate cancer managed with brachytherapy and supplemental external beam.', 'High-risk prostate cancer with Gleason score 8-10 and PSA level ≤15 ng/mL treated with permanent interstitial brachytherapy.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Use of androgen deprivation therapy with prostate brachytherapy-A systematic literature review.', 'The Association of Diabetes and Obesity With Prostate Cancer Progression: HCaP-NC.', 'Prostate-specific antigen nadir concentration, hypertension and diabetes as risk factors for biochemical failure after permanent 125I seed brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Diabetes and mortality in patients with prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Is pathology necessary to predict mortality among men with prostate-cancer?', 'Prostate cancer treatment and survival: evidence for men with prevalent comorbid conditions.']"""

These intercellular interactions, modulated by the microenvironment, effect tumour progression and represent a largely under-appreciated therapeutic target. We use observations of primary tumour biology from prostate cancer to extrapolate a mathematical model. Specifically, it has been observed that in prostate cancer three disparate cellular outcomes predominate: (i) the tumour remains well differentiated and clinically indolent--in this case the local stromal cells may act to restrain the growth of the cancer; (ii) early in its genesis the tumour acquires a highly malignant phenotype, growing rapidly and displacing the original stromal population (often referred to as small cell prostate cancer)--these less common aggressive tumours are relatively independent of the local microenvironment and (iii) the tumour co-opts the local stroma--taking on a classic stromagenic phenotype where interactions with the local microenvironment are critical to the cancer growth.  Methods:   We present an evolutionary game theoretical construct that models the influence of tumour-stroma interactions in driving these outcomes. We consider three characteristic and distinct cellular populations: stromal cells, tumour cells that are self-reliant in terms of microenvironmental factors and tumour cells that depend on the environment for resources, but can also co-opt stroma.  Results:   Using evolutionary game theory we explore a number of different scenarios that elucidate the impact of tumour-stromal interactions on the dynamics of prostate cancer growth and progression, and how different treatments in the metastatic setting can affect different types of tumours.  Conclusion:   The tumour microenvironment has a crucial role in selecting the traits of the tumour cells that will determine prostate cancer progression. Equally important treatments like hormone therapy affect the selection of these cancer phenotypes making it very important to understand how they impact prostate cancer's somatic evolution.""","""['D Basanta', 'J G Scott', 'M N Fishman', 'G Ayala', 'S W Hayward', 'A R A Anderson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Asporin is a stromally expressed marker associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Tumour-stroma interactions between metastatic prostate cancer cells and fibroblasts.', 'Prostatic tumor stroma: a key player in cancer progression.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', '""Stromal cells in prostate cancer pathobiology: friends or foes?"".', 'Masking, maintenance and mimicry: the interplay of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic effects in evolutionary games.', 'The future of theoretical evolutionary game theory.', 'Ecology and games in cancer: new insights into the disease.', 'The role of evolutionary game theory in spatial and non-spatial models of the survival of cooperation in cancer: a review.', 'The Contribution of Evolutionary Game Theory to Understanding and Treating Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Patients with advanced solid tumours were treated with entinostat orally once weekly and with CRA orally twice daily × 3 weeks every 4 weeks. The starting dose for entinostat was 4 mg m(-2) with a fixed dose of CRA at 1 mg kg(-1) per day. Entinostat dose was escalated by 1 mg m(-2) increments. Pharmacokinetic concentrations of entinostat and CRA were determined by LC/MS/MS. Western blot analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumour samples were performed to evaluate target inhibition.  Results:   A total of 19 patients were enroled. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded at the entinostat 5 mg m(-2) dose level (G3 hyponatremia, neutropenia, and anaemia). Fatigue (G1 or G2) was a common side effect. Entinostat exhibited substantial variability in clearance (147%) and exposure. CRA trough concentrations were consistent with prior reports. No objective responses were observed, however, prolonged stable disease occurred in patients with prostate, pancreatic, and kidney cancer. Data further showed increased tumour histone acetylation and decreased phosphorylated ERK protein expression.  Conclusion:   The combination of entinostat with CRA was reasonably well tolerated. The recommended phase II doses are entinostat 4 mg m(-2) once weekly and CRA 1 mg kg(-1) per day.

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) plays a major role in oncogenesis through its various functions in lipid transport, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction. Increased expression of Cav-1 in tumor cells has been associated with aggressiveness and poor survival. More recently, loss of stromal Cav-1 expression was linked to poor survival and increased metastatic potential in breast and prostate cancer. To date, there is no study addressing the clinical significance of Cav-1 expression in malignant melanoma (MM). Our study consisted of 44 cases of MM: 12 MM lymph node metastases from patients with short survival, 12 MM lymph node metastases from patients with long survival and 20 primary MM. All cases were stained with Cav-1 antibodies. Cav-1 expression in melanoma and stromal cells was quantified using a 3 point scale: 0 = no staining, 1 = diffuse weak staining or strong staining in < 30% of cells, and 2 = diffuse strong staining. A score of 0-1 represented low Cav-1 expression and a score of 2 represented high Cav-1 expression. In patients with MM lymph node metastases, a low stromal Cav-1 expression was associated with shorter survival when compared to the high stromal Cav-1 expression group (median survival 252 days versus 3,508 days, p value 0.0054). Conversely, high Cav-1 expression in melanoma cells was associated with a longer survival in primary MM (p < 0.0001).

A novel in vivo beam range control method shows millimeter accuracy, suggesting that such fields could be safely used to spare the rectum given the sharp distal penumbra of protons.  Methods and materials:   Ten prostate patients treated with water-filled endorectal balloon were selected. Bilateral fields were planned following the conventional treatment protocol. Three anterior-oriented fields (0, +30, -30°) were planned, with the range compensators manually adjusted to improve rectal sparing. Dose distributions to the clinical target volume, rectum, anterior rectal wall (ARW), bladder, bladder wall (BW), and femoral heads were compared for: A) equally weighted bilateral fields, B) a single straight anterior field, and C) two equally weighted anterior-oblique fields.  Results:   The anterior-oriented fields required much less beam energy, ∼10 cm water equivalent path length less than lateral fields. For ARW, the V(95%) for Plans A, B, and C were 39%, 8%, and 6%, respectively; the corresponding V(80%) were 59%, 27%, and 26%, respectively (p = 0.002 when Plan A was compared with B or C). Plan B irradiated a larger volume of BW than did Plan A by 3% at V(95%), 11% at V(80%), and 16% at V(50%) (p = 0.002), whereas Plan C differs little from Plan A for BW at these dose levels. The femoral heads received ∼40% of the prescription dose in Plan A, but negligible dose in Plans B and C.  Conclusions:   Compared to lateral fields, anterior-oriented fields can significantly reduce dose to the ARW, particularly at high dose levels. These fields alone, or in combination with lateral fields, allow for the possibility of either reducing treatment toxicity at current prescription doses or further dose escalation in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Shikui Tang', 'Stefan Both', 'Hassan Bentefour', 'Jonathan J Paly', 'Zelig Tochner', 'Jason Efstathiou', 'Hsiao-Ming Lu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Comparing 3-, 4- and 6-fields techniques for conformal irradiation of prostate and seminal vesicles using dose-volume histograms.', 'Dosimetric study of pelvic proton radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Influence of rectum delineation (rectal volume vs. rectal wall) on IMRT treatment planning of the prostate.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices during prostate external-beam radiation therapy: A review.', 'Implementation of newer radiotherapeutic technology in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric comparison of robust angles in carbon-ion radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Robust Angle Selection in Particle Therapy.', 'Proton therapy for prostate cancer: current state and future perspectives.', 'Anteriorly Oriented Beam Arrangements with Daily in Vivo Range Verification for Proton Therapy of Prostate Cancer: Rectal Toxicity Rates.', 'In vivo range verification in particle therapy.']"""

The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between the bladder volume and optimal treatment planning in radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   Two hundred and forty-three patients underwent definitive radiotherapy with helical tomotherapy for intermediate- and high-risk localized prostate cancer. The prescribed dose defined as 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) receiving ≧ 100% of the prescription dose was 76 Gy in 38 fractions. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as the prostate with a 5-mm margin and 2 cm of the proximal seminal vesicle. The PTV was defined as the CTV with a 5-mm margin. Treatment plans were optimized to satisfy the dose constraints defined by in-house protocols for PTV and organs at risk (rectum wall, bladder wall, sigmoid colon and small intestine). If all dose constraints were satisfied, the plan was defined as an optimal plan (OP).  Results:   An OP was achieved with 203 patients (84%). Mean bladder volume (± 1 SD) was 266 ml (± 130 ml) among those with an OP and 214 ml (±130 ml) among those without an OP (p = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis also showed that bladder volumes below 150 ml decreased the possibility of achieving an OP. However, the percentage of patients with an OP showed a plateau effect at bladder volumes above 150 ml.  Conclusions:   Bladder volume is a significant factor affecting OP rates. However, our results suggest that bladder volumes exceeding 150 ml may not help meet planning dose constraints.""","""['Naoki Nakamura', 'Naoto Shikama', 'Osamu Takahashi', 'Kenji Sekiguchi', 'Yukihiro Hama', 'Keiko Akahane', 'Keiichi Nakagawa']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['The comparison of radiotherapy techniques for treatment of the prostate cancer: the three-field vs. the four-field.', 'A dose-escalation trial with the adaptive radiotherapy process as a delivery system in localized prostate cancer: analysis of chronic toxicity.', 'A phase II trial for the optimisation of treatment position in the radiation therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Choice of optimal margins in prostate conformal radiotherapy.', 'Assessment of an ultrasound bladder scanner in prostate radiotherapy: A validation study and analysis of bladder filling variability.', 'Impact of bladder volume on acute genitourinary toxicity in intensity modulated radiotherapy for localized and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Monte Carlo Simulations for Dosimetry in Prostate Radiotherapy with Different Intravesical Volumes and Planning Target Volume Margins.', 'Utility of Smart Arc CDR for intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Does transperitoneal minimally invasive radical prostatectomy increase the amount of small bowel receiving salvage radiation?']"""

Methods:   We address both issues in this case-control study focused on aggressive prostate cancer (470 cases and 512 controls), where men reported not only their meat intake but also their meat preparation and doneness level on a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Associations between overall and grilled meat consumption, doneness level, ensuing carcinogens and aggressive prostate cancer were assessed using multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   Higher consumption of any ground beef or processed meats were positively associated with aggressive prostate cancer, with ground beef showing the strongest association (OR = 2.30, 95% CI:1.39-3.81; P-trend = 0.002). This association primarily reflected intake of grilled or barbequed meat, with more well-done meat conferring a higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer.

Objectives:   We performed a comprehensive analysis of association of variants in the KLK15 gene with prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness by genotyping tagSNPs, as well as putative functional SNPs identified by extensive bioinformatics analysis. METHODS AND DATA SOURCES: Twelve out of 22 SNPs, selected on the basis of linkage disequilibrium pattern, were analyzed in an Australian sample of 1,011 histologically verified prostate cancer cases and 1,405 ethnically matched controls. Replication was sought from two existing genome wide association studies (GWAS): the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project and a UK GWAS study.  Results:   Two KLK15 SNPs, rs2659053 and rs3745522, showed evidence of association (p<0.05) but were not present on the GWAS platforms. KLK15 SNP rs2659056 was found to be associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness and showed evidence of association in a replication cohort of 5,051 patients from the UK, Australia, and the CGEMS dataset of US samples.

The rs2659056 SNP is predicted to alter binding of the RORalpha transcription factor, which has a role in the control of cell growth and differentiation and has been suggested to control the metastatic behavior of prostate cancer cells.

High-grade serous (HGS) ovarian cancer is characterized by p53 mutation and high levels of genomic instability. Treatment includes platinum-based chemotherapy and initial response rates are high; however, resistance is frequently acquired, at which point treatment options are largely palliative. Recent data indicate that platinum-resistant clones exist within the sensitive primary tumor at presentation, implying resistant cell selection after treatment with platinum chemotherapy. The AKT pathway is central to cell survival and has been implicated in platinum resistance. Here, we show that platinum exposure induces an AKT-dependent, prosurvival, DNA damage response in clinically platinum-resistant but not platinum-sensitive cells. AKT relocates to the nucleus of resistant cells where it is phosphorylated specifically on S473 by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and this activation inhibits cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition of DNA-PK or AKT, but not mTORC2, restores platinum sensitivity in a panel of clinically resistant HGS ovarian cancer cell lines: we also demonstrate these effects in other tumor types. Resensitization is associated with prevention of AKT-mediated BAD phosphorylation. Strikingly, in patient-matched sensitive cells, we do not see enhanced apoptosis on combining cisplatin with AKT or DNA-PK inhibition. Insulin-mediated activation of AKT is unaffected by DNA-PK inhibitor treatment, suggesting that this effect is restricted to DNA damage-mediated activation of AKT and that, clinically, DNA-PK inhibition might prevent platinum-induced AKT activation without interfering with normal glucose homeostasis, an unwanted toxicity of direct AKT inhibitors.""","""['Euan A Stronach', 'Michelle Chen', 'Elaina N Maginn', 'Roshan Agarwal', 'Gordon B Mills', 'Harpreet Wasan', 'Hani Gabra']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Cell detachment modulates TRAIL resistance in ovarian cancer cells by downregulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.', 'Cellular pharmacology of cis and trans pairs of platinum complexes in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells.', 'CD133 and DNA-PK regulate MDR1 via the PI3K- or Akt-NF-κB pathway in multidrug-resistant glioblastoma cells in vitro.', 'Erlotinib or gefitinib for the treatment of relapsed platinum pretreated non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer: a systematic review.', 'Genomic profiling of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer: The road into druggable targets.', 'Mucin 4 Confers Gemcitabine Resistance and an Unfavorable Prognosis in Patients with Cholangiocarcinoma via AKT Activation.', 'DNA Damage Response Alterations in Ovarian Cancer: From Molecular Mechanisms to Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Complex molecular profile of DNA repair genes in epithelial ovarian carcinoma patients with different sensitivity to platinum-based therapy.', 'Radioresistance in rhabdomyosarcomas: Much more than a question of dose.', 'Targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in epithelial ovarian cancer, therapeutic treatment options for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.']"""

Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation is important in the initiation and growth of various carcinomas including PCa. We and others have observed aberrations of Hh pathway during the progression of PCa to the castration-resistant state. The involvement of androgen signalling in Hh pathway activation, however, remains largely elusive. Here we investigate the direct role of androgen signalling on Hh pathway. We examined the effect of Dihydrosterone (DHT), antiandrogen, bicalutamide, and Hh pathway inhibitor, KAAD-cyclopamine in four human prostate cell lines (two cancerous: LNCaP, VCaP, and two normal: PNT2 and PNT2-ARm which harbours a mutant version of androgen receptor (AR) that is commonly found in LNCaP). Cell proliferation as well as Hh pathway members (SHH, IHH, DHH, GLI, PTCH) mRNA expression levels were assessed. We showed that KAAD-cyclopamine decreased cell proliferation of DHT-stimulated LNCaP, VCaP and PNT2-ARm cells. SHH expression was found to be downregulated by DHT in all AR posititve cells. The negative effect of DHT on SHH expression was counteracted when cells were treated by bicalutamide. Importantly, KAAD-cyclopamine treatment seemed to inhibit AR activity.

Prostate cancer patients with a high risk of developing metastases have few treatment options, none of which can result in a durable cure. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of a SRC inhibitor, dasatinib, on the ability of human prostate cancer cell to complete key steps in the metastatic process, including invasion and angiogenesis. Dasatinib treatment impaired the metastatic phenotypes of the human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP, by significantly reducing migration and invasion in modified Boyden chambers. Inhibition of phosphorylation, and therefore enhanced activation, of SRC and key downstream signaling pathway elements, including FAK, STAT3, Paxillin, and Akt, as determined by Western blotting, also was observed. This suggests that dasatinib interferes with critical cell functions associated with the metastatic cascade. Dasatinib also had direct effects on the ability of microvascular endothelial cells to form tubes in vitro and impaired the ability of PC-3 cells to induce angiogenesis in vivo. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that SRC inhibition by dasatinib may have utility in reducing the metastatic spread of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Lori Rice', 'Sharon Lepler', 'Christina Pampo', 'Dietmar W Siemann']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Targeting SRC family kinases inhibits growth and lymph node metastases of prostate cancer in an orthotopic nude mouse model.', 'Augmentation of the anticancer activity of CYT997 in human prostate cancer by inhibiting Src activity.', 'Identification and validation of phospho-SRC, a novel and potential pharmacodynamic biomarker for dasatinib (SPRYCEL), a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor.', 'Inhibition of SRC family kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases by dasatinib: possible combinations in solid tumors.', 'The role of Src in prostate cancer.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Signal Crosstalk and the Role of Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ) in Prostate Cancer.', 'Harnessing the potential of multimodal radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'c-Src is required for hypoxia-induced metastasis-associated functions in prostate cancer cells.', 'Axl signaling is an important mediator of tumor angiogenesis.']"""

TDF and TDF-P1, a 20-amino acid peptide selected from the open reading frame of TDF, induce differentiation in human breast and prostate cancer cells but not in other cells. TDF protein has no identified site of action or receptor, and its mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we used TDF-P1 to purify and identify potential TDF receptor (TDF-R) candidates from MCF7 steroid-responsive breast cancer cells and non-breast HeLa cancerous cells using affinity purification chromatography (AP), and mass spectrometry (MS). We identified four candidate proteins from the 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family in MCF7 cells. Experiments in non-breast HeLa cancerous cells did not identify any TDF-R candidates. AP and MS experiments were validated by AP and Western blotting (WB). We additionally looked for TDF-R in steroid-resistant BT-549 cells and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF-a) using AP and WB. TDF-P1 interacts with potential TDF-R candidates from MCF7 and BT-549 breast cells but not from HeLa or HDF-a cells. Immunofluorescence (IF) experiments identified GRP78, a TDF-R candidate, at the cell surface of MCF7, BT-549 breast cells, and HeLa cells but not HDF-a cells. IF of other HSP70 proteins demonstrated labeling on all four cell types. These results point toward GRP78 and HSP70 proteins as strong TDF-R candidates and suggest that TDF interacts with its receptor, exclusively on breast cells, through a steroid-independent pathway.""","""['Izabela Sokolowska', 'Alisa G Woods', 'Mary Ann Gawinowicz', 'Urmi Roy', 'Costel C Darie']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Identification of a potential tumor differentiation factor receptor candidate in prostate cancer cells.', 'Investigating a novel protein using mass spectrometry: the example of tumor differentiation factor (TDF).', 'Characterization of tumor differentiation factor (TDF) and its receptor (TDF-R).', 'Role of Mass Spectrometry in Investigating a Novel Protein: The Example of Tumor Differentiation Factor (TDF).', 'A pituitary gene encodes a protein that produces differentiation of breast and prostate cancer cells.', 'The Clinicopathological Significance of BiP/GRP-78 in Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Public Datasets and Immunohistochemical Detection.', 'Identification of a novel TPM4 isoform transcript and comparison to the expression of other tropomyosin isoforms in bovine cardiac and skeletal muscles.', 'House dust mite sensitization drives cross-reactive immune responses to homologous helminth proteins.', 'Targeting the GRP78 Pathway for Cancer Therapy.', 'Lactoferrin translocates to the nucleus of bovine rectal epithelial cells in the presence of Escherichia coli O157:H7.']"""

Methods:   Specimens from 27 patients (7 = non-NSRP, 20 = unilateral NS) were examined. Sections were investigated for PN content by immunoassaying. 120 whole-mounted slides were divided into four sectors, and extracapsular nerves were counted; the mean posterior/anterior ratio was calculated. Calculated ratios were correlated with the respective volumes of prostatic tissue (PV). After dividing the patient cohort into two subgroups, shared by the median value of the posterior/anterior nerve ratios, the absolute PN contents on the anterior surface of the NS sides were compared.  Results:   Anatomical posterior nerve percentage in non-NS aspects ranged from 0.0-100.0 to 26.7-94.6% with a mean of 66.60 ± 25.4% and 68.83 ± 16.0% (>/<200 μm, respectively). Individual ratios from two nerve categories showed significant correlation (P < 0.008). Mean posterior ratios were 83.04/79.68 and 39.21/56.00, respectively. After unilateral NS, 3.17-fold (2.25 vs. 0.71 nerves, P = 0.05) and 2.26-fold (21.54 vs. 9.53, P = 0.08) nerve fibers were resected in the anterior area in comparison with type A. After unilateral NS, the variation impact on the anterior nerve content of the NS side could be demonstrated.  Conclusions:   The amounts of nerves localized on the anterior prostate after RP vary interindividually. Saving only a minor part of the anterior areas may have an impact on the quantity of excised nerves adjacent to the specimen and impair postoperative functional results.

Patients and methods:   A total of 807 men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (T2bNXM0, Gleason ≤7, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <20 ng/mL; or cT1c-T2bNXM0, Gleason 7) were consecutively treated with either AST and brachytherapy or EBRT and brachytherapy, between 1997 and 2007, and were followed up until September 21, 2007. A Fine and Gray competing risks multivariable regression model was used to assess whether AST or radiotherapy dose escalation reduced the risk of prostate-cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) when adjusting for age, PSA, Gleason score, and tumor category.  Results:   Treatment with brachytherapy and with EBRT was associated with a significant increase in the risk of PCSM compared with brachytherapy and AST (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 4.027 [95% CI, 1.168-13.89]; P = .027) after adjusting for age and prostate cancer prognostic factors.

Methods and results:   Aerobic and hypoxic CaP cells exposed to hypoxia (24 h) after irradiation (4 Gy) gained a survival advantage compared with cells fully oxygenated after irradiation. This survival advantage was associated with induction of a G2/M cell cycle arrest, reduced induction of apoptosis and decreased amount of senescent cells.

Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) has been demonstrated to be involved in cancerangiogenesis, metastasis and invasion. EMMPRIN expression was evaluated by measuring mRNA and protein levels in a large cohort of patients with PCa following prostatectomy and the findings were compared with clinico-pathological parameters, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse time.  Methods:   EMMPRIN mRNA levels in 20 pairs of normal and cancerous prostate tissues were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Protein expression in paraffin-embedded specimens of prostates gathered from 300 patients with PCa was detected by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody against EMMPRIN. The associations of EMMPRIN protein expression with the clinico-pathological parameters and PSA relapse-free time after radical prostatectomy were subsequently assessed.  Results:   Both EMMPRIN mRNA and protein levels were higher in PCa tissue, compared with adjacent normal tissue. In addition, the positive expression rates of EMMPRIN in PCa tissues were significantly associated with preoperative PSA levels (p=0.008), AJCC stage (p=0.006) and Gleason Score (p < 0.001), Risk classification (p < 0.001), lymph node status post-surgery (p < 0.001) and surgical margin status (p < 0.001) were also determined. Multivariate analysis, using the Cox proportional hazards model, revealed that positive EMMPRIN expression was an independent prognostic factor for an increased risk of PSA relapse.

We selected 16 cases of nasal cavity, lung, liver or prostate cancers as typical tumor sites receiving PSPT. The dose distributions and dose volume histograms optimized by the IMPT were compared with those optimized by the PSPT. We took particular note of the doses to the skin and organs at risk (OAR) when PSPT was replaced by IMPT. Furthermore, an improvement of the beam angles was also performed to obtain better dose distributions in the IMPT. The IMPT with the same beam angles resulted in near-maximum doses to the skin of average 78%, 64%, 84% and 99% of the PSPT doses for nasal cavity, lung, liver, and prostate cancers, respectively. However, it was difficult to improve the dose homogeneity of the target volume. The change of the IMPT beam angles could reduce the doses to OARs and skin in the case of the nasal cavity, while it had limited effect in the other cases.

Comparison according to small and large CA resulted in significantly smaller overlapping of PTVs and OARs for large CA patients at: KAS-FB: PTVpel∩rectum: p=0.0255, PTVpvs∩rectum: p=0.0179, PTVp∩rectum: p=0.0386, PTVpel∩bladder: p=0.0355.

AR plays a central role in the development of prostate cancer and progression to castration resistance during and after androgen deprivation therapy. Here, we identified miR-let-7c as a key regulator of expression of AR. miR-let-7c suppresses AR expression and activity in human prostate cancer cells by targeting its transcription via c-Myc. Suppression of AR by let-7c leads to decreased cell proliferation of human prostate cancer cells. Down-regulation of Let-7c in prostate cancer specimens is inversely correlated with AR expression, whereas the expression of Lin28 (a repressor of let-7) is correlated positively with AR expression. Our study demonstrates that the miRNA let-7c plays an important role in the regulation of androgen signaling in prostate cancer by down-regulating AR expression.

Several genomic regions showing an excess of African or European ancestry, which were considered the footprints of selection since population admixture, were detected based on a commonly used approach. However, we also developed a new strategy to detect natural selection both pre- and post-admixture by reconstructing an ancestral African population (AAF) from inferred African components of ancestry in AfA and comparing it with indigenous African populations (IAF). Interestingly, many selection-candidate genes identified by the new approach were associated with AfA-specific high-risk diseases such as prostate cancer and hypertension, suggesting an important role these disease-related genes might have played in adapting to a new environment. CD36 and HBB, whose mutations confer a degree of protection against malaria, were also located in the highly differentiated regions between AAF and IAF. Further analysis showed that the frequencies of alleles protecting against malaria in AAF were lower than those in IAF, which is consistent with the relaxed selection pressure of malaria in the New World. There is no overlap between the top candidate genes detected by the two approaches, indicating the different environmental pressures AfA experienced pre- and post-population admixture.

Our previous work has shown up-regulated mRNA of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR-1) and the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) in tissues adjacent to prostate cancer.  Methods:   Immunofluorescence data were analyzed quantitatively by spectral imaging and linear unmixing to determine the protein expression levels of EGR-1 and FAS in human cancerous, histologically normal adjacent, and disease-free prostate tissues.  Results:   EGR-1 expression was elevated in both structurally intact tumor adjacent (1.6× on average) and in tumor (3.0× on average) tissues compared to disease-free tissues. In addition, the ratio of cytoplasmic versus nuclear EGR-1 expression was elevated in both tumor adjacent and tumor tissues. Similarly, FAS expression was elevated in both tumor adjacent (2.7× on average) and in tumor (2.5× on average) compared to disease-free tissues.  Conclusions:   EGR-1 and FAS expression is similarly deregulated in tumor and structurally intact adjacent prostate tissues and defines field cancerization. In cases with high suspicion of prostate cancer but negative biopsy, identification of field cancerization could help clinicians target areas for repeat biopsy. Field cancerization at surgical margins on prostatectomy specimen should also be looked at as a predictor of cancer recurrence.

Of these, 706 cases were malignant tumors. In equivocal cases (n = 16) of Gleason 5 adenocarcinoma resembling SCNEC, several neuroendocrine markers were immunohistochemically examined. As the results, four cases of SCNEC were identified; therefore the incidence of SCNEC was 0.5% of all prostatic malignancies. All the four cases were biopsies. The remaining 686 cases were adenocarcinomas. In case 1 (50 years of age), the SCNEC tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin, P504S, synaptophysin, KIT, and PDGFRA, but negative for PSA, neuron specific enolase, CD56, and TTF-1. In case 2 (70 years of age), the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin, PSA, P504S, chromogranin, and synaptophysin, but negative for neuron-specific enolase, CD56, TTF-1, KIT, and PDGFRA.

The current study further explored the underlying mechanism of sPLA2-IIa overexpression and the potential role of sPLA2-IIa as a prostate cancer biomarker.  Methods:   Plasma and tissue specimens from prostate cancer patients were analyzed for sPLA2-IIa levels. Regulation of sPLA2-IIa expression by Heregulin-α was determined by Western blot and reporter assay.  Results:   We found that Heregulin-α enhanced expression of the sPLA2-IIa gene via the HER2/HER3-elicited pathway. The EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor Lapatinib and the NF-kB inhibitor Bortezomib inhibited sPLA2-IIa expression induced by Heregulin-α. Heregulin-α upregulated expression of the sPLA2-IIa gene at the transcriptional level. We further confirmed that plasma sPLA2-IIa secreted by mouse bearing human prostate cancer xenografts reached detectable plasma concentrations. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of patient plasma specimens revealed that high levels of plasma sPLA2-IIa, with the optimum cutoff value of 2.0 ng/ml, were significantly associated with high Gleason score (8-10) relative to intermediate Gleason score (6-7) prostate cancers and advanced relative to indolent cancers. The area under the ROC curve (area under curve, AUC) was 0.73 and 0.74, respectively.  Conclusion:   We found that Heregulin-α, in addition to EGF, contributes to sPLA2-IIa overexpression in prostate cancer cells.

This is due largely to the ""silent"" nature of the disease until it has progressed to a highly metastatic and castrate resistant state. Voltage sensitive sodium channels (VSSCs) are multimeric transmembrane protein complexes comprised of a pore-forming α subunit and one or two β subunits. The β-subunits modulate surface expression and gating kinetics of the channels but also have inherent cell adhesion molecule (CAM) functions. We hypothesize that PCa cells use VSSC β-subunits as CAMs during PCa progression and metastasis.  Methods:   We overexpressed the beta-2 isoform as a C-terminal fusion protein with enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (ECFP) in the weakly metastatic LNCaP cells. The effect of beta-2 overexpression on cell morphology was examined using confocal microscopy while metastasis-associated behavior was tested by performing several in vitro metastatic functional assays and in vivo subcutaneous tumor studies.  Results:   We found that cells overexpressing beta-2 (2BECFP) converted to a bipolar fibroblastic morphology. 2BECFP cells were more adhesive than control (ECFP) to vitronectin (twofold) and Matrigel® (1.3-fold), more invasive through Matrigel® (3.6-fold in 72 hr), and had enhanced migration (2.1-fold in 96 hr) independent of proliferation in wound-healing assays. In contrast, 2BECFP cells have a reduced tumor-take and tumor volume in vivo even though the overexpression of beta-2 was maintained.

Mean (SD) of values for FA, RA, and ADC were compared using analysis of variance. Intra and inter-rater agreement and test reproducibility (n = 5) was assessed by Bland-Altman statistics.  Results:   Mean (SD) for the epithelial/subepithelial layer, internal, external sphincter, and puborectalis were as follows: FA: 0.283 (0.099); 0.337 (0.049); 0.415 (0.072); and 0.407 (0.062), respectively. RA: 0.241 (0.094); 0.292 (0.050); 0.371 (0.083); 0.361 (0.067), respectively; and ADC: 1.49 (0.23); 1.59 (0.19); 1.51 (0.28); and 1.54 (0.29) × 10(-3) mm(2) /s, respectively. Good overall intra and inter-rater agreement and test-retest reproducibility was noted (coefficient of variation of 4.8-19.4% and 5.9-12.9%, respectively).

At these field strengths, substantial nonuniformities in B(1)(+/-) and radiofrequency power deposition become apparent. In this investigation, we propose an improvement on a conventionally used endorectal coil, through the addition of a second element (stripline). Both elements are used as transceivers. In the center of the prostate, approximately 40% signal to noise ratio increase is achieved. In fact, the signal to noise ratio gain obtained with the quadrature configuration locally can be even greater than 40% when compared to the single loop configuration. This is due to the natural asymmetry of the B(1)(+/-) fields at high frequencies, which causes destructive and constructive interference patterns. Global specific absorption rate is reduced by almost a factor of 2 as expected. Furthermore, approximately a 4-fold decrease in local specific absorption rate is observed when normalized to the B(1) values in the center of the prostate. Because of the 4-fold local specific absorption rate decrease obtained with the dual channel setup for the same reference B(1) value (20 μT at 3.5 cm depth into the prostate) as compared to the single loop, the transmission power B(1) duty cycle can be increased by a factor 4. Consequently, when using the two-element endorectal coil, the radiofrequency power deposition is significantly reduced and radiofrequency intense sequences with adiabatic pulses can be safely applied at 7 T for (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and MRI in the prostate. Altogether, in vivo (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer with a fully adiabatic sequence operated at a minimum B(1)(+) of 20 μT shows insensitivity to the nonuniform transmit field, while remaining within local specific absorption rate guidelines of 10 W/kg.""","""['C S Arteaga de Castro', 'B van den Bergen', 'P R Luijten', 'U A van der Heide', 'M van Vulpen', 'D W J Klomp']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['Clinical comparison between a currently available single-loop and an investigational dual-channel endorectal receive coil for prostate magnetic resonance imaging: a feasibility study at 1.5 and 3 T.', 'Development and evaluation of a multichannel endorectal RF coil for prostate MRI at 7T in combination with an external surface array.', '(31) P MR spectroscopic imaging combined with (1) H MR spectroscopic imaging in the human prostate using a double tuned endorectal coil at 7T.', 'Update of prostate magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T.', 'Magnetic resonance tomography with endorectal coil for examination of prostate and seminal vesicles.', 'Emerging MR methods for improved diagnosis of prostate cancer by multiparametric MRI.', 'Ultra-high-field MR in Prostate cancer: Feasibility and Potential.', 'First in-vivo human imaging at 10.5T: Imaging the body at 447 MHz.', 'A multitransmit external body array combined with a 1 H and 31 P endorectal coil to enable a multiparametric and multimetabolic MRI examination of the prostate at 7T.', 'Evolution of UHF Body Imaging in the Human Torso at 7T: Technology, Applications, and Future Directions.']"""

Methods:   Data on deaths (n = 2,585,012) caused by cancer between 1980 and 2006 were obtained from Sistema de Informações sobre Mortalidade (Mortality Information System), and demographic data were provided by Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics). The rates of overall cancer mortality and major types were corrected by proportionally redistributing 50% of ill-defined causes of death and standardizing them by age according to the standard world population. Trend curves for Brazil and its major regions were calculated for state capitals and other municipalities according to sex, and were evaluated by means of simple linear regression.  Results:   Among men, ascending mortality rates were observed for lung, prostate and colorectal cancer; declining rates for stomach cancer; and stable rates for esophagus cancer. Among women, mortality from breast, lung and colorectal cancer increased, and the rates for cervical and stomach cancer declined. Mortality evolution varied across the regions of Brazil, with distinct patterns between state capitals and other municipalities.  Conclusions:   The correction of mortality rates based on redistribution of ill-defined causes of death increased the magnitude of the overall cancer mortality in Brazil by approximately 10% in 1980 and 5% in 2006. In the inland municipalities no decrease or stability was identified, differently from what was observed in the state capitals.

We have shown previously that norepinephrine is a potent inducer of the migration of MDA-MB-468 human breast carcinoma cells and therefore investigated herein, whether the interaction of these cells as well as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435S human breast carcinoma cells with the vascular endothelium is affected by this neurotransmitter as well. By means of a flow-through assay under physiologic flow conditions, we show that norepinephrine induces an increase of the adhesion of the MDA-MB-231 cells, but not of MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-435S cells to human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC). The adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells was based on a norepinephrine-mediated release of GROα from HMVECs. GROα caused a β1-integrin-mediated increase of the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells. Most interestingly, this effect of norepinephrine, similar to the aforementioned induction of migration in MDA-MB-468 cells, was mediated by β-adrenergic receptors and therefore abrogated by β-blockers. In conclusion, norepinephrine has cell line-specific effects with regard to certain steps of the metastasis cascade, which are conjointly inhibited by clinically established β-blockers. Therefore, these results may deliver a molecular explanation for our recently published retrospective data analysis of patients with breast cancer which shows that β-blockers significantly reduce the development of metastases.""","""['Carina Strell', 'Bernd Niggemann', 'Melanie J Voss', 'Desmond G Powe', 'Kurt S Zänker', 'Frank Entschladen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Effects of Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen-specific peptide P-30 on beta-galactoside-mediated homotypic aggregation and adhesion to the endothelium of MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells.', 'CD44 cross-linking induces integrin-mediated adhesion and transendothelial migration in breast cancer cell line by up-regulation of LFA-1 (alpha L beta2) and VLA-4 (alpha4beta1).', 'Apigenin inhibits HGF-promoted invasive growth and metastasis involving blocking PI3K/Akt pathway and beta 4 integrin function in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.', 'The role of adrenergic signaling in breast cancer biology.', 'Metastatic tumor cell interactions with endothelium, basement membrane and tissue.', 'Involvement in Tumorigenesis and Clinical Significance of CXCL1 in Reproductive Cancers: Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Endometrial Cancer, Ovarian Cancer and Prostate Cancer.', 'The molecular mechanism of chronic stress affecting the occurrence and development of breast cancer and potential drug therapy.', 'Role of α- and β-adrenergic signaling in phenotypic targeting: significance in benign and malignant urologic disease.', 'Sympathetic activity in breast cancer and metastasis: partners in crime.', 'Norepinephrine inhibits migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cell cultures possibly via MMP-11 inhibition.']"""

Although it has been successfully treated with radiotherapy (RT) for decades, the priority of RT as a preferred treatment option has recently been disputed as tamoxifen was also demonstrated to be effective. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of indications, frequency, and technique of RT in daily practice in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.  Patients and methods:   On behalf of the DEGRO-AG GCG-BD (German Cooperative Group on Radiotherapy of Benign Diseases) a standardized questionnaire was sent to 294 RT institutions. The questionnaires inquired about patient numbers, indications, RT technique, dose, and - if available - treatment results. Moreover, the participants were asked whether they were interested in participating in a prospective study.  Results:   From a total of 294 institutions, 146 replies were received, of which 141 offered RT for gynecomastia. Seven of those reported prophylactic RT only, whereas 129 perform both preventive and symptomatic RT. In 110 of 137 departments, a maximum of 20 patients were treated per year. Electron beams (76%) were used most often, while 24% of patients received photon beams or orthovolt x-rays. Total doses were up to 20 Gy for prophylactic and up to 40 Gy for therapeutic RT. Results were reported by 19 departments: prevention of gynecomastia was observed in 60-100% of patients. Only 13 institutions observed side effects.  Conclusion:   Prophylactic and symptomatic RT is widely used in the German-speaking countries, but patient numbers are small. The clinical results indicate that RT is a highly effective and well-tolerated treatment.""","""['Burkhard Neu', 'Verena Sautter', 'Felix Momm', 'Ute Melcher', 'Heinrich Seegenschmiedt', 'Oliver Micke', 'Marie-Luise Sautter-Bihl']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Treatment strategies to prevent and reduce gynecomastia and/or breast pain caused by antiandrogen therapy for prostate cancer : Statement from the DEGRO working group prostate cancer.', 'Does prophylactic breast irradiation prevent antiandrogen-induced gynecomastia?

The experiments used a pelvic phantom and a variety of commercially available fiducial markers: CIVCO carbon marker of ϕ; 1 × 3 mm, gold seed markers of ϕ; 0.8 × 3 mm and ϕ; 1.2 × 3 mm, and IBA Visicoil helical gold linear markers in diameters of 0.35, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.15 mm. Two orthogonal on-board kV imagers were arranged for digital radiographic imaging of the phantom through the lateral and anterior-posterior directions. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for a given marker was calculated and used as a quantitative measure of its visibility. The patient entrance skin exposure (ESE) was measured and parameterized for kVp, mAs and source-to-surface distance. The ratio of CNR to ESE was first introduced to characterize the efficiency for imaging a marker using a given x-ray technique in order to optimize the marker's visibility and simultaneously minimize the x-ray imaging dose. If CNR > 2, which corresponds to a significance p < 0.05, is required for acceptable visibility, the carbon marker and the smallest Visicoil marker are not suitable for imaging through dense bone but the others are capable of being employed in the clinic. It is predicted that other markers in development should have a greater thickness than equivalent of 0.14 mm thick gold in order to produce the acceptable visibility in the lateral kV imaging. The linear Visicoil marker of ϕ; 0.50 × 5 mm is most suitable for kV imaging in the prostate for proton therapy as it induces the least proton dose perturbation amongst the acceptable markers. An optimal range of 120-130 kVp and 40-80 mAs is determined using the maximal CNR/ESE and CNR > 2 for laterally imaging this marker in the prostate.""","""['Yu Chen', ""John J O'Connell"", 'Christine J Ko', 'Rulon R Mayer', 'Arnaud Belard', 'James E McDonough']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Characterization of a novel liquid fiducial marker for multimodal image guidance in stereotactic body radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Dose perturbations and image artifacts caused by carbon-coated ceramic and stainless steel fiducials used in proton therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Determination of optimal fiducial marker across image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) modalities: visibility and artifact analysis of gold, carbon, and polymer fiducial markers.', 'Current modulated volume-of-interest imaging for kilovoltage intrafaction monitoring of the prostate.', 'Designing a Simple Fiducial Marker for Localization in Spatial Scenes Using Neural Networks.', 'A clinical study comparing polymer and gold fiducials for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'A phantom study to contrast and compare polymer and gold fiducial markers in radiotherapy simulation imaging.', ""A novel method for quantification of beam's-eye-view tumor tracking performance."", 'Qualitative evaluation of fiducial markers for radiotherapy imaging.']"""

Prostate biopsy, an invasive procedure is generally used for diagnoses but attempts are being made to find accurate and precise non-invasive biomarkers. Diagnostic accuracy of prostate specific antigen (PSA) has been well documented. Serum interleukin-18 (IL-18) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) have shown their diagnostic ability in other cancers but not investigated well in prostate cancer. This study, thus determines the diagnostic and prognostic significance of PSA, IL-18 and IL-10 prospectively in patients with carcinoma prostate.  Methods:   A total of 149 patients, aged 40-84 yrs were investigated during April 2007 to July 2010 and recruited for this study after Institutional ethical approval. Of the total of 149 patients, 71 had biopsy proven prostate cancers (TNM stage: T2=17, T3=26 and T4=28) and 78 clinical benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Peripheral blood samples of all patients and 71 age matched control subjects were obtained at baseline and estimation of PSA, IL-18 and IL-10 was done by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Carcinoma prostate patients were followed for three years. Data were analyzed with ANOVA, ROC curve analysis and survival analysis.  Results:   The baseline levels of PSA, IL-18 and IL-10 in all groups of carcinoma prostate were found to be significantly (p<0.01) higher than both Control and BPH. The levels of IL-18 and IL-10 also found to be elevated significantly in stage T3 (p<0.05) and T4 (p<0.01) as compared to stage T2. The levels especially of IL-18 is found to be well associated with progression of the disease of various groups (r=0.84, p<0.01). In contrast, IL-10 showed significant direct association with progression of carcinoma (r=0.84, p<0.01) while inverse relation with survival duration (r=-0.48, p<0.01) and survival rate (χ2=8.98, p=0.0027; Hazard ratio=0.37, 95% CI=0.18-0.69).

Materials:   We analyzed the medical records of 142 patients who underwent a radical prostatectomy from May 2009 until February of 2011. After exclusion of of them for defined criteria, preoperative PSA and its derivatives were analysed for their ability to predict unfavorable pathology after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   From the 105 patients included in the analysis, 23.8% had extraprostatic cancer extension, 8.6% had seminal vesicle involvement and positive surgical margins found in 38.1% of them. PSA density value >0.2 ng/ml2 was the solitary and most significant predictor for surgical margin status (p=0.015) and for extracapsular disease (p=0.050) as well, in multivariate analysis. Preoperative PSA was the only significant parameter for seminal vesicle invasion prediction (p=0.033). Both PSA velocity and ratio failed to reach predictive significance in all analyses.

Many studies have reported that specific components of food plants like soy phytoestrogens may have protective effects against prostate carcinogenesis or progression. Genistein and daidzein, the major phytoestrogens, have been reported to have the ability to reverse DNA hypermethylation in cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential demethylating effects of these two soy compounds on BRCA1, GSTP1, EPHB2 and BRCA2 promoter genes.  Methods & materials:   Prostate cell lines DU-145 and PC-3 were treated with genistein 40 µM, daidzein 110 µM, budesonide (methylating agent) 2 µM and 5-azacytidine (demethylating agent) 2 µM. In these two human prostate cancer cell lines we performed methylation quantification by using Methyl Profiler DNA methylation analysis. This technique is based on a methylation-specific digestion followed by quantitative PCR. We analyzed the corresponding protein expression by western blotting.  Results:   Soy phytoestrogens induced a demethylation of all promoter regions studied except for BRCA2, which is not methylated in control cell lines. An increase in their protein expression was also demonstrated by western blot analysis and corroborated the potential demethylating effect of soy phytoestrogens.  Conclusion:   This study showed that the soy phytoestrogens, genistein and daidzein, induce a decrease of methylation of BRCA1, GSTP1 and EPHB2 promoters. Therefore, soy phytoestrogens may have a protective effect on prostate cancer.

Sequential changes of prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase and pyridinoline cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen for the two groups versus pretreatment levels were compared. Prostate-specific antigen values in both groups significantly declined at 3, 6 and 12 months compared with pretreatment levels. However, the decline of the prostate-specific antigen was lower in the combined androgen blockade group. Alkaline phosphatase significantly declined at 6 and 12 months in the combination of combined androgen blockade and zoledronic acid group, with no significant changes seen in the combined androgen blockade group.

Deregulation of this balance leads to pathophysiological states that drive diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. The recent discovery of the PHLPP (pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase) family of Ser/Thr phosphatases adds a new player to the cast of phosphate-controlling enzymes in cell signaling. PHLPP isozymes catalyze the dephosphorylation of a conserved regulatory motif, the hydrophobic motif, on the AGC kinases Akt, PKC, and S6 kinase, as well as an inhibitory site on the kinase Mst1, to inhibit cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis. The frequent deletion of PHLPP in cancer, coupled with the development of prostate tumors in mice lacking PHLPP1, identifies PHLPP as a novel tumor suppressor.

Here, we report that Cav-1 was overexpressed in 41.7% (15 of 36) of human high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) specimens obtained during radical prostatectomies. Positive correlations exist between Cav-1-positive (Cav-1(+)) HGPIN and Cav-1(+) primary prostate cancer (rho = 0.655, P < 0.0001) and between Cav-1 and c-Myc expression in HGPIN (rho = 0.41, P = 0.032). To determine whether Cav-1 cooperates with c-Myc in development of premalignant lesions and prostate cancer in vivo, we generated transgenic mice with c-Myc overexpression driven by the ARR(2)PB promoter. In this ARR(2)PB-c-myc model, Cav-1 overexpression was found in mouse PIN (mPIN) lesions and prostate cancer cells and was associated with a significantly higher ratio of proliferative to apoptotic labeling in mPIN lesions than in the Cav-1-negative epithelia adjacent to those lesions (10.02 vs. 4.34; P = 0.007). Cav-1 overexpression was also associated with increased levels of P-Akt and VEGF-A, which were previously associated with Cav-1-induced prostate cancer cell survival and positive feedback regulation of cellular Cav-1 levels, respectively. In multiple prostate cancer cell lines, Cav-1 protein (but not mRNA) was induced by c-Myc transfection, whereas VEGF siRNA transfection abrogated c-Myc-induced Cav-1 overexpression, suggesting a c-Myc-VEGF-Cav-1 signaling axis.

Genetic markers predicting early-onset prostate cancer may provide clinically useful information to guide screening strategies for high-risk men. We evaluated clinical information from six polymorphisms associated with early-onset prostate cancer in a longitudinal cohort of high-risk men enrolled in prostate cancer early detection with significant African American participation.  Methods:   Eligibility criteria include ages 35 to 69 with a family history of prostate cancer or African American race. Participants undergo screening and biopsy per study criteria. Six markers associated with early-onset prostate cancer [rs2171492 (7q32), rs6983561 (8q24), rs10993994 (10q11), rs4430796 (17q12), rs1799950 (17q21), and rs266849 (19q13)] were genotyped. Cox models were used to evaluate time to prostate cancer diagnosis and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) prediction for prostate cancer by genotype. Harrell's concordance index was used to evaluate predictive accuracy for prostate cancer by PSA and genetic markers.  Results:   Four hundred and sixty participants with complete data and ≥ 1 follow-up visit were included. Fifty-six percent were African American. Among African American men, rs6983561 genotype was significantly associated with earlier time to prostate cancer diagnosis (P = 0.005) and influenced prediction for prostate cancer by the PSA (P < 0.001). When combined with PSA, rs6983561 improved predictive accuracy for prostate cancer compared with PSA alone among African American men (PSA = 0.57 vs. PSA + rs6983561 = 0.75, P = 0.03).  Conclusions:   Early-onset marker rs6983561 adds potentially useful clinical information for African American men undergoing prostate cancer risk assessment.

Without a DRE, many textbooks deem a clinical examination incomplete. On the other hand, patients as well as physicians often feel uncomfortable with this breach of privacy involving a DRE. Especially emergency rooms do not offer an atmosphere where a relationship with the necessary mutual trust can be built up. In this light, the objective of this analysis is to assess the evidence for DRE via a systematic search of the relevant literature.  Methods and results:   A systematic search in Pubmed, Medline coupled with manual research laid the basis for the evaluation of relevant publications from January 1990 to March 2010. Keywords for the search were: ""digital rectal examination"" in combination with ""acute abdominal pain"", ""acute abdomen"" or ""appendicitis"". From the raw data of relevant publications, we extracted results into contingency tables and completed missing data. Above all parameters, we determined the likelihood ratios (LR) with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals to assess test quality. Opinions in the evaluated literature and many national and international textbooks diverge significantly on the necessity of DRE. Six studies question the significance of DRE when evaluating patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain and appendicitis, respectively. Out of these studies, five are prospective and one is retrospective. Overall, the diagnostic test quality of DRE was low in all studies with LR + in the range from 0.78 to 1.61 and LR - from 0.91 to 1.29, respectively. No diagnostic relevance for DRE in combination with acute abdominal pain was found in these studies. Furthermore, in none of the reviewed cases did DRE have a relevant impact on management.  Conclusion:   The recommendation of generally applying DRE in the emergency room needs to be questioned critically. No evidence for the necessity and significance was found in the reviewed literature. Independently, these findings do not touch on the unequivocal indication of the DRE as a tool for assessing other specific conditions as well as screening for prostate or rectal cancer.""","""['J C Werner', 'M Zock', 'P N Khalil', 'J Hoffmann', 'K-G Kanz', 'K-W Jauch']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Zentralbl Chir""","""['Are digital rectal examinations obsolete?.', 'Response to the letter to the editor: ""are digital rectal examinations obsolete?"".', 'Utility of the digital rectal examination in the emergency department: a review.', 'Utility of the digital rectal examination in the evaluation of undifferentiated abdominal pain.', 'Significance of routine digital rectal examination in adults presenting with abdominal pain.', 'Acute abdominal pain in the emergency department - a clinical algorithm for adult patients.', 'The Role of Digital Rectal Examination for Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

The molecular coupling of the adaptor protein Crk to the docking protein p130(Cas) serves as a switch that regulates cell migration in several invasive cancer cells and Ack appears to act upstream of CrkII to modulate the cell motility. However, the precise role of Ack, Crk and p130(Cas) complex in prostate cancer migration remains unknown. In this study we examined the expression of Crk and p130(Cas) in prostate cancer cell lines, and found that CrkI and p130(Cas) protein level was higher in highly invasive PC-3M and PC-3 cell lines than in moderately invasive DU-145 cells. Upon shRNA mediated knockdown of CrkI and p130(Cas) in PC-3M cells, cell migration and invasion were significantly inhibited as analyzed by wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that p130(Cas) interacted with CrkI in PC-3M cells and the stability of p130(Cas) and CrkI depended on each other. AckI interacted with both CrkI and p130(Cas) and the interaction of AckI with CrkI seemed to be independent of p130(Cas) . Taken together, our results demonstrate the high expression of CrkI and p130(Cas) in invasive prostate cancer cells and the important role of CrkI/p130(Cas) complex in the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells.

Therefore, normalization of tumor blood vessels may be an important approach to increase therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of cancer patients. As blood vessels are supplied by sympathetic nerves containing dopamine (DA), and DA regulates functions of normal blood vessels through its receptors present in these vessels, we investigated the effect of DA on tumor vasculature. Here we report loss of sympathetic innervation and endogenous DA in abnormal and immature tumor blood vessels in malignant colon and prostate tumor tissues. In contrast, exogenous administration of DA normalizes the morphology and improves the functions of these vessels by acting on pericytes and endothelial cells, the two major cellular components of blood vessels. DA acts through its D(2) receptors present in these cells to up-regulate directly the expression of angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) in pericytes and the expression of the zinc finger transcriptional factor, Krüppel-like factor-2 (KLF2) in tumor endothelial cells. Importantly, this vessel stabilization by DA also significantly increases the concentration of anticancer drug in tumor tissues.

All subjects underwent digital rectal examination (DRE) and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). Data from the initial 849 subjects were used for development of the nomogram and those from the final 210 subjects were used for internal validation. External validation was conducted using data from two affiliated hospitals where the same adjusted biopsy method was used. The nomogram was developed through logistic regression analysis, and predictive accuracy and performance characteristics were assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics and calibration plots. Furthermore, we compared the predictive accuracy of the newly developed nomogram with the 'Prostate Risk Indicator' using the development data set, as well as the two external data sets.

A steady improvement in survival was seen both before and after the introduction of cancer control plans in 2000 and 2005. On the basis of data from 2007-2009, we studied the trend in 1-year survival after the introduction of the 2005 plan.  Material and methods:   All cancers from 1995-2009 were studied in five 3-year cohorts of incident cases which were followed-up for death to the end of 2010. Age-standardised 1-, 3- and 5-year relative survival was calculated and 1-year survival presented for 2004-2006 and 2007-2009 to allow comparison with our previous publication.  Results:   The improvement over time in overall 1-year age-standardised relative survival was maintained with a three percentage point increase to 72% for men and 75% for women. Exclusion of prostate and breast cancer from calculations lowered relative survival to 65% and 67%, respectively; but improvement was maintained. Cancer sites which previously enjoyed a high survival saw the least or no improvement as was the case for haematological cancers, except for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in men. The differences in survival between men and women are diminishing, especially for cancers of the digestive tract.  Conclusion:   The improvements over time in survival after introduction of the cancer plans were maintained for non-haematological cancers. The fast-track system for diagnosis and treatment introduced gradually by cancer sites until the end of 2008 along with some centralisation of elective surgery may have narrowed the gap in cancer survival between men and women for digestive tract cancers and may also have improved survival for other cancers, e.g. the sex-specific types and kidney and brain cancers.

Results:   Thirty-nine percent, 36%, and 25% were in low, intermediate, and high D'Amico risk categories. Thirty-three percent (31/95) had PSM. Overall, 269 tumor foci were identified. The incidence of PSM within lesions ≤ 0.5 cc and ≤ 0.2 cc was 1.2% (2/160) and 0% (0/132), respectively. Among the 71 multifocal cases, 19 (27%) exhibited PSM.

Methods:   In this study, we completed a meta-analysis of results from nine genome-wide association studies for seven types of solid-tumor cancers (breast, prostate, pancreatic, lung, ovarian, colon, and glioma) to identify additional associations that were not apparent in any individual study.  Results:   Fifteen SNPs in the 8q24 region had meta-analysis p-values < 1E-04.

Visualizing and modelling temporal trends of prostate cancer late-stage incidence, and how they vary according to geographic locations and race, should help explaining such disparities. Joinpoint regression is increasingly used to identify the timing and extent of changes in time series of health outcomes. Yet, most analyses of temporal trends are aspatial and conducted at the national level or for a single cancer registry.  Methods:   Time series (1981-2007) of annual proportions of prostate cancer late-stage cases were analyzed for non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks in each county of Florida. Noise in the data was first filtered by binomial kriging and results were modelled using joinpoint regression. A similar analysis was also conducted at the state level and for groups of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. Significant racial differences were detected using tests of parallelism and coincidence of time trends. A new disparity statistic was introduced to measure spatial and temporal changes in the frequency of racial disparities.  Results:   State-level percentage of late-stage diagnosis decreased 50% since 1981; a decline that accelerated in the 90's when Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) screening was introduced. Analysis at the metropolitan and non-metropolitan levels revealed that the frequency of late-stage diagnosis increased recently in urban areas, and this trend was significant for white males. The annual rate of decrease in late-stage diagnosis and the onset years for significant declines varied greatly among counties and racial groups. Most counties with non-significant average annual percent change (AAPC) were located in the Florida Panhandle for white males, whereas they clustered in South-eastern Florida for black males. The new disparity statistic indicated that the spatial extent of racial disparities reached a peak in 1990 because of an early decline in frequency of late-stage diagnosis observed for black males.  Conclusions:   Analyzing temporal trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates outside a spatial framework is unsatisfactory, since it leads one to overlook significant geographical variation which can potentially generate new insights about the impact of various interventions. Differences observed among nested geographies in Florida show how the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) also impacts the analysis of temporal changes.""","""['Pierre Goovaerts', 'Hong Xiao']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Health Geogr""","""['Analysis of geographical disparities in temporal trends of health outcomes using space-time joinpoint regression.', 'Geographic Variations of Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Late-Stage Diagnosis of Childhood Cancer in Texas.', 'The impact of place and time on the proportion of late-stage diagnosis: the case of prostate cancer in Florida, 1981-2007.', 'Racial disparities in prostate cancer among black men: epidemiology and outcomes.', 'Mortality Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups in the Veterans Health Administration: An Evidence Review and Map.', 'Spatial and temporal analysis of liver cancer mortality in Yunnan province, China, 2015-2019.', 'Temporal Trends in Notification and Mortality of Tuberculosis in China, 2004-2019: A Joinpoint and Age-Period-Cohort Analysis.', 'Participation of the hospitals in the Republic of Ireland in international research over more than a decade: a bibliometric analysis.', 'Geographical Variations in Prostate Cancer Outcomes: A Systematic Review of International Evidence.', 'Impact of Age, Race and Socio-economic Status on Temporal Trends in Late-Stage Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in Florida.']"""

A comparison study of conformal, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and single- and double-arc VMAT plans was undertaken to evaluate the dosimetric impact of this new technology in prostate cases. The research questions were as follows: how does VMAT dosimetry compare with IMRT and conformal plans?; does VMAT increase the volume of bowel receiving lower doses?; are one or two VMAT arcs required for standard prostate cases?  Methods:   Eight prostate cancer and post-prostatectomy patients were randomly selected for this study. Conformal, IMRT and single and double Arc VMAT plans were generated and dosimetric evaluations were performed. Each plan was prescribed a total of 75.6 Gy over a course of 42 fractions to the planning target volume (PTV).  Results:   The Healthy Tissue Conformity Index and the conformation number results revealed the IMRT and two VMAT techniques to have superior dosimetry to the PTV compared with the conformal plans. The maximum dose delivered to the PTV was significantly higher with the single-arc VMAT technique compared with the conformal or double-arc VMAT plans. There were no significant differences between the planning techniques for the bladder and small bowel dosimetry. However, IMRT and VMAT plans delivered less radiation to the rectum and femoral heads, and a single-arc VMAT plan was optimal for the right femoral head and the two VMAT techniques were optimal to the IMRT plans for the left femoral head.  Conclusions:   Single- and double-arc VMAT consistently resulted in favourable or slightly superior dosimetry when compared with static gantry IMRT for prostate cases.

Several randomized trials have shown that dose escalation to the entire prostate improves biochemical disease free survival. However, further dose escalation to the whole gland is limited due to an unacceptable high risk of acute and late toxicity. Moreover, local recurrences often originate at the location of the macroscopic tumor, so boosting the radiation dose at the macroscopic tumor within the prostate might increase local control. A reduction of distant metastases and improved survival can be expected by reducing local failure. The aim of this study is to investigate the benefit of an ablative microboost to the macroscopic tumor within the prostate in patients treated with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.  Methods/design:   The FLAME-trial (Focal Lesion Ablative Microboost in prostatE cancer) is a single blind randomized controlled phase III trial. We aim to include 566 patients (283 per treatment arm) with intermediate or high risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate who are scheduled for external beam radiotherapy using fiducial markers for position verification. With this number of patients, the expected increase in five-year freedom from biochemical failure rate of 10% can be detected with a power of 80%. Patients allocated to the standard arm receive a dose of 77 Gy in 35 fractions to the entire prostate and patients in the experimental arm receive 77 Gy to the entire prostate and an additional integrated microboost to the macroscopic tumor of 95 Gy in 35 fractions. The secondary outcome measures include treatment-related toxicity, quality of life and disease-specific survival.

To assist with identification of the urethrovesical junction and to facilitate placement of the markers, a Foley catheter was placed and the balloon was inflated. Gentle traction on the catheter seated the balloon at the bladder neck to echographically define the anatomy of the urethrovesical junction. Next, a rectal ultrasound probe was inserted into the rectum, allowing visualization of the region of the urethrovesical junction. Fiducial markers were then placed bilaterally in the detrusor muscle at the bladder neck or in the periurethral tissue using the applicator needle.

The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the impact of an outpatient palliative care (PC) consultation on symptoms in patients with advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 55 consecutive patients with advanced prostate cancer seen in our institution's outpatient PC center. Information regarding demographics, disease status, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) scores, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, laboratory data, and pharmacological interventions were analyzed.  Results:   The median age of the study's patients was 66 years old, with 73% Caucasian ethnicity. All patients had metastatic disease and 96% had received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. The most frequently occurring symptoms upon presentation were pain, fatigue, and drowsiness (>50%). Pain and fatigue were also the most severe symptoms, each having median ESAS scores of 7 (on a 0-10 scale). We instituted a median of 3 pharmacological interventions per patient, with a median of 15 days to follow-up assessment. At follow-up, patients reported significant symptom improvements in pain, drowsiness, fatigue, depression, sleep, sense of well-being, and anxiety.  Conclusions:   Based on our preliminary data, we conclude that patients with advanced prostate cancer referred to PC experience severe and clinically significant symptoms.

In stage 1, we conducted an in vitro prostate cancer cell cytotoxicity screen of 3,187 compounds. Digoxin emerged as the leading candidate given its potency in inhibiting proliferation in vitro (mean IC₅₀=163 nM) and common use. In stage 2, we evaluated the association between the leading candidate drug from stage 1 and prostate cancer risk in 47,884 men followed 1986-2006.

Interestingly, analysis of tissues revealed that 2 of 62 metastatic prostate cancers harbored aberrations at the KRAS locus. In DU145 cells, UBE2L3-KRAS produces a fusion protein, a specific knockdown of which attenuates cell invasion and xenograft growth. Ectopic expression of the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion protein exhibits transforming activity in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and RWPE prostate epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo.

In contrast, sera collected from elite athletes, exhibited titers of natural NTM1-reactive antibodies that are significantly increased, suggesting that physical activity boosts production of these antibodies.

To gain insight into the oncogenic activity of ERG, we compared the gene expression profile of NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing the coding regions of the three main ERG oncogenic fusions: TMPRSS2/ERG (tERG), EWS/ERG and FUS/ERG. We found that all three ERG fusions significantly up-regulate PIM1 expression in the NIH-3T3 cell line. PIM1 is a serine/threonine kinase frequently over-expressed in cancers of haematological and epithelial origin. We show here that tERG expression induces PIM1 in the non-malignant prostate cell line RWPE-1, strengthening the relation between tERG and PIM1 up-regulation in the initial stages of prostate carcinogenesis. Silencing of tERG reversed PIM1 induction. A significant association between ERG and PIM1 expression in clinical prostate carcinoma specimens was found, suggesting that such a mechanism may be relevant in vivo. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that tERG directly binds to PIM1 promoter in the RWPE-1 prostate cell line, suggesting that tERG could be a direct regulator of PIM1 expression.

This investigation was designed to determine if inhibition of this pathway could inhibit serous ovarian cancer growth.  Methodology:   We utilized an in vivo pre-clinical model of serous ovarian cancer to characterize the anti-tumor activity of Hh pathway inhibitors cyclopamine and a clinically applicable derivative, IPI-926. Primary human serous ovarian tumor tissue was used to generate tumor xenografts in mice that were subsequently treated with cyclopamine or IPI-926.  Principal findings:   Both compounds demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity as single agents. When IPI-926 was used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatinum (T/C), no synergistic effect was observed, though sustained treatment with IPI-926 after cessation of T/C continued to suppress tumor growth. Hh pathway activity was analyzed by RT-PCR to assess changes in Gli1 transcript levels. A single dose of IPI-926 inhibited mouse stromal Gli1 transcript levels at 24 hours with unchanged human intra-tumor Gli1 levels. Chronic IPI-926 therapy for 21 days, however, inhibited Hh signaling in both mouse stromal and human tumor cells. Expression data from the micro-dissected stroma in human serous ovarian tumors confirmed the presence of Gli1 transcript and a significant association between elevated Gli1 transcript levels and worsened survival.

This irreversible activation mechanism leads to rapid receptor desensitization by internalisation and degradation. We have explored the role of palmitoylation, the post-translational addition of palmitate, in PAR2 signalling, trafficking, cell surface expression and desensitization. Experiments using the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate indicated that palmitate addition is important in trafficking of PAR2 endogenously expressed by prostate cancer cell lines. This was supported by palmitate labelling using two approaches, which showed that PAR2 stably expressed by CHO-K1 cells is palmitoylated and that palmitoylation occurs on cysteine 361. Palmitoylation is required for optimal PAR2 signalling as Ca²⁺ flux assays indicated that in response to trypsin agonism, palmitoylation deficient PAR2 is ∼9 fold less potent than wildtype receptor with a reduction of about 33% in the maximum signal induced via the mutant receptor. Confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and cell surface biotinylation analyses demonstrated that palmitoylation is required for efficient cell surface expression of PAR2. We also show that receptor palmitoylation occurs within the Golgi apparatus and is required for efficient agonist-induced rab11a-mediated trafficking of PAR2 to the cell surface. Palmitoylation is also required for receptor desensitization, as agonist-induced β-arrestin recruitment and receptor endocytosis and degradation were markedly reduced in CHO-PAR2-C361A cells compared with CHO-PAR2 cells. These data provide new insights on the life cycle of PAR2 and demonstrate that palmitoylation is critical for efficient signalling, trafficking, cell surface localization and degradation of this receptor.""","""['Mark N Adams', 'Melinda E Christensen', 'Yaowu He', 'Nigel J Waterhouse', 'John D Hooper']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Protein kinase D and Gβγ mediate sustained nociceptive signaling by biased agonists of protease-activated receptor-2.', 'Protein Kinase D and Gβγ Subunits Mediate Agonist-evoked Translocation of Protease-activated Receptor-2 from the Golgi Apparatus to the Plasma Membrane.', 'Multiple independent functions of arrestins in the regulation of protease-activated receptor-2 signaling and trafficking.', 'Role for β-arrestin in mediating paradoxical β2AR and PAR2 signaling in asthma.', 'Palmitoylation as a Signal for Delivery.', 'Emerging roles of protein palmitoylation and its modifying enzymes in cancer cell signal transduction and cancer therapy.', 'Post-Translational Modifications of G Protein-Coupled Receptors Control Cellular Signaling Dynamics in Space and Time.', 'Role of the Helix-8 and C-Terminal Tail in Regulating Proteinase Activated Receptor 2 Signaling.', 'Agonist-induced membrane nanodomain clustering drives GLP-1 receptor responses in pancreatic beta cells.', 'Palmitic acid is an intracellular signaling molecule involved in disease development.']"""

Where a TCC of the bladder was diagnosed, the patient underwent TUR-BT. In other cases (stones, BPH etc.) the appropriate therapeutic pathway was followed.  Results:   25.3% of patients with hematuria were found to have a bladder cancer; 21.3% had a urinary stone (2% in the bladder); 1.3% had prostate cancer; 1.3% had a renal cell carcinoma. The mean age was 69.8 yrs. 6% of the patients (23.6% on patients with TCC of the bladder) had a G3 disease. The mean time from admission to the HOSC until the operation day, in case of TCC of the bladder, was 10.61 days.  Conclusions:   The Italian experience of the One Stop Clinic confirms a high rate of bladder cancer detection. Furthermore, a high rate of non-malignant conditions was detected, stressing the importance of the HOSC not only as a cancer clinic but as a complete general urological clinic. We report a shorter waiting time to operation, especially for bladder TCC G3 patients.""","""['Luca Carmignani', 'Giorgio Bozzini', 'Vincenzo Nicosia', 'Massimo Consentino', 'Stefano Picozzi', 'Stefano Casellato', 'Luca Lunelli']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['A prospective analysis of 1,930 patients with hematuria to evaluate current diagnostic practice.', 'Transitional cell carcinoma in renal transplant recipients.', 'Evaluation of diagnostic strategies for bladder cancer using computed tomography (CT) urography, flexible cystoscopy and voided urine cytology: results for 778 patients from a hospital haematuria clinic.', 'Evaluation of microscopic hematuria: a critical review and proposed algorithm.', 'Multiple primary malignant neoplasms: case report and a comprehensive review of the literature.']"""

The possible impact on oncological outcome of non-acinar prostate cancer has not been established yet, especially for ductal adenocarcinoma due to its low frequency, so that its clinical management is not well codified. The disease occurs more often already at an advanced stage of diagnosis, with clinically detectable tumors and advanced pathological stage, partly because of the lack of specific tumor markers, given the poor correlation between PDA and PSA values. In the period between 1997 and 2010 56 patients with PDA on a total of 1265 new diagnoses of cancer were identified, for an overall incidence of 4.5%. 41 patients (75%) had a PDA type II histology, while 15 patients (25%) a PDA type I (pure form). Generally, a surgical treatment was carried out in patients with life expectancy greater than 10/15 years/under 70 years of age, non-metastatic tumors and found to be liable to local resection; radiation therapy was given with 70 Gy in cases with a shorter life expectancy and/or an illness judged unresectable for local extension; hormonal therapy was indicated in all other clinical situations. For all patients, the clinical and pathologic data and follow-ups were re-evaluated. The overall survival and disease-free survival were then analyzed. Given the low incidence of this pathology the relevant literature is poor and therefore the therapeutic approach is not univocal.

During an elastography examination, various strain images of lesions are observed, and a suitable classification of strain patterns (SP) may provide vital diagnostic information about lesions. Numerous studies have shown that ultrasound elastography can improve the detection of prostate cancer, but the diagnostic value of SP classification has not yet been fully evaluated.  Purpose:   To investigate the contribution of SP on the characterization of prostate peripheral zone lesions by transrectal real-time tissue elastography (TRTE) in combination with conventional transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS).  Material and methods:   One hundred and seventy-one patients with suspected prostate cancer underwent TRUS and TRTE examinations. The SPs of the suspicious lesions were classified into five scores by TRTE according to the degree and distribution of strain. All findings were confirmed by transrectal systematic 12-core biopsies and targeted biopsies for suspicious areas detecting by TRUS and/or TRTE.  Results:   One hundred and forty-eight of 171 patients had high-quality TRTE imaging and were included into the study. When a cut-off point of SP score III was used, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was, respectively, 0.75 (95% CI: 0.67-0.83), 0.85 (95% CI: 0.78-0.91) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.77-0.91) for the diagnosis of prostate cancer by TRUS, TRTE and TRTE + TRUS. A linear tendency of SP and Gleason scores was observed in scores III-V. The detection rate of prostate cancer using TRTE-targeted biopsy (75.8%) was significantly higher than that of systematic 12-core biopsy plus TRUS-targeted biopsy (14.5%) (P = 0.00).  Conclusion:   This study suggests the significant contribution of SP on characterization of prostate peripheral zone lesions and the improvement of TRTE-targeted biopsy on detection of prostate cancer.""","""['Yan Zhang', 'Jie Tang', 'Yan-mi Li', 'Xiang Fei', 'En-hui He', 'Qiu-yang Li', 'Huai-yin Shi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Acta Radiol""","""['The utility of transrectal real-time elastography in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Transrectal real-time tissue elastography combined with grey-scale ultrasound: valuable for the diagnosis of prostate peripheral zone lesions.', 'Differentiation of prostate cancer from benign lesions using strain index of transrectal real-time tissue elastography.', 'Role of transrectal ultrasonography in prostate cancer.', 'Elastography in prostate gland imaging and prostate cancer detection.', 'Prostate cancer rates in patients with initially negative elastography-targeted biopsy vs. systematic biopsy.', 'Elevated hardness of peripheral gland on real-time elastography is an independent marker for high-risk prostate cancers.', 'Clinical practice guidelines for ultrasound elastography: prostate.', 'Alterations in mechanical properties are associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Real-time elastography for the detection of prostate cancer.']"""

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the expression of MMP-9 and its specific inhibitors, TIMP-1 and RECK, are expressed in a reproducible, specific pattern and if the profiles are related to prognosis and clinical outcome in prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   MMP-9, TIMP-1, and RECK expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in fresh-frozen malignant tissue specimens collected from 79 patients with clinically localized PC submitted to radical prostatectomy (RP). Frozen benign prostatic tissue from another 10 men with prostate cancer, also submitted to RP, was analyzed to determine if the profile of gene expression was maintained. The control group consisted of 11 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).  Results:   In the tumor samples, MMP-9 was overexpressed by 9.2 times, and TIMP-1 and RECK were underexpressed (0.75 and 0.80 times, respectively). Overexpression of MMP-9 was significantly related to PSA levels above 10 ng/mL (p=0.033). In addition, MMP-9 overexpression was related to biochemical recurrence, with a marginal statistical significance (p=0.089). MMP-9 was also overexpressed in benign tissues of patients with PC, as were TIMP-1 and RECK, in contrast to their underexpression in tumor samples.  Conclusion:   Our results show that MMP-9 is overexpressed and its negative regulators are underexpressed in PC tissue, emphasizing a possible role of MMP-9 in the carcinogenesis process. Additionally, we noticed a relationship between MMP-9 overexpression and increased levels of PSA, an important prognostic factor.

Analyzing HODs in the tumors of 244 patients from two independent cohorts and 22 PCa xenografts using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, herein we report the identification of CHD1, a chromatin remodeler, as one of the most frequently homozygously deleted genes in PCa, second only to PTEN in this regard. The HODs observed in CHD1, including deletions affecting only internal exons of CHD1, were found to completely extinguish the expression of mRNA of this gene in PCa xenografts. Loss of this chromatin remodeler in clinical specimens is significantly associated with an increased number of additional chromosomal deletions, both hemi- and homozygous, especially on 2q, 5q and 6q. Together with the deletions observed in HEK293 cells stably transfected with CHD1 small hairpin RNA, these data suggest a causal relationship. Downregulation of Chd1 in mouse prostate epithelial cells caused dramatic morphological changes indicative of increased invasiveness, but did not result in transformation.

On the other hand, it is not certain what effect excess dietary methyl groups could have on cancer. This is especially true for prostate cancer, a disease that is characterized by increasing DNA methylation changes with increasing grade of the cancer. In this three-part study in animals, we look at (i) the effect of excess methyl donors on the growth rate of prostate cancer in vivo, (ii) the ability of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AdC), a demethylating agent, to demethylate in the presence of excess dietary methyl donors, and (iii) the effect of in utero feeding of excess methyl donors to the later onset of prostate cancer. The results show that when mice are fed a dietary excess of methyl donors, we do not see (i) an increase in the growth rate of DU-145 and PC-3 xenografts in vivo, or (ii) interference in the ability of AdC to demethylate the promoters of androgen receptor or Reprimo of prostate cancer xenografts but (iii) a protective effect on the development of higher grades of prostate cancer in the ""Hi-myc"" mouse model of prostate cancer which were fed the increased methyl donors in utero.

FOXA1 expression did not differ significantly between benign glands from the peripheral zone and primary peripheral zone prostate carcinomas. However, FOXA1 was overexpressed in metastases and particularly in castration-resistant cases, but was expressed at lower levels in both normal and neoplastic transitional zone tissues. FOXA1 levels correlated with higher pT stages and Gleason scores, as well as with androgen (AR) and estrogen receptor expression. Moreover, FOXA1 overexpression was associated with faster biochemical disease progression, which was pronounced in patients with low AR levels. Finally, siRNA-based knockdown of FOXA1 induced decreased cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, in vitro tumorigenicity was inducible by ARs only in the presence of FOXA1, substantiating a functional cooperation between FOXA1 and AR.

Targeting the tumorigenic cancer stem cells (CSCs) with self-renewal and differentiation capacity appears to be a promising strategy. Blockade of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, an important pathway involved in stem cell self-renewal, by cyclopamine leads to long-term prostate cancer regression without recurrence, strongly suggesting the connection between Hh pathway and prostate CSCs. Here we designed an HPMA (N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide)-based cyclopamine delivery system as a CSC-selective macromolecular therapeutics with improved drug solubility and decreased systemic toxicity. To this end, HPMA and N-methacryloylglycylphenylalanylleucylglycyl thiazolidine-2-thione were copolymerized using the RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer) process, followed by polymer-analogous attachment of cyclopamine. The selectivity of the conjugate toward CSCs was evaluated on RC-92a/hTERT cells, the human prostate cancer epithelial cells with human telomerase reverse transcriptase transduction. The use of RC-92a/hTERT cells as an in vitro CSC model was validated by stem cell marker expression and prostasphere culture. The bioactivity of cyclopamine was retained after conjugation to the polymer.

Methods and materials:   Our study included 133 patients, 102 still disease free (Group A) and 31 who experienced proven biochemical recurrence (Group B). PSA levels before and after (125)I brachytherapy were recorded, and PSA percentage vs. pretreatment values were calculated.

Results:   We observed that, in patients submitted to brachytherapy for prostate cancer, a PSA percentage >20% of pretreatment value is highly associated with relapse risk (p<0.0001) and that this association is strongly present since t=6 months of followup (p<0.0001), with a hazard ratio near to five times (4.965), a sensitivity of 72.4%, and specificity of 79.8% related to the chosen cutoff.  Discussion:   Despite the amount of PSA is the only parameter that the clinicians can deploy to monitor patient's followup after permanent interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer, its evolution in time seems unable to predict early biochemical relapse as it is influenced by prostatic volume and initial PSA amount.

Radionuclide molecular imaging of HER2 expression in disseminated PC would aid in the selection of patients who are likely responders to HER2 targeting therapy. In this study, we evaluated whether ABY-025 Affibody molecule, a small (∼ 7-kDa) HER2-binding scaffold protein, produces superior tumor-to-nontumor ratios compared with those obtained through the use of radiolabeled humanized anti-HER2 antibody, trastuzumab. The influence of (111)In vs. (125)I radiolabel was evaluated for both tracers.  Methods:   ABY-025 was labeled with (111)In using 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid chelator, site-specifically coupled to the C-terminus via the maleimido derivative. Trastuzumab was labeled with (111)In using a CHX-A″ diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelator. An indirect radioiodination with [(125)I]-N-succinimidyl-para-iodobenzoate was used for both targeting proteins. Biodistribution of all labeled targeting proteins was evaluated in mice bearing DU-145 PC xenografts.  Results:   The use of residualizing (111)In-label facilitated better tumor uptake and better tumor-to-nontumor ratios for both targeting agents. [(111)In]-ABY-025 provided tumor uptake of 7.1±0.8% injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) and tumor-to-blood ratio of 47±13 already at 6 h postinjection. The maximum tumor-to-nontumor ratios with [(111)In]-CHX-DTPA-trastuzumab were achieved at 72 h postinjection, whereas tumor uptake was 11±4% ID/g and tumor-to-blood ratio was 18±7. The biodistribution data were confirmed with gamma-camera imaging.  Conclusions:   Radiolabeled ABY-025 Affibody molecule provides higher contrast in imaging of HER2-expressing PC xenografts than radiolabeled trastuzumab.

Lycopene (10 μM) in the presence of a specific antagonist of PPARγ (GW9662) or of LXRα (GGPP) restored the proliferation of DU145 cells and significantly suppressed lycopene-induced protein and mRNA expression of PPARγ and LXRα and cholesterol efflux. Liver X receptor α knockdown by siRNA against LXRα significantly promoted the proliferation of DU145 cells, whereas si-LXRα knockdown followed by incubation with lycopene (10 μM) restored the proliferation to the control level.

Methods and materials:   All patients who received either brachytherapy alone (implant) or brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiation therapy for treatment of localized prostate cancer at The Mount Sinai Hospital between June 1990 and March 2007 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were included. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed on the following variables: risk group, Gleason score (GS), clinical T stage, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, post-treatment prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT), treatment type (implant vs. implant plus external beam radiation therapy), treatment era, total biological effective dose, use of androgen deprivation therapy, age at diagnosis, and race. PSA-DT was analyzed in the following ordinate groups: 0 to 90 days, 91 to 180 days, 180 to 360 days, and greater than 360 days.  Results:   We included 1,887 patients in this study. Metastases developed in 47 of these patients. The 10-year freedom from distant metastasis (FFDM) rate for the entire population was 95.1%. Median follow-up was 6 years (range, 2-15 years). The only two significant predictors of metastatic disease by multivariable analyses were GS and PSA-DT (p < 0.001 for both variables).

Estimated FFDM rates for PSA-DT of 0 to 90 days, 91 to 180 days, 181 to 360 days, and greater than 360 days were 17.5%, 67.9%, 74%, and 94.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). Estimated 10-year FFDM rates for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 98.6%, 96.2%, and 86.7%, respectively. A demographic shift to patients presenting with higher-grade disease in more recent years was observed.  Conclusions:   GS and post-treatment PSA-DT are both statistically significant independent predictors of metastatic disease. Patients with a high GS and/or short PSA-DT have a higher likelihood of developing metastatic disease and should be considered for systemic therapy.""","""['Kevin Forsythe', 'Ryan Burri', 'Nelson Stone', 'Richard G Stock']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['PSA nadir of <0.5 ng/mL following brachytherapy for early-stage prostate adenocarcinoma is associated with freedom from prostate-specific antigen failure.', 'Radiation dose predicts for biochemical control in intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Distant metastases following permanent interstitial brachytherapy for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Ten-year disease free survival after transperineal sonography-guided iodine-125 brachytherapy with or without 45-gray external beam irradiation in the treatment of patients with clinically localized, low to high Gleason grade prostate carcinoma.', 'Prostate-specific antigen bounce after permanent seed prostate brachytherapy: a literature review.', 'Patient age as a predictive factor in biochemical recurrence following brachytherapy: Oncological outcomes at a single center.', 'Perioperative Search for Circulating Tumor Cells in Patients Undergoing Prostate Brachytherapy for Clinically Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparing CTVs for permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Pulmonary metastases after low-dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Predictors of distant metastasis after combined HDR brachytherapy and external beam radiation for prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   In 48 patients treated for localized prostate cancer, the internal anal sphincter (IAS) muscle, the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle, the puborectalis muscle (PRM), and the levator ani muscles (LAM) in addition to the anal wall (Awall) and rectal wall (Rwall) were retrospectively delineated on planning computed tomography scans. Dose parameters were obtained and compared between patients with and without fecal urgency, incontinence, and frequency. Dose-effect curves were constructed. Finally, the effect of an endorectal balloon, which was applied in 28 patients, was investigated.  Results:   The total volume of the pelvic floor muscles together was about three times that of the Awall. The PRM was exposed to the highest RT dose, whereas the EAS received the lowest dose. Several anal and rectal dose parameters, as well as doses to all separate pelvic floor muscles, were associated with urgency, while incontinence was associated mainly with doses to the EAS and PRM. Based on the dose-effect curves, the following constraints regarding mean doses could be deduced to reduce the risk of urgency: ≤ 30 Gy to the IAS; ≤ 10 Gy to the EAS; ≤ 50 Gy to the PRM; and ≤ 40 Gy to the LAM. No dose-effect relationships for frequency were observed. Patients treated with an endorectal balloon reported significantly less urgency and incontinence, while their treatment plans showed significantly lower doses to the Awall, Rwall, and all pelvic floor muscles.  Conclusions:   Incontinence-related complaints show specific dose-effect relationships to individual pelvic floor muscles. Dose constraints for each muscle can be identified for RT planning.

Methods:   Ten patients were considered in this study. A commercially available tool for compartmental analysis (SAAM II) was used to model the values of activity concentrations in organs and tissues obtained from PET images or from measurements of collected blood and urine samples.  Results:   A linear compartmental model of the biokinetics of the radiopharmaceutical was initially developed. It features a central compartment (blood) exchanging with organs. The structure describes explicitly liver, kidneys, spleen, blood and urinary excretion. The linear model tended to overestimate systematically the activity in the liver and in the kidney compartments in the first 20 min post-administration. A nonlinear process of kinetic saturation was considered, according to the typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Therefore nonlinear equations were added to describe the flux of (18)F-choline from blood to liver and from blood to kidneys. The nonlinear model showed a tendency for improvement in the description of the activity in liver and kidneys, but not for the urine.  Conclusions:   The simple linear model presented is not able to properly describe the biokinetics of (18)F-choline as measured in prostatic cancer patients.

The differential sensitivity of tumour cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis can be mediated by the modulation of surface TRAIL receptor expression related to androgen concentration. Our previous results led to the hypothesis that downregulation of TRAIL-decoy receptor DcR2 expression following androgen deprivation would leave hormone sensitive normal prostate cells vulnerable to the cell death signal generated by TRAIL via its pro-apoptotic receptors. We tested this hypothesis under pathological conditions by exploring the regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis related to their death and decoy receptor expression, as also to hormonal concentrations in androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer, LNCaP, cells.  Results:   In contrast to androgen-insensitive PC3 cells, decoy (DcR2) and death (DR5) receptor protein expression was correlated with hormone concentrations and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. Silencing of androgen-sensitive DcR2 protein expression by siRNA led to a significant increase in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis related to androgen concentration in LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   The data support the hypothesis that hormone modulation of DcR2 expression regulates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, giving insight into cell death induction in apoptosis-resistant hormone-sensitive tumour cells from prostate cancer.

Objective:   This study was undertaken to characterize the volatile constituents of the leaf and fruit essential oils of S. erianthum and S. macranthum; their antimicrobial and in vitro cytotoxic bioassay against human breast and prostate tumor cells.  Methods:   The volatile oils were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed for their constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) were determined using the microbroth dilution technique while the cytotoxic potentials were evaluated using the Cell Titre 96((R)) AQ(ueous) Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay method.  Results:   Solanum erianthum essential oils were characterized by the abundance of α-terpinolene (17.8%), α-phellandrene (17.5%), p-cymene (15.7%) and β-pinene (11.7%) in the leaves; α-humulene (23.1%), humulene epoxide II (20.0%), caryophyllene oxide (16.5%), methyl salicylate (11.8%) and β-caryophyllene (10.9%) in the fruits.

In most normal tissues, NSUN2 expression levels were extremely low. On the other hand, oral and colorectal cancers typically expressed high levels of NSUN2. The level of NSUN2 was similar in interphase and mitotic cells, and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated strong staining for NSUN2 in oral and colon cancer tissues when compared with normal tissues, providing a distinct diagnostic significance for NSUN2 in comparison with Ki-67, a widely used marker of actively proliferating cells. In addition, elevated protein expression of NSUN2 was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of various cancers including esophageal, stomach, liver, pancreas, uterine cervix, prostate, kidney, bladder, thyroid, and breast cancers.

Methods:   To identify autoantibody signatures as biomarkers, a native antigen reverse capture microarray platform was used. Briefly, well-characterized monoclonal antibodies were arrayed onto nanoparticle slides to capture native antigens from prostate cancer cells. Prostate cancer patient serum samples (n=41) and BPH patient samples (collected starting at the time of initial diagnosis) with a mean follow-up of 6.56 y without the diagnosis of cancer (n=39) were obtained.

Receiver operating characteristic curves were produced and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined.  Results:   Using our microarray platform, we identified autoantibody signatures capable of distinguishing between prostate cancer and BPH. The top 5 autoantibody signatures were TARDBP, TLN1, PARK7, LEDGF/PSIP1, and CALD1.

The diagnosis of prostate cancer often leads to radical therapy in men who would never have known they had the disease if not for early detection. Although it is possible that 5-ARIs may occasionally cause a high-grade prostate cancer, the magnitude of this potential harm is likely to be tempered by earlier detection. Also balancing this potential harm is the well-established fact that the 5-ARIs decrease the likelihood that a man who desires PSA testing will become a prostate cancer patient.

It is generally accepted in the medical community that total and intra-operative blood loss after RALP is significantly lower in comparison with ORRP. This has led to speculation that less bleeding results in better visualization of the operative field resulting in superior potency and continence. Blood loss (BL) during ORRP does not adversely impact clinical and functional outcomes irrespective of how BL is defined. Thus, the lower BL associated with RALP would not be expected to improve functional or oncological outcomes.  Objective:   To determine the short- and long-term impact of blood loss (BL) on clinical, oncological and functional outcomes as well as complication rates after an open radical retropubic prostatectomy (ORRP).  Patients and methods:   Between 2000 and 2008, 1567 men who underwent an ORRP participated in our prospective longitudinal outcomes study. Haematocrit (Hct) levels, transfusion rates, BL and complications were recorded prospectively. Validated, self-administered quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires were completed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months and yearly thereafter. Urinary function and erectile dysfunction were assessed using AUA Symptom Score and the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index and analysis of variance (anova)/chi-square tests were used to compare clinical, BL, biochemical recurrence (BCR) and QoL outcomes amongst the three groups for continuous/categorical variables.  Results:   The mean estimated BL was 742.7 (45 to 3500) mL and 5.4% and 3.8% received an autologous (AU) or allogeneic (AL) blood transfusions, respectively. The average baseline, induction, postoperative and discharge Hct was 43.8%, 48.3%, 35.7% and 34.1%, respectively. The estimated BL and the rate of change of Hct correlated moderately (r=0.41, P<0.0001). Tertiles of BL were based on the difference between induction and discharge Hct (Delta 1) and the average Delta 1 for Groups 1, 2 and 3 were 7.9%, 12.7% and 17.2%, respectively. Intra-operative, early/delayed complications, length of hospital stay (LoS), SM surgical margins status, anastomotic stricture and BCR were not statistically different (P<0.001) and the mean AUASS, UCLA Prostate Cancer urinary bother scores, urinary function scores, sexual bother/function scores at 24 months were similar amongst all tertiles (P>0.05).

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of low doses of Se on the stimulation of DNA repair systems in response to four different qualities of DNA damage. P53-proficient LNCaP human prostate adenocarcinoma cells were grown either untreated or in the presence of low concentrations of two Se compounds (30° nM sodium selenite, or 10 μM selenomethionine) and exposed to UVA, H2O2, methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) or UVC.

Overall, Se was shown to be a very potent protector against cell toxicity and genotoxicity induced by oxidative stress (UVA or H2O2) but not from the agents that induce other types of deleterious lesions (MMS or UVC). Furthermore, Se-treated cells exhibited increased oxidative DNA repair activity, indicating a novel mechanism of Se action.

Higher anxiety related to uncertainty surrounding cancer has been shown to increase the likelihood of choosing active treatment in the absence of a clinical indication. Certain characteristics, including physician influence and a neurotic personality, may also increase the risk of psychological distress. Our study identified particular areas that may affect the degree of satisfaction or uncertainty experienced by men choosing active surveillance. We showed that men with a positive outlook who perceived that they were receiving consistent medical information had improved ability to manage uncertainty and felt more in control of their decision-making. Men who were confident in their ability to manage prostate-related symptoms also had less insecurity with their decision.  Objective:   To understand the factors associated with decision-making, we conducted a telephone-based survey as part of a pilot study to develop a psychoeducational intervention for men with prostate cancer who undergo active surveillance.  Patients and methods:   From 2007 to 2008, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 34 individuals on active surveillance for prostate cancer. We examined how specific mental health, quality of life and sociodemographic characteristics relate to decision-making. Five validated decision-making scales were used as primary outcomes reflecting the amount of satisfaction, regret and conflict a participant experienced about his decision to undergo active surveillance. A multivariate regression model was developed to identify specific psychosocial factors related to the decision-making outcomes.  Results:   Primary analyses focused on the decisional satisfaction and conflict measures, as the decisional regret measure showed poor reliability (α < 0.70) in this sample. Four psychosocial measures showed strong associations across the decision-making subscales, including the Fife Constructed Meaning Scale (Pearson r > 0.26), Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale - Inconsistency (r > 0.32), Mental Health Index-5 (r > 0.33), and Lepore self-efficacy for prostate symptom management scale (r > 0.33). Individuals with higher self-efficacy for prostate cancer symptom management (P = 0.02) and higher positive meaning for cancer (P = 0.03) were less likely to express decision-making conflict as the result of uncertainty. Individuals reporting higher positive meaning for cancer (P = 0.01) and less uncertainty in illness attributed to inconsistency (P = 0.02) were less likely to exhibit decision-making conflict related to the perceived effectiveness of treatment.  Conclusions:   Men choosing active surveillance represent a patient group with unique vulnerabilities that require new psychoeducational interventions to provide information and support that will maintain and improve quality of life.

Objective:   Our objective was to determine the impact of abiraterone with and without dexamethasone treatment on in vivo steroidogenesis.  Design and methods:   We treated 42 castrate, castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with continuous, daily abiraterone acetate and prospectively collected blood and urine before and during abiraterone treatment and after addition of dexamethasone 0.5 mg daily.  Results:   Treatment with single-agent abiraterone acetate was associated with accumulation of steroids with mineralocorticoid properties upstream of CYP17A1. This resulted in side effects, including hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid overload, in 38 of 42 patients that were generally treated effectively with eplerenone. Importantly, serum and urinary androgens were suppressed by more than 90% from baseline. Urinary metabolites of 17-hydroxypregnenolone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone downstream of 17α-hydroxylase remained unchanged. However, 3α5α-17-hydroxypregnanolone, which can be converted via the backdoor pathway toward 5α-dihydrotestosterone, increased significantly and correlated with levels of the major 5α-dihydrotestosterone metabolite androsterone. In contrast, urinary metabolites of 11-deoxycortisol and active glucocorticoids declined significantly. Addition of dexamethasone to abiraterone acetate significantly suppressed ACTH and endogenous steroids, including 3α5α-17-hydroxypregnanolone.  Conclusion:   CYP17A1 inhibition with abiraterone acetate is characterized by significant suppression of androgen and cortisol synthesis. The latter is associated with a rise in ACTH that causes raised mineralocorticoids, leading to side effects and incomplete 17α-hydroxylase inhibition. Concomitant inhibition of 17,20-lyase results in diversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone metabolites toward androgen synthesis via the backdoor pathway. Addition of dexamethasone reverses toxicity and could further suppress androgens by preventing a rise in substrates of backdoor androgen synthesis.""","""['Gerhardt Attard', 'Alison H M Reid', 'Richard J Auchus', 'Beverly A Hughes', 'Amy Mulick Cassidy', 'Emilda Thompson', 'Nikhil Babu Oommen', 'Elizabeth Folkerd', 'Mitch Dowsett', 'Wiebke Arlt', 'Johann S de Bono']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['Intratumoral de novo steroid synthesis activates androgen receptor in castration-resistant prostate cancer and is upregulated by treatment with CYP17A1 inhibitors.', 'Selective inhibition of CYP17 with abiraterone acetate is highly active in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Resistance to CYP17A1 inhibition with abiraterone in castration-resistant prostate cancer: induction of steroidogenesis and androgen receptor splice variants.', 'Abiraterone acetate: a novel therapeutic option in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Androgen synthesis inhibitors in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Exploring the Chemical Space of CYP17A1 Inhibitors Using Cheminformatics and Machine Learning.', 'How to Improve the Quality of Life of Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Hormone Therapy?', 'Adrenal Steroids and Resistance to Hormonal Blockade of Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Androgen Metabolism and Response in Prostate Cancer Anti-Androgen Therapy Resistance.']"""

Thirty-four patients received 7.5 grays (Gy) delivered in 5 fractions, 9 patients received 7.25 Gy delivered in 5 fractions, and 2 patients received other regimens. The variables evaluated were biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) bounce, and toxicities. Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM), American Urological Association (AUA), and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaires.  Results:   The median follow-up for surviving patients was 44.5 months (range, 0-62 months). The bPFS rate at 3 years was 97.7%. The median PSA declined from 4.9 ng/mL at diagnosis to 0.2 ng/mL at last follow-up, and the median percentage PSA decline at 12 months was 80%.

We have generated poly(amino ether)-functionalized gold nanorods (PAE-GNRs) using a layer-by-layer deposition approach; polymers from a poly(amino ether) library recently synthesized in our laboratory were employed to generate the PAE-GNR assemblies. PAE-GNR assemblies demonstrate long-term colloidal stability as well as the capacity to bind plasmid DNA by means of electrostatic interactions. Sub-toxic concentrations of PAE-GNRs were employed to deliver plasmid DNA to prostate cancer cells in vitro. PAE-GNRs generated using 1,4C-1,4Bis, a cationic polymer from our laboratory demonstrated significantly higher transgene expression and exhibited lower cytotoxicities when compared to similar assemblies generated using 25 kDa poly(ethylene imine) (PEI25k-GNRs), a current standard for polymer-mediated gene delivery. The roles of polyelectrolyte chemistry and zeta-potential in determining transgene expression efficacies of PAE-GNR assemblies were investigated. Our results indicate that stable and effective PAE-GNR assemblies are a promising engineered platform for transgene delivery.

Methods:   Luciferase reporter assay and site-directed mutagenesis were used to analyze the regulatory region of TMSG-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were carried out to verify the interaction of KLF6 and Sp1 with the regulatory region of TMSG-1. Co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) was performed to analyze the interaction between KLF6 and Sp1. TMSG-1 and wt-KLF6 mRNA expressions in cells with different metastatic capacities were quantitated by real-time PCR. Cell invasive capability was determined by Matrigel invasion assay.  Results:   A 63 bp inducible regulatory region (+59 bp - +123 bp) in exon 1 was identified by luciferase assay using reporter plasmids with a series of TMSG-1 regulatory region deletions. Mutations in KLF6/Sp1 binding sites of this region resulted in a decrease of luciferase activity, while cotransfection with KLF6 or Sp1 expressing plasmids led to a remarkable increase of luciferase activity. EMSA and ChIP demonstrated that KLF6 as well as Sp1 interacted with this region. CoIP also indicated a possible interaction between KLF6 and Sp1 proteins. In the highly metastatic cell sublines, a low level of wild type KLF6 was associated synchronously with a low TMSG-1 level. Prostate carcinoma cells overexpressing KLF6 exhibited a higher TMSG-1 level and a lower invasive capability.  Conclusions:   Transcription factor complex of KLF6 and Sp1 may participate in the inducible transcriptional regulation of TMSG-1, and a decreased wild type KLF6 expression is likely associated with a low TMSG-1 level in the highly metastatic cell sublines.""","""['Miao-zi Gong', 'Jiang-feng You', 'Fei Pei', 'Xiang-lin Cui', 'Gang Li', 'Jie Zheng']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi""","""['KLF6/Sp1 initiates transcription of the tmsg-1 gene in human prostate carcinoma cells: an exon involved mechanism.', 'Overexpression of human tumor metastasis-related gene TMSG-1 suppresses cell proliferation and invasion of a highly metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC-3M-1E8 in vitro.', 'Overexpression of tumor metastasis suppressor gene 1 suppresses proliferation and invasion, but enhances apoptosis of human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'TMSG-1 and its roles in tumor biology.', 'Biology of Krüppel-like factor 6 transcriptional regulator in cell life and death.', 'Effects of Kruppel-like factor 6 on osteosarcoma cell biological behavior.']"""

We present a pre-planned preliminary safety analysis of side-effects in stages 1 and 2 of a randomised trial comparing standard and hypofractionated radiotherapy.  Methods:   We did a multicentre, randomised study and recruited men with localised prostate cancer between Oct 18, 2002, and Aug 12, 2006, at 11 UK centres. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive conventional or hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and all were given with 3-6 months of neoadjuvant androgen suppression. Computer-generated random permuted blocks were used, with risk of seminal vesicle involvement and radiotherapy-treatment centre as stratification factors. The conventional schedule was 37 fractions of 2 Gy to a total of 74 Gy. The two hypofractionated schedules involved 3 Gy treatments given in either 20 fractions to a total of 60 Gy, or 19 fractions to a total of 57 Gy. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients with grade 2 or worse toxicity at 2 years on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale. The primary analysis included all patients who had received at least one fraction of radiotherapy and completed a 2 year assessment. Treatment allocation was not masked and clinicians were not blinded. Stage 3 of this trial completed the planned recruitment in June, 2011. This study is registered, number ISRCTN97182923.  Findings:   153 men recruited to stages 1 and 2 were randomly assigned to receive conventional treatment of 74 Gy, 153 to receive 60 Gy, and 151 to receive 57 Gy. With 50·5 months median follow-up (IQR 43·5-61·3), six (4·3%; 95% CI 1·6-9·2) of 138 men in the 74 Gy group had bowel toxicity of grade 2 or worse on the RTOG scale at 2 years, as did five (3·6%; 1·2-8·3) of 137 men in the 60 Gy group, and two (1·4%; 0·2-5·0) of 143 men in the 57 Gy group. For bladder toxicities, three (2·2%; 0·5-6·2) of 138 men, three (2·2%; 0·5-6·3) of 137, and none (0·0%; 97·5% CI 0·0-2·6) of 143 had scores of grade 2 or worse on the RTOG scale at 2 years.  Interpretation:   Hypofractionated high-dose radiotherapy seems equally well tolerated as conventionally fractionated treatment at 2 years.

Few associations have been tested in independent validation studies. This prospective study aimed to validate reported associations between genotype and radiation toxicity in a large independent dataset.  Methods:   92 (of 98 attempted) SNPs in 46 genes were successfully genotyped in 1613 patients: 976 received adjuvant breast radiotherapy in the Cambridge breast IMRT trial (ISRCTN21474421, n=942) or in a prospective study of breast toxicity at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK (n=34). A further 637 received radical prostate radiotherapy in the MRC RT01 multicentre trial (ISRCTN47772397, n=224) or in the Conventional or Hypofractionated High Dose Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer (CHHiP) trial (ISRCTN97182923, n=413). Late toxicity was assessed 2 years after radiotherapy with a validated photographic technique (patients with breast cancer only), clinical assessment, and patient questionnaires. Association tests of genotype with overall radiation toxicity score and individual endpoints were undertaken in univariate and multivariable analyses. At a type I error rate adjusted for multiple testing, this study had 99% power to detect a SNP, with minor allele frequency of 0·35, associated with a per allele odds ratio of 2·2.  Findings:   None of the previously reported associations were confirmed by this study, after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The p value distribution of the SNPs tested against overall toxicity score was not different from that expected by chance.  Interpretation:   We did not replicate previously reported late toxicity associations, suggesting that we can essentially exclude the hypothesis that published SNPs individually exert a clinically relevant effect. Continued recruitment of patients into studies within the Radiogenomics Consortium is essential so that sufficiently powered studies can be done and methodological challenges addressed.

These SREs can be debilitating and potentially life-limiting. This study examined treatment practices and the association of treatment patterns with Zometa (zoledronic acid, ZOL), an intravenous bisphosphonate (IV-BP), with SREs and fractures. (Zometa is a registered trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, USA.)  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollment and medical claims data was performed to evaluate IV-BP use and SRE patterns in adult patients with GU cancers. Criteria included diagnosis of ≥1 bone metastasis and prostate cancer (PC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), or bladder cancer (BlC) between January 2001 and December 2006; continuous healthcare plan enrollment for ≥6 months before the index date; and no evidence of prior IV-BP use. Patients were followed until disenrollment from the healthcare plan or December 2007.  Results:   Of 6347 patients (PC, n = 4976; RCC, n = 941; BlC, n = 430; mean [standard deviation] age: 68.9 [11.1] years), only approximately 23% received ZOL. The mean time between diagnosis of bone metastasis and ZOL initiation was approximately 108 days. Among patients with PC, fracture risk was significantly smaller for ZOL vs no IV-BP (incidence rate ratio = 0.70; p < 0.001), and 2-year survival was significantly longer for ZOL-treated vs no IV-BP patients (p = 0.007). Patients with longer persistency on ZOL had a smaller fracture risk than patients with shorter persistency. Sub-set analyses were not performed for RCC and BIC because the proportion of patients treated was too low.  Limitations:   Interpretation of this claims-based analysis must be tempered by the inherent limitations of observational data, such as limited and accurate available information, and unavailable information including clinical or disease-specific parameters.  Conclusions:   Intravenous BP therapy is not always received in patients with bone metastases secondary to GU cancers, and, when used, there are typically long time periods before treatment initiation. Without IV-BPs, PC patients have significantly larger risks of fracture and death compared with ZOL-treated patients, and benefits appear to be larger with increasing persistency on ZOL.""","""['Henry J Henk', 'Satyin Kaura']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Med Econ""","""['Retrospective database analysis of the effect of zoledronic acid on skeletal-related events and mortality in women with breast cancer and bone metastasis in a managed care plan.', 'Retrospective evaluation of the clinical benefit of long-term continuous use of zoledronic acid in patients with lung cancer and bone metastases.', 'Persistency with zoledronic acid is associated with clinical benefit in patients with multiple myeloma.', 'Zoledronic acid use in patients with bone metastases from renal cell carcinoma or bladder cancer.', 'Zoledronic acid is effective in preventing and delaying skeletal events in patients with bone metastases secondary to genitourinary cancers.', 'Incidence and consequences of bone metastases in lung cancer patients.', 'Prognostic significance of bone metastases and bisphosphonate therapy in patients with renal cell carcinoma.', 'Use of intravenous bisphosphonates in patients with breast, lung, or prostate cancer and metastases to bone: a 15-year study in two large US health systems.', 'Pharmacoeconomics of bisphosphonates for skeletal-related event prevention in metastatic non-breast solid tumours.']"""

The effect of celecoxib on cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in human suspended PC3 prostate cancer cells was explored by using fura-2 as a fluorescent dye. Celecoxib at concentrations between 5 and 30 μM increased [Ca(2+)](i) in a concentration-dependent manner. The Ca(2+) signal was reduced partly by removing extracellular Ca(2+). Celecoxib-induced Ca(2+) influx was not blocked by L-type Ca(2+) entry inhibitors or protein kinase C/A modulators [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), GF109203X, H-89], but was inhibited by the phospholipase A(2) inhibitor, aristolochic acid. In Ca(2+)-free medium, 30 μM of celecoxib failed to induce a [Ca(2+)](i) rise after pretreatment with thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum [ER] Ca(2+) pump inhibitor). Conversely, pretreatment with celecoxib inhibited thapsigargin-induced Ca(2+) release. Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 did not change celecoxib-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rises. Celecoxib induced slight cell death in a concentration-dependent manner, which was enhanced by chelating cytosolic Ca(2+) with BAPTA. Collectively, in PC3 cells, celecoxib induced [Ca(2+)](i) rises by causing phospholipase C-independent Ca(2+) release from the ER and Ca(2+) influx via non-L-type, phospholipase A(2)-regulated Ca(2+) channels.

Even more scant is information about time trends in educational patterns in specific cancer mortality. This study examines educational inequalities in Norway 1971-2002 for mortality in lung and larynx, colorectal, stomach, melanoma, prostate, breast and cervix uteri cancer.  Methods:   A data file encompassing all Norwegian inhabitants registered some time during 1971-2002 while aged 45-74 was constructed with linked information from administrative registers. During an exposure of more than 40 millions person-years, about 87,000 deaths in the analysed cancer types were registered. Absolute and relative inequalities during three periods were analysed by age-standardized deaths rates, hazard regression odds ratios and Relative Index of Inequality.  Results:   Educational inequalities in lung and related cancer mortality widened considerably from the 1970s to the 1990s for both sexes. The moderate educational gradient for stomach and cervix uteri cancer persisted, as did the weak gradient for colorectal cancer. No educational differences in prostate cancer were observed in any of the time periods. The modest inverse educational gradients in deaths from breast cancer and melanoma remained at the same level.  Conclusion:   Among the seven cancer types examined in this study, only lung cancer mortality showed a clear widening in educational disparities. As lung cancer mortality constitutes a large proportion of all cancer deaths, this increase may result in larger disparities for overall cancer mortality.

The immunoassay was conducted by following the typical procedure for sandwich-type immunoreaction. Nanoporous gold (NPG) foils were immobilized onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for primary anti-PSA (Ab(1)) anchoring. Making use of the unique properties of NPG, antibodies could be self-assembled onto the support-free NPG via amine-Au affinity with a high loading amount and reserve high immunological activity. HSMs were used as a secondary anti-PSA antibody (Ab(2)) label. For the preparation of the label, mediator thionine (TH) was first conjugated onto amino-functionalized HSMs (NH(2)-HSMs) via crosslinking with glutaraldehyde, and then the amino group of TH was used to immobilize horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Ab(2). Due to the large specific surface area of NH(2)-HSMs, the loading of antibodies as well as mediator and enzyme onto HSMs was substantially increased, which increased the sensitivity of the immunosensor. The immunosensor exhibited a high sensitivity and showed a linear response within the range of 0.01-10 ng mL(-1) PSA, low detection limit (6.00 pg mL(-1)), good reproducibility and stability.

Recent clinical studies indicated a benefit in survival and tumor relapse with the supportive treatment of breast cancer using zoledronic acid (ZA), thus stimulating the debate about its putative anti-tumor activity in vivo. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated for 3 h (pulse treatment) and 72 h (permanent treatment) with ZA, and apoptosis rates and cell viability, defined as ATP content, were determined after 72 h. Permanent and pulse stimulation with ZA inhibited the viability of MCF-7 cells, which could partly be rescued by atorvastatin (Ator) pre-treatment but not by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) co-treatment. Microarray analysis of ZA treated MCF-7 cells identified genes of the mevalonate pathway as significantly upregulated, which was verified by qPCR. Additionally the putative tumor suppressors krüppel-like factor 2 and 6 (KLF2 and KLF6) were markedly upregulated, while the classical proliferation marker Ki-67 was clearly downregulated. The expression of all three genes was confirmed by qPCR on mRNA level and by immunocytochemistry or Western blot staining. Expression of target genes were also analyzed in other breast (MDA-MB-231, BT-20, ZR75-1, T47D) and prostate (LNCaP, PC3) cancer cell lines by qPCR. ZA responsiveness of KLF2, KLF6 and Ki-67 could be verified in PC3 and T47D cells, KLF6 responsiveness in LNCaP and KLF2 responsiveness in MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells. Here we demonstrate in the apoptosis insensitive MCF-7 cell line a remarkable impact of ZA exposure on cell viability and on the regulation of putative tumor suppressors of the KLF family. The molecular mechanism involved might be the accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and ApppI, since we could partly rescue the ZA effect by Ator pre-treatment and GGPP co-treatment. These data should stimulate further research into both the role of the mevalonate pathway and the accumulation of pyrophosphate compounds like ApppI in tumorigenesis and differentiation and their potential apart from the inhibition of mitochondrial ADP/ATP translocase and apoptosis, since such effects might well be responsible for the adjuvant ZA treatment benefit of patients suffering from breast cancer.""","""['Regina Ebert', 'Sabine Zeck', 'Jutta Meissner-Weigl', 'Barbara Klotz', 'Tilman D Rachner', 'Peggy Benad', 'Ludger Klein-Hitpass', 'Maximilian Rudert', 'Lorenz C Hofbauer', 'Franz Jakob']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Bone""","""['Probenecid as a sensitizer of bisphosphonate-mediated effects in breast cancer cells.', 'The level of ATP analog and isopentenyl pyrophosphate correlates with zoledronic acid-induced apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro.', 'Mevalonate pathway intermediates downregulate zoledronic acid-induced isopentenyl pyrophosphate and ATP analog formation in human breast cancer cells.', 'Biology of Krüppel-like factor 6 transcriptional regulator in cell life and death.', 'The role of KLF6 and its splice variants in cancer therapy.', 'Evaluating the transcriptional landscape and cell-cell communication networks in chronically irradiated parotid glands.', 'The CD226-ERK1/2-LAMP1 pathway is an important mechanism for Vγ9Vδ2 T cell cytotoxicity against chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia blasts and leukemia stem cells.', 'Long non-coding RNA ANRIL is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and regulates cell proliferation by epigenetic silencing of KLF2.', 'Long non-coding RNA TUG1 is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and promotes cell growth and apoptosis by epigenetically silencing of KLF2.', 'Long non-coding RNA ANRIL is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and regulates cell apoptosis by epigenetic silencing of KLF2.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study included 19950 men, aged 55 to 74 years at first screening, in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. Age, Charlson comorbidity, prostate cancer family history, vasectomy status, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) score, digital rectal examination (DRE) status, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings, prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level were assessed. Men were followed for median 11.1 years after first screening visit. Multivariate estimates of the probability of aggressive prostate cancer [stage ≥ T2c, or N1, M1, PSA > 20 ng/mL, or Gleason score ≥ 8], developing distant metastases and dying from prostate cancer stratified for predictors measured before prostate biopsies. Harrell's concordance index (c-index) was used for predictive accuracy.  Results:   Among 19950 men, 2420 men (12.1%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 623 men (3.1%) had aggressive prostate cancer, 157 men (0.8%) developed metastases and 104 men (0.5%) died due to a prostate cancer related cause of death. In multivariate analysis, PSA, DRE, TRUS findings and prostate volume had a significant association with detection of aggressive prostate cancer, metastases and prostate cancer mortality. Family history was significantly associated with aggressive prostate cancer. Accuracy for predicting aggressive prostate cancer c-index = 0.90, distant metastases c-index = 0.87, and prostate cancer specific mortality c-index = 0.87.  Conclusions:   In a large population of men who were screened for prostate cancer, detection of aggressive prostate cancer, metastases and prostate cancer mortality was predicted based on predictors available before biopsy.

However, this group of patients often have developed significant muscle atrophy and functional impairments from prior and continuing androgen deprivation that is exacerbated by subsequent and more intensive interventions such as chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a modular multi-modal exercise program in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.  Methods/design:   Multi-site randomized controlled trial in Western Australia and New South Wales to examine the efficacy and safety of a modular multi-modal physical exercise program in 90 prostate cancer survivors with bone metastases. Participants will be randomized to (1) modular multi-modal exercise intervention group or (2) usual medical care group. The modular multi-modal exercise group will receive a 3-month supervised exercise program based on bone lesion location/extent. Measurements for primary and secondary endpoints will take place at baseline, 3 months (end of the intervention) and 6 months follow-up.  Discussion:   Delaying or preventing skeletal complication and improving physical function for men with bone metastases would provide clinically meaningful benefits to patients. However, exercise programs must be designed and executed with careful consideration of the skeletal complications associated with bone metastatic disease and cumulative toxicities from androgen deprivation such as osteoporosis and increased risk of fractures. The results from this study will form the basis for the development of a specific exercise prescription in this patient group in order to alleviate disease burden, counteract the adverse treatment related side-effects and enhance quality of life.

Highly aggressive androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 cells demonstrated significantly higher levels of total antioxidant capacity (AC) and intra- and extracellular glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratios when compared with normal prostate epithelial PrEC cells. WPE1-NB26 cells, a prostate cancer cell line derived from immortalized RWPE1 human prostate epithelial cells, demonstrated significantly higher levels of total AC and intra- and extracellular GSH/GSSG ratios, but lower levels of intracellular reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and lipid peroxidation compared with RWPE1 cells. LNCaP-C4-2 cells, a more aggressive prostate cancer derived from less aggressive androgen-responsive LNCaP cells, exhibited higher levels of AC and extracellular GSH/GSSG ratio when compared to LNCaP cells. Specific cell types showed distinct cytotoxic responses to redox-modulating compounds. WPE1-NB26 cells were more sensitive to phenethyl isothiocyanate and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) than RWPE1 cells, while PC3 cells were more sensitive to TNF than PrEC cells.

The AUC summary measure can vary by patient and testing characteristics. Thus, the performance of the test may be different in certain subpopulation of patients and readers. For this purpose, we propose a direct semi-parametric regression model for the non-parametric AUC measure for ordinal data while accounting for discrete and continuous covariates. The proposed method can be used to estimate the AUC value under degenerate data where certain rating categories are not observed. We will discuss the non-standard asymptotic theory, since the estimating functions were based on cross-correlated random variables. Simulation studies based on different classification models showed that the proposed model worked reasonably well with small percent bias and percent mean-squared error.

We evaluated the discrepancy in PCA localization between unilateral positive biopsy (PBx) and radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   Between 2004 and 2008, 431 patients were diagnosed with unilateral PCA by 12-core PBx; 179 underwent RP and constituted our study cohort. Specimens were reviewed to map tumor outline and determine number of cancer foci, tumor volume, Gleason score (GS), zone of origin, localization, and pathologic stage.  Results:   In 50 men, biopsy and prostatectomy findings correlated (unilateral tumor); in 129, PCA was detected in the contralateral side of the prostate. In 52 patients, 54 clinically significant tumors were missed by biopsy. When patients with true unilateral and missed contralateral disease at RP were compared with respect to prognostic parameters no significant differences were detected. Sixty-one of the 88 patients with preoperative low-risk disease had true unilateral (n = 21) or missed insignificant contralateral (n = 40) PCA; 27 had missed significant contralateral PCA at RP. PSA > 4 ng/ml predicted presence of significant bilateral disease in low-risk population (P = 0.004).

This disease has limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis as the underlying molecular mechanisms are not clearly understood. Given the emerging roles of microRNA (miRNA) as a key regulator, we postulated that miRNA may play a significant role in CRPC formation.  Methods:   miR-146a levels in 15 androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) tissues and 5 CRPC tissues were measured by qRT-PCR. Effects of miR-146a in cell proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo were evaluated by MTT assay, colony formation assay, transwell migratory assay, and tumor formation assay, respectively.  Results:   we found that miR-146a expression was significantly decreased in CRPC tissues compared to ADPC tissues. Functional analyses showed that ectopic overexpression of miR-146a in androgen-independent cell lines not only inhibited cell growth, colony formation, and migration in vitro, but also reduced tumorigenicity and angiogenesis in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that miR-146a repressed the expression of EGFR through binding to its 3'-untranslated region. Also, miR-146a inhibited the expression of MMP2, one of the most important genes in tumor progression. Moreover, downregulation of p-ERK expression significantly abrogated miR-146a-induced prostate cancer cell proliferation.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that ubiquitous loss of miR-146a is a critical mechanism for overexpression of EGFR in CRPC, which is crucial to better understanding the pathogenesis of CRPC.""","""['Bin Xu', 'Ning Wang', 'Xuhui Wang', 'Na Tong', 'Ning Shao', 'Jun Tao', 'Pengchao Li', 'Xiaobing Niu', 'Ninghan Feng', 'Lihua Zhang', 'Lixin Hua', 'Zengjun Wang', 'Ming Chen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['miR-146a functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer by targeting Rac1.', 'MicroRNA-616 induces androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells by suppressing expression of tissue factor pathway inhibitor TFPI-2.', 'Hsa-miR-146a-5p modulates androgen-independent prostate cancer cells apoptosis by targeting ROCK1.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Tumor models for prostate cancer exemplified by fibroblast growth factor 8-induced tumorigenesis and tumor progression.', 'MiR-146a Restoration Suppresses Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration: A Bioinformatic and In Vitro Study.', 'Immunomodulatory Properties of Human Breast Milk: MicroRNA Contents and Potential Epigenetic Effects.', 'Exploration of Extracellular Vesicle miRNAs, Targeted mRNAs and Pathways in Prostate Cancer: Relation to Disease Status and Progression.', 'Interplay of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 in Prostate Cancer: Beyond Androgen Receptor Transactivation.', 'Exploring miRNA Signature and Other Potential Biomarkers for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer Characterization: The Biological Challenge behind Clinical Practice.

Methods:   Effect of PEITC treatment on protein and mRNA expression of IAP in cells was determined by Western blotting and reverse transcription PCR, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the in vivo effect of PEITC administration on X-linked IAP (XIAP) and Survivin protein expression. Overexpression of desired protein was achieved by transient transfection. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay, whereas apoptosis was quantified by measurement of histone-associated DNA fragment release into the cytosol. Transwell chamber assay was used to determine cell migration.  Results:   Exposure of PC-3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells to PEITC resulted in downregulation of XIAP and Survivin proteins and Survivin mRNA. PEITC administration to transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate mice caused modest but significant downregulation of XIAP and Survivin proteins in the dorsolateral prostate. Proapoptotic response to PEITC was significantly attenuated by ectopic expression of XIAP and Survivin proteins. Survivin overexpression also conferred modest but significant protection against PEITC-mediated inhibition of PC-3 cell migration.

However, other studies have reported loss of EphB4 suggesting a tumor suppressor function in some cancers. These opposing roles may be regulated by (i) the presence of the primary ligand ephrin-B2 that regulates pathways involved in tumor suppression or (ii) the absence of ephrin-B2 that allows EphB4 signaling via ligand-independent pathways that contribute to tumor promotion. To explore this theory, EphB4 was overexpressed in the prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1 and the mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Overexpressed EphB4 localized to lipid-rich regions of the plasma membrane and confirmed to be ligand-responsive as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and internalization. EphB4 overexpressing cells demonstrated enhanced anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion, all characteristics associated with an aggressive phenotype, and therefore supporting the hypothesis that overexpressed EphB4 facilitates tumor promotion. Importantly, these effects were reversed in the presence of ephrin-B2 which led to a reduction in EphB4 protein levels, demonstrating that ligand-dependent signaling is tumor suppressive. Furthermore, extended ligand stimulation caused a significant decrease in proliferation that correlated with a rise in caspase-3/7 and -8 activities. Together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of EphB4 confers a transformed phenotype in the case of MCF-10A cells and an increased metastatic phenotype in the case of 22Rv1 cancer cells and that both phenotypes can be restrained by stimulation with ephrin-B2, in part by reducing EphB4 levels.""","""['Raphael Rutkowski', 'Inga Mertens-Walker', 'Jessica E Lisle', 'Adrian C Herington', 'Sally-Anne Stephenson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['EphrinB2-EphB4 Signaling in Neurooncological Disease.', 'Ligand-Dependent and Ligand-Independent Effects of Ephrin-B2-EphB4 Signaling in Melanoma Metastatic Spine Disease.', 'Interplay between EphB4 on tumor cells and vascular ephrin-B2 regulates tumor growth.', 'Ephrin-independent regulation of cell substrate adhesion by the EphB4 receptor.', 'Regulation of signaling interactions and receptor endocytosis in growing blood vessels.', 'Ephrin B Activate Src Family Kinases in Fibroblasts Inducing Stromal Remodeling in Prostate Cancer.', 'EphrinB2-EphB4 Signaling in Neurooncological Disease.', 'The Value of EphB2 Receptor and Cognate Ephrin Ligands in Prognostic and Predictive Assessments of Human Breast Cancer.', 'Ligand-Dependent and Ligand-Independent Effects of Ephrin-B2-EphB4 Signaling in Melanoma Metastatic Spine Disease.', 'Low Expression of EphB2, EphB3, and EphB4 in Bladder Cancer: Novel Potential Indicators of Muscular Invasion.']"""

Methods:   Between 1999 and 2008, 34,490 open RPs were performed in the state of Florida. First, logistic regression models predicting the rate of IHP were fitted. Second, other logistic regression models examined the association between IHP and three other outcomes: in-hospital mortality, hospital charges within the highest quartile, and length of stay (LOS) within the highest quartile. Covariates included ASC, age, race, baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), interval between admission and surgery, as well as blood transfusion.  Results:   The overall IHP rate was 0.5%. It was higher in patients operated within the low (0.7%) and intermediate (0.5%) ASC tertile versus high ASC tertile (0.2%, P < 0.001). Mortality rate was 4.3% in IHP patients versus 0.1% in others (P < 0.001).

In multivariable analyses predicting IHP, the likelihood was 3.2-fold in patients operated by low ASC surgeons versus high ASC surgeons (P < 0.001). Second, in multivariable analyses, IHP patients were predisposed to 41-fold higher in-hospital mortality, were tenfold more likely to have total hospital charges >$37,333, and were 20-fold more likely to have a LOS >3 days (all P < 0.001).

CGs had the most accurate knowledge of hereditary PCa. All but 1 CG mentioned at least one inherited trait with PCa, compared to only 25% of urologists and 9% of GPs. CGs hardly ever counseled men about PCa testing. Most urologists and GPs discuss possible risks and benefits before testing for PCa with PSA. Remarkably, 35-40% of them do not take family history into consideration. Knowledge of urologists and GPs about heredity and PCa is suboptimal.

One group of these novel fatty acid amides are the N-acyl taurines (fatty acids conjugated to the amino acid taurine).

PC-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of N-arachidonoyl taurine and N-oleoyl taurine and cell proliferation and viability was measured using resazurin and colony formation assays. Effects of N-acyl taurines on the cell cycle was measured using FACS analysis. Treatment with N-arachidonoyl taurine and N-oleoyl taurine resulted in a significant reduction in proliferation of PC-3 cells, even at concentrations as low as 1 μM. Treatment with N-oleoyl taurine resulted in an increased number of cells in the subG1 population, suggesting apoptosis, and a lower number of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle.

Results:   A431 cells showed the highest (18)F-D-FPHCys uptake in vitro and in vivo followed by Colo 205, PC3 and HT-29. A similar pattern of retention was observed with (14)C-MET. (18)F-D-FPHCys retention was strongly correlated with LAT1 expression both in vitro (R(2) = 0.85) and in vivo (R(2) = 0.99). Downregulation of LAT1 by siRNA inhibited (18)F-D-FPHCys uptake, demonstrating a clear dependence on this transporter for tumour uptake. Furthermore, (18)F-D-FPHCys accumulation mirrored cellular proliferation.  Conclusion:   The favourable properties of (18)F-D-FPHCys make this tracer a promising imaging probe for detection of tumours as well as for the noninvasive evaluation and monitoring of tumour growth.""","""['Delphine Denoyer', 'Laura Kirby', 'Kelly Waldeck', 'Peter Roselt', 'Oliver C Neels', 'Thomas Bourdier', 'Rachael Shepherd', 'Andrew Katsifis', 'Rodney J Hicks']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Radiosynthesis and biological evaluation of L- and D-S-(3-18Ffluoropropyl)homocysteine for tumor imaging using positron emission tomography.', 'L- and D-S-(3-18Ffluoropropyl)homocysteine.', 'Transport of 3-fluoro-L-α-methyl-tyrosine by tumor-upregulated L-type amino acid transporter 1: a cause of the tumor uptake in PET.', 'PET Imaging of L-Type Amino Acid Transporter (LAT1) and Cystine-Glutamate Antiporter (xc-) with 18FFDOPA and 18FFSPG in Breast Cancer Models.', '18FFluoromethyl-d-tyrosine.', 'Synthesis of enantiopure 18F-trifluoromethyl cysteine as a structure-mimetic amino acid tracer for glioma imaging.']"""

PSK is used in Asia as a cancer immunotherapy. However, its benefit in combination with taxanes for prostate cancer is unknown. We examined whether PSK would enhance docetaxel-induced apoptosis and augment anti-tumor immune responses in orthotopic tumors using transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP)-C2-bearing mice. Combining PSK with docetaxel induced significantly higher tumor suppression than either treatment alone (p<0.05), including a reduction in tumor proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. Combined PSK and docetaxel treatment led to a lower decrease in number of white blood cells than docetaxel alone, an effect accompanied by increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. PSK with or without docetaxel significantly enhanced mRNA expression of IFN-γ compared to control, but did not significantly alter T-regulatory FoxP3 mRNA expression in tumors.

Matrine is a naturally occurring alkaloid extracted from the Chinese herb Sophora flavescens. Matrine has shown anti-proliferative properties in a number of types of cancer, including breast, gastric, lung and pancreatic tumors. Matrine was also found to promote apoptosis and inhibit invasion of cancer cells. We evaluated the antitumor effects of matrine on androgen-independent PC-3 prostate cancer cells. The effects of matrine on cell cycle progression and apoptosis of PC-3 cells were tested. Matrine-treated PC-3 cells underwent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. There was a significant reduction in the number of S phase and G2/M phase cells in the treated group when compared to untreated cells. Flow cytometry, as well as Annexin-V/PI staining, showed a significant, dose-dependent increase in the number of early, as well as late, stage apoptotic cells in matrine-treated cells compared to untreated cells. There was also an increase in the number of necrotic cells in the matrine-treated group when compared to untreated cells. Matrine treatment resulted in increased levels of caspase-3 and Bax and decreased levels of Bcl-2. Our data suggest that matrine inhibits the proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by causing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. Matrine‑induced apoptosis was mediated by downregulation of Bcl-2/Bax ratios and upregulation of caspase-3 levels.

Through molecular modeling, we evaluated α-mangostin against the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket of CDK4 and propose three possible orientations that may result in CDK4 inhibition. We then performed an in vivo animal study to evaluate the ability of α-mangostin to suppress tumor growth. Athymic nude mice were implanted with 22Rv1 cells and treated with vehicle or α-mangostin (100 mg/kg) by oral gavage.

Cell culture, patient tissue microarray, allograft, xenograft, prostate-specific Pten knockout and omega-3 desaturase transgenic mouse models in conjunction with dietary manipulation, gene knockdown and knockout approaches were used to determine the effect of dietary PUFA on castration-resistant Pten-null prostate cancer. We found that deletion of Pten increased androgen receptor (AR) expression and Pten-null prostate cells were castration resistant. Omega-3 PUFA slowed down the growth of castration-resistant tumors as compared with omega-6 PUFA. Omega-3 PUFA decreased AR protein to a similar extent in tumor cell cytosolic and nuclear fractions but had no effect on AR messenger RNA level. Omega-3 PUFA treatment appeared to accelerate AR protein degradation, which could be blocked by proteasome inhibitor MG132. Knockdown of AR significantly slowed down prostate cancer cell proliferation in the absence of androgens. Our data suggest that omega-3 PUFA inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer in part by accelerating proteasome-dependent degradation of the AR protein.

Our analysis defined and validated 495 genes exhibiting significant differences in CRPC in gene copy number, including gains in androgen receptor (AR) and losses of PTEN and retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Significant copy number differences existed between tumors with or without AR gene amplification, including a common loss of AR repressors in AR-unamplified tumors. Simultaneous gene methylation and allelic deletion occurred frequently in RB1 and HSD17B2, the latter of which is involved in testosterone metabolism. Lastly, genomic DNA from most CRPC was hypermethylated compared with benign prostate tissue. Our findings establish a comprehensive methylation signature that couples epigenomic and structural analyses, thereby offering insights into the genomic alterations in CRPC that are associated with a circumvention of hormonal therapy.

RUNX2 attenuates growth and stimulates maturation of osteoblasts during bone formation but is also robustly expressed in a subset of osteosarcomas, as well as in metastatic breast and prostate tumors. To assess the biological function of RUNX2 in osteosarcoma cells, we examined human genomic promoter interactions for RUNX2 using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-microarray analysis in SAOS-2 cells. Promoter binding of both RUNX2 and RNA polymerase II was compared with gene expression profiles of cells in which RUNX2 was depleted by RNA interference. Many RUNX2-bound loci (1550 of 2339 total) exhibit promoter occupancy by RNA polymerase II and contain the RUNX consensus motif 5'-((T/A/C)G(T/A/C)GG(T/G). Gene ontology analysis indicates that RUNX2 controls components of multiple signaling pathways (e.g. WNT, TGFβ, TNFα, and interleukins), as well as genes linked to cell motility and adhesion (e.g. the focal adhesion-related genes FAK/PTK2 and TLN1).

Results:   Among adults aged 75 to 79 years, the percentage screened for cancer was as follows: colorectal, 57%; breast, 62%; cervical, 53%; and prostate, 56%. Among those 80 years or older, rates of screening ranged from a low of 38% for cervical cancer to a high of 50% for breast cancer. Although unadjusted screening prevalence rates differed by race/ethnicity, these differences were accounted for by low education attainment in the multivariate logistic regression model. Physician recommendation for a specific test was the largest predictor of screening. Over 50% of men and women older than 75 years report that their physicians continue to recommend screening.

Recommendations on when to test appeared to be almost exclusively determined using standard follow-up schedules rather than any scientific basis. Recommendations on when to take action were primarily based on consensus statements or retrospective case series. Eight of the nine guidelines acknowledged the potential presence of measurement variability, but they did not attempt to account for the effect of such variability on the interpretation of the results of tests for prostate-specific antigen. Many recommendations were made with few or no supporting references; however, a variety of papers were cited across guidelines. Of 48 papers cited, 29.1% (14/48) were reviews; the remaining 70.8% (34/48) of papers cited were primary studies.  Interpretation:   A systematic approach to the development of monitoring schedules using prostate-specific antigen in guidelines for prostate cancer is lacking, due to inadequacies in the available evidence and its use.""","""['Jacqueline Dinnes', 'Jenny Hewison', 'Douglas G Altman', 'Jonathan J Deeks']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""CMAJ""","""['Guidelines are too important to be left to clinical experts.', 'Prostate cancer: PSA testing in older men--are we following the guidelines?', 'The prostate-specific antigen screening conundrum: examining the evidence.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: a guidance statement from the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: the current evidence and guidelines controversy.', 'Variation in the definition of biochemical recurrence in patients treated for localized prostate cancer: the American Urological Association Prostate Guidelines for Localized Prostate Cancer Update Panel report and recommendations for a standard in the reporting of surgical outcomes.', 'Design of the PROstate cancer follow-up care in Secondary and Primary hEalth Care study (PROSPEC): a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of primary care-based follow-up of localized prostate cancer survivors.', 'Statistical factors associated with utilisation of ototoxicity monitoring services for multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis patients in the Western Cape.', 'Guidelines are too important to be left to clinical experts.']"""

This study was to examine the distribution of baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin A and their glucuronide/sulfate-conjugated metabolites in plasma, colon, small intestine, lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and prostate tissues and in pancreatic tumor in a xenograft animal model. In addition, we examined metabolic stability of baicalin in these tissues.  Methods:   A mouse xenograft model was prepared by injection of 3 × 10 human pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 cells subcutaneously into nude mice. Mice were randomly allocated to control diet (AIN-76A) and 1% S. baicalensis diet (n = 8 per group) for 13 weeks. Levels of baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin A, and their conjugates in mouse tissues were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography after enzymatic hydrolysis and then extraction.  Results:   A substantial amount of baicalin (34%-63%) was methylated to oroxylin A and its conjugates in various organs during absorption. Whereas plasma contained predominantly conjugates of baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A, both aglycones and conjugates were found in all other tissues investigated and in tumor.

Recently, we identified the PDGF-D isoform as a ligand for β-PDGFR in PCa and showed that PDGF-D is activated by serine protease-mediated proteolytic removal of the CUB domain in a two-step process, yielding first a hemidimer (HD) and then a growth factor domain dimer. Herein, we demonstrate that the expression of PDGF-D in human PCa LNCaP cells leads to enhanced bone tumor growth and bone responses in immunodeficient mice. Histopathological analyses of bone tumors generated by PDGF-D-expressing LNCaP cells (LNCaP-PDGF-D) revealed osteolytic and osteoblastic responses similar to those observed in human PCa bone metastases. Importantly, we discovered a novel function of PDGF-D in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation, independent of the RANKL/RANK signaling axis. Although both PDGF-B and -D were able to activate β-PDGFR, only PDGF-D was able to induce osteoclastic differentiation in vitro, and upregulate the expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, a master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis.

First, we identify the implantation axis using a sample consensus algorithm. Then, we use a network flow algorithm to group seeds into their needle tracks. Finally, we match the needles from the three stages using both their transverse plane location and the number of seeds per needle.

We sought to develop model systems that reflect human SCPC and can improve our understanding of its biology.  Experimental design:   We developed a set of castration-resistant prostate carcinomas xenografts and examined their fidelity to their human tumors of origin. We compared the expression and genomic profiles of SCPC and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) xenografts to those of typical prostate adenocarcinoma xenografts. Results were validated immunohistochemically in a panel of 60 human tumors.  Results:   The reported SCPC and LCNEC xenografts retain high fidelity to their human tumors of origin and are characterized by a marked upregulation of UBE2C and other mitotic genes in the absence of androgen receptor (AR), retinoblastoma (RB1), and cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression. We confirmed these findings in a panel of samples of CRPC patients. In addition, array comparative genomic hybridization of the xenografts showed that the SCPC/LCNEC tumors display more copy number variations than the adenocarcinoma counterparts. Amplification of the UBE2C locus and microdeletions of RB1 were present in a subset, but none displayed AR nor CCND1 deletions. The AR, RB1, and CCND1 promoters showed no CpG methylation in the SCPC xenografts.

Similarly, vitamin D levels have been shown to be protective for risk of a number of conditions, including cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, as well as numerous autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases and type 1 diabetes mellitus. A study performed by Parekh et al. was the first to suggest a role for vitamin D in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and showed a correlation between reduced serum vitamin D levels and risk for early AMD. Based on this study and the protective role of vitamin D in diseases with similar pathophysiology to AMD, we examined the role of vitamin D in a family-based cohort of 481 sibling pairs. Using extremely phenotypically discordant sibling pairs, initially we evaluated the association of neovascular AMD and vitamin D/sunlight-related epidemiological factors. After controlling for established AMD risk factors, including polymorphisms of the genes encoding complement factor H (CFH) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2/HtrA serine peptidase (ARMS2/HTRA1), and smoking history, we found that ultraviolet irradiance was protective for the development of neovascular AMD (p = 0.001). Although evaluation of serum vitamin D levels (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]) was higher in unaffected individuals than in their affected siblings, this finding did not reach statistical significance. Based on the relationship between ultraviolet irradiance and vitamin D production, we employed a candidate gene approach for evaluating common variation in key vitamin D pathway genes (the genes encoding the vitamin D receptor [VDR]; cytochrome P450, family 27, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 [CYP27B1]; cytochrome P450, family 24, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 [CYP24A1]; and CYP27A1) in this same family-based cohort. Initial findings were then validated and replicated in the extended family cohort, an unrelated case-control cohort from central Greece and a prospective nested case-control population from the Nurse's Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Studies, which included patients with all subtypes of AMD for a total of 2,528 individuals. Single point variants in CYP24A1 (the gene encoding the catabolising enzyme of the vitamin D pathway) were demonstrated to influence AMD risk after controlling for smoking history, sex and age in all populations, both separately and, more importantly, in a meta-analysis. This is the first report demonstrating a genetic association between vitamin D metabolism and AMD risk. These findings were also supplemented with expression data from human donor eyes and human retinal cell lines.

Expression of HN1 in prostate cell lines down-regulates PI3K-dependent Akt activation. Here, we investigate whether HN1 is regulated by androgens through the putative androgen response elements (AREs) found in its promoter. Knockdown of HN1 expression by siRNA silencing leads to an increase in Akt((S473)) phosphorylation, resulting in the translocation of androgen receptor (AR) to the nucleus; these effects can be abrogated by the non-specific Akt inhibitor LY294002 but not by the ERK inhibitor PD98059. Furthermore, HN1 overexpression correlates with an increase in ubiquitination-mediated degradation (a consequence of the decrease in S213/210 phosphorylation of AR), ultimately resulting in the down-regulation of AR-mediated expression of the KLK3, KLK4, NKX3.1 and STAMP2 genes. We also found that HN1 overexpression suppresses colony formation as well as R1881-mediated growth in LNCaP cells, while it has the opposite effect (increasing colony formation but not proliferation) in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Therefore, we suggest that HN1 maintains a balance between the androgen-regulated nuclear translocation of AR and steady-state Akt phosphorylation, predominantly in the absence of androgens. If so, the balance between cell growth and EGF- and AR-signaling must be tightly regulated by HN1.

The databases of Medline, Embase and CNKI (up to May 25th, 2011) were retrieved to identify eligible case-control studies. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were used to present the strength of the associations. In total, eight case-control studies in seven articles with 16792 individuals (9738 cases of GC and 7054 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Through quantitative analyses, we found that T allele of rs2294008C>T and A allele of rs2976392G>A were significantly associated with increased GC risk [rs2294008C>T: OR (95%CI)=1.31 (1.22-1.42), P(z-test)<0.001, P(heterogeneity)=0.166 for TT vs. C carriers; rs2976392G>A: OR (95%CI)=1.36(1.24-1.50), P(z-test)=0.015, P(heterogeneity)=0.111 for AA vs. G carriers]. The results of subgroup analyses (according to histopathology, countries and sources of controls) indicated that T allele of rs2294008C>T and A allele rs2976392G>A were associated with increased risk of both intestinal- and diffuse-type GC, and associated with increased risk of GC for Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, PCC and HCC/PHCC. Furthermore, T allele of rs2294008C>T was also associated with increased risk of cardia and non-cardia GC, and associated with increased risk of GC for males and females. Besides those, this meta-analysis also indicated that the interactions between T allele of rs2294008C>T and A allele of rs2976392G>A was associated with increased risk of GC (A-T vs. G-T: OR=1.16, 95%CI=1.06-1.27, P(z-test)=0.001, P(heterogeneity)=0.835). Although modest limitations and potential bias cannot be eliminated, this meta-analysis suggests that PSCA -rs2294008C>T and -rs2976392G>A are potential factors of GC development for Eastern Asians, and future work may incorporate these findings and evaluate these variants as potential markers for screening and early diagnosis of GC.""","""['Lei Qiao', 'Yong Feng']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Association of PSCA rs2294008 gene variants with poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to gastric cancer and decreased risk of duodenal ulcer disease.', 'Two genetic variants in prostate stem cell antigen and gastric cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population.', 'The PSCA polymorphisms derived from genome-wide association study are associated with risk of gastric cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen polymorphisms and susceptibility to gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and gastric cancer susceptibility.', 'Association between PSCA, TNF-α, PARP1 and TP53 Gene Polymorphisms and Gastric Cancer Susceptibility in the Brazilian Population.', 'Molecular alterations in gastric cancer with special reference to the early-onset subtype.', 'Impact of DCC (rs714) and PSCA (rs2294008 and rs2976392) Gene Polymorphism in Modulating Cancer Risk in Asian Population.', 'Expression of stem cell markers nanog and PSCA in gastric cancer and its significance.', 'Helicobacter pylori in gastric carcinogenesis.']"""

The active compound in cruciferous vegetables appears to be the self dimerized product [3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM)] of indole-3-carbinol (I3C). Nutritional grade B-DIM (absorption-enhanced) has proven safe in a Phase I trial in PCa. We investigated the anti-cancer activity of B-DIM as a new biological approach to improve the effects of radiotherapy for hormone refractory prostate cancer cells, which were either positive or negative for androgen receptor (AR) expression. B-DIM inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner in both PC-3 (AR-) and C4-2B (AR+) cell lines. B-DIM was effective at increasing radiation-induced cell killing in both cell lines, independently of AR expression. B-DIM inhibited NF-κB and HIF-1α DNA activities and blocked radiation-induced activation of these transcription factors in both PC-3 and C4-2B cells. In C4-2B (AR+) cells, AR expression and nuclear localization were significantly increased by radiation. However, B-DIM abrogated the radiation-induced AR increased expression and trafficking to the nucleus, which was consistent with decreased PSA secretion. In vivo, treatment of PC-3 prostate tumors in nude mice with B-DIM and radiation resulted in significant primary tumor growth inhibition and control of metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes. These studies demonstrate that B-DIM augments radiation-induced cell killing and tumor growth inhibition. B-DIM impairs critical survival signaling pathways activated by radiation, leading to enhanced cell killing. These novel observations suggest that B-DIM could be used as a safe compound to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy for castrate-resistant PCa.""","""['Vinita Singh-Gupta', 'Sanjeev Banerjee', 'Christopher K Yunker', 'Joseph T Rakowski', 'Michael C Joiner', 'Andre A Konski', 'Fazlul H Sarkar', 'Gilda G Hillman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""[""Down-regulation of androgen receptor by 3,3'-diindolylmethane contributes to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in both hormone-sensitive LNCaP and insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells."", ""Cell cycle-dependent effects of 3,3'-diindolylmethane on proliferation and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells."", 'Radiation-induced HIF-1alpha cell survival pathway is inhibited by soy isoflavones in prostate cancer cells.', 'Indole-3-carbinol and prostate cancer.', ""Attenuation of multi-targeted proliferation-linked signaling by 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM): from bench to clinic."", ""Regulation of carcinogenesis and mediation through Wnt/β-catenin signaling by 3,3'-diindolylmethane in an enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell line."", 'Mechanisms Underlying Biological Effects of Cruciferous Glucosinolate-Derived Isothiocyanates/Indoles: A Focus on Metabolic Syndrome.', 'Autophagy inhibition improves the chemotherapeutic efficacy of cruciferous vegetable-derived diindolymethane in a murine prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Dietary Indoles Suppress Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity by Inducing a Switch from Proinflammatory Th17 Cells to Anti-Inflammatory Regulatory T Cells through Regulation of MicroRNA.', 'Microwave-assisted, one-pot reaction of 7-azaindoles and aldehydes: a facile route to novel di-7-azaindolylmethanes.']"""

This was done by identifying natural clusters in the chemosensitivity data set and in a data set of expression profiles of 1901 genes for the corresponding tumor cell lines. Five clusters were identified based on the gene expression data using self-organizing maps (SOM), comprising leukemia, melanoma, ovarian and prostate, basal breast, and luminal breast cancer cells, respectively. The strong difference in gene expression between basal and luminal breast cancer cells was reflected clearly in the chemosensitivity data. Although most compounds in the data set were of low potency, high efficacy compounds that showed specificity with respect to tissue of origin could be found. Furthermore, eight potential topoisomerase II inhibitors were identified using a structural similarity search.

Methods and materials:   Eight consecutive patients with biopsy-proven PC underwent DWI at 3T. All patients who received external-beam radiotherapy had four serial MR scans, as follows: before therapy (PreTx); after 1 week of therapy (PostT1); after 3 weeks of therapy (PostT2); and 1 month after the completion of therapy (PostT3). At each time, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured in tumors and normal tissues. For reproducibility of the ADC measurement, five patients also had two separate pretreatment DWI scans at an interval of <2 weeks. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were evaluated at the same time as MR scans.  Results:   Thirteen tumors (peripheral zone = 10; transition zone = 3) were found. The mean ADC values for the tumors from PreTx to PostT3 were 0.86, 1.03, 1.15, and 1.26 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in sequence, respectively. Compared with PreTx, PostT1 (p = 0.005), PostT2 (p = 0.003), and PostT3 (p < 0.001) showed a significant increase in ADC values. The mean ADC values of the benign tissues from PreTx to PostT3 were 1.60, 1.58, 1.47, and 1.46 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in sequence, respectively. Reproducibility of ADC measurements was confirmed with a mean difference in ADC of -0.04 in peripheral zone and -0.017 in transition zone between two separate pretreatment MR scans. The mean PSA levels from PreTx to PostT3 were 9.05, 9.18, 9.25, and 4.11 ng/mL in sequence, respectively.

Anti-androgens to reduce or prevent androgens binding to AR are widely used to suppress AR-mediated PCa growth; however, the androgen depletion therapy is only effective for a short period of time. Here we found a natural product/Chinese herbal medicine cryptotanshinone (CTS), with a structure similar to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), can effectively inhibit the DHT-induced AR transactivation and prostate cancer cell growth. Our results indicated that 0.5 μM CTS effectively suppresses the growth of AR-positive PCa cells, but has little effect on AR negative PC-3 cells and non-malignant prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, our data indicated that CTS could modulate AR transactivation and suppress the DHT-mediated AR target genes (PSA, TMPRSS2, and TMEPA1) expression in both androgen responsive PCa LNCaP cells and castration resistant CWR22rv1 cells. Importantly, CTS selectively inhibits AR without repressing the activities of other nuclear receptors, including ERα, GR, and PR. The mechanistic studies indicate that CTS functions as an AR inhibitor to suppress androgen/AR-mediated cell growth and PSA expression by blocking AR dimerization and the AR-coregulator complex formation. Furthermore, we showed that CTS effectively inhibits CWR22Rv1 cell growth and expressions of AR target genes in the xenograft animal model. The previously un-described mechanisms of CTS may explain how CTS inhibits the growth of PCa cells and help us to establish new therapeutic concepts for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Defeng Xu', 'Tzu-Hua Lin', 'Shaoshun Li', 'Jun Da', 'Xing-Qiao Wen', 'Jiang Ding', 'Chawnshang Chang', 'Shuyuan Yeh']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['The selective inhibitory effect of a synthetic tanshinone derivative on prostate cancer cells.', 'Tanshinones from Chinese medicinal herb Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) suppress prostate cancer growth and androgen receptor signaling.', 'Evaluation of the effects of androgenic Chinese herbal medicines on androgen receptors and tumor growth in experimental prostate cancer models.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tanshinone against Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrated Proteomics and Metabolomics Link Acne to the Action Mechanisms of Cryptotanshinone Intervention.', 'Cryptotanshinone Inhibits the Growth of HCT116 Colorectal Cancer Cells Through Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Autophagy.', 'A Multidisciplinary Approach to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).', 'Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Natural Products as Potentially Therapeutic Agents.']"""

Objective:   To identify which high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients might have favorable pathologic outcomes when surgically treated.  Design, setting, and participants:   We evaluated 1366 patients with high-risk PCa (ie, at least one of the following risk factors: prostate-specific antigen [PSA]>20 ng/ml, cT3, biopsy Gleason 8-10) treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) at eight European centers between 1987 and 2009. A favorable pathologic outcome was defined as specimen-confined (SC) disease-namely, pT2-pT3a, node negative PCa with negative surgical margins.  Intervention:   All patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and PLND.  Measurements:   Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models tested the association between predictors and SC disease. A logistic regression coefficient-based nomogram was developed and internally validated using 200 bootstrap resamples. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to depict biochemical recurrence (BCR) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 505 of 1366 patients (37%) had SC disease at RP. All preoperative variables (ie, age and PSA at surgery, clinical stage, and biopsy Gleason sum) were independent predictors of SC PCa at RP (all p≤0.04). Patients with SC disease had significantly higher 10-yr BCR-free survival and CSS rates than patients without SC disease at RP (66% vs 47% and 98 vs 88%, respectively; all p<0.001). A nomogram including PSA, age, clinical stage, and biopsy Gleason sum demonstrated 72% accuracy in predicting SC PCa. This study is limited by its retrospective design and by the lack of an external validation of the nomogram.  Conclusions:   Roughly 40% of patients with high-risk PCa have SC disease at final pathology. These patients showed excellent long-term outcomes when surgically treated, thus representing the ideal candidates for RP as the primary treatment for PCa.

Methods:   One-year relative survival estimates and data on DCO registrations for patients diagnosed with lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers between 2002 and 2006 were extracted from the UK Cancer Information Service. Direct age standardization was performed with weightings derived from the standard cancer patient population for Europe. Pearson correlation coefficients between survival estimates and DCO proportions were calculated.  Results:   Mean 1-year PCT survival estimates ranged from 6.9 to 19.4 percentage points, and the precision of individual estimates ranged from ±0.9 to ±6.5 percentage points (at 95% confidence level). Age standardization significantly changed the estimates of nine PCTs for breast cancer, five PCTs for lung cancer and three PCTs for colorectal cancer. None of the prostate cancer estimates were affected significantly. DCO proportions were positively associated with lung cancer survival and negatively associated with colorectal and breast cancer survival.

Methods:   A randomized, multi-center clinical trial was conducted with measures at baseline, 1-, and 6 months. Men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer (CaP) who sought consultation at urology, radiation oncology, or multi-disciplinary clinics in 4 geographically-distinct American cities were recruited. Intervention group participants used the Personal Patient Profile-Prostate, a decision support system comprised of customized text and video coaching regarding potential outcomes, influential factors, and communication with care providers. The primary outcome, patient-reported decisional conflict, was evaluated over time using generalized estimating equations to fit generalized linear models. Additional outcomes, time-to-treatment, treatment choice, and program acceptability/usefulness, were explored.  Results:   A total of 494 eligible men were randomized (266 intervention; 228 control). The intervention reduced adjusted decisional conflict over time compared with the control group, for the uncertainty score (estimate -3.61; (confidence interval, -7.01, 0.22), and values clarity (estimate -3.57; confidence interval (-5.85,-1.30). Borderline effect was seen for the total decisional conflict score (estimate -1.75; confidence interval (-3.61,0.11). Time-to-treatment was comparable between groups, while undecided men in the intervention group chose brachytherapy more often than in the control group. Acceptability and usefulness were highly rated.  Conclusion:   The Personal Patient Profile-Prostate is the first intervention to significantly reduce decisional conflict in a multi-center trial of American men with newly diagnosed localized CaP.

Recently, it has been proposed that XMRV is a laboratory contaminant and may have originated via a rare recombination event. Host restriction factor APOBEC3G (A3G) has been reported to severely restrict XMRV replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interestingly, XMRV infects and replicates efficiently in prostate cancer cells of epithelial origin. It has been proposed that due to lack off or very low levels of A3G protein XMRV is able to productively replicate in these cells.  Findings:   This report builds on and challenges the published data on the absence of A3G protein in prostate epithelial cells lines. We demonstrate the presence of A3G in prostate epithelial cell lines (LNCaP and DU145) by western blot and mass spectrometry. We believe the discrepancy in A3G detection is may be due to selection and sensitivity of A3G antibodies employed in the prior studies. Our results also indicate that XMRV produced from A3G expressing LNCaP cells can infect and replicate in target cells. Most importantly our data reveal downregulation of A3G in XMRV infected LNCaP and DU145 cells.  Conclusions:   We propose that XMRV replicates efficiently in prostate epithelial cells by downregulating A3G expression. Given that XMRV lacks accessory proteins such as HIV-1 Vif that are known to counteract A3G function in human cells, our data suggest a novel mechanism by which retroviruses can counteract the antiviral effects of A3G proteins.""","""['Abhinav Dey', 'Chinmay Kumar Mantri', 'Jui Pandhare-Dash', 'Bindong Liu', 'Siddharth Pratap', 'Chandravanu Dash']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Virol J""","""['Inhibition of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus by APOBEC3 proteins and antiviral drugs.', 'Severe restriction of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus replication and spread in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.', 'Human APOBEC3 proteins can inhibit xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus infectivity.', 'Lack of evidence for a role of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and/or chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-Related Virus (XMRV) and the Safety of the Blood Supply.', 'The saga of XMRV: a virus that infects human cells but is not a human virus.', 'In-depth investigation of archival and prospectively collected samples reveals no evidence for XMRV infection in prostate cancer.', 'A novel role for APOBEC3: susceptibility to sexual transmission of murine acquired immunodeficiency virus (mAIDS) is aggravated in APOBEC3 deficient mice.', 'Identification of XMRV infection-associated microRNAs in four cell types in culture.']"""

Methods:   In 40-81 year-old men without prostate cancer discovered at initial digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, a case-cohort design measured the association between baseline HHV-8 seropositivity (modified immunofluorescence assay for antibodies against HHV-8 lytic antigens) and incident prostate cancer detected at DRE and PSA screenings three or five years later.  Results:   Analyses included 486 unique individuals, 96 incident prostate cancer cases, and 415 randomly selected subjects representing an at-risk cohort. By design, the random sub-cohort contained 25 incident prostate cancer cases. In the sub-cohort, the frequency of HHV-8 seropositivity increased across age groupings (40-49 years: 3.5%, 50-59 years: 13.6%, and ≥ 60 years: 22.9%). HHV-8 seropositivity was higher in men with elevated (≥ 4.0 ng/mL) than men with non-elevated PSA at initial screening (30.4% vs. 9.9% seropositive; crude odds ratio (OR) 3.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53-10.2; age-adjusted OR 2.42, 95% CI 0.91-6.47). HHV-8 seropositivity did not increase incident prostate cancer risk (age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.46-1.69).  Conclusions:   Case-cohort analysis did not identify association between HHV-8 seropositivity and incident prostate cancer.

Whereas fresh-frozen tissue is well suited for a broad spectrum of molecular analyses, its storage and handling is complex and cost-intensive. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens (FFPE) are easy to handle and economic to store, but their applicability for molecular methods is restricted. The recently introduced Hepes-glutamic acid-buffer mediated Organic solvent Protection Effect (HOPE) is a promising alternative, which might have the potential to unite the benefits of FFPE and fresh-frozen specimen. Aim of the study was to compare HOPE-fixed, FFPE and fresh-frozen bio-specimens for their accessibility for diagnostic and research purposes.  Methods:   10 prostate cancer samples were each preserved with HOPE, formalin, and liquid nitrogen and studied with in-situ and molecular methods. Samples were H&E stained, and assessed by immunohistochemistry (i.e. PSA, GOLPH2, p63) and FISH (i.e. ERG rearrangement). We assessed DNA integrity by PCR, using control genes ranging from 100 to 600 bp amplicon size. RNA integrity was assessed through qRT-PCR on three housekeeping genes (TBP, GAPDH, β-actin). Protein expression was analysed by performing western blot analysis using GOLPH2 and PSA antibodies.  Results:   Of the HOPE samples, morphologic quality of H&E sections, immunohistochemical staining, and the FISH assay was at least equal to FFPE tissue, and significantly better than the fresh-frozen specimens. DNA, RNA, and protein analysis of HOPE samples provided similar results as compared to fresh-frozen specimens. As expected, FFPE-samples were inferior for most of the molecular analyses.  Conclusions:   This is the first study, comparatively assessing the suitability of these fixation methods for diagnostic and research utilization. Overall, HOPE-fixed bio-specimens combine the benefits of FFPE- and fresh-frozen samples.

A crucial step toward this goal is to characterize the clinical performance of a marker for predicting different types of events. In this article, we present statistical methods for evaluating the performance of a prognostic marker in predicting multiple competing events. To capture the potential time-varying predictive performance of the marker and incorporate competing risks, we define time- and cause-specific accuracy summaries by stratifying cases based on causes of failure. Such definition would allow one to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a marker for each type of event and compare its predictiveness across event types. Extending the nonparametric crude cause-specific receiver operating characteristics curve estimators by Saha and Heagerty (2010), we develop inference procedures for a range of cause-specific accuracy summaries. To estimate the accuracy measures and assess how covariates may affect the accuracy of a marker under the competing risk setting, we consider two forms of semiparametric models through the cause-specific hazard framework. These approaches enable a flexible modeling of the relationships between the marker and failure times for each cause, while efficiently accommodating additional covariates.

Material and methods:   Seventy-seven patients were recruited from three clinics and followed prospectively until death, clinical deterioration making the patient unfit for participation, or the end of the study. Median age was 74 (range 54-85) years, and the median follow-up was 18 (3-90) months. Parameters and endpoints were total score on the Danish Prostatic Symptom Score (DAN-PSS-1) questionnaire, maximum flow rate, postvoid residual volume, frequency and voided volume, and prostate volume on transrectal ultrasonography.  Results:   All parameters improved significantly in the range of median 13-50% within the first 12 months. The greater part of the effect occurred during the first month, and thereafter the improvement rate slowed down. Intervention for local progression was estimated on Kaplan-Meier analysis to be about 20% after 4 years. 73% had a defined prostate-specific antigen nadir after a median of 6 (1-60) months with scheduled assessments up to 72 months after the nadir. All parameters were improved before the nadir and the improvement remained during biochemical progression except for the very latest visits where few patients contributed to the analyses.  Conclusions:   Androgen deprivation therapy improved lower urinary tract symptoms, objective voiding parameters and prostate volume in patients with prostate cancer who were not candidates for curative treatment. The improvement was significant within the first month and clinically relevant.

We have proposed an integrated machine learning method that combines two machine-learning methods-Random Forests (RF) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)-to identify a subset of important SNPs and detect interaction patterns more effectively and efficiently. In this two-stage RF-MARS (TRM) approach, RF is first applied to detect a predictive subset of SNPs, and then MARS is used to identify the interaction patterns. We evaluated the TRM performances in four models. RF variable selection was based on out-of-bag classification error rate (OOB) and variable important spectrum (IS). Our results support that RF(OOB) had better performance than MARS and RF(IS) in detecting important variables. This study demonstrates that TRM(OOB) , which is RF(OOB) plus MARS, has combined the strengths of RF and MARS in identifying SNP-SNP interactions in a scenario of 100 candidate SNPs. TRM(OOB) had greater true positive rate and lower false positive rate compared with MARS, particularly for searching interactions with a strong association with the outcome.

Radiotherapy is often used in the treatment for prostate cancer. In radiotherapy treatment, the oncologist makes a trade-off between the risk and benefit of the radiation, i.e., the task is to deliver a high dose to the prostate cancer cells and minimize side effects of the treatment. The aim of our research is to develop a software system that will assist the oncologist in planning new treatments.  Methods:   A nonlinear case-based reasoning system is developed to capture the expertise and experience of oncologists in treating previous patients. Importance (weights) of different clinical parameters in the dose planning is determined by the oncologist based on their past experience, and is highly subjective. The weights are usually fixed in the system. In this research, the weights are updated automatically each time after generating a treatment plan for a new patient using a group based simulated annealing approach.  Results:   The developed approach is analyzed on the real data set collected from the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, City Hospital Campus, UK. Extensive experiments show that the dose plan suggested by the proposed method is coherent with the dose plan prescribed by an experienced oncologist or even better.  Conclusions:   The developed case-based reasoning system enables the use of knowledge and experience gained by the oncologist in treating new patients. This system may play a vital role to assist the oncologist in making a better decision in less computational time; it utilizes the success rate of the previously treated patients and it can also be used in teaching and training processes.""","""['Nishikant Mishra', 'Sanja Petrovic', 'Santhanam Sundar']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Optimizing the use of radiotherapy with IMRT and image guided location of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Use of benchmark dose-volume histograms for selection of the optimal technique between three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Adaptive radiation therapy for compensation of errors in patient setup and treatment delivery.', 'A study of image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy with fiducials for localized prostate cancer including pelvic lymph nodes.', 'Knowledge-based computer systems for radiotherapy planning.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'Knowledge-based planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A review of data-driven approaches.', 'A Dynamic Model of Rescuer Parameters for Optimizing Blood Gas Delivery during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.', 'Similar-case-based optimization of beam arrangements in stereotactic body radiotherapy for assisting treatment planners.']"""

However, planning margins are still necessary to account for uncertainties such as deformation and intra-fraction motion. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of an adaptive planning technique incorporating offline dose feedback to manage inter-fraction motion and residuals from online correction.  Methods:   Repeated helical CT scans from 28 patients were included in the study. The contours of prostate and organs-at-risk (OARs) were delineated on each CT, and online IG was simulated by matching center-of-mass of prostate between treatment CTs and planning CT. A seven beam intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan was designed for each patient on planning CT for a total of 15 fractions. Dose distribution at each fraction was evaluated based on actual contours of the target and OARs from that fraction. Cumulative dose up to each fraction was calculated by tracking each voxel based on a deformable registration algorithm. The cumulative dose was compared with the dose from initial plan. If the deviation exceeded the pre-defined threshold, such as 2% of the D₉₉ to the prostate, an adaptive planning technique called dose compensation was invoked, in which the cumulative dose distribution was fed back to the treatment planning system and the dose deficit was made up through boost radiation in future treatment fractions. The dose compensation was achieved by IMRT inverse planning. Two weekly compensation delivery strategies were simulated: one intended to deliver the boost dose in all future fractions (schedule A) and the other in the following week only (schedule B). The D₉₉ to prostate and generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) to rectal wall and bladder were computed and compared with those without the dose compensation.  Results:   If only 2% underdose is allowed at the end of the treatment course, then 11 patients fail. If the same criteria is assessed at the end of each week (every five fractions), then 14 patients fail, with three patients failing the 1st or 2nd week but passing at the end. The average dose deficit from these 14 patients was 4.4%. They improved to 2% after the weekly compensation. Out of these 14 patients who needed dose compensation, ten passed the dose criterion after weekly dose compensation, three patients failed marginally, and one patient still failed the criterion significantly (10% deficit), representing 3.6% of the patient population. A more aggressive compensation frequency (every three fractions) could successfully reduce the dose deficit to the acceptable level for this patient. The average number of required dose compensation re-planning per patient was 0.82 (0.79) per patient for schedule A (B) delivery strategy. The doses to OARs were not significantly different from the online IG only plans without dose compensation.  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated the effectiveness of offline dose compensation technique in image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer. It can effectively account for residual uncertainties which cannot be corrected through online IG. Dose compensation allows further margin reduction and critical organs sparing.""","""['Han Liu', 'Qiuwen Wu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Application of dose compensation in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Online image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: How much improvement can we expect?

Our goal was to determine the incidence of surgical complications resulting from robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) during the initial phase of a new robotics program that was developed by two surgeons without laparoscopic or robotic fellowship training. A secondary goal was to see if experience changed the incidence of complications with this technology.  Patients and methods:   A prospectively maintained database was used to evaluate the first 1000 consecutive patients who were treated with RALP from January 2004 to June 2009. The database was reviewed for evidence of complications in the perioperative period. All patients underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy by two surgeons. Complications were confirmed and supplemented by retrospectively reviewing the departmental morbidity and mortality reports, as well as the hospital records. The Clavien classification system, a standardized and validated scale for complication reporting, was applied to all events. The complication rate was determined per 100 patients treated and tested with logistic regression for a relationship with surgeon experience.  Results:   Ninety-seven (9.7%) patients experienced a total of 116 complications; 81 patients experienced a single complication and 16 patients experienced ≥2 complications. The majority of complications (71%) were either grade I or II. The complication rate decreased with experience when the first 500 cases were compared with the latter 500 cases (P=0.007). All the data were reviewed retrospectively. Involvement of residents/fellows increased as primary surgeon experience improved.  Conclusions:   Complications after RALP are most commonly minor, requiring expectant or medical management only, even during the initiation of a RALP program.

Lifetime risk estimates provided by genetic testing refer to the risk of developing a specific disease within one's lifetime, and evidence suggests that this is important for the medical choices people make, as well as their future family and financial plans. The present studies tested whether adult men understand the lifetime risks of prostate cancer informed by genetic testing.  Method:   In 2 experiments, adult men were asked to interpret the lifetime risk information provided in statements about risks of prostate cancer. Statement format was manipulated such that the most appropriate interpretation of risk statements referred to an absolute risk of cancer in experiment 1 and a relative risk in experiment 2.  Results:   Experiment 1 revealed that few men correctly interpreted the lifetime risks of cancer when these refer to an absolute risk of cancer, and numeracy levels positively predicted correct responding. The proportion of correct responses was greatly improved in experiment 2 when the most appropriate interpretation of risk statements referred instead to a relative rather than an absolute risk, and numeracy levels were less involved.  Conclusion:   Understanding of lifetime risk information is often poor because individuals incorrectly believe that these refer to relative rather than absolute risks of cancer.""","""['Jonathan J Rolison', 'Yaniv Hanoch', 'Talya Miron-Shatz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Health Psychol""","""['American Society of Clinical Oncology policy statement update: genetic testing for cancer susceptibility.', 'Risk perception and concern among brothers of men with prostate carcinoma.', 'Prophylactic Oophorectomy: Reducing the U.S. Death Rate from Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.

Unlike STAT3, where significant medicinal effort has been expended to identify potent direct inhibitors, Stat5 has been poorly investigated as a molecular therapeutic target. Thus, in an effort to identify direct inhibitors of STAT5 protein, we conducted an in vitro screen of a focused library of SH2 domain binding salicylic acid-containing inhibitors (∼150) against STAT5, as well as against STAT3 and STAT1 proteins for SH2 domain selectivity.

However, the exact role of SIM2 in cancer in general, and in prostate cancer in particular, remains largely unknown. This study was designed to elucidate the role of SIM2 in prostate cancer using a shRNA-based approach in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line.  Methods:   Lentiviral shRNAs were used to inhibit SIM2 gene and protein levels in PC3 cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and branched DNA were performed to evaluate transcript expression. SIM2 protein expression level was measured by western blot. Profiling of gene expression spanning the whole genome, as well as polar metabolomics of several major metabolic pathways was performed to identify major pathway dysregulations.  Results:   SIM2 gene and protein products were significantly downregulated by lenti-shRNA in PC3 cell line. This low expression of SIM2 affected gene expression profile, revealing significant changes in major signaling pathways, networks and functions. In addition, major metabolic pathways were affected.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our results suggest an involvement of SIM2 in key traits of prostate tumor cell biology and might underlie a contribution of this transcription factor to prostate cancer onset and progression.""","""['Bin Lu', 'John M Asara', 'Martin G Sanda', 'Mohamed S Arredouani']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Identification of the transcription factor single-minded homologue 2 as a potential biomarker and immunotherapy target in prostate cancer.', ""Down's syndrome-associated single minded gene as a novel tumor marker."", 'Increased expression of SIM2-s protein is a novel marker of aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Elevated AKR1C3 expression promotes prostate cancer cell survival and prostate cell-mediated endothelial cell tube formation: implications for prostate cancer progression.', 'Metabolic reprogramming in prostate cancer.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Methylated DNA markers for plasma detection of ovarian cancer: Discovery, validation, and clinical feasibility.', 'Investigating the Role of Obesity in Prostate Cancer and Identifying Biomarkers for Drug Discovery: Systems Biology and Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Single-minded 2 is required for left-right asymmetric stomach morphogenesis.', 'Chromatin-directed proteomics-identified network of endogenous androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.']"""

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism underlying the prevention of prostate cell growth by 17-HASs still remains elusive. Here, we assess the effects of 17-HASs on androgen receptor (AR) activity in LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells. We demonstrate that both TOK-001 and abiraterone reduced AR protein and mRNA expression, and antagonized AR-dependent promoter activation induced by androgen. TOK-001, but not abiraterone, is an effective apparent competitor of the radioligand [(3)H]R1881 for binding to the wild type and various mutant AR (W741C, W741L) proteins. In agreement with these data, TOK-001 is a consistently superior inhibitor than abiraterone of R1881-induced transcriptional activity of both wild type and mutant AR. However, neither agent was able to trans-activate the AR in the absence of R1881. Our data demonstrate that phospho-4EBP1 levels are significantly reduced by TOK-001 and to a lesser extent by abiraterone alcohol, and suggest a mechanism by which cap-dependent translation is suppressed by blocking assembly of the eIF4F and eIF4G complex to the mRNA 5' cap. Thus, the effects of these 17-HASs on AR signaling are complex, ranging from a decrease in testosterone production through the inhibition of Cyp17 as previously described, to directly reducing both AR protein expression and R1881-induced AR trans-activation.""","""['Harris S Soifer', 'Naira Souleimanian', 'Sijian Wu', 'Anatoliy M Voskresenskiy', 'Filiz Kisaayak Collak', 'Bekir Cinar', 'Cy A Stein']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Novel C-17-heteroaryl steroidal CYP17 inhibitors/antiandrogens: synthesis, in vitro biological activity, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity in the LAPC4 human prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Resistance to CYP17A1 inhibition with abiraterone in castration-resistant prostate cancer: induction of steroidogenesis and androgen receptor splice variants.', 'Antiandrogenic effects of novel androgen synthesis inhibitors on hormone-dependent prostate cancer.', 'Androgen synthesis inhibitors in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.', 'A hotspot for posttranslational modifications on the androgen receptor dimer interface drives pathology and anti-androgen resistance.', 'Antiandrogenic Effects of a Polyphenol in Carex kobomugi through Inhibition of Androgen Synthetic Pathway and Downregulation of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Therapeutic Sequences in the Treatment of High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Paving the Way Towards Multimodal Tailored Approaches.', 'Novel Treatment Strategy Using Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitors for Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy compared to androgen deprivation therapy only for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.']"""

CBP cannot compensate for the loss of p300 to support androgen-induced expression of many genes, such as TMPRSS2 and PSA. Global gene expression analysis indicated that 47% of androgen-regulated genes are p300-dependent in these cells, whereas, surprisingly, only 0.3% of them are CBP-dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis after depletion of cellular p300 indicated that p300 is required for androgen-induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4, methylation of histone H3 at Lys-4, and recruitment of TATA box binding protein (TBP) and RNA polymerase II, but not recruitment of the androgen receptor, on the TMPRSS2 gene in response to androgen.

In studying its mechanism of action, we have discovered that sGCα1 can inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 in prostate cancer cells independent of either classical mediators of NO signaling or the guanylyl cyclase activity of sGCα1. Interestingly, sGCα1 inhibition of p53-regulated gene expression was gene specific, targeting genes involved in apoptosis/cell survival. Consistent with this, overexpression of sGCα1 makes prostate cancer cells more resistant to etoposide, a chemotherapeutic and apoptosis-inducing drug. Immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry assays show a physical and direct interaction between sGCα1 and p53 in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, sGCα1 induces p53 cytoplasmic sequestration, representing a new mechanism of p53 inactivation in prostate cancer. Analysis of prostate tumors has shown a direct expression correlation between sGCα1 and p53.

We performed a small prospective controlled clinical trial to assess the influence of the treatment with Atorvastatin on serum PSA in men with hypercholesterolemia referred to our educational and treatment center from October 2007 to March 2008. In this study, among the newly diagnosed males with hypercholesterolemia (LDL > 130 mg/dl), 40 patients with LDL more than 190 mg/dl were selected as a case group and were treated with Atorvastatin (20 mg/day). Among the same population and in the same period, another 40 patients with LDL between 130 and 190 mg/dl were selected as first control group and were treated only with low fat diet. Another 40 patients with normal serum cholesterol and without any treatment were selected as second control group. The lipid profile and serum PSA level of patients of all groups were tested at the first and third months after the therapy. After completion of data, the mean serum lipids and PSA level were measured in both visits and compared with each other by paired t-test. Also the mean PSA change in two visits between three groups was compared by ANOVA and Tukey HSD test. There was not any significant difference in mean baseline PSA between hypercholesterolemic and normocholesterolemic patients (P=0.547). In case group, mean PSA and LDL was reduced by 14.1% (P=0.0001) and 30% (P=0.0001) respectively by second visit. In first control group, mean PSA was not changed significantly (P=0.337), whereas mean LDL in this group was reduced by 9.6% (P= 0.0001). Similarly in the second control group mean PSA was not changed significantly (P=0.309) by second visit. In addition, mean change of PSA in case group was compared with first and second control groups that was significantly different (P=0.0001) whereas mean change of PSA between two control groups was not significantly different (P=0.615). The results of this study showed that: 1) Short term treatment with Atorvastatin can reduce serum PSA level, and 2) This reduction is more likely to be due to direct effect and is not related to lowering serum cholesterol levels.

The direct effect of IL-4 on cancer cells has been associated with increased cell survival; however, its role in cancer cell proliferation and related mechanisms is still unclear. Here it was shown that in a nutrient-depleted environment, IL-4 induces proliferation in prostate cancer PC3 cells. In these cells, under nutrient-depletion stress, IL-4 activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including Erk, p38, and JNK. Using MAP-signaling-specific inhibitors, it was shown that IL-4-induced proliferation is mediated by JNK activation. In fact, JNK-inhibitor-V (JNKi-V) stunted IL-4-mediated cell proliferation. Furthermore, it was found that IL-4 induces survivin up-regulation in nutrient-depleted cancer cells. Using survivin-short-hairpin-RNAs (shRNAs), it was demonstrated that in this milieu survivin expression above a threshold limit is critical to the mechanism of IL-4-mediated proliferation. In addition, the significance of survivin up-regulation in a stressed environment was assessed in prostate cancer mouse xenografts. It was found that survivin knockdown decreases tumor progression in correlation with cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, under nutrient depletion stress, IL -4 could induce proliferation in cancer cells from multiple origins: MDA-MB-231 (breast), A253 (head and neck), and SKOV-3 (ovarian).

AKT and BAD phosphorylation were blocked by the selective CaM KK inhibitor, STO-609, as well as siRNA directed against CaM KK. BAD phosphorylation was also blocked by treating cells with the AKT inhibitor, AKT-X, as well as siRNA to AKT.

By contrast, the PKA activator 6-Benz-cAMP caused a dose-dependent increase in p-CREB, but not Epac1. We measured mTORC2-dependent Akt phosphorylation at S473 in immunoprecipitates of mTOR or Rictor from 1-LN cells. 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP caused a two-threefold increase in p-Akt(S473) and Akt(S473) kinase activity in Rictor immunoprecipitates. By contrast, there was only a negligible effect on p-Akt(T308) in Rictor immunoprecipitates.

In this study, we tested the antitumor efficacy of a selective TGF-β receptor I kinase inhibitor, LY2109761, in preclinical models. The effect of LY2109761 on the growth of MDA PCa 2b and PC-3 human PCa cells and primary mouse osteoblasts (PMOs) was assessed in vitro by measuring radiolabeled thymidine incorporation into DNA. In vivo, the right femurs of male SCID mice were injected with PCa cells. We monitored the tumor burden in control- and LY2109761-treated mice with MRI analysis and the PCa-induced bone response with X-ray and micro-CT analyses. Histologic changes in bone were studied by performing bone histomorphometric evaluations. PCa cells and PMOs expressed TGF-β receptor I. TGF-β1 induced pathway activation (as assessed by induced expression of p-Smad2) and inhibited cell growth in PC-3 cells and PMOs but not in MDA PCa 2b cells. LY2109761 had no effect on PCa cells but induced PMO proliferation in vitro. As expected, LY2109761 reversed the TGF-β1-induced pathway activation and growth inhibition in PC-3 cells and PMOs. In vivo, LY2109761 treatment for 6weeks resulted in increased volume in normal bone and increased osteoblast and osteoclast parameters. In addition, LY2109761 treatment significantly inhibited the growth of MDA PCa 2b and PC-3 in the bone of SCID mice (p<0.05); moreover, it resulted in significantly less bone loss and change in osteoclast-associated parameters in the PC-3 tumor-bearing bones than in the untreated mice. In summary, we report for the first time that targeting TGF-β receptors with LY2109761 can control PCa bone growth while increasing the mass of normal bone. This increased bone mass in nontumorous bone may be a desirable side effect of LY2109761 treatment for men with osteopenia or osteoporosis secondary to androgen-ablation therapy, reinforcing the benefit of effectively controlling PCa growth in bone.

Methods and materials:   Between 1998 and 2001, 1,310 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with EBRT (n = 897) or brachytherapy (n = 413). We compared the incidence of SMs in our patients with that of the general population extracted from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data set combined with the 2000 census data.  Results:   The 10-year likelihood of SM development was 25% after EBRT and 15% after brachytherapy (p = .02). The corresponding 10-year likelihood for in-field SM development in these groups was 4.9% and 1.6% (p = .24). Multivariate analysis showed that EBRT vs. brachytherapy and older age were the only significant predictors for the development of all SMs (p = .037 and p = .030), with a trend for older patients to develop a SM. The increased incidence of SM for EBRT patients was explained by the greater incidence of skin cancer outside the radiation field compared with that after brachytherapy (10.6% and 3.3%, respectively, p = .004). For the EBRT group, the 5- and 10-year mortality rate was 1.96% and 5.1% from out-of field cancer, respectively; for in-field SM, the corresponding mortality rates were 0.1% and 0.7%. Among the brachytherapy group, the 5- and 10-year mortality rate related to out-of field SM was 0.8% and 2.7%, respectively. Our observed SM rates after prostate RT were not significantly different from the cancer incidence rates in the general population.  Conclusions:   Using modern sophisticated treatment techniques, we report low rates of in-field bladder and rectal SM risks after prostate cancer RT. Furthermore, the likelihood of mortality secondary to a SM was unusual. The greater rate of SM observed with EBRT vs. brachytherapy was related to a small, but significantly increased, number of skin cancers in the EBRT patients compared with that of the general population.""","""['Michael J Zelefsky', 'Douglas M Housman', 'Xin Pei', 'Zumre Alicikus', 'Juan Martin Magsanoc', 'Lawrence T Dauer', 'Jean St Germain', 'Yoshiya Yamada', 'Marisa Kollmeier', 'Brett Cox', 'Zhigang Zhang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Secondary cancers after intensity-modulated radiotherapy, brachytherapy and radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer: incidence and cause-specific survival outcomes according to the initial treatment intervention.', 'Commentary on ""secondary cancers after intensity-modulated radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer: incidence and cause-specific survival outcomes according to the initial treatment intervention.""

Methods and materials:   Between 1999 and 2008, 225 node-negative patients were referred for HD-ART with or without ADT to two large academic institutions. Indications for HD-ART were extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and/or positive surgical margins at radical prostatectomy (RP). A dose of at least 69.1 Gy was prescribed to the prostate bed and seminal vesicle bed. The ADT consisted of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog. The duration and indication of ADT was left at the discretion of the treating physician. The effect of HD-ART and ADT on biochemical (bRFS) and clinical (cRFS) relapse-free survival was examined through univariate and multivariate analysis, with correction for known patient- and treatment-related variables. Interaction terms were introduced to evaluate effect modification.  Results:   After a median follow-up time of 5 years, the 7-year bRFS and cRFS were 84% and 88%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the addition of ADT was independently associated with an improved bRFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, p = 0.02) and cRFS (HR 0.2, p = 0.008). Higher Gleason scores and SVI were associated with decreased bRFS and cRFS. A lymphadenectomy at the time of RP independently improved cRFS (HR 0.09, p = 0.009). The 7-year probability of late Grade 2-3 toxicity was 29% and 5% for genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, respectively. The absolute incidence of Grade 3 toxicity was <1% and 10% for GI and GU symptoms, respectively. The study is limited by its retrospective design and the lack of a standardized use of ADT.

The androgen receptor (AR) is vital for prostate cancer progression, even in the face of castrate levels of serum testosterone following androgen ablation therapy, a mainstay therapy for advanced prostate cancer. Downregulation of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), a major intracellular antioxidant enzyme, occurs progressively during prostate cancer progression to advanced states and is known to promote AR activity in prostate cancer. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of SOD mimetics on AR expression and function in AR-dependent LNCaP, CWR22Rv1, and LAPC-4AD prostate cancer cells. Treatment with Tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl), a SOD mimetic, not only lowered cellular superoxide levels but also concomitantly attenuated AR transcriptional activity and AR target gene expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, in the presence and absence of dihydrotestosterone, the major endogenous AR agonist. Inhibition of AR by Tempol was mediated, in large part, by its ability to decrease AR protein via increased degradation, in the absence of any inhibitory effects on other nuclear receptors.

Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) has been associated with tumor progression, poor prognosis, and with the androgen-independent status. Currently, no successful therapy exists for advanced, castration-resistant disease. Because hypoxia has been linked to prostate cancer progression and unfavorable outcome, we sought to determine whether hypoxia would impact the degree of neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells in vitro.  Results:   Exposure of LNCaP cells to low oxygen tension induced a neuroendocrine phenotype, associated with an increased expression of the transcription factor neurogenin3 and neuroendocrine markers, such as neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A, and β3-tubulin. Moreover, hypoxia triggered a significant decrease of Notch 1 and Notch 2 mRNA and protein expression, with subsequent downregulation of Notch-mediated signaling, as shown by reduced levels of the Notch target genes, Hes1 and Hey1. NED was promoted by attenuation of Hes1 transcription, as cells expressing a dominant-negative form of Hes1 displayed increased levels of neuroendocrine markers under normoxic conditions. Although hypoxia downregulated Notch 1 and Notch 2 mRNA transcription and receptor activation also in the androgen-independent cell lines, PC-3 and Du145, it did not change the extent of NED in these cultures, suggesting that androgen sensitivity may be required for transdifferentiation to occur.  Conclusions:   Hypoxia induces NED of LNCaP cells in vitro, which seems to be driven by the inhibition of Notch signaling with subsequent downregulation of Hes1 transcription.""","""['Giovanna Danza', 'Claudia Di Serio', 'Fabiana Rosati', 'Giuseppe Lonetto', 'Niccolò Sturli', 'Doreen Kacer', 'Antonio Pennella', 'Giuseppina Ventimiglia', 'Riccardo Barucci', 'Annamaria Piscazzi', 'Igor Prudovsky', 'Matteo Landriscina', 'Niccolò Marchionni', 'Francesca Tarantini']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Differential Notch1 and Notch2 expression and frequent activation of Notch signaling in gastric cancers.', 'Inflammatory cytokines induce NOTCH signaling in nucleus pulposus cells: implications in intervertebral disc degeneration.', 'Prostate tumor OVerexpressed-1 (PTOV1) down-regulates HES1 and HEY1 notch targets genes and promotes prostate cancer progression.', 'Notch signaling in prostate cancer: a moving target.', 'Aggressive variants of prostate cancer: underlying mechanisms of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.', 'Targeting PKLR/MYCN/ROMO1 signaling suppresses neuroendocrine differentiation of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The roles of proteases in prostate cancer.', 'βIII-Tubulin Gene Regulation in Health and Disease.', 'Proteomic and Transcriptomic Profiling Reveals Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation as Therapeutic Vulnerability in Androgen Receptor Pathway Active Prostate Tumors.', 'RB1 loss in castration-resistant prostate cancer confers vulnerability to LSD1 inhibition.']"""

The objective of this study was to create an area-based socioeconomic position (SEP) index to assess possible socioeconomic disparities in incidence and mortality of selected cancers in Puerto Rico.  Methods:   Data for cancer incidence and mortality from 1995 to 2004 were obtained from the Puerto Rico Central Cancer Registry and the Puerto Rico Department of Health, and Puerto Rico socioeconomic data were obtained from the US Census 2000. We used principal component and factor analysis methods to construct the SEP index at the municipality level. We calculated age-adjusted incidence and mortality for each SEP area and used rate ratios to evaluate the differences by SEP.  Results:   Incidence and mortality of cancer in Puerto Rico varied by SEP area. In general, the incidence and mortality for cancers of the esophagus and stomach were higher for municipalities with the lowest SEP; in contrast, rates for breast, colorectal, kidney, pancreas, prostate, and thyroid were higher for areas with the highest SEP.

Methods:   We conducted a cohort study of patients with incident prostate cancer registered in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1997 through 2008. We identified patients diagnosed with IHD or stroke prior to the date of prostate cancer diagnosis in the Danish National Patient Registry. We constructed Kaplan-Meier curves to analyze time to death and Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) to compare mortality rates by preexisting IHD or stroke status, adjusting for age, stage, comorbidity, and calendar period.  Results:   Of 30,721 prostate cancer patients, 4,276 (14%) had preexisting IHD and 1,331 (4%) preexisting stroke. Crude 1- and 5-year survival rates were 85% and 44% in men without preexisting IHD or stroke, 81% and 36% in men with preexisting IHD, and 78% and 27% in men with preexisting stroke.

During the period 1950-2003, 58% of the 86,611 LSS cohort members with DS02 dose estimates have died. The 6 years of additional follow-up since the previous report provide substantially more information at longer periods after radiation exposure (17% more cancer deaths), especially among those under age 10 at exposure (58% more deaths). Poisson regression methods were used to investigate the magnitude of the radiation-associated risks, the shape of the dose response, and effect modification by gender, age at exposure, and attained age. The risk of all causes of death was positively associated with radiation dose. Importantly, for solid cancers the additive radiation risk (i.e., excess cancer cases per 10(4) person-years per Gy) continues to increase throughout life with a linear dose-response relationship. The sex-averaged excess relative risk per Gy was 0.42 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32, 0.53] for all solid cancer at age 70 years after exposure at age 30 based on a linear model. The risk increased by about 29% per decade decrease in age at exposure (95% CI: 17%, 41%). The estimated lowest dose range with a significant ERR for all solid cancer was 0 to 0.20 Gy, and a formal dose-threshold analysis indicated no threshold; i.e., zero dose was the best estimate of the threshold. The risk of cancer mortality increased significantly for most major sites, including stomach, lung, liver, colon, breast, gallbladder, esophagus, bladder and ovary, whereas rectum, pancreas, uterus, prostate and kidney parenchyma did not have significantly increased risks. An increased risk of non-neoplastic diseases including the circulatory, respiratory and digestive systems was observed, but whether these are causal relationships requires further investigation.

This study reports on the experience of a single hospital using both techniques.  Material and methods:   From July 2009 to March 2011, 170 patients underwent RARP. EP was chosen in 103 patients and TP in 67. TP was preferred in cases previous mesh hernia repair or if extended lymph-node dissection (LND) was considered necessary. Otherwise, EP was performed; it was preferred in cases of obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m(2)) or previous intra-abdominal surgery.  Results:   There were no significant differences in preoperative mean age (64.4 vs 65.6 years), BMI (26.5 vs 26.3 kg/m(2)) or prostate size (51.8 vs 55.8 cm(3)) between EP and TP patients. Owing to preoperative selection criteria, prostate-specific antigen levels and the average Gleason score were significantly lower in EP than in TP patients (p < 0.001). Whereas access time and time for anastomosis did not differ significantly (21 vs 19 min, p = 0.11, and 26 vs 24 min, p = 0.36, respectively), overall surgical time was significantly longer in TP (225 vs 191 min, p < 0.001).

Time until first defecation and last analgesic treatment were significantly shorter in EP (p < 0.05).

Using PCa cells conditionally expressing Runx2, we previously identified Runx2-regulated genes with known roles in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasiveness, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix proteolysis and osteolysis. To map Runx2-occupied regions (R2ORs) in PCa cells, we first analyzed regions predicted to bind Runx2 based on the expression data, and found that recruitment to sites upstream of the KLK2 and CSF2 genes was cyclical over time. Genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis at a time of maximum occupancy at these sites revealed 1603 high-confidence R2ORs, enriched with cognate motifs for RUNX, GATA and ETS TFs. The R2ORs were distributed with little regard to annotated transcription start sites (TSSs), mainly in introns and intergenic regions. Runx2-upregulated genes, however, displayed enrichment for R2ORs within 40 kb of their TSSs. The main annotated functions enriched in 98 Runx2-upregulated genes with nearby R2ORs were related to invasiveness and membrane trafficking/secretion.

Its activity is anomalously high in several solid (prostate, mammary gland, lung, kidney and head and neck) and haematological tumours (AML, CML and PML), creating conditions favouring the onset of cancer. Cancer cells become addicted to high levels of CK2 activity and therefore this kinase is a remarkable example of ""non-oncogene addiction"". CK2 is a validated target for cancer therapy with one inhibitor in phase I clinical trials. Several crystal structures of CK2 are available, many in complex with ATP-competitive inhibitors, showing the presence of regions with remarkable flexibility. We present the structural characterisation of these regions by means of seven new crystal structures, in the apo form and in complex with inhibitors. We confirm previous findings about the unique flexibility of the CK2α catalytic subunit in the hinge/αD region, the p-loop and the β4β5 loop, and show here that there is no clear-cut correlation between the conformations of these flexible zones. Our findings challenge some of the current interpretations on the functional role of these regions and dispute the hypothesis that small ligands stabilize an inactive state. The mobility of the hinge/αD region in the human enzyme is unique among protein kinases, and this can be exploited for the development of more selective ATP-competitive inhibitors. The identification of different ligand binding modes to a secondary site can provide hints for the design of non-ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting the interaction between the α catalytic and the β regulatory subunits.""","""['Elena Papinutto', 'Alessandro Ranchio', 'Graziano Lolli', 'Lorenzo A Pinna', 'Roberto Battistutta']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Struct Biol""","""['The catalytic subunit of human protein kinase CK2 structurally deviates from its maize homologue in complex with the nucleotide competitive inhibitor emodin.', 'Low-density crystal packing of human protein kinase CK2 catalytic subunit in complex with resorufin or other ligands: a tool to study the unique hinge-region plasticity of the enzyme without packing bias.', 'First inactive conformation of CK2 alpha, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase CK2.', 'Conformational plasticity of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase CK2 and its consequences for regulation and drug design.', 'Structural and functional determinants of protein kinase CK2α: facts and open questions.', 'Mechanism of CK2 Inhibition by a Ruthenium-Based Polyoxometalate.', 'Alternaria toxins as casein kinase 2 inhibitors and possible consequences for estrogenicity: a hybrid in silico/in vitro study.', '2-Aminothiazole Derivatives as Selective Allosteric Modulators of the Protein Kinase CK2. 1.

The utilisation of potent, sequence-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) to facilitate down-regulation of complementary mRNA sequences in vitro and in vivo has stimulated the development of siRNA-based cancer therapies. However, the lack of an effective siRNA delivery system significantly retards clinical application. Amphiphilic polycations with 'stealth' capacity have previously been synthesised by PEGylation of poly-l-lysine-cholic acid (PLL-CA). The benzoic imine linker between PEG and PLL-CA was designed to be stable at physiological pH but cleavable at lower pHs, consistent with the extracellular environment of tumours and the interior of endosomes/lysosomes. The selective hydrolysis of the PEG linker at these targeted sites should provide enhanced cellular uptake and endosomal escape while simultaneously ensuring prolonged blood circulation times. In this study, physicochemical profiling demonstrated nano-complex formation between the PLL derivatives and siRNA (200-280 nm in diameter). At physiological pH only a slight cationic surface charge (<20 mV) was detected, due to the masking effect of the PEG. In contrast, significantly higher positive charges (∼20 to 30 mV and >40 mV) were detected upon hydrolysis of the PEG linker at acidic pHs (pH=6.8 and 5.5, respectively). The PEGylated complexes were stable in serum without significant aggregation or decomplexation of siRNA for up to 48 h. At the cellular level, PEG-PLLs were comparable with the commercial carrier INTERFRin, in terms of cellular uptake, endosomal escape and in vitro reporter gene knockdown. In vivo, utilising a mouse model grafted with prostate carcinoma, significant tumour suppression was achieved using PEGylated complexes without marked toxicity or undesirable immunological response, this was accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in target mRNA levels. In summary, the advantages of these vectors include: the in vitro and in vivo silencing efficiency, and the low toxicity and immunogenicity.""","""['Jianfeng Guo', 'Woei Ping Cheng', 'Jingxia Gu', 'Caixia Ding', 'Xiaozhong Qu', 'Zhenzhong Yang', ""Caitriona O'Driscoll""]""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur J Pharm Sci""","""['A peptide-targeted delivery system with pH-sensitive amphiphilic cell membrane disruption for efficient receptor-mediated siRNA delivery.', 'Efficient delivery of Bcl-2-targeted siRNA using cationic polymer nanoparticles: downregulating mRNA expression level and sensitizing cancer cells to anticancer drug.', 'Self-assembly cationic nanoparticles based on cholesterol-grafted bioreducible poly(amidoamine) for siRNA delivery.', 'Recent progress in copolymer-mediated siRNA delivery.', 'Physicochemical characterization techniques for lipid based delivery systems for siRNA.', 'Advanced nanomaterial for prostate cancer theranostics.', 'The Progress and Promise of RNA Medicine─An Arsenal of Targeted Treatments.', 'Targeted drug delivery strategies for precision medicines.', 'Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-Based Therapeutics for Cartilage Diseases.', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides Delivering siRNAs: An Overview.']"""

In particular, the incidence of melancholic symptoms of depression, which are signs of increased risk of suicide and resistance to treatment, has not previously been reported in PCa patients. The present study aimed to measure the incidence and nature of Melancholia in PCa depression.  Method:   A sample of 507 PCa patients in Queensland, Australia, completed anonymous and confidential questionnaires about their background, treatment status, and depression. Data were analysed to select depressive symptoms that were part of the definition of Melancholia vs those which were not. Regression was used to determine the links between Melancholia and overall depressive status, and factor analysis revealed the underlying components of Melancholia, which were mapped over time since diagnosis for 3 years.  Results:   Psychometric data were satisfactory. Melancholia significantly predicted depressive status for the most depressed subset of patients, but not for the total sample. Melancholia was factored into its components of Anhedonia and Agitation, and the first of these was more powerful in predicting Melancholia. Variability over the 3 years following diagnosis was noted for each of these two components of Melancholia.  Conclusions:   The strong presence of Melancholia in the depressive symptomatology of this sample of PCa patients suggests that some forms of treatment for depression may be more likely to succeed than others.

Results indicated that toxicity toward human cancer cells depended on the metal ion as well as corrole functional group substitution. Ga(III)-substituted metallocorrole 1-Ga inhibited proliferation of breast (MDA-MB-231), melanoma (SK-MEL-28), and ovarian (OVCAR-3) cancer cells primarily by arrest of DNA replication, whereas 2-Mn displayed both cytostatic and cytotoxic properties.

Zfx is a shared transcriptional regulator of both embryonic stem cells (ESC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which suggests a common genetic basis of self-renewal in embryonic and adult stem cells. The level of Zfx expression correlates with aggressiveness and severity in many cancer types, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia. However, the importance of Zfx in human glioma is largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the role of Zfx in human glioma.  Methods:   We detected expression levels of Zfx mRNA in U251 cells, U87 cells, U373 cells, and A172 cells by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. To analyze the expression of Zfx mRNA in glioma tissues, we performed real-time quantitative PCR on 35 pathologically confirmed glioma samples (Grade I-4cases, Grade II-13cases, Grade III-11cases, and Grade IV-7cases) and on 5 noncancerous brain tissue samples. We used lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knock down Zfx expression in the human malignant glioma cell line U251. Changes in Zfx target gene expression were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Cell proliferation was examined by a High Content Screening assay. DNA synthesis in proliferating cells was determined by BrdU incorporation. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were detected by flowcytometric analysis.  Results:   We discovered that Zfx mRNA was expressed in U251 cells, U87 cells, U373 cells, and A172 cells. The expression level of Zfx is significantly higher in gliomas compared to noncancerous brain tissue. Using a lentivirus-based RNAi approach, Zfx expression was significantly inhibited in human glioblastoma U251 cells. The effects of Zfx knockdown on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis were assessed. Inhibition of Zfx expression in U251 cells by RNAi significantly impaired cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and arrested cells in S phase.

Design:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1988-2007), we compared a cohort of patients diagnosed as having CM as a first cancer with a cohort of patients diagnosed as having CM following a previous cancer.  Participants:   We included 70,819 patients with CM as a first primary cancer and 6353 patients with CM following a previous cancer.  Main outcome measures:   We calculated the relative risk (RR) for development of primary CM following a previous cancer and used Cox modeling to examine survival characteristics of the 2 cohorts.  Results:   Patients younger than 45 years at first cancer diagnosis had significantly higher risk of CM following cutaneous melanoma (RR, 11.89; 95% CI, 10.83-13.03), other nonepithelial skin cancer (RR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.13-5.79), Kaposi sarcoma (RR, 3.26; 95% CI 1.41-6.42), female breast cancer (RR, 1.38; (1.11-1.70), and lymphoma (RR, 1.79; (95% CI, 1.30-2.41). Patients 45 years or older at first cancer diagnosis had significantly higher risk of CM following cutaneous melanoma (RR, 8.36; 95% CI, 7.93-8.81), other nonepithelial skin cancer (RR, 2.00; 95% CI 1.35-2.86), ocular melanoma (RR, 5.34; 95% CI 3.42-7.94), female breast cancer (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21), prostate cancer (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13), thyroid cancer (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.06-1.82), lymphoma (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16-1.55), and leukemia (RR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.49-2.13). Characteristics associated with better survival in both cohorts included female sex, age younger than 45 years at melanoma diagnosis, being married, being white vs black, decreasing Breslow depth, lack of tumor ulceration, no nodal involvement, and absence of metastases.  Conclusion:   Given that cutaneous melanoma is the most common second primary cancer in patients with a first CM (a risk that remains elevated for over 15 years), our results suggest the need for continued skin surveillance in melanoma survivors.""","""['Geoffrey B Yang', 'Jill S Barnholtz-Sloan', 'Yanwen Chen', 'Jeremy S Bordeaux']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Arch Dermatol""","""['A population-based analysis of risk factors for a second primary cutaneous melanoma among melanoma survivors.', 'Risk of second primary malignancies following cutaneous melanoma diagnosis: a population-based study.', 'Second lymphomas and other malignant neoplasms in patients with mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome: evidence from population-based and clinical cohorts.', 'The risk of developing a second primary cancer in melanoma patients: a comprehensive review of the literature and meta-analysis.', 'Cutaneous malignant melanomas with other coexisting neoplasms: a true association?', 'Synchronous and metachronous multiple primary cancers in melanoma survivors: a gender perspective.', 'Simultaneous upper limb melanoma and breast cancer related lymphedema management.', 'Skin Cancer in People of Color: A Systematic Review.', 'Racial Differences in the Prognosis and Survival of Cutaneous Melanoma From 1990 to 2020 in North America: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Fenchel duality of Cox partial likelihood with an application in survival kernel learning.']"""

This study aimed to evaluate androgen signaling in bone marrow-infiltrating cancer and testosterone in blood and bone marrow and to correlate with clinical observations.  Patients and methods:   This was an open-label, observational study of 57 patients with bone-metastatic CRPC who underwent transiliac bone marrow biopsy between October 2007 and March 2010. Patients received oral abiraterone acetate (1 g) once daily and prednisone (5 mg) twice daily. Androgen receptor (AR) and CYP17 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry, testosterone concentration by mass spectrometry, AR copy number by polymerase chain reaction, and TMPRSS2-ERG status by fluorescent in situ hybridization in available tissues.  Results:   Median overall survival was 555 days (95% CI, 440 to 965+ days). Maximal prostate-specific antigen decline ≥ 50% occurred in 28 (50%) of 56 patients. Homogeneous, intense nuclear expression of AR, combined with ≥ 10% CYP17 tumor expression, was correlated with longer time to treatment discontinuation (> 4 months) in 25 patients with tumor-infiltrated bone marrow samples. Pretreatment CYP17 tumor expression ≥ 10% was correlated with increased bone marrow aspirate testosterone. Blood and bone marrow aspirate testosterone concentrations declined to less than picograms-per-milliliter levels and remained suppressed at progression.  Conclusion:   The observed pretreatment androgen-signaling signature is consistent with persistent androgen signaling in CRPC bone metastases. This is the first evidence that abiraterone acetate achieves sustained suppression of testosterone in both blood and bone marrow aspirate to less than picograms-per-milliliter levels.

Methods:   9 men and 22 women aged 64 to 97 (mean, 81; standard deviation, 8) years who had been taking clopidogrel for ischaemic heart disease (n=15), cerebrovascular disease (n=6), or both (n=10) presented with proximal femoral fractures. The time from injury to operation, type of anaesthesia, treatment method, and postoperative complications were reviewed. One-year mortality was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier curve. Factors predicting one-year mortality were identified.  Results:   The fracture configurations of the 31 patients included intracapsular femoral neck fracture (n=17), intertrochanteric fracture (n=13), and subtrochanteric fracture (n=1). 30 of the patients underwent hemiarthroplasty (n=16), dynamic hip screw fixation (n=9) or intramedullary hip screw fixation (n=5). The remaining patient underwent conservative treatment owing to metastatic prostate cancer. Of the 30 patients who underwent surgery, clopidogrel was discontinued at least 7 days prior to surgery, with the mean delay to surgery being 8.4 (range, 2-16) days. No patient had excessive blood loss at operation, although 7 patients received a blood transfusion postoperatively. 13 (43%) patients developed postoperative complications. The one-year mortality was 26% (8/31). Univariate analysis showed that factors predicting one-year mortality were spinal anaesthesia (p=0.04), postoperative blood transfusion (p=0.03), postoperative complications (p=0.03), and delay to surgery (p=0.03). Multiple regression analysis showed that delay to surgery (p=0.03) was the only independent predictor of one-year mortality, with a hazard ratio of 1.357 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.79).  Conclusion:   Surgery should be performed as soon as possible in medically fit patients having proximal femoral fractures who are taking clopidogrel, as delay to surgery is associated with increased one-year mortality.""","""['Rohit Maheshwari', 'Mehool Acharya', 'Maureen Monda', 'Radhakant Pandey']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Orthop Surg (Hong Kong)""","""['Mortality in patients with proximal femoral fractures during the first year after the injury.', 'Early surgery is feasible in patients with hip fractures who are on clopidogrel therapy.', 'Predictors of mortality in elderly patients with an intertrochanteric or a femoral neck fracture.', 'Trochanteric femoral fractures.', 'Fractures of the femoral neck: a review and personal statement.', 'Influencing factors on morbidity and mortality in intertrochanteric fractures.', 'The Perioperative Management of Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Drugs in Hip Fractures: Do the Surgery as Early as Possible.', 'Is hip fracture surgery safe for patients on antiplatelet drugs and is it necessary to delay surgery?

Here, we show for the first time, that Par-4 is a novel substrate of caspase-3 during apoptosis. We found that Par-4 is cleaved during cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human normal and cancer cell lines. Par-4 cleavage generates a C-terminal fragment of ~25 kDa, and the cleavage of Par-4 is completely inhibited by a caspase-3 inhibitor, suggesting that caspase-3 is directly involved in the cleavage of Par-4. Caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells do not show Par-4 cleavage in response to cisplatin treatment, and restoration of caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells produces a decrease in Par-4 levels, with the appearance of a cleaved fragment. Additionally, knockdown of Par-4 reduces caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induction. Site-directed mutagenesis reveals that Par-4 cleavage by caspase-3 occurs at an unconventional site, EEPD(131)↓G. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type Par-4 but not the Par-4 D131A mutant sensitizes cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Upon caspase-3 cleavage, the cleaved fragment of Par-4 accumulates in the nucleus and displays increased apoptotic activity. Overexpression of the cleaved fragment of Par-4 inhibits IκBα phosphorylation and blocks NF-κB nuclear translocation. We have identified a novel specific caspase-3 cleavage site in Par-4, and the cleaved fragment of Par-4 retains proapoptotic activity.""","""['Parvesh Chaudhry', 'Mohan Singh', 'Sophie Parent', 'Eric Asselin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['Caspase-8-mediated PAR-4 cleavage is required for TNFα-induced apoptosis.', 'Caspase-3 mediated cleavage of HsRad51 at an unconventional site.', 'Anamorsin, a novel caspase-3 substrate in neurodegeneration.', 'Proteolytic cleavage of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase by caspase-3 during DNA damage-induced apoptosis.', 'Proteolytic activation of PKN by caspase-3 or related protease during apoptosis.', 'Enhancing the Conformational Stability of the cl-Par-4 Tumor Suppressor via Site-Directed Mutagenesis.', ""The roles of ERIANIN in tumor and innate immunity and its' perspectives in immunotherapy."", 'Long non-coding RNA signatures and related signaling pathway in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.', 'Inhibition of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2α Induces Apoptosis in Multiple Myeloma Cells.', 'Structural Analysis of the cl-Par-4 Tumor Suppressor as a Function of Ionic Environment.']"""

In addition, the physiological role of sVEGFR-2 with regard to the VEGF-stimulated proliferation of HPEC was investigated.  Methods:   HPECs were isolated and cultured from fresh BPH tissue. After the incubation of HPECs either with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 or IL-12, the secretion of sVEGFR-2 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For measurement of HPEC proliferation influenced by sVEGFR-2, VEGF-stimulated HPEC was cultured with/without sVEGFR-2. Cell proliferation was assessed with the Alamar Blue method.  Results:   The sVEGFR-2 secretion was increased by ATP and decreased by IL-12 and IL-8, respectively. IL-6 did not show any significant effect on sVEGFR-2 secretion of HPECs. HPEC proliferation was significantly inhibited by sVEGFR-2.

To the best of our knowledge relatively few attempts have been made to quantitatively fuse such data to construct classifiers and none have attempted to quantitatively combine histology (imaging) and proteomic (non-imaging) measurements for making diagnostic and prognostic predictions. The objective of this work is to create a common subspace to simultaneously accommodate both the imaging and non-imaging data (and hence data corresponding to different scales and dimensionalities), called a metaspace. This metaspace can be used to build a meta-classifier that produces better classification results than a classifier that is based on a single modality alone. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Regularized CCA (RCCA) are statistical techniques that extract correlations between two modes of data to construct a homogeneous, uniform representation of heterogeneous data channels. In this paper, we present a novel modification to CCA and RCCA, Supervised Regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis (SRCCA), that (1) enables the quantitative integration of data from multiple modalities using a feature selection scheme, (2) is regularized, and (3) is computationally cheap. We leverage this SRCCA framework towards the fusion of proteomic and histologic image signatures for identifying prostate cancer patients at the risk of 5 year biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy.  Results:   A cohort of 19 grade, stage matched prostate cancer patients, all of whom had radical prostatectomy, including 10 of whom had biochemical recurrence within 5 years of surgery and 9 of whom did not, were considered in this study. The aim was to construct a lower fused dimensional metaspace comprising both the histological and proteomic measurements obtained from the site of the dominant nodule on the surgical specimen. In conjunction with SRCCA, a random forest classifier was able to identify prostate cancer patients, who developed biochemical recurrence within 5 years, with a maximum classification accuracy of 93%.  Conclusions:   The classifier performance in the SRCCA space was found to be statistically significantly higher compared to the fused data representations obtained, not only from CCA and RCCA, but also two other statistical techniques called Principal Component Analysis and Partial Least Squares Regression. These results suggest that SRCCA is a computationally efficient and a highly accurate scheme for representing multimodal (histologic and proteomic) data in a metaspace and that it could be used to construct fused biomarkers for predicting disease recurrence and prognosis.""","""['Abhishek Golugula', 'George Lee', 'Stephen R Master', 'Michael D Feldman', 'John E Tomaszewski', 'David W Speicher', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Supervised regularized canonical correlation analysis: integrating histologic and proteomic data for predicting biochemical failures.', 'Supervised multi-view canonical correlation analysis (sMVCCA): integrating histologic and proteomic features for predicting recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Combined value of validated clinical and genomic risk stratification tools for predicting prostate cancer mortality in a high-risk prostatectomy cohort.', 'Predicting biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: the role of prognostic grade group and index tumor nodule.', 'Tissue-Based MicroRNAs as Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: What Can We Learn from Past Studies?', 'Advances in the computational and molecular understanding of the prostate cancer cell nucleus.', ""Cascaded Multi-view Canonical Correlation (CaMCCo) for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease via Fusion of Clinical, Imaging and Omic Features."", 'Dimensionality reduction-based fusion approaches for imaging and non-imaging biomedical data: concepts, workflow, and use-cases.', 'Evaluating stability of histomorphometric features across scanner and staining variations: prostate cancer diagnosis from whole slide images.', 'Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction with Semi-Supervision (AdDReSS): Classifying Multi-Attribute Biomedical Data.']"""

While some have noted reduced rates of certain preventive services among smokers relative to nonsmokers, others have reported no differences based on smoking status. These inconsistencies may be due, at least in part, to the way in which smoking status was measured. The present investigation examined variability in utilization of six common preventive services including immunization (influenza and pneumococcal) and cancer screening (breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate) using more specific categories of smoking history and status.  Methods:   Data from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to estimate rates of preventive services among U.S. adults. Use of vaccination and cancer screening services across four categories of smoking status (never-smoker, daily smoker, non-daily smoker, and former smoker) were examined using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for sociodemographics and health care access.  Results:   Relative to never-smokers, daily smokers had significantly reduced rates of all services with the exception of pneumococcal vaccination. Although non-daily smokers were similar to never-smokers on most outcomes, they demonstrated lower rates of mammography but were more likely to have received a recent Papanicolaou test.

The purpose of this study is to elucidate the health care costs of an active surveillance paradigm for prostate cancer.  Methods:   A theoretical cohort of 120,000 men selecting active surveillance for prostate cancer was created. The number of men remaining on active surveillance and those exiting to each of 5 treatments over 5 years were simulated in a Markov model. Estimated total costs after 5 years of active surveillance with subsequent delayed treatment were compared with immediate treatment. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the effect of various surveillance strategies and attrition rates. Additional analyses to include 10 years of follow-up were performed.  Results:   The average simulated cost of treatment for 120,000 men initiating active surveillance with 5 years of follow-up and subsequent delayed treatment resulted in per patient cost savings of $16,042 (95% confidence interval [CI], $16,039-$16,046) relative to initial curative treatment. This represents a $1.9 billion dollar savings to the cohort. The strict costs of active surveillance exceeded those of brachytherapy in the ninth year of follow-up. A yearly biopsy within the active surveillance cohort increased costs by 22%, compared with every other year biopsy. At 10 years of follow-up, active surveillance still resulted in a cost benefit; however, the savings were reduced by 38% to $9944 (95% CI, $9941-$9948) per patient relative to initial treatment.  Conclusions:   These data demonstrate that active surveillance represents a considerable cost savings over immediate treatment for prostate cancer in a theoretical cohort after 5 and 10 years of follow-up.""","""['Kirk A Keegan', ""Marc A Dall'Era"", 'Blythe Durbin-Johnson', 'Christopher P Evans']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Re: Active surveillance for prostate cancer compared with immediate treatment: an economic analysis.', 'Words of wisdom.

Peripheral androgen blockade using a combination of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor and an antiandrogen may allow control of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Because testosterone levels are not suppressed, this approach may be associated with less morbidity than conventional gonadal androgen suppression.  Methods:   All patients had undergone previous definitive local therapy and had evidence of a rising PSA >1ng/mL, with no evidence of recurrent disease. Patients received both finasteride, 5 mg orally per day, and flutamide, 250 mg orally 3× a day. Patients were followed for a PSA response and quality of life assessment.  Results:   Ninety-nine of 101 accrued patients were eligible. A ≥80% PSA decline was seen in 96 (96%) patients. The median time to PSA progression was 85 months. With a median follow-up of 10 years, the median survival time had not been reached, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 87%. Toxicity was mild, with 18 patients stopping for toxicity; 15 had diarrhea, 4 had gynecomastia, and 3 had transaminase elevation. Baseline Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate Module and Treatment Outcome Index scores decreased by 5 points each at 6 months after enrollment.  Conclusions:   The use of the finasteride/flutamide combination is feasible, and results in PSA declines of ≥80% in 96% of patients with serologic progression after definitive local therapy. There were no unexpected toxicities, and the change in quality of life was mild.

Objective:   We sought to identify medical center characteristics associated with screening in this population.  Design/participants:   We conducted a prospective study of 622,262 screen-eligible men aged 70+ seen at 104 VA medical centers in 2003.  Main measures:   Primary outcome was the percentage of men at each center who received PSA screening in 2003, based on VA data and Medicare claims. Men were stratified into life expectancy groups ranging from favorable (age 70-79 with Charlson score = 0) to limited (age 85+ with Charlson score ≥1 or age 70+ with Charlson score ≥4). Medical center characteristics were obtained from the 1999-2000 VA Survey of Primary Care Practices and publicly available VA data sources.  Key results:   Among 123,223 (20%) men with limited life expectancy, 45% received PSA screening in 2003. Across 104 VAs, the PSA screening rate among men with limited life expectancy ranged from 25-79% (median 43%). Higher screening was associated with the following center characteristics: no academic affiliation (50% vs. 43%, adjusted RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.25), a ratio of midlevel providers to physicians ≥3:4 (55% vs. 45%, adjusted RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.32) and location in the South (49% vs. 39% in the West, adjusted RR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.12-1.40). Use of incentives and high scores on performance measures were not independently associated with screening. Within centers, the percentages of men screened with limited and favorable life expectancies were highly correlated (r = 0.90).  Conclusions:   Substantial practice variation exists for PSA screening in older men with limited life expectancy across VAs. The high center-specific correlation of screening among men with limited and favorable life expectancies indicates that PSA screening is poorly targeted according to life expectancy.""","""['Cynthia So', 'Katharine A Kirby', 'Kala Mehta', 'Richard M Hoffman', 'Adam A Powell', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Brenda Sirovich', 'Elizabeth M Yano', 'Louise C Walter']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Gen Intern Med""","""['Clinician Factors Associated With Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening in Older Veterans With Limited Life Expectancy.', 'PSA screening among elderly men with limited life expectancies.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'The Aging Mountaineer: PSA screening in older men--of value or should we skip this test?', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Variation in Low-Value Service Use Across Veterans Affairs Facilities.', 'Use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in the United States for men age ≥65, 1999-2015: Implications for practice interventions.', 'Comparison by Race of Conservative Management for Low-Risk and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancers in Veterans From 2004 to 2018.', 'Evaluation of Low-Value Diagnostic Testing for 4 Common Conditions in the Veterans Health Administration.', 'Unrelated Death After Colorectal Cancer Screening: Implications for Improving Colonoscopy Referrals.']"""

Yet little is known about how health literacy affects cancer populations. The authors examined the relation between health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health literacy among men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data analysis included 1581 men with newly diagnosed clinically localized prostate cancer from a population-based study, the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP). Participants completed assessment of health literacy using Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and HRQOL using the Short Form-12 General Health Survey (SF12). Bivariate and multivariate regression was used to determine the potential association between REALM and HRQOL, while controlling for sociodemographic and illness-related variables.  Results:   Higher health literacy level was significantly associated with better mental well-being (SF12-Mental Component Summary [MCS]; P < .001) and physical well-being (SF12-Physical Component Summary [PCS]; P < .001) in bivariate analyses. After controlling for sociodemographic (age, marital status, race, income, and education) and illness-related factors (types of cancer treatment, tumor aggressiveness, and comorbidities), health literacy remained significantly associated with SF12-MCS scores (P < .05) but not with SF12-PCS scores.  Conclusions:   Among patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer, those with low health literacy levels were more vulnerable to mental distress than those with higher health literacy levels, but physical well-being was no different. These findings suggest that health literacy may be important in patients managing prostate cancer and the effects of treatment, and provide the hypothesis that supportive interventions targeting patients with lower health literacy may improve their HRQOL.""","""['Lixin Song', 'Merle Mishel', 'Jeannette T Bensen', 'Ronald C Chen', 'George J Knafl', 'Bonny Blackard', 'Laura Farnan', 'Elizabeth Fontham', 'L Joseph Su', 'Christine S Brennan', 'James L Mohler', 'Paul A Godley']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Insurance and quality of life in men with prostate cancer: data from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urological Research Endeavor.', 'The impact of health literacy and life style risk factors on health-related quality of life of Australian patients.', 'Health literacy and the health status of men with prostate cancer.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'How does active surveillance for prostate cancer affect quality of life?

This repression is mediated by androgen-responsive elements (ARE) and dictated by Polycomb group protein EZH2 and repressive chromatin remodeling. In embryonic stem cells, AR-repressed genes are occupied by EZH2 and harbor bivalent H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications that are characteristic of differentiation regulators, the silencing of which maintains the undifferentiated state.

However, the androgen receptor (AR) pathway remains active and key for cell growth and gene expression within tumours, even in the apparent absence of hormone. Proposed mechanisms to explain progression, including AR amplification/mutation, are insufficient to completely explain CRPC and possible roles of AR cofactors such as prohibitin (PHB) are poorly understood. We investigated whether PHB loss could sensitise PC cells and tumours to adrenal gland-derived androgens, which persist even after androgen ablation, hence contribute to development of CRPC. Using a pair of PC cell lines, inducibly expressing ectopic cDNA or RNAi for PHB, responses to different androgens and hormone concentrations were studied both in vitro and in vivo. PHB was found at the promoters of several genes, both AR and non-AR-regulated, and knockdown increased histone acetylation at these promoters. Further, PHB knockdown increased the rate of AR ligand-induced chromatin binding, and binding rate and occupancy of AR upon the PSA promoter. This resulted in increased cell growth and AR activity in response to all androgens, including promoting a response to the weaker adrenal androgens previously absent at physiological concentrations. In vivo this had functional consequences such that PHB knockdown resulted in androstenedione being sufficient to promote tumour growth, under conditions mimicking those in patients undergoing androgen ablation therapy. We conclude that reduction in PHB levels is sufficient to lower the threshold of AR activity in vitro and in vivo; this may be via a general increase in histone acetylation that could potentially affect signalling by other transcription factors. PHB loss may provide a mechanism for progression to CRPC by sensitising PC cells to 'castrate' conditions-that is, low levels of testicular androgens in the continued presence of weak adrenal and dietary androgens.""","""['D A Dart', 'G N Brooke', 'A Sita-Lumsden', 'J Waxman', 'C L Bevan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Manipulating prohibitin levels provides evidence for an in vivo role in androgen regulation of prostate tumours.', 'Prohibitin, a protein downregulated by androgens, represses androgen receptor activity.', 'Prohibitin and the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit BRG1 are required for effective androgen antagonist-mediated transcriptional repression of androgen receptor-regulated genes.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Liver Microenvironment Response to Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Hormonal Therapy.', 'CPT1A Supports Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer in Androgen-Deprived Conditions.', 'The novel long noncoding RNA LOC283070 is involved in the transition of LNCaP cells into androgen-independent cells via its interaction with PHB2.', 'The prohibitin-repressive interaction with E2F1 is rapidly inhibited by androgen signalling in prostate cancer cells.']"""

In this study we have established a novel mechanism for initiation of CDCP1-mediated signaling in vivo and demonstrated that specific 135→70-kDa processing of cell-surface CDCP1 by extracellular serine proteases is a prerequisite for CDCP1-dependent survival of cancer cells during metastasis. The in vivo cleavage of CDCP1 triggers a survival program involving recruitment of Src and PKCδ, Src-mediated phosphorylation of cell-surface-retained 70-kDa CDCP1, activation of Akt and suppression of PARP1-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate in vivo that phosphorylated Src, PKCδ and Akt all constitute activated elements of a CDCP1-signaling axis during tissue colonization of tumor cells. Preventing in vivo cleavage of CDCP1 with unique anti-CDCP1 antibodies, serine protease inhibitors or genetic modulation of the cleavage site in the CDCP1 molecule completely abrogated survival signaling associated with the 70-kDa CDCP1, and induced PARP1 cleavage and PARP1-mediated apoptosis, ultimately resulting in substantial inhibition of tissue colonization by tumor cells. The lack of CDCP1 cleavage in the lung tissue of plasminogen-knockout mice along with a coordinated reduction in tumor cell survival in a lung retention model, and importantly rescue of both by in vivo supplied plasmin, indicated that plasmin is the crucial serine protease executing in vivo cleavage of cell-surface CDCP1 during early stages of lung colonization.

However many types of solid cancer cells are resistant to ABT-737. One practical approach to improve its therapeutic efficacy is to combine with the agents that can overcome such resistance to restore the sensitivity. In the present study, a second-generation selenium compound methylseleninic acid (MSeA) synergistically sensitized MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, HT-29 human colon cancer cells and DU145 human prostate cancer cells to apoptosis induction by ABT-737, as evidenced by greater than additive enhancement of Annexin V/FITC positive (apoptotic) cells and activation of multiple caspases and PARP cleavage. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that MSeA significantly decreased basal Mcl-1 expression and ABT-737-induced Mcl-1 expression. Knocking down of Mcl-1 with RNAi approach supported the functional significance of this molecular target. More importantly, we identified inactivation of Bad by phosphorylation on ser-136 and ser-112 as a novel mechanism involved in ABT-737 resistance, which can be overcome by combining with MSeA. In addition, we found that expression of Bax was required for the efficient execution of synergistic sensitization.

Although the role of Hsp27 in protection from stress-induced intrinsic cell death has been relatively well studied, its role in Fas (death domain containing member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily)-induced apoptosis and cell proliferation remains underappreciated. Here, we show that Hsp27 silencing induces dual coordinated effects, resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation and sensitization of cells to Fas-induced apoptosis through regulation of PEA-15 (15-kDa phospho-enriched protein in astrocytes). We demonstrate that Hsp27 silencing suppresses proliferation by causing PEA-15 to bind and sequester extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), resulting in reduced translocation of ERK to the nucleus. Concurrently, Hsp27 silencing promotes Fas-induced apoptosis by inducing PEA-15 to release Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain (FADD), thus allowing FADD to participate in death receptor signaling. Conversely, Hsp27 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and suppresses Fas-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that Hsp27 regulation of PEA-15 activity occurs in an Akt-dependent manner. Significantly, Hsp27 silencing in a panel of phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) wild-type or null cell lines, and in LNCaP cells that inducibly express PTEN, resulted in selective growth inhibition of PTEN-deficient cancer cells. These data identify a dual coordinated role of Hsp27 in cell proliferation and Fas-induced apoptosis via Akt and PEA-15, and indicate that improved clinical responses to Hsp27-targeted therapy may be achieved by stratifying patient populations based on tumor PTEN expression.""","""['N Hayashi', 'J W Peacock', 'E Beraldi', 'A Zoubeidi', 'M E Gleave', 'C J Ong']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cell Death Differ""","""['Phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 antagonizes TNF-α induced HeLa cell apoptosis via regulating TAK1 ubiquitination and activation of p38 and ERK signaling.', 'Human astrocytes are resistant to Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis.', 'PTEN suppresses SPARC-induced pMAPKAPK2 and inhibits SPARC-induced Ser78 HSP27 phosphorylation in glioma.', 'Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes (PEA)-15: a potential therapeutic target in multiple disease states.', 'The Role of Hsp27 in Chemotherapy Resistance.', 'Heat Shock Proteins: Central Players in Oncological and Immuno-Oncological Tracks.', 'Adverse Effects of High Temperature On Mammary Alveolar Development In Vitro.', 'Host cell proteins modulated upon Toxoplasma infection identified using proteomic approaches: a molecular rationale.', 'The Multiple Roles and Therapeutic Potential of Molecular Chaperones in Prostate Cancer.', 'Heat shock protein 27 promotes cell cycle progression by down-regulating E2F transcription factor 4 and retinoblastoma family protein p130.']"""

In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of NKX3.1 on insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1R expression and its downstream signalling pathway in PC3 cells. PC3 cells were stably transfected with NKX3.1 expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1-NKX3.1) or vector plasmid (pcDNA3.1+). The IGF-IR mRNA and protein expression levels were assessed in PC3-NKX3.1 transfectants by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. The expression and activation of IGF-1/IGF-1R downstream signalling targets were examined by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay. The cells were subsequently treated with relevant concentrations of IGF-1. The effect of IGF-1 on cell growth was examined by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5-diphenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry analysis. A significant suppression of IGF-1R mRNA and protein expression was observed after forced expression of NKX3.1 in PC3 cells. Correspondingly, the forced expression of NKX3.1 decreased IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) and activation of the Elk-1 transcription factor and downregulated the expression of the downstream target genes c-fos and cyclin D1. Furthermore, the forced expression of NKX3.1 inhibited IGF-1-induced cell growth. In conclusion, NKX3.1 could downregulate IGF-1R expression and could inhibit IGF-1R-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK and AKT signalling pathways, which might partially leads to the inhibition of IGF-1-induced cell growth.

Methods:   We evaluated all patients initially receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for primary advanced PC with bone metastasis. A total of 982 patients with complete medical records available for analysis from 18 centers were included in this study. Age, initial PSA, Gleason score (GS) and extent of bone involvement (EBI) were recorded in a database.  Results:   Among all the patients, 896 (91.2%) responded to ADT initially. Pretreatment PSA and EBI were significant predictors in the multivariate model. Among the 659 patients who progressed into a CR state, the mean duration of response was 22.4 months. There was a significant correlation between the CR state and nadir PSA (nPSA) level and time to nPSA. Pretreatment PSA, EBI, GS, highest tumor volume in biopsy cores (%), number of positive biopsy cores, percent positive biopsy cores and time to nPSA were proven to be significant to predict a nPSA. Pretreatment PSA, GS and EBI were statistically significant predictors of PSA normalization in multivariate analysis. The limitation of the study depends on the retrospective design and a model was developed for low standardization as a result of using multicenter data. The patients enrolled in this study were from a relatively long period of time (1989-2008).

Material and methods:   Between 2001 and 2008, serum lipoproteins (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides) were determined in 636 patients. Of these, 129 were treated with maximum androgen blockade and 177 patients were only treated with LHRH analogue. The control group was formed by 339 subjected to prostate biopsy (212 with prostate cancer and 127 without prostate cancer). The atherogenic risk was calculated using the Castelli formula (total cholesterol/HDL).  Results:   Mean atherogenic risk was 4.2 in the control group and 4 in the group of patients subjected to androgenic deprivation, p>0.05. The mean atherogenic risk in those subjected to monotherapy with LHRH analogues was 4.1 while it was 3.9 in patients subjected to maximal androgen blockade, p=0.02. We did not found significant differences for atherogenic risk according to length of treatment, p>0.05.

Several recent studies have indicated that ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid, and its derivatives inhibit the growth of cancer cells by cell cycle arrest and the stimulation of apoptosis. In the present study, we report a novel autophagic response of UA in PTEN-deficient PC3 prostate cancer cells. As one of the major types of programmed cell death, autophagy has been observed in response to several anticancer drugs and demonstrated to be responsible for cell death. UA-induced autophagy in PC3 cells is associated with the reduced cell viability and the enhanced expression of LC3-II, an autophagosome marker in mammals, and monodansylcadaverine incorporation into autolysosomes. Furthermore, we found that UA exhibited anti-proliferative effects characterized by G1 phase arrest and autophagy at an early stage that precedes apoptosis. We also show that UA-induced autophagy in PC3 cells are mediated through the Beclin-1 and Akt/mTOR pathways. Inhibition of autophagy by either 3-methyladenine or Beclin-1/Atg5 small interfering RNA enhanced UA-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that autophagy functions as a survival mechanism in PC3 cells against UA-induced apoptosis and a rational for the use of autophagy inhibitors in combination with UA as a novel modality of cancer therapy.""","""['Seoung Woo Shin', 'Sung Youl Kim', 'Jeen-Woo Park']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Ursolic Acid Induces Apoptosis of Prostate Cancer Cells via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway.', 'Ursolic acid promotes cancer cell death by inducing Atg5-dependent autophagy.', 'CCL2 protects prostate cancer PC3 cells from autophagic death via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT-dependent survivin up-regulation.', ""Research progress of ursolic acid's anti-tumor actions."", 'Novel Insights into Autophagy and Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Multidirectional Effects of Terpenoids from Sorbus intermedia (EHRH.)

Present studies show that Akt plays a critical role in the response of prostate cancer cells to CDDO-Me. Silencing of Akt sensitized PC-3 cells to CDDO-Me, whereas its overexpression rendered them resistant to CDDO-Me. Evaluation of the effect of CDDO-Me on Akt which lies upstream of NF-κB and mTOR showed that CDDO-Me directly inhibits the Akt kinase activity in cell-free kinase activity assay and in vivo without modulating the activity of PDK1, the upstream kinase that phosphorylates and activates Akt. The inhibition of Akt activity resulted in inhibition of phosphorylation/inactivation of proapoptotic procaspase-9, Bad and Foxo3a. Further, inhibition of p-Akt by CDDO-Me was not attributable to an increase in the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or PH domain/leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase1 (PHLPP1) both of which dephosphorylate p-Akt.

Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to test the association between predictors and urinary continence recovery after surgery.  Results:   At a mean postoperative followup of 30.7 months (median 29, range 1 to 80) 611 patients (81.3%) had recovered urinary continence. Overall the urinary continence recovery rate at 1 and 3 years was 73.9% and 82.2%, respectively. On univariate Cox regression analysis patient age and the preoperative score on the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function were significantly associated with urinary continence recovery (each p ≤ 0.04).

Results:   The study population included 1,295 patients during 2000 to 2010, of whom 582 (44.9%) had prostate cancer and 398 (30.7%) had high grade cancer.

Purpose:   To aid providers when discussing aggressiveness of biopsy by cataloging available community biopsy patterns and determine whether lower PSA thresholds are being used to recommend biopsy.  Methods:   Laboratory and biopsy records were reviewed among 59,764 men in a large Washington State health plan between 1998 and 2007.

Results:   Twenty-eight percent of tests with PSA levels ≥4.0 ng/mL, 2.9% of tests with levels between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/mL, and 0.4% of tests with levels <2.5 ng/mL were followed with a biopsy within 12 months.

Background:   Prostate cancer is a significant growing disease among men in Taiwan. Quality of life issues for the men who are living with this disease and the consequences of treatment.  Design:   A postal questionnaire survey.  Methods:   The study population came from one 1170-bed hospital in Kaohsiung County, Taiwan. Data was collected from 20 August 2007-20 November 2009. Seventy-eight men met the inclusion criteria. The researchers mailed a survey to each participant, which they completed at home and returned in a pre-stamped, addressed envelope. Sixty-four subjects participated and self-reported using a structured questionnaire. The reliability of overall prostate cancer index was 0.90 and 0.85, 0.93 and 0.72 for each subscale, respectively.  Results:   The results indicate that the number of months post-treatment was positively correlated with urinary function and age was negatively correlated with sexual, bowel function and bowel bothers. One predictor (month post-treatment) was related to urinary function; one predictor (treatment method) was related to bowel function and four predictors (marital status, age, treatment method and month post-treatment) were related to sexual function. Findings showed that patients who received brachytherapy have better urinary functions, as compared with prostatectomy patients.  Conclusion:   Study findings suggest that healthcare providers should have a better understanding of patients' complications after treatment and this can ultimately raise the quality of life for prostate cancer patients.  Relevance to clinical practice:   The impact of quality of life among post prostate cancer treatment is common. Urological nurses should therefore take the responsibility regarding the consequence of urinary incontinence and sexual function and seeking appropriate nursing interventions for these complications.""","""['Yu-Hua Lin', 'Victor Chia-Hsiang Lin', 'Tsan-Jung Yu', 'Hua-Pin Wang', 'Kevin Lu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""['Radical prostatectomy versus high-dose rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: effects on health-related quality of life.', 'Quality of life outcomes after brachytherapy for early stage prostate cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life 2 years after treatment with radical prostatectomy, prostate brachytherapy, or external beam radiotherapy in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life after brachytherapy or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Ten-years outcome analysis in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy.']"""

A special conference session sponsored by the SENS Foundation discussed how stem cell therapies are being used to extend healthy life span. Stem cells are useful not only in cell-replacement therapies, but also in disease modeling, drug discovery, and drug toxicity screening. Stem cell therapies are currently being applied to over 50 diseases, including heart, lung, neurodegenerative, and eye disease, cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Dozens of companies are developing therapeutic solutions that are in different stages of clinical use and clinical trials. Some high-profile therapies include Dendreon's Provenge for prostate cancer, Geron's first-ever embryonic stem cell trials for spinal cord injury, Fibrocell's laViv cellular therapy for wrinkles, and well-established commercial skin substitutes (Organogenesis' Apligraf and Advanced BioHealing's Dermagraft). Stem cell policy issues under consideration include medical tourism, standards for large-scale stem cell manufacturing, and lingering ethical debates over the use of embryonic stem cells.

The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) is an essential Wnt co-receptor for Wnt/β-catenin signaling and represents a promising anticancer target. Recently, the antihelminthic drug, niclosamide was found to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling, although the mechanism was not well defined. We found that niclosamide was able to suppress LRP6 expression and phosphorylation, block Wnt3A-induced β-catenin accumulation, and inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of niclosamide on LRP6 expression/phosphorylation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling were conformed in human prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cancer cells. Moreover, we showed that the mechanism by which niclosamide suppressed LRP6 resulted from increased degradation as evident by a shorter half-life. Finally, we demonstrated that niclosamide was able to induce cancer cell apoptosis, and displayed excellent anticancer activity with IC(50) values less than 1 µM for prostate PC-3 and DU145 and breast MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cancer cells. The IC(50) values are comparable to those shown to suppress the activities of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in prostate and breast cancer cells.

While genome-wide gene expression changes correlated well with previously-published studies, we additionally uncovered a subset of 226 novel androgen-regulated genes. Gene expression pathway analysis of this subset revealed gene clusters associated with, and including the tyrosine kinase LYN, as well as components of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, which is commonly dysregulated in cancer. We also identified 1279 putative androgen-regulated alternative events, of which 325 (∼25%) mapped to known alternative splicing events or alternative first/last exons. We selected 30 androgen-dependent alternative events for RT-PCR validation, including mRNAs derived from genes encoding tumour suppressors and cell cycle regulators. Of seven positively-validating events (∼23%), five events involved transcripts derived from alternative promoters of known AR gene targets. In particular, we found a novel androgen-dependent mRNA isoform derived from an alternative internal promoter within the TSC2 tumour suppressor gene, which is predicted to encode a protein lacking an interaction domain required for mTOR inhibition. We confirmed that expression of this alternative TSC2 mRNA isoform was directly regulated by androgens, and chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated recruitment of AR to the alternative promoter region at early timepoints following androgen stimulation, which correlated with expression of alternative transcripts.

In this study, we investigated mechanisms underlying androgen regulation of 5α-reductase isoenzyme expression in human prostate cells. We found that androgen regulates the mRNA level of 5α-reductase isoenzymes in a cell type-specific manner, that such regulation occurs at the transcriptional level, and that AR is necessary for this regulation. In addition, our results suggest that AR is recruited to a negative androgen response element (nARE) on the promoter of SRD5A3 in vivo and directly binds to the nARE in vitro.

There is a strong imperative to discover candidate urinary markers for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of PCa. The rising flood of various omics profiles presents immense opportunities for the identification of prospective biomarkers. Here we present a simple and efficient strategy to derive candidate urine markers for prostate tumor by mining cancer genomic profiles from public databases. Prostate, bladder and kidney are three major tissues from which cellular matters could be released into urine. To identify urinary markers specific for PCa, upregulated entities that might be shed in exosomes of bladder cancer and kidney cancer are first excluded. Through the ontology-based filtering and further assessment, a reduced list of 19 entities encoding urinary proteins was derived as putative PCa markers.

Extracorporeal ultrasound-guided HIFU (USgFU) has been clinically used to treat solid tumors. Preliminary trials in a small sample of a Western population suggested that this modality was safe. Most trials are performed in China thereby providing comprehensive data for understanding the safety profile. The aim of this study was to evaluate adverse events of USgFU therapy.  Methods and findings:   Clinical data were searched in 2 Chinese databases. Adverse events of USgFU were summarized and compared with those of magnetic resonance-guided HIFU (MRgFU; for uterine, bone or breast tumor) and transrectal ultrasound-guided HIFU (for prostate cancer or benign prostate hyperplasia). USgFU treatment was performed using 7 types of device. Side effects were evaluated in 13262 cases. There were fewer adverse events in benign lesions than in malignant lesions (11.81% vs. 21.65%, p<0.0001). Rates of adverse events greatly varied between the disease types (0-280%, p<0.0001) and between the applied HIFU devices in both malignant (10.58-44.38%, p<0.0001) and benign lesions (1.67-17.57%, p<0.0001). Chronological analysis did not demonstrate a decrease in the rate of adverse events. Based upon evaluable adverse events, incidences in USgFU were consistent with those in MRgFU or transrectal HIFU. Some side effects frequently occurred following transrectal HIFU were not reported in USgFU. Several events including intrahepatic metastasis, intraoperative high fever, and occlusions of the superior mesenteric artery should be of particular concern because they have not been previously noted. The types of adverse events suggested that they were ultrasonic lesions.  Conclusion:   The frequency of adverse events depended on the location of the lesion and the type of HIFU device; however, side effects of USgFU were not yet understood. USgFU did not decrease the incidence of adverse events compared with MRgFU.""","""['Tinghe Yu', 'Jun Luo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Efficacy of extracorporeal ultrasound-guided high intensity focused ultrasound: An evaluation based on controlled trials in China.', 'Extracorporeal ultrasound-guided high intensity focused ultrasound: implications from the present clinical trials.', 'Preliminary study on ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation for treatment of broad ligament uterine fibroids.', 'Pilot Study of the Mirabilis System Prototype for Rapid Noninvasive Uterine Myoma Treatment Using an Ultrasound-Guided Volumetric Shell Ablation Technique.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU): Overview of Emerging Applications (Part 2).', 'Benefitial role of electrochemotherapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer - radiological perspective.', 'HIFU is safe, effective, and feasible in pancreatic cancer patients: a monocentric retrospective study among 523 patients.', 'Efficacy, Efficiency, and Safety of Magnetic Resonance-Guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Ablation of Uterine Fibroids: Comparison with Ultrasound-Guided Method.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation around the tubing.', 'In Vitro and In Vivo Investigation of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Hat-Type Ablation Mode.']"""

Methods:   We obtained serum samples from 197 PaC cases and 158 age- and sex-matched cancer-free controls. We screened the differentially expressed serum miRNAs with Illumina sequencing by synthesis technology using pooled serum samples followed by RT-qPCR validation of a large number of samples arranged in multiple stages. We used risk score analysis to evaluate the diagnostic value of the serum miRNA profiling system. To assess the serum miRNA-based biomarker accuracy in predicting PaC, we performed additional double-blind testing in 77 PaC cases and 52 controls and diagnostic classification in 55 cases with clinically suspected PaC.  Results:   After the selection and validation process, 7 miRNAs displayed significantly different expression levels in PaC compared with controls. This 7 miRNA-based biomarker had high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing various stages of PaC from cancer-free controls and also accurately discriminated PaC patients from chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients. Among the 7 miRNAs, miR-21 levels in serum were significantly associated with overall PaC survival. The diagnostic accuracy rate of the 7-miRNA profile was 83.6% in correctly classifying 55 cases with clinically suspected PaC.

We determined whether there is indeed an increased risk for second primary malignancies in GEP-NET patients compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of patients with identical malignancies. The series comprised 243 men and 216 women, diagnosed with a GEP-NET between 2000 and 2009 in a tertiary referral center. The timeline, before-at-after diagnosis, and the type of other malignancies were studied using person-year methodology. Poisson distributions were used for testing statistical significance. All data were cross-checked with the Dutch National Cancer Registry. Out of 459 patients with GEP-NET, 67 (13.7%) had a second primary cancer diagnosis: 25 previous cancers (5.4%), 13 synchronous cancers (2.8%), and 29 metachronous cancers (6.3%). The most common types of second primary cancer were breast cancer (n=10), colorectal cancer (n=8), melanoma (n=6), and prostate cancer (n=5). The number of patients with a cancer history was lower than expected, although not significant (n=25 vs n=34.5). The diagnosis of synchronous cancers, mainly colorectal tumors, was higher than expected (n=13 vs n=6.1, P<0.05). Metachronous tumors occurred as frequent as expected (n=29 vs n=25.2, NS).

However, few studies have examined the genetic mechanics of prostate cancer at the pathway level to search for such pathways. We used gene set enrichment analysis and a meta-analysis of six independent studies after standardized microarray preprocessing, which increased concordance between these gene datasets. Based on gene set enrichment analysis, there were 12 down- and 25 up-regulated mixing pathways in more than two tissue datasets, while there were two down- and two up-regulated mixing pathways in three cell datasets. Based on the meta-analysis, there were 46 and nine common pathways in the tissue and cell datasets, respectively. Three up- and 10 down-regulated crossing pathways were detected with combined gene set enrichment analysis and meta-analysis. We found that genes with small changes are difficult to detect by classic univariate statistics; they can more easily be identified by pathway analysis.

Materials and methods:   A panel of experts divided the work associated with providing radiation oncology treatment into modules (from the preparation of radiotherapy, RT planning and administration to the final examination and follow-up). The time required for completion of each module was measured by independent observers at four centers (Rostock, Bamberg, Düsseldorf, and Offenbach, Germany).  Results:   A total of 1,769 data sets were collected from 63 patients with 10-489 data sets per module. Some modules (informed consent procedure, routine treatments, CT planning) exhibited little deviation between centers, whereas others (especially medical and physical irradiation planning) exhibited a wide range of variation (e.g., 1 h 49 min to 6 h 56 min for physical irradiation planning). The mean work time per patient was 12 h 11 min for technicians, 2 h 59 min for physicists, and 7 h 6 min for physicians.  Conclusion:   The modular system of time measurement proved to be reliable and produced comparable data at the different centers.

This identified 97 genes the expression of which is affected by M-110 in both cell lines. We then focused on the M-110 induced up regulation of the MIG6 gene that encodes a negative regulator of EGFR signaling. Here we show that M-110 and the structurally unrelated PIM kinase inhibitor SGI-1776 up regulate MIG6 in DU-145 and PC3 cells. Knockdown of PIM-1 but not of PIM-2 or PIM-3 also up regulates MIG6 expression, which identifies MIG6 as a PIM-1 regulated gene. In agreement with the role of MIG6 protein as a negative regulator of EGFR signaling we found that M-110 treatment inhibits EGF induced EGFR activation and the activation of the downstream ERK MAPkinase pathway. The biological significance of these findings are demonstrated by the fact that co-treatment of DU-145 or PC3 cells with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gefitinib and M-110 or SGI-1776 has synergistic inhibitory effects on cell proliferation.

Much of our understanding of the pathological basis of prostate cancer comes from our analysis of radical prostatectomy specimens. Prostate cancer diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy is more likely to be posterior and basal in orientation rather than anterior or apical. Quantitative tissue analyses have not been undertaken both with details and in an unselected population, e.g. prostate specimens from autopsy cystoprostatectomy series from bladder cancer. Quantitative tissue analysis of incidentally detected prostate cancer such as largest cancer surface area, volume, site of origin, multifocality and laterality could be of paramount importance when trying to understand the findings of screen-detected programmes and focal therapy. Cancers were found in 30% of prostates. In the 96 prostates, 215 cancer foci were identified (mean 2.24). Prostate cancer was multifocal in 60% and bilateral in 80% of cases. The site of origin was in the peripheral and transition zone (TZ) in 75% and 25%, respectively. Overall, 90% of cancer foci were clinically insignificant with volume of <0.5 mL and no grades 4-5. In all, 75% of the cancer foci were in the peripheral zone, the remainder were within the TZ. One third of cancer foci were anteriorly located beyond the area sampled by posterior biopsies. One fifth of cancer foci were ≤ 6 mm of the apex.  Objective:   • To describe multifocality, volume and location of prostate cancers incidentally found in cystoprostatectomy specimens. Quantitative tissue analysis of prostate cancer in a population free of the evaluation bias associated with prostate-specific antigen level and biopsy is important as some men are likely to be offered tissue-preserving therapeutic strategies in the future.  Patients and methods:   • Cystoprostatectomy specimens for bladder cancer from 345 consecutive patients without clinically manifest prostate cancer were included. • Cancers were found in 104/345 (30%) of prostates. Cases with largest cancer >2 mL (eight patients) were excluded from morphometric study. Quantitative tissue analysis of 3-mm step-sectioned glands included largest cancer surface area, volume, site of origin, multifocality and laterality.  Results:   • In the 96 prostates, 215 cancer foci were identified (mean 2.24). Prostate cancer was multifocal in 58% and bilateral in 79% of cases. • Of the 215 cancers, 90% were <0.5 mL and 79% <0.2 mL. Overall, 88% of cancer foci were clinically insignificant with a volume of <0.5 mL and no grades 4-5. • In all, 75% of the cancer foci were in the peripheral zone, the remainder were within the transition zone. • One third of cancer foci were anteriorly located beyond the area sampled by posterior biopsies. One fifth of cancer foci were ≤ 6 mm of the apex. • Limitations include the fact that cystoprostatectomy cancer foci are at an earlier stage than screened-detected cancers.  Conclusion:   • This detailed morphometric analysis of prostate cancer foci in a population that is free from the selection bias associated with screening can help inform our diagnostic and treatment strategies.""","""['Pierre Nevoux', 'Adil Ouzzane', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Mark Emberton', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Joseph C Presti Jr', 'Arnauld Villers']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Incidence and location of prostate and urothelial carcinoma in prostates from cystoprostatectomies: implications for possible apical sparing surgery.', 'Incidental prostate cancer in Asian men: high prevalence of incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma in Chinese patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy for treatment of bladder cancer and selection of candidates for prostate-sparing cystectomy.', 'Evaluation of the prostate peripheral zone/capsule in patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy: defining risk with prostate capsule sparing cystectomy.', 'Comparison between incidentally and clinically detected prostate cancer: implications for prostate cancer screening programs and focal therapy.', ""'Insignificant' prostate cancer on prostatectomy and cystoprostatectomy: variation on a theme 'low-volume/low-grade' prostate cancer?"", 'Evolving imaging methods of prostate cancer and the emergence of magnetic resonance imaging guided ablation techniques.', 'New sparse implantation technique of I-125 low-dose-rate brachytherapy using concomitant short-term hormonal treatment for low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer: An initial study of therapeutic feasibility.', 'Initial experience of magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasonography fusion transperineal biopsy: Biopsy techniques and results for 75 patients.', 'Refining the risk-stratification of transrectal biopsy-detected prostate cancer by elastic fusion registration transperineal biopsies.', 'Extra-target low-risk prostate cancer: implications for focal high-intensity focused ultrasound of clinically significant prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To compare prostate cryotherapy vs brachytherapy outcomes and costs, as despite the greater popularity of these emerging therapies for localised prostate cancer, outcomes data remains sparse beyond single-centre comparative studies.  Patients and methods:   Observational study of 10 928 men who underwent primary cryotherapy (943 patients) or brachytherapy (9985) with ≥2 years of follow-up using USA Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER-) Medicare linked data. Weighted propensity score methods were used.  Results:   Use of cryotherapy increased four-fold whereas brachytherapy utilization remained the same from 2001 to 2005 (P < 0.001). Men who underwent cryotherapy vs brachytherapy were older (P < 0.001), more likely to be Black (P < 0.001), less likely to live in areas of higher education (P < 0.001), less likely to live in areas with greater income (P < 0.001), and were more likely to live in urban vs rural areas (P = 0.007). In propensity score-weighted analyses, cryotherapy was associated with more urinary (41.4% vs 22.2%, P < 0.001) and erectile dysfunction (ED) complications (34.7% vs 21.0%, P < 0.001) while brachytherapy was associated with more bowel complications (19.0% vs 12.1%, P < 0.001). Cryotherapy was associated with greater use of salvage androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; 1.4 vs 0.5 per 100 person-years, P < 0.001), suggesting worse cancer control. Finally costs were significantly greater for brachytherapy vs cryotherapy ($16 887 vs $12 629 USA dollars, P < 0.001).

Eighty-seven patients also received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy. Toxicities were recorded with CTCAE v 3.0, International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS), and International Index of Erectile Function questionnaires.  Results:   Overall, acute Grade ≥2 genitourinary toxicity occurred in 21% and 30% of patients treated with (125)I and (103)Pd, respectively (p=0.16). There were no significant differences in IPSS change or urinary quality-of-life scores between the isotopes at 4, 6, or 12 months (p=0.20, 0.21, and 1.0, respectively). IPSS resolution occurred at a median of 11 and 6 months for (125)I and (103)Pd patients, respectively (p=0.03). On multivariate analysis, only the use of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was predictive of time to IPSS resolution (p=0.046). Late Grade ≥2 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 7% of (125)I patients and 6% of patients treated with (103)Pd.

We attempted to identify the factors associated with PSM and their location.  Patients and methods:   Records of patients undergoing RALP between 2003 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. We collected demographic (age, race, body mass index [BMI]), cumulative surgical experience (years from RALP introduction at our center), clinical (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels, and biopsy Gleason sums), nerve-sparing technique (yes/no), and pathological variables, including stage (organ-confined vs. non), Gleason sums, prostate weight, status, and location of the surgical margins. Multivariate regression models were constructed to identify the factors associated with PSM at prostate apex, periphery, proximal, and all locations.  Results:   A total of 560 patients were analyzed. Median age was 60.1 (interquartile range [IQR] 55.1-64.7), 19% were African-Americans, median BMI was 28.1 (25.8-30.8 kg/m(2)), PSA levels were 5.3 (3.9-7.1 ng/mL), and prostate weight was 45.2 (36.8-57.0 g). Gleason sums were as follows: ≤6 in 42.5%, 7 in 53.4%, and >7 in 3.1%. Overall, PSM were reported in 130 (23.2%), including 58 (44.6%) apical, 81 (62.3%) peripheral, and 20 (15.4%) proximal. The overall rate of PSM was associated with surgical experience, PSA, prostate weight, and Gleason sums. Apical PSM were independently associated only with surgical experience. Peripheral PSM were associated with PSA, stage, Gleason sums, and prostate weight. Finally, proximal margin status showed an association with PSA levels only.  Conclusions:   While peripheral, proximal, and overall PSM are largely associated with inherent disease biology (grade, PSA levels, etc.), apical margin status is independently associated only with cumulative surgical experience. These results suggest that a lower rates of positive apical margins may be obtained as the cumulative center experience grows, suggesting a potential role of a ""teaching learning curve,"" independently from disease characteristics.""","""['Matvey Tsivian', 'Dorit E Zilberman', 'Michael N Ferrandino', 'John F Madden', 'Vladimir Mouraviev', 'David M Albala']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Robot-assisted or pure laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: what is the optimal procedure for the surgical margins?

I can be evaluated as a single disease with two pathological subgroups: MP, representing the very large majoritary subgroup where inflammation and fat necrosis predominate and Retractile Mesenteritis, rarely found, where fibrosis and retraction predominate.  Objective:   To re-estimate the prevalence of MP in general population through a large prospective study, to compare the results with those of the literature and to evaluate the natural course of the condition.  Methods:   A continuous series of 613 consecutive unselected patients (280 females and 333 males) imaged with abdominal MDCT for various neoplastic (27%) or non neoplastic conditions (73%) constitutes the prospective material. A positive CT diagnosis of MP was based on the observation of at least three of five typical CT signs comprising: the presence of a well-defined ""mass effect"" on neighbouring structures (sign 1) constituted by mesenteric fat tissue of inhomogeneous higher attenuation than adjacent retroperitoneal or mesocolonic fat (sign 2), containing small soft tissue nodes (sign 3) typically surrounded by a hypoattenuated fatty ""halo sign"" (sign 4). Finally a hyperattenuating pseudocapsule may surround the all entity (sign 5).  Results:   A positive diagnosis of MP was made in 48 patients (prevalence of 7,83%) on the basis of the presence of at least 3 CT signs. After reconsidering the presence of the ""halo sign"" (sign 4) and of the ""pseudocapsule"" (sign 5) as ""sine qua non"" conditions for a positive diagnosis, a more restricted positive group of 21 cases was constituted (prevalence of 3,42%) comprising 10 males (3%) and 11 females (3,93%). There were 14 ""non-neoplastic"" patients - 6 males (2,27 %) and 8 females (3,6%) - and 7 ""neoplastic"" patients - 4 males (3,73%) and 3 females (5,17%) -.  Conclusions:   The prevalence of MP appears much higher than previously reported and the reason probably resides in the major technological evolution experienced in CT imaging during the last decade. This high prevalence probably explains the spontaneous association with the numerous and probably unrelated clinical situations found in the literature. Finally the vast majority of cases are considered as idiopathic, benign an asymptomatic. Except a discrete higher prevalence found in patients presenting with bladder and/or prostatic neoplasms and with lymphoma in group 1 the general prevalence of MP in our study doesn't significantly differs in the ""neoplastic"" and ""non neoplasic"" groups of patients.

(Materials and methods) Seven hundred and forty-six patients had undergone BT from November 2003 to April 2007 in a single institute, and of 130 patients who did not receive hormone therapy and had minimal 3-year follow up are analyzed. PSA bounce was defined as a rise of at least 0.4 ng/ml with spontaneous return to pre-bounce level or lower.  Result:   Among the 130 patients, 40 patients (30.8%) developed PSA bounce, and median time to PSA bounce was 18 months after the BT. With univariate analysis, younger patients (P = 0.027) and larger prostate (P = 0.030) had statistically significant correlation with PSA bounce. With multivariate analysis, younger patients were identified as only independent factor for predicting PSA bounce. Eight patients out of 130 patients (6.2%) triggered the Phoenix definition (nadir + 2 ng/ml) of PSA failure, however, clinical failure was seen only in 3 patients, and other 5 patients were considered as PSA bounce.  Conclusion:   PSA bounce is likely to occur in younger patients within 3 years after BT. It is clinically important to distinguish PSA bounce from PSA failure during following period after BT.""","""['Yasuto Yagi', 'Ryo Namitome', 'Yuho Kono', 'Toru Nishiyama', 'Kazuhito Toya', 'Atsunori Yorozu', 'Shiro Saito']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""['Analysis of prostate-specific antigen bounce after I(125) permanent seed implant for localised prostate cancer.', ""Prostate-specific antigen 'bounce' after permanent 125I-implant brachytherapy in Japanese men: a multi-institutional pooled analysis."", 'Prostate-specific antigen bounce after prostate seed implantation for localized prostate cancer: descriptions and implications.', 'Elevation of PSA after prostate radiotherapy: rebound or biochemical recurrence?.', 'Prostate-specific antigen bounce after permanent seed prostate brachytherapy: a literature review.']"""

ZEB1 (also known as δEF1, zfhx1a, TCF8, and Zfhep) plays a key role in regulating such diverse processes as T-cell development, skeletal patterning, reproduction, and cancer cell metastasis. However, the factors that regulate its expression and consequently the signaling pathways in which ZEB1 participates are poorly defined. Because it is induced by estrogen and progesterone and is high in prostate cancer, we investigated whether tcf8, which encodes ZEB1, is regulated by androgen. Data herein demonstrate that tcf8 is induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the human PC-3/AR prostate cancer cell line and that this induction is mediated by two androgen response elements (AREs).

Interventions with drugs or diet supplements that slow down the growth and progression of prostate cancer are potentially very effective in reducing the burden of prostate cancer, particularly if these treatments also prevent the de novo development of new prostatic malignancies. Challenges to identify efficacious agents and develop them for chemopreventive application in men at risk for prostate cancer have included uncertainty about which preclinical models have the ability to predict efficacy in men and lack of consensus about which early phase clinical trial designs are the most appropriate and cost-effective to test promising agents. Efficacy studies in animal models have identified several agents with potential chemopreventive activity against prostate cancer, but few of these findings have been translated into clinical trials. This article identifies some of the major issues associated with prostate cancer chemoprevention research and summarizes the most significant current results from animal efficacy studies and human clinical prevention trials. This summary focuses on: (1) Naturally occurring agents and compounds derived from such agents, including green tea and its constituents, silibinin and milk thistle, and genistein and soy, (2) chemoprevention drugs including agents interfering with androgen action, and (3) antioxidants such as selenium, vitamin E, and lycopene. The general lack of activity of antioxidants is discussed, followed by considerations about translation of preclinical chemoprevention efficacy data, focusing on dose, form, bioavailability, and timing of administration of the agent, as well as discussion of study design of clinical trials and the predictive ability of preclinical models.""","""['Nur Ozten-Kandaş', 'Maarten C Bosland']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Carcinog""","""['Prostate cancer chemoprevention by natural agents: Clinical evidence and potential implications.', 'Executive Summary of the National Cancer Institute Workshop: Highlights and recommendations.', 'Advances in prostate cancer chemoprevention: a translational perspective.', 'Molecular mechanisms of silibinin-mediated cancer chemoprevention with major emphasis on prostate cancer.', 'A randomized double-blind placebo controlled phase I-II study on clinical and molecular effects of dietary supplements in men with precancerous prostatic lesions.

This retrospective study investigated the impact of previous preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (PIHR) on outcome after open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) for prostatic cancer.  Methods:   Patients who had open RRP and who had previously undergone PIHR were identified. They were compared with a control group of patients matched for age, body mass index and tumour risk profile who had no history of inguinal hernia repair. Outcome measures included intraoperative data, histopathology and results at follow-up.  Results:   Sixty patients who had undergone open RRP after a previous PIHR were compared with 60 control patients. Operations lasted longer in the PIHR group (median (interquartile range, i.q.r.) 100 (90-120) versus 90 (85-100) min respectively; P < 0·001) and the operation was assessed as more difficult by the surgeon (P = 0·022).

Primary prostate and mammary cells, for example, are reprogrammed toward a basaloid, stem-like phenotype and form well-organized prostaspheres and mammospheres in Matrigel. However, in contrast to the selection of rare stem-like cells, the described growth conditions can generate 2 × 10(6) cells in 5 to 6 days from needle biopsies, and can generate cultures from cryopreserved tissue and from fewer than four viable cells. Continued cell proliferation is dependent on both feeder cells and Y-27632, and the conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) retain a normal karyotype and remain nontumorigenic. This technique also efficiently establishes cell cultures from human and rodent tumors. For example, CRCs established from human prostate adenocarcinoma displayed instability of chromosome 13, proliferated abnormally in Matrigel, and formed tumors in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. The ability to rapidly generate many tumor cells from small biopsy specimens and frozen tissue provides significant opportunities for cell-based diagnostics and therapeutics (including chemosensitivity testing) and greatly expands the value of biobanking.

Moreover, the J-Cap phase III trial in Japan suggested that CAB with bicalutamide significantly prolongs survival, which has led to the placement of CAB as the treatment of choice for advanced/metastatic prostate cancer. Neverthless, the benefit of CAB compared to monotherapy remains controversial because of the many issues involving survival, safety profiles, QOL, and cost-effectiveness. In this article, we discuss the feasibility of CAB for advanced/metastatic prostate cancer by reviewing the results of RCT, and introduce novel treatment modalities involving androgen and the androgen receptor, which are still under development.""","""['Katsuyuki Iida']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Gan To Kagaku Ryoho""","""['Combined androgen blockade for prostate cancer: review of efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness.', 'An oncology perspective on the benefits and cost of combined androgen blockade in advanced prostate cancer.', 'The cost-effectiveness of combined androgen blockade with bicalutamide and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist in men with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Is combined androgen blockade with bicalutamide cost-effective compared with combined androgen blockade with flutamide?', 'Maximal androgen blockade for advanced prostate cancer.']"""

The recurrence rate after radical prostatectomy alone or radiotherapy alone is generally high. Therefore, multimodal treatment is required. Recent multiple randomized trials have shown survival benefits of radiotherapy combined with long-term hormonal therapy. Dose escalation utilizing intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or brachytherapy has the potential benefit of exerting local control. Since previous trials used conventional external radiotherapy, the optimal duration of hormonal therapy combined with dose escalated radiotherapy remains unknown. On the other hand, some patients can be cured by radical prostatectomy alone, and approximately half of patients with adverse features after surgery can be rescued by adjuvant radiotherapy. Primary hormonal therapy is used widely and has shown favorable results in patients with T3 prostate cancer, particularly in Japan. Based on the life expectancy and comorbidity of an individual patient, hormonal therapy can be chosen as a primary treatment. There are controversies over treatment options such as surgery, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy in clinical T3 prostate cancer.

Aim:   To test the effect of penile rehabilitation according to preoperative patient characteristics.  Methods:   We included 435 consecutive patients treated with BNSRP between 2004 and 2008. Preoperative age, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were used to subdivide patients into three groups according to foreseen risk of erectile dysfunction (ED) after surgery: low (age ≤65, IIEF-erectile function (EF) ≥26, CCI ≤1; N = 184), intermediate (age 66-69 or IIEF-EF 11-25, CCI ≤1; N = 115), and high (age ≥70 or IIEF-EF ≤10 or CCI ≥2; N = 136). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to test the difference in EF recovery rates among patients left untreated after surgery (N = 193), those receiving on-demand phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-I; N = 147), and those treated with chronic use of PDE5-I (taken every day or every other day for 3-6 months; N = 95). The same analyses were repeated within each risk category.  Main outcome measure:   Erectile function (EF) was evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF).

Results:   No difference in terms of EF recovery was found between patients receiving on-demand vs. daily PDE5-I (P = 0.09) in the overall population. Similarly, comparable efficacy of the two treatment schedules (on-demand vs. chronic) was demonstrated in patients with low and high risk of ED (all P ≥ 0.8). Conversely, daily therapy with PDE5-I showed significantly higher efficacy for the EF recovery rate compared with the on-demand PDE5-I administration schedule in patients with intermediate risk of ED (3-year EF recovery: 74% vs. 52%, respectively; P = 0.02).

A planning computed tomography (CT) scan and 2 subsequent CT scans were prospectively obtained for 20 prostate cancer patients with intraprostatic fiducial markers. After CT registration, SV displacement relative to the prostate was quantified as a function of margin size for both the proximal (1 cm) SV (PSV) and the full SV (FSV). Two IMRT plans were simulated for each patient (prostate + PSV and prostate + FSV) both with a uniform 5-mm PTV margin. Minimum clinical target volume (CTV) dose (D(min)) and the volume of SV receiving 95% of the prescription dose (V(95%)) were assessed during treatment and compared with the initial plan. In all cases, SV displacement with respect to the prostate was greater for the FSV compared with the PSV. To ensure at least 95% geometrical coverage of the CTV for 90% of patients, margins of 5 and 8 mm were required for the PSV and FSV, respectively. Dosimetrically, residual SV displacement had minimal impact on PSV coverage compared with FSV coverage. For the PSV D(min) was ≥95% of the prescribed dose in 90% of patients with an overall mean V(95%) of 99.6 ± 0.8%; for the FSV D(min) was ≥95% of the prescribed dose in only 45% of patients with a mean V(95%) of 97.9 ± 2.4%. The SVs move differentially from the prostate and exhibit greater variation with increasing distance from the prostate.

Aim:   To examine whether preoperative ED has a relationship with adverse prostate cancer features in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   We analyzed data from our institution on 676 patients who underwent RP between 2001 and 2010. Crude and adjusted logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between preoperative ED and several pathological parameters. The log-rank test and multivariate proportional hazards model were conducted to determine the association of preoperative ED with biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Main outcome measures:   The expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) instrument was used to evaluate preoperative erectile function (EF). Preoperative normal EF was defined as EPIC-SF ≥ 60 points while ED was defined as preoperative EPIC-SF lower than 60 points.  Results:   Preoperatively, a total of 343 (50.7%) men had normal EF and 333 (49.3%) men had ED. After adjusting for covariates, preoperative ED was identified a risk factor for positive extracapsular extension (OR 1.57; P = 0.029) and high percentage of tumor involvement (OR 1.56; P = 0.047). In a Kaplan-Meier curve, a trend was identified that patients with ED had higher incidence of BCR than men with normal EF (P = 0.091). Moreover, using a multivariate Cox model, higher preoperative EF was negatively associated with BCR (HR 0.99; P = 0.014).  Conclusions:   These results suggest that the likelihood for adverse pathological outcomes as well as BCR following prostatectomy is higher among men with preoperative ED, though these results require validation in larger datasets.

Here, we show for the first time, that treatment with (-)-gossypol and multikinase inhibitor sorafenib synergistically suppresses the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (AI-PC) in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that sorafenib attenuates (-)-gossypol-induced Mcl-1 upregulation in AI-PCs. In this way, it serves as a potent chemosensitizer to affect cell death. Interestingly, (-)-gossypol and sorafenib induce cell death via two distinct pathways among different AI-PCs; DU145 cells via apoptosis and PC-3 via autophagy. The appointed death pathway may depend on the level of proapoptotic protein Bak, although the level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 plays some role in it. DU145 cells with high Bak level prefer apoptosis induction, whereas PC-3 cells with low Bak prefer the induction of autophagy. Furthermore, inhibiting nondominant death pathways, that is, autophagy in DU145 and apoptosis in PC-3, enhances cell killing by (-)-gossypol/sorafenib combination therapy. Ultimately, our data expose a new action for sorafenib as an enhancer of (-)-gossypol-induced cell growth suppression and reveal a novel cell death mode by Bak activation manners in AI-PCs.

Material and methods:   One hundred consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens in patients who had not received pre-operative hormone treatment were retrospectively reviewed. These surgical samples were processed according to a standardized protocol.

The histological findings were compared with the prostate gland weight using Windows SPAS, 13.0 statistical package with a significance value of p<0.05. According to the prostate gland weight, three groups were established: <40 g (33%), 40 - 90 g (61%), and >90 g (6%).  Results:   A statistically significant association (p=0.001) was found between the prostate gland weight and tumor volume since 15 of the 33 glands with weight under 40 g accounted for more than 50% of the glands affected by tumor compared to none of the 6 patients with total weight over 90 g. A significant relationship was also found between the multimodality and weight. (P=0.03), so that 24 of the 33 glands under 40 g had bilateral multimodality compared to only 1 out of the 6 glands over 90 g. The neural invasion, number of PIN foci and the highest combined Gleason grade were frequent in low volume prostates, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.

Both mRNA and miRNA expression changes in cancer diseases are described to reflect clinical characteristics like staging and prognosis. Furthermore, miRNA abundance can directly affect target transcripts and translation in tumor cells. Prediction models are trained to identify either mRNA or miRNA signatures for patient stratification. With the increasing number of microarray studies collecting mRNA and miRNA from the same patient cohort there is a need for statistical methods to integrate or fuse both kinds of data into one prediction model in order to find a combined signature that improves the prediction.  Results:   Here, we propose a new method to fuse miRNA and mRNA data into one prediction model. Since miRNAs are known regulators of mRNAs we used the correlations between them as well as the target prediction information to build a bipartite graph representing the relations between miRNAs and mRNAs. This graph was used to guide the feature selection in order to improve the prediction. The method is illustrated on a prostate cancer data set comprising 98 patient samples with miRNA and mRNA expression data. The biochemical relapse was used as clinical endpoint.

During 1996-2006 a substantial increase of 81% in the number of elderly patients newly diagnosed with cancer stage IV was found. Over 70% of these patients received primary cancer treatment, irrespective of serious comorbidity (in 61% of them) and a short life expectancy (most died within 12 months except for those with cancer of the prostate). The vast increase in the number of the elderly who need palliative care contributes to awareness among healthcare professionals about future demand. They enable anticipation and planning sufficient end-of-life care capacity, but also to develop care planning programmes for these older palliative cancer patients.

MTDH has been detected at the plasma membrane as well as in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and the function of MTDH in these locales remains under investigation. In the nucleus, MTDH acts as a transcription co-factor to induce expression of chemoresistance-associated genes. However, MTDH is predominantly cytoplasmic in prostate tumors, and this localization correlates with poor prognosis. Herein, we used endometrial cancer cells as a model system to define a new role for MTDH in the cytoplasm. First, MTDH was primarily localized to the cytoplasm in endometrial cancer cells, and the N-terminal region of MTDH was required to maintain cytoplasmic localization. Next, we identified novel binding partners for cytoplasmic MTDH, including RNA-binding proteins and components of the RNA-induced silencing complex. Nucleic acids were required for the association of MTDH with these cytoplasmic proteins. Furthermore, MTDH interacted with and regulated protein expression of multiple mRNAs, such as PDCD10 and KDM6A. Depletion of cytoplasmic MTDH was associated with increased stress granule formation, reduced survival in response to chemotherapy and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBF1120, Rad51 nuclear accumulation, and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M. Finally, in vivo tumor formation was abrogated with knockdown of cytoplasmic MTDH. Taken together, our data identify a novel function for cytoplasmic MTDH as an RNA-binding protein.

In this study, we investigated a novel connection between PGE(2)-induced EP4 and Snail (encodes DNA binding zinc finger protein that acts as transcriptional repressor) signaling in prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   To investigate the key role of serum PGE(2), EP4, p-Akt and Snail in prostate cancer progression, we used prostate-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-knockout (PTEN-KO) mice of different age groups from 4 to 28 weeks. To determine the EP4-specific interaction with Snail in prostate cancer, we used cell-based assays, including siRNA knockdown, and treatment with EP4 antagonist.  Results:   An interaction between EP4 with Snail was evident in prostate-specific PTEN-KO mice that showed an elevated level of PGE(2) in the serum and of EP4, p-Akt and Snail in the tissues. Prostate cancer cells transfected with EP4-siRNA and treatments with EP4 antagonist suggest a link between EP4, and Snail activation, potentially via p-Akt. Cells treated with EP4 antagonist exhibited a significant decrease in Snail, mesenchymal markers and cell migration, and cell cycle arrest with a gain in E-cadherin levels.

At 34 weeks, palpable tumors were observed in 70 of 0.1% and only 50 of 0.2% PFE-supplemented mice. Compared with median survival of 43 weeks in water-fed mice, 0.1 and 0.2% PFE-supplemented mice exhibited median life expectancy of 73 and 92 weeks, respectively. Compared with respective water-fed groups, none of the mice in PFE-supplemented groups exhibited metastases to any of the distant organs at 20 weeks and only 20% mice exhibited metastasis at 34 weeks of age. Many of the PFE-supplemented animals had multiple foci of well-differentiated carcinoma but no evidence of poorly differentiated carcinoma. PFE supplementation resulted in simultaneous and significant inhibition of IGF-I/Akt/mTOR pathways in the prostate tissues and tumors.

All patients had a Nickel-Titanium (Ni-Ti) stent inserted into the prostate part of urethra. The stent has been used during the treatment course as an internal marker for patient positioning prior to treatment. In this study the stent is used for delineating urethra while intensity modulated radiotherapy was used for lowering dose to urethra. Evaluation of the dose plans were performed using a tumour control probability model based on the concept of uniform equivalent dose.  Results:   The feasibility of the urethra dose reduction method is validated and a reduction of about 17% is shown to be possible. Calculations suggest a nearly preserved tumour control probability.

The dose was subsequently increased to 27 Gy (13.5 Gy × 2) delivered in 1 day. We report the acute and early chronic genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity.  Methods and materials:   A total of 173 patients were treated between December 2005 and July 2010. However, only the first 100 were part of the IRB-approved study and out of these, only 94 had a minimal follow-up of 6 months, representing the study population for this preliminary report. All patients had clinical Stage T2b or less (American Joint Committee on Cancer, 5th edition), Gleason score 6-7 (3+4), and prostate-specific antigen level of ≤12 ng/mL. Ultrasound-guided HDR-BT with real-time dosimetry was used. The prescription dose was 24 Gy for the first 50 patients and 27 Gy thereafter. The dosimetric goals and constraints were the same for the two dose groups. Toxicity was scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3. The highest toxicity scores encountered at any point during follow-up are reported.  Results:   The median follow-up was 17 months (range, 6-40.5). Most patients had Grade 0-1 acute toxicity. The Grade 2 acute genitourinary toxicity was mainly frequency/urgency (13%), dysuria (5%), hematuria, and dribbling/hesitancy (2%). None of the patients required a Foley catheter at any time; however, 8% of the patients experienced transient Grade 1 diarrhea. No other acute gastrointestinal toxicities were found. The most common chronic toxicity was Grade 2 urinary frequency/urgency in 16% of patients followed by dysuria in 4% of patients; 2 patients had Grade 2 rectal bleeding and 1 had Grade 4, requiring laser treatment.

To this end we developed a statistical model that predicts tumor presence on a voxel level (2.5×2.5×2.5 mm3) inside the peripheral zone. Furthermore, we show how this model can be used to derive a valuable input for radiotherapy treatment planning.  Methods and materials:   The model was created on 87 radiotherapy patients. For the validation of the voxelwise performance of the model, an independent group of 12 prostatectomy patients was used. After model validation, the model was stratified to create three different risk levels for tumor presence: gross tumor volume (GTV), high-risk clinical target volume (CTV), and low-risk CTV.  Results:   The model gave an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.70 for the prediction of tumor presence in the prostatectomy group. When the registration error between magnetic resonance images and pathologic delineation was taken into account, the area under the curve further improved to 0.89. We propose that model outcome values with a high positive predictive value can be used to define the GTV. Model outcome values with a high negative predictive value can be used to define low-risk CTV regions. The intermediate outcome values can be used to define a high-risk CTV.  Conclusions:   We developed a logistic regression with a high diagnostic performance for voxelwise prediction of tumor presence. The model output can be used to define different risk levels for tumor presence, which in turn could serve as an input for dose planning. In this way the robustness of tumor delineations for focal boost therapy can be greatly improved.""","""['Greetje Groenendaal', 'Alie Borren', 'Maaike R Moman', 'Evelyn Monninkhof', 'Paul J van Diest', 'Marielle E P Philippens', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Uulke A van der Heide']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Multiparametric MRI Tumor Probability Model for the Detection of Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy: Pathologic Validation and Comparison With Manual Tumor Delineations.', 'Preoperative neural network using combined magnetic resonance imaging variables, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score to predict positive surgical margins.', 'Peripheral zone prostate cancer localization by multiparametric magnetic resonance at 3 T: unbiased cancer identification by matching to histopathology.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate - technique and clinical applications.', 'Choice of optimal margins in prostate conformal radiotherapy.', 'Improving liver tumor image contrast and synthesizing novel tissue contrasts by adaptive multiparametric MRI fusion.', 'Introducing new plan evaluation indices for prostate dose painting IMRT plans based on apparent diffusion coefficient images.', 'Value of Targeted Biopsies and Combined PSMA PET/CT and mp-MRI Imaging in Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Primary Radiotherapy.', 'Short-duration dynamic 18FDCFPyL PET and CT perfusion imaging to localize dominant intraprostatic lesions in prostate cancer: validation against digital histopathology and comparison to 18FDCFPyL PET/MR at 120 minutes.', 'Primary treatment of prostate cancer using 1.5\xa0T MR-linear accelerator.']"""

Contours were compared in terms of volume, dimensions, posterior rectal indentation, and observer variability. The Jaccard index quantified spatial overlap between contours from duplicated images.  Results:   The mean US/MR volume ratio was 0.99±0.08 (p=0.5). The width, height, and length ratios for the prostate were 0.98±0.06 (p=0.09), 0.99±0.08 (p=0.4), and 1.05±0.14 (p=0.1). Rectal indentation was larger on US by 0.18mL (p=0.01) and correlated with prostate volume (p<0.01). MR and US interobserver variability in volume were similar at 3.5±1.7 and 3.3±1.9mL (p=0.6). Intraobserver variability was smaller on US at 1.4±1.1mL compared with MR at 2.4±2.2mL (p=0.01). Local intraobserver variability was lower on US at the midgland slice (p<0.01) but lower on MR at the base (p<0.01) and apex (p<0.01) slices.

HIF-1α expression was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western immunoblotting. A clonogenic assay and the cell counting kit-8 assay were performed to determine the radiosensitivity. Flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis and cell cycle distribution.  Results:   HIF-1α siRNA downregulated HIF-1α expression in PC3 cells on the mRNA level and protein level, and its silencing effect on mRNA level was evident at 24-72 hours. The HIF-1α silence group had a low final slope of exponential part of a radiation survival curve, survival fraction of 2 Gy, quasi-threshold dose, and extrapolation number, and the sensitizing enhancement ratio was 1.24. The cell counting kit-8 assay showed decreased cellular viability (24 hours, F = 139.74, P < .01; 48 hours, F = 495.49, P < .01; 72 hours, F = 426.89, P < .01; 96 hours, F = 471.11, P < .01) in the HIF-1α silence group. Silencing HIF-1α also induced more apoptosis (PC3, 17.9% ± 1.65%; control group, 18.6% ± 1.37%; HIF-1α silence group, 29.1% ± 2.16%; F = 169.9, P < .01) and cell cycle arrest at the S, G(2)/M phase.  Conclusion:   The suppression of HIF-1α in PC3 cells sensitizes the PC3 cells to irradiation. We have shown that HIF-1α inhibition attenuates repair of postradiation injury, with an increase in both interphase death and reproductive death after irradiation, apoptotic potential, and cell cycle arrest at the proliferative phase.""","""['Yuhua Huang', 'Jiang Yu', 'Chunyin Yan', 'Jianquan Hou', 'Jingxian Pu', 'Guangbo Zhang', 'Zhenyu Fu', 'Xizhi Wang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Impact of RNA interference targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha on chemosensitivity in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells under hypoxia.', 'Effect of silencing HIF-1alpha by RNA interference on expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 under hypoxia.', 'Effect of silencing hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha by RNA interference on human breast carcinoma cell line.', 'Inhibitory effect of interfering RNA targeting HIF-1alpha and VEGF on retinal neovascularization in the mouse.', 'Effects of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) on the growth & adhesion in tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'Long and short non-coding RNA and radiation response: a review.', 'Progress in Delivery of siRNA-Based Therapeutics Employing Nano-Vehicles for Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Hypoxic Radioresistance: Can ROS Be the Key to Overcome It?', 'Twist1 Enhances Hypoxia Induced Radioresistance in Cervical Cancer Cells by Promoting Nuclear EGFR Localization.', 'Mechanistic Insights into Molecular Targeting and Combined Modality Therapy for Aggressive, Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   From 2001 to 2009, a total of 1038 patients underwent RARP and 707 patients underwent open RRP. Perioperative factors and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) quality of life scores were compared between patients who did and did not develop a VUAS. Independent significant predictors of VUAS development were identified using multivariable modeling.  Results:   The incidence of VUAS in open RRP cases was higher (53/707, 7.5%) than for RARP (22/1038, 2.1%) (P<.0001). Intervention consisted of dilation in 34 of 75 cases (45.3%), internal urethrotomy in 8 of 75 (10.7%), and multiple procedures in 30 of 75 (40%). Open technique (P<.0001, odds ratio [OR]=3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.8-5.2), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence (P=.02, OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.2-4.1), postoperative hematuria (P=.02, OR=3.7, 95% CI=1.2-11.3), urinary leak (P=.002, OR=6.0, 95% CI=1.9-19.2), and urinary retention (P=.004, OR=3.5, 95% CI=1.5-8.7) were significant independent predictors of VUAS development. EPIC incontinence scores were similar between VUAS and non-VUAS patients, whereas irritative voiding scores were worse initially with VUAS but became similar by 12 months.  Conclusion:   There is a higher rate of VUAS after open RRP vs RARP. Most cases of VUAS require endoscopic intervention. Predictors include open surgery, PSA recurrence, and postoperative hematuria, urinary leak, and retention.

We report brachytherapy outcomes for patients with higher risk features randomized to substantially different supplemental EBRT regimens.  Methods and materials:   Between December 1999 and June 2004, 247 patients were randomized to 20 Gy vs. 44 Gy EBRT followed by a palladium-103 boost (115 Gy vs. 90 Gy). The eligibility criteria included clinically organ-confined disease with Gleason score 7-10 and/or pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level 10-20 ng/mL. The median follow-up period was 9.0 years. Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) was defined as a PSA level of ≤0.40 ng/mL after nadir. The median day 0 prescribed dose covering 90% of the target volume was 125.7%; 80 men received androgen deprivation therapy (median, 4 months). Multiple parameters were evaluated for their effect on bPFS.  Results:   For the entire cohort, the cause-specific survival, bPFS, and overall survival rates were 97.7%, 93.2%, and 80.8% at 8 years and 96.9%, 93.2%, and 75.4% at 10 years, respectively. The bPFS rate was 93.1% and 93.4% for the 20-Gy and 44-Gy arms, respectively (p = .994). However, no statistically significant differences were found in cause-specific survival or overall survival were identified. When stratified by PSA level of ≤10 ng/mL vs. >10 ng/mL, Gleason score, or androgen deprivation therapy, no statistically significant differences in bPFS were discerned between the two EBRT regimens. On multivariate analysis, bPFS was most closely related to the preimplant PSA and clinical stage. For patients with biochemically controlled disease, the median PSA level was <0.02 ng/mL.  Conclusion:   The results of the present trial strongly suggest that two markedly different supplemental EBRT regimens result in equivalent cause-specific survival, bPFS, and overall survival. It is probable that the lack of benefit for a higher supplemental EBRT dose is the result of the high-quality brachytherapy dose distributions.""","""['Gregory S Merrick', 'Kent E Wallner', 'Wayne M Butler', 'Robert W Galbreath', 'Al V Taira', 'Peter Orio', 'Edward Adamovich']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['High-risk prostate cancer with Gleason score 8-10 and PSA level ≤15 ng/mL treated with permanent interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Impact of supplemental external beam radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy on biochemical outcome after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', '20 Gy versus 44 Gy supplemental beam radiation with Pd-103 prostate brachytherapy: preliminary biochemical outcomes from a prospective randomized multi-center trial.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic Radiation Therapy versus Brachytherapy: Relative Strengths of Two Highly Efficient Options for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Assessing the role of external beam radiation therapy in combination with brachytherapy versus brachytherapy alone for unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'A comparison of outcomes for patients with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer treated with low dose rate and high dose rate brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiotherapy.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Use of androgen deprivation therapy with prostate brachytherapy-A systematic literature review.', 'Permanent prostate brachytherapy extracapsular radiation dose distributions: analysis of a multi-institutional database.']"""

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and is diagnosed earlier than before. Brachytherapy is a treatment for prostate cancer that preserves ejaculation. Our aim was to study the fertility of men treated with prostate brachytherapy in order to improve patient information.  Patients and methods:   In a series of 270 sexually active men with localized prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy (permanent implants of Iode 125) at the Institute Claudius Regaud between 2000 and 2006, mean age 65 years (43-80), four patients spontaneously expressed their interest in the preservation of fertility and had an andrological evaluation.  Results:   Four patients were aged 43, 48, 57 and 61 years, all working (including two businessmen), their partner was aged respectively 42, 37, 47 and 38 years. All four had a post-treatment semen analysis (done over a year after brachytherapy) rich in spermatozoa, with moderate asthenospermia, the main anomaly being severe hypospermia. These spermiograms were nonetheless consistent with the occurrence of spontaneous pregnancy (occurrence of miscarriage in the patient 1).

Our study evaluates immunohistochemical expression of ET-1 and ET-AR on prostate biopsy specimen and the predictive value for biochemical relapse on patients with advanced and metastatic cancer. We also evaluated the impact of ET-1 and ET-AR expression on local progression and metastatic bone progression for these patients.  Patients and method:   From 1992 to June 2009, 44 patients with clinical T3 stage and metastatic lymph nodes were included. PSA levels, Gleason score in biopsy cores, number of invaded lymph nodes, the existence of nodular capsule transgression and hormonal treatment given to the patient, were analyzed. Biopsy cores were submitted to immunohistochemical study of the expression of ET-1 and ET-AR. Semi-quantitative ET-1 and ET-AR staining assessment was always realised by the same pathologist.  Results:   The average age of the cohort was 65.6 (standard deviation 6.3), median PSA level was 52.8 ng /ml (3-227), median time of follow-up was 70 months (6-144). Biochemical relapse was observed in 62.8%. Statistically significant stronger ET-1 expression was observed in biopsies of patients with a biochemical relapse (p=0.014). Eighty percent of patients with a biochemical relapse had a high level of ET-AR expression, but no statistical significance has been shown (p=0.109). The relative risk for progression under hormonal therapy was 1.9 in case of high level of ET-1 expression and biochemical relapse was confirmed 8 months earlier in average. High level of ET-AR expression on biopsy cores may indicate earlier local progression and metastatic bone progression but there were no statistical proof.  Conclusion:   In our study, the strength of ET-1 expression in prostate cancer biopsy cores is a prognostic factor of biochemical relapse for cT3 stage patients with metastatic lymph nodes. We have not been able to prove that ET-1 is an independent prognostic factor. A high level of ET-AR expression on prostate biopsy cores is not, in our study, a prognosis factor for predicting the biochemical relapse.""","""['S Rotondo', 'J Menard', 'A Durlach', 'P Birembaut', 'F Staerman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prog Urol""","""['Prostate biopsies endothelin-1 expression: pt3a stage prognostic factor?.', 'Phase I-II trial evaluating combined intensity-modulated radiotherapy and in situ gene therapy with or without hormonal therapy in treatment of prostate cancer-interim report on PSA response and biopsy data.', 'Percentage of cancer in prostate biopsies as prognostic factor for staging and postoperative biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the relevance of the sentinel lymph node biopsy by laparoscopy in staging locoregional patients with clinically localized PC.  Patients and methods:   A transrectal ultrasound-guided injection by 0.3 mL/100 MBq (99m)Tc-sulfur rhenium colloid in each prostatic lobe was performed the day before surgery. The detection was realized intraoperatively with a laparoscopic probe (Clerad(®) Gamma Sup) followed by extensive dissection. Counts of SLN were performed in vivo and confirmed ex vivo. The histological analysis was performed by hematoxyline-phloxine-safran staining and followed by immunochemistry if SLN is free.  Results:   Seventy patients with carcinoma of the prostate at intermediate or high risk of lymph node metastases were included. The intraoperative detection rate was 68/70 (97%). Fourteen patients had lymph node metastases, six only in SLN. The false negative rate was 2/14 (14%). The internal iliac region was the first metastatic site (40.9%).

At present, at least 26 distinctive amyloid forms have been detected with different clinical importance and treatment. They have characteristic staning fetaures with Congo red. Amyloid may be detected in 2-10% of prostates that have been removed because of hyperplasia or carcinoma. Amyloidosis of seminal vesicles is accepted as senil amyloidosis and it is not accompanied by systemic amyloidosis or clinical symptoms. This condition is the most common form of localized amyloidosis. In this study we aimed to investigate incidence and histologic characteristics of amyloidosis of seminal vesicles in radical prostatectomy materials of the patients whose prostate carcinomas were treated surgically.  Material and method:   Amyloid depositions in seminal vesicles of 207 radical prostatectomy materials that prostates had been removed due to localized prostate carcinoma. Amyloid depositions were confirmed with Congo red staining and polarization microscope.  Results:   Amyloidosis of seminal vesicles was detected in 10 (4.8%) of cases. Mean age of the patients is 66.2 years. Amyloid depositions tend to be nodular and bilateral in subepithelial region of affected seminal vesicles. Amyloid depositions were not detected in blood vessels in seminal vesicles or prostate parenchyma.

In this study, we investigated the association between fish intake and localized and advanced PCA taking into account fish types (lean vs. fatty) and cooking practices.  Methods:   We analyzed data for 1,096 controls, 717 localized and 1,140 advanced cases from the California Collaborative Prostate Cancer Study, a multiethnic, population-based case-control study. We used multivariate conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios using nutrient density converted variables of fried fish, tuna, dark fish and white fish consumption. We tested for effect modification by cooking methods (high- vs. low-temperature methods) and levels of doneness.  Results:   We observed that high white fish intake was associated with increased risk of advanced PCA among men who cooked with high-temperature methods (pan-frying, oven-broiling and grilling) until fish was well done (p (trend) = 0.001). No associations were found among men who cooked fish at low temperature and/or just until done (white fish x cooking method p (interaction) = 0.040).

We further showed that both agonists to estrogen receptor (ER), DPN (ERβ) and PPT (ERα), as well as estrogenic natural compounds including soy isoflavones attenuated D+T-induced PSA production. Studies with the pure ER agonists showed that activating either ERα or ERβ could inhibit both D+T-mediated and R1881-mediated PSA production with the D+T effect being more pronounced. In conclusion, natural compounds with estrogenic activity and pure ER agonists are very potent inhibitors of stromal conversion of DHEA to androgenic metabolites. More studies are needed to characterize the mechanisms involved in estrogenic modulation of the endocrine-immune-paracrine balance of the prostate microenvironment.""","""['Günter Vollmer', 'Janina Helle', 'Hakima Amri', 'Xunxian Liu', 'Julia T Arnold']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['TGFβ1 alters androgenic metabolites and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme expression in human prostate reactive stromal primary cells: Is steroid metabolism altered by prostate reactive stromal microenvironment?', 'Human prostate stromal cells stimulate increased PSA production in DHEA-treated prostate cancer epithelial cells.', 'Endocrine-immune-paracrine interactions in prostate cells as targeted by phytomedicines.', 'Influence of stromal-epithelial interactions on androgen action.', 'DHEA metabolism in prostate: For better or worse?', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone-induces miR-21 transcription in HepG2 cells through estrogen receptor β and androgen receptor.', 'TGFβ1 alters androgenic metabolites and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme expression in human prostate reactive stromal primary cells: Is steroid metabolism altered by prostate reactive stromal microenvironment?']"""

It determines the treatment that will be applied further. In current practice, urologists use the pathological stage predictions provided in Partin tables to support their decisions. However, Partin tables are based on logistic regression (LR) and built from US data. Our objective is to investigate a range of both predictive methods and of predictive variables for pathological stage prediction and assess them with respect to their predictive quality based on U.K. data.  Methods and material:   The latest version of Partin tables was applied to a large scale British dataset in order to measure their performances by mean of concordance index (c-index). The data was collected by the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) and gathered records from over 1700 patients treated with prostatectomy in 57 centers across UK. The original methodology was replicated using the BAUS dataset and evaluated using concordance index. In addition, a selection of classifiers, including, among others, LR, artificial neural networks and Bayesian networks (BNs) was applied to the same data and compared with each other using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Subsets of the data were created in order to observe how classifiers perform with the inclusion of extra variables. Finally a local dataset prepared by the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary was used to study the effect on predictive performance of using different variables.  Results:   Partin tables have low predictive quality (c-index=0.602) when applied on UK data for comparison on patients with organ confined and extra prostatic extension conditions, patients at the two most frequently observed pathological stages. The use of replicate lookup tables built from British data shows an improvement in the classification, but the overall predictive quality remains low (c-index=0.610). Comparing a range of classifiers shows that BNs generally outperform other methods. Using the four variables from Partin tables, naive Bayes is the best classifier for the prediction of each class label (AUC=0.662 for OC). When two additional variables are added, the results of LR (0.675), artificial neural networks (0.656) and BN methods (0.679) are overall improved. BNs show higher AUCs than the other methods when the number of variables raises  Conclusion:   The predictive quality of Partin tables can be described as low to moderate on U.K. data. This means that following the predictions generated by Partin tables, many patients would received an inappropriate treatment, generally associated with a deterioration of their quality of life. In addition to demographic differences between U.K. and the original U.S. population, the methodology and in particular LR present limitations. BN represents a promising alternative to LR from which prostate cancer staging can benefit. Heuristic search for structure learning and the inclusion of more variables are elements that further improve BN models quality.""","""['Olivier Regnier-Coudert', 'John McCall', 'Robert Lothian', 'Thomas Lam', 'Sam McClinton', ""James N'dow""]""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Artif Intell Med""","""['Validation of Partin tables and development of a preoperative nomogram for Japanese patients with clinically localized prostate cancer using 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology consensus on Gleason grading: data from the Clinicopathological Research Group for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'The newer the better?

Using whole genome miRNA and mRNA expression profiling of TICs from primary prostate cancer cells, we identified a set of up-regulated miRNAs and a set of genes down-regulated in PSs. Inhibition of these miRNAs results in a decrease of prostatosphere formation and an increase in target gene expression. This study uses genome-wide miRNA profiling to analyze expression in TICs.

Objective:   Assess the rate of RARP utilization and reexamine the difference in perioperative complication rates between RARP and ORP in light of RARP's supplanting laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) as the most common MIRP technique.  Design, setting, and participants:   As of October 2008, a robot-assisted modifier was introduced to denote robot-assisted procedures. Relying on the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between October 2008 and December 2009, patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) were identified. The robot-assisted modifier (17.4x) was used to identify RARP (n=11 889). Patients with the minimally invasive modifier code (54.21) without the robot-assisted modifier were classified as having undergone LRP and were removed from further analyses. The remainder were classified as ORP patients (n=7389).  Intervention:   All patients underwent RARP or ORP.  Measurements:   We compared the rates of blood transfusions, intraoperative and postoperative complications, prolonged length of stay (pLOS), and in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analyses of propensity score-matched populations, fitted with general estimation equations for clustering among hospitals, further adjusted for confounding factors.  Results and limitations:   Of 19 462 RPs, 61.1% were RARPs, 38.0% were ORPs, and 0.9% were LRPs. In multivariable analyses of propensity score-matched populations, patients undergoing RARP were less likely to receive a blood transfusion (odds ratio [OR]: 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.40), to experience an intraoperative complication (OR: 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.71) or a postoperative complication (OR: 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.96), and to experience a pLOS (OR: 0.28; 95% CI, 0.26-0.30). Limitations of this study include lack of adjustment for tumor characteristics, surgeon volume, learning curve effect, and longitudinal follow-up.

In the present study, we examined the functional roles of ETS1 in paclitaxel resistance and invasion using human prostate cancer PC3 cells and paclitaxel-resistant PC3PR cells established from PC3 cells. Our results showed that ETS1mRNA and protein expression was markedly up-regulated in paclitaxel-resistant PC3PR cells compared with paclitaxel-sensitive PC3 cells. The mRNA levels of MDR1 as well as MMP1, MMP3, MMP9 and uPA were positively correlated with that of ETS1. In PC3PR cells, silencing of ETS1 expression by siRNAs inhibited the activity of the MDR1 promoter containing ETS binding sites, reduced the mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 and suppressed paclitaxel resistance. Furthermore, ETS1 knockdown decreased secretion of MMP9 as well as its intracellular mRNA level, and dramatically inhibited invasion of PC3PR cells. Our results suggest that ETS1 promotes paclitaxel resistance and invasion in part by up-regulating MDR1 and MMP9 expression.

Patients and methods:   This study included 306 patients with prostate cancer operated for skeletal metastases during 1989-2010. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate survival. Cox multiple regression analysis was performed to study risk factors, and results were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs).  Results:   The median age at surgery was 72 (49-94) years. The median survival after surgery was 0.5 (0-16) years. The cumulative 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival after surgery was 29% (95% CI: 24-34), 14% (10-18), and 8% (5-11). Age over 70 years (HR 1.4), generalized metastases (HR 2.4), and multiple skeletal metastases (HR 2.3) resulted in an increased risk of death after surgery. Patients with lesions in the humerus (HR 0.6) had a lower death rate. The reoperation rate was 9% (n = 31). The reasons for reoperation were deep wound infection (n = 10), hematoma (n = 7), material (implant) failure (n = 3), wound dehiscence (n = 3), increasing neurological symptoms (n = 2), prosthetic dislocation (n = 2), and others (n = 4).

They remained completely hydrated throughout exposure to the synchrotron beam. RESULTS: The added change that was reported for prostate cancer in 2009 was obtained for all TRAMP mice samples, indicating that this change can be read as High Grade Cancer in human diagnostic tests. DISCUSSION: These changes were evident for all 3 and 7 week old TRAMP mice samples but not for any of the control samples. This indicates that the changes in the fibre diffraction patterns appear much earlier than in any other available prostate cancer diagnostic test which cannot verify the presence of prostate cancer before 10 weeks of age.

However, many studies have failed to confirm these findings, raising the possibility of contamination as a source of the positive results. One PCR reagent, Platinum Taq polymerase (pol) has been reported to contain mouse DNA that produces false-positive MLV PCR results. We report here the finding of a large number of PCR reagents that have low levels of MLV sequences. We found that recombinant reverse-transcriptase (RT) enzymes from six companies derived from either MLV or avian myeloblastosis virus contained MLV pol DNA sequences but not gag or mouse DNA sequences.

Here, we have assessed the role played by CCL5/CCR5 interactions in the development of colon cancer. To do so, we have examined a number of human colorectal carcinoma clinical specimens and found CCL5 and its receptors over-expressed within primary as well as liver and pulmonary metastases of patients compared to healthy tissues. In vitro, CCL5 increased the growth and migratory responses of colon cancer cells from both human and mouse origins. In addition, systemic treatment of mice with CCL5-directed antibodies reduced the extent of development of subcutaneous colon tumors, of liver metastases and of peritoneal carcinosis. Consistently, we found increased numbers of CD45-immunoreactive cells within the stroma of the remaining lesions as well as at the interface with the healthy tissue. In contrast, selective targeting of CCR5 through administration of TAK-779, a CCR5 antagonist, only partially compromised colon cancer progression. Furthermore, CCL5 neutralization rendered the tumors more sensitive to a PDGFRβ-directed strategy in mice, this combination regimen offering the greatest protection against liver metastases and suppressing macroscopic peritoneal carcinosis. Collectively, our data demonstrate the involvement of CCL5 in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma and point to its potential value as a therapeutic target.""","""['Béatrice Cambien', 'Peggy Richard-Fiardo', 'Babou F Karimdjee', 'Violette Martini', 'Bernard Ferrua', 'Bruno Pitard', 'Heidy Schmid-Antomarchi', 'Annie Schmid-Alliana']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Expression of CCL5 (RANTES) and CCR5 in prostate cancer.', 'Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells promote colorectal cancer progression via CCR5.', 'Effect of CCR5 receptor antagonists on endocytosis of the human CCR5 receptor in CHO-K1 cells.', 'Inhibition of the CCL5/CCR5 Axis against the Progression of Gastric Cancer.', 'The potential to target CCL5/CCR5 in breast cancer.', 'Macrophage-Based Therapeutic Strategies in Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Derivation of CD8+ T\xa0cell infiltration potentiators in non-small-cell lung cancer through tumor microenvironment analysis.', '704/DNA vaccines leverage cytoplasmic DNA stimulation to promote anti-HIV neutralizing antibody production in mice and strong immune response against alpha-fetoprotein in non-human primates.', 'The regulatory network of the chemokine CCL5 in colorectal cancer.', 'Therapeutic Perspectives of HIV-Associated Chemokine Receptor (CCR5 and CXCR4) Antagonists in Carcinomas.']"""

Patients and methods:   The study included 98 patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Age, percentages of positive cores (P+) at transrectal ultrasound scan biopsy, biopsy Gleason score (bGS), luteinizing hormone (LH), FSH, total testosterone, free testosterone (FT) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were the continuous clinical variables. All patients had not previously received hormonal manipulations. FSH correlation and multiple linear analyses were computed in the population. The FSH/PSA ratio was computed and then ranked for clustering the population as groups A (0.13≤FSH/PSA≤0.57), B (0.57<FSH/PSA≤1.61) and C (1.61<FSH/PSA≤19.4). The model was assessed by simple linear and multiple linear regression analysis and differences between the groups were assessed by analysis of variance.  Results:   In the patient population, FSH correlated to LH (p < 0.0001), FT (p = 0.007) and age (p = 0.004). FSH was independently predicted by both LH (p < 0.0001) and PSA (p = 0.04). PSA predicted FSH/PSA A (p < 0.0001), B (p < 0.0001) and C (p = 0.04). On multiple regression analysis, FSH/PSA A was predicted by PSA (p < 0.0001), P+ (p = 0.03) and bGS (p = 0.04); FSH/PSA B by LH (p = 0.002) and PSA (p < 0.0001); FSH/PSA C by LH (p < 0.0001) and PSA (p < 0.0001). Moreover, FSH/PSA A, B and C differed for mean values of FSH (p < 0.0001), LH (p < 0.0001), PSA (p < 0.0001) and PSA/FT ratio (p < 0.0001). FSH/PSA clusters showed features of decreasing aggressive disease as the FSH/PSA ratio progressed from A to C.  Conclusion:   At the diagnosis of prostate cancer and along the pituitary-testis-prostate axis in a patient population FSH significantly correlated to LH, FT and age, and FSH was independently and significantly predicted by both LH and PSA. Because of the independent prediction of PSA by FSH, the prostate cancer population at diagnosis was clustered and ranked according to the FSH/PSA ratio in groups A, B and C. Also, the predictive model of PSA on FSH for the different groups proved to be effective at selecting potential prognostic clusters in which the risk of progression might be assessed as low (group C), intermediate (group B) and high (group A).

Through the production of H2O2, pharmacologic ascorbate can induce some cancer cell death in vitro and inhibit a number of types of tumor growth in animal models. However, the mechanism of cell death triggered by ascorbate is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of pharmacological concentrations of ascorbate to human prostate cancer cells and the mechanisms involved. The results showed that ascorbate in the millimolar range induced cytotoxicity in five of the six tested prostate cancer cell lines. The IC50 values in the sensitive prostate cancer cells ranged from 1.9 to 3.5 mmol/l, concentrations clinically achievable with i.v. ascorbate use. All tested androgen-independent cells were sensitive to ascorbate treatment. The ascorbate-insensitive cell line LaPC4 is hormonally dependent. Whereas the reasons for sensitivity/resistance to ascorbate treatment need to be investigated further, cell death in sensitive cells was dependent on H2O2. Ascorbate treatment depleted ATP and induced autophagy in sensitive prostate cancer cells, resulting in cell death. Taken together with previous studies, high-dose ascorbate has the potential to be a novel treatment option to hormone-refractory prostate cancer.""","""['Ping Chen', 'Jun Yu', 'Brain Chalmers', 'Jeanne Drisko', 'Jun Yang', 'Benyi Li', 'Qi Chen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Pancratistatin induces apoptosis and autophagy in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Effect of vitamin C on androgen independent prostate cancer cells (PC3 and Mat-Ly-Lu) in vitro: involvement of reactive oxygen species-effect on cell number, viability and DNA synthesis.', 'Sodium 5,6-benzylidene-L-ascorbate induces oxidative stress, autophagy, and growth arrest in human colon cancer HT-29 cells.', 'Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer with Pharmacological Ascorbate.', 'Cannabinoid-associated cell death mechanisms in tumor models (review).', 'Vitamin C: From nutrition to oxygen sensing and epigenetics.', 'In Vitro Cell Density Determines the Sensitivity of Hepatocarcinoma Cells to Ascorbate.', 'Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Oncology.', 'The Result of Vitamin C Treatment of Patients with Cancer: Conditions Influencing the Effectiveness.', 'High-dose intravenous vitamin C, a promising multi-targeting agent in the treatment of cancer.']"""

The objectives of this study were to estimate the total and disease-related per-patient lifetime costs using a phase-based model of cancer care for PCa patients enrolled in Medicare.  Methods:   A model was developed to estimate life-time costs for patients diagnosed with PCa. Patients ≥ 65 years old and diagnosed with PCa between calendar years 1991-2002 were selected from the SEER database. Using SEER, we estimated survival times for PCa patients from diagnosis until death. The period of time patients contributed to treatment phases was determined using an algorithm designed to model the natural history of PCa. Costs were obtained from the US SEER-Medicare database and estimated during specific phases of care. Cost estimates were then combined with survival data to yield total and PCa-related life-time costs.  Results:   Overall, the model estimated life-time costs of $110,520 (95% CI 110,324-110,739) per patient. PCa-related costs made up approximately 31% of total costs ($34,432).

Biopsies were obtained through transurethral resection, from 82 patients with prostate cancer. In order to assess the histopathological form and the Gleason score, one section from each case was stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin. Additional sections were stained with chromogranin A. We considered neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia to have a higher value than that observed in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and normal prostate (over three neuroendocrine cells÷gland). The quantification of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) has been significant; the reaction was considered to be weak (2-10% neuroendocrine cells), moderate (10-20%) and intense (over 50%). Cells positive for chromogranin A have been identified in all the cases, but a larger number than that registered in normal tissue has been noted in 59 patients (71.95%). In most of the cases, the neuroendocrine cells have been distributed in small groups among the neoplasic cells, and rarely isolated. In two cases of small cell carcinoma most of the tumoral cells have been positive for chromogranin A. In conclusion, the study of neuroendocrine differentiation in patients with prostatic carcinoma revealed hyperplasia of positive chromogranin A cells, in 71.95% of cases.

In a model of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced prostatic EMT, SLUG is the dominant regulator of EMT initiation in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the inhibition of EMT following Slug depletion. In contrast, SNAIL depletion was significantly less rate limiting. TGFβ-stimulated KLF4 degradation is required for SLUG induction. Expression of a degradation-resistant KLF4 mutant inhibited EMT, and furthermore, depletion of Klf4 was sufficient to initiate SLUG-dependent EMT. We show that KLF4 and another epithelial determinant, FOXA1, are direct transcriptional inhibitors of SLUG expression in mouse and human prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, self-reinforcing regulatory loops for SLUG-KLF4 and SLUG-FOXA1 lead to SLUG-dependent binding of polycomb repressive complexes to the Klf4 and Foxa1 promoters, silencing transcription and consolidating mesenchymal commitment.

Anteriorly located prostate cancer has traditionally been difficult to detect on digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. Multiparametric MRI has potential as a valuable tool for the diagnosis and focal treatment of prostate cancer. A significant difficulty to date has been accurate correlation between the magnetic resonance images and histopathologic specimens.  Methods:   A patient-specific mold from a preoperative T2-weighted MRI scan was created to hold and shape the prostate specimen. Slots for slicing were positioned at 6-mm increments coplanar to the axial MRI slices. After surgical excision, the specimen was inked to maintain the orientation and fixed in formalin. The seminal vesicles were excised, and the prostate was oriented in the mold such that the color-coding matched the anatomic labels on the mold. The specimen was sliced with a single blade and the resultant 6-mm tissue blocks were used for histologic analysis.  Results:   Preoperative multiparametric MRI revealed a lesion in the right anterior transition zone that was positive on T2-weighed MRI, apparent diffusion coefficient maps of diffusion-weighted MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. The histologic sections obtained using the mold demonstrated a similar Gleason score 6 (3+3) lesion in the right anterior transition zone, correlating with the MRI findings.  Conclusion:   The use of patient-specific prostate molds to register the MRI findings with the histopathologic specimen in prostate cancer could offer several benefits compared with current specimen processing techniques.

We have recently identified phospholipase 2 group VII (PLA2G7) as a potential drug target especially in ERG oncogene positive prostate cancers. Here, the expression profile of PLA2G7 was studied in 1137 prostate cancer and 409 adjacent non-malignant prostate tissues using immunohistochemistry to validate its biomarker potential and putative association with disease progression. In order to reveal the molecular alterations induced by PLA2G7 impairment, lipidomic and gene expression profiling was performed in response to PLA2G7 silencing in cultured prostate cancer cells. Moreover, the antineoplastic effect of statins combined with PLA2G7 impairment was studied in prostate cancer cells to evaluate the potential of repositioning of in vivo compatible drugs developed for other indications towards anti-cancer purposes. The results indicated that PLA2G7 is a cancer-selective biomarker in 50 % of prostate cancers and associates with aggressive disease. The alterations induced by PLA2G7 silencing highlighted the potential of PLA2G7 inhibition as an anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic and anti-migratorial therapeutic approach in prostate cancer. Moreover, the anti-proliferative effect of PLA2G7 silencing was potentiated by lipid-lowering statins in prostate cancer cells.

The concordance of diagnosis between banked sections and their mirror image paraffin- sections was studied using 50 cases corresponding to 400 H&E sections taken from 400 banked frozen blocks (two presumed benign and two presumed cancer for each case). The mean number of paraffin blocks in each case was 21. On average 29% of the prostate gland was banked and banked tissue contained cancer in 47 cases (94%). There was no difference between the concordant and discordant groups in terms of the final Gleason score, pathological stage, prostate size, number of banked blocks and the percentage of the prostate submitted for banking. However, concordant cases had larger foci of cancer in the mirror image paraffin block (P = 0.0088).

The 'alternative slices mirror image method' is a straightforward method that is highly efficient in banking prostatic cancerous tissue.

Although aberrant expression of ADAM17 has been shown in various malignancies, the function of ADAM17 in prostate cancer has not been clarified. In the present study, we sought to elucidate whether ADAM17 contributes to prostate cancer cell invasion, as well as the mechanism involved in the process. The expression pattern of ADAM17 was investigated in human prostate cancer cells. The results showed that ADAM17 expression levels are correlated with the invasive ability of androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines. Further, ADAM17 was overexpressed in cells showing high invasion characteristics, activation of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway, up-regulation of MMP-2, MMP-9, and an increased TGF-α release into the supernatant. However, AG1478, PD98059 and antibody against TGF-α deactivating the EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, abolished up-regulation of MMP-2, MMP-9 and prevented cell invasion. In addition, cells with knockdown of ADAM17 by siRNA exhibited low invasive ability, deactivated EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, reduced TGF-α released and down-regulation of MMP-2, MMP-9. However, these effects could be reversed by simultaneous addition of TGF-α. These data demonstrated that ADAM17 contributes to androgen-independent prostate cancer cell invasion by shedding of EGFR ligand TGF-α, which subsequently activates the EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, leading finally to overexpression of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
