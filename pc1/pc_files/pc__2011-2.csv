It is therefore essential to improve the existing dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) techniques commonly used for the assessment of the tumour vascular environment. The goal of this study was to describe a method for the estimation of the arterial input function (AIF) in DCE MRI by measuring R(2) * values in the femoral artery of patients with early-stage prostate cancer. The calculation of contrast agent concentrations was based on calibration curves determined in whole blood samples for a range of normal haematocrit (HCT) values (HCT = 0.35-0.525). Individual AIFs corrected for HCT were compared with individual AIFs calibrated with a mean whole blood [R(2)*-Gd-DTPA-BMA] [Gd-DTPA-BMA, gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate-bis(methylamide) (gadodiamide)] curve at an assumed HCT = 0.44, as well as a population AIF at an assumed HCT = 0.45. The area under the curve of the first-pass bolus ranged between 0.6 min mM at HCT = 0.53 and 1.3 min mM at HCT = 0.39. Significant differences in magnitude at peak contrast agent concentrations (HCT = 0.36, [Gd-DTPA-BMA](max) = 9 ± 0.4 mM; HCT = 0.46, [Gd-DTPA-BMA](max) = 4.0 ± 0.2 mM) were found. Using model-based simulations, the accuracy of the kinetic parameters estimated using individual AIFs corrected for HCT demonstrated that, for the use of individual calibration curves with HCT values differing by more than 10%, K(trans) and k(ep) values were largely underestimated (up to 60% difference for K(trans)). Moreover, blood volume estimates were severely underestimated. Estimates of kinetic parameters in early-stage prostate cancer patients demonstrated that the efflux rate constant (k(ep)) was influenced significantly by the definition of AIF. Regardless of whether an individually calibrated AIF or a population AIF (average of all individually calibrated AIFs) was used, pixel-by-pixel mapping of k(ep) and v(b) in the prostate gland appeared to be more sensitive than with the usual biexponential approach.""","""['Nathalie Just', 'Dow-Mu Koh', ""James D'Arcy"", 'David J Collins', 'Martin O Leach']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['A comparison of two methods for estimating DCE-MRI parameters via individual and cohort based AIFs in prostate cancer: a step towards practical implementation.', 'Intra-individual comparison of different gadolinium-based contrast agents in the quantitative evaluation of C6 glioma with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis of prostate cancer DCE-MRI at 3T: comparison of two arterial input functions on cancer detection with digitized whole mount histopathological validation.', 'Estimating kinetic parameters from dynamic contrast-enhanced T(1)-weighted MRI of a diffusable tracer: standardized quantities and symbols.', 'Model selection in measures of vascular parameters using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: experimental and clinical applications.', 'The arterial input function: Spatial dependence within the imaging volume and its influence on 3D quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for head and neck cancer.', 'Quantification of porcine myocardial perfusion with modified dual bolus MRI - a prospective study with a PET reference.', 'Improved repeatability of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI using the complex MRI signal to derive arterial input functions: a test-retest study in prostate cancer patients.', 'Assessment of DCE-MRI parameters for brain tumors through implementation of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model approaches for Gd-DOTA.', 'In silico evaluation of gadofosveset pharmacokinetics in different population groups using the Simcyp® simulator platform.']"""

Phase II study of tandutinib was conducted to assess the effects of a continuously administered highly potent PDGFR inhibitor in this disease state.  Methods:   Men with progressive CRPC, bone metastases, and prior taxane chemotherapy were treated with oral tandutinib 500 mg twice daily until disease progression under a two-stage design with the 8-week freedom-from-progression (FFP) rate as the primary endpoint. The trial was designed to have 87% power to reject a null FFP rate of 10% when the true rate was 33% (type I error rate = 0.02). Secondary endpoints included tumor expression of p-PDGFR, bone marker (urine N-telopeptide, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase) kinetics, in vivo monitoring of PDGFR inhibition in peripheral blood leukocytes, and correlation with survival.  Results:   Among 18 patients registered (aged 47-81, median 66 years), 15 were evaluable for efficacy. Five of 6 evaluable tumors were p-PDGFR positive. Mean urine N-telopeptide declined from 123.7 (baseline) to 41.0 (Cycle 2 Day 1) nmol/mmol Cr (P = 0.012). Probability of decrease in peripheral blood leukocyte p-PDGFR >0.5 versus <0.5 was associated with progression-free survival of 6 versus 8 weeks (P = 0.03, log-rank) and overall survival, 26.6 versus 42.9 weeks, respectively (P = 0.09, log-rank).

The possibility of utilising the increased OPN as a target to suppress the tumourigenicity was investigated in this study. Small interference RNAs against OPN were transfected into highly malignant DU145 prostate cancer cells, which express high level of OPN prior to the transfections, to establish OPN-suppressed clones. Compared with the control transfectants generated by scrambled RNA, suppressed expression of OPN significantly inhibited cell invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth. Similar results were obtained from in vivo experiments. OPN-suppressed transfectants produced significant reductions in average sizes of subcutaneous tumours after inoculation into nude mice. When the levels of OPN measured in transfectants before injection were related to tumour sizes, the reduction in tumour sizes was not propotionally related to the inhibition in OPN-levels. However, when the levels of OPN were analysed in the tumour tissues, it was found that the reduced OPN expression levels were significantly associated with the reducing tumour sizes. These results showed that changes in OPN levels had occurred after the transfectants were inoculated in mice. This study suggested while OPN can be an effective target for therapeutic suppression of prostate cancer, more effective way than RNAi is needed to inhibit OPN expression.""","""['Yu Zhang', 'Shiva S Forootan', 'Laleh Kamalian', 'Zheng Z Bao', 'Mohammed I Malki', 'Christopher S Foster', 'Youqiang Ke']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Inhibition of osteopontin suppresses in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis in endometrial cancer.', 'A short-hairpin RNA targeting osteopontin downregulates MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions in prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Lentiviral-mediated siRNA targeted against osteopontin suppresses the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cells.', 'Effects of osteopontin downregulation on the growth of prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'The role of osteopontin in the progression of solid organ tumour.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Co-culture of human fibroblasts, smooth muscle and endothelial cells promotes osteopontin induction in hypoxia.', 'Osteopontin-c mediates the upregulation of androgen responsive genes in LNCaP cells through PI3K/Akt and androgen receptor signaling.', 'The prognostic value of osteopontin expression in non-small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Role of osteopontin in the pathophysiology of cancer.']"""

Here, we exploited the experimental merits of the mouse to test the hypothesis that pathways constraining progression might be activated in indolent Pten-null mouse prostate tumours and that inactivation of such progression barriers in mice would engender a metastasis-prone condition. Comparative transcriptomic and canonical pathway analyses, followed by biochemical confirmation, of normal prostate epithelium versus poorly progressive Pten-null prostate cancers revealed robust activation of the TGFβ/BMP-SMAD4 signalling axis. The functional relevance of SMAD4 was further supported by emergence of invasive, metastatic and lethal prostate cancers with 100% penetrance upon genetic deletion of Smad4 in the Pten-null mouse prostate. Pathological and molecular analysis as well as transcriptomic knowledge-based pathway profiling of emerging tumours identified cell proliferation and invasion as two cardinal tumour biological features in the metastatic Smad4/Pten-null PCA model. Follow-on pathological and functional assessment confirmed cyclin D1 and SPP1 as key mediators of these biological processes, which together with PTEN and SMAD4, form a four-gene signature that is prognostic of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical recurrence and lethal metastasis in human PCA.

Methods:   A sample of 413 men, from 45 to 75 years old, were randomly selected for the study among those who participated in prostate cancer screening at 2 urban urology practices in Argentina and Puerto Rico. Weight, height, serum testosterone and total PSA concentration were determined. Body mass index (BMI), body surface, plasma volume, and PSA mass were calculated. Prostate volume was estimated by transrectal ultrasound using the prolate ellipsoid formula.  Results:   Mean age was 59 years old (range, 45 to 75) and mean BMI was 28.8 kg/m2 (range, 24 to 46). Mean serum PSA concentration was 1.43 ng/ml in normal weight patients (n=68), 1.4 ng/ml in overweight patients (n=222), 1.05 ng/ml in obese patients (n=114), and 0.85 ng/ml in morbidly obese patients (n=9). BMI was directly correlated with plasma volume (r= 0.687; p= 0.001) and inversely correlated with serum PSA concentration (r= -0.235; P= 0.001).

The etiology of PCa in humans is multifactorial and includes age, ethnicity, environmental factors, and other unknown causes. Epidemiological and experimental evidence has shown that cadmium is associated with PCa both in humans and rodents. This metal can act as an endocrine disruptor during prostate development, and it induces prostate lesions late in life. In this study, we investigated the effects of low-dose cadmium on rat prostate morphology during puberty. Two-month-old male Wistar rats were randomized into two experimental groups: cadmium-treated and control. The ventral and dorsolateral prostates were dissected, weighed, and immunohistochemically stained with specific antibodies against Ki-67 and the androgen receptor (AR). The concentration of cadmium was measured in the blood and prostate, and testosterone concentration was measured from the plasma. Our results show that cadmium concentration was increased in both the blood and the prostate of cadmium-treated rats, but there were no changes in the prostatic weight, epithelial cell height, or testosterone levels. However, AR immunostaining and epithelial cell proliferation (Ki-67 index) were increased in both prostates with an increase in apoptosis only in the dorsal lobe. Furthermore, atypical hyperplasic proliferative lesions were found in the dorsolateral lobe after cadmium exposure. Cadmium treatment reduced collagen fiber absolute volume in both prostates. Thus, low-doses of cadmium, even for a short period of time, can interfere with prostate epithelium-stroma homeostasis, and this disruption might be an important factor in the onset of prostate lesions late in life.""","""['Lívia M Lacorte', 'Flavia K Delella', 'Elaine M Porto Amorim', 'Luis A Justulin Jr', 'Antonio F Godinho', 'Alaor A Almeida', 'Patrícia F Felipe Pinheiro', 'Renée L Amorim', 'Sérgio L Felisbino']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Microsc Res Tech""","""['Long-term effects of perinatal exposure to low doses of cadmium on the prostate of adult male rats.', 'Long-term effects of developmental exposure to di-n-butyl-phthalate (DBP) on rat prostate: proliferative and inflammatory disorders and a possible role of androgens.', 'Minimal basal activity and lack of metal-induced activation of the metallothionein gene correlates with lobe-specific sensitivity to the carcinogenic effects of cadmium in the rat prostate.', 'Cadmium effects on the thyroid gland.', 'Cadmium and cancer of prostate and testis.', 'Association between cadmium and androgen receptor protein expression differs in prostate tumors of African American and European American men.', 'Long-term effects of perinatal exposure to low doses of cadmium on the prostate of adult male rats.', ""EDC-2: The Endocrine Society's Second Scientific Statement on Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals."", 'Sexually immature male ERE-Luc reporter mice to assess low dose estrogen-like effects of CdCl2 versus dietary Cd.', 'Chronic caffeine intake increases androgenic stimuli, epithelial cell proliferation and hyperplasia in rat ventral prostate.']"""

Propolis possesses immuno-modulatory, anti-tumour and chemopreventive properties. The tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an important endogenous anti-cancer agent that induces apoptosis selectively in tumour cells. However, some cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Naturally occurring phenolic and polyphenolic compounds sensitize TRAIL-resistant cancer cells and augment the apoptotic activity of TRAIL. The ethanolic extract of Brazilian green propolis (EEP) is rich in phenolic components. Our in vitro results indicate the potential targets in the TRAIL-induced apoptotic pathway for the cancer chemopreventive activity of Brazilian propolis. We examined the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of Brazilian EEP and its bioactive components in combination with TRAIL on LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The chemical composition of Brazilian green propolis was determined by high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection. The cytotoxicity was measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl-tetrazolium and lactate dehydrogenase assays. Apoptosis was detected using annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm) was evaluated using DePsipher staining by fluorescence microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to analyse death receptor (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) expression in LNCaP cells. The inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (p65) activation in cancer cells was confirmed by the ELISA-based TransAM NF-κB kit. The LNCaP cells were shown to be resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that EEP sensitizes TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells. The main phenolic components detected in Brazilian green propolis are artepillin C, quercetin, kaempferol and p-coumaric acid. Brazilian propolis and its bioactive components markedly augmented TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells. Brazilian EEP enhanced the expression of TRAIL-R2 and the activity of NF-κB in LNCaP cells. The co-treatment of prostate cancer cells with 100 ng/ml TRAIL and 50 µg/ml EEP increased the percentage of apoptotic cells to 65.8 ± 1.2% and caused a significant disruption of ∆Ψm in LNCaP cells. We show that Brazilian EEP helped cells overcome TRAIL resistance by engaging both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways and regulating NF-κB activity.

They were stratified for performance status, presence of bone metastases, and previous normalisation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to androgen deprivation. The study end points were the proportion of patients achieving a 50% PSA response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and quality of life. Intention-to-treat analysis was carried out. The effect of treatment was studied first by Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test, and finally through multivariable stratified Cox's proportional hazards model adjusting for the effects of possible baseline prognostic factors. Quality of life was analysed using multivariate analysis of variance.  Results:   At study entry, the median age was 76 years (inter-quartile range: 70-80 years), the median PSA was 79 ng ml(-1), and 76% of the cohort had metastatic disease. The response rates for DAiS (68%) and DAdS (64%) were not significantly different (P=0.49). Similar to the response rate, neither the PFS (median=8.1 months for both arms) nor the overall survival (19.4 vs 18.8 months) differed significantly between the DAiS and DAdS groups (P>0.20). However, the response rate for the DAiS (68%) was significantly higher than the response rate of DA (before adding Diethylstilbestrol) (50%) (P=0.002). Similarly, the median time to progression for DAiS (8.6 months) was significantly longer than that of DA (4.5 months) (P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that patients with previous haemoglobin ≥11 g dl(-1) decreased the risk of death significantly (hazard ratio: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.25-0.77). Patients treated with previous anti-androgens alone had more than 5 times more risk of death compared with patients treated with gonadorelin analogues throughout their castration-sensitive phase. Treatment sequencing did not affect the quality of life but pre-treatment performance status did. The incidence of veno-thromboembolic events was 22% (n=28) in DAiS and 11% (n=14) in the DA arm (P=0.02). Painful gynaecomastia occurred in only 1% on DA, whereas in 40% on DAiS (P=0.001).  Conclusion:   Dexamethasone and immediate Diethylstilbestrol resulted in neither higher PSA response rate nor higher PFS compared with Dexamethasone with deferred Diethylstilbestrol. There was no suggestion of significantly improved overall survival or quality of life. Given the significantly higher toxicity of Diethylstilbestrol, deferring Diethylstilbestrol until failure of Dexamethasone is the preferred strategy when using these agents in CRPC.""","""['J Shamash', 'T Powles', 'S J Sarker', 'A Protheroe', 'N Mithal', 'R Mills', 'R Beard', 'P Wilson', 'N Tranter', ""N O'Brien"", 'S McFaul', 'T Oliver']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (LATITUDE): final overall survival analysis of a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.', 'Differences in time to disease progression do not predict for cancer-specific survival in patients receiving immediate or deferred androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: final results of EORTC randomized trial 30891 with 12 years of follow-up.', 'Prostate-specific antigen response to deferred combined androgen blockade therapy using bicalutamide predicts survival after subsequent oestrogen and docetaxel therapies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The role of diethylstilbestrol in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'An exploratory first-in-man study to investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of liposomal dexamethasone at a 2- and 1-week interval in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The resurgence of estrogens in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Diethylstilbestrol in the Treatment of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Lower-middle-income Country Experience.', 'Anemia is associated with poor outcomes of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Drug Repositioning for Effective Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

Importantly, PG545 also inhibits heparanase, the only endoglycosidase which cleaves HS chains in the ECM. The aim of the study was to assess PG545 in various solid tumour and metastasis models.  Methods:   The anti-angiogenic, anti-tumour and anti-metastatic properties of PG545 were assessed using in vivo angiogenesis, solid tumour and metastasis models. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were also generated in tumour-bearing mice to gain an understanding of optimal dosing schedules and regimens.  Results:   PG545 was shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo and induce anti-tumour or anti-metastatic effects in murine models of breast, prostate, liver, lung, colon, head and neck cancers and melanoma. Enhanced anti-tumour activity was also noted when used in combination with sorafenib in a liver cancer model. PK data revealed that the half-life of PG545 was relatively long, with pharmacologically relevant concentrations of radiolabeled PG545 observed in liver tumours.

To correct for this issue, off-line re-optimization and online re-positioning have been used clinically. In this paper, we propose an adaptive images guided radiation therapy (AIGRT) scheme that combines these two correction methods in an anatomy-driven fashion. The AIGRT process first tries to find a best plan for the daily target from a plan pool, which consists of the original CT plan and all previous re-optimized plans. If successful, the selected plan is used for daily treatment with translational shifts. Otherwise, the AIGRT invokes the re-optimization process of the CT plan for the anatomy of the day, which is afterward added to the plan pool as a candidate for future fractions. The AIGRT scheme is evaluated by comparisons with daily re-optimization and online re-positioning techniques based on daily target coverage, organs at risk (OAR) sparing and implementation efficiency. Simulated treatment courses for 18 patients with re-optimization alone, re-positioning alone and AIGRT shows that AIGRT offers reliable daily target coverage that is highly comparable to daily re-optimization and significantly improves from re-positioning. AIGRT is also seen to provide improved OAR sparing compared to re-positioning. Apart from dosimetric benefits, AIGRT in addition offers an efficient scheme to integrate re-optimization to current re-positioning-based IGRT workflow.""","""['Taoran Li', 'Danthai Thongphiew', 'Xiaofeng Zhu', 'W Robert Lee', 'Zeljko Vujaskovic', 'Fang-Fang Yin', 'Q Jackie Wu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Comparison of online IGRT techniques for prostate IMRT treatment: adaptive vs repositioning correction.', 'Comparison of various online IGRT strategies: The benefits of online treatment plan re-optimization.', 'Optimization of treatment planning workflow and tumor coverage during daily adaptive magnetic resonance image guided radiation therapy (MR-IGRT) of pancreatic cancer.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy: a new dimension in radiation oncology.', 'Online daily adaptive proton therapy.', 'Predicting necessity of daily online adaptive replanning based on wavelet image features for MRI guided adaptive radiation therapy.', 'Adaptive proton therapy.', 'Prospects for daily online adaptive radiotherapy via ethos for prostate cancer patients without nodal involvement using unedited CBCT auto-segmentation.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy to the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes: A detailed dosimetric analysis of a phase II prospective trial.', 'Application of aSi-kVCBCT for Volume Assessment and Dose Estimation: An Offline Adaptive Study for Prostate Radiotherapy.']"""

Thus, identification and characterization of CSCs may be critical to defining effective anticancer therapies. In prostate cancer (PCa), the CD44(+) cell population appears to have stem cell-like properties including being tumorigenic. The enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) has been found to identify hematopoietic stem cells and our aim was to determine the utility of ALDH activity and CD44 in identifying PCa stem cell-like cells in PCa cell lines.  Materials and methods:   LNCaP cells and PC-3 cells were sorted based on their expression of CD44 and ALDH activity. The cell populations were investigated using colony-forming assays, invasion assays, sphere formation experiments in a non-adherent environment and 3-D Matrigel matrix culture to observe the in vitro stem-cell like properties. Different sorted cell populations were injected subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice to determine the corresponding tumorigenic capacities.  Results:   ALDH(hi) CD44(+) cells exhibit a higher proliferative, clonogenic and metastatic capacity in vitro and demonstrate higher tumorigenicity capacity in vivo than did ALDH(lo) CD44(-) cells. The tumors recapitulated the population of the original cell line. However, ALDHlo CD44(-) cells were able to develop tumors, albeit with longer latency periods.

Most oligos consist of a single mRNA binding site, targeting a single gene product or others sharing sequence homology. However, our lab has developed bispecifics directed towards two (including unrelated) proteins. Previously we have shown that mono- and bispecific oligos targeting BCL-2 significantly inhibit LNCaP cell growth. Employing reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction we found comparable suppression of expressed BCL-2. Computer models suggested that this activity could, in part, be enhanced by the formation of siRNA-like double-stranded regions, generated by intrastrand base pair complementarity. We hypothesize that these regions could be interferon inducers (like poly I:C) and enhance the expression of prostate specific cell surface antigens. The expression of cell surface prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and the secreted prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were candidates for evaluation. To test this theory, we evaluated the effects of mono- and bispecific oligos (with intrastrand complementarity), targeting BCL-2, upon the expression of non-targeted proteins PSMA, PSA and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in LNCaP cells. Levels of mRNA encoding PSMA were significantly elevated following treatment with the bispecific oligos (directed against both BCL-2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor) but not by the monospecific directed solely against BCL-2. Furthermore, no differences were detected in mRNA levels encoding PSA following treatment with either mono- or bispecific forms. IFN-γ expression was also significantly increased by the bispecific and not by the monospecific oligos, supporting the hypothesis of interferon induction. This suggests that prostate cells (including LNCaP) retain an endogenous interferon-based antiviral defense mechanism (similar to that found in the testes) which is induced by double stranded oligos. Enhanced expression of cell surface differentiation antigens (such as PSMA) could increase targeting by cytotoxic T-cells and potentiate prostate cancer vaccines directed against tumor-associated cell surface antigens.""","""['Marvin Rubenstein', 'Courtney M P Hollowell', 'Patrick Guinan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""In Vivo""","""['Differentiated prostatic antigen expression in LNCaP cells following treatment with bispecific antisense oligonucleotides directed against BCL-2 and EGFR.', 'Increased prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in LNCaP cells following treatment with bispecific antisense oligonucleotides directed against bcl-2 and EGFR.', 'Bispecific antisense oligonucleotides have activity comparable to monospecifics in inhibiting expression of BCL-2 in LNCaP cells.', 'Updated application of prostate-specific membrane antigen to the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Insight into the heterogeneity of prostate cancer through PSA-PSMA prostate clones: mechanisms and consequences.', 'Oligonucleotide suppression of bcl-2 in LNCaP cells is compensated by increased androgen sensitivity, p53 and oncogene activity, and suppressed caspase-3.', 'In LNCaP cells enhanced expression of both androgen receptor and costimulatory protein p300 compensate for antisense oligonucleotide suppression of bcl-2.', 'Compensatory and non-compensatory effects on protein expression following BCL-2 suppression by antisense oligonucleotides.']"""

We hypothesized that, in addition to synthesis, cancer cells may obtain preformed, diet-derived FA by uptake from the bloodstream. This would require hydrolytic release of FA from triglyceride in circulating lipoprotein particles by the secreted enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and the expression of CD36, the channel for cellular FA uptake. We find that selected breast cancer and sarcoma cells express and secrete active LPL, and all express CD36. We further show that LPL, in the presence of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, accelerates the growth of these cells. Providing LPL to prostate cancer cells, which express low levels of the enzyme, did not augment growth, but did prevent the cytotoxic effect of FA synthesis inhibition. Moreover, LPL knockdown inhibited HeLa cell growth. In contrast to the cell lines, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of LPL and CD36 in the majority of breast, liposarcoma, and prostate tumor tissues examined (n = 181). These findings suggest that, in addition to de novo lipogenesis, cancer cells can use LPL and CD36 to acquire FA from the circulation by lipolysis, and this can fuel their growth.

By using a novel thiazolidinedione-derived ERMA, CG-12 (Wei, S., Kulp, S. K., and Chen, C. S. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 9780-9791), vis-à-vis 2-deoxyglucose and glucose deprivation, we obtain evidence that epigenetic activation of the tumor suppressor gene Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) plays a role in ERMA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. KLF6 regulates the expression of many proapoptotic genes, and shRNA-mediated KLF6 knockdown abrogated the ability of ERMAs to induce apoptosis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicates that this KLF6 transcriptional activation was associated with increased histone H3 acetylation and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation occupancy at the promoter region. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the enhancing effect of ERMAs on these active histone marks was mediated through transcriptional repression of histone deacetylases and H3 lysine 4 demethylases by down-regulating Sp1 expression. First, putative Sp1-binding elements are present in the promoters of the affected histone-modifying enzymes, and luciferase reporter assays indicate that site-directed mutagenesis of these Sp1 binding sites significantly diminished the promoter activities. Second, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Sp1 mimicked the repressive effect of energy restriction on these histone-modifying enzymes. Third, ectopic Sp1 expression protected cells from the repressive effect of CG-12 on these histone-modifying enzymes, thereby abolishing the activation of KLF6 expression.

We found that PCa cell rolling capacity is mediated by E-selectin and can be enhanced by stromal cell-derived factor-1 under different wall shear stresses. Using this device, we tested if the chemopreventive agent, vitamin D, could interfere with PCa cell adhesion. We found that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-VD), the bioactive form of vitamin D, reduced PCa cell rolling numbers and increased rolling velocities resulting in a significant decreased number of PCa cells adhering to the microtube. The inhibitory effects of 1,25-VD on PCa cell heterotypic adhesion were further confirmed using microvascular endothelial cells in a static condition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 1,25-VD can increase E-cadherin expression in PCa cells and promote the homotypic cell-cell aggregation, which can then hinder PCa cell adhesion to the endothelium. Blocking E-cadherin with a neutralizing antibody can reverse 1,25-VD-mediated suppression of PCa cell adhesion to the endothelium. Taken together, our data revealed that 1,25-VD promoted PCa cell aggregation by increasing E-cadherin expression, thus interfering with circulating PCa cell adhesion to microvascular endothelial cells and potentially reducing their metastatic potential.""","""['Jong-Wei Hsu', 'Sayeda Yasmin-Karim', 'Michael R King', 'Joel C Wojciechowski', 'Deanne Mickelsen', 'Martha L Blair', 'Huei-Ju Ting', 'Wen-Lung Ma', 'Yi-Fen Lee']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Circulating tumor cells from prostate cancer patients interact with E-selectin under physiologic blood flow.', 'E-selectin ligand-1 controls circulating prostate cancer cell rolling/adhesion and metastasis.', 'Analysis of glycosyltransferase expression in metastatic prostate cancer cells capable of rolling activity on microvascular endothelial (E)-selectin.', 'Glycomechanics of the metastatic cascade: tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions in the circulation.', 'The metastatic cascade in prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin D and Cancer: An Historical Overview of the Epidemiology and Mechanisms.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Is Vitamin D Deficiency Related to Increased Cancer Risk in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus?', 'Association Between Vitamin D Exposure and Head and Neck Cancer: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis.', 'The role of vitamin D in head and neck cancer.']"""

However, health professionals often fail to detect distress in their patients due to time constraints and a lack of experience. Also, with the focus on the patient, carer needs are often overlooked. This study investigated the acceptability of brief distress screening with the Distress Thermometer (DT) and Problem List (PL) to operators of a community-based telephone helpline, as well as to cancer patients and carers calling the service.  Methods:   Operators (n = 18) monitored usage of the DT and PL with callers (cancer patients/carers, >18 years, and English-speaking) from September-December 2006 (n = 666). The DT is a single item, 11-point scale to rate level of distress. The associated PL identifies the cause of distress.  Results:   The DT and PL were used on 90% of eligible callers, most providing valid responses. Benefits included having an objective, structured and consistent means for distress screening and triage to supportive care services. Reported challenges included apparent inappropriateness of the tools due to the nature of the call or level of caller distress, the DT numeric scale, and the level of operator training.  Conclusions:   We observed positive outcomes to using the DT and PL, although operators reported some challenges. Overcoming these challenges may improve distress screening particularly by less experienced clinicians, and further development of the PL items and DT scale may assist with administration. The DT and PL allow clinicians to direct/prioritise interventions or referrals, although ongoing training and support is critical in distress screening.""","""['Karen L Hughes', 'Hilary Sargeant', 'Anna L Hawkes']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Feasibility of brief psychological distress screening by a community-based telephone helpline for cancer patients and carers.', 'Use of the Distress Thermometer in a cancer helpline context: Can it detect changes in distress, is it acceptable to nurses and callers, and do high scores lead to internal referrals?', 'Brief psychological distress screening on a cancer helpline: How nurses introduce, and callers respond to, the Distress Thermometer.', 'Short screening tools for cancer-related distress: a review and diagnostic validity meta-analysis.', 'A systematic review of the translation and validation methods used for the national comprehensive cancer network distress thermometer in non-English speaking countries.', ""Evaluating How Mental Health Changed in Australia through the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from the 'Taking the Pulse of the Nation' (TTPN) Survey."", 'Prevalence of distress and its associated factors among caregivers of people diagnosed with cancer: A cross-sectional study.', 'Mapping the nature of distress raised by patients with high-grade glioma and their family caregivers: a descriptive longitudinal study.', 'Distress screening and supportive care referrals used by telephone-based health services: a systematic review.', 'I-CoPE: A pilot study of structured supportive care delivery to people with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma and their carers.']"""

One of the determinants of the PDT effect is the penetration of light in the prostate. This study assesses the penetration depth of 763 nm light throughout the prostate. Eight men undergoing multiple hollow needle insertion for high dose rate brachytherapy were recruited. 763 nm light, produced by a diode laser, was delivered to the prostate using cylindrically diffusing optical fibers within the plastic needles. Light was detected at different distances from the source, using an isotropic detector within nearby needles. Penetration depth was calculated using the Boltzmann approximation to the diffusion equation. Delivery detector fiber separation was measured on computed tomography.

Material/methods:   177 patients after RP due to prostate cancer were included in the study. On the basis of formulas, PSA mass was calculated {PSA mass [µg] = (weight [kg])0.425 × (height [cm])0.72 × 0.007184 × 1.670 × PSA concentration [ng/ml]}. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to increasing values of PSA mass. The following features were assessed and compared between these groups (χ-square test): pathologic stage T3, nodal metastases, positive surgical margins, biochemical and local recurrence and the rate of death. Cancer-specific survival was assessed depending on PSA mass (Kaplan-Meier curves with log rank test). The usefulness of PSA mass in prediction of biochemical recurrence was compared with PSA concentration (logistic regression with ROC curves).  Results:   Pathologic stage T3, nodal metastases, positive surgical margins and progression were more common in patients with higher levels of PSA mass (p<0.01). Cancer-specific survival was significantly shorter in patients with elevated values of PSA mass (p=0.02).

Methods:   To address this gap, the authors compared self-reported condom malfunctions (i.e., breakage and slippage) and incorrect condom practices to 2 following objective measures of failure: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) detected in vaginal swabs collected after condom use and structural integrity of used condoms. The study, conducted in 2000-2001, evaluated 635 male condoms used by 77 women attending an outpatient, reproductive-health clinic in Birmingham, AL.  Results:   Women reported breakage or slippage for 7.9% of condoms; 3.5% of postcoital swabs had moderate or high levels of PSA; and laboratory testing of used condoms revealed breaks (1.1%) and leaks (2.0%).

Chinese red yeast rice (RYR), a food herb made by fermenting Monascus purpureus Went yeast on white rice, contains a mixture of eight different monacolins that inhibit cholesterogenesis in addition to red pigments with antioxidant properties. Monacolin K is identical to lovastatin (LV), but LV unlike RYR can be used in individuals intolerant to statins due to muscle pain. Both LV and RYR inhibit de novo cholesterogenesis, which is critical to the growth of tumor cells. Long-term use of statin drugs has been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. We have previously shown that RYR inhibited androgen-dependent and androgen receptor-overexpressing androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro. This study was designed to determine whether RYR and LV inhibit prostate tumor growth in SCID mice. RYR significantly reduced tumor volumes of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate xenograft tumors compared with animals receiving vehicle alone (P < 0.05). Inhibition by RYR was greater than that observed with LV at the dose found in RYR, showing that other compounds in RYR contributed to the antiproliferative effect. There was a significant correlation of tumor volume to serum cholesterol (P < 0.001). RYR decreased gene expression of androgen synthesizing enzymes (HSD3B2, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1) in both type of tumors (P < 0.05).

However, no transcriptional regulators for the LATS2 gene have been identified. Here we report that spontaneous mutation of the transcription factor FOXP3 reduces expression of the LATS2 gene in mammary epithelial cells. shRNA-mediated silencing of FOXP3 in normal or malignant mammary epithelial cells of mouse and human origin repressed LATS2 expression and increased YAP protein levels. LATS2 induction required binding of FOXP3 to a specific sequence in the LATS2 promoter, and this interaction contributed to FOXP3-mediated growth inhibition of tumor cells. In support of these results, reduced expression and somatic mutations of FOXP3 correlated strongly with defective LATS2 expression in microdissected prostate cancer tissues. Thus, defective expression of LATS2 is attributable to FOXP3 defects and may be a major independent determinant of YAP protein elevation in cancer.

Approximately 1.25% of monolayer DU145 cells formed spheres in SFM and 26% of sphere cells formed secondary spheres. Spheres are enriched for cells expressing prostate basal and luminal cytokeratins (34βE12 and CK18) and for cancer stem cell markers, including CD44, CD24, and integrin α2β1. Upon culturing spheres under differentiating media conditions in the presence of 10% serum, cells positive for CD44 and CD24 were substantially reduced. Furthermore, spheres could be generated from the sphere-derived adherent cell cultures and xenograft tumors, demonstrating the stemness of DU145 spheres. We have maintained spheres for more than 30 passages within 1.5years without noticeable loss of their ""stemness"". Sphere cells possess self-renewal capacity, display significant increases in proliferation potential, and initiate xenograft tumors with enhanced capacity compared to monolayer DU145 cells. While EGF promoted the generation and maintenance of these stem-like cells, bFGF inhibited these events. Sphere cells proliferate slowly with a significant reduction in the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway compared to monolayer DU145 cells. While knockdown of PTEN enhanced AKT activation, this did not affect the generation of primary spheres and the propagation of secondary spheres.

Materials and methods:   To test the hypothesis, two different prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP (androgen dependent) and PC-3 (androgen independent) were taken. Cells were exposed to various concentrations of ethanolic neem leaf extract (ENLE) (25-125 μg/ml). The doses were fixed by cell viability (MTT) assay. For apoptotic detection in situ apoptosis assay, caspase-3 activity and protein expression of cytochrome c and Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase (PARP) were analysed as well as mRNA expression of Bcl-2 family proteins was studied by RT-PCR. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and p-Akt were analysed by western blotting and mRNA expression of Akt 1 and 2, PTEN was performed by RT-PCR. Immunoblotting of cyclin D1 and p21 was done to access the inhibition of cell proliferation.  Results:   ENLE gives 50% inhibition at a dose of 100 μg/ml in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells and considered as effective dose. ENLE decreased the protein expression of PI3K as well as p-Akt and the mRNA expression of Akt 1and 2 in both the cells. There was a significant decrease in mRNA expression of PTEN in LNCaP cells. ENLE induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation by inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway. Decrease in p-Akt leads to increase in the protein level of Bad, p21 and decrease in the cyclin D1, respectively. ENLE treatment increased the cytochrome c expression and caspase-3 activity as well as regulated the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 family proteins thereby inducing apoptosis to both the cell lines. In situ apoptosis assay showed increased red fluorescence in 100 μg/ml of ENLE in both PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines.  Conclusions:   The results suggested that ENLE induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation through inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells.""","""['Dharmalingam N Gunadharini', 'Perumal Elumalai', 'Ramachandran Arunkumar', 'Kalimuthu Senthilkumar', 'Jagadeesan Arunakaran']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Ethnopharmacol""","""['Anticancer effects of ethanolic neem leaf extract on prostate cancer cell line (PC-3).', 'Tirucallic acids are novel pleckstrin homology domain-dependent Akt inhibitors inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'PI3 kinase integrates Akt and MAP kinase signaling pathways in the regulation of prostate cancer.', 'Neem leaf extract induces radiosensitization in human neuroblastoma xenograft through modulation of apoptotic pathway.', 'PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors.', 'Exploring the therapeutic potential of Neem (Azadirachta Indica) for the treatment of prostate cancer: a literature review.', 'The Highly Pure Neem Leaf Extract, SCNE, Inhibits Tumorigenesis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma via Disruption of Pro-tumor Inflammatory Cytokines and Cell Signaling.', 'Nimbolide Represses the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Bladder Carcinoma Cells via Chk2-Mediated G2/M Phase Cell Cycle Arrest, Altered Signaling Pathways, and Reduced Transcription Factors-Associated MMP-9 Expression.', 'The Akt pathway in oncology therapy and beyond (Review).', 'Therapeutics Role of Azadirachta indica (Neem) and Their Active Constituents in Diseases Prevention and Treatment.']"""

Methods and materials:   Cell survival was determined by clonogenic assay in human prostate cancer (DU145) and primary fibroblast (AGO1552) cells following exposure to different field configurations delivered using a 6-MV photon beam produced with a Varian linear accelerator.  Results:   Nonuniform dose distributions were delivered using a multileaf collimator (MLC) in which half of the cell population was shielded. Clonogenic survival in the shielded region was significantly lower than that predicted from the linear quadratic model. In both cell lines, the out-of-field responses appeared to saturate at 40%-50% survival at a scattered dose of 0.70 Gy in DU-145 cells and 0.24 Gy in AGO1522 cells. There was an approximately eightfold difference in the initial slopes of the out-of-field response compared with the α-component of the uniform field response. In contrast, cells in the exposed part of the field showed increased survival. These observations were abrogated by direct physical inhibition of cellular communication and by the addition of the inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor aminoguanidine known to inhibit intercellular bystander effects. Additional studies showed the proportion of cells irradiated and dose delivered to the shielded and exposed regions of the field to impact on response.  Conclusions:   These data demonstrate out-of-field effects as important determinants of cell survival following exposure to modulated irradiation fields with cellular communication between differentially irradiated cell populations playing an important role. Validation of these observations in additional cell models may facilitate the refinement of existing radiobiological models and the observations considered important determinants of cell survival.""","""['Karl T Butterworth', 'Conor K McGarry', 'Colman Trainor', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Alan R Hounsell', 'Kevin M Prise']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['A computational model of cellular response to modulated radiation fields.', 'DNA damage responses following exposure to modulated radiation fields.', 'In-vitro investigation of out-of-field cell survival following the delivery of conformal, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans.', 'Dose, dose-rate and field size effects on cell survival following exposure to non-uniform radiation fields.', 'Cell survival responses after exposure to modulated radiation fields.', 'Novel unconventional radiotherapy techniques: Current status and future perspectives - Report from the 2nd international radiation oncology online seminar.', 'The intercellular communications mediating radiation-induced bystander effects and their relevance to environmental, occupational, and therapeutic exposures.', 'No Intercellular Regulation of the Cell Cycle among Human Cervical Carcinoma HeLa Cells Expressing Fluorescent Ubiquitination-Based Cell-Cycle Indicators in Modulated Radiation Fields.', 'Targeted and Non-Targeted Mechanisms for Killing Hypoxic Tumour Cells-Are There New Avenues for Treatment?', 'The Roles of HIF-1α in Radiosensitivity and Radiation-Induced Bystander Effects Under Hypoxia.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between May 2007 and December 2009, 34 consecutive patients/38 lesions were treated (15 patients reirradiated for local recurrence [P], 4 patients reirradiated for anastomosis recurrence [A], 16 patients treated for single lymph node recurrence [LN], and 3 patients treated for single metastasis [M]). In all but 4 patients, [(11)C]choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed. CBK-SRT consisted of reirradiation and first radiotherapy in 27 and 11 lesions, respectively. The median CBK-SRT dose was 30 Gy in 4.5 fractions (P, 30 Gy in 5 fractions; A, 30 Gy in 5 fractions; LN, 33 Gy in 3 fractions; and M, 36 Gy in 3 fractions). In 18 patients (21 lesions) androgen deprivation was added to CBK-SRT (median duration, 16.6 months).  Results:   The median follow-up was 16.9 months. Acute toxicity included urinary events (3 Grade 1, 2 Grade 2, and 2 Grade 3 events) and rectal events (1 Grade 1 event). Late toxicity included urinary events (3 Grade 1, 2 Grade 2, and 2 Grade 3 events) and rectal events (1 Grade 1 event and 1 Grade 2 event). Biochemical response was observed in 32 of 38 evaluable lesions. Prostate-specific antigen stabilization was seen for 4 lesions, and in 2 cases prostate-specific antigen progression was reported. The 30-month progression-free survival rate was 42.6%. Disease progression was observed for 14 lesions (5, 2, 5, and 2 in Groups P, A, LN, and M respectively). In only 3 cases, in-field progression was seen. At the time of analysis (May 2010), 19 patients are alive with no evidence of disease and 15 are alive with disease.  Conclusions:   CyberKnife-based stereotactic radiotherapy is a feasible approach for isolated recurrent primary, lymph node, or metastatic prostate cancer, offering excellent in-field tumor control and a low toxicity profile.

Results:   A total of 358 patients treated between 1994 and 2007 were included in the analysis (46.9% with WPRT and 53.1% with PORT). The median duration of ADT was 24 months (range, 12-38). With a median follow-up of 52 months (range, 20-150), the overall 4-year bDFS rate was 90.5%.

Methods and materials:   H6CAHA was assessed for in vitro solubility, lipophilicity and growth inhibition, and in vivo plasma pharmacokinetics. The effect of H6CAHA on radiation clonogenic survival and DNA damage repair was evaluated in human prostate cancer (PC3, DU145, LNCaP) and nonmalignant control epithelial (RWPE1 and 267B1) cell lines. The effect of this agent on the growth of prostate cancer xenografts was also assessed in mice.  Results:   H6CAHA demonstrated good solubility and permeability profiles and preferentially inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells over nonmalignant cells. Plasma pharmacokinetics revealed that the area under the curve of H6CAHA was 8.08 ± 0.91 μM × h, and its half-life was 11.17 ± 0.87 h. Radiation clonogenic assays revealed that H6CAHA decreased the survival of prostate cancer cells at the dose that exerted limited effect on normal cells. Concomitantly, delayed DNA damage repair following combination treatment was evident in cancer cells, indicated by the prolonged appearance of γH2AX and Rad51 foci and suppression of DNA damage repair genes (ATM, BRCA1, and BRCA2). Combined modality of H6CAHA (daily intraperitoneal injections for 10 days) with γ-radiation (10 × 2 Gy) completely blocked the growth of PC3 tumor xenografts (p < 0.001) over 60 days.

Methods and materials:   A retrospective study of 42 IMRT plans demonstrated a correlation between the fraction of organs at risk (OARs) overlapping the planning target volume and the mean dose. This yielded a model, predicted dose = prescription dose (0.2 + 0.8 [1 - exp(-3 overlapping planning target volume/volume of OAR)]), that predicted the achievable mean doses according to the planning target volume overlap/volume of OAR and the prescription dose. The model was incorporated into the planning process by way of a user-executable script that reported the predicted dose for any OAR. The script was introduced to clinicians engaged in IMRT planning and deployed thereafter. The script's effect was evaluated by tracking δ = (mean dose-predicted dose)/predicted dose, the fraction by which the mean dose exceeded the model.  Results:   All OARs under investigation (rectum and bladder in prostate cancer; parotid glands, esophagus, and larynx in head-and-neck cancer) exhibited both smaller δ and reduced variability after script implementation. These effects were substantial for the parotid glands, for which the previous δ = 0.28 ± 0.24 was reduced to δ = 0.13 ± 0.10. The clinical relevance was most evident in the subset of cases in which the parotid glands were potentially salvageable (predicted dose <30 Gy). Before script implementation, an average of 30.1 Gy was delivered to the salvageable cases, with an average predicted dose of 20.3 Gy. After implementation, an average of 18.7 Gy was delivered to salvageable cases, with an average predicted dose of 17.2 Gy. In the prostate cases, the rectum model excess was reduced from δ = 0.28 ± 0.20 to δ = 0.07 ± 0.15.

It has been reported that proteasome inhibitors could induce cancer cell death through ER-stress. Our study, however, showed a differential mechanism of proteasome inhibitor-I (Pro-I)-induced cell death. Pro-I significantly enhanced apoptotic death of PC3 prostate cancer cells pretreated with tunicamycin (TM) while other signaling inhibitors against p38, mitogen activated kinase (MEK) and phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) did not, as evidenced by cell proliferation and cell cycle analyses. NF-κB inhibition by Pro-I, without direct effect on ER-stress, was found to be responsible for the TM-induced chemosensitization of PC3 cells. Moreover, TM-induced/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) expression was enhanced by Pro-I without change in GRP78 expression.

Despite similar prognoses, patients with cancer often are treated differently than those with other illnesses, the former being seen as terminal vs. chronic.  Objectives:   The purpose of this study was to compare the functional capacity, emotional well-being, and quality of life of patients in three disease groups to assess whether diagnosis distinguishes differences in patient experience, and compare patients with cancer and noncancer diagnoses.  Methods:   Baseline data from a cohort study of 210 patients who had an estimated 50% two-year mortality were analyzed. The patients had Stage IV breast, prostate, or colon cancer; Stage IIIb or IV lung cancer; New York Heart Association Stage III or IV CHF with a left ventricular ejection fraction of <40%; or COPD with hypercapnea (pC02>46) and at least one hospitalization or Emergency Department visit during the past year. Measures included the Rosow-Breslau Activities of Daily Living/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living tool, Profile of Mood States anxiety subscale, brief Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General quality-of-life instrument. Analyses included descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and adjusted linear regression models.  Results:   A majority of illness outcomes did not differ by diagnostic category. Functional status was associated with diagnosis, with CHF and COPD patients faring worse than those with cancer. Overall, illness experience was most significantly related to disease severity, demographics, and emotional and social well-being.  Conclusion:   Comparing patients with advanced cancer, CHF, and COPD, illness experience was more similar than different.

We previously reported that the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a novel oncolytic virus against androgen-independent PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. The present study extends the result to androgen-dependent prostate cancer, and explores the underlying mechanism that triggers RSV-induced oncolysis of prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The oncolytic effect of RSV on androgen-sensitive LNCaP human prostate cancer cells and on androgen-independent RM1 murine prostate cancer cells was studied in vitro in culture and in vivo in a xenograft or allograft tumor model. In vitro, cell viability, infectivity and apoptosis were monitored by MTT assay, viral plaque assay and annexin V staining, respectively. In vivo studies involved virus administration to prostate tumors grown in immune compromised nude mice and in syngeneic immune competent C57BL/6J mice. Anti-tumorogenic oncolytic activity was monitored by measuring tumor volume, imaging bioluminescent tumors in live animals and performing histopathological analysis and TUNEL assay with tumors  Results:   We show that RSV imposes a potent oncolytic effect on LNCaP prostate cancer cells. RSV infectivity was markedly higher in LNCaP cells compared to the non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 human prostate cells. The enhanced viral burden led to LNCaP cell apoptosis and growth inhibition of LNCaP xenograft tumors in nude mice. A functional host immune response did not interfere with RSV-induced oncolysis, since growth of xenograft tumors in syngeneic C57BL/6J mice from murine RM1 cells was inhibited upon RSV administration. LNCaP cells failed to activate the type-I interferon (IFNα/β)-induced transcription factor STAT-1, which is required for antiviral gene expression, although these cells could produce IFN in response to RSV infection. The essential role of IFN in restricting infection was further borne out by our finding that neutralizing IFN activity resulted in enhanced RSV infection in non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 prostate cells.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated that RSV is potentially a useful therapeutic tool in the treatment of androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent prostate cancer. Moreover, impaired IFN-mediated antiviral response is the likely cause of higher viral burden and resulting oncolysis of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells.""","""['Ibtissam Echchgadda', 'Te-Hung Chang', 'Ahmed Sabbah', 'Imad Bakri', 'Yuji Ikeno', 'Gene B Hubbard', 'Bandana Chatterjee', 'Santanu Bose']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Anticancer oncolytic activity of respiratory syncytial virus.', 'Changes in Susceptibility to Oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Virus during Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Curcumin promotes the oncoltyic capacity of vesicular stomatitis virus for the treatment of prostate cancers.', 'Oncolytic Virus as a Novel Modality for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'The gamble between oncolytic virus therapy and IFN.', 'Prostate cancer addiction to oxidative stress defines sensitivity to anti-tumor neutrophils.', 'Host Sex Steroids Interact With Virus Infection: New Insights Into Sex Disparity in Infectious Diseases.', 'NF-κB Signaling in Targeting Tumor Cells by Oncolytic Viruses-Therapeutic Perspectives.', 'Defects in interferon pathways as potential biomarkers of sensitivity to oncolytic viruses.', 'Interleukin-6 and Interferon-α Signaling via JAK1-STAT Differentially Regulate Oncolytic versus Cytoprotective Antiviral States.']"""

Application of high-resolution array-CGH using the 244k Agilent microarrays to cell lines with 10q22 amplification allowed us to narrow down the common amplified region to a region of 5.8 megabases.

We selected genes with a significant growth reduction in the 10q22 amplified cell line PC-3, but not in the non-amplified 22Rv1 cells, as putative target genes of this amplicon. Immunohistochemical analysis of the protein expression of these candidate genes on a tissue microarray enriched for 10q22 amplified prostate cancers revealed vinculin as the most promising target of this amplicon. We found a strong association between vinculin gene amplification and overexpression (p < 0.001). Further analysis of 443 specimens from across all stages of prostate cancer progression showed that vinculin expression was highest in castration-resistant prostate cancers, but negative or very low in benign prostatic hyperplasia (p < 0.0001). Additionally, high tumour cell proliferation measured by Ki67 expression was significantly associated with high vinculin expression in prostate cancer (p < 0.0001).

To further evaluate this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of a specific mPTP inhibitor (cyclosporine A) on the toxic action of 7-xylosyl-10-deacetylpaclitaxel. The 7-xylosyl-10-deacetylpaclitaxel-induced decrease in mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) was abolished by the addition of cyclosporine A (CsA) in PC-3 cells, indicating that 7-xylosyl-10-deacetylpaclitaxel may target mPTP.

However, the underlying regulatory and functional networks of known genes controlling autophagy and lysosomal function and their role in disease are relatively unexplored. We performed a systems biology-based integrative computational analysis to study the interactions between molecular components and to develop models for regulation and function of genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal function. Specifically, we analyzed transcriptional and microRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation of these genes and performed functional enrichment analyses to understand their involvement in nervous system-related diseases and phenotypes. Transcriptional regulatory network analysis showed that binding sites for transcription factors, SREBP1, USF, AP-1 and NFE2, are common among autophagy and lysosomal genes. MicroRNA enrichment analysis revealed miR-130, 98, 124, 204 and 142 as the putative post-transcriptional regulators of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway genes. Pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the mTOR and insulin signaling pathways are important in the regulation of genes involved in autophagy. In addition, we found that glycosaminoglycan and glycosphingolipid pathways also make a major contribution to lysosomal gene regulation. The analysis confirmed the known contribution of the autophagy-lysosomal genes to Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases and also revealed potential involvement in tuberous sclerosis, neuronal ceroidlipofuscinoses, sepsis and lung, liver and prostatic neoplasms. To further probe the impact of autophagy-lysosomal gene deficits on neurologically-linked phenotypes, we also mined the mouse knockout phenotype data for the autophagylysosomal genes and found them to be highly predictive of nervous system dysfunction.

A statistically significant difference was observed in pre-HIFU median PSA (2 vs. 5.45 ng/ml, respectively, P = 0.013) and Gleason score of the RP specimen (P = 0.01) between the success and failure group.  Conclusions:   Salvage first-line HIFU for palpable, TRUS-evidenced, biopsy-proven local recurrence of CaP is a feasible, minimally invasive day-case procedure, with an acceptable morbidity profile. It seems to have a good cancer control in the short- and mid-term. Patients with lower pre-HIFU PSA level and favorable pathologic Gleason score presented better oncologic outcomes.

Objective:   Our aim was to assess prospectively the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the LN staging by (11)C-choline positron emission tomography (PET)-CT and MR diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the pelvis before retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) with extended pelvic LN dissection (PLND).  Design, setting, and participants:   From February 2008 to August 2009, 36 patients with histologically proven PCa and no pelvic LN involvement on contrast-enhanced CT with a risk ≥ 10% but ≤ 35% at LN metastasis according to the Partin tables were enrolled in this study.  Intervention:   Patients preoperatively underwent (11)C-choline PET-CT and DWI. Subsequently all patients underwent a wide RRP and an extended PLND.  Measurements:   Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) for LN status of (11)C-choline PET-CT and DWI were calculated with the final histopathology of the LNs as comparator.  Results and limitations:   Seventeen patients (47%) had a pN1 stage, and 38 positive LNs were identified. On a LN region-based analysis, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and the number of correctly recognised cases at (11)C-choline PET-CT were 9.4%, 99.7%, 75.0%, 91.0%, and 7.9%, respectively, and at DWI these numbers were 18.8%, 97.6%, 46.2%, 91.7%, and 15.8%, respectively. Twelve LN regions containing macrometastases, of which 2 had capsular penetration, were not detected by (11)C-choline PET-CT; 11 LNs, of which 2 had capsular penetration, were not detected by DWI. This is a small study with 36 patients, but we intend to recruit more patients.

However, these reports are inconsistent regarding the magnitude of that association and its independence from other predictors. Moreover, cytoplasmic translocation of p27 has been proposed as a negative prognostic sign. Given the cost and accuracy limitations of manual scoring, particularly of tissue microarrays, we determined if laser-based fluorescence microscopy could provide automated analysis of p27 in both nuclear and cytoplasmic locations and, thus, clarify its significance as a prognostic biomarker. We constructed tissue microarrays covering 202 recurrent cases (rising prostate-specific antigen) and 202 matched controls without recurrence. Quadruplicate tumor samples encompassed 5 slides and 1616 cancer histospots. Cases and controls matched on age, Gleason grade, stage, and hospital. We immunolabeled epithelial cytoplasm with Alexafluor 647, p27 with Alexafluor 488, and nuclei with 4c6-diamidino-2-phenylindole·2HCl. Slides were scanned on an iCys laser scanning cytometer (CompuCyte Corp, Cambridge, MA). Nuclear crowding required a stereological approach--random arrays of circles (phantoms) were layered on images and the content of each phantom was analyzed in scatter plots. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic p27 were significantly lower in cases versus controls (P = .014 and P = .004, respectively). Regression models controlling for matching variables plus prostate-specific antigen showed strong linear trends for increased risk of recurrence with lower p27 in both nucleus and cytoplasm (highest versus lowest quartile; odds ratio, 0.35; P = .006). Manual scoring identified an inverse association between p27 expression and tumor grade but no independent association with recurrence. In conclusion, we developed an automated method for subcellular scoring of p27 without the need to segment individual cells. Our method identified a strong relationship, independent of tumor grade, stage, and prostate-specific antigen, between p27 expression--regardless of subcellular location--and prostate cancer recurrence.

This study reports the pharmacokinetics of phenoxodiol in patients with cancer.  Methods:   The pharmacokinetics of phenoxodiol was studied following a single intravenous (iv) bolus dose and during a continuous intravenous infusion. Three men with prostate cancer and 3 women with breast cancer received IV bolus phenoxodiol (5 mg/kg) and plasma was sampled for free and total phenoxodiol levels. On a separate occasion 5 of the same patients received a continuous intravenous infusion of phenoxodiol (2 mg/kg/h) and plasma was again sampled for free and total phenoxodiol levels. Phenoxodiol was measured using gradient HPLC with ultraviolet detection.  Results:   Following bolus injection, free and total phenoxodiol appeared to follow first order pharmacokinetics. The elimination half-lives for free and total phenoxodiol were 0.67 ± 0.53 h and 3.19 ± 1.93 h, respectively, while the total plasma clearance rates were 2.48 ± 2.33 L/h and 0.15 ± 0.08 L/h, respectively. The respective apparent volumes of distribution were 1.55 ± 0.69 L/kg and 0.64 ± 0.51 L/kg. During continuous intravenous infusion, free phenoxodiol accumulated rapidly to reach a mean concentration at steady state of 0.79 ± 0.14 μg/ml after 0.87 ± 0.18 h. The apparent accumulation half-life of free phenoxodiol was 0.17 ± 0.04 h while the plasma clearance during continuous infusion was 1.29 ± 0.23 L/h.

Whether prostate cancer (PCa) - an important health issue in the aging male population in the Western world - belongs to these conditions has been a matter of research since the 1970 s. Persistent serum antibodies are a proof of present or past infection. The aim of this study was to compare serum antibodies against genitourinary infectious agents between PCa patients and controls with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). We hypothesized that elevated serum antibody levels or higher seroprevalence in PCa patients would suggest an association of genitourinary infection in patient history and elevated PCa risk.  Methods:   A total of 434 males who had undergone open prostate surgery in a single institution were included in the study: 329 PCa patients and 105 controls with BPH. The subjects' serum samples were analysed by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, complement fixation test and indirect immunofluorescence for the presence of antibodies against common genitourinary infectious agents: human papillomavirus (HPV) 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus (CMV), Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Treponema pallidum. Antibody seroprevalence and mean serum antibody levels were compared between cases and controls. Tumour grade and stage were correlated with serological findings.  Results:   PCa patients were more likely to harbour antibodies against Ureaplasma urealyticum (odds ratio (OR) 2.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-4.28). Men with BPH were more often seropositive for HPV 18 and Chlamydia trachomatis (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.09-0.61 and OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21-0.99, respectively) and had higher mean serum CMV antibody levels than PCa patients (p = 0.0004). Among PCa patients, antibodies against HPV 6 were associated with a higher Gleason score (p = 0.0305).  Conclusions:   Antibody seropositivity against the analyzed pathogens with the exception of Ureaplasma does not seem to be a risk factor for PCa pathogenesis. The presence or higher levels of serum antibodies against the genitourinary pathogens studied were not consistently associated with PCa.

The analysis was made for two time periods, before and after routine implementation of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer diagnostics.

In the first period by TRUS we have made an exact diagnosis of prostate cancer in 18.97% of patients what was confirmed by biopsy. 4.61% ware false positive and 11.34% ware false negative. In the second period prostate cancer was recognized in 30.34% of patients, confirmed by biopsy. False positive cases ware 6.11% and false negative 29.31%.

We report that all missense somatic pol β mutations significantly affect enzyme function. Two of the pol β variants reduce catalytic efficiency, while the remaining five missense mutations alter the fidelity of DNA synthesis. Thus, we conclude that a significant proportion (9 out of 26; 35%) of prostate cancer patients have functionally important somatic mutations of pol β. Many of these missense mutations are clonal in the tumors, and/or are associated with loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability.

A major challenge is to distinguish regions of signal void due to IONPs from those due to low signal tissues or susceptibility artifacts. To overcome this limitation, several positive contrast strategies have been proposed. Relying on IONP T(1) shortening effects to generate positive contrast is a particularly appealing strategy because it should provide additional specificity when associated with the usual negative contrast from effective transverse relaxation time (T(2)*) effects. In this article, ultrashort echo time imaging is shown to be a powerful technique which can take full advantage of both contrast mechanisms. Methods of comparing T(1) and T(2)* contrast efficiency are described and general rules that allow optimizing IONP detection sensitivity are derived. Contrary to conventional wisdom, optimizing T(1) contrast is often a good strategy for imaging IONPs. Under certain conditions, subtraction of a later echo signal from the ultrashort echo time signal not only improves IONP specificity by providing long T(2)* background suppression but also increases detection sensitivity, as it enables a synergistic combination of usually antagonist T(1) and T(2)* contrasts. In vitro experiments support our theory, and a molecular imaging application is demonstrated using tumor-targeted IONPs in vivo.""","""['O M Girard', 'J Du', 'L Agemy', 'K N Sugahara', 'V R Kotamraju', 'E Ruoslahti', 'G M Bydder', 'R F Mattrey']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['T₁-weighted ultrashort echo time method for positive contrast imaging of magnetic nanoparticles and cancer cells bound with the targeted nanoparticles.', 'Ultrashort echo time (UTE) imaging of receptor targeted magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in mouse tumor models.', 'Quantitative contrast-enhanced MRI with superparamagnetic nanoparticles using ultrashort time-to-echo pulse sequences.', 'New options for increasing the sensitivity, specificity and scope of synergistic contrast magnetic resonance imaging (scMRI) using Multiplied, Added, Subtracted and/or FiTted (MASTIR) pulse sequences.', 'Iron oxide nanoparticle targeting mechanism and its application in tumor magnetic resonance imaging and therapy.', 'Contrast Enhancement in MRI Using Combined Double Action Contrast Agents and Image Post-Processing in the Breast Cancer Model.', 'Detection of iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP)-labeled stem cells using quantitative ultrashort echo time imaging: a feasibility study.', 'Mn(ii) chelate-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocrystals as high-efficiency magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents.', 'Assessment of endothelial colony forming cells delivery routes in a murine model of critical limb threatening ischemia using an optimized cell tracking approach.', 'Use of Multiplied, Added, Subtracted and/or FiTted Inversion Recovery (MASTIR) pulse sequences.']"""

This study aimed to identify and validate proteomics-based biomarkers useful for prostate cancer diagnosis and to establish a marker-panel for prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Global protein expression patterns in fresh tissue specimens from 8 patients with prostate carcinoma and 16 with BPH were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We compared our results with those of published studies and defined a set of common biomarkers. We identified 22 differentially expressed proteins between BPH and prostate carcinomas. The up-regulated proteins in cancer compared to BPH included protein disulfide-isomerase, 14-3-3-protein, Enoyl CoA-hydrase, prohibitin and B-tubulin β-2. Keratin-II, desmin, HSP71, ATP-synthase-β-chain and creatine kinase-β-chain were down-regulated. Survey of the literature showed that 15 of our 22 identified proteins have been previously reported to differ in their expression levels between BPH and prostate cancer by other laboratories. The expression patterns of these biomarkers could successfully cluster BPH and adenocarcinomas as well as prostate cancer of low and high Gleason scores. This study validates protein-biomarkers that can be useful for accurate diagnosis and prognostic monitoring of prostate adenocarcinoma. Despite varied prevalence of the disease between different ethnic populations (i.e., high in Sweden, low in Saudi Arabia); the biomarkers indicate that BPH and prostate cancers are biologically 'homogeneous' in their protein expression patterns across wide geographical regions.""","""['Ayodele A Alaiya', 'Mai Al-Mohanna', 'Muhammad Aslam', 'Zakia Shinwari', 'Layla Al-Mansouri', 'Maha Al-Rodayan', 'Maha Al-Eid', 'Irfan Ahmad', 'Kamal Hanash', 'Asma Tulbah', 'Ali Bin Mahfooz', 'Chaker Adra']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Prohibitin identified by proteomic analysis of prostate biopsies distinguishes hyperplasia and cancer.', 'Evidence of a novel biomarker, alphas1-Casein, a milk protein, in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Search for potential markers for prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment in clinical tissue specimens using amine-specific isobaric tagging (iTRAQ) with two-dimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Proteomics of human prostate cancer biospecimens: the global, systems-wide perspective for protein markers with potential clinical utility.', 'Search for Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers of Prostate Inflammation-Related Disorders: Role of Transglutaminase Isoforms as Potential Candidates.', 'Research of Prostate Cancer Urinary Diagnostic Biomarkers by Proteomics: The Noteworthy Influence of Inflammation.', 'Potential Role of Seven Proteomics Tissue Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer in Urine.', 'Functions and mechanisms of protein disulfide isomerase family in cancer emergence.', 'Protein disulphide isomerase can predict the clinical prognostic value and contribute to malignant progression in gliomas.', 'BRCA2 gene mutation and prostate cancer risk.

Objective:   This study analyzed the predictive value of the scoring systems of Bauer, Bauer modified, Tokuhashi, Tokuhashi revised, Tomita, van der Linden, and Sioutos as well as the parameters included in these systems.  Summary of background data:   Metastases of the spinal column are a common manifestation of advanced cancer. Severe pain, pathologic fracture, and neurologic deficit due to spinal metastases need adequate treatment. Besides oncologic aspects and quality of life, treatment decisions should also include the survival prognosis.  Methods:   Two hundred fifty-four patients with confirmed spinal metastases were investigated retrospectively (treatment 1998-2006; 62 underwent surgery and 192 had conservative treatment only). Factors related to survival, such as primary tumor, general condition (Karnofsky Performance Status Scale), neurologic deficit, number of spinal and extraspinal bone metastases, visceral metastases, and pathologic fracture, were analyzed. The survival period was calculated from date of diagnosis of the spinal metastases to date of death or last follow-up (minimum follow-up: 12 months). For statistical analysis, univariate and stepwise multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed.  Results:   Median overall survival for all patients was 10.6 months. The following factors showed significant influence on survival in multivariate analysis: primary tumor (P < 0.0001), status of visceral metastases (P < 0.0001), and systemic therapy (P < 0.0001). Using the recommended group assignment for each system, only Bauer and Bauer modified showed significant results for the distinction between good, moderate, and poor prognosis. The other systems failed to distinguish significantly between good and moderate prognosis. The hazard ratio of the absolute score of all analyzed systems was, however, statistically significant, with a better score leading to lower risk of death.  Conclusion:   According to this analysis, the Bauer and the Bauer modified scores are the most reliable systems for predicting survival. Since the Bauer modified score furthermore consists of only four positive prognostic factors, we emphasize its impact and simplicity.""","""['Christine Wibmer', 'Andreas Leithner', 'Günter Hofmann', 'Heimo Clar', 'Magdalena Kapitan', 'Andrea Berghold', 'Reinhard Windhager']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Spine (Phila Pa 1976)""","""['Predictive value of seven preoperative prognostic scoring systems for spinal metastases.', 'A prospective analysis of prognostic factors in patients with spinal metastases: use of the revised Tokuhashi score.', 'Estimation of life expectancy for selecting surgical procedure and predicting prognosis of extradural spinal metastases.', '259 Patients with DCIS of the breast applying USC/Van Nuys prognostic index: a retrospective review with long term follow up.', 'Prognostic scoring systems for spinal metastases in the era of anti-VEGF therapies.', 'Axial Axis Metastasis.', 'Conditional survival after surgery for metastatic tumors of the spine: does prognosis change over time?', 'Prognosis after Palliative Surgery for Patients with Spinal Metastasis: Comparison of Predicted and Actual Survival.', 'Survival after surgery for spinal metastases: a population-based study.', 'Management of Spinal Bone Metastases With Radiofrequency Ablation, Vertebral Reinforcement and Transpedicular Fixation: A Retrospective Single-Center Case Series.']"""

The HIV Tat (49-57)-derived peptide has been used to deliver a large variety of molecules to cell nuclei. A new hybrid radiopharmaceutical of type Tc-N2S2-Tat(49-57)-Lys-BN (Tc-Tat-BN) internalized in cancer cell nuclei could act as an effective system of targeted radiotherapy using Auger and internal conversion electron emissions near DNA.  Aim:   The aim of this study was to assess the in-vitro nucleus internalization kinetics of Tc-Tat-BN in GRP r-positive cancer cells and to evaluate the subcellular-level radiation-absorbed dose associated with the observed effect on cancer cell DNA proliferation.  Methods:   Tc-Tat-BN in-vitro internalization kinetics were evaluated in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells and breast carcinoma cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB231. Nuclei from cells were isolated using a nuclear extraction kit. Total disintegration in each subcellular compartment was calculated by the integration of experimental time-activity kinetic curves. Nucleus internalization was corroborated by confocal microscopy images using immunofluorescently labelled Tat-BN. The PENELOPE code was used to simulate and calculate the absorbed dose by the contribution of Auger and internal conversion electrons in the cytoplasm and nucleus using geometric models built from immunofluorescent cell images. A cell proliferation kit was used to evaluate DNA concentration after cancer cell incubation with Tc-Tat-BN.  Results:   The results showed that 59.7, 61.2 and 41.5% of total disintegration per unit of Tc-Tat-BN activity (1 Bq) bound to the cell occurred in the nucleus of PC-3, MCF7 and MDA-MB231, respectively. The Tc-Tat-BN absorbed doses delivered to nuclei were 0.142 mGy/decay (PC-3), 0.434 mGy/decay (MCF7) and 0.276 mGy/decay (MDA-MB231). Tc-Tat-BN produced a significant decrease in PC-3 (52.98%), MCF7 (45.71%) and MDA-MB231 (35.80%) cellular proliferation with respect to untreated cells.

Loss of TGF-β receptor II (TGFβR2) in the prostate stroma is correlated with prostatic tumorigenesis. To determine the mechanisms by which stromal heterogeneity because of loss of TGFβR2 might contribute to cancer progression, we attenuated transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling in a subpopulation of immortalized human prostate fibroblasts in a model of tumor progression. In a tissue recombination model, loss of TGFβR2 function in 50% of the stromal cell population resulted in malignant transformation of the nontumorigenic human prostate epithelial cell line BPH1. Mixing fibroblasts expressing the empty vector and dominant negative TGFβR2 increased the expression of markers of myofibroblast differentiation [coexpression of vimentin and alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA)] through elevation of TGF-β1 and activation of the Akt pathway. In combination, these two populations of stromal cells recapitulated the tumor inductive activity of CAFs. TGFβR2 activity in mixed stromal cell populations cultured in vitro caused secretion of factors that are known to promote tumor progression, including TGF-β1, SDF1/CXCL12, and members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) families. In vivo, tissue recombination of fibroblasts overexpressing TGF-β1 and SDF1/CXCL12 not only induced transformation of BPH1 cells, but also promoted a robust growth of highly invasive cells, similar to effects produced by CAFs. While the precise nature and/or origin of the particular stromal cell populations in vivo remain unknown, these findings strongly link heterogeneity in TGF-β signaling to tumor promotion by tumor stromal cells.""","""['Omar E Franco', 'Ming Jiang', 'Douglas W Strand', 'James Peacock', 'Suzanne Fernandez', 'Roger S Jackson nd', 'Monica P Revelo', 'Neil A Bhowmick', 'Simon W Hayward']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Fibroblast growth factor-2 mediates transforming growth factor-beta action in prostate cancer reactive stroma.', 'Cross-talk between paracrine-acting cytokine and chemokine pathways promotes malignancy in benign human prostatic epithelium.', 'Lack of transforming growth factor-β signaling promotes collective cancer cell invasion through tumor-stromal crosstalk.', 'Role of the stromal microenvironment in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'Role of stroma in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'Mechanism of Androgen-Independent Stromal Proliferation in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Engineering prostate cancer in vitro: what does it take?', 'Fibroblasts as Turned Agents in Cancer Progression.', 'Prostate cancer metastasis and health disparities: a systematic review.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast: Role in Prostate Cancer Progression to Metastatic Disease and Therapeutic Resistance.']"""

In this report, we demonstrate the extent of AR transactivation in the presence of 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (androstanediol) in prostate-derived cell lines parallels the bioconversion of androstanediol to DHT. AR transactivation in the presence of androstanediol in prostate cancer cell lines correlated mainly with mRNA and protein levels of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 6 (17β-HSD6), one of several enzymes required for the interconversion of androstanediol to DHT and the inactive metabolite androsterone. Levels of retinol dehydrogenase 5, and dehydrogenase/reductase short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family member 9, which also convert androstanediol to DHT, were lower than 17β-HSD6 in prostate-derived cell lines and higher in the castration-recurrent human prostate cancer xenograft. Measurements of tissue androstanediol using mass spectrometry demonstrated androstanediol metabolism to DHT and androsterone. Administration of androstanediol dipropionate to castration-recurrent CWR22R tumor-bearing athymic castrated male mice produced a 28-fold increase in intratumoral DHT levels.

In this study, we show in prostate cancer cells that valproic acid (VPA) at low concentrations has minimal cytotoxic effects yet can significantly increase radiation-induced apoptosis. VPA seems to stabilize a specific acetyl modification (lysine 120) of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, resulting in an increase in its proapoptotic function at the mitochondrial membrane. These effects of VPA are independent of any action of the p53 protein as a transcription factor in the nucleus, since these effects were also observed in native and engineered prostate cancer cells containing mutant forms of p53 protein having no transcription factor activity. Transcription levels of p53-related or Bcl-2 family member proapoptotic proteins were not affected by VPA exposure. The results of this study suggest that, in addition to nuclear-based pathways previously reported, HDIs may also result in radiosensitization at lower concentrations via a specific p53 acetylation and its mitochondrial-based pathway(s).""","""['Xufeng Chen', 'Jeffrey Y C Wong', 'Patty Wong', 'Eric H Radany']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid, induces p53-dependent radiosensitization of colon cancer cells.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors, valproic acid and trichostatin-A induce apoptosis and affect acetylation status of p53 in ERG-positive prostate cancer cells.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors sensitize human non-small cell lung cancer cells to ionizing radiation through acetyl p53-mediated c-myc down-regulation.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors valproic acid and depsipeptide sensitize retinoblastoma cells to radiotherapy by increasing H2AX phosphorylation and p53 acetylation-phosphorylation.', 'Valproic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances radiosensitivity in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Evolving Diagnostic and Treatment Strategies for Pediatric CNS Tumors: The Impact of Lipid Metabolism.', ""From HDAC to Voltage-Gated Ion Channels: What's Next?

Age-standardized rates were computed using EUROSTAT population estimates.  Results:   The predicted number of cancer deaths in the EU in 2011 was 1,281,436, with standardized rates of 143/100,000 men and 85/100,000 women. Poland had the highest rates, with smaller falls over recent periods. Declines in mortality for major sites including stomach, colorectum, breast, uterus, prostate and leukemias, plus male lung cancer, will continue until 2011, and a trend reversal or a leveling off is predicted where upward trends were previously observed. Female lung cancer rates are increasing in all major EU countries except the UK, where it is the first cause of cancer death, as now in Poland. The increasing pancreatic cancer trends in women observed up to 2004 have likely leveled off.  Conclusions:   Despite falls in rates, absolute numbers of cancer deaths are stable in Europe.

Manual assessment of stained tissue of all biopsies limits speed and accuracy in clinical practice and research of prostate cancer diagnosis. We sought to develop a fully-automated multimodal microscopy method to distinguish cancerous from non-cancerous tissue samples.  Methods:   We recorded chemical data from an unstained tissue microarray (TMA) using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging. Using pattern recognition, we identified epithelial cells without user input. We fused the cell type information with the corresponding stained images commonly used in clinical practice. Extracted morphological features, optimized by two-stage feature selection method using a minimum-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) criterion and sequential floating forward selection (SFFS), were applied to classify tissue samples as cancer or non-cancer.  Results:   We achieved high accuracy (area under ROC curve (AUC) >0.97) in cross-validations on each of two data sets that were stained under different conditions. When the classifier was trained on one data set and tested on the other data set, an AUC value of ~0.95 was observed. In the absence of IR data, the performance of the same classification system dropped for both data sets and between data sets.  Conclusions:   We were able to achieve very effective fusion of the information from two different images that provide very different types of data with different characteristics. The method is entirely transparent to a user and does not involve any adjustment or decision-making based on spectral data.

However, existing technologies are incapable of real-time, volumetric, soft-tissue imaging during radiation beam delivery, when accurate target tracking is most critical. The authors address this challenge in the development and evaluation of a novel, minimally interfering, telerobotic ultrasound (U.S.) imaging system that can be integrated with existing medical linear accelerators (LINACs) for therapy guidance.  Methods:   A customized human-safe robotic manipulator was designed and built to control the pressure and pitch of an abdominal U.S. transducer while avoiding LINAC gantry collisions. A haptic device was integrated to remotely control the robotic manipulator motion and U.S. image acquisition outside the LINAC room. The ability of the system to continuously maintain high quality prostate images was evaluated in volunteers over extended time periods. Treatment feasibility was assessed by comparing a clinically deployed prostate treatment plan to an alternative plan in which beam directions were restricted to sectors that did not interfere with the transabdominal U.S. transducer. To demonstrate imaging capability concurrent with delivery, robot performance and U.S. target tracking in a phantom were tested with a 15 MV radiation beam active.  Results:   Remote image acquisition and maintenance of image quality with the haptic interface was successfully demonstrated over 10 min periods in representative treatment setups of volunteers. Furthermore, the robot's ability to maintain a constant probe force and desired pitch angle was unaffected by the LINAC beam. For a representative prostate patient, the dose-volume histogram (DVH) for a plan with restricted sectors remained virtually identical to the DVH of a clinically deployed plan. With reduced margins, as would be enabled by real-time imaging, gross tumor volume coverage was identical while notable reductions of bladder and rectal volumes exposed to large doses were possible. The quality of U.S. images obtained during beam operation was not appreciably degraded by radiofrequency interference and 2D tracking of a phantom object in U.S. images obtained with the beam on/off yielded no significant differences.  Conclusions:   Remotely controlled robotic U.S. imaging is feasible in the radiotherapy environment and for the first time may offer real-time volumetric soft-tissue guidance concurrent with radiotherapy delivery.""","""['Jeffrey Schlosser', 'Kenneth Salisbury', 'Dimitre Hristov']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Online image-based monitoring of soft-tissue displacements for radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'Robotic ultrasound-guided SBRT of the prostate: feasibility with respect to plan quality.', 'Robotic intrafractional US guidance for liver SABR: System design, beam avoidance, and clinical imaging.', 'Advances in 4D medical imaging and 4D radiation therapy.', 'The Use of Ultrasound Imaging in the External Beam Radiotherapy Workflow of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Ultrasound Imaging with Flexible Array Transducer for Pancreatic Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'A phantom-based analysis for tracking intra-fraction pancreatic tumor motion by ultrasound imaging during radiation therapy.', 'Case Report: Treatment Planning Study to Demonstrate Feasibility of Transthoracic Ultrasound Guidance to Facilitate Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation With Protons.', 'Target motion management in breast cancer radiation therapy.', 'Automatic Detection and Tracking of Marker Seeds Implanted in Prostate Cancer Patients using a Deep Learning Algorithm.']"""

Methods:   This study considered an IGRT treatment plan for a prostate carcinoma patient involving 50.4 Gy from 28 initial fractions and a boost of 28.8 Gy from 16 fractions. A total of 45 CT imaging procedures, each involving a MDCT or a kV CBCT scan procedure, were carefully modeled using the MCNPX code version 2.5.0. The MDCT scanner model is based on the GE LightSpeed 16-MDCT scanner and the kV CBCT scanner model is based on the Varian On-Board Imager using parameters reported by the CT manufacturers and literatures. A patient-specific treatment planning CT data set was used to construct the phantom for the dose calculation. The target, organs-at-risk (OARs), and background voxels in the CT data set were categorized into six tissue types according to CT numbers for Monte Carlo calculations.  Results:   For a total of 45 imaging procedures, it was found that the rectum received 78.4 and 76.7 cGy from MDCT and kV CBCT, respectively. The bladder received slightly greater doses of 82.4 and 77.9 cGy, while the femoral heads received much higher doses of 182.3 and 141.3 cGy from MDCT and kV CBCT, respectively. To investigate the impact of these imaging doses on treatment planning, OAR doses from MDCT or kV CBCT imaging procedures were added to the corresponding dose matrix reported by the original treatment plans to construct dose volume histograms. It was found that after the imaging dose is added, the rectum volumes irradiated to 75 and 70 Gy increased from 13.9% and 21.2%, respectively, in the original plan to 14.8% and 21.8%. The bladder volumes receiving 80 Gy increased to 4.6% from 4.1% in the original plan and the volume receiving 75 Gy increased to 7.9% from 7.5%. All values remained within the tolerance levels: V70<25%, V75 <15% for rectum and V75 < 25%, V80 < 15% for bladder. The irradiation of femoral heads was also acceptable with no volume receiving >45 Gy.  Conclusions:   IGRT procedures can irradiate the OARs to an imaging dose level that is great enough to require careful evaluation and perhaps even adjustment of original treatment planning in order to still satisfy the dose constraints. This study only considered one patient CT because the CT x rays cover a relatively larger volume of the body and the dose distribution is considerably more uniform than those associated with the therapeutic beams. As a result, the dose to an organ from CT imaging doses does not vary much from one patient to the other for the same CT settings. One factor that would potentially affect such CT dose level is the size of the patient body. More studies are needed to develop accurate and convenient methods of accounting for the imaging doses as part of treatment planning.""","""['Aiping Ding', 'Jianwei Gu', 'Alexei V Trofimov', 'X George Xu']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Testicular doses in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Influence of daily imaging on plan quality and normal tissue toxicity for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of the effect of patient dose from cone beam computed tomography on prostate IMRT using Monte Carlo simulation.', 'Kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography imaging dose estimation and optimization: Need of daily cone-beam computed tomography.', 'kV cone-beam CT-based IGRT: a clinical review.', 'Small animal photon counting cone-beam CT on a preclinical radiation research platform to improve radiation dose calculation accuracy.', 'Improving dose calculation accuracy in preclinical radiation experiments using multi-energy element resolved cone-beam CT.', 'Monte Carlo methods for device simulations in radiation therapy.', 'A measurement-based generalized source model for Monte Carlo dose simulations of CT scans.', 'Experimental validation of a kV source model and dose computation method for CBCT imaging in an anthropomorphic phantom.']"""

Drug activity and incorporation, apoptosis, and expression of cell death-related markers were evaluated by SRB test, cytofluorimetric assays, and Western blot, respectively. Among the different DX formulations, NPLDX showed the highest cytotoxic activity in both cell lines, with more than 50% of apoptotic cells at only 1/10 of the plasma peak concentration after 72 h exposure. Anthracyclines, in particular NPLDX, were highly concentrated in the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, a significant increase was observed in the expression of CD95 receptor, GD3 ganglioside and, caspase-2 and -8 active forms in both cell lines followed by caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The Golgi apparatus, probably acting as a stress sensor, intensified the conventional apoptotic mechanism induced by anthracyclines. Our data support the hypothesis that organelle-dependent initiation of cell death other than that induced by mitochondria and nucleus is a research area worthy of pursuing and suggest that the Golgi apparatus could be an ideal target for anti-cancer therapy.

Methods and materials:   We analyzed 975 patients treated with (125)I implantation monotherapy between 1992 and 2006. All patients had tumor Stage ≤ 2c, Gleason score ≤ 7 prostate cancer, a minimum follow-up of 2 years with at least four PSA measurements, and no biochemical failure in the first 2 years. Median follow-up was 6 years. Bounce was defined as a PSA elevation of +0.2 ng/mL with subsequent decrease to previous nadir. We used the Phoenix +2 ng/mL definition for biochemical failure. Additional endpoints were disease-specific and overall survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to adjust for potential confounding factors.  Results:   Bounce occurred in 32% of patients, with a median time to bounce of 1.6 years. More than 90% of bounces took place in the first 3 years after treatment and had disappeared within 2 years of onset. Ten-year freedom from biochemical failure, disease-specific survival, and overall survival rates were, respectively, 90%, 99%, and 88% for the bounce group and 70%, 93%, and 82% for the no-bounce group. Only 1 patient (0.3%) died of prostate cancer in the bounce group, compared with 40 patients (6.1%) in the no-bounce group. Adjusted for confounding, a 70% biochemical failure risk reduction was observed for patients experiencing a bounce (hazard ratio 0.31; 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.48).  Conclusions:   A PSA bounce after prostate brachytherapy is strongly related to better outcome in terms of biochemical failure, disease-specific survival, and overall survival.""","""['Karel A Hinnen', 'Evelyn M Monninkhof', 'Jan J Battermann', 'Joep G H van Roermund', 'Steven J Frank', 'Marco van Vulpen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Analysis of prostate-specific antigen bounce after I(125) permanent seed implant for localised prostate cancer.', 'PSA kinetics after prostate brachytherapy: PSA bounce phenomenon and its implications for PSA doubling time.', 'PSA kinetics and PSA bounce following permanent seed prostate brachytherapy.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Interpreting a rising prostate-specific antigen after brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen Bounce after 125I Brachytherapy Using Stranded Seeds with Intraoperative Optimization for Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen dynamics after neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy and carbon ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Characteristics of PSA Bounce after Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Racial differences in the PSA bounce in predicting prostate cancer outcomes after brachytherapy: Evidence from the Department of Veterans Affairs.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy with periprostatic hydrogel spacer for localized prostate cancer: toxicity profile and early oncologic outcomes.']"""

The results of a prospective trial of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer with long-term patient-reported toxicity and tumor control rates are presented.  Methods and materials:   From 2003 through 2009, 67 patients with clinically localized low-risk prostate cancer were enrolled. Treatment consisted of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions using SBRT with the CyberKnife as the delivery technology. No patient received hormone therapy. Patient self-reported bladder and rectal toxicities were graded on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale (RTOG).  Results:   Median follow-up was 2.7 years. There were no grade 4 toxicities. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Grade 3, 2, and 1 bladder toxicities were seen in 3% (2 patients), 5% (3 patients), and 23% (13 patients) respectively. Dysuria exacerbated by urologic instrumentation accounted for both patients with Grade 3 toxicity. Urinary incontinence, complete obstruction, or persistent hematuria was not observed. Rectal Grade 3, 2, and 1 toxicities were seen in 0, 2% (1 patient), and 12.5% (7 patients), respectively. Persistent rectal bleeding was not observed. Low-grade toxicities were substantially less frequent with QOD vs. QD dose regimen (p = 0.001 for gastrointestinal and p = 0.007 for genitourinary). There were two prostate-specific antigen (PSA), biopsy-proven failures with negative metastatic workup. Median PSA at follow-up was 0.5 ± 0.72 ng/mL. The 4-year Kaplan-Meier PSA relapse-free survival was 94% (95% confidence interval, 85%-102%).  Conclusion:   Significant late bladder and rectal toxicities from SBRT for prostate cancer are infrequent. PSA relapse-free survival compares favorably with other definitive treatments.

Methods and materials:   The first group of 249 patients with prostate cancer treated with SSPT using SFUD was included in this work. The scanning-beam planning target volume and number of monitor units were recorded and checked for consistency. Patient-specific dosimetric measurements were performed, including the point dose for each plan, depth doses, and two-dimensional (2D) dose distribution in the planes perpendicular to the incident beam direction for each field at multiple depths.

Methods and materials:   From August 1999 to December 2008, the computed tomography datasets for 6,600 prostate implants performed by 129 brachytherapists were submitted to Pro-Qura for dosimetric analysis. Brachytherapists were divided into three roughly equal-sized terciles based on total case volume. Postimplant computed tomography scans were obtained at a median of 30 days. Excellent target coverage was defined by a V100≥90% and D90≥100% minimum prescribed peripheral dose. To determine if the number of excellent implants improved with increasing case numbers, each brachytherapist's series of implants was bisected into early and late experience by a moveable critical point.  Results:   For the entire cohort, the mean V100 and D90 were 89.2% and 102.8%, respectively, with 47.7% of the implants scored as excellent. Brachytherapists in the highest-case tercile had a significantly greater fraction of excellent target coverage (57.9%) than did those in the two lower terciles (39.5% and 45.7%, p=0.015). Twenty-one (25.6%) of the 82 brachytherapists with sufficient case volume for dosimetric improvement analyses demonstrated quality improvement over time. Although there was no significant difference between prostate volume and seed strength, the number of seeds used was significantly greater in adequate implants.  Conclusions:   The highest-volume brachytherapists were most likely to obtain excellent target coverage. We are encouraged that in general practice, nearly 48% of all implants were scored excellent. It is conceivable that with greater expert third-party involvement, an even greater percentage of cases with excellent target coverage will become reality.""","""['Gregory S Merrick', 'Jonathan H Lief', 'Peter Grimm', 'John Sylvester', 'Wayne M Butler', 'Zachariah A Allen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""[""Analysis of the Pro-Qura Database: rectal dose, implant quality, and brachytherapist's experience."", 'Influence of Pro-Qura-generated plans on postimplant dosimetric quality: a review of a multi-institutional database.', 'Initial analysis of Pro-Qura: a multi-institutional database of prostate brachytherapy dosimetry.', 'Effect of edema associated with 131Cs prostate permanent seed implants on dosimetric quality indices.', 'Effect of prostate size and isotope selection on dosimetric quality following permanent seed implantation.', 'Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the selection of prostate brachytherapy.', 'Results from the Quality Research in Radiation Oncology (QRRO) survey: Evaluation of dosimetric outcomes for low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.']"""

However, ETV1 can also be overexpressed as a full-length transcript. Full-length ETV1 protein functions differently from truncated ETV1 produced by fusion genes. In this study we describe the genetic background of full-length ETV1 overexpression and the biological properties of different full-length ETV1 isoforms in prostate cancer. Break-apart FISH showed in five out of six patient samples with overexpression of full-length ETV1 a genomic rearrangement of the gene, indicating frequent translocation. We were able to study the rearrangements in more detail in two tumors. In the first tumor 5'-RACE on cDNA showed linkage of the complete ETV1 transcript to the first exon of a prostate-specific two exon ncRNA gene that maps on chromosome 14 (EST14). This resulted in the expression of both full-length ETV1 transcripts and EST14-ETV1 fusion transcripts. In chromosome spreads of a xenograft derived from the second prostate cancer we observed a complex ETV1 translocation involving a chromosome 7 fragment that harbors ETV1 and fragments of chromosomes 4 and 10. Further studies revealed the overexpression of several different full-length transcripts, giving rise to four protein isoforms with different N-terminal regions. Even the shortest isoform synthesized by full-length ETV1 stimulated in vitro anchorage-independent growth of PNT2C2 prostate cells. This contrasts the lack of activity of even shorter N-truncated ETV1 produced by fusion transcripts. Our findings that in clinical prostate cancer overexpression of full-length ETV1 is due to genomic rearrangements involving different chromosomes and the identification of a shortened biologically active ETV1 isoform are highly relevant for understanding the mechanism of ETV1 function in prostate cancer.""","""['Delila Gasi', 'Hetty A van der Korput', 'Hannie C Douben', 'Annelies de Klein', 'Corrina M de Ridder', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Jan Trapman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Truncated ETV1, fused to novel tissue-specific genes, and full-length ETV1 in prostate cancer.', ""Novel 5' fusion partners of ETV1 and ETV4 in prostate cancer."", 'Distinct classes of chromosomal rearrangements create oncogenic ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer.', 'Heterogeneity and clinical significance of ETV1 translocations in human prostate cancer.', 'ETS fusion genes in prostate cancer.', 'ETV1 inhibition depressed M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophage and cell process in gastrointestinal stromal tumor via down-regulating PDE3A.', 'Characterizing chromatin interactions of regulatory elements and nucleosome positions, using Hi-C, Micro-C, and promoter capture Micro-C.', 'Overview of research on fusion genes in prostate cancer.', 'ETS factors in prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide detection of enhancer-hijacking events from chromatin interaction data in rearranged genomes.']"""

Cases (N = 9,007) were men aged ≥40 years diagnosed with prostatic carcinoma between 1985 and 2000, and were matched to four controls on age and duration of SPDP membership. Detailed histories of exposure to prescription NSAIDs and other drugs were obtained from the SPDP.  Results:   Any use of propionates (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) was associated with a modest reduction in prostate cancer risk (Odds ratio = 0.90; 95%CI 0.84-0.95), whereas use of other NSAIDs was not. In particular, we did not observe the hypothesized inverse association with aspirin use (1.01; 0.95-1.07).

Disruption of this process can lead to up-regulation of factors that promote tumorigenesis. We observed decreased basal expression of PHD3 in prostate cancer tissue and tumor cell lines representing diverse tissues of origin. Furthermore, some cancer lines displayed a failure of PHD3 mRNA induction when introduced to a hypoxic environment. This study explores the mechanism by which malignancies neither basally express PHD3 nor induce PHD3 under hypoxic conditions.  Methodology/principal findings:   Using bisulfite sequencing and methylated DNA enrichment procedures, we identified human PHD3 promoter hypermethylation in prostate, breast, melanoma and renal carcinoma cell lines. In contrast, non-transformed human prostate and breast epithelial cell lines contained PHD3 CpG islands that were unmethylated and responded normally to hypoxia by upregulating PHD3 mRNA. Only treatment of cells lines containing PHD3 promoter hypermethylation with the demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine significantly increased the expression of PHD3.  Conclusions/significance:   We conclude that expression of PHD3 is silenced by aberrant CpG methylation of the PHD3 promoter in a subset of human carcinoma cell lines of diverse origin and that this aberrant cytosine methylation status is the mechanism by which these cancer cell lines fail to upregulate PHD3 mRNA. We further show that a loss of PHD3 expression does not correlate with an increase in HIF-1α protein levels or an increase in the transcriptional activity of HIF, suggesting that loss of PHD3 may convey a selective advantage in some cancers by affecting pathway(s) other than HIF.""","""['Trenton L Place', 'Matthew P Fitzgerald', 'Sujatha Venkataraman', 'Sabine U Vorrink', 'Adam J Case', 'Melissa L T Teoh', 'Frederick E Domann']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Expression and DNA methylation levels of prolyl hydroxylases PHD1, PHD2, PHD3 and asparaginyl hydroxylase FIH in colorectal cancer.', 'DNA methylation analysis of the HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylase domain genes PHD1, PHD2, PHD3 and the factor inhibiting HIF gene FIH in invasive breast carcinomas.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) promotes its degradation by induction of HIF-alpha-prolyl-4-hydroxylases.', 'The regulation, localization, and functions of oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase PHD3.', 'Genomic insights into cancer-associated aberrant CpG island hypermethylation.', 'One Omics Approach Does Not Rule Them All: The Metabolome and the Epigenome Join Forces in Haematological Malignancies.', 'Exposomes to Exosomes: Exosomes as Tools to Study Epigenetic Adaptive Mechanisms in High-Altitude Humans.', 'The roles of inducible chromatin and transcriptional memory in cellular defense system responses to redox-active pollutants.', 'Hallmarks of cancer-the new testament.', 'Hypoxic Regulation of Gene Transcription and Chromatin: Cause and Effect.']"""

According to an alternative view, chromosomal imbalance is mainly a common side effect of cancer progression. To test whether a specific genomic aberration might serve as a cancer initiating event, we established an in vitro system that models the evolutionary process of early stages of prostate tumor formation; normal prostate cells were immortalized by the over-expression of human telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT, and cultured for 650 days till several transformation hallmarks were observed. Gene expression patterns were measured and chromosomal aberrations were monitored by spectral karyotype analysis at different times. Several chromosomal aberrations, in particular duplication of chromosomal arm 20q, occurred early in the process and were fixed in the cell populations, while other aberrations became extinct shortly after their appearance. A wide range of bioinformatic tools, applied to our data and to data from several cancer databases, revealed that spontaneous 20q amplification can promote cancer initiation.

The purpose of this study was to show that zoledronic acid (ZA) directly eradicates highly tumorigenic and potentially metastatic cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Human prostate and breast highly tumorigenic (PC3, MCF 7) and low- or non-tumorigenic (LNCaP, MCF 10a) cell lines, respectively, were exposed to different concentrations of ZA (0-10 μM). Reverse transcriptase double quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used for quantitative gene expression analysis. Apoptosis and cell proliferation were determined using microscopic observation and MTS assays. Western blot was used to confirm the translational effects of apoptotic genes on protein expression.  Results:   Human prostate and breast highly tumorigenic (PC3, MCF 7) and low- or non-tumorigenic (LNCaP, MCF 10a) cell lines, respectively, showed multiple genes demonstrating differential expressions, including TRAF, TRADD, BCL2, CASPASES and IAP families. Increasing ZA concentrations showed a greater concentration-time response on cell proliferation and apoptosis in the highly tumorigenic cells. These results were confirmed by both reversing and enhancing the effect of ZA on cell proliferation with caspase 3, 7 or survivin siRNA, respectively. Pro-apoptotic proteins bax and caspase 2, 3, 7 and 9 were up-regulated, while the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl2, birc3 and survivin were down-regulated only in the highly tumorigenic cells.  Conclusions:   This explains the ability of ZA to inhibit bony metastasis in highly tumorigenic cells compared with the low- or non-tumorigenic cells through a significant decrease in cell proliferation and increase in apoptosis through gene-regulated and translational-mediated down-regulation of survivin coupled with the inhibition of caspase 3 or 7. This has significant implications toward understanding the pharmacophysiology of BPs in metastasis and supports the clinically observed effect of BPs when administered adjunctively with anticancer drugs such as cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil, epirubicin in combination with cyclophosphamide or docetaxel, and doxorubicin.""","""['Hussain Almubarak', 'Antonia Jones', 'Risa Chaisuparat', 'Ming Zhang', 'Timothy F Meiller', 'Mark A Scheper']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Carcinog""","""['Zoledronic acid directly suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in highly tumorigenic prostate and breast cancers: Retraction.', 'Zoledronic acid overcomes chemoresistance by sensitizing cancer stem cells to apoptosis.', 'Zoledronic acid in combination with serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors induces enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell lines by decreasing the activities of PP1 and PP2A.', 'Effect of zoledronic acid on oral fibroblasts and epithelial cells: a potential mechanism of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis.', 'Krüppel-like factors KLF2 and 6 and Ki-67 are direct targets of zoledronic acid in MCF-7 cells.', 'Various pathways of zoledronic acid against osteoclasts and bone cancer metastasis: a brief review.', 'Positive impact of Platelet-rich plasma and Platelet-rich fibrin on viability, migration and proliferation of osteoblasts and fibroblasts treated with zoledronic acid.', 'Density functional theory studies on a non-covalent interaction system: hydrogen-bonded dimers of zoledronate.', 'Anti-cancer effects of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates on human cancer cells.', 'Can the microRNA expression profile help to identify novel targets for zoledronic acid in breast cancer?', 'The anti-tumour effects of zoledronic acid.']"""

Gene responses that are central to the TGF-β cytostatic program include activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p15(Ink4B) and p21(WAF1/Cip1), and repression of c-myc. These gene responses are tightly regulated by a repertoire of transcription factors that include Smad proteins and Sp1. The DLX4 homeobox patterning gene encodes a transcription factor that is absent from most normal adult tissues, but is expressed in a wide variety of malignancies, including lung, breast, prostate and ovarian cancers. In this study, we demonstrate that DLX4 blocks the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β. DLX4 inhibited TGF-β-mediated induction of p15(Ink4B) and p21(WAF1/Cip1) expression. DLX4 bound and prevented Smad4 from forming complexes with Smad2 and Smad3, but not with Sp1. However, DLX4 also bound and inhibited DNA-binding activity of Sp1. In addition, DLX4 induced expression of c-myc independently of TGF-β/Smad signaling.

Eg5 (kinesin spindle protein), which is crucial for bipolar spindle formation and duplicated chromosome separation during the early phase of mitosis, has emerged as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the anticancer efficacy of S-(methoxytrityl)-L-cysteine (S(MeO)TLC), a novel Eg5 inhibitor in prostate cancer. Eg5 expression was examined in human prostate cancer cell lines and tissue microarrays were constructed from clinical specimens. Antiproliferative activity of S(MeO)TLC in prostate cancer cells was assessed by a cell viability assay. The anticancer effect and inhibitory mechanism of S(MeO)TLC in prostate cancer cells was further explored by Hoechst staining, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. In addition, the antitumor effect of S(MeO)TLC on subcutaneous xenograft models was assessed. Eg5 expression was identified in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells. More than half of prostate cancer clinical specimens displayed Eg5 expression. S(MeO)TLC exhibited more powerful anticancer activity in prostate cancer cells compared with the other four Eg5 inhibitors tested. S(MeO)TLC induced cell death after arresting dividing cells at mitosis with distinct monopolar spindle formation. S(MeO)TLC exhibited its significant inhibitory activity (P<0.05) on subcutaneous xenograft models also through induction of mitotic arrest.

Their demands and expectations of surgical intervention are much higher and cannot be adequately addressed with the classic trifecta outcome measures.  Objective:   A new and more comprehensive method for reporting outcomes after radical prostatectomy, the pentafecta, is proposed.  Design, setting, and participants:   From January 2008 through September 2009, details of 1111 consecutive patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy performed by a single surgeon were retrospectively analyzed. Of 626 potent men, 332 who underwent bilateral nerve sparing and who had 1 yr of follow-up were included in the study group.  Measurements:   In addition to the traditional trifecta outcomes, two perioperative variables were included in the pentafecta: no postoperative complications and negative surgical margins. Patients who attained the trifecta and concurrently the two additional outcomes were considered as having achieved the pentafecta. A logistic regression model was created to evaluate independent factors for achieving the pentafecta.  Results and limitations:   Continence, potency, biochemical recurrence-free survival, and trifecta rates at 12 mo were 96.4%, 89.8%, 96.4%, and 83.1%, respectively. With regard to the perioperative outcomes, 93.4% had no postoperative complication and 90.7% had negative surgical margins. The pentafecta rate at 12 mo was 70.8%. On multivariable analysis, patient age (p=0.001) was confirmed as the only factor independently associated with the pentafecta.  Conclusions:   A more comprehensive approach for reporting prostate surgery outcomes, the pentafecta, is being proposed.

Patients and methods:   The clinical reports of 681 consecutive patients operated on for prostate cancer between 2002 and 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. All patients had endorectal MR (1.5 Tesla) with pelvic phased array coil. (1.5 T erMR PPA). Sixty-one patients (8.9%) fulfilled ""SurAcaP"" protocol criteria. Preoperative data (MR+core biopsy) were assessed by comparison to whole-mount step section pathology.  Results:   85.3% of the 61 patients entering SurAcaP protocol had significant tumor at pathology. (Non Organ Confined Disease (Non OCD)=8.2%, Gleason sum score>6=39.2%).

Images on Day 0 are typically obtained with a contrast-filled urinary catheter in place for urethral dose calculations. However, expansion of the urethra and perhaps the prostate by the catheter may affect target coverage. We assessed the effect of urinary catheterization on target dosimetry after implantation with palladium-103 ((103)Pd) or iodine-125 ((125)I) seeds.  Methods and materials:   Patients were 29 consecutive men with postimplant dosimetry calculated with and without a urinary catheter after brachytherapy seed implantation; 19 patients received (103)Pd seeds and 10 patients received (125)I seeds. In each case, 14-French caude tip urinary catheters were placed before implantation, and axial CT slices of the pelvis were obtained before and after catheter removal for postimplant dosimetry. Dosimetric parameters were measured and compared with paired Student's t tests. Trends were assessed by linear regression with the Pearson correlation coefficient.  Results:   Removal of the urinary catheter significantly improved V(100) and D(90) for (103)Pd implants (mean±standard deviation (SD), 2.7%±4.2%; range, -0.4% to 15%; p=0.011 and mean±SD, 4.0%±3.4%; range, -0.1% to 13.8%; p<0.01, respectively). For (125)I implants, catheter removal improved D(90) (mean±SD, 1.5%±1.8%; range, -1.3% to 4.2%; p=0.027). For the (103)Pd group, the magnitude of change in V(100) correlated with prostate size (R(2)=0.16) and source number (R(2)=0.15).  Conclusions:   Urinary catheterization can artificially reduce target coverage after prostate implant brachytherapy. The patients undergoing (103)Pd implantation with smaller (<30cm(3)) prostates and fewer (<90) sources are particularly susceptible to reduced D(90) and V(100) when a urinary catheter is present.""","""['Shervin M Shirvani', 'Rajat J Kudchadker', 'Teresa L Bruno', 'Anna Likhacheva', 'David A Swanson', 'Steven J Frank']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Variability of prostate brachytherapy pre-implant dosimetry: a multi-institutional analysis.', 'Comparison of intraoperative dosimetric implant representation with postimplant dosimetry in patients receiving prostate brachytherapy.', 'Androgen deprivation-induced changes in prostate anatomy predict urinary morbidity after permanent interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

Besides the effect of total implant displacement, also displacements of catheters belonging to selected template rows only were evaluated in terms of target coverage and normal tissue dose, in order to analyse the change in dose distribution as a function of catheter dwell weight and catheter location.  Material and methods:   Five representative implant geometries, with 17 catheters each, were selected. The clinical treatment plan was compared to treatment plans in which an entire implant displacement in caudal direction over 3, 5, 7 and 10 mm was simulated. Besides, treatment plans were simulated considering a displacement of either the central, most ventral or most dorsal catheter rows only, over 5 mm caudally.  Results:   Due to displacement of the entire implant the target coverage drops below the tolerance of 93% for all displacements studied. The effect of displacement of the entire implant on organs at risk strongly depended on the patient anatomy; e.g., for 80% of the implant geometries the V(80) of the rectum exceeded its tolerance for all displacements. The effect of displacement of catheters belonging to selected template rows depended strongly on the relative weight of each catheter row when considering the target coverage and on its location when considering the dose in the organs at risk.

The goal of this study is to estimate this intrafractional movement of the prostate during prostate cancer radiotherapy.  Material and methods:   Twenty-seven patients with prostate cancer and implanted fiducials underwent a marker match procedure before a five-field IMRT treatment. For all fields, in-treatment images were obtained and then processed to enable automatic marker detection. Combining the subsequent projection images, five positions of each marker were determined using the shortest path approach. The residual set-up error (RSE) after kV-MV based prostate localization, the prostate position as a function of time during a radiotherapy session and the required margins to account for intrafractional motion were determined.  Results:   The mean RSE and standard deviation in the antero-posterior, cranio-caudal and left-right direction were 2.3±1.5 mm, 0.2±1.1 mm and -0.1±1.1 mm, respectively. Almost all motions occurred in the posterior direction before the first treatment beam as the percentage of excursions>5 mm was reduced significantly when the RSE was not accounted for. The required margins for intrafractional motion increased with prolongation of the treatment. Application of a repositioning protocol after every beam could decrease the 1cm margin from CTV to PTV by 2 mm.  Conclusions:   The RSE is the main contributor to intrafractional motion. This RSE after on-line prostate localization and patient repositioning in the posterior direction emphasizes the need to speed up the marker match procedure. Also, a prostate IMRT treatment should be administered as fast as possible, to ensure that the pre-treatment repositioning efforts are not erased by intrafractional prostate motion. This warrants an optimized workflow with the use of faster treatment techniques.""","""['Tom Budiharto', 'Pieter Slagmolen', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Frederik Maes', 'Sara Junius', 'Jan Verstraete', 'Raymond Oyen', 'Jeroen Hermans', 'Frank Van den Heuvel']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Image-guided radiotherapy with implanted markers and kilovoltage imaging and 6-dimensional position corrections for intrafractional motion of the prostate.', 'Application of dose compensation in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Intrafraction motion of the prostate during an IMRT session: a fiducial-based 3D measurement with Cone-beam CT.', 'Benefit of intensity modulated and image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic targeting image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Reducing the margin in prostate radiotherapy: optimizing radiotherapy with a general-purpose linear accelerator using an in-house position monitoring system.', 'Intrafraction Prostate Motion Management for Ultra-Hypofractionated Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Artificial intelligence in image-guided radiotherapy: a review of treatment target localization.', 'MR-Guided Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Incorporating imaging information from deep neural network layers into image guided radiation therapy (IGRT).']"""

The low specificity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) results in diagnostic biopsies in men without prostate cancer (PCa). Additional information, such as genetic markers, could be used to avoid unnecessary biopsies.  Objective:   To determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PCa can be used to determine whether biopsy of the prostate is necessary.  Design, settings, and participants:   The Stockholm-1 cohort (n = 5241) consisted of men who underwent a prostate biopsy during 2005 to 2007. PSA levels were retrieved from databases and family histories were obtained using a questionnaire. Thirty-five validated SNPs were analysed and converted into a genetic risk score that was implemented in a risk-prediction model.  Results and limitations:   When comparing the nongenetic model (based on age, PSA, free-to-total PSA, and family history) with the genetic model and using a fixed number of detected PCa cases, it was found that the genetic model required significantly fewer biopsies than the nongenetic model, with 480 biopsies (22.7%) avoided, at a cost of missing a PCa diagnosis in 3% of patients characterised as having an aggressive disease. However, the overall genetic model does not discriminate between aggressive and nonaggressive cases.

Materials and methods:   Patients who underwent radical prostatectomies at a single tertiary cancer centre were prospectively enrolled. Conventional cystography was routinely performed on postoperative day 7. Non-enhanced pelvic CT images were obtained after retrograde instillation of the same contrast material for a reference standard of urine leakage at the VUA site. Urine leakage was classified as follows: none; a plication abnormality; mild; moderate; and excessive.  Results:   One hundred and twenty consecutive patients were enrolled. Conventional cystography detected 14 urine leakages, but CT cystography detected 40 urine leakages, which consisted of 28 mild and 12 moderate urine leakages. When using CT cystography as the standard measurement, conventional cystography showed a diagnostic accuracy of 17.8% (5/28) for mild urine leakage and 75% (9/12) for moderate leakage. Of nine patients diagnosed with mild leakage on conventional cystography, four (44.4%) had complicated moderate urine leakages based on CT cystography, requiring prolonged catheterization. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of conventional cystography were 35, 100, 100, 75.4, and 78.3%, respectively.

In this study, we investigate the potential link between this ratio and the Wellbeing Index (WI) among Texas counties.  Results:   Cancer data in 2000 were provided by the Texas Cancer Registry, while data on the ten socioeconomic variables among the 254 Texas counties in 2000 for building the WI were obtained from U.S. Census Bureau. The ten socioeconomic status variables were subjected to the principal component analysis, and the first principal component scores were grouped into deciles for the WI (1 to 10) and the 254 Texas counties were classified into 10 corresponding groups. Weighted linear regression analyses and a Cochran-Armitage trend test were performed to determine the relationship between the ratio of age-adjusted metastatic to non-metastatic cancer incidence cases and WI. The ratios of metastatic to non-metastatic cases of female genital system cancer (r2 = 0.84, p = 0.0002), all-type cancers (r2= 0.73, p = 0.0017) and lung cancer (r2= 0.54, p = 0.0156) at diagnosis were positively correlated with WI.  Conclusions:   The ratios of metastatic to non-metastatic cases of all-type, female genital system and lung cancers at diagnosis were statistically correlated with socioeconomic deprivation. Potential mediators for the correlation warrant further investigation in order to reduce health disparities associated with socioeconomic inequality.""","""['Billy U Philips Jr', 'Gordon Gong', 'Kristopher A Hargrave', 'Eric Belasco', 'Conrad P Lyford']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Health Geogr""","""['Determinants of delayed detection of cancers in Texas counties in the United States of America.', 'Impact of socioeconomic status on cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis: selected findings from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results: National Longitudinal Mortality Study.', 'Invasive Cancer Incidence, 2004-2013, and Deaths, 2006-2015, in Nonmetropolitan and Metropolitan Counties - United States.', 'County-level socioeconomic status and cancer rates in Texas, 2001-2005.', 'Temporal trends in area socioeconomic disparities in breast-cancer incidence and mortality, 1988-2005.', 'Evaluating a De-Centralized Regional Delivery System for Breast Cancer Screening and Patient Navigation for the Rural Underserved.', 'An examination of disparities in cancer incidence in Texas using Bayesian random coefficient models.', 'Socioeconomic deprivation as a determinant of cancer mortality and the Hispanic paradox in Texas, USA.', 'Determinants of delayed detection of cancers in Texas counties in the United States of America.']"""

It is considered a precursor of invasive bladder cancer. CIS is classified as primary, secondary or concurrent, when occurred as isolated CIS without cuncurrent papillary tumors, or detected during the follow-up of patients with a previous papillary tumor, or finally in the presence of bladder neoplasm. BCG is widely established as the treatment of choice for CIS with a success rate of approximately 70%. BCG reduces the risk of progression of CIS into invasive carcinoma in 30 to 50% of cases. Direct and prolonged contact between the urothelium and BCG is a prerequisite for successful therapy. Discovery of CIS in the prostatic or membranous urethra represents an ominous sign. CIS may be present only in the epithelial lining of the prostatic urethra or in the ducts, or in the worst case it may be found in the prostatic tissue stroma. Urethral involvement by CIS is at high risk of tumor progression and development of metastases due to reduced thickness of lamina propria and absence of muscolaris mucosa. 83 patients, enrolled from 1/1996 to 12/2005 at our urological department with CIS: primary (focal and multifocal) in 25, secondary in 7 and cuncurrent in 51 (associated with T1bG3 cancer in 37 cases), and urethral CIS in 5 and conservatively treated by TUR and intravescical instillations of BCG, 4 developed afterwords only invasive cancer of the urethra in the absence of bladder involvement. In 2 cases cancer arised from the prostatic fossa after TURP, in 1 from membranous urethra and in the last from prostatic ducts. Among the 4 patients, 3 were treated by cystoprostatourethrectomy and Platinum-based chemotherapy, 1 refused surgical treatment. Two patients died for disseminated disease. 1 patient is alive at 60-month's follow-up. In the last patient cancer relapsed at 36-month's follow-up. We conclude that prostatic/urethral involvement during follow-up after successful intravesical treatment with BCG in CIS represents a high risk of developing invasive and incontrolled cancer.

Our current study, involving multiple types of human tumors, further shows that leukocyte infiltration could also trigger tumor metastasis through the following pathways: [1] more leukocytes migrate to focally disrupted tumor capsules, which forms leukocyte aggregates surrounding newly formed tumor cell clusters, [2] the physical movement of leukocytes into proliferating tumor cells disrupts the intercellular junctions and cell-surface adhesion molecules, causing the disassociation of tumor cells from the tumor core, [3] leukocytes are conjoined with some of these tumor cells through plasma membrane fusion, creating tumor cell-leukocyte chimeras (TLCs), and [4] the leukocyte of TLCs impart migratory capacity to associated tumor cell partners, physically dragging them to different tissue sites. Our findings suggest a novel pathway for tumor cell dissemination from the primary sites and the subsequent journey to new sites.

Integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix is also important for prostate cell survival. AR-positive prostate cancer cells express primarily integrin α6β1 and adhere to a laminin-rich matrix. In this study, we show that active nuclear-localized AR protects prostate cancer cells from death induced by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition when cells adhere to laminin. Resistance to PI3K inhibition is mediated directly by an AR-dependent increase in integrin α6β1 mRNA transcription and protein expression. Subsequent signaling by integrin α6β1 in AR-expressing cells increased NF-κB activation and Bcl-xL expression. Blocking AR, integrin α6, NF-κB, or Bcl-xL concurrent with inhibition of PI3K was sufficient and necessary to trigger death of laminin-adherent AR-expressing cells. Taken together, these results define a novel integrin-dependent survival pathway in prostate cancer cells that is regulated by AR, independent of and parallel to the PI3K pathway.

To predict disease aggressiveness, clinicians combine clinical variables to create prognostic models, but the models have limited accuracy. We assessed the prognostic value of a predefined cell cycle progression (CCP) score in two cohorts of patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We measured the expression of 31 genes involved in CCP with quantitative RT-PCR on RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour samples, and created a predefined score and assessed its usefulness in the prediction of disease outcome. The signature was assessed retrospectively in a cohort of patients from the USA who had undergone radical prostatectomy, and in a cohort of randomly selected men with clinically localised prostate cancer diagnosed by use of a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the UK who were managed conservatively. The primary endpoint was time to biochemical recurrence for the cohort of patients who had radical prostatectomy, and time to death from prostate cancer for the TURP cohort.  Findings:   After prostatectomy, the CCP score was useful for predicting biochemical recurrence in the univariate analysis (hazard ratio for a 1-unit change [doubling] in CCP 1·89; 95% CI 1·54-2·31; p=5·6×10(-9)) and the best multivariate analysis (1·77, 1·40-2·22; p=4·3×10(-6)). In the best predictive model (final multivariate analysis), the CCP score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration were the most important variables and were more significant than any other clinical variable. In the TURP cohort, the CCP score was the most important variable for prediction of time to death from prostate cancer in both univariate analysis (2·92, 2·38-3·57, p=6·1×10(-22)) and the final multivariate analysis (2·57, 1·93-3·43; p=8·2×10(-11)), and was stronger than all other prognostic factors, although PSA concentration also added useful information. Heterogeneity in the hazard ratio for the CCP score was not noted in any case for any clinical variables.  Interpretation:   The results of this study provide strong evidence that the CCP score is a robust prognostic marker, which, after additional validation, could have an essential role in determining the appropriate treatment for patients with prostate cancer.

While 5-HIAA alone had no cytotoxic effect at <1mM, 5-HIAA(UVB) induced LnCaP, PC-3, and TCCSUP cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis showed that 5-HIAA(UVB) markedly increased the sub-G(0)/G(1) phase and resulted in cell cycle disruption. To elucidate the death mechanism by 5-HIAA(UVB), we examined the signal transduction pathways related to apoptosis using Western blot analysis. 5-HIAA(UVB) led to phosphorylation of stress-activated signaling proteins, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and/or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Furthermore, 5-HIAA(UVB) activated caspase-8, -9, and -3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which are indicators of apoptosis. From these findings, the present study demonstrated that 5-HIAA(UVB) induces apoptotic cell death of prostate and bladder cancer cells via stress-mediated signaling and apoptotic pathways.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the data from 155 consecutive men treated radically for prostate cancer using intensity-modulated radiotherapy to 78 Gy between January 2007 and March 2009 across six radiotherapy treatment centers. The plan quality was determined by the measures of coverage, homogeneity, and conformity. Tumor coverage was measured using the planning target volume (PTV) receiving 95% and 100% of the prescribed dose (V(95%) and V(100%), respectively) and the clinical target volume (CTV) receiving 95% and 100% of the prescribed dose. Homogeneity was measured using the sigma index of the PTV and CTV. Conformity was measured using the lesion coverage factor, healthy tissue conformity index, and the conformity number. Multivariate regression models were created to determine the relationship between these and T stage, risk status, androgen deprivation therapy use, treatment center, planning system, and treatment date.  Results:   The largest discriminatory measurements of coverage, homogeneity, and conformity were the PTV V(95%), PTV sigma index, and conformity number. The mean PTV V(95%) was 92.5% (95% confidence interval, 91.3-93.7%). The mean PTV sigma index was 2.10 Gy (95% confidence interval, 1.90-2.20). The mean conformity number was 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.79). The treatment center independently influenced the coverage, homogeneity, and conformity (all p < .0001). The planning system independently influenced homogeneity (p = .038) and conformity (p = .021). The treatment date independently influenced the PTV V(95%) only, with it being better at the start (p = .013). Risk status, T stage, and the use of androgen deprivation therapy did not influence any aspect of plan quality.  Conclusion:   Our study has benchmarked measures of coverage, homogeneity, and conformity for the treatment of prostate cancer using IMRT. The differences seen between centers and planning systems and the coverage deterioration over time highlight the need for every center to determine their own benchmarks and apply clinical vigilance with respect to maintaining these through quality assurance.""","""['Sashendra Senthi', 'Suki S Gill', 'Annette Haworth', 'Tomas Kron', 'Jim Cramb', 'Aldo Rolfo', 'Jessica Thomas', 'Gillian M Duchesne', 'Christopher H Hamilton', 'Daryl Lim Joon', 'Patrick Bowden', 'Farshad Foroudi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Hypofractionated intensity-modulated arc therapy for lymph node metastasized prostate cancer.', 'Persistently better treatment planning results of intensity-modulated (IMRT) over conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in prostate cancer patients with significant variation of clinical target volume and/or organs-at-risk.', 'Helical tomotherapy for whole-brain irradiation with integrated boost to multiple brain metastases: evaluation of dose distribution characteristics and comparison with alternative techniques.', 'Introducing new technologies into the clinic.', 'Planning With Patient-Specific Rectal Sub-Region Constraints Decreases Probability of Toxicity in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Assessment and Comparison of Homogeneity and Conformity Indexes in Step-and-Shoot and Compensator-Based Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D CRT) in Prostate Cancer.', 'A new plan quality index for dose painting radiotherapy.', 'Radiotherapy doses of 80 Gy and higher are associated with lower mortality in men with Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer.']"""

We report the disease control and toxicity of HDR monotherapy from California Endocurietherapy (CET) and William Beaumont Hospital (WBH) in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients.  Methods and materials:   There were 298 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with HDR monotherapy between 1996 and 2005. Two biologically equivalent hypofractionation protocols were used. At CET the dose was 42 Gy in six fractions (two implantations 1 week apart) delivered to a computed tomography-defined planning treatment volume. At WBH the dose was 38 Gy in four fractions (one implantation) based on intraoperative transrectal ultrasound real-time treatment planning. The bladder, urethral, and rectal dose constraints were similar. Toxicity was scored with the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 5.2 years. The median age of the patients was 63 years, and the median value of the pretreatment prostate-specific antigen was 6.0 ng/mL. The 8-year results were 99% local control, 97% biochemical control (nadir +2), 99% distant metastasis-free survival, 99% cause-specific survival, and 95% overall survival. Toxicity was scored per event, meaning that an individual patient with more than one symptom was represented repeatedly in the morbidity data table. Genitourinary toxicity consisted of 10% transient Grade 2 urinary frequency or urgency and 3% Grade 3 episode of urinary retention. Gastrointestinal toxicity was <1%.

The correlation between UCH-L1 and cancer has been reported in various tissues, but the role of UCH-L1 in prostate cancer has not been thoroughly researched. Here we found that UCH-L1 is specifically highly expressed in the metastatic DU145 prostate cancer cell line, but not in the benign or weakly metastatic prostate cancer cells. To determine the role of UCH-L1 in prostate cancer metastasis, we constructed UCH-L1-knockdown DU145 and UCH-L1 or the active site mutant form of UCH-L1 (UCH-L1 C90S) expressing RWPE1 stable cells. Notably, the expression of UCH-L1 in RWPE1 cells promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and this is an important process for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. On the contrary, knockdown of UCH-L1 in DU145 cells induces MET, the reverse program of EMT. Furthermore, the change of EMT status caused by altering the UCH-L1 level affects the migration and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells.

The AKAP12 gene has shown reduced expression and marked hypermethylation in a variety of cancers.  Methods:   The percentage levels of DNA methylation were measured in 78 PCa, 22 benign prostatic hyperplasia, and 22 normal adjacent tissue samples using an AKAP12 methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting assay. AKAP12 gene expression was also examined in 4 human prostate carcinoma cell lines, PC-3, DU145, LNCaP, and 22RV1, using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting analysis and after DNA methyltransferase inhibition with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.  Results:   Methylation (>1%) of the AKAP12 promoter region was present in 47 (60.2%) of the 78 PCa, 5 (22.7%) of the 22 benign prostatic hyperplasia, and 2 (9.1%) of the 22 adjacent normal tissue samples. AKAP12 methylation was significantly greater in the PCa than in the benign prostatic hyperplasia or adjacent tissue samples (P < .01). AKAP12 methylation was significantly greater in the PCa samples with higher Gleason scores (P = .03); however, no correlation was found with age, pT category, or serum prostate-specific antigen level. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that PC-3 and DU-145 cells expressed AKAP12 RNA and LNCaP and 22RV1 did not. The AKAP12 locus was methylated in the LNCaP and 22RV1 cells. Treatment of LNCaP cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine markedly decreased the methylation levels and increased the expression of AKAP12.

To test the hypothesis, an exploratory study was conducted to examine serum 25(OH)D levels in a cohort of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. The study aim was to assess the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in these patients. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D less than 75 nmol/L. Serum 25(OH)D levels measured prospectively at baseline and, then, yearly during a 5-year follow-up were analyzed. Various parameters were examined to assess their possible association with vitamin D insufficiency at baseline, using both a univariate analysis and a logistic regression model. Analyses including descriptive statistics for all variables were carried out with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A total of 106 patients were available for analysis. The median age was 66.3 years. At baseline, mean and median vitamin D level was 72.4 and 70.0 nmol/L, respectively. Sixty-four patients (60.4%) met the definition of vitamin D insufficiency with serum 25(OH)D less than 75 nmol/L.

Our results showed no significant associations between specific n-3 or n-6 PUFA intakes and prostate cancer risk. The highest dietary ratio of n-6/n-3 was significantly associated with elevated risk of high-grade (OR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.18-10.69; P(trend) = 0.03), but not low-grade prostate cancer (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.43-2.17).

Methods:   DNA methylation levels at 26,485 autosomal CpGs were assayed in 201 newborns (107 African American and 94 Caucasian). Nonparametric analyses were performed to examine the relation between these methylation levels and maternal parity, maternal age, newborn gestational age, newborn gender, and newborn race. To identify the possible influences of confounding, stratification was performed by a second and third variable. For genes containing CpGs with significant differences in DNA methylation levels between races, analyses were performed to identify highly represented gene ontological terms and functional pathways.  Results:   13.7% (3623) of the autosomal CpGs exhibited significantly different levels of DNA methylation between African Americans and Caucasians; 2% of autosomal CpGs had significantly different DNA methylation levels between male and female newborns. Cancer pathways, including four (pancreatic, prostate, bladder, and melanoma) with substantial differences in incidence between the races, were highly represented among the genes containing significant race-divergent CpGs.  Conclusions:   At birth, there are significantly different DNA methylation levels between African Americans and Caucasians at a subset of CpG dinucleotides.

Unfortunately, docetaxel's efficacy is significantly limited by its considerable toxicity on hematopoietic progenitor cells, thus necessitating dose reduction or even discontinuation of the chemotherapy. Induction of pre-mitotic arrest protects cells against docetaxel-mediated toxicity and affords therapeutic opportunities.  Methods:   Cell cycle progression was examined by propidium iodide staining. Zinc uptake was determined by FluoZin-3 AM staining. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation was detected using APO-BRDU kit.  Results:   In the course of our current work, we treated the myeloid progenitor TF-1 cells and the castration-resistant PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells with physiologically relevant concentrations of zinc.

Moreover, pre-treatment with zinc abolished docetaxel-induced apoptosis in TF-1 cells, whereas such treatment had no effect on apoptosis in PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells.

However, the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of AA pathway genes remains unclear. The purpose of this case-control study was to evaluate the association between prostate cancer risk and 14 such SNPs in the PTGS2, PTGES2, ALOX5, ALOX5AP, and LTA4H genes.  Methods:   Genotyping was conducted on 585 white prostate cancer cases and 585 healthy, age-matched controls. The best genetic model for each SNP was determined using Akaike's information criterion. Odds ratios for the association between each SNP and prostate cancer risk were calculated, both overall and stratified by obesity (BMI ≥ 30). Haplotype analysis was conducted for the PTGES2 SNPs.  Results:   LTA4H rs1978331 was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk overall (unadjusted, overdominant model OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51-0.91 for TC vs. TT/CC). Among non-obese individuals, the GG genotype of PTGES2 rs10987883 was associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer (unadjusted, recessive model OR = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.27-8.23).  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that SNPs in certain AA metabolism genes may influence prostate cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, it is possible that obesity, which induces a chronic state of low-level inflammation in addition to several metabolic sequelae, may modify the impact of these SNPs. These findings should be confirmed in a larger study with power to detect differential effects by obesity.""","""['E Susan Amirian', 'Michael M Ittmann', 'Michael E Scheurer']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Genetic variation in the leukotriene pathway is associated with myocardial infarction in the Chinese population.', 'PTGS2 and IL6 genetic variation and risk of breast and prostate cancer: results from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3).', 'The role of ALOX5AP, LTA4H and LTB4R polymorphisms in determining baseline lung function and COPD susceptibility in UK smokers.', 'Significant association of catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met polymorphism with bladder cancer instead of prostate and kidney cancer.', 'Enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism.', 'Human microbiome and prostate cancer development: current insights into the prevention and treatment.', ""The Polymorphism rs17525495 of LTA4H Is Associated with Susceptibility of Crohn's Disease instead of Intestinal Tuberculosis in a Chinese Han Population."", 'Analysis of Candidate Idarubicin Drug Resistance Genes in MOLT-3 Cells Using Exome Nuclear DNA.', 'The arachidonic acid metabolism protein-protein interaction network and its expression pattern in esophageal diseases.', 'Knockdown of delta-5-desaturase promotes the anti-cancer activity of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy in colon cancer cells expressing COX-2.']"""

TMA's are specifically in demand for the screening for diagnostic and prognostic markers in prostate cancer (PC). Consequently, TMAs from prostate needle biopsy (PNB) material taken at diagnosis before any treatment commenced are in demand. However, since PNB contain only limited amount of tumor arranged within a very thin tissue core, TMA construction from PNB is problematic.  Methods:   Archival PNB from 30 PC patients with variable Gleason scores (6-10) and % of cores involvement (30-90%) were used. Following selection of representative cores, the paraffin blocks were melted. Each core was sectioned into equal parts of 3-4 mm in length. For each case, a group of fragments was then re-embedded in a vertical orientation. Using Manual TMA Apparatus, 2 mm cores from each of the vertically rearranged fragments were harvested. Sections (4 µm) were stained with H&E and with high-molecular weight cytokeratin (HMWCK), PIN-cocktail (p63 + p504S), and PSA immunohistochemical stains.  Results:   A TMA from PNB with a capacity of 80 serial 4 µm sections was constructed. In all cases, identical tumor and neighboring tissue morphology (atrophic changes and high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia) with no loss of tissue was evident.  Conclusions:   The vertical clustering re-arrangement (VCR) technique is suitable for large scale construction of TMA blocks from PNB maintaining the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of the original samples.

We previously reported that a novel nonsteroidal AR pure antagonist, CH4933468, which is a thiohydantoin derivative with a sulfonamide side chain, provided in vitro proof of concept but did not in vivo.  Methods:   We developed other derivatives, CH5137291, CH5138514, and CH5166623, and their pharmacological properties were compared with CH4933468 and bicalutamide. Agonist/antagonist activities in AR-mediated transactivation, cell proliferation against LNCaP and LNCaP-BC2, and AR translocation were evaluated. Agonist metabolite was monitored in liver microsomes and in pharmacokinetics experiments. Antitumor activities in CRPC xenograft models were examined using LNCaP-BC2 and VCaP-CRPC.  Results:   All CH compounds completely inhibited AR-mediated transactivation and proliferation of LNCaP and LNCaP-BC2. In contrast bicalutamide showed a partial inhibition of AR-mediated transactivation and a proliferation of LNCaP-BC2. AR translocation to nucleus was inhibited by CH compounds, but stimulated by bicalutamide. In the LNCaP-BC2 xenograft model, however, only CH5137291 showed significant inhibition of plasma PSA level and antitumor activity. The other three CH compounds were metabolized to their core structure which had agonist activity. CH5137291 also exhibited antitumor activity in a VCaP-CRPC xenograft model, but bicalutamide did not.  Conclusions:   The molecular mechanism of the CH compounds, inhibition of AR translocation, was different from bicalutamide and this action could contribute to AR pure antagonist activity. Agonist metabolite diminished the antitumor activity of AR pure antagonist.

Therefore, patients should be counseled about the risk of missing an incidental prostate cancer (incPCa). In this study the risk of an incPCa was determined based on all preoperative parameters.  Methods:   Thousand three hundred and fifty seven (04/2004-09/2008) patients underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in our department. Cases with less than 10 g removed tissue, PSA >20 ng/ml or with known PCa were excluded. Data of the remaining 1,000 consecutive patients were collected retrospectively and statistically analyzed using SAS.  Results:   Mean age was 69.4 (36-96) years, mean PSA 4.41 (0.08-19.5) ng/ml, mean weight of removed tissue 30.9 (10-110) g. An incPCa was detected in 111 cases. Thirty-four out of these were considered to be clinically relevant (relPCa; stage T1b and/or Gleason sum ≥7). In univariate analysis age, volume of the prostate and body mass index correlated with incPCa while age, volume of the prostate and PSA correlated with relPCa. Predictive parameters for a multivariate logistic regression model are age and body mass index for incPCa and age, prostate volume, and number of prior biopsies for relPCa.  Conclusions:   More than 1 in 10 patients undergoing TURP has an incPCa and 3.4% have a relPCa. Patients should be counseled carefully about the risk of missing especially relPCa when undergoing vaporization of the prostate.

Inhibition of 5-AR 2 has proven to be efficacious for management of urinary symptoms secondary benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, some patients are resistant to the therapeutic effects of 5-AR 2 inhibitor. We wished to determine why some benign non-cancerous adult human prostates do not express 5-AR 2, and hypothesized that methylation of 5-AR 2 promoter region correlated with low expression of 5-AR 2 protein.  Methods:   The transition zone of 42 human prostate tissues after radical prostatectomy was used for evaluation. Initially, 21 paraffin embedded samples were used to assess immunoreactivity to 5-AR 2 antibody in non-cancerous BPH samples. In the next 21 samples, fresh frozen prostate transition zone samples without cancer were assessed for immunoreactivity and methylation of the 5-AR 2 promoter using methyl-specific PCR.  Results:   We show that 6/21 (29%) of benign human prostate samples did not express the 5-AR 2 protein. Moreover, the promoter region of 5-AR 2 contains a CpG island that is methylated in benign prostate epithelial cells in culture and also in 39% (7/18) human prostate tissues. We show a strong correlation between methylation of the 5-AR 2 promoter region and absence of 5-AR 2 protein expression (P = 0.0025, Fisher's exact test).

Methods:   After 3D conformal external radiotherapy (3DCRT) to 64-64.4 Gy, 77 patients with non-metastatic locally aggressive prostate cancer have been treated from 2000 to 2004, with HDR-BT using temporary open MRI-guided (192) Ir implants, to escalate the dose in the boost region. Twenty patients (26%) had one lobe involvement (i.e., one sided endorectal MRI, rectal examination, and biopsies) and were boosted to one side of the gland only. A dose of 12, 14, and 16 Gy in two fractions was delivered to 5, 6, and 9 patients, respectively.  Results:   After a median follow-up 69 months, no differences in late rectal toxicity were observed between the unilaterally and bilaterally irradiated cohorts. Although, grade 2 late urinary toxicity was worse in the hemi-irradiated group (P = 0.03), severe grade ≥3 late urinary toxicity at 5 years was not different: 10% versus 8.8% in the unilaterally and bilaterally irradiated cohorts, respectively.

As tumor cells in culture proliferate directly in response to available folic acid, the goal of our study was to determine if there is a similar relationship between patient folate status, and the proliferative capacity of tumors in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Serum folate and/or prostate tissue folate was determined in 87 randomly selected patients undergoing surgery for prostate cancer, and compared to tumor proliferation in a subset.  Results:   Fasting serum folate levels were positively correlated with prostate tumor tissue folate content (n = 15; r = 0.577, P < 0.03). Mean serum folate was 62.6 nM (7.5-145.2 nM), 39.5% of patients used supplements containing folic acid (n = 86).

We recently demonstrated the involvement of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) p110beta in AR transactivation and gene expression. In this study, we determined the upstream signals that lead to PI3K/p110beta activation and AR transactivation after androgen stimulation.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer LAPC-4 and 22Rv1 cell lines were used for the experiments. AR transactivation was assessed using an androgen responsive element-driven luciferase (ARE-LUC) assay. Cell proliferation was examined using BrdU incorporation and MTT assays. Target genes were silenced using small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach. Gene expression was evaluated at the mRNA level (real-time RT-PCR) and protein level (Western blot). PI3K kinase activities were measured using immunoprecipitation-based in vitro kinase assay. The AR-DNA-binding activity was determined using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.  Results:   First, at the cellular plasma membrane, disrupting the integrity of caveolae microdomain with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (M-β-CD) abolished androgen-induced AR transactivation and gene expression. Then, knocking down caveolae structural proteins caveolin-1 or -2 with the gene-specific siRNAs significantly reduced androgen-induced AR transactivation. Next, silencing Gα(s) and Gα(12) genes but not other G-proteins blocked androgen-induced AR transactivation and cell proliferation. Consistently, overexpression of Gα(s) or Gα(12) active mutants enhanced androgen-induced AR transactivation, of which Gα(s) active mutant sensitized the AR to castration-level of androgen (R1881). Most interestingly, knocking down Gα(s) but not Gα(12) subunit significantly suppressed androgen-stimulated PI3K p110beta activation. However, ChIP analysis revealed that both Gα(s) or Gα(12) subunits are involved in androgen-induced AR interaction with the AR target gene PSA promoter region.

However, the signals that regulate MUC1 expression in prostate cancer cells are not well understood.  Methods:   MUC1 expression was studied in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting and assessment of MUC1 promoter activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies were performed to assess androgen receptor (AR) occupancy on the MUC1 promoter. Post-transcriptional regulation of MUC1 expression was assessed by miR-125b-mediated effects on activity of the MUC1 3' untranslated region (3'UTR).  Results:   The present studies demonstrate that AR occupies a consensus AR element on the MUC1 promoter in androgen-dependent LNCaP, but not in androgen-independent DU145 and PC3, prostate cancer cells. The results further show that AR downregulates MUC1 gene transcription. Stable introduction of exogenous AR in PC3 (PC3/AR) cells and then silencing of AR confirmed AR-mediated repression of the MUC1 promoter. AR signaling has also been shown to drive miR-125b expression.

Specimens were taken from the apex, the middle part, and the base of the right-hand side of the prostate. Lymphatic vessels were detected by immunohistochemical stain using an antibody specific for the lymphatic endothelial cells (clone D2-40). The lymphatic vessels were counted in the prostate capsule and the prostatic fascia of each section by light microscopy at low power (100×).  Results:   The median number of lymphatic vessels in the prostatic capsule per prostatic half was 21.0, 14.0, and 21.0 in the apex, middle, and base part of the prostate, respectively. In the prostatic facia the median number of lymphatic vessels per prostatic half was 8.0, 3.0, and 13.0 in the apex, middle, and the base part of the prostate, respectively. In the apex and the middle part the lymphatic vessels in the prostatic fascia were fewer than those in the prostatic capsule.

Riboflavin kinase (RFK) also known as flavokinase is involved in the first step of bioactivation of riboflavin (RF) to form flavin mononucleotide (FMN) which can be subsequently converted to FAD in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by FAD synthetase (FADS). We investigated the involvement of RFK in cisplatin resistance using human prostate cancer PC3 cells. RFK overexpression renders cells resistant not only to cisplatin but also to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and diamide. Furthermore, knockdown of RFK expression induced apoptosis. We demonstrated that overexpression of RFK increased the levels of FAD, FMN and total glutathione and the expression of GR and glutathione S-transferase-π (GSTπ). RFK expression is up-regulated in cisplatin-resistant P/CDP6 cells in addition to FAD, total glutathione level, GR and GSTπ. Knockdown of RFK expression also sensitized both PC3 and P/CDP6 cells to cisplatin. Moreover, cellular levels of RFK expression correlate well with Gleason score, known as a good indicator of patient prognosis.

Five hundred ninety-eight patients with prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) >4 ng/mL or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) participated in this prospective, multicenter study.

Several tumours contained complex chains of balanced (that is, 'copy-neutral') rearrangements that occurred within or adjacent to known cancer genes. Rearrangement breakpoints were enriched near open chromatin, androgen receptor and ERG DNA binding sites in the setting of the ETS gene fusion TMPRSS2-ERG, but inversely correlated with these regions in tumours lacking ETS fusions. This observation suggests a link between chromatin or transcriptional regulation and the genesis of genomic aberrations. Three tumours contained rearrangements that disrupted CADM2, and four harboured events disrupting either PTEN (unbalanced events), a prostate tumour suppressor, or MAGI2 (balanced events), a PTEN interacting protein not previously implicated in prostate tumorigenesis. Thus, genomic rearrangements may arise from transcriptional or chromatin aberrancies and engage prostate tumorigenic mechanisms.""","""['Michael F Berger', 'Michael S Lawrence', 'Francesca Demichelis', 'Yotam Drier', 'Kristian Cibulskis', 'Andrey Y Sivachenko', 'Andrea Sboner', 'Raquel Esgueva', 'Dorothee Pflueger', 'Carrie Sougnez', 'Robert Onofrio', 'Scott L Carter', 'Kyung Park', 'Lukas Habegger', 'Lauren Ambrogio', 'Timothy Fennell', 'Melissa Parkin', 'Gordon Saksena', 'Douglas Voet', 'Alex H Ramos', 'Trevor J Pugh', 'Jane Wilkinson', 'Sheila Fisher', 'Wendy Winckler', 'Scott Mahan', 'Kristin Ardlie', 'Jennifer Baldwin', 'Jonathan W Simons', 'Naoki Kitabayashi', 'Theresa Y MacDonald', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Lynda Chin', 'Stacey B Gabriel', 'Mark B Gerstein', 'Todd R Golub', 'Matthew Meyerson', 'Ashutosh Tewari', 'Eric S Lander', 'Gad Getz', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Levi A Garraway']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Expression profile of MAGI2 gene as a novel biomarker in combination with major deregulated genes in prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2 fusions with oncogenic ETS factors in prostate cancer involve unbalanced genomic rearrangements and are associated with HDAC1 and epigenetic reprogramming.', 'PTEN genomic deletion is an early event associated with ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'Genetic, Environmental, and Nuclear Factors Governing Genomic Rearrangements.', 'Oncogenic ETS Factors in Prostate Cancer.', 'HIB/SPOP inhibits Ci/Gli-mediated tumorigenesis by modulating the RNA Polymerase II components stabilities.', 'Radiotherapy plus immune checkpoint inhibitor in prostate cancer.', 'Somatic structural variation signatures in pediatric brain tumors.', 'Clinical significance of SPOP and APC gene alterations in colorectal cancer in Indian population.', 'Comparative and integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic-wide DNA methylation changes in African American prostate cancer.']"""

Leptin is a candidate for evaluating this hypothesis because it influences fetal development and newborn growth.  Methods:   We measured leptin concentration by ELISA in venous cord blood collected from 70 African-American and 37 white male full-term babies. We measured sex steroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis concentrations previously. Separately by race, we calculated the geometric mean leptin concentration and estimated the geometric mean adjusted for birth and placental weights, mother's age and parity, time of day and season of birth, and sex steroid hormone and IGF axis concentrations by linear regression.  Results:   Leptin was positively correlated with birth (r = 0.34) and placental (r = 0.25) weights, IGF-1 (r = 0.21), and IGF binding protein-3 (r = 0.29) adjusting for race. Unadjusted geometric mean leptin did not differ (P = 0.92) between African Americans (5,280 pg/mL; 95% CI: 4,322-6,451) and whites (5,187 pg/mL; 95% CI: 3,938-6,832).

Methods and materials:   Subjects were 10 consecutive patients who underwent implantation with (125)I stranded seeds via a peripheral-loading technique.

We sought to determine predictors of symptomatic lymphocele after radical prostatectomy (RP) and PLND, and in particular, to determine if the number of drains placed represents an independent predictor.  Methods:   Between January 1999 and June 2007, 4173 consecutive patients underwent bilateral PLND at the time of either open or laparoscopic RP. Lymphoceles were identified in patients undergoing imaging as a result of symptoms suspicious for lymphocele, such as fever, abdominal pain or lower extremity swelling. Routine postoperative imaging was not carried out. Cox proportional hazards analysis was carried out using forced variable entry to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using the number of drains placed, number of nodes removed, RP approach and use of prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as predictors of symptomatic lymphocele.  Results:   There were 164 patients (4%) with a symptomatic lymphocele on follow up, with a median time to presentation of 19 days. The primary presenting complaints were fever in 47%, abdominal pain in 40%, lower extremity swelling in 37%, genital swelling in 25%, groin pain in 22%, abdominal swelling in 9%, and back and flank pain in 6% and 5%, respectively. Median lymphocele diameter was 5 cm. Significant predictors of symptomatic lymphocele on multivariate analysis included number of nodes removed and use of LMWH, but not number of drains placed.

We previously demonstrated that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) showed significantly higher angiotensin II (Ang II) type-1 receptor (AT1R) expression, and that AT1R blockade (ARB) exerted protective effects by inhibiting angiogenesis. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms for the increase of AT1R expression in CRPC has not been fully elucidated yet.  Methods:   In this study we used C4-2 and C4-2AT6 cells, which were PTEN-null, androgen receptor (AR) positive, PSA-producing CRPC cell lines. We investigated the association between phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and AT1R expression, and used LY294002 as a PI3K/Akt inhibitor.  Results:   Western blot analysis revealed C4-2AT6 cells showed significantly higher pAkt expression than C4-2 cells, although there were no significant differences in total Akt (tAkt) expression. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis also revealed significant higher pAkt expression in C4-2AT6 tumors obtained from castrated male nude mice. These results indicated that C4-2AT6 cells acquired elevated pAkt status under androgen-ablated treatment in vitro. Treatment with LY294002 at the same dose reduced the viability of C4-2AT6 more effectively than that of C4-2, reflecting the dependency of cancer cells on PI3K/Akt pathway. The up-regulated AT1R expression in C4-2AT6 cells was reduced by LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, in C4-2 cells, serum starvation induced pAkt up-regulation, which led to an increase of AT1R expression.

Several studies have shown a significant reduction of the troublesome effects when Tamoxifen is concomitantly administered with BIC. However, the results reported in the literature seem to be preliminary and possible interferences could be present. In order to clarify the molecular mechanisms of the combination of the two drugs, we have investigated whether the expression of the proteins belonging to nuclear matrix (NM), one modulator of hormone action, is altered by BIC and/or 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT) in LNCaP cells. We focused above all on heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) a NM protein with a key role in prostate carcinoma.  Methods:   NM proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Modulation and compartmentalization of the androgen receptor and the hnRNP K were studied by Western blotting, confocal microscopy, and immunoprecipitation.  Results:   Proteomic analysis revealed that there is a similarity in the changes of the NM proteins elicited by drugs alone but that their combination does not result in a simple additive effect. Moreover, we found that in the nucleoplasm the androgen receptor and the hnRNP K colocalize in a complex that is highly proximal to DNA and that both proteins were synchronously modulated by BIC and/or 4OHT treatment.

Patients treated with siltuximab presented with higher levels of proliferation and apoptosis markers. Following a single dose, serum concentrations of siltuximab declined in a biexponential manner. This study revealed a decrease in phosphorylation of Stat3 and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases. In addition, gene expression analyses indicate down-regulation of genes immediately downstream of the IL-6 signaling pathway and key enzymes of the androgen signaling pathway.

The role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling in prostate cancer-induced osteoblastic metastasis is not clear. We investigated the role of TGFβ signaling in prostate cancer-induced bone metastasis using a novel human prostate cancer cell line, PacMetUT1.  Methods:   We injected PacMetUT1/Luc-GFP cells in male nude mice by intracardiac and intratibia injections and then investigated the effect of TGFβ signaling abrogation on osteoblastic tumor growth and incidence in vivo by using fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging analysis and quantifying bone and tumor volume by histomorphometry analysis. Osteoclasts were counted using TRAP assay.  Results:   Osteoblastic bone metastasis in skull, rib, and femur was detected after 10-16 weeks of intracardiac injection of the PacMetUT1 cells. Stable knockdown of TGFβ1 with an shRNA resulted in decreased tumor incidence and bone formation when the cells were directly injected into the tibiae. Systemic administration of either a small inhibitor of TGFβ type I receptor kinase or a pan TGFβ binding protein (BG(E) RII) also decreased bone tumor growth and osteoblastic bone formation in vivo after 7 weeks of treatment.

Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its major metabolite 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), exhibit antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo. Several synthetic ring-substituted dihaloDIMs (ring-DIMs) appear to have increased anticancer activity.  Methods:   Inhibition of LNCaP prostate cancer cell growth was measured by a WST-1 cell viability assay. Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Androgen receptor (AR) activation was assessed by measuring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression and using LNCaP cells containing human AR and an AR-dependent probasin promoter-green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct.  Results:   Like DIM, several ring-substituted dihaloDIM analogs, namely 4,4'-dibromo-, 4,4'-dichloro-, 7,7'-dibromo-, and 7,7'-dichloroDIM, significantly inhibited DHT-stimulated growth of LNCaP cells at concentrations ≥1 µM. We observed structure-dependent differences for the effects of the ring-DIMs on AR expression, nuclear AR accumulation and PSA levels in LNCaP cells after 24 hr. Both 4,4'- and 7,7'-dibromoDIM decreased AR protein and mRNA levels, whereas 4,4'- and 7,7'-dichloroDIM had minimal effect. All four dihaloDIMs (10 and 30 µM) significantly decreased PSA protein and mRNA levels. Immuofluorescence studies showed that only the dibromoDIMs increased nuclear localization of AR. All ring-DIMs caused a concentration-dependent decrease in fluorescence induced by the synthetic androgen R1881 in LNCaP cells transfected with wild-type human AR and an androgen-responsive probasin promoter-GFP gene construct, with potencies up to 10-fold greater than that of DIM.

We investigated whether the enzyme telomerase, which is active in cancer cells and in normal stem cells, plays an important role in CPC which can be exploited to neutralize these cells.  Methods:   We used flow cytometry and assays of gene expression, clonogenicity, and invasiveness to isolate and characterize a putative CPC subpopulation from freshly resected human prostatectomy specimens. Telomerase activity was measured by qPCR-based Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP). Telomerase interference was achieved by ectopic expression of a mutated telomerase RNA construct which reprograms telomerase to generate ""toxic"" uncapped telomeres. Treated cells were assayed for apoptosis, proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor formation.  Results:   CPC in prostate tumors expressed elevated levels of genes associated with a progenitor phenotype and were highly clonogenic and invasive. Significantly, CPC telomerase activity was 20- to 200-fold higher than in non-CPC from the same tumors, and CPC were exquisitely sensitive to telomerase interference which induced rapid apoptosis and growth inhibition. Similarly, induction of telomerase interference in highly tumorigenic CPC isolated from a prostate cancer cell line abrogated their ability to form tumor xenografts.  Conclusions:   Human prostate tumors contain a CPC subpopulation with markedly elevated telomerase activity which renders them acutely susceptible to telomerase interference.

Cancer was diagnosed in 41 (29%) of patients with atypia: 26 of 41 (66%) were Gleason 6, 20% were Gleason 7 and 7% were Gleason 8 (Gleason < 6 not reported). There were no significant associations of age, race, family history, PSA, PSA density (PSAd), number of previous biopsies or time to repeat biopsy with cancer diagnosis. In multivariate regression, histological inflammation was associated with an 85% decreased probability of cancer on repeat biopsy (odds ratio; OR 0.15; 95% confidence interval; CI 0.04-0.57; P=0.04). Radical prostatectomy was performed in 14 of 41 (34%) patients with cancer; 6 (43%) were Gleason sum ≥7, 3 (21%) were pT3a and 1 (7%) had lymph node metastases.

The number of open gasless laparoendoscopic single-site surgery, especially minimum incision endoscopic radical prostatectomy (MIES-RRP) is increasing in Japan. The incidence of post-operative inguinal hernia was compared between conventional RRP and MIES-RRP. The medical records of 333 patients who underwent conventional RRP (n=214) or MIES-RRP (n=119) with pelvic lymphadenectomy at our hospital were retrospectively evaluated. There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, pre-operative PSA levels, or previous major abdominal surgery (cholecystectomy, gastrectomy and colectomy), appendectomy or inguinal hernia repair. MIES-RRP was carried out with a 5-8-cm lower abdominal midline incision. Inguinal hernia developed postoperatively in 41 (19%) of the 214 men undergoing conventional RRP during mean follow-up of 58 months (range: 7-60 months). In contrast, 7 (5.9%) of the 119 men receiving MIES-RRP, developed inguinal hernia during mean follow-up of 21 months (range: 13-31 months).

To improve serum stability cyclization of DUP-1 and targeted D-amino acid substitution were carried out.

The properties of modified ligands were investigated in in vitro binding and competition assays. In vivo biodistribution studies were carried out in mice, carrying human prostate tumors subcutaneously. DOTA conjugation resulted in different cellular binding kinetics, rapid in vivo renal clearance and increased tumor-to-organ ratios. Cyclization and D-amino acid substitution increased the metabolic stability but led to binding affinity decrease.

It has been demonstrated that bombesin analogs can be radiolabeled with a variety of radiometals for potential diagnosis and treatment of GRPR-positive tumors. In this regard, several studies have used different chelators conjugated to the 8 C-terminal amino acids of bombesin(7-14) for radiolabeling with (64)Cu. These analogs have demonstrated GRPR-specific small-animal PET of tumors but have various advantages and disadvantages. The objective of this study was to conjugate the previously described (1-N-(4-aminobenzyl)-3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo[6.6.6]-eicosane-1,8-diamine) (SarAr) chelator to bombesin(7-14), radiolabel the conjugate with (64)Cu, and evaluate in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   SarAr was synthesized as previously published and conjugated to bombesin(7-14) by solid-phase peptide synthesis using standard Fmoc chemistry. Succinic acid (SA), 8-aminooctanoic acid (Aoc), and Gly-Ser-Gly (GSG) were used as linkers between SarAr and bombesin(7-14) to yield the resulting SarAr-SA-Aoc-bombesin(7-14) and SarAr-SA-Aoc-GSG-bombesin(7-14) peptides. The unlabeled peptides were evaluated in a competitive binding assay using PC-3 prostate cancer cells and (125)I-Tyr(4)-bombesin to determine the inhibitory concentration of 50%. The peptides were radiolabeled with (64)Cu and evaluated for internalization into PC-3 cells in vitro and for in vivo tumor uptake in mice bearing PC-3 xenografts using biodistribution and small-animal PET/CT studies.  Results:   The competitive binding assay demonstrated that both SarAr-SA-Aoc-bombesin(7-14) and SarAr-SA-Aoc-GSG-bombesin(7-14) bound with high affinity to GRPR with an inhibitory concentration of 50% of 3.5 and 4.5 nM, respectively. Both peptides were radiolabeled with (64)Cu at room temperature without further purification and demonstrated similar internalization into PC-3 cells. In vivo, the radiolabeled peptides demonstrated tumor-specific uptake (13.0 and 8.5 percentage injected dose per gram for (64)Cu-SarAr-SA-Aoc-bombesin(7-14) and (64)Cu-SarAr-SA-Aoc-GSG-bombesin(7-14), respectively, at 1 h) and imaging that was comparable to, or better than, that of the previously reported (64)Cu-labeled bombesin analogs. The (64)Cu-SarAr-SA-Aoc-GSG-bombesin(7-14) had more rapid blood clearance and lower tumor and normal-tissue uptake than (64)Cu-SarAr-SA-Aoc-bombesin(7-14), resulting in similar tumor-to-blood ratios for each analog (15.1 vs. 11.3 for (64)Cu-SarAr-SA-Aoc-bombesin(7-14) and (64)Cu-SarAr-SA-Aoc-GSG-bombesin(7-14), respectively, at 1 h).  Conclusion:   These studies demonstrate that (64)Cu-SarAr-SA-Aoc-bombesin(7-14) and (64)Cu-SarAr-SA-Aoc-GSG-bombesin(7-14) bound with high affinity to GRPR-expressing cells and that these peptides can be used for PET of GRPR-expressing prostate cancer.""","""['Kimberly A Lears', 'Riccardo Ferdani', 'Kexian Liang', 'Alexander Zheleznyak', 'Rebecca Andrews', 'Christopher D Sherman', 'Samuel Achilefu', 'Carolyn J Anderson', 'Buck E Rogers']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['In vitro and in vivo evaluation of a 64Cu-labeled NOTA-Bn-SCN-Aoc-bombesin analogue in gastrin-releasing peptide receptor expressing prostate cancer.', 'PET of tumors expressing gastrin-releasing peptide receptor with an 18F-labeled bombesin analog.', 'MicroPET imaging of a gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-positive tumor in a mouse model of human prostate cancer using a 64Cu-labeled bombesin analogue.', '64Cu-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-9-aminonanoic acid-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2.', '64Cu-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-6-aminohexanoic acid-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2.', 'Development of Radiogallium-Labeled Peptides for Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor β (PDGFRβ) Imaging: Influence of Different Linkers.', 'In Vitro Mouse and Human Serum Stability of a Heterobivalent Dual-Target Probe That Has Strong Affinity to Gastrin-Releasing Peptide and Neuropeptide Y1 Receptors on Tumor Cells.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Radiohalogenated PET and Therapeutic Agents for Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-βAla-Bombesin(7-14) as an agent for pancreas tumor detection in mice.', 'Evaluation of DOTA-chelated neurotensin analogs with spacer-enhanced biological performance for neurotensin-receptor-1-positive tumor targeting.']"""

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a pathologic proliferation of prostatic glandular and stromal tissues; a variety of growth factors and inflammatory processes are inculpated in its pathogenesis. Previously we showed that potent synthetic antagonists of GHRH strongly inhibit the growth of diverse experimental human tumors including prostate cancer by suppressing various tumoral growth factors. The influence of GHRH antagonists on animal models of BPH has not been investigated. We evaluated the effects of the GHRH antagonists JMR-132 given at doses of 40 μg/d, MIA-313 at 20 μg/d, and MIA-459 at 20 μg/d in testosterone-induced BPH in Wistar rats. Reduction of prostate weights was observed after 6 wk of treatment with GHRH antagonists: a 17.8% decrease with JMR-132 treatment; a 17.0% decline with MIA-313 treatment; and a 21.4% reduction with MIA-459 treatment (P < 0.05 for all). We quantified transcript levels of genes related to growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and signal transduction and identified significant changes in the expression of more than 80 genes (P < 0.05). Significant reductions in protein levels of IL-1β, NF-κβ/p65, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) also were observed after treatment with a GHRH antagonist. We conclude that GHRH antagonists can lower prostate weight in experimental BPH. This reduction is caused by the direct inhibitory effects of GHRH antagonists exerted through prostatic GHRH receptors. This study sheds light on the mechanism of action of GHRH antagonists in BPH and suggests that GHRH antagonists should be considered for further development as therapy for BPH.""","""['Ferenc G Rick', 'Andrew V Schally', 'Norman L Block', 'Mehrdad Nadji', 'Karoly Szepeshazi', 'Marta Zarandi', 'Irving Vidaurre', 'Roberto Perez', 'Gabor Halmos', 'Luca Szalontay']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Mechanisms of synergism between antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone and antagonists of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in shrinking experimental benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone inhibit the proliferation of human benign prostatic hyperplasia cells.', 'Antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone inhibit proliferation induced by inflammation in prostatic epithelial cells.', 'Antagonists of growth-hormone-releasing hormone: an emerging new therapy for cancer.', 'Antineoplastic action of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonists.', 'Growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonists protect against hydrochloric acid-induced endothelial injury in vitro.', 'Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone in Endothelial Inflammation.', 'Antagonist of Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone Potentiates the Antitumor Effect of Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in Pleural Mesothelioma.', 'Identification of a novel immune signature for optimizing prognosis and treatment prediction in colorectal cancer.', 'Endocrinology of the Aging Prostate: Current Concepts.']"""

Very limited options are available for the treatment of advanced metastatic prostate cancer. More than 50% of today's anticancer drugs are natural products or derived from a natural origin. To discover new entities with potential to treat prostate cancer at androgen-refractory stages, 36 structurally diverse natural products were screened using functional-based assays. The tested compounds were selected broadly from major secondary metabolites of plants, marine invertebrates, and fungi. These diverse entities were prescreened for their antiinvasive ability against prostate cancer cells, PC-3M, using spheroid disaggregation assay. Active representatives including three selected structural classes, a macrolide, a β-carboline alkaloid, and a phenylmethylene hydantoin (PMH), were then tested for their ability to stabilize junctional complexes and enhance cell-cell adhesion of androgen independent prostate cancer cells. Transepithelial resistance (TER) and paracellular permeability assays were used to elicit the aforementioned properties. These studies led to the emergence of PMHs as a small molecule class from the marine sponge Hemimycale arabica with a unique potential to attenuate CT-stimulated prostate cancer growth, metastasis, paracellular permeability, and enhance TER and cell-cell adhesion of prostate cancer cells. The unique activities of PMHs were validated using several in vitro assays followed by in vivo testing in two mice models. A 3D QSAR was established using SYBYL 8.1-Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) model. This chapter includes the methodology for evaluation of structural and biological properties of new antiinvasive molecules with an exceptional potential to stabilize junctional complexes from diverse natural product sources.""","""['Mudit Mudit', 'Mohammad Khanfar', 'Girish V Shah', 'Khalid A El Sayed']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Discovery, design, and synthesis of anti-metastatic lead phenylmethylene hydantoins inspired by marine natural products.', 'Identification of a small molecule class to enhance cell-cell adhesion and attenuate prostate tumor growth and metastasis.', 'Marine natural products-inspired phenylmethylene hydantoins with potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities via suppression of Brk and FAK signaling.', 'Investigation of the Anti-Prostate Cancer Properties of Marine-Derived Compounds.', 'Anticancer agents from marine sponges.']"""

Germline variants in the gene that encodes the PSA protein (KLK3) have been shown to be associated with both serum PSA levels and prostate cancer. Based on a resequencing analysis of a 56 kb region on chromosome 19q13.33, centered on the KLK3 gene, we fine mapped this locus by genotyping tag SNPs in 3,522 prostate cancer cases and 3,338 controls from five case-control studies. We did not observe a strong association with the KLK3 variant, reported in previous studies to confer risk for prostate cancer (rs2735839; P = 0.20) but did observe three highly correlated SNPs (rs17632542, rs62113212 and rs62113214) associated with prostate cancer [P = 3.41 × 10(-4), per-allele trend odds ratio (OR) = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.67-0.89].

One of the three highly correlated SNPs, rs17632542, introduces a non-synonymous amino acid change in the KLK3 protein with a predicted benign or neutral functional impact. Baseline PSA levels were 43.7% higher in control subjects with no minor alleles (1.61 ng/ml, 95% CI = 1.49-1.72) than in those with one or more minor alleles at any one of the three SNPs (1.12 ng/ml, 95% CI = 0.96-1.28) (P = 9.70 × 10(-5)).

Current treatments have proved inadequate in curing or controlling prostate cancer, and a search for agents for the management of this disease is urgently needed. Survivin plays an important role in both progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer and resistance to chemotherapy. Altered expression of survivin in prostate cancer cells is associated with cancer progression, drug/radiation resistance, poor prognosis, and short patient survival. In the present study, the authors performed a cell-based rapid screen of the Prestwick Chemical Library consisting of 1120 Food and Drug Administration-approved compounds with known safety and bioavailability in humans to identify potential inhibitors of survivin and anticancer agents for prostate cancer. Sanguinarine, a benzophenanthridine alkaloid derived primarily from the bloodroot plant, was identified as a novel inhibitor of survivin that selectively kills prostate cancer cells over ""normal"" prostate epithelial cells. The authors found that sanguinarine inhibits survivin protein expression through protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Sanguinarine induces apoptosis and inhibits growth of human prostate cancer cells and in vivo tumor formation. Administration of sanguinarine, beginning 3 days after ectopic implantation of DU145 human prostate cancer cells, reduces both tumor weight and volume. In addition, sanguinarine sensitized paclitaxel-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming taxol resistance. These results suggest that sanguinarine may be developed as an agent either alone or in combination with taxol for treatment of prostate cancer overexpressing survivin.""","""['Meng Sun', 'Wei Lou', 'Jae Yeon Chun', 'Daniel S Cho', 'Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Jun Chen', 'Jiao Yue', 'Qinghua Zhou', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Genes Cancer""","""['Inhibition of Stat3 activation by sanguinarine suppresses prostate cancer cell growth and invasion.', 'Sanguinarine causes cell cycle blockade and apoptosis of human prostate carcinoma cells via modulation of cyclin kinase inhibitor-cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase machinery.', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 rescues LNCaP prostate cancer cells from sanguinarine-induced apoptosis by a mechanism involving inhibition of nitric oxide synthase activity.', 'Antitumor effects of the benzophenanthridine alkaloid sanguinarine: Evidence and perspectives.', 'Survivin expression and resistance to anticancer treatments: perspectives for new therapeutic interventions.', ""Involvement of AKT/PI3K Pathway in Sanguinarine's Induced Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest in Triple-negative Breast Cancer Cells."", 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Mining Natural Products with Anticancer Biological Activity through a Systems Biology Approach.', 'The Anticancer Effect of Natural Plant Alkaloid Isoquinolines.', 'Sanguinarine Induces Apoptosis in Papillary Thyroid Cancer Cells via Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species.']"""

Methods:   A sample of 84 prostate cancer survivors on ADT were recruited from a register held by the Auckland District Health Board. Participants were mailed a collection of self-report surveys probing quality of life, physical activity and determinants of physical activity.  Result:   Less than half the prostate cancer sample were categorised as physically active, and there was no relationship between physical activity and age, PSA levels, or time on ADT. Compared to a matched control group the sample had lower scores for global quality of life, as well as on the physical and environmental quality of life domains. Results also showed that those prostate cancer survivors classified as active had higher levels of quality of life on average than those classified as insufficiently active. Attitude towards physical activity was the dominant predictor of the intention to be physically active, while perceived behavioural control was the dominant predictor of actual behaviour.  Conclusions:   Our findings describe a positive relationship between physical activity and quality of life in men with prostate cancer currently undergoing ADT. However, only half the sample was physically active, indicating that physical activity interventions aimed at prostate cancer survivors are of utility.

New molecular markers are needed for proper pre-treatment risk stratification of patients. Our aim was to assess the value of altered expression of syndecan-1 and -2 as a marker for predicting biochemical relapse in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy. The expression of syndecan-1 and -2 was examined by immunohistochemical staining in a series of 60 paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients with localized prostate cancer. Ten specimens from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were used as non-malignant controls. Semiquantitative analysis was performed to evaluate the staining patterns. To investigate the prognostic value, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were performed and compared by a log-rank test. In benign samples, syndecan-1 was expressed in basal and secretory epithelial cells with basolateral membrane localisation, whereas syndecan-2 was expressed preferentially in basal cells. In prostate cancer samples, the expression patterns of both syndecans shifted to granular-cytoplasmic localisation. Survival analysis showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) between normal and altered expression of syndecan-1 and -2 in free prostate-specific antigen recurrence survival curves.

Although they have been considered to be potentially malignant neuroendocrine neoplasms, some previously reported cases were associated with a carcinoma component that might have altered the outcome. Only 8 histologically well-documented cases of pure carcinoid tumors of the bladder and 1 of the prostatic urethra have been reported in the literature. In this study, we describe 6 additional primary pure carcinoid tumors arising in the bladder (5 cases) or prostatic urethra (1 case). Patients (4 male, 2 female) ranged in age from 45 to 60 years (average, 55 y) and presented with hematuria (n = 5 of 6), obstruction (n = 1 of 6), or for concurrent genitourinary disease (n = 1 of 6). All 6 cases shared gross and microscopic findings. Cystoscopic examination showed small, smooth surfaced, or polypoid nodules. The 5 cases in the bladder were all located within or near the trigone and bladder neck region. Microscopically, these 6 tumors were subepithelial and confined within the lamina propria, associated with adjacent cystitis cystica et glandularis. The tumors were composed of uniform, cuboidal, or columnar cells with finely stippled chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli in a prominent pseudoglandular pattern composed of acinar and cribriform structures. The cells had moderate-to-abundant cytoplasm and basally located Paneth cell-like eosinophilic granules. Although occasional atypical cells with prominent nucleoli could be seen, mitotic activity was absent or rare and cases lacked necrosis. Neuroendocrine differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in all 6 cases. All tumors were completely excised by biopsies. There was no evidence of disease recurrence or progression in all 6 patients, including 3 patients who had clinical follow-up for >4 years. Primary pure carcinoid tumors of the urinary bladder (and prostatic urethra) have distinct pathologic characteristics, with their prominent pseudoglandular features leading to difficulty in diagnosis. They are likely to have a very favorable clinical outcome, and should be distinguished from mixed carcinoid tumors or urothelial carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation that show focal carcinoid-like histologic features.""","""['Ying-bei Chen', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Carcinoid tumor in the urinary bladder: unreported features.', 'Primary carcinoid tumor of the urinary bladder with prominent subnuclear eosinophilic granules.', 'Renal carcinoid tumor: a clinicopathologic study of 21 cases.', 'Squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder: a clinicopathologic analysis of 45 cases.', 'Urachal carcinomas of the nonglandular type: salient features and considerations in pathologic diagnosis.', 'Primary heterologous carcinosarcoma (metaplastic carcinoma) of the urinary bladder: a clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural analysis of eight cases and a review of the literature.', 'Management of Primary Female Urethral Adenocarcinoma: Two Rare Case Reports and Literature Review.', 'Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the urinary bladder expressing GATA 3.', 'Neuroendocrine Neoplasms of the Female Genitourinary Tract: A Comprehensive Overview.', 'Clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes of bladder neuroendocrine carcinomas: a population-based study.', 'Update of the International Consultation on Urological Diseases on bladder cancer 2018: non-urothelial cancers of the urinary bladder.']"""

A broad range of vascular endothelial (n = 250), other mesenchymal (n = 973), and epithelial tumors (n = 657) was examined to determine the use of ERG immunohistochemistry in surgical pathology. Only immunostains with ERG-positive normal endothelia (internal control) were considered valid, and only nuclear staining was considered to be positive. In adult tissues, ERG was restricted to endothelial cells and to a subset of bone marrow precursors, but early fetal mesenchyme and subpopulations of fetal cartilage were also positive. In vascular tumors, ERG was expressed in endothelia of all hemangiomas and lymphangiomas, and typically extensively expressed in 96 of 100 angiosarcomas, 42 of 43 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, and all 26 Kaposi sarcomas.

To investigate the impact of Akt activity on AR homeostasis, we treated androgen-dependent LNCaP and LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells with Akt inhibitor. Akt inhibition decreased AR expression, suggesting that Akt activity was required for regulation of AR protein levels. However, while androgen-independent LNCaP-abl cells also showed diminished AR protein levels in response to Akt inhibition, treatment of androgen-independent LNCaP-AI cells failed to alter AR protein levels upon similar treatment, suggesting that AR protein levels in these androgen-independent prostate cells were regulated by mechanisms independent of Akt activation. Regulation of AR, downstream of activated Akt, also was observed in vivo when examining transgenic mice that overexpress constitutively active mutant myristoylated (myr)-Akt1 in the prostate. Transgenic mice expressing activated myr-Akt1 exhibited higher levels of AR mRNA and protein. Expression of activated myr-Akt1 did not alter prostate cell growth and no significant size differences between prostate tissues derived from transgenic animals were observed when comparing transgenic mice with wild-type mice. Still, transgenic mice overexpressing Akt exhibited higher levels of γH2AX and phosphorylated Chk2 in prostate tissue. These changes in markers associated with oncogene-induced senescence confirmed significant altered signaling in the transgenic mouse model. Overall, results presented here suggest that AR levels are regulated by the Akt pathway.""","""['Susan Ha', 'Rachel Ruoff', 'Nicole Kahoud', 'Thomas F Franke', 'Susan K Logan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Artemisinin disrupts androgen responsiveness of human prostate cancer cells by stimulating the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of the androgen receptor protein.', 'Interleukin-4 enhances prostate-specific antigen expression by activation of the androgen receptor and Akt pathway.', 'Crosstalking between androgen and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms of prostate cancer cell survival after inhibition of AR expression.', 'Akt in prostate cancer: possible role in androgen-independence.', 'CHRM4/AKT/MYCN upregulates interferon alpha-17 in the tumor microenvironment to promote neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer.', 'AKT, a Key Transmitter of HIF-1α and AR Signaling Pathways, Has a Critical Role in the Apigetrin-Mediated Anti-Cancer Effects in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Racial disparity in prostate cancer in the African American population with actionable ideas and novel immunotherapies.', 'Mechanisms of Resistance to Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Radioligand Therapy in a Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'Brassicasterol from Edible Aquacultural Hippocampus abdominalis Exerts an Anti-Cancer Effect by Dual-Targeting AKT and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.']"""

In an attempt to further investigate its prognostic value, we analyzed the association of tertiary Gleason pattern in Gleason score ≤ 7 tumors with pathologic stage and biochemical disease-free survival.  Material and methods:   A total of 331 radical prostatectomy specimens were analyzed retrospectively. The primary, secondary, and the tertiary patterns were evaluated by reviewing all of the pathologic slides. TGC was defined as Gleason grade pattern 4 or 5 for Gleason score < 7 tumors and Gleason grade pattern 5 for Gleason score 7 tumors. The pathologic prognostic factors, (extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle and lymph node invasion, surgical margin status) of Gleason score < 7, 3+4, and 4+3 tumors with or without TGC were compared. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test, and the influence of TGC was assessed in a Cox regression model.  Results:   TGC observed more frequently with higher Gleason scores (21% of the GS < 7 cases, 23% of the GS 3+4 cases, and 58% of the GS 4+3 cases). In terms of adverse pathologic prognostic factors and BRFS, GS < 7 tumors with TGC behaved significantly worse than GS < 7 tumors without TGC (P = 0.01 and P = 0.001, respectively) with properties similar to GS 3+4 tumors without TGC. Gleason score 3+4 and 4+3 tumors without TGC were statistically similar and had better features than corresponding tumors of same Gleason score with TGC. Furthermore, Gleason score 7 tumors with TGC had similar features with GS 8-10 tumors. During follow-up, 73 (22%) subjects had PSA recurrence. In the Cox regression model TGC was an independent variable for BRFS (HR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.39-4.98, P = 0.003).  Conclusion:   According to the present study, 3 different prognostic groups were observed; good prognostic group: GS < 7, intermediate prognostic group: GS < 7+TGC, GS 3+4, and GS 4+3, and finally bad prognostic group: GS (3+4)+TGC, GS (4+3)+TGC, GS > 7.

IMRT and 3D-hCRT were planned using eight and seven nonopposed coplanar fields of 6- and 23-MV. Dose-volume histograms for target volume and organs at risk were compared for both techniques.  Results:   IMRT provided similar conformality but better homogeneity (p=0.021) than 3D-hCRT plans, despite slightly higher maximal point dose rates (101.9% vs. 100.9%, p=0.050). 3D-hCRT plans required fewer monitor units than did IMRT (289 vs. 607, p=0.008). Dose to bladder, penile bulb, and femoral heads were lower with IMRT than with 3D-hCRT (p=0.008-0.028). No differences were observed for dose to urethra and the entire rectum. Mean dose to rectal wall was lower with IMRT than with 3D-hCRT (25.1 vs. 26.5Gy, p=0.028).

The use of services up to 6 months after the treatment start date was obtained from hospital databases and direct costs were estimated by micro-cost calculation. Information on the clinical characteristics of patients and treatments was collected prospectively. Costs were compared by using nonparametric tests comparing medians (Kruskall-Wallis) and a semi-logarithmic multiple regression model.  Results:   Among the 398 patients included, the cost difference among treatments was statistically significant: medians were € 3,229.10, € 5,369.00 and € 6,265.60, respectively, for the groups of patients treated with external 3D conformal radiotherapy, brachytherapy and radical retropublic prostatectomy, (p<0.001).

[(18)F]FECH is actively transported into mammalian cells, becomes phosphorylated by choline kinase and gets incorporated into the cell membrane after being metabolized to phosphatidylcholine. So far, its synthesis is a two-step procedure involving at least one HPLC purification step. To allow a wider dissemination of this tracer, finding a purification method avoiding HPLC is highly desirable and would result in easier accessibility and more reliable production of [(18)F]FECH.  Methods:   [(18)F]FECH was synthesized by reaction of 2-bromo-1-[(18)F]fluoroethane ([(18)F]BFE) with dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) in DMSO. We applied a novel and very reliable work-up procedure for the synthesis of [(18)F]BFE. Based on a combination of three different solid-phase cartridges, the purification of [(18)F]BFE from its precursor 2-bromoethyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonate (BENos) could be achieved without using HPLC. Following the subsequent reaction of the purified [(18)F]BFE with DMAE, the final product [(18)F]FECH was obtained as a sterile solution by passing the crude reaction mixture through a combination of two CM plus cartridges and a sterile filter. The fully automated synthesis was performed using as well a Raytest SynChrom module (Raytest, Germany) or a Scintomics HotboxIII module (Scintomics, Germany).  Results:   The radiotracer [(18)F]FECH can be synthesized in reliable radiochemical yields (RCY) of 37±5% (Synchrom module) and 33±5% (Hotbox III unit) in less than 1 h using these two fully automated commercially available synthesis units without HPLC involvement for purification. Detailed quality control of the final injectable [(18)F]FECH solution proved the high radiochemical purity and the absence of Kryptofix2.2.2, DMAE and DMSO used in the course of synthesis. Sterility and bacterial endotoxin testing following standard procedures verified that the described production method for [(18)F]FECH is suitable for human applications.  Conclusions:   The routine production of [(18)F]FECH with sufficient RCYs was established by reliable and fast solid-phase extraction purifications of both the secondary labeling precursor [(18)F]BFE and the final product [(18)F]FECH, avoiding complex and sensitive HPLC equipment. The purity of the product was >95%, rendering the tracer suitable for human application. The newly developed purification procedure for [(18)F]BFE significantly reduces the complexity of the automated synthesis unit, hence reducing the cost for routine production in a clinical setup and allowing easy transfer to different synthesis modules.""","""['Jörn Schmaljohann', 'Esther Schirrmacher', 'Björn Wängler', 'Carmen Wängler', 'Ralf Schirrmacher', 'Stefan Guhlke']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Development of (18)F-fluoroethylcholine for cancer imaging with PET: synthesis, biochemistry, and prostate cancer imaging.', 'Fully automated preparation of 11Ccholine and 18Ffluoromethylcholine using TracerLab synthesis modules and facilitated quality control using analytical HPLC.', 'An improved automated one-pot synthesis of O-(2-18Ffluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18FFET) based on a purification by cartridges.', '18FFluoroethylcholine.', '18FFluoro-1,2-2H4choline.']"""

We previously used prostate tumor cells overexpressing the HA synthesizing enzyme HAS3 or the clinically relevant hyaluronidase Hyal1 to show that excess HA production suppresses tumor growth, while HA turnover accelerates spontaneous metastasis from the prostate. Here, we examined pathways responsible for effects of HAS3 and Hyal1 on tumor cell phenotype. Detailed characterization of cell cycle progression revealed that expression of Hyal1 accelerated cell cycle re-entry following synchronization, whereas HAS3 alone delayed entry. Hyal1 expressing cells exhibited a significant reduction in their ability to sustain ERK phosphorylation upon stimulation by growth factors, and in their expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21.

Here, we investigated the expression of PCDH10 in different normal adult tissues and in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines. PCDH10 was widely expressed in normal tissues with higher levels in the prostate. The expression of PCDH10 was markedly reduced or silenced in prostate cancer cell lines compared with normal adult prostate tissue. Decreased PCDH10 expression was correlated with the methylation status of the PCDH10 promoter. Furthermore, the DNA demethylating agent 5'-azacytidin restored PCDH10 expression by suppressing PCDH10 promoter methylation in prostate cancer cell lines. Treatment with Trichostatin A alone had no significant effect on the expression of PCDH10 but enhanced the effect of 5'-azacytidin. In conclusion, we found that the decreased PCDH10 expression in prostate cancer cells was associated with the aberrant methylation of PCDH10 promoter CGI.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) constitute a family of structurally related polypeptides of 146 amino acids, which exhibit a wide spectrum of biologic activities, including angiogenesis or the formation of a vascular network. FGFs are mitogenic towards many mesodermal and ectodermal cell types, and can also induce and/or inhibit differentiation of cells (2). These heparin-binding factors are categorized as FGF-1 through FGF-10. Acidic FGF, or FGF-1, is found mostly in brain and other neural tissues. Basic FGF, or FGF- 2, a protein of 18 kDa mw, is one of the most ubiqitous growth factors. It is found in numerous benign and cancerous human and animal tissues, including kidney, prostate, and bladder (3-6). In some cases it has also been demonstrated to have potential as a tumor marker (7-11). One group reported greater recovery of both FGF-2 protein and FGF-2 mRNA from renal-cancer tissue compared to equal amounts of normal renal tissue (5). Furthermore, when purified FGF-2 from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is added exogenously to other established renal tumorcell lines and endothelial cell lines, it demonstrates significant mitogenic activity (6).

Interestingly, among the previously reported SCD-derived peptides produced by proteolytic cleavage of SCD, a peptide spanning amino acids 130-162 of SCD (SCD-CoRNR) contained the CoRNR box motif (LFLII) and enhanced AR transcriptional activity. In contrast, a mutant SCD-CoRNR in which Leu136 was replaced by Ala had no effect on AR transcriptional activity. Moreover, SCD-CoRNR directly interacted with AR and inhibited RIP140 suppression of AR transactivation. Knockdown of the SCD gene by SCD microRNA suppressed AR transactivation with decreased cell proliferation, suggesting that SCD may regulate the proliferation of LNCaP cells via modulation of AR transcriptional activity. Moreover, ectopic expression of SCD in LNCaP cells facilitated LNCaP tumor formation and growth in nude mice.

A variety of parameters are evaluated relating to both the planning itself (optimization and calculation time) and the plans that result. Results of this comparative study are in line with previously published data, and the planning process is streamlined to a point where the RapidArc optimization time takes 15 ± 1.3 minutes.

We examined the importance of AR binding to DNA in prostate cancer cells in which proliferation in the absence of hormone was profoundly (∼ 90%) dependent on endogenous AR and where the receptor was not up-regulated or mutated but was predominantly nuclear. Here, ARE-mediated promoter activation and the binding of AR to a known ARE in the chromatin remained entirely androgen dependent, and the cells showed an androgen-responsive gene expression profile with an unaltered sensitivity to androgen dose. In the same cells, a different set of genes primarily enriched for cell division functions was activated by AR independently of hormone and significantly overlapped the signature gene overexpression profile of hormone ablation-insensitive clinical tumors. After knockdown of endogenous AR, hormone depletion-insensitive cell proliferation and AR apoprotein-dependent gene expression were rescued by an AR mutant that was unable to bind to ARE but that could transactivate through a well-established AR tethering protein. Hormone depletion-insensitive AR binding sites in the chromatin were functional, binding, and responding to both the wild-type and the mutant AR and lacked enrichment for canonical or noncanonical ARE half-sites.

For each modelling strategy we estimate a confidence score based on the same repeated bootstraps.

This prompted us to investigate how NP or saposin C can function in cells. We constructed plasmids expressing saposin C or a chimeric peptide of a viral TAT transduction domain and saposin C (TAT-saposin C) with His-tag. Intracellular localization of saposin C and NP was predominantly shown in transfected cells, while TAT-saposin C was detected around membrane and in cytosol by immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, induction of the AR expression and activation of the AR transcriptional function were observed in cells transfected with saposin C or TAT-saposin C, compared to control cells transfected with an empty plasmid. The effects of saposin C and TAT-saposin C on AR activity were examined in the presence of inhibitors of GPCR, MAPK1/2, and PI3K/Akt. Interestingly, we found that these inhibitors only affect AR activities in cells with TAT-saposin C expression but not with saposin C expression. Immunostaining images showed that co-localization of saposin C, Src, and the AR occurred in transfected cells. Physical interactions of saposin C/NP, Src, and the AR were then demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Blockage of Src activity by specific inhibitor led to a decrease in the saposin C-mediated enhancement of AR transactivity, suggesting that intracellular expression of saposin C caused stimulation of AR expression and activity by associations with Src in LNCaP cells.

Our results showed that GBA preferentially suppressed AR(+) PCa cell growth than AR(-) PCa cells. GBA induced a caspase-mediated apoptosis that was attenuated by a general caspase inhibitor. Subapoptotic GBA downregulated AR protein in LNCaP cells primarily through promoting its proteasomal degradation, and inhibited AR-dependent transcription without affecting AR nuclear translocation. Whereas docking simulations predicted binding of GBA to the AR ligand binding domain with similarities and differences with the AR antagonist drug bicalutamide (Bic), LNCaP cell culture assays did not detect agonist activity of GBA. GBA and Bic exerted greater than additive inhibitory effect on cell growth when used together. Subapoptotic GBA induced G(1) arrest associated with an inhibition of cyclin/CDK4/6 pathway, especially cyclin D(1) without the causal involvement of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitory proteins P21(Cip1) and P27(Kip1) . In summary, the novelty of GBA as an anti-AR compound resides in the distinction between GBA and Bic with respect to AR protein turnover and a lack of agonist effect.

Tissue samples from 240 patients who received radical prostatectomy for PCa were obtained. CD147 expression in these samples was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal antibody specifically against CD147. Increased expression of CD147 was correlated with higher Gleason scores (GS), positive surgical margin, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure, metastasis and reduced overall survival.

Total mesorectal excision (TME) improves local recurrence and survival rates, and does not hamper recognition and sparing of hypogastric and pelvic splanchnic nerves. It is not known how laparoscopic rectal resection could change functional complication rates.  Materials and methods:   From a global series of 1,216 laparoscopic interventions for colorectal diseases, 35 cases of males less than 70 years old, undergoing rectal resection and TME for a T1-3M0 medium and low rectal cancer were selected. Urinary and sexual functions after the operations were retrospectively recorded by means of specific tools (International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and IIEF questionnaires, respectively).  Results:   None of the patients necessitated permanent or intermittent catheterization. More than half the patients had no complaints about urinary functions; about one third had nocturia; 72% of the patients had an IPSS less that 10, and no case of IPSS worse that 31 was recorded. Sexual desire was reduced and spontaneous erectile function was impaired in almost half the cases, while induced erections were possible in about 90% of cases; about 70% of patients still had the possibility of penetration and a normal ejaculation and orgasm after the intervention.  Discussion and conclusions:   The present series confirms previous data and contribute to the creation of a benchmark specifically related to the laparoscopic approach to which surgeons should face when informing the patients before the operation.

To selectively kill LHR-expressing tumors, granzyme B (GrB) was linked to a protein in which both chains of human chorionic gonadotropin were yoked together (YCG).  Methods:   GrB-YCG was expressed and secreted from insect Sf9 cells. Its GrB enzymatic activity and binding affinity for hLHR were then characterized. The differential cytotoxicity of GrB-YCG versus GrB alone was tested in a panel of LHR-expressing tumor cells by SRB assay, and the mechanisms involved in the cell death were investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis.  Results:   GrB-YCG was successfully expressed and secreted from Sf9 insect cells and purified from cell culture supernatants. The serine protease activity of GrB-YCG was equivalent to that of human recombinant GrB. An in vitro hormone binding assay revealed that the GrB-YCG molecule also retained the ability to bind to the LHR receptor with an affinity similar to that of native hCG. Upon cell binding, GrB-YCG was rapidly internalized into LHR-expressing human ovarian cancer cells and produced selective and potent tumor cell killing by inducing apoptosis through activation of caspase-3.

While prostate cancers that express high levels of HER-2 are resistant to the killing effects of trastuzumab, they can be targeted for selective gene expression and destruction by lentiviruses with envelope proteins engineered to bind to this therapeutic antibody. More importantly, after intravenous injection, this trastuzumab-bound lentivirus is able to target castration-resistant prostate tumor xenografts, albeit with low efficiency. This proof of principle opens up multiple possibilities for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer using a viral-based therapy. However, to be safe and more effective, the viral vectors must target prostate cancer cells more selectively and efficiently. A higher degree of specificity and efficiency of cancer cell targeting can be achieved by engineering viral vectors to bind to a specific cell surface marker and by controlling the expression of the therapeutic payload at transcriptional level, with a tissue-specific promoter, and at the translational level, with a regulatory sequences inserted into either the 5'UTR or 3'UTR regions of the therapeutic gene(s). The latter would be designed to ensure that translation of this mRNA occurs exclusively in malignant cells. Furthermore, in order to obtain a potent anti-tumor effect, viral vectors would be engineered to express pro-apoptotic genes, intra-cellar antibodies/nucleotide aptamers to block critical proteins, or siRNAs to knockdown essential cellular mRNAs. Alternatively, controlled expression of an essential viral gene would restore replication competence to the virus and enable selective oncolysis of tumor cells.

A number of algorithms have been proposed to obtain such classifications. These algorithms usually require parameter optimization to obtain accurate results depending on the type of data. Additionally, it is highly critical to find an optimal set of markers among those up or down regulated genes that can be clinically utilized to build assays for the diagnosis or to follow progression of specific cancer types. In this paper, we employ a mixed integer programming based classification algorithm named hyper-box enclosure method (HBE) for the classification of some cancer types with a minimal set of predictor genes. This optimization based method which is a user friendly and efficient classifier may allow the clinicians to diagnose and follow progression of certain cancer types.  Methodology/principal findings:   We apply HBE algorithm to some well known data sets such as leukemia, prostate cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), small round blue cell tumors (SRBCT) to find some predictor genes that can be utilized for diagnosis and prognosis in a robust manner with a high accuracy. Our approach does not require any modification or parameter optimization for each data set. Additionally, information gain attribute evaluator, relief attribute evaluator and correlation-based feature selection methods are employed for the gene selection.

Conclusions/significance:   The performance of our algorithm overall was better than the other algorithms reported in the literature and classifiers found in WEKA data-mining package.

For instance, prostate cancer metastasis is associated with the infiltration of lymphocytes into advanced tumours and the upregulation of two tumour-necrosis-factor family members: receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) and lymphotoxin. But the source of RANKL and its role in metastasis have not been established. RANKL and its receptor RANK control the proliferation of mammary lobuloalveolar cells during pregnancy through inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (IκB) kinase-α (IKK-α), a protein kinase that is needed for the self-renewal of mammary cancer progenitors and for prostate cancer metastasis. We therefore examined whether RANKL, RANK and IKK-α are also involved in mammary/breast cancer metastasis. Indeed, RANK signalling in mammary carcinoma cells that overexpress the proto-oncogene Erbb2 (also known as Neu), which is frequently amplified in metastatic human breast cancers, was important for pulmonary metastasis. Metastatic spread of Erbb2-transformed carcinoma cells also required CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, whose major pro-metastatic function was RANKL production. Most RANKL-producing T cells expressed forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), a transcription factor produced by regulatory T cells, and were located next to smooth muscle actin (SMA)(+) stromal cells in mouse and human breast cancers. The dependence of pulmonary metastasis on T cells was replaceable by exogenous RANKL, which also stimulated pulmonary metastasis of RANK(+) human breast cancer cells. These results are consistent with the adverse impact of tumour-infiltrating CD4(+) or FOXP3(+) T cells on human breast cancer prognosis and suggest that the targeting of RANKL-RANK can be used in conjunction with the therapeutic elimination of primary breast tumours to prevent recurrent metastatic disease.""","""['Wei Tan', 'Weizhou Zhang', 'Amy Strasner', 'Sergei Grivennikov', 'Jin Q Cheng', 'Robert M Hoffman', 'Michael Karin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Immunology: Pro-metastatic T(Reg)cells get RANKed.', 'Tumour immunology: Pro-metastatic T(Reg) cells get RANKed.', 'RANK ligand mediates progestin-induced mammary epithelial proliferation and carcinogenesis.', 'RANKL inhibition: a promising novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.', 'Bone metastasis and RANKL.', 'Activation of NF-κB by the RANKL/RANK system up-regulates snail and twist expressions and induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mammary tumor cell lines.', 'Combining RANK/RANKL and ERBB-2 targeting as a novel strategy in ERBB-2-positive breast carcinomas.', 'Role of exosomes in the development of the immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Metabolic Health and Disease: A Role of Osteokines?', 'The effect of denosumab on disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) of breast cancer patients with neoadjuvant treatment: a GeparX translational substudy.', 'Construction of a fatty acid metabolism-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and immune response in breast cancer.', 'Metastasis of breast cancer to bones alters the tumor immune microenvironment.']"""

We and others have shown that host restriction factors APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F), which are expressed in human PBMCs, inhibit XMRV in transient-transfection assays involving a single cycle of viral replication. However, the recovery of infectious XMRV from human PBMCs suggested that XMRV can replicate in these cells despite the expression of APOBEC3 proteins. To determine whether XMRV can replicate and spread in cultured PBMCs even though it can be inhibited by A3G/A3F, we infected phytohemagglutinin-activated human PBMCs and A3G/A3F-positive and -negative cell lines (CEM and CEM-SS, respectively) with different amounts of XMRV and monitored virus production by using quantitative real-time PCR. We found that XMRV efficiently replicated in CEM-SS cells and viral production increased by >4,000-fold, but there was only a modest increase in viral production from CEM cells (<14-fold) and a decrease in activated PBMCs, indicating little or no replication and spread of XMRV. However, infectious XMRV could be recovered from the infected PBMCs by cocultivation with a canine indicator cell line, and we observed hypermutation of XMRV genomes in PBMCs. Thus, PBMCs can potentially act as a source of infectious XMRV for spread to cells that express low levels of host restriction factors. Overall, these results suggest that hypermutation of XMRV in human PBMCs constitutes one of the blocks to replication and spread of XMRV.

Androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) directed against the AR ligand-binding domain do not fully inhibit androgen-dependent signaling critical for PCa progression. Thus, information that could direct the development of more effective ADTs is desired. Systems and bioinformatics approaches suggest that considerable variation exists in the mechanisms by which AR regulates expression of effector genes, pointing to a role for secondary transcription factors. A combination of microarray and in silico analyses led us to identify a 158-gene signature that relies on AR along with the transcription factor SRF (serum response factor), representing less than 6% of androgen-dependent genes. This AR-SRF signature is sufficient to distinguish microdissected benign and malignant prostate samples, and it correlates with the presence of aggressive disease and poor outcome. The AR-SRF signature described here associates more strongly with biochemical failure than other AR target gene signatures of similar size. Furthermore, it is enriched in malignant versus benign prostate tissues, compared with other signatures. To our knowledge, this profile represents the first demonstration of a distinct mechanism of androgen action with clinical relevance in PCa, offering a possible rationale to develop novel and more effective forms of ADT.""","""['Hannelore V Heemers', 'Lucy J Schmidt', 'Zhifu Sun', 'Kevin M Regan', 'S Keith Anderson', 'Kelly Duncan', 'Dan Wang', 'Song Liu', 'Karla V Ballman', 'Donald J Tindall']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Identification of a RhoA- and SRF-dependent mechanism of androgen action that is associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Protein Kinase N1 control of androgen-responsive serum response factor action provides rationale for novel prostate cancer treatment strategy.', 'Relationship between serum response factor and androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AR activates YAP/TAZ differentially in prostate cancer.', 'Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase in Health and Cancer.', 'General Features and Novel Gene Signatures That Identify Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Epithelial Cancers.', 'Discovery proteomics defines androgen-regulated glycoprotein networks in prostate cancer cells, as well as putative biomarkers of prostatic diseases.', 'Derivation and Application of Molecular Signatures to Prostate Cancer: Opportunities and Challenges.']"""

Results:   We quantified 9,622 external radiotherapy procedures of which 6,009 were associated with the five pathologies that involved the highest workloads. Of these, 905 were performed in rectal cancer.

Conclusions:   The ""radiotherapy utilisation rate"" for rectal cancer was equivalent to the estimated optimum rate as defined on the basis of reference groups. The therapy utilised developed chronologically in parallel with the available scientific evidence.

It remains unclear whether hypofractionation will provide a significant therapeutic benefit in the treatment of prostate cancer, and whether there are different fractionation sensitivities for different stages of disease. In order to address this, multiple primary datasets have been collected for analysis.  Methods and materials:   Seven datasets were assembled from institutions worldwide. A total of 5969 patients were treated using external beams with or without androgen deprivation (AD). Standard fractionation (1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction) was used for 40% of the patients, and hypofractionation (2.5-6.7 Gy per fraction) for the remainder. The overall treatment time ranged from 1 to 8 weeks. Low-risk patients comprised 23% of the total, intermediate-risk 44%, and high-risk 33%. Direct analysis of the primary data for tumor control at 5 years was undertaken, using the Phoenix criterion of biochemical relapse-free survival, in order to calculate values in the linear-quadratic equation of k (natural log of the effective target cell number), α (dose-response slope using very low doses per fraction), and the ratio α/β that characterizes dose-fractionation sensitivity.  Results:   There was no significant difference between the α/β value for the three risk groups, and the value of α/β for the pooled data was 1.4 (95% CI = 0.9-2.2) Gy. Androgen deprivation improved the bNED outcome index by about 5% for all risk groups, but did not affect the α/β value.  Conclusions:   The overall α/β value was consistently low, unaffected by AD deprivation, and lower than the appropriate values for late normal-tissue morbidity. Hence the fractionation sensitivity differential (tumor/normal tissue) favors the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy schedules for all risk groups, which is also very beneficial logistically in limited-resource settings.""","""['Raymond Miralbell', 'Stephen A Roberts', 'Eduardo Zubizarreta', 'Jolyon H Hendry']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In regard to Miralbell et al.

Results:   The GMM analysis identified three latent classes of oncology patients and FCs with distinct trajectories of state anxiety: Low Stable (n = 93, 36.9%), Intermediate Decelerating (n = 82, 32.5%), and High (n = 77, 30.6%) classes. Younger participants, women, ethnic minorities, and those with children at home were more likely to be classified in the High anxiety class. Higher levels of trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, at the initiation of RT, were associated with being in the High anxiety class.  Conclusions:   Subgroups of patients and FCs with high, intermediate, and low mean levels of anxiety during and after RT were identified with GMM.

Aim:   To provide the first prospective randomized comparison on the functional and oncological outcomes of LRP and RALRP for the treatment of the clinically localized PCa.  Methods:   Between 2007 and 2008, 128 consecutive male patients were randomized in two groups and treated by a single experienced surgeon with traditional LRP (Group I-64 patients) or RALRP (Group II-64 patients) in all cases with intent of bilateral intrafascial nerve sparing.  Main outcome measures:   Primary end point was to compare the 12 months erectile function (EF) outcomes. Complication rates, continence outcomes, and oncological results were also compared. The sample size of our study was able, with an adequate power (1-beta > 0.90), to recognize as significant large differences (above 0.30) between incidence proportions of considered outcomes.  Results:   No statistically significant differences were observed for operating time, estimated blood loss, transfusion rate, complications, rates of positive surgical margins, rates of biochemical recurrence, continence, and time to continence. However, the 12-month evaluation of capability for intercourse (with or without phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors) showed a clear and significant advantage of RALRP (32% vs. 77%, P < 0.0001). Time to capability for intercourse was significantly shorter for RALRP. Rates of return to baseline International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-6) EF domain score questionnaires (questions 1-5 and 15) (25% vs. 58%) and to IIEF-6 > 17 (38% vs. 63%) were also significantly higher for RALRP (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.008, respectively).

Aim:   To investigate determinants of patients' desire to preserve sexual activity before RP and surgeons' final decision to perform a nerve-sparing RP (NSRP).  Methods:   Overall, 2,408 prostate cancer patients, candidates to RP, from 136 urologic departments across the Italian territory were evaluated in a multicenter prospective observational study. All patients underwent RP, according to single-center indications and procedures.  Main outcome measures:   Age, body mass index, previous benign prostatic hyperplasia history, preoperative tumor characteristics, quality of life through the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and the University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI), erectile function through the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), desire to preserve sexual activity, NS operative outcomes, and surgical margins status were recorded.  Results:   Overall, 1,667 were interested to preserve sexual activity. Age, physical component summary of SF12 (PCS-12), sexual function score of UCLA-PCI, and IIEF-5 score were the main determinants of such interest. Only 1,246 patients were suitable for a NSRP according to guidelines. Surgeons performed a non-NSRP (NNSRP) in 1,234 patients, a unilateral NSRP in 318 and a bilateral NSRP in 856. Age, bioptical Gleason score, percentage of positive cores, PCS-12, and patient's desire to preserve sexual activity were the main determinants of final decision for a NSRP. Surgeons performed a NSRP in 424 not suitable and in 121 not interested patients. Positive surgical margins in not suitable patients submitted to NSRP were not higher if compared to that obtained after NNSRP in the same subgroup.

Methods and results:   The study included 162 consecutive patients treated by radical retropubic prostatectomy and bilateral lymphadenectomy for clinically localized prostatic carcinoma. A variable degree of retraction artefact was present in all 162 analysed tumours. The extent of retraction artefact in prostatic carcinomas ranged from 5% to 55% with a median value of 15% (interquartile range 10-25%). We found no correlation between the extent of retraction artefact in the tumours and patient's age (P=0.608), preoperative (P=0.362) and postoperative (P=0.279) Gleason score or lymph node metastases (P=0.084). In contrast, the extent of retraction artefact correlated with high preoperative prostate-specific antigen (P<0.001), short follow-up time (P<0.001), seminal vesicle invasion and/or extracapsular extension of the tumour (T3 stage tumours) (P<0.001) and positive surgical margins (P<0.001).

In our studies, HN1 gene structure was characterized. HN1 expression was found to be epidermal growth factor-responsive in PC-3 cells, and protein expression was also upregulated in PC-3 and LNCaP but not in DU145 cells. Additionally, HN1 was found to be downregulated by the specific AKT inhibitor wortmannin but not with PI3K or MAPK inhibitors, LY294002 and PD98059, respectively, in PC-3 and MCF-7 cells. Further, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HN1 resulted in considerable increase in Akt((S473)) and GSK3β((S9),(Y216)) phosphorylations; moreover, subsequent accumulation of β-catenin, increase in c-myc expression, and nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 were observed in PC-3 cells. Knockdown of HN1 also resulted in prolongation of G(1) phase in cell cycle, increasing tetraploidy, presumably because of cells escaping from abnormal mitosis in PC-3 cells. Consistently, overexpression of HN1 reversed the cell-cycle-specific observations, resulted in accumulation of cells in G(2)/M, and reduced the proliferation rate, which were investigated using flow cytometry and methylthiazol tetrazolium assays. As activating mutations of β-catenin have been demonstrated in late-stage tumors, and β-catenin stabilization was correlated with poor prognosis in previous reports, epidermal growth factor-upregulated HN1 expression might have a role in deregulating the AKT-GSK3β((S9))-mediated signaling as a novel compensating mechanism.""","""['Lokman Varisli', 'Ceren Gonen-Korkmaz', 'Bilge Debelec-Butuner', 'Burcu Erbaykent-Tepedelen', 'Hamid Syed Muhammed', 'Nuray Bogurcu', 'Fahri Saatcioglu', 'Kemal Sami Korkmaz']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""DNA Cell Biol""","""['Androgen regulated HN1 leads proteosomal degradation of androgen receptor (AR) and negatively influences AR mediated transactivation in prostate cells.', 'LW-213 induces G2/M cell cycle arrest through AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway in human breast cancer cells.', 'ARS-interacting multi-functional protein 1 induces proliferation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells by accumulation of β-catenin via fibroblast growth factor receptor 2-mediated activation of Akt.', 'Inappropriate activation of androgen receptor by relaxin via beta-catenin pathway.', 'Acquired radioresistance of cancer and the AKT/GSK3β/cyclin D1 overexpression cycle.', 'HN1 Is Enriched in the S-Phase, Phosphorylated in Mitosis, and Contributes to Cyclin B1 Degradation in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Thirdhand Smoke May Promote Lung Adenocarcinoma Development through HN1.', 'HN1 interacts with γ-tubulin to regulate centrosomes in advanced prostate cancer cells.', 'Skeletal muscle proteomes reveal downregulation of mitochondrial proteins in transition from prediabetes into type 2 diabetes.', 'Angiogenesis-related non-coding RNAs and gastrointestinal cancer.']"""

Methods:   Lys3-bombesin and hydrazinonicotinamide-Gly-Gly-Cys-NH2 (HYNIC-GGC) peptides were conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNP, 20 nm) to prepare a multifunctional system of HYNIC-GGC-AuNP-Lys3-bombesin by means of spontaneous reaction of the thiol (Cys) present in HYNIC-GGC sequence and the amine of Lys3-bombesin. The nanoconjugate was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), IR, UV-Vis, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Technetium-99m labelling through the HYNIC-GGC ligand was carried out using EDDA/tricine as coligands and SnCl2 as reducing agent with further size exclusion chromatography purification. Radiochemical purity was determined by size exclusion HPLC and ITLC-SG analyses. In vitro binding studies were carried out in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells (GRP-r positive cells).

Qualitative analysis was iterative using a grounded theory approach involving a series of immersion/crystallization cycles. Men who had abnormal PSA tests either actively sought out screening because of family history of prostate cancer or received their screening as part of a routine physical examination. Men who were never screened avoided testing primarily because they perceived they were at low risk due to lack of urinary symptoms, lack of family history of prostate cancer, or beliefs that healthy behaviors can prevent prostate cancer. Other reasons for not getting screened included: fear of cancer, embarrassment over digital rectal exam, confusion over the screening procedure, and skepticism over the benefits of screening. Some men were willing to get screened if structural barriers were removed, their doctor recommended it, or if they were prompted by urinary symptoms. None had discussions with physicians about potential risks of prostate cancer screening. Men received their health information through lay media, friends or family members. Educating men in the community through mass media about benefits and limitations of prostate cancer screening may be more effective to promote and facilitate shared decision making with their physicians.""","""['Jeanne M Ferrante', 'Eric K Shaw', 'John G Scott']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Community Health""","""[""What influences men's decision to have a prostate-specific antigen test?

The aim of our study is to analyze the clinicopathologic findings and the prognostic information comparing the clinical with the pathological T2 substaging of patients submitted to radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Using the 2009 TNM staging system, 169 patients with clinical stage T2a were compared with patients with stage T2b/T2c, and 142 patients with pathological stage T2a were compared with patients with stage T2c. All surgical specimens were step-sectioned. Using a semiquantitative point-count method for tumor extent evaluation, all insignificant tumors were excluded from analysis. Clinicopathological characteristics were compared between the groups. Biochemical recurrence data were compared using log-rank analysis, and significant predictors of time to biochemical recurrence were determined using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   There was significant difference in biochemical recurrence rates between men with clinical T2a versus T2b/T2c tumors but no difference between men with pathological T2a versus T2c tumors. No patient in pathologic stage T2b was found. On multivariate analysis, clinical stage T2b/T2c was independent predictor of time to biochemical recurrence following surgery but not pathological stage T2c.

A major proportion of the morbidity and mortality related to prostate cancer can be traced to the burden of bone metastases.

While bone-homing radioisotopes, bisphosphonates, and RANK ligand inhibitors have demonstrated reduction in bone pain and/or other skeletal-related events, further advances into definitive improvements in survival and/or global quality of life are required.

Despite the frequent occurrence of ERG gene rearrangements in acinar carcinoma, the incidence of these rearrangements in prostatic small cell carcinoma is unclear. In addition, molecular markers to distinguish prostatic small cell carcinomas from lung and bladder small cell carcinomas may be clinically useful. We examined the occurrence of ERG gene rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization in prostatic, bladder and lung small cell carcinomas. We also examined the expression of ERG, androgen receptor (AR) and NKX3-1 by immunohistochemistry in prostatic cases. Overall, 45% (10/22) of prostatic small cell carcinoma cases harbored ERG rearrangements, whereas no cases of bladder or lung small cell carcinomas showed ERG rearrangement (0/12 and 0/13, respectively). Of prostatic small cell carcinoma cases, 80% (8/10) showed ERG deletion and 20% (2/10) showed ERG translocation. In 83% (5/6) of prostatic small cell carcinoma cases in which a concurrent conventional prostatic acinar carcinoma component was available for analysis, there was concordance for the presence/absence of ERG gene rearrangement between the different subtypes. ERG, AR and NKX3-1 protein expression was detected in a minority of prostatic small cell carcinoma cases (23, 27 and 18%, respectively), while these markers were positive in the majority of concurrent acinar carcinoma cases (66, 83 and 83%, respectively). The presence of ERG rearrangements in nearly half of the prostatic small cell carcinomas is a similar rate of rearrangement to that found in prostatic acinar carcinomas. Furthermore, the high concordance rate of ERG rearrangement between the small cell and acinar components in a given patient supports a common origin for these two subtypes of prostate cancer. Finally, the absence of ERG rearrangement in bladder or lung small cell carcinomas highlights the utility of detecting ERG rearrangement in small cell carcinomas of unknown primary for establishing prostatic origin.""","""['Tamara L Lotan', 'Nilesh S Gupta', 'Wenle Wang', 'Antoun Toubaji', 'Michael C Haffner', 'Alcides Chaux', 'Jessica L Hicks', 'Alan K Meeker', 'Charles J Bieberich', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'George J Netto']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Frequent TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement in prostatic small cell carcinoma detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization: the superiority of fluorescence in situ hybridization over ERG immunohistochemistry.', 'ERG rearrangement in small cell prostatic and lung cancer.', 'Increased androgen receptor gene copy number is associated with TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement in prostatic small cell carcinoma.', 'NKX3.1 Suppresses TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Rearrangement and Mediates Repair of Androgen Receptor-Induced DNA Damage.', 'ERG protein expression as a biomarker of prostate cancer.', 'The Identification of CELSR3 and Other Potential Cell Surface Targets in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'Spatial Gene Expression Analysis Reveals Characteristic Gene Expression Patterns of De Novo Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Coexisting with Androgen Receptor Pathway Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in driving lineage reprogramming in treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.']"""

In 3 different regions of the country, oncologists were invited to participate in the study, through a self-administered questionnaire which was handed to them inquiring about their knowledge, attitude, and referral practices for sperm cryopreservation. Only one-half knew about intracytoplasmic sperm injection, oncologists rated their perception of the importance of cryopreservation as 7.8 ± 1.8. Their referral practice was very poor; less than 20% refer their patients to a specialist. Factors that were considered important to start discussion of cryopreservation were type of cancer, age of patient, number of children, marital status, and cost. Religion was not deemed as important as was anticipated. With regards to female fertility preservation, oncologists showed a positive attitude as revealed from their positive perception, however, their referral practices was very poor. Several gaps were present in the knowledge of oncologists, which could influence their attitude and in turn was reflected on their poor practice.

In the placebo arm, a 10 μg/dL increase in lycopene was associated with a 7% (95% CI: 14-0) reduced risk of cancer diagnosed following an elevated PSA or abnormal DRE, which are cancers that best match those detected in screened populations. However, a 10 μg/dL increase in lycopene was also associated with an 8% (95% CI: 1-16) increased risk of cancer diagnosed without a biopsy prompt, which are cancers generally not detected. These findings were similar for low- and high-grade cancer.  Conclusion:   This study does not support a role for lycopene in prostate cancer prevention.  Impact:   Scientists and the public should understand that early studies supporting an association of dietary lycopene with reduced prostate cancer risk have not been replicated in studies using serum biomarkers of lycopene intake. Recommendations of professional societies to the public should be modified to reflect the likelihood that increasing lycopene intake will not affect prostate cancer risk.""","""['Alan R Kristal', 'Cathee Till', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Xiaoling Song', 'Irena B King', 'Marian L Neuhouser', 'Christine B Ambrosone', 'Ian M Thompson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Serum Retinol and Carotenoid Concentrations and Prostate Cancer Risk: Results from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and risk of prostate cancer: results from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Inflammation in Benign Prostate Tissue and Prostate Cancer in the Finasteride Arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Five-alpha-reductase Inhibitors for prostate cancer prevention.', 'Update on chemoprevention of prostate cancer.', 'The Anti-Cancer Activity of Lycopene: A Systematic Review of Human and Animal Studies.', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.', 'Association of Retinol and Carotenoids Content in Diet and Serum With Risk for Colorectal Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Anti-prostate cancer protection and therapy in the framework of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine - comprehensive effects of phytochemicals in primary, secondary and tertiary care.', 'Angioprevention of Urologic Cancers by Plant-Derived Foods.']"""

However, the exact mechanism by which isoprenoid biosynthesis inhibitors induce autophagy has not been well established. We hypothesized that inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS) by bisphosphonates would induce autophagy by depleting cellular geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) and impairing protein geranylgeranylation. Herein, we show that an inhibitor of FDPS (zoledronate) and an inhibitor of GGDPS (digeranyl bisphosphonate, DGBP) induce autophagy in PC3 prostate cancer and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as measured by accumulation of the autophagic marker LC3-II. Treatment of cells with lysosomal protease inhibitors [(2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (E-64d) and pepstatin A] in combination with zoledronate or digeranyl bisphosphonate further enhances the formation of LC3-II, indicating that these compounds induce autophagic flux. It is noteworthy that the addition of exogenous GGPP prevented the accumulation of LC3-II and impairment of Rab6 (a GGTase II substrate) geranylgeranylation by isoprenoid pathway inhibitors (lovastatin, zoledronate, and DGBP). However, exogenous GGPP did not restore isoprenoid pathway inhibitor-induced impairment of Rap1a (a GGTase I substrate) geranylgeranylation. In addition, specific inhibitors of farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase I are unable to induce autophagy in our system. Furthermore, the addition of bafilomycin A1 (an inhibitor of autophagy processing) enhanced the antiproliferative effects of digeranyl bisphosphonate. These results are the first to demonstrate that bisphosphonates induce autophagy. Our study suggests that induction of autophagy in PC3 cells with these agents is probably dependent upon impairment of geranylgeranylation of GGTase II substrates.""","""['Brian M Wasko', 'Amel Dudakovic', 'Raymond J Hohl']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase: Role in human health, disease and potential therapeutic target.', 'Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase inhibition induces apoptosis that is dependent upon GGPP depletion, ERK phosphorylation and caspase activation.', 'Digeranyl bisphosphonate inhibits geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase.', 'Mono- and dialkyl isoprenoid bisphosphonates as geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase inhibitors.', 'Recent Advances in the Development of Mammalian Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Synthase Inhibitors.', 'Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase: Role in human health, disease and potential therapeutic target.', 'Denosumab Can Prevent Collapse in Patients with Early-Stage Steroid-Induced Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head by Inhibiting Osteoclasts and Autophagy.', 'A Mathematical Model of In Vitro Cellular Uptake of Zoledronic Acid and Isopentenyl Pyrophosphate Accumulation.', 'The Two-Faced Role of Autophagy in Endometrial Cancer.', 'Ibandronate promotes autophagy by inhibiting Rac1-mTOR signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo.']"""

For example, mislabeling cancerous lesions as benign is typically more detrimental than mislabeling benign lesions as cancerous. Unfortunately, methods for modifying the performance of Markov random field (MRF) based classifiers are noticeably absent from the literature, and thus most such systems restrict their performance to a single, static operating point (a paired sensitivity/specificity). To address this deficiency we present weighted maximum posterior marginals (WMPM) estimation, an extension of maximum posterior marginals (MPM) estimation. Whereas the MPM cost function penalizes each error equally, the WMPM cost function allows misclassifications associated with certain classes to be weighted more heavily than others. This creates a preference for specific classes, and consequently a means for adjusting classifier performance. Realizing WMPM estimation (like MPM estimation) requires estimates of the posterior marginal distributions. The most prevalent means for estimating these--proposed by Marroquin--utilizes a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Though Marroquin's method (M-MCMC) yields estimates that are sufficiently accurate for MPM estimation, they are inadequate for WMPM. To more accurately estimate the posterior marginals we present an equally simple, but more effective extension of the MCMC method (E-MCMC). Assuming an identical number of iterations, E-MCMC as compared to M-MCMC yields estimates with higher fidelity, thereby 1) allowing a far greater number and diversity of operating points and 2) improving overall classifier performance. To illustrate the utility of WMPM and compare the efficacies of M-MCMC and E-MCMC, we integrate them into our MRF-based classification system for detecting cancerous glands in (whole-mount or quarter) histological sections of the prostate.""","""['James Peter Monaco', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Class-specific weighting for Markov random field estimation: application to medical image segmentation.', 'A gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multivariate maximum likelihood estimates and posterior distributions: mixture dose-response assessment.', 'Searching for convergence in phylogenetic Markov chain Monte Carlo.', 'Fully Bayesian estimation of Gibbs hyperparameters for emission computed tomography data.', 'Accelerating MCMC algorithms.', 'Multistage Segmentation of Prostate Cancer Tissues Using Sample Entropy Texture Analysis.', 'Class-specific weighting for Markov random field estimation: application to medical image segmentation.']"""

The existing variable selection methods may be precluded by full model advocates when we build a prediction model owing to their estimation bias and selection bias in right-censored time-to-event data. If our objective is to optimize predictive performance by some criterion, we can often achieve a reduced model that has a little bias with low variance, but whose overall performance is enhanced. To accomplish this goal, we propose a new variable selection approach that combines Stepwise Tuning in the Maximum Concordance Index (STMC) with Forward Nested Subset Selection (FNSS) in two stages. In the first stage, the proposed variable selection is employed to identify the best subset of risk factors optimized with the concordance index using inner cross-validation for optimism correction in the outer loop of cross-validation, yielding potentially different final models for each of the folds. We then feed the intermediate results of the prior stage into another selection method in the second stage to resolve the overfitting problem and to select a final model from the variation of predictors in the selected models. Two case studies on relatively different sized survival data sets as well as a simulation study demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to select an improved and reduced average model under a sufficient sample and event size compared with other selection methods such as stepwise selection using the likelihood ratio test, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and lasso. Finally, we achieve better final models in each dataset than their full models by most measures.

To investigate the effects of these mutations at the molecular level, in the present study we prepared four different structural variants of the bacterial Rhodobacter sphaeroides CytcO (cytochrome aa(3)), each carrying one amino-acid residue replacement corresponding to the following substitutions identified in the above-mentioned study: Asn11Ser, Ala122Thr, Ala341Ser and Val380Ile (residues Asn25, Ser168, Ala384 and Val423 in the R. sphaeroides oxidase). This bacterial CytcO displays essentially the same structural and functional characteristics as those of the mitochondrial counterpart. We investigated the overall activity, proton pumping and internal electron- and proton-transfer reactions in the structural variants. The results show that the turnover activities of the mutant CytcOs were reduced by at most a factor of two. All variants pumped protons, but in Ser168Thr, Ala384Ser and Val423Ile we observed slight internal proton leaks. In all structural variants the internal electron equilibrium was slightly shifted away from the catalytic site at high pH (10), resulting in a slower observed ferryl to oxidized transition. Even though the effects of the mutations were relatively modest, the results suggest that they destabilize the proton-gating machinery. Such effects could be manifested in the presence of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient resulting in less efficient energy conservation.

Several studies indicate that survivin down-regulation sensitizes human tumor cells of different histological origins to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. We assessed the effect of survivin gene expression on the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We also examined the antitumor sensitization effect of survivin inhibition in 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) treatment for prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   We knocked down gene expression levels of survivin using siRNA against survivin in vitro and in vivo. We then assessed survivin expression in 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) treatment and examined the antitumor sensitization effect of survivin inhibition using siRNA in 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) treatment of hormone resistant prostate cancer cells.  Results:   In vitro and in vivo siRNA against survivin significantly inhibited cell and tumor growth compared with control siRNA. In LNCaP and PC3 cells 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) decreased survivin gene expression and inhibited cell proliferation. However, survivin gene expression and cell proliferation were not inhibited in DU145 cells but after siRNA transfection against survivin DU145 cell proliferation was inhibited by 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3).

Materials and methods:   A tissue microarray of 152 prostate cancers was constructed and stained for factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and 2α, and glucose transporter 1 as a prototypical downstream target of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α. Correlation analysis was done between these variables, and between factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1, and clinical and pathological variables, including prostate specific antigen as a surrogate of recurrence.  Results:   Factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 was expressed in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus in 86.5% of tumors, including exclusive cytoplasmic expression in 51.3% and exclusive nuclear expression in 5.3%. Any nuclear and exclusive expression of factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor was associated with poor prognosis on univariate analysis (p = 0.007 and 0.042, respectively). On multivariate analysis men with nuclear expression in tumors were twice as likely to experience recurrence (p = 0.034).  Conclusions:   Factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is widely expressed in prostate tumors. Its differential subcellular expression suggests that regulation of its expression is an important factor in the activity of the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway.

However, the mechanisms by which human metastasis cell adhesion molecule/MUC18 stimulates progression are poorly understood. To investigate this and determine whether human metastasis cell adhesion molecule/MUC18 may act as a possible tumor progression gene, we studied the effect of its enforced expression on LNCaP cell tumorigenesis.  Materials and methods:   We subcutaneously co-injected a metastasis cell adhesion molecule/MUC18 expressing LNCaP clone and control clones/cells with Matrigel™ into nude mice, observed tumor formation of these cells and measured tumors at different times. To understand the mechanisms we also determined the expression of several downstream key effectors of metastasis cell adhesion molecule/MUC18 in subcutaneous tumors and compared them to those in previously obtained orthotopic (prostatic) tumors.  Results:   Tumors derived from human metastasis cell adhesion molecule/MUC18 expressing LNCaP clones/cells appeared about 18 days earlier than the empty vector transfected clone/cells. Enforced expression of human metastasis cell adhesion molecule/MUC18 also increased tumor take 2-fold, tumorigenicity 10 to 12-fold and final tumor weight 5-fold. Enforced expression appeared to render the cells with increased levels of the proliferation indexes Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the survival index phospho-AKT, and the angiogenesis indexes vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and CD31. However, it did not significantly render the cells with altered levels of various apoptosis indexes.

We investigated whether zolendronic acid also inhibits prostate cancer cell growth by autophagy (type II programmed cell death).  Materials and methods:   We investigated the induction of autophagy in the PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP and CRW22Rv1 cell lines upon zolendronic acid treatment. LC3-II protein formation was detected by Western blot. LC3-II incorporation into autophagosomes was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Acidic organelle formation was detected by acridine orange staining. Rescue experiments using an apoptosis inhibitor and/or an autophagy inhibitor were performed by MTT assay.  Results:   Autophagy induction was detected by formation of the LC3-II protein after exposure to 100 μM zolendronic acid. LC3-II and caspase-3 processing was detected 6 days after treatment. Acidic organelles were detectable by acridine orange staining and immunofluorescence showed round-up and condensed staining of LC3-II, suggesting autophagosome formation in the cytoplasm during autophagic cell death. Cell growth was rescued only by administering an apoptosis and autophagy inhibitor during zolendronic acid treatment, indicating that zolendronic acid induces prostate cancer death by apoptotic and autophagic cell death.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge we report the first study showing that zolendronic acid markedly inhibits human prostate cancer cell growth through autophagic cell death. Zolendronic acid shows its anticancer activity via apoptosis and autophagy.

Recent evidence has called this paradigm into question. In this study we investigate the effect of testosterone therapy in men with untreated prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We report the results of prostate biopsies, serum prostate specific antigen and prostate volume in symptomatic testosterone deficient cases receiving testosterone therapy while undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer.  Results:   A total of 13 symptomatic testosterone deficient men with untreated prostate cancer received testosterone therapy for a median of 2.5 years (range 1.0 to 8.1). Mean age was 58.8 years. Gleason score at initial biopsy was 6 in 12 men and 7 in 1. Mean serum concentration of total testosterone increased from 238 to 664 ng/dl (p <0.001). Mean prostate specific antigen did not change with testosterone therapy (5.5 ± 6.4 vs 3.6 ± 2.6 ng/ml, p = 0.29). Prostate volume was unchanged. Mean number of followup biopsies was 2. No cancer was found in 54% of followup biopsies. Biopsies in 2 men suggested upgrading, and subsequent biopsies in 1 and radical prostatectomy in another indicated no progression. No local prostate cancer progression or distant disease was observed.  Conclusions:   Testosterone therapy in men with untreated prostate cancer was not associated with prostate cancer progression in the short to medium term. These results are consistent with the saturation model, ie maximal prostate cancer growth is achieved at low androgen concentrations. The longstanding prohibition against testosterone therapy in men with untreated or low risk prostate cancer or treated prostate cancer without evidence of metastatic or recurrent disease merits reevaluation.""","""['Abraham Morgentaler', 'Larry I Lipshultz', 'Richard Bennett', 'Michael Sweeney', 'Desiderio Avila Jr', 'Mohit Khera']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Editorial comment.', 'Re: Testosterone therapy in men with untreated prostate cancer.

This computationally inexpensive Fortran program is based on the strategy of exhaustive search and specifically designed to screen shared data (target genes, miRNAs and pathways) available from PicTar and DIANA-MicroT 3.0 databases. As far as we know this is the first software designed to filter data retrieved from available miRNA databases. SID1.0 takes advantage of the standard Fortran intrinsic functions for manipulating text strings and requires ASCII input files. In order to demonstrate SID1.0 applicability, some miRNAs expected from the literature to associate with cancerogenesis (miR-125b, miR-148a and miR-141), were randomly identified as main entries for SID1.0 to explore matching sequences of mRNA targets and also to explore KEGG pathways for the presence of ID codes of targeted genes. Besides genes and pathways already described in the literature, SID1.0 has proven to useful for predicting other genes involved in prostate carcinoma. These latter were used to identify new deregulated miRNAs: miR-141, miR-148a, miR-19a and miR-19b.

Objective:   To analyse the incidence and disease-specific mortality for prostate cancer (PCa) in men with an initial PSA <3.0 ng/ml.  Design, setting and participants:   From November 1993 to December 1999, a total of 42,376 men identified from population registries in the Rotterdam region (55-74 yr of age) were randomised to an intervention or control arm. A total of 19,950 men were screened during the first screening round.  Intervention:   A PSA <3.0 ng/ml was below the biopsy threshold. PCa cases were identified at rescreens every 4 yr or as interval cancers.  Measurements:   Distribution of incidence, aggressiveness, and disease-specific mortality of PCa per PSA range was measured. Causes of death were evaluated by an independent committee, and follow-up was complete until 31 December 2008.  Results and limitations:   From 1993 to 2008, 915 PCa cases were diagnosed in 15,758 men (5.8%) with an initial PSA <3.0 ng/ml and a median age of 62.3 yr. Median overall follow-up was 11 yr. PCa incidence increased significantly with higher initial PSA levels. Aggressive PCa (clinical stage ≥T2c, Gleason score ≥8, PSA >20 ng/ml, positive lymph nodes, or metastases at diagnosis) was detected in 66 of 733 screen-detected PCa cases (9.0%) and 72 of 182 interval-detected PCa cases (39.6%). Twenty-three PCa deaths occurred in the total population (0.15%), with an increasing risk of PCa mortality in men with higher initial PSA values.  Conclusions:   The risk of PCa, aggressive PCa and PCa mortality in a screening population with initial PSA <3.0 ng/ml increases significantly with higher initial PSA levels.

We determined whether accurate pretherapy assessment has a significant role in forecasting health related quality of life after definitive treatment for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We examined data from CaPSURE™ to identify men who underwent treatment for localized prostate cancer between 1995 and 2006. We restricted our analysis to those who completed the UCLA-PCI survey before and after therapy. We performed multiple logistic regression for the outcome measure (decrease in each of the 6 UCLA-PCI domains) on the predictor (whether the physician performed an assessment that was in agreement with patient reported pretherapy status) while adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.  Results:   Of the 2,195 men included in the analysis 1,411 (64%) did not have pretherapy function documented. Of the remaining 784 men only 354 (45%) had pretherapy physician assessments that were concordant with patient reported status. On multiple logistic regression analysis men who were not assessed were more likely to experience decreased sexual function (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.23-2.23), sexual bother (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09-1.97) and bowel function (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02-2.00) according to post-therapy UCLA-PCI scores than those who were assessed and concordant.

However, few studies have investigated the influence of stains on outcomes in men with prostate cancer. Thus, we evaluated the association of statin use with pathological tumor characteristics and prostate cancer recurrence after prostatectomy in a retrospective cohort.  Materials and methods:   A total of 2,399 patients of 1 surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital who underwent radical prostatectomy in 1993 to 2006 and had not previously received hormone or radiation therapy were followed for recurrence. The surgeon routinely asked during the preoperative consultation what medications the men were using. Additional information on statin use was obtained from a mailed survey. We estimated the association of statin use with nonorgan confined disease (pT3a/b or N1) and high grade disease (Gleason sum [4 + 3] or greater) using logistic regression (OR), and recurrence using Cox proportional hazards regression (HR).  Results:   The 16.1% of men who used a statin at prostatectomy were statistically significantly less likely to have nonorgan confined disease than nonusers (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50-0.85). Statin use was inversely associated with high grade disease only in men with preoperative PSA 10 ng/ml or greater (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13-0.93, p-interaction = 0.02). The HR of recurrence among men who used a statin for 1 year or greater compared to nonusers was 0.77 (95% CI 0.41-1.42).

These can cause significant sexual and urinary side effects. Focal therapy offers a novel strategy that targets the cancer rather than the prostate in an attempt to preserve tissue and function.  Materials and methods:   A prospective, ethics committee approved trial was conducted to determine the side effects of focal therapy using high intensity focused ultrasound. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (T2-weighted, dynamic contrast enhanced, diffusion-weighted) and template transperineal prostate mapping biopsies were used to identify unilateral disease. Genitourinary side effects and quality of life outcomes were assessed using validated questionnaires. Posttreatment biopsies were performed at 6 months and followup was completed to 12 months.  Results:   A total of 20 men underwent high intensity focused ultrasound hemiablation. Mean age was 60.4 years (SD 5.4, range 50 to 70) with mean prostate specific antigen 7.3 ng/ml (SD 2.8, range 3.4 to 11.8). Of the men 25% had low risk and 75% had intermediate risk cancer. Return of erections sufficient for penetrative sex occurred in 95% of men (19 of 20). In addition, 90% of men (18 of 20) were pad-free, leak-free continent while 95% were pad-free. Mean prostate specific antigen decreased 80% to 1.5 ng/ml (SD 1.3) at 12 months. Of the men 89% (17 of 19, 1 refused biopsy) had no histological evidence of any cancer, and none had histological evidence of high volume or Gleason 7 or greater cancer in the treated lobe. In addition, 89% of men achieved the trifecta status of pad-free, leak-free continence, erections sufficient for intercourse and cancer control at 12 months.

While a number of data channels, ranging from the macro (e.g. MRI) to the nano-scales (proteins, genes) are now being routinely acquired for disease characterization, one of the challenges in predicting patient outcome and treatment response has been in our inability to quantitatively fuse these disparate, heterogeneous data sources. At the Laboratory for Computational Imaging and Bioinformatics (LCIB)(1) at Rutgers University, our team has been developing computerized algorithms for high dimensional data and image analysis for predicting disease outcome from multiple modalities including MRI, digital pathology, and protein expression. Additionally, we have been developing novel data fusion algorithms based on non-linear dimensionality reduction methods (such as Graph Embedding) to quantitatively integrate information from multiple data sources and modalities with the overarching goal of optimizing meta-classifiers for making prognostic predictions.

Recently we and other groups observed that LXR agonists suppressed proliferation of multiple human cancer cell lines in vitro as well as suppressed the growth and progression of prostate tumor xenografts in nude mice. LXR agonists appear to cause G1 cell cycle arrest in cancer cells by reducing the protein expression level of Skp2, cyclin A2, cyclin D1, and the phosphorylation of Rb, while increasing the protein expression level of cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) and p53. LXR agonist also suppressed the oncogenic activity of β-catenin, an important regulator in Wnt signaling, as well as the proliferation in human colon cancer cells. Phytosterols, the plant equivalent of mammalian cholesterol, have been shown to be agonists for LXRs. Intake of phytosterol-rich diets reduced the incidence of colon cancer.

The inclusion criteria were prostate-specific antigen level>4 ng/mL or a suspicious finding on digital rectal examination. The images were interpreted by a highly experienced radiologist and were considered negative for PCa in all cases.

Methods:   The prognostic value of prostate volume, PSA at diagnosis, Gleason score, risk category, and clinical stage for favorable initial postcryoablation PSA (<0.6 ng/mL) was assessed in a risk-stratified cohort from the Cryo On Line Data (COLD) Registry. The cohort was substratified by prostate volume, <50 cm(3) (n = 2316) and ≥50 cm(3) (n = 369). The incidence of incontinence, rectal fistula, and potency is reported.  Results:   Prostate volume was not a statistically significant predictor of favorable PSA outcome (P = .153, univariate, 0.101, multivariate). Favorable PSA (<0.6 ng/mL) occurred in 80% (<50 cm(3)) and 83% (≥50 cm(3)) of patients, respectively. PSA at diagnosis (P = .02) and Gleason score (P < .0001) by univariate analysis, and clinical stage (P < .0001) and risk category (P < .0001) by multivariate analysis predicted for favorable PSA outcomes. Initial postcryoablation PSA ≥0.6 ng/mL was associated with significantly worse 24-month biochemical progression. No statistical difference in incidence of incontinence (3.3% vs 2.1%) retention (1.1% vs 2.6%), potency (30.3% vs 32.2%) or fistula (0.6% vs 0.2%) based on prostate volume was identified.

Materials and methods:   A total of 717 men underwent radical cystoprostatectomy (RC) for bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) between 1978 and 2002. Analysis of prostatic urethral involvement by transitional cell carcinoma (pTCC) and of invasive prostatic involvement by TCC was performed according to recurrence, presence of carcinoma in situ (CIS) and multifocality, previous intravesical chemotherapy, grade, stage and location of bladder tumor, presence of CIS in precystectomy transurethral resection (TUR) and indication for RC.

However, GnRH receptors are expressed in multiple extrapituitary tissues, although their physiological relevance is not fully understood. GnRH agonists are employed extensively in steroid deprivation therapy, especially to suppress testosterone in prostate cancer. Because GnRH agonist treatment is associated with increased coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, we investigated the impact of GnRH on cardiomyocyte contractile function. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from mouse hearts and mechanical and intracellular Ca(2+) properties were evaluated, including peak shortening amplitude (PS), time-to-PS (TPS), time-to-90% relengthening (TR(90) ), maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening (± dLdt), electrically-stimulated rise in Fura-2 fluorescence intensity (ΔFFI) and Ca(2+) decay. GnRH (1 ng/ml) increased PS, ± dL/dt, resting FFI and ΔFFI, and prolonged TPS, TR(90) and Ca(2+) decay time, whereas 1 pg/ml GnRH affected all these cardiomyocyte variables, except TPS, resting FFI and ΔFFI. A concentration of 1 fg/ml GnRH and the GnRH cleavage product, GnRH-[1-5] (300 pg/ml), had no effect on any cardiomyocyte parameter. The 1 pg/ml GnRH-elicited responses were attenuated by the GnRH receptor antagonist cetrorelix (10 μm), the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 (1 μm) but not the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine chloride (1 μm). These data revealed that GnRH is capable of regulating cardiac contractile function via a GnRH receptor/PKA-dependent mechanism.

Using magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of the lymph nodes with ferumoxtran-10 (MR lymphography), it is possible to detect lymph node metastasis. We present our initial experience with ferumoxtran-10 MR lymphography as the basis for image-guided, dose-escalated lymph node radiotherapy and for early follow-up after radiotherapy.  Patients and methods:   A patient with suspicion for lymph node metastasis after radical prostatectomy was examined with MR lymphography with the lymph node-specific contrast media ferumoxtran-10. Radiotherapy was performed as intensity-modulated radiotherapy with a total dose of 44 Gy to the whole lymphatic drainage, 60 Gy to the area of affected lymph nodes, 71 Gy to the prostate bed, and 75 Gy to the anastomosis region. 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, a follow-up MR lymphography with ferumoxtran-10 was performed.  Results:   In the first MRI with ferumoxtran-10, 5 metastatic lymph nodes were found in the iliac region. The scan 8 weeks postradiotherapy no longer showed lymph nodes suspicious for metastases. PSA (prostate-specific antigen) decreased from 2.06 ng/ml pretherapeutically to 0.02 ng/ml at 2 weeks after treatment and was no longer detectable at 8 months after treatment.

However, a direct role for NAT1 in cell biology has not been established. In this study, we have knocked down NAT1 in the colon adenocarcinoma cell-line HT-29 and found a marked change in cell morphology that was accompanied by an increase in cell-cell contact growth inhibition and a loss of cell viability at confluence. NAT1 knock-down also led to attenuation in anchorage independent growth in soft agar. Loss of NAT1 led to the up-regulation of E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels. This change in E-cadherin was not attributed to RNAi off-target effects and was also observed in the prostate cancer cell-line 22Rv1. In vivo, NAT1 knock-down cells grew with a longer doubling time compared to cells stably transfected with a scrambled RNAi or to parental HT-29 cells.

Many therapies initially shown to be beneficial for the patients were abandoned due to the high drug resistance and the evolution rate of the tumors. One of the prospective therapeutical agents even used in the first stage clinical trials, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, was shown to be either unpredictable or inefficient in many cases. We have already shown that TRPV6 calcium channel, which is the direct target of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor, positively controls prostate cancer proliferation and apoptosis resistance (Lehen'kyi et al., Oncogene, 2007). However, how the known 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 antiproliferative effects may be compatible with the upregulation of pro-oncogenic TRPV6 channel remains a mystery. Here we demonstrate that in low steroid conditions 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 upregulates the expression of TRPV6, enhances the proliferation by increasing the number of cells entering into S-phase. We show that these pro-proliferative effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 are directly mediated via the overexpression of TRPV6 channel which increases calcium uptake into LNCaP cells. The apoptosis resistance of androgen-dependent LNCaP cells conferred by TRPV6 channel is drastically inversed when 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 effects were combined with the successful TRPV6 knockdown. In addition, the use of androgen-deficient DU-145 and androgen-insensitive LNCaP C4-2 cell lines allowed to suggest that the ability of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to induce the expression of TRPV6 channel is a crucial determinant of the success or failure of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-based therapies.""","""[""V'yacheslav Lehen'kyi"", 'Maylis Raphaël', 'Agathe Oulidi', 'Matthieu Flourakis', 'Sergii Khalimonchyk', 'Artem Kondratskyi', 'Dmitri V Gordienko', 'Brigitte Mauroy', 'Jean-Lois Bonnal', 'Roman Skryma', 'Natalia Prevarskaya']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['TRPV6 channel controls prostate cancer cell proliferation via Ca(2+)/NFAT-dependent pathways.', 'RNA interference mediated suppression of TRPV6 inhibits the progression of prostate cancer in vitro by modulating cathepsin B and MMP9 expression.', 'Store-operated Ca2+ current and TRPV6 channels in lymph node prostate cancer cells.', 'TRPV6.', 'The role of Vitamin D3 metabolism in prostate cancer.', 'Calcium selective channel TRPV6: Structure, function, and implications in health and disease.', 'Ion Channel Regulation by Sex Steroid Hormones and Vitamin D in Cancer: A Potential Opportunity for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy.', 'Structure and function of the calcium-selective TRP channel TRPV6.', 'TRPV6 as A Target for Cancer Therapy.', 'Structural bases of TRP channel TRPV6 allosteric modulation by 2-APB.']"""

In this study, we have developed such a robust optimization algorithm. This algorithm is composed of the following two steps: (1) expanding the target volume with margins against the uncertainties, and (2) solving the inverse problem where the terms suppressing the dose gradient of individual fields are added into the objective function. The validity of this algorithm is demonstrated through simulation studies for two extreme cases of two fields with unidirectional and opposing geometries and for a prostate-cancer case.

The influence of Dicer-expression in tumour cells on the prognosis of patients with several cancers has been studied with controversial results among different cancer types. To date no one has examined the effect of this biomarker on survival in colorectal carcinoma. Thus, we aimed to study the influence of Dicer expression on survival in colorectal cancer.  Methods:   We performed immunohistochemical analyses on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cancer tissue with an antibody against the Dicer protein. Tumour material from 237 cases was available from patients with colorectal adeonocarcinomas with moderate differentiation (G2) and without evidence of lymph-node (N0) or distant metastasis (M0). Sixty-four cases were in T2 and 173 in T3 stages. A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed with each tumour in triplicate. Each tumour was assigned to a scoring scale of 0-3, depending on the cytoplasmatic expression of Dicer. A Kaplan-Maier analysis was performed and the log-rank test was used for significance levels by using SPSS v.17 software.  Results:   The expression of Dicer in colorectal carcinoma shows a strong association with poor survival (cancer specific survival=CSS, p<0,001) as well as with reduced progression free survival (PFS, p<0,001). In the group with no Dicer staining there was no recorded relapse (0/15) compared with 10/18 relapses in the group with the strongest staining of Dicer.

Methods and materials:   We performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center to at least 75 Gy. Patients were stratified according to PPC by quartile, and freedom from biochemical failure (nadir + 2 ng/mL), freedom from metastasis (FFM), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed by log-rank test. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cut point for PPC stratification. Finally, Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression was used to assess the impact of PPC on clinical outcome when adjusting for National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and androgen deprivation therapy.  Results:   PPC information was available for 651 patients. Increasing-risk features including T stage, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and NCCN risk group were all directly correlated with increasing PPC. On log-rank evaluation, all clinical endpoints, except for OS, were associated with PPC by quartile, with worse clinical outcomes as PPC increased, with the greatest impact seen in the highest quartile (>66.7% of cores positive). ROC curve analysis confirmed that a cut point using two-thirds positive cores was most closely associated with CSS (p = 0.002; area under ROC curve, 0.71). On univariate analysis, stratifying patients according to PPC less than or equal to 66.7% vs. PPC greater than 66.7% was prognostic for freedom from biochemical failure (p = 0.0001), FFM (p = 0.0002), and CSS (p = 0.0003) and marginally prognostic for OS (p = 0.055). On multivariate analysis, after adjustment for NCCN risk group and androgen deprivation therapy use, PPC greater than 66.7% increased the risk for biochemical failure (p = 0.0001; hazard ratio [HR], 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-3.0]) and FFM (p = 0.05; HR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.1-2.9]) and marginally increased the risk for CSS (p = 0.057; HR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.0-4.6]).

The purpose of the present prospective investigation was to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in XRCC1 with radiation-induced late side effects in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.  Material and methods:   To analyze the role of XRCC1 polymorphisms for late toxicity 603 participants from the Austrian PROCAGENE study treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy were included in the present investigation. Three non-synonymous candidate polymorphisms in the X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) gene (Arg194Trp; Arg280His; Arg399Gln) were selected and determined by 5´-nuclease (TaqMan) assays.  Results:   Within a median follow-up time of 35 months, 91 patients (15.7%) developed high-grade late toxicities (defined as late bladder and/or rectal toxicity RTOG≥2). In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, carriers of the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism were at decreased risk of high-grade late toxicity (p=0.022), in multivariate analysis including clinical and dosimetric parameters as potential confounders the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism remained a significant predictor for high-grade late toxicity (HR=0.221, 95% CI 0.051-0.956; p=0.043).

Since the WNT signaling pathway regulates bone remodeling and has been implicated in tumor progression and osteomimicry, we analyzed the WNT profile of primary PCa tissues and PCa cell lines and assessed its regulation by bisphosphonates. Prostate tissue (n = 18) was obtained from patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa patients with different disease stages. Serum samples were collected from 62 patients.

Several members of the WNT pathway, including WNT5A, FZD5, and DKK1 were highly up-regulated in PCa tissue from patients with advanced PCa. Interestingly, osteotropic cells showed a distinct WNT profile compared to non-osteotropic cells. While WNT5A, FZD5, and DKK1 were highly expressed in PC3 cells, WNT1 and SFRP1 mRNA levels were higher in DU145 cells.

Patients and methods:   Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind, double-dummy design to receive monthly subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg (n = 886) or intravenous ZA 4 mg (dose adjusted for renal impairment; n = 890). Daily supplemental calcium and vitamin D were strongly recommended. The primary end point was time to first on-study SRE (pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression).  Results:   Denosumab was noninferior to ZA in delaying time to first on-study SRE (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.98; P = .0007). Although directionally favorable, denosumab was not statistically superior to ZA in delaying time to first on-study SRE (P = .03 unadjusted; P = .06 adjusted for multiplicity) or time to first-and-subsequent (multiple) SRE (rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.04; P = .14). Overall survival and disease progression were similar between groups. Hypocalcemia occurred more frequently with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred at similarly low rates in both groups. Acute-phase reactions after the first dose occurred more frequently with ZA, as did renal adverse events and elevations in serum creatinine based on National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events grading.

Here we show that Prx1 is overexpressed in human CaP specimens and that it regulates prostate tumor growth through TLR4-dependent regulation of prostate tumor vasculature. Inhibiting Prx1 expression in prostate tumor cells reduced tumor vascular formation and function. Furthermore, Prx1 inhibition reduced levels of angiogenic proteins such as VEGF within the tumor microenvironment. Lastly, Prx1-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in a TLR4- and VEGF-dependent manner.

Whether these common genetic variants are associated with incident metastatic prostate cancer or with recurrence after surgical treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer is uncertain.  Experimental design:   Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for study in relation to prostate metastatic cancer and recurrence, based on their genome-wide association with prostate cancer in the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS). To assess risk for metastatic disease, we compared genotypes for the 12 SNPs by logistic regression of 470 incident metastatic prostate cancer cases and 1,945 controls in 3 case-control studies. To assess the relationship of these SNPs to risk for prostate cancer recurrence, we used Cox regression in a cohort of 1,412 men treated for localized prostate cancer, including 328 recurrences, and used logistic regression in a case-case study, comparing 450 recurrent versus 450 nonrecurrent prostate cancer cases. Study-specific relative risks (RRs) for risk of metastatic disease and recurrence were summarized using meta-analysis, with inverse variance weights.  Results:   MSMB rs10993994 (per variant allele summary RR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.05-1.48), 8q24 rs4242382 (RR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.13-1.75), and 8q24 rs6983267 (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.50-0.89) were associated with risk for metastatic prostate cancer. None of the 12 SNPs was associated with prostate cancer recurrence.  Conclusions:   SNPs in MSMB and 8q24 which predispose to prostate cancer overall are associated with risk for metastatic prostate cancer, the most lethal form of this disease. SNPs predictive of prostate cancer recurrence were not identified, among the predisposition SNPs. GWAS specific to these 2 phenotypes may identify additional phenotype-specific genetic determinants.""","""['Jiyoung Ahn', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Jong Y Park', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Hanna Rennert', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Elaine A Ostrander', 'Stephen Chanock', 'Ming-Hsi Wang', 'Rama D Mittal', 'William B Isaacs', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Richard B Hayes']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Association between two unlinked loci at 8q24 and prostate cancer risk among European Americans.', 'Analysis of recently identified prostate cancer susceptibility loci in a population-based study: associations with family history and clinical features.', 'Prognostic significance of prostate cancer susceptibility variants on prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', '8q24 rs4242382 polymorphism is a risk factor for prostate cancer among multi-ethnic populations: evidence from clinical detection in China and a meta-analysis.', 'Review of prostate cancer genomic studies in Africa.', 'Precision intervention for prostate cancer: Re-evaluating who is at risk.', 'Genetic variant located on chromosome 17p12 contributes to prostate cancer onset and biochemical recurrence.', 'Genetic Factors Associated with Prostate Cancer Conversion from Active Surveillance to Treatment.', 'Identification of Germline Genetic Variants that Increase Prostate Cancer Risk and Influence Development of Aggressive Disease.']"""

We previously reported that VEGF(121)/rGel targets osteoclast precursors and tumor neovasculature. Here we tested the hypothesis that targeting nontumor cells expressing these receptors can inhibit tumor progression in a clinically relevant model of osteoblastic PCa.  Experimental design:   Cells from MDA PCa 118b, a PCa xenograft obtained from a bone metastasis in a patient with castrate-resistant PCa, were injected into the femurs of mice. Osteoblastic progression was monitored following systemic administration of VEGF(121)/rGel.  Results:   VEGF(121)/rGel was cytotoxic in vitro to osteoblast precursor cells. This cytotoxicity was specific as VEGF(121)/rGel internalization into osteoblasts was VEGF(121) receptor driven. Furthermore, VEGF(121)/rGel significantly inhibited PCa-induced bone formation in a mouse calvaria culture assay. In vivo, VEGF(121)/rGel significantly inhibited the osteoblastic progression of PCa cells in the femurs of nude mice. Microcomputed tomographic analysis revealed that VEGF(121)/rGel restored the bone volume fraction of tumor-bearing femurs to values similar to those of the contralateral (non-tumor-bearing) femurs. VEGF(121)/rGel significantly reduced the number of tumor-associated osteoclasts but did not change the numbers of peritumoral osteoblasts. Importantly, VEGF(121)/rGel-treated mice had significantly less tumor burden than control mice. Our results thus indicate that VEGF(121)/rGel inhibits osteoblastic tumor progression by targeting angiogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and bone formation.  Conclusions:   Targeting VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1- or VEGFR-2-expressing cells is effective in controlling the osteoblastic progression of PCa in bone. These findings provide the basis for an effective multitargeted approach for metastatic PCa.""","""['Khalid A Mohamedali', 'Zhi Gang Li', 'Michael W Starbuck', 'Xinhai Wan', 'Jun Yang', 'Sehoon Kim', 'Wendy Zhang', 'Michael G Rosenblum', 'Nora M Navone']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Inhibition of prostate tumor growth and bone remodeling by the vascular targeting agent VEGF121/rGel.', 'Cytotoxicity of VEGF(121)/rGel on vascular endothelial cells resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis is mediated via VEGFR-2.', 'Dual targeting c-met and VEGFR2 in osteoblasts suppresses growth and osteolysis of prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor A isoform 121-gelonin fusion protein–conjugated manganese ferrite nanoparticles.', '64Cu-Labeled 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododedane-N,N’,N’’,N’’’-tetraacetic acid–conjugated vascular endothelial growth factor A isoform 121-gelonin fusion protein.', 'Antagonizing exosomal miR-18a-5p derived from prostate cancer cells ameliorates metastasis-induced osteoblastic lesions by targeting Hist1h2bc and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Co-Culturing of Endothelial and Cancer Cells in a Nanofibrous Scaffold-Based Two-Layer System.', 'Targeting of Tumor Neovasculature with GrB/VEGF121, a Novel Cytotoxic Fusion Protein.', 'Heme oxygenase 1 governs the cytoskeleton at filopodia: pulling the brakes on the migratory capacity of prostate tumoral cells.', 'Heme oxygenase-1 in the forefront of a multi-molecular network that governs cell-cell contacts and filopodia-induced zippering in prostate cancer.']"""

Intrafascial nerve-sparing EERPE (nsEERPE) aims to preserve the neurovascular bundle and subsequently erectile function. This study assessed the functional and oncological outcomes of nsEERPE with particular regard to younger patients.  Methods:   Data on 353 men undergoing EERPE between February 2006 and December 2009 was collected prospectively. Non-nerve-sparing EERPE was performed in men diagnosed with PCa with a Gleason score >6 and/or PSA >10 μg/l. nsEERPE was undertaken in men diagnosed PCa with PSA ≤10 μg/l and Gleason score ≤6. Biochemical failure (BF) was defined as PSA ≥0.2 μg/l after nadir or never reached nadir. Men were deemed continent if dry or using 1 confidence pad. Erections satisfactory for intercourse (ESI) or unsatisfactory for intercourse (EUI) were recorded.  Results:   102 Men (29%) had nsEERPE and 126 (36%) EERPE. pT2 positive surgical margin (PSM) rates were 20.5% for nsEERPE and 21.3% for EERPE (P = 1). Continence rates following nsEERPE were 59%, 86%, 97% and 52%, 76%, 86% following EERPE at 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up respectively (P > 0.05). Erectile function rates for nsEERPE were 24%, 52%, 71% compared to 6%, 14%, 29% for EERPE at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively (P < 0.001). Erectile function in men <60 y having nsEERPE was 75% at 12 months.  Conclusions:   Continence returned more rapidly and erectile function was improved following nsEERPE vs. EERPE. These results suggest that nsEERPE can be performed with particularly good oncological and functional outcome in <60 y men.""","""['Grant D Stewart', 'Ismail El-Mokadem', 'Marguerite E McLornan', 'Jens-Uwe Stolzenburg', 'S Alan McNeill']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Surgeon""","""['Intrafascial nerve-sparing endoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy.', 'A comparison of outcomes for interfascial and intrafascial nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Previous laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair does not adversely affect the functional or oncological outcomes of endoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy.', 'Strategies to promote recovery of cavernous nerve function after radical prostatectomy.', 'Evolution of endoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy (EERPE): technique and outcome.', 'Oncological safety of intrafascial nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy compared with conventional process: a pooled review and meta-regression analysis based on available studies.', ""Intrafascial nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy improves patients' postoperative continence recovery and erectile function: A pooled analysis based on available literatures."", 'Comparison of intrafascial and non-intrafascial radical prostatectomy for low risk localized prostate cancer.', 'Prevention and management of post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction.', 'A matched-pair comparison between bilateral intrafascial and interfascial nerve-sparing techniques in extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.']"""

The purpose of this study was to develop a patient related treatment plan verification protocol using a two dimensional ionization chamber array (MatriXX, IBA, Schwarzenbruck, Germany).  Method:   Measurements were done to determine the dependence between response of 2D ionization chamber array, beam direction, and field size. Also the reproducibility of the measurements was checked. For the patient related verifications the original patient Rapid Arc treatment plan was projected on CT dataset of the MatriXX and the dose distribution was calculated. After irradiation of the Rapid Arc verification plans measured and calculated 2D dose distributions were compared using the gamma evaluation method implemented in the measuring software OmniPro (version 1.5, IBA, Schwarzenbruck, Germany).  Results:   The dependence between response of 2D ionization chamber array, field size and beam direction has shown a passing rate of 99% for field sizes between 7 cm×7 cm and 24 cm×24 cm for measurements of single arc. For smaller and larger field sizes than 7 cm×7 cm and 24 cm×24 cm the passing rate was less than 99%. The reproducibility was within a passing rate of 99% and 100%. The accuracy of the whole process including the uncertainty of the measuring system, treatment planning system, linear accelerator and isocentric laser system in the treatment room was acceptable for treatment plan verification using gamma criteria of 3% and 3 mm, 2D global gamma index.  Conclusion:   It was possible to verify the 2D dose distribution and MU of Rapid Arc treatment plans using the MatriXX. The use of the MatriXX for Rapid Arc treatment plan verification in clinical routine is reasonable.

Cox proportional hazards regression analyses of PSM lengths were conducted either as a continuous or categorical variable relative to location as a predictor of BCR.  Results:   Multivariate analyses demonstrated that as a continuous variable, PSM length at the anterior fibromuscular region (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.17; P = 0.027) and bladder neck (HR = 1.29; P = 0.046) were significant predictors for BCR. As a categorical variable, PSM length ≥ 2 mm at the anterior fibromuscular area was significant for BCR (HR = 3.02; P = 0.036). Increasing Gleason grade and positive lymph node status were also found to be significant independent predictors for BCR.  Conclusion:   PSM length at the anterior fibromuscular region (continuous and categorical) and the bladder neck (continuous) was significantly associated with BCR. Site-specific PSM length, along with Gleason grade and lymph node status, can be predictive of BCR and assist in risk stratification of patients with PSM following radical prostatectomy.""","""['Mark Hsu', 'Steven L Chang', 'Michelle Ferrari', 'Rosalie Nolley', 'Joseph C Presti Jr', 'James D Brooks']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial comment from Drs.

The questionnaire covers the period before carrying out prostate biopsy, the disclosure of histological examination, and the recovery period.  Material and methods:   240 patients who were to undergo trans-rectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy due to suspected prostate cancer were consecutively and prospectively studied between January 2008 and January 2009. Patients were asked to complete an IIEF-15 questionnaire to assess sexual function during the initial consultation (T0), generally whilst they waited to be called forward for an ECG or to provide blood samples. The same questionnaire was re-administered 30 days following disclosure of results (T30) and, in all cases of confirmed malignancy, at pre-surgical admission (T pre-op).  Results:   In this study we examined results on perceived sexual function following transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy for suspected neoplasia. Eighteen of the 240 consecutive patients suitable for the study were excluded due to their inability to reliably complete the IIEF-15 questionnaires provided. Histological results led to the selection of 98 patients (44.1%) with neoplastic pathology, group A, and 124 (55.8%) with benign pathology, group B. At T0 a normal level of erectile function was evident in 50 group A patients (51%) and in 50 group B patients (40.3%), while ED has been reported in 48 individuals (49%) in group A and in 74 (59.7%) in group B. At T30 we observed in group A a decrease of the mean IIEF-15 score from 53.6 to 37.8 (p = 0.0013). We observed similar results in group B, where 10/50 patients developed ED with a consequent reduction of the IIEF average score from 55.9 to 48.3 (p = 0.04). Of the 16 patients in group A who developed ED after biopsy only 2 were eligible for surgery and there were no statistical differences in the IIEF scores comparing T30 with T-pre-surgery (p = 0.36).  Conclusions:   In this study, as previously documented in literature, no direct correlation was observed between ED in patients and the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The only seemingly correlative factor between ED and prostate cancer is biopsy itself. Further specific studies should be carried out to assess whether ED is a psychological result of an emotional stressful event or whether resulting physical damage following the biopsy procedure is to blame.""","""['Fabrizio Palumbo', 'Carlo Bettocchi', 'Marco Spilotros', 'Antonio Vavallo', 'Silvano Palazzo', 'Pasquale Ditonno', 'Pasquale Martino', 'Michele Battaglia', 'Francesco Paolo Selvaggi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Erectile function in prostate cancer-free patients who underwent prostate saturation biopsy.', 'A prospective study of erectile function after transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Can prostate biopsies affect erectile function?', 'Disseminated intravascular coagulation following transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Complications of multiple transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate.', 'Erectile dysfunction in 1050 men following extended (18 cores) vs saturation (28 cores) vs saturation plus MRI-targeted prostate biopsy (32 cores).', 'Transperineal biopsy of the prostate--is this the future?']"""

Clinical studies have shown such treatment modality to be safe and effective in the management of localised prostate cancer as well as of local recurrences after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy.  Material and methods:   From May 2002 to June 2010, 171 patients with no previous treatment for prostate cancer, aged 44 to 86 years (mean 74.7) underwent 197 HIFU treatments; 22 patients needed a second treatment as the first was incomplete (4 patients) or because of recurrence (18 patients). The prognosis subgroups were defined as low-risk in 29 patients (clinical stage T1-T2a, PSA < or = 10 ng/mL and Gleason score lower than 7), intermediate-risk in 47 patients (clinical stage T2b or PSA 10 - 20 ng/mL or Gleason score of 7), and high-risk in 95 patients (clinical stage > or = T2c or PSA > 20 ng/mL or Gleason score higher than 7).  Results:   At a mean follow-up of 67.9 months, biochemical success rate (PSA constantly < 0.5 ng/ml) was obtained in 84.2% of low and intermediate risk patients and in 43.1% of high risk patients; post-treatment biopsies (6 months after treatment) revealed no residual tumour in 93.4% of low or intermediate risk patients and in 63.1% of high risk patients.  Conclusions:   Radical prostatectomy remains the ""gold standard"" for localised prostate cancer. However, HIFU seems to be a promising alternative and less invasive treatment modality with an encouraging success rate, at least in the short-term, in patients with low and medium risk of progression, not candidates for radical surgery; in cancers with clinical stage > or = T2c, or PSA > 20 ng/mL, or Gleason score higher than 7 seems to get good results in about half of patients.""","""['Andrea Callea', 'Roberto Piccinni', 'Vito Zizzi', 'Domenico Sblendorio', 'Bartolomeo Berardi', 'Antonio Tempesta', 'Francesco Giuseppe Gala', 'Antonio Traficante']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['HIFU as salvage first-line treatment for palpable, TRUS-evidenced, biopsy-proven locally recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a pilot study.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the prostate cancer treatment: 5-year resuts.', 'Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with MRI image fusion for monitoring focal therapy of prostate cancer with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)1.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: 5-year experience.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Applications of Focused Ultrasound in the Treatment of Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Value of the hemorrhage exclusion sign on T1-weighted prostate MR images for the detection of prostate cancer.']"""

We describe a technique of anterior prostate biopsy obtained with transrectal approach using an end-fire probe.  Materials and methods:   We correlated the images of the video of the diagnostic biopsy, the histology of the biopsy and of the surgical specimen after radical prostatectomy. A 68 years old may previously underwent two biopsies: first biopsy and re-biopsy were performed using the transrectal approach with 12 and 16 cores respectively, including the tranisizion zone (2 per side). Initial histology revealed high grade PIN only. We performed a saturation biopsy (28 samples) under local anesthesia, as outpatient, using endfire ultrasound probe, including anterior zone and fibromuscolar stroma (2 per side). Images of the procedure was stored electronically. Each biopsy core was pre-embedded and inked at one side in order to identify the rectal end (pericapsular side). Surgical specimen of radical nerve sparing prostatectomy was analyzed according to the Stanford protocol (3 mm). All biopsies and surgical specimens were reviewed by the same uro-pathologist.  Results:   Cancer was detected only by anterior biopsy (left side, 1 core, 3 mm of total cancer extension, Gleason score 3 + 3, placed into the not inked core side). Histology of the surgical specimen confirmed the location of the disease with 0.3 cc tumor volume. Technically, to improve biopsy of the anterior zone the tip of the needle should obtain all the tissue up to the Santorini venous plexus. Postoperative recovery was uneventful after both procedures.  Conclusion:   We showed that end-fire probe makes possible, effective and safe the biopsy of the anterior prostate, which may contain cancer in particular when previous biopsies are negative. The anterior biopsy technique herein described is easy and reliable. Based on our experience, end-fire probe should be used in re-biopsy or saturation biopsy if transrectal approach is preferred.

Material and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 193 patients submitted from 1998 to 2007 to prostate re-biopsy after initial HGPIN diagnosis in three urologic departments. HGPIN diagnosis was obtained on initial systematic PBx with 6 to 24 random cores. All patients were re-biopsied with a ""saturation"" PBx with 18-26 cores with a median time to re-biopsy of 12 months. All slides were reviewed by expert uro-pathologists.  Results:   Plurifocal HGPIN (pHGPIN) was found in 103 patients and monofocal HGPIN (mHGPIN) in 90. Seventy-two and 121 patients were submitted to > 12-core initial biopsy and < or = 12-core, respectively. Overall PCa detection at re-biopsy was 28.4%. PSA (6.7 vs 8.5 ng/ml; p = 0.029) and age (64 vs 68 years; p = 0.005) were significantly higher in patients with PCa at re-biopsy.

As PCa is not clearly demonstrable at transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), guidelines on TRUS guided biopsy suggest to perform a random tissue sampling (at least 8-12 ""cores"" depending on gland volume). Although accuracy grows with core number, patient discomfort and adverse event probability grow as well. Thus it would be worth to aim to reduce the number of prostate biopsy cores without loss of diagnostic accuracy.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of an improved version of a rtCAB tool developed at DEIS (University of Bologna) for the reduction of prostate biopsy cores. rtCAB is an innovative processing technique which enhances TRUS video stream by a live false color overlay image that helps the physician to perform the biopsy by guiding the sampling into target zones. In order to train rtCAB, a monocentric, single operator prostate gland adenocarcinoma database has been built. The database enlists 81 patients, for a total of 743 prostate byoptic (PBx) cores and 14860 ROI. For each patient we collected age, PSA levels, digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, presence or absence of focal lesions, and prostate volume. During TRUS, raw ultrasound data were acquired and associated to each PBx core. For each core we collected both the radio frequency (RF) signal and the histological outcome.  Results:   The whole system was optimized for reducing the number of false positives while preserving an acceptable number of false negatives. Comparing to a classical PBx approach (8-12 cores), the estimated positive predictive value (PPV) of our method increased from 25% to 40%, with an overall sensitivity of 85%.  Conclusions:   Preliminary results show that the proposed tool can provide real-time feedback to the operator during TRUS. Sensitivity and PPV values suggest that a reduction of almost 50% the number of biopsy cores without losing in diagnostic accuracy is feasible. A prospective study is needed to further confirm these preliminary retrospective results.""","""['Nicola Testoni', 'Nicolò Speciale', 'Alessandro Bertaccini', 'Debora Marchiori', 'Michelangelo Fiorentino', 'Fabio Manferrari', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Riccardo Cividini', 'Francesca Galluzzo', 'Simona Maggio', 'Elena Biagi', 'Leonardo Masotti', 'Guido Masetti', 'Giuseppe Martorana']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Diagnosis of isolated high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia: proposal of a nomogram for the prediction of cancer detection at saturation re-biopsy.', 'Improving the Gleason grading accuracy of transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy.', 'Real-time MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy improves detection rates of prostate cancer in pre-biopsied patients.', 'Repeated biopsy in the detection of prostate cancer: when and how many cores.', 'Diagnosis of organ-confined prostate cancer by systematic biopsy under guidance of TRUS.']"""

Lymphoscintigraphy (LS) and radioguided sentinel node biopsy (RSNB) could be an alternative method of nodal staging.  Materials and methods:   Between June 2003 and February 2007 19 patients with prostate cancer without metastases were included in the study. Mean age was 66 years, mean PSA 15.51 ng/ml, Gleason score > 6. A transrectal ultrasound was performed with intraprostatic administration of 0.2 ml/190 MBq 99 mTc bound to nanocolloid particles, prepared the day before surgery. Dynamic and static scans of the pelvis were obtained at 30', 60' and 120' after injection. Hot spots outside the site of administration were considered as sentinel nodes (SLNs). Prior to prostatectomy, LPL was performed. The presence of a labeled node after LPL, identified by a gamma probe slided slowly down the chain of lymphatic drainage, was indication for an LPE.  Results:   A sentinel node was identified in 17/19 patients with preoperative lymphoscintigraphy (identification rate 89%) and in 16/19 patients during surgery (84%) with a negative predictive value of 97%. The most frequent site was identified at the level of hypogastric lymph nodes (56%), outside the standard of limited pelvic lymphadenectomy, followed by external iliac (33%), obturator (7%) and common iliac (4%) lymph nodes. Lymph node metastases were detected by histological examination in 2 patients (13%); total metastatic nodes found were 9: one in the first, and 8 in the second patient. Two metastatic nodes (22%) not removed by the limited pelvic lymphadenectomy were found with the sentinel lymph node dissection.

There are a few reports on the benefits of this potential reduction of positive margins (PSM).  Objective:   The aim of this study is to assess the oncological advantages of PSM rate reduction with the use of IFS and additional tissue excision in case of PSM. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTECIPANTS: 270 patients undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were included in a prospective study, to evaluate the results of further tissue excision in case of PSM at IFS. Median age was 65 yrs. Median PSA was 7.0 ng/ml.  Intervention:   The prostate was extracted during the operation. IFS was performed in all patients on the prostate surface, at the base, the apex and along the postero-lateral aspect of the gland. In case of PSM additional tissue was excised from the site of the prostatic bed corresponding to the surgical margin.  Measurements:   Endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival.  Results and limitations:   PSM were found in 67 patients (24.8%). With additional tissue resection, PSM rate dropped from 24.8% to 12.6%. Decreased PSM after further resection didn't improve biochemical-free survival. Patients with initial PSM at IFS rendered negative with further resection, had similar results if compared to patients with margins still positive, and worse results if compared to patients with negative margins (NSM). Biochemical recurrence rate was 2.95% at 58 months in 203 patients with NSM, 15.1% at 54 months in 33 patients with PSM at IFS that were rendered negative after further resection, and 11.7% at 67 months in 34 patients with still PSM after additional resection. These results were confirmed also according to: stage, nerve-sparing procedure, Gleason score.

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a mainstay of treatment for organ-confined prostate cancer. Preoperatively, the process of planning RP is based on local stage and precisely defines the location and size of disease within the prostate. Nowadays, there is no technology that can accurately map prostate cancer within the gland. Hence, urologists rely mainly on information provided by histopathological examination of biopsy cores, but this information does not accurately locate or stage prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to provide the surgeon with a 3D visualization tool capable of showing the location and extent of tumour within the prostate.  Methods:   To perform this task, an application named iProstate, which makes use of four different mathematical predictive models that use biopsy cores information, was developed. These predictive models were trained with 277 clinical reports from patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy. Two sets of data from the patient reports were used to train the predictive models, the first containing the lengths of the biopsy cores and the tumour percentages of the biopsy cores information, and the second containing the lengths of the biopsy cores, tumour percentages of the biopsy cores, Gleason score, PSA and gland volume information.  Results:   Multilayer Perceptron was the predictive model that scored the better results, giving a better approximation in the prediction of location and extent of tumour in the prostatic gland. Gleason score, PSA and gland volume proved to be important variables for the training of the predictive model.  Conclusions:   The application was able to perform predictions of the location and extent of tumour that were very close to the real location and extent of tumour observed in the whole mount radical prostatectomy specimens, therefore its implementation in clinical assessment and follow-up should be considered.""","""['Juan Rodriguez', 'Jose-Maria Sabater', 'Jose-Luis Ruiz', 'Ana Soto', 'Nicolas Garcia']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Med Robot""","""['Targeted prostate biopsy using statistical image analysis.', 'A parallel coordinates style interface for exploratory volume visualization.', 'Minimal representations of 3D models in terms of image parameters under calibrated and uncalibrated perspective.', 'Automated detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution ex vivo MRI.', 'Statistical shape models for 3D medical image segmentation: a review.']"""

However, the role and mechanism action of PMEPA1 in AR-negative prostate cancer are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of PMEPA1 suppresses AR-negative RWPE1 and PC-3 prostate cell proliferation through up-regulating the p21 transcription. Additionally, PMEPA1 overexpression suppresses the p21 expression and promotes cell proliferation. PMEPA1 is induced by TGFβ as a negative feedback loop to suppress Smad3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation; up-regulates c-Myc; down-regulates p21; and promotes PC-3 cell proliferation. The PMEPA1 functions depend on its Smad2/3 binding motif. Consistently, depletion of Smad3/4, but not Smad2, blocks PMEPA1's functions of regulating c-Myc and p21. Importantly, stable depletion of PMEPA1 in PC-3 inhibits xenograft growth. Finally, we found that PMEPA1 is overexpressed in a subset of prostate cancer cell lines and tumours.

MR provides superior soft tissue contrast compared to CT and the use of MR-alone for prostate planning would provide further benefits such as lower cost to the patient. This study compares the accuracy of MR-alone based dose calculations with bulk electron density assignment to CT-based dose calculations for prostate radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   CT and whole pelvis MR images were contoured for 39 prostate patients. Plans with uniform density and plans with bulk density values assigned to bone and tissue were compared to the patient's gold standard full density CT plan. The optimal bulk density for bone was calculated using effective depth measurements. The plans were evaluated using ICRU point doses, dose volume histograms, and Chi comparisons. Differences in spatial uniformity were investigated for the CT and MR scans.  Results:   The calculated dose for CT bulk bone and tissue density plans was 0.1±0.6% (mean±1 SD) higher than the corresponding full density CT plan. MR bulk bone and tissue density plans were 1.3±0.8% lower than the full density CT plan. CT uniform density plans and MR uniform density plans were 1.4±0.9% and 2.6±0.9% lower, respectively. Paired t-tests performed on specific points on the DVH graphs showed that points on DVHs for all bulk electron density plans were equivalent with two exceptions.

The dose distributions of six patients produced Chi values outside the acceptable range of values when MR-based plans were compared to the full density plan.  Conclusions:   MR-alone bulk density planning is feasible provided bone is assigned a density, however, manual segmentation of bone on MR images will have to be replaced with automatic methods.

Mutation analysis identified a novel hypoxia response element (HRE), in addition to the HRE found previously in prostate cancer LNCaP cells. Knockdown and overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α indicated that HIF-1 contributed to the up-regulation of GAPDH gene expression by hypoxia. Although chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and plasmid immunoprecipitation analyses revealed the presence of HIF-1α on the novel HRE in both hypoxic cell lines, a mutation in either the novel HRE or its 3'-flanking GC-box resulted in a reduction of hypoxia-increased GAPDH promoter activity only in MCF-7 cells. ChIP analysis showed that Sp1 bound to the GC-box in MCF-7 cells, but not in LNCaP cells, in normoxia and hypoxia. Knockdown of Sp1 reduced hypoxia-increased promoter activity and expression level of GAPDH in MCF-7 cells. These results indicate that in MCF-7 cells, the activation of HIF-1 on the novel HRE contributes to the breast cancer-specific hypoxic induction of GAPDH gene expression and absolutely depends on the presence of Sp1 on the GC-box.""","""['Yasuki Higashimura', 'Yoshito Nakajima', 'Ryoichi Yamaji', 'Naoki Harada', 'Futoshi Shibasaki', 'Yoshihisa Nakano', 'Hiroshi Inui']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Arch Biochem Biophys""","""['Hyperinducibility of hypoxia-responsive genes without p53/p21-dependent checkpoint in aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Induction of truncated form of tenascin-X (XB-S) through dissociation of HDAC1 from SP-1/HDAC1 complex in response to hypoxic conditions.', 'Insulin-dependent leptin expression in breast cancer cells.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in human breast and prostate cancer.', 'Deregulation of glycolysis in cancer: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a therapeutic target.', 'Using RNA-seq to identify suitable housekeeping genes for hypoxia studies in human adipose-derived stem cells.', '""Pulsed Hypoxia"" Gradually Reprograms Breast Cancer Fibroblasts into Pro-Tumorigenic Cells via Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition.', 'HNF4α is possibly the missing link between epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Warburg effect during hepatocarcinogenesis.', 'SP and KLF Transcription Factors in Cancer Metabolism.', 'Human Sarcopenic Myoblasts Can Be Rescued by Pharmacological Reactivation of HIF-1α.']"""

We present the estimates of the cancer burden in Turkey for 2006, calculated using data from the eight population based cancer registries which have been set up in selected provinces representative of sociodemographic patterns in their regions.  Methods:   We calculated age specific and age adjusted incidence rates (AAIR-world standard population) for each of registries separately. We assigned a weighting coefficient for each registry proportional to the population size of the region which the registry represents.  Results:   We pooled a total of 24,428 cancers (14,581 males, 9,847 females). AAIRs per 100 000 were: 210.1 in men and 129.4 in women for all cancer sites excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. The AAIR per 100 000 men was highest for lung cancer (60.3) followed by prostate (22.8), bladder (19.6), stomach (16.3) and colo-rectal (15.4) cancers. Among women the rate per 100 000 was highest for breast cancer (33.7) followed by colorectal (11.5), stomach (8.8), thyroid (8.8) and lung (7.7). The most striking findings about the cancer incidence in the provinces were the high incidence rates for stomach and esophageal cancers in Erzurum and high stomach cancer incidence rates in Trabzon for both sexes.  Conclusions:   We are thus able to present the most accurate and realistic estimations for cancer incidence in Turkey so far. Lung, prostate, bladder, stomach, colorectal, larynx cancers in men and breast, colorectal, stomach, thyroid, lung, corpus uteri cancers in women are the leading cancers respectively. This figure shows us tobacco related cancers, lung, bladder and larynx, predominate in men. Concurrently, we analyzed the data for each province separately, giving us the opportunity to present the differences in cancer patterns among provinces.

The aim of this study was to analyze the secular trend of cancer mortality in Korea from 1983 to 2007. Mortality and population data from 1983 to 2007 were obtained from the Korea Statistical Office. The annual cancer death rates for 18 age groups were estimated, and joinpoint regression was applied to detect significant changes in cancer mortality. The age-standardized mortality rate for all sites combined increased until the mid-1990s and has been decreasing thereafter, this also being the case for cancers of the esophagus, liver, lung and bladder, as well as leukemia. With stomach and uterine cancers a constant reduction was evident throughout the period. The declines in stomach, liver, and uterine cancer mortality have made major contributions to the recent overall favorable trend. Mortality for cancers of the colon and rectum and the prostate increased in the early 2000s and then leveled off, whereas female breast cancer mortality has displayed a constant increasing trend. In conclusion, overall cancer mortality is decreasing in men and women in Korea, and this trend will probably continue and improve further in line with advances in management as well as the expected impact of the national screening program for major five cancers over the next decades.""","""['Kyu-Won Jung', 'Hai-Rim Shin', 'Hyun-Joo Kong', 'Sohee Park', 'Young-Joo Won', 'Kui Son Choi', 'Eun-Cheol Park']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Trends in major cancer mortality in Korea, 1983-2012, with a joinpoint analysis.', 'A Joinpoint regression analysis of long-term trends in cancer mortality in Japan (1958-2004).', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Incidence and mortality trends for four major cancers in the elderly and middle-aged adults: an international comparison.', 'Progress in cancer mortality, incidence, and survival: a global overview.', 'Comparison of cancer incidence and mortality in three GDP per capita levels in China, 2013.', 'Strategies for Appropriate Patient-centered Care to Decrease the Nationwide Cost of Cancers in Korea.', 'Health Performance and Challenges in Korea: a Review of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.', 'Global trends of lung cancer mortality and smoking prevalence.', 'Malaria in the Americas: trends from 1959 to 2011.']"""

In this study, we show that miR-34c is downregulated in PCa (p = 0.0005) by performing qRT-PCR on 49 TURPs from PCa patients compared to 25 from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The miR-34c expression was found to inversely correlate to aggressiveness of the tumor, WHO grade, PSA levels and occurrence of metastases. Furthermore, a Kaplan-Meier analysis of patient survival based on miR-34c expression levels divided into low (< 50th percentile) and high (> 50th percentile) expression, significantly divides the patients into high risk and low risk patients (p = 0.0003, log-rank test). The phenotypic effects of miR-34c deregulation were studied in prostate cell lines, where ectopic expression of miR-34c decreased cell growth, due to both a decrease in cellular proliferation rate and an increase in apoptosis. In concordance to this, miR-34c was found to negatively regulate the oncogenes E2F3 and BCL-2, which stimulates proliferation and suppress apoptosis in PCa cells, respectively. Reversely, we could also show that blocking miR-34c in vitro increases cell growth. Further, ectopic expression of miR-34c was found to suppress migration and invasion. Our findings provide new insight into the role of miR-34c in the prostate, exhibiting tumor suppressing effects on proliferation, apoptosis and invasiveness.""","""['Zandra Hagman', 'Olivia Larne', 'Anders Edsjö', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Roy A Ehrnström', 'David Ulmert', 'Hans Lilja', 'Yvonne Ceder']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA 345, a methylation-sensitive microRNA is involved in cell proliferation and invasion in human colorectal cancer.', 'miR-195 Inhibits EMT by Targeting FGF2 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'MicroRNAs and prostate cancer.', 'Diverse functions of miR-373 in cancer.', 'An unbiased seed-based RNAi selection screen identifies small RNAs that inhibit androgen signaling and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Differential Expression of miRNAs Contributes to Tumor Aggressiveness and Racial Disparity in African American Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'exFINDER: identify external communication signals using single-cell transcriptomics data.', 'exFINDER: identify external communication signals using single-cell transcriptomics data.', 'Inflammatory Modulation of miR-155 Inhibits Doxorubicin-Induced Testicular Dysfunction via SIRT1/FOXO1 Pathway: Insight into the Role of Acacetin and Bacillus cereus Protease.']"""

Since the compounds may contribute to berry anticancer properties, their content in cranberries, selected cranberry products, and three other Vaccinium species (V. oxycoccus, V. vitis-idaea and V. angustifolium) was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The ability of these compounds to inhibit growth in a panel of tumor cell lines and inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity associated with tumor invasion and metastasis was determined in DU145 prostate tumor cells.  Results:   The highest content of ursolic acid and esters was found in V. macrocarpon berries (0.460-1.090 g ursolic acid and 0.040-0.160 g each ester kg(-1) fresh weight). V. vitis-idaea and V. angustifolium contained ursolic acid (0.230-0.260 g kg(-1) ), but the esters were not detected. V. oxycoccus was lowest (0.129 g ursolic acid and esters per kg). Ursolic acid content was highest in cranberry products prepared from whole fruit. Ursolic acid and its esters inhibited tumor cell growth at micromolar concentrations, and inhibited MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity at concentrations below those previously reported for cranberry polyphenolics.

LNCaP cells, androgen dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) cells and C4-2 cells, which are a CRPC subline of LNCaP cells, were used. Specimens obtained from ADPC and CRPC patients were also evaluated. The CRPC specimens and C4-2 cells exhibited significantly lower thymidylate synthase (TS) expression, a target of 5-FU, than the ADPC specimens and LNCaP cells. In vitro, C4-2 cells exhibited higher sensitivity to 5-FU than LNCaP cells. In C4-2 xenograft model, S-1 monotherapy suppressed tumor growth and low-dose DOC enhanced the anti-tumor effect of S-1. In vitro, low-dose DOC, which did not induce G2/M arrest, increased p53 and p21 and resulted in down-regulation of TS in C4-2 cells, and down-regulation of TS is considered to be responsible for the synergistic effect of S-1 in vivo.

The integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a major signaling integrator in mammalian cells and plays an important role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human cancers, but its mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the importance and mechanisms of ILK in bladder cancer progression. When the expression of ILK in bladder cancer cell lines and N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN)-induced murine bladder cancer was evaluated, ILK has a tendency to be overexpressed in invasive cell lines and invasive BBN-induced murine bladder cancer. Overexpression of ILK in 253J bladder cancer cells suppressed E-cadherin expression, resulting in the promotion of cell invasion. Conversely, ILK knockdown by siRNA suppresses cell invasion in invasive bladder cancer cells through the regulation of E-cadherin or matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9). To regulate E-cadherin expression, our results showed that the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)-Zeb1 pathway may play an important role downstream of ILK. Finally, the results of a human bladder tissue microarray (TMA) showed that ILK expression correlates with the invasiveness of human bladder cancer. Our study suggests that ILK is overexpressed in invasive bladder cancer and plays an important role in the EMT of bladder cancer via the control of E-cadherin and MMP-9 expression. ILK may be a new molecular target to suppress tumor progression in advanced and high-risk bladder cancer patients.""","""['Yoshiyuki Matsui', 'Kiran Assi', 'Osamu Ogawa', 'Peter A Raven', 'Shoukat Dedhar', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Baljinder Salh', 'Alan I So']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Downregulation of integrin-linked kinase inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in bladder cancer cells.', 'Down-regulating ribonuclease inhibitor enhances metastasis of bladder cancer cells through regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and ILK signaling pathway.', 'A novel role of ribonuclease inhibitor in regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ILK signaling pathway in bladder cancer cells.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer progression: a crucial role for the endothelin axis.', 'The focal adhesion protein Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK) as an important player in breast cancer pathogenesis.', 'Integrin-linked kinase (ILK): the known vs. the unknown and perspectives.', 'Circular RNA circ_0000515 adsorbs miR-542-3p to accelerate bladder cancer progression via up-regulating ILK expression.', 'A Potential Role for Integrin-Linked Kinase in Colorectal Cancer Growth and Progression via Regulating Senescence and Immunity.', 'Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2): Novel targets in EGFR-mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).', 'Understanding the biology of urothelial cancer metastasis.']"""

No such studies have examined this association in Texas, a large state with significant ethnic and racial diversity. The objective of this analysis was to determine whether racial disparities in survival for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Texas from 1995 through 2002 remained after adjusting for SES, rural residence, and stage of disease.  Methods:   A cohort of 87,449 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer was identified from the Texas Cancer Registry. The SES measure was based on census tract data reflecting median household income, median home value, and percentages of men living below poverty, with a college education, and with a management or professional occupation. The 5-year survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for race and all-cause and disease-specific mortality.  Results:   After adjusting for SES, age, stage of disease, tumor grade, year of diagnosis, and rural residence, both black and Hispanic men were more likely (adjusted HR [aHR], 1.70 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.58-1.83] and aHR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.02-1.20], respectively) to die of prostate cancer compared with white men. The pattern of survival disadvantage for black men held for those diagnosed with localized disease and advanced disease, and for those with an unknown stage of disease at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Substantial racial disparities in prostate cancer survival were found for men in Texas.

Here, we evaluate the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) as an immunological target, seeking to identify HLA-A2-restricted epitopes recognized by T cells in prostate cancer patients. Ten AR LBD-derived, HLA-A2-binding peptides were identified and ranked with respect to HLA-A2 affinity and were used to culture peptide-specific T cells from HLA-A2+ prostate cancer patients. These T-cell cultures identified peptide-specific T cells specific for all ten peptides in at least one patient, and T cells specific for peptides AR805 and AR811 were detected in over half of patients. Peptide-specific CD8+ T-cell clones were then isolated and characterized for prostate cancer cytotoxicity and cytokine expression, identifying that AR805 and AR811 CD8+ T-cell clones could lyse prostate cancer cells in an HLA-A2-restricted fashion, but only AR811 CTL had polyfunctional cytokine expression. Epitopes were confirmed using immunization studies in HLA-A2 transgenic mice, in which the AR LBD is an autologous antigen with an identical protein sequence, which showed that mice immunized with AR811 developed peptide-specific CTL that lyse HLA-A2+ prostate cancer cells. These data show that AR805 and AR811 are HLA-A2-restricted epitopes for which CTL can be commonly detected in prostate cancer patients. Moreover, CTL responses specific for AR811 can be elicited by direct immunization of A2/DR1 mice.

We identified 7 negative androgen-response elements (nARE) in the negative androgen-response region in the TGF-β1 promoter. Each nARE is composed of 15 nucleotides and mediates androgen-dependent inhibition of transcription in close proximity of pAREs. The 5' portions of nAREs are highly conserved and resemble core half sites in pAREs. The nAREs interacted weakly with AR DNA-binding domain (AR DBD) in gel shift assays. Mutations on the conserved nucleotides in the nARE abolished its interaction with the AR DBD and abolished its inhibition of androgen-driven transcription, suggesting that nARE/AR interaction is essential for nARE-mediated inhibition of transcription.

Methods:   To evaluate the current guideline, we compared the area under the curve of a multivariable model for prostate cancer including age, PSA, DRE, family history, and prior biopsy, with and without PSA velocity, in 5519 men undergoing biopsy, regardless of clinical indication, in the control arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. We also evaluated the clinical implications of using PSA velocity cut points to determine biopsy in men with low PSA and negative DRE in terms of additional cancers found and unnecessary biopsies conducted. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Incorporation of PSA velocity led to a very small increase in area under the curve from 0.702 to 0.709. Improvements in predictive accuracy were smaller for the endpoints of high-grade cancer (Gleason score of 7 or greater) and clinically significant cancer (Epstein criteria). Biopsying men with high PSA velocity but no other indication would lead to a large number of additional biopsies, with close to one in seven men being biopsied. PSA cut points with a comparable specificity to PSA velocity cut points had a higher sensitivity (23% vs 19%), particularly for high-grade (41% vs 25%) and clinically significant (32% vs 22%) disease.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic agents that can prevent the emergence of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). HSP90 is a molecular chaperone involved in the stability of many client proteins including Akt and androgen receptor (AR). 17-Allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG) has been reported to inhibit tumor growth in various cancers; however, it induces tumor progression in the bone microenvironment.  Methods:   Cell growth, apoptosis, and AR transactivation were examined by crystal violet assay, flow cytometric, and luciferase assays, respectively. The consequence of HSP90 therapy in vivo was evaluated in LNCaP xenograft model. The consequence of PF-04928473 therapy on bone metastasis was studied using an osteoclastogenesis in vitro assay.  Results:   PF-04928473 inhibits cell growth in a panel of prostate cancer cells, induces cell-cycle arrest at sub-G(1), and leads to apoptosis and increased caspase-3 activity. These biological events were accompanied by decreased activation of Akt and Erk as well as decreased expression of Her2, and decreased AR expression and activation in vitro. In contrast to 17-AAG, PF-04928473 abrogates RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation by affecting NF-κB activation and Src phosphorylation. Finally, PF-04929113 inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival compared with controls. Surprisingly, PF-04929113 did not reduce serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in vivo; in parallel, these decrease in tumor volume.

However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-145 downregulation are not fully understood. Here, we reported that miR-145 was silenced through DNA hypermethylation and p53 mutation status in laser capture microdissected (LCM) prostate cancer and matched adjacent normal tissues. In 22 of 27 (81%) prostate tissues, miR-145 was significantly downregulated in the cancer compared with the normal tissues. Further studies on miR-145 downregulation mechanism showed that miR-145 is methylated at the promoter region in both prostate cancer tissues and 50 different types of cancer cell lines. In seven cancer cell lines with miR-145 hypermethylation, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment dramatically induced miR-145 expression. Interestingly, we also found a significant correlation between miR-145 expression and the status of p53 gene in both LCM prostate tissues and 47 cancer cell lines. In 29 cell lines with mutant p53, miR-145 levels were downregulated in 28 lines (97%), whereas in 18 cell lines with wild-type p53 (WT p53), miR-145 levels were downregulated in only 6 lines (33%, P < 0.001). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that p53 binds to the p53 response element upstream of miR-145, but the binding was inhibited by hypermethylation. To further confirm that p53 binding to miR-145 could regulate miR-145 expression, we transfected WT p53 and MUT p53 into PC-3 cells and found that miR-145 is upregulated by WT p53 but not with MUTp53. The apoptotic cells are increased after WT p53 transfection.

Methods and materials:   Dosimetry from 107 prostate implants performed at the Philadelphia Veterans Medical Center used immediate postprocedural CT image sets. D(90) values were adjusted for volume differences from planning volumes. Medical events (MEs) determined from the volume-corrected data were compared with an activity-based metric.  Results:   Examination of images using original and third-party reviewed prostate contours revealed 56 and 62 cases with D(90) values <80% of the prescription dose, respectively. Because postprocedural prostate volumes were on average 55.7% larger than the planned volume, clinical nomogram-based doses using the implanted activity and actual volumes found 34-47 implants failing to achieve doses greater than 80% of the prescription dose. Volume correction identified 20 MEs, 9 cases with D(90) values within 4% of the ME threshold and 11 significantly inferior cases with median D(90) values <52% of the prescribed dose. Eleven implants also had 20% or more seeds beyond the treatment site according to an activity metric recommended by the VHA Blue Ribbon Panel.

Results:   Within individual patients, a consistently higher Cpeak and faster Wash-in were present in cancerous compared to benign prostatic tissue. Both the TTP and the Wash-out occurred more rapidly in tumour tissue than in normal prostatic tissue. Despite a considerable inter-patient overlap of parameter values between tumour and normal prostatic tissue, area under the ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the Wash-in was a good discriminator for cancer and benign tissue (AUC 0.82).

Yet, there is little data in the literature correlating the ""willingness to recommend"" question with commonly used perceived service quality items in surveys to identify the key drivers of the optimal patient experience. We therefore evaluated the relationship between perceived service quality and subsequent single top box ""willingness to recommend"" scores among oncology patients.  Methods:   A total of 2018 returning cancer patients treated at Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA) responded to an internally developed service quality questionnaire, which covered the following dimensions: operations and services, treatment and care with a multidisciplinary team and patient endorsements. Items were measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from ""completely dissatisfied"" to ""completely satisfied."" Patient willingness to, ""recommend this facility to friends and associates"" was measured on an 11-point scale ranging from ""not at all likely"" to ""extremely likely"", which was subsequently dichotomized into two categories: top box response (10) versus all others (0-9). The relationship between perceived service quality and ""willingness to recommend"" was assessed via Kendall's tau b correlation and univariate and multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   Of the 2018 patients, 959 were newly diagnosed while 1059 were previously treated. 902 were males and 1116 females. The mean age was 54.2 years and the most frequent diagnoses were breast (412), lung (294), prostate (260), colorectal (179) and pancreas (169). 1553 patients said they were ""extremely likely"" to recommend CTCA to friends and associates, resulting in 77% ""top box"" responses while 465 (23%) responded in all other categories. The key service quality drivers that were statistically significant in the final logistic model were ""team helping you understand your medical condition"", ""staff genuinely caring for you as an individual"", ""whole person approach to patient care"" and ""CTCA medical oncologist.""  Conclusions:   In this multi-center study, we demonstrate the predictive significance of perceived service quality as it relates to patient willingness to recommend an oncology service provider. This study is unique in reporting on the role of perceived service quality as a predictor of patient willingness to recommend in a large sample of cancer patients.""","""['Christopher G Lis', 'Mark Rodeghier', 'Digant Gupta']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['Distribution and determinants of patient satisfaction in oncology with a focus on health related quality of life.', 'Self-rated health supersedes patient satisfaction with service quality as a predictor of survival in prostate cancer.', 'Patient satisfaction in otolaryngology: Can academic institutions compete?', 'Level of Patient Satisfaction with Inpatient Services and Its Determinants: A Study of a Specialized Hospital in Ethiopia.', 'Quality Measurement in Cancer Care: A Review and Endorsement of High-Impact Measures and Concepts.', 'Effect of patient-related factors on hospitalization service satisfaction and recommendation intention of medical institutions in Korea.', 'Understanding Patient Experience with Outpatient Cancer Rehabilitation Care.', 'A Social Network Approach to the Estimation of Perceived Quality of Health Care.', 'Perception of quality of care of patients with potentially severe diseases evaluated at a distinct quick diagnostic delivery model: a cross-sectional study.', 'Teaching and assessing professionalism in medical learners and practicing physicians.']"""

Gly388Arg polymorphism in FGFR4 gene has been reported to be involved in prostate cancer incidence and aggressiveness in several studies. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed.  Methods:   Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to assess the association.  Results:   The Arg388 allele increased prostate cancer risk compared with Gly388 allele (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.07-1.29). When stratified by race, there was a significantly increased prostate cancer risk in Asian and Caucasian populations. Moreover, prostate cancer patients with Arg/Arg genotype had a 1.34-fold increased risk of advanced prostate cancer (95% CI: 1.03-1.74) compared with those with Gly/Gly+Gly/Arg genotype.  Conclusion:   This meta-analysis showed the evidence that FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer development and progression, suggesting that FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism could be a marker for prostate cancer development and progression.""","""['Bin Xu', 'Na Tong', 'Shu Q Chen', 'Li X Hua', 'Zeng J Wang', 'Zheng D Zhang', 'Ming Chen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Polymorphisms of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 have association with the development of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia and the progression of prostate cancer in a Japanese population.', 'FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism and prostate cancer risk in Scottish men.', 'Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 Gly388Arg polymorphism in Chinese gastric cancer patients.', 'FGFR4 transmembrane domain polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis including 8555 subjects.', 'An updated meta-analysis of the association between fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 polymorphisms and susceptibility to cancer.', 'FGFR4 Gly388Arg Polymorphism Reveals a Poor Prognosis, Especially in Asian Cancer Patients: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Effects of FGFR4 G388R, V10I polymorphisms on the likelihood of cancer.', 'FGFR4 Inhibitor BLU9931 Attenuates Pancreatic Cancer Cell Proliferation and Invasion While Inducing Senescence: Evidence for Senolytic Therapy Potential in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Plasma DNA as a ""liquid biopsy"" incompletely complements tumor biopsy for identification of mutations in a case series of four patients with oligometastatic breast cancer.', 'Dissecting the Role of the FGF19-FGFR4 Signaling Pathway in Cancer Development and Progression.']"""

Methods and results:   The European Network of Uropathology is a communication network that includes 335 pathology laboratories in 15 western European countries. A web-based questionnaire was answered by 52.2% of members. Some routines were adopted by a majority: formalin fixation (92.5%), separate containers for tumour and resection base (72%) and embedding of the entire specimen (60%). Cancer along/in adipose tissue would be reported as pT3a by 19.5% and non-invasive urothelial carcinoma in prostatic ducts/glands as pT4a by 16.1%. Papillary urothelial neoplasia of low malignant potential is recognized by 72.6% but rarely reported. Immunohistochemistry is rarely or sometimes used for diagnosing bladder cancer by 91.7%, and the most frequently used markers are CK20 (76.9%), CK7 (66.7%) and Ki67 (38.8%). Only 24.8% report prognostic markers, with Ki67 (84.4%) and p53 (64.4%) being most common. Only 50.9% use the International Society of Urological Pathology 1998/World Health Organization (WHO) 2004 grading system, followed by WHO 1973 (43.4%) and WHO 1999 (31.4%).

Endogenous sex steroids, along with environmental factors (notably diet) and host immune and inflammatory responses, are likely to cooperate in the pathogenesis of the disease. Based on the assumption that a complex endocrine-inflammatory-immune interaction is primarily implicated in human PCa, we have investigated the interplay between sex steroids and inflammation in development and growth of human PCa. To this end, we have assessed nine functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s of five genes involved in sex hormone-related pathways in both hyperplastic and malignant human prostate tissues, as well as in matched controls and in a ""supercontrol"" group composed of male Sicilian centenarians. In particular, the following genes were investigated: AR-OMIM313700, SRD5A2-NM-000348, CYP19-NM-031226, ERS1-NM-001122742, ERS2-NM-001040276. A significant association with PCa was found in seven out of the nine SNPs considered.

Although the role of MMR in prostate carcinogenesis remains unclear, MMR deficiency in Carcinoma Prostate (Pca) could prove to be clinically significant. Thus, the present study investigated the gene expression profile of six major MMR genes, viz. hMLH1, hMSH2, hPMS1, hPMS2, hMSH3, and hMSH6, and polymorphism in hMLH1 and hMSH2 in Pca in Indian population. Further, correlation with clinicopathological parameters was evaluated to establish their role as a potential prognostic marker. A significant downregulation of hMLH1, hMSH2, and hPMS2 expression was observed in Pca compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A greater loss of hPMS2 protein in poorly differentiated tumors was demonstrated, which was in concordance with a significant inverse correlation of hPMS2 gene expression with the Gleason score indicating its significance as a marker for Pca progression. An important association of hMLH1-93G>A polymorphism with the risk of Pca was also identified.

These findings are helping clarify the genomic basis of such diseases, but appear to explain little of disease heritability. This limitation might reflect the focus of conventional GWAS on a small set of the most statistically significant associations with disease. More information might be obtained by analyzing GWAS using a polygenic model, which allows for the possibility that thousands of genetic variants could impact disease. Furthermore, there may exist common polygenic effects between potentially related phenotypes (e.g., prostate and breast cancer). Here we present and apply a polygenic model to GWAS of prostate and breast cancer. Our results indicate that the polygenic model can explain an increasing--albeit low--amount of heritability for both of these cancers, even when excluding the most statistically significant associations. In addition, nonaggressive prostate cancer and breast cancer appear to share a common polygenic model, potentially reflecting a similar underlying biology.
