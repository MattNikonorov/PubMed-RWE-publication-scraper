Procedure:   There were 85 patients with BPRMS enrolled and 63 patients with embryonal non-metastatic BPRMS were analyzed. Fifty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and response was assessed radiographically after 9 weeks. Local therapy with radiation and or surgery was performed based on age, tumor size, and response. Patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy following local control.  Results:   Patient's age ranged from 0 to 16 years with a median follow up of 5.3 years. Eighty nine percent of the patients had IRS group III disease. The 5-year overall survival (OS) for the whole group was 76.3 ± 5.6% and the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) 69.8 ± 6.2%. Seventeen patients underwent preoperative radiochemotherapy followed by tumor resection (5-year-OS: 87.8 ± 8.1%). Eight patients were treated with solely radiochemotherapy (87.5 ± 11.7%). Twenty-five patients received chemotherapy and tumor resection (OS: 83.6 ± 7.5%). Thirteen patients underwent incomplete tumor resection and were treated with radiochemotherapy postoperatively (OS: 39.9 ± 14.8%, P < 0.05 vs. other groups).  Conclusions:   Local therapy is an important factor for prognosis of localized embryonal BPRMS. Inadequate primary or secondary surgery compromises the outcome and should be avoided.

Hsp90 has also been detected on the plasma membrane of cells, and its expression has been suggested to correlate with metastatic potential. We studied the PC3 cell line, which is a highly invasive human prostate cancer cell line, and confirmed that Hsp90 is present on the cell surface of PC3 cells. Interestingly, cell surface Hsp90 was also specifically localized at the leading edge of migrating cells. By using a specific antibody that inhibited cell surface Hsp90, adhesion and invasion of PC3 cells were significantly suppressed in vitro. Concomitantly with these findings, we demonstrated that the inhibition of cell surface Hsp90 not only inhibited the FN-dependent association between FAK, c-Src and integrin β1, but also significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of FAK and c-Src, as well as their downstream targets paxillin and p130Cas. Additionally, the Hsp90 antibody reversed cell invasion stimulated by overexpression of FAK. These data indicate that cell surface Hsp90 is involved in prostate cancer cell invasion through the integrin β1/FAK/c-Src signaling pathway. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of cell surface Hsp90 in cancer invasion. These results suggest that molecular targeting of cell surface Hsp90 may therefore be a novel target for the effective treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Xueguang Liu', 'Zuoqin Yan', 'Liang Huang', 'Muyi Guo', 'Zhigang Zhang', 'Changan Guo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['FAK/c-Src signaling pathway mediates the expression of cell surface HSP90 in cultured human prostate cancer cells and its association with their invasive capability.', 'Activation of the integrin effector kinase focal adhesion kinase in cancer cells is regulated by crosstalk between protein kinase Calpha and the PDZ adapter protein mda-9/Syntenin.', 'The chemopreventive bioflavonoid apigenin inhibits prostate cancer cell motility through the focal adhesion kinase/Src signaling mechanism.', 'The promise of heat shock protein inhibitors in the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Emerging Roles of Extracellular Hsp90 in Cancer.', 'Molecular Chaperones in Osteosarcoma: Diagnosis and Therapeutic Issues.', 'The dark-side of the outside: how extracellular heat shock proteins promote cancer.', 'A Driver Never Works Alone-Interplay Networks of Mutant p53, MYC, RAS, and Other Universal Oncogenic Drivers in Human Cancer.', 'Heat Shock Proteins Are Essential Components in Transformation and Tumor Progression: Cancer Cell Intrinsic Pathways and Beyond.', 'Co-chaperones TIMP2 and AHA1 Competitively Regulate Extracellular HSP90:Client MMP2 Activity and Matrix Proteolysis.']"""

However, the impairment of erectile function (EF) is considered a serious complication of the procedure. To investigate the efficacy of erectile aids following cryotherapy, 93 patients who underwent whole gland prostate cryoablation with required complete medical records were analyzed. The changes in postoperative EF were evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire. Additionally, independent factors that could have a correlation to the postoperative IIEF-5 score or postoperative Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) score were assessed. In the entire cohort, the mean preoperative IIEF-5 score was 7.0 ± 6.2. A total of 72 (77.4%) patients had moderate-to-severe preoperative erectile dysfunction. In longitudinal investigation, the patients using erectile aids showed the ability to recover to baseline after 24 months from cryoablation compared with the patients not using erectile aids. There were significant differences of IIEF-5 scores between these groups at 24 months (7.5 vs 3.0; P = 0.025) and 36 months (8.5 vs 3.5; P = 0.010). In multivariate analysis, the use of erectile aids correlated with restoration of IIEF-5 scores (odds ratio, 5.11; confidence interval (CI), 1.87-13.96; P < 0.001) and lower EPIC sexual bother (coef, 19.61; CI, 0.32-38.89; P = 0.046). Our data indicate that on-demand use of erectile aids could help restore EF and reduce sexual bother after whole gland prostate cryoablation.

Objectives:   To determine the relationship between surgical robot acquisition and changes in volume of radical prostatectomy (RP) at the regional and hospital levels.  Research design:   Retrospective cohort study.  Subjects:   Men undergoing RP for prostate cancer at nonfederal, community hospitals located in the states of Arizona, Florida, Maryland, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, and Washington.  Measures:   Change in number of RPs at the regional and hospital levels before (2001) and after (2005) dissemination of the surgical robot.  Results:   Combining data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases 2001 and 2005 with the 2005 American Hospital Association Survey and publicly available data on robot acquisition, we identified 554 hospitals in 71 hospital referral regions (HRR). The total RPs decreased from 14,801 to 14,420 during the study period. Thirty six (51%) HRRs had at least 1 hospital with a surgical robot by 2005; 67 (12%) hospitals acquired at least 1 surgical robot. Adjusted, clustered generalized estimating equations analysis demonstrated that HRRs with greater numbers of hospitals acquiring robots had higher increases in RPs than HRRs acquiring none (mean changes in RPs for HRRs with 9, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 are 414.9, 189.6, 106.6, 14.7, -11.3, and -41.2; P<0.0001). Hospitals acquiring surgical robots increased RPs by a mean of 29.1 per year, while those without robots experienced a mean change of -4.8, P<0.0001.

Radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy(ADT)is widely used for high-risk prostate cancer. However, there is a considerable overlap of outcomes among risk groups, suggesting that the so-called high-risk prostate cancer group consists of a heterogeneous population in terms of tumor biology. Actually, the over-staging of cT3a PCa is relatively frequent and occurs in 13-27%of cases. Thus, radical prostatectomy(RP)alone is a reasonable treatment option for selected patients with high-risk prostate cancer. RP can provide an excellent biochemical and clinical progression-free survival for these patients if they have a pathologically organ-confined disease, or their tumors are extirpated completely with a negative surgical margin. A thorough preoperative evaluation, including imaging study and the use of a nomogram, is mandatory for selecting candidates appropriate for RP. Our recent study indicates that a positive biopsy core percentage is a strong independent predictor of organ-confined disease in these high-risk patients. In cases of adverse tumor characteristics, such as positive surgical margin, extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion, the patient must be informed of the likelihood of a multimodal approach. The use of adjuvant radiotherapy may be reasonable after recuperation from surgery.

Methods:   A total of 80,781 Koreans who visited the health promotion center of a general hospital were included. There were 729 cases of cancer of any primary site during a 3-year period.

Results:   Serum hs-CRP was significantly higher in cancer cases (2.9 mg/L) than in non-cases (1.4 mg/L; P < 0.0001). With the lowest hs-CRP category (<1 mg/L) as reference, the crude odds ratios (ORs) for cancer were 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16-1.62) for the second highest category (1-3 mg/L) and 2.49 (95% CI = 2.02-3.07) for the highest category (>3 mg/L), and the adjusted ORs for cancer were 1.16 (95% CI = 0.95-1.42) for the second highest category and 1.94 (95% CI = 1.51-2.51) for the highest category.

Here, we examined the potential of SPINK1 as an extracellular therapeutic target in prostate cancer.

Indeed, RWPE cells treated with either rSPINK1 or conditioned medium from 22RV1 prostate cancer cells (SPINK1+/ETS⁻) significantly increased cell invasion and intravasation when compared with untreated cells. In contrast, knockdown of SPINK1 in 22RV1 cells inhibited cell proliferation, cell invasion, and tumor growth in xenograft assays. 22RV1 cell proliferation, invasion, and intravasation were attenuated by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to SPINK1 as well. We also demonstrated that SPINK1 partially mediated its neoplastic effects through interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Administration of antibodies to SPINK1 or EGFR (cetuximab) in mice bearing 22RV1 xenografts attenuated tumor growth by more than 60 and 40%, respectively, or ~75% when combined, without affecting PC3 xenograft (SPINK1⁻/ETS⁻) growth.

We evaluated associations between the 36 polymorphisms and prostate cancer survival, as well as other clinical parameters including age at diagnosis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis, and Gleason score. Two SNPs, rs2735839 at chromosome 19q13 and rs7679673 at 4q24, were associated with prostate cancer-specific survival (P = 7 × 10(-4) and 0.014, respectively). A total of 12 SNPs were associated with other variables (P < 0.05): age at diagnosis, PSA at diagnosis, Gleason score, and/or disease aggressiveness based on D'Amico criteria. Genotype status at rs4054823 was not associated with aggressiveness or outcome.

Materials and methods:   The expression of SDF-1, VEGF, and MMP-9 were measured using immunohistochemistry in 148 CaP patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized disease and in 10 samples of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Results:   In the CaP group, VEGF and MMP-9 were more strongly expressed in the tumor cells compared with the BPH group. High intensity SDF-1, VEGF, and MMP-9 stains in tumor areas strongly correlated with lymph node metastasis, pathologic stage, and differentiation. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that SDF-1, VEGF, and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors for prostate cancer-specific survival. High levels of MMP-9, pathologic stage, and differentiation were associated with prostate cancer-specific survival in univariate analysis but the risk estimate was not significant in multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   High expression levels of SDF-1, VEGF, and MMP-9 are more correlated with lymph node metastatic prostate carcinoma compared with non-lymph-node metastatic cancer.

The expression of NEP in neuronal cells is regulated by intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through its intracellular domain (AICD) facilitating histone acetylation of the NEP promoter and gene transcription. The present study has examined whether similar mechanisms operate in prostate cell lines. The expression of APP and its processing enzymes (β- and γ-secretases) was examined in a number of prostate cell lines, and the effect of γ-secretase inhibition was explored on NEP expression and activity. The potential interaction of AICD with the NEP promoter was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Our results indicated that all key components involved in APP processing were expressed in prostate cancer cell lines but suppression of AICD production using a γ-secretase inhibitor did not decrease NEP expression and activity, and no direct AICD-NEP promoter interaction could be detected. However, histone deacetylase inhibitors (valproate and trichostatin A) caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in NEP expression in PC-3 cells, and combinatorial treatment with the DNA demethylating agent, AzaC, further increased NEP expression levels. Although AICD is detectable in prostate cell lines, it does not appear to regulate NEP by AICD-mediated signalling. Apart from promoter de-methylation, the data suggest that histone acetylation may facilitate partial re-activation of NEP expression in advanced prostate cancer cells. Upregulation of this tumour-suppressing protein may provide a novel therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer.""","""['Yue Hong', 'Caroline Beckett', 'Nikolai D Belyaev', 'Anthony J Turner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""[""Neprilysin and Aβ Clearance: Impact of the APP Intracellular Domain in NEP Regulation and Implications in Alzheimer's Disease."", 'The transcriptionally active amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain is preferentially produced from the 695 isoform of APP in a {beta}-secretase-dependent pathway.', 'The Aβ-clearance protein transthyretin, like neprilysin, is epigenetically regulated by the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain.', 'Neprilysin gene expression requires binding of the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain to its promoter: implications for Alzheimer disease.', 'Beta-amyloid catabolism: roles for neprilysin (NEP) and other metallopeptidases?', 'Neprilysin expression and functions in development, ageing and disease.', 'Curcumin inhibits the AKT/NF-κB signaling via CpG demethylation of the promoter and restoration of NEP in the N2a cell line.', ""Neprilysin and Aβ Clearance: Impact of the APP Intracellular Domain in NEP Regulation and Implications in Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Epigenetic induction of EGR-1 expression by the amyloid precursor protein during exposure to novelty.', ""The Alzheimer's amyloid-degrading peptidase, neprilysin: can we control it?""]"""

If fatal forms of cancer are a highly familial subtype, then familial risk for mortality may exceed that of incidence, which is relevant for clinical decision making and counseling.  Methods:   Ovarian cancer patients in the nationwide Swedish Family Cancer Database were classified according to fatal and nonfatal (incident) family history. Familial risks for incident and fatal ovarian cancer were calculated for offspring based on their parental or sibling family history of any cancer using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for incidence and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for mortality. Offspring without family history were referents.  Results:   The database included 24,757 mothers and 8138 daughters with ovarian cancer. When a mother had ovarian cancer, the SIR for incident ovarian cancer in daughters was 2.69, and when a sister had ovarian cancer it was 3.49. The SMRs for fatal cancer by fatal cancer in probands were 3.39 and 5.80, respectively. For fatal serous cancers among siblings, the SMR was 6.16, compared with 10.01 for the endometrioid type. Ovarian cancer was associated with maternal (SIR, 1.22; SMR, 1.56) and sororal breast cancer (SIR, 1.27). Another discordant association was between ovarian and paternal prostate cancer (SIR, 1.12; SMR, 1.66).

We used Cox regression to identify factors associated with receipt of adjuvant therapies. Health care expenditures within 12 months of diagnosis were compared for RP alone versus RP with adjuvant therapies.  Results:   Biopsy Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen, risk group, and SEER region were significantly associated with receipt of adjuvant treatments (all P<.001). Higher surgeon volume was associated with lower odds of receiving adjuvant therapies (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.78 [P<.001]). Factors associated with increased receipt of adjuvant therapies were positive surgical margins (HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 2.55-3.57 [P<.001]), high-risk group versus low-risk group (HR, 7.65; 95% CI, 5.64-10.37 [P<.001]), lymph node-positive disease (HR, 5.36; 95% CI, 3.71-7.75 [P<.001]), and treatment in Iowa (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.12-3.32 [P = .019]) and New Mexico/Georgia/Hawaii (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.09-3.39 [P = .025]) versus San Francisco SEER regions (baseline).

Treatment of surviving cancer-initiating cells and the ability to metabolize steroids from precursors may be the keystones for the appearance of recurrent tumors. To study this hypothesis, we assessed the expression of several steroidogenic enzymes and stem cell markers in clinical PCa samples and cell cultures during androgen depletion. Gene expression profiles were determined by microarray or qRT-PCR. In addition, we measured cell viability and analyzed stem cell marker expression in DuCaP cells by immunocytochemistry. Seventy patient samples from different stages of PCa, and the PCa cell line DuCaP were included in this study. The androgen receptor (AR) and enzymes (AKR1C3, HSD17B2, HSD17B3, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 ) that are involved in the metabolism of adrenal steroids were upregulated in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In vitro, some DuCaP cells survived androgen depletion, and eventually gave rise to a culture adapted to these conditions. During and after this transition, most of the steroidogenic enzymes were upregulated. These cells also are enriched with stem/progenitor cell markers cytokeratin 5 (CK5) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2).

Here, we show that the recently identified Orai1 protein represents the major molecular component of endogenous store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) in human prostate cancer (PCa) cells, and constitutes the principal source of Ca(2+) influx used by the cell to trigger apoptosis. The downregulation of Orai1, and consequently SOCE, protects the cells from diverse apoptosis-inducing pathways, such as those induced by thapsigargin (Tg), tumor necrosis factor α, and cisplatin/oxaliplatin. The transfection of functional Orai1 mutants, such as R91W, a selectivity mutant, and L273S, a coiled-coil mutant, into the cells significantly decreased both SOCE and the rate of Tg-induced apoptosis. This suggests that the functional coupling of STIM1 to Orai1, as well as Orai1 Ca(2+)-selectivity as a channel, is required for its pro-apoptotic effects. We have also shown that the apoptosis resistance of androgen-independent PCa cells is associated with the downregulation of Orai1 expression as well as SOCE. Orai1 rescue, following Orai1 transfection of steroid-deprived cells, re-established the store-operated channel current and restored the normal rate of apoptosis. Thus, Orai1 has a pivotal role in the triggering of apoptosis, irrespective of apoptosis-inducing stimuli, and in the establishment of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype in PCa cells.""","""['M Flourakis', ""V Lehen'kyi"", 'B Beck', 'M Raphaël', 'M Vandenberghe', 'F V Abeele', 'M Roudbaraki', 'G Lepage', 'B Mauroy', 'C Romanin', 'Y Shuba', 'R Skryma', 'N Prevarskaya']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Cytoskeleton reorganization as an alternative mechanism of store-operated calcium entry control in neuroendocrine-differentiated cells.', 'Enhanced Orai1 and STIM1 expression as well as store operated Ca2+ entry in therapy resistant ovary carcinoma cells.', 'Functional requirement for Orai1 in store-operated TRPC1-STIM1 channels.', 'Contribution of TRPC1 and Orai1 to Ca(2+) entry activated by store depletion.', 'Store-Independent Orai Channels Regulated by STIM.', 'TRPV6 Calcium Channel Targeting by Antibodies Raised against Extracellular Epitopes Induces Prostate Cancer Cell Apoptosis.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Blockade of store-operated calcium entry sensitizes breast cancer cells to cisplatin therapy via modulating inflammatory response.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of Transcriptomic Profiles Identified the Prediction of Prognosis and Drug Sensitivity of Aminopeptidase-Like 1 (NPEPL1) for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'CRAC and SK Channels: Their Molecular Mechanisms Associated with Cancer Cell Development.']"""

As prostate tumours are characterized by nutrient-poor, hypoxic and acidified microenvironments, one mechanism whereby AR signalling may contribute to survival is by promoting adaptation to cellular stress. Here we have identified a novel role for AR in the inhibition of autophagy induced by serum withdrawal. This blockade is attributed to AR-mediated upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78/BiP (Grp78/BiP), and occurs independently of ER stress response pathway activation. Interestingly, AR activation did not affect serum starvation-induced mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition, illustrating that the adaptive role for androgens lies not in the ability to modulate nutrient sensing, but in the promotion of ER stability. Finally, we show that the adaptive advantage conferred by AR-mediated Grp78/BiP upregulation is temporary, as upon chronic serum starvation, AR activation delayed but did not suppress the onset of autophagy and cell death.

The androgen receptor (AR) plays a pivotal role in this transition. To address this transition mystery in prostate cancer, we established an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line (LNCaPdcc), by long-term screening of LNCaP cells in androgen-deprived conditions, to investigate changes of molecular mechanisms before and after androgen withdrawal. We found that LNCaPdcc cells displayed a neuroendocrine morphology, less aggressive growth, and lower expression levels of cell cycle-related factors, although the cell cycle distribution was similar to parental LNCaP cells. Notably, higher protein expression of AR, phospho-Ser(81)-AR, and PSA in LNCaPdcc cells were observed. The nuclear distribution and protein stability of AR increased in LNCaPdcc cells. In addition, cell proliferation results exhibited the biphasic nature of the androgen (R1881) effect in two cell lines. On the other hand, LNCaPdcc cells expressed higher levels of Her2, phospho-Tyr(1221/1222)-Her2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 proteins than parental LNCaP cells. These two cell lines exhibited distinct responses to Her2 activation (by heregulin treatment) on Her2 phosphorylation and Her2 inhibition (by AG825 or Herceptin treatments) on proliferation. In addition, the Her2 inhibitor more effectively caused AR degradation and diminished AR Ser(81) phosphorylation in LNCaPdcc cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Her2 plays an important role in the support of AR protein stability in the transition of androgen requirement in prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   The iterative forward projection matching (IFPM) algorithm was generalized to reconstruct the 3D pose, as well as the centroid, of brachytherapy seeds from three to ten measured 2D projections. The gIFPM algorithm finds the set of seed poses that minimizes the sum-of-squared-difference of the pixel-by-pixel intensities between computed and measured autosegmented radiographic projections of the implant. Numerical simulations of clinically realistic brachytherapy seed configurations were performed to demonstrate the proof of principle. An in-house machined brachytherapy phantom, which supports precise specification of seed position and orientation at known values for simulated implant geometries, was used to experimentally validate this algorithm. The phantom was scanned on an ACUITY CBCT digital simulator over a full 660 sinogram projections. Three to ten x-ray images were selected from the full set of CBCT sinogram projections and postprocessed to create binary seed-only images.  Results:   In the numerical simulations, seed reconstruction position and orientation errors were approximately 0.6 mm and 5 degrees, respectively. The physical phantom measurements demonstrated an absolute positional accuracy of (0.78 +/- 0.57) mm or less. The theta and phi angle errors were found to be (5.7 +/- 4.9) degrees and (6.0 +/- 4.1) degrees, respectively, or less when using three projections; with six projections, results were slightly better. The mean registration error was better than 1 mm/6 degrees compared to the measured seed projections. Each test trial converged in 10-20 iterations with computation time of 12-18 min/iteration on a 1 GHz processor.  Conclusions:   This work describes a novel, accurate, and completely automatic method for reconstructing seed orientations, as well as centroids, from a small number of radiographic projections, in support of intraoperative planning and adaptive replanning. Unlike standard back-projection methods, gIFPM avoids the need to match corresponding seed images on the projections. This algorithm also successfully reconstructs overlapping clustered and highly migrated seeds in the implant. The accuracy of better than 1 mm and 6 degrees demonstrates that gIFPM has the potential to support 2D Task Group 43 calculations in clinical practice.""","""['Damodar Pokhrel', 'Martin J Murphy', 'Dorin A Todor', 'Elisabeth Weiss', 'Jeffrey F Williamson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Localizing intracavitary brachytherapy applicators from cone-beam CT x-ray projections via a novel iterative forward projection matching algorithm.', 'Clinical application and validation of an iterative forward projection matching algorithm for permanent brachytherapy seed localization from conebeam-CT x-ray projections.', 'Prostate brachytherapy seed localization by analysis of multiple projections: identifying and addressing the seed overlap problem.', 'An automatic seed finder for brachytherapy CT postplans based on the Hough transform.', 'A Survey of the Use of Iterative Reconstruction Algorithms in Electron Microscopy.', 'Automatic seed picking for brachytherapy postimplant validation with 3D CT images.', 'Prostate implant reconstruction from C-arm images with motion-compensated tomosynthesis.', 'Localizing intracavitary brachytherapy applicators from cone-beam CT x-ray projections via a novel iterative forward projection matching algorithm.']"""

Any necessary manual correction using the interface is usually straightforward. For the clinical data set tested, neither the number of seeds or needles, average density, nor the presence of clusters was found to have an effect on reconstruction accuracy using this method.

Methods:   The authors used finite element (FE) modeling to simulate bladder wall deformation caused by urine inflow. For ten volunteers, a series of MRI scans of the pelvic area was recorded at regular intervals of 10 min over 1 h. For the series of scans, the bladder volume gradually increased while the rectal volume was constant. The MR image with the bladder volume closest to 250 ml was selected as the reference in each volunteer. All pelvic structures were defined from the reference image including bladder wall, small bowel, prostate (male), uterus (female), rectum, pelvic bone, and the rest of the body. These structures were translated to FE meshes. Using appropriate material properties for all organs, deformations of these organs as a response to changing bladder pressure were computed.  Results:   The computation results showed realistic anisotropic deformation of the bladder wall: The bladder became more elongated in the cranial and anterior directions with increasing bladder volume. After fitting the volume of the computed bladder to the actual bladder volume on the test images, the computed bladder shape agreed well with the real bladder shape (overlap from 0.79 to 0.93). The average mean bladder wall prediction errors of all the volunteers were 0.31 cm average and 0.29 cm SD.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, a FE based mechanical bladder model shows promise for the prediction of the short-term bladder shape change using only one pelvic scan and volume change of the bladder as input. The accuracy levels achieved with this method are likely mostly limited by inaccuracies in material properties and sliding tissue between organs, which has not been modeled. This model can potentially be used to improve image-guided radiotherapy for bladder cancer patients, i.e., by prediction short-term bladder deformation.""","""['Xiangfei Chai', 'Marcel van Herk', 'Jeroen B van de Kamer', 'Maarten C C M Hulshof', 'Peter Remeijer', 'Heidi T Lotz', 'Arjan Bel']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A voxel-based finite element model for the prediction of bladder deformation.', 'A material sensitivity study on the accuracy of deformable organ registration using linear biomechanical models.', 'Reproducibility of the bladder shape and bladder shape changes during filling.', 'A model to predict bladder shapes from changes in bladder and rectal filling.', 'Image-guided radiation therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Biomechanical modelling of the pelvic system: improving the accuracy of the location of neoplasms in MRI-TRUS fusion prostate biopsy.', 'Bladder surface dose modeling in prostate cancer radiotherapy: An analysis of motion-induced variations and the cumulative dose across the treatment.', 'A non-invasive ultrasound imaging method to measure acute radiation-induced bladder wall thickening in rats.', 'Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) for Bioprinting.', 'Effect of body thickness on helical and direct treatment delivery modes: a phantom study.']"""

Before introducing a new device into clinical operations, it is important to assess the reliability and mean time before failure (MTBF) of the system. In this article, the authors present the preclinical evaluation and analysis of the reliability and MTBF of an autonomous robotic system, which is developed for prostate seed implantation.  Methods:   The authors have considered three steps that are important in reliability growth analysis. These steps are: Identification and isolation of failures, classification of failures, and trend analysis. For any one-of-a-kind product, the reliability enhancement is accomplished through test-fix-test. The authors have used failure mode and effect analysis for collection and analysis of reliability data by identifying and categorizing the failure modes. Failures were classified according to severity. Failures that occurred during the operation of this robotic system were considered as nonhomogenous Poisson process. The failure occurrence trend was analyzed using Laplace test. For analyzing and predicting reliability growth, commonly used and widely accepted models, Duane's model and the Army Material Systems Analysis Activity, i.e., Crow's model, were applied. The MTBF was used as an important measure for assessing the system's reliability.  Results:   During preclinical testing, 3196 seeds (in 53 test cases) were deposited autonomously by the robot and 14 critical failures were encountered. The majority of the failures occurred during the first few cases. The distribution of failures followed Duane's postulation as well as Crow's postulation of reliability growth. The Laplace test index was -3.82 (<0), indicating a significant trend in failure data, and the failure intervals lengthened gradually. The continuous increase in the failure occurrence interval suggested a trend toward improved reliability. The MTBF was 592 seeds, which implied that several prostate seed implantation cases would be possible without encountering any critical failure. The shape parameter for the MTBF was 0.3859 (<1), suggesting a positive reliability growth of this robotic system. At 95% confidence, the reliability for deposition of 65 seeds was more than 90%.  Conclusions:   Analyses of failure mode strongly indicated a gradual improvement of reliability of this autonomous robotic system. High MTBF implied that several prostate seed implant cases would be possible without encountering any critical failure.""","""['Tarun K Podder', 'Ivan Buzurovic', 'Ke Huang', 'Timothy Showalter', 'Adam P Dicker', 'Yan Yu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Multi-channel robotic system for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Hazard analysis of EUCLIDIAN: an image-guided robotic brachytherapy system.', 'Design of an ultrasound-guided robotic brachytherapy needle-insertion system.', 'Robotic brachytherapy of the prostate.', 'AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy: report of Task Group 192.', 'Brachytherapy next generation: robotic systems.', 'Portable robot for autonomous venipuncture using 3D near infrared image guidance.']"""

Voxels were labeled as tumor/nontumor via nonlinear supervised classification. Two classification algorithms were tested: Support vector machine (SVM) and AdaBoost.  Results:   Experiments were performed on images from 17 patients. Ground truth was available from histological images.

Conclusions:   Classification using the authors' model combining fractal and multifractal features was more accurate than classification using classical texture features (such as Haralick, wavelet, and Gabor filters).

Therapy with these agents is usually successful in achieving and maintaining castrate levels (< 50 ng/dl) of serum testosterone, but failures have been reported in up to 10% of patients. Traditionally, these patients are offered surgical castration with bilateral orchiectomy. However, the novel LH-RH antagonists may offer a nonsurgical alternative. We describe two patients with advanced prostate cancer who failed to achieve castrate levels of testosterone while on an LH-RH agonist, but subsequently responded to the LH-RH antagonist, degarelix. The first patient is a 63-year-old man who was treated with leuprolide for metastatic prostate cancer. He initially responded with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) that fell to 0.6 ng/ml. However, after 15 months of therapy, his PSA rose to 18.3 ng/ml and his testosterone was noted to be 208 ng/dl. He was switched to degarelix, and 4 weeks later his testosterone was adequately suppressed at 16 ng/dl. The second patient is a 41-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer who was started on leuprolide, but after 3 months of therapy, was found to have a rising PSA and a testosterone of 96 ng/dl. Four weeks after switching to degarelix, his testosterone was 18 ng/dl and his PSA decreased concordantly.

LXT-101 microspheres were prepared by the water/oil/water double emulsion method and the solid/oil/oil method. The results showed that the mechanism of LXT-101 releasing from PLGA 14,000 microspheres was the cooperation of drug diffusion and polymer degradation. This clarified the relationship between the microsphere characterization and hormone level in vivo. The larger microspheres (33 μm) could inhibit the testosterone level to castration for a longer time (35 days) than the smaller microspheres (15 μm, 14 days). The formulation containing the hydrophilic additive (polyethylene glycol 6000) could suppress the testosterone level to castration for a longer time (> 35 days) than the formulation without polyethylene glycol (14 days). The appearance of testis, vesicular seminalis, and prostates changed after treatment. The weights of sexual organs decreased significantly. The in-vivo release of the LXT-101 PLGA 14,000 microspheres curve showed that in-vivo release started immediately after day 1 (22.7%) and was rapid during the first 5 days (40.2% release).

In its function as a cytokine, MIF induces angiogenesis, promotes cell cycle progression, and inhibits apoptosis. Recently, the molecular signal transduction has been specified: MIF has been found to be a ligand to the CD74/CD44-receptor complex and to activate the ERK1/2 MAPK cascade. In addition MIF binds to the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4. This effects an integrin-dependent leukocyte arrest and mediates leukocyte chemotaxis. Recent work has described a clearer role of MIF in GBM tumor cell lines. The current study used human primary GBM cells. We show that inhibition of MIF with ISO-1, an inhibitor of the D-dopachrome tautomerase site of MIF, reduced the growth rate of primary GBM cells in a dose-dependent manner, and in addition ISO-1 increased protein expression of MIF and its receptors CD74, CXCR2, and CXCR4 in vitro but decreased expression of CD44. Furthermore, hypoxia as cell stressor increases the protein expression of MIF in primary GBM cells. These results underscore the importance of MIF in GBM and show that MIF and its receptors may be a promising target for the treatment of malignant gliomas.""","""['Nina Baron', 'Oliver Deuster', 'Carmen Noelker', 'Carsten Stüer', 'Herwig Strik', 'Carlo Schaller', 'Richard Dodel', 'Bernhard Meyer', 'Michael Bacher']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Neurosci Res""","""['Inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor or its receptor (CD74) attenuates growth and invasion of DU-145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Up-regulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor gene and protein expression in glial tumor cells during hypoxic and hypoglycemic stress indicates a critical role for angiogenesis in glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promotes cell survival and proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells.', 'MIF, CD74 and other partners in kidney disease: tales of a promiscuous couple.', 'The role of macrophage inhibitory factor in tumorigenesis and central nervous system tumors.', 'Integration analysis of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal the cellular heterogeneity landscape in glioblastoma and establish a polygenic risk model.', 'Tumor-associated microglia and macrophages in glioblastoma: From basic insights to therapeutic opportunities.', 'Hypoxia Contributes to Poor Prognosis in Primary IDH-wt GBM by Inducing Tumor Cells MES-Like Transformation Trend and Inhibiting Immune Cells Activity.', ""Targeting of CXCR4 by the Naturally Occurring CXCR4 Antagonist EPI-X4 in Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia."", ""CXCR4 in Waldenström's Macroglobulinema: chances and challenges.""]"""

Here we identify the genes and cellular pathways that distinguish high grade from low grade pathologically localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   Cancer cells from low grade (Gleason 3 + 3 = 6) or high grade (4 + 4 = 8) tumors of men with localized disease were isolated by laser capture micro-dissection. Expression profiling was conducted across 18,344 unique annotated genes and data were analyzed using packages from the R/Bioconductor project to determine differential gene expression and perform gene set enrichment analysis. Publically available expression data was retrieved and analyzed individually in the same manner and in cross platform meta-analyses.  Results:   Six hundred seventy genes were differentially expressed between Gleason sum 6 and 8 tumors with a false discovery rate of <5% (P < 0.0014) including genes previously shown to mediate prostate cancer survival, proliferation, and metastasis. Functional themes associated with Gleason grade included developmental processes, signal transduction, chemokine and embryonic stem cell pathways with specific enrichment of the androgen receptor, EGFR, TNF-alpha, and Notch signaling cascades.  Conclusions:   In addition to androgen receptor signaling, growth factor, and cytokine mediated pathways are active in clinically localized high grade prostate cancer.

Out of 83 patients with prostate cancer, 42 (51%) had Gleason score 6 (12 (28.5%) presented a MS) and 41 (49%) a Gleason score ≥7 (25 (61%) presented a MS). The presence of MS was not associated with an increased risk prostate cancer (OR: 0.97, P = 0.94) but with an increased risk of Gleason ≥7 (OR: 3.82; P = 0.013).  Conclusions:   In our single center study, MS is associated with an increased risk of high grade Gleason score when prostate cancer is diagnosed on biopsy. However, these results should be confirmed in a larger multicenter study. .""","""['Cosimo De Nunzio', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Roberto Miano', 'Alberto Trucchi', 'Andrea Cantiani', 'Alfonso Carluccini', 'Andrea Tubaro']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The uncertain relationship between obesity and prostate cancer: an Italian biopsy cohort analysis.', 'Abdominal obesity as risk factor for prostate cancer diagnosis and high grade disease: a prospective multicenter Italian cohort study.', 'The role of the digital rectal examination as diagnostic test for prostate cancer detection in obese patients.', 'Metabolic abnormalities linked to an increased cardiovascular risk are associated with high-grade prostate cancer: a single biopsy cohort analysis.', 'Role of Metabolic Syndrome in Prostate Cancer Development.', 'Physical Inactivity, Metabolic Syndrome and Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Development of a Predicting Nomogram.', 'Metabolic Syndrome and Physical Inactivity May Be Shared Etiological Agents of Prostate Cancer and Coronary Heart Diseases.', 'The accumulation of metabolic syndrome components is associated with higher risk of positive surgical margin among patients with localized prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Metabolic Alterations, Aggressive Hormone-Naïve Prostate Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease: A Complex Relationship.', 'Clinical association of metabolic syndrome, C-reactive protein and testosterone levels with clinically significant prostate cancer.']"""

As omega-3 fatty acids possess known antioxidant properties, we investigated the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA-22:6n-3), one component of fish oil, in modulating the effects of oxidative DNA damage in LNCaP and PacMetUT1 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells and in a normal human prostate cell line, PrEC.  Methods:   Cell survival was determined by an inhibition of colony formation assay. DNA double-strand breaks, NF-κB subcellular localization and relative survivin expression levels were determined by immunofluorescence and survivin expression levels confirmed by immunoblot assay. Measurement of NF-κB transcriptional activity was investigated by dual luciferase assay.  Results:   LNCaP and PacMetUT1 cells pretreated with DHA and pulsed with 32 µM H(2) O(2) exhibit decreased survival compared to PrEC. γ-H2AX foci, indicating DNA double-strand breaks, were associated with translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, whereas exposure to DHA prior to H(2) O(2) treatment prevented NF-κB translocation. Further, DHA attenuated H(2) O(2) -induced NF-κB transcriptional activity and diminished expression of the downstream target, survivin.  Conclusions:   NF-κB is heavily implicated in promoting prosurvival signaling and may be critical for resistance to the chronic oxidative stress observed in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Our studies indicate that exposure of cells to physiologically achievable levels of DHA prior to treatment with H(2) O(2) results in decreased cancer cell survival which is associated with nuclear exclusion of NF-κB. We therefore propose that DHA selectively sensitizes prostate cancer cells to growth arrest through attenuation of the NF-κB survival pathway.""","""['David A Cavazos', 'Ramona S Price', 'Shruti S Apte', 'Linda A deGraffenried']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Novel signaling molecules implicated in tumor-associated fatty acid synthase-dependent breast cancer cell proliferation and survival: Role of exogenous dietary fatty acids, p53-p21WAF1/CIP1, ERK1/2 MAPK, p27KIP1, BRCA1, and NF-kappaB.', 'Docosahexaenoic acid enhances the efficacy of docetaxel in prostate cancer cells by modulation of apoptosis: the role of genes associated with the NF-kappaB pathway.', 'A combination of docosahexaenoic acid and celecoxib prevents prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and is associated with modulation of nuclear factor-kappaB, and steroid hormone receptors.', 'Docosahexaenoic Acid Induces Oxidative DNA Damage and Apoptosis, and Enhances the Chemosensitivity of Cancer Cells.', 'NF-kappaB: a potential target for cancer chemoprevention and therapy.', 'N-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Their Lipid Mediators as A Potential Immune-Nutritional Intervention: A Molecular and Clinical View in Hepatic Disease and Other Non-Communicable Illnesses.', 'Supplementation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and aerobic exercise improve functioning, morphology, and redox balance in prostate obese rats.', 'Investigation into the distinct subcellular effects of docosahexaenoic acid loaded low-density lipoprotein nanoparticles in normal and malignant murine liver cells.', 'Fish-Derived Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Cancer Risk and Eicosanoid Production: Interaction between the Protective Effect of Long Chain Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Intake and Genotype.']"""

These findings support a role for AR in cell migration and invasiveness. However, the molecular mechanism involved in AR-mediated cell migration still remains elusive.  Methodology/principal findings:   Mouse embryo NIH3T3 fibroblasts and highly metastatic human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells harbor low levels of transcriptionally incompetent AR. We now report that, through extra nuclear action, AR triggers migration of both cell types upon stimulation with physiological concentrations of the androgen R1881. We analyzed the initial events leading to androgen-induced cell migration and observed that challenging NIH3T3 cells with 10 nM R1881 rapidly induces interaction of AR with filamin A (FlnA) at cytoskeleton. AR/FlnA complex recruits integrin beta 1, thus activating its dependent cascade. Silencing of AR, FlnA and integrin beta 1 shows that this ternary complex controls focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin and Rac, thereby driving cell migration. FAK-null fibroblasts migrate poorly and Rac inhibition by EHT impairs motility of androgen-treated NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, FAK and Rac activation by androgens are independent of each other. Findings in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells strengthen the role of Rac in androgen signaling. The Rac inhibitor significantly impairs androgen-induced migration in these cells. A mutant AR, deleted of the sequence interacting with FlnA, fails to mediate FAK activation and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation in androgen-stimulated cells, further reinforcing the role of AR/FlnA interaction in androgen-mediated motility.  Conclusions/significance:   The present report, for the first time, indicates that the extra nuclear AR/FlnA/integrin beta 1 complex is the key by which androgen activates signaling leading to cell migration.

A few studies have reported chromosomal changes on 12p and 12q that occur during the onset and development of PCa but to date no consistent association of the disease with chromosome 12 polymorphic variation has been identified. In order to unravel genetic risk factors that underlie PCa health disparities we investigated chromosome 12 using ancestry informative markers (AIMs), which allow us to distinguish genomic regions of European or West African origin, and tested them for association with PCa. Additional SNPs were genotyped in those areas where significant signals of association were detected. The strongest signal was discovered at the SNP rs12827748, located upstream of the PAWR gene, a tumor suppressor, which is amply expressed in the prostate. The most frequent allele in Europeans was the risk allele among African Americans. We also examined vitamin D related genes, VDR and CYP27B1, and found a significant association of PCa with the TaqI polymorphism (rs731236) in the former.

As a result, IMRT is in widespread use across diverse indications. However, the inherent nature of IMRT delivery makes it monitor unit inefficient and leads to increased normal tissue integral dose. This in turn may result in an increased risk of radiation-induced second malignancies.  Aim:   To calculate the risk of second malignancy post-IMRT.  Settings and design:   Observational study in a tertiary care institute.  Materials and methods:   Eighteen previously untreated patients with head and neck cancers (n = 10) and prostate cancer (n = 8) were selected. In these patients, selected infield organs around the planning target volume were contoured, viz. brain and thyroid in patients with head and neck cancer and bladder, rectum and small intestine in patients with carcinoma prostate. The estimates of radiation-induced malignancies in these organs and the whole of the body were derived using the concept of Organ Equivalent Dose.  Statistical analysis used:   Descriptive statistics (SPSS version 12).  Results:   The modal estimated incidence of radiation-induced malignancies was 129.87, 1.4, 0.10, 3.42, 7.789 and 129.85 per 10,000 person-years for the brain, thyroid, bladder, rectum, small intestine and whole body respectively.  Conclusions:   The estimated risk of radiation-induced malignancies in the thyroid and rectum was similar to the available literature, while the risk for bladder carcinomas was lower than that reported. However, the calculated risk of radiation-induced tumors of the brain was more than that reported with conventional radiation therapy.

Patients and methods:   We conducted a 10-year competing risk analysis of 19,639 men 66 years of age and older identified by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program linked to Medicare program files. All men were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and received no surgery or radiation within 180 days of diagnosis. The analysis was stratified by tumor grade and stage and by age and comorbidity at diagnosis classified using the Charlson comorbidity index. Underlying causes of death were obtained from SEER.  Results:   During the first 10 years after diagnosis, men with moderately and poorly differentiated prostate cancer were more likely to die from causes other than their disease. Depending on patient age, Gleason score, and number of comorbidities present at diagnosis, 5-year overall mortality rates for men with stage T1c disease ranged from 11.7% (95% CI, 10.2% to 13.1%) to 65.7% (95% CI, 55.9% to 70.1%), and prostate cancer-specific mortality rates ranged from 1.1% (95% CI, 0.0% to 2.7%) to 16.3% (95% CI, 13.8% to 19.4%). Ten-year overall mortality rates ranged from 28.8% (95% CI, 25.3% to 32.6%) to 94.3% (95% CI, 87.4% to 100%), and prostate cancer-specific mortality rates ranged from 2.0% (95% CI, 0.0% to 5.3%) to 27.5% (95% CI, 21.5% to 36.5%).

Here, the RhoA effector protein kinase C-related kinase (PRK) 1 was identified as an interactant of both TPα and ΤPβ involving common and unique sequences within their respective C-terminal (C)-tail domains and the kinase domain of PRK1 (PRK1(640-942)). Although the interaction with PRK1 is constitutive, agonist activation of TPα/TPβ did not regulate the complex per se but enhanced PRK1 activation leading to phosphorylation of its general substrate histone H1 in vitro. Altered PRK1 and TP expression and signaling are increasingly implicated in certain neoplasms, particularly in androgen-associated prostate carcinomas. Agonist activation of TPα/TPβ led to phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr(11) (H3 Thr(11)), a previously recognized specific marker of androgen-induced chromatin remodeling, in the prostate LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines but not in primary vascular smooth muscle or endothelial cells. Moreover, this effect was augmented by dihydrotestosterone in androgen-responsive LNCaP but not in nonresponsive PC-3 cells. Furthermore, PRK1 was confirmed to constitutively interact with TPα/TPβ in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells, and targeted disruption of PRK1 impaired TPα/TPβ-mediated H3 Thr(11) phosphorylation in, and cell migration of, both prostate cell types. Collectively, considering the role of TXA(2) as a potent mediator of RhoA signaling, the identification of PRK1 as a bona fide interactant of TPα/TPβ, and leading to H3 Thr(11) phosphorylation to regulate cell migration, has broad functional significance such as within the vasculature and in neoplasms in which both PRK1 and the TPs are increasingly implicated.""","""['Elizebeth C Turner', 'David J Kavanagh', 'Eamon P Mulvaney', 'Caitriona McLean', 'Katarina Wikström', 'Helen M Reid', 'B Therese Kinsella']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Identification of an interaction between the TPα and TPβ isoforms of the human thromboxane A2 receptor with protein kinase C-related kinase (PRK) 1.

Materials and methods:   The study was ethics committee approved. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Twenty-eight patients referred for HIFU prostate cancer ablation underwent contrast-enhanced prostate US before treatment, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and repeat contrast-enhanced US 1-3 days after treatment, and contrast-enhanced US-guided biopsy 30-45 days after treatment. The contrast-enhanced US enhancement patterns of the biopsy sites--assigned a score of S0 for no enhancement, S1 for mild and/or patchy enhancement, or S2 for marked enhancement--were compared with corresponding biopsy findings, which were assigned a score of B0 for necrosis and/or fibrosis without viable prostate gland tissue, B1 for vascularized tissue without viable gland tissue, or B2 for viable gland tissue (benign or malignant). Then, six additional patients underwent contrast-enhanced prostate US 15-30 minutes and 1 day after HIFU ablation, and the results of these two US examinations were compared.  Results:   Contrast-enhanced US performed on days 1-3 and days 30-45 after HIFU ablation depicted a large devascularized zone with peripheral enhancing areas that were localized anteriorly in all 28 patients, posteriorly in nine, laterally in five, and at the apex in 20 patients. MR findings were concordant. At biopsy, viable gland tissue was found at nine (6.2%) of 146 S0 sites, 10 (34%) of 29 S1 sites, and 44 (60%) of 73 S2 sites. The odds ratios for finding viable tissue (score B1 or B2) at S1 and S2 sites as opposed to S0 sites were 21 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6, 71) and 73 (95% CI: 22, 243), respectively (P < .0001). Contrast-enhanced US performed 15-30 minutes and 1 day after treatment in the six additional patients had similar findings.

Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is a member of the CT-X family of CTAs that in addition to testis, is highly expressed in the fetal prostate, and may also play an important role both in benign and malignant prostate diseases. However, the function of this gene remains poorly understood. Here, we show that PAGE4 is a highly (100%) intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). The primary protein sequence conforms to the features of a typical IDP sequence and the secondary structure prediction algorithm metaPrDOS strongly supported this prediction. Furthermore, SDS-gel electrophoresis and analytical size exclusion chromatography of the recombinant protein revealed an anomalous behavior characteristic of IDPs. UV circular dichroism (CD) and NMR spectroscopy confirmed that PAGE4 is indeed a highly disordered protein. In further bioinformatic analysis, the PredictNLS algorithm uncovered a potential nuclear localization signal, whereas the algorithm DBS-Pred returned a 99.1% probability that PAGE4 is a DNA-binding protein. Consistent with this prediction, biochemical experiments showed that PAGE4 preferentially binds a GC-rich sequence. Silencing PAGE4 expression induced cell death via apoptosis and in mice carrying PCa xenografts, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the PAGE4 mRNA attenuated tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, overexpressing PAGE4 protected cells from stress-induced death. To our knowledge, PAGE4 is the first example of a CTA that is an IDP with an anti-apoptotic function.""","""['Yu Zeng', 'Yanan He', 'Fan Yang', 'Steven M Mooney', 'Robert H Getzenberg', 'John Orban', 'Prakash Kulkarni']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Re: The cancer/testis antigen prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is a highly intrinsically disordered protein.', 'The Stress-response protein prostate-associated gene 4, interacts with c-Jun and potentiates its transactivation.', 'Phosphorylation-induced Conformational Ensemble Switching in an Intrinsically Disordered Cancer/Testis Antigen.', 'Cancer/Testis Antigens: ""Smart"" Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate and Other Cancers.', 'Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4), an intrinsically disordered cancer/testis antigen, is a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer/testis antigen PAGE4, a regulator of c-Jun transactivation, is phosphorylated by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1, a component of the stress-response pathway.', 'Biology of Cancer-Testis Antigens and Their Therapeutic Implications in Cancer.', 'Illuminating Intrinsically Disordered Proteins with Integrative Structural Biology.', 'Protein conformational dynamics and phenotypic switching.', 'The expression, modulation and use of cancer-testis antigens as potential biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Intrinsically Disordered Proteins: Insights from Poincaré, Waddington, and Lamarck.']"""

Methods:   Focus group discussions were tape recorded and transcribed, and content analysis was performed for emergent themes.  Main research variables:   Perceptions regarding prostate cancer, barriers and facilitators to prostate cancer screening, and culturally relevant interventional strategies.  Findings:   Perceptions of prostate cancer included fatalism, hopelessness, and dread. Misconceptions regarding causes of prostate cancer, such as frequency of sexual activity, were identified. Barriers to prostate cancer screening included lack of awareness of the need for screening, reticence to seek health care when feeling well, fear of cancer diagnosis, financial issues, time constraints, and embarrassment. Presence of urinary symptoms, personal experience with family or friends who had cancer, and receiving recommendations from a healthcare provider regarding screening were facilitators for screening. Potential culturally relevant interventional strategies to promote prostate cancer screening included screening recommendations from healthcare professionals and cancer survivors; radio or television commercials and newspaper articles targeting the Filipino community; informational brochures in Tagalog, Ilocano, or English; and interactive, educational forums facilitated by multilingual Filipino male healthcare professionals.

Then we use multidimensional tensor-product interpolation to simulate images of needles with arbitrary poses and positions using collected images. After further processing, the interpolated needle and seed images are superimposed on top of phantom or tissue image backgrounds. The similarity between the simulated and the real images is measured using a correlation metric. A comparison is also performed with in vivo images obtained during prostate brachytherapy. Our results, carried out for both the convex (transverse plane) and linear (sagittal/para-sagittal plane) arrays of a trans-rectal transducer indicate that our interpolation method produces good results while requiring modest computing resources.

We examined human prostate cancer cell lines and clinical prostate cancer specimens for additional bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell properties.  Experimental design:   Prostate cancer cell lines were induced for osteoblastogenic and adipogenic differentiation, detected by standard staining methods and confirmed by lineage-specific marker expression. Abnormal expression of the markers was then assessed in clinical prostate cancer specimens.  Results:   After osteoblastogenic induction, cells of the LNCaP lineage, PC-3 lineage, and DU145 displayed osteoblastic features. Upon adipogenic induction, PC-3 lineage and DU145 cells differentiated into adipocyte-like cells. The adipocyte-like cancer cells expressed brown adipocyte-specific markers, suggesting differentiation along the brown adipocyte lineage. The adipogenic differentiation was accompanied by growth inhibition, and most of the adipocyte-like cancer cells were committed to apoptotic death. During cyclic treatments with adipogenic differentiation medium and then with control medium, the cancer cells could commit to repeated adipogenic differentiation and retrodifferentiation. In clinical prostate cancer specimens, the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a brown fat-specific marker, was enhanced with the level of expression correlated to disease progression from primary to bone metastatic cancers.  Conclusions:   This study thus revealed that prostate cancer cells harbor the stem cell properties of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The abnormally expressed adipogenic UCP1 protein may serve as a unique marker, while adipogenic induction can be explored as a differentiation therapy for prostate cancer progression and bone metastasis.""","""['Haiyen E Zhau', 'Hui He', 'Christopher Y Wang', 'Majd Zayzafoon', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Fray F Marshall', 'Leland W K Chung', 'Ruoxiang Wang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Regulation of human skeletal stem cells differentiation by Dlk1/Pref-1.', 'Oxysterols regulate differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells: pro-bone and anti-fat.', 'Human osteoblasts derived from mesenchymal stem cells express adipogenic markers upon coculture with bone marrow adipocytes.', 'Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells: fat on and blast off by FGF21.', 'Marrow adipogenic lineage precursor: A new cellular component of marrow adipose tissue.', 'Osteogenic and Adipogenic Differentiation Potential of Oral Cancer Stem Cells May Offer New Treatment Modalities.', 'Obesity-Related Cross-Talk between Prostate Cancer and Peripheral Fat: Potential Role of Exosomes.', 'Drug-Initiated Activity Metabolomics Identifies Myristoylglycine as a Potent Endogenous Metabolite for Human Brown Fat Differentiation.', 'A Novel Overall Survival Prediction Signature Based on Comprehensive Research in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.', 'Integrated regulation of chondrogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells and differentiation of cancer cells.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 46 patients who underwent prostatic MRI examination at 1.5 T MRI and ""subsequently"" radical prostatectomy. All MR-images were reevaluated by two different experienced radiologists (15 and 1.5 years of experience) with special focus on T2/T3 differentiation. Both radiologists were not aware of the patient's clinical data, except that the patient had prostate cancer. These findings were compared with histopathologic whole mount step section prostate specimens, which served as the ""gold standard"". Fourfold tables were created to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and efficiency for T2/T3 differentiation. Cohen's kappa was calculated to measure inter-rater agreement.  Results:   Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with organ defined cancer (T2), 18 patients were staged with extracapsular extension (T3), and thereof 7 patients were staged with seminal vesicle invasion (T3b) by the pathologists. The experienced reader reached a sensitivity of 77.78% (95%-CI 52.36%; 93.59%) and specificity of 92.86% (95%-CI 76.50%; 99.12%) for T2/T3 differentiation, the less experienced reader however achieved a sensitivity of 33.33% (95%-CI 13.34%; 59.01%) and specificity of 71.43% (95%-CI 51.33%; 86.78%). The Cohen's kappa for inter-rater reliability for differentiation between T2 and T3 stage was κ=0.0129.

However, none of these trials included patients with lymph node invasion (LNI).  Objective:   The aim of this study was to assess the impact of combination adjuvant hormonal therapy (HT) and RT on the survival of patients with prostate cancer and histologically documented lymph node metastases (pN+).  Design, setting, and participants:   Data on 703 consecutive patients with LNI treated with radical prostatectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, and adjuvant treatments between September 1986 and November 2002 at two large academic institutions were reviewed.  Measurements:   For study purposes, patients treated with adjuvant HT plus RT and patients treated with adjuvant HT alone were matched for age at surgery, pathologic T stage and Gleason score, number of nodes removed, surgical margin status, and length of follow-up. Differences in cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and life table analyses.  Results and limitations:   Following the matching process, 117 pT2-4 pN1 patients of 171 (68.4%) treated with adjuvant HT plus RT (group 1) were compared with 247 pT2-4 pN1 patients of 532 (46.4%) receiving adjuvant HT alone (group 2). After matching, the two groups of patients were comparable in terms of pre- and postoperative characteristics (all p ≥ 0.07). Mean follow-up was 100.8 mo (median: 95.1 mo; range: 3.5-229.3 mo). Overall, prostate CSS and OS rates at 5, 8, and 10 yr were 90%, 82%, and 75%, and 85%, 70%, and 60%, respectively. Patients treated with adjuvant RT plus HT had significantly higher CSS and OS rates compared with patients treated with HT alone at 5, 8, and 10 yr after surgery (95%, 91%, and 86% vs 88%, 78%, and 70%, and 90%, 84%, and 74% vs 82%, 65%, and 55%, respectively; p = 0.004 and p<0.001, respectively). Similarly, higher survival rates associated with the combination of HT plus RT were found when patients were stratified according to the extent of nodal invasion (namely, two or fewer vs more than two positive nodes; all p ≤ 0.006). Lack of standardised HT and RT protocols represents the main limitations of our retrospective study.  Conclusions:   Adjuvant RT plus HT significantly improved CSS and OS of pT2-4 pN1 patients, regardless of the extent of nodal invasion. These results reinforce the need for a multimodal approach in the treatment of node-positive prostate cancer.""","""['Alberto Briganti', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Luigi Filippo Da Pozzo', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Umberto Capitanio', 'Andrea Gallina', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Marco Bianchi', 'Manuela Tutolo', 'Andrea Salonia', 'Nadia Di Muzio', 'Patrizio Rigatti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Michael Blute']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Words of wisdom.

However, it is associated with significant side effects. In this study, we compared the different characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients who were treated for radiation enterocolitis, the treatment results, posttreatment quality of life (QOL), nutrition status, and predisposing factors for surgery.  Methods:   From 1985 to 2009, the records of a total of 89 patients with chronic radiation enterocolitis in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, operative data and long-term treatment results. Posttreatment QOL and nutrition status were also recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent predicting factors associated with surgical intervention. Characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients were compared.  Results:   Radiotherapy before 1995, concomitant radiation uropathy and smoking were independent predictive factors for surgery. Surgical and nonsurgical cases had similar Kaplan-Meier curves. Although the recurrence rate of radiation enterocolitis was much higher for the surgical group (p = 0.031), both groups had similar QOL score (median: 8 vs.7; p = 0.709), serum albumin level (3.29 g/dL vs. 3.16 g/dL; p = 0.095), and body mass index (20.19 vs. 19.86; p = 0.603).  Conclusions:   We confirmed that as compared with recently developed innovative techniques, early primitive radiotherapy techniques were associated with more severe radiotherapy complications that required surgery. Smoking may enhance patients' vulnerability to severe radiation injury. Surgery for radiation-induced intestinal obstruction, intestinal fistula and perforation is warranted because QOL, serum albumin level and body mass index were similar between the surgical and nonsurgical groups.""","""['Ming-Cheng Chen', 'Feng-Fan Chiang', 'Ta-Wen Hsu', 'Joe-Bin Chen', 'Te-Hsin Chao', 'Hsiu-Feng Ma', 'Hwei-Ming Wang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Chin Med Assoc""","""['Recurrence of radiation enterocolitis within 1 year is predictive of 5-year mortality in surgical cases of radiation enterocolitis: our 18-year experience in a single center.', 'Radiation enterocolitis requiring surgery in patients with gynecological malignancies.', 'Treatment of 21 cases of chronic radiation intestinal injury by staging ileostomy and closure operation.', 'Rectal perforation : A\xa0rare complication following radiotherapy.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Multi-slice spiral CT evaluation of chronic radiation colitis and rectitis.']"""

Methods:   In this phase 3 study, men with castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous exposure to intravenous bisphosphonate were enrolled from 342 centres in 39 countries. An interactive voice response system was used to assign patients (1:1 ratio), according to a computer-generated randomisation sequence, to receive 120 mg subcutaneous denosumab plus intravenous placebo, or 4 mg intravenous zoledronic acid plus subcutaneous placebo, every 4 weeks until the primary analysis cutoff date. Randomisation was stratified by previous skeletal-related event, prostate-specific antigen concentration, and chemotherapy for prostate cancer within 6 weeks before randomisation. Supplemental calcium and vitamin D were strongly recommended. Patients, study staff, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was time to first on-study skeletal-related event (pathological fracture, radiation therapy, surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression), and was assessed for non-inferiority. The same outcome was further assessed for superiority as a secondary endpoint. Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00321620, and has been completed.  Findings:   1904 patients were randomised, of whom 950 assigned to denosumab and 951 assigned to receive zoledronic acid were eligible for the efficacy analysis. Median duration on study at primary analysis cutoff date was 12·2 months (IQR 5·9-18·5) for patients on denosumab and 11·2 months (IQR 5·6-17·4) for those on zoledronic acid. Median time to first on-study skeletal-related event was 20·7 months (95% CI 18·8-24·9) with denosumab compared with 17·1 months (15·0-19·4) with zoledronic acid (hazard ratio 0·82, 95% CI 0·71-0·95; p = 0·0002 for non-inferiority; p = 0·008 for superiority). Adverse events were recorded in 916 patients (97%) on denosumab and 918 patients (97%) on zoledronic acid, and serious adverse events were recorded in 594 patients (63%) on denosumab and 568 patients (60%) on zoledronic acid. More events of hypocalcaemia occurred in the denosumab group (121 [13%]) than in the zoledronic acid group (55 [6%]; p<0·0001). Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred infrequently (22 [2%] vs 12 [1%]; p = 0·09).

Materials and methods:   Patients treated with palliative radiotherapy for symptomatic spinal metastases from May 2003 to June 2005 were analysed. All patients completed the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) assessment tool at 1, 2 and 3 months after radiotherapy. The pain response was determined using the International Bone Metastases Consensus response definitions. Given seven BPI functional interference items, a Bonferroni adjusted P value of less than 0.007 was considered significant.  Results:   One hundred and nine treated patients were assessed. About 50% of patients were treated with a single fraction of 8Gy. All pain scores and functional interference scores significantly decreased over time after radiotherapy. At 3 months, 64% of patients achieved a response. Mood was significantly improved for responders (P=0.003) and a trend in improvement was observed for general activity (P=0.01) and normal work (P=0.04). Breast and prostate primaries were more likely to achieve an early response as compared with a lung primary.

Materials and methods:   Between 1999 and April 2010, 196 prostate cancer patients were referred for postoperative salvage radiotherapy. Patient position was corrected using EPID (1999 to December 2006, n=116) or CBCT (January 2007 to present, n=80). The treatment technique, number of beams, dose prescription, dose computation algorithm and planning target volume margins were not altered over time. Grade 1-3 acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity were compared between the EPID group and the CBCT group.  Results:   The incidence of grade 1 and 2 genitourinary toxicity was significantly reduced by 17 and 14%, respectively, in the CBCT group compared with the EPID group (P<0.05). This was mainly attributed to a decrease in the following grade 1 symptoms: frequency (P<0.05), nocturia (P=0.06) and urgency (P=0.07). Grade 2 incontinence (P=0.06) and frequency (P=0.06) were lower in the CBCT group. Grade 3 genitourinary toxicity was comparably low (EPID 3% versus CBCT 1%). There was no significant difference in gastrointestinal grade 1-2 toxicity between both groups. No grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity was observed.

A new generic 50-mg tablet formulation of bicalutamide has recently been developed.  Objective:   This study evaluated the relative bioavailability and tolerability of the new generic formulation of bicalutamide 50-mg tablets (test) and the currently marketed formulation (reference) in healthy Korean male subjects. The study was conducted to meet Korean regulatory requirements for authorization to market the generic formulation.  Methods:   This was a randomized-sequence, open-label study in which healthy Korean male subjects (aged 20-55 years) received single doses of the test and reference formulations in a 2-period crossover fashion, with a 6-week washout period between doses. Blood samples for the determination of plasma bicalutamide concentrations were obtained at regular intervals over 672 hours after dose administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental methods. Relative bioavailability was evaluated by comparing the log-transformed C(max) and AUC(0-672) of the 2 formulations; Korean regulatory requirements for the assumption of bioequivalence were met if the 90% CIs fell within the range of 0.80 to 1.25. Tolerability was assessed based on physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and adverse events (AEs) (spontaneously reported or observed by investigators).  Results:   Of 47 volunteers screened for inclusion, 38 were enrolled and 32 completed the study (mean [SD] age, 24.9 [3.7] years; mean height, 173.8 [6.2] cm; mean weight, 66.1 [7.1] kg). Median T(max) was 24 hours for both formulations. The C(max) of the test and reference formulations was 1176.2 (191.6) and 1118.9 (209.5) μg/L, respectively. The corresponding values for AUC(0-672) were 277,503 (66,865) and 271,961 (75,597) μg · h/L. The 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios of log-transformed C(max) and AUC(0-672) were 1.00 to 1.11 and 0.99 to 1.07, respectively. Thirty-three AEs were reported, including 17 events in 9 subjects who received the test formulation and 16 events in 12 subjects who received the reference formulation. All AEs were mild, and no subjects discontinued the study because of AEs.  Conclusions:   In this single-dose study in healthy Korean male subjects, the pharmacokinetic parameters of the new generic formulation of bicalutamide 50-mg tablets did not differ significantly from those of the reference formulation. The new generic formulation met Korean regulatory criteria for the assumption of bioequivalence to the currently marketed formulation. Both formulations were well tolerated.

Considering the role of fibroblasts in cancer progression, we hypothesized that prostate cancer cells recruit these cells to their vicinity, where they are most directly available to influence cancer cell behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we performed modified Boyden chamber assays assessing the migration and collagen I invasion of normal primary prostate fibroblasts (PrSCs) and prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts (PCAFs) in response to media conditioned by the metastatic prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, LNCaP and DU145. During 4-hr incubations, PrSCs and PCAFs migrated and invaded in response to the conditioned media. To identify candidate proteins in the conditioned media that produced these effects, we performed cytokine antibody arrays and detected angiogenin in all three media. Angiogenin-blocked PC-3-conditioned medium, obtained using an anti-angiogenin polyclonal antibody or angiogenin siRNA, significantly reduced PC-3-induced PrSC and PCAF collagen I invasion. Furthermore, angiogenin alone at 1, 2 and 5 ng/ml significantly stimulated PCAF collagen I invasion. These results suggest that PC-3-derived angiogenin stimulates the invasion of normal prostate fibroblasts and PCAFs and is sufficient for invasion of the latter. Because prostate fibroblasts play key roles in prostate cancer progression, targeting their invasion using an anti-angiogenin-based therapy may be a strategy for preventing or treating advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Michelle L Jones', 'Charles M Ewing', 'William B Isaacsa', 'Robert H Getzenberg']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Tumour-stroma interactions between metastatic prostate cancer cells and fibroblasts.', 'Prostate stromal cell-derived hepatocyte growth factor induces invasion of prostate cancer cell line DU145 through tumor-stromal interaction.', 'Role of hepatocyte growth factor in invasion of prostate cancer cell lines through tumor-stromal interaction.', 'Inhibition of prostate carcinoma establishment and metastatic growth in mice by an antiangiogenin monoclonal antibody.', 'Acetyl-L-Carnitine downregulates invasion (CXCR4/CXCL12, MMP-9) and angiogenesis (VEGF, CXCL8) pathways in prostate cancer cells: rationale for prevention and interception strategies.', 'Prostate-specific antigen reduction after capecitabine plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy: A case report.', 'Tear Fluid Angiogenic Factors: Potential Noninvasive Biomarkers for Retinopathy of Prematurity Screening in Preterm Infants.', 'ANG Promotes Proliferation and Invasion of the Cell of Lung Squamous Carcinoma by Directly Up-Regulating HMGA2.', 'Three decades of research on angiogenin: a review and perspective.', 'Angiogenin interacts with the plasminogen activation system at the cell surface of breast cancer cells to regulate plasmin formation and cell migration.']"""

This is due, in part, to the acquisition of antiapoptotic properties by the cancer cells and, therefore, development of novel strategies for treatment is of critical need. Here, we attempt to clarify the role of the antiapoptotic molecule galectin-3 in prostate cancer cells using siRNA and antagonist approaches. The data showed that Gal-3 inhibition by siRNA or its antagonist GCS-100/modified citrus pectin (MCP) increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis of PC3 cells. Recent studies have indicated that cisplatin-induced apoptosis may be mediated by calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, as its activation leads to cleavage of androgen receptor into an androgen-independent isoform in prostate cancer cells. Thus, we examined whether calpain activation is associated with the Gal-3 function of regulating apoptosis. Here, we report that Gal-3 inhibition by siRNA or GCS-100/MCP enhances calpain activation, whereas Gal-3 overexpression inhibits it. Inhibition of calpain using its inhibitor and/or siRNA attenuated the proapoptotic effect of Gal-3 inhibition, suggesting that calpain activation may be a novel mechanism for the proapoptotic effect of Gal-3 inhibition. Thus, a paradigm shift for treating prostate cancer is suggested whereby a combination of a non-toxic anti-Gal-3 drug together with a toxic chemotherapeutic agent could serve as a novel therapeutic modality for chemoresistant prostate cancers.""","""['Y Wang', 'P Nangia-Makker', 'V Balan', 'V Hogan', 'A Raz']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Galectin-3 regulates mitochondrial stability and antiapoptotic function in response to anticancer drug in prostate cancer.', 'Galectin-3 regulates chemotherapy sensitivity in epithelial ovarian carcinoma via regulating mitochondrial function.', 'Galectin 3 inhibition attenuates renal injury progression in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.', 'P73 regulates cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells via a calcium/calpain-dependent mechanism.', 'Evidence for calpain-mediated androgen receptor cleavage as a mechanism for androgen independence.', 'Estrogen receptors regulate galectin‑3 in androgen‑independent DU‑145 prostate cancer cells.', 'The pleiotropic role of galectin-3 in melanoma progression: Unraveling the enigma.', 'Pectin: A Bioactive Food Polysaccharide with Cancer Preventive Potential.', 'Unraveling How Tumor-Derived Galectins Contribute to Anti-Cancer Immunity Failure.', 'Galectins in Cancer and the Microenvironment: Functional Roles, Therapeutic Developments, and Perspectives.']"""

The ability of SFN to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes may be one mechanism by which it acts as a chemoprevention agent. The ability of a chemopreventive agent to specifically cause cytotoxicity in cancer and not normal cells is an important factor in determining its safety and clinical relevance.  Methods and results:   We characterized the effects of SFN in normal (PrEC), benign hyperplasia (BPH1) and cancerous (LnCap and PC3) prostate epithelial cells. We observed that 15 μM SFN selectively induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in BPH1, LnCap and PC3 cells but not PrEC cells. SFN treatment also selectively decreased HDAC activity, and Class I and II HDAC proteins, increased acetylated histone H3 at the promoter for P21, induced p21 expression and increased tubulin acetylation in prostate cancer cells. HDAC6 over-expression was able to reverse SFN-induced cyotoxicity. In PrEC cells, SFN caused only a transient reduction in HDAC activity with no change in any other endpoints tested. The differences in sensitivity to SFN in PrEC and PC3 are likely not due to differences in SFN metabolism or differences in phase 2 enzyme induction.  Conclusion:   SFN exerts differential effects on cell proliferation, HDAC activity and downstream targets in normal and cancer cells.""","""['John D Clarke', 'Anna Hsu', 'Zhen Yu', 'Roderick H Dashwood', 'Emily Ho']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Nutr Food Res""","""['Sulforaphane inhibits histone deacetylase activity in BPH-1, LnCaP and PC-3 prostate epithelial cells.', 'A novel mechanism of chemoprotection by sulforaphane: inhibition of histone deacetylase.', 'Histone deacetylase turnover and recovery in sulforaphane-treated colon cancer cells: competing actions of 14-3-3 and Pin1 in HDAC3/SMRT corepressor complex dissociation/reassembly.', 'Multi-targeted prevention of cancer by sulforaphane.', 'Modulation of histone deacetylase activity by dietary isothiocyanates and allyl sulfides: studies with sulforaphane and garlic organosulfur compounds.', 'Mechanistic review of sulforaphane as a chemoprotective agent in bladder cancer.', 'Epigenetic Alterations in Canine Malignant Lymphoma: Future and Clinical Outcomes.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Sulforaphane inhibits angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by acetylation modification of Nrf2.', 'Epigenetic Therapeutics Targeting NRF2/KEAP1 Signaling in Cancer Oxidative Stress.']"""

At the same time, the concern of ""missing heritability"" has also emerged. There is however no unified way to assess the heritability explained by individual genetic variants for binary outcomes. A systemic and quantitative assessment of the degree of ""missing heritability"" for complex diseases is lacking. In this study, we measure the variance in liability explained by individual variants, which can be directly interpreted as the locus-specific heritability. The method is extended to deal with haplotypes, multi-allelic markers, multi-locus genotypes, and markers in linkage disequilibrium. Methods to estimate the standard error and confidence interval are proposed. To assess our current level of understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases, we conducted a survey of 10 diseases, evaluating the total variance explained by the known variants. The diseases under evaluation included Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, breast cancer, coronary artery disease, Crohn's disease, prostate cancer, schizophrenia, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. The median total variance explained across the 10 diseases was 9.81%, while the median variance explained per associated SNP was around 0.25%. Our results suggest that a substantial proportion of heritability remains unexplained for the diseases under study.

Because these cells do not express androgen receptors and are castration-resistant, further understanding the mechanism of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of prostate cancer cells may yield novel intervention methods in hormone refractory prostate cancer. In this regard, the present study investigated the effect of macrophages on prostate cancer NED.  Methods:   THP-1 and LNCaP or RAW264.7 and TRAMP-C2 cell line co-cultures were used to investigate NED-macrophage interactions. Also interleukin-6 (IL-6) knockout mice and macrophage-depleted mice were used to test NED in vivo.  Results:   We found that co-culturing with THP-1 human monocytic cell line and RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line led to the NED of LNCaP and TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells, respectively. Specifically, the conditioned media of activated macrophages stimulated the expression of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), a marker of NED, in both LNCaP and TRAMP-C2 cells. Mechanistically, bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) derived from prostate cancer cells increased the expression of IL-6 in macrophages. Subsequently, IL-6 induced the NED of prostate cancer cells. When this feedback loop was disrupted with neutralizing antibodies to either BMP-6 or IL-6, NED was no longer observed. In human prostate cancer tissues, neuroendocrine cells frequently co-localized with macrophages and BMP-6. In mice, the removal of IL-6 or macrophages blocked the BMP-6-induced NED of prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Therefore, we propose that BMP-6 secreted by prostate cancer cells induces IL-6 expression in macrophages; IL-6, in turn, stimulates the NED of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Geun Taek Lee', 'Seok Joo Kwon', 'Jae-Ho Lee', 'Seong Soo Jeon', 'Kee Taek Jang', 'Han Yong Choi', 'Hyun Moo Lee', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Dong Hyeon Lee', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Bone morphogenetic protein-6 induces castration resistance in prostate cancer cells through tumor infiltrating macrophages.', 'Mechanism of pro-tumorigenic effect of BMP-6: neovascularization involving tumor-associated macrophages and IL-1a.', 'Elevated circulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) levels are associated with neuroendocrine differentiation in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in castration resistant prostate cancer.

In this study, we investigated the effect of high fat diet on mouse prostate gene expression.  Methods:   C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control or high fat diet for 12 weeks. Microarray analyses were performed on mouse ventral prostate (VP) and dorsolateral prostate (DLP), followed by canonical pathway analysis and regulatory network identification. mRNA changes were confirmed by real time PCR.  Results:   Approximately 2,125, and 1,194 genes responded significantly to the high fat diet in VP, DLP, respectively. Pathways and networks related to oxidative stress, glutathione metabolism, NRF-mediated oxidative stress response and NF-kappaB were all differentially regulated by high fat diet. Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) mRNA levels were decreased by approximately twofold by high fat diet in all three prostate lobes. In human non-transformed prostate cells (PrSC, PrEC, and BPH-1), cholesterol loading decreased GPx3 expression, and increased H2 O2 levels of culture medium. Troglitazone increased GPx3 expression in three normal prostate cells, and decreased H2 O2 levels. In addition, troglitazone attenuated cholesterol-induced H2 O2 increase. Tissue from prostate cancer biopsies had decreased GPx3 mRNA and its level was inversely related to the Gleason score.  Conclusions:   High fat diet alters pathways related to many genes concerned with oxidative stress. GPx3, a gene identified by this analysis, was found to be down-regulated by high fat diet and appears be decreased in human prostate cancers, suggesting that GPx3 may have a possible role in modulating carcinogenesis.

The HSPA2 is encoded by the gene originally defined as testis-specific, while HSPA1 is encoded by the stress-inducible genes (HSPA1A and HSPA1B). Our study revealed that both proteins are expressed only in some tissues from the 24 ones examined. HSPA2 was detected in adrenal gland, bronchus, cerebellum, cerebrum, colon, esophagus, kidney, skin, small intestine, stomach and testis, but not in adipose tissue, bladder, breast, cardiac muscle, diaphragm, liver, lung, lymph node, pancreas, prostate, skeletal muscle, spleen, thyroid. Expression of HSPA1 was detected in adrenal gland, bladder, breast, bronchus, cardiac muscle, esophagus, kidney, prostate, skin, but not in other tissues examined. Moreover, HSPA2 and HSPA1 proteins were found to be expressed in a cell-type-specific manner. The most pronounced cell-type expression pattern was found for HSPA2 protein. In the case of stratified squamous epithelia of the skin and esophagus, as well as in ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium lining respiratory tract, the HSPA2 positive cells were located in the basal layer. In the colon, small intestine and bronchus epithelia HSPA2 was detected in goblet cells. In adrenal gland cortex HSPA2 expression was limited to cells of zona reticularis. The presented results clearly show that certain human tissues constitutively express varying levels of HSPA1 and HSPA2 proteins in a highly differentiated way.

Many autistic subjects display a dysregulation of the immune system which is compatible with an unresolved viral infection with prenatal onset, potentially due to vertical viral transmission.

Methods:   Human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC3 were used. The expression of AR, AR translocation into the nucleus, and expression levels of AR coactivators ARA70 and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) in LNCaP cells were examined using real-time PCR and Western blot. Changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein levels, PSA promoter activity, and androgen response element (ARE)-mediated reporter gene activity were examined using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) and transient transfection assays. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to analyze the interaction between AR and the AR coactivators in ST1- and ST2-treated cells.  Results:   In LNCaP cells, ST1 and ST2 (40 μmol/L) led to a significant decrease in the expression of AR as well as a reduction of AR translocation into the nucleus, but had no effect on AR protein translation. ST1 and ST2 treatment also resulted in a significant decrease in the level of PSA protein secreted into the medium and was able to suppress PSA promoter-dependent and ARE-dependent luciferase activity. Furthermore, decreased expression of ARA70 and SRC-1 was observed when LNCaP cells were exposed to ST1 and ST2, which interfered with their ability to interact with AR.  Conclusion:   The observations suggest that suppression of AR transactivation by ST1 and ST2 may be mediated, in part, by inhibiting AR nuclear translocation and/or interfering with the interaction between AR and its coactivators ARA70 and SRC-1.

Objective:   The objectives of this study were to describe cortisol levels, perceived stress, symptoms, and symptom distress; compare differences in variables measured between RP and RT; and identify associations among cortisol levels, perceived stress, symptoms, and symptom distress in patients treated for localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with 53 patients (RP n = 24, RT n = 29). Data from saliva, questionnaires, and interviews were collected within 3 months of treatment. Saliva samples were collected at 4 times over 2 consecutive days. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlations, and regressions.  Results:   A robust diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion with heightened levels in the early morning and lowered levels late in the day was found. On average, the entire sample had moderate symptoms and symptom distress for urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. The RP group reported significantly more urinary and sexual dysfunction symptoms and fewer bowel symptoms than did the RT group. Perceived stress was positively correlated with higher afternoon cortisol levels and greater symptom distress.  Conclusion:   Moderate symptoms and symptom distress found in our sample indicate the need for interventions to address these outcomes in men treated for prostate cancer. Self-reported perceived stress can be used to assess the stress level and symptom distress in clinic setting.  Implications for practice:   Patients treated for prostate cancer with RP or RT should be assessed for symptoms and symptom distress and targeted for early symptom management interventions.""","""['Chao-Pin Hsiao', 'Ida M Moore', 'Kathleen C Insel', 'Carrie J Merkle']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""['Psychological distress in Japanese men with localized prostate cancer.', 'The self-perceived symptom distress and health-related conditions associated with morning to evening diurnal cortisol patterns in outpatients with major depressive disorder.', 'Disease-specific quality of life among patients with localized prostate cancer: an Australian perspective.', 'Symptoms and symptom distress in localized prostate cancer.', 'Psychological impact of different primary treatments for prostate cancer: A critical analysis.', 'Patient-reported distress and age-related stress biomarkers among colorectal cancer patients.', 'Quality of life and adjustment in men with prostate cancer: Interplay of stress, threat and resilience.', 'Rigor and Reproducibility: A Systematic Review of Salivary Cortisol Sampling and Reporting Parameters Used in Cancer Survivorship Research.', 'Sexual well-being and diurnal cortisol after prostate cancer treatment.', 'Perceived stress and its associated demographic-clinical characteristics and positive expectations among Chinese cervical, kidney, and bladder cancer patients.']"""

Because the single-agent activity of Smac mimetics is very limited, rational combinations represent a viable strategy for their clinical development. The combination of Smac mimetics with TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) may be particularly attractive because of the low toxicity of TRAIL to normal cells and the synergistic antitumor activity observed for the combination. In this study, we have investigated the combination synergy between TRAIL and a potent Smac mimetic, SM-164, in vitro and in vivo and the underlying molecular mechanism of action for the synergy. Our study shows that SM-164 is highly synergistic with TRAIL in vitro in both TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant cancer cell lines of breast, prostate, and colon cancer. Furthermore, the combination of SM-164 with TRAIL induces rapid tumor regression in vivo in a breast cancer xenograft model in which either agent is ineffective. Our data show that X-linked IAP (XIAP) and cellular IAP 1 (cIAP1), but not cIAP2, work in concert to attenuate the activity of TRAIL; SM-164 strongly enhances TRAIL activity by concurrently targeting XIAP and cIAP1. Moreover, although RIP1 plays a minimal role in the activity of TRAIL as a single agent, it is required for the synergistic interaction between TRAIL and SM-164.

However, whether (-)-gossypol plays functional roles in tumor angiogenesis has not been directly elucidated yet. In this study, we showed that (-)-gossypol dose dependently inhibited the expression of VEGF, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL in human prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and DU 145) and primary cultured human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Notably, the growth of human prostate tumor PC-3 xenografts in mice was significantly suppressed by (-)-gossypol at a dosage of 15 mg/kg/d. This inhibitory action of (-)-gossypol in vivo was largely dependent on suppression of angiogenesis in the solid tumors, where VEGF expression and microvessel density were remarkably decreased. Furthermore, (-)-gossypol inhibited VEGF-induced chemotactic motility and tubulogenesis in HUVECs and human microvascular endothelial cells and suppressed microvessel sprouting from rat aortic rings ex vivo. When examined for the mechanism, we found that (-)-gossypol blocked the activation of VEGF receptor 2 kinase with the half maximal inhibitory concentration of 2.38 μmol/L in endothelial cells. Consequently, the phosphorylation of key intracellular proangiogenic kinases induced by VEGF was all suppressed by the treatment, such as Src family kinase, focal adhesion kinase, extracellular signal-related kinase, and AKT kinase.

Our EB analysis identified several noteworthy interacting SNP pairs, although none reached genome-wide significance.

Another noteworthy result involves interaction of a known prostate cancer susceptibility marker near the prostate protease genes KLK2 and KLK3 with an intronic SNP in PRXX2.

This study examined whether sertraline altered basal [Ca(2+) ](i) levels in suspended PC3 human prostate cancer cells by using fura-2 as a Ca(2+) -sensitive fluorescent probe. At concentrations of 10-150 μM, sertraline induced a [Ca(2+) ](i) rise in a concentration-dependent fashion. The Ca(2+) signal was reduced partly by removing extracellular Ca(2+) indicating that Ca(2+) entry and release both contributed to the [Ca(2+) ](i) rise. Sertraline induced Mn(2+) influx, leading to quench of fura-2 fluorescence suggesting Ca(2+) influx. This Ca(2+) influx was inhibited by the suppression of store-operated Ca(2+) channels or by the modulation of protein kinase C activity. In Ca(2+) -free medium, pre-treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor thapsigargin or 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone nearly abolished sertraline-induced Ca(2+) release. Conversely, pre-treatment with sertraline greatly reduced the inhibitor-induced [Ca(2+) ](i) rise, suggesting that sertraline released Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum. Inhibition of phospholipase C inhibited sertraline-induced [Ca(2+) ](i) rise. At 20-30 μM, sertraline killed cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of sertraline was enhanced by chelating cytosolic Ca(2+) with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid/AM. Annexin V-FITC data suggest that sertraline (20 and 30 μM) evoked apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Together, in PC3 human prostate cancer cells, sertraline induced [Ca(2+) ](i) rises by causing phospholipase C-dependent Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and via multiple Ca(2+) influx pathways that involve store-operated Ca(2+) channels.

Patients and methods:   • Prostate tissue from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy was stimulated in vitro with the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (10 µM). • α2-adrenoceptor phosphorylation at serines 345/346 was studied using Western blot analysis with a phospho-specific antibody. • The role of second messenger kinases was assessed by studying the effects of the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro 31-8425 and the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 on phenylephrine-induced phosphorylation. • The expression of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) 2/3 was analysed using quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   • Stimulation of prostate tissue with phenylephrine resulted in phosphorylation of the β2-adrenoceptor (5, 10 and 20 min after stimulation). • This α1-adrenoceptor-induced phosphorylation of β2-adrenoceptors was resistant to inhibition of PKC and PKA. • Changes in phosphorylation levels were not attributable to changes in receptor levels, as these remained constant during stimulation. • RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed expression of GRK2/3 in human prostate tissues. • Immunohistochemical staining showed that GRK2/3 expression in human prostate tissue is located to stromal and smooth muscle cells.  Conclusions:   • Activation of α1-adrenoceptors causes phosphorylation of β2-adrenoceptors in the human prostate.

Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer among western men and prevention strategies are needed. Trials evaluating 5α-reductase inhibitors have reported beneficial and clinically meaningful results, but uptake remains low for primary prostate cancer prevention. Prostate cancer detection programmes are also important as curative treatments for advanced disease are unavailable. Two large landmark randomized controlled trials reported conflicting results concerning screening efficacy and uncovered high levels of over-diagnosis and potential over-treatment. Tailored management strategies after diagnosis are important and predictive markers that distinguish between aggressive and indolent tumours are needed. The majority of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer are clinically localized. Active surveillance of favourable risk patients may be beneficial in the intermediate term, while an integrated approach of multi-modality therapy in patients with adverse features is recommended. The benefits of new technologies such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and robotic prostatectomy have not been established in prospective randomized trials vs current standards of care. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to evolving the management of advanced prostate cancer into a chronic disease paradigm. Docetaxel plus prednisone is the standard first-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but the optimal timing of chemotherapy initiation has not been addressed in randomized clinical trials. Retrospective analyses suggest that asymptomatic patients with adverse prognostic factors for survival may also benefit from receiving chemotherapy. Bladder cancer is a common malignancy and the most expensive cancer per patient. Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a heterogenous disease that requires dynamic multidisciplinary management. Aggressive early intervention may be beneficial in some cases. Platinum-based therapies represent the first-line standard of care for advanced bladder cancer, but the maximum benefit may have been reached for conventional chemotherapies and new strategies are needed.

The structural similarity of finasteride to DHT raises the possibility that finasteride may also interfere with the function of the androgen receptor (AR). Experiments were carried out to evaluate the antiandrogenic effect of finasteride in LNCaP, C4-2 and VCaP human prostate cancer cells. Finasteride decreased DHT binding to AR, and DHT-stimulated AR activity and cell growth in LNCaP and C4-2 cells, but not in VCaP cells. LNCaP and C4-2 (derived from castration-resistant LNCaP) cells express the T877A mutant AR, while VCaP cells express the wild type AR. When PC-3 cells, which are AR-null, were transfected with either the wild type or the T877A mutant AR, only the mutant AR-expressing cells were sensitive to finasteride inhibition of DHT binding. Peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx1) is a novel endogenous facilitator of AR binding to DHT. In Prx1-rich LNCaP cells, the combination of Prx1 knockdown and finasteride was found to produce a greater inhibitory effect on AR activity and cell growth than either treatment alone. The observation suggests that cells with a low expression of Prx1 are likely to be more responsive to the antiandrogenic effect of finasteride. Additional studies showed that the efficacy of finasteride was comparable to that of bicalutamide (a widely used non-steroidal antiandrogen).

The DSB can be mediated by the class II topoisomerase TOP2B, which is recruited with the androgen receptor and estrogen receptor to regulatory sites on target genes and is apparently required for efficient transcriptional activation of these genes. These DSBs are recognized by the DNA repair machinery triggering the recruitment of repair proteins such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), ATM, and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). If illegitimately repaired, such DSBs can seed the formation of genomic rearrangements like the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion oncogene in prostate cancer. Here, we hypothesize that these transcription-induced, TOP2B-mediated DSBs can also be exploited therapeutically and propose that, in hormone-dependent tumors like breast and prostate cancers, a hormone-cycling therapy, in combination with topoisomerase II poisons or inhibitors of the DNA repair components PARP1 and DNA-PK, could overwhelm cancer cells with transcription-associated DSBs.

In this study, we showed that PrLZ enhanced in vitro growth and colony formation of prostate cancer cells on androgen deprivation as well as tumorigenicity in castrated nude mice.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the prostate biopsy database of consecutive men undergoing prostate biopsies under local anesthesia by using the 10 (Group A) and 24 (Group B) protocols. Men were stratified according to biopsy protocol and PSA levels. Exclusion criteria were age ≥ 75 years and PSA > 20 ng/mL. The Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis.  Results:   Between April 2007 and August 2009, 869 men underwent TRUS prostate biopsies of which 379 were eligible for the study. Group A (10-cores) consisted of 243 (64.11%) men and group B (24-cores) included 139 (35.89%) men. The overall prostate cancer detection rate was 39.09% and 34.55% in Group A and B, respectively (p = 0.43). An overall 9.8% increase in Gleason 7 detection rate was found in Group B (p = 0.24). The high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) detection rate in men with negative initial biopsies was 15.54% and 35.55% in Group A and B, respectively (p < 0.001). In patients with PSA < 10 ng/mL, the 24-core technique increased Gleason 7 detection rate by 13.4% (p = 0.16) and HGPIN by 23.4% (p = 0.0008), compared to the 10 core technique. The 24-core technique increased the concordance between needle biopsy and prostatectomy specimen compared to 10-core technique (p < 0.002).  Conclusions:   The initial 24-core prostate biopsy protocol did not show any benefit in the detection of prostate cancer compared to the 10-core technique.

We propose a RTCDSS to process online clinical informatics from multiple databases for clinical decision making in the treatment of prostate cancer based on Web Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, by which the system can easily be adapted to different diseases and applications.  Methods:   We designed a framework upon the Web MVC-based architecture in which the reusable and extractable models can be conveniently adapted to other hospital information systems and which allows for efficient database integration. Then, we determined the clinical variables of the prostate cancer treatment based on participating clinicians' opinions and developed a computational model to determine the pretreatment parameters. Furthermore, the components of the RTCDSS integrated PCRs and decision factors for real-time analysis to provide evidence-based diagrams upon the clinician-oriented interface for visualization of treatment guidance and health risk assessment.  Results:   The resulting system can improve quality of clinical treatment by allowing clinicians to concurrently analyze and evaluate the clinical markers of prostate cancer patients with instantaneous clinical data and evidence-based diagrams which can automatically identify pretreatment parameters. Moreover, the proposed RTCDSS can aid interactions between patients and clinicians.  Conclusions:   Our proposed framework supports online clinical informatics, evaluates treatment risks, offers interactive guidance, and provides real-time reference for decision making in the treatment of prostate cancer. The developed clinician-oriented interface can assist clinicians in conveniently presenting evidence-based information to patients and can be readily adapted to an existing hospital information system and be easily applied in other chronic diseases.""","""['Hsueh-Chun Lin', 'Hsi-Chin Wu', 'Chih-Hung Chang', 'Tsai-Chung Li', 'Wen-Miin Liang', 'Jong-Yi Wang Wang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['A real time online assessment system with modelized architecture on clinical infometrics for patient reported outcomes of prostate cancer.', 'Internet and information technology use in treatment of diabetes.', 'A patient-oriented clinical decision support system for CRC risk assessment and preventative care.', 'Development and evaluation of the personal patient profile-prostate (P3P), a Web-based decision support system for men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer.', 'Treatment of nonmetastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review of interactive, personalized patient decision aids.', 'Protocol to acquire time series data on adverse reactions following vaccination using a smartphone or web-based platform.', 'A systematic literature review of AI-based digital decision support systems for post-traumatic stress disorder.', 'PCaGuard: A Software Platform to Support Optimal Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer trajectory-map: clinical decision support system for prognosis management of radical prostatectomy.', 'Integration of mathematical model predictions into routine workflows to support clinical decision making in haematology.']"""

Methods:   A 68 year-old patient with severe vasculogenic ED refractory to pharmacologic management following RALP underwent a 3-piece penile prosthesis insertion surgery and laparoscopic right lower abdominal hernia repair. Laparoscopy revealed an intraperitoneal reservoir that was overlying the sigmoid colon with multiple diverticula. The reservoir was laparoscopically repositioned in the dependent pelvis away from the diverticula and the pelvic vessels.  Results:   The patient's postoperative course was uneventful without any postoperative complications (2 year follow up).

Immunization with dying prostate cancer cells results in profoundly increased control of subsequently inoculated tumors in SRA/CD204 knockout mice. Using OVA-expressing RM1 prostate tumor line (RM1-OVA), we show for the first time that SRA absence greatly enhances dendritic cells (DCs)-mediated cross-presentation of OVA antigen derived from dying RM1 cells. While the phagocytic ability of DCs is not significantly impacted by the lack of SRA/CD204, DCs deficient in SRA/CD204 display increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as co-stimulatory molecules upon interaction with dying RM1 cells, implicating a suppressive regulation of the functional activation of DCs by SRA/CD204. Further, SRA/CD204-deficient DCs pulsed with dying RM1-OVA cells are more effective than wild-type counterparts in priming antigen-specific T-cell responses, resulting in improved control of RM1 tumor growth in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Our findings suggest that the increased immunogenicity of dying tumor cells in SRA/CD204 knockout mice is attributed to the altered functions of DCs in the absence of SRA/CD204, which underscores the important role of SRA/CD204 in host immune homeostasis. Selective downregulation or blockade of this immunoregulatory molecule may lead to enhanced potency of DC-based vaccines capable of breaking immune tolerance against cancer.""","""['Chunqing Guo', 'Huanfa Yi', 'Xiaofei Yu', 'Fanlei Hu', 'Daming Zuo', 'John R Subjeck', 'Xiang-Yang Wang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Immunol Cell Biol""","""['Suppression of antigen-specific CD4+ T cell activation by SRA/CD204 through reducing the immunostimulatory capability of antigen-presenting cell.', 'Targeting the immunoregulator SRA/CD204 potentiates specific dendritic cell vaccine-induced T-cell response and antitumor immunity.', 'CD204 suppresses large heat shock protein-facilitated priming of tumor antigen gp100-specific T cells and chaperone vaccine activity against mouse melanoma.', 'Antitumor immune responses mediated by dendritic cells: How signals derived from dying cancer cells drive antigen cross-presentation.', 'Carbon nanotubes as vaccine scaffolds.', 'SRA inhibition improves antitumor potency of antigen-targeted chaperone vaccine.', 'Electrical Stimulation for Immune Modulation in Cancer Treatments.', 'Engineering T Cells to Express Tumoricidal MDA-7/IL24 Enhances Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Complex Factors and Challenges that Affect the Pharmacology, Safety and Efficacy of Nanocarrier Drug Delivery Systems.', 'Immunologically programming the tumor microenvironment induces the pattern recognition receptor NLRC4-dependent antitumor immunity.']"""

Following transrectal biopsy, all enrolled patients had undergone MRI for staging work-up. After RALP, only 43.8% (53/121) of the patients were matched with the MRI predicted stage.

Many studies have attempted to identify clinical, histologic, or molecular characteristics of ATYP that correlated with the risk of PCa in follow-up biopsies. TMPRSS2:ERG gene rearrangement is the most common chromosomal alteration and is highly specific for PCa. Recently, 2 studies reported that positive immunohistochemical (IHC) stains with an ERG antibody highly correlated with the TMPRSS2:ERG gene rearrangement status. We evaluated the use of this antibody as an IHC marker on prostate biopsies with an initial ATYP diagnosis to determine whether positive ERG IHC was associated with increased PCa detection in subsequent biopsies, which therefore might be useful for stratifying ATYP prostate biopsies. ERG IHC was performed on 103 biopsies with initial ATYP diagnosis. Positive ERG IHC staining was detected in 16 of the 103 cases (15.5%) of the ATYP prostate biopsies. Of these 16 ERG-positive cases, the atypical glands were positive for ERG in 9 cases. In the remaining 7 cases, positive ERG staining was found in glands other than ATYP glands, including high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and morphologically benign glands. ERG IHC was negative in other benign prostate lesions, including simple atrophy, partial atrophy, proliferative inflammatory atrophy, basal cell hyperplasia, postatrophic hyperplasia, and squamous metaplasia. In subsequent follow-up biopsies, PCa was detected in 7 of the 16 (43.8%) ERG-positive cases and in 42 of the 87 (48.3%) ERG-negative cases (P=0.952 by χ test). In biopsies with ERG-positive ATYP glands, cancer was found in 5 of 9 (55.6%) cases in subsequent biopsies. This is the first study to investigate the use of ERG IHC in difficult prostate biopsies. ERG IHC was positive in a small percentage (15.5%) of the ATYP prostate biopsies, and positive ERG staining did not correlate with the increased cancer detection in subsequent prostate biopsies. Therefore, ERG IHC is not useful for stratifying ATYP prostate biopsies to identify patients who have increased risk for PCa in repeat biopsies. Furthermore, positive ERG staining is not entirely specific for PCa and can occasionally be found in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and benign glands that are not associated with PCa in prostate biopsies.""","""['Huiying He', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Jianbo Li', 'Paula Carver', 'Sara Falzarano', 'Karen Smith', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Ming Zhou']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['The diagnostic use of ERG in resolving an ""atypical glands suspicious for cancer"" diagnosis in prostate biopsies beyond that provided by basal cell and α-methylacyl-CoA-racemase markers.', 'The utility of ERG/P63 double immunohistochemical staining in the diagnosis of limited cancer in prostate needle biopsies.', 'Expression of ERG protein, a prostate cancer specific marker, in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): lack of utility to stratify cancer risks associated with HGPIN.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Benign mimickers of the prostate cancer.

Moreover, little is known whether a certain percentage of the ductal component is needed to account for its more aggressive behavior. Of 18,552 radical prostatectomies performed from 1995 to 2008, 93 cases with a ductal adenocarcinoma component were identified. Cases were classified based on their ductal/acinar ratio (<10%; ≥10% and <50%; ≥50%). There was no difference in the distribution of Gleason score 3+4=7 versus 4+3=7 between ductal and nonductal tumors, such that cases were combined as Gleason score 7. There was no age, race, and serum prostate-specific antigen difference between patients with and without ductal adenocarcinoma. Cases with ductal adenocarcinoma were less likely to be organ confined (36.6% vs 65.6%) and more likely to show seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) (19.3% vs 5.3%), P<0.0001. There was no difference in lymph node metastases or positive margins between cases with and without ductal features. An increasing percentage of the ductal component correlated with an increased risk of extraprostatic extension (P=0.04) and SVI (P<0.0001). To account for overall different Gleason scores between ductal and nonductal cases, and the effect of differing percentages of ductal features as well, the following analysis was carried out. For Gleason score 7 cases and ≥10% ductal differentiation, cases with ductal features were more likely to have nonfocal extraprostatic extension (64.0%) versus cases without ductal features (34.7%), P=0.002. In this group, there was no statistically significant difference in SVI or lymph node involvement between Gleason score 7 ductal and nonductal tumors. For Gleason score 7 cases with <10% ductal features, there was no difference in pathologic stage versus nonductal cases. There was no difference in pathologic stage between ductal and nonductal cases for Gleason score 8 to 10 cases, regardless of the percentage of the ductal component. This study shows that ductal adenocarcinoma admixed with Gleason pattern 3 is more aggressive than Gleason score 7 acinar cancer, as long as the ductal component is ≥10%. In cases with a very minor ductal component, these differences are lost. In addition, Gleason score 8 to 10 tumors with ductal features are not significantly more aggressive that acinar Gleason score 8 to 10 cancers in which the pure high-grade tumor, regardless of ductal features, determines the behavior.""","""['Ali Amin', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma with cribriform architecture has worse prognostic features than non-cribriform-type.', 'Prostatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Controlled for Tumor Grade, Stage, and Margin Status Does Not Independently Influence the Likelihood of Biochemical Recurrence in Localized Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Incidence of Extraprostatic Extension at Radical Prostatectomy with Pure Gleason Score 3 + 3 = 6 (Grade Group 1) Cancer: Implications for Whether Gleason Score 6 Prostate Cancer Should be Renamed ""Not Cancer"" and for Selection Criteria for Active Surveillance.', 'Variants of acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate mimicking benign conditions.', 'Prostate cancer grading: a decade after the 2005 modified system.', 'Ductal prostate cancer: Clinical features and outcomes from a multicenter retrospective analysis and overview of the current literature.', 'Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: A systematic review and meta-analysis of incidence, presentation, prognosis, and management.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging findings of pure prostatic ductal adenocarcinomas: a case series.', 'Optimizing the diagnosis and management of ductal prostate cancer.', 'HoxB13 expression in ductal type adenocarcinoma of prostate: clinicopathologic characteristics and its utility as potential diagnostic marker.']"""

However, the molecular link between androgen receptor (AR) function and humoral factors remains elusive. A prostate cancer mouse model was generated by selectively mutating the AR threonine 877 into alanine in prostatic epithelial cells through Cre-ERT2-mediated targeted somatic mutagenesis. Such AR point mutant mice (ARpe-T877A/Y) developed hypertrophic prostates with responses to both an androgen antagonist and estrogen, although no prostatic tumor was seen. In prostate cancer model transgenic mice, the onset of prostatic tumorigenesis as well as tumor growth was significantly potentiated by introduction of the AR T877A mutation into the prostate. Genetic screening of mice identified Wnt-5a as an activator. Enhanced Wnt-5a expression was detected in the malignant prostate tumors of patients, whereas in benign prostatic hyperplasia such aberrant up-regulation was not obvious.

This study aims to explore the trends of CM use among prostate cancer patients under NHI.  Methods:   Claims of CM outpatient services from 1996 to 2008 were obtained from NHI Research Database. CM visits of prostate cancer patients were identified. Claims with diagnosis code of prostate cancer were defined as cancer-specific visits.  Results:   Among 78 323 prostate cancer patients identified during 1996-2008, there were 30 383 (38.8%) CM users and 327 063 CM outpatient visits. The prevalence of CM use in each cross-sectional year increased slightly from 24.9% to 25.6%. Most CM visits (92.7%) were non-cancer-specific. There were greater increases in the proportion of cancer-specific CM visits (from 2.3% to 10.6%) and high-utility CM users (from 3.1% to 19.7%). Most CM services were provided by private clinics (68.1% to 79.2%). The most frequently used CM therapies were Chinese herbal medicine (72.8% to 78.8%), followed by acupuncture/traumatology manipulative therapies (28.1% to 36.8%). Total CM cost increased from $122 247 to $825 454. The average cost per CM visit increased from $14.0 to $19.6. The annual cost per CM user increased from $88.0 to $134.4. Copayment accounted for 6.6% to 11.7%.  Conclusions:   There was a trend of increased CM use among prostate cancer patients under NHI.

Although many case-control studies have associated obesity to prostate cancer aggressiveness, few have correlated markers of prostate pathology to biomarkers of visceral obesity and insulin resistance, using an apparently healthy cohort. This study aims to fill this gap.  Materials and methods:   The 219 consenting adult Arab men, aged 30-70 years, were included in this cross-sectional study. Demographics were noted and anthropometrics measured. Fasting blood samples were extracted, and glycaemic and lipid profile were determined using routine laboratory methods. Serum adipocytokines and inflammatory markers were measured using multiplex assays. Total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), parathyroid-related protein (PTHrP) and endoglin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.  Results:   Serum triglycerides and waist-hip ratio (WHR) were significantly and positively associated with circulating (tPSA) levels in all subjects (P < 0·01). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), adiponectin, active plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (aPAI-1) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) had significant inverse associations to tPSA. Stepwise linear regression revealed that adiponectin, IGF-1, WHR and PTHrP explained 30% of variance in tPSA levels (P < 0·0001), while SBP, resistin and BMI explained 18·7% of variance in endoglin (P = 0·001).

This article critically assesses the features of the GreenLight™ laser and its potential use in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients. Recently, a significant body of evidence in the literature on good clinical outcomes in 1-year follow-up periods has been enriched with the findings from a few randomized trials, in which this device is compared with other minimally invasive or standard approaches. In turn, very few patients in the GreenLight laser study groups reach the end point of a 3- or 5-year follow-up time. However, most patients who underwent GreenLight laser treatment were treated successfully with a good clinical outcome and a minor rate of peri- and post-operative complications. Furthermore, it can be implemented in high-risk patients who are undergoing anticoagulation therapy. Bearing in mind the inherent characteristics of using a laser for treatment, one obvious consequence is that no pathological specimen remains for further study. This implies the necessity of suitable patient selection in whom the risk of prostate cancer should be minimal.

Correlates of distress, need for services and met and unmet need for services were investigated.  Methods:   Immediately after cancer treatment (T1) and 2 months later (T2), 302 patients completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and a single question assessing the need for services. All distressed patients (HSCL-25≥39) and non-distressed patients endorsing a need for services were then called (n = 99) to assess their need.  Results:   Thirty-seven percent (T1) and 31% (T2) of patients were distressed and 31% (T1) and 18% (T2) expressed the need for services. Both time points showed higher distress in younger patients and females and lower distress in prostate cancer and patients treated by radiotherapy only. Less need for services was found in prostate cancer (T1), greater need was related to being single (T1) and younger (T2). Distress and need for services were positively related (p<0.001). The HSCL-25 showed modest sensitivity (T1: 0.59, T2: 0.65) and specificity (T1: 0.75, T2: 0.78) as an indicator of need for services. Interviews at T2 revealed that 51% of distressed patients needed no psychosocial services and 25% were already receiving services. At T2, regardless of distress level, 10% of all screened patients reported an unmet need for psychosocial services.  Conclusions:   Depending on the clinical context, screening might be more efficient if it assessed the unmet need for services rather than distress. More attention should be concentrated on directing patients with meetable unmet needs to available services.""","""['Corinne van Scheppingen', 'Maya J Schroevers', 'Ans Smink', 'Yvette M van der Linden', 'Véronique E Mul', 'Johannes A Langendijk', 'James C Coyne', 'Robbert Sanderman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Screening for distress and supportive care needs during the initial phase of the care process: a qualitative description of a clinical pilot experiment in a French cancer center.', 'What do 1281 distress screeners tell us about cancer patients in a community cancer center?', 'The detection and management of emotional distress in cancer patients: the views of health-care professionals.', 'Screening for distress and depression in cancer settings: 10 lessons from 40 years of primary-care research.', 'Screening for distress and unmet needs in patients with cancer: review and recommendations.', 'The role of integrated psychological support in breast cancer patients: a randomized monocentric prospective study evaluating the Fil-Rouge Integrated Psycho-Oncological Support (FRIPOS) program.', 'Neighborhood Deprivation and Rurality Associated With Patient-Reported Outcomes and Survival in Men With Prostate Cancer in NRG Oncology RTOG 0415.', 'Effect of depression, anxiety, and distress screeners on the need, intention, and utilization of psychosocial support services among cancer patients.', 'Patient-reported needs for coping with worry or fear about cancer recurrence and the extent to which they are being met: a survey study.', 'Effect of sex on psychological distress and fatigue over time in a prospective cohort of cancer survivors.']"""

We assessed the occurrence of both HO-1 expression and PTEN deletion in two cohorts of men with localized and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The phenotypic cooperation of these markers was examined in preclinical and clinical models. Overall, there was a statistically significant difference in HO-1 epithelial expression between benign, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), localized PCA, and CRPC (p < 0.0001). The highest epithelial HO-1 expression was noted in CRPC (2.00 ± 0.89), followed by benign prostate tissue (1.49 ± 1.03) (p = 0.0003), localized PCA (1.20 ± 0.95), and HGPIN (1.07 ± 0.87) (p < 0.0001). However, the difference between HGPIN and PCA was not statistically significant (p = 0.21). PTEN deletions were observed in 35/55 (63.6%) versus 68/183 (37.1%) cases of CRPC and localized PCA, respectively. Although neither HO-1 overexpression nor PTEN deletions alone in localized PCA showed a statistically significant association with PSA relapse, the combined status of both markers correlated with disease progression (log-rank test, p = 0.01). In a preclinical model, inhibition of HO-1 by shRNA in PTEN-deficient PC3M cell line and their matched cells where PTEN is restored strongly reduced cell growth and invasion in vitro and inhibited tumour growth and lung metastasis formation in mice compared to cells where only HO-1 is inhibited or PTEN is restored. In summary, we provide clinical and experimental evidence for cooperation between epithelial HO-1 expression and PTEN deletions in relation to the PCA patient's outcome.

Methods:   A tissue microarray (TMA) of 200 prostate cancer patients and benign prostate tissue controls was used to assess the epithelial and stromal protein expression of TRAIL, death receptors (DR4 and DR5), decoy receptors (DcR1 and DcR2), and the FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP(L) ). We correlated these expression patterns with clinicopathological parameters and determined its impact on recurrence-free survival.  Results:   Nearly all (99.5%) prostate cancer tissues examined displayed either decreased expression of pro-apoptotic TRAIL receptors, increased FLIP(L) expression, or both. We observed elevated death receptor, decoy receptor, FLIP(L) , and epithelial TRAIL expression in prostate cancer epithelium. TRAIL expression in the stromal tumor microenvironment surrounding the prostate cancer was markedly lower. Elevated TRAIL expression in the tumor microenvironment was also significantly associated with increased recurrence-free survival (P = .014), after controlling for other prognostic markers. In contrast, epithelial expression of TRAIL did not have an effect on overall survival.  Conclusions:   Expression of the components of the pro-apoptotic TRAIL pathway is altered in prostate cancer. Moreover, TRAIL expression in the tumor microenvironment may affect recurrence-free survival rate of prostate cancer patients. Consequently, these results may be useful in devising future therapeutic strategies targeting the TRAIL pathway in prostate cancer.""","""['Mariam Anees', 'Peter Horak', 'Ahmed El-Gazzar', 'Martin Susani', 'Georg Heinze', 'Paul Perco', 'Massimo Loda', 'Rosina Lis', 'Michael Krainer', 'William K Oh']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Perturbation of the tumor necrosis factor--related apoptosis-inducing ligand cascade in ovarian cancer: overexpression of FLIPL and deregulation of the functional receptors DR4 and DR5.', 'Low-dose 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate enhances tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand-R4 decoy receptor expression is correlated with high Gleason scores, prostate-specific antigen recurrence, and decreased survival in patients with prostate carcinoma.', 'Mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer.', 'Getting personal with prostate cancer: adding new pieces to an incomplete jigsaw puzzle.', 'Combined efficacy of Cinnamomum zeylanicum and doxorubicin against leukemia through regulation of TRAIL and NF-kappa B pathways in rat model.', 'A Novel Apoptosis-Related Gene Signature Predicts Biochemical Recurrence of Localized Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Exploring the Potential of MicroRNA Let-7c as a Therapeutic for Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiple Interactions Between Cancer Cells and the Tumor Microenvironment Modulate TRAIL Signaling: Implications for TRAIL Receptor Targeted Therapy.', 'Circulating Levels of Inflammatory Proteins and Survival in Patients with Gallbladder Cancer.']"""

Search for molecular signatures present in primary tumors that predict tumor metastasis potential has been proposed and in particular, a 17-gene molecular signature is associated with poor survival in breast cancer, prostate cancer, meduloblastoma and lymphoma in a recent study. Using quantitative real-time PCR assay (qPCR), our study observed tumor-normal differential RNA expression in 15 of these 17 genes in a cohort of 52 stage III colorectal cancer patients (all p<0.05), which signified the importance of these 17 signature genes in colorectal cancer. Although no significant correlation was found between tumor RNA levels of these 17 genes and some of clinical features (age, gender, and location, all p>0.05), two distinct groups among these genes were observed with Spearman correlation scores>0.6 (p<0.01), suggesting co-expression/interaction within these genes. Of the 37 patients for whom complete follow-up data was available, 12 patients had recurrence and 25 had no recurrence. There was no significant difference in tumor RNA levels between recurrence and non-recurrence groups for the 17 genes (all p>0.05), but the recurrence group had more patients with mucinous tumors (9/12 vs. 7/25, p<0.05) and more lymph node involvement (median 7.2 vs. 2.5, p<0.05) compared to the non-recurrence group. Moreover, survival analysis revealed a significant difference in patient overall survival time between low and high tumor RNA levels for 1 of the 17 genes (PTTG1, p=0.024).

Upregulation of the coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR), leading to increased viral transduction, has been proposed as the main mechanism. In the present study, we found that the highest increase in transgene expression was achieved when non-toxic concentrations of FK228 were added immediately after transduction, demonstrating that the main effect by which FK228 enhances transgene expression is transduction-independent. FK228 had positive effects both on Ad5 and Ad5/f35 vectors with a variety of transgenes and promoters, indicating that FK228 works mainly by increasing transgene expression at the transcriptional level. In some cases, the effects were dramatic, as demonstrated by an increase in CD40L expression by FK228 from 0.3% to 62% when the murine prostate cancer cell line TRAMP-C2 was transduced with Ad[CD40L]. One unexpected finding was that FK228 decreased the transgene expression of an adenoviral vector with the prostate cell-specific PPT promoter in the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines LNCaP and PC-346C. This is probably a consequence of alteration of the adenocarcinoma cell lines towards a neuroendocrine differentiation after FK228 treatment. The observations in this study indicate that FK228 enhances adenoviral therapy by a transduction-independent mechanism. Furthermore, since histone deacetylase inhibitors may affect the differentiation of cells, it is important to keep in mind that the activity and specificity of tissue- and tumor-specific promoters may also be affected.""","""['Angelika Danielsson', 'Helena Dzojic', 'Victoria Rashkova', 'Wing-Shing Cheng', 'Magnus Essand']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The histone deacetylase inhibitor FK228 given prior to adenovirus infection can boost infection in melanoma xenograft model systems.', 'Impact of novel histone deacetylase inhibitors, CHAP31 and FR901228 (FK228), on adenovirus-mediated transgene expression.', 'Tissue-targeted in vivo gene transfer coupled with histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide (FK228) enhances adenoviral infection in rat renal cancer allograft model systems.', 'New targets for therapy in prostate cancer: modulation of stromal-epithelial interactions.', 'Romidepsin (FK228), A Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor and its Analogues in Cancer Chemotherapy.', 'Brd4 Inactivation Increases Adenoviral Delivery of BMP2 for Paracrine Stimulation of Osteogenic Differentiation as a Gene Therapeutic Concept to Enhance Bone Healing.', 'Enhancement of adenovirus infection and adenoviral vector-mediated gene delivery by bromodomain inhibitor JQ1.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors restore cell surface expression of the coxsackie adenovirus receptor and enhance CMV promoter activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.']"""

For example, during prostate carcinogenesis, the regulatory function played by the androgen receptor is often converted from a growth suppressor to an oncogene thus promoting prostate cancer cell survival and eventual metastasis. Within the cytoplasm, steroid hormone receptor activity is regulated by the Hsp90 chaperone in conjunction with a series of co-chaperone proteins. Collectively, Hsp90 and its binding associates form a large heteromeric complex that scaffold the fully mature receptor for binding with the respective hormone.

Methods and materials:   The generalized LKB model was fitted to the Grade ≥2 late rectal toxicity data in two ways: by using DVHs representing physical dose to rectum, and by using a modified approach in which dose bins in the rectal DVH were corrected for differences in dose per fraction using the LQ model, with α/β estimated as an additional unknown parameter. The analysis included only patients treated with the same treatment plan throughout radiotherapy, so that the dose per fraction to each voxel of rectum could be determined from the DVH. The likelihood ratio test was used to assess whether the fit of the LQ-corrected model was significantly better than the fit of the LKB model based on physical doses to rectum.  Results:   The analysis included 509 of the 1,084 patients enrolled on RTOG 94-06. The estimate of α/β from the LQ-corrected LKB model was 4.8 Gy, with 68% confidence interval 0.6 Gy to 46 Gy.

There is currently no widely accepted procedure for the treatment of complex RUF, such as those complicated by radiotherapy, previous attempts at repair, or large in size.  Methods:   Thirteen patients who underwent transperineal repair with gracilis muscle interposition for complex RUF were identified. Records were reviewed for fistula etiology, prior repair, intraoperative findings, hospital course, complications, diversion reversal, and outcome. Follow-up data were gathered from clinic visits and questionnaires.  Results:   Preoperative diagnoses included: prostate cancer (PCA) (12) and imperforate anus (1). Treatment for PCA included radical prostatectomy (4); brachytherapy (BT) (3); external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) + BT (3); cryoablation (1); and EBRT + cryoablation (1). Five patients underwent prior unsuccessful repair. There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperative complications included fecal incontinence (3) and bladder neck contracture (1). Nine patients (75%) reported some degree of urinary incontinence, with 2 patients reporting this as significant, defined as incontinence ""most of the time."" Suprapubic catheters were removed after 6 weeks, and median stomal reversal was at 17.5 weeks (12-28). One patient developed a recurrent RUF. All patients completed quality-of-life questionnaires assessing urinary and fecal outcome. Fecal outcome measures were generally better than urinary, but both were reasonable given the complexity of the situation.

Methods:   We studied 516 men younger than 75 years old with incident prostate cancer during 2005-08 in 33 counties in Southwest Georgia (SWGA), a rural area of 700,000 (40% African American). Treatment data were abstracted from medical records, and interviews conducted with 314 men. We also compared treatments in SWGA vs. Atlanta in 2005.  Results:   External radiation plus brachytherapy was the most common treatment in SWGA (31%), followed by external radiation alone (27%), and surgery (18%). Patients in SWGA had higher odds of external radiation vs. surgery than men in Atlanta (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.85-3.81). African Americans had higher odds of choosing treatment other than surgery, compared with whites (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.57-2.63), more so in SWGA (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.92-6.41) than Atlanta (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.32-2.35) (P = .05). Poor communication with their physician was reported by 13% of men in SWGA, more among African Americans than whites (OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.52-10.30), and more among those who had no treatment vs. some treatment (OR 5.77, 95% CI 1.88-11.46).  Conclusions:   In both rural and urban Georgia, white men with prostate cancer had surgery more frequently than African Americans, although data suggest this may be caused more by income differences than race. Rural patients as opposed to urban patients were more likely to receive external radiation and less likely to receive brachytherapy alone or surgery.

Materials and methods:   An analysis was carried out on 151 prostate cancer patients treated with radical dose radiotherapy between January 2007 and March 2009. Patients had their height, weight and daily intrafraction prostate displacement data collected prospectively during fiducial marker image-guided radiotherapy with orthogonal imaging. For each of anterior-posterior, left-right and superior-inferior axes, a univariable linear regression analysis was carried out with the individual patient standard deviation of shift as the response variable and BMI as a continuous explanatory variable.  Results:   Displacement measurements were recorded from 4764 pre- and post-treatment image sets. Patients were grouped according to BMI as normal weight (24%), overweight (52%), obese (18%), severely obese (3%) or morbidly obese (3%). For intrafraction displacement, a one unit increase in BMI affected the standard deviation of shift by: anterior-posterior -0.02 (95% confidence interval -0.040 to 0.000), left-right -0.006 (95% confidence interval -0.020 to 0.008) and superior-inferior -0.020 (95% confidence interval -0.037 to -0.003).  Conclusions:   Our data indicate that patients with a higher BMI have less intrafraction displacement of the prostate in the superior-inferior dimension compared with patients with a lower BMI. This has implications for individualised treatment margins for future prostate cancer patients undergoing image-guided radiotherapy.

In this study, frequency-domain analysis of the radio-frequency signals from photoacoustic imaging was performed to generate quantitative parameters for tissue characterization. To account for the response of the imaging system, the photoacoustic spectra were calibrated by dividing the photoacoustic spectra (radio-frequency ultrasound spectra resulting from laser excitation) from tissue by the photoacoustic spectrum of a point absorber excited under the same conditions. The resulting quasi-linear photoacoustic spectra were fit by linear regression and midband fit, slope and intercept were computed from the best-fit line. These photoacoustic spectral parameters were compared between the region-of-interests (ROIs) representing prostate adenocarcinoma tumors and adjacent normal flank tissue in a murine model. The mean midband fit and intercept in the ROIs showed significant differences between cancerous and noncancerous regions.

The catalytic activity of MHY336 on the topoisomerase II enzyme was the same as that of the etoposide. In a cell-free system, MHY336 exhibited a potent activity on scavenging of reactive oxygen species against 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1)-induced oxidative stress. An in vitro cell-based assay demonstrated that MHY336 significantly inhibited the proliferation of three prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 cells. Notably, the cytotoxicity of MHY336 was more potent in LNCaP cells (IC(50)=1.39 μM) than in DU145 (IC(50)=2.94 μM) and PC3 cells (IC(50)=3.72 μM). Furthermore, MHY336 treatment induced similar levels of cytotoxicity compared to doxorubicin treatment (IC(50)=1.55 μM) in LNCap cells. Also, MHY336 significantly down-regulated topoisomerase II alpha expression and up-regulated p53 expression in LNCaP cells (wild-type p53), whereas it up-regulated the topoisomerase II alpha protein in both DU145 and PC3 cells (p53 mutated or deleted). MHY336 induced G2/M or S phase arrest in LNCaP cells through a well-documented topoisomerase II-dependent mechanism. Further studies using Annexin V-FITC binding assay, DAPI staining, and Western blot analyses illustrated that MHY336 markedly induced apoptotic cell death via the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway in LNCaP cells. These results suggest that MHY336 is an attractive chemotherapeutic agent because of its topoisomerase II-mediated anti-tumour activity in human prostate cancer.""","""['Nabanita Patra', 'Umasankar De', 'Jin-Ah Kang', 'Ji Mim Kim', 'Mee Young Ahn', 'Jaewon Lee', 'Jee H Jung', 'Hae Young Chung', 'Hyung Ryong Moon', 'Hyung Sik Kim']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['WRC-213, an l-methionine-conjugated mitoxantrone derivative, displays anticancer activity with reduced cardiotoxicity and drug resistance: identification of topoisomerase II inhibition and apoptotic machinery in prostate cancers.', ""Synthesis and evaluation of aroylthiourea derivatives of 4-β-amino-4'-O-demethyl-4-desoxypodophyllotoxin as novel topoisomerase II inhibitors."", 'Adenosine induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell lines, LNcap-FGC-10, DU-145, and PC3.', 'Contemporary challenges in the design of topoisomerase II inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy.', 'Topoisomerase as target for antibacterial and anticancer drug discovery.', 'Antiplasmodial Activity of Hydroalcoholic Extract from Jucá (Libidibia ferrea) Pods.', 'Design and synthesis of novel rigid dibenzob,fazepines through ring closure technique as promising anticancer candidates against leukaemia and acting as selective topoisomerase II inhibitors and DNA intercalators.', 'Topo II inhibition and DNA intercalation by new phthalazine-based derivatives as potent anticancer agents: design, synthesis, anti-proliferative, docking, and in\xa0vivo studies.', 'Drug repositioning by merging active subnetworks validated in cancer and COVID-19.', 'Chronic exposure to the gibberellin derivative GA-13315 sensitizes breast cancer MCF-7 cells but not colon cancer HCT116 cells to irinotecan.']"""

Despite the use of analgesic for the relief of such pain, the outcomes are not often satisfactory. Strontium-89 (89Sr) is a pure beta-emitting radioisotope to be avidly concentrated in the areas of high osteoblastic activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 89Sr in the therapy for bone metastases of prostate carcinoma. 116 patients received intravenous injection of 89Sr at the dose of 3mCi (111MBq). All patients underwent physical examination and Karnofsky's Performance Score (KPS) evaluation before and after administration; the analgesic effects were evaluated by scores of pain. The complete response (CR) was defined as scores of pain > 75%; no response (NR) was defined as scores of pain < 25% the remaining was partial response (PR). The changes of bone metastases were screened by CT, MRI and 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy according to the standards of WHO. After the treatment with 89Sr, the total response rate was 80.2%.

Methods:   During development of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(®)) Sexual Function measure, we collected focus group and survey data on communication with oncology professionals about sexual problems. We conducted 16 focus groups with patients and survivors (n = 109) and analyzed the discussions for major themes, including experiences discussing sex during oncology visits. During testing of the PROMIS Sexual Function measure, we assessed experiences discussing sexual problems with oncology professionals (n = 819) and measured bivariate associations between asking for information from clinicians and sexual function and satisfaction with sex life.  Results:   Most patients and survivors (74%) thought that discussions with oncology professionals about sexual problems were important, but whether they had ever received information about sexual function from a provider varied by cancer type (23% lung, 29% breast, 39% colorectal, and 79% prostate). Those who had asked an oncology professional about sexual problems had significantly greater interest in sexual activity as well as more sexual dysfunction.  Conclusions:   Sexual problems are a widespread concern among patients and survivors, but there is much variation in experiences of communication about sexual issues, and many patients do not receive the information they need from their oncology providers. There are large differences in sexual function between patients who do and do not ask providers about sexual problems.

Although it is produced at high levels by all stages of prostate cancer, it is uncertain if PSA plays a role in prostate cancer initiation and progression. We decided to investigate the impact of PSA and its enzymatic activity on tumor cell growth rates.  Methods:   A gene-specific shRNA lentiviral construct reduced endogenous PSA expression in the LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line. Resulting changes in growth rates in vitro and in vivo were determined. Using a mass spectroscopy-based approach, alterations to the LNCaP proteome due to reduced PSA were measured. Finally, to evaluate the importance of PSA's proteolytic activity, the PSA-null Du145 human prostate cancer cell line was engineered to express either enzymatically inactive pro-PSA (WT) or a furin-activated variant (FR) with high enzymatic activity. The resulting clones were evaluated for PSA-induced changes in growth rates in vivo and in vitro.  Results:   Lowered PSA levels dramatically reduced LNCaP growth rates. Expressing active PSA (FR), but not the inactive WT variant, conferred a growth advantage on Du145 cells. Proteomics analysis revealed global changes to the LNCaP proteome as a result of reduced PSA expression.  Conclusions:   These studies demonstrate the importance of PSA to prostate cancer cell growth.

The mechanism of this STH remains unclear because there is no suitable model to study BPH pathology. Previously, we reported a new experimental BPH model that is clinically relevant to STH (the STH model). To elucidate prostatic STH mechanism, we used a compound found to be effective in the STH model.  Methods:   A binding protein specific for the effective compound in the STH model was pulled down using a compound-conjugated affinity matrix and identified by mass spectrometry. The RNA interference (RNAi) method was used to confirm the participation of the binding protein in cell proliferation. The binding protein expression in the prostate was assessed by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   A benzimidazole derivative (Benz) significantly suppressed growth of implanted urogenital sinuses (UGS; 37.1%) in the STH model and inhibited the proliferation of human prostate stromal cells (PrSC) in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.43 µM). Vesicle amine transport protein-1 (VAT-1) was identified as a specific binding protein of Benz. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the VAT-1 expression level was higher in both epithelial and stromal cells of rat UGS and human BPH tissue than in normal prostate. VAT-1 siRNA markedly inhibited proliferation of PrSC, two androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and DU145), and suppressed UGS growth (28.2%) in the STH model.

Expression of TMPRSS2/ETS-related gene (ERG) fusion gene transcripts is linked with tumor proliferation, invasion, and an aggressive phenotype. The aim of this study was to define the effect of TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene expression on chemo- and radiosensitivity in prostate tumor cell lines.  Materials/methods:   Clonogenic survival of PC3 and DU145 cells stably expressing TMPRSS2/ERG Types III and VI fusion genes was measured after X-irradiation (0-8 Gy) and Paclitaxel. Cell cycle changes and DNA double-strand break induction and repair were assessed. Differential gene expression was measured by microarray analysis. ERG signaling pathway interactions were studied using Ariadne Pathway Studio.  Results:   Expression of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusions in PC3 cells increased radiation sensitivity and decreased paclitaxel sensitivity. Increased radiosensitivity was associated with persistent DNA breaks 24 hr post-irradiation, down-regulation of genes involved in DNA repair and mitosis and up-regulation of ETV, an ETS transcription factor. However, DU145 Types III and VI demonstrated a different sensitivity phenotype and gene expression changes. Pathway analysis of ERG signaling further illustrated the variation between the PC3 and DU145 cell lines containing TMPRSS2/ERG fusions.  Conclusions:   The effect of TMPRSS2/ERG gene fusions had differing effects on radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity depending on cell line and fusion type.

Methods:   Eighty seven patients (mean age = 62.92; SD = 13.23) were recruited prior to undergoing an investigative procedure for either prostate (n = 45) or bladder (n = 42) cancer. Patients completed measures of psychological impairment (state anxiety and worry) and 82 also competed measures of trait EI and perceived social support. Multivariate linear regression was used to predict the direct and moderated effects of trait EI and perceived social support on psychological impairment.  Results:   Thirty one percent of patients were considered to be suffering from clinical levels of state anxiety. Trait EI was a significant predictor of state anxiety, worry regarding the appointment, worry regarding the outcome of the appointment and perceived social support. In contrast, perceived social support was not predictive of psychological impairment on any measure and did not moderate the relationship between trait EI and psychological impairment.  Conclusions:   Patients urgently referred for urological cancer investigations are a group at risk of psychological impairment and may benefit from healthcare professional support.

To investigate this, we generated bigenic mice in which both activated human AKT1 and human MYC are expressed in the prostate (MPAKT/Hi-MYC model). In contrast to mice expressing AKT1 alone (MPAKT model) or MYC alone (Hi-MYC model), the bigenic phenotype demonstrates accelerated progression of mouse prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) to microinvasive disease with disruption of basement membrane, significant stromal remodeling and infiltration of macrophages, B- and T-lymphocytes, similar to inflammation observed in human prostate tumors. In contrast to the reversibility of mPIN lesions in young MPAKT mice after treatment with mTOR inhibitors, Hi-MYC and bigenic MPAKT/Hi-MYC mice were resistant. Additionally, older MPAKT mice showed reduced sensitivity to mTOR inhibition, suggesting that additional genetic events may dampen mTOR dependence.

High grade forms of these tumors may present ambiguous morphologic features that do not permit a definite diagnosis. This distinction between the two tumors has significant staging and therapeutic implications. Hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential for optimal patient care. p63 is a new marker which can be used in this context. It is expressed in most of the urothelial carcinomas and negative in majority of prostatic adenocarcinomas.  Aim:   To compare the expression of p63 in urothelial carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of prostate.  Materials and methods:   Comparative cross--sectional study was carried out at a tertiary cancer hospital from 15 June 2006 to 15 December 2006. Immunohistochemical stain p63 was performed on 50 cases of urothelial carcinoma and 50 prostatic adenocarcinomas. Patients' name, age, histology numbers, grade of tumor, and expression of p63 were recorded. p63 expression was seen in 44 of 50 urothelial carcinomas (88%).

Most documentation is for mammography. This article investigates the prevalence of such unadjusted-to-adjusted ""reversed associations"" (RA) for Pap, colorectal, and prostate testing. We also investigate large percent changes (LPC) to the unadjusted ORs.  Methods:   Data were from the 2004/2006/2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the 2000/2003/2005/2008 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Analyses used a consistent set of covariates.  Results:   RAs were more common for non-Hispanic blacks than Hispanics, but Hispanics had a greater number of LPCs. RAs and LPCs occurred more often for Pap testing than colorectal and prostate testing. However, results from the BRFSS and NHIS were often not consistent.  Conclusions:   Attention should be given to the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, as well as public programs addressing other cancers, as possible contributors to RAs and LPCs. Hispanics may show more RAs in analyses of future data. Discrepancies between the BRFSS and the NHIS also must be recognized and explained.

In the present study, we found that PC3 prostate cancer cells and cell lines derived from breast (MCF7) and lung (A-427) cancers contain 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase (5-HEDH) activity and have the ability to synthesize 5-oxo-ETE from its precursor 5S-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) when added as an exogenous substrate. H(2)O(2) strongly stimulated the synthesis of 5-oxo-ETE and induced dramatic increases in the levels of both glutathione disulfide and NADP(+). The effects of H(2)O(2) on 5-oxo-ETE and NADP(+) were blocked by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), indicating that this effect was mediated by the glutathione reductase-dependent generation of NADP(+), the cofactor required by 5-HEDH. 5-Oxo-ETE synthesis was also stimulated by agents that have cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, including 4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid, tamoxifen and MK-886. Because PC3 cells have only modest 5-LO activity compared with inflammatory cells, we investigated their ability to contribute to the transcellular biosynthesis of 5-oxo-ETE from neutrophil-derived 5-HETE. Stimulation of neutrophils with arachidonic acid and calcium ionophore in the presence of PC3 cells led to a large and selective increase in 5-oxo-ETE synthesis compared with controls in which PC3 cell 5-oxo-ETE synthesis was selectively blocked by pretreatment with NEM. The ability of prostate tumor cells to synthesize 5-oxo-ETE may contribute to tumor cell proliferation as well as the influx of inflammatory cells, which may further induce cell proliferation through the release of cytokines. 5-Oxo-ETE may be an attractive target in cancer therapy.""","""['Gail E Grant', 'Stephen Rubino', 'Sylvie Gravel', 'Xiaoping Wang', 'Pranav Patel', 'Joshua Rokach', 'William S Powell']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['The eosinophil chemoattractant 5-oxo-ETE and the OXE receptor.', 'Oxidative stress stimulates the synthesis of the eosinophil chemoattractant 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid by inflammatory cells.', 'Substrate selectivity of 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase and its inhibition by 5-hydroxy-Delta6-long-chain fatty acids.', 'Biochemistry, biology and chemistry of the 5-lipoxygenase product 5-oxo-ETE.', 'Design and synthesis of affinity chromatography ligands for the purification of 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase.', 'Molecular Characterization of Membrane Steroid Receptors in Hormone-Sensitive Cancers.', 'Elevation of ω-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Attenuates PTEN-deficiency Induced Endometrial Cancer Development through Regulation of COX-2 and PGE2 Production.', 'Biosynthesis and actions of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) on feline granulocytes.', 'Biosynthesis, biological effects, and receptors of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and oxoeicosatetraenoic acids (oxo-ETEs) derived from arachidonic acid.', 'Omega-3 fatty acid is a potential preventive agent for recurrent colon cancer.']"""

Final results are 11 symptom indexes that reflect the highest priorities of people affected by these 11 advanced cancers and the experienced perspective of the people who provide their medical treatment.

PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase and a potent tumor suppressor involved in broad cellular functions; however, its role in prostate cancer has not yet been determined. Here, we have investigated the effect of PP2A activity modulation on the androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. Our data show that the PPP2CA expression and PP2A activity is downregulated in androgen-independent (C4-2) prostate cancer cells as compared with androgen-dependent (LNCaP) cells. Downregulation of PP2A activity by pharmacologic inhibition or short interfering RNA-mediated PPP2CA silencing sustains the growth of LNCaP cells under an androgen-deprived condition by relieving the androgen deprivation-induced cell-cycle arrest and preventing apoptosis. Immunoblot analyses reveal enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), BAD, increased expression of cyclins (A1/D1), and decreased expression of cyclin inhibitor (p27) on PP2A downregulation. Furthermore, our data show that androgen receptor (AR) signaling is partially maintained in PP2A-inhibited cells through increased AR expression and ligand-independent phosphorylation. Pharmacologic inhibition of Akt, ERK, and AR suggest a role of these signaling pathways in facilitating the androgen-independent growth of LNCaP cells. These observations are supported by the effect of ceramide, a PP2A activator, on androgen-independent C4-2 cells. Ceramide inhibited the growth of C4-2 cells on androgen deprivation, an effect that could be abrogated by PP2A downregulation. Altogether, our findings suggest that modulation of PP2A activity may represent an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer.""","""['Arun Bhardwaj', 'Seema Singh', 'Sanjeev K Srivastava', 'Richard E Honkanen', 'Eddie Reed', 'Ajay P Singh']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['PPP2R2C loss promotes castration-resistance and is associated with increased prostate cancer-specific mortality.', 'Signal transduction pathways in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell proliferation.', '5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol supports human prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation through androgen receptor-independent signaling pathways: implication of androgen-independent prostate cancer progression.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The role of cyclins in the development and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Disparities and Management in Southern Africa: Insights into Practices, Norms and Values.', 'Pleiotropy of PP2A Phosphatases in Cancer with a Focus on Glioblastoma IDH Wildtype.', 'Reciprocal regulation of CIP2A and AR expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'PP2A promotes apoptosis and facilitates docetaxel sensitivity via the PP2A/p-eIF4B/XIAP signaling pathway in prostate cancer.', 'MYB interacts with androgen receptor, sustains its ligand-independent activation and promotes castration resistance in prostate cancer.']"""

Several studies have suggested that TMEFF2 plays a role in suppressing the growth and invasive potential of human cancer cells, whereas others suggest that the shed portion of TMEFF2, which lacks the cytoplasmic region, has a growth-promoting activity. Here we show that TMEFF2 has a dual mode of action. Ectopic expression of wild-type full-length TMEFF2 inhibits soft agar colony formation, cellular invasion, and migration and increases cellular sensitivity to apoptosis. However, expression of the ectodomain portion of TMEFF2 increases cell proliferation. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identify sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH), the enzyme that converts sarcosine to glycine, as a TMEFF2-interacting protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analysis confirms the interaction of SARDH with full-length TMEFF2. The ectodomain does not bind to SARDH. Moreover, expression of the full-length TMEFF2 but not the ectodomain results in a decreased level of sarcosine in the cells.

Results:   The range of PSI was 2.23-67.21 (29.97 ± 15.58) in malignant tumors and 0. 4-43.6 (7.79 ± 8.75) in benign lesions (AUC=0.90), while the range of ASI was 2.84-47.9 (8.38 ± 12.20) in malignant tumors and 0.4 -2.79 (5.85 ± 7.29) in benign lesions (AUC=0.62). There was significant difference of PSI values between the benign and malignant lesions (P<0.01).

Thus, in the present study, the biological mechanisms of melatonin were elucidated in association with SPHK1 pathway in PC-3 prostate cancer cells under hypoxia. Melatonin inhibited the stability of HIF-1α in a time- and concentration- dependent manners. Also, melatonin decreased SPHK1 activity in PC-3 cells during hypoxia. Furthermore, melatonin suppressed AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) signaling pathway, which stabilizes HIF-1α via inhibition of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein. Consistently, siRNA-SPHK1 and sphingosine kinase inhibitor (SKI) effectively blocked the expression of HIF-1α, phospho-AKT and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in PC-3 cells under hypoxia, suggesting the role of SPHK1 in melatonin-inhibited HIF-1α accumulation. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acteylcysteine enhanced melatonin-inhibited HIF-1α expression and SPHK1 activity.

Stable expression of human MMP-9 in a poorly metastatic LNCaP prostate cancer cell line produced a 2-3-fold increase in MMP-9 activity and a comparable increase in invasiveness. Transient transfection of LNCaP stable clone expressing MMP-9 with MMP-9 antisense oligonucleotide (ASODN) produced 55-90% less MMP-9 than control cells and were proportionately less invasive. In contrast, manipulating MMP-9 levels had no effect on cell migration across an uncoated membrane.

Material and methods:   We reviewed PCT and firstly acquired CBCT datasets of each ten patients with prostate cancer. Three physicians independently delineated the prostate based on PCT and CBCT with MRI as guidance, allowing determination of inter-physician variability. Two physicians repeated prostate contouring three times in total to investigate intra-physician variability. We compared delineated prostate volumes in terms of the generalized conformity index (CI(gen)), maximum variation ratio (MVR), and center of mass (COM).  Results:   There were no significant inter-/intra-observer differences in the estimation of prostate volume on both PCT and CBCT. For both inter- and intra-observer variability in contouring the prostate gland, there were no significant differences in MVR between PCT and CBCT. The CI(gen) for inter-observer variability was 0.74 by PCT and 0.69 by CBCT. The CI(gen) for intra-observer variability on PCT and CBCT was 0.84 and 0.81 for observer 2 and 0.76 and 0.73 for observer 3. COM analyses showed that the greatest inter-/intra-observer variability was in the measurement of the prostate apex and base. With respect to CI(gen) and COM analysis for the inter-observer variability, more precise delineation of the prostate was possible on PCT than CBCT. More precise contouring in terms of both CI(gen) and COM was demonstrated by observer 2 than observer 3.  Conclusions:   Despite some ambiguity in apex and base level, there was a good consistency in delineating the gland on CBCT plus MRI-guided modification both among/within observer(s), without any significant difference from the consistency in defining the prostate on PCT.

Our objective was to establish whether transrectal (TR) SEG may improve prostate cancer detection, alone or associated with other US methods.  Patients and methods:   We analyzed the data of 65 patients, mean age 68 years (49 - 81 years), examined March 2009-September 2010. The patients had at least one of the following malignancy suspicion criteria: PSA > 4 ng /ml (minimum 2 determinations), nodule(s) at digital rectal examination (DRE +) or previous gray scale TRUS positive appearance. All patients underwent TRUS, Doppler-US and SEG in the same session, followed by systematic prostate biopsies (6-12 cores). Histopathology and imaging findings were correlated.  Results:   Twenty-eight out of 65 patients (43%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Overall, SEG had a sensitivity of 67.85%, specificity 62.16%, positive predictive value 57.57% and negative predictive value 71.85%. However, SEG diagnostic reliability appeared to be higher for subgroups of patients having PSA >10 ng / ml, lower number of fragments collected by PBP (6 vs. 10-12 cores) and age > 70 years.

Since its conception, utility of the prostate cancer nomogram has more than tripled. Limited information is available on the relation between the nomograms' predicted probabilities and obesity. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the predictions from a validated postoperative prostate cancer nomogram were associated with obesity.  Methods:   We carried out a cross-sectional analysis of 1220 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) in southern California from 2000 to 2008. Progression-free probabilities (PFPs) were ascertained from the 10-year Kattan postoperative nomogram. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   In the present study, aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason ≥7), but not advanced stage, was associated with obesity (p = 0.01). After adjusting for age, black race, family history of prostate cancer and current smoking, an inverse association was observed for 10-year progression-free predictions (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.28-0.90) and positive associations were observed for preoperative PSA levels (OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.01-1.50) and Gleason >7 (OR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.11-1.90).  Conclusion:   Obese RP patients were more likely to have lower PFP values than non-obese patients, suggesting a higher risk of experiencing prostate cancer progression.

ARR(2)Pb.Stat3C x PTEN(+/-) mice exhibited a more severe prostate phenotype compared with ARR(2)Pb.Stat3C and PTEN(+/-) mice. ARR(2)Pb.Stat3C x PTEN(+/-) mice developed adenocarcinomas in the ventral prostate as early as 6 months (22% incidence) that reached an incidence of 61% by 12 months. Further evaluations indicated that phospho-Stat3, phospho-Akt, phospho-nuclear factor κB, cyclin D1, and Ki67 were upregulated in adenocarcinomas from ARR(2)Pb.Stat3C x PTEN(+/-) mice. In addition, membrane staining for β-catenin and E-cadherin was reduced. The changes in Stat3 and nuclear factor κB phosphorylation correlated most closely with tumor progression.

From 1971 to 2001, the number of cancer survivors in the United States increased from 3.0 million to 9.8 million. To update those data, published in 2004, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and CDC analyzed cancer incidence and follow-up information from nine Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programs to estimate the number of persons in the United States ever diagnosed with cancer who were alive on January 1, 2007. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that the number of cancer survivors increased from 9.8 million in 2001 to 11.7 million in 2007. Breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers were the most common types of cancer among survivors, accounting for 51% of diagnoses. As of January 1, 2007, an estimated 64.8% of cancer survivors had lived≥5 years after their diagnosis of cancer, and 59.5% of survivors were aged≥65 years. Because many cancer survivors live long after diagnosis and the U.S. population is aging, the number of persons living with a history of cancer is expected to continue to increase. Public health and health-care professionals should understand the potential long-term needs of cancer survivors, engage in health promotion (e.g., urging cancer screening and smoking cessation), and ensure coordination of follow-up care for this growing population.""","""['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep""","""['Cancer survivorship--United States, 1971-2001.', 'Multiple cancer prevalence: a growing challenge in long-term survivorship.', 'Survivorship: adult cancer survivors.', 'Long-term survivors of childhood cancers in the United States.', 'Cancer treatment and survivorship statistics, 2014.', 'Cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety and depression in cancer survivors: a meta-analysis.', 'Effects of Tobacco Smoking on the Survivability of Patients with Multiple Cancers and Single Lung Cancer.', 'The Practice of Physical Activity After Breast Cancer Treatments: A Qualitative Study Among Portuguese Women.', 'NCCN Guidelines® Insights: Palliative Care, Version 2.2021.', 'Survivorship, Version 1.2021.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate long-term clinical outcomes of patients with BCR and to determine predictors of disease progression and mortality in these men.  Design, setting, and participants:   We reviewed our institutional registry of 14 632 patients who underwent RRP between 1990 and 2006 to identify 2426 men with BCR (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels ≥ 0.4 ng/ml) who did not receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Median follow-up was 11.5 yr after RRP and 6.6 yr after BCR.  Intervention:   RRP.  Measurements:   Patients were grouped into quartiles according to time from RRP to BCR. Survival after BCR was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze clinicopathologic variables associated with systemic progression and death from PCa.  Results and limitations:   Median systemic progression-free survival (PFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) had not been reached after 15 yr of follow-up after BCR. Cancer-specific mortality 10 yr after BCR was 9.9%, 9.3%, 7.8%, and 4.7% for patients who experienced BCR <1.2 yr, 1.2-3.1 yr, 3.1-5.9 yr, and >5.9 yr after RRP, respectively (p=0.10). On multivariate analysis, time from RRP to BCR was not significantly associated with the risk of systemic progression (p=0.50) or cancer-specific mortality (p=0.81). Older patient age, increased pathologic Gleason score, advanced tumor stage, and rapid PSA doubling time (DT) predicted systemic progression and death from PCa. Limitations included retrospective design, varied utilization of salvage therapies, and the inclusion of few patients with positive lymph nodes.

Methods:   The National Health Interview Survey collected information on PSA test use among 16,058 men > or = 40 years of age in 2000 and 2005. We examined two outcomes: (1) having had a recent (within two years) screening PSA test and (2) having had three or more PSA tests in the past five years (to indicate frequent use).  Results:   Marital status, family history of prostate cancer, and having seen a doctor in the past year differed over time in the unadjusted model. In the adjusted model, recent PSA screening decreased from 2000 to 2005 for single, never-married men, but increased for men with chronic diseases. Frequent PSA test use increased for men with a family history of prostate cancer, men with chronic diseases, and men who had seen a physician in the past year. Significant correlates of higher recent PSA test use included being older, married, and of black race/ethnicity; having higher levels of education and income, health-care coverage, and a usual place of health care; and increased comorbidity.  Conclusion:   Major organizations are not in agreement about the efficacy of prostate cancer screening; however, men > or = 40 years of age continue to use the PSA test. Both recent screening and frequent testing showed variability during the study period and may have implications for the ongoing randomized clinical trials that are expected to clarify whether early detection of prostate cancer with PSA testing increases survival.""","""['Louie E Ross', 'Yhenneko J Taylor', 'Daniel L Howard']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Public Health Rep""","""['Patterns in prostate-specific antigen test use and digital rectal examinations in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2002-2006.', 'Use of the prostate-specific antigen test among U.S. men: findings from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey.', 'A population-based survey of prostate-specific antigen testing among California men at higher risk for prostate carcinoma.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates and factors associated with screening in Eastern Canadian men: Findings from cross-sectional survey data.', 'Emerging cancer incidence, mortality, hospitalisation and associated burden among Australian cancer patients, 1982 - 2014: an incidence-based approach in terms of trends, determinants and inequality.', 'Association Between Antidiabetic Medications and Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels and Biopsy Results.', 'Prostate Cancer Mortality-To-Incidence Ratios Are Associated with Cancer Care Disparities in 35 Countries.', 'Determinants of Prostate Cancer Screening Intentions of Young Black Men Aged 18 to 40\xa0Years.']"""

Materials and methods:   Hundred patients with the bladder TCC who had undergone standard radical cystoprostatectomy were enrolled in this study. A number of factors, including vascular and perineural invasion, number of tumors, maximum diameter of the tumor, presence of carcinoma in situ, distance between the tumor and the bladder neck, grade, and local stage of the tumor were recorded, and their relationships with prostatic involvement were studied. In addition, hydronephrosis and age of the patients were included in the analysis.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 62.6 ± 10.8 years. Of a total of 100 patients, 21 (75%) were found to have prostatic involvement with TCC. Univariate statistical analysis showed that vascular invasion and the distance between the tumor and the bladder neck were significantly related to the prostatic involvement (P = .001 and P < .001) and tumor stage had relatively low P value (P = .08). In the logistic regression, only the distance between the tumor and the bladder neck was found to be significantly related to the prostatic involvement (P = .004).

Lycopene, an antioxidant phytochemical, has antitumor activity against prostate cancer (PCa) in several models and is generally safe. We present data on the interaction between docetaxel and lycopene in CRPC models. The growth-inhibitory effect of lycopene on PCa cell lines was positively associated with insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) levels. In addition, lycopene treatment enhanced the growth-inhibitory effect of docetaxel more effectively on DU145 cells with IGF-IR high expression than on those PCa cell lines with IGF-IR low expression. In a DU145 xenograft tumor model, docetaxel plus lycopene caused tumor regression, with a 38% increase in antitumor efficacy (P = .047) when compared with docetaxel alone. Lycopene inhibited IGF-IR activation through inhibiting IGF-I stimulation and by increasing the expression and secretion of IGF-BP3. Downstream effects include inhibition of AKT kinase activity and survivin expression, followed by apoptosis. Together, the enhancement of docetaxel's antitumor efficacy by lycopene supplementation justifies further clinical investigation of lycopene and docetaxel combination for CRPC patients. CRPC patients with IGF-IR-overexpressing tumors may be most likely to benefit from this combination.""","""['Yaxiong Tang', 'Basmina Parmakhtiar', 'Anne R Simoneau', 'Jun Xie', 'John Fruehauf', 'Michael Lilly', 'Xiaolin Zi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['The Anti-Cancer Activity of Lycopene: A Systematic Review of Human and Animal Studies.', 'Increased serum insulin-like growth factor-1 levels are associated with prolonged response to dasatinib-based regimens in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of skeletal growth of human prostate cancer by the combination of docetaxel and BKM1644: an aminobisphosphonate derivative.', 'Co-administration of piperine and docetaxel results in improved anti-tumor efficacy via inhibition of CYP3A4 activity.', 'The potential role of lycopene for the prevention and therapy of prostate cancer: from molecular mechanisms to clinical evidence.', 'Codelivery of Phytochemicals with Conventional Anticancer Drugs in Form of Nanocarriers.', 'The Role of ERα and ERβ in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Current Therapeutic Approaches.', 'The Anti-Cancer Activity of Lycopene: A Systematic Review of Human and Animal Studies.', 'Can Diet Prevent Urological Cancers?

It is overexpressed in many tumors and a validated target for anticancer therapy. In cell-free systems, polypyrimidic peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) can form triplex-like structures with messenger RNAs and halt the ribosomal machinery during the translation elongation. A 17-mer PNA that formed a PNA(2):mRNA complex with a purine-rich sequence located in the coding region of IGF-1R mRNA induced the synthesis of a truncated IGF-1R in vitro. This PNA down-regulated expression of the receptor by 70-80% in prostate cancer cells without affecting insulin receptor expression that exhibits high homology with IGF-1R. Inhibition occurs at the translational level, since the IGF-1R mRNA level measured by quantitative RT-PCR was not affected by PNA treatment. In addition, IGF-1R knockdown by PNA led to an attenuation of phosphorylation of downstream signaling pathways, PI3K/AKT and MAPK, involved in survival and mitogenesis and also to a decrease in cell transformation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS; Using the 2003 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, we analyzed a national sample of 12,480 community-based elders. Differences in prevalence of geriatric syndromes between those with and without cancer were estimated. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to evaluate whether cancer was independently associated with geriatric syndromes.  Results:   Two thousand three hundred forty-nine (18%) reported a history of cancer. Among those with cancer, 60.3% reported one or more geriatric syndromes as compared with 53.2% of those without cancer (P < .001). Those with cancer overall had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of hearing trouble, urinary incontinence, falls, depression, and osteoporosis than those without cancer. Adjusting for possible confounders, those with a history of cancer were more likely to experience depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.30; P = .023), falls (adjusted OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.32; P = .010), osteoporosis (adjusted OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.38; P = .004), hearing trouble (adjusted OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.52; P = .005), and urinary incontinence (adjusted OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.69; P < .001). Analysis of specific cancer subtypes showed that lung cancer was associated with vision, hearing, and eating trouble; prostate cancer was associated with incontinence and falls; cervical/uterine cancer was associated with falls and osteoporosis; and colon cancer was associated with depression and osteoporosis.

We assessed temporal trends in their utilization and their impact on national health care spending.  Methods:   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data, we determined treatment patterns for 45,636 men age ≥ 65 years who received definitive surgery or radiation for localized prostate cancer diagnosed from 2002 to 2005. Costs attributable to prostate cancer care were the difference in Medicare payments in the year after versus the year before diagnosis.  Results:   Patients received surgery (26%), external RT (38%), or brachytherapy with or without RT (36%). Among surgical patients, MIRP utilization increased substantially (1.5% among 2002 diagnoses v 28.7% among 2005 diagnoses, P < .001). For RT, IMRT utilization increased substantially (28.7% v 81.7%; P < .001) and for men receiving brachytherapy, supplemental IMRT increased significantly (8.5% v 31.1%; P < .001). The mean incremental cost of IMRT versus 3D-CRT was $10,986 (in 2008 dollars); of brachytherapy plus IMRT versus brachytherapy plus 3D-CRT was $10,789; of MIRP versus open RP was $293. Extrapolating these figures to the total US population results in excess spending of $282 million for IMRT, $59 million for brachytherapy plus IMRT, and $4 million for MIRP, compared to less costly alternatives for men diagnosed in 2005.

An accurate early localization of prostate cancer, permitting efficient use of modern focal therapies, is currently hampered by a lack of imaging methods. Several methods have aimed at detecting microvascular changes associated with prostate cancer with limited success by quantitative imaging of blood perfusion. Differently, we propose contrast-ultrasound diffusion imaging, based on the hypothesis that the complexity of microvascular changes is better reflected by diffusion than by perfusion characteristics. Quantification of local, intravascular diffusion is performed after transrectal ultrasound imaging of an intravenously injected ultrasound contrast agent bolus. Indicator dilution curves are measured with the ultrasound scanner resolution and fitted by a modified local density random walk model, which, being a solution of the convective diffusion equation, enables the estimation of a local, diffusion-related parameter. Diffusion parametric images obtained from five datasets of four patients were compared with histology data on a pixel basis. The resulting receiver operating characteristic (curve area = 0.91) was superior to that of any perfusion-related parameter proposed in the literature.

Patients have a substantial need for information, decision aids, and psychosocial support. Recordings of initial oncology consultations improve information recall, reduce anxiety, enhance patient satisfaction with communication, and increase patients' perceptions that the essential aspects of their disease and treatment have been addressed during the consultation. Despite the research evidence supporting the provision of consultation recordings, uptake of this intervention into oncology practice has been slow. The primary aim of this project is to conduct an implementation study to explicate the contextual factors, including use of evidence, that facilitate and impede the transfer and uptake of consultation-recording use in a sample of patients newly diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer.  Methods:   Sixteen oncologists from cancer centres in three Canadian cities will participate in this three-phase study. The preimplementation phase will be used to identify and address those factors that are fundamental to facilitating the smooth adoption and delivery of the intervention during the implementation phase. During the implementation phase, breast and prostate cancer patients will receive a recording of their initial oncology consultation to take home. Patient interviews will be conducted in the days following the consultation to gather feedback on the benefits of the intervention. Patients will complete the Digital Recording Use Semi-Structured Interview (DRUSSI) and be invited to participate in focus groups in which their experiences with the consultation recording will be explored. Oncologists will receive a summary letter detailing the benefits voiced by their patients. The postimplementation phase includes a conceptual framework development meeting and a seven-point dissemination strategy.  Discussion:   Consultation recording has been used in oncology, family medicine, and other medicine specialties, and despite affirming evidence and probable applications to a large number of diseases and a variety of clinical contexts, clinical adoption of this intervention has been slow. The proposed study findings will advance our conceptual knowledge of the ways to enhance uptake of consultation recordings in oncology.""","""['Thomas F Hack', 'J Dean Ruether', 'Lorna M Weir', 'Debjani Grenier', 'Lesley F Degner']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Implement Sci""","""['Promoting consultation recording practice in oncology: identification of critical implementation factors and determination of patient benefit.', ""Behind closed doors II: systematic analysis of prostate cancer patients' primary treatment consultations with radiation oncologists and predictors of satisfaction with communication."", 'Behind closed doors: systematic analysis of breast cancer consultation communication and predictors of satisfaction with communication.', 'Audio-taping the oncology treatment consultation: a literature review.', 'Consultation audio-tapes: an information aid, and a quality assurance and research tool.', 'Information Access and Use by Patients With Cancer and Their Friends and Family: Development of a Grounded Theory.', 'The use of the PARIHS framework in implementation research and practice-a citation analysis of the literature.', 'Advancing complexity science in healthcare research: the logic of logic models.', 'Balancing exploration and exploitation in transferring research into practice: a comparison of five knowledge translation entity archetypes.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and potential role of FOXA1 and GATA3 transcription factors as prognostic factors in prostate cancer.  Methods and results:   Expression of FOXA1, GATA3 and androgen receptor (AR) was retrospectively analysed by immunohistochemistry in a series of 80 primary tumours and 28 metastatic prostate cancers, including 15 matched paired samples. Nuclear AR expression did not significantly differ between primary and metastatic tumours. High-level nuclear FOXA1 expression was seen in 19% of primary and 89% of metastatic tumours (P < 0.0001). FOXA1 expression correlated positively with tumour size, extraprostatic extension, angiolymphatic invasion, AR and lymph node metastases at diagnosis, but did not correlate with age, T stage, Gleason score, presence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or multifocality, seminal vesicle or perineural invasion, or surgical excision margin status.

We examined the impact of the PR on postoperative urinary and other quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).  Methods:   We identified 89 patients who underwent RALP for prostate cancer between 2006 and 2009 by a single surgeon (R.G.), consented to participate in our prospective QoL study, which collects RAND-UCLA QoL and AUA symptom scores for all patients undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, and completed a baseline and a 3- or 6-month questionnaire. Of these, 31 patients had PR before vesicourethral anastomosis. We compared return to baseline function percentage at 3 and 6 months by PR group. Differences found in univariate analysis were further investigated using multiple linear regression models adjusting for demographics, clinical variables, and nerve-sparing status.  Results:   While most patients had both 3- and 6-month follow-up (n = 74, 83%), sample size at 3 months was n = 86 and at 6 months was n = 77. Groups were comparable by preoperative characteristics, pathologic stage, nerve-sparing status, and baseline QoL/AUA symptom scores. At 3-months, there was a statistically significant improvement comparing PR to non-PR groups in return to baseline score for urinary bother (72% vs. 53%; p = 0.008) and urinary function (64% vs. 50%; p = 0.05), as well as change in absolute AUA symptom score (+0.2 vs. +3.8; p = 0.005). Differences in urinary bother (+20%; 95% confidence interval 5%, 34%) and AUA symptom score (-2.8; 95% confidence interval, -5.4, -0.2) persisted after multivariate adjustment. Groups had similar scores for all parameters by 6 months postprostatectomy.

We used commercially available microarrays to establish miRNA expression profiles from a cohort of 20 cancer samples. The expression of selected miRNAs was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and the identity of miRNA expressing cells was determined by miRNA in situ hybridization. We identified 25 miRNAs that showed a significant differential expression in cancer samples. The comparison with previously published data generated by deep sequencing of cDNA libraries of small RNA molecules revealed a concordance rate of 47% among miRNAs identified with both techniques. The differential expression of miRNAs miR-375, miR-143 and miR-145 was validated by quantitative PCR. MiRNA in situ hybridization revealed that the differential expression is cancer-cell associated. A combination of three miRNAs correctly classified tissue samples with an accuracy of 77.6% with an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 0.810.

Here we showed that γTE treatment promoted apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy in human prostate PC-3 and LNCaP cancer cells. In search of potential mechanisms of γTE-provoked effects, we found that γTE treatment led to marked increase of intracellular dihydroceramide and dihydrosphingosine, the sphingolipid intermediates in de novo sphingolipid synthesis pathway but had no effects on ceramide or sphingosine. The elevation of these sphingolipids by γTE preceded or coincided with biochemical and morphological signs of cell death and was much more pronounced than that induced by γT, which accompanied with much higher cellular uptake of γTE than γT. The importance of sphingolipid accumulation in γTE-caused fatality was underscored by the observation that dihydrosphingosine and dihydroceramide potently reduced the viability of both prostate cell lines and LNCaP cells, respectively. In addition, myriosin, a specific inhibitor of de novo sphingolipid synthesis, counteracted γTE-induced cell death. In agreement with these cell-based studies, γTE inhibited LNCaP xenograft growth by 53% (p < 0.05), compared to 33% (p = 0.07) by γT, in nude mice.

Methods:   The pharmacokinetics (PK) of EGCG and ascorbic acid were determined in immunocompromised mice and compared with concentrations measured in human PK studies of dietary supplements. Antitumor activity of bortezomib in combination with EGCG or ascorbic acid was determined using several dosing regimens to evaluate different target plasma concentrations of EGCG and ascorbic acid.  Results:   Bortezomib dosed twice-weekly at 0.8 mg/kg IV demonstrated tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 53.9-58.9%.

We performed a prospective, controlled and non-randomized study on 120 patients with advanced PCa after HT who received HIFU, CRT, HIFU+LRT and HT alone, respectively. CT/MR imaging showed the primary tumours and pelvic lymph node metastases visibly shrank or even disappeared after HIFU+LRT treatment. There were significant differences among four groups with regard to overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) curves (P = 0.018 and 0.015). Further comparison between each pair of groups suggested that the long-term DSS of the HIFU+LRT group was higher than those of the other three groups, but there was no significant difference between the HIFU+LRT group and the CRT group. Multivariable Cox's proportional hazard model showed that both HIFU+LRT and CRT were independently associated with DSS (P = 0.001 and 0.035) and had protective effects with regard to the risk of death. Compared with CRT, HIFU+LRT significantly decreased incidences of radiation-related late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity grade ≥ II. In conclusion, long-term survival of patients with advanced PCa benefited from strengthening local control of primary tumour and regional lymph node metastases after HT. As an alternative to CRT, HIFU+LRT showed good efficacy and better safety.""","""['Rui-Yi Wu', 'Guo-Min Wang', 'Lei Xu', 'Bo-Heng Zhang', 'Ye-Qing Xu', 'Zhao-Chong Zeng', 'Bing Chen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Impact of image guidance on toxicity and tumour outcome in moderately hypofractionated external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Results of a phase II study using estramustine phosphate and vinblastine in combination with high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Whole-gland ablation of localized prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound: oncologic outcomes and morbidity in 1002 patients.', 'Technological advances in radiotherapy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of late rectal toxicity from conventional versus three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer: analysis of clinical and dosimetric factors.', 'Focused Ultrasound and Ultrasound Stimulated Microbubbles in Radiotherapy Enhancement for Cancer Treatment.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound plus concomitant radiotherapy: a new weapon in oncology?', 'An overview of prostate diseases and their characteristics specific to Asian men.']"""

In this study, the frequency of patients with IPMNs developing extrapancreatic cancers during follow-up was examined.  Methods:   642 patients with IPMNs were prospectively followed up for 4.8 years on average. They underwent clinical examination at least twice a year. The incidence of the observed extrapancreatic malignancies was compared with the expected incidence of the age- and gender-matched general Japanese population based on the Vital Statistics of Japan.  Results:   40 extrapancreatic cancers developed in 39 patients during follow-up (1.3% per year). The most common malignancies were hepatocellular (n=7), colorectal (n=6), gastric (n=6), lung (n=5) and prostate cancers (n=4). The calculated standardised incidence rate of each of the malignancies was not significant, as follows: hepatocellular 2.17 (95% CI 0.87 to 4.47), colorectal 1.02 (0.37 to 2.21), gastric 0.76 (0.28 to 1.66), lung 0.75 (0.24 to 1.76) and prostate 1.00 (0.71 to 1.29). Pancreatic cancer was observed in 17 patients during the same period, with a standardised incidence rate of 10.7 (6.2 to 17.1).  Conclusions:   The incidence of extrapancreatic malignancies in patients with IPMNs was similar to that in the general population, whereas the incidence of pancreatic cancers was significantly high.

The current study was focused on further elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind the antitumor function of NDRG1. We have identified for the first time that NDRG1 upregulates the potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. This effect was observed in three different cancer cell types, including PC3MM and DU145 prostate cancer cells and H1299 lung carcinoma cells, and occurred independently of p53. In addition, reducing NDRG1 expression using short hairpin RNA in PC3MM and DU145 cells resulted in significantly reduced p21 protein levels. Hence, p21 is closely correlated with NDRG1 expression in these latter cell types. Examining the mechanisms behind the effect of NDRG1 on p21 expression, we found that NDRG1 upregulated p21 via transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms in prostate cancer cells, although its effect on H1299 cells was posttranscriptional only. Further studies identified two additional NDRG1 protein targets. The dominant-negative p63 isoform, ΔNp63, which has been found to inhibit p21 transcription, was downregulated by NDRG1. On the other hand, a truncated 50 kDa MDM2 isoform (p50(MDM2)), which may protect p21 from proteasomal degradation, was upregulated by NDRG1. The downregulation of ΔNp63 and upregulation of p50(MDM2) are potential mechanisms by which NDRG1 increases p21 expression in these cells. Additional functional studies identified that NDRG1 inhibits cancer cell migration, suggesting that p21 is a molecular player in its antimetastatic activity.""","""['Zaklina Kovacevic', 'Sutharshani Sivagurunathan', 'Helena Mangs', 'Sherin Chikhani', 'Daohai Zhang', 'Des R Richardson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Differential targeting of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21CIP1/WAF1, by chelators with anti-proliferative activity in a range of tumor cell-types.', 'Ganglioside GM3 modulates tumor suppressor PTEN-mediated cell cycle progression--transcriptional induction of p21(WAF1) and p27(kip1) by inhibition of PI-3K/AKT pathway.', 'Hyperinducibility of hypoxia-responsive genes without p53/p21-dependent checkpoint in aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Metastasis suppressor, NDRG1, mediates its activity through signaling pathways and molecular motors.', 'The role of NDRG1 in the pathology and potential treatment of human cancers.', 'A Review of the Regulatory Mechanisms of N-Myc on Cell Cycle.', 'The Influence of NDRG1 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms on Glioma Risk and Prognosis in Chinese Han Population.', 'Reversing oncogenic transformation with iron chelation.', 'Identification of PIM1 substrates reveals a role for NDRG1 phosphorylation in prostate cancer cellular migration and invasion.', 'Novel Thiosemicarbazones Sensitize Pediatric Solid Tumor Cell-Types to Conventional Chemotherapeutics through Multiple Molecular Mechanisms.']"""

This study explored the behavior of a sphingoid base analogue, (2S,3S,5S)-2-amino-3,5-dihydroxyoctadecane (Enigmol), that cannot be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases and is slowly N-acylated and therefore is more persistent than natural sphingoid bases. Enigmol had potential anticancer activity in a National Cancer Institute (NCI-60) cell line screen and was confirmed to be more cytotoxic and persistent than naturally occurring sphingoid bases using HT29 cells, a colon cancer cell line. Although the molecular targets of sphingoid bases are not well delineated, Enigmol shared one of the mechanisms that has been found for naturally occurring sphingoid bases: normalization of the aberrant accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus and cytoplasm of colon cancer cells due to defect(s) in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/β-catenin regulatory system. Enigmol also had antitumor efficacy when administered orally to Min mice, a mouse model with a truncated APC gene product (C57Bl/6J(Min/+) mice), decreasing the number of intestinal tumors by half at 0.025% of the diet (w/w), with no evidence of host toxicity until higher dosages. Enigmol was also tested against the prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC-3 in nude mouse xenografts and suppressed tumor growth in both.

Here we report that the procancerous cytokine IL-8 (interleukin-8) upregulates CXCR7 expression along with ligand-independent functions of CXCR7 that promote the growth and proliferation of human prostate cancer cells (CaP cells). In cell culture, ectopic expression or addition of IL-8 selectively increased expression of CXCR7 at the level of mRNA and protein production. Conversely, suppressing IL-8 signaling abolished the ability of IL-8 to upregulate CXCR7. RNAi-mediated knockdown of CXCR7 in CaP cells caused multiple antitumor effects, including decreased cell proliferation, cell-cycle arrest in G(1) phase, and decreased expression of proteins involved in G(1) to S phase progression. In contrast, addition of the CXCR7 ligand SDF-1a and CXCL11 to CaP cells did not affect cell proliferation. Over expression of CXCR7 in normal prostate cells increased their proliferation in a manner associated with increased levels of phospho-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor; pY1110) and phospho-ERK1/2. Notably, coimmunoprecipitation studies established a physical association of CXCR7 with EGFR, linking CXCR7-mediated cell proliferation to EGFR activation. Consistent with these findings, CXCR7-depleted CaP tumors grew more slowly than control tumors, expressing decreased tumor-associated expression of VEGF, cyclin D1, and p-EGFR. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism of ligand-independent growth promotion by CXCR7 and its coregulation by the proinflammatory factor IL-8 in prostate cancer.""","""['Rajendra Kumar Singh', 'Bal L Lokeshwar']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and chemokine receptors 4 and 7 form a signaling axis to regulate CXCL12-dependent cellular motility.', 'The chemokine receptor CXCR7 interacts with EGFR to promote breast cancer cell proliferation.', 'Chemokine CXCL12 activates dual CXCR4 and CXCR7-mediated signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Chemokine receptor trio: CXCR3, CXCR4 and CXCR7 crosstalk via CXCL11 and CXCL12.', 'Chemokine receptor CXCR7 activates Aurora Kinase A and promotes neuroendocrine prostate cancer growth.', 'IL-8 Produced Via Bidirectional Communication Between Prostate Cancer and M2 Macrophages as a Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker.', 'CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'CXCR4-CXCL12-CXCR7 and PD-1/PD-L1 in Pancreatic Cancer: CXCL12 Predicts Survival of Radically Resected Patients.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate rates of biochemical no evidence of disease (bNED) in patients treated with loose seeds compared with RS from this population-based cohort.  Methods and materials:   Between July 1998 and February 2006, 1500 implants were performed (327 loose and 1173 RS). Biochemical failure is reported using the Phoenix definition and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >0.4ng/mL at ≥48 months postimplant. Actuarial estimates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis was repeated with the first 100 loose and stranded implants excluded to assess the learning curve effect. Log-rank test was used to evaluate differences in bNED. Variables showing association with bNED were included in a multivariate model.  Results:   There was no difference between loose and stranded seeds. Estimated rate of bNED was 93.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.6-96.4) at 7 years for patients treated with loose seeds and 94.0% (95% CI, 91.8-96.2) for patients treated with RS according to Phoenix definition (p=0.846). Using the PSA >0.4ng/mL definition, estimated rates were 91.3% (95% CI, 88.0-94.6) and 91.9% (95% CI, 89.7-94.1) for loose and stranded seeds, respectively (p=0.871). Exclusion of the first 100 loose and stranded implants also revealed no difference in bNED.

The prescribed doses of brachytherapy and EBRT were 100 Gy and 45 Gy in 25 fractions, respectively. The rectal dosimetric factors were analyzed for rectal volumes receiving >100 Gy and >150 Gy (R100 and R150) during brachytherapy and for rectal volumes receiving >30 Gy to 40 Gy (V30-V40) during EBRT therapy in 373 patients for whom datasets were available. The patients were followed from 21 to 72 months (median, 45 months) after the I-125 seed implantation.  Results:   Forty-four patients (9.7%) developed Grade 2 rectal bleeding.

Materials and method:   Retrospective study of 536 patients with stage pT2 prostate cancer, treated with radical prostatectomy between 1996 and 2007. Subsequent to the prostatectomy, the following variables were collected: Gleason score, pathological stage, capsular invasion, surgical margins and perineural invasion. We performed a univariate analysis and subsequently adjusted it by means of a Cox proportional hazard model (enter method).  Results:   21.7% presented positive surgical margins and 20.9% developed biochemical recurrence after a mean follow-up of 57 months. 37.9% of the patients with pathological involvement of the resection surgical margins presented biochemical recurrence against 16% that did not have it (p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, only the surgical margin (p<0.001) and the Gleason score greater or equal to 8 (p<0.001) behaved as independent biochemical recurrence factors. On stratifying the series according to these two variables, we found that the patients with positive surgical margins and a Gleason score of ≤ 7 have a recurrence probability at 5 and 10 years of 35% and 50% against 74% and 87% in the group with positive surgical margins and a Gleason score of ≥ 8 (p=0.002).  Conclusion:   Patients with pT2 prostate cancer, positive surgical margins and a Gleason score of ≥ 8 will benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy. 50% of the patients with positive margins and a Gleason score of ≤ 7 will not recur, which means that the indication of adjuvant radiotherapy continues to be controversial.""","""['J E Rosas-Nava', 'F Herranz-Amo', 'E V Paños-Fagundo', 'E Lledó-García', 'F Verdú-Tartajo', 'C Hernández-Fernández']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Importance of tumor location in patients with high preoperative prostate specific antigen levels (greater than 20 ng/ml) treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Contemporary survival results and the role of radiation therapy in patients with node negative seminal vesicle invasion following radical prostatectomy.', 'Lymphovascular invasion is an independent prognostic factor in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Avoidance and management of positive surgical margins before, during and after radical prostatectomy.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Organ-limited prostate cancer with positive resection margins.

The purpose of this work was to compare clinically optimized dose distributions using proposed (169)Yb and (170)Tm HDR sources with the clinical dose distribution from a standard microSelectron V2 HDR iridium-192 ((192)Ir) brachytherapy source (Nucletron B.V., Veenendaal, The Netherlands).  Methods and materials:   CT-based treatment plans of 10 patients having prostate volumes ranging from 17 to 92cm(3) were studied retrospectively. Clinical treatment of these patients involved 16 catheters and a microSelectron V2 HDR (192)Ir source. All dose plans were generated with inverse planning simulated annealing optimization algorithm. Dose objectives used for the (192)Ir radionuclide source were used for the other two radionuclides. The dose objective parameters were adjusted to obtain the same clinical target (prostate) volume coverage as the original (192)Ir radionuclide plan. A complete set of dosimetric indices was used to compare the plans from different radionuclides. A pairwise statistical analysis was also performed.  Results and conclusions:   All the dose distributions optimized with specific (192)Ir, (169)Yb, and (170)Tm sources satisfied the standard clinical criteria for HDR prostate implants, such as those for the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group clinical trial 0321, for combined HDR and external beam treatment for prostate adenocarcinoma. For equivalent clinical target volume dose coverage, the specific (169)Yb and (170)Tm sources resulted in a statistically significant dose reduction to organs at risk compared with microSelectron V2 HDR (192)Ir source.

HistoStitcher(©) provides both an intuitive graphical interface to assist the operator in performing the stitch of adjacent histology fragments by selecting pairs of anatomical landmarks, and a set of computational routines for determining and applying an optimal linear transformation to generate the stitched image. Reconstruction of whole histological sections from images of slides containing smaller fragments is required in applications where preparation of whole sections of large tissue specimens is not feasible or efficient, and such whole mounts are required to facilitate (a) disease annotation and (b) image registration with radiological images. Unlike manual reassembly of image fragments in a general purpose image editing program (such as Photoshop), HistoStitcher(©) provides memory efficient operation on high resolution digitized histology images and a highly flexible stitching process capable of producing more accurate results in less time. Further, by parameterizing the series of transformations determined by the stitching process, the stitching parameters can be saved, loaded at a later time, refined, or reapplied to multi-resolution scans, or quickly transmitted to another site. In this paper, we describe in detail the design of HistoStitcher(©) and the mathematical routines used for calculating the optimal image transformation, and demonstrate its operation for stitching high resolution histology quadrants of a prostate specimen to form a digitally reassembled whole histology section, for 8 different patient studies. To evaluate stitching quality, a 6 point scoring scheme, which assesses the alignment and continuity of anatomical structures important for disease annotation, is employed by three independent expert pathologists. For 6 studies compared with this scheme, reconstructed sections generated via HistoStitcher(©) scored higher than reconstructions generated by an expert pathologist using Photoshop.""","""['Jonathan Chappelow', 'John E Tomaszewski', 'Michael Feldman', 'Natalie Shih', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['AutoStitcher: An Automated Program for Efficient and Robust Reconstruction of Digitized Whole Histological Sections from Tissue Fragments.', 'Spatially weighted mutual information (SWMI) for registration of digitally reconstructed ex vivo whole mount histology and in vivo prostate MRI.', 'Semi-automatic stitching of filamentous structures in image stacks from serial-section electron tomography.', 'Utility of whole slide imaging and virtual microscopy in prostate pathology.', 'Whole-slide imaging and automated image analysis: considerations and opportunities in the practice of pathology.', 'Computational pathology in ovarian cancer.', 'Reconstructing virtual large slides can improve the accuracy and consistency of tumor bed evaluation for breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy.', '3D Registration of pre-surgical prostate MRI and histopathology images via super-resolution volume reconstruction.', 'Nutil: A Pre- and Post-processing Toolbox for Histological Rodent Brain Section Images.', 'Cryogenic sequenced layering for the 3D reconstruction of biological objects.']"""

One strategy to accomplish this is to selectively cripple the involved tumor resistance mechanisms, thereby allowing the affected anticancer drugs to gain therapeutic efficacy. Such an approach is exemplified by our design and synthesis of the intracellular hypoxic cell activated methylating agent, 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-methyl-2-[[1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethoxy]carbonyl]hydrazine (KS900) that targets the O-6 position of guanine in DNA. KS900 is markedly more cytotoxic in clonogenic experiments under conditions of oxygen deficiency than the non-intracellularly activated agents KS90, and 90M, when tested in O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) non-expressing cells (EMT6 mouse mammary carcinoma, CHO/AA8 hamster ovary, and U251 human glioma), and than temozolomide when tested in AGT expressing cells (DU145 human prostate carcinoma). Furthermore, KS900 more efficiently ablates AGT in HL-60 human leukemia and DU145 cells than the spontaneous globally activated methylating agent KS90, with an IC(50) value over 9-fold lower than KS90. Finally, KS900 under oxygen-deficient conditions selectively sensitizes DU145 cells to the chloroethylating agent, onrigin, through the ablation of the resistance protein AGT. Thus, under hypoxia, KS900 is more cytotoxic at substantially lower concentrations than methylating agents such as temozolomide that are not preferentially activated in neoplastic cells by intracellular reductase catalysts. The necessity for intracellular activation of KS900 permits substantially greater cytotoxic activity against cells containing the resistance protein O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) than agents such as temozolomide. Furthermore, the hypoxia-directed intracellular activation of KS900 allows it to preferentially ablate AGT pools under the oxygen-deficient conditions that are present in malignant tissue.""","""['Raymond P Baumann', 'Kimiko Ishiguro', 'Philip G Penketh', 'Krishnamurthy Shyam', 'Rui Zhu', 'Alan C Sartorelli']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Reductive activation of the prodrug 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-2-1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethoxycarbonylhydrazine (KS119) selectively occurs in oxygen-deficient cells and overcomes O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase mediated KS119 tumor cell resistance.', '4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl derivatives of O(6)-benzylguanine as hypoxia-activated prodrug inhibitors of O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), which produces resistance to agents targeting the O-6 position of DNA guanine.', 'The antineoplastic efficacy of the prodrug Cloretazine is produced by the synergistic interaction of carbamoylating and alkylating products of its activation.', 'New cytotoxic agents for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma: temozolomide and related alkylating agents in combination with guanine analogues to abrogate drug resistance.', 'Inactivation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase as a means to enhance chemotherapy.', 'pH-dependent general base catalyzed activation rather than isocyanate liberation may explain the superior anticancer efficacy of laromustine compared to related 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine prodrugs.', 'Key role of hydrazine to the interaction between oxaloacetic against phosphoenolpyruvic carboxykinase (PEPCK): ONIOM calculations.', 'Chloroethylating and methylating dual function antineoplastic agents display superior cytotoxicity against repair proficient tumor cells.', 'Hypoxia-selective O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase inhibitors: design, synthesis, and evaluation of 6-(benzyloxy)-2-(aryldiazenyl)-9H-purines as prodrugs of O6-benzylguanine.', 'Design of a hypoxia-activated prodrug inhibitor of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase.']"""

Normal variations within the sequence of apoptotic genes may lead to suboptimal apoptotic capacity and therefore increased cancer risk.

Methods:   To identify genes targeted by miR-133a, an oligo-microarray analysis was performed using the miR-133a-transfected BC cell lines. For gain/loss-of-function studies, miR-133a/si-glutathione S-transferase π1 (GSTP1)-transfectants were subjected to XTT assay and flow cytometry to evaluate their cell viability and apoptosis status.

Results:   MiR-133a transfection induced cell viability inhibition and apoptosis in BC cell lines. We focused on the GSTP1 gene that was the top 7 down-regulated one in the gene profile from the miR-133a-transfectants.

With this in mind, we aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of perianal-intrarectal (PI) lidocaine gel, lidocaine-ketorolac gel, and lidocaine-prilocaine cream in relieving pain during TPB.  Materials and methods:   Three hundred consecutive patients scheduled for US-guided TPB were randomized 1:1:1 to receive PI administration of 5 g 2.5% lidocaine gel 10 minutes before TPB (Group 1), or a mixture of 5 g 2.5% lidocaine gel and 0.3% ketorolac tromethamine solution 1 hour before TPB (Group 2), or 5 g 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine cream 20 minutes before TPB (Group 3). The 0-to-10 points visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for assessing pain at probe insertion and movements (VAS-1), at prostate sampling (VAS-2), and maximal procedural pain (MPP). Complications occurring up to 20 days after the procedure were also recorded.  Results:   Four (1.3%) patients were excluded because of unbearable pain during the procedure, leaving Group 1 with 98 patients, Group 2 with 99, and Group 3 with 99; the 3 groups were comparable for patients' age, serum PSA, prostate volume, and cancer detection rate. The addition of either ketorolac or prilocaine to lidocaine significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced probe-related, sampling-related, and maximal procedural pain. Compared with lidocaine-prilocaine, lidocaine-ketorolac was less effective in relieving probe-related pain (mean VAS-1: 1.47 ± 1.30 vs. 0.39 ± 0.65; P < 0.0001) but more effective in relieving sampling-related pain (mean VAS-2: 0.76 ± 0.94 vs. 1.54 ± 1.02; P < 0.0001); there was no difference in MPP (mean 1.82 ± 1.21 vs. 1.67 ± 0.95), probably due to such different efficacy on the two pain sources. Complications were similar in the 3 groups.  Conclusions:   Lidocaine-prilocaine cream was most effective on probe-related pain, whereas lidocaine-ketorolac gel was most effective on sampling-related pain. These noninfiltrative anesthetics were safe, easy to administer, and well accepted by patients; the possibility to combine them to further improve pain control during TPB deserves further well-designed studies.""","""['Luigi Cormio', 'Fabrizio Lorusso', 'Oscar Selvaggio', 'Antonia Perrone', 'Francesca Sanguedolce', 'Vincenzo Pagliarulo', 'Pantaleo Bufo', 'Giuseppe Carrieri']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Combined perianal-intrarectal (PI) lidocaine-prilocaine (LP) cream and lidocaine-ketorolac gel provide better pain relief than combined PI LP cream and periprostatic nerve block during transrectal prostate biopsy.', 'Combination of perianal-intrarectal lidocaine-prilocaine cream and periprostatic nerve block for pain control during transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy: a randomized, controlled trial.', 'A prospective randomized trial comparing three different analgesic techniques for pain control during transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy: a single center experience.', 'Addition of intrarectal local analgesia to periprostatic nerve block improves pain control for transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Tolerance of local anesthetic for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: our experience and a literature review.', 'Foggia Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator 2.0: A Novel Risk Calculator including MRI and Bladder Outlet Obstruction Parameters to Reduce Unnecessary Biopsies.', 'Bioptic prostatic inflammation correlates with false positive rates of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Prospective Validation of Pentraxin-3 as a Novel Serum Biomarker to Predict the Risk of Prostate Cancer in Patients Scheduled for Prostate Biopsy.', 'Does Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance of Prostate Outperform Risk Calculators in Predicting Prostate Cancer in Biopsy Naïve Patients?', 'Efficacy and safety of a combined anesthetic technique for transrectal prostate biopsy: a single center, prospective, randomized study.']"""

The differences in study outcomes may be a result of using body mass index (BMI) rather then direct anthropometric measurements of fat distribution. To investigate these differences, we used endorectal coil MRI (eMRI) data to directly measure fat thicknesses in obese men who underwent RRP.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis on an RRP database of 1,987 men with available BMI, clinicopathologic characteristics, and biochemical follow-up. Obese men (BMI ≥ 30) were compared with normal weight men (BMI ≤ 25) and overweight men (BMI > 25, < 30) for clinical and pathologic differences and biochemical failure. The eMRI data for 143 obese men were reviewed and the fat thicknesses in the anterior, posterior, and total anteroposterior abdominal diameters were measured and averaged in 3 separate images at and around the midline in the widest segment of the sagittal T2 weighted localizing scans.  Results:   Kaplan Meyer curves with log rank analysis revealed a significant difference in biochemical free survival in lean men and overweight men compared with obese men (P = 0.016, P = 0.021). A BMI ≥ 30 did not predict time to biochemical failure on multivariate analysis (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67-1.56, P = 0.29). The anterior fat thickness on eMRI in obese men with biochemical failure (n = 21) was significantly smaller than obese men without biochemical failure (n = 122) (35 mm vs. 44 mm, P = 0.003). Calculated percent visceral fat thickness was also significantly larger in obese men with biochemical failure (74% vs.71%, P = 0.02). Subset analysis on patients with extracapsular extension and higher pathologic Gleason scores revealed similar trends in anterior and percent visceral fat thicknesses (P = 0.003, P = 0.02).  Conclusion:   Difference in fat distribution may help account for some of the controversy surrounding obesity and prostate cancer.

We aimed to investigate the role of polymorphisms in 10 candidate genes with a key function in apoptosis.  Methods and materials:   Eight coding SNPs were chosen in ATM (Ser49Cys), BID (Ser56Cys), CASP8 (Asp302His), CASP10 (Val410Ile), LGALS3 (Pro64His), RASSF1 (Ser133Ala), TP53 (Arg72Pro), and TP53AIP1 (Ala7Val), and two non-coding SNPs were selected in BCL2 (-938C/A) and HDM2 (SNP309). A hospital-based case-control series of 510 prostate cancer patients and 490 healthy males from Northern Germany were genotyped for these polymorphisms.  Results:   SNP rs4644 in LGALS3 showed evidence for a protective effect of the minor allele, encoding the His64 variant (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69;0.99, P = 0.04). Carriers were underrepresented among cases under a dominant model (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.54;0.92; P = 0.01), and the effect appeared more pronounced in patients diagnosed before the age of 60 years (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31;0.85, P = 0.01). The other nine polymorphisms did not vary significantly between cases and controls, though subtle trends were noted for BCL2 (P = 0.07) and CASP10 (P = 0.08). The Asp302His variant of CASP8 tended to associate with a protective effect in the group with higher Gleason score under a dominant model (P = 0.03). Carriers of either the CASP8 or the CASP10 variants were underrepresented in the prostate cancer series (P = 0.02).

Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for receiving prostate cancer active therapy.  Results:   The majority of men aged≥75 years were treated with prostate cancer active therapy (81.7%), which varied by disease risk level: low, 72.2%; intermediate, 83.7%; and high, 86.4%.

This results in many patients being exposed to potentially unnecessary invasive treatment and its associated morbidities. In order to develop appropriate treatment strategies, it is essential to understand the differences between patients who will develop aggressive disease and those who will not.  Methods:   A longitudinal study was conducted in men with localised PCa on active surveillance for their disease in which 140 subjects were followed every 3 months for up to 5 years. Change in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) over time (PSA velocity) was used as a marker for PCa progression. Subjects were categorised as slow, intermediate and fast progressors based on tertiles of PSA velocity. Differences in baseline markers were investigated using logistic regressions. Two approaches were used, slow progressors were compared with fast progressors (model 1) and slow progressors were compared with combination of intermediate and fast progressors (model 2).  Results:   Aspirin was negatively associated with high PSA velocity in model 1 (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.24 (0.06, 0.94), P-value = 0.04) and model 2 (odds ratio = 0.22 (0.08, 0.59), P-value = 0.003), whereas smoking was positively associated with high PSA velocity in model 1 (1.03 (0.92, 1.13), P-value = 0.01).

We investigated whether KMKKT alleviated cancer chemotherapy drug-induced leukopenia and other hematotoxicity in vivo using a mouse model. KMKKT was given once daily orally for 10 days to the mice before they were given cyclophosphamide (CPA) daily injection for 4 days. KMKKT blunted CPA-induced decrease in red blood cells, hemoglobin content, and the total white blood cell/leukocyte counts. Examination of the multiple organ sites involved in hematopoiesis, and lymphocyte differentiation and maturation showed the attenuated changes induced by CPA in each and every type of cells examined. Particularly, some of the cell types are fully restored in the bone marrow and even overstimulated in the Sca-1(+), CD117(+), or Sca1(+)/CD117(+) and CD34(+)/CD117(+) stem cells, supporting a role of KMKKT to stimulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) signaling to compensate for CPA-induced destruction of leukocytes and other cell types.

We evaluate cytokine secretion at the single-cell level using ELISpot in relation to DLI effect on disease response.  Patients & methods:   Blood samples were collected from four patients with solid tumors and four with hematological malignancies before DLI, and 1 and 3 weeks after DLI. Tumor response was evaluated according to the international Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) method. Indications for DLI were stable disease or MC and/or progressive disease in solid tumors, and molecular or early relapse, or MC in hematological malignancies. ELISpot was performed for TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 cytokines.  Results:   Depending on the disease response, patients were divided into two groups: responders and nonresponders. Responders were patients who achieved partial response (one renal cell cancer) or stable disease (one prostate cancer) or clinical remission (two acute myeloid leukemia). Patients who relapsed, progressed or rejected the graft were the nonresponders. DLI rescued the renal cell cancer patient, who has partial response, and two acute myeloid leukemia patients, who are in clinical remission. Patients who responded tended to have a higher expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-10 than those who did not respond.

Methods:   We analyzed data from the 2007-2008 National Survey of Primary Care Physician Practices Regarding Prostate Cancer Screening (N = 1,256), the most recent and comprehensive survey specifically designed to address issues concerning prostate cancer screening and representing nearly 95,000 PCPs. We evaluated the relationship between PCP behavior regarding prostate cancer screening discussions and covariates, including PCP demographic and practice-related factors. Weighted percentages and Chi-square tests were used to compare use of screening discussions by PCP characteristics. Adjusted odds of discussing screening and recommending the PSA test were determined from logistic regression.  Results:   Eighty percent of PCPs reported that they routinely discuss prostate cancer screening with all of their male patients, and 64.1% of PCPs who discussed screening with any patients reported that they attempted to talk their patients into getting the PSA test. In multivariate analyses, encouraging PSA testing was more likely among non-Hispanic black PCPs (OR = 2.80, 95% CI [1.88, 4.16]), PCPs serving 100 or more patients per week (OR = 2.16, 95% CI [1.38, 3.37]), and PCPs spending longer hours per week in direct patient care (31-40 hours: OR = 1.90, 95% CI [1.13, 3.20]; 41 or more hours: OR = 2.09, 95% CI [1.12, 3.88]), compared to their referents.

Patients and methods:   Records of consecutive prostate cancer patients with coexisting diabetes mellitus type 2 who were treated at the study institution between 15 July 1999 and 31 December 2008 were reviewed. The survival, cancer pathological grade, stage at the time of diagnosis, and antidiabetic pharmacotherapy of the patients were analyzed.  Results:   A total of 233 consecutive cases were analyzed. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, thiazolidinedione (log-rank, P = 0.005) and metformin (log-rank, P = 0.035) usage were significant predictors of improved overall survival, while insulin and insulin secretagogue usage were not significant predictors.

We further investigated SOX2's function in cell growth and apoptosis process by using a human prostate cancer cell line DU145 with SOX2 overexpression or down-regulation. Cell cycle assay revealed that SOX2 promoted cell growth and increased the percentage of cells in S phase. In vitro and in vivo xenograft experiments in NOD/SCID mice further demonstrated that SOX2 increased the apoptosis-resistant properties of DU145 cells with decreased function of store-operated Ca(2+) entry and reduced expression of Orai1 at both mRNA and protein levels, suggesting a potential mechanism that contributes to the anti-apoptotic property of SOX2. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate SOX2's function in tumorigenesis and apoptosis of human prostate cancer and to elucidate its regulatory effect on the activity of store-operated Ca(2+) channels.

Although many methods exist for extracting these sub-networks, very few existing approaches simultaneously consider both the differential expression of individual genes and the differential correlation of gene pairs, losing potentially valuable information in the data.  Results:   In this article, we propose a new method, COSINE (COndition SpecIfic sub-NEtwork), which employs a scoring function that jointly measures the condition-specific changes of both 'nodes' (individual genes) and 'edges' (gene-gene co-expression). It uses the genetic algorithm to search for the single optimal sub-network which maximizes the scoring function. We applied COSINE to both simulated datasets with various differential expression patterns, and three real datasets, one prostate cancer dataset, a second one from the across-tissue comparison of morbidly obese patients and the other from the across-population comparison of the HapMap samples. Compared with previous methods, COSINE is more powerful in identifying truly significant sub-networks of appropriate size and meaningful biological relevance.

The other case involved a 60-year-old patient with pT2c prostatic adenocarcinoma (Gleason pattern 4+3; total score, 7; with focal Gleason pattern 5). Representative sections of the left seminal vesicles from both patients demonstrated a portion of urothelial epithelium consisting of 3 to 8 cell layers, which included superficial (umbrella), intermediate, and basal cells. An abrupt transition from the normal single layer of cuboidal cells of seminal vesicle to multilayered urothelium was identified in 1 case, and circumferential urothelium was identified in the other case. No urothelial metaplasia was seen in the prostatic tissue. The histogenesis of urothelial metaplasia in the seminal vesicle is unclear, but it possibly is a reaction to mechanical irritation, inflammation, or infection, as has been proposed for urothelial metaplasia in the fallopian tube and squamous metaplasia of the pelvic peritoneum. Nevertheless, a rare congenital malformation cannot be ruled out as an etiology.

Materials and methods:   Fresh frozen benign and malignant prostatic tissue was obtained from radical prostatectomy specimens in 49 men with pathologic stage pT2a prostate cancer. Histopathologic examination confirmed that all tissues from each prostate being analyzed were either completely benign or almost totally malignant. The PUFA composition in these tissues was determined by gas-liquid chromatography on a capillary column. The relative amount of each PUFA (% of total fatty acids) was quantified by integrating the area under the peak and dividing the result by the total area of all fatty acids.  Results:   Tissue levels of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, (C20:3w6), an ω-6 PUFA and a major precursor of ω-6 PUFA metabolites, were significantly higher in malignant compared with benign tissues (P = 0.002). Tissue levels of the downstream ω-6 metabolites, arachidonic acid (AA) (20:4ω6), and adrenic acid, (22:4ω6), were significantly lower in cancer tissues, (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.013, respectively). Overall, the total levels of ω-6 PUFA were lower in cancer (P = 0.001).

We performed the trial using the Cox model (univariate and multivariate) and using the Student's t-test to compare averages.  Results:   With a mean follow-up of 4 (±3 DE) years, the univariate study showed a mean until progression for the Gleason score 2-6 in the biopsy of 824 days and 543 for the Gleason score 7-10 (p=0.003).

Although other major causes of death have been on the decrease, deaths because of AD have been rising dramatically. Between 2000 and 2008 (preliminary data), heart disease deaths decreased by 13%, stroke deaths by 20%, and prostate cancer-related deaths by 8%, whereas deaths because of AD increased by 66%. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have AD; approximately 200,000 people aged <65 years with AD comprise the younger-onset AD population. Every 69 seconds, someone in America develops AD; by 2050, the time is expected to accelerate to every 33 seconds. Over the coming decades, the baby boom population is projected to add 10 million people to these numbers. In 2050, the incidence of AD is expected to approach nearly a million people per year, with a total estimated prevalence of 11 to 16 million people. Dramatic increases in the numbers of ""oldest-old"" (those aged ≥85 years) across all racial and ethnic groups will also significantly affect the numbers of people living with AD. In 2010, nearly 15 million family and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $202 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries aged ≥65 years with AD and other dementias are almost 3 times higher than for beneficiaries without these conditions. Total payments in 2011 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people aged ≥65years with AD and other dementias are expected to be $183 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). This report provides information to increase understanding of the public health effect of AD, including incidence and prevalence, mortality, health expenditures and costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society in general.

Methods and materials:   We used 883 analyzable prostate cancer patients who enrolled on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 94-06, a Phase I/II dose escalation trial, and whose mean planning target volume dose exceeded 73.8 Gy (mean, 78.5 Gy; maximum, 84.3 Gy). We defined biochemical failure according to the Phoenix definition.  Results:   A total of 259 men started HT 2 to 3 months before HDRT, but not longer than 6 months, and 66 men with high-risk prostate cancer received HT for a longer duration. At 5 years, the biochemical failure rates after HDRT alone were 12%, 18%, and 29% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively (p < 0.0001). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for covariates revealed that pretreatment PSA level was a significant factor, whereas risk group, Gleason score, T-stage, and age were not. When the patients were stratified by risk groups, the Cox proportion hazards regression model (after adjusting for pretreatment PSA, biopsy Gleason score, and T stage) did not reveal a significant effect on bNED or DFS by adding HT to HDRT CONCLUSION: The addition of HT did not significantly improve bNED survival or DFS in all prostate cancer patients receiving HDRT, but did approach significance in high-risk patient subgroup.

To evaluate the risk of XMRV infection during blood transfusion in Japan, we screened three populations--healthy donors (n = 500), patients with PC (n = 67), and patients with CFS (n = 100)--for antibodies against XMRV proteins in freshly collected blood samples. We also examined blood samples of viral antibody-positive patients with PC and all (both antibody-positive and antibody-negative) patients with CFS for XMRV DNA.  Results:   Antibody screening by immunoblot analysis showed that a fraction of the cases (1.6-3.0%) possessed anti-Gag antibodies regardless of their gender or disease condition. Most of these antibodies were highly specific to XMRV Gag capsid protein, but none of the individuals in the three tested populations retained strong antibody responses to multiple XMRV proteins. In the viral antibody-positive PC patients, we occasionally detected XMRV genes in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells but failed to isolate an infectious or full-length XMRV. Further, all CFS patients tested negative for XMRV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Conclusion:   Our data show no solid evidence of XMRV infection in any of the three populations tested, implying that there is no association between the onset of PC or CFS and XMRV infection in Japan.

As zibotentan is eliminated by renal and metabolic routes, clearance may be reduced in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, leading to greater drug exposure.  Methods:   Open-label studies investigated the PK and tolerability of zibotentan in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment, compared with those with normal organ function. In the hepatic and renal studies, respectively, subjects were divided into categories using Child-Pugh classification or 24-hour urine creatinine clearance (mild, moderate, or severe impairment and normal function). Each subject received a single oral dose of zibotentan 10 mg and PK sampling was undertaken. Within the hepatic study, AUC and Cmax were expressed as the ratio of geometric means and 90% CI for each impairment group compared with the normal function group. The possibility that hepatic impairment had a clinically relevant effect on exposure was considered if the upper 90% CI for the ratio exceeded 2. In the renal study, AUC, Cmax and t1/2 were analyzed using linear regression fitting effects for creatinine clearance and age.  Results:   In the hepatic and renal studies respectively, 32 subjects (eight per group) and 48 subjects received treatment (n = 18 normal, n = 12 mild, n = 9 moderate, n = 9 severe). Zibotentan Cmax was not significantly affected by hepatic or renal impairment. Compared with the normal function group, zibotentan AUC was 40% (1.40; 90% CI 0.91-2.17), 45% (1.45; 90% CI 0.94-2.24) and 190% (2.90; 90% CI 1.88-4.49) higher in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, and 66% (1.66; 90% CI 1.38-1.99), 89% (1.89; 90% CI 1.50-2.39) and 117% (2.17; 90% CI 1.64-2.86) higher in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. In both studies mean t1/2 increased and zibotentan clearance decreased with the degree of impairment. Headache was the most common AE in all groups.  Conclusions:   Zibotentan absorption was unchanged, however, exposure was higher in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment due to slower clearance.

Methods:   Patients diagnosed with a Stage IV solid tumor were identified from the hospital's cancer registry. Using data abstracted from medical records, care was assessed using 41 explicit QIs. Mean percent adherence to QIs was calculated overall, as well as across five clinical domains: (1) Pain, (2) Depression and Psychosocial Distress, (3) Dyspnea, (4) Treatment Toxicity, (5) Other Symptoms, and (6) Information and Care Planning.  Results:   The study cohort (n = 118) was almost all male (2% female) and mean age was 65.9 years (standard deviation [SD] 9.9 years). The most common cancers were lung and head and neck cancer (23% each); 17% had prostate cancer; 13% had colorectal cancer; and the rest (24%) had breast, esophageal, stomach, genitourinary, liver/biliary, or pancreas cancer. Patients received 51% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48%-54%) of recommended care. Adherence to recommended care within domains ranged from 38% (95% CI 35%-42%) for Other Symptoms to 79% (95% CI 73%-86%) for Information and Care Planning.

The ideal diagnostic test would provide rapid, non-invasive diagnosis at the point of care with high throughput and without prior tissue processing. Over the past decade vibrational spectroscopy techniques have demonstrated their ability to provide non-destructive, rapid, clinically relevant diagnostic information. Biochemical fingerprints of tissues measured using Raman and infrared spectroscopy analysed in conjunction with advanced chemometrics have shown great potential in the diagnostic assessment of biological material. Development of Raman probes is enabling the potential of in vivo clinical measurements to be realised. A novel probe design has been evaluated in clinical studies to identify and classify the subtle pre-malignant biochemical changes related to the carcinogenesis process. Exciting recent developments have enabled the probing of tissue samples at depth with huge potential for breast and prostate cancer diagnostics. Furthermore, the potential of vibrational spectroscopy to provide prognostic information is tantalising. Raman spectral data acquired on oesophageal biopsy samples analysed in conjunction with patient outcome data has shown the power of spectral biomolecular fingerprinting in predicting the outcome of patients with high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's oesophagus. Raman mapping can also be used to analyse thin tissue sections on calcium fluoride slides enabling the distribution of tissue constituents to be realised. The spectral data acquired effectively enables multiplexing of digital tissue stains since a whole array of information is gathered simultaneously.

DESI is an ambient ionization method that can be performed on untreated histological sections of biological tissue in the open lab environment to image lipids, fatty acids, hormones and other compounds. Paper spray is performed in the open lab too; it involves electrospraying dry blood spots or biofluid deposits from a porous medium. PS is characterized by extreme simplicity and speed: a spot of whole blood or other biofluid is analyzed directly from paper, simply by applying a high voltage to the moist paper. Both methods are being developed for use in diagnostics as a means to inform therapy. DESI imaging is applied to create molecular maps of tissue sections without prior labeling or other sample preparation. Like other methods of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), it combines the chemical speciation of multiple analytes with information on spatial distributions. DESI imaging provides valuable information which correlates with the disease state of tissue as determined by standard histochemical methods. Positive-ion data are presented which complement previously reported negative-ion data on paired human bladder cancerous and adjacent normal tissue sections from 20 patients. These data add to the evidence already in the literature demonstrating that differences in the distributions of particular lipids contain disease-diagnostic information. Multivariate statistical analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) is used to analyze the imaging MS data, and so confirm differences between the lipid profiles of diseased and healthy tissue types. As more such data is acquired, DESI imaging has the potential to be a diagnostic tool for future cancer detection in situ; this suggests a potential role in guiding therapy in parallel with standard histochemical and immunohistological methods. The PS methodology is aimed at high-throughput clinical measurement of quantitative levels of particular therapeutic agents in blood and other biofluids. The experiment allows individual drugs to be quantified at therapeutic levels and data is presented showing quantitative drug analysis from mixtures of therapeutic drugs in whole blood. Data on cholesterol sulfate, a new possible prostate biomarker seen at elevated levels in diseased prostate tissue, but not in healthy prostate tissue in serum are reported using paper spray ionization.""","""['R Graham Cooks', 'Nicholas E Manicke', 'Allison L Dill', 'Demian R Ifa', 'Livia S Eberlin', 'Anthony B Costa', 'He Wang', 'Guangming Huang', 'Zheng Ouyang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Faraday Discuss""","""['Ambient ionization mass spectrometric analysis of human surgical specimens to distinguish renal cell carcinoma from healthy renal tissue.', 'Ambient Lipidomic Analysis of Single Mammalian Oocytes and Preimplantation Embryos Using Desorption Electrospray Ionization (DESI) Mass Spectrometry.', 'Enhanced capabilities for imaging gangliosides in murine brain with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled to ion mobility separation.', 'Surface analysis of lipids by mass spectrometry: more than just imaging.', 'Chemical aspects of the extractive methods of ambient ionization mass spectrometry.', 'Desorption electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization as imaging approaches for biological samples analysis.', 'Spectrochemical approach combined with symptoms data to diagnose fibromyalgia through paper spray ionization mass spectrometry (PSI-MS) and multivariate classification.', 'The application of mass spectrometry imaging in traditional Chinese medicine: a review.', 'Multivariate classification techniques and mass spectrometry as a tool in the screening of patients with fibromyalgia.', 'Applications and continued evolution of glycan imaging mass spectrometry.']"""

Pelvic external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is known to increase the risk of hip fractures in women, but the effect in men is unknown.  Methods:   From the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, 45,662 men who were aged ≥66 years and diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1992-2004 were identified. By using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards models, the primary outcome of hip fracture risk was compared among men who received radical prostatectomy (RP), EBRT, EBRT plus androgen suppression therapy (AST), or AST alone. Age, osteoporosis, race, and other comorbidities were statistically controlled. A secondary outcome was distal forearm fracture as an indicator of the risk of fall-related fracture outside the radiation field.  Results:   After covariates were statistically controlled, the findings showed that EBRT increased the risk of hip fractures by 76% (hazards ratio [HR], 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-2.40) without increasing the risk of distal forearm fractures (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56-1.14). Combination therapy with EBRT plus AST increased the risk of hip fracture 145% relative to RP alone (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.88-3.19) and by 40% relative to EBRT alone (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.17-1.68). EBRT plus AST increased the risk of distal forearm fracture by 43% relative to RP alone (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.97-2.10). The number needed to treat to result in 1 hip fracture during a 10-year period was 51 patients (95% CI, 31-103).  Conclusions:   In men with prostate cancer, pelvic 3-D conformal EBRT was associated with a 76% increased risk of hip fracture. This risk was slightly increased further by the addition of short-course AST to EBRT.

It is not clear how the shift from open radical prostatectomy (ORP) to minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP) has affected the use of PLND. The objectives of this study were to identify predictors of PLND and to assess the impact of surgical technique in a contemporary, population-based cohort.  Methods:   In Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data linked with Medicare claims, the authors identified men who underwent ORP or MIRP for prostate cancer during 2003 to 2007. The impact of surgical approach on PLND was evaluated, and interactions were examined between surgical procedure, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and Gleason score with the analysis controlled for patient and tumor characteristics.  Results:   Of 6608 men who underwent ORP or MIRP, 70% (n = 4600) underwent PLND. The use of PLND declined over time both overall and within subgroups defined by procedure type. PLND was 5 times more likely in men who underwent ORP than in men who underwent MIRP when the analysis was controlled for patient and tumor characteristics. Elevated PSA and biopsy Gleason score, but not clinical stage, were associated with a greater odds of PLND in both the ORP group and the MIRP group. However, the magnitude of the association between these factors and PLND was significantly greater for patients in the ORP group.  Conclusions:   PLND was less common among men who underwent MIRP, independent of tumor risk factors. A decline in PLND rates was not fully explained by an increase in MIRP. The authors concluded that these trends may signal a surgical approach-dependent disparity in prostate cancer staging and therapy.""","""['Andrew H Feifer', 'Elena B Elkin', 'William T Lowrance', 'Brian Denton', 'Lindsay Jacks', 'David S Yee', 'Jonathan A Coleman', 'Vincent P Laudone', 'Peter T Scardino', 'James A Eastham']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Variations in surgeon volume and use of pelvic lymph node dissection with open and minimally invasive radical prostatectomy.', 'Adherence of the indication to European Association of Urology guideline recommended pelvic lymph node dissection at a high-volume center: Differences between open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The impact of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy on the use and extent of pelvic lymph node dissection in the ""post-dissemination"" period.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', ""Prevalence of High-Risk Prostate Cancer Metastasis to Cloquet's Ilioinguinal Lymph Node."", 'External Validation of the Briganti Nomogram to Predict Lymph Node Invasion in Prostate Cancer-Setting a New Threshold Value.', 'Risk Factors for Pathologically Confirmed Lymph Nodes Metastasis in Patients With Clinical T2N0M0 Stage Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate specific antigen (PSA) persistence 6 weeks after radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection as predictive factor of radiographic progression in node-positive prostate cancer patients.', 'The Role of Provider Characteristics in the Selection of Surgery or Radiation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Association With Quality of Care Indicators.']"""

Materials and methods:   Fifty patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer underwent a combined endorectal-body-phased array magnetic resonance imaging examination at a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The DWI was performed using b values of 50, 400, 800 s/mm. The prostate was divided into sextants, including the apex, the middle aspect, and the base for the left and right sides, separately. Regions of interest were placed in the peripheral zone of each sextant to evaluate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The results of the DWI were compared side by side with the findings of the histological examination of endorectal sonographically guided sextant biopsy. The sensitivity and specificity of ADC for the identification of the tumor tissue were computed for variable discrimination thresholds to evaluate its receiver operating characteristic. An association between ADC and Gleason score was tested for both the whole study group and on an individual basis using the nonparametric Spearman ρ test and the Pearson correlation, respectively.  Results:   Histopathology identified tumor tissue in 21 (42%) of the 50 patients. The ADC value was 1.65 ± 0.32 mm/s 10 in normal tissue and 0.96 ± 0.24 mm/s 10 in tumor tissue (mean ± 1 SD). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.966. Using the discrimination threshold 1.21 mm/s 10, for example, the ADC value provided a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.93. There was a highly significant negative correlation between the ADC value and the Gleason score in the tumor-positive tissue probes (n = 62, ρ = -0.405, P = 0.001) in the whole study group. On the individual patient basis, the Pearson correlation revealed a mean coefficient of r = -0.89 (SD ± 0.12) with a P < 0.001.  Conclusions:   Diffusion-weighted imaging of the prostate can be used to differentiate benign from malignant tissue in the peripheral zone.

The present study systematically investigates the role of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family proteins in the regulation of DATS-induced apoptosis using cultured PC-3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells and dorsolateral prostate from control and DATS-treated transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. Level of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) protein was decreased on 8-hour treatment with 20 and 40 μmol/L DATS, but this effect was partially attenuated at the 16-hour time point. DATS-mediated decline in XIAP protein level was partially reversible in the presence of proteasomal inhibitor MG132. In contrast, DATS-treated PC-3 and LNCaP cells exhibited marked induction of survivin and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) proteins. Induction of survivin protein expression resulting from DATS exposure was associated with an increase in its mRNA level. Dorsolateral prostates from DATS-treated TRAMP mice exhibited statistically significant downregulation of XIAP and induction of survivin protein compared with those of control mice. Ectopic expression of XIAP conferred partial but significant protection against DATS-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, DATS-induced apoptosis was only marginally affected by RNA interference of survivin or cIAP1. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the DATS-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is mediated in part by suppression of XIAP protein expression, and that XIAP represents a viable biomarker of DATS response for future clinical investigations.""","""['Su-Hyeong Kim', 'Ajay Bommareddy', 'Shivendra V Singh']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Diallyl trisulfide, a constituent of processed garlic, inactivates Akt to trigger mitochondrial translocation of BAD and caspase-mediated apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Diallyl trisulfide inhibits activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in prostate cancer cells in culture and in vivo.', 'Diallyl trisulfide suppresses growth of PC-3 human prostate cancer xenograft in vivo in association with Bax and Bak induction.', 'Anticancer effects of diallyl trisulfide derived from garlic.', 'Molecular mechanisms and targets of cancer chemoprevention by garlic-derived bioactive compound diallyl trisulfide.', 'Diallyl trisulfide alleviates chemotherapy sensitivity of ovarian cancer via the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1α pathway.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Research Progress in Liver-Regenerating Microenvironment and DNA Methylation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Role of Traditional Chinese Medicine.', 'Prostate Cancer Disparity, Chemoprevention, and Treatment by Specific Medicinal Plants.', 'Antioxidant Activity of Spices and Their Impact on Human Health: A Review.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective cohort study of 300 patients who had undergone radical retropubic prostatectomy from 1993 to 1995 was performed. The role of margin status and the length of the PSM in the progression to BCF was defined after controlling for the preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, tumor stage, tumor volume, seminal vesical invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion using a multivariate regression model. The median follow-up time was 12 years.  Results:   The presence of PSMs correlated with a shorter time to BCF in men with Stage pT2 disease (P<.0001) but not in men with Stage pT3 disease (P=.66). Of the patients with Stage pT2 disease and PSMs, the PSM length did not correlate with progression to BCF. PSMs predicted a shorter time to progression to BCF in patients with high- and low-volume pT2 disease (P=.0261 and P=.0003, respectively). Only PSMs predicted a shorter time to BCF on multivariate analysis in patients with Stage pT2 cancer (hazard ratio 2.33, 95% confidence interval 1.495-3.723). In patients with Stage pT3 disease, PSMs were not associated with an increased risk of BCF (hazard ratio 0.747, 95% confidence interval 0.328-1.703).  Conclusions:   Surgical margin status did not affect the risk of BCF in patients with Stage pT3a disease; however, it did affect patients with Stage pT2 disease, irrespective of PSM length or disease volume.

Thiazolidenediones (TZDs) are synthetic ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and previous studies have shown that TZDs induce apoptosis of prostate cancer cells independently of PPARγ activation. However, the exact mechanism of these effects remains unknown. Our objective was to investigate the effects of TZDs on apoptosis and on the serine/threonine kinase pathway, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β).  Methods:   LNCaP cells, a type of prostate cancer cells (derived from left supraclavicular lymph node of human prostrate carcinoma), were cultured in DMEM medium, and cell viability was evaluated with a colorimetric assay using MTT level. The total and phosphorylated protein level of Akt and GSK3β were detected by Western blotting.  Results and discussion:   The apoptosis-inducing effect of TZDs on prostate cancer cells involves the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, TZDs induce inactivation of GSK3β, a multifunctional kinase that mediates essential events promoting prostate cancer development and acquisition of androgen independence. In addition, the GSK3β inhibitor lithium chloride sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TZDs cytotoxicity.  What is new and conclusion:   Our data suggest that modulation of Akt-GSK3β pathway is involved in the cell death pathway engaged by TZDs in prostate cancer cells. This reveals another possible mechanism of TZDs on apoptosis in prostate cancer.

This study examined if thapsigargin altered basal [Ca²⁺](i) levels in suspended PC3 human prostate cancer cells by using fura-2 as a Ca²⁺-sensitive fluorescent probe. Thapsigargin at concentrations between 10 nM and 10 µM increased [Ca²⁺](i) in a concentration-dependent fashion. The Ca²⁺ signal was reduced partly by removing extracellular Ca²⁺ indicating that Ca²⁺ entry and release both contributed to the [Ca²⁺](i) rise. This Ca²⁺ influx was inhibited by suppression of phospholipase A2, but not by inhibition of store-operated Ca²⁺ channels or by modulation of protein kinase C activity. In Ca²⁺-free medium, pretreatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ pump inhibitor 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (BHQ) nearly abolished thapsigargin-induced Ca²⁺ release. Conversely, pretreatment with thapsigargin greatly reduced BHQ-induced [Ca²⁺](i) rise, suggesting that thapsigargin released Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum. Inhibition of phospholipase C did not change thapsigargin-induced [Ca²⁺](i) rise. At concentrations of 1-10 µM, thapsigargin induced cell death that was partly reversed by chelation of Ca²⁺ with BAPTA/AM. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining data suggest that apoptosis was partly responsible for thapsigargin-induced cell death. Together, in PC3 human prostate cancer cells, thapsigargin induced [Ca²⁺](i) rises by causing phospholipase C-independent Ca²⁺ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca²⁺ influx via phospholipase A2-sensitive Ca²⁺ channels.

Currently, 10 area urologists perform RARP, and robotic training has become an important component of the residency. We present data describing the timeline for adoption, both in clinical practice and in the residency program.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the operating logs for all surgeons who were performing prostatectomies in all hospitals in Rochester, NY, from 2003 to 2007. We examined the influence RARP had on other treatments, including brachytherapy and cryotherapy. Surgical logs of graduating chief residents were also reviewed.  Results:   Eleven surgeons in Rochester regularly perform radical prostatectomy (10 perform primarily RARP, one performs only open prostatectomy). Three of the city's four hospitals have robotic systems. In 2003-2004, there were 30 open prostatectomies performed monthly and fewer than 10 performed robotically. By 2006, the trend was reversed, with 50 robot-assisted prostatectomies performed each month and fewer than 10 open prostatectomies (P<0.05). The rate of brachytherapy fluctuated, increasing in centers without a robot. The number of open prostatectomies in centers without a robot dropped significantly to fewer than 10 cases per year. There was also a significant decrease in the number of open prostatectomies performed by chief residents.  Conclusions:   Since the introduction of surgical robotics, significant changes have been seen. The volume of radical prostatectomies performed by surgeons at institutions with robotics has increased; the volume at robot-free institutions has become nominal. There is a trend toward increased radiation therapy at robot-free institutions.

However, the additional expenditure and increased morbidity of ePLND has led to a limitation of the PLND area and so to a reduced detection of metastases in many clinics. The SLNE offers the advantage of selective removal of sentinel LN. Therefore, we have compared the complications of SLNE and other different PLND techniques.  Materials and methods:   Patients with prostate cancer who had received an open PLND (PLND: n = 90, PLND + radical retropubic prostatectomy: n = 409) were assessed. The complications of three PLND techniques were compared: group 1 (n = 216): SLNE, group 2 (n = 117): SLNE + modified (m) PLND (fossa obturatoria- und Iliaca-externa-region), group 3 (n = 163): SLNE + ePLND (fossa obturatoria- + Iliaca-externa- + Iliaca-interna-region). The complications were evaluated with special reference to the PLND-induced morbidity (e. g., lymphoceles).  Results:   In SLNE the total complications were low-er than in the two more extended PLND variants. The lymphatic complications (11.2 %) were significant (χ (2) = 8.616, p = 0.013) lower than in SLNE + mPLND (21.2 %) and SLNE + ePLND (22.0 %). With an increasing number of dissected LN the complication rate increased significantly. If ≥ 15 LN have been removed total and lymphatic complications increased significantly (χ (2) = 11.578, p = 0.021; χ (2) = 12.271, p = 0.015).  Conclusions:   In PLND the lymphatic complications increase significantly with the number of dissected LN. The SLNE has, in spite of the dissection of LN in difficultly accessible regions (presacral, iliaca-interna-region), a low complication rate. As a method with a small number of LN to be removed, the SLNE offers a good compromise between high sensitivity and low morbidity and is therefore preferable to the more extended PLND variants.""","""['A Winter', 'C Vogt', 'D Weckermann', 'F Wawroschek']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: high incidence of lymph node metastasis.', 'Algorithm for selecting men for pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) during radical prostatectomy based on clinical risk factors in an Australian population.', 'Detecting lymph nodes metastasis in prostate cancer through extended vs. standard laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy.', 'Current status of pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer: the New York PLND nomogram.', 'Magnetometer-Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer: Rate of Lymph Node Involvement Compared with Radioisotope Marking.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Magnetometer-Guided Sentinel Lymphadenectomy After Intraprostatic Injection of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles in Intermediate- and High-Risk Prostate Cancer Using the Magnetic Activity of Sentinel Nodes.', 'Detection of CK19 mRNA Using One-step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) in Prostate Cancer: Preliminary Results.', 'Sentinel lymph node dissection in prostate cancer using superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide: early clinical experience.', 'Updated Nomogram Incorporating Percentage of Positive Cores to Predict Probability of Lymph Node Invasion in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection.']"""

Due to the physical properties of the proton beam, PT delivers dose with higher precision and no exit dose compared to conventional radiotherapy. In PT, patient data are distributed among multiple systems, a hindrance to research on efficacy and effectiveness. A data mining method and a treatment plan navigator utilizing the infrastructure and data repository of a PT electronic patient record (ePR) was developed to minimize radiation toxicity and improve outcomes in prostate cancer treatment. MATERIALS/METHOD(S): The workflow of a proton therapy treatment in a radiation oncology department was reviewed, and a clinical data model and data flow were designed. A prototype PT ePR system with DICOM compliance was developed to manage prostate cancer patient images, treatment plans, and related clinical data. The ePR system consists of four main components: (1) Data Gateway; (2) ePR Server; (3) Decision Support Tools; and (4) Visualization and Display Tools. Decision support and visualization tools are currently developed based on DICOM images, DICOM-RT and DICOM-RT-ION objects data from prostate cancer patients treated with hypofractionation protocol proton therapy were used for evaluating ePR system effectiveness. Each patient data set includes a set of computed tomography (CT) DICOM images and four DICOM-RT and RT-ION objects. In addition, clinical outcomes data collected from PT cases were included to establish a knowledge base for outcomes analysis.  Results:   A data mining search engine and an intelligent treatment plan navigator (ITPN) were developed and integrated with the ePR system. Evaluation was based on a data set of 39 PT patients and a hypothetical patient.  Conclusions:   The ePR system was able to facilitate the proton therapy workflow.

To better understand mechanisms conferring resistance to death ligands, we screened an siRNA library to identify sequences that sensitize resistant cells to fas activating antibody (CH-11). From this screen, we identified the Sterol-Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1 (SREBP1), a transcription factor, which regulates genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis including fatty acid synthase. Inhibition of SREBP1 sensitized PPC-1 and HeLa to the death receptor ligands CH-11 and TRAIL. In contrast, DU145 prostate cancer cells that are resistant to death ligands despite expressing the receptors on their cell surface remained resistant to CH-11 and TRAIL after knockdown of SREBP1. Consistent with the effects on cell viability, the addition of CH-11 activated caspases 3 and 8 in HeLa but not DU145 cells with silenced SREBP1. We demonstrated that knockdown of SREBP1 produced a marked decrease in fatty acid synthase expression. Furthermore, genetic or chemical inhibition of fatty acid synthase with shRNA or orlistat, respectively, recapitulated the effects of SREBP1 inhibition and sensitized HeLa but not DU145 cells to CH-11 and TRAIL. Sensitization to death receptor ligands by inhibition of fatty acid synthase was associated with activation of caspase 8 prior to caspase 9. Neither silencing of SREBP1 or fatty acid synthase changed basal expression of the core death receptor components Fas, caspase 8, FADD, caspase 3 or FLIP.

Modeling estimated benefits in prostate cancer screening""","""Background:   Simulation models are essential tools for estimating benefits of cancer screening programs. Such models include a screening-effect model that represents how early detection by screening followed by treatment affects disease-specific survival. Two commonly used screening-effect models are the stage-shift model, where mortality benefits are explained by the shift to more favorable stages, and the cure model, where early detection enhances the chances of cure from disease.  Objective:   This article describes commonly used screening-effect models and analyses their predicted mortality benefit in a model for prostate cancer screening.  Method:   The MISCAN simulation model was used to predict the reduction of prostate cancer mortality in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Rotterdam. The screening-effect models were included in the model. For each model the predictions of prostate cancer mortality reduction were calculated. The study compared 4 screening-effect models, which are versions of the stage-shift model or the cure model.  Results:   The stage-shift models predicted, after a follow-up of 9 years, reductions in prostate cancer mortality varying from 38% to 63% for ERSPC-Rotterdam compared with a 27% reduction observed in the ERSPC. The cure models predicted reductions in prostate cancer mortality varying from 21% to 27%.  Conclusions:   The differences in predicted mortality reductions show the importance of validating models to observed trial mortality data. The stage-shift models considerably overestimated the mortality reduction. Therefore, the stage-shift models should be used with care, especially when modeling the effect of screening for cancers with long lead times, such as prostate cancer.""","""['Elisabeth M Wever', 'Gerrit Draisma', 'Eveline A M Heijnsdijk', 'Harry J de Koning']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Exploring the unknown and the unknowable with simulation models.', 'Prostate-specific antigen screening in the United States vs in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer-Rotterdam.', 'Lead time and overdiagnosis in prostate-specific antigen screening: importance of methods and context.', 'Do Treatment Differences between Arms Affect the Main Outcome of ERSPC Rotterdam?', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Dying To Find Out: The Cost of Time at the Dawn of the Multicancer Early Detection Era.', 'Modelled mortality benefits of multi-cancer early detection screening in England.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate Cancer Screening in the UK: A Decision Model Analysis Based on the CAP Trial.', 'Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Screening Strategies in a Low-Resource, High-risk Population in the Bahamas.', 'Stage Shift as an Endpoint in Cancer Screening Trials: Implications for Evaluating Multicancer Early Detection Tests.']"""

However, the functional contribution of PKCε to development or progression of PCa remained to be determined. Here we present the first in vivo genetic evidence that PKCε is essential for both the development and metastasis of PCa in the transgenic mouse model of prostate adenocarcinoma (TRAMP). Heterozygous or homozygous genetic deletions of PKCε in FVB/N TRAMP inhibited PCa development and metastasis as analyzed by positron emission tomography/computed tomography, tumor weight determinations, and histopathology. We also examined biomarkers associated with tumor progression in this model, including markers of survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and metastatic progression. To find clues about the genes regulated by PKCε and linked to the Stat3 signaling pathway, we carried out focused PCR arrays of JAK/STAT signaling in excised PCa tissues from PKCε wild-type and nullizygous TRAMP mice. Notably, PKCε loss was associated with significant downregulation of proliferative and metastatic genes C/EBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β), CRP (C-reactive protein), CMK, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), CD64, Jun B, and gp130.

The ProtecT (Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment) study successfully used qualitative research methods to improve recruitment and these methods were replicated in five other RCTs facing recruitment difficulties. A similar qualitative recruitment investigation was undertaken in the SPARE (Selective bladder Preservation Against Radical Excision) feasibility study to explore reasons for low recruitment and attempt to improve recruitment rates by implementing changes suggested by qualitative findings.  Methods:   In Phase I of the investigation, reasons for low levels of recruitment were explored through content analysis of RCT documents, thematic analysis of interviews with trial staff and recruiters, and conversation analysis of audio-recordings of recruitment appointments. Findings were presented to the trial management group and a plan of action was agreed. In Phase II, changes to design and conduct were implemented, with training and feedback provided for recruitment staff.  Results:   Five key challenges to trial recruitment were identified in Phase I: (a) Investigators and recruiters had considerable difficulty articulating the trial design in simple terms; (b) The recruitment pathway was complicated, involving staff across different specialties/centres and communication often broke down; (c) Recruiters inadvertently used 'loaded' terminology such as 'gold standard' in study information, leading to unbalanced presentation; (d) Fewer eligible patients were identified than had been anticipated; (e) Strong treatment preferences were expressed by potential participants and trial staff in some centres. In Phase II, study information (patient information sheet and flowchart) was simplified, the recruitment pathway was focused around lead recruiters, and training sessions and 'tips' were provided for recruiters. Issues of patient eligibility were insurmountable, however, and the independent Trial Steering Committee advised closure of the SPARE trial in February 2010.  Conclusions:   The qualitative investigation identified the key aspects of trial design and conduct that were hindering recruitment, and a plan of action that was acceptable to trial investigators and recruiters was implemented. Qualitative investigations can thus be used to elucidate challenges to recruitment in trials with very different treatment arms, but require sufficient time to be undertaken successfully.

Androgens can drive this process by direct action on the stroma. We investigated whether there was a direct link between androgens and another key regulator of stromal cells, intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+ ]i ).  Methods:   Prostate stromal cells were freshly obtained and cultures derived from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Gene expression in dihydrotestosterone treated and untreated cells was compared using Affymetrix gene expression arrays and Ca2+ regulated features were identified by Gene Ontology (GO). Changes in [Ca2+]i were determined in Fluo-4 loaded cells. Androgen regulation was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitaion.  Results:   Stromal cell cultures were sorted for expression of integrin α1 β1 , which enriched for cells expressing the androgen receptor (AR). We identified key functional categories, within the androgen-induced gene expression signature, focusing on genes involved in calcium signaling. From this analysis, stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1) was identified as a significantly differentially expressed gene with four relevant associated GO terms. DNA sequence analysis showed that the promoter region of STIM1 contained putative androgen response element sequences in which AR binding ability of STIM1 was confirmed. Androgens directly regulated STIM1 expression and STIM1 effects on store-operated calcium entry were inhibited by STIM1 knock-down. Reduced STIM1 expression in prostate stromal cells led to a reduction in basal Ca2+ levels, the amount of Ca2+ released by thapsigargin and a reduction in store filling following TG-induced store depletion.

Additional factors such as diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and certain medications may also affect PSA levels and confound the PSA-BMI association. In this study we evaluated the potential confounding effect of these factors on the obesity-PSA relationship and evaluated the association between these factors and PSA level.  Methods:   The study cohort consisted of 770 population-based controls without a history of prostate cancer (PCa) who participated in a prior PCa study. Demographic, anthropometric, and medical history data were obtained, and PSA level was determined from blood drawn at the time of interview. Linear regression was performed to evaluate the PSA-BMI relationship, adjusting for potential confounders. Finally, a forward stepwise algorithm was used to determine which factors were independently associated with PSA values.  Results:   With increase in BMI (<25, 25-29, ≥30), the geometric mean PSA level declined (1.18, 1.13, and 0.94, respectively); obese men had a 17% (95% CI 0.70-0.99) lower age-adjusted PSA level compared to normal weight men.

A LOI for IGF2, a paracrine growth factor, has been implicated in the development of prostate and other cancers. In the current study, we define IGF2 LOI in histologically normal prostate tissues in relationship to tumor foci and gene expression.  Methods:   Microdissected tumor associated (TA) adjacent (2 mm) and distant (10 mm) tissues surrounding tumor foci were generated. IGF2 imprinting in informative prostate tissue sets was quantitated using a fluorescent primer extension assay and expression analyzed utilizing quantitative PCR. DNA methylation analyses were performed using quantitative pyrosequencing.  Results:   A marked IGF2 LOI was found in adjacent TA tissues (39 ± 3.1%) and did not significantly decrease in tissues distant (38 ± 5.3%) from tumor foci (45 ± 2.9%; P = 0.21). IGF2 imprinting correlated with IGF2 expression in TA tissues, but not within the tumor foci. Hypomethylation of the IGF2 DMR0 region correlated with decreased IGF2 expression in tumors (P < 0.01). The expression of IGF2 and its adjacent imprinted gene H19 were increased in adjacent and distant tissues compared to tumors (P < 0.05) indicating the importance of factors other than LOI in driving IGF2 expression.  Conclusions:   LOI of IGF2 occurs not only adjacent to prostate tumor foci, but is widely prevalent even in distant areas within the peripheral zone. These data provide evidence for a widespread epigenetic field defect in histologically normal tissues that might be employed to identify prostate cancer in patients.""","""['Sachin Bhusari', 'Bing Yang', 'Jessica Kueck', 'Wei Huang', 'David F Jarrard']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Aging and cancer-related loss of insulin-like growth factor 2 imprinting in the mouse and human prostate.', 'IGF2 DMR0 methylation, loss of imprinting, and patient prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Impairment of IGF2 gene expression in prostate cancer is triggered by epigenetic dysregulation of IGF2-DMR0 and its interaction with KLF4.', 'Loss of imprinting of IGF2 as an epigenetic marker for the risk of human cancer.', 'Altered genomic imprinting in the IGF2 and H19 genes in human lung cancer.', 'Melatonin and cancer suppression: insights into its effects on DNA methylation.', 'Genetic Drivers of Ileal Neuroendocrine Tumors.', 'Alteration of Metabolic Conditions Impacts the Regulation of IGF-II/H19 Imprinting Status in Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic reprogramming during prostate cancer progression: A perspective from development.', 'Machine learning and clinical epigenetics: a review of challenges for diagnosis and classification.']"""

Methods:   Data were retrospectively analyzed in 96 patients with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer (BRPC) treated with IAD since 1995. IAD consisted of LHRH-agonists ± antiandrogen given usually at PSA threshold (ng/ml) of 10-20, for 6-9 months. Cycles were repeated until the development of castration resistance. Mixed effects model was used to study PSADT change over cycles. Multivariate cox regression model was used to identify outcome-associated variables.  Results:   Patients received a mean of 2.8 treatment cycles over a mean follow-up time of 71 months. Fifty-seven (59%) remain on treatment and 39 (41%) developed PSA refractoriness (n = 8) or positive scans (n = 31). First off treatment interval PSADT (median 2.3 months) was significantly shorter than the baseline (median 7.34) but remained stable in subsequent cycles. Off treatment interval PSADT adjusted for testosterone recovery (median 3.7) was significantly longer than that based on all PSA determinations (median 2). Factors associated with disease progression were pre-treatment PSADT (≥6 vs. <6), first off treatment interval PSADT (≥3 vs. <3), and PSA nadir during the first treatment interval (<0.1 vs. ≥0.1).  Conclusions:   During IAD for BRPC, PSADT becomes shorter, and is associated with testosterone recovery. PSADT before treatment and during the first off treatment interval is associated with disease progression.

Methods:   This retrospective study comprised 505 patients diagnosed with low- or intermediate- risk prostate cancer in 1998-2005 and treated at Hospital Gregorio Marañón (Spain) with radical prostatectomy (RP) or external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT). No adjuvant therapy was administered. Biochemical relapse was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≥0.4 ng/ml for RP cases and nadir + 2 for EBRT cases. RP was performed in 271 patients (53.6%) and EBRT in 234 patients (46.4%). The median follow-up was 60 months. The analysis end point was to compare the biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) between the two groups.  Results:   The 5-year bRFS rates for RP and EBRT were 79 ± 2% and 86 ± 2%, respectively (P = 0.48). Multivariate analysis indicated that initial PSA (P = 0.00), perineural invasion in the biopsy specimen (P = 0.00), Gleason score (P = 0.04), EBRT dose (P = 0.02), and positive margins (P = 0.00) were independent predictors of relapse. A decision tree model was constructed with these variables. In the EBRT cohort, a nadir PSA of <0.3 ng/ml was associated with the best 5-year bRFS (96.6 vs. 56.5% if nadir PSA > 1.3 ng/ml). Late biochemical failure (>5 years) was more frequent in the RT group and with low-dose EBRT (≤72 Gy).  Conclusions:   The biochemical failure rates were similar between PR and EBRT in low- and intermediate-risk subgroups.

Overexpression of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in PC, but not in the hyperplastic prostate, provides a promising target for staging and monitoring of PC. Based on the assumption that cancer cells have increased metabolic activity, metabolism-based tracers are also being used for PC imaging. We compared GRPR-based targeting using the (68)Ga-labelled bombesin analogue AMBA with metabolism-based targeting using (18)F-methylcholine ((18)F-FCH) in nude mice bearing human prostate VCaP xenografts.  Methods:   PET and biodistribution studies were performed with both (68)Ga-AMBA and (18)F-FCH in all VCaP tumour-bearing mice, with PC-3 tumour-bearing mice as reference. Scanning started immediately after injection. Dynamic PET scans were reconstructed and analysed quantitatively. Biodistribution of tracers and tissue uptake was expressed as percent of injected dose per gram tissue (%ID/g).  Results:   All tumours were clearly visualized using (68)Ga-AMBA. (18)F-FCH showed significantly less contrast due to poor tumour-to-background ratios. Quantitative PET analyses showed fast tumour uptake and high retention for both tracers. VCaP tumour uptake values determined from PET at steady-state were 6.7 ± 1.4%ID/g (20-30 min after injection, N = 8) for (68)Ga-AMBA and 1.6 ± 0.5%ID/g (10-20 min after injection, N = 8) for (18)F-FCH, which were significantly different (p <0.001). The results in PC-3 tumour-bearing mice were comparable. Biodistribution data were in accordance with the PET results showing VCaP tumour uptake values of 9.5 ± 4.8%ID/g (N = 8) for (68)Ga-AMBA and 2.1 ± 0.4%ID/g (N = 8) for (18)F-FCH. Apart from the GRPR-expressing organs, uptake in all organs was lower for (68)Ga-AMBA than for (18)F-FCH.  Conclusion:   Tumour uptake of (68)Ga-AMBA was higher while overall background activity was lower than observed for (18)F-FCH in the same PC-bearing mice.

To better understand the potential relationship between genes in the inflammation pathway and PC risk, we evaluated variants in 16 candidate genes.  Methods:   A total of 143 tagging and amino acid altering single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in Caucasian and African American men participating in one of two population-based, case-control studies (n = 1,458 cases and 1,351 controls). The relative risk of PC was estimated using logistic and polytomous regression models.  Results:   Ten SNPs in seven genes (CXCL12, IL4, IL6, IL6ST, PTGS2, STAT3, and TNF) were nominally associated (P < 0.05) with risk of PC in Caucasians. The most significant effect on risk was seen with rs11574783 in the interleukin 6 signal transducer (IL6ST) gene (OR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.63). Cumulatively, four SNPs in genes interleukin 4 (IL4), IL6ST, PTGS2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) conferred a three-fold elevation in PC risk among men carrying the maximum number of high-risk alleles (OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.41-6.25, P(trend) = 0.0003). Risk estimates for seven SNPs varied significantly according to disease aggressiveness (P(homogeneity) < 0.05), with SNPs in AKT1, PIK3R1, and STAT3 independently associated with more aggressive PC; OR = 5.1 (95% CI: 2.29-11.40, P(trend) = 3.8 × 10(-5)) for carriers of all high-risk genotypes.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that variants in genes within the inflammation pathway may play a role in the development of PC, however, further studies are needed to replicate our findings.

COX-2, a key regulator of inflammation-producing prostaglandins, promotes cell proliferation and growth; thus, overexpression of COX-2 is often found in tumor tissues. Therefore, a better understanding of the regulatory mechanism(s) of COX-2 could lead to novel targeted cancer therapies. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of microRNA-101 (miR-101)-regulated COX-2 expression and the therapeutic potential of exogenous miR-101 for COX-2-associated cancer. A stably expressing exogenous miR-101 prostate cancer cell line (BPH1(CmiR101)) was generated by using lentiviral transduction as a tool for in vitro and in vivo studies. We found that miR-101 inhibited COX-2 posttranscriptional expression by directly binding to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of COX-2 mRNA. The regulatory function of miR-101 was also confirmed by using antisense DNA. As a result, exogenous miR-101 is able to effectively suppress the growth of cultured prostate cancer cells and prostate tumor xenografts. The average tumor weight was significantly lower in the BPH1(CmiR101) group (0.22 g) than the BPH1(Cvec) group (0.46 g). Expression levels of the cell growth regulators, such as cyclin proteins, PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), were also studied. In conclusion, COX-2 is a direct target in miR-101 regulation of posttranscription. Exogenous miR-101 suppresses the proliferation and growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that exogenous miR-101 may provide a new cancer therapy by directly inhibiting COX-2 expression.""","""['Yubin Hao', 'Xinbin Gu', 'Yuan Zhao', 'Stephen Greene', 'Wei Sha', 'Duane T Smoot', 'Joseph Califano', 'T-C Wu', 'Xiaowu Pang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Downregulation of miR-101 in gastric cancer correlates with cyclooxygenase-2 overexpression and tumor growth.', 'miR-615 Inhibits Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation and Invasion by Directly Targeting Cyclin D2.', 'miR-483-5p promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion by targeting RBM5.', 'MicroRNA-146a targets PRKCE to modulate papillary thyroid tumor development.', 'Mechanistic aspects of COX-2 expression in colorectal neoplasia.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting mirnas to prostate cancer tumors: using psma as an active target.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis of Canonical and Modified miRNAs Enhances the Resolution of the Functional miRNAome in Cancer.', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Long non-coding RNA PTAR inhibits apoptosis but promotes proliferation, invasion and migration of cervical cancer cells by binding miR-101.']"""

Methods:   The clinical and pathologic data of 199 patients with high-risk features were reviewed retrospectively. High-risk features were prostate-specific antigen level >20 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason score ≥8 or clinical tumor category ≥2c. All patients were followed up by measuring their prostate-specific antigen levels every 3 months. The median follow-up period was 37.0 months (range: 1.0-143.0).  Results:   During the follow-up period, biochemical recurrence was observed in 68 patients (34.2%). The 1-, 3- and 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 79.6, 61.9 and 49.2%, respectively. Surgical Gleason score ≥8, positive surgical margin, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesicle invasion correlated significantly with biochemical recurrence-free survival (all P < 0.05), but pelvic lymphadenectomy did not. Multivariate Cox's proportional hazard analysis revealed that the only significant independent prognostic factor of biochemical recurrence-free survival was seminal vesicle invasion (P = 0.035, relative risk = 1.81).  Conclusions:   Men with seminal vesicle invasion appear to have a significantly higher biochemical recurrence risk in patients with high-risk prostate cancer.

Elevated PSCA expression has been shown to correlate with malignant phenotype and clinical progression. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the therapeutic potential of small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting PSCA on human CaP cells.  Materials and methods:   A set of two siRNAs directed different regions of human PSCA (siRNA-PSCA) were designed and transfected into a human CaP PC-3M cell line. The silencing effect was screened by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The biological effects of siRNA-PSCA on PC-3M cells were investigated by examining the cell proliferation through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell cycle distribution through flow cytometry, and migration and invasion potencies through transwell invasion assay upon the PSCA silencing.  Results:   PC-3M cells had positive PSCA expression on immunocytochemical assay. PSCA expression was depleted at 48 hours after transfection with siRNA-PSCA. Silencing of PSCA significantly suppressed cell proliferation. Cell cycle assay showed that the anti-proliferation effect of siRNA-PSCA was mediated by arresting cells in the G0/G1 phase rather than apoptosis. Furthermore, PSCA knockdown resulted in a marked decrease of cell migration and invasion capabilities in PC-3M cells.  Conclusions:   The present study provides the first evidence that silencing PSCA using siRNA can inhibit the proliferation and invasiveness properties of human CaP cells, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for CaP and open a novel avenue toward the investigation of the role of PSCA overexpression in cancers.""","""['Zhigang Zhao', 'Wenjing Ma', 'Guohua Zeng', 'Defeng Qi', 'Lili Ou', 'Yeping Liang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['RNA interference targeting PSCA suppresses primary tumor growth and metastasis formation of human prostate cancer xenografts in SCID mice.', 'Effect of p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1 transfection on the biological characteristics of PC-3M human prostate cancer cells.', 'PSCA regulates IL-6 expression through p38/NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen and cancer risk, mechanisms and therapeutic implications.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: a Jekyll and Hyde molecule?', 'SNP rs2920280 in PSCA Is Associated with Susceptibility to Gastric Mucosal Atrophy and Is a Promising Biomarker in Japanese Individuals with Helicobacter pylori Infection.', 'miR-199b-5p-DDR1-ERK signalling axis suppresses prostate cancer metastasis via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'PSCArs2294008 T polymorphism increases the risk of bladder cancer in Bai, Dai, and Han ethnicity in China and a potential mechanism.', 'Expression of prostate stem cell antigen is downregulated during flavonoid-induced cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells.', 'Charge reversible calcium phosphate lipid hybrid nanoparticle for siRNA delivery.']"""

In addition, KuJ markedly decreased the levels of cyclins (D1 and E), cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk2 and Cdk4) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and caused an increase in p21 and p27 levels. Its induction of apoptosis was accompanied by an increase in cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, attributable to augment of Bax/Bcl-2 and Bad/Bcl-xL and reduction of survivin levels. BMLE and KuJ also reduced the expression of androgen receptor (AR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) while induced P53 protein level.

Adult prostate stem/early progenitor cells were isolated from normal human prostates through prostasphere formation in three-dimensional culture. The stem/early progenitor cell status and clonality of prostasphere cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and Hoechst staining. Normal prostate progenitor cells were found to express estrogen receptor α, estrogen receptor β, and G protein-coupled receptor 30 mRNA and protein and were responsive to 1 nm estradiol-17β with increased numbers and prostasphere size, implicating them as direct estrogen targets. Recombinants of human prostate progenitor cells with rat urogenital sinus mesenchyme formed chimeric prostate tissue in vivo under the renal capsule of nude mice. Cytodifferentiation of human prostate progenitor cells in chimeric tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using epithelial cell markers (p63, cytokeratin 8/18, and androgen receptor), whereas human origin and functional differentiation were confirmed by expression of human nuclear antigen and prostate-specific antigen, respectively. Once mature tissues formed, the hosts were exposed to elevated testosterone and estradiol-17β for 1-4 months, and prostate pathology was longitudinally monitored. Induction of prostate cancer in the human stem/progenitor cell-generated prostatic tissue was observed over time, progressing from normal histology to epithelial hyperplasia, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, and prostate cancer with local renal invasion.

We describe that 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA), a component of Siamese ginger (Languas galanga), can suppress prostate tumor growth by largely abrogating angiogenesis. ACA suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced proliferation, migration, adhesion and tubulogenesis of primary cultured human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose-dependent manner. ACA also inhibited VEGF-induced microvessel sprouting from aortic rings ex vivo and suppressed new vasculature formation in Matrigel plugs in vivo. We further demonstrated that the mechanisms of this chavicol were to block the activation of VEGF-mediated Src kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rho family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) (Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA) in HUVECs. Furthermore, treatment of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) with ACA resulted in decreased cell viability and suppression of angiogenic factor production by interference with dual Src/FAK kinases. After subcutaneous administration to mice bearing human prostate cancer PC-3 xenografts, ACA (6 mg/kg/day) remarkably inhibited tumor volume and tumor weight and decreased levels of Src, CD31, VEGF and Ki-67. As indicated by immunohistochemistry and TUNEL analysis, microvessel density and cell proliferation were also dramatically suppressed in tumors from ACA-treated mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that ACA targets the Src-FAK-Rho GTPase pathway, leading to the suppression of prostate tumor angiogenesis and growth.""","""['Xiufeng Pang', 'Li Zhang', 'Li Lai', 'Jing Chen', 'Yuanyuan Wu', 'Zhengfang Yi', 'Jian Zhang', 'Weijing Qu', 'Bharat B Aggarwal', 'Mingyao Liu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Anacardic acid (6-pentadecylsalicylic acid) inhibits tumor angiogenesis by targeting Src/FAK/Rho GTPases signaling pathway.', '(-)-Gossypol suppresses the growth of human prostate cancer xenografts via modulating VEGF signaling-mediated angiogenesis.', 'Antiangiogenic mechanisms of PJ-8, a novel inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling.', 'Targeting angiogenesis for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'VEGFA and tumour angiogenesis.', 'Role of Rho GTPases in inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Novel Drugs with High Efficacy against Tumor Angiogenesis.', ""1'-Acetoxyeugenol Acetate Isolated from Thai Ginger Induces Apoptosis in Human Ovarian Cancer Cells by ROS Production via NADPH Oxidase."", 'Improved anticancer activity of betulinic acid on breast cancer through a grafted copolymer-based micelles system.', 'The role of microenvironment in tumor angiogenesis.']"""

However, erectile function (EF) after radical prostatectomy is still a significant concern. The same surgical technique often results in different EF outcomes.  Aim:   We evaluated factors that correlate with recovery of EF within 1 year after robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP).  Methods:   From January 2008 to May 2009, 145 consecutive patients underwent RALP by one surgeon. Patients were followed postoperatively at 3-month intervals and assessed for EF recovery, defined as an erection sufficient for penetrative intercourse with satisfaction. Baseline demographics, medical comorbidities, degree of nerve sparing, and perioperative and postoperative variables were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine factors associated with EF recovery.  Main outcome measures:   Postoperative sexual outcomes were attained prospectively via our erectile state questionnaire.  Results:   Complete follow-up EF data were available on 89 men. Within 1-year follow-up, 56 men (62.9%) recovered EF and 33 men (37.1%) did not. In univariate logistic regression analysis, race (black), diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and clinical T2 carcinoma of the prostate were associated with diminished EF. Higher-preoperative Sexual Health Inventory for Men score and incremental nerve sparing (enhanced lateral prostatic fascia sparing) were associated with higher odds of recovering potency. In multivariate analysis, hyperlipidemia was primary comorbidity associated with diminished EF, and bilateral nerve sparing with a minimum unilateral-enhanced status was the impacting factor for EF recovery within 1 year after surgery.  Conclusions:   Bilateral nerve preservation with a minimum unilateral-enhanced status is associated with improved recovery of EF, and hyperlipidemia is a significant negative predictive factor of postoperative EF recovery within 1 year following RALP. Therefore, it is important to control hyperlipidemia as well as to use the proper surgical technique in maximizing EF recovery within 1 year after radical prostatectomy.""","""['Woo Jin Ko', 'Matthew D Truesdale', 'Gregory W Hruby', 'Jaime Landman', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Preoperative criteria to select patients for bilateral nerve-sparing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Recovery of Baseline Erectile Function in Men Following Radical Prostatectomy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Analysis Using Validated Measures.', 'Association of surgeon subjective characterization of nerve sparing quality with potency following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparascopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Editorial Comment: Effect of pelvimetric diameters on success of surgery in patients submitted to robot-assisted perineal radical prostatectomy.', 'Visualization of peri-prostatic neurovascular fibers before and after radical prostatectomy by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with clinical correlations: preliminary report.', 'Outcomes of health-related quality of life after open, laparoscopic, or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in China.', 'Evaluation of periprostatic neurovascular fibers before and after radical prostatectomy by means of 1.5 T MRI diffusion tensor imaging.', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Such product proved to be successful in targeting radionuclide therapy in a mouse model of inoperable breast cancer. Here, we show that the uptake of a single or multiple doses of biotin (up to five times), by the tissue-bound AvidinOX(®) , is stable for 2 weeks. Taking into account that oxidized avidin is the first chemically reactive protein to be proposed for clinical use, we evaluated its tolerability, immunogenicity and mutagenicity. Present in vitro data indicate that AvidinOX(®) (up to 10 μg/5 × 10(5) cells) does not affect cell viability or proliferation of PC3 human prostate cancer or 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell lines as well as primary mouse spleen cells. Safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were conducted using AvidinOX(®) up to the highest concentration compatible with its solubility (about 12 mg/mL), representing four times the product concentration intended for human use, and in the maximum administrable volume compatible with each study system. The intramuscular administration in rat and monkey induced a moderate to strong inflammatory response particularly after a second administration and consistently with the induction of an immune response. Interestingly, the intramuscular administration of AvidinOX(®) to rodents and monkeys exhibiting very high anti-avidin antibody titres was well tolerated with no systemic symptoms of any kind. Intravenous administration of AvidinOX(®) , performed to mimic an accidental injection of the dose intended for a local administration (15 μL of 3.3 mg/mL solution), showed significant localization of the product into the spleen not associated with uptake of the radiolabelled biotin intravenously injected after 24 hr, thus suggesting rapid inactivation. No mutagenic activity was induced by oxidized avidin in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

It has been established that clioquinol displays toxicity towards malignant cells, inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis. In the present study we therefore investigated the effect of clioquinol on the XIAP [X-linked IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein)], as one of its primary functions is to hinder caspase activity and suppress apoptotic cell death. Clioquinol treatment caused cytoplasmic XIAP to rapidly relocate to the nucleus in multiple human transformed (hyperplasic and carcinoma) prostate lines. Clioquinol also caused the cytoplasmic clearance of other IAP family members (cIAP1 and cIAP2). Copper, and no other relevant bivalent metal (e.g. zinc or iron), was exclusively required for clioquinol to elicit an effect on XIAP. We further demonstrated that clioquinol selectively targets and rapidly destroys transformed prostate lines without harming primary prostate epithelial cells. The toxicity of clioquinol was copper-dependent, positively correlated with the level of extracellular copper and could be abrogated by using the copper chelator TTM (tetrathiomolybdate). Clioquinol forced the profound accumulation of intracellular copper with ensuing toxicity influenced by key regulators of cellular copper homoeostasis.

Manipulation of them is likely essential to the success of cancer immunotherapy protocols although optimal stimulation and maintenance of NK activity remains elusive. Here we studied the stimulatory effects of PHA and K562, on NK activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  Materials and methods:   The NK activity of PBMCs against DU-145 was determined with 51Cr-release assay. The PBMCs were stimulated with PHA, either on one occasion or repetitively on three occasions (1-PHA-PBMC or 3-PHA-PBMC, respectively), and were incubated with irradiated K562 (iK562). The expression of CD56, NKG2D and MICA/B were detected on PBMCs and cell lines with flow cytometry.  Results:   PHA stimulation increased the proportion of CD56+ cells and upregulated NKG2D expression on 1-PHA-PBMC and 3-PHA-PBMC, but co-incubation with iK562 decreased NKG2D expression on 1-PHA-PBMC without change of NKG2D expression on the 3-PHA-PBMC. NK activity of 1-PHA-PBMC appeared to decrease with co-incubation with iK562 compared to a significant increase in activity of 3-PHA-PBMC. A similar increase in interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion from 3-PHA-PBMC was demonstrated compared to 1-PHA-PBMC.  Discussion and conclusion:   Our results demonstrated that varying the mitogen exposure to PBMCs affect the influence of iK562 on NK activity.

Results:   The 10-year actuarial prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival rates were 81% for the low-risk group, 78% for the intermediate-risk group, and 62% for the high-risk group; the 10-year distant metastases-free rates were 100%, 94%, and 90%, respectively; and the 10-year cause-specific mortality rates were 0%, 3%, and 14%, respectively. The 10-year likelihood of developing grade 2 and 3 late genitourinary toxicity was 11% and 5%, respectively; and the 10-year likelihood of developing grade 2 and 3 late gastrointestinal toxicity was 2% and 1%, respectively. No grade 4 toxicities were observed.

Our previous study demonstrated that the resveratrol analog HS-1793 showed stronger antitumor activity than resveratrol in various cancer cells. We examined the antitumor activity exerted by HS-1793 in prostate cancer cells, and we observed that HS-1793 acts as a polyploidy inducer. Noticeably, multinucleation and polyploidization were induced in most LNCaP cells treated with HS-1793 at the dose causing a slight decline in cell viability. However, the induction of multinucleation and polyploidization was much lower in PC-3 prostate cancer cells treated with the same dose of HS-1793. Western blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that the expression of Aurora B was almost undetectable in LNCaP cells, but it was highly expressed in PC-3 cells. Further, silencing of Aurora B sensitized PC-3 cells to HS-1793-induced multi-nucleation. These results indicate that expression of Aurora B determines multinucleation in prostate cancer cells treated with HS-1793. Additional assays using multiple cancer cell lines show that the population of multinucleated cells induced by HS-1793 treatment is inversely proportional to Aurora B expression. We further elicited that the HS-1793-induced polyploid LNCaP cells are vulnerable to downregulation of Bcl-xL. Since the polyploidization in LNCaP induced by HS-1793 does not appear to cause definite commitment to apoptosis, the termination of polyploid cells by inhibition of Bcl-xL could provide an advantageous means to improve chemotherapeutic efficacy of HS-1793.""","""['Na Young Jeong', 'Young Geol Yoon', 'Jee Hyun Rho', 'Jee Suk Lee', 'Sang Yeob Lee', 'Ki Soo Yoo', 'Suhee Song', 'Hongsuk Suh', 'Yung Hyun Choi', 'Young Hyun Yoo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['A novel resveratrol derivative, HS1793, overcomes the resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in human leukemic U937 cells.', 'Antisense RNA down-regulation of bcl-xL Expression in prostate cancer cells leads to diminished rates of cellular proliferation and resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.', 'Curcumin downregulates cell survival mechanisms in human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Cancer regeneration: Polyploid cells are the key drivers of tumor progression.', 'What Are the Reasons for Continuing Failures in Cancer Therapy?

In this study we report, for the first time, the effects of pancratistatin (PST) on models of metastatic prostate cancer. The effects of pancratistatin on prostate cancer DU145 and LNCaP cell lines was assessed by microscopy, enzymatic activity assays and Western blotting. Apoptosis was determined by nuclear condensation and caspase activation, and autophagy was observed by MDC staining and LC3 expression levels. Human prostate xenografts were used to test the potential therapeutic efficacy of intra-tumor administration of pancratistatin in vivo. Pancratistatin treatment reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and androgen-refractory (DU145) prostate cancer cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but with an insignificant effect on normal human fibroblast (NHF) cells at the effective dose. Increased reactive oxygen species production and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential resulted from treatment with pancratistatin in both cancer cell lines. This study presents the novel finding that pancratistatin treatment caused decreased migration capacity and increased autophagy levels in metastatic prostate cancer cells. Importantly, in this proof-of-concept study, pancratistatin reduced the volume of xenograft tumors compared to control-treated animals, and was well-tolerated.

Therefore, in this study we investigated the effect of blocking Ets-1 in PC3 prostate cancer cells on genes involved in the metastatic cascade, and correlated these findings with prostate cancer tissues. Two stable PC3 cell cultures were established by transfection with either an Ets-1 inverse antisense expression vector or a mock control vector. The effect of blocking Ets-1 on genes involved in the metastatic cascade was assessed by a comprehensive gene expression microarray analysis of Ets-1 inverse and mock control cells. Correlating the sets of genes found in the PC3 microarray data with prostate cancer tissues was performed by verifying the genes in a comprehensive gene expression microarray analysis of RNA extracted from laser microdissected normal prostate glands and from carcinoma glands taken from prostate cancer patients. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of Ets-1 in mock cells and its absence in Ets-1 inverse cells. In the Ets-1 blockade microarray, many differentially expressed genes were found; however, only genes with a greater than 10-fold up- or down-regulation between the Ets-1 blockade and mock control were considered significant. The genes were placed into four groups that play a role in the so-called metastatic cascade based on their known functions in proliferation, apoptosis, migration and angiogenesis. The genes found in the Ets-1 blockade microarray analysis were verified for their presence in the microarray analysis of prostate cancer tissues. Genes found in the microarray analysis of prostate cancer tissues with an >2-fold change and a p-value <0.01 were considered significant. We identified sets of genes that are involved in the metastatic cascade and are known to be implicated in prostate cancer to show changes in the expression patterns due to the Ets-1 blockade in PC3 cells. Correlating these sets of genes with the findings in prostate cancer tissues, we identified 16 genes that are up- or down-regulated in healthy compared to tumor prostate glands.

Whereas hypomethylation is found mainly in repeat sequences, regional hypermethylation has been linked to the transcriptional silencing of certain tumor suppressor genes. We attempted to search for candidate genes involved in breast/prostate carcinogenesis, using the criteria that they should be expressed in primary cultures of normal breast/prostate epithelial cells but are frequently downregulated in breast/prostate cancer cell lines and that their promoters are hypermethylated.  Methodology/principal findings:   We identified several dozens of candidates among 194 homeobox and related genes using Systematic Multiplex RT-PCR and among 23,000 known genes and 23,000 other expressed sequences in the human genome by DNA microarray hybridization. An additional examination, by real-time qRT-PCR of clinical specimens of breast cancer, further narrowed the list of the candidates. Among them, the most frequently downregulated genes in tumors were NP_775756 and ZNF537, from the homeobox gene search and the genome-wide search, respectively. To our surprise, we later discovered that these genes belong to the same gene family, the 3-member Teashirt family, bearing the new names of TSHZ2 and TSHZ3. We subsequently determined the methylation status of their gene promoters. The TSHZ3 gene promoter was found to be methylated in all the breast/prostate cancer cell lines and some of the breast cancer clinical specimens analyzed. The TSHZ2 gene promoter, on the other hand, was unmethylated except for the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. The TSHZ1 gene was always expressed, and its promoter was unmethylated in all cases.  Conclusions/significance:   TSHZ2 and TSHZ3 genes turned out to be the most interesting candidates for novel tumor suppressor genes. Expression of both genes is downregulated.

Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy was performed for 107 patients who had total PSA (t-PSA) level of either >4 ng/mL with or without palpable nodule or ≤4 ng/mL with palpable nodule on digital rectal examination. The performance measurements for f-PSA, percent free PSA (%f-PSA) and free PSA density (f-PSAD) were determined and compared with those for t-PSA and total PSA density (t-PSAD). Descriptive statistics for all variables of interest were calculated, and receiver operating characteristic curves were generated. Nine patients (8.4%) had normal histology, 69 patients (64.4%) had benign disease and 29 patients (27.1%) had prostate cancer. The performance of f-PSA in PCa detection was better than other evaluated parameters. The largest area under the curve for patients in the gray area (t-PSA range 4.1-10 ng/mL) was for f-PSA, with a value of 0.64 and a sensitivity and specificity of 44% and 87%, respectively. For %f-PSA, these values were 0.59, 63% and 62%, respectively. For patients with a t-PSA level of 10.1-20 ng/mL, they were 0.68, 67%, and 81%, respectively, for f-PSA, and 0.64, 67%, and 76%, respectively, for %f-PSA.

Results:   Over follow-up, 53,944 men and 24,475 women were diagnosed with a primary cancer. Compared with levels less than 160 mg/dL, high total cholesterol (≥ 240 mg/dL) was positively associated with prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.44; P trend = .001) and colon cancer (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.25; P trend = .05) in men and breast cancer in women (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.33; P trend = .03).

As a consequence, quantitative contribution of nonspecific accumulation in the target tissue, mainly governed by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, becomes highly relevant for evaluating the specificity of these new agents. This study investigated the influence of different tumor phenotypes on the EPR effect, hypothesizing that a baseline level of uptake must be exceeded to visualize high and specific uptake of a targeted macromolecular radiotracer.  Methods:   These preliminary studies use (89)Zr-labeled mouse serum albumin ((89)Zr-desferrioxamine-mAlb) as a model radiotracer to assess uptake and retention in 3 xenograft models of human prostate cancer (CWR22rv1, DU-145, and PC-3). Experiments include PET and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging to assess morphology, vascularization, and radiotracer uptake; temporal ex vivo biodistribution studies to quantify radiotracer uptake over time; and histologic and autoradiographic studies to evaluate the intra- and intertumoral distribution of (89)Zr-desferrioxamine-mAlb.  Results:   Early uptake profiles show statistically significant but overall small differences in radiotracer uptake between different tumor phenotypes. By 20 h, nonspecific radiotracer uptake was found to be independent of tumor size and phenotype, reaching at least 5.0 percentage injected dose per gram in all 3 tumor models.  Conclusion:   These studies suggest that minimal differences in tumor uptake exist at early time points, dependent on the tumor type. However, these differences equalize over time, reaching around 5.0 percentage injected dose per gram at 20 h after injection. These data provide strong support for the introduction of mandatory experimental controls of future macromolecular or nanoparticle-based drugs, particularly regarding the development of targeted radiotracers.""","""['Carola Heneweer#', 'Jason P Holland#', 'Vadim Divilov', 'Sean Carlin', 'Jason S Lewis']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Targeting the internal epitope of prostate-specific membrane antigen with 89Zr-7E11 immuno-PET.', 'Immuno-PET Imaging of CD30-Positive Lymphoma Using 89Zr-Desferrioxamine-Labeled CD30-Specific AC-10 Antibody.', 'Comparison of the octadentate bifunctional chelator DFO*-pPhe-NCS and the clinically used hexadentate bifunctional chelator DFO-pPhe-NCS for 89Zr-immuno-PET.', 'A philosophy for CNS radiotracer design.', 'Continuing pursuit for ideal systemic anticancer radiotherapeutics.', 'PSMA-Targeted Nanotheranostics for Imaging and Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of the EPR Effect in the CAM-Model by Molecular Imaging with MRI and PET Using 89Zr-Labeled HSA.', 'Exploration of 68Ga-DOTA-MAL as a Versatile Vehicle for Facile Labeling of a Variety of Thiol-Containing Bioactive Molecules.', 'Novel intraoperative near-infrared imaging strategy to identify abnormalities in the anterior mediastinum.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Deep Tumor Penetration of Polymer Nanocarriers.']"""

However, some of these markers are also associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, so it is unclear whether the polymorphisms are causal or if the association with risk is solely due to detection bias through PSA screening. PSA is a biologically active serine protease, cleaving insulin-like growth factor-binding protein. We examined the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KLK3 with prostate cancer risk, disease-specific survival and pre-diagnostic PSA levels in a case-control study nested within the Physicians' Health Study, which began in 1982, with over 27 years of follow-up. We genotyped SNPs spanning the entire KLK3 locus to capture common variation at high resolution. Six polymorphisms were significantly associated with prostate cancer incidence (P < 0.05); the odds ratios per minor allele ranged from 0.88 to 0.73. For four of these, the odds ratios were lower when restricting to cases diagnosed in the pre-PSA screening era (before 1989). The four alleles significantly associated with lower PSA levels were also associated with lower prostate cancer risk. KLK3 variants were not significantly associated with stage at diagnosis, risk of lethal cancer or survival. Our results suggest that detection bias due to the association of KLK3 variants with PSA levels cannot completely explain the association with prostate cancer risk.

However, during tumour development these Smad signalling-dependent endpoints are lost in favour of Smad-independent tumourigenic actions of TGF-β. In this working hypothesis we present an argument for an intimate association between the TGF-β signalling pathway and the actin cytoskeleton that acts to reinforce the tumour suppressive actions of TGF-β in the normal prostate epithelial cell. The rationale is that TGF-β induces expression of the actin binding and stabilising proteins transgelin and tropomyosin. Expression of these proteins is progressively repressed during PCa development, and is inhibited by constitutive activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway, also known to antagonise TGF-β tumour suppression in PCa. The subsequent de-stabilisation of the actin cytoskeleton might, therefore, result in suppression of TGF-β/Smad signalling as an intact link between cytoskeleton and TGF-β receptor/Smad complex is essential. Filamin A is a scaffold protein that provides this link for receptor associated Smads. It is required for activation of the TGF-β signal transduction pathway. Thus, actin filament disorganisation would prevent Filamin A/R-Smad mediated TGF-β signalling, a subsequent loss of tumour suppression and hence promote the progression of PCa. Furthermore, it could be one mechanism by which the switch to a TGF-β tumourigenic response occurs.""","""['Stephen Assinder', 'Nicholas Cole']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Hypotheses""","""['Disruption of transforming growth factor beta signaling and profibrotic responses in normal skin fibroblasts by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.', 'Sustained TGF beta exposure suppresses Smad and non-Smad signalling in mammary epithelial cells, leading to EMT and inhibition of growth arrest and apoptosis.', 'TGF-beta/Smad in prostate cancer: an update.', 'ELAC2, a putative prostate cancer susceptibility gene product, potentiates TGF-beta/Smad-induced growth arrest of prostate cells.', 'The dynamic roles of TGF-β in cancer.', 'Emerging players in prostate cancer: long non-coding RNAs.', 'Caffeine and rolipram affect Smad signalling and TGF-β1 stimulated CTGF and transgelin expression in lung epithelial cells.', 'In silico functional profiling of individual prostate cancer tumors: many genes, few functions.']"""

We elucidated what to our knowledge is a novel mechanism to highlight its potential in chemotherapy for prostate cancer, particularly androgen refractory prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Several pharmacological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the apoptotic signaling pathways of costunolide (ChromaDex™) in prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Costunolide showed effective antiproliferative activity against hormone dependent (LNCaP) and independent (PC-3 and DU-145) prostate cancer cells (ATCC®) by sulforhodamine B assay, clonogenic test and flow cytometric analysis of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester labeling. In PC-3 cells data showed that costunolide induced a rapid overload of nuclear Ca(2+), DNA damage response and ATR phosphorylation. Costunolide induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest, which was supported by p21 up-regulation and its association with the cyclin dependent kinase 2/cyclin E complex. The association resulted in inhibition of the complex activity and inhibition of Rb phosphorylation. Costunolide mediated effects were substantially inhibited by glutathione, the reactive oxygen species scavenger and glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine, and the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM other than the reactive oxygen species scavenger Trolox®. This indicated the crucial role of intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and thiol depletion but not of reactive oxygen species production in apoptotic signaling.  Conclusions:   Data suggest that costunolide induces the depletion of intracellular thiols and overload of nuclear Ca(2+) that cause DNA damage and p21 up-regulation.

At 10 yr after SRP, BCR-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and cancer-specific survival (CSS) probabilities were 37% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31-43), 77% (95% CI, 71-82), and 83% (95% CI, 76-88), respectively. On preoperative multivariable analysis, pre-SRP PSA and Gleason score at postradiation prostate biopsy predicted BCR (p = 0.022; global p < 0.001) and metastasis (p = 0.022; global p < 0.001). On postoperative multivariable analysis, pre-SRP PSA and pathologic Gleason score at SRP predicted BCR (p = 0.014; global p < 0.001) and metastasis (p < 0.001; global p < 0.001). Lymph node involvement (LNI) also predicted metastasis (p = 0.017). The main limitations of this study are its retrospective design and the follow-up period.  Conclusions:   In a select group of patients who underwent SRP for radiation-recurrent PCa, freedom from clinical metastasis was observed in >75% of patients 10 yr after surgery. Patients with lower pre-SRP PSA levels and lower postradiation prostate biopsy Gleason score have the highest probability of cure from SRP.""","""['Daher C Chade', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Angel M Cronin', 'Caroline J Savage', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Michael L Blute', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Hendrik Van Poppel', 'Steven Joniau', 'Guilherme Godoy', 'Antonio Hurtado-Coll', 'Martin E Gleave', ""Marcos Dall'Oglio"", 'Miguel Srougi', 'Peter T Scardino', 'James A Eastham']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Salvage radical prostatectomy in 2011: an established therapeutic option?', 'Re: Daher C.

We determined whether histological findings of inflammation in initial biopsy specimens and/or clinical indicators of inflammation could predict the outcome of subsequent biopsy in men with a negative initial biopsy.  Materials and methods:   A total of 105 Japanese men with increased prostate specific antigen underwent repeat prostate biopsy after initial biopsy revealed no evidence of carcinoma. Of the cases 45 (42.8%) were positive for prostate cancer at repeat biopsy. We evaluated initial biopsy specimens for evidence of inflammation by mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, serum and urinary white blood count, and C-reactive protein.  Results:   Polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrates, urinary white blood count, patient age, prostate specific antigen at repeat biopsy, prostate volume, prostate specific antigen velocity and prostate specific antigen density were associated with the repeat biopsy outcome (p <0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that age, prostate specific antigen density and urinary white blood count were independent predictors of outcome. On subgroup analysis of 63 men with serum prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml before initial biopsy polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocyte inflammation, age, prostate specific antigen at repeat biopsy, prostate volume, prostate specific antigen velocity and prostate specific antigen density were associated with the outcome of repeat biopsy (p <0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrate, prostate specific antigen density and age were independent predictors.

Inhibition of bone resorption is effective in reducing tumor burden and bone destruction in prostate cancer. However, whether drugs that inhibit osteoclast function inhibit tumor growth independent of inhibition of bone resorption is unclear. Calcium is released during bone resorption and the calcium sensing receptor is an important regulator of cancer cell proliferation. The goal of this investigation was to elucidate the role of calcium released during bone resorption and to determine the impact of drugs which suppress bone resorption on tumor growth in bone. To compare tumor growth in a skeletal versus non-skeletal site, equal numbers of canine prostate cancer cells expressing luciferase (ACE-1(luc)) were inoculated into a simple collagen matrix, neonatal mouse vertebrae (vossicles), human de-proteinized bone, or a mineralized collagen matrix. Implants were placed subcutaneously into athymic mice. Luciferase activity was used to track tumor growth weekly, and at one month tumors were dissected for histologic analysis. Luciferase activity and tumor size were greater in vossicles, de-proteinized bone and mineralized collagen matrix versus non-mineralized collagen implants. The human osteoblastic prostate carcinoma cell line C4-2b also grew better in a mineral rich environment with a greater proliferation of C4-2b cells reflected by Ki-67 staining. Zoledronic acid (ZA), a bisphosphonate, and recombinant OPG-Fc, a RANKL inhibitor, were administered to mice bearing vertebral implants (vossicles) containing ACE-1 osteoblastic prostate cancer cells. Vossicles or collagen matrices were seeded with ACE-1(luc) cells subcutaneously in athymic mice (2 vossicles, 2 collagen implants/mouse). Mice received ZA (5 μg/mouse, twice/week), (OPG-Fc at 10mg/kg, 3 times/week) or vehicle, and luciferase activity was measured weekly. Histologic analysis of the tumors, vossicles and endogenous bones and serum biochemistry were performed. Antiresorptive administration was associated with decreased serum TRAP5b, reduced osteoclast numbers, and increased tibia and vossicle bone areas. ZA significantly decreased bone marrow calcium concentrations without affecting serum calcium. ZA and OPG-Fc significantly inhibited tumor growth in bone but not in collagen implants. In conclusion, the inhibitory effects of ZA or OPG-Fc on prostate tumor growth in bone are mediated via blocking bone resorption and calcium release from bone.""","""['Xin Li', 'Jinhui Liao', 'Serk In Park', 'Amy J Koh', 'William D Sadler', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Thomas J Rosol', 'Laurie K McCauley']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Bone""","""['Zoledronic acid decreased osteolysis but not bone metastasis in a nude mouse model of canine prostate cancer with mixed bone lesions.', 'The effect of zoledronic acid and osteoprotegerin on growth of human lung cancer in the tibias of nude mice.', 'Comparison of Fc-osteoprotegerin and zoledronic acid activities suggests that zoledronic acid inhibits prostate cancer in bone by indirect mechanisms.', 'Preclinical studies with zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates: impact on the bone microenvironment.', 'Direct and indirect anticancer activity of bisphosphonates: a brief review of published literature.', 'Oral Exposure to ZnO Nanoparticles Disrupt the Structure of Bone in Young Rats via the OPG/RANK/RANKL/IGF-1 Pathway.', 'Macrophages Facilitate Resistance to Anti-VEGF Therapy by Altered VEGFR Expression.', 'Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) promotes EMT, growth, and invasion in canine prostate cancer.', 'Animal Models of Bone Metastasis.', 'Current treatments and novel therapeutic targets for castration resistant prostate cancer with bone metastasis.']"""

Objective:   To validate the performance of magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of the prostate at 3 T for the purpose of assessing tumour aggressiveness based on the ratio of choline plus creatine to citrate (Cho+Cr/Cit) and of choline to creatine (Cho/Cr), using the Gleason score of the radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen as the gold standard.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 43 biopsy-proven PCa patients with 53 clinically relevant tumour foci were retrospectively included in this study.  Measurements:   Patients underwent MR imaging and MRSI examination followed by RP. From MRSI, all spectroscopy voxels containing tumour were selected by a radiologist guided by the prostatectomy histopathology map only. For each tumour, two spectroscopists determined the maximum Cho+Cr/Cit, Cho/Cr, and malignancy rating using a standardised threshold approach, incorporating both metabolic ratios. The maximum Cho+Cr/Cit, Cho/Cr, and malignancy ratings showed a relation to tumour aggressiveness and so were used to differentiate among tumour aggressiveness classes.  Results and limitations:   The maximum Cho+Cr/Cit ratio, maximum Cho/Cr ratio, and malignancy rating of a standardised threshold approach separated low-grade from higher-grade tumours, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 0.70, 0.74, and 0.78, respectively.

However, the validity of this approach for reporting functional outcomes has not been established. Therefore, we determined the prognostic value of administrative claims data for reporting urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We identified 562 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2004 to 2007 and were followed at our institution with self-reported standardized survey data available at least 1 year after surgery. Urinary incontinence was assessed by self-reported pad use and the urinary function domain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index. Erectile dysfunction was assessed with the International Index of Erectile Function. These results were then compared with administrative claims data using ICD-9 and Hospital International Classification of Diseases Adapted codes for urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.  Results:   Administrative claims data demonstrated a poor correlation with patient self-reported questionnaire data. The administrative identification of erectile dysfunction was associated with a sensitivity of 0.598 and a specificity of 0.591. Poor correlation was also illustrated by the low kappa correlation coefficient of 0.184. Similarly urinary incontinence was poorly correlated with self-reported pad use and the urinary function domain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (correlation coefficient 0.195).

We investigated outcomes in men with pT3b disease in the contemporary era.  Materials and methods:   The institutional radical prostatectomy database (1982 to 2010) of 18,505 men was queried and 989 with pT3b tumors were identified. The cohort was split into pre-prostate specific antigen (1982 to 1992), and early (1993 to 2000) and contemporary (2001 to present) prostate specific antigen eras. Of the 732 men identified in the prostate specific antigen era 140 had lymph node involvement and were excluded from study. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine biochemical recurrence-free, metastasis-free and prostate cancer specific survival. Proportional hazard models were used to determine predictors of biochemical recurrence-free, metastasis-free and cancer specific survival.  Results:   In the pre-prostate specific antigen, and early and contemporary prostate specific antigen eras, 7.7%, 4.3% and 3.3% of patients, respectively, had pT3bN0 disease (p >0.001). In pT3bN0 cases, the 10-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 25.8%, 28.6% and 19.6% (p = 0.8), and the cancer specific survival rate was 79.9%, 79.6% and 83.8% (p = 0.6) among the eras, respectively. In pT3bN0 cases in the prostate specific antigen era, prostate specific antigen, clinical stage T2b or greater, pathological Gleason sum 7 and 8-10, and positive surgical margins were significant predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival on multivariate analysis while clinical stage T2c or greater and Gleason 8-10 were predictors of metastasis-free and cancer specific survival.  Conclusions:   Despite a decreased frequency of pT3b disease, and lower rates of positive surgical margins and lymph nodes, patients with seminal vesicle invasion continue to have low biochemical recurrence-free survival.

Of these men 1,512 (23.5%), 1,710 (26.5%) and 118 (1.8%) underwent cross-sectional imaging (computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), bone scan and abdominal ultrasound, respectively. Radiation therapy vs surgery was associated with greater odds of imaging (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.68-2.35, p <0.01), while active surveillance vs surgery was associated with lower odds of imaging (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34-0.56, p <0.01). Associated with increased odds of imaging was median household income greater than $60,000 (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.11-1.79, p <0.01), and men from New Jersey vs San Francisco (OR 3.11, 95% CI 2.24-4.33, p <0.01) experienced greater odds of imaging. Men living in areas with greater than 90% vs less than 75% high school education experienced lower odds of imaging (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.6-0.95, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   There is widespread overuse and significant geographic variation in the use of imaging to stage low risk prostate cancer. Moreover treatment associated variation in imaging was noted with the greatest vs lowest imaging use observed for radiation therapy vs active surveillance.""","""['Wesley W Choi', 'Stephen B Williams', 'Xiangmei Gu', 'Stuart R Lipsitz', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Jim C Hu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Contemporary trends in imaging test utilization for prostate cancer staging: data from the cancer of the prostate strategic urologic research endeavor.', 'Surveillance testing among survivors of early-stage breast cancer.', 'Regional-Level Correlations in Inappropriate Imaging Rates for Prostate and Breast Cancers: Potential Implications for the Choosing Wisely Campaign.', 'Epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Cancers of the prostate, penis, and testicles: epidemiology, prevention, and treatment.', ""Understanding the multilevel determinants of clinicians' imaging decision-making: setting the stage for de-implementation of low-value imaging."", 'Characterizing and quantifying low-value diagnostic imaging internationally: a scoping review.', 'The cost, survival, and quality-of-life implications of guideline-discordant imaging for prostate cancer.', 'External Validation of and Factors Associated with the Overuse Index: a Nationwide Population-Based Study from Taiwan.', 'Health disparities and inequities in the utilization of diagnostic imaging for prostate cancer.']"""

Specificity to detect clinically significant prostate cancer may be improved by [-2]pro-prostate specific antigen. We evaluated [-2]pro-prostate specific antigen, free prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen using the formula, ([-2]pro-prostate specific antigen/free prostate specific antigen × prostate specific antigen(1/2)) to enhance specificity to detect overall and high grade prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We enrolled 892 men with no history of prostate cancer, normal rectal examination, prostate specific antigen 2 to 10 ng/ml and 6-core or greater prostate biopsy in a prospective multi-institutional trial. We examined the relationship of serum prostate specific antigen, free-to-total prostate specific antigen and the prostate health index with biopsy results. Primary end points were specificity and AUC using the prostate health index to detect overall and Gleason 7 or greater prostate cancer on biopsy compared with those of free-to-total prostate specific antigen.  Results:   In the 2 to 10 ng/ml prostate specific antigen range at 80% to 95% sensitivity the specificity and AUC (0.703) of the prostate health index exceeded those of prostate specific antigen and free-to-total prostate specific antigen. An increasing prostate health index was associated with a 4.7-fold increased risk of prostate cancer and a 1.61-fold increased risk of Gleason score greater than or equal to 4 + 3 = 7 disease on biopsy.

Materials and methods:   A cohort of patients undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer was identified from the urological oncology database at our institution. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine whether prostate specific antigen velocity, defined as the change in ln(prostate specific antigen) per year, is associated with biopsy progression, defined as a Gleason upgrade or volume progression on repeat biopsy within 24 months of diagnosis.  Results:   A total of 241 men with a mean ± SD age of 61 ± 7 years and mean prostate specific antigen 4.9 ± 2.2 ng/ml met study inclusion criteria.

It is unknown whether pelvic lymph node dissection is related to the development of venous thromboembolism. We hypothesized that omitting pelvic lymph node dissection may be associated with a decreased incidence of venous thromboembolism.  Materials and methods:   The records of 773 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon from 2001 to 2009 were reviewed for postoperative venous thromboembolism. All patients underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with or without pelvic lymph node dissection and had at least 3 months of followup. Generally only patients at increased risk for lymph node metastasis received pelvic lymph node dissection. Diagnostic studies were not routinely performed but were initiated for clinical symptoms of venous thromboembolism. Separately a meta-analysis of radical prostatectomy studies with or without pelvic lymph node dissection was performed to evaluate associations with venous thromboembolism.  Results:   Of the 773 patients 468 (60.8%) underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection, 302 (39.2%) underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy without pelvic lymph node dissection, and 3 were missing preoperative data and were excluded from study. Patients in the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy only groups were similar in age, body mass index and prostate volume, although they differed in pathological characteristics and operative time. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 7 of 468 (1.5%) patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection and in 0 of 302 (0%) who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy only (p = 0.047). Patients in whom venous thromboembolism developed had greater body mass index (30.8 vs 27.1 kg/m(2), p = 0.015) than those in whom venous thromboembolism did not develop. No patient had a symptomatic lymphocele. Meta-analysis of the literature demonstrated a significant association between venous thromboembolism and radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection compared to radical prostatectomy only (RR 2.15, CI 1.14-4.04, p = 0.018).

The hypothesis was confirmed, in that selenium supplementation raised activities for erythrocyte and plasma glutathione peroxidase as well as lowered values for plasma prostate-specific antigen.

Study design:   Case series.  Place and duration of study:   Department of Urology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, from January 2002 to December 2009.  Methodology:   Patients with pathologically proven superficial transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with minimal 2 years of follow-up were included. Their clinical presentations and management was recorded. Complete transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) was attempted in all patients. Tumour grading and staging was performed. Intra-vesical single instillation of Mitomycin-C was given postoperatively in selected patients. Cystoscopic surveillance was used to assess recurrence in all patients according to standard protocol. Metastatic work-up and biopsy record of follow-up TURBT was used to document progression in high risk patients. Results were described as simple descriptive statistics.  Results:   A total of 92 patients were studied. The median age of patient was 62 years, with male preponderance (88%). Hematuria with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) was most common presentation (47.8%), followed by hematuria alone (25.7%), LUTS alone (9.2%) and upper tract symptom in 1.8% of patients. Complete TURBT in first attempt was possible in 72 patients (78.3%). Multiple tumours were seen in 34 patients (39.6%). Intravesical mitomycin was given in 70% patients. Over-all recurrence rate of 68.4% was noted. Patients with TaG2-3 showed recurrence rate of 58.8% which occurred late with good recurrence free interval.

Unfortunately, many potential therapeutic advances do not fulfil their promise when subjected to randomized controlled trials. It is therefore highly desirable to speed up the process of evaluating new treatment options, particularly in phase II and phase III trials. To help realize such an aim, in 2003, Royston and colleagues proposed a class of multi-arm, two-stage trial designs intended to eliminate poorly performing contenders at a first stage (point in time). Only treatments showing a predefined degree of advantage against a control treatment were allowed through to a second stage. Arms that survived the first-stage comparison on an intermediate outcome measure entered a second stage of patient accrual, culminating in comparisons against control on the definitive outcome measure. The intermediate outcome is typically on the causal pathway to the definitive outcome (i.e. the features that cause an intermediate event also tend to cause a definitive event), an example in cancer being progression-free and overall survival. Although the 2003 paper alluded to multi-arm trials, most of the essential design features concerned only two-arm trials. Here, we extend the two-arm designs to allow an arbitrary number of stages, thereby increasing flexibility by building in several 'looks' at the accumulating data. Such trials can terminate at any of the intermediate stages or the final stage.  Methods:   We describe the trial design and the mathematics required to obtain the timing of the 'looks' and the overall significance level and power of the design. We support our results by extensive simulation studies. As an example, we discuss the design of the STAMPEDE trial in prostate cancer.  Results:   The mathematical results on significance level and power are confirmed by the computer simulations. Our approach compares favourably with methodology based on beta spending functions and on monitoring only a primary outcome measure for lack of benefit of the new treatment.  Conclusions:   The new designs are practical and are supported by theory. They hold considerable promise for speeding up the evaluation of new treatments in phase II and III trials.""","""['Patrick Royston', 'Friederike M-S Barthel', 'Mahesh Kb Parmar', 'Babak Choodari-Oskooei', 'Valerie Isham']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Trials""","""['Impact of lack-of-benefit stopping rules on treatment effect estimates of two-arm multi-stage (TAMS) trials with time to event outcome.', 'Flexible trial design in practice - stopping arms for lack-of-benefit and adding research arms mid-trial in STAMPEDE: a multi-arm multi-stage randomized controlled trial.', 'A multi-arm multi-stage clinical trial design for binary outcomes with application to tuberculosis.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Group-sequential methods for adaptive seamless phase II/III clinical trials.', 'Experiences of running a stratified medicine adaptive platform trial: Challenges and lessons learned from 10 years of the FOCUS4 trial in metastatic colorectal cancer.', 'Editorial Comment: Abiraterone in ""High-"" and ""Low-risk"" Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'How to deal with a temporary suspension and restarting your trial: our experiences and lessons learnt.', 'The design and statistical aspects of VIETNARMS: a strategic post-licensing trial of multiple oral direct-acting antiviral hepatitis C treatment strategies in Vietnam.', 'Adding new experimental arms to randomised clinical trials: Impact on error rates.']"""

Patients and methods:   Ninety-three patients underwent inguinal hernia repair during 2125 EERPEs performed between 2002 and 2008. Seventy-seven patients had a unilateral hernia and 16 bilateral inguinal hernias. Patients were treated with EERPE or nerve-sparing EERPE and pelvic lymphadenectomy (if indicated) for localized prostate cancer.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 63 years (range 49-75 years). Operative time was 150 minutes (range 85-285 minutes) and estimated mean blood loss was 240 mL (range 30-600 mL). Blood transfusion was never deemed necessary. No conversions to open surgery took place. The mean duration of catheterization was 6.5 days (range 4-25 days). One patient developed a pelvic haematoma, three patients had symptomatic pelvic lymphoceles, and one developed an anastomotic stricture. One patient suffered a rectal injury during the procedure and another developed deep venous thrombosis. The only complication of hernia repair was mild penile bruising and edema. During the follow-up period, we have never observed mesh infection or hernia recurrence.  Conclusion:   EERPE combined with either a unilateral or bilateral laparoscopic hernia repair appears to be a safe and effective procedure.

We previously demonstrated that ErbB3 is located in the nucleus of PCa cell lines and PCa tissues. It also was observed that ErbB3 nuclear localization could discriminate between benign and malignant prostate tissues as well as between hormone sensitive and hormone-refractory PCa. Several studies have suggested a role for clathrin-mediated endosomal sorting in the nuclear localization of EGFR and ErbB2 but the mechanisms by which ErbB receptors escape recycling or degradation are not well known. Consequently to determine the role of endocytosis in the nuclear localization of ErbB3, different endocytotic inhibitors and specific si-RNAs were used to discriminate between clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent pathways. We found that clathrin, caveolin, and membrane domains are not required for endocytosis-mediated nuclear localization of ErbB3 in PCa cells and we provide evidence that amiloride, a macropinocytosis inhibitor, and the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) are implicated in the compartimentalization of ErbB3. In conclusion, evidence for an endocytosis-based mechanism in the nuclear localization of ErbB3 in PCa cells is proposed.

Whether such a benefit exits in men with a protracted PSA rise in DT (≥ 6 months) is unclear and was examined in the current study.  Methods:   Of 4036 men who underwent RP at Duke University between 1988 and 2008, 519 experienced a PSA failure, had complete data, and were the subjects of this study. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate whether salvage RT in men with either a rapid (< 6 months) or a protracted (≥ 6 months) PSA DT was associated with the risk of all-cause mortality adjusting for age at the time of PSA failure, known prostate cancer prognostic factors, and cardiac comorbidity.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 11.3 years after PSA failure, 195 men died. Salvage RT was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality for men with either a PSA DT of < 6 months (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.53; P = .02) or a PSA DT of ≥ 6 months (AHR, 0.52; P = .003). In a subset of patients with comorbidity data at the time of PSA failure, salvage RT remained associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality for both men with a PSA DT of < 6 months (AHR, 0.35; P = .042) or a PSA DT of ≥ 6 months (AHR, 0.60; P = .04).

TRAIL is considered a therapeutic target, therefore, it was of interest to examine molecular mechanisms that may modulate sensitivity to TRAIL signaling in prostate cancer cells. LNCaP cells were found to be relatively resistant to TRAIL induced cell death while PC3 cells were sensitive. PI3-kinase (PI3 K) inhibitors were able to render LNCaP cells sensitive to TRAIL but conferred resistance to PC3 cells. PI3 K inhibitors were associated with an increase in p21(waf1, cip1) expression in PC3 cells where as p21 decreases in LNCaP cells suggesting that p21 may impart TRAIL resistance. Since androgen receptor (AR) signaling can be modulated by AKT, and p21 is an AR responsive gene, the impact of PI3 K inhibition on TRAIL sensitivity was evaluated in AR transfected PC3 cells (PC3AR). The expression of AR was significantly downregulated by PI3 K inhibition in LNCaP cells, which have an intact AR signaling axis. PC3AR cells expressed higher levels of p21 protein and were relatively resistant to TRAIL compared to control cells. Finally, using adenoviral p21 gene transfer we directly demonstrated that p21 can confer resistance to TRAIL-induced cell death. These results suggest that TRAIL resistance is not regulated simply by a PI3 K/AKT survival pathway associated with inactivating PTEN mutations but may also be modulated by downstream AR responsive targets such as p21.

Studied patients divided in groups regarding the preoperative risk for lymph node metastasis (low risk or not) and PSA density (≤.2 or greater).

Methods:   Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program for 2004 and 2005. Men with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who had complete staging information were included. Patients were stratified according to the D'Amico criteria into low, intermediate, or high-risk groups using clinical T-stage, Gleason sum, and prostate specific antigen.

Results:   A total of 56,446 patients were included, of whom 13,135 had a prostatectomy with complete pathologic staging. Of 3476 patients with clinically palpable disease, who underwent prostatectomy, 2.5% were down-T-staged pathologically, whereas 34.7% were up-T-staged. Replacing clinical T-stage with pathologic T-stage in the D'Amico risk stratification resulted in the majority of men being up-risk-stratified to a higher risk group.

However, the mechanism for this loss of function is unknown. In this study, we describe a population of tumor-associated DCs (TADCs) in both human and mouse prostate cancer that tolerizes and induces suppressive activity in tumor-specific T cells. In tumors from human prostate cancer patients and transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice, TADCs expressed elevated levels of FOXO3 and Foxo3, respectively, which correlated with expression of suppressive genes that negatively regulate T cell function. Silencing FOXO3 and Foxo3 with siRNAs abrogated the ability of human and mouse TADCs, respectively, to tolerize and induce suppressive activity by T cells. Silencing Foxo3 in mouse TADCs was also associated with diminished expression of tolerogenic mediators, such as indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, arginase, and TGF-β, and upregulated expression of costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines.

Importantly, increasing the niche size promoted metastasis, whereas decreasing the niche size compromised dissemination. Furthermore, disseminated PCa cells could be mobilized out of the niche and back into the circulation using HSC mobilization protocols. Finally, once in the niche, tumor cells reduced HSC numbers by driving their terminal differentiation.

Materials and methods:   Retrospective study carried out at an institution on 208 patients treated with radical prostatectomy (January 2007 - July 2010) in which the presence of perineural invasion and the Gleason score in the preoperative biopsy were determined, as well as the clinical stage and the pre-surgery PSA. We classified the patients in risk groups in accordance with the D'Amico classification. We performed bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses to establish the correlations between the different variables.  Results:   We objectified PNI in 18.3% of the prostate biopsies. 71% of the prostatectomy specimens with perineural invasion presented extraprostatic extension in the previous biopsy against 23.1% when this was not found (p<0.0001) and 47% of the cases showed positive margins with PNI, against 18.3% without perineural invasion (p<0.0001). In fact, in the multivariate analysis, perineural invasion proved to be an independent risk factor in the presentation of extraprostatic extension and positive margins in the prostatectomy specimen.  Conclusions:   The presence of perineural invasion is a useful prognostic factor for predicting extraprostatic extension and the involvement of surgical margin in the radical prostatectomy specimen.

CANT1 displayed predominantly a Golgi-type immunoreactivity with additional and variable cytoplasmic staining. In comparison to normal tissues, the staining intensity was significantly increased in PIN lesions and cancer. In cancer, high CANT1 levels were associated with a better prognosis, and castrate-resistant carcinomas commonly showed lower CANT1 levels than primary carcinomas. The functional role of CANT1 was investigated using RNA interference in two prostate cancer cell lines with abundant endogenous CANT1 protein. On CANT1 knockdown, a significantly diminished cell number and DNA synthesis rate, a cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase, and a strong decrease of cell transmigration rate and wound healing capacity of CANT1 knockdown cells was found. However, on forced CANT1 overexpression, cell proliferation and migration remained unchanged. In summary, CANT1 is commonly overexpressed in the vast majority of primary prostate carcinomas and in the precursor lesion PIN and may represent a novel prognostic biomarker.

In prostate cancer, nucleolar enlargement and increased numbers are some of the earliest morphological changes associated with development of premalignant prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions and invasive adenocarcinomas. However, the molecular mechanisms that induce nucleolar alterations in PIN and prostate cancer remain largely unknown. We verify that activation of the MYC oncogene, which is overexpressed in most human PIN and prostatic adenocarcinomas, leads to formation of enlarged nucleoli and increased nucleolar number in prostate luminal epithelial cells in vivo. In prostate cancer cells in vitro, MYC expression is needed for maintenance of nucleolar number, and a nucleolar program of gene expression. To begin to decipher the functional relevance of this transcriptional program in prostate cancer, we examined FBL (encoding fibrillarin), a MYC target gene, and report that fibrillarin is required for proliferation, clonogenic survival, and proper ribosomal RNA accumulation/processing in human prostate cancer cells. Further, fibrillarin is overexpressed in PIN lesions induced by MYC overexpression in the mouse prostate, and in human clinical prostate adenocarcinoma and PIN lesions, where its expression correlates with MYC levels.

Patients and methods:   •This investigator-initiated prospective single-arm study was approved by the institutional committee on human research ethics board. •The target accrual was 10 patients. Newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients with low risk disease either with symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy or deemed to require pre-brachytherapy androgen suppression therapy were eligible. In the latter group, dutasteride was used to achieve cytoreduction. •All patients received 6 months of dutasteride 3.5 mg daily and underwent baseline blood work, health-related quality of life indices and MRI/MRSI, which were repeated at 1, 3 and 6 months. •MRSI spectra were examined and scored as healthy or cancerous. The change in cancerous volumes over time was evaluated.  Results:   •Of the 10 patients enrolled, nine patients completed the entire study. One patient withdrew after 3 months because of drug-related toxicity. •Because a significant decrease in citrate and polyamines on MRSI spectra was noted at 1 month compared with baseline, healthy tissue appeared to be more like cancer and thus created a false impression that the cancer had grown after 1 month. To reduce this bias, comparisons were made between the 1-month and 6-month scans. •The median MR cancer volumes at 6 months and 3 months were 100% and 101% of the 1-month value, respectively. Three of the nine patients had a 30-45% decrease in cancer volume at 6 months relative to 1-month measures.

To further explore this finding, we have compared the cytotoxic effect of the red beetroot extract with anticancer drug, doxorubicin (adriamycin) in the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and in the well-established estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). This red colored anticancer antibiotic was selected for comparative cytotoxic study because its chemical structure with a planar configuration of an aromatic chromophore attached to a sugar molecule is remarkably similar to that of betanin, the beetroot extract constituent primarily responsible for its red color. Both doxorubicin and the beetroot extract exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect in the two cancer cell lines tested. Although the cytotoxicity of the beetroot extract was significantly lower when compared to doxorubicin, it continued to decrease the growth rate of the PC-3 cells (3.7% in 3 days vs. 12.5% in 7 days) when tested at the concentration of 29 µg/ml. In contrast, doxorubicin, at the same concentration level, completely inhibited the growth of the PC-3 cells in three days. Similarly, comparative studies in the normal human skin FC and liver HC cell lines showed that the beetroot extract had significantly lower cytotoxic effect than doxorubicin (8.6% vs. 100%, respectively, at 29 µg/ml concentration of each, three-day test period). The results suggest that betanin, the major betacyanin constituent, may play an important role in the cytotoxicity exhibited by the red beetroot extract.

To compare the sensitivity of T2*W EPI with routinely used T1-weighted turbo-spin echo sequence (T1W TSE) in detecting hemorrhage and the implications on sequences sensitive to field inhomogeneities such as MR spectroscopy (MRS).  Materials and methods:   B(0) susceptibility weighted mapping was performed using a 3D EPI sequence featuring a 2D spatial excitation pulse with gradients of spiral k-space trajectory. A series of 11 subjects were imaged using 3T MRI and combination endorectal (ER) and six-channel phased array cardiac coils. T1W TSE and T2*W EPI sequences were analyzed quantitatively for hemorrhage contrast. Point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS MRS) was performed and data quality was analyzed.  Results:   Two types of susceptibility variation were identified: hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic T2*W-positive areas. Post-biopsy hemorrhage lesions showed on average five times greater contrast on the T2*W images than T1W TSE images. Six nonhemorrhage regions of severe susceptibility artifact were apparent on the T2*W images that were not seen on standard T1W or T2W images. All nonhemorrhagic susceptibility artifact regions demonstrated compromised spectral quality on 3D MRS.

We have previously shown that AR breakdown correlates with the induction of cancer cell apoptosis by proteasome inhibition. However, the involvement of AR in modulating the cell death pathway has remained elusive. To investigate this, we used an experimental model consisting of parental PC-3 prostate cancer cells that lack AR expression and PC-3 cells stably overexpressing wild type AR gene. Here, we report that both chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin) and proteasome inhibitors induced caspase-3-associated cell death in parental PC-3 cells whereas non-caspase-3 associated cell death in PC3-AR cells. The involvement of AR in modulating tumor cell death was further confirmed in PC-3 cells transiently expressing AR. Consistently, treatment with the clinically used proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (Velcade/PS-341) of (AR+) LNCaP prostate cancer cells caused AR cleavage and cell death with low levels of caspase activation. However, co-treatment with Bortezomib and the AR antagonist Bicalutamide (Casodex) caused significant decrease in AR expression associated with an increase in caspase-3 activity in both LNCaP and PC3-AR cells. Thus our results provide compelling evidence for involvement of AR in deciding types of tumor cell death upon cytotoxic stimuli, and specifically, blockade of AR activities could change necrosis to apoptosis in tumor cells. Our findings may help guide clinicians based on AR status in the design of favorable treatment strategies for prostate cancer patients.""","""['Michael Frezza', 'Huanjie Yang', 'Q Ping Dou']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Differential targeting of androgen and glucocorticoid receptors induces ER stress and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells: a novel therapeutic modality.', 'Antagonistic interaction between bicalutamide (Casodex) and radiation in androgen-positive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'The antiandrogen bicalutamide activates the androgen receptor (AR) with a mutation in codon 741 through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MARK) pathway in human prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'P53 and the proteasome regulate androgen receptor activity.', 'Androgen deprivation causes truncation of the C-terminal region of androgen receptor in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Histone Demethylase KDM7A Regulates Androgen Receptor Activity, and Its Chemical Inhibitor TC-E 5002 Overcomes Cisplatin-Resistance in Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'Specificity of Biogenic Selenium Nanoparticles for Prostate Cancer Therapy With Reduced Risk of Toxicity: An in vitro and in vivo Study.', 'Celastrol Induces Autophagy by Targeting AR/miR-101 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'AZD1152-HQPA induces growth arrest and apoptosis in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) via producing aneugenic micronuclei and polyploidy.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) positive vs negative roles in prostate cancer cell deaths including apoptosis, anoikis, entosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death.']"""

With this knowledge, the ultimate goal is to improve screening strategy. In this article, we focus on the study cohort of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), section Rotterdam. In all, 21,210 men were randomized to the screening arm of whom 19,950 were actually screened. The screening interval was 4 years. Men with prostate-specific antigen ≥3.0 ng/ml were recommended to undergo lateralized sextant prostate biopsy. The follow-up was complete until January 1, 2009. Of 19,950 screened men, 2,317 were diagnosed with PCa. Of these cancers 1,946 were detected in a screening round and 371 during an interval. The median follow-up was 11.1 years for the whole cohort and 7.3 years for men diagnosed with PCa. In total, we identified 168 escapes among 2,317 cancers (7.3%) within our screening cohort of 19,950 men (0.8%). More than half of these escapes were found in the initial screening round (94 of 168). Possible mechanisms behind escaping are nonattending, inadequate screening tests, the relative long screening interval, the age cut-off at 75 years, and undertreatment. International cooperation is crucial to compare the escapes of our cohort with other study groups participating in the ESCAPE-project which have different, more aggressive screening strategies. Subsequently, we can achieve improvements of the current screening algorithm, which hopefully will further decrease PCa-specific mortality without increasing overdiagnosis and overtreatment.""","""['Xiaoye Zhu', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Meelan Bul', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Fritz H Schröder']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Disease-specific survival of men with prostate cancer detected during the screening interval: results of the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer-Rotterdam after 11 years of follow-up.', 'Positive predictive value of prostate biopsy indicated by prostate-specific-antigen-based prostate cancer screening: trends over time in a European randomized trial*.', 'No reason for immediate repeat sextant biopsy after negative initial sextant biopsy in men with PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or greater (ERSPC, Rotterdam).', 'Overall and disease-specific survival of patients with screen-detected prostate cancer in the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer, section Rotterdam.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Variable metastatic potentials correlate with differential plectin and vimentin expression in syngeneic androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'iTRAQ identification of candidate serum biomarkers associated with metastatic progression of human prostate cancer.', 'Risk-based prostate cancer screening.']"""

As such, it is imperative to utilise aging formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from the pathology archive with linked patient outcome data to allow current day research. This study aimed to assess the adequacy and quantity of mRNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) prostate tissue, including prostate biopsies, up to 15 years old. The decay of mRNA over time and under differing storage conditions was also assessed.  Materials and methods:   Archived FFPE benign prostatic tissue up to 15 years old from transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and transrectal ultrasound guided (TRUS) biopsies as well as fresh tissue obtained from patients undergoing TURP for benign bladder outlet obstruction were used. Following mRNA extraction beta-actin real-time PCR was carried out using a set of 4 different primer/probes to assess mRNA quality and quantity.  Results:   There was no difference in mRNA quantity/quality extracted from ""fresh"" FFPE tissue from the same patient over a 4-month period following surgery. The temperature of block storage did not alter quality/quantity of the mRNA (P > 0.05, unpaired t test). Fresh tissue had a higher quality/quantity, indicated by a lower C ( T ) value, than FFPE samples from the same patient (P ≤ 0.03, one-way ANOVA). Despite being up to 15 years old, all archived FFPE TURP and TRUS biopsy samples had ""high"" or ""very high"" levels of expression making them suitable for further analysis. However, the quality of the mRNA in archived FFPE samples did significantly decline with increasing sample age.  Conclusions:   It is possible to extract mRNA of sufficient standard for further transcriptomic analysis from minute FFPE samples up to 15 years old. This work adds to the literature suggesting that exploitation of retrospective prostate tissue collections with robust associated clinical data is possible.""","""['Grant D Stewart', 'Jan Baird', 'Frances Rae', 'Jyoti Nanda', 'Antony C P Riddick', 'David J Harrison']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Quantity and quality of nucleic acids extracted from archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded prostate biopsies.', 'Reliable quantification of mRNA in archived formalin-fixed tissue with or without paraffin embedding.', 'Preparation of archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mouse liver samples for use with the Agilent gene expression microarray platform.', 'Excavation of a buried treasure--DNA, mRNA, miRNA and protein analysis in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues.', 'Factors that drive the increasing use of FFPE tissue in basic and translational cancer research.', 'In search of an evidence-based strategy for quality assessment of human tissue samples: report of the tissue Biospecimen Research Working Group of the Spanish Biobank Network.', 'Identification of mRNAs and lincRNAs associated with lung cancer progression using next-generation RNA sequencing from laser micro-dissected archival FFPE tissue specimens.']"""

If patients with a PSA value greater than 4 ng/mL should be considered for prostate biopsy, approximately 20% of all men undergoing test are considered for biopsy at the time of first early-detection examination.  Methods:   We have screened 2,592 asymptomatic men younger than 45 years. With a short questionnaire, we assessed age, body mass index (BMI), concomitant diseases, last sexual intercourse, and last bicycle riding. We compared this cohort with a group of 11,656 men aged 45-75 years from a nationwide prostate cancer screening trial.  Results:   In this cohort, only 4 men with a PSA value greater than 4 ng/mL and 10 with a PSA greater than 3 ng/mL were identified. More than 99% of all men younger than 45 years had a PSA lesser than 4 ng/mL. Sexual intercourse, bicycle riding, or BMI had a significant but minimal influence on the PSA value.  Conclusions:   It is reasonable to start with PSA testing at the age of 40 years. The advantage of screening younger patients is that almost no one should be considered for biopsy at the time of first early-detection examination. We identified a baseline value at which only a minimal influence was exerted by benign prostatic hypertrophy. In comparison with many current guidelines, we gained a lead time of 10 years for observation of PSA dynamics.

At the cell surface, sugar moieties of glycoproteins contribute to molecular recognition events involved in cancer metastasis. We have combined glycan metabolic labeling with mass spectrometry analysis to identify and characterize metastasis-associated cell surface sialoglycoproteins. Our model system used syngeneic prostate cancer cell lines derived from PC3 (N2, nonmetastatic, and ML2, highly metastatic). The metabolic incorporation of AC(4)ManNAz and subsequent specific labeling of cell surface sialylation was confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Affinity isolation of the modified sialic-acid containing cell surface proteins via click chemistry was followed by SDS-PAGE separation and liquid chromatography-tandem MS analysis. We identified 324 proteins from N2 and 372 proteins of ML2. Using conservative annotation, 64 proteins (26%) from N2 and 72 proteins (29%) from ML2 were classified as extracellular or membrane-associated glycoproteins. A selective enrichment of sialoglycoproteins was confirmed. When compared with global proteomic analysis of the same cells, the proportion of identified glycoprotein and cell-surface proteins were on average threefold higher using the selective capture approach. Functional clustering of differentially expressed proteins by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the vast majority of glycoproteins overexpressed in the metastatic ML2 subline were involved in cell motility, migration, and invasion.

Past ambient exposures to pesticides/fungicides were derived from residential history and independently recorded pesticide and land-use data, using a novel geographic information systems approach.

Design:   A retrospective population-based cohort study.  Method:   Data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry were used for this study. For all patients diagnosed with cancer in the Netherlands between 1989 and 2008, information on vital status was obtained from hospitals, municipalities and the Municipal Personal Records Database. Age-standardised, relative survival rates per cancer type were calculated.  Results:   The 5-year relative survival for all types of cancer combined increased from 47% in 1989-1993 to 59% in 2004-2008. This increase was greater in males than in females (from 40% to 55% and from 55% to 62%, respectively). The most striking improvements in survival were observed in breast, prostate and colorectal cancers, probably for reasons differing for each cancer type. Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia showed the greatest gain in survival (43%). Survival rates in older patients were generally worse in comparison to those in younger patients, especially in case of head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer and haematological malignancies. The survival gap between older and younger patients has increased over the last 20 years. The 10-year survival rate for most cancer types was not much lower than the 5-year rate, except in chronic and indolent haematological malignancies and cancers that may reoccur after a long time, such as breast and prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   The increase in survival rates of cancer patients in the Netherlands, attributed to early detection and improved treatment, could represent either an increase in the number of patients cured or to cancer patients living longer lives.

A subsequent study reported XMRV antigens in malignant prostatic epithelium and association of XMRV infection with PCa, especially higher-grade tumors, independently of the RNASEL polymorphism. Further studies showed high prevalence of XMRV or related MLV sequences in chronic fatigue syndrome patients (CFS), while others found no, or low, prevalence of XMRV in a variety of diseases including PCa or CFS. Thus, the etiological link between XMRV and human disease remains elusive. To address the association between XMRV infection and PCa, we have tested prostate tissues and human sera for the presence of viral DNA, viral antigens and anti-XMRV antibodies.  Results:   Real-time PCR analysis of 110 PCa (Gleason scores >4) and 40 benign and normal prostate tissues identified six positive samples (5 PCa and 1 non-PCa). No statistical link was observed between the presence of proviral DNA and PCa, PCa grades, and the RNASEL R462Q mutation. The amplified viral sequences were distantly related to XMRV, but nearly identical to endogenous MLV sequences in mice. The PCR positive samples were also positive for mouse mitochondrial DNA by nested PCR, suggesting contamination of the samples with mouse DNA. Immuno-histochemistry (IHC) with an anti-XMRV antibody, but not an anti-MLV antibody that recognizes XMRV, sporadically identified antigen-positive cells in prostatic epithelium, irrespectively of the status of viral DNA detection.

In this study, human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 and breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell lines were used as models to investigate the mechanism of action of atorvastatin, one of the statins. Atorvastatin was found to induce apoptosis in PC-3 cells at a concentration of 1 μM, and in MCF-7 cells at 50 μM. Initial survey of possible pathway using various pathway-specific luciferase reporter assays showed that atorvastatin-activated antioxidant response element (ARE), suggesting oxidative stress pathway may play a role in atorvastatin-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Among the antioxidant response genes, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was significantly up-regulated by atorvastatin. Pre-incubation of the cells with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate blocked atorvastatin-induced apoptosis, but not up-regulation of HO-1, suggesting that atorvastatin-induced apoptosis is dependent on GTPase activity and up-regulation of HO-1 gene is not. Six ARE-like elements (designated StRE1 [stress response element] through StRE6) are present in the HO-1 promoter. Atorvastatin was able to activate all of the elements. Because these StRE sites are present in clusters in HO-1 promoter, up-regulation of HO-1 by atorvastatin may involve multiple StRE sites.

While the Ets family gene, prostate-derived epithelial factor (PDEF), is expressed in epithelial tissues, PDEF protein expression has been found to be reduced or lost during cancer progression. The goal of this study was to examine the mechanism for and biologic impact of altered PDEF expression in prostate cancer.  Methods:   PDEF protein expression of prostate specimens was examined by immunohistochemistry. RNA and protein expression in cell lines were measured by q-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Cellular growth was determined by quantifying viable and apoptotic cells over time. Cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry. Migration and invasion were determined by transwell assays. PDEF promoter occupancy was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).  Results:   While normal prostate epithelium expresses PDEF mRNA and protein, tumors show no or decreased PDEF protein expression. Re-expression of PDEF in prostate cancer cells inhibits cell growth. PDEF expression is inversely correlated with survivin, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and slug expression and ChIP studies identify survivin and uPA as direct transcriptional targets of PDEF. This study also shows that PDEF expression is regulated via a functional microRNA-204 (miR-204) binding site within the 3'UTR. Furthermore, we demonstrate the biologic significance of miR-204 expression and that miR-204 is over-expressed in human prostate cancer specimens.  Conclusions:   Collectively, the reported studies demonstrate that PDEF is a negative regulator of tumor progression and that the miR-204-PDEF regulatory axis contributes to PDEF protein loss and resultant cancer progression.""","""['David P Turner', 'Victoria J Findlay', 'Omar Moussa', 'Victor I Semenchenko', 'Patricia M Watson', 'Amanda C LaRue', 'Mohamed M Desouki', 'Mostafa Fraig', 'Dennis K Watson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['PDEF is a negative regulator of colon cancer cell growth and migration.', 'Upregulation of prostate-derived Ets factor by luteolin causes inhibition of cell proliferation and cell invasion in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Loss of PDEF, a prostate-derived Ets factor is associated with aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer: regulation of MMP 9 by PDEF.', 'Prostate derived ETS factor (PDEF): a putative tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'Signatures of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) in cancer.', 'ETS transcription factor ELF3 (ESE-1) is a cell cycle regulator in benign and malignant prostate.', 'miR-486-3p, miR-139-5p, and miR-21 as Biomarkers for the Detection of Oral Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'BIRC3 and BIRC5: multi-faceted inhibitors in cancer.', 'Serum microRNA-204 levels are associated with long-term cardiovascular disease risk based on the Framingham risk score in patients with type 2 diabetes: results from an observational study.', 'Double Agent: SPDEF Gene with Both Oncogenic and Tumor-Suppressor Functions in Breast Cancer.']"""

The goal of this study is to generate a comprehensive expression signature of AR variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and to address the relative importance of the individual variants in conferring the castration-resistant phenotype.  Methods:   A modified RNA amplification method, termed selective linear amplification of sense RNA, was developed to amplify all AR transcripts containing AR exon 3 in CRPC specimens, which were profiled using tiling expression microarrays. Coding sequences for the AR variants were cloned into expression vectors and assessed for their transcriptional activities. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine their in vivo expression patterns in an expanded set of clinical specimens.  Results:   In addition to expression peaks in AR intron 3, a novel AR exon, termed exon 9, was discovered. Exon 9 was spliced into multiple novel AR variants. Different AR splicing variants were functionally distinctive, with some demonstrating constitutive activity while others were conditionally active. Conditionally active AR-Vs may activate AR signaling depending on the cellular context. Importantly, AR variant functions did not appear to depend on the full-length AR.

Patients and methods:   Consecutive adults with presenting with gross haematuria seen in our centre were studied prospectively between February 2006 and January 2007. All patients had detailed clinical and diagnostic evaluation including urine cytology, flexible/rigid urethrocystoscopy, ultrasonography and intravenous urography to determine the causes of their haematuria. Other special investigations including CT scan and tissue biopsies were only used in selected patients as indicated.  Results:   The cause of haematuria was determined in 74 patients (93.7%) while haematuria was of undetermined origin in 5 patients (6.3%). Fifteen different specific diagnoses were made as the causes of haematuria in this study. The three commonest individual causes of haematuria were benign prostatic hyperplasia (30.4%), bladder carcinoma (12.6 %) and carcinoma of the prostate (10.1%). Urological malignancies were diagnosed in 29.1 % of the patients. The Urological malignancies detected were bladder cancers (12.6 %), prostate cancers (10.1%), renal Cell Carcinoma (5.1%) and urethral Carcinoma (1.3%). The incidence of the cancers increased with age; 82.6% of the patients with malignancies were aged 50years and above while only 17.4% were below 50 years of age (P= 0.045). Urological malignancies were also more common in men (73.9 %) than in women (26.1 %) (P < 0.05).

In total, 610 prostate cancer patients received monthly degarelix (s.c., 240/80 mg, n=207, or 240/160 mg, n=202) or leuprolide (i.m., 7.5 mg, n=201) for 12 months. Data on hot flushes was collected as self-reported adverse events and in a subgroup of 254 patients with electronic diaries. The onset of hot flushes was faster on degarelix versus leuprolide, and was accompanied by higher median hot flush scores during the first 3 months. However, there were no significant differences in overall incidence rates and median hot flush scores over the entire 12 months. After the third month, incidence rates dropped below 6%, whereas prevalence rates remained constant in all the three treatment arms. In multivariate analysis, body weight and heart rate at baseline were independent predictors of hot flushes (P<0.05).

This idea was introduced in Otto's seminal VMAT paper, in which a coarse sampling of control points was used at the beginning of the optimization and new control points were progressively added one at a time. A different form of the methodology is also present in the RapidArc optimizer, which adds new control points in groups called 'multiresolution levels', each doubling the number of control points in the optimization. This progressive sampling accelerates convergence, improving the results obtained, and has similarities with the ordered subset algorithm used to accelerate iterative image reconstruction. In this work we have used a VMAT optimizer developed in-house to study the performance of optimization algorithms which use different control point sampling sequences, most of which fall into three different classes: doubling sequences, which add new control points in groups such that the number of control points in the optimization is (roughly) doubled; Otto-like progressive sampling which adds one control point at a time, and equi-length sequences which contain several multiresolution levels each with the same number of control points. Results are presented in this study for two clinical geometries, prostate and head-and-neck treatments. A dependence of the quality of the final solution on the number of starting control points has been observed, in agreement with previous works. We have found that some sequences, especially E20 and E30 (equi-length sequences with 20 and 30 multiresolution levels, respectively), generate better results than a 5 multiresolution level RapidArc-like sequence. The final value of the cost function is reduced up to 20%, such reductions leading to small improvements in dosimetric parameters characterizing the treatments-slightly more homogeneous target doses and better sparing of the organs at risk.""","""['Juan Pardo Montero', 'John D Fenwick']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A fast optimization approach for treatment planning of volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Efficiency of biological versus physical optimization for single-arc VMAT for prostate and head and neck cases.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological comparison of prostate VMAT plans optimized using the photon and progressive resolution algorithm.', 'Multicriteria optimization informed VMAT planning.', 'A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', '3D VMAT Verification Based on Monte Carlo Log File Simulation with Experimental Feedback from Film Dosimetry.']"""

In this paper, we propose a method for reducing the original NS in multileaf collimator segmentations to a user-specified quantity. The proposed method clusters original segments into the same number of groups as desired NS, and computes for each group an equivalent segment and an associated weight. In order to avoid important changes in dose-volume histograms (DVHs), equivalent segments and weights are computed taking into account the original fluence matrix and preserving the highest fluence zones, thus staying as close as possible to the original planned radiation. The method is applicable to unidirectional segmentations, where there is no backtracking of leaves, since this property facilitates the grouping of segments. The experiments showed that treatment times can be considerably reduced, while maintaining similar DVHs and dosimetric indexes. Furthermore, the algorithm achieved an excellent reduction/dose-quality ratio since the final NS was close to that reported for direct step-and-shoot solutions.""","""['X Mellado', 'J M Artacho', 'M Hernández', 'S Cruz', 'E Millán']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Reducing the number of segments in unidirectional MLC segmentations.', 'A novel unidirectional intensity map segmentation method for step-and-shoot IMRT delivery with segment shape control.', 'Is ad-hoc plan adaptation based on 2-Step IMRT feasible?', 'Clinical toxicities and dosimetric parameters after whole-pelvis versus prostate-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective.""]"""

Protocol-mandated biopsies were obtained after 2 and 4 years. After the discovery of three cases of biopsy sample misidentification in the first 2 years, all protocol-mandated biopsy samples were DNA tested to verify biopsy identity.  Methods:   Biopsy and blood DNA profiling was performed retrospectively for the year 2 scheduled biopsies and prospectively for the year 4 scheduled biopsies. Toward the end of year 2, multiple changes were made to improve sample handling and chain of custody.  Results:   Of the 6,458 year 2 and 4,777 year 4 biopsies, 26 biopsies reflecting 13 sample handling errors at year 2 (0.4%) and one biopsy reflecting one sample handling error at year 4 (0.02%) were confirmed to be mismatched to the patient for whom they were originally submitted. Of 6,733 reference blood samples profiled, 31 (0.5%) were found to be mismatched to the patient's verified identity profile. Sample identification errors occurred at local research sites and central laboratories.  Conclusion:   Biopsy misidentification is a potential problem in clinical laboratories and clinical trials. Until now, biopsy misidentification has not been studied in the setting of a large, multinational clinical trial. In the REDUCE study, process improvement initiatives halfway through the trial dramatically reduced biopsy mismatches. The potential for biopsy mismatches in clinical trials and clinical practice is an under-recognized problem that requires rigorous attention to details of chain of custody and consideration of more widespread DNA identity testing.""","""['Michael Marberger', 'John D McConnell', 'Ivy Fowler', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'David G Bostwick', 'Matthew C Somerville', 'Roger S Rittmaster']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Words of wisdom: Re: Biopsy misidentification identified by DNA profiling in a large multicenter trial.', 'Effect of dutasteride on the detection of prostate cancer in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Effect of dutasteride on prostate biopsy rates and the diagnosis of prostate cancer in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and enlarged prostates in the Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin trial.', 'The REDUCE Follow-Up Study: low rate of new prostate cancer diagnoses observed during a 2-year, observational, followup study of men who participated in the REDUCE trial.', 'Dutasteride: a review of its use in the management of prostate disorders.', 'Chemoprevention using dutasteride: the REDUCE trial.', 'Tissue contamination causing incorrect diagnosis of breast carcinoma metastatic to skin: An underrecognized complication.', 'Haplotype Counting for Sensitive Chimerism Testing: Potential for Early Leukemia Relapse Detection.', 'Guidelines on processing and reporting of prostate biopsies: the 2013 update of the pathology committee of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Markers for screening lynch syndrome are reliable and useful for identifying the specimen mislabeling.']"""

Our objective was to describe rates and predictors of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening among older men in the United States.  Methods:   Data were extracted from the population-based 2000 and 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). PSA screening was defined as a PSA test as part of a routine exam within the past year. Demographic, socioeconomic, and functional characteristics were collected, and a validated 5-year estimated life expectancy was calculated. Age-specific rates of PSA screening were determined, and sampling weight-adjusted multivariate regressions were fitted to determine predictors of screening among men age 70 years or older.  Results:   The PSA screening rate was 24.0% in men age 50 to 54 years, and it increased steadily with age until a peak of 45.5% among age 70 to 74 years. Screening rates then gradually declined by age, and 24.6% of men age 85 years or older reported being screened. Among men age 70 years or older, screening rates varied by estimated 5-year life expectancy: rates were 47.3% in men with high life expectancies (≤ 15% probability of 5-year mortality), 39.2% in men with intermediate life expectancies (16% to 48% probability), and 30.7% in men with low life expectancies (> 48% probability; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, estimated life expectancy and age remained independently associated with PSA screening (P < .001 for each).  Conclusion:   Rates of PSA screening in the United States are associated with age and estimated life expectancy, but excessive PSA screening in elderly men with limited life expectancies remains a significant problem. The merits and limitations of PSA should be discussed with all patients considering prostate cancer screening.""","""['Michael W Drazer', 'Dezheng Huo', 'Mara A Schonberg', 'Aria Razmaria', 'Scott E Eggener']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Words of wisdom: Re: Population-based patterns and predictors of prostate-specific antigen screening among older men in the United States.', 'Medical center characteristics associated with PSA screening in elderly veterans with limited life expectancy.', 'Clinician Factors Associated With Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening in Older Veterans With Limited Life Expectancy.', 'National Prostate Cancer Screening Rates After the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Discouraging Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.', 'Associations of Content and Context of Communication with Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing.', 'Use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in the United States for men age ≥65, 1999-2015: Implications for practice interventions.', 'Cancer Progress and Priorities: Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates and factors associated with screening in Eastern Canadian men: Findings from cross-sectional survey data.', ""Are We Choosing Wisely?

However, the pathophysiologic significance of endoglin with respect to prostate tumorigenesis has yet to be fully established. In this study, we addressed this question by investigation of endoglin-dependent prostate cancer progression in a TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate) mouse model where endoglin was genetically deleted. In this model, endoglin was haploinsufficient such that its allelic deletion slightly increased the frequency of tumorigenesis, yet produced smaller, less vascularized, and less metastatic tumors than TRAMP control tumors. Most strikingly, TRAMP:eng(+/-)-derived tumors lacked the pronounced infiltration of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) that characterize TRAMP prostate tumors. Studies in human primary prostate-derived stromal cells (PrSC) confirmed that suppressing endoglin expression decreased cell proliferation, the ability to recruit endothelial cells, and the ability to migrate in response to tumor cell-conditioned medium. We found increased levels of secreted insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP) in the conditioned medium from endoglin-deficient PrSCs and that endoglin-dependent regulation of IGFBP-4 secretion was crucial for stromal cell-conditioned media to stimulate prostate tumor cell growth. Together, our results firmly establish the pathophysiologic involvement of endoglin in prostate cancer progression; furthermore, they show how endoglin acts to support the viability of tumor-infiltrating CAFs in the tumor microenvironment to promote neovascularization and growth.""","""['Diana Romero', ""Christine O'Neill"", 'Aleksandra Terzic', 'Liangru Contois', 'Kira Young', 'Barbara A Conley', 'Raymond C Bergan', 'Peter C Brooks', 'Calvin P H Vary']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Coculture with prostate cancer cells alters endoglin expression and attenuates transforming growth factor-beta signaling in reactive bone marrow stromal cells.', 'Endoglin phosphorylation by ALK2 contributes to the regulation of prostate cancer cell migration.', 'Endoglin promotes transforming growth factor beta-mediated Smad 1/5/8 signaling and inhibits endothelial cell migration through its association with GIPC.', 'Endoglin-mediated vascular remodeling: mechanisms underlying hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.', 'Endoglin in angiogenesis and vascular diseases.', 'Endoglin and squamous cell carcinomas.', 'Correlation Between Endoglin and Malignant Phenotype in Human Melanoma Cells: Analysis of hsa-mir-214 and hsa-mir-370 in Cells and Their Extracellular Vesicles.', 'Tumoral CD105 promotes immunosuppression, metastasis, and angiogenesis in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Targeting Endoglin Expressing Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment Does Not Inhibit Tumor Growth in a Pancreatic Cancer Mouse Model.', 'Endoglin/CD105-Based Imaging of Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases: A Systematic Review.']"""

Analysis of human benign and cancer prostate tissues revealed heterogeneous loss of TGF-β signaling in the cancer-associated stromal fibroblastic cell compartment. To test the hypothesis that prostate cancer progression is dependent on the heterogeneous TGF-β responsive microenvironment, a tissue recombination experiment was designed in which the ratio of TGF-β responsive and nonresponsive stromal cells was varied. Although 100% TGF-β responsive stromal cells supported benign prostate growth and 100% TGF-β nonresponsive stromal cells resulted in precancerous lesions, only the mixture of TGF-β responsive and nonresponsive stromal cells resulted in adenocarcinoma. A computational model was used to resolve a mechanism of tumorigenic progression in which proliferation and invasion occur in two independent steps mediated by distinct stromally derived paracrine signals produced by TGF-β nonresponsive and responsive stromal cells. Complex spatial relationships of stromal and epithelial cells were incorporated into the model on the basis of experimental data. Informed by incorporation of experimentally derived spatial parameters for complex stromal-epithelial relationships, the computational model indicated ranges for the relative production of paracrine factors by each cell type and provided bounds for the diffusive range of the molecules. Because SDF-1 satisfied model predictions for an invasion-promoting paracrine factor, a more focused computational model was subsequently used to investigate whether SDF-1 was the invasion signal. Simulations replicating SDF-1 expression data revealed the requirement for cooperative SDF-1 expression, a prediction supported biologically by heterotypic stromal interleukin-1β signaling between fibroblastic cell populations. The cancer stromal field effect supports a functional role for the unaltered fibroblasts as a cooperative mediator of cancer progression.""","""['Maria A Kiskowski', 'Roger S Jackson nd', 'Jheelam Banerjee', 'Xiaohong Li', 'Minchul Kang', 'Juan M Iturregui', 'Omar E Franco', 'Simon W Hayward', 'Neil A Bhowmick']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Cross-talk between paracrine-acting cytokine and chemokine pathways promotes malignancy in benign human prostatic epithelium.', 'Prostate tumor progression is mediated by a paracrine TGF-beta/Wnt3a signaling axis.', 'Altered TGF-β signaling in a subpopulation of human stromal cells promotes prostatic carcinogenesis.', 'Transforming growth factor-beta in benign and malignant prostate.', 'Peptide growth factors in the prostate as mediators of stromal epithelial interaction.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer - microenvironmental roles of adipose tissue.', 'Fibroblasts as Turned Agents in Cancer Progression.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Heterogeneity, Activation and Function: Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'TGF-β controls stromal telomere length through epigenetic modifications.', 'Prostate Cancer Tumor Stroma: Responsibility in Tumor Biology, Diagnosis and Treatment.']"""

Transfection of the PC-3 cells with the Pmp53 plasmid in vitro offered significant inhibition of cell growth and an increase in apoptotic cell death compared with that of the Si-mdm2 or Pp53 group.

Methods:   A total of 212 consecutive patients with a mean age of 63 (range 45-74) years and clinically localised prostate cancer were monitored. Between January 2001 and December 2010, all patients underwent RPP that was performed by a single experienced surgeon at one institution. All data were introduced into a database focussing on the intra-operative and post-operative complications, continence rate, potency and oncological outcome.  Results:   The mean follow-up was 48 (6-117) months. Intra-operative complications, both early and late, occurred in 19% of the patients. The average length of in-hospital stay was 9 (3-45) days, and the mean period of time spent with a urethral catheter in place was 9 (4-45) days. The continence rate was 81%, and the potency rate, without any pharmacological aid, was 27%. The overall PSA-free survival rate was 86%. There was one cancer-specific death.

Results:   •Overall, 466 patients (28.6%) experienced an upgrade in their Gleason score post radical prostatectomy, in 88.4% of cases involving a change in a single Gleason score point. •Patients upgraded from Gleason 6 (3 + 3) to Gleason 7 (3 + 4) had pathological characteristics that were very similar to Gleason 7 (3 + 4) concordant tumours, with an identical risk of biochemical recurrence. In contrast, patients upgraded from Gleason score 6 (3 + 3) to Gleason 7 (4 + 3) had tumours with pathological characteristics intermediate between the two concordant groups, which was mirrored by their risk of biochemical recurrence. •Patients with Gleason 7 tumours who experienced a change in the predominant pattern from 3 + 4 to 4 + 3 had tumours that resembled Gleason 7 (4 + 3) concordant tumours, with a similar risk of biochemical recurrence.

This study investigated the incidence of independent non-urothelial second malignancies and associated risk factors in patients with NMIBC.  Material and methods:   The charts of 380 consecutive patients (297 men and 83 women) with newly diagnosed NMIBC over a 16-year period at a Swiss hospital were analysed retrospectively. Age, stage of bladder tumour, smoking status, and occurrence of second and third malignancies were registered. Observed incidences of independent non-urothelial malignancies were compared with age- and gender-specific rates based on data from the National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).  Results:   Mean age at first NMIBC diagnosis was 69.9 years. Histological stage of the NMIBC was pTa in 241 patients (63.4%), pT1 in 102 (26.8%)and pTis in 37 (9.7%).

A custom-made post-processing algorithm was used to analyze the MRI data sets and the results were compared to those obtained using a post-processing algorithm from In vivo Corporation (Dyna CAD for Prostate) applied to dynamic T 1-weighted images. Histology was used as the gold standard.  Results:   The sensitivity for prostate cancer detection was 78 % for the custom-made algorithm and 60 % for the commercial algorithm and the specificity was 79 % and 82 %, respectively. The accuracy was 79 % for our algorithm and 77.5 % for the commercial software tool. The chi-square test (McNemar-Bowker test) yielded no significant differences between the two tools (p = 0.06).  Conclusion:   The two investigated post-processing algorithms did not differ in terms of prostate cancer detection.

Results:   Indication for radiation included cervical cancer(n=22), prostate cancer (n=3), ovary cancer (n=2), rectal cancer (n=2), endometrial cancer(n=2), cervical cancer (n=1), and vaginal cancer(n =1). Data regarding radiation were available in 18 patients, and the mean dose was (61.3±12.9) Gy with a median dose of 61 Gy. Eleven were treated with enema therapy, 9 formalin dab, 12 surgical operations. Clinical improvement was noticed in 75% of the patients with a mean QOL score of 63.79±20.92. Prognosis was favorable in 75% of the patients. Surgical treatment was effective in 91.7% of the patients with severe complications.

Moreover, treatment of andrographolide to mice bearing castration-resistant DU145 human prostate tumors that express constitutive IL-6 autocrine loop significantly suppresses tumor growth.

The primary outcome variables were age- and sex-specific cancer screening behaviors.  Results:   Most of the AIs are men, married, educated, and with some form of health insurance. One fifth reported a family history of cancer. Adherence to mammography, Papanicolaou test, and clinical breast examination was higher in contrast to low rates of breast self-examination in women. Similarly, men reported low clinical testicular examination and fecal occult blood test, although prostate-specific antigen screening was higher than the reported rates among Asian Americans. Men were more likely to get a colonoscopy than women. The length of time in the United States had a relatively weak effect, and a family history of cancer had a moderate effect on screening behavior.

This observation strongly suggests that the AMACR enzyme may be a target for therapeutic inhibition in prostate cancer. To this end, we report here a novel assay capable of screening libraries of diverse small molecules for inhibitors of AMACR activity. This assay facilitated the screening of approximately 5,000 unique compounds and the discovery of 7 distinct chemical entities capable of inhibiting AMACR at low micromolar concentrations.

As a novel feature, miTALOS considers the tissue-specific expression signatures of miRNAs and target transcripts to improve the analysis of miRNA regulation in biological pathways. MiTALOS identifies potential pathway regulation by (i) an enrichment analysis of miRNA targets genes and (ii) by using a proximity score to evaluate the functional role of miRNAs in biological pathways by their network proximity. Moreover, miTALOS integrates five different miRNA target prediction tools and two different signaling pathway resources (KEGG and NCI). A graphical visualization of miRNA targets in both KEGG and NCI PID signaling pathways is provided to illustrate their respective pathway context. We perform a functional analysis on prostate cancer-related miRNAs and are able to infer a model of miRNA-mediated regulation on tumor proliferation, mobility and anti-apoptotic behavior. miTALOS provides novel features that accomplish a substantial support to systematically infer regulation of signaling pathways mediated by miRNAs.

We studied the clinicopathologic features of prostate cancer in Ghana, in order to determine the factors responsible for them and to find out if there is any relationship between them.  Method:   Patients referred with a biopsy proven diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate to the Cancer Center of Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana, from 2003 to 2007 were studied. Information with respect to age at diagnosis, presenting symptoms, initial PSA (iPSA), Gleason score, and disease extent were studied. Age was partitioned into 50-65 and >65 years, Gleason score into 2-6, 7, and 8-10, iPSA into 4-20 ng/ml and >20, and disease extent into T1, T2, vs. T3, T4, M1, and the relationship between them was determined. Various presenting symptoms were described. Known risk factors and screening in a context of high grade disease is discussed.  Results:   A total of 170 patients were studied. Mean age was 65.4 years. Majority of patients (73.7%) presented with an iPSA > 20 ng/ml, whilst 22 (14.1%) had PSA < 10 ng/ml. Gleason score ≥ 7 was found in 95 (56%) of patients. Asymptomatic patients constituted 24.0%, the rest had bone pain (22.6%), urinary (50.4%), and neurologic symptoms (3.0%).There was a statistically significant relationship between age and Gleason score (P = 0.049), PSA and Gleason score (P = 0.0001), and between extent of disease and Gleason score (P = 0.0002). High fat diet and low intake of fruits and vegetables are probable risk factors in Ghana.  Conclusion:   Majority of patients present with symptomatic disease at a relatively older age. These patients tend to have high Gleason score partly attributable to advanced disease, age, PSA at the time of diagnosis, and race.

Here we report the 10-year results.  Methods:   Between June, 1996, and February, 2000, 818 men with T2b, T2c, T3, and T4 N0 M0 prostate cancers were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone, 3 months of NADT plus radiotherapy, or 6 months of NADT plus radiotherapy. The radiotherapy dose for all groups was 66 Gy, delivered to the prostate and seminal vesicles (excluding pelvic nodes) in 33 fractions of 2 Gy per day (excluding weekends) over 6·5-7·0 weeks. NADT consisted of 3·6 mg goserelin given subcutaneously every month and 250 mg flutamide given orally three times a day. NADT began 2 months before radiotherapy for the 3-month NADT group and 5 months before radiotherapy for the 6-month NADT group. Primary endpoints were prostate-cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Treatment allocation was open label and randomisation was done with a minimisation technique according to age, clinical stage, tumour grade, and initial prostate-specific antigen concentration (PSA). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The trial has been closed to follow-up and all main endpoint analyses are completed. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12607000237482.  Findings:   802 men were eligible for analysis (270 in the radiotherapy alone group, 265 in the 3-month NADT group, and 267 in the 6-month NADT group) after a median follow-up of 10·6 years (IQR 6·9-11·6). Compared with radiotherapy alone, 3 months of NADT decreased the cumulative incidence of PSA progression (adjusted hazard ratio 0·72, 95% CI 0·57-0·90; p=0·003) and local progression (0·49, 0·33-0·73; p=0·0005), and improved event-free survival (0·63, 0·52-0·77; p<0·0001). 6 months of NADT further reduced PSA progression (0·57, 0·46-0·72; p<0·0001) and local progression (0·45, 0·30-0·66; p=0·0001), and led to a greater improvement in event-free survival (0·51, 0·42-0·61, p<0·0001), compared with radiotherapy alone. 3-month NADT had no effect on distant progression (0·89, 0·60-1·31; p=0·550), prostate cancer-specific mortality (0·86, 0·60-1·23; p=0·398), or all-cause mortality (0·84, 0·65-1·08; p=0·180), compared with radiotherapy alone. By contrast, 6-month NADT decreased distant progression (0·49, 0·31-0·76; p=0·001), prostate cancer-specific mortality (0·49, 0·32-0·74; p=0·0008), and all-cause mortality (0·63, 0·48-0·83; p=0·0008), compared with radiotherapy alone. Treatment-related morbidity was not increased with NADT within the first 5 years after randomisation.

The role of specialists in the management of advanced PCa is evolving in response to positive chemotherapy trials of PCa.  Methods:   Linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End results and Medicare data included patients with Stage IV PCa diagnosed from 1994 to 2002 who had visited a urologist after the diagnosis and received treatment. The visits and treatment were examined, comparing patients with and without PUMOH visits.  Results:   Most (77%) patients received treatment of their PCa and 85% of treated patients had a subsequent visit with a urologist, of whom 91% saw the urologist first (n = 5435). Of these, 43% saw only the urologist, 41% saw a medical oncologist/hematologist, and 32% saw a radiation oncologist. Of the 5435 patients, 16% received chemotherapy and the adjusted odds of chemotherapy receipt were 7.2 times greater (95% confidence interval 6.0-8.7, P < .001) among those with a PUMOH visit.

The identification of appropriate imaging targets has become the touchstone for the accurate diagnosis and prognosis of human cancer. Particularly, cell surface- or membrane-bound proteins are attractive imaging targets for their aberrant expression, easily accessible location, and unique biochemical functions in tumor cells. Previously, we published a literature mining of potential targets for our in-house enzyme-mediated cancer imaging and therapy technology. Here we present a simple and integrated bioinformatics analysis approach that assembles a public cancer microarray database with a pathway knowledge base for ascertaining and prioritizing upregulated genes encoding cell surface- or membrane-bound proteins, which could serve imaging targets. As examples, we obtained lists of potential hits for six common and lethal human tumors in the prostate, breast, lung, colon, ovary, and pancreas. As control tests, a number of well-known cancer imaging targets were detected and confirmed by our study. Further, by consulting gene-disease and protein-disease databases, we suggest a number of significantly upregulated genes as promising imaging targets, including cell surface-associated mucin-1, prostate-specific membrane antigen, hepsin, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and folate receptors. By integrating pathway analysis, we are able to organize and map ""focused"" interaction networks derived from significantly dysregulated entity pairs to reflect important cellular functions in disease processes.

Materials and methods:   From June 2006 to March 2009, 206 patients with head and neck cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, or brain tumor were treated using LINAC-based IMRT technique. In order to determine site specific DQA tolerances at a later stage, a hybrid plan with the same fluence maps as in the treatment plan was generated on CT images of a cylindrical phantom of acryl. Points of measurement using a 0.125 cm3 ion-chamber were typically located in the region of high and uniform doses. The planar dose distributions perpendicular to the central axis were measured by using a diode array in solid water with all fields delivered, and assessed using gamma criteria of 3%/3 mm. The mean values and standard deviations were used to develop the local confidence and tolerance limits. The dose differences and gamma pass rates for the different treatment sites were also evaluated in terms of total monitor uints (MU), MU/cGy, and the number of PTV's pieces.  Results:   The mean values and standard deviations of ion-chamber dosimetry differences between calculated and measured doses were -1.6 ± 1.2% for H&N cancer, -0.4 ± 1.2% for prostate and abdominal cancer, and -0.6 ± 1.5% for brain tumor. Most of measured doses (92.2%) agreed with the calculated doses within a tolerance limit of ±3% recommended in the literature. However, we found some systematic under-dosage for all treatment sites. The percentage of points passing the gamma criteria, averaged over all treatment sites was 97.3 ± 3.7%. The gamma pass rate and the agreement of ion-chamber dosimetry generally decreased with increasing the number of PTV's pieces, the degree of modulation (MU/cGy), and the total MU beyond 700. Our local confidence limits were comparable to those of AAPM TG 119 and ESTRO guidelines that were provided as a practical baseline for center-to-center commissioning comparison. Thus, our institutional confidence and action limits for IMRT delivery were set into the same levels of those guidelines.  Discussion and conclusions:   The systematic under-dosage were corrected by tuning up the MLC-related factors (dosimetric gap and transmission) in treatment planning system (TPS) and further by incorporating the tongue-and groove effect into TPS. Institutions that have performed IMRT DQA measurements over a certain period of time need to analyze their accrued DQA data. We confirmed the overall integrity of our IMRT system and established the IMRT delivery guideline during this procedure. Dosimetric corrections for the treatment plans outside of the action level can be suggested only with such rigorous DQA and statistical analysis.""","""['Jin Beom Chung', 'Jae Sung Kim', 'Sung Whan Ha', 'Sung-Joon Ye']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['A multi-institutional study for tolerance and action levels of IMRT dose quality assurance measurements in Korea.', 'IMRT commissioning: multiple institution planning and dosimetry comparisons, a report from AAPM Task Group 119.', 'Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'Biological consequences of MLC calibration errors in IMRT delivery and QA.', 'A six-year review of more than 13,000 patient-specific IMRT QA results from 13 different treatment sites.', 'Survey of patient-specific quality assurance practice for IMRT and VMAT.', 'A Risk-Adjusted Control Chart to Evaluate Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Plan Quality.', 'Commissioning an in-room mobile CT for adaptive proton therapy with a compact proton system.', 'The importance of accurate treatment planning, delivery, and dose verification.', 'A multi-institutional study for tolerance and action levels of IMRT dose quality assurance measurements in Korea.']"""

This conformity is achieved via 100s of non-coplanar radiation beams, which could potentially increase transitory testicular irradiation and result in post-therapy hypogonadism. We report on our early experience with CyberKnife SBRT for low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients and assess the rate of inducing biochemical and clinical hypogonadism.  Methods:   Twenty-six patients were treated with hypofractionated SBRT to a dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. All patients had histologically confirmed low- to intermediate-risk prostate adenocarcinoma (clinical stage ≤ T2b, Gleason score ≤ 7, PSA ≤ 20 ng/ml). PSA and total testosterone levels were obtained pre-treatment, 1 month post-treatment and every 3 months thereafter, for 1 year. Biochemical hypogonadism was defined as a total serum testosterone level below 8 nmol/L. Urinary and gastrointestinal toxicity was assessed using Common Toxicity Criteria v3; quality of life was assessed using the American Urological Association Symptom Score, Sexual Health Inventory for Men and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaires.  Results:   All 26 patients completed the treatment with a median 15 months (range, 13-19 months) follow-up. Median pre-treatment PSA was 5.75 ng/ml (range, 2.3-10.3 ng/ml), and a decrease to a median of 0.7 ng/ml (range, 0.2-1.8 ng/ml) was observed by one year post-treatment. The median pre-treatment total serum testosterone level was 13.81 nmol/L (range, 5.55 - 39.87 nmol/L). Post-treatment testosterone levels slowly decreased with the median value at one year follow-up of 10.53 nmol/L, significantly lower than the pre-treatment value (p < 0.013). The median absolute fall was 3.28 nmol/L and the median percent fall was 23.75%. There was no increase in biochemical hypogonadism at one year post-treatment. Average EPIC sexual and hormonal scores were not significantly changed by one year post-treatment.  Conclusions:   Hypofractionated SBRT offers the radiobiological benefit of a large fraction size and is well-tolerated by men with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

We investigated the antiandrogenic potential of an ethanolic total extract and one of its main aromatic components anthranilic acid. An androgen receptor-antagonistic (antiandrogenic) effect of the extract was evident, and although anthranilic acid itself revealed no remarkable effect, its methyl ester, methyl anthranilate, exhibited antiandrogenic potential. Based on this chemical structure, we synthesized and investigated the antiandrogenic activity of four AnA ester derivatives, which were either novel or only little described in literature. These AnA esters inhibit the androgen-dependent transactivation of both the wild-type (wt) androgen receptor and the androgen receptor point mutant T877A, which often occurs in refractory PCa. Moreover, they inhibit the androgen receptor-induced expression of the endogenous prostate-specific antigen. Importantly, AnA esters repress the growth of human PCa cells. Deletion analyses of androgen receptor propose that the antiandrogenic effect of anthranilic acid esters is mediated by the ligand-binding domain, most likely through direct binding, without affecting androgen receptor protein levels.

Methods and results:   Nuclear and cytoplasmic cyclin D1 expression was evaluated in 119 nodal-positive prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy. Cyclin D1 was correlated with various tumour features and biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). In the metastases, high-level cytoplasmic cyclin D1 expression independently predicted poor outcome (5-year bRFS, 12.5% versus 26.4%, P = 0.006; 5-year DSS, 56.3% versus 80.7%, P = 0.007; 5-year OS, 56.3% versus 78.7%, P = 0.011). These patients had a 2.62-fold elevated risk of dying from prostate cancer as compared with patients with low-level cytoplasmic cyclin D1 expression (P = 0.024). All other subcellular compartments of cyclin D1 expression in primary tumours and metastases were prognostically non-significant.  Conclusions:   The subcellular location of cyclin D1 expression in prostate cancer is linked to specific clinical courses. Survival stratification according to biomarker expression in metastases indicates an important role for tumour sampling from these tissues.""","""['Achim Fleischmann', 'Carla Rocha', 'Nikolina Saxer-Sekulic', 'Inti Zlobec', 'Guido Sauter', 'George N Thalmann']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Histopathological characteristics of lymph node metastases predict cancer-specific survival in node-positive prostate cancer.', 'Long-term follow-up of patients with prostate cancer and nodal metastases treated by pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy: the positive impact of adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'Re: Prognosis of patients with lymph node positive prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy: long-term results.', 'Role of pelvic lymphadenectomy in prostate cancer management.', 'Lymph node assessment and lymphadenectomy in prostate cancer.', 'Differential Expression and Prognostic Value of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Cyclin D1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Immunohistochemical expression of Cyclin D1 among Sudanese patients diagnosed with benign and malignant prostatic lesions.', 'The double dealing of cyclin D1.', 'Cytoplasmic cyclin D1 regulates cell invasion and metastasis through the phosphorylation of paxillin.', 'MUC1 is upregulated in advanced prostate cancer and is an independent prognostic factor.']"""

Recently, it has been reported that HDAC1 expression in prostate cancer is significantly higher than in benign prostate cell lines and tissues. The expression of HDAC1 in association with the clinicopathological data was investigated to define its functional and pathological roles in prostate cancer.  Methods and results:   HDAC1 expression was examined immunohistochemically in 148 patients with prostate cancer. Strong expression of HDAC1 in benign prostate glands, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostate cancer was observed in 17/148 (11%), 19/71 (27%) and 69/148 (47%) patients. Strong HDAC1 expression was correlated with high Gleason score (P = 0.025) and high pT stage (P = 0.012). Patients with strong HDAC1 expression had higher biochemical recurrence rates (P = 0.0010). Furthermore, strong HDAC1 expression had a significant impact on patient biochemical recurrence rates in multivariate analysis (P = 0.004).  Conclusions:   These results indicate that overexpression of HDAC1 contributes to progression and poor prognosis in prostate cancer. The findings may play an important role in the emergence of effective new approaches for therapy and prognostic markers of prostate cancer.""","""['YooHyun Song', 'Masaki Shiota', 'Sadafumi Tamiya', 'Kentaro Kuroiwa', 'Seiji Naito', 'Masazumi Tsuneyoshi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Androgen receptor expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer.', 'Overexpression of cysteinyl LT1 receptor in prostate cancer and CysLT1R antagonist inhibits prostate cancer cell growth through apoptosis.', 'Histone deacetylase 1 mRNA expression in lung cancer.', 'The canine prostate is a spontaneous model of intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer progression.', 'Histone deacetylase HDAC1 expression correlates with the progression and prognosis of lung cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Protein posttranslational modifications in health and diseases: Functions, regulatory mechanisms, and therapeutic implications.', 'Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid increases anti-cancer effect of tumor necrosis factor-α through up-regulation of TNF receptor 1 in lung cancer cells.', 'The role of dietary histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors in health and disease.', 'Mutagenesis studies of the 14 Å internal cavity of histone deacetylase 1: insights toward the acetate-escape hypothesis and selective inhibitor design.', 'Targeting Histone Deacetylases in Diseases: Where Are We?']"""

Patients and methods:   Consecutive 106 patients with prostate cancer who were treated with radical prostatectomy (62 with LRP and 44 with RALP) were included. The preoperative characteristics, the perioperative surgical outcomes, and the functional outcomes were compared between the two groups.  Results:   The mean operative time was longer in the RALP group (371 min vs 308 min, P = 0.00), conceivably because of more nerve-sparing procedures (84% vs 57%). The other perioperative parameters, including the surgical margin, were comparable, except for two major complications (rectourethral fistula and ureteral injury) in the LRP group. The RALP group recovered continence faster than those in the LRP, but the eventual continence rate at 12 months was similar (95% for LRP vs 94.4% for RALP, P = 1.00). The potency rate ≥ 6 months postsurgery was 47.6% in the LRP group and 54.5% in the RALP group (P = 0.65).  Conclusions:   RALP was beneficial for the earlier recovery of continence, although LRP and RALP had comparable safety and efficacy as minimally invasive surgery for prostate cancer when performed by a laparoscopic surgeon with intermediate experience. Long-term follow-up data are needed for further evaluation of oncologic and functional outcomes for both techniques.""","""['Jong Wook Park', 'Hye Won Lee', 'Wansuk Kim', 'Byong Chang Jeong', 'Seong Soo Jeon', 'Hyun Moo Lee', 'Han Yong Choi', 'Seong Il Seo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Preliminary results of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) after fellowship training and experience in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP).', 'Evaluating the learning curve of experienced laparoscopic surgeons in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: transition from pure laparoscopic to robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparascopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Positive surgical margin and perioperative complication rates of primary surgical treatments for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing retropubic, laparoscopic, and robotic prostatectomy.', 'Perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy previous transurethral resection of prostate: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative trials.', 'Robotic surgery in comparison to the open and laparoscopic approaches in the field of urology: a systematic review.', 'Generating comprehensive comparative evidence on various interventions for penile rehabilitation in patients with erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients: A System Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Health-related quality of life after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.']"""
