Patients and methods:   The uPAR forms were measured in samples from 131 metastatic PC patients. These constituted a subset of patients included in a randomized clinical trial of treatment with total androgen blockade (TAB) versus polyestradiol phosphate (PEP). Pre-treatment serum levels of intact uPAR (uPAR(I-III)), intact plus cleaved uPAR (uPAR(I-III) + uPAR(II-III)) and domain I (uPAR(I)) were measured using time-resolved fluorescence immunoassays (TR-FIAs).  Results:   High serum levels of each of the uPAR forms were significantly associated with short overall survival (OS). The prognostic impact was strongest in the TAB treated patients with all uPAR forms being statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, uPAR(I-III) + uPAR(II-III) was an independent prognostic factor in TAB treated patients (HR = 5.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5-10.6, P < 0.0001) but not in PEP treated patients (P = 0.40). In the entire study population, OS was similar in the two treatment groups. The survival analysis showed significant interactions between treatment modality and the level of either uPAR(I-III) or uPAR(I-III) + uPAR(II-III). High levels of uPAR(I-III) + uPAR(II-III) were found to be predictive of effect of PEP versus TAB treatment. Patients with uPAR(I-III) + uPAR(II-III) levels above the median had significantly longer OS (median difference 11.3 months), if treated with PEP rather than with TAB (HR = 1.8, 95% CI:1.1-3.1, P = 0.03).  Conclusion:   uPAR forms are significantly associated with OS. High uPAR(I-III) + uPAR(II-III) predicts longer OS in patients treated with PEP compared to TAB. uPAR forms are promising prognostic and predictive markers in PC.""","""['Charlotte E Almasi', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Peter Iversen', 'Helle Pappot', 'Gunilla Høyer-Hansen', 'Keld Danø', 'Ib J Christensen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prognostic significance of circulating intact and cleaved forms of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor in inoperable chemotherapy treated cholangiocarcinoma patients.', 'Prognostic value of intact and cleaved forms of the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor in a retrospective study of 518 colorectal cancer patients.', 'The liberated domain I of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor--a new tumour marker in small cell lung cancer.', 'Urokinase receptor variants in tissue and body fluids.', 'Intact and cleaved uPAR forms: diagnostic and prognostic value in cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer-PET Imaging Update.', 'Role of adipocytokines in endometrial cancer progression.', 'Circulating Forms of Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator Receptor in Plasma Can Predict Recurrence and Survival in Patients with Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder.', 'Fibrinolytic System and Cancer: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications.', 'The Association between Plasma Levels of Intact and Cleaved uPAR Levels and the Risk of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

While up-regulation of steroidogenic enzymes has been previously described during castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progression, regulation of this process is poorly defined. These data examine the role of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the regulation of steroidogenic machinery in PCA cells.  Methods:   PCA cell lines LNCaP, C4-2B, and 22RV1 were exposed to LH. Gene expression was quantified using real-time PCR and protein expression was characterized with standard Western blot analysis. Steroid analysis was performed using radioimmunoassay (RIA). Cell viability was measured using an MTS viability assay.  Results:   Androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -independent PCA cells (C4-2B and 22RV1) express both mRNA and protein for LH and LH receptor (LHR). Exposure of these cells to LH for 4 hr increased the expression of several steroidogenic genes. Exposure for 10 days resulted in the increase of additional genes. At both time points, the upregulation of these genes was dose-dependent. This was mirrored by an increase in the expression of several key steroidogenic enzymes, including StAR, CYB5B, CYP11A, and 3βHSD. LH stimulated the production of progesterone and testosterone in LNCaP cells as measured by RIA. We have also demonstrated that treatment of LNCaP cells with LH enhanced their viability.  Conclusions:   Our data show that LH-mediated activation of LHR significantly up-regulates the expression of genes and enzymes required for steroidogenesis and increases steroid production in PCA cells.""","""['Jacek Pinski', 'Shigang Xiong', 'Qingcai Wang', 'Frank Stanczyk', 'Debra Hawes', 'Stephen V Liu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Identification of EP4 as a potential target for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer using a novel xenograft model.', 'Valproic acid induces neuroendocrine differentiation and UGT2B7 up-regulation in human prostate carcinoma cell line.', ""Transcriptional regulation of the androgen signaling pathway by the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1."", 'Sex steroid hormone metabolism and prostate cancer.', 'Castration-resistant prostate cancer: locking up the molecular escape routes.', 'LHRH sparing therapy in patients with chemotherapy-naïve, mCRPC treated with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone: results of the randomized phase II SPARE trial.', 'A Review of the Pathophysiological Mechanisms Underlying Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Transgenic mice overexpressing the LH receptor in the female reproductive system spontaneously develop endometrial tumour masses.', 'Novel functions of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor in prostate cancer cells and patients.', 'Luteinizing Hormone Levels Relate to the Unfavorable Pathology of Prostate Cancer.']"""

This study evaluates GWAS SNPs associated with CaP in African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EA).  Methods:   Eight hundred SNPs were genotyped, including 32 from European-based GWAS and 35 flanking SNPs, in 417 AA and 455 EA cases from the NC-LA Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP) and compared to 925 AA and 1,687 EA controls from Illumina's iControlDB. The 32 GWAS SNPs were evaluated for their predictive power to discriminate between cases and controls using ROC curves.  Results:   Of the 32 GWAS SNPs, 13 were significant at P < 0.05 in EA and 4 in AA (rs6983267, rs7017300, rs1859962, rs6501455). Three of 35 flanking SNPs, all from chromosome 8q, reached study-wide significance (P < 3.5 × 10(-5)); 2 in AA (rs10505476 rs6985504) and 1 in EA (rs16901970). Among the remaining 656 SNPs, 2 were associated with CaP (P < 3.5 × 10(-5)): rs1472606 (OR: 1.43 in EA) and rs9351265 (OR: 1.48 in AA) both in intergenic regions. For the 32 GWAS SNPs, ROC plots yielded AUC estimates too low for clinical use (EA AUC = 0.60 and AA AUC = 0.56).  Conclusions:   This study confirms a large proportion of CaP associated regions implicated by European-based GWAS and provides evidence that some regions may be important in AA CaP risk. Despite the identification of a large panel of GWAS replicated SNPs for CaP, this panel is not appropriate for clinical screening.""","""['Zongli Xu', 'Jeannette T Bensen', 'Gary J Smith', 'James L Mohler', 'Jack A Taylor']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Genetic polymorphism and prostate cancer aggressiveness: a case-only study of 1,536 GWAS and candidate SNPs in African-Americans and European-Americans.', 'Genetic ancestry, self-reported race and ethnicity in African Americans and European Americans in the PCaP cohort.', 'Carotenoid intake and adipose tissue carotenoid levels in relation to prostate cancer aggressiveness among African-American and European-American men in the North Carolina-Louisiana prostate cancer project (PCaP).', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics: Recent Advances and the Prevailing Underrepresentation from Racial and Ethnic Minorities.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics Research Disparities in Africa: Advancing Knowledge in Resource Constrained Settings.', 'Race as a Contributor to Stromal Modulation of Tumor Progression.', 'Leveraging genetic ancestry to study health disparities.', 'Genetic variation in the Hippo pathway and breast cancer risk in women of African ancestry.', 'Genetic ancestry and prostate cancer susceptibility SNPs in Puerto Rican and African American men.']"""

Since it has been shown that very low concentrations of diphtheria toxin A (DT-A) result in abrogation of protein synthesis and apoptosis of cells, DT-A might serve as an efficient killer in cancer gene therapy. For this purpose we investigated in a quantitative manner using a stereological approach the apoptotic effect of DT-A in androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) expressing cells after tumor formation in both flanks of SCID mice.  Methods:   First, DT-A plasmid transfection was evaluated, using the lipid formulation DMRIE-C in C4-2 prostate cancer xenografts. After detection of an overall high rate of apoptosis by DMRIE-C alone, plasmid delivery was performed in a second study by electroporation. Finally this method was used to specifically target the AR and PSA expressing cell line C4-2 using pDT-A driven by a prostate specific promoter and enhancer (PSE/PSA). PC-3 cells, being AR and PSA negative, served as controls.  Results:   The experiments revealed evidence of a reduced growth rate of AR and PSA expressing C4-2 cells in vitro and in vivo compared to the AR and PSA negative prostate cancer cell line PC-3. The electroporation technology favored the response compared to DMRIE-C.

Markers that indicate the presence of metastatic disease would identify men who may benefit from systemic adjuvant therapy. Our approach was to analyze the primary tumors of men with metastatic disease versus organ-confined disease to identify molecular changes that distinguish between these groups.  Methods:   Patients were identified based on long-term follow-up of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels following RP. We compared the tumors of African American (AA) men with undetectable serum PSA for >9 year after RP (good outcome) versus those of AA men with a rising PSA and recurrence after radiation or androgen ablation or both (poor outcome). We used real-time quantitative PCR to assay gene copy number alterations in tumor DNA relative to patient-matched non-tumor DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue. We assayed several genes located in the specific regions of chromosome 8p and 8q that frequently undergo loss and/or gain, respectively, in prostate cancer, and the androgen receptor gene at Xq12.  Results:   Gain of the MIR151 gene at 8q24.3 (in 33% of poor outcome vs. 6% of good outcome tumors) and/or loss of the NKX3-1 gene at 8p21.2 (in 39% of poor outcome vs. 11% of good outcome tumors) affected 67% of poor outcome tumors, compared to only 17% of good outcome tumors.

Its finding predicts a distinct clinical course and a poor prognosis. Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is a much rarer variant that behaves similarly to SCC. The biological mechanisms that drive these disease variants are poorly understood.  Methods:   Eight tumor fragments from the salvage pelvic exenteration specimen of a patient with castrate-resistant prostate carcinoma were subcutaneously implanted into 6- to 8-week-old male CB17 SCID mice. Serial tissue sections and tissue microarrays of the resulting MDA PCa 144 xenograft lines were used for histopathologic and immunohistochemical characterization of the xenografts and their tissue of origin. RNA from two representative xenograft sublines was used for gene-expression profiling.  Results:   All eight fragments formed tumors: four of the MDA PCa 144 xenograft sublines had morphologic characteristics of SCC and four, of LCNEC. All retained high fidelity to their parent tumor tissue, which remained stable through serial passages. Morphological transitions in the specimen of origin suggested LCNEC represents an intermediate step between adenocarcinoma and SCC.

We previously reported that suppression of GSK-3 activity with lithium chloride (LiCl) or small chemical inhibitors impaired cellular DNA synthesis and reduced cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells. Therefore, in this study, we extended this in vitro findings to in vivo settings in order to establish a proof of concept that inhibition of GSK-3 activity is feasible in suppressing tumor growth of prostate cancer in vivo.  Methods:   In this study, we used three GSK-3 inhibitors, LiCl, TDZD-8, and L803-mts, which are structurally unrelated and non-ATP competitive. Human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and C4-2 were used for nude mouse xenograft models. The autochthonous transgenic prostate cancer TRAMP mice were used for testing GSK-3 inhibitor's effect on tumor development. Anti-Ki-67 and BrdU immunohistochemistry was used to determine cell proliferation. The pE2F-TA-LUC (E2F-LUC) luciferase reporter assay and gene specific small interferencing RNA technique were used to examine C/EBP involvement in GSK-3 inhibitor-induced E2F-1 suppression.  Results:   Using mouse xenograft models, we demonstrated that LiCl and TDZD-8 significantly suppressed tumor development and growth of subcutaneous xenografts derived from human prostate cancer cells. Similarly, in the TRAMP mice, TDZD-8 and L803-mts reduced the incidence and tumor burden in the prostate lobes. Consistent with our previous in vitro findings, GSK-3 inhibitors significantly reduced BrdU incorporation and Ki67-positive cells in xenograft tumors and mouse cancerous prostates compared to the control. Further analysis revealed that following GSK-3 inhibition, C/EBPα, a negative cell cycle regulator, was remarkably accumulated in xenograft tumors or in cultured prostate cancer cells. Meanwhile, knocking down C/EBPα expression abolished GSK-3 inhibition-induced suppression of E2F1 transactivation, suggesting that C/EBPα accumulation is involved in GSK-3 inhibition-induced anti-tumor effect.  Conclusion:   Taken together, these results suggest that GSK-3 inhibition has the potential as a therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer intervention, although further pre-clinical and clinical testing are desirable.""","""['Qing Zhu', 'Jun Yang', 'Suxia Han', 'Jihong Liu', 'Jeffery Holzbeierlein', 'J Brantley Thrasher', 'Benyi Li']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Akt GSK-3 pathway as a target in genistein-induced inhibition of TRAMP prostate cancer progression toward a poorly differentiated phenotype.', 'Cell cycle-independent death of prostate adenocarcinoma is induced by the trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor CEP-751 (KT6587).', 'Lithium suppresses cell proliferation by interrupting E2F-DNA interaction and subsequently reducing S-phase gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'Glycogen synthase kinase-3: a potential preventive target for prostate cancer management.', 'GSK-3 Inhibitors: A Double-Edged Sword? - An Update on Tideglusib.', 'GSK-3β Allosteric Inhibition: A Dead End or a New Pharmacological Frontier?', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Screening and Identification of Novel Potential Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Brain Metastases.', 'Transthyretin as a Biomarker to Predict and Monitor Major Depressive Disorder Identified by Whole-Genome Transcriptomic Analysis in Mouse Models.', 'Glucose Metabolism in Cancer: The Warburg Effect and Beyond.']"""

Selenoprotein-P (SepP; a protein involved in antioxidant defence) mRNA levels are down-regulated in PrCa. The main goal of our study was to assess whether SepP protects prostate cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS) in prostate carcinogenesis.  Methods:   Modification of SepP levels and ROS conditions in C3(1)/Tag-derived cell lines representing prostate epithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions (Pr-111, with high SepP expression); and invasive tumors (Pr-14, with very low SepP expression).  Results:   Both Pr-111 and Pr-14 cells express ApoER2 (SepP receptor), which suggests that they may uptake SepP. Pr-14 cells had much higher ROS levels than Pr-111 cells and were highly sensitive to H(2)O(2)-mediated cytotoxicity. When SepP mRNA levels were knocked down with siRNAs in Pr-111 cells, a significant increase in ROS and cell growth inhibition upon H(2)O(2) exposure was found. Subsequent administration of purified SepP in the culture medium of these cells was able to rescue the original phenotype. Similarly, administration of SepP to Pr-14 cells was able to reduce ROS concentrations. Administration of flutamide decreased SepP mRNA levels whereas dihydrotestosterone or synthetic androgens induced SepP expression, indicating the importance of androgens for SepP expression. Immunohistochemical analysis using a PrCa tissue microarray further revealed that SepP protein was reduced in 60.8% prostate tumors compared to benign prostates.  Conclusions:   Levels of SepP in prostate cells determine basal ROS levels and sensitivity to H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity.

However, the effects of bee venom on the prostate cancer and their action mechanisms have not been reported yet.  Methods:   To determine the effect of bee venom and its major component, melittin on the prostate cancer cells, apoptosis is analyzed by tunnel assay and apoptotic gene expression. For xenograft studies, bee venom was administrated intraperitoneally twice per week for 4 weeks, and the tumor growth was measured and the tumor were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. To investigate whether bee venom and melittin can inactivate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), we assessed NF-κB activity in vitro and in vivo.  Results and conclusions:   Bee venom (1-10 µg/ml) and melittin (0.5-2.5 µg/ml) inhibited cancer cell growth through induction of apoptotic cell death in LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. These effects were mediated by the suppression of constitutively activated NF-κB. Bee venom and melittin decreased anti-apoptotic proteins but induced pro-apoptotic proteins. However, pan caspase inhibitor abolished bee venom and melittin-induced apoptotic cell death and NF-κB inactivation. Bee venom (3-6 mg/kg) administration to nude mice implanted with PC-3 cells resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and activity of NF-κB accompanied with apoptotic cell death. Therefore, these results indicated that bee venom and melittin could inhibit prostate cancer in in vitro and in vivo, and these effects may be related to NF-κB/caspase signal mediated induction of apoptotic cell death.""","""['Mi Hee Park', 'Myoung Suk Choi', 'Dong Hoon Kwak', 'Ki-Wan Oh', 'Do Young Yoon', 'Sang Bae Han', 'Ho Sueb Song', 'Min Jong Song', 'Jin Tae Hong']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Anti-cancer effect of bee venom on colon cancer cell growth by activation of death receptors and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B.', 'Anti-cancer effect of bee venom toxin and melittin in ovarian cancer cells through induction of death receptors and inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 pathway.', 'Bee venom suppresses PMA-mediated MMP-9 gene activation via JNK/p38 and NF-kappaB-dependent mechanisms.', 'Bee Venom Components as Therapeutic Tools against Prostate Cancer.', 'Bee venom in cancer therapy.', 'An Updated Review Summarizing the Anticancer Efficacy of Melittin from Bee Venom in Several Models of Human Cancers.', 'Therapeutic Use of Bee Venom and Potential Applications in Veterinary Medicine.', 'Bee Venom Triggers Autophagy-Induced Apoptosis in Human Lung Cancer Cells via the mTOR Signaling Pathway.', 'Nutritional Composition, Health Benefits, and Application Value of Edible Insects: A Review.', 'Delivery of Melittin as a Lytic Agent via Graphene Nanoparticles as Carriers to Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are known to promote differentiation and inhibit proliferation. Previously published reports from other organ systems led us to investigate a mechanistic relationship between PTEN and BMP signaling in prostate epithelial cells.  Methods:   We analyzed growth rate and PTEN expression in E6, BPH-1, and C4-2B prostate epithelial cells treated with BMP-4. We also treated doxacyclin-inducible PTEN-C4-2B cells with BMP-4 and doxacyclin to determine the effect of BMP on growth and PTEN expression in conditions of increasing PTEN expression. We determined the dependency of BMP-mediated growth inhibition via siRNA knockdown of PTEN expression and BMP treatment. We determined PTEN protein stability by determining the effect of BMP-4 on PTEN protein at time points after treatment with cyclohexamide, a translation inhibitor.  Results:   We found that BMP-4 induces PTEN in E6 and BPH-1 cells and reduces proliferation. Knockdown of PTEN attenuated the growth-inhibiting effects of BMP-4 in these cells. BMP-4 had no effect in PTEN-negative C4-2B cells, but doxacyclin-driven PTEN C4-2B cells responded to BMP-4 with enhanced PTEN and growth inhibition. BMP-4 also increased PTEN protein stability.  Conclusions:   BMP signaling induces PTEN expression and sustains PTEN protein expression resulting in inhibition of prostate epithelial cell growth.

Another potential contributing factor is racial/ethnic differences in the timely and accurate detection of lymph node metastases. The current study was conducted to examine the association between race/ethnicity and the receipt of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) among men with localized/regional PCa.  Methods:   Logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds of undergoing PLND among men who were diagnosed during 2000 to 2002 with PCa, who underwent radical prostatectomy or PLND without radical prostatectomy, and who were diagnosed in regions covered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (n = 40,848).  Results:   Black men were less likely to undergo PLND than white men (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.98). When the analysis was stratified by PCa grade, black men with well differentiated PCa (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27-0.84) and poorly differentiated PCa (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60-0.89) were less likely to undergo PLND than their white counterparts, but racial differences were not observed among men with moderately differentiated PCa (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88-1.05).  Conclusions:   Among men with poorly differentiated PCa, failure to undergo PLND was associated with worse survival. Racial disparities in the receipt of PLND, especially among men with poorly differentiated PCa, may contribute to racial differences in prostate cancer survival.""","""['Matthew H Hayn', 'Heather Orom', 'Vickie L Shavers', 'Martin G Sanda', 'Mark Glasgow', 'James L Mohler', 'Willie Underwood rd']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Racial Differences in the Surgical Care of Medicare Beneficiaries With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Racial Disparities in the Presentation, Early Definitive Surgical Treatment, and Mortality Among Men Diagnosed with Poorly Differentiated/Undifferentiated Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer in the USA.', 'Racial treatment trends in localized/regional prostate carcinoma: 1992-1999.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'The Benefits and Harms of Different Extents of Lymph Node Dissection During Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Evaluation of Social Determinants of Health and Prostate Cancer Outcomes Among Black and White Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Race-specific prostate cancer outcomes in a cohort of low and favorable-intermediate risk patients who underwent external beam radiation therapy from 1990 to 2017.', 'Reporting of Racial Health Disparities Research: Are We Making Progress?', 'Health Disparities: Impact of Health Disparities and Treatment Decision-Making Biases on Cancer Adverse Effects Among Black Cancer Survivors.', 'Lack of Racial Survival Differences in Metastatic Prostate Cancer in National Cancer Data Base (NCDB): A Different Finding Compared to Non-metastatic Disease.']"""

Vav3 is a multiple function protein with both signaling molecule and coactivator activities. sPLA2-IIa is a downstream effector of HER/HER2-PI3K-Akt-NF-κB signaling and involved in inflammatory response and tumorigenesis. The aim of the current study was to determine whether Vav3 is involved in up-regulation of sPLA2-IIa expression, given that Vav3 signals in the HER/HER2-elicited pathway. Among 46 prostate cancer specimens examined, Vav3 and sPLA2-IIa are overexpressed in 48 and 83% human prostate cancers, respectively. Vav3 overexpression is significantly associated with a high level expression of sPLA2-IIa. In addition, significant Vav3 nuclear localization is observed in two prostate cancer specimens, supporting a coactivator activity in prostate cancer cells. Further analysis revealed that Vav3 up-regulates expression of the sPLA2-IIa gene at the transcriptional level via HER/HER2-PI3K-Akt-NF-κB signaling.

Four prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, 22Rv1, DU145 and PC3, were examined for their growth dependency on androgens and the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). We assessed the expression changes of certain growth factor receptors and regulating proteins when treated with 5-FU, and found that 5-FU increased the expression of the IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). Furthermore, 5-FU inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and p70 S6K, while the knockdown of IGFBP3 reduced the levels of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleaved by 5-FU in PC3 cells. Therefore, the up-regulation of IGFBP3 by 5-FU not only inhibits cell growth by reducing the IGF1 signal but also induces apoptosis in PC3 cells. The synergistic effect of bicalutamide and 5-FU on 22Rv1 cells was reduced by IGFBP3 gene silencing using small-interfering RNA. These results suggest that the up-regulation of IGFBP3 induced by 5-FU plays an important role in the potent anti-tumor effect of 5-FU combined with anti-androgens on CRPC.

This year's report highlights brain and other nervous system (ONS) tumors, including nonmalignant brain tumors, which became reportable on a national level in 2004.  Methods:   Cancer incidence data were obtained from the National Cancer Institute, CDC, and NAACCR, and information on deaths was obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The annual percentage changes in age-standardized incidence and death rates (2000 US population standard) for all cancers combined and for the top 15 cancers for men and for women were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term (1992-2007 for incidence; 1975-2007 for mortality) trends and short-term fixed interval (1998-2007) trends. Analyses of malignant neuroepithelial brain and ONS tumors were based on data from 1980-2007; data on nonmalignant tumors were available for 2004-2007. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Overall cancer incidence rates decreased by approximately 1% per year; the decrease was statistically significant (P < .05) in women, but not in men, because of a recent increase in prostate cancer incidence. The death rates continued to decrease for both sexes. Childhood cancer incidence rates continued to increase, whereas death rates continued to decrease. Lung cancer death rates decreased in women for the first time during 2003-2007, more than a decade after decreasing in men. During 2004-2007, more than 213 500 primary brain and ONS tumors were diagnosed, and 35.8% were malignant. From 1987-2007, the incidence of neuroepithelial malignant brain and ONS tumors decreased by 0.4% per year in men and women combined.  Conclusions:   The decrease in cancer incidence and mortality reflects progress in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment. However, major challenges remain, including increasing incidence rates and continued low survival for some cancers. Malignant and nonmalignant brain tumors demonstrate differing patterns of occurrence by sex, age, and race, and exhibit considerable biologic diversity.

Previously, we identified the metastasis promoting transcription factor, ATF3, as a downstream target of NDRG1. Further analysis revealed that the KAI1 promoter contained a consensus binding motif of ATF3, suggesting a possibility that NDRG1 suppresses metastasis through inhibition of ATF3 expression followed by activation of the KAI1 gene. In this report, we found that ectopic expression of NDRG1 was able to augment endogenous KAI1 gene expression in prostate cancer cell lines, whereas silencing NDRG1 was accompanied with significant decrease in KAI1 expression in vitro and in vivo. In addition, our results of ChIP analysis indicate that ATF3 indeed bound to the promoter of the KAI1 gene. Importantly, our promoter-based analysis revealed that ATF3 modulated KAI1 transcription through cooperation with other endogenous transcription factor as co-activator (ATF3-JunB) or co-repressor (ATF3-NFκB). Moreover, loss of KAI1 expression significantly abrogated NDRG1-mediated metastatic suppression in vitro as well as in a spontaneous metastasis animal model, indicating that KA11 is a functional downstream target of the NDRG1 pathway. Our result of immunohistochemical analysis showed that loss of NDRG1 and KAI1 occurs in parallel as prostate cancer progresses. We also found that a combined expression status of these two genes serves as a strong independent prognostic marker to predict metastasis-free survival of prostate cancer patients.

In import assays using recombinant proteins, AIP directly mediated the import of survivin to mitochondria, thus enabling its anti-apoptotic function, whereas a survivin 1-141 mutant that does not bind AIP was not imported to mitochondria and failed to inhibit apoptosis. AIP-directed mitochondrial import of survivin did not affect cell division, was independent of the organelle transmembrane potential, did not require the chaperone Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90), and was inhibited by cytosolic factor(s) present in normal cells. shRNA knockdown of the mitochondrial import receptor Tom20 abolished mitochondrial import of survivin and sensitized tumor cells to apoptosis, whereas silencing of Tom70 had no effect.

Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we found that the PKCδ C1b domain associates with p23 and identified two key residues (Asp(245) and Met(266)) implicated in this interaction. Interestingly, silencing p23 from LNCaP prostate cancer cells using RNAi markedly enhanced PKCδ-dependent apoptosis and activation of PKCδ downstream effectors ROCK and JNK by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Moreover, translocation of PKCδ to the plasma membrane by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was enhanced in p23-depleted LNCaP cells. Notably, a PKCδ mutant that failed to interact with p23 triggered a strong apoptotic response when expressed in LNCaP cells.

We show here that RIAM is expressed in metastatic human melanoma cells and that both RIAM and Rap1 are required for BLM melanoma cell invasion. RIAM silencing in melanoma cells led to inhibition of tumor growth and to delayed metastasis in a severe combined immunodeficiency xenograft model. Defective invasion of RIAM-silenced melanoma cells arose from impairment in persistent cell migration directionality, which was associated with deficient activation of a Vav2-RhoA-ROCK-myosin light chain pathway. Expression of constitutively active Vav2 and RhoA in cells depleted for RIAM partially rescued their invasion, indicating that Vav2 and RhoA mediate RIAM function. These results suggest that inhibition of cell invasion in RIAM-silenced melanoma cells is likely based on altered cell contractility and cell polarization. Furthermore, we show that RIAM depletion reduces β1 integrin-dependent melanoma cell adhesion, which correlates with decreased activation of both Erk1/2 MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, two central molecules controlling cell growth and cell survival. In addition to causing inhibition of cell proliferation, RIAM silencing led to higher susceptibility to cell apoptosis.

Design:   Population based randomised controlled trial.  Setting:   Department of Urology, Norrköping, and the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register.  Participants:   All men aged 50-69 in the city of Norrköping, Sweden, identified in 1987 in the National Population Register (n = 9026).  Intervention:   From the study population, 1494 men were randomly allocated to be screened by including every sixth man from a list of dates of birth. These men were invited to be screened every third year from 1987 to 1996. On the first two occasions screening was done by digital rectal examination only. From 1993, this was combined with prostate specific antigen testing, with 4 µg/L as cut off. On the fourth occasion (1996), only men aged 69 or under at the time of the investigation were invited.  Main outcome measures:   Data on tumour stage, grade, and treatment from the South East Region Prostate Cancer Register. Prostate cancer specific mortality up to 31 December 2008.  Results:   In the four screenings from 1987 to 1996 attendance was 1161/1492 (78%), 957/1363 (70%), 895/1210 (74%), and 446/606 (74%), respectively. There were 85 cases (5.7%) of prostate cancer diagnosed in the screened group and 292 (3.9%) in the control group. The risk ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group was 1.16 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.73). In a Cox proportional hazard analysis comparing prostate cancer specific survival in the control group with that in the screened group, the hazard ratio for death from prostate cancer was 1.23 (0.94 to 1.62; P = 0.13).

We aimed to estimate the proportion of second cancers attributable to radiotherapy in adults with data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registries.  Methods:   We used nine of the SEER registries to systematically analyse 15 cancer sites that are routinely treated with radiotherapy (oral and pharynx, salivary gland, rectum, anus, larynx, lung, soft tissue, female breast, cervix, endometrial, prostate, testes, eye and orbit, brain and CNS, and thyroid). The cohort we studied was composed of patients aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with a first primary invasive solid cancer reported in the SEER registries between Jan 1, 1973, and Dec 31, 2002. Relative risks (RRs) for second cancer in patients treated with radiotherapy versus patients not treated with radiotherapy were estimated with Poisson regression adjusted for age, stage, and other potential confounders.  Findings:   647,672 cancer patients who were 5-year survivors were followed up for a mean 12 years (SD 4.5, range 5-34); 60,271 (9%) developed a second solid cancer. For each of the first cancer sites the RR of developing a second cancer associated with radiotherapy exceeded 1, and varied from 1.08 (95% CI 0.79-1.46) after cancers of the eye and orbit to 1.43 (1.13-1.84) after cancer of the testes. In general, the RR was highest for organs that typically received greater than 5 Gy, decreased with increasing age at diagnosis, and increased with time since diagnosis. We estimated a total of 3266 (2862-3670) excess second solid cancers that could be related to radiotherapy, that is 8% (7-9) of the total in all radiotherapy patients (≥1 year survivors) and five excess cancers per 1000 patients treated with radiotherapy by 15 years after diagnosis.  Interpretation:   A relatively small proportion of second cancers are related to radiotherapy in adults, suggesting that most are due to other factors, such as lifestyle or genetics.

Methods:   Patients with breast (n=78) and prostate (n=82) cancer were evaluated before the initiation of RT using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, General Sleep Disturbance Scale, Lee Fatigue Scale, and wrist actigraphy. Differences in sleep disturbance and fatigue between groups were evaluated using independent sample t-tests and Chi-square analyses.  Results:   Occurrence rates for sleep disturbance (P<0.0001) and fatigue (P=0.03) were significantly higher in patients with breast compared with prostate cancer. Patients with breast cancer self-reported significantly higher levels of sleep disturbance (P=0.008) and fatigue (P=0.005) than patients with prostate cancer. However, using actigraphy, patients with prostate cancer had poorer sleep efficiency (P=0.02) than patients with breast cancer.  Conclusion:   Based on self-report, patients with breast cancer experience sleep disturbance more frequently and with greater severity than patients with prostate cancer.

However, mechanisms leading to GSTP1 repression by promoter hypermethylation in leukemia and its relationship with pathological alterations of the chromatin structure remain poorly understood. A panel of leukemia cell lines was analyzed for their GSTP1 expression, revealing cell lines with high, moderate or no detectable GSTP1 expression. Bisulfite sequencing, methylation-specific PCR and combined bisulfite restriction analysis revealed that GSTP1 promoter was completely methylated in transcriptionally inactive RAJI and MEG-01 cell lines. In contrast, cell lines expressing GSTP1 exhibited an unmethylated and transcriptionally active promoter. Furthermore, histone marks and effector proteins associated with transcriptional activity were detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation in the GSTP1 expressing hypomethylated K-562 cell line. However, repressive chromatin marks and the recruitment of silencing protein complexes were found in the non-expressing hypermethylated RAJI and MEG-01 cell lines. Finally, we provide evidence that treatment of RAJI and MEG-01 cells with the DNA demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, resulted in GSTP1 promoter demethylation, drastic changes of histone modifications and promoter associated proteins and GSTP1 gene activation. In contrast, treatments with HDAC inhibitors failed to demethylate and reactivate the GSTP1 gene. Our study extends the knowledge on leukemia-specific epigenetic alterations of GSTP1 gene. Furthermore, we are showing the correlation of DNA methylation and histone modifications with the positive/negative GSTP1 transcriptional expression state.

As cancer cells also have increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) we hypothesized that a contrarian approach of enhancing iron entry would allow for further increased generation of ROS causing oxidative damage and cell death.  Methods:   A small molecule library consisting of ~11,000 compounds was screened to identify compounds that stimulated iron-induced quenching of intracellular calcein fluorescence. We verified the iron facilitating properties of the lead compound, LS081, through ⁵⁵Fe uptake and the expression of the iron storage protein, ferritin. LS081-induced iron facilitation was correlated with rates of cancer cell growth inhibition, ROS production, clonogenicity, and hypoxia induced factor (HIF) levels.  Results:   Compound LS081 increased ⁵⁵Fe uptake in various cancer cell lines and Caco2 cells, a model system for studying intestinal iron uptake. LS081 also increased the uptake of Fe from transferrin (Tf).

We examined trends in ADT regimen and indication over time.  Results:   The number of patients initiating ADT increased from 1995 to 2001 (2106-2916 per year) and declined thereafter to 2200-2300 annually (total n= 26,809). However, prostate cancer prevalence doubled over these years, and the rate of ADT initiation decreased from 16 to 7 per 100 person-years. Patterns varied by regimen and indication.

However, it is critical that the needles be placed accurately within the prostate to deliver the therapy to the planned location and avoid complications of damaging surrounding tissues.  Methods:   The authors have developed a compact mechatronic system, as well as an effective method for guiding and controlling the insertion of transperineal needles into the prostate. This system has been designed to allow guidance of a needle obliquely in 3D space into the prostate, thereby reducing pubic arch interference. The choice of needle trajectory and location in the prostate can be adjusted manually or with computer control.  Results:   To validate the system, a series of experiments were performed on phantoms. The 3D scan of the string phantom produced minimal geometric error, which was less than 0.4 mm. Needle guidance accuracy tests in agar prostate phantoms showed that the mean error of bead placement was less then 1.6 mm along parallel needle paths that were within 1.2 mm of the intended target and 1 degree from the preplanned trajectory. At oblique angles of up to 15 degrees relative to the probe axis, beads were placed to within 3.0 mm along a trajectory that were within 2.0 mm of the target with an angular error less than 2 degrees.  Conclusions:   By combining 3D TRUS imaging system to a needle tracking linkage, this system should improve the physician's ability to target and accurately guide a needle to selected targets without the need for the computer to directly manipulate and insert the needle. This would be beneficial as the physician has complete control of the system and can safely maneuver the needle guide around obstacles such as previously placed needles.""","""['Jeffrey Bax', 'David Smith', 'Laura Bartha', 'Jacques Montreuil', 'Shi Sherebrin', 'Lori Gardi', 'Chandima Edirisinghe', 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Robot-assisted 3D-TRUS guided prostate brachytherapy: system integration and validation.', 'Mechanically assisted 3D ultrasound guided prostate biopsy system.', 'Prostate brachytherapy with oblique needles to treat large glands and overcome pubic arch interference.', 'A review of the recommendations governing quality assurance of ultrasound systems used for guidance in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Three-dimensional sonography with needle tracking: role in diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Robotically controlled three-dimensional micro-ultrasound for prostate biopsy guidance.', 'Needle-tissue interactive mechanism and steering control in image-guided robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery: a review.', 'Towards Clinically Optimized MRI-guided Surgical Manipulator for Minimally Invasive Prostate Percutaneous Interventions: Constructive Design.']"""

The dosimetric margin distribution (DMD) is the distribution of DMs over all directions. Given a geometric uncertainty model, representing inter- or intrafraction setup uncertainties or internal organ motion, the DMD can be used to calculate coverage Q, which is the probability that a realized target or organ-at-risk (OAR) dose metric D, exceeds the corresponding prescription or tolerance dose. Postplanning coverage evaluation quantifies the percentage of uncertainties for which target and OAR structures meet their intended dose constraints. The goal of the present work is to evaluate coverage probabilities for 28 prostate treatment plans to determine DMD sampling parameters that ensure adequate accuracy for postplanning coverage estimates.  Methods:   Normally distributed interfraction setup uncertainties were applied to 28 plans for localized prostate cancer, with prescribed dose of 79.2 Gy and 10 mm clinical target volume to planning target volume (CTV-to-PTV) margins. Using angular or isotropic sampling techniques, dosimetric margins were determined for the CTV, bladder and rectum, assuming shift invariance of the dose distribution. For angular sampling, DMDs were sampled at fixed angular intervals w (e.g., w = 1 degree, 2 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees). Isotropic samples were uniformly distributed on the unit sphere resulting in variable angular increments, but were calculated for the same number of sampling directions as angular DMDs, and accordingly characterized by the effective angular increment omega eff. In each direction, the DM was calculated by moving the structure in radial steps of size delta (=0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 mm) until the specified isodose was crossed. Coverage estimation accuracy deltaQ was quantified as a function of the sampling parameters omega or omega eff and delta.  Results:   The accuracy of coverage estimates depends on angular and radial DMD sampling parameters omega or omega eff and delta, as well as the employed sampling technique. Target deltaQ/ < l% and OAR /deltaQ/ < 3% can be achieved with sampling parameters omega or omega eef = 20 degrees, delta =1 mm. Better accuracy (target /deltaQ < 0.5% and OAR /deltaQ < approximately 1%) can be achieved with omega or omega eff = 10 degrees, delta = 0.5 mm. As the number of sampling points decreases, the isotropic sampling method maintains better accuracy than fixed angular sampling.  Conclusions:   Coverage estimates for post-planning evaluation are essential since coverage values of targets and OARs often differ from the values implied by the static margin-based plans. Finer sampling of the DMD enables more accurate assessment of the effect of geometric uncertainties on coverage estimates prior to treatment. DMD sampling with omega or omega eff = 10 degrees and delta = 0.5 mm should be adequate for planning purposes.""","""['Huijun Xu', 'J James Gordon', 'Jeffrey V Siebers']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Evaluation of dosimetric margins in prostate IMRT treatment plans.', 'Coverage optimized planning: probabilistic treatment planning based on dose coverage histogram criteria.', 'Target miss using PTV-based IMRT compared to robust optimization via coverage probability concept in prostate cancer.', 'Comparisons of treatment optimization directly incorporating random patient setup uncertainty with a margin-based approach.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Coverage-based treatment planning to accommodate delineation uncertainties in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Coverage-based treatment planning to accommodate deformable organ variations in prostate cancer treatment.']"""

In this study, an earlier developed backprojection model has been modified to avoid the need for patient-specific transmission measurements and, consequently, leads to a faster procedure.  Methods:   Currently, the transmission, an essential ingredient of the backprojection model, is estimated from the ratio of EPID measurements with and without a phantom/patient in the beam. Thus, an additional irradiation to obtain ""open images"" under the same conditions as the actual phantom/patient irradiation is required. However, by calculating the transmission of the phantom/patient in the direction of the beam instead of using open images, this extra measurement can be avoided. This was achieved by using a model that includes the effect of beam hardening and off-axis dependence of the EPID response on photon beam spectral changes. The parameters in the model were empirically obtained by performing EPID measurements using polystyrene slab phantoms of different thickness in 6, 10, and 18 MV photon beams. A theoretical analysis to verify the sensitivity of the model with patient thickness changes was performed. The new model was finally applied for the analysis of EPID dose verification measurements of step-and-shoot IMRT treatments of head and neck, lung, breast, cervix, prostate, and rectum patients. All measurements were carried out using Elekta SL20i linear accelerators equipped with a hydrogenated amorphous silicon EPID, and the IMRT plans were made using PINNACLE software (Philips Medical Systems).  Results:   The results showed generally good agreement with the dose determined using the old model applying the measured transmission. The average differences between EPID-based in vivo dose at the isocenter determined using either the new model for transmission and its measured value were 2.6 +/- 3.1%, 0.2 +/- 3.1%, and 2.2 +/- 3.9% for 47 patients treated with 6, 10, and 18 MV IMRT beams, respectively. For the same group of patients, the differences in mean gamma analysis (3% maximum dose, 3 mm) were 0.16 +/- 0.26%, 0.21 +/- 0.24%, and 0.02 +/- 0.12%, respectively. For a subgroup of 11 patients, pretreatment verification was also performed, showing similar dose differences at the isocenter: -1.9 +/- 0.9%, -1.4 +/- 1.2%, and -0.4 +/- 2.4%, with somewhat lower mean gamma difference values: 0.01 +/- 0.09%, 0.01 +/- 0.07%, and -0.09 +/- 0.10%, respectively. Clinical implementation of the new model would save 450 h/yr spent in measurement of open images.  Conclusions:   It can be concluded that calculating instead of measuring the transmission leads to differences in the isocenter dose generally smaller than 2% (2.6% for 6 MV photon beams for in vivo dose) and yielded only slightly higher gamma-evaluation parameter values in planes through the isocenter. Hence, the new model is suitable for clinical implementation and measurement of open images can be omitted.""","""['R Pecharromán-Gallego', 'Anton Mans', 'Jan-Jakob Sonke', 'Joep C Stroom', 'Igor Olaciregui-Ruiz', 'Marcel van Herk', 'Ben J Mijnheer']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'In aqua vivo EPID dosimetry.', 'Experimental investigation of the response of an a-Si EPID to an unflattened photon beam from an Elekta Precise linear accelerator.', 'A literature review of electronic portal imaging for radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'Dosimetric verification of IMRT and 3D conformal treatment delivery using EPID.', 'Extending in aqua portal dosimetry with dose inhomogeneity conversion maps for accurate patient dose reconstruction in external beam radiotherapy.', 'A method for in vivo treatment verification of IMRT and VMAT based on electronic portal imaging device.', 'Simple Electronic Portal Imager-Based Pretreatment Quality Assurance using Acuros XB: A Feasibility Study.', 'An Empirical Transmitted EPID Dosimetry Method using a Back-Projection Algorithm.', 'Electronic Portal Imaging Device-Based Three-Dimensional Volumetric Dosimetry for Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy Pretreatment Quality Assurance.']"""

To this end we have developed a Monte Carlo-based calculation method capable of simulating a wide variety of treatment techniques without the need to resort to discretization approximations.  Methods:   The ability to perform complete position-probability-sampled Monte Carlo dose calculations was implemented in the BEAMnrc/DOSXZYnrc user codes of EGSnrc. The method includes full accelerator head simulations of our tomotherapy and Elekta linacs, and a realistic representation of continous motion via the sampling of a time variable. The functionality of this algorithm was tested via comparisons with both measurements and treatment planning dose distributions for four types of treatment techniques: 3D conformal, step-shoot intensity modulated radiation therapy, helical tomotherapy, and volumetric modulated are therapy.  Results:   For static fields, the absolute dose agreement between the EGSnrc Monte Carlo calculations and measurements is within 2%/1 mm. Absolute dose agreement between Monte Carlo calculations and treatment planning system for the four different treatment techniques is within 3%/3 mm. Discrepancies with the tomotherapy TPS on the order of 10%/5 mm were observed for the extreme example of a small target located 15 cm off-axis and planned with a low modulation factor. The increase in simulation time associated with using position-probability sampling, as opposed to the discretization approach, was less than 2% in most cases.  Conclusions:   A single Monte Carlo simulation method can be used to calculate patient dose distribution for various types of treatment techniques delivered with either tomotherapy or a conventional linac.

Methods:   Under the same configuration using seven-field 15 MV photon beams, DVHs of OARs (bladder and rectum) were estimated based on anatomical information of the patient and a model learned from a database of high quality prior plans. In this study, the anatomical information was characterized by the organ volumes and distance-to-target histogram (DTH). The database consists of 198 high quality prostate plans and was validated with 14 cases outside the training pool. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to DVHs and DTHs to quantify their salient features. Then, support vector regression (SVR) was implemented to establish the correlation between the features of the DVH and the anatomical information.  Results:   DVH/DTH curves could be characterized sufficiently just using only two or three truncated principal components, thus, patient anatomical information was quantified with reduced numbers of variables.

CR plates can be used for patient imaging, but may also be used for a variety of quality assurance (QA) purposes and can be calibrated in terms of dose. This study looks at their suitability for verification of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose distributions.  Methods:   A CR plate was calibrated in terms of the relative dose and the stability of response over 1 year was studied. The effect of exposing the CR plate to ambient light and of using different time delays before scanning was quantified. The CR plate was used to verify the relative dose distributions for ten IMRT patients and the results were compared to those obtained using a two dimensional (2D) diode array.  Results:   Exposing the CR plate to 10 s of ambient light between irradiation (174 cGy) and scanning erased approximately 80% of the signal. Changes in delay time between irradiation and scanning also affected the measurement results. The signal on the plate was found to decay at a rate of approximately 3.6 cGy/min in the first 10 min after irradiation. The use of a CR plate for IMRT patient-specific QA resulted in a significantly lower distance to agreement (DTA) and gamma pass rate than when using a 2D diode array for the measurement. This was primarily due to the over-response of the CR phosphor to low energy scattered radiation. For the IMRT QA using the CR plate, the average gamma pass rate was 97.3%. For the same IMRT QA using a diode array, the average gamma pass rate was 99.7%. The gamma criteria used were 4% dose difference and 4 mm DTA for head and neck treatments and 3% dose difference and 3 mm DTA for prostate treatments. The gamma index tolerance was 1. The lowest 10% of the dose distribution was excluded from all gamma and DTA analyses.  Conclusions:   Although the authors showed that CR plates can be used for patient specific IMRT QA, the practical problems such as the over-response to low energy scatter and signal fading with light exposure and time mean that alternative detectors such as radiochromic film or diode arrays will be a more sensible choice for most radiotherapy departments.""","""['R A Day', 'A P Sankar', 'W H Nailon', 'A S MacLeod']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Patient-specific quality assurance for the delivery of (60)Co intensity modulated radiation therapy subject to a 0.35-T lateral magnetic field.', 'Clinical introduction of a linac head-mounted 2D detector array based quality assurance system in head and neck IMRT.', 'Radiochromic film based transit dosimetry for verification of dose delivery with intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetry tools and techniques for IMRT.', 'Tolerance limits and methodologies for IMRT measurement-based verification QA: Recommendations of AAPM Task Group No. 218.', 'Understanding entrance-air-kerma as a quality-control metric for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.']"""

The calculated profiles were validated against measurements for simulated MLC leaf openings. The reduction in dose due to a partially obscured source was analyzed. The thread effect was investigated for a source of typical linac spot dimensions and 2.0 and 2.8 cm diameter cylindrical Co-60 sources. Co-60 tomotherapy plans for three clinical treatment sites--prostate, brain, and head-and-neck--were generated for the Co-60 sources and compared to linac-based segmental IMRT plans in terms of the DVHs produced. Treatment times were also determined.  Results:   The custom source profile utility allowed the authors to obtain good agreement between calculated and measured profiles for simulated MLC leaf openings with the commercial Co-60 source. It was found that the thread effect is significantly reduced for Co-60 sources and is not a clinical concern even for the large slice width (4.8 cm) and pitch value (0.5) studied. Co-60 tomotherapy plans for three clinical treatment sites compared favorably to the original segmental IMRT plans in terms of the DVHs produced. Treatment times, comparable to the actual segmental IMRT treatment times, may be achieved for a high activity Co-60 source and dual-slice delivery may reduce these times further.

All patients underwent anatomosis assessment on postoperative day 6 with TRUS (Aloka A7 US machine with endorectal end-fire probe). 200 ml of sterile saline was manually instilled into the bladder by an assistant, while TRUS visualization of anastomosis was carried out by an urologist. The test was considered positive if any expanding anechoic shadow developed beside the anastomosis. In case of negative test the catheter was removed. In case of positive test the catheter was left in place and reassessment was performed every 5-7 days with both TRUS and FC, until negative result.  Results:   At the initial TRUS assessment we had 4 positive and 56 negative tests. Three out of the four patients with a positive test had a second assessment on p.o. day 14, which gave a negative result. The 4th positive case had a positive second assessment on p.o. day 14 and a third negative one on p.o. day 21. In a total of 20 assessments both TRUS and FC were performed. The results of the two procedures were always in accordance.  Conclusions:   We have introduced TRUS assessment of vescicourethral anastomosis after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy as a routine procedure in our department.

A second order polynomial was devised to correlate the source size parameter with the RTPS-calculated penumbra. The optimal source size parameter was calculated for penumbra measurements based on the diamond detector and a standard ionization chamber (IC). This work was done for Jaw fields, MLC fields with a leaf end radius of 8 cm, and MLC fields with a leaf end radius of 12 cm. The optimum source size of the 8 cm MLC fields matched the jaw fields, and an average (based on field sizes studied) of 1.1 mm for the diamond detector data and 2.4 mm for the ionization chamber was established. The effect of this overestimation of the source size parameter based on detector-induced penumbra broadening was considered for a clinical IMRT prostate plan by using two models (diamond and IC). There were differences in the DVH of the PTV and of OARs but these effects were of negligible clinical significance. Dose difference distributions showed dose difference areas to be in penumbra regions of the segments, with larger dose differences where penumbras intersected and/or there was a significant weighting on the segment. Gamma analysis was also performed between the two plans, and was found to increase the amount of fail rates significantly for both 2%/2 mm and 3%/3 mm criteria.

Trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) is a secreted protein involved in maintaining the gastrointestinal epithelium by serving a tumor-suppressive role; however, TFF1 is overexpressed in several types of cancers. Here we report that TFF1 acts as a promoter of tumorigenesis in the context of prostate and pancreatic cancers by suppressing oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Expression of TFF1 allows human prostate epithelial cells to escape OIS caused by the activated Ras oncogene or by reduced expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN, in part by the involvement of the EGF receptor-mediated pathway and inhibition of the expression of the cell cycle regulator p21. Without intrinsic promitogenic activity TFF1 may act in both autocrine and paracrine manners to enable cells to undergo the initial transformation and expansion against the restrictive microenvironment during early stage tumorigenesis. Taken together, our findings identify TFF1 as a soluble factor designed to act mainly to antagonize the OIS process to accelerate tumorigenesis.""","""['Daniel R Radiloff', 'Timothy P Wakeman', 'Junjie Feng', 'Stephen Schilling', 'Edward Seto', 'Xiao-Fan Wang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Trefoil factor 1 stimulates both pancreatic cancer and stellate cells and increases metastasis.', 'Induction of the adenoma-carcinoma progression and Cdc25A-B phosphatases by the trefoil factor TFF1 in human colon epithelial cells.', 'NFATc1 promotes prostate tumorigenesis and overcomes PTEN loss-induced senescence.', 'The role of the NORE1A tumor suppressor in Oncogene-Induced Senescence.', 'Trefoil factor 1 (pS2/TFF1), a peptide with numerous functions.', 'Combinatorial Herbal Extracts Alleviate Alcohol-Induced Hepatic Disorders.', 'TFF-1 Functions to Suppress Multiple Phenotypes Associated with Lung Cancer Progression.', 'Reciprocal expression of trefoil factor-1 and thyroid transcription factor-1 in lung adenocarcinomas.', 'Comparative RNA-seq analysis reveals dys-regulation of major canonical pathways in ERG-inducible LNCaP cell progression model of prostate cancer.', 'MTA2-mediated inhibition of PTEN leads to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carcinogenicity.']"""

Fifty consecutive patients (median age 61 years) with a median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 5.8 ng/ml underwent 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy of the prostate. Pre-procedural T2-weighted magnetic resonance images were fused to TRUS. A disposable needle guide with miniature tracking sensors was attached to the TRUS probe to enable fusion with MRI. Real-time TRUS images during biopsy and the corresponding tracking information were recorded. Each biopsy site was superimposed onto the MRI. Each biopsy site was classified as positive or negative for cancer based on the results of each MRI sequence. Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating curve (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated for multi-parametric MRI. Gleason scores for each multi-parametric MRI pattern were also evaluated. Six hundred and 5 systemic biopsy cores were analyzed in 50 patients, of whom 20 patients had 56 positive cores.

UK governments have made commitments to reduce the number of working days lost to ill-health and to improve access to vocational rehabilitation (VR) services. Return to work for people with cancer has been identified as a priority. However, there are few services to support people to remain in or return to work after cancer and no associated trials to assess their impact. A pilot randomised controlled trial among women with breast cancer has been designed to assess the feasibility of a larger definitive trial of VR services for people with cancer.  Methods:   Patients are being recruited from three clinical sites in two Scottish National Health Service (NHS) Boards for 6 months. Eligible patients are all women who are: (1) aged between 18 and 65 years; (2) in paid employment or self-employed; (3) living or working in Lothian or Tayside, Scotland, UK; (4) diagnosed with an invasive breast cancer tumour; (5) treated first with surgery. Patients are randomly allocated to receive referral to a VR service or usual care, which involves no formal employment support. The primary outcome measure is self-reported sickness absence in the first 6 months following surgery. Secondary outcome measures include changes in quality of life (FACT-B), fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) and employment status between baseline and 6- and 12-months post-surgery. A post-trial evaluation will be conducted to assess the acceptability of the intervention among participants and the feasibility of a larger, more definitive, trial with patients with lung and prostate cancer.  Discussion:   To our knowledge this is the first study to determine the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of the effectiveness of VR services to enable people with cancer to remain in or return to employment.

Methods:   From May 2003 to present, 137 consecutive patients with T1-2 prostate cancer were treated using the Sonablate 500 and then followed for more than 12 months after their last HIFU treatment. A prostate biopsy was routinely carried out at 6 months and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured every 3 months after HIFU. Oncological outcomes as well as treatment-related complications were assessed. Disease-free survival (DFS) was judged using the Phoenix definition (PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL), negative histological findings and no local or distant metastasis.  Results:   The median follow up after HIFU was 36 months (range 12-84 months). No patients received adjuvant therapy during this period.

In the present study, we investigated the regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell invasiveness by periostin in bladder and prostate cancer cell lines, and found opposite regulation of EMT and cell invasiveness by periostin. Periostin upregulated E-cadherin expression in bladder cancer cells but downregulated it in prostate cancer cells. Periostin suppressed cell invasiveness in bladder cancer cells but promoted it in prostate cancer cells. Snail, a negative regulator of E-cadherin, was upregulated by periostin in prostate cancer cells, while Twist, another negative regulator of E-cadherin, was downregulated in bladder cancer cells. The C-terminal region of periostin was sufficient for these functions in bladder cancer cells but not in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of endogenous Snail by siRNA suppressed cell invasiveness in prostate cancer cells expressing periostin. Periostin also suppressed Akt phosphorylation in bladder cancer cells but enhanced it in prostate cancer cells. Treatment with Akt inhibitor increased E-cadherin expression and suppressed both Twist expression and cell invasiveness of bladder cancer cells.

Polygenic disease risk was assumed to have a log-normal relative risk distribution predicted for the currently known prostate or breast cancer susceptibility variants (N=31 and N=18, respectively).  Results:   Compared with screening men based on age alone (aged 55-79: 10-year absolute risk ≥2%), personalised screening of men age 45-79 at the same risk threshold would result in 16% fewer men being eligible for screening at a cost of 3% fewer screen-detectable cases, but with added benefit of detecting additional cases in younger men at high risk.

We therefore undertook a search for genetic variants associated with risk of more aggressive disease.  Methods:   A genome-wide scan was conducted in 202 prostate cancer cases with a more aggressive phenotype and 100 randomly sampled, age-matched prostate-specific antigen screened negative controls. Analysis of 387,384 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was followed by validation testing in an independent set of 527 cases with more aggressive and 595 cases with less aggressive prostate cancer, and 1,167 age-matched controls.  Results:   A variant on 15q13, rs6497287, was confirmed to be most strongly associated with more aggressive (P(discovery) = 5.20 × 10(-5), P(validation) = 0.004) than less aggressive disease (P = 0.14).

The structures that emerge show that bicalutamide antagonizes AR by accessing an additional binding pocket (B-site) adjacent to the hormone binding site (HBS), induced by displacing helix 12. This distorts the coactivator binding site and results in the inactivation of transcription. An alternative equienergetic conformational state of bicalutamide was found to bind in an expanded hormone pocket without materially perturbing either helix 12 or the coactivator binding site. Thus, both the structural basis of antagonism and the mechanism underlying agonist properties displayed by bicalutamide in different environments may be rationalized in terms of these structures. In addition, the antagonist structure and especially the induced second site (B-site) provide a structural framework for the design of novel antiandrogens.""","""['D J Osguthorpe', 'A T Hagler']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochemistry""","""['Molecular mechanism of R-bicalutamide switching from androgen receptor antagonist to agonist induced by amino acid mutations using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation.', 'Interaction mechanism exploration of R-bicalutamide/S-1 with WT/W741L AR using molecular dynamics simulations.', 'Learning from estrogen receptor antagonism: structure-based identification of novel antiandrogens effective against multiple clinically relevant androgen receptor mutants.', 'Non-Steroidal Androgen Receptor Antagonists and Prostate Cancer: A Survey on Chemical Structures Binding this Fast-Mutating Target.', 'Developments in nonsteroidal antiandrogens targeting the androgen receptor.', 'Bicalutamide Anticancer Activity Enhancement by Formulation of Soluble Inclusion Complexes with Cyclodextrins.', 'Adaptation to Hypoxia May Promote Therapeutic Resistance to Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy and the Risk for Inguinal Hernia: An Observational Nested Case Control Study.', 'Conformational dynamics of androgen receptors bound to agonists and antagonists.', 'Cysteamine-bicalutamide combination therapy corrects proximal tubule phenotype in cystinosis.']"""

To examine the response to microenvironmental conditions, two paclitaxel resistant prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines (stable and reversible) and one reversible heat resistant cell line were studied. In comparison to their parental cell lines, both paclitaxel resistant cell lines (stable and reversible) were more sensitive to microenvironmental heat, potentially yielding a synergistic therapeutic opportunity. In the two phenotypic cells repopulated after acute heat or paclitaxel treatments, there was an inverse correlation between paclitaxel and heat resistance: resistance to paclitaxel imparted sensitivity to heat; resistance to heat imparted sensitivity to paclitaxel. These studies indicate that as cancer cells evolve resistance to single microenvironmental stress they may be more sensitive to others, perhaps allowing us to design new approaches for PCa therapy.""","""['Youqiang Li', 'Yu Zeng', 'Steven M Mooney', 'Bo Yin', 'Atsushi Mizokami', 'Mikio Namiki', 'Robert H Getzenberg']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Overexpression of PER3 reverses paclitaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting the Notch pathway.', 'Acquisition of paclitaxel resistance is associated with a more aggressive and invasive phenotype in prostate cancer.', 'Sequential Release of Pooled siRNAs and Paclitaxel by Aptamer-Functionalized Shell-Core Nanoparticles to Overcome Paclitaxel Resistance of Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of the SHH gene in prostate cancer cell resistance to paclitaxel.', 'Changing the energy habitat of the cancer cell in order to impact therapeutic resistance.', 'Role of extracellular vesicles secretion in paclitaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells.', 'Application of Prostate Cancer Models for Preclinical Study: Advantages and Limitations of Cell Lines, Patient-Derived Xenografts, and Three-Dimensional Culture of Patient-Derived Cells.', 'Paclitaxel resistance and the role of miRNAs in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Identifying global expression patterns and key regulators in epithelial to mesenchymal transition through multi-study integration.', 'A novel spontaneous model of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using a primary prostate cancer derived cell line demonstrating distinct stem-like characteristics.']"""

Previously, our laboratory has shown that β(1A) integrins support insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGFI)-mediated mitogenic and transforming activities. Here, we report that β(1A) integrins regulate basal levels of IGF-IR, although they are not critical for maintaining cancer cell morphology. Upon transfection of β(1A) siRNA and consequent downregulation of IGF-IR, we show inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer cells, a function which is dependent on IGF-IR expression. In addition, we demonstrate that IGFI-mediated activation of androgen receptor (AR), known to occur in prostate cancer cells, requires expression of β(1A) integrins as evaluated by luciferase reporter assays and immunoblotting analysis. Since β(1A) integrin levels are increased by R1881 or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), our results imply that β(1A) integrins support an androgen-enhanced feedback loop that regulates the expression of IGF-IR. β(1A) integrins also regulate inducible levels of IGF-IR in cells stimulated by androgen or by a combination of androgen and IGFI, as evaluated by flow cytometric analysis and immunoblotting. Furthermore, upon transfection of β(1A) siRNA and consequent downregulation of IGF-IR, neither activation of AKT, an effector of IGF-IR, nor AR levels are affected.

We found that UA inhibited constitutive and TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB in DU145 and LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner. The suppression was mediated through the inhibition of constitutive and TNF-α-induced IκB kinase (IKK) activation, phosphorylation of IκBα and p65 and NF-κB-dependent reporter activity. Furthermore, UA suppressed both constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation in prostate cancer cells concomitant with suppression of activation of upstream kinases (Src and JAK2) and STAT3-dependent reporter gene activity. UA also downregulated the expression of various NF-κB and STAT3 regulated gene products involved in proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis and induced apoptosis in both cells lines as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and annexin V staining.

The PcG protein EZH2 is involved in progression of prostate and breast cancers, and has been identified as a molecular marker in breast cancer. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which PcG proteins regulate cancer progression and malignant metastasis is still unclear. PcG proteins methylate H3K27 in undifferentiated epithelial cells, resulting in the repression of differentiation genes such as HOX. FOXC1 is a member of the Forkhead box transcription factor family, which plays an important role in differentiation, and is involved in eye development. We discovered in this study that the expression of FOXC1 gene was negatively correlated to that of PcG genes, i.e., Bmi1, EZH2, and SUZ12, in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. To investigate the regulatory effects of PcG proteins on FOXC1 gene, the two cell lines were transfected with either expression plasmids or siRNA plasmids of Bmi1, EZH2, and SUZ12, and we found that PcGs, especially EZH2, could repress the transcription of FOXC1 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that histone methylation and acetylation modifications played critical roles in this regulatory process. When FOXC1 was stably transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells, the migration and invasion of the cells were repressed. Moreover, the tumorigenicity and the spontaneous metastatic capability regulated by FOXC1 were determined by using an orthotropic xenograft tumor model of athymic mice with the FOXC1-MDA-MB-231HM and the GFP-MDA-MB-231HM cells, and the results showed that FOXC1 in MDA-MB-231HM cells inhibited migration and invasion in vitro and reduced the pulmonary metastasis in vivo.

VTE occurred in 77 patients (7.5%). Patients with elevated peak thrombin (defined as values ≥ 611 nM thrombin, representing the 75th percentile of the total study population) had an increased risk of VTE with a hazard ratio of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.3, P = .002) in multivariable analysis including age, sex, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The cumulative probability of developing VTE after 6 months was significantly higher in patients with elevated peak thrombin than in those with lower peak thrombin (11% v 4%; log-rank test: P = .002).  Conclusion:   Measurement of thrombin generation may help identify patients with cancer at high risk of VTE.""","""['Cihan Ay', 'Daniela Dunkler', 'Ralph Simanek', 'Johannes Thaler', 'Silvia Koder', 'Christine Marosi', 'Christoph Zielinski', 'Ingrid Pabinger']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 predict venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer: results from the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study.', 'High platelet count associated with venous thromboembolism in cancer patients: results from the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS).', 'Thrombin generation as an intermediate phenotype for venous thrombosis.', 'Venous thromboembolism: risk factors for recurrence.', 'Risk factors for venous thromboembolism in children.', 'Venous Thromboembolism and Primary Thromboprophylaxis in Perioperative Pancreatic Cancer Care.', 'Evaluation of Haemostasis in Dogs Affected by Resectable Malignancy.', 'Targeting Platelet Activation Pathways to Limit Tumour Progression: Current State of Affairs.', 'Antithrombin Activity and Association with Risk of Thrombosis and Mortality in Patients with Cancer.', 'Thrombin generation assays to personalize treatment in bleeding and thrombotic diseases.']"""

However, new minimally invasive techniques have emerged, providing a less invasive approach. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is the ideal technique, providing good oncologic and functional outcomes. We analyzed the impact of robotic surgical systems on practice patterns among urologists to explain changes in the value of radical retropubic prostatectomy, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in a single institution in Taiwan.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who received prostatectomy by one of the above procedures between January 2004 and November 2009. Decisions to perform these procedures were made by patient preference. Patients who received prostate biopsies at other hospitals were transferred to our hospital specifically for robotic-assisted prostatectomy.  Results:   A total of 434 radical prostatectomies were performed, of which 141 (32.49%) were radical retropubic prostatectomies, 59 (13.59%) were laparoscopic radical prostatectomies and 234 (53.92%) were robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomies. The overall number of prostatectomies has increased over time because of an increase in robotic-assisted procedures. No decreases were seen in the number of radical retropubic prostatectomies during the evaluation period. Changes in the ratio of robotic-assisted prostatectomies compared to radical retropubic and laparoscopic radical prostatectomies demonstrated a trend toward robotic-assisted procedures.

Methods and results:   Athymic nude mice were implanted subcutaneously with human androgen-independent prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells. They were supplemented with a low or a high dose of lycopene (4 and 16 mg/kg) and a single dose of β-carotene (16 mg/kg) twice a week for 7 wk. At the end of the experiment, both lycopene and β-carotene strongly inhibited the tumor growth, as evidenced by the decrease in tumor volume and tumor weight. High-dosage lycopene and β-carotene significantly decreased the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in tumor tissues and increased the levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 in plasma. In addition, high-dosage lycopene supplementation significantly decreased the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in plasma. In contrast, β-carotene supplementation significantly increased the VEGF levels, as compared with tumor control group.  Conclusion:   Lycopene and β-carotene supplementation suppressed the growth of prostate tumor cells, and the effects are likely associated with reduction of proliferation (attenuation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression) and with interference of the insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling (increased plasma insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 levels).

Epidemiological studies have suggested that populations with high isoflavone intake through soy consumption have lower rates of breast, prostate, and colon cancer. Isoflavone genistein in soybean is considered a potent chemopreventive agent against cancer. Although several mechanisms have been proposed, a clear anticancer action mechanism of genistein is still not known.  Methods and results:   Here, we show that the cytotoxic action of genistein against breast cancer cells involves mobilization of endogenous copper. Further, whereas the copper specific chelator neocuproine is able to inhibit the apoptotic potential of genistein, the molecules which specifically bind iron (desferroxamine mesylate) and zinc (histidine) are relatively ineffective in causing such inhibition. Also, genistein-induced apoptosis in these cells is inhibited by scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) implicating ROS as effector elements leading to cell death.  Conclusions:   As copper levels are known to be considerably elevated in almost all types of cancers, in this proof-of-concept study we show that genistein is able to target endogenous copper leading to prooxidant signaling and consequent cell death. We believe that such a mechanism explains the anticancer effect of genistein as also its preferential cytotoxicity towards cancer cells.""","""['Mohammad F Ullah', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Haseeb Zubair', 'Husain Y Khan', 'Zhiwei Wang', 'Fazlul H Sarkar', 'Sheikh M Hadi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Nutr Food Res""","""['Cellular DNA breakage by soy isoflavone genistein and its methylated structural analogue biochanin A.', 'Plant polyphenol induced cell death in human cancer cells involves mobilization of intracellular copper ions and reactive oxygen species generation: a mechanism for cancer chemopreventive action.', 'Genistein induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and T47D cells.', 'Soy isoflavone genistein in prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'The effect of genistein aglycone on cancer and cancer risk: a review of in vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies.', 'Soy Isoflavones Induce Cell Death by Copper-Mediated Mechanism: Understanding Its Anticancer Properties.', 'Effects of Isoflavone-Rich NADES Extract of Pueraria lobata Roots and Astaxanthin-Rich Phaffia rhodozyma Extract on Prostate Carcinogenesis in Rats.', 'The Involvement of Natural Polyphenols in Molecular Mechanisms Inducing Apoptosis in Tumor Cells: A Promising Adjuvant in Cancer Therapy.', 'Exploring the recent trends in perturbing the cellular signaling pathways in cancer by natural products.', 'High Concentrations of Genistein Decrease Cell Viability Depending on Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Colon Cancer Cell Lines.']"""

Studies on the immunogenicity and immune responsiveness of pediatric tumors are limited, therefore, it remains unclear to what extent T-cell-based immunotherapy holds promise for pediatric solid tumors.  Procedure:   A new rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (M3-9-M) was derived from an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) occurring in a C57BL/6 mouse transgenic for hepatocyte growth factor and heterozygous for mutated p53. Primary tumors and metastases derived from M3-9-M were studied for similarities to human ERMS, and for immunogenicity and immune responsiveness.  Results:   Primary and metastatic tumors develop after orthotopic injection of M3-9-M into immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, which mirror human ERMS with regard to histology, gene expression, and metastatic behavior. Whole cell vaccination using irradiated M3-9-M cells or M3-9-M-pulsed dendritic cells (DC)-induced tumor-specific T-cell responses that prevent tumor growth following low-dose tumor injection, and slow tumor growth following higher doses. Administration of anti-CD25 moAbs to deplete CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells prior to tumor vaccination enhanced the potency of the ERMS tumor vaccine. Adoptive immunotherapy with M3-9-M primed T cells plus DC-based vaccination resulted in complete eradication of day 10 M3-9-M derived tumors.  Conclusions:   M3-9-M derived murine ERMS is immunogenic and immunoresponsive; regulatory T cells contribute to immune evasion by murine rhabdomyosarcoma.

The target population included two groups: post-lithotripsy patients and comparator group comprising healthy individuals selected from the general population. Both groups were matched for age and gender. The study continued through a period of 9 months. An observation period of 4-10 months following the last surgical intervention was applied before interviewing patients. Information regarding socio-demographics, medical data and presence of co-morbidities were recorded. The Medical Outcome Study Short-Form 36-item survey (SF-36) was used to assess HRQoL for both groups.

Patient's age, distal ureteral stones and ureteral stent, in addition to DM and low back pain appeared to significantly affect the HRQoL of patients. In conclusion, the promising end point in the management of urolithiasis is improvement of HRQoL.

MPO genotypes in the study populations were determined using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The allelic frequency was significantly different between the cases and controls for lung cancer (p=0.02), but not prostate cancer (p=0.30). No significant difference was noted between the lung and prostate cancer cases and control populations in terms of genotype distribution (p=0.07, p=0.53, respectively). Control groups of lung and prostate cancer were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p=0.87 and p=0.41, respectively). To determine the protective effect against lung cancer among individuals with the -463A allele, G/A and A/A genotypes were combined. Comparison of the G/G and G/A + A/A genotypes between the lung cancer cases and control groups showed a statistically significant relationship (p=0.032, OR=0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.95). No gender-specific difference was found in terms of genotype distribution between the lung cancer patients and the controls (female, p=0.20; male, p=0.34). In the case of smokers, a difference in genotype distribution between the lung cancer patients and the controls was statistically significant (p=0.02), although this difference was not statistically significant for non-smokers (p=0.90). Overall, no statistically significant difference was found between the prostate cancer cases and the controls in terms of genotype combination (p=0.46, OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.51-1.36). Additionally, in smokers and non-smokers, no significant relationship was determined between the prostate cancer patients and the control population (p=0.21, p=0.91, respectively). These results suggest that the MPO -463A allele significantly contributes to a protective effect overall and in smokers against lung cancer.""","""['Serdal Arslan', 'Hatice Pinarbasi', 'Yavuz Silig']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Association between MPO-463G\u2009>\u2009A polymorphism and cancer risk: evidence from 60 case-control studies.', 'Myeloperoxidase -463G>A polymorphism and risk of primary lung cancer in a Korean population.', 'Myeloperoxidase G-463A polymorphism and the risk of gastric cancer: a case-control study.', 'Substantially reduced risk of cancer of the aerodigestive tract in subjects with variant--463A of the myeloperoxidase gene.', 'Myeloperoxidase G-463A polymorphism and lung cancer: a HuGE genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens pooled analysis.', 'Proteomic analysis of human cervical adenocarcinoma mucus to identify potential protein biomarkers.', 'Biosynthesis of human myeloperoxidase.', 'Effects of MPO-463G/A and -129G/A polymorphisms on coronary artery disease risk and patient survival in a Turkish population.', 'Association between MPO-463G\u2009>\u2009A polymorphism and cancer risk: evidence from 60 case-control studies.', 'Glutathione S-transferase T1 and myeloperoxidase -463 G>A genotypes in lung cancer patients of Kumaun region.']"""

Methods:   The study included 129 patients who underwent transrectal sonography-guided repeat biopsies. Potential predictors, including age, body mass index, symptoms, digital rectal examination (DRE), total PSA, free PSA, free/total PSA ratio, prostate volume, PSA density, PSA velocity, PSA doubling time, and volume/biopsy ratio, were subjected to univariate analysis. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify major independent predictors for repeat biopsies, and a scoring system for predicting cancer was devised. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to test the sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system.  Results:   Thirty-four patients (26.36%) had cancer. On univariate analysis, the DRE (P = .002), total PSA (P = .020), free/total PSA ratio (P < .001), prostate volume (P < .001), PSA density (P = .003), and volume/biopsy ratio (P < .001) were significant predictors of cancer. On multivariate analysis, the DRE, total PSA, free/total PSA ratio, and volume/biopsy ratio were independently significant predictors, with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of 4.61 (1.62-13.07), 1.02 (1.00-1.04), 0.87 (0.78-0.96), and 0.56 (0.43-0.79). Using ROC analysis, we determined a cutoff value of 2.5 for the scores, at which the sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for predicting positive repeat biopsy results were 76.50% and 74.70%, with an area under the curve of 0.816 (P < .001). Patients with scores of 3 to 5 had higher cancer detection rates than those with scores of 0 to 2 (52.00% versus 10.13%; P < .001).

However this anti-tumor effects are still unknown in end human oral squamous carcinoma cells. In the present study, we investigated the effects of DHMEQ on oral squamous carcinoma cell (OSCC) lines in vitro and in vivo. Human OSCC cell lines (HSC-3, SAS) were treated with DHMEQ and examined for cell viability by MTT assay, cell cycle distribution by flow-cytometry, apoptosis by TUNEL assay, and protein expression by western blotting, respectively. In vivo activities were also investigated in a mouse xenograft model. DHMEQ inhibited growth of two OSCC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner measured by MTT assay. A flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that treatment with DHMEQ induced accumulation in sub-G1 phase. TUNEL assay showed that DHMEQ induced DNA fragmentation. Protein expression by western blotting analysis revealed that DHMEQ induced nuclear down regulation of Survivin, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2. In nude mice, DHMEQ inhibited growth of OSCC without major toxic side effects.

Objective:   We describe our modified surgical technique for full functional-length urethra (FFLU) preservation during RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analysed 691 consecutive patients who underwent RP over a 12-mo period (285 without and 406 with the FFLU technique).  Surgical procedure:   The full functional urethra length was preserved by performing an individualised apical preparation strictly along anatomic landmarks, respecting the individual length of the intraprostatically located proportion of the urethral sphincter. Anatomic fixation of the sphincter was reached by a thorough preservation of the pelvic floor and anatomic restoration of the Mueller's ligaments.  Measurements:   Continence rates were assessed at 7 d and 12 mo after removal of the catheter. Continence was defined as the use of no pads and no urinary leakage.  Results and limitations:   The continence rates were 50.1% and 30.9% 1 wk after catheter removal (p < 0.0001) and 96.9% and 94.7% (p=0.59) at 12 mo after surgery in patients operated on with the FFLU technique versus the non-FFLU technique. In multivariate regression analysis, only the surgical technique correlated significantly with the continence status 1 wk after catheter removal. Neither the overall positive surgical margin rates nor the number of positive margins at the urethral resection border differed significantly between the FFLU and non-FFLU groups (13.6% and 0.5% vs 14.9% and 1.3%, respectively). Although the patients' baseline characteristics were similar in the two surgical groups, the patients were not preoperatively randomised, and the number of patients in the groups was asymmetric.

Because of its complex structure, little is known of its structure-function relations. Merle 23 is a synthetic derivative, differing from bryostatin 1 at only four positions. However, in U-937 human leukemia cells, Merle 23 behaves like a phorbol ester and not like bryostatin 1. Here, we characterize the behavior of Merle 23 in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. In this system, bryostatin 1 and phorbol ester have contrasting activities, with the phorbol ester but not bryostatin 1 blocking cell proliferation or tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion, among other responses. We show that Merle 23 displays a highly complex pattern of activity in this system. Depending on the specific biological response or mechanistic change, it was bryostatin-like, phorbol ester-like, intermediate in its behavior, or more effective than either.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, and IGF-1 production in the liver is dependent on growth hormone (GH) secretion from the anterior pituitary. Despite the presence of IGF-1 receptors in the gonadotroph, associations between the GH/IGF-1 and pituitary-gonadal axes, e.g., whether IGF-1 elicits the LH secretion, remain unclear.  Methods:   Seventy-one patients with localized prostate cancer, who received ADT with GnRHa, were prospectively studied based on their blood samples before treatment and after ADT for 6 months. We employed highly sensitive assays for measurement of serum testosterone (electrochemiluminescence immunoassay), GH/IGF-1 (radioimmunoassay), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH: immunoradiometric assay), LH (chemiluminescent immunoassay), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S: chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay).  Results:   No correlation was noted between the pretreatment LH and IGF-1 levels; after ADT, the serum LH level was closely correlated with the IGF-1 concentration [Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) = 0.370, P = 0.001]. The serum levels of androgens and gonadotropins reduced following ADT (P < 0.001 in all). The serum IGF-1 level increased (22 ± 6 nmol/L) compared with that at the baseline (19 ± 5 nmol/L) (P < 0.001), but no change was observed in the serum GH concentration between before and after ADT (1.4 ± 2.3 vs. 0.9 ± 0.9 μg/L, respectively, P = 0.691). The serum testosterone level was not correlated with the LH level either before or after ADT. The testosterone and DHEA-S levels after ADT were correlated with ACTH concentration (rs = 0.367, P = 0.002 and rs = 0.354, P = 0.002, respectively). We did not identify any correlations between the serum IGF-1 concentration and Gleason score, PSA value, or androgen levels.  Conclusions:   During ADT with GnRHa, IGF-1 possibly promotes LH production, although its role is unclear. Associations among pituitary-gonadal, pituitary-adrenal, and GH/IGF-1 axes represented by IGF-1-mediated LH secretion and ACTH-mediated androgen synthesis are of interest, since both prostate epithelium proliferation and male anabolic activity are involved in these 3 axes.

Such treatment would allow the control of cancer, thereby diminishing side effects, such as urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction, which have an enormous impact on quality of life. The critical issue is whether it is possible to preoperatively predict clinically significant unifocal or unilateral prostate cancer with sufficient accuracy. Our aim is to determine whether there is any preoperative feature that can help select the ideal patient for focal therapy.  Material and methods:   A total of 599 patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy followed by radical prostatectomy to treat PC were examined in our laboratory between 2001 and 2009. We established very restricted criteria to select patients with very-low-risk disease for whom focal therapy would be suitable (only 1 biopsy core positive, tumor no larger than 80% of a single core, no perineural invasion, PSA serum level < 10 ng/ml, Gleason score < 7 and clinical stage T1c, T2a-b). We defined 2 groups of patients who would be either adequately treated or not treated by focal therapy. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of preoperative features in order to identify which parameters should be considered when choosing good candidates for focal therapy.  Results:   Fifty-six out of 599 patients met our criteria. The mean age was 59 years, and the mean number of biopsy cores was 14.4. Forty-seven (83.9%) were staged T1c, and 9 (16.1%) were staged T2a-b. Forty-four (78.6%) patients could be considered to have been adequately treated by focal therapy, and 12 (21.4%) could not. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups considering age, clinical stage, PSA levels, Gleason score, and tumor volume in the biopsy. All 12 patients who could be considered inadequately treated had a bilateral, significant secondary tumor, 58.3% had Gleason ≥ 7, and 25% were staged pT3.  Conclusion:   Although focal therapy might be a good option for patients with localized prostate cancer, we are so far unable to select which of them would benefit from it based on preoperative data, even using very restricted criteria, and a considerable proportion of men would still be left undertreated.""","""['Betina Katz', 'Miguel Srougi', ""Marcos Dall'Oglio"", 'Adriano J Nesrallah', ""Alexandre C Sant'anna"", 'José Pontes Jr', 'Sabrina T Reis', 'Adriana Sañudo', 'Luiz H Camara-Lopes', 'Katia R M Leite']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Can contemporary transrectal prostate biopsy accurately select candidates for hemi-ablative focal therapy of prostate cancer?', 'Side-specific factors associated with extracapsular extension and seminal vesicular invasion in men undergoing open radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

We sought to determine whether body mass index (BMI) has an impact on the rate and location of positive surgical margins (PSM) in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RLRP).  Methods:   Records of patients undergoing RLRP between the years 2003 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. We collected data regarding clinicopathologic data (i.e., age, BMI, PSA levels, Gleason score, pathologic stage, surgical margins status, and location). BMI was categorized as <25, 25-30, and >30 Kg/m(2). The rates of overall apical, peripheral, and prostate base (PB) PSM were compared across BMI groups.  Results:   Overall, 577 records were analyzed. Median age, PSA levels, and BMI were 60.1, 5.3, and 28.2, respectively. Percentage of Gleason score 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the entire series was 0.2, 2.1, 40.7, 53, 2.3, and 1.7, respectively. Four hundred eighty-four (81.8%) cases were pathologically organ-confined. The overall incidence of PSM was 23.1% (n = 133) of those 10.2% apical, 3.6% PB and 14.2% peripheral. There were no statistically significant differences found in the rate of PSM by location between BMI groups; however, in the obese group there was a tendency toward slightly higher involvement of the PB with tumor in all stages and greater involvement of all anatomic areas in the T3 pathologic stage.  Conclusions:   Although obesity has been associated with more aggressive prostate cancer, BMI does not appear to have statistically significant influence on the rate and location of PSM in RLRP.

Objective:   To show the applicability of combining preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative sentinel node imaging using an integrated diagnostic approach based on an imaging agent that is both radioactive and fluorescent.  Design, setting, and participants:   Before surgery, multimodal indocyanine green (ICG)-(99m)Tc-NanoColl was injected into the prostate. Subsequent lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging of pelvic nodes was performed to determine the location of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) preoperatively. During the surgical procedure a fluorescence laparoscope, optimized for detection in the near infrared range, was used to visualize the nodes identified on SPECT/CT. Eleven patients scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) with an increased risk of nodal metastasis, based on Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center/Kattan nomogram estimation, participated in a pilot assessment (N09IGF).  Surgical procedure:   Patients underwent RALP with LN dissection for prostate cancer.  Measurements:   Radioactive and fluorescent signals were monitored using different modalities, and the correlation between the two types of signals was studied. The location of preoperatively detected SLNs was documented.  Results and limitations:   Preoperatively, SLNs were identified by SPECT/CT, and the multimodal nature of the imaging agent also enabled intraoperative detection via fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence particularly improved surgical guidance in areas with a high radioactive background signal such as the injection site. Ex vivo analysis revealed a strong correlation between the radioactive and fluorescent content in the excised LNs. Fluorescence detection is limited by the severe tissue attenuation of the signal. Therefore, radio guidance to the areas of interest is still desirable.  Conclusions:   Initial data indicate that multimodal ICG-(99m)Tc-NanoColloid, in combination with a laparoscopic fluorescence laparoscope, can be used to facilitate and optimize dissection of SLNs during RALP procedures.""","""['Henk G van der Poel', 'Tessa Buckle', 'Oscar R Brouwer', 'Renato A Valdés Olmos', 'Fijs W B van Leeuwen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Henk G. van der Poel, Tessa Buckle, Oscar R.

Materials/methods:   Twenty patients received prostate radiotherapy in the supine position utilizing the Calypso Localization System® for prostate positioning and monitoring. For each patient, 10 treatment fractions were followed by a session in which the patient was repositioned prone, and prostate mobility was tracked. The fraction of time that the prostate was displaced by >3, 5, 7, and 10mm was calculated for each patient, for both positions (400 tracking sessions).  Results:   Clear patterns of respiratory motion were seen in the prone tracks due to the influence of increased abdominal motion. Averaged over all patients, the prostate was displaced >3 and 5mm for 37.8% and 10.1% of the total tracking time in the prone position, respectively. In the supine position, the prostate was displaced >3 and 5mm for 12.6% and 2.9%, respectively. With both patient setups, inferior and posterior drifts of the prostate position were observed. Averaged over all prone tracking sessions, the prostate was displaced >3mm in the posterior and inferior directions for 11.7% and 9.5% of the total time, respectively.  Conclusions:   With real-time tracking of the prostate, it is possible to study the effects of different setup positions on the prostate mobility. The percentage of time the prostate moved >3 and 5mm was increased by a factor of three in the prone versus supine position. For larger displacements (>7 mm) no difference in prostate mobility was observed between prone and supine positions.

A further 10% (10/96) developed AUR, 7% (7/96) had a ≥4 point rise in IPSS, 33% (32/96) required medical therapy for BPH and 11% (11/96) required bladder outlet surgery. There was low correlation between CD4(+) and CD8(+) densities in paired sections. CD4(+) and CD8(+) densities did not provide any significant predictive function in the progression of BPH, nor was their any predictive association noted between CD4(+) and CD8(+) scores and the development of prostate cancer. Sub-analysis did show that a threshold mean of ≥1.35 CD8(+) cells per field predicted progression to AUR with a sensitivity of 60% (95% confidence interval, CI, 26.2-87.8), specificity of 73.3% (95% CI 62.6-82.2) but a positive predictive value of 20.6% (95% CI 8.0-39.7). CD4(+) infiltrate density suggested a trend to general progression but without statistical significance.  Conclusion:   The present study, despite certain trends, shows no evidence for an association between CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes and the progression of LUTS in BPH.""","""['Alastair D Lamb', 'Motaz Qadan', 'Simon Roberts', 'Hannah Timlin', 'Sarah L Vowler', 'Fiona M Campbell', 'Ken Grigor', 'John M S Bartlett', 'S Alan McNeill']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte scores cannot reliably predict progression in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Alfuzosin 10 mg once daily prevents overall clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia but not acute urinary retention: results of a 2-year placebo-controlled study.', 'Evaluation of the clinical value of a simple flowmeter in the management of male lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'Symptom deterioration during treatment and history of AUR are the strongest predictors for AUR and BPH-related surgery in men with LUTS treated with alfuzosin 10 mg once daily.', 'The natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Definition of at-risk patients: dynamic variables.', 'Association between single nucleotide polymorphism of vitamin D receptor gene FokI polymorphism and clinical progress of benign prostatic hyperplasia.']"""

Limited data are available on familial mortality in melanoma. If fatal forms of melanoma were associated with fatal forms of melanoma or of some other cancers, only studies on familial mortality rather than on familial incidence might be able to detect them. Furthermore, estimates on familial aggregation based on mortality are free from bias of overdiagnosis.  Objectives:   The aim of this study was the estimation of familial aggregation of concordant melanoma and of melanoma and any other cancers based both on incidence and on mortality.  Methods:   We used the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for incident melanoma for relatives of any cancer patients and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for death from melanoma for relatives of individuals who died from any other cancer. Similar risks were determined for any common cancer when relatives were affected by melanoma.  Results:   For concordant melanoma, familial incidence equalled familial mortality, SIR=SMR. Familial clustering (SIRs increased) of melanoma and oesophageal, colorectal, breast, prostate, kidney, nervous system and connective tissue cancers and myeloma and leukaemia was observed. The SMRs for pancreatic and nervous system cancers were increased in relatives whose parents had died from melanoma.

Here we studied the fate of a novel combi-molecule of triazene class termed ""ZRS1"" in biological medium using multilayer aggregates and mouse tumour models. ZRS1 is a second generation derivative of RB107, a prodrug designed to release an EGFR inhibitor FD105 plus a methyl diazonium species. RB107 contains an acetoxymethyl function that is hydrolyzed too rapidly to generate BJ2000, a monoalkyltriazene that further degrades to FD105 and DNA alkylating methyldiazonium species. Recently, in order to prevent rapid hydrolysis of the acetoxymethylene function in the absence of cells and to delay the release of BJ2000, we designed ZRS1 that contains a more stable acetoxymethyl carbamate function. The results showed that ZRS1 was more stable than RB107 in cell culture medium supplemented with serum, with a rather long half life (>2 h). However, in an experiment where it was allowed to degrade in multilayer aggregates of ovarian cancer cells OV90, it rapidly released BJ2000 and its corresponding metabolite FD105, both in the medium and the multilayer aggregates. Interestingly, the intact ZRS1 could be detected in the multilayer aggregates with a T(max) around 10 min. Studies in vivo, in human DU145 prostate cancer xenograft model, revealed that ZRS1 blocked tumour growth and released FD105 and its acetylated metabolite FD105Ac, the latter being the major metabolite. Likewise, time course analysis in 4T1 mouse syngeneic breast cancer model showed a rapid release of FD105 and FD105Ac in the plasma and in the tumours. In summary, ZRS1 appeared as a good prodrug of the stable EGFR inhibitory metabolites FD105 and FD105Ac. Its ability to generate high concentrations of FD105Ac, a more potent EGFR inhibitor as is its major metabolite, is significant over previous methylating combi-molecules. Furthermore, this study showed that multilayer OV90 aggregates could be developed as an effective model to predict the stability and degradation of ZRS1 in vivo.""","""['Nahid Golabi', 'Zakaria Rachid', 'Qiyu Qiu', 'Ying Huang', 'Bertrand J Jean-Claude']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Drug Metab Lett""","""['Molecular analysis of the in vivo metabolism and biodistribution of metabolically and non-metabolically activated combi-molecules of the triazene class.', 'Characterization of the potency of epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-DNA targeting combi-molecules containing a hydrolabile carbamate at the 3-position of the triazene chain.', 'Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signaling by ""Combi-triazene"" BJ2000, a new probe for Combi-Targeting postulates.', 'Triazene compounds: mechanism of action and related DNA repair systems.', 'Novel substituted quinazolines for potent EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.']"""

Furthermore, its popularity continues to grow despite the lack of evidence for functional and oncologic superiority over other treatments. As a result, we modified operating room (OR) processes to determine if the times and costs that are associated with RALRP in an academic setting could be reduced.  Patients and methods:   Four modifications in OR processes were implemented: Trainee adherence to time-oriented surgical goals; use of a dedicated anesthesia team; simultaneous processing by nursing and urology house staff during case turnover; and identification and elimination of unused disposable instruments. Total surgical, anesthesia, and OR turnover times were measured. Payroll, surgical supply, OR time, and anesthesia costs were also measured. One hundred RALRP cases before and after the modifications were implemented were compared.  Results:   Patients undergoing RALRP were similar both before and after the modifications were implemented. Total surgical, anesthesia, and turnover times were reduced by 17.4 (6.8%, P=0.041), 4.5 (19.1%, P=0.006), and 12.1 (28.1%, P=0.005) minutes, respectively. Payroll, surgical supply, and OR costs were reduced by $330 (25%), $609 (15.7%), and $1638 (27.7%), respectively. There was no fiscally significant change in anesthesia costs.  Conclusions:   Using simple modifications, it is possible that RALRP efficiency can be improved by decreasing its associated times and costs. These modifications were implemented in an academic setting but may be used in any institution.

All patients underwent a dual freeze-thaw cycle using third-generation cryotechnology with ultrathin 17-gauge cryoneedles.  Results:   The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level for all patients at the last follow-up visit was less than 0.5 ng/ml in 94 patients (92.2%) and 0.5 ng/ml or more in 8 (7.8%). One patient (1.0%) had recurrent prostate cancer confirmed by prostate biopsy and was treated with salvage cryotherapy. Seven other patients (6.9%) had an elevated PSA level after cryotherapy despite negative posttreatment biopsies and a metastatic evaluation. Of 102 patients, 1 patient was incontinent preoperatively. Of the remaining 101 patients, 4 patients (4.0%) developed mild incontinence requiring 1 to 2 pads per day. Urethral sloughing occurred in 5 of the 102 patients (4.9%) and in 1 of these patients (1.0%) required transurethral resection of sloughing. The rates of erectile dysfunction were 64.1%. No urethral strictures, rectourethral fistulas, urinary retention, or chronic pelvic pain was reported. The median inpatient stay after cryoablation was 3.2 days.

With the recent recognition of pericytes as molecular regulators of angiogenesis, we have examined the interaction of these cells in actively growing new vessels.  Methods:   Pericyte interactions with developing new vessels were examined using transmission electron microscopy. Pericyte distribution was mapped from α-SMA+ immunostained histological sections and quantified using image analysis. Data was obtained from peripheral and more central regions of 27 cases with Gleason scores of 4-9.  Results:   Pericyte numbers were increased around developing new vessel sprouts at sites of luminal maturation. Numbers were reduced around the actively growing tips of migrating endothelial cells and functional new vessels. Tumor regions internal to a 500-μm peripheral band showed higher microvessel pericyte density than the peripheral region.  Conclusion:   Pericytes were found to be key cellular components of developing new vessels in adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

The leading sites for both genders have been maintained in the same order as in the previous report, but for males, there were increases in the incidence of prostate (ASR 65.5 vs. 78.1 per 100,000 per year) and colorectal (ASR 13.7 vs. 17.2 per 100,000 per year) cancers and a decrease in the incidence of cancer of the bronchus (ASR 22.8 vs. 18.6 per 100,000 per year). For females, there was a modest decrease in incidence of cervical cancer (ASR 19 vs. 17.4 per 100,000 per year) while the incidence of cancers of the breast and large bowel remained relatively stable (ASR 40.1 vs. 43 per 100,000 per year for breast and ASR 13 vs. 12.8 per 100,000 per year for colorectal cancer).

Deguelin, a rotenoid isolated from Mundulea sericea, has an anticancer effect against several types of cancers; however, the mechanism of its antitumor effects on prostate cancer is not well understood. The aim of our study was to elucidate the effect of deguelin on the growth of prostate cancer cells and its putative mechanism of action. Deguelin decreased the viability of both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells but not normal prostate epithelial cells. Downregulation of phosphorylated Akt and GSK-3β by deguelin promoted proteosomal degradation of β-catenin that resulted in decreased nuclear accumulation and inhibited transactivation of β-catenin-responsive genes. Deguelin-induced downregulation of proliferative (cyclin D1 and c-myc) and antiapoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and survivin) in prostate cancer cells culminated in the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell growth, altered membrane integrity, marked reduction of invasiveness, inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent colony formation. Our data demonstrated for the first time that deguelin inhibits the growth and survival of human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, and its anticancer and antimetastatic activity occurs, at least in part through downregulating GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway and antiapoptotic survival proteins.

The effect of CysLT1R antagonist on these cells was also examined using the MTT assay, Hoechst staining and flow cytometry. CysLT1R expression was significantly more extensive and intense in the malignant tissues than in normal tissues. Furthermore, CysLT1R antagonist induced a reduction in malignant cell viability through early apoptosis.

Brachytherapy can frequently be complicated by the development of fecal incontinence. The potential long-term impact of this dysfunction on a patient's life should be discussed.  Objective:   This study aimed to assess the long-term impact of brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer on fecal incontinence and to determine the impact and severity of the incontinence on patients' ability to engage in activities of daily living.  Design:   A retrospective observational study was performed. A questionnaire packet was mailed to patients who had received brachytherapy treatment for localized prostate cancer and were now more than 2 years out from initial seed implantation. Each packet contained the Colon and Ano-Rectal Impact Questionnaire (assessing quality of life), the Colon and Ano-Rectal Distress Inventory, and the Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score (both measured existence and severity of fecal incontinence).  Settings:   This study was conducted at Caritas Christi St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, a tertiary referral center in Boston, Massachusetts from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2007.  Patients:   One hundred forty-three of 568 patients (a 25% response rate) responded and were analyzed.  Interventions:   No interventions were performed.  Main outcome measures:   The main outcome was impact of fecal incontinence on quality of life.  Results:   : Of the responses to the Colon and Ano-Rectal Impact Questionnaire, 13.2% (19 patients) (P < .001) stated that fecal incontinence was impacting their ability to participate in their daily activities. Sixty-three percent (12 patients) (P < .001) of patients described the impact of the incontinence as slight, 21% (4 patients) (P < .001) described it as moderate, and 15.8% (3 patients) (P < .001) described it as severe.

OLFM4 is normally expressed in a limited number of tissues, including the prostate, but its biological functions in prostate are largely unknown. In this study, we found that OLFM4 messenger RNA was reduced or undetectable in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cell lines. To study the effects of OLFM4 on prostate cancer progression, we transfected PC-3 prostate cancer cells with OLFM4 to establish OLFM4-expressing PC-3 cell clones. The OLFM4-expressing PC-3 cell clones were found to have decreased proliferation and invasiveness compared with vector-transfected control PC-3 cells in vitro. In addition, nude mice injected with OLFM4-expressing PC-3 cells demonstrated reduced tumor growth and bone invasion and metastasis compared with mice injected with vector-transfected control cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that OLFM4 may exhibit its anticancer effects through regulating cell autophagy by targeting cathepsin D, as OLFM4 reduced cathepsin D protein levels and enzymatic activity and attenuated cathepsin D-induced cancer cell proliferation. In addition, overexpression of OLFM4 abrogated stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-induced PC-3 cell invasiveness in a Matrigel invasion assay, partially through blocking SDF-1-mediated AKT phosphorylation. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining studies in OLFM4-expressing PC-3 cells demonstrated a direct interaction between OLFM4 and cathepsin D or SDF-1.

Orthogonal on-board imager images were acquired and the couch shift to match both bony anatomy and the fiducial markers recorded. The set-up error using skin tattoos and offline bone correction was compared with online bone correction. The fiducial markers were used as the reference.  Results:   Data from 1923 fractions were analysed. The systematic error was ≤1 mm for all protocols. The average random error was 2-3mm for online bony correction and 3-5mm for skin tattoos or offline-bone. Online-bone showed a significant improvement compared with offline-bone in the number of patients with >5mm set-up errors for >10% (P<0.001) and >20% (P<0.003) of their fractions.  Conclusions:   Online correction to bony anatomy reduces both systematic and random set-up error in patients undergoing prostate radiotherapy, and is superior to offline correction methods for those patients not suitable for fiducial markers or daily soft-tissue imaging.""","""['M L Johnston', 'P Vial', 'K L Wiltshire', 'L J Bell', 'S Blome', 'Z Kerestes', 'G W Morgan', ""D O'Driscoll"", 'T P Shakespeare', 'T N Eade']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Comparison of prostate set-up accuracy and margins with off-line bony anatomy corrections and online implanted fiducial-based corrections.', 'Assessment of a daily online implanted fiducial marker-guided prostate radiotherapy process.', 'Daily online localization using implanted fiducial markers and its impact on planning target volume for carcinoma prostate.', 'Target margins in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', 'Evaluation of different set-up error corrections on dose-volume metrics in prostate IMRT using CBCT images.', 'Determination of optimal fiducial marker across image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) modalities: visibility and artifact analysis of gold, carbon, and polymer fiducial markers.', 'Impact of the frequency of online verifications on the patient set-up accuracy and set-up margins.']"""

The effect of other treatment- and patient-related factors is less well established. The aim of this study was to elucidate the influence of such factors in the development of late symptoms after radical radiotherapy to the prostate.  Materials and methods:   Patient- and treatment-related factors that are thought to influence the development of late toxicity were analysed in 788 patients who had received radical radiotherapy to the prostate in the Medical Research Council RT01 trial. Late toxicity data were recorded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, Late Effects of Normal Tissues/Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic, Royal Marsden Hospital and the University of California, Los Angeles, Prostate Cancer Index. Acute toxicity was measured using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system.  Results:   On multivariate analysis, acute bowel toxicity was statistically significantly associated with increased proctitis (hazard ratio=1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.18, 2.24; P=0.003) and increased stool frequency (hazard ratio=1.77, 95% confidence interval 1.27, 2.46; P=0.001). Hypertension was strongly associated with a decreased risk of poor urinary stream (hazard ratio=0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.09, 0.71; P=0.009). There was an increased risk of rectal bleeding with increased age (hazard ratio=1.04 per year of age, 95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.08; P=0.009). As expected, a higher prescribed dose increased the risk of several late toxicity end points. Although acute bladder toxicity was associated with the presence of bladder symptoms at 5 years, the effect disappeared for all symptoms except increased urinary frequency and haematuria when a change in bladder function from baseline was calculated. Patients with any pretreatment bladder symptoms were more likely to report increased urinary frequency (hazard ratio=2.09, 95% confidence interval 1.48, 2.95; P<0.0005), increased urinary incontinence (hazard ratio=4.22, 95% confidence interval 2.13, 8.35; P<0.0005) and decreased stream (hazard ratio=2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.62, 4.31; P<0.0005), after treatment and before the most recent follow-up assessment.  Conclusions:   In this study, increased acute gastrointestinal and bladder symptoms and prescribed dose were associated with increased late radiation toxicity. The presence of hypertension seemed to be protective for the development of late effects.

Methods and materials:   Three methods were used to analyze 39 VMAT treatment plans for brain, spine, and prostate: ion chamber (one-dimensional absolute, n = 39), film (2D relative, coronal/sagittal, n = 8), and 2D ion chamber array (ICA, 2D absolute, coronal/sagittal, n = 39) measurements. All measurements were compared with the treatment planning system dose calculation either via gamma analysis (3%, 3- to 4-mm distance-to-agreement criteria) or absolute point dose comparison. The film and ion chamber results were similarly compared with the ICA measurements.  Results:   Absolute point dose measurements agreed well with treatment planning system computed doses (ion chamber: median deviation, 1.2%, range, -0.6% to 3.3%; ICA: median deviation, 0.6%, range, -1.8% to 2.9%). The relative 2D dose measurements also showed good agreement with computed doses (>93% of pixels in all films passing gamma, >90% of pixels in all ICA measurements passing gamma). The ICA relative dose results were highly similar to those of film (>90% of pixels passing gamma). The coronal and sagittal ICA measurements were statistically indistinguishable by the paired t test with a hypothesized mean difference of 0.1%. The ion chamber and ICA absolute dose measurements showed a similar trend but had disparities of 2-3% in 18% of plans.  Conclusions:   After validating the new VMAT implementation with ion chamber, film, and ICA, we were able to maintain an effective yet efficient patient-specific VMAT QA protocol by reducing from five (ion chamber, film, and ICA) to two measurements (ion chamber and single ICA) per plan. The ICA (Matrixx®, IBA Dosimetry) was validated for VMAT QA, but ion chamber measurements are recommended for absolute dose comparison until future developments correct the ICA angular dependence.""","""[""Jennifer O'Daniel"", 'Shiva Das', 'Q Jackie Wu', 'Fang-Fang Yin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Patient-specific 3D pretreatment and potential 3D online dose verification of Monte Carlo-calculated IMRT prostate treatment plans.', 'A retrospective analysis for patient-specific quality assurance of volumetric-modulated arc therapy plans.', 'Measurement comparison and Monte Carlo analysis for volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) delivery verification using the ArcCHECK dosimetry system.', 'Applications of machine and deep learning to patient-specific IMRT/VMAT quality assurance.', 'A six-year review of more than 13,000 patient-specific IMRT QA results from 13 different treatment sites.', 'A novel angular dependency model for MatriXX response and its application to true composite dose verification for IMRT plans.', 'Intrinsic detector sensitivity analysis as a tool to characterize ArcCHECK and EPID sensitivity to variations in delivery for lung SBRT VMAT plans.', 'Correlation between gamma index passing rate and clinical dosimetric difference for pre-treatment 2D and 3D volumetric modulated arc therapy dosimetric verification.', 'Correlation of phantom-based and log file patient-specific QA with complexity scores for VMAT.', 'Patient-specific quality assurance for the delivery of (60)Co intensity modulated radiation therapy subject to a 0.35-T lateral magnetic field.']"""

Methods and materials:   Patients accrued to this study had histologically confirmed, locally confined adenocarcinoma of the prostate clinical stage T1b, T1c, or T2a; no nodal or metastatic disease; prostate-specific antigen level of ≤10 ng/ml; and a Gleason score of ≤6. All patients underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided radioactive I125 seed implantation into the prostate. The prescribed dose was 145 Gy to the prostate planning target volume.  Results:   A total of 101 patients from 27 institutions were accrued to this protocol; by design, no single institution accrued more than 8 patients. There were 94 eligible patients.

We present an analysis of PTV adequacy and a proposed adaptive process.  Methods and materials:   Tracking data were analyzed for 15 patients who underwent step-and-shoot multi-leaf collimation (SMLC) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with uniform 5-mm PTV margins for prostate cancer using the Calypso® Localization System. Additional plans were generated with 0- and 3-mm margins. A custom software application using the planned dose distribution and structure location from computed tomography (CT) simulation was developed to evaluate the dosimetric impact to the target due to motion. The dose delivered to the prostate was calculated for the initial three, five, and 10 fractions, and for the entire treatment. Treatment was accepted as adequate if the minimum delivered prostate dose (D(min)) was at least 98% of the planned D(min).  Results:   For 0-, 3-, and 5-mm PTV margins, adequate treatment was obtained in 3 of 15, 12 of 15, and 15 of 15 patients, and the delivered D(min) ranged from 78% to 99%, 96% to 100%, and 99% to 100% of the planned D(min). Changes in D(min) did not correlate with magnitude of prostate motion. Treatment adequacy during the first 10 fractions predicted sufficient dose delivery for the entire treatment for all patients and margins.  Conclusions:   Our adaptive process successfully used real-time tracking data to predict the need for PTV modifications, without the added burden of physician contouring and image analysis.

Aim of the study:   The purpose of this study is to investigate the inhibitory effect of Typhonium blumei (Tb) extract on the viability of different cancer cells and the apoptotic effect of this extract on A549 lung cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Human A549 cell line and other cancer cell lines were treated with different concentrations of Tb extract at different time intervals. Growth inhibition was determined by MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected by cell morphologic observation, cell cycle analysis, and immunoblot analysis on the expression of protein associated with cell death. GC-MS were used to determine the chemical constituents of this extract.  Results:   The Tb extract had cytotoxicity toward A549 lung cancer cells (IC(50)=97.7 μg/ml), LNCaP prostate cancer cells (IC(50)=124.5 μg/ml) and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (IC(50)=125.8 μg/ml). Conversely, the adverse effects of Tb extract on normal embryonic lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells (IC(50)=245.5 μg/ml) and embryonic kidney fibroblast HEK293 cells (IC(50)=251.1 μg/ml) were comparatively low. Cytometric analysis results demonstrate that A549 cells were arrested at the G2/M phase by treatment with Tb extract. The extract induced A549 cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway by down-regulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein expression, up-regulating Bax, Bad and Bak protein expression, and activating caspase-9 and caspase-3. Experimental results of bioactive compound analysis indicate that dibutyl phthalate, α-linolenic acid, phytol, campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol were the major bioactive ingredients of Tb extract. Although all these compounds had good anti-proliferative effects on A549 cells, campesterol (IC(50)=2.2 μM for 24h treatment) and β-sitosterol (IC(50)=1.9 μM for 24h treatment) displayed the greatest inhibitory activity.

This study assessed the cost effectiveness of ZOL for SRE management in French, German, Portuguese, and Dutch HRPC patients.  Methods:   This analysis was based on the results of a randomized phase III clinical trial wherein HRPC patients received up to 15 months of ZOL (n = 214) or placebo (n = 208). Clinical inputs were obtained from the trial. Costs were estimated using hospital tariffs, published, and internet sources. Quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were estimated from a separate analysis of EQ-5D scores reported in the trial. Uncertainty surrounding outcomes was addressed via univariate sensitivity analyses.  Results:   ZOL patients experienced an estimated 0.759 fewer SREs and gained an estimated 0.03566 QALYs versus placebo patients.

In the prostate, epithelial tissue damage followed by cell regeneration in the presence of inflammation is believed to be a key event in neoplastic transformation. According to the 'injury and regeneration' model, inflammatory cells infiltrating the prostate release reactive species in response to bacterial/viral infection, uric acid, or dietary prostate carcinogens. Besides inducing inflammation, tissue injury by these and other agents would promote the appearance of proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA). A subset of proliferating atrophic cells - possibly showing stem-cell features - may be exposed to the genotoxic insult of free radicals and to an increased rate of mutations and chromosomal aberrations, ultimately leading to neoplastic initiation, promotion and progression. In the last decade, the link between inflammation and cancer and the hypothesis pointing to PIA as a risk lesion for prostate cancer have been extensively investigated at the pre-clinical, clinical, morphological, cellular and molecular levels.

However, the role of substrata topography in the regulation of cancer cell motility has been quantitatively studied in only a few cases. We demonstrated that human (DU-145) and rat (MAT-LyLu and AT-2) prostate cancer cells are efficiently contact guided by underlying normal cells when invading surrounding tissues and forming metastases. Prostate cancer cells moving on the surface of fibroblasts displayed significantly greater cell displacement than those moving on plastic substrata. This effect was correlated with the polarization (contact guidance) and increased speed of cell movements. We subsequently verified the hypothesis that the observed contact guidance of prostate cancer cells migrating on the surface of fibroblasts results from their reaction to the microtopography of normal cells. The responses of cells to multiple grooved substrata of a size corresponding to the dimensions of a compact monolayer culture of human skin fibroblasts were studied, and the migration of prostate cancer cells appeared to be efficiently affected by topographical features of the substratum. In contrast to random movement under control conditions, all investigated prostate cancer cell lines grown on patterned substrata migrated mainly along artificial grooves and covered, as a result of contact guidance, a longer distance than cells on plain substrata. Moreover, the reaction to microtopography was correlated with the metastatic activity of prostate cancer cells. In conclusion, our results show that grooved substrata have a substantial effect on prostate cancer migration. Since all types of tissue show some kind of patterning and alignment, topographic factors may be crucial for the effective migration of prostate cancer cells during the metastatic process.""","""['Michal Sarna', 'Ewa Wybieralska', 'Katarzyna Miekus', 'Justyna Drukala', 'Zbigniew Madeja']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Contact stimulation of prostate cancer cell migration: the role of gap junctional coupling and migration stimulated by heterotypic cell-to-cell contacts in determination of the metastatic phenotype of Dunning rat prostate cancer cells.', 'Activation of macrophage-like cells by multiple grooved substrata.

The effects of Telmisartan as well as of other ARBs (Candesartan, Valsartan, Irbesartan and Losartan) on RCC cell growth were examined by MTT assay. Flow cytometry and Hoechst staining were used to determine whether or not the ARBs induced apoptosis. Telmisartan caused marked inhibition in RCC cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with 100 µM of Telmisartan induced early apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in the RCC cells, but not in the PRTECs.

Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that conjugates of cell membrane disrupting lytic peptides and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) target and destroy human prostate and breast cancer cells in xenografts in the nude mouse model (Hansel et al., Mol Cell Endocrinol 2007;260-262:183-9; Hansel et al., Mol Cell Endocrinol 2007;269:26-33), which express LHRH receptors. The objectives of our study were to synthesize a bioconjugate of LHRH analog ([DLys(6)]-LHRH) and a dietary microchemical (curcumin) and test the hypothesis that [DLys(6)]-LHRH-curcumin targets and inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro studies, we determined by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction that MIAPaCa-2, Panc-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell lines express LHRH receptors. [DLys(6)]-LHRH-curcumin inhibited cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines and induced apoptotic cell death (p < 0.05). Apoptosis was induced by cleavage of polyadenosine-5'-diphosphate-ribose-polymerase and caspase-3. The activity of [DLys(6)]-LHRH-curcumin was equal to free curcumin at equimolar concentrations in vitro. Unlike curcumin itself, the [DLys(6)]-LHRH-curcumin conjugate is water soluble which allows its intravenous administration. In two in vivo studies, [DLys(6)]-LHRH-curcumin given intravenously caused a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in tumor weights and volumes, and free curcumin given by gavage at an equal dose failed to cause a significant reduction in tumor weights and volumes in the nude mouse pancreatic cancer model. [DLys(6)]-LHRH-curcumin treatment enhanced apoptosis compared to [DLys(6)]-LHRH and vehicle-treated controls in tumor tissue.

Methods:   The authors retrospectively reviewed 6624 patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2000 to 2010 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Patients were stratified by surgical approach (open, laparoscopic, or robotic) and by risk category (low, intermediate, or high). Patients with low-risk disease, without intervention, and with a minimum follow-up of 6 months were considered to have elected AS.  Results:   The number of patients who had AS increased from <20 per year between 2000 and 2004 to ≥ 100 per year between 2007 and 2009. Over the same decade, the number of patients who underwent MIS (laparoscopic or robotic) increased from zero to 63% of all surgical cases. The percentage of patients in the intermediate-risk and high-risk categories increased over time, whereas the percentage of patients in the low-risk category decreased (odds ratio [OR] per year, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-0.92; P < .0005). The proportion of patients who underwent surgery with Gleason 6 tumors decreased over time (OR per year, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.85-0.88; P < .0005), whereas pathologic stage and Gleason score increased (P < .0005). The proportion of low-risk patients decreased across all types of surgery, and the largest decrease was observed for robotic surgery (P < .0005).

Nonsurgical treatment of early stage prostate cancer is an important alternative. The use of MRI for tumor cryoablation is of particular interest: it offers lower morbidity compared with other localized techniques. However, the current manual procedure is very time-consuming and has limited accuracy. A novel robotic assistant is therefore designed for prostate cancer cryotherapy treatment under MRI guidance to improve efficiency and accuracy.  Methods:   Gesture definition was achieved based on actions of interventional radiologists at University Hospital of Strasbourg. A transperineal approach with a semiautonomous prostatic cryoprobe localization procedure was developed where the needle axis is automatically positioned before manual insertion. The workflow was developed simultaneously with the robotic assistant used for needle positioning.  Results:   The design and the associated workflow of an original wire-driven manipulator were developed. The device is compact and has a low weight: its overall dimensions in the scanner are 100 × 100 × 40 mm with a weight of 120 g. Very good MRI compatibility was demonstrated.

In this study, nano-bombesin labeling by a pre-targeting system was undertaken to develop an alternative approach for prostate tumor treatment.  Methods:   A two-step pre-targeting system utilizing a combination of streptavidin (SA), biotinylated morpholino (B-MORF), biotinylated BBN (B-BBN) with two different spacers (b-Ala and PEG), and a radiolabeled cMORF was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Final conjugation conditions consisted of a 1:1:2 ratio of SA:B-MORF:B-BBN, followed by addition of 99mTc-cMORF to compensate for free MORF. In vitro binding experiments with prostate cancer cells (PC-3) revealed that total binding was time-dependent for the Ala spacer but not for the PEG spacer. The highest accumulation (5.06 ± 1.98 %) was achieved with 1 hour of incubation, decreasing as time progressed. Specific binding fell to 1.05 ± 0.35 %. The pre-targeting biodistribution in healthy Swiss mice was measured at different time points, with the best responses observed for 7-h and 15-h incubations. The effector, 99mTc-MAG3-cMORF, was administered 2 h later. Strong kidney excretion was always documented. The greatest tumor uptake was 2.58 ± 0.59 %ID/g at 7 h for B-bAla-BBN, with a region of interest (ROI) value of 3.9 % during imaging. The tumor/blood ratio was low due to the slow blood clearance; however, the tumor/muscle ratio was 5.95.  Conclusions:   The pre-targeting approach with a peptide was a viable concept. Further evaluation with modified sequences of MORF, including less cytosine, and additional test intervals could be worthwhile.""","""['Bluma Linkowski Faintuch', 'Gustavo Eutimio Fernandez Núñez', 'Rodrigo Teodoro', 'Ana M Moro', 'Jair Mengatti']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clinics (Sao Paulo)""","""['Synthesis and radiopharmacological evaluation of a high-affinity and metabolically stabilized 18F-labeled bombesin analogue for molecular imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-expressing prostate cancer.', 'Radiolabeled bombesin analogs for prostate cancer diagnosis: preclinical studies.', ""Organometallic 99mTc(III) '4 + 1' bombesin(7-14) conjugates: synthesis, radiolabeling, and in vitro/in vivo studies."", 'Predicting the biodistribution of radiolabeled cMORF effector in MORF-pretargeted mice.', '18F-labeled bombesin analogs for targeting GRP receptor-expressing prostate cancer.', 'STL127705 synergize with olaparib in castration-resistant prostate cancer by inhibiting homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining repair.', 'Methods for Radiolabelling Nanoparticles: SPECT Use (Part 1).', 'Synthesis, Characterization and Evaluation of Peptide Nanostructures for Biomedical Applications.', 'Anti-CD20 Immunoglobulin G Radiolabeling with a 99mTc-Tricarbonyl Core: In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluations.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis hormones in the sera of men with prostate cancer and atypical small acinar proliferation as well as those with normal biopsies.  Methods:   A study cohort of 186 men with suspected prostate cancer who had undergone transrectal prostate biopsies was used in this study. The patients were divided into the following three groups based on the histology of the biopsy samples: no neoplasia, atypical small acinar proliferation or prostate cancer. Demographic data were also collected. Levels of total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, estradiol, and serum prostate-specific antigen were measured in blood samples.  Results:   Initially, 123 men were found to be without neoplasia, 26 with atypical small acinar proliferation and 37 with prostate cancer. After a second biopsy was taken from the men diagnosed with atypical small acinar proliferation, the diagnoses were revised: 18 were diagnosed with atypical small acinar proliferation and 45 with prostate cancer. No significant differences between the groups were identified regarding age, smoking history, chronic diseases, body mass index or PSA levels (P >.0.05). The mean serum levels of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin and estradiol were similar in all of the groups (P >.0.05). Furthermore, in individuals with prostate cancer, the Gleason scores and prevalence of hypogonadism were not significantly different (P.> 0.05).

Consequently, an increasing number of HIV-infected people are at risk of non-AIDS-defining cancers that typically occur at older ages. We estimated the annual number of cancers in the HIV-infected population, both with and without AIDS, in the United States.  Methods:   Incidence rates for individual cancer types were obtained from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study by linking 15 HIV and cancer registries in the United States. Estimated counts of the US HIV-infected and AIDS populations were obtained from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance data. We obtained estimated counts of AIDS-defining (ie, Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical cancer) and non-AIDS-defining cancers in the US AIDS population during 1991-2005 by multiplying cancer incidence rates and AIDS population counts, stratified by year, age, sex, race and ethnicity, transmission category, and AIDS-relative time. We tested trends in counts and standardized incidence rates using linear regression models. We multiplied overall cancer rates and HIV-only (HIV infected, without AIDS) population counts, available from 34 US states during 2004-2007, to estimate cancers in the HIV-only population. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   The US AIDS population expanded fourfold from 1991 to 2005 (96,179 to 413,080) largely because of an increase in the number of people aged 40 years or older. During 1991-2005, an estimated 79 656 cancers occurred in the AIDS population. From 1991-1995 to 2001-2005, the estimated number of AIDS-defining cancers decreased by greater than threefold (34,587 to 10,325 cancers; P(trend) < .001), whereas non-AIDS-defining cancers increased by approximately threefold (3193 to 10,059 cancers; P(trend) < .001). From 1991-1995 to 2001-2005, estimated counts increased for anal (206 to 1564 cancers), liver (116 to 583 cancers), prostate (87 to 759 cancers), and lung cancers (875 to 1882 cancers), and Hodgkin lymphoma (426 to 897 cancers). In the HIV-only population in 34 US states, an estimated 2191 non-AIDS-defining cancers occurred during 2004-2007, including 454 lung, 166 breast, and 154 anal cancers.  Conclusions:   Over a 15-year period (1991-2005), increases in non-AIDS-defining cancers were mainly driven by growth and aging of the AIDS population.

The primary end point was overall survival (OS), assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   At an interim analysis, more deaths were noted in the ASCENT arm, and the trial was halted. The median-follow-up for patients alive at last assessment was 11.7 months. Median OS was 17.8 months (95% CI, 16.0 to 19.5) in the ASCENT arm and 20.2 months (95% CI, 18.8 to 23.0) in the control arm (log-rank P = .002). Survival remained inferior after adjusting for baseline variables (hazard ratio, 1.33; P = .019). The two arms were similar in rates of total and serious adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were GI (reported in 75% of patients), and blood and lymphatic disorders (48%). Docetaxel toxicity leading to dose modification was more frequent in the ASCENT (31%) than in the control arm (15%).

Kilovoltage cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging can be used to monitor and compensate for inter-fraction prostate motion, but this procedure increases treatment session time and adds incidental radiation dose to the patient. We carried out a retrospective study of CBCT data to evaluate the systematic and random correction shifts of the prostate with respect to bones and external marks.  Materials and methods:   A total of 449 daily CBCT studies from 17 patients undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for localised prostate cancer were analysed. The difference between patient set-up correction shifts applied by radiation therapists (via matching prostate position in CBCT and planning computed tomography) and shifts obtained by matching bony anatomy in the same studies was used as a measure of the daily inter-fraction internal prostate motion.  Results:   The average systematic and random shifts in prostate positions, calculated over all fractions versus only 10 fractions, were not found to be significantly different.  Discussion:   The measured prostate shifts with respect to bony anatomy and external marks after the first 10 imaging sessions were shown to provide adequate predictive power for defining patient-specific margins in future fractions without a need for ongoing computed tomography imaging. Different options for CBCT imaging schedule are proposed that will reduce the treatment session time and imaging dose to radiotherapy patients while ensuring appropriate prostate cover and normal tissue sparing.""","""['J A Snir', 'J J Battista', 'G Bauman', 'S Yartsev']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Intrafraction motion of the prostate during an IMRT session: a fiducial-based 3D measurement with Cone-beam CT.', 'Correction of patient positioning errors based on in-line cone beam CTs: clinical implementation and first experiences.', 'Probabilistic dose distribution from interfractional motion in carbon ion radiation therapy for prostate cancer shows rectum sparing with moderate target coverage degradation.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Comparison between manual and automatic image registration in image-guided radiation therapy using megavoltage cone-beam computed tomography with an imaging beam line for prostate cancer.', '2D kV orthogonal imaging with fiducial markers is more precise for daily image guided alignments than soft-tissue cone beam computed tomography for prostate radiation therapy.', 'A novel CBCT-based method for derivation of CTV-PTV margins for prostate and pelvic lymph nodes treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy.', 'The impact of androgen deprivation therapy on setup errors during external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Is it essential to use fiducial markers during cone-beam CT-based radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients?']"""

There is an urgent need for more accurate biomarkers.  Objective:   To compare the diagnostic accuracy of PSA isoform p2PSA and its derivatives in determining the presence of PCa at initial biopsy with the accuracy of other predictors in patients with tPSA 2.0-10 ng/ml.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted an observational prospective study in a real clinical setting of consecutive men with tPSA 2.0-10 ng/ml and negative digital rectal examination who were scheduled for prostate biopsy at a tertiary academic center.  Intervention:   Outpatient transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies were performed according to a standardized institutional saturation scheme (18-22 cores).  Measurements:   We determined the diagnostic accuracy of serum tPSA, %fPSA, PSAD, p2PSA, %p2PSA [(p2PSA/fPSA)×100] and the Beckman Coulter Prostate Health Index (phi; [p2PSA/fPSA×√tPSA]).  Results and limitations:   Overall, 107 of 268 patients (39.9%) were diagnosed with PCa at extended prostate biopsies. Statistically significant differences between patients with and without PCa were observed for age, prostate and transition zone volume, PSAD, %p2PSA, and phi (all p values<0.05). In univariate accuracy analysis, phi and %p2PSA were the most accurate predictors of PCa (area under the curve: 75.6% and 75.7%, respectively), followed by transition zone volume (66%), prostate volume (65%), patient age (63%), PSAD (61%), %fPSA (58%), and tPSA (53%). In multivariate accuracy analyses, both phi (+11%) and %p2PSA (+10%) significantly improved the accuracy of established predictors in determining the presence of PCa at biopsy (p<0.001). Although %p2PSA and phi were significantly associated with Gleason score (Spearman ρ: 0.303 and 0.387, respectively; p ≤ 0.002), they did not improve the prediction of Gleason score ≥7 PCa in multivariable accuracy analyses (p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   In patients with a tPSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml, %p2PSA and phi are the strongest predictors of PCa at initial extended biopsies and are significantly more accurate than the currently used tests (tPSA, %fPSA, and PSAD) in determining the presence of PCa at biopsy.""","""['Giorgio Guazzoni', 'Luciano Nava', 'Massimo Lazzeri', 'Vincenzo Scattoni', 'Giovanni Lughezzani', 'Carmen Maccagnano', 'Fernanda Dorigatti', 'Ferruccio Ceriotti', 'Marina Pontillo', 'Vittorio Bini', 'Massimo Freschi', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Patrizio Rigatti']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate cancer biomarkers to improve risk stratification: is our knowledge of prostate cancer sufficient to spare prostate biopsies safely?', 'How to tell if a new marker improves prediction.', 'Preoperative prostate-specific antigen isoform p2PSA and its derivatives, %p2PSA and prostate health index, predict pathologic outcomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Clinical performance of serum prostate-specific antigen isoform -2proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives, %p2PSA and the prostate health index (PHI), in men with a family history of prostate cancer: results from a multicentre European study, the PROMEtheuS project.', 'Clinical performance of serum isoform -2proPSA (p2PSA), and its derivatives %p2PSA and the Prostate Health Index, in men aged <60 years: results from a multicentric European study.', 'Clinical performance of serum -2proPSA derivatives, %p2PSA and PHI, in the detection and management of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A prospective study of the prostate health index density and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'A comprehensive comparison between mpMRI of the prostate, MR-US fusion biopsy and whole mount histopathology.', 'High-throughput precision MRI assessment with integrated stack-ensemble deep learning can enhance the preoperative prediction of prostate cancer Gleason grade.', 'Covariate-specific evaluation of continuous biomarker.', 'Molecular Biomarkers for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

Nevertheless, suspicious images are frequently not found. Imaging analysis studies aim to identify ultrasound patterns characteristic of apparently hidden conditions.  Material and methods:   We digitally recorded 288 TRUS ultrasound guided transrectal biopsies and extracted 3 static images from the puncture-biopsy area. The extraction of the texture characteristics were obtained by ""simple mapping"" on a gray scale and spatial gray level dependence matrices (SGLDM), also known as Haralick's co-occurrence matrices, which study the relationship of each pixel and its neighbors. A pattern recognition software system was developed with two different classification methods: nearest neighbor (k-NN) and Markov's hidden models. Finally, a virtual experiment was carried out in which four urologists compared their diagnostic accuracy for prostate cancer with our system in 408 TRUS images, not in real time.  Results:   The diagnostic capacity (R.O.C. curve) with the simple gray map study was 59.7% with nearest-neighbor classification and 61.6% with Markov's hidden models classification. The co-occurrence matrices showed an area under R.O.C. curve of 60.1% and 60.0% with k-NN and Markov's hidden models classification, respectively. The virtual experiment was conducted with a simple gray map study and k-NN classification. The images processed by our system showed the following diagnostic accuracy: 63.3, 67, 64.3 and 63.7% compared to 61.7, 60.5, 66.2 and 60.7% with the original image.

Although resveratrol modulates multiple pathways in tumor cells, how resveratrol or its affected pathways converge on chromatin to mediate its effects is not known. Using glioma cells as a model, we showed here that resveratrol inhibited cell proliferation and induced cellular hypertrophy by transforming spindle-shaped cells to enlarged, irregular and flatten-shaped ones. We further showed that resveratrol-induced hypertrophic cells expressed senescence-associated-β-galactosidase, suggesting that resveratrol-induced cellular senescence in glioma cells. Consistent with these observations, we demonstrated that resveratrol inhibited clonogenic efficiencies in vitro and tumor growth in a xenograft model. Furthermore, we found that acute treatment of resveratrol inhibited mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B at K120 (uH2B) in breast, prostate, pancreatic, lung, brain tumor cells as well as primary human cells. Chronic treatment with low doses of resveratrol also inhibited uH2B in the resveratrol-induced senescent glioma cells. Moreover, we showed that depletion of RNF20, a ubiquitin ligase of histone H2B, inhibited uH2B and induced cellular senescence in glioma cells in vitro, thereby recapitulated the effects of resveratrol. Taken together, our results suggest that uH2B is a novel direct or indirect chromatin target of resveratrol and RNF20 plays an important role in inhibiting cellular senescence programs that are intact in glioma cells.""","""['Zhen Gao', 'Michael S Xu', 'Tamara L Barnett', 'C Wilson Xu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Glucose metabolism induces mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B in mammalian cells.', 'Resveratrol and quercetin cooperate to induce senescence-like growth arrest in C6 rat glioma cells.', 'Premature mitochondrial senescence and related ultrastructural changes during lung carcinogenesis modulation by curcumin and resveratrol.', 'Biological activity of piceatannol: leaving the shadow of resveratrol.', 'Resveratrol for breast cancer prevention and therapy: Preclinical evidence and molecular mechanisms.', 'Natural Compounds as Promising Adjuvant Agents in The Treatment of Gliomas.', 'Epigenetics of Aging and Aging-Associated Diseases.', 'Towards resolving the enigma of the dichotomy of resveratrol: cis- and trans-resveratrol have opposite effects on TyrRS-regulated PARP1 activation.', 'Natural Polyphenols Targeting Senescence: A Novel Prevention and Therapy Strategy for Cancer.', 'The Plant-Derived Compound Resveratrol in Brain Cancer: A Review.']"""

CONCLUSION • Overall levels of PSA testing in UK general practice remain low, but for those tested there are important variations by age, deprivation and geographical location that do not appear to reflect clinical need or the intention of current policy. • PSA testing in general practice is currently skewed towards older men, and current policy enabling all men to make an informed choice about PSA testing is not being effectively implemented as uptake clearly varies by socioeconomic status. • This reinforces the need for robust evidence regarding the costs and benefits of using the PSA test for the detection of localized prostate cancer in the UK, a full assessment of the health economic implications and a revision of the current policy.""","""['Naomi Williams', 'Laura J Hughes', 'Emma L Turner', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'David E Neal', 'Richard M Martin', 'Chris Metcalfe']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing of men in UK general practice: a 10-year longitudinal cohort study.', 'Prostate-specific antigen testing among the elderly in community-based family medicine practices.', 'Rates of prostate-specific antigen testing in general practice in England and Wales in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients: a cross-sectional study.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Increasing the uptake in a general practice prostate cancer screening programme.', 'Prostate-specific antigen testing and opportunistic prostate cancer screening: a cohort study in England, 1998-2017.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Association between inflammatory bowel disease and prostate cancer: A large-scale, prospective, population-based study.', 'Emerging cancer incidence, mortality, hospitalisation and associated burden among Australian cancer patients, 1982 - 2014: an incidence-based approach in terms of trends, determinants and inequality.']"""

Allosteric activation of SFKs occurs through well-defined post-translational mechanisms, however the SFK member Fyn is over-expressed in multiple human cancers (prostate, melanoma, pancreatic, glioma, chronic myelogenous leukemia) and the mechanism of increased Fyn expression is unclear. Since activation of Ras oncogenes is a common oncogenic event leading to the activation of multiple effector pathways, we explored if Ras could induce Fyn expression. Retroviral transduction of the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT with oncogenic H-Ras dramatically up-regulated Fyn mRNA (>100-fold, P < 0.001), protein, and kinase activity without affecting Src levels or activity. Activation of Akt, but not MAPK or EGFR, was necessary and sufficient for induction of Fyn by H-Ras. Expression of active Fyn was sufficient to increase HaCaT cell migration and invasion, and the enhanced migration and invasion induced by H-Ras could be significantly blocked (70% reduction, P < 0.01) by knockdown of Fyn with a specific siRNA or inhibition of SFKs with PP2. In addition, expression of Fyn in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was dependent on PI3K activity and was involved in their invasive phenotype. Thus, the Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway can account for Fyn over-expression in cancers, and Fyn is a critical mediator of the Ras-stimulated invasive cell phenotype. These results support the development of therapeutic strategies targeting Akt/Fyn pathway to block migration and invasion of tumor cells.""","""['Vipin Yadav', 'Mitchell F Denning']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['FYN: emerging biological roles and potential therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'The inhibition of SRC family kinase suppresses pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.', 'Targeting Fyn in Ras-transformed cells induces F-actin to promote adherens junction-mediated cell-cell adhesion.', 'Deficiency of Fyn protein is prerequisite for apoptosis induced by Src family kinase inhibitors in human mesothelioma cells.', 'The Importance of Being PI3K in the RAS Signaling Network.', 'FYN/TOPK/HSPB1 axis facilitates the proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer.', 'FYN: emerging biological roles and potential therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'Gastrulation Screening to Identify Anti-metastasis Drugs in Zebrafish Embryos.', 'Synthetic lethal kinases in Ras/p53 mutant squamous cell carcinoma.', 'A zebrafish embryo screen utilizing gastrulation identifies the HTR2C inhibitor pizotifen as a suppressor of EMT-mediated metastasis.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of statins was associated with prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   We conducted a population-based case-control study in Taiwan. Data were retrospectively collected from the Taiwan National health Insurance Research Database. Cases consisted of all patients who were aged 50 years and older and had a first-time diagnosis of prostate cancer for the period between 2005 and 2008. The controls were matched to cases by age, sex, and index date. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by using multiple logistic regression.  Results:   We examined 388 prostate cancer cases and 1,552 controls. We found that ever-use of any statin was associated with a significant increase in prostate cancer risk (OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.09-2.19). Compared with no use of statins, the adjusted ORs (95%CI) were 1.17 (0.60-2.28) for the group with cumulative dose ≤29.44 DDD, 1.59 (1.02-2.48) for the group with cumulative dose between 29.44 DDD and 321.33 DDD, and 1.86 (1.03-3.37) for the group with the highest cumulative dose (≥321.33 DDD). Also, there was a significant trend toward increasing prostate cancer risk with increasing cumulative dose (χ(2) for linear trend = 7.23, P = 0.007).

In advanced prostate cancer (PCa) the use of chemotherapy is mainly palliative due to its high resistance. Previously, we described that MDR phenotype in PCa could be related with high basal and drug-induced expression of MDR proteins P-Glycoprotein (P-Gp), MRP1, and LRP.  Methods:   Using primary cell cultures from PCa patients, we evaluated the effect of function and expression inhibition of P-Gp, MRP1, and LRP, on cell survival after chemotherapy exposure. Cells were treated with specific MDR protein substrates (docetaxel and mitoxantrone for P-Gp, methotrexate for MRP1 and cisplatin for LRP) and pharmacological inhibitors (cyclosporine A, genistein and 3-aminobenzamide), and cell survival was evaluated trough 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and cell cycle analysis. MRP1 activity was evaluated by FACS using the specific inhibitor MK571. Cells were transfected with MDR proteins siRNAs and treated with the corresponding substrates.  Results:   PCa cell resistance to MDR protein substrates was partially reversed, decreasing cell survival in around 20%, by treating primary cell cultures with specific pharmacological inhibitors. PCa cells transfected with siRNAs against MDR proteins decreased cell survival when treated with the corresponding drugs. Docetaxel was the most effective chemotherapeutic drug to induce cell death and decrease survival.  Conclusion:   Low chemotherapy response in PCa could be explained, in part, by over-expression of functional MDR proteins. Expression and function of these proteins should be evaluated to enhance efficacy of docetaxel-based therapies of patients with hormone-resistant PCa.""","""['Catherine Sánchez', 'Alejandro Mercado', 'Héctor R Contreras', 'Patricia Mendoza', 'Juan Cabezas', 'Cristian Acevedo', 'Christian Huidobro', 'Enrique A Castellón']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Expression of multidrug resistance proteins in prostate cancer is related with cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs.', 'Formononetin potentiates epirubicin-induced apoptosis via ROS production in HeLa cells in vitro.', 'Fractionated irradiation can induce functionally relevant multidrug resistance gene and protein expression in human tumor cell lines.', 'Multidrug resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Is MDR 1 gene a key to successful chemotherapy?.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Proteomic analyses identify major vault protein as a prognostic biomarker for fatal prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of Taxane Resistance.', 'Inhibiting autophagy overcomes docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.']"""

Stat3 is a specific regulator of pro-carcinogenic inflammation and represents a promising therapeutic target. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)α, which mediates the cellular response to hypoxia, has been demonstrated to be over-expressed in many human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis and treatment failure in clinic. To develop a potent strategy to increase therapeutic efficacy and reduce drug resistance in prostate cancer therapy, we combined two anti-cancer agents: T40214 (a p-Stat3 inhibitor) and JG244 (a HIF-1α inhibitor) together to treat nude mice bearing human prostate tumor (DU145) and immunocompetent mice (C57BL/6) bearing murine prostate tumor (TRAMP-C2).  Methods:   We employed in vitro and in vivo assays, including Western blots, cell cycle analysis, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL and xenograft models to determine the drug efficacy and mechanism of combination treatment of T40214 and JG244.  Results:   We found that compared to treatment by T40214 or JG244 alone, the combination treatment using T40214 and JG244 together significantly suppressed growth of human or murine prostate tumors. Also, compared with apoptotic cells induced by T40214 or JG244 alone, the combined treatment greatly increased apoptosis in DU145 (P < 0.006) and TRAMP-C2 tumors (P < 0.008).  Conclusions:   Our results suggested that combination treatment including a HIF-1α/2α inhibitor not only has therapeutic efficacy in targeting HIF-1α/2α, but also could reduce the hypoxia-induced drug resistance to other therapies (e.g., T40214) and enhance drug efficacy.

Methods:   One hundred twenty-one AAH foci from 101 patients who underwent transurethral prostatic resection or prostatectomy were immunohistochemically analyzed for AMACR, high molecular weight cytokeratin 34βE12, and p63 expression by a triple antibody (PIN4) cocktail stain.  Results:   Sixty-eight foci (56%) of AAH showed no AMACR immunostaining. Fourteen cases (12%) showed weak AMACR immunoreactivity in 1-9% of lesional cells. Sixteen cases (13%) showed strong immunopositivity for AMACR in >50% of lesional cells. AMACR expression in AAH was significantly higher in cases in which coexisting PCA was present, compared with its expression in AAH foci without coexisting PCA (P = 0.03). Strong diffuse AMACR positivity in over 50% of lesional cells was seen almost exclusively in AAH foci with coexisting PCA (P = 0.002). AMACR expression in AAH showed no correlation with patient age (P = 0.38), specimen type (P = 0.35), prostate weight (P = 0.80), zonal location (P = 0.50), distance to cancer (P = 0.28), Gleason score (P = 0.06), or pathologic stage (P = 0.23).

Methods:   Overall, 127,824 PCa patients treated with RP between 1988 and 2006 were included. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the impact of PLND status (pN0 vs. pNx vs. pN1) on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall mortality (OM) rates.  Results:   In pT2 patients, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year CSM rates were: 0.4%, 1.7%, and 3.9% for pN0, 0.6%, 2.5%, and 4.7% for pNx, 2.7%, 11.9%, and 20.6% for pN1 patients (all P < 0.001).

Thus, novel drugs that can downregulate CXCR4/CXCL12 axis have a great potential in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. In this report, we tested an agent, ursolic acid (UA) for its ability to modulate CXCR4 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and inhibit metastasis in vivo in transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. We observed that UA downregulated the expression of CXCR4 in prostate cancer cells irrespective of their HER2 status in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Neither proteasome inhibitor nor lysosomal stabilization had any effect on UA-induced decrease in CXCR4 expression. When investigated for the molecular mechanisms, it was observed that the downregulation of CXCR4 was due to transcriptional regulation as indicated by downregulation of mRNA expression, inhibition of NF-κB activation and modulation of chromatin immunoprecipitation activity. Suppression of CXCR4 expression by UA further correlated with the inhibition of CXCL12-induced migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells. Finally, we also found that UA treatment can inhibit metastasis of prostate cancer to distal organs, including lung and liver and suppress CXCR4 expression levels in the prostate tissues of TRAMP mice.

At 10 years after diagnosis, men with Charlson scores 0, 1, 2, and 3+ had nonprostate cancer mortality rates of 17%, 34%, 52%, and 74%, respectively. In competing risks regression analysis, each point increase in Charlson score was associated with a 2-fold increase in hazard of nonprostate mortality. Men with Charlson 3+ had 8.5× the hazard of death from other causes, compared with men with the lowest scores (subhazard ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 6.2-11.7). After stratification by tumor risk, nonprostate mortality rates remained markedly elevated among men with higher Charlson scores, whereas prostate cancer mortality was rare, especially among low-risk and intermediate-risk groups (0.4%, 3%, and 8% for low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively).  Conclusions:   Men with the highest Charlson scores should consider conservative management of low-risk and intermediate-risk tumors, given their exceedingly high risk of death from other causes and low risk of prostate cancer mortality.""","""['Timothy J Daskivich', 'Karim Chamie', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Jessica Labo', 'Atreya Dash', 'Sheldon Greenfield', 'Mark S Litwin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Tackling overtreatment of prostate cancer: the role of comorbidity.', 'Weighted versus unweighted Charlson score to predict long-term other-cause mortality in men with early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Effect of age, tumor risk, and comorbidity on competing risks for survival in a U.S. population-based cohort of men with prostate cancer.', 'Comparative effectiveness of aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment among men with early-stage prostate cancer and differing comorbid disease burdens at diagnosis.', 'Combined value of validated clinical and genomic risk stratification tools for predicting prostate cancer mortality in a high-risk prostatectomy cohort.', 'New Prostate Cancer Grading System Predicts Long-term Survival Following Surgery for Gleason Score 8-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'Effects of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Prostate Cancer Outcomes According to Competing Event Risk: Secondary Analysis of a Phase 3 Randomised Trial.', 'Body composition and mortality in men receiving prostate radiotherapy: A pooled analysis of NRG/RTOG 9406 and NRG/RTOG 0126.', 'No detrimental effect of a positive family history on postoperative upgrading and upstaging in men with low risk and favourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer: implications for active surveillance.', 'Prostate-specific antigen testing after the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation: a population-based analysis of electronic health data.', 'Both comorbidity and worse performance status are associated with poorer overall survival after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, we demonstrate the in vitro properties and in vivo efficacious activity of the CD40 agonist antibody, CP-870,893. CP-870,893 is a fully human, IgG2 antibody that selectively interacts with CD40 at a site distinct from its ligand-binding region with a KD of 0.4 nM. It enhances the expression of MHC class II, CD54, CD86, and CD23 on human B cells in vitro. CP-870,893 also enhances dendritic cell activity as evidenced by cytokine secretion (IL-12, IL-23, IL-8), the upregulation of CD86 and CD83, and the ability to prime T cells to secrete IFNγ. In SCID-beige mice, a single parenteral injection of CP-870,893 was therapeutically effective against several CD40(pos) human tumors (B-cell lymphoma, breast, colon, and prostate) indicating direct effects on tumor cell survival and/or growth. When mice were co-implanted with human T cells and dendritic cells, the activity of CP-870,893 against CD40(pos) tumors increased, and efficacy was also observed against CD40(neg) and CD40(low) tumors demonstrating the ability of CP-870,893 to enhance anti-tumor immune function in vivo.

Therefore, the aim of our study is to examine (a) whether there are changes over time in the quality of psychosocial care in long-term treatment of localized prostate cancer and (b) whether those changes are associated with the treatment decision.  Methods:   HAROW is a prospective, observational study designed to collect clinical data and patient reported outcomes (PROs) of different treatment options (hormonal therapy, active surveillance, radiation, operation, watchful waiting) for newly diagnosed patients with localized prostate cancer under real conditions. At 6-month intervals, general clinical data, PROs (e.g. quality of life, quality of physician-patient interaction) and individual costs are documented. We analysed data of N = 1,216 patients at the time of initial diagnosis (T1) and after 6 months (T2).  Results:   There is a significant decline in shared decision-making behaviour of physicians for the group of patients undergoing a prostatectomy and for the hormonal therapy group at the time of initial diagnosis and after 6 months. In terms of emotional support by physicians, there is a significant difference between the treatment groups at the time of initial diagnosis with patients undergoing a prostatectomy reporting significantly less support than the hormonal therapy group.  Conclusion:   Future research from both, the providers' and the patients' perspective, will have to clarify if we can interpret our results as change in the communication behaviour once the treatment decision for prostatectomy or hormonal therapy is made.""","""['Nicole Ernstmann', 'Oliver Ommen', 'Christoph Kowalski', 'Melanie Neumann', 'Adriaan Visser', 'Holger Pfaff', 'Lothar Weissbach']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Patient-physician communication and health-related quality of life of patients with localised prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy - a longitudinal multilevel analysis.', 'Health-related quality of life in active surveillance and radical prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer: a prospective observational study (HAROW - Hormonal therapy, Active Surveillance, Radiation, Operation, Watchful Waiting).', 'Elderly prostate cancer patients: patient information and shared decision making.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Locally advanced prostate cancer: effective treatments, but many adverse effects.', 'Is ""Active Surveillance"" an Acceptable Alternative?: A Qualitative Study of Couples\' Decision Making about Early-Stage, Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'The HAROW study: an example of outcomes research: a prospective, non-interventional study comparing treatment options in localized prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Using cohort data, we observed sick leave in the pre- and post-diagnostic phase among patients with colon, rectal, breast, prostate, or lung cancer (n = 2,738). We also identified reference subjects without cancer (total n = 12,246) who were individually matched for age and gender for each specific cancer cohort in order to compare sickness absence between patients with a specific form of cancer and the background population without cancer.  Results:   Lung cancer patients had the highest increase in sick days both pre- and post-diagnosis and prostate cancer patients had the lowest increase. Irrespective of the form of cancer, cancer patients had significantly more sick days in the post-diagnostic phase compared to their reference subjects, ranging from 5 (prostate cancer) to 12 times the amount of sick days (colon and lung cancer). One year post-diagnosis, less than half of the cancer patients were on sick leave, except for lung cancer patients where 63% were still on sick leave.  Conclusion:   Sick leave among cancer patients seems related not only to the cancer diagnosis and its treatment but also to the prodromal illness in the pre-diagnostic phase, especially for forms of cancer with heavier symptom burden such as colon and lung cancer.

This implies the potential of the cells to escape from the primary tumor as well as spreading ability. Herein, we investigated the effects of leuprorelin acetate (LA), a GnRH agonistic analogue, alone or in combination with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), on the expression of molecules involved in cell adhesion (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, α-, β- and γ-catenin) or in migration/invasion (c-met, CD44v6 and caveolin-1) in androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3) prostate cancer (CaP) cells. We demonstrated by immunoblotting that, in LNCaP cells, molecules present in the adherens junctions (E-cadherin, α-, β- and γ-catenin) were expressed, while α-catenin was absent in PC-3 cells which expressed N-cadherin and c-met. In LNCaP cells, no changes in E-cadherin levels were produced by 10(-9) M DHT while LA (10(-11) or 10(-6) M) up-regulated the protein level (up to 26-30% after 48 h). In the same cells, β- and γ-catenin expression was enhanced either by DHT (24 and 20%, respectively) or LA (up to 18 and 40%, respectively), while α-catenin was not affected. Antagonistic effects were consistently observed between DHT and LA when the two hormones were jointly administered to the cells. Consistent results were obtained by immunocytochemistry. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis, used to verify the integrity of the LNCaP cell adhesion complex, demonstrated the association of E-cadherin with catenins. In PC-3 cells, adhesion molecule expression, analyzed by immunoblotting, was unaffected by LA, while a down-regulation of c-met (up to 28%) was observed after 24 h of treatment but which did not hold up over time (48-144 h). Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of LA in upregulating E-cadherin, β- and γ-catenin in LNCaP cells. This effect, that may be considered as another aspect of the direct antitumor activity of the GnRH analogue in hormone-dependent CaP cells, may contribute to maintenance/restoration of the normal tissue architecture counteracting the tumor cell spreading tendency.""","""['Cristiana Angelucci', 'Gina Lama', 'Fortunata Iacopino', 'Gigliola Sica']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Apoptosis-related gene expression affected by a GnRH analogue without induction of programmed cell death in LNCaP cells.', 'Leuprorelin acetate affects ERK1/2 activity in prostate cancer cells.', 'Reduction of E-cadherin levels and deletion of the alpha-catenin gene in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Six-month leuprorelin acetate depot formulations in advanced prostate cancer: a clinical evaluation.', 'Connections between cadherin-catenin proteins, spindle misorientation, and cancer.', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors in Prostate Cancer: Molecular Aspects and Biological Functions.', 'Leuprorelin acetate long-lasting effects on GnRH receptors of prostate cancer cells: an atomic force microscopy study of agonist/receptor interaction.']"""

Because of the importance of normal cells in shaping the tissue microenvironment we formulate the hypothesis that molecular components of the profile of normal epithelial cells adjacent the tumour are predictive of tumour physiology. We addressed this hypothesis by developing statistical models that link gene expression profiles representing the molecular state of adjacent normal epithelial cells to tumour features in prostate cancer.

Previously it was shown that PTK6 is localized to epithelial cell nuclei in normal prostate, but becomes cytoplasmic in human prostate tumors. PTK6 is also primarily cytoplasmic in the PC3 prostate adenocarcinoma cell line. Sequencing revealed expression of wild type full-length PTK6 transcripts in addition to an alternative transcript lacking exon 2 in PC3 cells. The alternative transcript encodes a 134 amino acid protein, referred to here as ALT-PTK6, which shares the first 77 amino acid residues including the SH3 domain with full length PTK6. RT-PCR was used to show that ALT-PTK6 is coexpressed with full length PTK6 in established human prostate and colon cell lines, as well as in primary cell lines derived from human prostate tissue and tumors. Although interaction between full-length PTK6 and ALT-PTK6 was not detected, ALT-PTK6 associates with the known PTK6 substrates Sam68 and β-catenin in GST pull-down assays. Coexpression of PTK6 and ALT-PTK6 led to suppression of PTK6 activity and reduced association of PTK6 with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. While ALT-PTK6 alone did not influence β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity in a luciferase reporter assay, it enhanced PTK6-mediated inhibition of β-catenin/TCF transcription by promoting PTK6 nuclear functions. Ectopic expression of ALT-PTK6 led to reduced expression of the β-catenin/TCF targets Cyclin D1 and c-Myc in PC3 cells. Expression of tetracycline-inducible ALT-PTK6 blocked the proliferation and colony formation of PC3 cells. Our findings suggest that ALT-PTK6 is able to negatively regulate growth and modulate PTK6 activity, protein-protein associations and/or subcellular localization. Fully understanding functions of ALT-PTK6 and its impact on PTK6 signaling will be critical for development of therapeutic strategies that target PTK6 in cancer.""","""['Patrick M Brauer', 'Yu Zheng', 'Mark D Evans', 'Carmen Dominguez-Brauer', 'Donna M Peehl', 'Angela L Tyner']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cytoplasmic retention of protein tyrosine kinase 6 promotes growth of prostate tumor cells.', 'Identification of beta-catenin as a target of the intracellular tyrosine kinase PTK6.', 'Identification of PTK6, via RNA sequencing analysis, as a suppressor of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Context-specific protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) signalling in prostate cancer.', 'Building a better understanding of the intracellular tyrosine kinase PTK6 - BRK by BRK.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Protein Tyrosine Kinase 6 in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Epigenetic Deregulation of Protein Tyrosine Kinase 6 Promotes Carcinogenesis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Breast Tumour Kinase (Brk/PTK6) Contributes to Breast Tumour Xenograft Growth and Modulates Chemotherapeutic Responses In Vitro.', 'Targeting protein tyrosine kinase 6 in cancer.', 'Protein tyrosine kinase 6 signaling in prostate cancer.']"""

However, the first valid reports from randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of screening were not published until 2009. Men in the screening group in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer were 20% less likely than those in the control group to die from prostate cancer. The absolute difference was only 0.7/1000, implying that over 1400 men needed to be screened to prevent one prostate cancer death. Screening was also associated with a 70% increased risk for being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The American Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial found no survival benefit for screening. Results were not conclusive because a substantial proportion of study subjects had previously undergone PSA testing, over half of the control group had PSA testing, follow-up was relatively short, and fewer than 100 subjects died from prostate cancer. Balancing the potential survival benefit from screening is the risk of overdiagnosis-finding cancers that would not otherwise cause clinical problems-and the risk of treatment complications, including urinary, sexual and bowel dysfunction. Prostate cancer screening efforts would benefit from improved biomarkers, which more readily identify clinically important cancers. Cancer control efforts might also need to include chemoprevention, though currently available agents are controversial.

We hypothesized that Snail will lead to decreased cellular adhesion to fibronectin and collagen I matrix through integrin regulation, concomitant with increased cell migration. Androgen-independent C4-2 cells, an aggressive subline of androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, exhibited decreased cell adhesion and increased cell migration on fibronectin and collagen I as compared to LNCaP cells, which was reversed by Snail knock down in C4-2 cells. ARCaP and LNCaP prostate cancer cells stably transfected with Snail displayed decreased adhesion and increased cell migration on fibronectin and collagen I as compared to control Neo-transfected cells, which was reversed by Snail knockdown. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a decrease in a5, a2 and b1 integrin expression in ARCaP Snail-transfected cells that was reversed in Snail knock down cells. We also observed an increase in ERK phosphorylation in ARCaP Snail-transfected cells as compared to control ARCaP-Neo cells, and inhibition of the MAPK pathway with UO126 inhibitor in ARCaP Snail-transfected cells abrogated Snail-mediated decrease in cell adhesion and reinduced a5, a2 and b1 integrin expression.

The Comrad framework leverages the advantages of both RNA-Seq and WGSS data, providing accurate classification of rearrangements as expressed or not expressed and accurate classification of the genomic or non-genomic origin of aberrant transcripts. A major benefit of Comrad is its ability to accurately identify aberrant transcripts and associated rearrangements using low coverage genome data. As a result, a Comrad analysis can be performed at a cost comparable to that of two RNA-Seq experiments, significantly lower than an analysis requiring high coverage genome data.  Results:   We have applied Comrad to the discovery of gene fusions and read-throughs in prostate cancer cell line C4-2, a derivative of the LNCaP cell line with androgen-independent characteristics. As a proof of concept, we have rediscovered in the C4-2 data 4 of the 6 fusions previously identified in LNCaP. We also identified six novel fusion transcripts and associated genomic breakpoints, and verified their existence in LNCaP, suggesting that Comrad may be more sensitive than previous methods that have been applied to fusion discovery in LNCaP.

The present report aimed to perform a comparative, lectin-histochemical study of benign and carcinomatous prostates, using a battery of lectins, in combination with monoclonal antibodies against Lewis antigens, and a semi quantitative study, to investigate the changes in glycosylation patterns that occur in prostatic carcinoma. Blocks from 27 necropsy cases of prostatic carcinoma were sectioned and stained with H+E, fifteen biotinylated lectins chosen to probe for a wide range of oligosaccharide sequences within several categories of glycoprotein glycans, using a lectin-biotin avidin-peroxidase method, and monoclonal antibodies against Lewisa, sialyl Lewisa and sialyl Lewisx antigens. The glycophenotype of prostatic carcinoma differed from that of the noncancerous prostate in revealing more intense staining with the following lectins (AAA, UEA-1, DBA, WFA, VVA, HPA, BSA-1B4, MPA, ECA, AHA, and CTA), while the binding patterns of (GNA and NPA) were almost similar in both prostatic carcinoma and the noncancerous prostate. Lewis antigens are found to be expressed in prostatic carcinomas but not in the noncancerous prostate. The observations of this study suggest that the gylcophenotype of transformed prostatic cells was modified. It showed a moderate increase in, and changing patterns of, fucosylation and galactosylation, increased branching of side chains and sharp rise in 2 deoxy, 2 acetamido galactosylation and masking process by sialylation, especially by α2-3 and α2-6 linkages. All these changes in the glycosylation pattern of the transformed prostatic cells were observed on O-glycans, no changes were observed on N-glycans.""","""['M N Khabaz', 'J McClure', 'S McClure', 'R W Stoddart']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Folia Histochem Cytobiol""","""['A lectin histochemistry comparative study in human normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and prostatic carcinoma.', 'Altered saccharide sequences in two groups of patients with metastatic prostatic carcinoma.', 'Carbohydrate expression profile of colorectal cancer cells is relevant to metastatic pattern and prognosis.', 'Histochemical studies of epithelial cell glycoconjugates in atrophic, metaplastic, hyperplastic, and neoplastic canine prostate.', 'Glycosylation products in prostate diseases.', 'Impact of Fucosylation on Self-Assembly of Prostate and Breast Tumor Spheroids by Using Cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) Peptide and Image Object Detection.', 'Glycans as Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Wisteria floribunda Agglutinin and Its Reactive-Glycan-Carrying Prostate-Specific Antigen as a Novel Diagnostic and Prognostic Marker of Prostate Cancer.', 'The androgen receptor controls expression of the cancer-associated sTn antigen and cell adhesion through induction of ST6GalNAc1 in prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of glycophenotype in prostatic neoplasm by chemiluminescent assay.']"""

Materials and methods:   The UCSF Urologic Oncology Database was used to identify subjects diagnosed with high grade prostate cancer (primary pattern 4 or 5) in at least one core on extended-pattern biopsy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent factors associated with downgrading at radical prostatectomy, defined as a change from primary pattern 4 or 5 to primary pattern 3.  Results:   Downgrading occurred in 68 (34%) of 202 subjects who met the study criteria. Fourteen (47%) of 30 subjects with ≤25% of cores that were high grade and 9 (43%) of 21 subjects with <10% of total tissue containing cancer were downgraded. In a multivariable model, patients with mixed grade cores had much higher odds of downgrading than those with all high grade cores (OR 3.0 95% 1.3-7.1), P < 0.01). The proportion (per 10% increment) of positive cores containing high grade cancer (OR 0.8 95% CI 0.7-0.9 P < 0.01) and the percent (per 10% increment) of total tissue containing cancer (OR 0.7 95% CI 0.6-0.9 P = 0.01) were significantly associated with lower odds of downgrading.  Conclusions:   Downgrading following radical prostatectomy is a common event. Biopsy over-grading may preclude men from active surveillance or lead to unnecessary lymphadenectomy, excess radiation, or prolonged hormone therapy. The proportion of positive biopsy cores that are high grade and the percent of total tissue containing cancer should be incorporated into decision making.""","""['Jared M Whitson', 'Sima P Porten', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Jeff P Simko', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Percent of prostate needle biopsy cores with cancer is significant independent predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence following radical prostatectomy: results from SEARCH database.', 'Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate biopsy clinical and pathological variables that predict significant grading changes in patients with intermediate and high grade prostate cancer.', 'Extended prostate biopsy scheme improves reliability of Gleason grading: implications for radiotherapy patients.', 'The independent impact of extended pattern biopsy on prostate cancer stage migration.', 'External Tertiary-Care-Hospital Validation of the Epidemiological SEER-Based Nomogram Predicting Downgrading in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The impact of surgical downgrading on prostate cancer recurrence: systematic review and analysis of a multiethnic population.', 'Prognostic histopathological and molecular markers on prostate cancer needle-biopsies: a review.', 'Multiparametric 3T MRI for the prediction of pathological downgrading after radical prostatectomy in patients with biopsy-proven Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20094 prostate cancer.', 'Clinical role of pathological downgrading after radical prostatectomy in patients with biopsy confirmed Gleason score 3 + 4 prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   From September 2002 to November 2005, 71 patients were enrolled. Planning pelvic CT and (111)In-capromab pendetide scan images were coregistered. The entire prostate gland received 75.6 Gy/42 fractions, whereas areas of increased uptake in (111)In-capromab pendetide scan received 82 Gy. For patients with T3/T4 disease, or Gleason score ≥8, or prostate-specific antigen level >20 ng/mL, 12 months of adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was given. In January 2005 the protocol was modified to give 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy to patients with a prostate-specific antigen level of 10-20 ng/mL or Gleason 7 disease.  Results:   Thirty-one patients had low-risk, 30 had intermediate-risk, and 10 had high-risk disease.

Methods and materials:   We propose a method to estimate patient CBCT images using prior information and a deformation model. Patients' previous CBCT data are used as the prior information, and the new CBCT volume to be estimated is considered as a deformation of the prior image volume. The deformation field map is solved by minimizing deformation energy and maintaining new projection data fidelity using a nonlinear conjugate gradient method. This method was implemented in 3D form using hardware acceleration and multi-resolution scheme, and it was evaluated for different scan angles, projection numbers, and scan directions using liver, lung, and prostate cancer patient data. The accuracy of the estimation was evaluated by comparing the organ volume difference and the similarity between estimated CBCT and the CBCT reconstructed from fully sampled projections.  Results:   Results showed that scan direction and number of projections do not have significant effects on the CBCT estimation accuracy. The total scan angle is the dominant factor affecting the accuracy of the CBCT estimation algorithm. Larger scan angles yield better estimation accuracy than smaller scan angles. Lung cancer patient data showed that the estimation error of the 3D lung tumor volume was reduced from 13.3% to 4.3% when the scan angle was increased from 60° to 360° using 57 projections.  Conclusions:   The proposed estimation method is applicable for 3D DTS, 3D CBCT, four-dimensional CBCT, and four-dimensional DTS image estimation.

To benefit from this, there are two options available: transferring the MRI delineated target volume to the planning CT or performing the treatment planning directly on the MRI study. A precondition for excluding the CT study is the possibility to define internal structures visible on both the planning MRI and on the images used to position the patient at treatment. In prostate cancer radiotherapy, internal gold markers are commonly used, and they are visible on CT, MRI, x-ray, and portal images. The depiction of the markers in MRI are, however, dependent on their shape and orientation relative the main magnetic field because of susceptibility effects. In the present work, these effects are investigated and quantified using both simulations and phantom measurements.  Methods and materials:   Software that simulated the magnetic field distortions around user defined geometries of variable susceptibilities was constructed. These magnetic field perturbation maps were then reconstructed to images that were evaluated. The simulation software was validated through phantom measurements of four commercially available gold markers of different shapes and one in-house gold marker.  Results:   Both simulations and phantom measurements revealed small position deviations of the imaged marker positions relative the actual marker positions (<1 mm).

Methods and materials:   One hundred twenty-one patients underwent hypo-IMRT at 3 Gy/fraction, 5 days/week to either 60 Gy or 66 Gy, with daily online image guidance. Acute and late GI and genitourinary (GU) toxicity were recorded weekly during treatment and at each follow-up. All Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria toxicity scores were dichotomized as <2 and ≥2. Standard dosimetric parameters and the first five to six principal components (PCs) of bladder and rectal wall DVHs were tested for association with the dichotomized toxicity outcomes, using logistic regression.  Results:   Median follow-up of all patients was 47 months (60 Gy cohort = 52 months; 66 Gy cohort = 31 months). The incidence rates of ≥2 acute GI and GU toxicity were 14% and 29%, respectively, with no Grade ≥3 acute GU toxicity. Late GI and GU toxicity scores ≥2 were 16% and 15%, respectively. There was a significant difference in late GI toxicity ≥2 when comparing the 66 Gy to the 60 Gy cohort (38% vs. 8%, respectively, p = 0.0003). The first PC of the rectal DVH was associated with late GI toxicity (odds ratio [OR], 6.91; p < 0.001), though it was not significantly stronger than standard DVH parameters such as Dmax (OR, 6.9; p < 0.001) or percentage of the organ receiving a 50% dose (V50) (OR, 5.95; p = 0 .001).  Conclusions:   Hypofractionated treatment with 60 Gy in 3 Gy fractions is well tolerated. There is a steep dose response curve between 60 Gy and 66 Gy for RTOG Grade ≥2 GI effects with the dose constraints employed.

Prebrachytherapy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and serum testosterone were obtained for each patient. Repeat levels were obtained 3 months after brachytherapy and at least every 6 months thereafter. Multiple clinical, treatment, and dosimetric parameters were evaluated to determine an association with temporal testosterone changes. In addition, analysis was conducted to determine if there was an association between testosterone changes and treatment outcomes or the occurrence of a PSA spike.  Results:   There was no significant difference in serum testosterone over time after implant (p = 0.57). 29% of men experienced an increase ≥ 25%, 23% of men experienced a decrease ≥ 25%, and the remaining 48% of men had no notable change in testosterone over time. There was no difference in testosterone trends between men who received external beam radiotherapy and those who did not (p = 0.12). On multivariate analysis, preimplant testosterone was the only variable that consistently predicted for changes in testosterone over time. Men with higher than average testosterone tended to experience drop in testosterone (p < 0.001), whereas men with average or below average baseline testosterone had no significant change. There was no association between men who experienced PSA spike and testosterone temporal trends (p = 0.50) nor between initial PSA response and testosterone trends (p = 0.21).

The point ratio of α/β was 1.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.7-5.1 Gy). The 95% confidence interval was determined entirely by the binomial confidence limits in the numbers of patients. Rectal reactions of grade 3 and 4 occurred in 1 of 114 (hypofractionated) and 2 of 160 (standard) patients.  Conclusions:   The presented three-dimensional conformal regimen was acceptable, and the α/β value was 1.8, in agreement with other very recent low meta-analyses (reviewed in the ""Discussion"" section).""","""['Felix Leborgne', 'Jack Fowler', 'José H Leborgne', 'Julieta Mezzera']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Late outcomes following hypofractionated conformal radiotherapy vs. standard fractionation for localized prostate cancer: a nonrandomized contemporary comparison.', 'Hypofractionated radiotherapy for favorable risk prostate cancer.', 'Hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (70 gy at 2.5 Gy per fraction) for localized prostate cancer: long-term outcomes.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Challenging Accelerated Hypofractionated Radiotherapy.', 'Prostate Cancer Treatment-Related Toxicity: Comparison between 3D-Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) Techniques.', 'Androgen Flare after LHRH Initiation Is the Side Effect That Makes Most of the Beneficial Effect When It Coincides with Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Heuristic estimation of the α/β ratio for a cohort of Mexican patients with prostate cancer treated with external radiotherapy techniques.', 'Prostate hypofractionated radiotherapy (62Gy at 3.1Gy per fraction) with injection of hyaluronic acid: final results of the RPAH1 study.', 'Biological dose summation of intensity-modulated arc therapy and image-guided high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 267 men were identified from a cohort of patients treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) between January 1998 and June 2004. Patients were included if they presented with clinical stage ≥T2b and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥15 ng/mL, and/or Gleason score ≥8. Information on biochemical recurrence, distant metastasis, cancer-specific survival, and use of ADT was obtained from a prospectively maintained database.  Results:   The median follow-up was 6.7 years (range, 1-146 months). Biochemical recurrence (BCR), distant metastasis (DM), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) were observed in 112 (42%), 28 (10%), and 15 (6%) patients, respectively. Salvage treatment was performed in 95 (85%) of 112 patients with BCR. Only 71 (27%) of 267 men were subjected to ADT. Overall, 8-year probabilities of freedom from BCR, DM, PCSM, and ADT were 46% (95% CI, 38-54), 87% (95% CI, 84-90), 93% (95% CI, 91-95), and 71% (95% CI, 65-77), respectively.

Methods:   A total of 533 men from Brooklyn, New York, aged 45-70 years, were classified into 4 race/ethnic groups: U.S.-born whites, U.S.-born African-American, Jamaican, and Trinidadian/Tobagonian. The participants recorded the number of DREs in the past 10 years. The demographics and structural variables and prostate cancer worry and screening fear were measured using validated tools.  Results:   Overall, 30% of subjects reported never having a DRE, and 24% reported annual DREs. African-American, Jamaican, and Trinidadian/Tobagonian men had greater prostate cancer worry and screening fear scores than did the white men (all P < .05). African-American, Jamaican, and Trinidadian/Tobagonian men were less likely to maintain annual DREs than white men (odds ratio 0.17, 0.26, and 0.16, respectively, all P < .05). The men with low screening fear were more likely to have had an initial DRE (OR 2.3, P < .05 vs high screening fear) but were no more or less likely to undergo annual DREs. Having a regular physician, comprehensive physician discussion, and annual visits were also associated with undergoing DREs.  Conclusions:   We identified several ethnically varying barriers and facilitators to DRE screening. African-American and African-Caribbean men undergo DRE less often and have greater prostate cancer worry and screening fear scores than did white men. Screening fear predicts the likelihood of undergoing an initial, but not annual, DRE screening. Access to a physician and annual visits facilitate DRE screening.

Many epidemiological studies use the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to evaluate dietary intakes but few studies validate the instrument against biological markers. The aim of this study was to assess the validity and reproducibility of a previously validated 70-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was expanded to 120-items to assess diet-cancer relations.  Methods:   Relative validity of the FFQ was assessed against twelve 24-hour recalls administered over 12 months in 70 subjects. The FFQ was repeated after one year (FFQ2) to assess reproducibility. The validity of the FFQ was evaluated by comparing nutrient and food group intakes from 24-hour recalls with the first and second FFQ. In addition, FFQ validity for cholesterol and folate were determined through correlation with biomarkers (serum cholesterol, serum folate and whole blood folate) in 159 control subjects participating in a case-control prostate cancer study.  Results:   Compared to recalls the FFQ tended to overestimate energy and carbohydrate intakes but gave no differences in intake for protein and fat. Quartile agreement for energy-adjusted nutrient intakes between FFQ2 and recalls ranged from 31.8%-77.3% for the lowest quartile and 20.8%-81.0% in the highest quartile. Gross misclassification of nutrients was low with the exceptions of protein, vitamin E and retinol and weighted kappa values ranged from 0.33 to 0.64 for other nutrients. Validity correlations for energy-adjusted nutrients (excluding retinol) were moderate to high (0.38-0.86). Correlation coefficients between multiple recalls and FFQ1 ranged from 0.27 (fruits) to 0.55 (red meat); the second FFQ gave somewhat higher coefficients (0.30 to 0.61). Reproducibility correlations for the nutrients ranged from 0.50 to 0.84.Calibration of the FFQ with biochemical markers showed modest correlations with serum cholesterol (0.24), serum folate (0.25) and whole blood folate (0.33) adjusted for age, energy, body mass index and smoking.  Conclusions:   The expanded FFQ had good relative validity for estimating food group and nutrient intakes (except retinol and vitamin E) and was a reliable measure of habitual intake.

This gene is critical to the maintenance of overall genome stability, and is also thought to play a key role in human carcinogenesis. In this case-control study, several novel polymorphic variants of XRCC4, including C-1622T (rs7727691), G-1394T (rs6869366), C-571T (rs2075686) and intron3 DIP (rs28360071), were investigated, and the correlation of these variants to prostate cancer susceptibility in a Taiwanese population was observed. A total of 134 prostate cancer patients were recruited along with 134 age-matched healthy controls, and the association of their selected genotypes with susceptibility to prostate cancer was determined. The G-1394T variant of XRCC4 proved, after analysis of the frequencies of each variant in the prostate cancer and control groups, to be a significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in prostate carcinogenesis. Our data clearly indicate that the heterogeneous G of G-1394T increases the risk of suceptibility to prostate cancer (P=0.0106), while no difference in distribution of XRCC4 C-1622T (rs7727691), C-571T (rs2075686) or intron3 DIP (rs28360071) between the prostate cancer and control groups was found.

In the HEPAC2 human hepatocyte culture system, concentrations of CHP below 3.2 mg/ml had no significant effects on the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin, and urea. In rats, continuous administration of three different doses of CHP were tested for 28 days and resulted in signs of liver damage, as indicated by elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) at a dose of 903 mg/kg, corresponding to a plasma concentration of approximately 200 µg/ml. Data from a clinical study of CHP in bladder and prostate cancer patients showed no adverse effects of administration of 8 g CHP/day, 4 days/week for 3 weeks in liver parameters ALAT, ASAT, γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). In conclusion, the HEPAC2 human hepatocyte culture system correlates well with clinical results of a Phase II study of CHP, whereas a previous rat hepatocyte culture system predicted the compound would have toxic effects. The HEPAC2 system therefore constitutes a valuable tool for the preclinical screening of the hepatotoxicity of chemotherapeutic and other drugs, thereby reducing the need for experimental animals.""","""['Heather Dickens', 'Anett Ullrich', 'Dieter Runge', 'Berno Mueller', 'Ulrike Olszewski', 'Gerhard Hamilton']""","""[]""","""2008""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""[""NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of 4,4'-Thiobis(6- t -butyl- m -cresol) (CAS No. 96-69-5) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Feed Studies)."", ""Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of a binary mixture of 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) (Cas No. 57465-28-8) and 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 118) (Cas No. 31508-00-6) in female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (gavage studies)."", 'NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Coumarin (CAS No. 91-64-5) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies).', 'NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of C.I.

In the present study the changing processes of digital pathology in Japan were investigated and trends to future were discussed.  Methods:   The changing status of digital pathology was investigated through reviewing the records of annual meetings of the Japanese Research Society of Telepathology and Pathology Informatics (JRST-PI) and of the Japanese pathology related medical and informatics journals. The results of the Japanese questionnaire survey conducted in 2008-2009 on telepathology and virtual slide were also reviewed. In addition effectiveness of an experimental automatic pathology diagnostic aid system using computer artificial intelligence was investigated by checking its rate of correct diagnosis for given prostate carcinoma digital images.  Results:   Telepathology played a central role in the development of digital pathology in Japan. Both macroscopic and microscopic pathology digital images were routinely generated and used for diagnostic purposes in major hospitals. Virtual slide (VS) digital images were used first for education then for conference, consultation and also gradually for routine diagnosis and telepathology. The experimental automatic diagnostic aid system achieved the rate of correct diagnosis around 95% for prostate carcinoma and its use for automatic mapping of cancerous areas in a given tissue image was successful.  Conclusions:   Advance in the digital information technologies gave revolutionary impacts on pathology education, conference, consultation, diagnosis, telepathology and also on pathology diagnostic procedures in Japan.

Although a mechanism for XMRV carcinogenesis is yet to be established, this virus belongs to the family of gammaretroviruses well known for their ability to induce cancer in the infected hosts. Since its original identification XMRV has been detected in several independent investigations; however, at this time significant controversy remains regarding reports of XMRV detection/prevalence in other cohorts and cell type/tissue distribution. The potential risk of human infection, coupled with the lack of knowledge about the basic biology of XMRV, warrants further research, including investigation of adaptive immune responses. To study immunogenicity in vivo, we vaccinated mice with a combination of recombinant vectors expressing codon-optimized sequences of XMRV gag and env genes and virus-like particles (VLP) that had the size and morphology of live infectious XMRV.  Results:   Immunization elicited Env-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against XMRV in mice. The peak titers for ELISA-binding antibodies and NAb were 1:1024 and 1:464, respectively; however, high ELISA-binding and NAb titers were not sustained and persisted for less than three weeks after immunizations.  Conclusions:   Vaccine-induced XMRV Env antibody titers were transiently high, but their duration was short. The relatively rapid diminution in antibody levels may in part explain the differing prevalences reported for XMRV in various prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome cohorts. The low level of immunogenicity observed in the present study may be characteristic of a natural XMRV infection in humans.""","""['Natalia Makarova', 'Chunxia Zhao', 'Yuanyuan Zhang', 'Sushma Bhosle', 'Suganthi Suppiah', 'Jeanne M Rhea', 'Natalia Kozyr', 'Rebecca S Arnold', 'Hinh Ly', 'Ross J Molinaro', 'Tristram G Parslow', 'Eric Hunter', 'Dennis Liotta', 'John Petros', 'Jerry L Blackwell']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Development and application of a high-throughput microneutralization assay: lack of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus and/or murine leukemia virus detection in blood donors.', 'No association of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus with prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome in Japan.', 'Characterization of retroviral and lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus envelope glycoprotein.', 'Distribution of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) infection in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'Lack of evidence for a role of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and/or chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Infection of female primary lower genital tract epithelial cells after natural pseudotyping of HIV-1: possible implications for sexual transmission of HIV-1.', 'No detection of the retrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in individuals with hemophilia.', 'No evidence for xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus infection in Sweden using internally controlled multiepitope suspension array serology.', 'Identification of XMRV infection-associated microRNAs in four cell types in culture.']"""

Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of total mortality (n = 595) and lethal prostate cancer (death from prostate cancer or development of bone metastases; n = 202). In models adjusted for age at diagnosis, BMI, physical activity, and smoking, we observed a HR of 1.22 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.54) for total mortality, comparing men in the lowest to the highest quartile of 25(OH)D. There was no association between 1,25(OH)(2)D and total mortality. Men with the lowest 25(OH)D quartile were more likely to die of their cancer (HR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.39) compared to those in the highest quartile (P(trend) = 0.006). This association was largely explained by the association between low 25(OH)D levels and advanced cancer stage and higher Gleason score, suggesting that these variables may mediate the influence of 25(OH)D on prognosis. The association also tended to be stronger among patients with samples collected within five years of cancer diagnosis. 1,25(OH)(2)D levels were not associated with lethal prostate cancer.

Especially challenging is selecting an optimal subset of features from high-dimensional data, which typically have many more variables than observations and contain significant noise, missing components, or outliers. Existing methods either cannot handle high-dimensional data efficiently or scalably, or can only obtain local optimum instead of global optimum. Toward the selection of the globally optimal subset of features efficiently, we introduce a new selector--which we call the Fisher-Markov selector--to identify those features that are the most useful in describing essential differences among the possible groups. In particular, in this paper we present a way to represent essential discriminating characteristics together with the sparsity as an optimization objective. With properly identified measures for the sparseness and discriminativeness in possibly high-dimensional settings, we take a systematic approach for optimizing the measures to choose the best feature subset. We use Markov random field optimization techniques to solve the formulated objective functions for simultaneous feature selection. Our results are noncombinatorial, and they can achieve the exact global optimum of the objective function for some special kernels. The method is fast; in particular, it can be linear in the number of features and quadratic in the number of observations. We apply our procedure to a variety of real-world data, including mid--dimensional optical handwritten digit data set and high-dimensional microarray gene expression data sets. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by experimental results. In pattern recognition and from a model selection viewpoint, our procedure says that it is possible to select the most discriminating subset of variables by solving a very simple unconstrained objective function which in fact can be obtained with an explicit expression.""","""['Qiang Cheng', 'Hongbo Zhou', 'Jie Cheng']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell""","""['Iterative RELIEF for feature weighting: algorithms, theories, and applications.', 'A novel feature selection approach for biomedical data classification.', 'Combining multivariate voxel selection and support vector machines for mapping and classification of fMRI spatial patterns.', 'Minimizing nonsubmodular functions with graph cuts - a review.', 'Pattern recognition in bioinformatics.', 'Electromyogram in Cigarette Smoking Activity Recognition.', 'Algorithmic Stability and Generalization of an Unsupervised Feature Selection Algorithm.', 'Fractal Autoencoders for Feature Selection.', 'In silico prediction of HIV-1-host molecular interactions and their directionality.', 'iBLP: An XGBoost-Based Predictor for Identifying Bioluminescent Proteins.']"""

Experimental design:   Forty-three patients with biopsy-proven PCa were included. They underwent radical prostatectomy within 31 days after [(11)C]choline PET/CT. The transaxial image slices and the histologic specimens were analyzed by comparing the respective slices. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUV(max)) were calculated in each segment and correlated with histopathology. The tumor configuration in the histologic specimen was grouped as: I, unifocal; II, multifocal; III, rind-like shaped; IV, size <5 mm. Data analysis included the investigation of detection of PCa by SUV(max), the assessment of the influence of potential contributing factors on tumor prediction, and the evaluation of whether SUV could discriminate cancer tissue from benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, HGPIN (high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasm), or normal prostate tissue. General estimation equation models were used for statistical analysis.  Results:   Tumor configuration in histology was classified as I in 21 patients, as II in 9, as III in 5, and as IV in 8. The prostate segment involved by cancer is identified in 79% of the patients. SUV(max) was located in the same side of the prostate in 95% of patients.

Therefore, we analyzed the clinical outcomes in patients treated with dose-escalated radiation therapy (RT) based on the presence or absence of GP5.  Methods and materials:   Outcomes were analyzed for 718 men treated for localized prostate cancer with external-beam RT to a minimum planning target volume dose of at least 75 Gy. We assessed the impact of GP5 and that of pretreatment- and treatment-related factors on freedom from biochemical failure, freedom from metastasis (FFM), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS).  Results:   At biopsy, 89% of patients had no GP5, and 11% (76/718) had GP5. There were no differences in age, comorbid illness, T stage, prostate-specific antigen, or the use or duration of androgen deprivation therapy between GS8 without GP5 and GS8-10 with GP5. The presence of GP5 predicted lower FFM (p < 0.002; hazard ratio [HR] 3.4 [1.7-7.1]); CSS (p < 0.0001; HR 12.9 [5.4-31]); and OS (p < 0.0001; HR 3.6 [2.0-6.5]) in comparison with GS8 (without GP5). The 8-year FFM, CSS, and OS were 89%, 98%, and 57%, respectively, for those with Gleason 8 prostate cancer without GP5 in comparison with 61%, 55%, and 31%, respectively, for those with GP5. In addition, both FFM and CSS were strongly influenced by androgen deprivation therapy given concurrently with RT. On multivariate analysis, GP5 was the strongest prognostic factor for all clinical endpoints, including OS.  Conclusion:   The presence of GP5 predicts for worse clinical behavior, which therefore needs to be accounted for by risk stratification schemes. Further intensification of local and/or systemic therapy may be appropriate for such patients.""","""['Aaron Sabolch', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Stephanie Daignault-Newton', 'Schuyler Halverson', 'Kevin Blas', 'Laura Phelps', 'Karin B Olson', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Daniel A Hamstra']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['The percent of positive biopsy cores improves prediction of prostate cancer-specific death in patients treated with dose-escalated radiotherapy.', 'Perineural invasion predicts increased recurrence, metastasis, and death from prostate cancer following treatment with dose-escalated radiation therapy.', 'Percentage of cancer volume in biopsy cores is prognostic for prostate cancer death and overall survival in patients treated with dose-escalated external beam radiotherapy.', 'Older age predicts decreased metastasis and prostate cancer-specific death for men treated with radiation therapy: meta-analysis of radiation therapy oncology group trials.', 'Gleason grade 5 prostate cancer: sub-patterns and prognosis.', 'The prognostic significance of the clinical T stage and Grade Group in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated via high-dose-rate brachytherapy and external beam radiation.', 'Outcomes following radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation for veterans with Gleason 9 and 10 prostate cancer.', 'Conventional dose versus dose escalated radiotherapy including high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost for patients with Gleason score 9-10 clinical localized prostate cancer.', 'Novel Prognostic Index of High-Risk Prostate Cancer Using Simple Summation of Very High-Risk Factors.', 'Local control matters.']"""

Methods:   The patients included 5 consecutive men who underwent brachytherapy as a salvage procedure after radical prostatectomy from December 2006 to March 2008. We used a technique of implanting the local recurrences similar to the American Brachytherapy Society Guidelines for implanting an intact prostate as definitive therapy. Two modifications were made related to the recurrence location: a rare need to manage urethral doses because the recurrence was typically perirectal, and more aggressive management of the dose to the rectum because of this proximity.  Results:   All patients tolerated the brachytherapy procedure well and showed a decline in the prostate-specific antigen level, with a median nadir of 0.72 ng/mL at a median follow-up of 13 months.

With contemporary widespread prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, more patients are being diagnosed with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, reducing the need and yield of bone scan imaging.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 1598 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1998 to 2004 at the Greater Los Angeles and Long Beach VA Medical Centers. We used univariate and multivariate analyses to measure the association between patient (age, race, and comorbidities) and tumor (PSA, clinical stage, Gleason grade) characteristics with bone scan use and subsequent positivity. We conducted the analysis for scans for the entire cohort and those with low and high risk of metastatic disease.  Results:   Of 519 men with low-risk disease, 132 (25%) underwent bone scan imaging, none with positive findings. On multivariate analysis for the entire cohort, younger age, Long Beach VA site, increasing PSA level (≥10 ng/mL), clinical stage (cT2 or greater), and Gleason score (≥7) were all positively associated with bone scan use; however, only PSA level ≥20 ng/mL, clinical stage cT3 or greater, and Gleason score ≥4 + 3 corresponded with positivity. A bone scan positivity rate of ≥10% was limited to men with clinical stage cT3 or greater, Gleason score of ≥8, or PSA level of ≥20 ng/mL.  Conclusions:   Although decreasing in incidence with time, our results demonstrate extensive overuse of bone scan imaging among VA patients with low-risk prostate cancer. These patterns of overuse for men with low-risk cancer, yielding no positive findings, result in unnecessary patient anxiety and significant economic waste for the VA Healthcare System.""","""['Roland Palvolgyi', 'Timothy J Daskivich', 'Karim Chamie', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Mark S Litwin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Establishing the pathways and indications for performing isotope bone scans in newly diagnosed intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer - results from a large contemporaneous cohort.', 'Do all patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer need staging radionuclide bone scan?

The estimated elasticities from 21 regions were separated into normal and cancer tissues using the pathological information, and a tissue elasticity map was developed using numerical functions and a nonlinear surface-fitting method.  Results:   The mean elastic moduli of the normal and cancer tissues were 15.25 ± 5.88 and 28.80 ± 11.20 kPa, respectively. The base region had the highest elasticity, followed by the medial and apex regions. These results demonstrated the ability to separate the cancer tissue from the normal tissue based on its elastic modulus.

The method for the quantification of sarcosine in urine consists of a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) step followed by gas chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry analysis. We used a preliminary derivatization step with ethyl chloroformate/ethanol and the corresponding ester was then extracted by SPME in immersion mode. Several fibers were evaluated and the optimization of the parameters affecting the SPME process was carried out using an experimental design. The optimal values were 20 min extraction time, 10% NaCl, and 270°C using a divinylbenzene/Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fiber. The triple quadrupole analyzer acquired data in selected reaction monitoring mode, allowing us to obtain reconstructed chromatograms with well-defined chromatographic peaks. The accuracy and precision of this method were evaluated at concentrations of 70, 250, and 800 ng/ml and were found to be acceptable. Very satisfactory values (0.10 and 0.16 ng/ml, respectively) were also achieved for the limit of detection and the limit of quantification.

The 27 ETS factors are probably a part of complex regulatory networks including interactions among family members. In human prostate cancer, rearrangements have been found in several genes of the ETS family resulting in chimeric oncoproteins. In a previous study we found that the ETS family prototype, Ets-1 affects biological properties of PC3 prostate cancer cells. In a first effort to understand the cooperative interactions between different ETS factors in prostate cancer, in the present study we examined the expression pattern of all 27 ETS members using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in the androgen-sensitive VCaP and LNCaP, and the androgen-insensitive PC3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines as well as in human prostate cancer tissue samples. We further investigated whether the ETS family prototype, Ets-1, regulates other ETS family members by examining the effect of Ets-1 blockade in PC3 cells on their expression. We found an expression specificity of various ETS family members in the prostate cancer cell lines which might reflect their different biological properties. In human prostate samples only 3 among the 27 ETS family members (Ehf, Elk-4 and Ets-2) showed significant expression differences between normal and cancerous prostate glands. We finally demonstrate that the family prototype, Ets-1, regulates the family members Elf-1, Elf-2, Elk-1, Etv-5 and Spi-1 in PC3 prostate cancer cells.

We found that GA induced apoptosis in human multiple myeloma cells that correlated with the inhibition of both constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation. STAT3 phosphorylation at both tyrosine residue 705 and serine residue 727 was inhibited by GA. STAT3 suppression was mediated through the inhibition of activation of the protein tyrosine kinases Janus-activated kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2. Treatment with the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor pervanadate reversed the GA-induced downregulation of STAT3, suggesting the involvement of a PTP. We also found that GA induced the expression of the PTP SHP-1. Deletion of the SHP-1 gene by siRNA suppressed the ability of GA to inhibit STAT3 activation and to induce apoptosis, suggesting the critical role of SHP-1 in its action. Moreover, GA downregulated the expression of STAT3-regulated antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1), proliferative (cyclin D1), and angiogenic (VEGF) proteins, and this correlated with suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Overall, these results suggest that GA blocks STAT3 activation, leading to suppression of tumor cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis.""","""['Sahdeo Prasad', 'Manoj K Pandey', 'Vivek R Yadav', 'Bharat B Aggarwal']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Retraction: Gambogic Acid Inhibits STAT3 Phosphorylation through Activation of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase SHP-1: Potential Role in Proliferation and Apoptosis.', 'Betulinic acid suppresses STAT3 activation pathway through induction of protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in human multiple myeloma cells.', 'Capillarisin inhibits constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation through induction of SHP-1 and SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatases.', 'γ-Tocotrienol but not γ-tocopherol blocks STAT3 cell signaling pathway through induction of protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents.', 'β-Caryophyllene oxide inhibits constitutive and inducible STAT3 signaling pathway through induction of the SHP-1 protein tyrosine phosphatase.', 'Resveratrol inhibits STAT3 signaling pathway through the induction of SOCS-1: Role in apoptosis induction and radiosensitization in head and neck tumor cells.', 'Gambogic Acid as a Candidate for Cancer Therapy: A Review.', 'Lymphotropic Viruses: Chronic Inflammation and Induction of Cancers.', 'Retraction: Gambogic Acid Inhibits STAT3 Phosphorylation through Activation of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase SHP-1: Potential Role in Proliferation and Apoptosis.', 'Gambogic Acid Induces Cell Apoptosis and Inhibits MAPK Pathway in PTEN-/-/p53-/- Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro and Ex Vivo.', 'Molecular targets of gambogic acid in cancer: recent trends and advancements.']"""

However, relief from RT may be delayed, incomplete, or short-lived and therefore optimized pharmacologic therapy is essential. Our objective was to describe the contribution of the clinical pharmacist (CP) to an outpatient palliative RT clinic.  Methods:   The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, an 11-point scale for measuring nine symptoms, and other validated screening tools were administered, and a medication history performed by the CP. Baseline CP assessment also included opioid toxicity, need for supportive medications, and drug interactions. Anonymized clinical information was collected prospectively and descriptive statistics were compiled including themes of counselling performed by the CP.  Results:   The CP reviewed 114 patients over 140 clinic visits (01/2007-12/2008). Median age was 68.3 years, 68.4% were male and 36.8% had prostate cancer. All symptoms improved or stabilized in ≥ 80% by 4 weeks. Median pain score was 6/10 (SD 2.6) at baseline, and 2.1/10 (SD 2.4) by week 4. Average morphine equivalent daily dose was 76.8 mg at baseline and 44.5 mg at week 4. CP assessment included screening for opioid toxicity (87.9%), recommending a change in analgesic (28.9%), and liaison with the community pharmacy (17.1%). Medication counselling took place in 84.3% of visits, on bowel routine (85.6% of the time), opioids (82.2%), and hydration (40.7%).

Androgens promote cholesterol accumulation by activating the sterol-regulatory element-binding protein isoform 2 (SREBP-2) transcription factor. However, SREBP-2 is in balance with the liver X receptor (LXR; NR1H2/NR1H3), a transcription factor that prevents cholesterol accumulation. Here, we show that LXR activity is down-regulated by the androgen receptor (AR; NR3C4). In turn, this reduces LXR target gene expression. This antagonism on LXR is also exerted by other steroid hormone receptors, including the estrogen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors. This suggests a generalizable mechanism, but the AR does not affect LXR mRNA levels, protein degradation, or DNA binding. We also found that the AR does not require protein synthesis to influence LXR, suggesting a direct antagonism. However, the AR does not directly bind LXR. The AR N-terminal domain (involved in transactivation), but not its DNA-binding domain, is required to suppress LXR activity, suggesting coactivator competition. Overall, this androgen-mediated antagonism of LXR complements SREBP-2 activation, providing a more complete picture as to how androgens increase cellular cholesterol levels in a prostate cancer setting.

Methods and materials:   Ten patients with early-stage disease were randomly selected. TRUS images of prostates were acquired using B and H modes. The prostates on all images were contoured by an experienced radiation oncologist (RO) and five equally trained observers. The observers were blinded to information regarding patient and imaging mode. The volumes of prostate glands and areas of midgland slices were calculated. Volumes contoured were compared among the observers and between observer group and RO. Contours on one patient were repeated five times by four observers to evaluate the intraobserver variability.  Results:   A one-sample Student t-test showed the volumes outlined by five observers are in agreement (p > 0.05) with the RO. Paired Student t-test showed prostate volumes (p = 0.008) and midgland areas (p = 0.006) with H mode were significantly smaller than that with B mode. Two-factor analysis of variances showed significant interobserver variability (p < 0.001) in prostate volumes and areas. Inter- and intraobserver consistency was quantified as the standard deviation of mean volumes and areas, and concordance indices. It was found that for small glands (≤35 cc) H mode provided greater interobserver consistency; however, for large glands (≥35 cc), B mode provided more consistent estimates.  Conclusions:   H mode provided superior inter- and intraobserver agreement in prostate volume definition for small to medium prostates. In large glands, H mode does not exhibit any additional advantage.

Methods and materials:   An EGS4 Monte Carlo code was used to calculate three-dimensional dose distributions from kVCBCT on 3 prostate cancer patients. Absorbed doses to various organs were compared between intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatments and kVCBCT scans. The impact of CBCT scanning mode, kilovoltage peak energy (kVp), and CBCT field span on dose deposition to testes and other organs was investigated.  Results:   In comparison with one 10-MV IMRT treatment, a 125-kV half-fan CBCT scan delivered 3.4, 3.8, 4.1, and 5.7 cGy to the prostate, rectum, bladder, and femoral heads, respectively, accounting for 1.7%, 3.2%, 3.2%, and 8.4% of megavoltage photon dose contributions. However, the testes received 2.9 cGy from the same CBCT scan, a threefold increase as compared with 0.7 cGy received during IMRT. With the same kVp, full-fan mode deposited much less dose to organs than half-fan mode, ranging from 9% less for prostate to 69% less for testes, except for rectum, where full-fan mode delivered 34% more dose. As photon beam energy increased from 60 to 125 kV, kVCBCT-contributed doses increased exponentially for all organs, irrespective of scanning mode. Reducing CBCT field span from 30 to 10 cm in the superior-inferior direction cut testicular doses from 5.7 to 0.2 cGy in half-fan mode and from 1.5 to 0.1 cGy in full-fan mode.  Conclusions:   Compared with IMRT, kVCBCT-contributed doses to the prostate, rectum, bladder, and femoral heads are clinically insignificant, whereas dose to the testes is threefold more. Full-fan CBCT usually deposits much less dose to organs (except for rectum) than half-fan mode in prostate patients. Kilovoltage CBCT-contributed doses increase exponentially with photon beam energy.

Only partial data are available for the human tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The aim of our study was to analyze the hypoxic and pro-inflammatory microenvironment in GBMs and to demonstrate that in a stem/progenitor cell line derived from human glioblastoma (GBM-SCs), hypoxia activates a coordinated inflammatory response, evidencing an invasive and migratory phenotype.  Methods:   From each of 10 human solid glioblastomas, clinically and histopathologically characterized, we obtained three surgical samples taken from the center and the periphery of the tumor, and from adjacent host normal tissue. Molecular and morphological analyses were carried out using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot (WB). GBM stem and differentiated cells were incubated under hypoxic conditions and analyzed for pro-inflammatory gene expression and for invasive/migratory behavior.  Results:   A panel of selected representative pro-inflammatory genes (RAGE and P2X7R, COX2, NOS2 and, PTX3) were analyzed, comparing tumor, peritumor and host normal tissues. Tumors containing leukocyte infiltrates (as assessed using CD45 immunohistochemistry) were excluded. Selected genes were overexpressed in the central regions of the tumors (i.e. in the more hypoxic areas), less expressed in peripheral regions, and poorly expressed or absent in adjacent normal host tissues. Western blot analysis confirmed that the corresponding pro-inflammatory proteins were also differently expressed. Hypoxic stem cell lines showed a clear time-dependent activation of the entire panel of pro-inflammatory genes as compared to differentiated tumor cells. Biological assays showed that invasive and migratory behavior was strengthened by hypoxia only in GBM stem cells.  Conclusions:   In human solid glioblastoma we have observed a coordinated overexpression of a panel of pro-inflammatory genes as compared to host normal tissue. We have also evidenced a similar pattern of overexpressed genes in GBM-SCs after hypoxic treatment, showing also a gain of invasive and migratory function that was lost when these stem cells differentiated.

Six of the 39 lymphoceles (15.4%) were clinically symptomatic. The symptoms were as follows: pelvic pressure in five patients, abdominal distension with ileus in three patients, leg pain/weakness in one patient and costovertebral tenderness in one patient. Two lymphoceles required intervention. • On the logistic regression model the presence of nodal metastases, tumour volume in the prostate specimen and extracapsular extension (ECE) were independent risk factors for the development of a lymphocele. • There was no correlation between estimated blood loss, body mass index, pathological Gleason score or number nodes dissected and the presence of lymphocele.  Conclusions:   • The incidence of lymphoceles was higher than anticipated given the believed protective effect of the transperitoneal approach against lymphocele formation. • The risk of lymphocele seemed to increase linearly with the presence of more extensive disease, particularly ECE and nodal involvement. • The benefit of PLND during RARP should be weighed against the elevated risk of lymphocele formation and its potential complications.""","""['Marcelo A Orvieto', 'Rafael F Coelho', 'Sanket Chauhan', 'Kenneth J Palmer', 'Bernardo Rocco', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Incidence of lymphoceles after robot-assisted pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Incidence of lymphoceles after robot-assisted pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Lymphocele after extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a propensity score-matching study.', 'Pelvic lymphadenectomy during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Assessing nodal yield, perioperative outcomes, and complications.', 'Novel Technique Prevents Lymphoceles After Transperitoneal Robotic-assisted Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection: Peritoneal Flap Interposition.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'High BMI and Surgical Time Are Significant Predictors of Lymphocele after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Bilateral Peritoneal Flaps Reduce Incidence and Complications of Lymphoceles after Robotic Radical Prostatectomy with Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection-Results of the Prospective Randomized Multicenter Trial ProLy.', 'Occurrence of symptomatic lymphocele after open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Delayed infected lymphocele associated with intracavernosal penile injection.', 'High BMI, Aggressive Tumours and Long Console Time Are Independent Predictive Factors for Symptomatic Lymphocele Formation after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection.']"""

Overexpression of miR-221 in LNCaP cells significantly increased the level of NSE expression and induced NE differentiation. Knocking down the level of miR-221 expression with antagonist miR-221 in the LNCaP-AI cell line increased migration and invasion (P < 0.01). DVL2 protein level was up-regulated after transfection of anti-miR-221. MiR-221 was up-regulated in CaP plasma (P < 0.01). We demonstrate a significant difference in miR-221 expression between ADPC and AIPC. MiR-221 may contribute to NE differentiation, which may be the cause for AIPC. We also suggest that miR-221 may control the migration of AIPC cells through DVL2, working as a key regulator in advanced CaP.

Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) has been tested as a target antigen due to its high and apparently specific expression in the prostate. We used a variety of approaches to analyze PAP expression, including immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We complemented these laboratory-based techniques with an in silico analysis of reported PAP expression in human cDNA libraries. Our studies confirmed that, while PAP expression is not restricted to prostate tissues, its expression in other human tissues is approximately 1-2 orders of magnitude less than that observed in the prostate. The relative specificity of PAP expression in the prostate supports its use as a target of autologous cellular immunotherapy.

Understanding the resistance to therapy could aid the development of more effective treatments.  Aim:   The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) on prostate cancer cell proliferation and its effects on the response to docetaxel.  Methods:   DU145 and PC3 cells were treated with IGFBP-2, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) alone or in combination with blockade of the IGF-I receptor or integrin receptors. Cells were also treated with IGFBP-2 short interfering ribonucleic acid with or without a PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) inhibitor or docetaxel. Tritiated thymidine incorporation was used to measure cell proliferation and Trypan blue cell counting for cell death. Levels of IGFBP-2 mRNA were measured using RT-PCR. Abundance and phosphorylation of proteins were assessed using western immunoblotting.  Results:   The IGFBP-2 promoted cell growth in both cell lines but with PC3 cells this was in an IGF-dependent manner, whereas with DU145 cells the effect was independent of IGF receptor activation. This IGF-independent effect of IGFBP-2 was mediated by interaction with β-1-containing integrins and a consequent increase in PTEN phosphorylation. We also determined that silencing IGFBP-2 in both cell lines increased the sensitivity of the cells to docetaxel.  Conclusion:   The IGFBP-2 has a key role in the growth of prostate cancer cells, and silencing IGFBP-2 expression reduced the resistance of these cells to docetaxel.

One underlying mechanism for efficient hormone therapy is based on corepressors that inactivate the AR. In line with this, castration-resistant prostate cancer is associated with malfunction or reduced corepressor action. To overcome this, the overexpression of endogenous corepressors, however, affects many other transcription factors. Therefore, an AR-specific corepressor could be of advantage. Using a yeast peptide aptamer two-hybrid screen with the full-length human AR, we identified a short amino acid-stretch that binds specifically to the human AR in yeast and in mammalian cells and not to the closely related progesterone or glucocorticoid receptors. Furthermore, fused to a silencing domain, this aptamer-based corepressor (AB-CoR) exhibits corepressor activity by inhibiting both the AR-mediated transactivation and expression of the AR target gene PSA. Furthermore, stable expression of the AB-CoR inhibits growth of human LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we generated a cell-permeable AB-CoR by fusing a protein transduction domain to establish a vector-free transport system. Treatment of LNCaP cells with the bacterially expressed and affinity-purified cell-permeable AB-CoR peptide resulted in a significant inhibition of both AR-mediated transactivation and prostate cancer cell proliferation.

For this, a filter is applied in k-space and the signal amplitude is analyzed in the image domain to determine quantitatively the susceptibility gradient for each pixel. It is shown in simulations and experiments that SUMO results in a better visualization of small structures in comparison to SGM. SUMO is applied to patient datasets for visualization of stent and prostate brachytherapy seeds. In addition, SUMO also provides quantitative information about the number of prostate brachytherapy seeds.

Additionally, HIF-1α transcription activity both in normoxic and hypoxic conditions is reduced after MSeA treatment of prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, VEGF and GLUT1, downstream targets of HIF-1α, were also reduced in prostate cancer cells after MSeA treatment.

Here, we show reduced RGS2 protein expression in human prostate cancer specimens compared to adjacent normal or hyperplastic tissue. Methylation-specific PCR analysis and bisulfite sequencing indicated that methylation of the CpG island in the RGS2 gene promoter correlated with RGS2 downregulation in prostate cancer. In vitro methylation of this promoter suppressed reporter gene expression in transient transfection studies, whereas reversal of this promoter methylation with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) induced RGS2 reexpression in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and inhibited their growth under androgen-deficient conditions. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of 5-Aza-dC was significantly reduced by an RGS2-targeted short hairpin RNA, indicating that reexpressed RGS2 contributed to this growth inhibition. Restoration of RGS2 levels by ectopic expression in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells suppressed growth of xenografts in castrated mice. Thus, RGS2 promoter hypermethylation represses its expression and unmasks a latent pathway for AR transactivation in prostate cancer cells.

Participants included academic clinicians (n=16), interns/residents (n=84) and community clinicians (n=35). Physicians completed a 26-item survey that assessed attitudes about the SDM process for PCS.  Results:   More physicians endorsed SDM (47.4%) or the patient deciding (35.6%), while few physicians wanted to decide for their patients about screening. However, 54.8% endorsed an annual PSA as the standard of care. Most felt that decisions should be based on full disclosure of the risks and benefits of testing (93.3%), and few believed that the sensitivity and specificity of the PSA was adequate (36.6%). Across all physicians, lack of time, competing health demands, malpractice fears, and patient interest were all commonly cited as potential factors that influence the SDM process. Compared to academic clinicians and interns/residents, community clinicians were more likely to endorse annual screening, to be concerned about malpractice, and to agree that PSA sensitivity and specificity are acceptable.

Credible evidence exists for the antitumor activity of this compound, but high concentrations are needed for significant therapeutic effect. Unfortunately, these high concentrations produce detrimental side effects involving the nervous system, thereby precluding its use for cancer treatment. The mechanistic basis of the compound's antitumor activity is its ability to activate the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex through inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. As the compound inhibits the kinase at micromolar concentrations, it is not known why therapeutically prohibitive high doses are needed for suppression of tumor growth. We hypothesized that lack of effective mechanisms for the entry of DCA into tumor cells may underlie this phenomenon. Here we show that SLC5A8 transports DCA very effectively with high affinity. This transporter is expressed in normal cells, but expression is silenced in tumor cells by epigenetic mechanisms. The lack of the transporter makes tumor cells resistant to the antitumor activity of DCA. However, if the transporter is expressed in tumor cells ectopically, the cells become sensitive to the drug at low concentrations. This is evident in breast cancer cells, colon cancer cells and prostate cancer cells. Normal cells, which constitutively express the transporter, are however not affected by the compound, indicating tumor cell-selective therapeutic activity. The mechanism of the compound's antitumor activity still remains its ability to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and force mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate. As silencing of SLC5A8 in tumors involves DNA methylation and its expression can be induced by treatment with DNA methylation inhibitors, our findings suggest that combining DCA with a DNA methylation inhibitor would offer a means to reduce the doses of DCA to avoid detrimental effects associated with high doses but without compromising antitumor activity.""","""['E Babu', 'S Ramachandran', 'V CoothanKandaswamy', 'S Elangovan', 'P D Prasad', 'V Ganapathy', 'M Thangaraju']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Transport by SLC5A8 with subsequent inhibition of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC3 underlies the antitumor activity of 3-bromopyruvate.', 'Sodium dichloroacetate selectively targets cells with defects in the mitochondrial ETC.', 'The Comparative Experimental Study of Sodium and Magnesium Dichloroacetate Effects on Pediatric PBT24 and SF8628 Cell Glioblastoma Tumors Using a Chicken Embryo Chorioallantoic Membrane Model and on Cells In Vitro.', 'SLC5A8 (SMCT1)-mediated transport of butyrate forms the basis for the tumor suppressive function of the transporter.', 'Biological functions of SLC5A8, a candidate tumour suppressor.', 'Promoter Methylation of Tumor Suppressors in Thyroid Carcinoma: A Systematic Review.', 'Different Effects of Valproic Acid on SLC12A2, SLC12A5 and SLC5A8 Gene Expression in Pediatric Glioblastoma Cells as an Approach to Personalised Therapy.', 'SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Sex-Related Differences, and a Possible Personalized Treatment Approach with Valproic Acid: A Review.', 'The effect of valproic acid on SLC5A8 expression in gonad-intact and gonadectomized rat thymocytes.', 'PUF60/AURKA Axis Contributes to Tumor Progression and Malignant Phenotypes in Bladder Cancer.']"""

In support, numerous mediators of SC self-renewal have been evinced to show oncogenic potential. We have recently reported that short-hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal gene NANOG significantly reduced the clonogenic and tumorigenic capabilities of various cancer cells. In this study, we sought to test the potential pro-tumorigenic functions of NANOG, particularly, in prostate cancer (PCa). Using qRT-PCR, we first confirmed that PCa cells expressed NANOG mRNA primarily from the NANOGP8 locus on chromosome 15q14. We then constructed a lentiviral promoter reporter in which the -3.8-kb NANOGP8 genomic fragment was used to drive the expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP). We observed that NANOGP8-GFP(+) PCa cells showed cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics such as enhanced clonal growth and tumor regenerative capacity. To further investigate the functions and mechanisms of NANOG in tumorigenesis, we established tetracycline-inducible NANOG-overexpressing cancer cell lines, including both PCa (Du145 and LNCaP) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. NANOG induction promoted drug resistance in MCF-7 cells, tumor regeneration in Du145 cells and, most importantly, castration-resistant tumor development in LNCaP cells. These pro-tumorigenic effects of NANOG were associated with key molecular changes, including an upregulation of molecules such as CXCR4, IGFBP5, CD133 and ALDH1.

Particularly, prostatic small cell carcinoma is a rare variant with aggressive behavior. Distinction between small cell carcinoma of the prostate and urinary bladder may be challenging, especially in small biopsy specimens without associated prostatic adenocarcinoma or urothelial carcinoma. Recently, gene fusions between ETS genes, particularly ETS-related gene (ERG), and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) have been identified as a frequent event in prostate cancer. Thus, molecular methods may be helpful in determining the primary site of small cell carcinoma. Thirty cases of prostatic small cell carcinoma from the authors' archives were studied, among which 13 had concurrent prostatic adenocarcinoma. Tricolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections with a probe cocktail for 3'/5' ERG and TMPRSS2. Cases of small cell carcinoma of the bladder and conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma (25 each) were also tested as controls. ERG gene alterations were found only in prostate malignancies and not in benign prostatic tissue or bladder small cell carcinoma. TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion was found in 47% (14/30) of prostatic small cell carcinoma. Of cases with concurrent prostatic adenocarcinoma, 85% (11/13) had identical findings in both components. In 20% of rearranged cases, the ERG abnormality was associated with 5' ERG deletion. In 17% (5/30) of cases, gain of the 21q22 locus was present. Two cases showed discordant aberrations in the small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, one with deletion of 5' ERG and one with gain of chromosome 21q, both in only the adenocarcinoma component. Small cell carcinoma of the prostate demonstrates TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement with comparable frequency to prostatic adenocarcinoma. In cases with concurrent adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma, the majority showed identical abnormalities in both components, indicating a likely common clonal origin. Discordant alterations were present in rare cases, suggesting that acquisition of additional genetic changes in multifocal tumors may be responsible for disease progression to a more aggressive phenotype. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is absent in bladder small cell carcinoma, supporting the utility of FISH in distinguishing prostate from bladder primary tumors and identifying metastatic small cell carcinoma of unknown origin.""","""['Sean R Williamson', 'Shaobo Zhang', 'Jorge L Yao', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Antonio Lopez-Beltran', 'Steven Shen', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya', 'Gregory T MacLennan', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Liang Cheng']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in small cell carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Frequent TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement in prostatic small cell carcinoma detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization: the superiority of fluorescence in situ hybridization over ERG immunohistochemistry.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in metastatic prostate cancers: a study of fine needle aspiration specimens.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Narrative review of challenges in the management of advanced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Molecular events in neuroendocrine prostate cancer development.', 'A narrative review of individualized treatments of genitourinary tumors: is the future brighter with molecular evaluations?', 'Genomics of High-Grade Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Well-Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumor with High-Grade Features (G3 NET) and Neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NEC) of Various Anatomic Sites.', 'Single-cell analysis supports a luminal-neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in human prostate cancer.']"""

The TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion that leads to ERG overexpression occurs in ~70% of prostate cancers. Implementation of fusion gene detection in pathological practice, however, has been hampered by the lack of reliable ERG antibodies. The objective of this study was first to compare ERG immunohistochemistry using the recently described antibody EPR3864 with ERG mRNA by quantitative PCR and, second, to investigate ERG immunohistochemistry in diagnostic prostate cancer needle biopsies. We analyzed 41 primary prostate adenocarcinomas obtained by radical prostatectomy and 83 consecutive prostate cancer needle biopsies. In the prostatectomy specimens, immunohistochemical ERG expression was highly concordant with the ERG mRNA overexpression (sensitivity 100% and specificity 85%). ERG overexpression was due to TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in all cases. ERG protein expression was identified in 51/83 adenocarcinomas (61%) on needle biopsies. ERG expression was more frequent in tumors infiltrating ≥2 needle biopsies (P<0.001) or occupying ≥50% of a single biopsy (P=0.018). Expression of ERG also occurred in 11/21 (52%) high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia lesions. In 5/87 (6%) needle biopsies containing benign secretory glands, weak ERG staining was focally observed. In all of these cases, respective glands were adjacent to adenocarcinomas. In conclusion, immunohistochemistry for ERG strongly correlated with ERG mRNA overexpression and was specific for prostate cancer on needle biopsies. Therefore, ERG immunohistochemistry is an important adjunctive tool for pathophysiological studies on ERG gene fusions, and might support the pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in a subset of prostate needle biopsies.""","""['Geert J L H van Leenders', 'Joost L Boormans', 'Cornelis J Vissers', 'A Marije Hoogland', 'Anke A J W M Bressers', 'Bungo Furusato', 'Jan Trapman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Antibody-based detection of ERG rearrangements in prostate core biopsies, including diagnostically challenging cases: ERG staining in prostate core biopsies.', 'The utility of ERG/P63 double immunohistochemical staining in the diagnosis of limited cancer in prostate needle biopsies.', 'Immunohistochemistry for ERG expression as a surrogate for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion detection in prostatic adenocarcinomas.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'In\u2009situ expression of ERG protein in the context of tumor heterogeneity identifies prostate cancer patients with inferior prognosis.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Prevalence and clinical application of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in Asian prostate cancer patients: a large-sample study in Chinese people and a systematic review.', 'ERG expression in prostate cancer biopsies with and without high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: a study in Jordanian Arab patients.', 'Immunoreactivity for prostate specific antigen and Ki67 differentiates subgroups of prostate cancer related to outcome.']"""

We used age- and multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prostate cancer incidence among patients taking statins (n = 41,078) compared with patients taking antihypertensive medications (n = 14,797). We performed similar analyses for all lipid parameters including total cholesterol examining each lipid parameter as a continuous variable and by quartiles. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Compared with men taking an antihypertensive medication, statin users were 31% less likely (HR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.90) to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Furthermore, statin users were 14% less likely (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.62 to 1.20) to be diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer and 60% less likely (HR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.24 to 0.65) to be diagnosed with high-grade prostate cancer compared with antihypertensive medication users.

Conclusions:   Statin use is associated with statistically significantly reduced risk for total and high-grade prostate cancer, and increased levels of serum cholesterol are associated with higher risk for total and high-grade prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   Age, percentages of positive cores at Trans Rectal Ultrasound Scan Biopsy (TRUSB) (P+), biopsy Gleason score (bGS), LH, Total Testosterone (TT), Free Testosterone (FT) and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) were the continuous clinical variables. All patients had histologically proven carcinoma of the prostate and had not previously received 5α-reductase inhibitors, LH-releasing hormone analogues or testosterone replacement treatment. Correlation analysis was performed for the patient population. Correlation analysis, linear regression and analysis of variance was computed in groups and subgroups of the prostate cancer population.  Results:   Correlation analysis of the patient population showed that LH was significantly correlated to age (p=0.02) and FT (p=0.01). The population was clustered in LH I (LH≤7.5 IU/l) and LH II (LH>7.5 IU/l). Correlation analysis showed significant LH correlations for TT (p<0.0001) and FT (p=0.0004) for LH I; significant LH correlation to FT (p=0.0001) for LH II. Simple linear regression showed that LH was significantly predicted by both TT (p-Value<0.0001) and FT (p-Value=0.0004) in LH I; but only FT (p-Value<0.0001) in LH II. Multiple linear regression showed that LH was significantly predicted by both TT (p-Value=0.0004) and PSA (p-Value=0.03) in LH I; but only by FT (p-Value=0.003) in LH II. Analysis of variance showed that: a) LH and age were significantly lower in LH I than II; b) LH I expressed higher mean FT levels (p=0.08) and lower mean P+ (p=0.07) than LH II. The LH versus PSA plot was computed for LH group I and 3 sub clusters were created: LH I group A (LH/PSA≤0.25), B (0.25<LH/PSA ≤0.75), and C (LH/PSA>0.75). Correlation analysis showed that LH was significantly correlated to age (p=0.01), TT (p=0.03) and PSA (p=0.0004) in LH IA; LH was significantly correlated to PSA (p<0.0001) in LH IB; and LH significantly correlated to TT (p=0.005), FT (p=0.01), and PSA (p=0.008) in LH 1C. Multiple linear regression showed that LH was significantly correlated to age (p=0.02) and PSA (p=0.01) in LH IA, to TT (p=0.01) and PSA (p<0.0001) in LH IB, and to PSA (p=0.003) and weakly to TT (p=0.09) in LH IC. The groups differed significantly for mean levels of LH (p=0.0004), TT (p=0.005), FT (p=0.01), PSA (p<0.0001), bGS (p=0.003). Analysis of variance between the subgroups of the patient population (LH IA, LH IB, LH IC, LH II) showed significant differences in mean levels for LH (p<0.0001), age (p=0.004), TT (p=0.009), FT (p=0.02), PSA (p<0.0001), PSA/FT (p<0.0001), bGS (p=0.01), but not for P+ (p=0.10).  Conclusion:   According to LH physiopathology, the prostate cancer population could be clustered into hypo-gonadic and non-hypo-gonadic group at diagnosis. The hypo-gonadic group expresses an aggressive tumor phenotype and might be divided into two more different significant subsets including primary and secondary hypo-gonadic patients: the former (LH II) including older patients with high LH levels, the latter (LH IA) including younger patients with low LH and LH/PSA levels (subgroup LH IA). The non-hypo-gonadic group showed a less aggressive tumor phenotype and according to the LH/PSA ratio might beclustered into LH IB (0.25<LH/PSA≤0.75) and LH IC (LH/PSA>0.75), the former showing a more aggressive tumor phenotype than the latter.

Because many genes are specifically overexpressed in cancer cells, one strategy to improve prostate cancer detection is to image intraprostatic cancer-specific transcriptional activity. Because of the obstacles of weak cancer- or tissue-specific promoter activity and bladder clearance of many PET tracers, intraprostatic PET of gene transcriptional activity has not been previously reported.  Methods:   The two-step transcriptional amplification (TSTA) system that amplifies the prostate-specific antigen promoter activity was used for PET imaging of the reporter gene herpes simplex virus type-1 sr39 thymidine kinase (HSV1-sr39tk). The TSTA-sr39tk system was injected directly into prostates or prostatic tumors as a replication-incompetent adenovirus (AdTSTA-sr39tk) and imaged using PET.  Results:   AdTSTA-sr39tk was able to image prostate-specific antigen promoter transcriptional activity by 9-(4-(18)F-fluoro-3-[hydroxymethyl]butyl)guanine PET, in both mouse and canine prostates in vivo. Ex vivo small-animal PET images, scintigraphic counts, and sr39tk expression analysis confirmed the specificity of the observed signal.  Conclusion:   Here, by combining the TSTA-amplified signal with a protocol for tracer administration, we show that in vivo PET detection of transcriptional activity is possible in both mouse and immunocompetent canine prostates. These results suggest that imaging applications using transcription-based tumor-specific promoters should be pursued to better visualize cancer foci that escape detection by conventional biopsies.""","""['Frédéric Pouliot', 'Breanne D W Karanikolas', 'Mai Johnson', 'Makoto Sato', 'Saul J Priceman', 'David Stout', 'Joanne Sohn', 'Nagichettiar Satyamurthy', 'Jean B deKernion', 'Lily Wu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Titration of variant HSV1-tk gene expression to determine the sensitivity of 18F-FHBG PET imaging in a prostate tumor.', 'CL1-SR39: A noninvasive molecular imaging model of prostate cancer suicide gene therapy using positron emission tomography.', 'Ad5-(PSE-BC)-(GAL4-(VP16)2)-(GAL4)5-sr39tk.', 'A tracer kinetic model for 18F-FHBG for quantitating herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase reporter gene expression in living animals using PET.', 'Ad5-(PSE-BC)-(GAL4-(VP16)2)-(GAL4)5-Fluc.', 'A brief review of reporter gene imaging in oncolytic virotherapy and gene therapy.', 'Development of a Transcriptional Amplification System Based on the PEG3 Promoter to Target Androgen Receptor-Positive and -Negative Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'A PCA3 gene-based transcriptional amplification system targeting primary prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Homologous recombination-based adenovirus vector system for tumor cell-specific gene delivery.']"""

The recent development of SNP array technology has facilitated studies on copy number changes at a genome-wide scale with high resolution. However, existing copy number analysis methods are oblivious to normal cell contamination and cannot distinguish between contributions of cancerous and normal cells to the measured copy number signals. This contamination could significantly confound downstream analysis of CNAs and affect the power to detect SCEs in clinical samples.  Results:   We report here a statistically principled in silico approach, Bayesian Analysis of COpy number Mixtures (BACOM), to accurately estimate genomic deletion type and normal tissue contamination, and accordingly recover the true copy number profile in cancer cells. We tested the proposed method on two simulated datasets, two prostate cancer datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas high-grade ovarian dataset, and obtained very promising results supported by the ground truth and biological plausibility. Moreover, based on a large number of comparative simulation studies, the proposed method gives significantly improved power to detect SCEs after in silico correction of normal tissue contamination. We develop a cross-platform open-source Java application that implements the whole pipeline of copy number analysis of heterogeneous cancer tissues including relevant processing steps. We also provide an R interface, bacomR, for running BACOM within the R environment, making it straightforward to include in existing data pipelines.

Purpose:   To investigate the feasibility of MR elastography in the diagnosis of prostate cancer at 3.0T, and to assess the elasticity and viscosity of prostate cancer and benign prostatic disease.  Material and methods:   Eight patients (63 ± 7.25 years old) with 12 foci of prostate cancer and 10 patients (59 ± 3.25 years old) with 14 foci of prostatitis in the peripheral zone were evaluated by MRE. Ten healthy volunteers (41 ± 4.32 years old) with 18 ROIs in the peripheral zone of the prostate were also assessed with MR elastography as a control group. The results were confirmed by histopathological findings. All examinations were performed on a 3.0T Philips Achieva scanner. MRE was implemented by transmitting low-frequency longitudinal mechanical waves of 100Hz into the prostate with a transducer placed above the pubic bones. The phase images were reconstructed to acquire viscoelastic mapping. T-test was used to compare the mean elasticity and viscosity of prostate cancer and prostatitis. A comparison of prostate cancer and healthy prostate tissue in elasticity was also evaluated. The correlation of elasticity and Gleason scores between prostate cancer and prostatitis were retrospectively analyzed with Pearson Correlation.  Results:   The mean elasticity and viscosity were significantly higher in the lesions with prostate cancer (6.55 ± 0.47 kPa, 6.56 ± 0.99 Pa.s, respectively) than in regions with prostatitis (1.99 ± 0.66 kPa, 2.13 ± 0.21 Pa.s). The difference between prostate cancer and prostatitis was statistically significant (t = 19.392, p < 0.01; t = 16.372, p < 0.01). The elasticity and viscosity of the healthy peripheral zone of prostate were 2.26 ± 0.45 kPa, 2.38 ± 0.54 Pa.s, respectively. There also was significant difference in elasticity between prostate cancer and normal peripheral zone (t = 25.136, p < 0.01). In addition, we observed a positive correlation between Gleason scores and elasticity of the prostate cancer (r = 0.913, P < 0.01) in this study.

The relationship between MRI stage and BCR was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Multivariate analysis and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis were used to investigate the incremental value over the standard clinical variables in prediction of BCR.  Results:   As of August 2009, 12 (20%) patients had BCR.

The appearance of new or worsening bone sclerosis on CT in patients with prostate cancer may therefore be erroneously classified as disease progression.  Purpose:   To assess the incidence of osteoblastic healing flare response at 3-month CT assessment in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer and to identify associated features that enable differentiation from progressive metastatic bone disease at 3 months.  Material and methods:   CT scans of 67 patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer undergoing treatment were reviewed by a radiologist blinded to clinical outcome. Changes in number, size, and density of metastatic bone lesions were documented and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) in soft tissue lesions, alkaline phosphatase, prostate specific antigen, and (99m)Tc-MDP bone scans were used for correlation.  Results:   Of the 39 patients who had 3- and 6-month follow-up, eight patients (21%) demonstrated an increase in number, size, or density of sclerotic lesions on the 3-month CT scan despite improvement in PSA and soft tissue lesions. Three out of eight patients (8%) maintained partial response/remained stable at follow-up and were defined as showing a flare response: in this group bone metastases evident on CT showed a qualitative and quantitative increase in density and no lesions faded at 3 months. In contrast, in all patients who progressed at 3 months by PSA/RECIST criteria (n = 8) bone lesions showed a mixed pattern with some lesions increasing and others decreasing in density.

Purpose:   To assess whether the administration of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA) significantly affects the DWI of prostate lesions or normal tissue at the 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3.0 T MRI).  Material and methods:   Fifty-one patients with 52 prostate lesions, including 32 prostate cancer (25 in the peripheral zone [PZ] and seven that could not be confidently located) and 20 benign lesions (11 in PZ and nine in central grand [CG]), underwent echo-planar imaging (EPI)-DWI with b values of 0, 1000 s/mm(2) before and after administration of Gd-DTPA at 3.0 T MRI. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn in all lesions, 42 normal PZ, 44 CG tissue and air to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and ADC values of lesions and normal tissue, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of lesions for pre- and post-contrast images. Statistical differences between pre- and post-contrast data were assessed by use of a paired t test.  Results:   No significant differences between pre- and post-contrast images were found in the CNR of lesions and SNR of all the tissue except CG, which showed a statistically significant decline (9.6%, p < 0.0001) in SNR after contrast relative to the pre-contrast images. The post-contrast ADC values were statistically significantly lower than pre-contrast for prostate cancer (0.80 ± 0.11 mm(2)/s Vs 0.89 ± 0.12 mm(2)/s, p < 0.0001) and benign lesions (1.14 ± 0.30 mm(2)/s vs. 1.2 ± 0.29 mm(2)/s, p < 0.0001). No significant differences were detected for normal tissue.  Conclusion:   The administration of Gd-DTPA can slightly affect the DWI image quality of the prostate and reduce the ADC value of lesions at 3.0T MRI.

There is, however, no consensus on the best comorbidity classification for this purpose. In this study, we used a heuristic approach to identify an optimal comorbidity classification in elderly men selected for radical prostatectomy.  Methods and materials:   A total of 1,106 men aged 65 years or older who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer were stratified by 11 3-sided comorbidity classifications. Overall survival was the study endpoint. The comorbidity classifications were evaluated considering 4 statistical (height of hazard ratios and P values, survival difference between high and low risk patients, dose-response relationship) and 4 clinical demands (survival rates in low and high risk group, balance of the proportion of the risk groups). The 3 best classifications in each category received 3, 2, or 1 point. After adding all points, the classification with the highest score was considered best.  Results:   With one exception, all comorbidity classifications were significant predictors of overall survival. Comparing the highest with the lowest risk group, the hazard ratios ranged between 1.67 and 3.93. Concerning the fulfillment of clinical and statistical demands, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification and 1 derivative of it that included further more clearly defined diseases were the most promising candidates.

Methods and materials:   We undertook an observational cohort study using registry and administrative claims data from the SEER-Medicare database. We identified men aged 65 years or older diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the United States between 2002 and 2004 who received IMRT (n = 5,845) or CRT (n = 6,753). The primary outcome was a composite measure of bowel complications. Secondary outcomes were composite measures of urinary and erectile complications. We also examined specific subsets of bowel (proctitis/hemorrhage) and urinary (cystitis/hematuria) events within the composite complication measures.  Results:   IMRT was associated with reductions in composite bowel complications (24-month cumulative incidence 18.8% vs. 22.5%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.93) and proctitis/hemorrhage (HR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95). IMRT was not associated with rates of composite urinary complications (HR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.04) or cystitis/hematuria (HR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83-1.07). The incidence of erectile complications involving invasive procedures was low and did not differ significantly between groups, although IMRT was associated with an increase in new diagnoses of impotence (HR 1.27, 95% CI, 1.14-1.42).

Objective:   To provide updated information, we analyzed trends in mortality from cancer of the prostate, testis, bladder, and kidney in Europe from 1970 to 2008.  Design, setting, and participants:   We derived data for 33 European countries from the World Health Organization database.  Measurements:   We computed world-standardized mortality rates and used joinpoint regression to identify significant changes in trends.  Results and limitations:   Mortality from prostate cancer has leveled off since the 1990s in countries of western and northern Europe, particularly over the last few years while it was still rising in Bulgaria, Romania, and Russia. In the European Union (EU), it reached a peak in 1995 at 15.0 per 100 000 men and declined to 12.5 per 100 000 in 2006. Mortality from testicular cancer has steadily declined in most countries in western and northern Europe since the 1970s. The declines were later and appreciably lower in central/eastern Europe. In EU, rates declined from 0.75 in 1980 to 0.32 per 100 000 men in 2006, with stronger declines up to the late 1990s and an apparent leveling off in rates thereafter. Over the last 15 years, mortality from bladder cancer has declined in most European countries in both sexes. The major exceptions were Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania. In the EU, bladder cancer mortality was stable until 1992 and declined thereafter from 7.3 to 5.5 per 100 000 men and from 1.5 to 1.2 per 100 000 women in 2006. Mortality from kidney cancer increased throughout Europe until the early 1990s and leveled off thereafter in many countries, except in a few central and eastern ones. Between 1994 and 2006, rates declined from 4.9 to 4.3 per 100 000 in EU men and from 2.1 to 1.8 per 100 000 in EU women.

Gender theory suggests that dominant ideals of masculinity shape men's health and food practices; however, the role of female partners in men's diets is poorly understood. Through qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews, this article explores accounts of 14 Canadian couples' food practices guided by a gender relations framework to expose how tacit performances of masculinity and femininity interact to shape the diets of men with prostate cancer. Findings show that many men became more interested and involved in their diets after a prostate cancer diagnosis, practices that might be theorized as a counter hegemonic project or 'feminization', adding to other prostate cancer induced emasculations (i.e., treatment induced incontinence and impotence). At the same time, however, couples mutually limited men's engagement with diet while concurrently reinforcing women's traditional femininities in nurturing the men in their lives through food provision. Also embedded here were women's attempts to mitigate subordinate productions of masculinity by catering to their partner's tastes as well as monitoring their diets. Most couples mutually maintained traditional gender food 'roles' by positioning women as proficient leaders in domestic food provision and men as unskilled 'try-hard' and sometimes uninterested assistants. Findings also revealed complex gender power dynamics that predominated as complicit in sustaining hegemonic masculinity through women's deference to men's preferences and careful negotiation of instrumental support for men's diet changes. Overall men and women jointly worked to re-inscribe hetero-normative family food practices that shaped men's diets and nutritional health.""","""['Lawrence William Mróz', 'Gwen E Chapman', 'John L Oliffe', 'Joan L Bottorff']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Soc Sci Med""","""['""He\'s more typically female because he\'s not afraid to cry"": connecting heterosexual gender relations and men\'s depression.', ""Gender relations and couple negotiations of British men's food practice changes after prostate cancer."", ""Women on men's sexual health and sexually transmitted infection testing: a gender relations analysis."", ""Men, food, and prostate cancer: gender influences on men's diets."", 'Men, culture and hegemonic masculinity: understanding the experience of prostate cancer.', 'Cultural Scripts Underpinning Prostate Cancer-Literacy in Japan.', ""How men receive and utilise partner support when trying to change their diet and physical activity within a men's weight management programme."", 'Meat, Masculinity, and Health for the ""Typical Aussie Bloke"": A Social Constructivist Analysis of Class, Gender, and Consumption.', 'Family food practices: relationships, materiality and the everyday at the end of life.', 'The sociology of cancer: a decade of research.']"""

During treatment sessions, bladder and rectal repletion is difficult to quantify and cannot be measured with a single and initial CT scan acquisition. Some methods, such as image-guided radiation therapy and dose-guided radiation therapy, aim to compensate this missing information through periodic CT acquisitions. The aim is to adapt patient's position, beam configuration or prescribed dose for a dosimetric compliance.  Methods:   We evaluated organ motion (and repletion) for 54 patients after having computed the original ballistic on a new CT scan acquisition. A new delineation was done on the prostate, bladder and rectum to determine the new displacements and define organ doses mistakes (equivalent uniform dose, average dose and dose-volume histograms).  Results:   The new CT acquisitions confirmed that bladder and rectal volumes were not constant during sessions. Some cases showed that previously validated treatment plan became unsuitable. A proposed solution is to correct dosimetries when bladder volume modifications are significant. The result is an improvement for the stability of bladder doses, D50 error is reduced by 25.3%, mean dose error by 5.1% and equivalent uniform dose error by 2.6%. For the rectum this method decreases errors by only 1%. This process can reduce the risk of mismatch between the initial scan and following treatment sessions.  Conclusion:   For the proposed method, the cone-beam CT is necessary to properly position the isocenter and to quantify bladder and rectal volume variation and deposited doses. The dosimetries are performed in the event that bladder (or rectum) volume modification limits are exceeded. To identify these limits, we have calculated that a tolerance of 10% for the equivalent uniform dose (compared to the initial value of the first dosimetry), this represents 11% of obsolete dosimetries for the bladder, and 4% for the rectum.""","""['C Voyant', 'K Biffi', 'D Leschi', 'J Briançon', 'C Lantieri']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['Ion therapy of prostate cancer: daily rectal dose reduction by application of spacer gel.', 'Online image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: How much improvement can we expect?

In this study, in order to determine whether piceatannol inhibits the lung metastasis of prostate cancer cells, MAT-Ly-Lu (MLL) rat prostate cancer cells expressing luciferase were injected into the tail veins of male nude mice. The oral administration of piceatannol (20 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the accumulation of MLL cells in the lungs of these mice. In the cell culture studies, piceatannol was demonstrated to inhibit the basal and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced migration and invasion of DU145 cells, in addition to the migration of MLL, PC3 and TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells. In DU145 cells, piceatannol attenuated the secretion and messenger RNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Piceatannol increased the protein levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 in a concentration-dependent fashion. Additionally, piceatannol inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. Furthermore, piceatannol effected reductions in both basal and EGF-induced interleukin (IL)-6 secretion. An IL-6 neutralizing antibody inhibited EGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and EGF-stimulated migration of DU145 cells. Interleukin-6 treatment was also shown to enhance the secretion of uPA and VEGF, STAT3 phosphorylation and the migration of DU145 cells; these increases were suppressed by piceatannol.

Current practice (hematoxylin and eosin staining followed by dual-color immunostaining on selected cases) was compared with a protocol in which routine dual-color immunostaining was provided in all cases. In the original pathology reports, adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 87/200 (43%) patients. Small foci interpreted as putative cancers were detected with dual-color immunostaining in 14/113 patients who were originally diagnosed with a nonmalignant lesion. All of the suggested cancerous foci were independently reevaluated by 5 pathologists. A diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was assessed by consensus in 8 cases, and atypical small acinar proliferation was diagnosed in 1 case. Consensus was not reached in 5 cases. Six of the foci reclassified as cancer were of Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6, while 2 were graded as Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8. The feasibility of routine dual-color immunostaining was also tested by analyzing the time spent on microscopic assessment. Because small, atypical lesions expressing α-methylacyl coenzyme-A racemase (blue chromogen) were easy to detect using dual-color immunostaining, the microscopic analysis of dual-color immunostaining and hematoxylin-eosin staining was faster than that of hematoxylin-eosin staining alone that was later followed by dual-color immunostaining in selected cases (median 251 seconds versus 299 seconds, P < .0001).

However, the mechanisms leading to cell death are poorly understood. We here focused on changes at DNA and RNA levels after treatment with the liposomal mTHPC derivative Foslipos in vitro.  Methods:   After determination of darktoxicity, laser conditions and uptake kinetics, PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells were subjected to PDT with Foslipos, followed by assessment of cell numbers directly (TP0) or 1h (TP1), 2h (TP2), 5h (TP5) and 24h (TP24) after illumination. Nucleic acids had been extracted for evaluation of RNA amounts and integrity as well as for estimation of abasic sites as a measure for DNA damage. Furthermore, expression changes of 84 genes related to oxidative stress were investigated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   Already at TP0, the number of dead cells was significantly higher after PDT versus controls and at TP24 more than 90% of cells had been destroyed. PDT resulted in a severe damage of both RNA and DNA. Gene expression analyses revealed an impact of PDT on pathways for oxidative and metabolic stress, heat shock, proliferation and carcinogenesis, growth arrest, inflammation, DNA repair and apoptosis signaling.  Conclusions:   Mechanisms of Foslipos-mediated PDT comprise a combination of acute and delayed lethal effects in PC-3 cells. The latter may include death processes initiated by nucleic acid damage, activation of stress and growth arrest genes in combination with a reduced capability to adequately cope with oxidative toxicity. Our results will help to better understand molecular photodynamic effects.""","""['Emina Besic Gyenge', 'Seraina Hiestand', 'Susanna Graefe', 'Heinrich Walt', 'Caroline Maake']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther""","""['Effects of hypericin and a chlorin based photosensitizer alone or in combination in squamous cell carcinoma cells in the dark.', 'Schedule-dependent interaction between Doxorubicin and mTHPC-mediated photodynamic therapy in murine hepatoma in vitro and in vivo.', 'Photodynamic mechanisms induced by a combination of hypericin and a chlorin based-photosensitizer in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'The Photosensitizer Temoporfin (mTHPC) - Chemical, Pre-clinical and Clinical Developments in the Last Decade.', 'Temoporfin (Foscan®, 5,10,15,20-tetra(m-hydroxyphenyl)chlorin)--a second-generation photosensitizer.', 'π-π-Stacked Poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) Micelles Loaded with a Photosensitizer for Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Photosensitizers in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Type 1 phototherapeutic agents, part I: preparation and cancer cell viability studies of novel photolabile sulfenamides.', 'Deciphering the mechanisms of cellular uptake of engineered nanoparticles by accurate evaluation of internalization using imaging flow cytometry.']"""

Materials and methods:   A European, prospective, multicenter study enrolled men with a serum total prostate specific antigen of 2.5 to 10 ng/ml scheduled for initial biopsy. After digital rectal examination first catch urine was collected. PCA3 scores were determined using the PROGENSA(®) PCA3 assay and compared to biopsy outcome. The diagnostic accuracy of PCA3 was compared to total prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density and %free prostate specific antigen.  Results:   In 516 men the positive biopsy rate was 40%. An increasing PCA3 score corresponded with an increasing probability of a positive biopsy. The mean PCA3 score was higher in men with a positive vs a negative biopsy (69.6 vs 31.0, median 50 vs 18, p <0.0001). The PCA3 score was independent of age, total prostate specific antigen and prostate volume. The PCA3 score (cutoff of 35) had a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 76%. ROC analysis showed a significantly higher AUC for the PCA3 score vs total prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density and %free prostate specific antigen. The PCA3 score was significantly higher in men with biopsy Gleason score 7 or greater vs less than 7, greater than 33% vs 33% or fewer positive cores and significant vs indolent prostate cancer. Inclusion of PCA3 in multivariable models increased their predictive accuracy by up to 5.5%.  Conclusions:   The PROGENSA PCA3 assay can aid in guiding biopsy decisions.

We propose that this observation is the result of ascertainment bias driven by prostate specific antigen performance.  Materials and methods:   We identified 1,404 patients from the Stanford Radical Prostatectomy Database with clinical stage T1c (723) and T2 (681) disease who underwent surgery between 1988 and 2002, and underwent detailed morphometric mapping by a single pathologist. Multivariate linear regression was performed to assess for the effects of age, prostate weight and prostate specific antigen on total and high grade (Gleason grade 4/5) cancer volume and percentage of high grade disease.  Results:   In patients who underwent biopsy due to abnormal prostate specific antigen (stage T1c), prostate weight was negatively associated (p = 0.0002) with total cancer volume, volume of high grade disease and percentage of high grade disease. For patients who underwent biopsy based on abnormal digital rectal examination (stage T2) these associations were not observed.  Conclusions:   Improved prostate specific antigen performance for high grade disease results in ascertainment bias in patients with T1c disease.

Materials and methods:   This case-control analysis within the Nashville Men's Health Study included men recruited at prostate biopsy. Body morphometrics, health history and urine were collected from more than 2,000 men before biopsy. F2-isoprostanes were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry within an age matched sample of Nashville Men's Health Study participants that included 140 patients with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, 160 biopsy negative controls and 200 prostate cancer cases. Multivariable linear and logistic regression was used to determine the associations between F2-isoprostane level, and high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer.  Results:   Mean patient age was 66.9 years (SD 7.2) and 10.1% were nonwhite.

Among patients treated with radical prostatectomy, prior studies have demonstrated significantly higher biochemical progression rates with surgical delays of 6 months or greater. We determined the impact of surgical delay on radical prostatectomy outcomes specifically in low risk patients.  Materials and methods:   From our radical prostatectomy database we identified men who fulfilled the D'Amico low risk criteria (clinical stage T1c/T2a, prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml, and biopsy Gleason 6 or less). Pathological tumor features and biochemical progression rates were compared between men with and without surgical delay. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine predictors of biochemical progression.  Results:   Of 1,111 men who fulfilled the D'Amico low risk criteria, those with a surgical delay of 6 months or more were significantly older, had a higher proportion of African American men, and a lower proportion of clinical stage T2a (vs T1). A surgical delay of 6 months or more was associated with a greater risk of high grade disease at prostatectomy (p = 0.001) and biochemical progression (p = 0.04). The progression-free survival rate was significantly lower among men with a surgical delay. On multivariate analysis with prostate specific antigen and clinical stage, surgical delays of 6 months or more were significantly and independently associated with time to biochemical progression.  Conclusions:   In men who met the D'Amico low risk criteria, a surgical delay of 6 months or more was associated with significantly worse radical prostatectomy outcomes, including more pathology upgrading and a higher rate of biochemical progression.

Materials and methods:   We queried the Department of Defense Automated Central Tumor Registry for prostate cancer diagnosed in United States Air Force servicemen between 1991 and 2008 to determine incidence rates, disease risk category and treatments.  Results:   Age adjusted rates in white active duty servicemen diagnosed for the most recent period of 2005 to 2008 increased 3-fold relative to the rate in the earliest period of 1991 to 1994. A similar trend was evident in black servicemen. Relative to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results population prostate cancer rates in active duty United States Air Force men between 1995 and 2008 were significantly increased for the 2 racial groups. A significantly greater proportion of active duty servicemen than retirees (62% vs 40%) presented with low risk disease, defined as prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml, Gleason sum less than 7 and clinical stage T1a-T2a. Of those with low risk disease significantly more active duty servicemen elected curative surgery than retirees (93% vs 53%).  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer incidence rates in United States Air Force servicemen have increased with time, exceeding rates in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results population. While most cases are characterized as low risk, aggressive management is elected.""","""['Deborah J del Junco', 'Erin E Fox', 'Sharon Cooper', 'Marc Goldhagen', 'Erik Koda', 'David Rogers', 'Edith Canby-Hagino', 'Jeri Kim', 'Curtis Pettaway', 'Douglas D Boyd']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Incidence Rates of Gynecologic Cancers in the U.S. Active Duty Military Population.', 'Many young men with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screen-detected prostate cancers may be candidates for active surveillance.', 'Racial differences in prostate cancer risk remain among US servicemen with equal access to care.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer epidemiology in the United States.']"""

The study of multiple primary malignancies is also important since the association of certain malignancies may guide the search for germline alterations and environmental risk factors. We evaluated bidirectional associations between renal cell carcinoma and other primary cancers.  Materials and methods:   We studied 8,030 patients with renal cell carcinoma based on the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. The SIR of second cancer was calculated by comparing it to the rate of first cancers. Followup was started in 1993 and continued through 2006.  Results:   A total of 677 patients had second cancers after the first renal cell carcinoma, including 89 second renal cell carcinomas. In 776 patients renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed after another primary cancer. Histology concordant renal cell carcinoma pairs showed a SIR of 31.04 and 15.15 after clear cell and total renal cell carcinoma, respectively. The highest SIR of 132.46 was noted for synchronous contralateral clear cell renal cell carcinoma. A reciprocally increased risk of renal cell carcinoma was seen after lung, breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid gland, adrenal gland and nervous system cancer as well as after melanoma and nonHodgkin's lymphoma. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma was also in excess after brain hemangioblastoma with a SIR of 70.79.  Conclusions:   High risk was found for histology concordant renal cell carcinoma pairs and contralateral renal cell carcinoma. Bidirectional associations of renal cell carcinoma with many other cancers may imply etiological sharing. von Hippel-Lindau syndrome may explain the excess of renal cell carcinoma after brain hemangioblastoma.""","""['Hao Liu', 'Kari Hemminki', 'Jan Sundquist']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Familial papillary renal cell tumors and subsequent cancers: a nationwide epidemiological study from Sweden.', 'Multiple primary malignancies in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Risk of bilateral renal cell cancer.', 'Risk factors for adult renal cell carcinoma.', 'Multiple urologic tumors in autopsy material.', 'Second malignant tumors and non-tumor causes of death for patients with localized and regional kidney cancer after diagnosis.', 'Second Primary Renal Cell Carcinoma With Nonrenal Malignancies: An Analysis of 118 Cases and a Review of Literature.', 'Second Primary Cancers After Kidney Cancers, and Kidney Cancers as Second Primary Cancers.', 'Bladder and upper urinary tract cancers as first and second primary cancers.', 'Rate differences between first and second primary cancers may outline immune dysfunction as a key risk factor.']"""

NASP has two splice variants: tNASP and sNASP. Only cancer, germ, transformed, and embryonic cells have a high level of expression of the tNASP splice variant. We examined the consequences of tNASP depletion for prostate cancer PC-3 cells.  Methods:   tNASP was depleted from prostate cancer PC-3 cells, cervical cancer HeLa cells, and prostate epithelial PWR-1E cells using lentivirus expression of tNASP shRNA. Cell cycle changes were studied by proliferation assay with CFSE labeling and double thymidine synchronization. Gene expression profiles were detected using RT(2)Profiler PCR Array, Western and Northern blotting.  Results:   PC-3 and HeLa cells showed inhibited proliferation, increased levels of cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor p21 protein and apoptosis, whereas non-tumorigenic PWR-1E cells did not. All three cell types showed decreased levels of HSPA2. Supporting in vitro experiments demonstrated that tNASP, but not sNASP is required for activation of HSPA2.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that PC-3 and HeLa cancer cells require tNASP to maintain high levels of HSPA2 activity and therefore viability, while PWR-1E cells are unaffected by tNASP depletion. These different cellular responses most likely arise from changes in the interaction between tNASP and HSPA2 and disturbed tNASP chaperoning of linker histones. This study has demonstrated that tNASP is critical for the survival of prostate cancer cells and suggests that targeting tNASP expression can lead to a new approach for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Oleg M Alekseev', 'Richard T Richardson', 'James K Tsuruta', ""Michael G O'Rand""]""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Reprod Biol Endocrinol""","""['Downregulation of tNASP inhibits proliferation through regulating cell cycle-related proteins and inactive ERK/MAPK signal pathway in renal cell carcinoma cells.', 'Overexpression of the Linker histone-binding protein tNASP affects progression through the cell cycle.', 'Linker histones stimulate HSPA2 ATPase activity through NASP binding and inhibit CDC2/Cyclin B1 complex formation during meiosis in the mouse.', 'Association of NASP with HSP90 in mouse spermatogenic cells: stimulation of ATPase activity and transport of linker histones into nuclei.', 'Characterization of the histone H1-binding protein, NASP, as a cell cycle-regulated somatic protein.', 'SRSF10 is essential for progenitor spermatogonia expansion by regulating alternative splicing.', 'Histone Chaperone Nrp1 Mutation Affects the Acetylation of H3K56 in Tetrahymena thermophila.', 'ZFP207 sustains pluripotency by coordinating OCT4 stability, alternative splicing and RNA export.', 'Distinct histone H3-H4 binding modes of sNASP reveal the basis for cooperation and competition of histone chaperones.', 'Valerian and valeric acid inhibit growth of breast cancer cells possibly by mediating epigenetic modifications.']"""

In this study, the interaction of degarelix with human cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes was investigated in vitro. Inhibition of CYP450 was performed in human liver microsomes using documented marker substrates for the CYP450 isozymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1. The inhibitory effects on selected P450 enzyme activities were investigated with degarelix concentrations representing the range of 2-200 times of expected clinical concentrations. No inhibition of any isozyme-catalysed biotransformations studied was detected. Induction of CYP450 enzyme activity by degarelix was investigated using primary human hepatocytes. Cryopreserved plateable hepatocytes and fresh hepatocytes in culture were treated for two-three consecutive days with degarelix at concentrations of 0.1, 1.0 and 10 μM. The cultured hepatocytes were also treated with three prototypical CYP450 inducers: omeprazole, phenobarbital and rifampin as positive controls for CYP450 enzyme induction. No induction of the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isozymes was observed. Degarelix appears to be a poor substrate of the CYP450 enzyme system, and the in vitro results indicate that the interaction between CYP450 and degarelix is low.

However, the number of GnRH receptors on cancer cells is limited and they desensitize under continuous hormone treatment. A possible approach to increase the receptor mediated tumor targeting and consequently the cytostatic effect of the bioconjugates would be the attachment of more than one chemotherapeutic agent to one GnRH-III molecule. Here we report on the design, synthesis and biochemical characterization of multifunctional bioconjugates containing GnRH-III as a targeting moiety and daunorubicin as a chemotherapeutic agent. Two different drug design approaches were pursued. The first one was based on the bifunctional [(4)Lys]-GnRH-III (Glp-His-Trp-Lys-His-Asp-Trp-Lys-Pro-Gly-NH(2)) containing two lysine residues in positions 4 and 8, whose ε-amino groups were used for the coupling of daunorubicin. In the second drug design, the native GnRH-III (Glp-His-Trp-Ser-His-Asp-Trp-Lys-Pro-Gly-NH(2)) was used as a scaffold; an additional lysine residue was coupled to the ϵ-amino group of (8) Lys in order to generate two free amino groups available for conjugation of daunorubicin.

New targeted therapy is required if survival in these cases is to improve. The profile of E-, P- and N-cadherins in ovarian cancer and its association with survival remain poorly understood. Reduced expression of E-cadherin in prostate cancer associated with increase in the expression of N- and P-cadherins is described as cadherin switch. We hypothesised that there is a switch in the expression of cadherins that regulates the behaviour of HGSC and possibly its outcome. To identify the stages of the cadherin switch in HGSC, we studied the immunoexpression of E-, P- and N-cadherins in a cohort of 177 cases of HGSC. High expression of P-cadherin was associated with poor patient survival and was significantly higher in stage 2 disease when compared with stage 1 and stage 3 disease (P = 0.033). In contrast, loss of E-cadherin was observed in stage 3 HGSC when compared with other stages (P = 0.050). E-, P- and N- cadherin expressions were significantly associated with disease outcome when assessed individually and in various combinations with an interesting profile. Our results indicate that the cadherin switch alters through progression of HGSC. The profile of combined cadherin expressions in association with survival raises expectations in targeted therapy.""","""['Livia Quattrocchi', 'Andrew R Green', 'Stewart Martin', 'Lindy Durrant', 'Suha Deen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['E-Cadherin Expression in Relation to Clinicopathological Parameters and Survival of Patients with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'A Keratin 7 and E-Cadherin Signature Is Highly Predictive of Tubo-Ovarian High-Grade Serous Carcinoma Prognosis.', 'High-grade ovarian serous carcinomas: Significant correlation of histologic patterns with IMP3 and E-Cadherin predicting disease recurrence and survival.', 'Outcomes of Non-High Grade Serous Carcinoma after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Advanced-Stage Ovarian Cancer: Single-Institution Experience.', 'Current and Emerging Methods for Ovarian Cancer Screening and Diagnostics: A Comprehensive Review.', 'The association of Wnt-signalling and EMT markers with clinical characteristics in women with endometrial cancer.', 'E-Cadherin Expression in Relation to Clinicopathological Parameters and Survival of Patients with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'High N-Cadherin Protein Expression in Ovarian Cancer Predicts Poor Survival and Triggers Cell Invasion.', 'Dual role of E-cadherin in cancer cells.', 'Mucinous, endometrioid, and serous ovarian cancers with peritoneal dissemination are potent candidates for P-cadherin targeted therapy: a retrospective cohort study.']"""

Also, tt was a significant variable predicting PSA by a nonlinear law and different clusters of the patient population were assessed by the different constants of proportionality. As a theory, we explain the nonlinear relation of tt in predicting PSA as follows: (a) the number of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells increases as tumor volume and PSA serum levels rise, (b) the prevalence of androgen-independent cells producing a substance which inhibits serum LH, and (c) as a result lower levels of serum tt are detected.""","""['Antonio B Porcaro', 'Aldo Petrozziello', 'Filippo Migliorini', 'Vincenzo Lacola', 'Mario Romano', 'Teodoro Sava', 'Claudio Ghimenton', 'Beatrice Caruso', 'Stefano Zecchini Antoniolli', 'Emanuele Rubilotta', 'Carmelo Monaco', 'Luigi Comunale']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Investigative clinical study on prostate cancer part IX and X: estradiol and the pituitary-testicular-prostate axis at the time of initial diagnosis and subsequent cluster selection of the patient population after radical prostatectomy.', 'Investigative clinical study on prostate cancer part VIII: prolactin hormone and the pituitary-testicular-prostate axis at the time of initial diagnosis and subsequent cluster selection of the patient population after radical prostatectomy.', 'Investigative clinical study on prostate cancer part VI: Follicle-stimulating hormone and the pituitary-testicular-prostate axis at the time of initial diagnosis and subsequent cluster selection of the patient population.', 'Prognostic value of serum markers for prostate cancer.', 'The incidence of the variability of the free PSA/total PSA ratio on the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   A total of 1800 men aged 50-69 years old participated in an Internet-based, computer-assisted questionnaire survey. The subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (n = 900) was provided with information about the procedure, detection rate, and mortality-reducing effects of PSA screening. Additional information was given to group 2 (n = 900), including the possibility of false-positive or false-negative results, the risks of close examination, and the possibility of overdiagnoses. The willingness to pay (WTP) was assessed using a double-bound dichotomous choice method.  Results:   The average WTP was significantly greater in group 1 than in group 2 ($31.1 vs $25.1, P < .01). Weibull regression analysis showed that patients with a history of receiving PSA screening or with greater incomes had a significantly greater WTP.

When combined together, the predictive power is greater than any single factor. It now appears that the most powerful tool in this regard is the nomogram because it considers the various factors as continuous variables.  Materials and methods:   The original postoperative nomogram was developed in 1999 and modified and updated in 2005. A slightly modified version was published in 2009.

From plots of the calibration curves in each nomogram, the nomogram underestimated the actual 10-year biochemical recurrence risk in our patient population.  Conclusions:   Nomograms dynamically incorporate various risk factors and account for their interrelationships.

Studies have shown that PSA is negatively associated with obesity as a result of hemodilution or metabolic effect. Hemodilution could be the main reason for low PSA levels in obese men. However, the intrinsic metabolic effects such as insulin resistance (IR) or metabolic syndrome (MS) on PSA level have not been clearly evaluated although obesity is closely tied to MS and IR. We regarded MS and IR as the pathophysiological cornerstone of metabolic disorder in obesity and analyzed the relationships among MS, IR, and PSA levels, and plasma volume by using the concept of PSA mass, the total circulating PSA protein. PSA mass did not change depending on the severity of the obesity, MS or IR. Even the group with both MS and IR, which could be the most metabolically disturbed in this study, did not have different PSA mass, comparing with the group without any MS or IR. Thus, the decline in PSA level in men with MS or IR can be also explained by increased plasma volume other than any intrinsic metabolic effects.  Objective:   • To investigate the detailed mechanism of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline in metabolic syndrome (MS) and insulin resistance (IR), which lowers the predictive value of the PSA test, we examined the effect of haemodilution and the possibility of an intrinsic metabolic effect.  Patients and methods:   • We analysed 28,315 men who underwent routine check-ups. We compared the age-adjusted mean PSA levels in subjects with and without MS before and after adjusting or stratifying the plasma volume. We analysed changes in PSA level, plasma volume and PSA mass according to obesity grade, number of MS components, IR severity and diagnosis of MS, IR or both using an analysis of covariance.  Results:   • The PSA levels were lower in the group with MS than in the group without MS (P= 0.001), but this difference disappeared after adjusting or stratifying the plasma volume (P > 0.05 for all). The PSA levels decreased, plasma volume increased, and PSA mass did not change as the number of MS components increased (P= 0.002, P < 0.001, P= 0.55, respectively) or the IR severity increased (P= 0.001, P < 0.001, P= 0.34, respectively). • Similarly, PSA levels were lower, plasma volumes were higher and PSA masses were the same in subjects with MS (P= 0.002, P < 0.001, P= 0.10, respectively), IR (P= 0.018, P < 0.001, P= 0.94, respectively), or both (P= 0.003, P < 0.001, P= 0.86, respectively) than in subjects without those conditions.  Conclusion:   • The PSA decline in MS and IR may result simply from a haemodilution effect and be unrelated to intrinsic metabolic disturbances. For this reason, PSA levels could be underestimated in patients with MS or IR because of haemodilution.""","""['Ho-Chun Choi', 'Jin-Ho Park', 'Be-Long Cho', 'Ki-Young Son', 'Youk-Jin Yoo', 'Hyuk-Tae Kwon']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Circulating adiponectin levels associate with inflammatory markers, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome independent of obesity.', 'Obesity and screening PSA levels among men undergoing an annual physical exam.', 'Adiponectin as a biomarker of clinical manifestation of metabolic syndrome.', 'Visfatin in overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases: a meta-analysis and systemic review.', 'The role of metabolic syndrome in heart failure.', 'Association of TyG index with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in American men: results from NHANES, 2003-2010.', 'The association of pathogenic factors of metabolic syndrome on serum prostate-specific antigen levels: a pilot study.', 'Obesity inversely correlates with prostate-specific antigen levels in a population with normal screening results of prostate cancer in northwestern China.', 'The Effect of Different Metabolic Syndrome: Definitions on the Relationship Between Metabolic Syndrome and LUTS in Men With Benign Prostatic Enlargement.', 'The likelihood of having a serum PSA level of ≥2.5 ng/mL according to the degree of fatty liver disease in a screened population.']"""

Objective:   • To assess the 2010 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for prostate cancer, which recommend a pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) at radical prostatectomy in all individuals with a nomogram-predicted lymph node invasion (LNI) risk of >7%.  Patients and methods:   • We focused on 1520 patients treated with radical prostatectomy and PLND, between 2006 and 2010, at a single European institution. We examined the ability of the EAU proposed threshold to correctly predict histologically confirmed LNI. Moreover, we tested the ability of a range of nomogram thresholds between 1 and 14% to correctly predict histologically confirmed LNI. Finally, we externally validated the EAU PLND guideline nomogram.  Results:   • Overall, 10.6% of patients had LNI. The use of the 7% limit would have allowed the avoidance of 49% of PLNDs, at the cost of missing 11% of patients with LNI. The use of thresholds of 6% and 8% would have allowed the avoidance of respectively 46% and 52% of PLNDs, at the cost of missing respectively 9% and 11% of patients with LNI. Overall, the accuracy of the EAU guideline nomogram according to the receiver operating characteristics derived area under curve was 81%  Conclusion:   • Our observations indicate that the EAU guideline nomogram is highly accurate.

The PCA3 assay has shown significant potential amongst the initial studies carried out in Western countries. This assay performed in line with previous studies. We have shown this marker to perform independent of prostatic volume and have identified potential indications for its use in our setting. However, we have not observed the PCA3 assay to outperform the PSA level across the risk spectrum.  Objectives:   • To evaluate the investigational role, ideal threshold and indications of the Prostate CAncer gene 3 (PCA3) assay in a South African context. • To better define the universality of the above marker since this is the pioneer study on the continent of Africa.  Patients and methods:   • We prospectively evaluated 105 consecutive South African men referred for a prostate biopsy at two tertiary centres in the capital city, Pretoria. • Sequentially, PSA levels and post DRE urine samples were taken within 24 h before prostate biopsy. • The urine specimen was tested using the PROGENSA™ PCA3 assay and a score was generated as (PCA3 mRNA/PSA mRNA) × 1000. • The performance of this assay in predicting biopsy outcome was assessed, and compared with that of serum PSA.  Results:   • Median patient age was 67 years with a positive biopsy incidence of 42.9%. • The higher the PCA3 score the greater the probability of a positive biopsy (P = 0.003). • This score performed independently of prostatic volume (P = 0.3889) or the presence of a concurrent primary malignancy (P = 0.804). • A threshold of 60 revealed a positive predictive value of 60% with an odds ratio of 4, whereas setting a limit of 35 revealed a positive predictive value of 54% and odds ratio of 3.5. • Using receiver operating characteristics for overall performance comparison, the PSA level (area under the curve 0.844) performed better than the PCA3 score (area under the curve 0.705).  Conclusion:   • PCA3 assay has shown consistency and performed in line with previous studies but it did not surpass serum PSA in this population. • A PCA3 assay threshold of 60 performed better than the conventional limit of 35. • This assay may have a potential niche in a certain subset of South African men that includes patients with larger glands, previous negative biopsies and altered baseline PSA levels.""","""['Ahmed Adam', 'Matthys J Engelbrecht', 'Maria S Bornman', 'Samuel O Manda', 'Evelyn Moshokoa', 'Rasmi A Feilat']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate can improve the predictive value of the urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 test in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and a previous negative biopsy.', 'PCA3 molecular urine assay for prostate cancer in men undergoing repeat biopsy.', 'A comparative performance analysis of total prostate-specific antigen, percentage free prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific antigen velocity and urinary prostate cancer gene 3 in the first, second and third repeat prostate biopsy.', 'Optimising repeat prostate biopsy decisions and procedures.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNAs and their potential impact on diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in prostate cancer: racial, ethnic, and geographical considerations.', 'Diagnosis accuracy of PCA3 level in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'Prostate Cancer Diagnosis Using Urine Sediment Analysis-Based α-Methylacyl-CoA Racemase Score: A Single-Center Experience.', 'Disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates: Solvable or not?', 'Evaluation of prostate cancer antigen 3 for detecting prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Objective:   • To estimate the magnitude of increase in prostate cancer cases diagnosed in Canada by the year 2021.  Patients and methods:   • Using available evidence, the number of new prostate cancer cases expected in 2021 was estimated based on the effects of four major factors: aging population, increased prevalence of PSA screening, lowered PSA cutoff to recommend biopsy, and improved sensitivity of prostate biopsy. • These effects were combined with population data from Statistics Canada and the Canadian Cancer Statistics to estimate new prostate cancer cases.  Results:   • The two factors with the largest effect on estimated new prostate cancers in 2021 compared with 2009 were: aging population (increase of 39%), and lowering the PSA threshold to 2.6 ng/mL before prostate biopsy (increase of 200%). • In the 'best-case' scenario, the number of new prostate cancers will only be affected by the aging population and will increase by 39% to 35,121 new cases. • In the 'most-likely' scenario, all four factors will have a combined effect to increase new cases by 201% to 76,379.  Conclusions:   • The aging population and lowering PSA threshold to 2.6 ng/mL have the most significant impact on estimated new prostate cancer cases in 2021.

When partial nephrectomy is considered, the procedure can be safely approached laparoscopically, either pure or robot assisted, in experienced hands. Laparo-endoscopic single site (LESS) surgery is a novel approach for partial nephrectomies in well selected cases. In this video, we present our experience with the LESS retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy using the Gelpoint device.  Material and methods:   A 63 year old male patient with a BMI of 31, and a history of a T1c prostate cancer, had a 1.5 cm right posterior lower pole renal enhancing mass discovered incidentally on a three phase CT scan. With the patient under general anesthesia, and in a full flank position, a LESS retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy was performed using a 3 cm transverse incision below the tip of the 12th rib. The following instruments and devices were used: A gelpoint device for single incision port of entry, one 10 mm and two 5 mm trocars used through the gelpoint, one 5 mm Olympus HD endoeye flexible tip camera, one roticulator scissors, and one articulating graspers.  Results:   Operative time, EBL, and hospital stay were 1 hour, 5 ml, and 23 hours, respectively. The pathology result confirmed a benign hemorrhagic cystic mass. The visual analog scale (0-10) for pain at recovery, 6 hours post op, and 23 hours post op was 5, 3, and 1 point, respectively. The patient tolerated clear liquids and regular diet at 6 and 16 hours, after the procedure. At one month of follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic and practically scarless.  Conclusions:   LESS retroperitoneal partial nephrectomy is safe and feasible in selected cases such as small exophytic posterior renal masses.

Therefore, curative strategy should include targeted elimination of AR protein. Since AR binds to calmodulin (CaM), and since CaM-binding proteins are targets of calpain (Cpn)-mediated proteolysis, we studied the role of CaM and Cpn in AR breakdown in prostate cancer cells. Whereas the treatment of prostate cancer cells individually with anti-CaM drug or calcimycin, which increases intracellular Ca(++) and activates Cpn, led to minimal AR breakdown, combined treatment led to a precipitous decrease in AR protein levels. This decrease in AR protein occurred without noticeable changes in AR mRNA levels, suggesting an increase in AR protein turnover rather than inhibition of AR mRNA expression. Thus, CaM inactivation seems to sensitize AR to Cpn-mediated breakdown in prostate cancer cells. Consistent with this possibility, purified recombinant human AR (rhAR) underwent proteolysis in the presence of purified Cpn, and the addition of purified CaM to the incubation blocked rhAR proteolysis. Together, these observations demonstrate that AR is a Cpn target and AR-bound CaM plays an important role in protecting AR from Cpn-mediated breakdown in prostate cancer cells. These observations raise an intriguing possibility that anti-CaM drugs in combination with Cpn-activating agents may offer a curative strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer, which relies on AR for growth and survival.""","""['Arun Sivanandam', 'Shalini Murthy', 'Kannagi Chinnakannu', 'V Uma Bai', 'Sahn-Ho Kim', 'Evelyn R Barrack', 'Mani Menon', 'G Prem-Veer Reddy']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Calmodulin-androgen receptor (AR) interaction: calcium-dependent, calpain-mediated breakdown of AR in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Calpain-mediated androgen receptor breakdown in apoptotic prostate cancer cells.', 'Physical and functional interaction of androgen receptor with calmodulin in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulatory processes affecting androgen receptor expression, stability, and function: potential targets to treat hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of prostate cancer cell survival after inhibition of AR expression.', 'The brain acid-soluble protein 1 (BASP1) interferes with the oncogenic capacity of MYC and its binding to calmodulin.', 'Inhibiting eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis.', 'Alteration of Androgen Receptor Protein Stability by Triptolide in LNCaP Cells.', 'Fatty Acids and Calcium Regulation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of the protein expression of calpain-1, calpain-2, calpastatin and calmodulin between gastric cancer and normal gastric mucosa.']"""

Rates of MBC in Africa are more variable than in the U.S., therefore, understanding the risk factors involved in a population like Egypt can clarify the nature of MBC. The polyglutamine tract (QT) is a variable region of the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear receptor which is important in modulating androgen actions and generally inhibits growth in breast tissue. It is hypothesized that a long QT results in weaker AR activity over the lifetime, resulting in less AR mediated control over cellular division and higher risk of MBC. As a corollary, we expect to see a distribution skewed toward longer QTs in MBC patients compared to controls and overall relatively longer QT's in populations with higher rates of MBC. This study aimed to investigate for the first time the distribution of AR QT lengths among MBC patients in Egypt. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 44 Egyptian MBC patients were analyzed for this polymorphism. Amplification followed by fragment length analysis revealed QT length. For the control series, blood from 43 Egyptian males without a family or personal history of breast or prostate cancers was collected and analyzed similarly. There was no significant difference between patients and controls with respect to mean QT length (P = 0.84; means were 19.5 ± 2.8 and 19.3 ± 4.2, for patients and controls, respectively). Though, short QT lengths were more prevalent among controls (14.0%), but almost absent in cases (2.3%). Although the mean lengths were not different in cases and controls, the near absence of short tracts in cases suggests a possible protective effect of very short QT lengths against MBC. In populations in which there is variable incidence of MBC by region, investigations of the distribution of AR QT lengths are warranted to further delineate its role as a risk factor in MBC.""","""['Samuel F Gilbert', 'Amr S Soliman', 'Maria Iniesta', 'Mohab Eissa', 'Ahmed Hablas', 'Ibrahim A Seifeldin', 'Ashley Strahley', 'Mousumi Banerjee', 'Sofia D Merajver']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Long CAG repeat sequence and protein expression of androgen receptor considered as prognostic indicators in male breast carcinoma.', 'Clinical profile, BRCA2 expression, and the androgen receptor CAG repeat region in Egyptian and Moroccan male breast cancer patients.', 'Androgen receptor gene alterations in Finnish male breast cancer.', 'The biology of male breast cancer.', 'Role of the androgen receptor CAG repeat polymorphism in prostate cancer, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.', 'Long CAG repeat sequence and protein expression of androgen receptor considered as prognostic indicators in male breast carcinoma.', 'Microsatellites in the estrogen receptor (ESR1, ESR2) and androgen receptor (AR) genes and breast cancer risk in African American and Nigerian women.', 'Clinical profile, BRCA2 expression, and the androgen receptor CAG repeat region in Egyptian and Moroccan male breast cancer patients.']"""

The transcription factor Runx2 plays an important role in bone formation and prostate cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Here we showed that the forkhead box O (FOXO1) protein, a key downstream effector of the tumor suppressor PTEN, inhibits the transcriptional activity of Runx2 in prostate cancer cells. This inhibition was enhanced by PTEN but diminished by active Akt. FOXO1 bound to Runx2 in vitro and in vivo and suppressed Runx2's activity independent of its transcriptional function. FOXO1 inhibited Runx2-promoted migration of prostate cancer cells, whereas silencing of endogenous FOXO1 enhanced prostate cancer cell migration in a Runx2-dependent manner. Forced expression of FOXO1 also inhibited Runx2-promoted prostate cancer cell invasion. Finally, we found that expression of PTEN and the level of FOXO1 in the nucleus is inversely correlated with expression of Runx2 in a cohort of prostate cancer specimens from patients with lymph node and bone metastasis. These data reveal FOXO1 as a critical negative regulator of Runx2 in prostate cancer cells. Inactivation of FOXO1 due to frequent loss of PTEN in prostate cancer cells may leave the oncogenic activities of Runx2 unchecked, thereby driving promiscuous expression of Runx2 target genes involved in cell migration and invasion and favoring prostate cancer progression.""","""['Haijun Zhang', 'Yunqian Pan', 'Li Zheng', 'Chungyoul Choe', 'Bruce Lindgren', 'Eric D Jensen', 'Jennifer J Westendorf', 'Liang Cheng', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: molecular insights into bone metastasis.', 'Inhibition of FOXO1/3 promotes vascular calcification.', 'A transcription-independent function of FOXO1 in inhibition of androgen-independent activation of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Foxo1 mediates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/insulin regulation of osteocalcin expression by antagonizing Runx2 in osteoblasts.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'RUNX2 and Osteosarcoma.', 'The discrete roles of individual FOXO transcription factor family members in B-cell malignancies.', 'A novel panel of clinically relevant miRNAs signature accurately differentiates oral cancer from normal mucosa.', 'HYOU1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via the PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 feedback loop in bladder cancer.', 'Decreased FOXO1 Expression Is Correlated with Poor Prognosis in Myelodysplastic Syndromes.', 'Identification of the hsa_circ_0039466/miR-96-5p/FOXO1 regulatory network in hepatocellular carcinoma by whole-transcriptome analysis.']"""

A total of 1338 left sided, advanced colorectal adenoma cases and 1503 matched controls free of left-sided polyps were included in the study. Using DNA extracted from blood, 3144 tag SNPs in 149 DNA repair genes were successfully genotyped. Among Caucasians, 30 SNPs were associated with adenoma risk at P < 0.01, with four SNPs remaining significant after gene-based adjustment for multiple testing. The most significant finding was for a non-synonymous SNP (rs9350) in Exonuclease-1 (EXO1) [odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-1.51, P = 0.001)], which was predicted to be damaging using bioinformatics methods.

A patient with localized, low risk or intermediate risk prostate cancer who is diagnosed at an early age and receives one of these treatments has only an approximately 50% chance of maintaining an undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, good spontaneous erections, and total continence by 5 years after treatment.  Objective:   This article discusses transrectal high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment of localized prostate cancer using the Sonablate 500 (Focus Surgery, Indianapolis, IN, USA) device, which the author has adopted in favor of the Ablatherm (EDAP, TMS S. A., Lyons, France) device, the other HIFU device approved for use in Canada.  Method:   Characteristics of the ideal prostate cancer include stage T1-T2b, less than 40 cc in size, and with an anterior-posterior dimension of up to 35 mm high. The anterior zone of the prostate is treated before the posterior zone. The procedure involves 2 to 3 second bursts of ultrasound energy, followed by 3 second cooling cycles. In each treatment lesion, the physician achieves a temperature of 100 C at the focal point. The device allows for real-time visualization of tissue response following the delivery of ultrasound energy.  Conclusion:   HIFU is a minimally invasive, outpatient treatment for localized prostate cancer that provides similar short term and medium term cure rates and considerably less morbidity and side effects than other treatments. Although the effectiveness of HIFU has not yet been demonstrated in large, long term studies, this treatment option should be discussed with patients who have just been diagnosed with low risk or intermediate risk prostate cancer and desire aggressive, noninvasive, curative therapy, with potentially a lower incidence of side effects compared to conventional therapy.""","""['Jack Barkin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Single application of high-intensity focused ultrasound as a first-line therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes.', 'Results of high intensity focused ultrasound treatment of prostate cancer: early Canadian experience at a single center.', 'High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU): a useful alternative choice in prostate cancer treatment.

Materials and methods:   Post-mortem 18-core biopsy results of men who died of unrelated causes, but were diagnosed with prostate cancer post-mortem were used to provide details on prostate biopsies and whole mount specimens. For each of the 18-core biopsies showing cancer, Gleason score, number of positive cores, location in the gland and percentage of cancer involvement were determined and correlated to final pathology. Total length of cancer tissue in a 6-core scheme was related to the length in 12 and 18-core schemes to compute correction factors. Furthermore, upgrading on extended biopsies and final pathology was evaluated.  Results:   Data from 33 autopsied men were included. The 18 and 12-core biopsies showed 192.72 mm and 143.76 mm of prostate cancer, compared to 70.80 mm with lateralized sextant biopsy, resulting in correction factors of 2.72 and 2.03 for 18 and 12-core schemes respectively.

Results:   Of the whole cohort 58.6% were presented with organ-confined disease (OCD), 10.1% had lymph node involvement (LNI), and 31.3% had locally advanced disease (LAD), while 21.2% had extraprostatic extension (ECE) and 10.1% showed seminal vesicle involvement (SVI). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the Partin Tables 1997, 2001 and 2007 was 0.732, 0.722 and 0.695 for OCD; 0.647, 0.594 and 0.577 for LAD; 0.856, 0.872 and 0.829 for LNI, respectively.  Conclusion:   All three generations of the Partin tables showed a good accuracy to predict OCD, and LNI. However, the predictive accuracy for LAD was more limited. Overall, the newer versions of the Partin tables could not exceed the version of 1997 in their predictive accuracy for the present Chinese cohort. Our results suggest caution when using newly introduced predictive tools that are not supported by population-specific accuracy tests.""","""['Wen-Jun Xiao', 'Ding-Wei Ye', 'Xu-Dong Yao', 'Shi-Lin Zhang', 'Bo Dai', 'Chao-Fu Wang', 'Jian Wang', 'Hai-Liang Zhang', 'Yi-Jun Shen', 'Yao Zhu', 'Yi-Ping Zhu', 'Guo-Hai Shi', 'Chun-Guang Ma', 'Xiao-Jian Qin', 'Guo-Wen Lin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Comparison of accuracy between the Partin tables of 1997 and 2001 to predict final pathological stage in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'The newer the better?

Methods:   LNCaP cells were treated with isochaihulactone and growth inhibition was assessed. Cell cycle profiles after isochaihulactone treatment were determined by flow cytometry. Expression levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins, caspase 9, caspase 3, and PARP were determined after isochaihulactone treatment. Signaling pathway was verified by inhibitors pre-treatment. Expression levels of early growth response gene 1 (EGR-1) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene 1 (NAG-1) were determined to investigate their role in LNCaP cell death. NAG-1 expression was knocked down by si-NAG-1 siRNA transfection. Rate of cell death and proliferation were obtained by MTT assay.  Results:   Isochaihulactone caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in LNCaP cells, which was correlated with an increase of p53 and p21 levels and downregulation of the checkpoint proteins cdc25c, cyclin B1, and cdc2.

Autoantibodies (autoAb) among others are being extensively investigated as potential substitute markers, but remain elusive. One major obstacle is the lack of a sensitive and multiplex approach for quantifying autoAb against a large panel of clinically relevant tumor-associated antigens (TAA).  Methods:   To circumvent preparation of phage lysates and purification of recombinant proteins, we identified B cell epitopes from a number of previously defined prostate cancer-associated antigens (PCAA). Peptide epitopes from cancer/testis antigen NY-ESO-1, XAGE-1b, SSX-2,4, as well as prostate cancer overexpressed antigen AMACR, p90 autoantigen, and LEDGF were then conjugated with seroMAP microspheres to allow multiplex measurement of autoAb present in serum samples. Moreover, simultaneous quantification of autoAb plus total PSA was achieved in one reaction, and termed the ""A+PSA"" assay.  Results:   Peptide epitopes from the above 6 PCAA were identified and confirmed that autoAb against these peptide epitopes reacted specifically with the full-length protein. A pilot study was conducted with the A+PSA assay using pre-surgery sera from 131 biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer patients and 121 benign prostatic hyperplasia and/or prostatitis patients. A logistic regression-based A+PSA index was found to enhance sensitivities and specificities over PSA alone in distinguishing prostate cancer from nonmalignant cases. The A+PSA index also reduced false positive rate and improved the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve.

In this article, we propose a powerful kernel machine based test. Specifically, our test is based on a garrote kernel method and is constructed as a score test. Here, the term garrote refers to an extra nonnegative parameter that is multiplied to the covariate of interest so that our score test can be formulated in terms of this nonnegative parameter. A key feature of the proposed test is that it is flexible and developed for both parametric and nonparametric models within a unified framework, and is more powerful than the standard test by accounting for the correlation among genes and hence often uses a much smaller degrees of freedom.

How this signaling governs EMT and whether specific kinases respond to particular EMT effectors remain unclear. This study found specific increases in Mdm2 and vimentin rather than the coregulation of an array of EMT marker proteins in response to HGF-induced EMT in DU145 prostate cancer cells. Importantly, it was further found that diosgenin abrogated HGF-induced DU145 cell scattering and invasion. Moreover, diosgenin effectively inhibited the HGF-induced increases in Mdm2 and vimentin by down-regulating phosphorylated Akt and mTOR.

Ligation of GRP78 with α₂ M also upregulates TFII-I, which binds to the GRP78 promoter and enhances GRP78 synthesis. In addition to its transcriptional functions, cytosolic TFII-I regulates agonist-induced Ca(2+) entry. In this study we show that down regulation of TFII-I gene expression by RNAi profoundly impairs its cell surface expression and anti-apoptotic signaling as measured by significant reduction of GRP78, Bcl-2, and cyclin D1 in 1-Ln and DU-145 human prostate cancer cells stimulated with α₂ M. In contrast, this treatment significantly increases levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins p53, p27, Bax, and Bak and causes DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, down regulation of TFII-I expression activates agonist-induced Ca(2+) entry. In plasma membrane lysates p-PLCγ1, TRPC3, GRP78, MTJ1, and caveolin co-immunoprecipitate with TFII-I suggesting multimeric complexes of these proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, down regulating TFII-I, MTJ1, or GRP78 expression by RNAi greatly attenuates cell surface expression of TFII-I.

Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, on the other hand, has also been associated with oncogenic transformation in most cancer cells. However, a possible link between ploidy and ROS is largely unexplored. Here we have examined the role of ROS in the tumorigenicity of polyploid cells. We show that polyploid prostate and mammary epithelial cells contain higher levels of ROS due to their higher mitochondrial contents. ROS levels and mitochondrial mass are also higher in dihydrocytochalasin B (DCB)-induced polyploid cells, suggesting that higher levels of ROS observed in polyploid cell can occur due to cytokinesis failure. Interestingly, polyploid cells were more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the antioxidant, N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), than control diploid cells. Treatment of polyploid/diploid cells with NAC led to the selective elimination of polyploid cells over time and abrogated the tumorigenicity of polyploid cells. This effect was partially mediated via the Akt signaling pathway. We next explored a possible role for ROS in promoting chromosomal instability by analyzing the effects of ROS on the mitotic stage of the cell cycle. Enhancing ROS levels by treating cells with hydrogen peroxide delayed not only entry into and but also exit from mitosis. Furthermore, increasing ROS levels significantly increased taxol resistance. Our results indicated that increased ROS in polyploid cells can contribute to tumorigenicity and highlight the therapeutic potential of antioxidants by selectively targeting the tumorigenic polyploid cells and by reversing taxol resistance.""","""['Meejeon Roh', 'Riet van der Meer', 'Sarki A Abdulkadir']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['A role for polyploidy in the tumorigenicity of Pim-1-expressing human prostate and mammary epithelial cells.', 'N-acetylcysteine modulates the cytotoxic effects of Paclitaxel.', 'The cytoprotective effect of N-acetyl-L-cysteine against ROS-induced cytotoxicity is independent of its ability to enhance glutathione synthesis.', 'Reactive Oxygen Species and the Aging Eye: Specific Role of Metabolically Active Mitochondria in Maintaining Lens Function and in the Initiation of the Oxidation-Induced Maturity Onset Cataract--A Novel Platform of Mitochondria-Targeted Antioxidants With Broad Therapeutic Potential for Redox Regulation and Detoxification of Oxidants in Eye Diseases.', 'Effect of stress-induced polyploidy on melanoma reprogramming and therapy resistance.', 'The establishment of mitotic errors-driven senescence depends on autophagy.', 'Comparative regulomics supports pervasive selection on gene dosage following whole genome duplication.', 'Roles of cell fusion, hybridization and polyploid cell formation in cancer metastasis.', 'Metabolism-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage selectively trigger genome instability in polyploid fungal cells.', 'NGF reprograms metastatic melanoma to a bipotent glial-melanocyte neural crest-like precursor.']"""

However, no report exist on GA inhibited invasion and migration of human prostate cancer cells. We investigated the effects of migration and invasion in GA-treated PC-3 human prostate cancer cells with a series of in vitro experiments. Boyden chamber transwell assay was used to examine the migration and invasion of PC-3 cells. Western blotting, real-time PCR and gelatin zymography were used for determining the protein levels, gene expression and enzyme activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 in vitro. Results indicated that GA inhibited the invasion and migration of PC-3 cells and these effects are dose-dependent. GA inhibited the protein levels of MMP-2 and -9, son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), protein kinase C (PKC) and nuclear factor-κ B (NF-κB) p65, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38, p-AKT (Thr308) and p-AKT (Ser473), but it promoted the levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT in PC-3 cells. GA also reduced the enzyme activities of MMP-2 and -9 in the examined cells. Moreover, the down-regulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Ras homolog gene family, member A (Rho A) mRNA expression levels, and up-regulation of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1) gene levels occurred in GA-treated PC-3 cells after 24 h treatment.

Methods:   Fifteen cases of focally calcified soft tumors including three cases of thyroid papillary carcinoma, three of breast invasive ductal carcinoma, three of prostate cancer, three of colon adenocarcincoma and three of normal lymph nodes, were selected in this study, and so were nine cases of bone and bone marrow tissue from biopsy and autopsy. Tissue samples were divided into three groups. One group was each soaked into 10% nitric acid for 24, 42 and 48 h, another group was each incubated in 1% hydrochloric acid for 1, 2 and 3 h. The other group which was not treated with acid was regarded as control. Then immunohistochemical staining was conducted in these samples for antigens as follows: ER, PR and Ki-67 in breast invasive ductal carcinoma; TTF-1 in thyroid papillary carcinoma; 34βE12 and P504s in prostate cancer; AE1/AE3, P504s and Ki-67 in colon adenocarcincoma; CD3, CD20 and Ki-67 in lymph nodes; CD3,CD20,CD68,CD235a,MPO,Ki-67,AE1/AE3 and TTF-1 in bone tissue.  Results:   After the tissues decalcificated in both acid solutions for some time, the numbers of positive cells decreased and the intensity of immunostaining became weaker, which was proportionate to time. Bone tissue was less influenced than calcified soft tissue. Different antigens showed different sensitivity to the same acid treatment. TTF-1 and Ki-67 were the two most vulnerable antigens among them; while ER, CD3 and CD20 were the least influenced. The effects of decalcification on immunostaining of one antigen were the same in different tissues.

In all, 59 patients (67%) had progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer. Nadir PSA <0.2 ng ml(-1) (lower PSA nadir) during PADT were observed in 47 patients (54%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the extent of disease on bone scan (P=0.04), lower PSA nadir following PADT (P=0.003), albumin (P=0.04) and lactate dehydrogenase (P=0.01) were independent prognostic factors for survival. OS rates in the patients with lower PSA nadir were significantly higher. Longer TTN (>9 months) identified patients with prolonged OS in both lower and higher PSA nadir groups. PSA nadir <0.2 ng ml(-1) and prolonged TTN (>9 months) following PADT might be the most important early predictors for longer survival in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis.""","""['T Sasaki', 'T Onishi', 'A Hoshina']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Cutoff value of time to prostate-specific antigen nadir is inversely correlated with disease progression in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Impact of pretreatment factors, biopsy Gleason grade volume indices and post-treatment nadir PSA on overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated with step-up hormonal therapy.', 'Undetectable level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir predicts PSA biochemical failure in local prostate cancer with delayed-combined androgen blockade.', 'Tumor markers.

Both EPE and PSM were found to be independent predictors of biochemical failure (BCF); however, only EPE was associated with metastasis and death. BCF was also more likely to be associated with cases that had non-focal EPE than focal EPE. Similarly, non-focal PSM cases had a significantly higher risk of BCF than focal cases.

Patients and methods:   In this multicenter, randomized, open-label study, patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (stage IIIB), hormone-refractory prostate cancer, or locally advanced pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned to nadroparin or to no nadroparin in addition to their standard anticancer treatment.

The patients were eligible to receive additional cycles of nadroparin (2 weeks at therapeutic dose, and 4 weeks of washout period). Outcomes were overall survival, time to progression, and major bleeding. All study outcomes were adjudicated by an independent, blinded committee.  Results:   A total of 244 patients were allocated to nadroparin, and 259 were allocated to the control group.

Methods:   Set-up corrections from 26 prostate cancer patients treated with daily IG on helical tomotherapy were used to simulate IG protocols with reduced imaging frequency, where average set-up corrections from a subset of initial IG sessions were used for subsequent fractions with no IG. Residual set-up error, the difference between the average set-up correction and the actual correction required, was used to evaluate the accuracy of each protocol. Adaptive treatment margins required to encompass these errors were calculated. Body mass index and daily bladder and rectum cross-sectional areas (CSAs) were measured, and their correlations with set-up corrections were evaluated. We also investigated the use of reduced imaging schedules to estimate changes in bladder and rectum CSAs.  Results:   As expected, residual set-up errors and adaptive treatment margins were effectively reduced with frequent imaging. For the majority of patients (81%), 10 IG sessions were sufficient to reduce residual set-up errors to within the adaptive treatment margins. Daily IG was more suitable than using a reduced IG protocol for a minority of patients (19%) with residual set-up errors that consistently exceeded the margins for >10% of fractions. These patients could be identified with 10 imaging sessions via the analysis of anatomical variations.  Conclusions:   The accuracy of modified IG protocols should be validated in the context of institutional practice regarding patient set-up and bowel/bladder preparation.""","""['Timothy P C Yeung', 'Slav Yartsev', 'George Rodrigues', 'Glenn Bauman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Evaluating the Need for Daily Image Guidance in Head and Neck Cancers Treated with Helical Tomotherapy: A Retrospective Analysis of a Large Number of Daily Imaging-based Corrections.', 'Evaluation of image-guidance strategies for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of image-guidance protocols in the treatment of head and neck cancers.', 'An assessment of action levels in imaging strategies in head and neck cancer using TomoTherapy.

The interactions between mammary epithelial cells and ECM components play a major role in mammary gland branching morphogenesis. Critical signals for mammary epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival are provided by the ECM proteins. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture was developed to establish a system that simulates several features of the breast epithelium in vivo; 3D cell culture of the spontaneously immortalized cell line, MCF10A, is a well-established model system to study breast epithelial cell biology and morphogenesis. Mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D form spheroids, acquire apicobasal polarization, and form lumens that resemble acini structures, processes that involve cell death. Using this system, we evaluated the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene PAWR (PKC apoptosis WT1 regulator; also named PAR-4, prostate apoptosis response-4) by immunofluorescence and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). A time-dependent increase in PAR-4 mRNA expression was found during the process of MCF10A acinar morphogenesis. Confocal microscopy analysis also showed that PAR-4 protein was highly expressed in the MCF10A cells inside the acini structure. During the morphogenesis of MCF10A cells in 3D cell culture, the cells within the lumen showed caspase-3 activation, indicating apoptotic activity. PAR-4 was only partially co-expressed with activated caspase-3 on these cells. Our results provide evidence, for the first time, that PAR-4 is differentially expressed during the process of MCF10A acinar morphogenesis.""","""['Simone A de Bessa Garcia', 'Michelly C Pereira', 'Maria A Nagai']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Cancer Microenviron""","""['Building bridges toward invasion: tumor promoter treatment induces a novel protein kinase C-dependent phenotype in MCF10A mammary cell acini.', 'Tightly controlled MRTF-A activity regulates epithelial differentiation during formation of mammary acini.', 'Down-regulation of the candidate tumor suppressor gene PAR-4 is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.', 'Lumen formation during mammary epithelial morphogenesis: insights from in vitro and in vivo models.', 'Application of the D492 Cell Lines to Explore Breast Morphogenesis, EMT and Cancer Progression in 3D Culture.', 'HOXB7 Overexpression Leads Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells to a Less Aggressive Phenotype.', 'Met receptor acts uniquely for survival and morphogenesis of EGFR-dependent normal mammary epithelial and cancer cells.']"""

However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the guideline recommendations and clinical practice on the use of primary androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer in Japan. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed a single-institution experience in primary combined androgen blockade (CAB) for localized prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   The study included 187 patients with T1c-T3a prostate cancer unsuitable for local definitive treatment and treated with primary CAB. Clinical outcomes, predictive factors of PSA relapse and adverse events were investigated.  Results:   The progression-free, disease-specific, and overall survival rates of all patients at 5 years were 63.0, 99.4 and 95.9%, respectively. Of the several parameters isolated as predictors of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, nadir PSA level and the percentage of positive biopsy cores (%PBC) remained as independent prognostic factors on multivariate analysis. Toxicities were mild to moderate and well tolerated.  Conclusions:   Primary CAB treatment brought initial disease control without relapse in the majority of our selected cases. The %PBC may help predict time to relapse in the pretreatment setting. The results implicate that CAB can be an option as a primary treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer unsuitable for local definitive treatment.

Intratumoral injection of an adenoviral vector capable of efficient transduction and expression of Glipr1 (AdGlipr1) yielded promising therapeutic results in an orthotopic, metastatic mouse model of PCa. AdGlipr1-transduced macrophages (Mφ/Glipr1) generated greater surface expression of CD40, CD80 and major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and greater production of interleukin 12 (IL-12) and IL-6 in vitro than control macrophages did. Mechanistic analysis indicated that increased production of IL-12 in Mφ/Glipr1 depends on activation of the p38 signaling cascade. Mφ/Glipr1 injected into orthotopic 178-2BMA tumors in vivo resulted in significantly suppressed prostate tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastases and longer survival relative to those observed in control-treated mice. Furthermore, these preclinical data indicate the generation of systemic natural killer cell activity and tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses.

One of the most troublesome aspects of prostate cancer is that androgen dependent prostate cancer inevitably progresses to highly aggressive, life threatening castration resistant prostate cancer after androgen ablation therapy. To our knowledge it remains unknown how sensitivity to docetaxel changes during progression to more aggressive castration resistant prostate cancer under androgen ablation.  Materials and methods:   We investigated sensitivity to docetaxel and phosphorylated Akt status in C4-2 and C4-2AT6 cells established at our institution.  Results:   C4-2AT6 cells established under androgen ablation conditions for 6 months showed significantly higher resistance to docetaxel than C4-2 cells in vivo and in vitro. Resistance was accompanied by increased phosphorylated Akt. In C4-2AT6 cells phosphorylated Akt activity was significantly up-regulated by docetaxel in a dose dependent manner. After treatment with docetaxel and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt inhibitor the sensitivity of C4-2AT6 cells to docetaxel markedly increased through enhanced apoptotic death.

Copy number data from array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) and next-generation DNA sequencing is widely used to measure copy number variants. Comparison of copy number data from multiple individuals reveals recurrent variants. Typically, the interior of a recurrent CNV is examined for genes or other loci associated with a phenotype. However, in some cases, such as gene truncations and fusion genes, the target of variant lies at the boundary of the variant.  Results:   We introduce Neighborhood Breakpoint Conservation (NBC), an algorithm for identifying rearrangement breakpoints that are highly conserved at the same locus in multiple individuals. NBC detects recurrent breakpoints at varying levels of resolution, including breakpoints whose location is exactly conserved and breakpoints whose location varies within a gene. NBC also identifies pairs of recurrent breakpoints such as those that result from fusion genes. We apply NBC to aCGH data from 36 primary prostate tumors and identify 12 novel rearrangements, one of which is the well-known TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene. We also apply NBC to 227 glioblastoma tumors and predict 93 novel rearrangements which we further classify as gene truncations, germline structural variants, and fusion genes. A number of these variants involve the protein phosphatase PTPN12 suggesting that deregulation of PTPN12, via a variety of rearrangements, is common in glioblastoma.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate that NBC is useful for detection of recurrent breakpoints resulting from copy number variants or other structural variants, and in particular identifies recurrent breakpoints that result in gene truncations or fusion genes.

There is lack of agreement across studies that PSA screening significantly reduces prostate cancer mortality. In spite of these facts, the widespread use of PSA testing in the United States leads to overdetection and overtreatment of clinically indolent prostate cancer, and its associated harms of incontinence and impotence.  Discussion:   Given the inconclusive results from clinical trials and incongruent PSA screening guidelines, the decision to screen for prostate cancer with PSA testing is an uncertain one for patients and health care providers. Screening guidelines from some health organizations recommend an informed decision making (IDM) or shared decision making (SDM) approach for deciding on PSA screening. These approaches aim to empower patients to choose among the available options by making them active participants in the decision making process. By increasing involvement of patients in the clinical decision-making process, IDM/SDM places more of the responsibility for a complex decision on the patient. Research suggests, however, that patients are not well-informed of the harms and benefits associated with prostate cancer screening and are also subject to an assortment of biases, emotion, fears, and irrational thought that interferes with making an informed decision. In response, the IDM/SDM approaches can be augmented with strategies from the philosophy of libertarian paternalism (LP) to improve decision making. LP uses the insights of behavioural economics to help people better make better choices. Some of the main strategies of LP applicable to PSA decision making are a default decision rule, framing of decision aids, and timing of the decision. In this paper, we propose that applying strategies from libertarian paternalism can help with PSA screening decision-making.  Summary:   Our proposal to augment IDM and SDM approaches with libertarian paternalism strategies is intended to guide patients toward a better decision about testing while maintaining personal freedom of choice. While PSA screening remains controversial and evidence conflicting, a libertarian-paternalism influenced approach to decision making can help prevent the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer.""","""['David C Wheeler', 'Konrad M Szymanski', 'Amanda Black', 'David E Nelson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Fostering shared decision-making about prostate cancer screening among African American men patients and their primary care providers: a randomized behavioral clinical trial.', 'Impact of health literacy on shared decision making for prostate-specific antigen screening in the United States.', 'Do Men Receive Information Required for Shared Decision Making About PSA Testing?

These included differences in effective concentrations, a differential effect on androgen receptor binding, and a differential effect on xenobiotic metabolic pathway through aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent and -independent mechanism. Furthermore we determined that several other diet-derived cancer protective compounds, similar to DIM and I3C, exhibited pleiotrophic effects on signaling pathways that included proliferation, cell cycle, and nuclear receptors-mediated pathways. However, the efficacies and mechanisms of these compounds vary.

The purpose of this investigation was to estimate fracture risk among unselected community men with prostate cancer and systematically assess associations with ADT and other risk factors for fracture. In a population-based retrospective cohort study, 742 Olmsted County, MN, men with prostate cancer first diagnosed in 1990-1999 (mean age 68.2 ± 8.9 years) were followed for 6821 person-years. We estimated cumulative fracture incidence, assessed relative risk by standardized incidence ratios, and evaluated risk factors in time-to-fracture regression models. All together, 482 fractures were observed in 258 men (71 per 1000 person-years). Overall fracture risk was elevated 1.9-fold, with an absolute increase in risk of 9%. Relative to rates among community men generally, fracture risk was increased even among men not on ADT but was elevated a further 1.7-fold among ADT-treated compared with untreated men with prostate cancer. The increased risk following various forms of ADT was accounted for mainly by associations with pathologic fractures (14% of all fractures). Among men not on ADT (62% of the cohort), more traditional osteoporosis risk factors were implicated. In both groups, underlying clinical characteristics prompting different treatments (indication bias) may have been partially responsible for the associations seen with specific therapies. To the extent that advanced-stage disease and pathologic fractures account for the excess risk, the effectiveness of fracture prevention among men with prostate cancer may be limited.""","""['L Joseph Melton rd', 'Michael M Lieber', 'Elizabeth J Atkinson', 'Sara J Achenbach', 'Horst Zincke', 'Terry M Therneau', 'Sundeep Khosla']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Bone Miner Res""","""['Incidence and risk factors for low trauma fractures in men with prostate cancer.', 'Fracture after androgen deprivation therapy among men with a high baseline risk of skeletal complications.', 'Admissions to hospital due to fracture in England in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy - do we have to worry about the hormones?', 'Maintaining bone health in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Osteoporosis in men with prostate carcinoma receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: recommendations for diagnosis and therapies.', 'Operative challenges of intramedullary nailing for subtrochanteric blastic pathological femur fracture: a case report.', 'Maintaining bone health by estrogen therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer: a narrative review.', 'Associations of visceral adipose tissue with bone mineral density and fracture: observational and Mendelian randomization studies.', 'Multidisciplinary Consensus on the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis and Fragility Fractures in Patients with Prostate Cancer Receiving Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'LncRNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 shuttled by prostate cancer cells-secreted exosomes initiates osteoblastic phenotypes in the bone metastatic microenvironment via miR-205-5p/runt-related transcription factor 2/splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich/polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 axis.']"""

The Notch pathway is constitutively activated in human cancers by chromosomal rearrangements, activating point mutations, or altered expression patterns. Therefore, the Notch pathway is the subject of chemotherapeutic intervention in a variety of human cancers. Notch receptor activation results in the gamma-secretase dependent proteolytic cleavage of the receptor to liberate the Notch intracellular domain that acts to mediate co-activator recruitment to the DNA binding transcription factor, CSL (CBF-1/RBP-Jκ, Su(H), Lag-1). Therapeutic targeting of the Notch pathway by gamma-secretase inhibitors prevents NICD production and regulates CSL-dependent transcriptional activity. To interrogate the loss of CSL activity in breast and prostate cancer cells, we used lentiviral-based shRNA knockdown of CSL. Knockdown of CSL expression was assessed by decreased DNA binding activity and resulted in decreased cell proliferation. In contrast, gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) treatment of these prostate and breast cancer cell lines resulted in minimal growth effects. PCR profiling of Notch pathway genes identified expression changes in few genes (Delta-like-1, Deltex-1, LMO2, and SH2D1A) after CSL knockdown. Consistent with differential effects of GSI on cell survival, GSI treatment failed to recapitulate the gene expression changes observed after CSL knockdown. Thus, CSL inhibition may provide a more effective mechanism to inhibit Notch-pathway dependent cancer cell proliferation as compared to GSI treatment.""","""['Thomas Yong', 'Amanda Sun', 'Michael D Henry', 'Shari Meyers', 'J Nathan Davis']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['OPTHiS Identifies the Molecular Basis of the Direct Interaction between CSL and SMRT Corepressor.', 'Structure and function of the CSL-KyoT2 corepressor complex: a negative regulator of Notch signaling.', 'Effects of Linker Length and Transient Secondary Structure Elements in the Intrinsically Disordered Notch RAM Region on Notch Signaling.', 'The effects of conformational heterogeneity on the binding of the Notch intracellular domain to effector proteins: a case of biologically tuned disorder.', 'CSL-Associated Corepressor and Coactivator Complexes.', 'Systematic analysis of the effects of genetic variants on chromatin accessibility to decipher functional variants in non-coding regions.', 'Breast cancer: molecular mechanisms of underlying resistance and therapeutic approaches.', 'Colon cancer cells secreted CXCL11 via RBP-Jκ to facilitated tumour-associated macrophage-induced cancer metastasis.', 'The role of T2E mediated CBF-1/RBP-Jκ signaling in metastatic thyroid cancer.', 'Elevated RBP-Jκ and CXCL11 Expression in Colon Cancer is Associated with an Unfavorable Clinical Outcome.']"""

Gleason sum at RP is a good indicator of biochemical recurrence and poor clinical outcome. Therefore, there is a need to improve clinical evaluation of PCa aggressiveness in order to choice appropriate treatment. To this aim an easy-available tool is represented by circulating biomarkers. Among these, the best candidates are some molecules involved in PCa pathogenesis such as IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3, IL-6, and its soluble receptor (SIL-6R).  Methods:   In this study, we evaluated the ability of preoperative IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IL-6, and SIL-6R serum levels to predict Gleason score upgrade in 52 PCa patients.  Results:   We found that IGFBP-3 median levels were significantly lower in patients who showed Gleason upgrading from biopsy to RP (P = 0.024). We also found an association between biopsy T-stage and Gleason Upgrade (P = 0.011). Using multivariate logistic regression model, we demonstrated that the association of IGFBP-3 serum levels together with biopsy T-stage and biopsy Gleason score was useful to calculate a prognostic risk score. ROC curve analysis of risk score showed a good ability to predict GSU (AUC = 0.81; 95% CI 0.69-0.93).

TNF-α may activate signaling pathways critical for life/death decisions, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the anti-apoptotic NF-κB pathway. In this work, we investigate the activation status of NF-κB-related proteins in human prostate cancerous versus normal epithelium, and the alterations in the NF-κB pathway in relation to cell death in TNF-α-treated LNCaP (androgen-independent cells) and PC3 (androgen-independent) prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods:   The expression of phospho-p38-MAPK, phospho-IKK-α/β and phospho-IκB-α, total IκB-α, and p65- and p50-NF-κB, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in cancerous and normal prostate samples. The toxicity of TNF-α in LNCaP and PC3 cells, with or without kinase and NF-κB inhibitors, was assessed by changes on viability (MTT assay) and apoptosis (loss of DNA, annexin-V binding, and caspase cleavage/activation). Expression of NF-κB-related proteins in these cell lines was measured by Western blot.  Results:   Phospho-IκB-α, phospho-IKK-α/β and phospho-p38 levels, cytoplasmic p50 to IκB-α ratio, and nuclear p50 and p65, levels, were increased in cancerous epithelium, suggesting activation of the NF-κB pathway in prostatic malignance. TNF-α caused apoptosis with higher efficacy in LNCaP cells, and this response was potentiated by p38-MAPK inhibitor (LNCaP cells) and IKK-β inhibitor (both cell lines). However, the protective action of IKK-β was mediated by NF-κB only in LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   IKK-β mediates both NF-κB-dependent and -independent anti-apoptotic functions in prostate cancerous epithelium. IKK-β and p38-MAPK may represent useful therapeutic targets against prostate cancer.""","""['Gonzalo Rodríguez-Berriguete', 'Benito Fraile', 'Ricardo Paniagua', 'Patricio Aller', 'Mar Royuela']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Genetic deletion of PKR abrogates TNF-induced activation of IkappaBalpha kinase, JNK, Akt and cell proliferation but potentiates p44/p42 MAPK and p38 MAPK activation.', 'Transcriptional regulation of VCAM-1 expression by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in human tracheal smooth muscle cells: involvement of MAPKs, NF-kappaB, p300, and histone acetylation.', 'Sensitization of apoptotically-resistant breast carcinoma cells to TNF and TRAIL by inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.', 'Regulation and function of IKK and IKK-related kinases.', 'TNF-alpha/IL-1/NF-kappaB transduction pathway in human cancer prostate.', 'Pyrimethamine Elicits Antitumor Effects on Prostate Cancer by Inhibiting the p38-NF-κB Pathway.', 'Extracellular Vesicles from Human Advanced-Stage Prostate Cancer Cells Modify the Inflammatory Response of Microenvironment-Residing Cells.', 'PTEN deficiency promotes macrophage infiltration and hypersensitivity of prostate cancer to IAP antagonist/radiation combination therapy.', 'Integrating genomics and proteomics data to predict drug effects using binary linear programming.', 'Membrane TNF-alpha-activated programmed necrosis is mediated by Ceramide-induced reactive oxygen species.']"""

We examined 23 reported prostate cancer susceptibility variants for association with disease progression.  Methods:   Disease progression was explored among 4,673 Swedish patients treated for clinically localized prostate cancer between 1997 and 2002. Prostate cancer progression was defined according to primary treatment as a composed event reflecting termination of deferred treatment, biochemical recurrence, local progression, or presence of distant metastasis. Association between single variants, and all variants combined, were performed in Cox regression analysis assuming both log-additive and co-dominant genetic models.  Results:   Three of the 23 genetic variants explored were nominally associated with prostate cancer progression; rs9364554 (P = 0.041) on chromosome 6q25 and rs10896449 (P = 0.029) on chromosome 11q13 among patients treated with curative intent; and rs4054823 (P = 0.008) on chromosome 17p12 among patients on surveillance. However, none of these associations remained statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. The combined effect of all susceptibility variants was not associated with prostate cancer progression neither among patients receiving treatment with curative intent (P = 0.14) nor among patients on surveillance (P = 0.92).  Conclusions:   We observed no evidence for an association between any of 23 established prostate cancer genetic risk variants and disease progression. Accumulating evidence suggests separate genetic components for initiation and progression of prostate cancer.

We explored the association between pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and other pathologic predictors and PCSM in men who have undergone (RP).  Methods:   We report on 459 patients with PCSM data after RP who were followed prospectively over a 23-year period between 1987 and 1997. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to evaluate pre-operative PSA, pathologic Gleason sum, pathologic stage, and surgical margin status as predictors of PCSM.  Results:   The median PSA was 6.6 ng/ml (± 9.9) and the median follow-up time was 9.4 (± 4.9) years. Fourteen patients (3.1%) died of PC. On multivariate analysis, only PSA (HR: 1.050; P = 0.001) and binary Gleason sum (HR: 3.402; P = 0.043) remained significant predictors of PCSM. The predicted 10-year PCSM was significantly worse in those patients in the highest PSA tertile compared to those in other tertiles [PSA > 9.9: 87% (82-92%) vs. PSA = 4-9.9: 95% (93.0-97.0%) vs. PSA = 0-3.9: 100.0% (100.0-100.0%)].  Conclusions:   We have highlighted the importance of pre-operative PSA in predicting PCSM many years after RP. It is a more significant predictor than Gleason sum and pathologic stage.

PC is difficult to diagnose because the prostate-specific antigen screening method is associated with many false positives. In addition there is a need to develop new and more effective treatments. Among presently available new treatments, immunotherapy is a promising approach. We investigated the expression of the cancer/testis antigen, AKAP-4, in PC patients to evaluate the possibility of exploiting AKAP-4 as a target for immunotherapy.  Methods:   We analyzed normal prostate tissues, 15 patients with PC and the LnCAP PC cell line by immunohistochemistry. We tested AKAP-4 immunogenicity through indirect ELISA on sera from patients and healthy subjects, and we generated in vitro AKAP-4-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Results:   AKAP-4 was shown both at the cytoplasmic and surface levels of the LnCAP PC cell line. AKAP-4 was also highly expressed in PC cells from patients. We detected specific anti-AKAP-4 circulating immunoglobulins in AKAP-4 positive subjects. Using recombinant AKAP-4 loaded autologous dendritic cells, we generated AKAP-4-specific and HLA-I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes able to kill PC cells in vitro. Further characterization indicated a Th-1 skewing in the cytokine secretion profile of these cells.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate the aberrant expression of AKAP-4 in PC, which will potentially be developed as a biomarker in PC.

The KLK4 is a prostate highly expressed gene under the transcriptional control of androgens, encoding for the KLK4 extracellular serine protease. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression status of KLK4 in PCa patients in order to reveal its utility in PCa establishment and clinical management.  Methods:   Prostatic tissue specimens were obtained from 60 PCa and 59 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) randomly chosen patients. Using a developed quantitative real-time RT-PCR method, KLK4 expression levels were determined in the specimens of the two patients' cohorts. Advance biostatistical analysis was completed to explore the clinical value of KLK4 expression in PCa and BPH patients.  Results:   PCa patients presented a statistically significant (P = 0.002) elevation, more than threefold, of the KLK4 transcripts compared to BPH ones. The KLK4 expression levels were also positive correlated with PCa patients' stage (P = 0.031) and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum concentrations (P < 0.001). ROC curve and logistic regression analysis revealed the significant (P = 0.002) and the independent (P = 0.044) clinical value of the KLK4 expression for the discrimination of PCa from BPH patients.  Conclusions:   The KLK4 expression analysis reveals its up-regulation in PCa cells, which is significantly associated with the advanced stages of the disease and the patients' preoperative PSA serum levels.

Because Gleason grading is also based on tissue architecture we explored the hypothesis that the electrical properties might also provide discriminating power between high- and low-Gleason grade cancers.  Methods:   Electrical properties (σ, ε, Δσ, σ(∞) , f(c) , and α) were gauged from 546 prostate tissue samples and correlated with histopathological assessment. Primary and secondary Gleason grades and a Gleason score were assigned to the tissues identified as cancer. We evaluated how well differently graded cancers were separable from benign tissues and from each other on the basis of these properties using ROC curves.  Results:   Of the 546 prostate tissue samples, 71 were identified as cancer and 465 as benign. ε, Δσ, σ(∞) , and f(c) provided the most discriminatory power with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging from 0.77-0.82 for detecting any cancer, 0.72-0.8 for low-grade cancer, and increasing to 0.87-0.9 for detecting high-grade cancer. Further, ε, Δσ, and σ(∞) , provided AUCs ranging from 0.74 to 0.75 for discriminating between low- and high-grade cancers.  Conclusions:   Using the electrical properties to identify prostate cancer is improved when high-grade cancers are sought. These electrical properties can also discriminate between different grades of tumors.

However, a single marker may not necessarily reflect the multifactorial nature of PCa.  Methods:   We analyzed post-PM urine samples from 154 consecutive patients, who presented for prostate biopsies because of elevated serum PSA (>4 ng/ml) and/or abnormal digital rectal exam. We tested whether the putative PCa biomarkers PSMA, PSGR, and PCA3 could be detected by quantitative real-time PCR in post-PM urine sediment. We combined these findings to test if a combination of these biomarkers could improve the specificity of actual diagnosis. Afterwards, we specifically tested our model for clinical usefulness in the PSA diagnostic ""gray zone"" (4-10 ng/ml) on a target subset of 82 men with no prior biopsy.  Results:   By univariate analysis, we found that the PSMA, PSGR, and PCA3 scores were significant predictors of PCa.

Since hormone refractory prostate cancer with bone metastasis is difficult to treat, it is crucial to investigate how androgen independent (AI) human prostate cancer cells communicate with their associated stroma.  Methods:   Shh and its target transcription factor, Gli1 mRNA, were assessed by RT-PCR and/or quantitative RT-PCR in co-cultured cell recombinants comprised of AI C4-2 either with NPF (prostate fibroblasts from normal/benign prostate gland) or CPF (cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts) under Shh/cyclopamine (a hedgehog signaling inhibitor) treatment.

Rearrangement of the ERG gene with the TMPRSS2 gene has been identified in the majority of prostate cancer patients. Additionally, overexpression of ERG is associated with unfavorable prognosis in prostate cancer patients similar to leukemia patients. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate transcription as well as epigenetic status of genes through acetylation of both histones and transcription factors. Deregulation of HATs and HDACs is frequently seen in various cancers, including prostate cancer. Many cellular oncogenes as well as tumor viral proteins are known to target either or both HATs and HDACs. Several studies have demonstrated that there are alterations of HDAC activity in prostate cancer cells. Recently, we found that ERG binds and inhibits HATs, which suggests that ERG is involved in deregulation of protein acetylation. Additionally, it has been shown that ERG is associated with a higher expression of HDACs. In this study, we tested the effect of the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid (VPA) and trichostatin-A (TSA) on ERG-positive prostate cancer cells (VCaP). We found that VPA and TSA induce apoptosis, upregulate p21/Waf1/CIP1, repress TMPRSS2-ERG expression and affect acetylation status of p53 in VCaP cells. These results suggest that HDAC inhibitors might restore HAT activity through two different ways: by inhibiting HDAC activity and by repressing HAT targeting oncoproteins such as ERG.""","""['Wendell S Fortson', 'Shubhalaxmi Kayarthodi', 'Yasuo Fujimura', 'Huali Xu', 'Roland Matthews', 'William E Grizzle', 'Veena N Rao', 'Ganapathy K Bhat', 'E Shyam P Reddy']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Defining the molecular action of HDAC inhibitors and synergism with androgen deprivation in ERG-positive prostate cancer.', 'Expressional changes after histone deacetylase inhibition by valproic acid in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Novel histone deacetylase inhibitor CG200745 induces clonogenic cell death by modulating acetylation of p53 in cancer cells.', 'HDACs and HDAC Inhibitors in Cancer Development and Therapy.', 'The role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in human cancer.', 'SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Sex-Related Differences, and a Possible Personalized Treatment Approach with Valproic Acid: A Review.', 'Effect of Sodium Butyrate on p16INK4a, p14ARF, p15INK4b, Class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3) Class II HDACs (HDACs 4, 5, 6), Cell Growth Inhibition and Apoptosis Induction in Pancreatic Cancer AsPC-1 and Colon Cancer HCT-116 Cell Lines.', 'Effect of vorinostat on INK4 family and HDACs 1, 2, and 3 in pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Epigenetic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum group D suppresses proliferation and promotes apoptosis of HepG2 cells by downregulating ERG expression via the PPARγ pathway.']"""

Existing research on the health and supportive care needs of these survivors is sparse and inconclusive. This study investigated health status, psychological morbidity, and supportive care needs in long-term cancer survivors in the United Kingdom.  Methods:   Five to 16 years after diagnosis, 1,275 eligible survivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers were approached to participate in a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire explored health status (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions), psychological morbidity (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and supportive care needs (Cancer Survivors' Unmet Needs Measure). Data were analyzed by type of cancer and time since diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of unmet supportive care needs.  Results:   The response rate was 51.7% (659 survivors). Overall health status and levels of psychological morbidity were consistent with population norms. At least one unmet supportive care need was reported by 47.4% of survivors, but overall numbers of unmet needs were low (mean, 2.8; standard deviation, 4.8). The most frequently endorsed unmet need was for help to manage concerns about cancer recurrence. Trait anxiety (P < .001), nondischarged status (P < .01), dissatisfaction with discharge (P < .01), and receipt of hormonal therapy (P < .01) were predictive of unmet supportive care needs.  Conclusion:   The findings suggest a majority of long-term breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors who have no signs of recurrence report good health and do not have psychological morbidity or large numbers of unmet supportive care needs. A minority of long-term survivors may benefit from ongoing support. The identification and support of those long-term survivors with ongoing needs is a key challenge for health care professionals.""","""['Siân E Harrison', 'Eila K Watson', 'Alison M Ward', 'Nada F Khan', 'Daniel Turner', 'Eike Adams', 'David Forman', 'Monica F Roche', 'Peter W Rose']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""[""Assessing unmet supportive care needs in partners of cancer survivors: the development and evaluation of the Cancer Survivors' Partners Unmet Needs measure (CaSPUN)."", ""The development and evaluation of a measure to assess cancer survivors' unmet supportive care needs: the CaSUN (Cancer Survivors' Unmet Needs measure)."", 'Predictors of change in unmet supportive care needs in cancer.', 'Quality of life in young adult survivors of childhood cancer.', 'Informational and emotional needs of long-term survivors of breast cancer.', ""Aqua polo: Preliminary feasibility and efficacy study of a programme of adapted, supervised water polo to reduce fatigue and improve women's psychological and social recovery after breast cancer treatment: A mixed-methods design."", 'Risk of critical limb ischemia in long-term uterine cancer survivors: A population-based study.', 'Patient-reported needs for coping with worry or fear about cancer recurrence and the extent to which they are being met: a survey study.', 'Impediments of Cancer Survivorship and Palliative Care: A Mixed-Methods Study in a Tertiary Healthcare Facility in Odisha, India.', 'Factors associated with a high level of unmet needs and their prevalence in the breast cancer survivors 1-5 years after post local treatment and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy during the COVID-19: A cross-sectional study.']"""

Methods:   We tested the efficacy of an intervention to increase multiple health-related behaviors in African Americans. In a multisite cluster-randomized controlled trial, groups of African American human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-serodiscordant heterosexual couples in Atlanta (Georgia), Los Angeles (California), New York (New York), and Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) were allocated to an individual-focused health promotion that addressed multiple health-related behaviors or to a couple-focused HIV/sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk reduction intervention. Primary outcomes were adherence to fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity guidelines assessed preintervention, immediately postintervention, and 6 and 12 months postintervention. Secondary outcomes included fatty food consumption, prostate and breast cancer screening, and alcohol use. Generalized estimating equations tested the efficacy of the health promotion intervention over the postintervention assessments.  Results:   Health promotion intervention participants were more likely to report consuming 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily (rate ratio [RR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18 to 1.62) and adhering to physical activity guidelines (1.39; 1.22 to 1.59) compared with HIV/STD intervention participants. In the health promotion intervention compared with the HIV/STD intervention, participants consumed fatty foods less frequently (mean difference, -0.18; 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.07), more men received prostate cancer screening (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.88), and more women received a mammogram (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.50). Alcohol use did not differ between the intervention groups.

It is unclear whether all cancer-initiating signals depend on an intact hormone receptor signaling machinery. To ascertain whether cell autonomous androgen receptor (AR) is essential for initiation of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), the response of AR-null prostate epithelia to paracrine and cell autonomous oncogenic signals was assessed in vivo by using the prostate regeneration model system. Epithelial-specific loss of AR blocked paracrine FGF10-induced PIN, whereas the add back of exogenous AR restored this response. In contrast, PIN initiated by cell-autonomous, chronic-activated AKT developed independent of epithelial AR signaling. Our findings demonstrate a selective role for AR in the initiation of PIN, dependent on the signaling pathways driving tumor formation.

Of specific interest were (1) how the experience of prostate cancer affected the couple's unique intersubjective identity, and how in turn (2) the couple's identity and relationship culture influenced their adjustment to cancer. An ethnographic mode of inquiry was adopted. Marital partners were interviewed together on two separate occasions with the intention of having them deepen their conjoint reflexive processing of their relationship. During the interviews, couples were asked to reflect upon and articulate their sense of themselves as a couple, their experience of ""we-ness"" and shared identity, and the interaction between the illness and we-ness. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the grounded theory method. The grounded theory analysis yielded three main themes portraying the couples' experience of prostate cancer: (1) riding the vortex, (2) holding the communal body intact, and (3) invincibility and its underbelly. A more broad understanding to arise from this investigation was the notion of a ""communal body"" and that couples participated in a shared corporeality, to which each partner's identity and sense of self was intricately tied.

This study aims at evaluating the impact of using combined CT-MRI images in organ delineation compared to using CT images alone, on the clinical results. For 10 prostate cancer patients, the respective CT and MRI images at treatment position were acquired. The CTV was delineated using the CT and MRI images, separately, whereas bladder and rectum were delineated using the CT images alone. Based on the CT and MRI images, two CTVs were produced for each patient. The mutual information algorithm was used in the fusion of the two image sets. In this way, the structures drawn on the MRI images were transferred to the CT images in order to produce the treatment plans. For each set of structures of each patient, IMRT and 3D-CRT treatment plans were produced. The individual treatment plans were compared using the biologically effective uniform dose () and the complication-free tumor control probability (P(+)) concepts together with the DVHs of the targets and organs at risk and common dosimetric criteria. For the IMRT treatment, at the optimum dose level of the average CT and CT-MRI delineated CTV dose distributions, the P(+) values are 74.7% in both cases for a of 91.5 Gy and 92.1 Gy, respectively. The respective average total control probabilities, PB are 90.0% and 90.2%, whereas the corresponding average total complication probabilities, P(I) are 15.3% and 15.4%. Similarly, for the 3D-CRT treatment, the average P(+) values are 42.5% and 46.7%, respectively for a of 86.4 Gy and 86.7 Gy, respectively. The respective average P(B) values are 80.0% and 80.6%, whereas the corresponding average P(I) values are 37.4% and 33.8%, respectively. For both radiation modalities, the improvement mainly stems from the better sparing of rectum. According to these results, the expected clinical effectiveness of IMRT can be increased by a maximum ΔP(+) of around 0.9%, whereas of 3D-CRT by about 4.2% when combined CT-MRI delineation is performed instead of using CT images alone. It is apparent that in both IMRT and 3D-CRT radiation modalities, the better knowledge of the CTV extension improved the produced dose distribution. It is shown that the CTV is irradiated more effectively, while the complication probabilities of bladder and rectum, which is the principal organs at risk, are lower in the CT-MRI based treatment plans.""","""['A Tzikas', 'P Karaiskos', 'N Papanikolaou', 'P Sandilos', 'E Koutsouveli', 'E Lavdas', 'C Scarleas', 'K Dardoufas', 'B K Lind', 'P Mavroidis']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a comparison of four consensus guidelines and dosimetric evaluation of 3D-CRT versus tomotherapy IMRT.', 'Persistently better treatment planning results of intensity-modulated (IMRT) over conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in prostate cancer patients with significant variation of clinical target volume and/or organs-at-risk.', 'MRI-based treatment planning for radiotherapy: dosimetric verification for prostate IMRT.', 'Target-volume and critical-organ delineation for conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer: experience of French dose-escalation trials.', 'The impact of technological advances on the evolution of 3D conformal brachytherapy for early prostate cancer.', 'Safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer without treatment planning MRI.', 'Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging combined with computed tomography in tumor volume delineation: A case report.', 'Target definition in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using magnetic resonance imaging only workflow.', 'Clinical and radiobiological evaluation of a method for planning target volume generation dependent on organ-at-risk exclusions in magnetic resonance imaging-based prostate radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of the Geometric and Dosimetric Accuracy of Synthetic Computed Tomography Images for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-only Stereotactic Radiosurgery.']"""

The purpose of this study is to determine whether predefined action thresholds can be generally applied or if patient-specific action thresholds may be required. Software algorithms were developed in the MatLab (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA) software environment to simulate shifts of the patient structure set consisting of prostate, bladder, and rectum. These structures were shifted by 1/2 10 mm in each direction in 1 mm increments to simulate displacements during treatment, without taking into consideration organ deformity. Dose-volume data at each shift were plotted and analyzed. A linear relationship was observed between planning dose-volume parameters and shifted dose-volume parameters. For a 5 mm anterior shift, it was observed that individual rectal V70 values increased by absolute magnitudes of 6-15%, dependent on the planning rectal V70 of each patient. Likewise, for a 5 mm inferior shift, individual bladder V70 values increased by 1-14%, dependent on planning bladder V70. This linear relationship was observed for all levels of shifts up to 10 mm. Since rectum and bladder dose-volume changes due to patient shifts are dependent on dose-volume parameters, this study suggests that patient-specific action thresholds may be necessary.""","""['A M Block', 'J Lin', 'M A Hoggarth', 'M Quinn', 'R Garza', 'C A Mantz', 'J C Roeske']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Geometric and dosimetric evaluations of an online image-guidance strategy for 3D-CRT of prostate cancer.', 'Influence of volumes of prostate, rectum, and bladder on treatment planning CT on interfraction prostate shifts during ultrasound image-guided IMRT.', 'Anatomic variations due to radical prostatectomy.

Methods:   This is a pilot study evaluating the use of human collagen as a displacing agent for the rectal wall injected before starting a course of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer. Using a transperineal approach, 20 mL of human collagen was injected into the perirectal space in an outpatient setting. Computerized IMRT plans were performed pre- and postcollagen injection, and after a patient completed their radiotherapy, to determine radiation dose reduction to the rectum associated with the collagen injection. Computed tomography scans were performed 6 months and 12 months after completing their radiotherapy to evaluate absorption rate of the collagen. All patients were treated with IMRT to a dose of 75.6 Gy to the prostate.  Results:   Eleven patients were enrolled into the study. The injection of human collagen in the outpatient setting was well tolerated. The mean separation between the prostate and anterior rectum was 12.7 mm. The mean reduction in dose to the anterior rectal wall was 50%. All men denied any rectal symptoms during the study.

Methods and materials:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 96 men treated with conformal prostate bed SRT (median, 64.8 Gy) at a single institution (median follow-up, 70 months). The majority had intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. Fifty-four percent underwent a resection with positive margins (R1 resection). The median time interval between surgery and SRT was 22 months.  Results:   After SRT, 66% of patients reached a PSA nadir of less than 0.2 ng/mL. However, the 5-year biochemical no evidence of disease rate was 35%. Seminal vesicle involvement was predictive for a significantly lower biochemical no evidence of disease rate. All patients with a preoperative PSA level greater than 50 ng/mL relapsed biochemically within 2 years. The 5-year distant metastasis rate was 18%, the 5-year prostate cancer-specific survival rate was 90%, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 88%. Significantly more distant metastases developed in patients with a PSA nadir greater than 0.05 ng/mL after SRT, and they had significantly inferior prostate cancer-specific and overall survival rates. Resection status (R1 vs. R0) was not predictive for any of the endpoints.  Conclusions:   Men with postoperative PSA relapse can undergo salvage treatment by prostate bed radiotherapy, but durable PSA control is maintained only in about one-third of the patients.

Methods:   We identified in our database CaP patients with histologically documented, treated with SA alone and for whom vital status with a minimum follow-up of 6 months (except death beforehand) was established. Patient characteristics and CaP and PSA at baseline, PSA nadir, time of reaching the nadir PSA (DAN) and the ratio of the DAN/nadir value (ratio DAN/Nadir) were analyzed in relation to progression-free survival, specific and overall survival.  Results:   One hundred ninety eight patients met the inclusion criteria and the median was 61.5 months (range 4.8 to 233). The median PSA at the start of the SA were 37.1 ng/mL and the median nadir PSA was 0.48 ng/mL. The median time to progression was 23.6 months. The median specific and overall survivals were 94 and 78 months, respectively. In univariate analysis, predictors of progression-free survival were PSA before SA, PSA nadir, DAN, DAN ratio/nadir, Gleason score, the percentage of core positive prostate biopsy and the status of bone scintigraphy. Except for PSA before SA which was no longer significant, predictors of specific and overall survival were similar and added the biochemical response (decrease of more than 50% of PSA) to a second hormonal manipulation during the biological progression. In multivariate analysis, the nadir PSA and the ratio DAN/Nadir remained significant predictors.

The aim of this study was to evaluate acute and late toxicities of conformal radiotherapy, with high dose for localized prostate cancer in patients older than 70 years and compared to patients younger than 70 years. Between 1996 and 2009, 104 patients were treated with radiation therapy and hormonal therapy for localized cancer prostate. Median follow-up was 105 months (9-300). Acute (occurred at ≤ three months) and late side effects of 55 patients older than 70 years (median age: 75 [71-92]) were graded according to the CTCAE 3.0 criteria and compared to the younger population. Median dose to the prostate was 75.6 Gy (67-80) in both groups. There were no significant differences in acute and late side effects between age groups. For patients above 70 years, the incidence of grade II or higher acute and late side effects were respectively 27 and 22% for urologic symptoms and 13 and 16% for rectal symptoms. The frequency of grade III late symptoms was low and ranged between 0 and 6% for the evaluated symptoms, irrespective of age group.

Previous in vitro experiments demonstrated that Skp2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase aberrantly overexpressed in PCa, is involved in the proteolytic degradation of BRCA2 in PCa cells, suggesting that the BRCA2-Skp2 interaction may play a role in prostate tumorigenesis. Herein, we investigated BRCA2 and Skp2 expression during PCa development using a prostate TMA. Although luminal and basal benign prostate epithelium exhibited moderate to strong nuclear BRCA2 immunostaining, the intensity and number of positive nuclei decreased significantly in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PCa. Decreased frequency and intensity of nuclear BRCA2 labeling were inversely correlated with Skp2 expression in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PCa. To functionally assess the effects of BRCA2 and Skp2 expression on prostate malignant transformation, we overexpressed Skp2 in normal immortalized prostate cells. Skp2 overexpression reduced BRCA2 protein and promoted cell growth and migration. A similar phenotype was observed after reduction of BRCA2 protein levels using specific BRCA2 small-interfering RNA. Forced BRCA2 expression in Skp2-overexpressing stable transfectants inhibited the migratory and growth properties by >60%. These results show that loss of BRCA2 expression during prostate tumor development is strongly correlated with both migratory behavior and cancer growth and include Skp2 as a BRCA2 proteolytic partner in vivo.""","""['Arnaldo A Arbini', 'Margherita Greco', 'Jorge L Yao', 'Patricia Bourne', 'Ersilia Marra', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', ""Paul A di Sant'agnese"", 'Loredana Moro']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Elevated Skp2 protein expression in human prostate cancer: association with loss of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and PTEN and with reduced recurrence-free survival.', 'Skp2 and Slug Are Coexpressed in Aggressive Prostate Cancer and Inhibited by Neddylation Blockade.', 'The role of homeostatic regulation between tumor suppressor DAB2IP and oncogenic Skp2 in prostate cancer growth.', 'Up-regulation of Skp2 after prostate cancer cell adhesion to basement membranes results in BRCA2 degradation and cell proliferation.', 'Skp2: a novel potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'The Impact of SKP2 Gene Expression in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.', 'Emerging Roles of SKP2 in Cancer Drug Resistance.', '6-Thioguanine and Its Analogs Promote Apoptosis of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells in a BRCA2-Dependent Manner.', 'S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in methotrexate-resistant osteosarcoma cells.', 'Ubiquitin-specific protease 21 stabilizes BRCA2 to control DNA repair and tumor growth.']"""

The role of EpCAM is not limited to cell adhesion but includes diverse processes such as signaling, cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation.  Objective:   Several studies investigated EpCAM expression in prostate carcinoma but none of them confirmed its prognostic role. The aim of our study was to investigate EpCAM expression and its relationship with established prognostic features in prostate carcinoma.  Materials and methods:   The study included a cohort of 102 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the EpCAM expression in prostate cancer and non-neoplastic prostate tissue. The percentage of positively stained carcinoma and benign glands was examined in the whole mount of the chosen slide.  Results:   The extent of EpCAM expression was significantly higher in malignant than in benign prostatic tissue (P < 0.001). EpCAM expression in prostate cancer was associated with established features indicative of worse prognosis, such as preoperative (P = 0.009) and postoperative (P = 0.004) Gleason score and follow-up time (P < 0.001). Patients with higher preoperative and postoperative Gleason score and short follow-up time had tumors with a significantly higher expression of EpCAM. Negative correlation of follow-up time and EpCAM expression indicated that tumors in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) harbored higher EpCAM expression. Moreover, expression of EpCAM was significantly higher in patients with BCR compared with patients without BCR (P < 0.001). Tumors in T3 stage of the disease showed significantly higher EpCAM expression compared with T2 tumors (P = 0.002). Univariate (P < 0.001) and multivariate (P < 0.001) analyses showed that EpCAM expression was a significant predictor of shorter biochemical recurrence free-survival.  Conclusion:   Our results confirmed high level of EpCAM expression in prostate cancer and support its potential role in prostatic cancer progression. In addition, EpCAM could serve as an additional prognostic marker for the recognition of patients with an increased risk of disease recurrence that need introduction of secondary therapy.""","""['Goran Benko', 'Borislav Spajić', 'Božo Krušlin', 'Davor Tomas']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Akt Activation Correlates with Snail Expression and Potentially Determines the Recurrence of Prostate Cancer in Patients at Stage T2 after a Radical Prostatectomy.', 'PPM1D as a novel biomarker for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Expression of EpCAM and prognosis in early-stage glottic cancer treated by radiotherapy.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule expression (CD326) in cancer: a short review.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule: more than a carcinoma marker and adhesion molecule.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule‑targeting designed ankyrin repeat protein‑toxin fusion Ec1‑LoPE exhibits potent cytotoxic action in prostate cancer cells.', 'Selection of DNA Aptamers Recognizing EpCAM-Positive Prostate Cancer by Cell-SELEX for in vitro and in vivo MR Imaging.', 'Influence of the Position and Composition of Radiometals and Radioiodine Labels on Imaging of Epcam Expression in Prostate Cancer Model Using the DARPin Ec1.', 'The potential of CAR T cell therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   In vitro studies consisted of culturing PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells and then immunoblotting Aurora A and phospho-Aurora A after radiation and/or nocodazole with MLN8054. Phases of the cell cycle were measured with flow cytometry. PC3 and DU145 cell lines were measured for survival after treatment with MLN8054 and radiation. Immunofluorescence measured γ-H2AX in the PC3 and DU145 cells after treatment. In vivo studies looked at growth delay of PC3 tumor cells in athymic nude mice. PC3 cells grew for 6 to 8 days in mice treated with radiation, MLN8054, or combined for 7 more days. Tumors were resected and fixed on paraffin and stained for von Willebrand factor, Ki67, and caspase-3.  Results:   In vitro inhibition of Aurora-A by MLN8054 sensitized prostate cancer cells, as determined by dose enhancement ratios in clonogenic assays. These effects were associated with sustained DNA double-strand breaks, as evidenced by increased immunofluorescence for γ-H2AX and significant G2/M accumulation and polyploidy.

Five radiation oncologists contoured the prostate for each patient on CT first, then MRI, and again between 2 and 4 weeks later. Three education sessions were then conducted. The same contouring process was then repeated with the same datasets and oncologists. The observer variation was assessed according to changes in the ratio of the encompassing volume to intersecting volume (volume ratio [VR]), across sets of target volumes.  Results:   For interobserver variation, there was a 15% reduction in mean VR with CT, from 2.74 to 2.33, and a 40% reduction in mean VR with MRI, from 2.38 to 1.41 after education. A similar trend was found for intraobserver variation, with a mean VR reduction for CT and MRI of 9% (from 1.51 to 1.38) and 16% (from 1.37 to 1.15), respectively.  Conclusion:   A well-structured education program has reduced both inter- and intraobserver prostate contouring variations. The impact was greater on MRI than on CT.

The urinalyses in the 56 men undergoing prostatectomy were reviewed, with the results compared between patients with and without bladder urine T1 hyperintensity.  Results:   Four (7.1%) of 56 men with prostate cancer exhibited T1 hyperintense bladder urine, compared with six (3.8%) of 160 patients exhibiting this finding in the control group (P=.288). Of the four prostate cancer patients with this finding, all exhibited a normal urinalysis. An abnormal urinalysis was identified for four of the prostate cancer patients, all of whom exhibited normal urine T1 signal intensity.  Conclusion:   Bladder urine T1 hyperintensity may be seen occasionally in patients with prostate cancer but is not associated with abnormal urinalysis and therefore should not be regarded as a sign of acute urinary pathology.""","""['Andrew B Rosenkrantz', 'Benjamin E Niver', 'Martin Kopec', 'Douglas S Berkman', 'Herbert Lepor', 'James S Babb', 'Elizabeth M Hecht']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Imaging""","""['Contribution of the prostate limits the usefulness of survivin for the detection of bladder cancer.', 'Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate and bladder.', 'Predictive value of PCA3 in urinary sediments in determining clinico-pathological characteristics of prostate cancer.', 'Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the bladder and prostate.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate and bladder.', 'Deferoxamine as a potential cause of incidentally found T1-hyperintense urine on magnetic resonance imaging.', 'High-Signal Bladder Urine at T1-Weighted MR Imaging Performed 1-7 Days After a Prior Gadolinium-Enhanced MRI: Prevalence and Correlation with Renal Function.']"""

The UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, polypeptide B15 (UGT2B15), is an important enzyme involved in the metabolism of multiple endobiotics and xenobiotics. In the present study, we measured the relative expression of two alleles at SNP c.1568C>A (rs4148269) in this gene, which causes an amino acid substitution (T523K). An excess of the C over the A allele was consistently observed in both liver (P=0.0021) and breast (P=0.012) samples, suggesting that SNP(s) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with c.1568C>A can regulate UGT2B15 expression in both tissues. By resequencing, one such SNP, c.1761T>C (rs3100) in 3' untranslated region (UTR), was identified. Reporter gene assays showed that the 1761T allele results in a significantly higher gene expression level than the 1761C allele in HepG2, MCF-7, LNCaP, and Caco-2 cell lines (all P<0.001), thus indicating that this variation can regulate UGT2B15 gene expression in liver, breast, colon, and prostate tissues. Considering its location, we postulated that this SNP is within an unknown microRNA binding site and can influence microRNA targeting.

In this study, we showed the differential TRAIL responsiveness of human prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 and human colon carcinoma KM12 cells and their respective highly metastatic PC3-MM2 and KM12L4A sublines and investigated the mechanism underlying high susceptibility of human metastatic cancer cells to TRAIL.  Results:   PC3-MM2 and KM12L4A cells with high level of c-Myc and DNA-PKcs were more susceptible to TRAIL than their poorly metastatic primary PC3 and KM12 cells, which was associated with down-regulation of c-FLIPL/S and Mcl-1 and up-regulation of the TRAIL receptor DR5 but not DR4 in both metastatic cells. Moreover, high susceptibility of these metastatic cells to TRAIL was resulted from TRAIL-induced potent activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 in comparison with their primary cells, which led to cleavage and down-regulation of DNA-PKcs. Knockdown of c-Myc gene in TRAIL-treated PC3-MM2 cells prevented the increase of DR5 cell surface expression, caspase activation and DNA-PKcs cleavage and attenuated the apoptotic effects of TRAIL. Moreover, the suppression of DNA-PKcs level with siRNA in the cells induced the up-regulation of DR5 and active caspase-8, -9, and -3. We also found that 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzaldehyde (DMNB), a specific inhibitor of DNA-PK, potentiated TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in relatively TRAIL-insensitive PC3 and KM12 cells and therefore functioned as a TRAIL sensitizer.  Conclusion:   This study showed the positive relationship between c-Myc expression in highly metastatic human prostate and colon cancer cells and susceptibility to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and therefore indicated that TRAIL might be used as an effective therapeutic modality for advanced metastatic cancers overexpressing c-Myc and combination of TRAIL therapy with agent that inhibits the DNA-PKcs/Akt signaling pathway might be clinically useful for the treatment of relatively TRAIL-insensitive human cancers.""","""['Hak-Bong Kim', 'Mi-Ju Kim', 'Dae-Young Kim', 'Jae-Won Lee', 'Jae-Ho Bae', 'Dong-Wan Kim', 'Chi-Dug Kang', 'Sun-Hee Kim']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Cisplatin-mediated c-myc overexpression and cytochrome c (cyt c) release result in the up-regulation of the death receptors DR4 and DR5 and the activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9, likely responsible for the TRAIL-sensitizing effect of cisplatin.', 'Molecular mechanism of cisplatin to enhance the ability of TRAIL in reversing multidrug resistance in gastric cancer cells.', 'α-TEA induces apoptosis of human breast cancer cells via activation of TRAIL/DR5 death receptor pathway.', 'Down-regulation of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, particularly c-FLIP by therapeutic agents; the novel view to overcome resistance to TRAIL.', 'Regulation of Cancer Metastasis by TRAIL/Death Receptor Signaling.', 'CRL4ADTL degrades DNA-PKcs to modulate NHEJ repair and induce genomic instability and subsequent malignant transformation.', 'Potential Role of CD133 Expression in the Susceptibility of Human Liver Cancer Stem-Like Cells to TRAIL.', 'Trailing TRAIL Resistance: Novel Targets for TRAIL Sensitization in Cancer Cells.', 'Amurensin G enhances the susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-mediated cytotoxicity of cancer stem-like cells of HCT-15 cells.', 'TRAIL and guardian angel of genome integrity: ATM boards TRAIL blazer.']"""

The resulted graphene-modified electrode offers an excellent platform for high-performance biosensing applications. On the basis of the cathodic ECL signal of luminol on the graphene-modified electrode, an ECL sandwich immunosensor for sensitive detection of cancer biomarkers at low potential was developed with a multiple signal amplification strategy from functionalized graphene and gold nanorods multilabeled with glucose oxidase (GOx) and secondary antibody (Ab(2)). The functionalized graphene improved the electron transfer on the electrode interface and was employed to attach the primary antibody (Ab(1)) due to it large surface area. The gold nanorods were not only used as carriers of secondary antibody (Ab(2)) and GOx but also catalyzed the ECL reaction of luminol, which further amplified the ECL signal of luminol in the presence of glucose and oxygen. The as-proposed low-potential ECL immunosensor exhibited high sensitivity and specificity on the detection of prostate protein antigen (PSA), a biomarker of prostate cancer that was used as a model. A linear relationship between ECL signals and the concentrations of PSA was obtained in the range from 10 pg mL(-1) to 8 ng mL(-1). The detection limit of PSA was 8 pg mL(-1) (signal-to-noise ratio of 3). Moreover, the as-proposed low-potential ECL immunosensor exhibited excellent stability and reproducibility. The graphene-based ECL immunosensor accurately detected PSA concentration in 10 human serum samples from patients demonstrated by excellent correlations with standard chemiluminescence immunoassay.

Yet the results of several independent studies strongly point to such a carcinogenic effect, particularly in the case of hormone-dependent cancers. Such malignancies have been induced experimentally in rodents and have also been observed in humans. For example, a moderately elevated incidence of prostate cancer has been noted in U.S. farmers and, more recently in the French West Indian population exposed for more than 30 years to the insecticide chlordecone. We discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect in prostate cancer Lessons from the observed trans-generational carcinogenic effect of the synthetic estrogen diethylstilboestrol also strongly suggests that future generations must be protected from widespread distribution of synthetic estrogens in the environment.

Summary and background data:   Cancer is a known risk factor for VTE but less is known about VTE risk after specific cancer operations. Moreover, most cancer patients routinely receive VTE prophylaxis postoperatively while in the hospital, but few receive prolonged prophylaxis despite strong evidence it reduces postdischarge events.  Methods:   From 211 ACS NSQIP hospitals, 44,656 patients undergoing surgery for 9 cancers were identified (2006-2008). The frequency of VTE within 30-days of surgery was evaluated by cancer site and categorized as occurring before or after discharge. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to assess risk factors associated with VTE.  Results:   VTE occurred in 1.6% of all patients, most frequently after esophagogastric (4.2%) and hepatopancreaticobiliary (3.6%) surgery. Overall, 33.4% of VTEs occurred postdischarge (from 17.9% for esophagogastric to 100% for endocrine operations). Factors associated with VTE were age (≥65 years), cancer/procedure type, metastatic disease, congestive heart failure, body mass index (BMI; ≥25 kg/m(2)), ascites, thrombocytosis (>400,000 cells/mm(3)), albumin (<3.0 g/dL), and operation duration (>2 hours; all P < 0.001). Overall VTE was significantly more likely after gastrointestinal, lung, prostate, and ovarian/uterine operations (all P < 0.001). In those experiencing a VTE, mortality increased over 6-fold (8.0% vs. 1.3%; P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   One-third of VTE events in cancer surgery patients occurred postdischarge. Postoperative VTE was associated with operation type.

To elucidate the mechanism by which lunasin reduces tumor foci formation in cultured mammalian cells, nontumorigenic (RWPE-1) and tumorigenic (RWPE-2) human prostate epithelial cells were treated with lunasin followed by gene expression profiling and characterization of the chromatin acetylation status for certain chemopreventive genes.

Using histone acetyltransferase (HAT) assays with acid-extracted histones as templates, we showed that lunasin specifically inhibited H4K8 acetylation while enhanced H4K16 acetylation catalyzed by HAT enzymes p300, PCAF, and HAT1A. These results suggest a novel mechanism for lunasin-dependent upregulation of gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed hypoacetylation of H4K16 in RWPE-2 cells, specifically at the 5' end of THBS1 containing a CpG island. Moreover, bisulfite PCR (BSP) and subsequent DNA sequencing indicated that this CpG island was hypomethylated in RWPE-1 but hypermethylated in RWPE-2 cells.

Tumor-associated lipogenesis can protect cancer cells from carcinogenic- and therapeutic-associated treatments. Increased synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol is regulated by androgens through induction of several genes in androgen-responsive cancer cells. Acetyl-CoA-carboxylase-α (ACCA) is a key enzyme in the regulation of fatty acids synthesis. Here we show that AR binds in vivo to intron regions of human ACCA gene. We also show that the level of ACCA protein in LNCaP depends on AR expression and that DHT treatment increases ACCA expression and fatty acid synthesis. Inhibition of ACCA by TOFA (5-tetradecyl-oxy-2-furoic acid) decreases fatty acid synthesis and induces caspase activation and cell death in most PCa cell lines. Our data suggest that TOFA can kill cells via the mitochondrial pathway since we found cytochrome c release after TOFA treatment in androgen sensitive cell lines. The results also imply that the pro-apoptotic effect of TOFA may be mediated via a decrease of neuropilin-1(NRP1) and Mcl-1expression. We have previously reported that Mcl-1 is under AR regulation and plays an important role in resistance to drug-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, and NRP1 is known to regulate Mcl-1 expression.

However, the mechanism by which troglitazone reduces prostate cancer cell growth is not fully understood. To understand the signaling pathways involved in troglitazone-induced decreases in prostate cancer growth, we examined the effect of troglitazone on androgen-independent C4-2 human prostate cancer cells. Initial experiments revealed troglitazone inhibited C4-2 cell proliferation by arresting cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. Since the proto-oncogene product c-Myc regulates both apoptosis and cell cycle progression, we next examined whether troglitazone altered expression of c-Myc. Troglitazone decreased c-Myc protein levels as well as expression of downstream targets of c-Myc in a dose-dependent manner. In C4-2 cells, troglitazone-induced decreases in c-Myc protein involve proteasome-mediated degradation of c-Myc protein as well as reductions in c-Myc mRNA levels. It appears that troglitazone stimulates degradation of c-Myc by increasing c-Myc phosphorylation, for the level of phosphorylated c-Myc was elevated in prostate cancer cells exposed to troglitazone. While troglitazone dramatically decreased the amount of c-Myc within C4-2 cells, the PPARγ ligands ciglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone did not reduce c-Myc protein levels. Furthermore the down-regulation of c-Myc by troglitazone was not blocked by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 and siRNA-mediated decreases in PPARγ protein.

Objective:   The objective of the study was to quantify these risks, especially risk of parathyroid tumors after other cancers.  Design:   This was a population-based retrospective cohort study.  Participants:   Participants included the Swedish Family-Cancer Database (1958-2008; 11,697,301 individuals; 1,128,735 survivors of first primary cancers including 12,037 patients with parathyroid adenoma and 83 parathyroid adenocarcinoma).  Main outcome measure:   Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were adjusted for age; sex; period; residential area; socioeconomic status; and history of hospitalization for obesity, alcoholism, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Results:   Nonendocrine cancer sites with significantly increased risk after parathyroid adenoma were small intestine (SIR 2.3), blood (polycythemia vera 2.0), kidney (1.8), nervous system (1.6), skin (melanoma 1.4), and breast (women 1.2). Risk of parathyroid adenoma significantly increased after polycythemia vera (3.9) and malignancy in small intestine (3.5), kidney (2.8), nervous system (2.0), prostate (1.5), skin (melanoma 1.5), bladder (1.4), and breast (women 1.2). Twelve cases of parathyroid adenocarcinoma showed significantly higher risk after other tumors (2.4), especially after thyroid cancer (46.6) and parathyroid adenoma (27.3) but not vice versa in 11 cancer survivors.  Conclusions:   Parathyroid adenoma can be a risk factor for parathyroid adenocarcinoma; polycythemia vera; melanoma; and small intestine, kidney, nervous system and breast cancers.

In the present study, we have investigated an unexpected link between TGase-4 and the melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (MDA-7/IL-24), a cytokine known to regulate the growth and apoptosis of certain cancer and immune cells.  Methods:   Frozen sections of normal and malignant human prostate tissues and human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines PC-3 and CA-HPV-10, cell lines expressing low and high levels of TGase-4, and recombinant MDA-7/IL-24 (rhMDA-7/IL-24) were used. Expression construct for human TGase-4 was generated using a mammalian expression vector with full length human TGase-4 isolated from normal human prostate tissues. PC-3 cells were transfected with expression construct or control plasmid. Stably transfected cells for control transfection and TGase-4 over expression were created. Similarly, expression of TGase-4 in CA-HPV-10 cells were knocked down by way of ribozyme transgenes. Single and double immunofluorescence microscopy was used for localization and co-localization of TGase-4 and MDA-7/IL-24 in PCa tissues and cells with antibodies to TGase-4; MDA-7/IL-24; IL-20alpha; IL-20beta and IL-22R. Cell-matrix adhesion, attachment and migration were by electric cell substrate impedance sensing and growth by in vitro cell growth assay. A panel of small molecule inhibitors, including Akt, was used to determine signal pathways involving TGase-4 and MDA-7/IL-24.  Results:   We initially noted that MDA-7 resulted in inhibition of cell adhesion, growth and migration of human PCa PC-3 cells which did not express TGase-4. However, after the cells over-expressed TGase-4 by way of transfection, the TGase-4 expressing cells lost their adhesion, growth and migratory inhibitory response to MDA-7. On the other hand, CA-HPV-10 cells, a cell type naturally expressing high levels of TGase-4, had a contrasting response to MDA-7 when compared with PC-3 cells. Inhibitor to Akt reversed the inhibitory effect of MDA-7, only in PC-3 control cells, but not the TGase-4 expressing PC-3 cells. In human prostate tissues, TGase-4 was found to have a good degree of co-localization with one of the MDA-7 receptor complexes, IL-20Ra.  Conclusion:   The presence of TGase-4 has a biological impact on a prostate cancer cell's response to MDA-7. TGase-4, via mechanism(s) yet to be identified, blocked the action of MDA-7 in prostate cancer cells.

Previous studies have shown a close relationship between the expression level of TIEG1 and various cancers, including breast, prostate, colorectal and pancreatic cancer. In this study, we up-regulated the gene expression of TIEG1 in SW1990 pancreatic cancer cell line by a lentivirus transfection system and investigated its potential as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer. The results showed that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of TIEG1 gene inhibited human pancreatic cancer SW1990 cell proliferation and caused the cell cycle arrest at the G1-phase in vitro. SW1990 cells transduced with lenti-TIEG1 showed significant inhibition of colony formation and cancer cell growth in 3-D culture model. Moreover, overexpression of TIEG1 gene significantly slowed the growth of SW1990 xenografts in nude mice. Taken together, these data provided evidence that overexpression of TIEG1 gene by a lentivirus transfection system led to suppressed human pancreatic cancer cell growth and might therefore be a feasible approach in the clinical management of pancreatic cancer.""","""['Lei Jiang', 'Fule Wang', 'Feiyan Lin', 'Shen-Meng Gao', 'Yingxia Tan', 'Yixiang Han', 'Chiqi Chen', 'Jianbo Wu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cell Biol Int""","""['Promoted cancer growth by stimulating cell proliferation and decreasing apoptosis using a lentivirus-based EphB2 RNAi in pancreatic carcinoma CFPAC-1 cells.', 'Suppression of growth of pancreatic cancer cell and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor by gene silencing with RNA interference.', 'Ski acts as therapeutic target of qingyihuaji formula in the treatment of SW1990 pancreatic cancer.', 'Lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting XIAP and survivin inhibit SW1990 pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.', 'STAT3-targeting RNA interference inhibits pancreatic cancer angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.', 'High Expression of KLF10 Is Associated with Favorable Survival in Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'KLF10 as a Tumor Suppressor Gene and Its TGF-β Signaling.']"""

Methods:   A cohort (n = 200,660) based on 4 groups of men, according to age at cohort entry, with TG, TC, and glucose measurements was selected from the Apolipoprotein MOrtality RISk (AMORIS) database. Of these, 5112 men developed pCa. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze associations among TG, TC, and pCa. Competing risks were assessed graphically.  Results:   Age-stratified analyses for quartiles of TG, TC, and glucose showed a negative association between glucose and pCa risk (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86-1.01), 0.93 (0.86-1.01), 0.87 (0.81-0.94) for the second, third, and fourth quartiles compared with the first (P(trend) = .001). Stratified analysis by glucose levels (<6.11 or ≥ 6.11 mmol/L) showed a positive association between hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 1.71 mmol/L) and pCa risk, when there were high glucose levels (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.48). No association was found for hypercholesterolemia (TC ≥ 6.50 mmol/L). Competing risk analysis showed that protective effects of glucose were overestimated in conventional Cox proportional hazard models and strengthened positive findings between TG and pCa risk.  Conclusions:   The authors'; findings supported the hypothesis that factors of the glucose and lipid metabolism influence pCa risk. Competing risk assessment showed that it is important to take into account the long natural history and age distribution of pCa when interpreting results.

The authors sought to compare the impact of comorbidity and age on treatment choice in men with low-risk disease.  Methods:   The authors sampled 509 men with low-risk prostate cancer diagnosed at the Greater Los Angeles and Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Centers between 1997 and 2004. Rates of aggressive treatment (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, brachytherapy) were determined among men of different ages and with different Charlson comorbidity scores. Multivariate modeling was used to determine the influence of both variables in predicting nonaggressive treatment, and Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare the risk of other-cause mortality among groups according to Charlson score and age.  Results:   Men with Charlson scores ≥ 3 were treated aggressively in 54% of cases (30 of 56 men), while men aged >75 years at diagnosis were treated aggressively in 16% of cases (7 of 44 men). In multivariate analysis, age >75 years was a much stronger predictor of nonaggressive treatment (relative risk, 12.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4-28.3) than a Charlson score ≥ 3 (relative risk, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9). In survival analysis, men with Charlson scores ≥ 3 had an 8-fold increased risk (hazard ratio, 8.4; 95% CI, 4.2-16.6) and 70% probability of other-cause mortality at 10 years, whereas age >75 years was associated with a 5-fold increased risk (hazard ratio, 4.9; 95%CI, 1.7-13.8) and a 24% probability of other-cause mortality.

The consequences of these fungal infections are occasionally serious. However, the efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis in patients receiving corticosteroid treatment has not been well investigated, even though they are susceptible to severe fungal infections. Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated the prophylactic efficacy of an antifungal agent-oral itraconazole solution (ITCZ-OS)-for immunosuppressed patients receiving corticosteroids in a single institution. Of 39 patients, 18 received prophylaxis with ITCZ-OS at a dose of 200 mg/day, and 21 did not. As a result, no fungal infections developed in the prophylactic group, but 7 of the 21 patients (33%) in the non-prophylactic group suffered from fungal infections consisting of 3 non-invasive candidiases, 2 invasive candidiases, and 2 invasive pulmonary aspergilloses. Among the non-prophylactic group, aging and hypoalbuminemia were statistically significantly associated with incidence of invasive fungal infections. Of the four patients with invasive fungal infections, three had concomitant chronic illness such as diabetes. Toxicity among the prophylactic group was not statistically significantly different from that of the non-prophylactic group. In addition, none needed discontinuation of the drug.

Results:   Fifty-five patients were included; 25 each in group 1 and 2. The group 3 was prematurely closed after 5 cases due to perceived inappropriateness of needle characteristics of the suture material. Therefore, the statistical analysis was performed between group 1 and 2 only. Preoperative characteristics including age, PSA, clinical stage, and biopsy grade were similar between the groups. The anastomosis time was significantly less in group 2 (8.4 ± 1.7 min vs. 14.3 ± 4.8 min; P = 0.0001; t test).

However, there is insufficient research on older-adult survivors and more complex transformations.  Objective:   Consistent with nursing researchers' views about the duality of cancer survivor experiences, this research examined both positive and negative posttraumatic transformations (PTTs) among long-term survivors. Demographic, stress, and appraisal-related predictors of transformations were considered.  Methods:   Using cross-sectional survey design, interviews were conducted with 288 survivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. The sample, obtained from a hospital tumor registry, was 58% female, 33% African American, and 67% white (mean age, 72.5 [SD, 7.6] years). Demographic characteristics, cumulative stress exposure, appraisals of stress, and self-reported PTTs were measured.  Results:   Most respondents reported diverse transformations attributed to their illness experience. Demographic characteristics and stress appraisals were more strongly associated with PTT outcomes than was cumulative stress exposure. Appraisals of the cancer experience as stressful, as generating worry, and as stigmatizing were significantly associated with diverse PTT outcomes.  Conclusion:   Many long-term older cancer survivors report PTT reflecting altered perspectives on life. Posttraumatic transformations are related to the view that cancer is a continuing worrisome and stigmatizing experience.  Implications for practice:   Nurses have a unique opportunity to discuss with patients the potentially life-changing nature of the cancer experience in a manner that allows for understanding and acceptance of complex changes, incorporating benefit finding along with acknowledgement of loss and suffering.

Results:   At 3 months, 73.9% and 29.7% of patients had recovered urinary and sexual function, respectively. Bladder neck preservation was associated with early recovery of both urinary and sexual function (P < .01). The quality of nerve sparing (P = .01), seminal vesicle sparing (P = .03), and the use of urethral suspension (P = .04) were associated with early recovery of sexual function.  Conclusions:   Early functional recovery for patients undergoing robotic-assisted prostatectomy varies by both patient characteristics and process measures.

The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in KLK7/ KLK11 expression in paired cancer/benign prostate foci and to determine possible associations with clinicopathological parameters. Seventy archived paraffin-embedded tissue samples obtained from radical prostatectomy were stained for KLK7, KLK11, PSA and PSMA and expression was evaluated semiquantitatively. The results showed statistically significant differences for all studied proteins between BPH and CaP foci. Both KLK7 (P=0.026) and KLK11 (P<0.001) expressions were decreased in prostate cancer cells compared to normal/benign prostate cells. Positive correlations were found for both KLK7 (Rs=0.74, P<0.001) and KLK11 (Rs=0.35, P=0.003) between CaP and BPH. We found a statistically significant upregulation of KLK11 in advanced cases compared to localized ones (P=0.026). For the first time, we report lower expression of KLK11 in CaP compared to BPH and slight upregulation of KLK11 in advanced tumors compared to localized ones.

To overcome the limitations of 2D TRUS-guided biopsy systems when targeting preplanned locations, systems have been developed with 3D guidance to improve the accuracy of cancer detection. Prostate deformation due to needle insertion and biopsy gun firing is a potential source of error that can cause target misalignments during biopsies.  Methods:   The authors used nonrigid registration of 2D TRUS images to quantify the deformation that occurs during the needle insertion and the biopsy gun firing procedure and compare this effect in biopsies performed using a hand-held TRUS probe to those performed using a mechanically assisted 3D TRUS-guided biopsy system. The authors calculated a spatially varying 95% confidence interval on the prostate tissue motion and analyzed this motion both as a function of distance to the biopsy needle and as a function of distance to the lower piercing point of the prostate. The former is relevant because biopsy targets lie along the needle axis, and the latter is of particular importance due to the reported high concentration of prostate cancer in the peripheral zone, a substantial portion of which lies on the posterior side of the prostate where biopsy needles enter the prostate after penetrating the rectal wall during transrectal biopsy.  Results:   The results show that for both systems, the tissue deformation is such that throughout the length of the needle axis, including regions proximal to the lower piercing point, spherical tumors with a radius of 2.1 mm or more can be sampled with 95% confidence under the assumption of zero error elsewhere in the biopsy system. More deformation was observed in the direction orthogonal to the needle axis compared to the direction parallel to the needle axis; this is of particular importance given the long, narrow shape of the biopsy core. The authors measured lateral tissue motion proximal to the needle axis of not more than 1.5 mm, with 95% confidence. The authors observed a statistically significant and clinically insignificant maximum difference of 0.38 mm in the deformation, resulting from the hand-held and mechanically assisted systems along the needle axis, and the mechanical system resulted in a lower relative increase in deformation proximal to the needle axis during needle insertion, as well as lower variability of deformation during biopsy gun firing.  Conclusions:   Given the clinical need to biopsy tumors of volume greater than or equal to 0.5 cm3, corresponding to spherical tumors with a radius of 5 mm or more, the tissue motion induced by needle insertion and gun firing is an important consideration when setting the design specifications for TRUS-guided prostate biopsy systems.""","""['Tharindu De Silva', 'Aaron Fenster', 'Jeffrey Bax', 'Cesare Romagnoli', 'Jonathan Izawa', 'Jagath Samarabandu', 'Aaron D Ward']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', '2D-3D rigid registration to compensate for prostate motion during 3D TRUS-guided biopsy.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'Massive rectal bleeding following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Considerations for patient selection for focal therapy.', 'Towards ultrasound probe positioning optimization during prostate needle biopsy using pressure feedback.', 'Geometric evaluation of systematic transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.']"""

Using low dose rate seeds and an electronic brachytherapy source (EBS), the authors quantify the large cavity theory conversion factors required. The authors also assess whether ap plying large cavity theory utilizing the sources' initial photon spectra and average photon energy induces errors related to spatial spectral variations. First, ideal spherical geometries were investigated, followed by clinical brachytherapy LDR seed implants for breast and prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Two types of dose calculations are performed with the GEANT4 MC code. (1) For several human tissues, dose profiles are obtained in spherical geometries centered on four types of low energy brachytherapy sources: 125I, 103Pd, and 131Cs seeds, as well as an EBS operating at 50 kV. Ratios of D(w,m) over D(m,m) are evaluated in the 0-6 cm range. In addition to mean tissue composition, compositions corresponding to one standard deviation from the mean are also studied. (2) Four clinical breast (using 103Pd) and prostate (using 125I) brachytherapy seed implants are considered. MC dose calculations are performed based on postimplant CT scans using prostate and breast tissue compositions. PTV D90 values are compared for D(w,m) and D(m,m).  Results:   (1) Differences (D(w,m)/D(m,m)-1) of -3% to 70% are observed for the investigated tissues. For a given tissue, D(w,m)/D(m,m) is similar for all sources within 4% and does not vary more than 2% with distance due to very moderate spectral shifts. Variations of tissue composition about the assumed mean composition influence the conversion factors up to 38%. (2) The ratio of D90(w,m) over D90(m,m) for clinical implants matches D(w,m)/D(m,m) at 1 cm from the single point sources,  Conclusions:   Given the small variation with distance, using conversion factors based on the emitted photon spectrum (or its mean energy) of a given source introduces minimal error. The large differences observed between scoring schemes underline the need for guidelines on choice of media for dose reporting.

Node positions are preprogramed locations where the robot can position the focal spot of the x-ray beam. As the time needed for the robot to travel between node positions takes up a large part of the treatment time, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a node reduction technique in order to reduce the treatment time per fraction for robotic radiosurgery.  Methods:   Node reduction was integrated into the inverse planning algorithm, developed in-house for the robotic radiosurgery modality. It involved repeated inverse optimization, each iteration excluding low-contribution node positions from the planning and resampling new candidate beams from the remaining node positions. Node reduction was performed until the exclusion of a single node position caused a constraint violation, after which the shortest treatment plan was selected retrospectively. Treatment plans were generated with and without node reduction for two lung cases of different complexity, one oropharyngeal case and one prostate case. Plan quality was assessed using the number of node positions, beams and MUs, and the estimated treatment time per fraction. All treatment plans had to fulfill all clinical dose constraints. Extra constraints were added to maintain the low-dose conformality and restrict skin doses during node reduction.  Results:   Node reduction resulted in 12 residual node positions, on average (reduction by 77%), at the cost of an increase in the number of beams and total MUs of 28% and 9%, respectively. Overall fraction durations (excluding patient setup) were shortened by 25% (range of 18%-40%), on average. Dose distributions changed only little and dose in low-dose regions was effectively restricted by the additional constraints.  Conclusions:   The fraction duration of robotic radiosurgery treatments can be reduced considerably by node reduction with minimal changes in dosimetrical plan quality. Additional constraints are required to guarantee low-dose conformality and to avoid unacceptable skin dose.""","""['Steven van de Water', 'Mischa S Hoogeman', 'Sebastiaan Breedveld', 'Ben J M Heijmen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Variable circular collimator in robotic radiosurgery: a time-efficient alternative to a mini-multileaf collimator?', 'Reducing monitor units for robotic radiosurgery by optimized use of multiple collimators.', 'Inverse treatment planning for spinal robotic radiosurgery: an international multi-institutional benchmark trial.', 'Feasibility of case-based beam generation for robotic radiosurgery.', 'Computer aided robotic radiosurgery.', 'Applying pytorch toolkit to plan optimization for circular cone based robotic radiotherapy.', 'A new plan quality objective function for determining optimal collimator combinations in prostate cancer treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy using CyberKnife.', 'Comparison of multileaf collimator and conventional circular collimator systems in Cyberknife stereotactic radiotherapy.', 'A phantom study to determine the optimum size of a single collimator for shortening the treatment time in CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery of spherical targets.']"""

In the present work, the results of long-term immunological monitoring of the liquidators of consequences of the failure at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChN PP) living in the Northwest region of Russia are analyzed; we also heve made an attempt to reveal the predictors of oncological diseases in this group of individuals.

Regarding the frequency of separate MN localizations, lung cancer, cancer of stomach and cancer of prostate gland predominated, which corresponds to the world's tendency of MN prevalence. It has been established that as early as 1-3 years before diagnosis of MN is confirmed in liquidators, a number of changes in the immune status comes to light: drop in percentage of CD3+ and CD4(+)-T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes to a lesser extent, decrease in the CD4+/CD8+ index, increase of the relative and absolute content of CD16(+)-lymphocytes, increase of absolute content of CD8(+)-T-lymphocytes, prevalence of CD3+16/56+(NK-T) cell over CD3-16/56+(NK) cells, rise of the activity of phagocytes.

Nkx3.1 expression is induced by androgen in prostate epithelia and, as such, our interest is to understand the mechanism(s) for this androgen-dependent expression in normal epithelial cells. In this report, we show that the region of DNA sequence 2.7 kilobases in front of the mouse Nkx3.1 gene drives enhanced transcription in prostate epithelia cells; however, this segment was not capable of androgen-directed regulation. Among the multiple, potential androgen response elements (AREs) identified by scanning sequences near and within the gene, two sequences within the intron of the murine Nkx3.1 gene were demonstrated to confer androgen-dependent transcription in reporter gene transfection experiments. Each of the elements, termed ARE A and ARE B, contained a 6-base pair core sequence, TGTTCT, that has been described as an androgen receptor half-site binding sequence, separated by 498 base pairs of DNA.

Studies by a number of laboratories including our own have shown that type II sites are present in the rodent prostate gland and therefore, we suspected that administration of bioflavonoids such as luteolin may antagonize prostate growth through type LT site binding interactions as well. The studies presented in this report demonstrate that the mouse prostatic tissue does contain nuclear type II sites and that oral administration of luteolin for 14 days results in a significant (p<0.01) reduction in prostatic weight in intact male mice without significant effects on the seminal vesicular, testis or body weights of these animals. These results suggest that luteolin is a prostate specific antagonist under these experimental conditions. In vitro studies with LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated that luteolin treatment resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation which was maximum 4-8 days following treatment. Whole cell binding studies demonstrated that both LNCaP and PC-3 cells contained very high concentrations of type II [H-3]estradiol binding sites (>200,000 sites/cell) relative to levels previously reported for other tissues and cells and luteolin was capable of interacting with these sites in prostate cancer cells. In fact, there was a direct correlation between the type II site occupancy by luteolin and the inhibition of LNCaP or PC-3 prostatic cancer cell proliferation by this bioflavonoid. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that luteolin treatment caused an accumulation of LNCaP cells in G(2)/M (p<0.01) and reduced the fractions of LNCaP cells in S-phase undergoing apoptosis (p<0.01). Similarly, luteolin treatment also arrested PC-3 cells in G(2)/M (p<0.01) and reduced the proportion of cells in G(0)/G(1) (p<0.05). This being the case, it is not surprising that this bioflavonoid also blocked the growth of subcutaneous PC-3 cell xenografts in athymic nude mice. These data demonstrate that naturally occurring type TI site antagonists such as luteolin are capable of inhibiting normal and malignant prostatic cell growth and proliferation in vitro and in viva and may possess prophylactic as well as therapeutic activities against prostatic proliferative diseases including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer.""","""['B Markaverich', 'M Alejandro']""","""[]""","""1997""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Multiple Sites of Type II Site Ligand (Luteolin and BMHPC) Regulation of Gene Expression in PC-3 Cells.', 'Type II 3Hestradiol binding site antagonists: inhibition of normal and malignant prostate cell growth and proliferation.', 'Downregulation of androgen receptor expression by luteolin causes inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells and xenografts.', 'Bioflavonoid interaction with rat uterine type II binding sites and cell growth inhibition.', 'Preliminary assessment of luteolin as an affinity ligand for type II estrogen--binding sites in rat uterine nuclear extracts.', 'Multiple Sites of Type II Site Ligand (Luteolin and BMHPC) Regulation of Gene Expression in PC-3 Cells.', 'Luteolin Regulation of Estrogen Signaling and Cell Cycle Pathway Genes in MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Luteolin and gefitinib regulation of EGF signaling pathway and cell cycle pathway genes in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of cell cycle and RNA transcription genes identified by microarray analysis of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells treated with luteolin.', 'Anti-carcinogenic effects of the flavonoid luteolin.']"""

At necropsy, 27/74 (36%) mice injected with DU145 cells and 41/75 (55%) injected with PC-3M cells had either invasive macroscopic tumors, or microscopic intraprostatic tumor cell nests (p = 0.02). Para-aortic lymph node metastases had occurred in 19% of the DU145 cell, and 44% of the PC-3M cell tumor-bearing animals (p = 0.033). Immunohistochemical staining showed high mutant p53 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by DU145 cells; PC-3M cells did not express detectable p53, and had relatively low VEGF immunohistochemical reactivity. Assays by ELISA established a statistically significant difference in VEGF levels between the cell lines (p < 0.001). Urokinase-like plasminogen activator (uPA) levels, determined by ELISA, were ten-fold higher in the PC-3M cell tumors, as were matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activities assessed by zymography. These findings of high expression of uPA and MMP-9, two key proteolytic enzymes in the invasive/metastatic process, by PC-3M cell prostatic tumors are consistent with their aggressive behavior; the low VEGF levels compared with those in the poorly metastatic DU145 cell tumors suggest that other angiogenic factors may be critical for prostate cancer cell progression in this model.""","""['J Connolly', 'X Sun', 'D Rose']""","""[]""","""1997""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Angiogenesis in two human prostate cancer cell lines with differing metastatic potential when growing as solid tumors in nude mice.', 'Metastatic model for human prostate cancer using orthotopic implantation in nude mice.', 'Selection of highly metastatic variants of different human prostatic carcinomas using orthotopic implantation in nude mice.', 'Blockade of NF-kappaB activity in human prostate cancer cells is associated with suppression of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.', 'Human prostate tumor angiogenesis in nude mice: metalloprotease and plasminogen activator activities during tumor growth and neovascularization of subcutaneously injected matrigel impregnated with human prostate tumor cells.', 'Upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by cobalt chloride-simulated hypoxia is mediated by persistent induction of cyclooxygenase-2 in a metastatic human prostate cancer cell line.']"""
