Because of some limitations of EUS-FNA in diagnosis of well-differentiated or early stage cancers, the purpose of this study is to assess the added benefit of immunohistochemistry. We studied five proteins overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, namely, prostate stem cell antigen, fascin, 14-3-3 sigma, mesothelin and S100P utilizing immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections from cellblocks obtained by EUS-FNA. Sixty-two cases of EUS-FNA of the pancreas that had follow-up histological and/or clinical diagnosis and sufficient material in cell blocks were included. Using histological diagnosis and/or clinical outcome as the reference standard, EUS-FNA shows the highest sensitivity (95%) and specificity (91%) and is superior to any marker in this study. Among five antibodies, S100P reveals the best diagnostic characters showing 90% of sensitivity and 67% of specificity. Fascin shows high specificity (92%) but low sensitivity (38%). Mesothelin has a moderate sensitivity (74%) and low specificity (33%), PSCA and 14-3-3 show high sensitivity but zero specificity. S100P and mesothelin were useful in nine indeterminate cases. S100P correctly predicted six of seven cancers and one of one without cancer and mesothelin correctly diagnosed five of seven cancers and one of two noncancers in this group. EUS-FNA cytomorphology is superior to any of the immunohistochemical markers used in this study. Use of S100P and mesothelin in cytologically borderline cases can increase the diagnostic accuracy in this group.""","""['Daniel C Dim', 'Feng Jiang', 'Qi Qiu', 'Ting Li', 'Peter Darwin', 'William H Rodgers', 'Hong Qi Peng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Diagn Cytopathol""","""['Novel quantitative analysis of the S100P protein combined with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'S100P and XIAP expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: potential novel biomarkers as a diagnostic adjunct to fine needle aspiration cytology.', 'Novel markers of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in fine-needle aspiration: mesothelin and prostate stem cell antigen labeling increases accuracy in cytologically borderline cases.', 'Primary pancreatic leiomyosarcoma with metastasis to the liver diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and fine needle biopsy: A Case Report and Review of Literature.', 'Needle Tract Seeding: An Overlooked Rare Complication of Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration.', 'Fascin-1: Updated biological functions and therapeutic implications in cancer biology.', 'Comparison between three types of needles for endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition of pancreatic solid masses: a multicenter observational study.', 'Role of Maspin, CK17 and Ki-67 Immunophenotyping in Diagnosing of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma in Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology.', 'S100 Proteins in Pancreatic Cancer: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives.', 'Emerging Role of Fascin-1 in the Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment of the Gastrointestinal Cancers.']"""

The aim of this study was to determine whether rs2294008 polymorphism is associated with risk of gastric cancer in a Korean population. We conducted a large-scale case-control study of 3,245 gastric cancer patients and 1,700 controls. The frequencies of the CC, CT, and TT genotypes of rs2294008 polymorphism were 17.8%, 49.9%, and 32.3% in the gastric cancer patients; and 24.4%, 48.1%, and 27.5% in the controls, respectively. We found that the CT and TT genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of gastric cancer (OR(CT) = 1.50, 95% confidence intervals, 95% CI: 1.28-1.76; OR(TT) = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.43-2.04), compared with the CC genotype. Further, stratified by tumor location and histological type, the effect of the rs2294008 T allele was larger in cardia (OR(TT) = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.42-4.85) than non-cardia (OR(TT) = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.40-2.00), in diffuse-type (OR(TT) = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.55-2.59) than in intestinal-type (OR(TT) = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.22-1.86).

Materials and methods:   This prospective mapping study included 19 patients with high-risk PCa (sharing at least two out of the three following parameters: PSA >20 ng/ml, cT3, biopsy Gleason score ≥8). All patients were treated with RP, ePLND (removal of the obturator, hypogastric, external iliac, presacral, and common iliac lymph nodes) and rLND (removal of para-aortal/para-caval and inter-aorto-caval lymph nodes) by a single surgeon. All patients signed an informed consent highlighting the absence of clinical data supporting the benefit of this surgical approach.  Results:   Overall, 18 out of 19 patients (94.7%) had pelvic lymph node invasion. The most commonly affected pelvic nodal landing site was obturator (88.8%), followed by external iliac (83.3%), common iliac (77%), hypogastric (44.4%), and presacral (33.3%). Moreover, 14 (77.8%) patients also had involvement of retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Only patients with positive common iliac lymph nodes having at least five positive lower pelvic lymph nodes (n = 14), also had invariably positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes. No patients with negative common iliac lymph nodes had positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

This study compares RAIRS with conventionally reported incidence rates for prostate cancer.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort design was used, based on data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries, with focus on white and black malignant prostate cancer cases in the years 2000-2007. RAIRs use only the first primary cancer and adjust for cancer prevalence in order to obtain a better population-based measure of cancer risk.  Results:   Conventionally reported prostate cancer incidence rates underestimate risk for white males by from 0.1% in the age group 40-49 to 20.1% in the age group 80 years and older. In black males, conventional rates underestimate risk by 0.2% in the age group 30-39 to 26.4% in the age group 80 years and older. Trends in RAIRs from 2000 to 2007 increased in the age group 30-49 (17.0% for whites and 14.8% for blacks), decreased in the age group 50-69 (-4.5% for whites and -5.9% for blacks), and decreased in the age group 70 and older (-15.8% for whites and -26.5% for blacks). Trends in RAIRs were similar or less pronounced than trends in conventional rates. The estimated number of cases in the United States in 2007 based on RAIRS was 9.0% greater for whites and 11.3% greater for blacks than when based on conventional rates.

Methods:   The MTT assay was utilized to assess cell viability. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. Protein expression levels were examined by Western blotting.  Results:   Alternol treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the viability of prostate cancer cells but had lesser effects on prostate cells. Alternol inhibited AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in prostate cancer C4-2 cells but stimulated AMPK phosphorylation in prostate RWPE-1 cells. Inhibition of p27 phosphorylation was observed in C4-2 cells whereas a promotion of p27 phosphorylation was seen in RWPE-1 cells. Alternol treatment resulted in a profound increase in the LC3II/LC3I protein ratio in RWPE-1 cells but not in C4-2 cells. A dose-dependent down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein was detected in C4-2 cells but not in RWPE-1 cells. Pretreatment of cells with Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) before Alternol treatment abolished the selective antitumor effect of Alternol.

Screening for PC leads to increased detection of these insignificant cancers. Objective of this study is to compare PC detected by PSA screening at subsequent screening rounds and treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) with PC incidentally found in cystoprostatectomy specimens.  Methods:   Radical prostatectomy specimens of 617 screen-detected PC were compared with 123 PC identified in cystoprostatectomy specimens. Surgical specimens were systematically examined and stage, grade, tumor volume were recorded. Next, we classified PC as clinically significant or insignificant (i.e., tumor volume <0.5 cm(3), absence of Gleason pattern 4/5, organ confined). Pathological features of incidentally detected PC were compared with PC detected in subsequent screening rounds and with screen-detected T1c PC.  Results:   Screen-detected PC overall were more often multifocal, larger in volume, more advanced in tumor stage and of higher grade, while the frequency of insignificant PC was lower as compared to those in cystoprostatectomy specimens. This effect became more pronounced during subsequent screening rounds. Screen-detected T1c PC were also more often multifocal (73% vs. 37%) in average fivefold larger (0.85 cm(3) vs. 0.16 cm(3)), less often organ confined (81% vs. 94%), and less frequently clinically insignificant (33% vs. 81%).

Methods:   We developed a dual-labeled targeting agent having a near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore for intraoperative guidance, and a conventional radiotracer for detection of LN metastasis. Nu/Nu mice were orthotopically implanted with DsRed-expressing human PCa (PC3) cells. Antibody (Ab) specific for epithelial cell adhesion molecule was conjugated to DOTA, IRDye 800CW, and radiolabeled with (64) Cu. Dual-labeled Ab was administered intravenously at 10-12 weeks post-implantation, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and fluorescence imaging were performed within 18-24 hr.  Results:   Metastasis to lumbar LNs was detected by DsRed fluorescence imaging, as well as pathology, in 75% of mice having pathology-confirmed primary prostate tumors. These metastases were also detected by NIR fluorescence imaging. In some cases, metastases to sciatic, medial, renal, and axillary nodes were also detected.

Our aim was to investigate variations of TP53INP1 expression and their correlation to clinicopathological parameters in PC.  Methods:   Quantitative measurements of immunohistochemical expression of TP53INP1 using high-throughput densitometry, assessed on digitized microscopic tissue micro-array images, were correlated with clinicopathological parameters in 91 human PC. Treatment of LNCaP tumor cells in vitro with cytokines and with TP53INP1 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was also analyzed.  Results:   In normal prostate tissues, TP53INP1 is only expressed in prostate basal cells. There is a de novo TP53INP1 expression in prostate luminal cells in inflammatory prostate tissues, high grade PIN lesions and in PC. Stimulation of LNCaP cells with inflammatory cytokines enhances the level of TP53INP1 mRNA. In PC, TP53INP1 overexpression correlates with high Gleason grade, unfavorable D'Amico score and lymph node invasion, and is an independent factor of biological cancer relapse. Moreover, treatment of LNCaP cells with a TP53INP1 ASO down-regulates TP53INP1 protein level, inhibits proliferation, and induces apoptosis.  Conclusion:   TP53INP1 overexpression in PC seems to be a worse prognostic factor, particularly predictive of biological cancer relapse. Results in vitro suggest that TP53INP1 could be considered as a relevant target for potential specific therapy.""","""['Sophie Giusiano', 'Stéphane Garcia', 'Claudia Andrieu', 'Nelson Javier Dusetti', 'Cyrille Bastide', 'Martin Gleave', 'Colette Taranger-Charpin', 'Juan Lucio Iovanna', 'Palma Rocchi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['TP53INP1 as new therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of high mobility group box 1 with poor prognosis in patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'ADAM9 expression is a significant and independent prognostic marker of PSA relapse in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of Fn14 promotes androgen-independent prostate cancer progression through MMP-9 and correlates with poor treatment outcome.', 'The stress protein TP53INP1 plays a tumor suppressive role by regulating metabolic homeostasis.', 'Changes in the Transcriptome Caused by Mutations in the Ribosomal Protein uS10 Associated with a Predisposition to Colorectal Cancer.', 'MicroRNAs as Epigenetic Determinants of Treatment Response and Potential Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer.', 'miR-205: A Potential Biomedicine for Cancer Therapy.', 'DHA Affects Microtubule Dynamics Through Reduction of Phospho-TCTP Levels and Enhances the Antiproliferative Effect of T-DM1 in Trastuzumab-Resistant HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'MiR-155-5p accelerates the metastasis of cervical cancer cell via targeting TP53INP1.']"""

Sanguinarine, a benzophenanthridine alkaloid derived primarily from the bloodroot plant, was identified previously as a novel inhibitor of survivin that selectively kills prostate cancer cells over ""normal"" prostate epithelial cells.  Methods:   DU145, C4-2B, and LNCaP cells were treated with sanguinarine. The phosphorylation status of Stat3 and related proteins were measured with Western blots. Activation of transcription by Stat3 was measured with luciferase reporter assay. The effect of sanguinarine on anchorage-independent growth was examined with soft agar assay, and on cell migration and invasion of DU145 cells were measured with scratch assay and invasion assay, respectively.  Results:   In this study, we identified sanguinarine as a potent inhibitor of Stat3 activation which was able to suppress prostate cancer growth, migration, and invasion. Sanguinarine inhibits constitutive as well as IL6-induced phosphorylation of Stat3 at both Tyr705 and Ser727 in prostate cancer cells. The inhibition of Stat3 phosphorylation by sanguinarine correlates with reduction of Janus-activated Kinase 2 (Jak2) and Src phosphorylation. Sanguinarine downregulates the expression of Stat3-mediated genes such as c-myc and survivin and inhibits the Stat3 responsive element luciferase reporter activity. Sanguinarine inhibits the anchorage-independent growth of DU145 and LN-S17 cells expressing constitutively activated Stat3. Migration and invasion abilities of DU145 cells were also inhibited by sanguinarine in a manner similar to the dominant negative form of Stat3.  Conclusions:   These data demonstrate that sanguinarine is a potent Stat3 inhibitor and it could be developed as a therapeutic agent for prostate cancer with constitutive activation of Stat3.""","""['Meng Sun', 'Chengfei Liu', 'Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Wei Lou', 'Yezi Zhu', 'Joy Yang', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Qinghua Zhou', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Scoparone exerts anti-tumor activity against DU145 prostate cancer cells via inhibition of STAT3 activity.', 'Cryptotanshinone inhibits constitutive signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 function through blocking the dimerization in DU145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Sulforaphane inhibits constitutive and interleukin-6-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Sanguinarine and Its Role in Chronic Diseases.', 'Sanguinarine: A Double-Edged Sword of Anticancer and Carcinogenesis and Its Future Application Prospect.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Ectopic JAK-STAT activation enables the transition to a stem-like and multilineage state conferring AR-targeted therapy resistance.', 'Sanguinarine Inhibition of TNF-α-Induced CCL2, IKBKE/NF-κB/ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway, and Cell Migration in Human Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Dual STAT‑3 and IL‑6R inhibition with stattic and tocilizumab decreases migration, invasion and proliferation of prostate cancer cells by targeting the IL‑6/IL‑6R/STAT‑3 axis.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of Cell Cycle-Related Genes in Patients With Prostate Cancer.']"""

CD10 is a cell surface metallopeptidase that has been suggested to play a role in prostate cancer progression.

All patients underwent radical prostatectomy and standardized extended lymphadenectomy. They had no neoadjuvant therapy and received deferred androgen deprivation. In the primary tumor, high CD10 expression was significantly associated with earlier death from disease when compared with low CD10 expression (5-year survival 73.7% vs. 91.8%; p = 0.043). In the metastases, a high CD10 expression was significantly associated with larger total size of metastases (median 11.4 vs. 6.5 mm; p = 0.015), earlier death of disease (5-year survival 71.5% vs. 87.3%; p = 0.017), and death of any cause (5-year survival 70.0% vs. 87.2%; p = 0.001) when compared with low CD10 expression. CD10 expression in the metastases added independent prognostic information for overall survival (p = 0.029) after adjustment for Gleason score of the primary tumor, nodal tumor burden, and resection margins. In conclusion, a high CD10 expression in prostate cancer predicts early death.

Fatigue is one such symptom which reduces overall quality of life and is difficult to manage. The purpose of this study was to report the presence, severity, and correlating factors of fatigue in advanced cancer patients attending an outpatient palliative radiotherapy clinic.  Materials/methods:   Patients referred to the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program between January 1999 and October 2009 completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) prior to consultation. Demographic information including age, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), gender, and primary cancer sites were collected. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine relationships between demographic information, other ESAS items, and levels of fatigue. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to determine the most significant predictors of fatigue. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   A total of 1,397 patients completed the ESAS prior to consultation. Median age was 68 years (range, 21-95), median KPS was 60 (range, 10-100), and slightly more males completed the ESAS (53.0%). Common primary cancers were of the lung (35.8%), breast (20.7%), and prostate (17.7%). Only 179 (12.8%) patients reported no fatigue; the majority of patients reported moderate (31.8%) or severe (34.4%) fatigue. A low KPS (p < 0.0001), being female (p = 0.0056), or being referred for bone metastases (p = 0.0185) significantly correlated with higher levels of fatigue. Patients with a genitourinary primary cancer (p = 0.0078) and/or referred for malignant spinal cord compression (p = 0.0004) reported less fatigue. All other ESAS items were significantly related to fatigue. The most significant predictors of fatigue were pain (p < 0.0001, odds ratio (OR) = 1.07), nausea (p = 0.0010, OR = 1.10), depression (p < 0.0001, OR = 1.10), drowsiness (p < 0.0001, OR = 1.33), dyspnea (p = 0.0003, OR = 1.08), and overall well-being (p < 0.0001, OR = 1.19).  Conclusion:   Moderate fatigue was reported in over 66% of our advanced cancer patients prior to radiotherapy. Since radiotherapy inherently causes fatigue, proactive and multidisciplinary management is required for these patients. Similar rates of fatigue severity, in lengthier, fatigue-specific tools, suggest that the ESAS may be a good tool for screening the advanced cancer population.""","""['Liang Zeng', 'Kaitlin Koo', 'Liying Zhang', 'Florencia Jon', 'Kristopher Dennis', 'Lori Holden', 'Janet Nguyen', 'May Tsao', 'Elizabeth Barnes', 'Cyril Danjoux', 'Arjun Sahgal', 'Edward Chow']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Impact of outpatient palliative care (PC) on symptom burden in patients with advanced cancer at a tertiary cancer center in Jordan.', 'Predictive factors for well-being in advanced cancer patients referred for palliative radiotherapy.', 'Impact of dyspnea on advanced cancer patients referred to a palliative radiotherapy clinic.', 'A review of the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program in patients with advanced cancer referred for palliative radiotherapy over two decades.', 'The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System: A narrative review of a standardized symptom assessment tool in head and neck oncology.', 'Exploring the Use of Two Brief Fatigue Screening Tools in Cancer Outpatient Clinics.', 'Sex-specific and gender-specific aspects in patient-reported outcomes.', 'Patient-reported symptoms and performance status before palliative radiotherapy in geriatric cancer patients (octogenarians).', 'Pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression in older home-dwelling people with cancer.', 'Quality of life of Moroccan patients on the palliative phase of advanced cancer.']"""

Undetectable PSA was defined as 0.04 ng ml(-1). BCR was defined as PSA 0.2 ng ml(-1) or initiation of salvage radiation therapy (SRT) for progressively rising PSA. At 54 months mean follow-up (range 3-114 months), 9 (2%) of the 448 men developed BCR. Mean time to BCR was 63 months (range 12-93) and mean PSA doubling time was 15 months (range 6-27). Six underwent SRT, two elected surveillance and one was lost to follow-up. All men undergoing SRT exhibited more than 75% reduction in pre-SRT PSA, indicating the presence of local disease recurrence. All men undergoing SRT maintained PSA levels <0.1 at last follow-up. The BCR of 2% confirmed that we selected a cohort with extremely low risk for BCR after RP.

This hypothesis was tested in a randomized phase III double-blind study of daily soy (40 g), vitamin E (800 U), and selenium (200 μg) versus placebo.  Patients and methods:   Three hundred three men in 12 Canadian centers were analyzed. The main eligibility criterion was confirmed HGPIN in at least one of two biopsies within 18 months of random assignment. Treatment was administered daily for 3 years. Follow-up prostate biopsies occurred at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postrandomization. The primary end point was time to development of invasive PCa.

The median baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA; n = 302) was 5.41 ug/L; total testosterone (n = 291) was 13.4 nmol/L. Invasive PCa developed among 26.4% of patients. The hazard ratio for the nutritional supplement to prevent PCa was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.60; P = .88). Gleason score distribution was similar in both groups with 83.5% of cancers graded Gleason sum of 6. Baseline age, weight, PSA, and testosterone did not predict for development of PCa.

We reasoned that by identifying an mRNA signature of Gleason grade, the best predictor of prognosis, we could improve prediction of lethal disease among men with moderate Gleason 7 tumors, the most common grade, and the most indeterminate in terms of prognosis.  Patients and methods:   Using the complementary DNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension, and ligation assay, we measured the mRNA expression of 6,100 genes in prostate tumor tissue in the Swedish Watchful Waiting cohort (n = 358) and Physicians' Health Study (PHS; n = 109). We developed an mRNA signature of Gleason grade comparing individuals with Gleason ≤ 6 to those with Gleason ≥ 8 tumors and applied the model among patients with Gleason 7 to discriminate lethal cases.  Results:   We built a 157-gene signature using the Swedish data that predicted Gleason with low misclassification (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.91); when this signature was tested in the PHS, the discriminatory ability remained high (AUC = 0.94). In men with Gleason 7 tumors, who were excluded from the model building, the signature significantly improved the prediction of lethal disease beyond knowing whether the Gleason score was 4 + 3 or 3 + 4 (P = .006).  Conclusion:   Our expression signature and the genes identified may improve our understanding of the de-differentiation process of prostate tumors.

Results:   Men whose tumors had high VDR expression had significantly lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis (P for trend < .001), lower Gleason score (P for trend < .001), and less advanced tumor stage (P for trend < .001) and were more likely to have tumors harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (P for trend = .009). Compared with the lowest quartile, men whose tumors had the highest VDR expression had significantly reduced risk of lethal prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.41). This association was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for Gleason score and PSA at diagnosis (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.83) or, additionally, for tumor stage (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.94). Neither prediagnostic plasma vitamin D levels nor VDR polymorphisms were associated with VDR expression.  Conclusion:   High VDR expression in prostate tumors is associated with a reduced risk of lethal cancer, suggesting a role of the vitamin D pathway in prostate cancer progression.""","""['Whitney K Hendrickson', 'Richard Flavin', 'Julie L Kasperzyk', 'Michelangelo Fiorentino', 'Fang Fang', 'Rosina Lis', 'Christopher Fiore', 'Kathryn L Penney', 'Jing Ma', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Massimo Loda', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Edward Giovannucci']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['A prospective study of plasma vitamin D metabolites, vitamin D receptor polymorphisms, and prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin D receptor polymorphisms, circulating vitamin D metabolites, and risk of prostate cancer in United States physicians.', 'Vitamin D-related genetic variation, plasma vitamin D, and risk of lethal prostate cancer: a prospective nested case-control study.', 'Vitamin D receptor polymorphisms and cancer.', 'Genetic variants in the vitamin d receptor are associated with advanced prostate cancer at diagnosis: findings from the prostate testing for cancer and treatment study and a systematic review.', 'Immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D in various immune-related disorders: a comprehensive review.', 'Exploiting Vitamin D Receptor and Its Ligands to Target Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Head and Neck.', 'Bone Metastases of Diverse Primary Origin Frequently Express the VDR (Vitamin D Receptor) and CYP24A1.', 'The Vitamin D Receptor-BIM Axis Overcomes Cisplatin Resistance in Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Genomic Insights into Non-steroidal Nuclear Receptors in Prostate and Breast Cancer.']"""

Therefore, we aimed to clarify the anti-(18)F-FACBC transport mechanism in prostate cancer cells. We also studied the fate of anti-(18)F-FACBC after it is transported into cells.  Methods:   For convenience, because of their longer half-lives, (14)C compounds were used instead of (18)F-labeled tracers. Trans-1-amino-3-fluoro-1-(14)C-cyclobutanecarboxylic acid ((14)C-FACBC) uptake was examined in human prostate cancer DU145 cells with the following substrates of amino acid transporters: α-(methylamino) isobutyric acid (a system A-specific substrate) and 2-amino-2-norbornanecarboxylic acid (a system L-specific substrate). The messenger RNA expression of amino acid transporters in human prostate cancer specimens was analyzed by complementary DNA microarray and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Gene expression in DU145 cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR. We also examined the knockdown effect of the amino acid transporters system ASC transporter 2 (ASCT2) and sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2) on (14)C-FACBC uptake. In addition, the possibility of (14)C-FACBC incorporation into proteins was examined.  Results:   (14)C-FACBC uptake by DU145 cells was markedly decreased to approximately 20% in the absence of Na(+), compared with that in its presence, indicating that Na(+)-dependent transporters are mainly responsible for the uptake of this tracer. Moreover, 2-amino-2-norbornanecarboxylic acid inhibited the transport of (14)C-FACBC to the basal level in Na(+)-free buffer. In contrast, α-(methylamino) isobutyric acid did not inhibit (14)C-FACBC accumulation in DU145 cells. Human prostate tumor specimens and DU145 cells had similar messenger RNA expression patterns of amino acid transporter genes. Although SNAT2 and ASCT2 are 2 major amino acid transporters expressed in prostate tumor tissues and DU145 cells, ASCT2 knockdown using small interfering RNA was more effective in lowering (14)C-FACBC transport than SNAT2. Almost all intracellular (14)C-FACBC was recovered from the nonprotein fraction.  Conclusion:   ASCT2, which is a Na(+)-dependent amino acid transporter, and to a lesser extent Na(+)-independent transporters play a role in the uptake of (14)C-FACBC by DU145 cells. Among the Na(+)-independent transporters, system L transporters are also involved in the transport of (14)C-FACBC. Moreover, (14)C-FACBC is not incorporated into proteins in cells. These findings suggest a possible mechanism of anti-(18)F-FACBC PET for prostate cancer.""","""['Hiroyuki Okudaira', 'Naoto Shikano', 'Ryuichi Nishii', 'Tohru Miyagi', 'Mitsuyoshi Yoshimoto', 'Masato Kobayashi', 'Kazuyo Ohe', 'Takeo Nakanishi', 'Ikumi Tamai', 'Mikio Namiki', 'Keiichi Kawai']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Kinetic analyses of trans-1-amino-3-18Ffluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid transport in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human ASCT2 and SNAT2.', 'Comparative evaluation of transport mechanisms of trans-1-amino-3-¹⁸Ffluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid and L-methyl-¹¹Cmethionine in human glioma cell lines.', 'Transport mechanisms of trans-1-amino-3-fluoro1-(14)Ccyclobutanecarboxylic acid in prostate cancer cells.', '8-123IIodo-L-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7-hydroxyisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid.', 'Review of 18F-Fluciclovine PET for Detection of Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Landscape of prostate-specific membrane antigen heterogeneity and regulation in AR-positive and AR-negative metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Targeting glutamine metabolism as a therapeutic strategy for cancer.', 'Evaluation of L-Alanine Metabolism in Bacteria and Whole-Body Distribution with Bacterial Infection Model Mice.', 'Targeting fat mass and obesity-associated protein mitigates human colorectal cancer growth in vitro and in a murine model.', 'Single-cell image analysis reveals over-expression of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) in human glioblastoma tissue.']"""

Materials and methods:   The first questionnaire survey was conducted in 1999 with a mailing to 102 urologists, 679 community physicians and 684 occupational health physicians identified from the membership files of three medical associations. The area of residence was divided into the study area of the Finnish PC screening trial and the rest of Finland.

Results:   The response proportion was 48% in 1999 and 50% in 2007. In both rounds, urologists regarded PC as a more important public health issue than other physicians. On the other hand, the non-urologists considered early diagnosis and screening more important than the urologists. PC was rated by all physicians as a less important public health problem in 2007 than in 1999. A smaller proportion of urologists found routine PSA testing indicated for asymptomatic men, compared with other physicians (40% versus 74-60% in 1999, P < 0.001 and 35% versus 44-37% in 2007, P = 0.005). The proportion of physicians reporting regular PSA screening in asymptomatic men was reduced from 1999 to 2007 (from 18% to 9%, P < 0.0001).

We previously demonstrated that administration of BPA to female mice results in the formation of DNA adducts and proteome alterations in the mammary tissue. Here, we evaluated the ability of BPA, given with drinking water, to induce a variety of biomarker alterations in male Sprague-Dawley rats. In addition, we investigated the formation of DNA adducts in human prostate cell lines. In BPA-treated rats, no DNA damage occurred in surrogate cells including peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow erythrocytes, where no increase of single-strand DNA breaks was detectable by comet assay and the frequency of micronucleated cells was unaffected by BPA. Liver cells were positive at transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, which detects both single-strand and double-strand breaks and early stage apoptosis. BPA upregulated clusterin expression in atrophic prostate epithelial cells and induced lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa. Significant levels of DNA adducts were formed in prostate cell lines treated either with high-dose BPA for 24 h or low-dose BPA for 2 months. The BPA-related increase of DNA adducts was more pronounced in PNT1a nontumorigenic epithelial cells than in PC3 metastatic carcinoma cells.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a multifactorial tumor closely associated with genetic background and with a male preponderance over female (3:1). Previous genome-wide association studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with NPC susceptibility. Here, we sought to explore the possible association of CNVs with NPC predisposition. Utilizing genome-wide SNP-based arrays and five CNV-prediction algorithms, we identified eight regions with CNV that were significantly overrepresented in NPC patients compared with healthy controls. These CNVs included six deletions (on chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 8 and 19), and two duplications (on chromosomes 7 and 12). Among them, the CNV located at chromosome 6p21.3, with single-copy deletion of the MICA and HCP5 genes, showed the highest association with NPC. Interestingly, it was more specifically associated with an increased NPC risk among males. This gender-specific association was replicated in an independent case-control sample using a self-established deletion-specific polymerase chain reaction strategy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the role of constitutional CNVs in NPC, using a genome-wide platform. Moreover, we identified eight novel candidate regions with CNV that merit future investigation, and our results suggest that similar to neuroblastoma and prostate cancer, genetic structural variations might contribute to NPC predisposition.""","""['Ka-Po Tse', 'Wen-Hui Su', 'Min-lee Yang', 'Hsiao-Yun Cheng', 'Ngan-Ming Tsang', 'Kai-Ping Chang', 'Sheng-Po Hao', 'Yin Yao Shugart', 'Yu-Sun Chang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['A Genome Wide Study of Copy Number Variation Associated with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in Malaysian Chinese Identifies CNVs at 11q14.3 and 6p21.3 as Candidate Loci.', 'Genome-wide association study reveals multiple nasopharyngeal carcinoma-associated loci within the HLA region at chromosome 6p21.3.', 'NKG2C copy number variations in five distinct populations in mainland China and susceptibility to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).', 'Genetic susceptibility to the endemic form of NPC.', 'Genetic predisposition factors and nasopharyngeal carcinoma risk: a review of epidemiological association studies, 2000-2011: Rosetta Stone for NPC: genetics, viral infection, and other environmental factors.', 'A novel scatterplot-based method to detect copy number variation (CNV).', 'Association of Inherited Copy Number Variation in ADAM3A and ADAM5 Pseudogenes with Oropharynx Cancer Risk and Outcome.', 'A Polynesian-specific copy number variant encompassing the MICA gene associates with gout.', 'Genome-wide CNV investigation suggests a role for cadherin, Wnt, and p53 pathways in primary open-angle glaucoma.', 'Genome-Wide Sex and Gender Differences in Cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Nine plans, using 125I, 103Pd, and 131Cs alone and in combination were created retrospectively for 2 patients. Ultrasound and MRI/MRS datasets were used for treatment planning. Voxel-by-voxel BED was calculated for single- and dual-isotope plans. Equivalent uniform BED (EUBED) was used to compare plans. The MRS-positive planning target volumes (PTVi) were delineated along with PTV (prostate+5 mm), rectum, and urethra. Single-isotope implants, prescribed to conventional doses, were generated to achieve good PTV coverage. The PTVi were prospectively used to generate implants using mixtures of isotopes. For mixed-radioisotope implants, we also explored the impact on EUBED of lowering prescription doses by 15%.  Results:   The EUBED of PTVi in the setting of primary 125I implant increased 20-66% when 103Pd and 131Cs were used compared with 125I boost. Decreasing prescription dose by 15% in mixed-isotope implants results in a potential 10% reduction in urethral EUBED with preservation of PTV coverage while still boosting PTVi (up to 80%). When radiobiologic parameters corresponding to more-aggressive disease are assigned to foci, faster-decaying isotopes used in mixed implants have the potential to preserve the equivalent biological effect of mono-isotope implants considering less-aggressive disease distributed in the entire prostate.  Conclusions:   This is a hypothesis-generating study proposing a treatment paradigm that could be the middle ground between whole-gland irradiation and focal-only treatment.

Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a potent tumor suppressor and is significantly suppressed in a variety of cancers. Diverse biological effects of IGFBP-3 have been reported to be both dependent and independent of the IGF/IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) axis. The precise underlying mechanisms of IGF/IGF-IR-independent, antiproliferative actions of IGFBP-3 are yet to be elucidated. We found an inverse correlation between NF-κB activity and IGFBP-3 expression during prostate cancer progression using an in vitro prostate cancer progression model. Restoration of IGFBP-3 resulted in significant inhibition of constitutively elevated NF-κB activity in prostate cancer cells. IGFBP-3 further inhibited the expression of NF-κB-regulated angiogenic factors such as VEGF and IL-8, and cell adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. This inhibitory action of IGFBP-3 was IGF/IGF-IR-independent since IGFBP-3 mutant devoid of IGF binding affinity had a similar inhibitory effect. We identified that IGFBP-3 degrades the key NF-κB regulatory molecules-IκBα and p65-NF-κB proteins through activation of caspase-8 and -3/-7, thereby inhibiting elevated NF-κB activity in prostate cancer.

Several studies have shown that luminal acid mucin is frequently present in prostatic adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical stain (immunostaining) becomes extremely helpful in the diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma, especially in doubtful cases. However, presently, the technique is not available in most hospitals, particularly in the regional or provincial areas. Thus, luminal acid mucin and its detection by histochemical stains may be one ofthe useful tools in diagnosing prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Objective:   To determine the percentage of mucin production in prostatic adenocarcinoma from 190 radical prostatectomy and/or core biopsy specimens in the Department of Pathology, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University to compare the percentage of positivity among three different special histochemical stains (mucicarmine, Alcian blue at pH 2.5, and colloidal iron), and to determine the PSA-expression among the prostatic adenocarcinoma that produces mucin by immunohistochemical technique.  Material and method:   The present study is a retrospective study of190 cases that were diagnosed as prostatic adenocarcinoma (with any Gleason's microscopic pattern) from radical prostatectomy and/or core biopsy specimens in Department of Pathology, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University between January 2006 and May 2007. All cases were retrieved from a computer filing system of the Department. All H&E slides that contained diagnostic materials were reviewed and stained with all three different special histochemical stains. Positive cases were subsequently studied to find PSA expression by means of immunohistochemical study. Cases with microscopic variants ofprostatic adenocarcinoma and metastasis were excluded.  Results:   One hundred and seventy seven cases (93%) of these prostatic adenocarcinomas were positive for at least one of three diferent special histochemical stains for acid mucin. Among these, 167 cases (88%) were positive for mucicarmine, 157 (83%) cases were positive for Alcian blue at pH2.5, and 173 cases (91%) were positive for colloidal iron. All 177 cases were positive for PSA immunohistochemical stain.  Conclusion:   Intraluminal acid mucin and its detection by special histochemical stains is one of the useful methods (with a high percentage of positivity) in diagnosing prostatic adenocarcinoma in association with other architectural and cytological criteria. Mucicarmine and colloidal iron stains appear to be more useful than Alcian blue at pH 2.5 stain according to their positivity percentage. However in pathologic practice, mucicarmine stain is more commonly used than colloid iron stain due to the difficulty in preparation and interpretation of the latter There is no correlation between mucin production and PSA expression in prostatic adenocarcinoma but PSA immunohistochemical stain is still useful to confirm the prostatic origin of poorly differentiated carcinomas or metastatic lesions.""","""['Siroth Noiwan', 'Samrerng Rattanarapee']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Med Assoc Thai""","""['Intestinal-type mucinous adenocarcinoma arising from the prostatic duct.', 'Mucin-producing tumors and tumor-like lesions involving the prostate: a comprehensive review.', 'A case report: mucinous carcinoma of prostate.', 'Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a case report.', 'Distorted rectal tissue on prostate needle biopsy: a mimicker of prostate cancer.']"""

We present a novel computational approach, called Sample Progression Discovery (SPD), to discover patterns of biological progression underlying microarray gene expression data. SPD assumes that individual samples of a microarray dataset are related by an unknown biological process (i.e., differentiation, development, cell cycle, disease progression), and that each sample represents one unknown point along the progression of that process. SPD aims to organize the samples in a manner that reveals the underlying progression and to simultaneously identify subsets of genes that are responsible for that progression. We demonstrate the performance of SPD on a variety of microarray datasets that were generated by sampling a biological process at different points along its progression, without providing SPD any information of the underlying process. When applied to a cell cycle time series microarray dataset, SPD was not provided any prior knowledge of samples' time order or of which genes are cell-cycle regulated, yet SPD recovered the correct time order and identified many genes that have been associated with the cell cycle. When applied to B-cell differentiation data, SPD recovered the correct order of stages of normal B-cell differentiation and the linkage between preB-ALL tumor cells with their cell origin preB. When applied to mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation data, SPD uncovered a landscape of ESC differentiation into various lineages and genes that represent both generic and lineage specific processes. When applied to a prostate cancer microarray dataset, SPD identified gene modules that reflect a progression consistent with disease stages. SPD may be best viewed as a novel tool for synthesizing biological hypotheses because it provides a likely biological progression underlying a microarray dataset and, perhaps more importantly, the candidate genes that regulate that progression.""","""['Peng Qiu', 'Andrew J Gentles', 'Sylvia K Plevritis']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['Discovering monotonic stemness marker genes from time-series stem cell microarray data.', 'Biclustering of microarray data with MOSPO based on crowding distance.', 'Dynamic biclustering of microarray data by multi-objective immune optimization.', 'Microarrays--identifying molecular portraits for prostate tumors with different Gleason patterns.', 'Databases of free expression.', 'Discovering cellular programs of intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of metabolic traits using LipocyteProfiler.', 'Dictionary learning allows model-free pseudotime estimation of transcriptomic data.', 'The identification of co-expressed gene modules in Streptococcus pneumonia from colonization to infection to predict novel potential virulence genes.', 'Latent periodic process inference from single-cell RNA-seq data.', 'Inferring Multidimensional Rates of Aging from Cross-Sectional Data.']"""

How tissues control the dynamics of adhesion and cytoskeletal tension is unclear. We have studied epithelial tissue architecture using 3D culture models and found that adult primary prostate epithelial cells grow into hollow acinus-like spheroids. Importantly, when co-cultured with stroma the epithelia show increased lateral cell adhesions. To investigate this mechanism further we aimed to: identify a cell line model to allow repeatable and robust experiments; determine whether or not epithelial adhesion molecules were affected by stromal culture; and determine which stromal signalling molecules may influence cell adhesion in 3D epithelial cell cultures.  Methodology/principal findings:   The prostate cell line, BPH-1, showed increased lateral cell adhesion in response to stroma, when grown as 3D spheroids. Electron microscopy showed that 9.4% of lateral membranes were within 20 nm of each other and that this increased to 54% in the presence of stroma, after 7 days in culture. Stromal signalling did not influence E-cadherin or desmosome RNA or protein expression, but increased E-cadherin/actin co-localisation on the basolateral membranes, and decreased paracellular permeability. Microarray analysis identified several growth factors and pathways that were differentially expressed in stroma in response to 3D epithelial culture. The upregulated growth factors TGFβ2, CXCL12 and FGF10 were selected for further analysis because of previous associations with morphology. Small molecule inhibition of TGFβ2 signalling but not of CXCL12 and FGF10 signalling led to a decrease in actin and E-cadherin co-localisation and increased paracellular permeability.  Conclusions/significance:   In 3D culture models, paracrine stromal signals increase epithelial cell adhesion via adhesion/cytoskeleton interactions and TGFβ2-dependent mechanisms may play a key role. These findings indicate a role for stroma in maintaining adult epithelial tissue morphology and integrity.""","""['Karen F Chambers', 'Joanna F Pearson', 'Naveed Aziz', ""Peter O'Toole"", 'David Garrod', 'Shona H Lang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Stromal upregulation of lateral epithelial adhesions: gene expression analysis of signalling pathways in prostate epithelium.', 'Sex steroids regulate epithelial-stromal cell cross talk and trophoblast attachment invasion in a three-dimensional human endometrial culture system.', 'Estrogen mediated epithelial proliferation in the uterus is directed by stromal Fgf10 and Bmp8a.', 'Spatial integration of E-cadherin adhesion, signalling and the epithelial cytoskeleton.', 'Role of tissue stroma in cancer cell invasion.', 'Subaqueous 3D stem cell spheroid levitation culture using anti-gravity bioreactor based on sound wave superposition.', 'Differential impact of paired patient-derived BPH and normal adjacent stromal cells on benign prostatic epithelial cell growth in 3D culture.', 'Development of a novel human recellularized endometrium that responds to a 28-day hormone treatment.', 'DNA methylation as a dynamic regulator of development and disease processes: spotlight on the prostate.', '3D Cultures of prostate cancer cells cultured in a novel high-throughput culture platform are more resistant to chemotherapeutics compared to cells cultured in monolayer.']"""

Here we present a novel EGFR variant with aberrant splicing of exon 4 (named as de4 EGFR). Variant-specific polymerase chain reaction showed that de4 EGFR was expressed in some glioma (4/40), prostate cancer (3/11), and ovarian cancer (3/9) tissues but not in tissues adjacent to tumors or normal tissues. de4 EGFR displayed an enhanced transformation and a higher metastasis-promoting capacity in comparison to wild-type EGFR. With minimal EGF-binding activity, de4 EGFR underwent ligand-independent autophosphorylation and self-dimerization. Moreover, in serum-starved condition, de4 EGFR expression in U87 MG cells significantly upregulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and AKT phosphorylation and expression of JUN and Src. Importantly, E-cadherin expression was barely detectable in the U87 MG cells expressing de4 EGFR and restored expression of E-cadherin in these cells inhibited their metastatic behaviors.

Androgen receptor (AR) and PTEN both have been well documented to have important roles in prostate carcinogenesis. In contrast, AR and PTEN in breast carcinogenesis have not been well studied. Furthermore, the crosstalk and connection between those two pathways remain unclear. Increased AR expression in prostate cancers, combined with decreased PTEN expression, portends a poor clinical outcome. Paradoxically, both high AR and high PTEN levels, detected by immunohistochemistry, in primary breast carcinomas have been associated with better disease-free survival. Here, we performed in silico analysis of publicly available microarray data sets from prostate or breast carcinomas. We found an inverse correlation between AR and PTEN transcript expression in prostate cancer tissues in contrast to the positive correlation in breast cancer. These data led us to hypothesize that AR may directly affect PTEN transcriptional regulation in prostate and breast cancer cells. Here, we show for the first time that AR inhibits PTEN transcription in prostate cancer cells, whereas AR upregulates PTEN transcription in breast cancer cells, which mechanistically explains both the immunohistochemical PTEN-AR expressional data noted in clinical trials and in our in silico analysis of the transcriptomes of breast and prostate cancers. In addition, we have fine-mapped the AR-binding motif within the PTEN promoter. Here we show that, in patients with Cowden syndrome, an inherited cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations scattered throughout PTEN, point variants affecting the 3' end of the AR-binding motif result in abrogation of androgen-mediated transcriptional regulation of PTEN expression. We may speculate that the differential AR effect on PTEN may begin to explain organ-specific and perhaps sex-specific neoplasia predisposition in Cowden syndrome, as well as why only a fraction of women with germline PTEN mutations develop breast cancer, depending on the androgen steroid milieu and levels.""","""['Y Wang', 'T Romigh', 'X He', 'M-H Tan', 'M S Orloff', 'R H Silverman', 'W D Heston', 'C Eng']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Differential expression of novel naturally occurring splice variants of PTEN and their functional consequences in Cowden syndrome and sporadic breast cancer.', 'Resveratrol regulates the PTEN/AKT pathway through androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'GATA2 negatively regulates PTEN by preventing nuclear translocation of androgen receptor and by androgen-independent suppression of PTEN transcription in breast cancer.', 'Comparison of the roles of estrogens and androgens in breast cancer and prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor alterations in prostatic carcinoma.', 'Exome sequencing reveals a distinct somatic genomic landscape in breast cancer from women with germline PTEN variants.', ""Loss of PTEN Expression, PIK3CA Mutations, and Breast Cancer Survival in the Nurses' Health Studies."", 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Analysis of Luminal Androgen Receptor Reveals Activated Pathways and Potential Therapeutic Targets in Breast Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Transcription in Prostate Cancer.']"""

We demonstrated that miR-15 and miR-16 are downregulated in fibroblasts surrounding the prostate tumors of the majority of 23 patients analyzed. Such downregulation of miR-15 and miR-16 in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promoted tumor growth and progression through the reduced post-transcriptional repression of Fgf-2 and its receptor Fgfr1, which act on both stromal and tumor cells to enhance cancer cell survival, proliferation and migration. Moreover, reconstitution of miR-15 and miR-16 impaired considerably the tumor-supportive capability of stromal cells in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest a molecular circuitry in which miR-15 and miR-16 and their correlated targets cooperate to promote tumor expansion and invasiveness through the concurrent activity on stromal and cancer cells, thus providing further support to the development of therapies aimed at reconstituting miR-15 and miR-16 in advanced prostate cancer.""","""['M Musumeci', 'V Coppola', 'A Addario', 'M Patrizii', 'M Maugeri-Saccà', 'L Memeo', 'C Colarossi', 'F Francescangeli', 'M Biffoni', 'D Collura', 'A Giacobbe', ""L D'Urso"", 'M Falchi', 'M A Venneri', 'G Muto', 'R De Maria', 'D Bonci']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Regulatory Role of mir-203 in Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis.', 'The miR-15a-miR-16-1 cluster controls prostate cancer by targeting multiple oncogenic activities.', 'miR-205 Exerts tumor-suppressive functions in human prostate through down-regulation of protein kinase Cepsilon.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'MicroRNAs as mediators and communicators between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment.', 'miRNAs: Potential as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Cancer.', 'Orchestration of miRNA Patterns by Testosterone and Dietary Tomato Carotenoids during Early Prostate Carcinogenesis in TRAMP Mice.', 'Therapeutic Delivery of Tumor Suppressor miRNAs for Breast Cancer Treatment.', 'The Tumor Microenvironment in Tumorigenesis and Therapy Resistance Revisited.', 'Signaling pathways in cancer-associated fibroblasts: recent advances and future perspectives.']"""

A large number of BBN derivatives have been synthesized for this purpose but most of them exhibit high abdominal accumulation, which may represent a problem in their clinical use due to serious side effects to patients. In this study we describe the results of radiolabeling with lutetium-177, stability and in vivo studies of novel phenyl-glycine-extended bombesin derivatives. The spacers were inserted to improve bombesin in vivo properties and to reduce its target to non-tumor sites.  Methods:   Preliminary studies were done to establish the ideal conditions for labeling bombesin derivatives. Chromatography systems were applied to determine free lutetium and the stability of the preparations was evaluated either after storing at 2-8 ºC or incubation in human serum at 37 ºC. In vivo experiments included biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and SPECT images and were performed in Balb-c and Nude mice bearing PC-3 xenografts.  Results:   The derivatives were labeled with high yield and kept stable at 2-8 ºC and are metabolized by human serum enzymes. In vivo studies showed fast blood clearance of labeled peptides and rapid excretion, performed mainly by renal pathway. In addition, biodistribution and imaging studies showed low abdominal accumulation and significant and specific tumor uptake of (177)Lu-labeled derivatives.

Thus, clinically relevant regimens that harness different modalities to maximize treatment efficacy without increasing cumulative toxicities are urgently needed. Based on this rationale, we investigated whether a novel combination of purine nucleoside phosphorylase-mediated, gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (PNP-GDEPT) with docetaxel against CRPC has superior efficacy in comparison with individual treatments.  Methods:   The in vitro cell growth inhibition in differentially treated murine and human CRPC cell lines was established using a cell-viability assay. The extent of synergy, additivity, or antagonism between treatments was evaluated using CalcuSyn statistical analyses. The local and systemic effects of docetaxel and/or PNP-GDEPT were tested in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice against human and murine CRPC tumors, respectively. Subsequently, immunohistochemical analyses and an evaluation of serum cytokine and serum toxicity profiles were conducted to characterize the differential host responses to treatment.  Results:   The combined use of PNP-GDEPT and docetaxel led to strong synergistic cell killing in vitro. Compared with the individual modalities, a combination of the 2 led to a marked reduction in ""local and distant"" tumor growth in vivo, and importantly, with lowered doses and without additional toxicities. Immunomodulation was indicated by enhanced immune cell infiltration and altered serum cytokine levels. Furthermore, a lowering of T-helper type 2 cytokines, MCP-1, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and IL-10 marked lower tumor burden and enhanced treatment efficacy.

One of these genes is TOP1MT, which encodes the mitochondrial DNA topoisomerase IB, involved in mtDNA relaxation. To elucidate TOP1MT regulation, we performed genome-wide profiling across the 60-cell line panel (the NCI-60) of the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program. We show that TOP1MT mRNA expression varies widely across these cell lines with the highest levels in leukemia (HL-60, K-562) and melanoma (SK-MEL-28), intermediate levels in breast (MDA-MB-231), ovarian (OVCAR) and colon (HCT-116, HCT-15, KM-12), and lowest levels in renal (ACHN, A498), prostate (PC-3, DU-145) and central nervous system cell lines (SF-539, SF-268, SF-295). Genome-wide analyses show that TOP1MT expression is significantly correlated with the other mitochondrial nuclear-encoded genes including the mitochondrial nucleoid genes, and demonstrate an overall co-regulation of the mitochondrial nuclear-encoded genes. We also find very high correlation between the expression of TOP1MT and the proto-oncogene MYC (c-myc). TOP1MT contains E-boxes (c-myc binding sites) and TOP1MT transcription follows MYC up- and down-regulation by MYC promoter activation and siRNA against MYC.

Sometimes not even sound evidence provides clear answers about the benefits and harms of preventive interventions. This is why informed decision-making is a particularly important step for individuals taking preventive interventions into consideration.

We report a clinical study to characterize the visibility of the prostate in VE images and the ability to detect the boundary of the gland. Measures for contrast, edge strength characterized by gradient and statistical intensity change at the edge, and the continuity of the edges are proposed and computed for VE and B-mode ultrasound images. Furthermore, using MRI as the gold standard, we compare the error in the computation of the volume of the gland from VE and B-mode images. The results demonstrate that VE images are superior to B-mode images in terms of contrast, with an approximately six fold improvement in contrast-to-noise ratio, and in terms of edge strength, with an approximately two fold improvement in the gradient in the direction normal to the edge. The computed volumes show that the VE images provide an accurate 3D visualization of the prostate with volume errors that are slightly lower than errors computed based on B-mode images. The total gland volume error is 8.8±2.5% for VE vs. MRI and 10.3±4.6% for B-mode vs. MRI, and the total gland volume difference is -4.6±11.1% for VE vs. MRI and -4.1±17.1% for B-mode vs. MRI, averaged over nine patients and three observers.

A commonly used concept is the generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD), developed by Niemierko. Unlike the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) which is defined for tumor only, the gEUD can be used for both target volume and organs-at-risk (OAR). In this study, the gEUD has been integrated in our in-house inverse treatment planning system DMCO. DMCO is based on an inverse kernel concept and maintains full Monte-Carlo precision. The system applies direct aperture optimization by means of simulated annealing. Thereby DMCO is per se predestined for the optimization of non-quadratic biological objective functions. In this work, the feasibility of gEUD-based optimization with DMCO is investigated and compared to modified physical optimization. A 'pseudo' Pareto study is performed in order to derive the gEUD-parameters 'a' for the volumes-of-interest of a prostate case. The best biological plan is compared to a physically optimized plan, based on dose-volume objectives (DVO). Furthermore, a hybrid objective function (OF) was developed. It consists of both a biological OF for the OARs and a physical OF for the PTV. The plans are compared to another physically optimized plan, which includes additional zero-DVOs in order to further improve OAR-sparing. As a result of the comparisons it turns out, that the biological OF may improve plan quality with regard to the OARs, but at the price of a degradation of the PTV. This disadvantage can be overcome by a hybrid OF, by which the advantages of both biological and physical OF can be combined. With the application of the physical OF with properly set zero-DVOs, a similar or even superior plan quality may be achieved. The physical OFs do not need the time consuming stochastic optimization, which is mandatory in biological optimization and which is included in DMCO. Furthermore, biological evaluation leaves plan quality rather similar compared to physical optimization, but it cares automatically for the target and the OARs.""","""['Thomas Dirscherl', 'Judith Alvarez-Moret', 'Ludwig Bogner']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Z Med Phys""","""['Improving the performance of direct Monte Carlo optimization for large tumor volumes.', 'Benefit of using biologic parameters (EUD and NTCP) in IMRT optimization for treatment of intrahepatic tumors.', 'Superiority of equivalent uniform dose (EUD)-based optimization for breast and chest wall.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Mathematical Formulation of DMH-Based Inverse Optimization.', 'Prescription Value-Based Automatic Optimization of Importance Factors in Inverse Planning.', 'The benefit of using bladder sub-volume equivalent uniform dose constraints in prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning.']"""

However, family history is usually ignored in genetic risk prediction. In this study we proposed a statistical framework for risk prediction given an individual's genotype profile and family history. Genotype information about the relatives can also be incorporated. We allow risk prediction given the current age and follow-up period and consider competing risks of mortality. The framework allows easy extension to any family size and structure. In addition, the predicted risk at any percentile and the risk distribution graphs can be computed analytically. We applied the method to risk prediction for breast and prostate cancers by using known susceptibility loci from genome-wide association studies. For breast cancer, in the population the 10-year risk at age 50 ranged from 1.1% at the 5th percentile to 4.7% at the 95th percentile. If we consider the average 10-year risk at age 50 (2.39%) as the threshold for screening, the screening age ranged from 62 at the 20th percentile to 38 at the 95th percentile (and some never reach the threshold). For women with one affected first-degree relative, the 10-year risks ranged from 2.6% (at the 5th percentile) to 8.1% (at the 95th percentile). For prostate cancer, the corresponding 10-year risks at age 60 varied from 1.8% to 14.9% in the population and from 4.2% to 23.2% in those with an affected first-degree relative. We suggest that for some diseases genetic testing that incorporates family history can stratify people into diverse risk categories and might be useful in targeted prevention and screening.""","""['Hon-Cheong So', 'Johnny S H Kwan', 'Stacey S Cherny', 'Pak C Sham']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Hum Genet""","""['Common genetic variants in prostate cancer risk prediction--results from the NCI Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3).', 'Prostate cancer risk prediction based on complete prostate cancer family history.', 'First-degree family history of breast cancer is associated with prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Incorporating genomics into breast and prostate cancer screening: assessing the implications.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'CanRisk-Prostate: A Comprehensive, Externally Validated Risk Model for the Prediction of Future Prostate Cancer.', 'Incorporating family history of disease improves polygenic risk scores in diverse populations.', 'Genetic Testing and Its Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Management: Consensus Statements from the Hong Kong Urological Association and Hong Kong Society of Uro-Oncology.', 'Capturing additional genetic risk from family history for improved polygenic risk prediction.', 'Polygenic risk for prostate cancer: Decreasing relative risk with age but little impact on absolute risk.']"""

Conventional imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI and transrectal ultrasound, are considered suboptimal for treatment decisions. Choline-PET/CT might be considered as the imaging modality in radiooncology to select and delineate clinical target volumes extending the prostate gland or prostate fossa. In conjunction with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and imaged guided radiotherapy (IGRT), it might offer the opportunity of dose escalation to selected sites while avoiding unnecessary irradiation of healthy tissues.  Methods:   Twenty-six patients with primary (n = 7) or recurrent (n = 19) prostate cancer received Choline-PET/CT planned 3D conformal or intensity modulated radiotherapy. The median age of the patients was 65 yrs (range 45 to 78 yrs). PET/CT-scans with F18-fluoroethylcholine (FEC) were performed on a combined PET/CT-scanner equipped for radiation therapy planning. The majority of patients had intermediate to high risk prostate cancer. All patients received 3D conformal or intensity modulated and imaged guided radiotherapy with megavoltage cone beam CT. The median dose to primary tumours was 75.6 Gy and to FEC-positive recurrent lymph nodal sites 66,6 Gy. The median follow-up time was 28.8 months.  Results:   The mean SUV(max) in primary cancer was 5,97 in the prostate gland and 3,2 in pelvic lymph nodes. Patients with recurrent cancer had a mean SUV(max) of 4,38. Two patients had negative PET/CT scans. At 28 months the overall survival rate is 94%. Biochemical relapse free survival is 83% for primary cancer and 49% for recurrent tumours. Distant disease free survival is 100% and 75% for primary and recurrent cancer, respectively. Acute normal tissue toxicity was mild in 85% and moderate (grade 2) in 15%. No or mild late side effects were observed in the majority of patients (84%). One patient had a severe bladder shrinkage (grade 4) after a previous treatment with TUR of the prostate and seed implantation.

Following computed tomography and choline PET imaging, stereotactic body radiotherapy was delivered on pathological lymphatic areas by 6 MV Linac, using dynamic micromultileaf collimation and intensity-modulated arc therapy optimization. Sixty days post-treatment, choline PET/CT imaging was carried out.  Results:   Median follow-up was 29 months (range, 14.4-48). Choline PET detected recurrences in 39 of 71 patients. Median PSA velocity was 0.40 ng/ml/year in PET-negative patients and 2.88 ng/ml/year in PET-positive subjects (P < 0.05). Twenty-five patients with limited nodal recurrences, out of the 71 submitted to choline PET, received eradicative radiotherapy. Persistent regression was recorded in 13; early spread to bone was found in 2 cases; lymph node recurrences in 8, all in sites outside the irradiated areas; 2 patients were lost to follow-up. At the 3-year follow-up, overall survival, disease-free survival and local control rates were 92%, 17% and 90%, respectively. In patients with a complete regression, PSA fell from 5.65 to 1.40 ng/ml (median). PSA nadir value (median 1.06 ng/ml) was maintained for 5.6 months (median).  Conclusions:   Stereotactic body radiotherapy was effective in disease eradication of limited nodal recurrences from prostate cancer, saving patients from, or at least postponing, systemic treatments.""","""['Franco Casamassima', 'Laura Masi', 'Claudia Menichelli', 'Ivano Bonucci', 'Emanuele Casamassima', 'Massimo Lazzeri', 'Massirno Gulisano', 'Stefano Aterini']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Targeted salvage lymphadenectomy in patients treated with radical prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence: complete biochemical response without adjuvant therapy in patients with low volume lymph node recurrence over a long-term follow-up.', '18Ffluoroethylcholine-PET/CT imaging for radiation treatment planning of recurrent and primary prostate cancer with dose escalation to PET/CT-positive lymph nodes.', 'Is there a role for ¹¹C-choline PET/CT in the early detection of metastatic disease in surgically treated prostate cancer patients with a mild PSA increase <1.5 ng/ml?', 'The role of choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of patients with prostate-specific antigen progression after radical treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Role of choline PET/CT in guiding target volume delineation for irradiation of prostate cancer.', 'Metastasis-Directed Therapy for Oligometastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: An Alternative to ADT?', 'Role of PSMA PET-guided metastases-directed therapy in oligometastatic recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic radiotherapy of nodal oligometastases from prostate cancer: a prisma-compliant systematic review.', 'Stratification of Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer Patients by Liquid Biopsy: Clinical Insights from a Pilot Study.', 'Outcome After 68Ga-PSMA-11 versus Choline PET-Based Salvage Radiotherapy in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: A Matched-Pair Analysis.']"""

The study focused on the safety and feasibility of this treatment modality.  Materials and methods:   Between October 2002 and December 2007, 44 patients suffering from localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate were treated with SBRT using CyberKnife at the Korea Cancer Center Hospital. The patients were divided into 3 groups: a low-risk group (5 patients), an intermediate-risk group (10 patients), and a high-risk group (29 patients). Five patients received 32 Gy in 4 fractions, 28 patients received 34 Gy in 4 fractions, and 11 patients received 36 Gy in 4 fractions.  Results:   The median age of the patients was 69 years (range, 53-79 years) and the median duration of follow-up 40 months (range, 12-78 months). There were 6 acute and 3 late grade 2 urinary toxicities, and 4 acute and 5 late grade 2 rectal toxicities, but there were no grade 3 or higher treatment-related toxicities.

Adequate therapies for prostate cancer that has spread outside its capsule are lacking. In order to identify effective therapies for this problem, we investigated the antiproliferative effects of TALL-104 cells against three prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, DU-145). A Cr-51-release: cytotoxicity assay showed that TALL-104 cells were very cytotoxic against the prostate cancer cells. For example, at a 1:1 ratio of TALL-104 cells to prostate cancer cells, the percent release of Cr-51 at 18 h were 50, 40, and 45% for LNCaP, PC-3, and DU-145, respectively. Analysis by inhibition of clonogenic growth of prostate cancer cells also showed that TALL-104 cells were extremely effective. For instance, a short-term (4 h or 18 h) pre-incubation of TALL-104 cells with these tumor cells at the effector to target ratio of 10:1 prior to clonogenic assay resulted in a substantial reduction in clonogenic tumor growth (90%, 65%, and 50% clonal growth inhibition for LNCaP, PC-3, and DU-145, respectively). Further experiments using both Cr-51 release and clonogenic assays showed that irradiated TALL-104 cells were also effective in their anti-prostatic cancer activities. We also examined if TALL-104 cells plus a chemotherapeutic agent might complement each other in their cytotoxic effects. Preincubation of prostate cancer cell targets with etoposide (0.2-20 mu g/ml) for 18 h markedly increased their susceptibility to TALL-104 lysis. The anti-tumor efficacy of TALL-104 cells was also demonstrated in vivo utilizing the BNX murine model engrafted with subcutaneous PC-3 prostate cancer cells. A substantial reduction in PC-3 tumor cell progression was observed in mice injected with irradiated TALL-104 cells (1x10(7) cells intraperitoneally or intratumorally for 5 days beginning on days 24 and 45 after implantation) as compared to mice injected with tumors only. Taken together, these findings suggest that TALL-104 cells may be utilized as a potent anti-tumor agent, either alone or in combination with other agents (such as etoposide) in metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['T Umiel', 'M Campbell', 'S Cho', 'R Deem', 'A Cesano', 'D Santoli', 'H Koeffler']""","""[]""","""1997""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Tumor apoptosis induced by epoxide-containing piperazines, a new class of anti-cancer agents.', 'Antitumor efficacy of a human major histocompatibility complex nonrestricted cytotoxic T-cell line (TALL-104) in immunocompetent mice bearing syngeneic leukemia.', 'TALL-104 cell therapy of human solid tumors implanted in immunodeficient (SCID) mice.', 'Human prostate tumor angiogenesis in nude mice: metalloprotease and plasminogen activator activities during tumor growth and neovascularization of subcutaneously injected matrigel impregnated with human prostate tumor cells.', 'In vitro modulation of tumor progression-associated properties of hormone refractory prostate carcinoma cell lines by cytokines.']"""

To determine factors that may play a role in its regulation and expression, changes in p53 protein was investigated by using the androgen-insensitive JCA-1, DU-145, PC-3 and the androgen-responsive LNCaP cells. With the exception of PC-3 cells in which p53 is missing, multiple distinct forms of p53 were found in the other 3 prostate cell lines. A single p53 band was detected in the JCA-1 cell extracts, whereas two and three p53 immunoreactive bands were correspondingly observed in the DU-145 and LNCaP cells. The relative abundance and distribution of the different forms of p53 in the latter two cell types varied with proliferation of cells in culture. In the presence of charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (cFBS), LNCaP took on the morphology of neuroendocrine cells, a phenotypic change which was accompanied by a greater than 80% reduction in p53 expression, concurrent with elimination of the two slow migrating forms of p53. Induction of apoptosis in JCA-1 cells by treatment with the retinoid 4-HPR caused the virtual disappearance of p53, which coincided with specific processing of p53 into lower molecular weight 28 kD fragments.

We hypothesized that promoting the E-cadherin expression in PCA cells by using nontoxic phytochemicals, like silibinin, would prevent EMT and consequently invasiveness. Our results showed that silibinin treatment (5-90 μmol/L) significantly inhibits migratory and invasive potential of advance human PCA PC3, PC3MM2, and C4-2B cells in in vitro assays. Importantly, the antimigratory/antiinvasive efficacy of silibinin was not due to its cytotoxicity toward PCA cells. Molecular analyses showed that silibinin increases E-cadherin level that was localized mainly at cellular membrane as evidenced by subcellular fractional and confocal analyses in PC3 cells, which might be responsible for morphologically observed shift toward epithelial character. Silibinin also decreased the levels of Slug, Snail, phospho-Akt(ser(473)), nuclear β-catenin, phospho-Src(tyr(419)) and Hakai; together they play an important role in regulating E-cadherin expression/function and EMT. Similar silibinin effects on E-cadherin, β-catenin, phospho-Src(tyr(419)), and Hakai levels were also observed in PC3MM2 and C4-2B PCA cells. Selective Src inhibition by dasatinib also showed increased E-cadherin expression in PC3 cells suggesting a possible involvement of Src inhibition in silibinin-caused increase in E-cadherin level. Additional studies in PC3 cells with stable knock-down of E-cadherin expression revealed that antimigratory/antiinvasive efficacy of silibinin is in-part dependent on E-cadherin expression.

Methods:   We use three independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history to project risks of clinical progression events and disease-specific deaths for PSA-detected cases assuming they receive no primary treatment.  Results:   The three models project that 20%-33% of men have preclinical onset; of these 38%-50% would be clinically diagnosed and 12%-25% would die of the disease in the absence of screening and primary treatment. The risk that men age less than 60 at PSA detection with Gleason score 2-7 would be clinically diagnosed in the absence of screening is 67%-93% and would die of the disease in the absence of primary treatment is 23%-34%. For Gleason score 8 to 10 these risks are 90%-96% and 63%-83%.  Conclusions:   Risks of disease progression among untreated PSA-detected cases can be nontrivial, particularly for younger men and men with high Gleason scores.

Compartment models assume a homogeneous distribution of the injected tracer throughout the compartment volume. Since tracer distribution within a compartment cannot be assessed, the parameters obtained by means of a compartment model might differ from the actual physical values. This work systematically examines the widely used permeability-surface-limited one-compartment model to determine the reliability of the parameters obtained by comparing them with their actual values. A computer simulation was used to model spatial tracer distribution within the interstitial volume using diffusion of contrast agent in tissue. Vascular parameters were varied as well as tissue parameters. The vascular parameters used were capillary radius (4 and 12 μm), capillary permeability (from 0.03 to 3.3 μm/s) and intercapillary distances from 30 to 300 μm. The tissue parameters used were tortuosity (λ), porosity (α) and interstitial volume fraction (v(e)). Our results suggest that the permeability-surface-limited compartment model generally underestimates capillary permeability for capillaries with a radius of 4 μm by factors from ≈0.03 for α=0.04, to ≈ 0.1 for α=0.2, to ≈ 0.5 for α=1.0. An overestimation of actual capillary permeability for capillaries with a radius of 12 μm by a factor of ≥1.3 was found for α=1.0, while α=0.2 yielded an underestimation by a factor of ≈0.3 and α=0.04 by a factor of ≈ 0.03. The interstitial volume fraction, v(e), obtained by the compartment model differed with increasing intercapillary distances and for low vessel permeability, whereas v(e) was found to be estimated approximately accurately for P=0.3 μm/s and P=3.3 μm/s for vessel distances <100 μm.""","""['Guido Correia Carreira', 'Ole Gemeinhardt', 'Rudolf Gorenflo', 'Dirk Beyersdorff', 'Tobias Franiel', 'Johanna Plendl', 'Lutz Lüdemann']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Effect of heterogeneous vasculature on interstitial transport within a solid tumor.', 'Myocardial microcirculation in humans--new approaches using MRI.', 'Simultaneous quantification of perfusion and permeability in the prostate using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with an inversion-prepared dual-contrast sequence.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of the prostate.', 'Tracer kinetic modelling in MRI: estimating perfusion and capillary permeability.', 'Assessment of micronecrotic tumor tissue using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.', 'A Metric for Reducing False Positives in the Computer-Aided Detection of Breast Cancer from Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Screening Examinations of High-Risk Women.', 'Advanced magnetic resonance imaging of the physical processes in human glioblastoma.']"""

We collected 10 marine sponges and one freshwater sponge by diving at the seaside and prepared crude methanolic extracts. The effect to established pancreatic and prostate CSC lines was evaluated by analysis of apoptosis, cell cycle, side population, colony and spheroid formation, migratory potential in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo.

CR inhibited self-renewal capacity, apoptosis resistance, and proliferation even in gemcitabine-selected pancreatic cancer cells with acquired therapy resistance and enhanced CSC characteristics. CR pretreatment of tumor cells diminished tumorigenicity of gemcitabine-resistant tumor cells in mice and totally abolished tumor take upon combination with gemcitabine.

Using a luciferase reporter, KISS1 transcription is significantly increased in the absence of WASF3. Knockdown of KISS1 in WASF3-silenced cells resulted in the recovery of the invasion phenotype. WASF3 knockdown also resulted in elevated IκBα levels in the cytoplasm and reduced levels of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) p65/50 subunits in the nucleus. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) has been associated with cell invasion through induction of MMP-9 production via KISS1 regulation of the NF-κB pathway. When WASF3 knockdown cells are treated with TNF-α, no effect is seen on invasion or nuclear translocation of NF-κB.

Recent studies have indicated that miR-21 is one of the important miRNAs associated with tumor growth and metastasis, but the role and molecular mechanism of miR-21 in regulating tumor angiogenesis remain to be elucidated. In this study, miR-21 was overexpressed by transfecting pre-miR-21 into human prostate cancer cells and tumor angiogenesis was assayed using chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). We found that overexpression of miR-21 in DU145 cells increased the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF, and induced tumor angiogenesis. AKT and extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 are activated by miR-21. Inhibition of miR-21 by the antigomir blocked this process. Overexpression of the miR-21 target, PTEN, also inhibited tumor angiogenesis by partially inactivating AKT and ERK and decreasing the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF. The AKT and ERK inhibitors, LY294002 and U0126, suppressed HIF-1α and VEGF expression and angiogenesis. Moreover, inhibition of HIF-1α expression alone abolished miR-21-inducing tumor angiogenesis, indicating that HIF-1α is required for miR-21-upregulated angiogenesis. Therefore, we demonstrate that miR-21 induces tumor angiogenesis through targeting PTEN, leading to activate AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, and thereby enhancing HIF-1α and VEGF expression; HIF-1α is a key downstream target of miR-21 in regulating tumor angiogenesis.""","""['Ling-Zhi Liu', 'Chongyong Li', 'Qi Chen', 'Yi Jing', 'Richard Carpenter', 'Yue Jiang', 'Hsiang-Fu Kung', 'Lihui Lai', 'Bing-Hua Jiang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PI3K/PTEN/AKT signaling regulates prostate tumor angiogenesis.', 'Loss of Mel-18 induces tumor angiogenesis through enhancing the activity and expression of HIF-1α mediated by the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (RBP2) promotes HIF-1α-VEGF-induced angiogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer via the Akt pathway.', 'Hypoxia: The Cornerstone of Glioblastoma.', 'ROS and miRNA Dysregulation in Ovarian Cancer Development, Angiogenesis and Therapeutic Resistance.', 'The Significant Role of microRNAs in Gliomas Angiogenesis: A Particular Focus on Molecular Mechanisms and Opportunities for Clinical Application.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived exosome microRNA-21 promotes angiogenesis in multiple myeloma.', 'Inflammatory microRNAs in cardiovascular pathology: another brick in the wall.', 'An Overview of the Role of MicroRNAs on Carcinogenesis: A Focus on Cell Cycle, Angiogenesis and Metastasis.', 'New Insight into Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Diseases: An Integrative Analysis Approach to Identify TheranoMiRNAs.']"""

In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of patients with prostate cancer who had undergone radical prostatectomy in Macau area and tried to find any risk factor of positive surgical margin and biochemical recurrence and their relationship with the prognosis of these patients.  Methods:   From 2000 to 2009, 149 patients with prostate cancer received radical prostatectomy and were followed up. Among these patients, 111 received retropubic radical prostatectomies, 38 received laparoscopic radical prostatectomies. All patients were followed-up on in the 3rd month, 6th month and from that point on every 6 months after operation. At each follow-up a detailed record of any complaint, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), full biochemical test and uroflowmetry was acquired.  Results:   The average age was (69.0 ± 6.1) years, preoperative average serum PSA was (10.1 ± 12.1) ng/ml and average Gleason score was 6.4 ± 1.3. The incidence of total complications was about 47.7%, the incidence of the most common complication, bladder outlet obstruction, was about 26.8%, and that of the second most common complication, urinary stress incontinence, was about 16.1% (mild 9.4% and severe 6.7%). The incidence of positive surgical margin was about 38.3%. The preoperative serum PSA ((13.4 ± 17.6) ng/ml), average Gleason score (7.1 ± 1.3) and pathological T stage score (7.0 ± 1.4) were higher in patients with positive surgical margins than those with negative margins ((8.0 ± 5.8) ng/ml, 6.0 ± 1.2 and 5.4 ± 1.4, respectively) (P = 0.004, P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). A univariate analysis showed that positive surgical margin had a positive statistical association with serum PSA (P = 0.007), Gleason score (P < 0.001), pathological T stage score (P < 0.001) and biochemical recurrence (BCR) (P = 0.035). The most common location of a positive surgical margin was in the apex of the prostate, which was about 63% (36/57). Sixty-four percent (23/36) of patients with positive surgical margin in apex were also involved in prostate lobe; other locations were prostate lobe (23%, 13/57), seminal vesicle (9%, 5/57). The multivariate analysis showed that positive surgical margin had a positive statistical association with Gleason score (P = 0.03) and pathological T stage score (P = 0.02).

Here we show that novel polypeptide-based degradable plasmonic matrices can be employed for simultaneous administration of hyperthermia and chemotherapeutic drugs as an effective combination treatment that can overcome cancer cell resistance to hyperthermia.  Method:   Novel gold nanorod elastin-like polypeptide matrices were generated and characterized. The matrices were also loaded with the heat-shock protein (HSP)90 inhibitor 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), currently in clinical trials for different malignancies, in order to deliver a combination of hyperthermia and chemotherapy.  Results:   Laser irradiation of cells cultured over the plasmonic matrices (without 17-AAG) resulted in the death of cells directly in the path of the laser, while cells outside the laser path did not show any loss of viability. Such spatial limitations, in concert with expression of prosurvival HSPs, reduce the efficacy of hyperthermia treatment. 17-AAG-gold nanorod-polypeptide matrices demonstrated minimal leaching of the drug to surrounding media. The combination of hyperthermic temperatures and the release of 17-AAG from the matrix, both induced by laser irradiation, resulted in significant (>90%) death of cancer cells, while 'single treatments' (i.e., hyperthermia alone and 17-AAG alone) demonstrated minimal loss of cancer cell viability (<10%).  Conclusion:   Simultaneous administration of hyperthermia and HSP inhibitor release from plasmonic matrices is a powerful approach for the ablation of malignant cells and can be extended to different combinations of nanoparticles and chemotherapeutic drugs for a variety of malignancies.""","""['Huang-Chiao Huang', 'Yoonsun Yang', 'Alisha Nanda', 'Piyush Koria', 'Kaushal Rege']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nanomedicine (Lond)""","""['Synergistic enhancement of cancer therapy using a combination of heat shock protein targeted HPMA copolymer-drug conjugates and gold nanorod induced hyperthermia.', 'Anti-cancer effects of chemotherapeutic agent; 17-AAG, in combined with gold nanoparticles and irradiation in human colorectal cancer cells.', 'Spatiotemporal temperature distribution and cancer cell death in response to extracellular hyperthermia induced by gold nanorods.', 'Modulation of Hsp90 function in neurodegenerative disorders: a molecular-targeted therapy against disease-causing protein.', 'Spotlight on 17-AAG as an Hsp90 inhibitor for molecular targeted cancer treatment.', 'Preliminary Assays towards Melanoma Cells Using Phototherapy with Gold-Based Nanomaterials.', 'Self-assembly in elastin-like recombinamers: a mechanism to mimic natural complexity.', 'Efficient Near Infrared Light Triggered Nitric Oxide Release Nanocomposites for Sensitizing Mild Photothermal Therapy.', 'Preparation of Folic Acid-Targeted Temperature-Sensitive Magnetoliposomes and their Antitumor Effects In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'Nano-therapeutic cancer immunotherapy using hyperthermia-induced heat shock proteins: insights from mathematical modeling.']"""

It has been reported that the beta-catenin signaling pathway controls androgen receptor (AR)-mediated prostate cancer progression, which plays a key role in the metastasis of prostate cancer.

Design, participants and setting:   Observational, prospective study of 367 men with early (211) or advanced (156) PCA recruited as consecutive attendees at clinics at seven public hospitals and practices in metropolitan Melbourne between 1 April 2001 and 30 December 2005.

Main outcome measures:   Health-related quality of life as assessed by the Short Form 36-item Health Survey; psychological distress, including depression and anxiety as assessed by the Brief Symptom Inventory; and coping patterns as assessed by the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale.  Results:   Over the 12 months, both the early and advanced PCA group showed reduced vitality and increased depression and anxiety; this effect was greater in the advanced PCA group. Mental health, social functioning and role-emotional functioning also deteriorated in the advanced group. Predictors of depression at Time 2 for the early PCA group were depression, vitality and a fatalistic coping pattern at Time 1; anxiety at Time 2 was predicted by anxiety and vitality at Time 1. In the advanced PCA group, depression at Time 2 was predicted by depression and mental health at Time 1; anxiety at Time 2 was predicted by anxiety, mental health, cognitive avoidance and lower anxious preoccupation at Time 1.  Conclusions:   Men with early PCA experience decreasing vitality and increasing psychological distress over the 12 months following diagnosis; this trend is accelerated after diagnosis with advanced PCA.

In LNCaP human prostate cancer cells, PMA induces tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) secretion and inhibits proliferation; bryostatin 1 does not, and indeed blocks the response to PMA. This difference has been attributed to bryostatin 1 not localizing PKCδ to the plasma membrane. Since phorbol ester lipophilicity influences PKCδ localization, we have examined in LNCaP cells a series of phorbol esters and related derivatives spanning some eight logs in lipophilicity (logP) to see if any behave like bryostatin 1. The compounds showed marked differences in their effects on proliferation and TNFα secretion. For example, maximal responses for TNFα secretion relative to PMA ranged from 97 % for octyl-indolactam V to 24 % for phorbol 12,13-dibenzoate. Dose-response curves ranged from monophasic for indolactam V to markedly biphasic for sapintoxin D. The divergent patterns of response, however, correlated neither to lipophilicity, to plasma membrane translocation of PKCδ, nor to the ability to interact with model membranes. In U937 human leukemia cells, a second system in which PMA and bryostatin 1 have divergent effects, viz. PMA but not bryostatin 1 inhibits proliferation and induces attachment, all the compounds acted like PMA for proliferation, but several induced a reduced level or a biphasic dose-response curve for attachment. We conclude that active phorbol esters are not all equivalent.

Therefore, PSCA is an attractive target for immunotherapy of PCa by retargeting of T cells to tumor cells.  Methods:   A series of different bispecific antibody formats for retargeting of T cells to tumor cells were described but, only very limited data obtained by side by side comparison of the different antibody formats are available. We established two novel bispecific antibodies in different formats. The functionality of both constructs was analyzed by FACS and chromium release assays. In parallel, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was determined by ELISA.  Results and conclusions:   Irrespective of the underlying antibody format, both novel bispecific antibodies cause an efficient killing of PSCA-positive tumor cells by pre- and non-pre-activated T cells.

Methods:   We examined the effect of prazosin on growth and tube formation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). We used flow cytometry to assess the effect of prazosin on cell cycle progression and Western blotting to assess its effect on the expression of various apoptotic proteins.  Results:   Prazosin inhibited the growth of HUVEC with an IC(50) of 6.53 µM and suppressed tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. Unlike prostate cancer cells, prazosin did not arrest cell cycle progression at the G2/M checkpoint. We used rhodamine 123 staining to show that prazosin (20 µM) treatment induced a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by 12 hr. Prazosin treatment of HUVECs resulted in reduced MCL-1 expression, increased Bad, and Bcl-xL expression, cytochrome c release, and induction of apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.

Methods:   AR modulation by AT1R was examined by Western blot analysis, luciferase assay, and Immunocytochemical staining. The influence of AR expression by angiotensin II (Ang-II) and AT1R inhibition using siRNA was determined. Furthermore, using angiotensinogen or AT1R knockout (KO) mice, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to investigate the expression of AR.  Results:   Ang-II induced cell proliferation with enhancement of AR, prostate specific antigen (PSA), NF-κB, and c-myc, and the activity of AR and PSA promoter. Cell proliferation of LNCaP transfected with AT1R siRNA was decreased by 75% at 7 days by inhibition of AR, PSA, NF-κB, and c-myc. Immunocytochemical staining confirmed the suppression of AR translocation into the nucleus in AT1R siRNA cells. AT1R KO mice showed a decrease in AR expression in the prostate gland. We also found that the expression level of AT1R could modulate the transcriptional level of AR by affecting NF-κB and c-myc expression.  Conclusions:   Knocking down of the AT1R protein resulted in significant inhibition of cell growth, associated with a marked decrease of AR protein.

Enrichment analysis was then carried out to assess whether the risk SNP blocks were enriched in the various annotation sets. Risk SNP blocks were significantly enriched over that expected by chance in two annotation sets, including AR-binding sites (P = 0.003), and FoxA1-binding sites (P = 0.05). About one-third of the 33 risk SNP blocks are located within AR-binding regions.

Results:   We found that sustained treatment with a specific PKCδ activator (ψδ receptor for active C kinase, ψδRACK) increased growth of PC-3 xenografts. There was increased levels of HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor and CD31-positive cells in PC-3 xenografts, representative of increased tumor angiogenesis. Mechanistically, PKCδ activation increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by binding to and phosphorylating NADPH oxidase, which induced its activity. Also, PKCδ-induced activation of NADPH oxidase increased the level of HIF-1α.  Conclusions:   Our results using tumors from the PC-3 xenograft model suggest that PKCδ activation increases angiogenic activity in androgen-independent PC-3 prostate cancer cells by increasing NADPH oxidase activity and HIF-1α levels and thus may partly be responsible for increased angiogenesis in advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Jeewon Kim', 'Tomoyoshi Koyanagi', 'Daria Mochly-Rosen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['NADPH oxidase subunit p22(phox)-mediated reactive oxygen species contribute to angiogenesis and tumor growth through AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in prostate cancer.', 'NADPH oxidase 1 supports proliferation of colon cancer cells by modulating reactive oxygen species-dependent signal transduction.', 'Sphingosine kinase 1 pathway is involved in melatonin-induced HIF-1α inactivation in hypoxic PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Reactive oxygen species and angiogenesis: NADPH oxidase as target for cancer therapy.', 'Reactive oxygen species as mediators of angiogenesis signaling: role of NAD(P)H oxidase.', 'Co-administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with rottlerin in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Phosphorylation of protein kinase Cδ Tyr311 positively regulates thromboxane generation in platelets.', 'The Role of CTHRC1 in Regulation of Multiple Signaling and Tumor Progression and Metastasis.', 'Lactate released by inflammatory bone marrow neutrophils induces their mobilization via endothelial GPR81 signaling.', 'The Role of Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Protein Kinase C Delta in Infection and Inflammation.']"""

One such factor affecting growth, proliferation, and apoptostis (pro-/anti-) in various cancers is the adipokine leptin. This research studied leptin-induced signaling and apoptosis in androgen sensitive (LNCaP, PC3/AR) and insensitive (PC3, DU145) PCa cell lines.  Methods:   Signaling was studied by immunoblotting in cells overexpressing leptin receptors (LRb), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and kinase negative-HER2-YFP cDNAs. Apoptosis was measured by immunoblotting of apoptotic proteins and by Hoechst staining of condensed DNA.  Results:   Leptin rapidly induced activation of JAK2, STAT3, and MAPK (ERK1/2) signaling cascades; it may also induce HER2 transactivation via leptin-induced phospho-JAK2. Leptin was then shown to exert clear pro-apoptotic effects, increasing levels of caspase 3, cleavage of its substrate, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) to cleaved PARP(89) , levels of CK 18, a cytoskeletal protein formed during apoptosis, and DNA condensation. Kinase inhibitors indicated that leptin-induced apoptosis is probably mediated by balanced activation of JAK2/STAT3, p38 MAPK, and PKC pathways in PCa cells. A human leptin mutein LRb antagonist, L39A/D40A/F41A, fully inhibited leptin-induced phosphorylation of JAK2, ERK1/2, and Akt/PKB, and partially abrogated effects on apoptotic proteins. In LNCaP and PC3/AR cells, leptin increased AR protein levels in correlation with raised apoptotic markers. Thus, AR may mediate, at least partly, the leptin-induced apoptotic response.  Conclusions:   Leptin can clearly induce apoptosis in human PCa cell lines. These findings could lead to development of new leptin agonists with enhanced pro-apoptotic effects and targeted for use in human PCa.""","""['Sigal Samuel-Mendelsohn', 'Michal Inbar', 'Esther Weiss-Messer', 'Leonora Niv-Spector', 'Arieh Gertler', 'Ronnie J Barkey']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Interruption of nuclear factor kappaB signaling by the androgen receptor facilitates 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbolacetate-induced apoptosis in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'TGF-beta signaling and androgen receptor status determine apoptotic cross-talk in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulatory processes affecting androgen receptor expression, stability, and function: potential targets to treat hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Leptin signalling, obesity and prostate cancer: molecular and clinical perspective on the old dilemma.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Assessment of expression levels of leptin and leptin receptor as potential biomarkers for risk of prostate cancer development and aggressiveness.', 'Analysis of Transcriptome, Selected Intracellular Signaling Pathways, Proliferation and Apoptosis of LNCaP Cells Exposed to High Leptin Concentrations.', 'Leptin-induced signaling pathways in cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Bone Marrow Adipocyte: An Intimate Partner With Tumor Cells in Bone Metastasis.']"""

Methods:   Virus-immortalized prostate cells were stably transfected with rat GnRH receptor cDNA and levels of GnRH binding were correlated with GnRH effects on signaling, cell cycle, growth, exosome production, and apoptosis.  Results:   High levels of cell surface GnRH receptor occurred in transfected papillomavirus-immortalized WPE-1-NB26 epithelial cells but not in non-tumourigenic RWPE-1, myoepithelial WPMY-1 cells, or SV40-immortalized PNT1A. Endogenous cell surface GnRH receptor was undetectable in non-transfected cells or cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC3, and DU145. GnRH receptor levels correlated with induction of inositol phosphates, elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) , cytoskeletal actin reorganization, modulation of ERK activation and cell growth-inhibition with GnRH agonists. Hoechst 33342 DNA staining-cell sorting indicated accumulation of cells in G2 following agonist treatment. Release of exosomes from transfected WPE-1-NB26 was unaffected by agonists, unlike induction observed in HEK293([SCL60]) cells. Increased PARP cleavage and apoptotic body production were undetectable during growth-inhibition in WPE-1-NB26 cells, contrasting with HEK293([SCL60]) . EGF receptor activation inhibited GnRH-induced ERK activation in WPE-1-NB26 but growth-inhibition was not rescued by EGF or PKC inhibitor Ro320432. Growth of cells expressing low levels of GnRH receptor was not affected by agonists.  Conclusions:   Engineered high-level GnRH receptor activation inhibits growth of a subset of papillomavirus-immortalized prostate cells.

This study investigates the chemopreventive potential of α-tomatine on androgen-independent human prostatic adenocarcinoma PC-3 cells.  Methodology/principal findings:   Treatment of highly aggressive human prostate cancer PC-3 cells with α-tomatine resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell growth with a half-maximal efficient concentration (EC(50)) value of 1.67±0.3 µM. It is also less cytotoxic to normal human liver WRL-68 cells and normal human prostate RWPE-1 cells. Assessment of real-time growth kinetics by cell impedance-based Real-Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA) showed that α-tomatine exhibited its cytotoxic effects against PC-3 cells as early as an hour after treatment. The inhibitory effect of α-tomatine on PC-3 cancer cell growth was mainly due to induction of apoptosis as evidenced by positive Annexin V staining and decreased in mitochondrial membrane potential but increased in nuclear condensation, polarization of F-actin, cell membrane permeability and cytochrome c expressions. Results also showed that α-tomatine induced activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9, suggesting that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways are involved. Furthermore, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation was inhibited, which in turn resulted in significant decreased in NF-κB/p50 and NF-κB/p65 in the nuclear fraction of the treated cells compared to the control untreated cells. These results provide further insights into the molecular mechanism of the anti-proliferative actions of α-tomatine.

Study design:   In this biomarker sub-study of the Nashville Men's Health Study (NMHS), we included 494 NMHS participants, consisting of 98 high-grade (Gleason≥7) and 100 low-grade cancer cases, 133 prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) cases, and 163 controls without cancer or PIN at biopsy. Linear and logistic regression were used to determine associations between blood Ca, Mg, and the Ca/Mg ratio across controls and case groups while adjusting for potential confounding factors.  Results:   Serum Mg levels were significantly lower, while the Ca/Mg ratio was significantly higher, among high-grade cases vs. controls (p = 0.04, p = 0.01, respectively). Elevated Mg was significantly associated with a lower risk of high-grade prostate cancer (OR = 0.26 (0.09, 0.85)). An elevated Ca/Mg ratio was also associated with an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (OR = 2.81 (1.24, 6.36) adjusted for serum Ca and Mg). In contrast, blood Ca levels were not significantly associated with prostate cancer or PIN.Mg, Ca, or Ca/Mg levels were not associated with low-grade cancer, PIN, PSA levels, prostate volume, or BPH treatment.

FM coordinates were used to determine rotation in the sagittal, transverse, and coronal planes, and CT contours of the prostate and rectum were used to determine rotation along the sagittal plane. An adaptive technique based on a subset of images (n = 6; planning and first 5 treatment CTs) to reduce systematic rotation errors in the sagittal plane was tested. The standard deviation (SD) of systematic rotation from FM coordinates was 7.6°, 7.7°, and 5.0° in the sagittal, transverse and coronal planes. The corresponding SD of random error was 10.2°, 15.8°, and 6.5°. Errors in the sagittal plane, determined from prostate and rectal contours, were 10.1° (systematic) and 7.7° (random).

The other analyses included changes in the prostate-specific antigen level, bone lesions, soft tissue disease, and bone turnover markers (urine N-telopeptide and bone alkaline phosphatase).  Results:   The present trial was designed before the publication of the recent Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria; however, the analyses are presented to conform to the updated guidelines. A total of 48 patients received dasatinib. A lack of disease progression was observed in 21 patients (44%) at week 12 and in 8 (17%) at week 24. Urine N-telopeptide was reduced by ≥40% from baseline in 22 (51%) of 43 patients, and bone alkaline phosphatase was decreased in 26 (59%) of 44 patients. Dasatinib was well-tolerated, with only 6 patients (13%) with drug-related grade 3-4 adverse events and 3 (6%) with grade 3 adverse events. The most common treatment-related adverse events (≥20%) were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and anorexia.  Conclusions:   Dasatinib 100 mg QD has a favorable safety profile and maintains a similar degree of activity as the previously reported twice-daily dosing schedules. These data support additional study of dasatinib 100 mg QD for metastatic CRPC.""","""['Evan Y Yu', 'Christophe Massard', 'Mitchell E Gross', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Stephane Culine', 'Gary Hudes', 'Edwin M Posadas', 'Cora N Sternberg', 'George Wilding', 'Géralyn C Trudel', 'Prashni Paliwal', 'Karim Fizazi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Phase II study of dasatinib in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dasatinib combined with docetaxel for castration-resistant prostate cancer: results from a phase 1-2 study.', 'A randomized phase II study of cediranib alone versus cediranib in combination with dasatinib in docetaxel resistant, castration resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Dasatinib dosing strategies in Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia.', 'Once-daily dasatinib for treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.', 'The Androgen Receptor and Its Crosstalk With the Src Kinase During Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Whole-Body 18F-Fluoride PET SUV Imaging to Monitor Response to Dasatinib Therapy in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases: Secondary Results from ACRIN 6687.', 'A Phase 2 Trial of Abiraterone Followed by Randomization to Addition of Dasatinib or Sunitinib in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Src Family Kinases as Therapeutic Targets in Advanced Solid Tumors: What We Have Learned so Far.', 'Randomized Phase II Trial of Abiraterone Alone or With Dasatinib in Men With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC).']"""

Increased activation of the androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway is thought to promote castration-resistant prostate cancer. Herein, we report that peroxiredoxin (Prx) gene expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer and hydrogen peroxide-resistant cells was upregulated. Prx2 was overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer at the mRNA and protein levels and was localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm. Overexpression of Prx2 increased AR transactivation, whereas Prx2 overexpression in the nucleus suppressed AR transactivation. These effects of Prx2 on AR activity were abolished by the introduction of function-disrupting mutations into Cys⁵¹ and Cys¹⁷². Silencing Prx2 reduced the expression of androgen-regulated genes and suppressed the growth of AR-expressing prostate cancer cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Furthermore, Prx2 knockdown also suppressed cell growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. These findings indicate that Prx2 is involved in the proliferation of AR-expressing prostate cancer cells by modulating AR activity. Designing therapeutics targeting Prx2 may offer a novel strategy for developing treatments for prostate cancer, including castration-resistant prostate cancer, which is dependent on AR signaling.""","""['Masaki Shiota', 'Akira Yokomizo', 'Eiji Kashiwagi', 'Ario Takeuchi', 'Naohiro Fujimoto', 'Takeshi Uchiumi', 'Seiji Naito']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Human heterochromatin protein 1 isoform HP1beta enhances androgen receptor activity and is implicated in prostate cancer growth.', 'Castration resistance of prostate cancer cells caused by castration-induced oxidative stress through Twist1 and androgen receptor overexpression.', 'In vivo knockdown of the androgen receptor results in growth inhibition and regression of well-established, castration-resistant prostate tumors.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Increased androgen receptor transcription: a cause of castration-resistant prostate cancer and a possible therapeutic target.', 'The beginning of GPX2 and 30 years later.', 'Peroxiredoxins-The Underrated Actors during Virus-Induced Oxidative Stress.', 'The critical role of peroxiredoxin-2 in colon cancer stem cells.', 'Upregulation of Peroxiredoxin-2 in Well-Differentiated Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors and Its Utility as a Biomarker for Predicting the Response to Everolimus.', 'Celastrol induces ROS-mediated apoptosis via directly targeting peroxiredoxin-2 in gastric cancer cells.']"""

It uses anti-androgen agents, castration, or both to eliminate cancer promoting effect of testicular androgen. The p53 tumor suppressor controls a major pathway that can block cell proliferation or induce apoptosis in response to diverse forms of oncogenic stress. Activation of the p53 pathway in cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy and recently developed MDM2 antagonists, the nutlins, have validated this in preclinical models of cancer. The crosstalk between p53 and androgen receptor (AR) signaling suggest that p53 activation could augment antitumor outcome of androgen ablation in prostate cancer. Here, we test this hypothesis in vitro and in vivo using the MDM2 antagonist, nutlin-3 and the p53 wild-type prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP.  Results:   Using charcoal-stripped serum as a cellular model of androgen deprivation, we show an increased apoptotic effect of p53 activation by nutlin-3a in the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and to a lesser extent in androgen-independent but responsive 22Rv1 cell line. This effect is due, at least in part, to an enhanced downregulation of AR expression by activated p53. In vivo, androgen deprivation followed by two weeks of nutlin administration in LNCaP-bearing nude mice led to a greater tumor regression and dramatically increased survival.  Conclusions:   Since majority of prostate tumors express wild-type p53, its activation by MDM2 antagonists in combination with androgen depletion may offer an efficacious new approach to prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Christian Tovar', 'Brian Higgins', 'Kenneth Kolinsky', 'Mingxuan Xia', 'Kathryn Packman', 'David C Heimbrook', 'Lyubomir T Vassilev']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Analysis of the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3 in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Activation of the p53 pathway by the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a overcomes BCL2 overexpression in a preclinical model of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma associated with t(14;18)(q32;q21).', 'Pharmacological activation of the p53 pathway by nutlin-3 exerts anti-tumoral effects in medulloblastomas.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacologic activation of p53 by small-molecule MDM2 antagonists.', 'Resveratrol inhibits TRAF6/PTCH/SMO signal and regulates prostate cancer progression.', 'Novel MDM2 Inhibitor XR-2 Exerts Potent Anti-Tumor Efficacy and Overcomes Enzalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Transcription Factors as Novel Therapeutic Targets and Drivers of Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Biologically informed deep neural network for prostate cancer discovery.', 'miRNAs expression signature potentially associated with lymphatic dissemination in locally advanced prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Sixty-four patients received a single injection of escalating doses of (188)Re-HEDP with various dosages. Vital signs were observed before and after treatment for 8 weeks; adverse effects and rebound pain were recorded within 8 weeks after injection. Blood counts, biochemical parameters, and electrocardiogram were also measured over a period of 8 weeks. Clinical follow-up studies including the bone pain score and the Karnofsky performance score were performed. Pain response was scored by a four-point pain-rating scale as complete, marked, mild, and no response.  Results:   No adverse effects or clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, and biochemical parameters in patients were observed, and there was no statistical change in alkaline phosphate levels in patients before or after treatment. The overall nadir of thrombopenia was at week 4, leucopoenia at week 3, and anemia at week 8. At week 8, the mean level of platelets and leukocytes returned to baseline levels. The pain score descended from 8.11 to 7.74 on the day of therapy, with a nadir of 4.89 at week 4, and up to 6.67 at week 8 after therapy (p < 0.05).

Several AR-related factors or modulators have been reported to influence AR activity. Whether and how these factors cooperatively modulate the AR activity has not been well defined. In the present study, the combined effect of p160 coactivators, short CAG length (encoding a short polyQ tract), and AR mutations on AR transactivation in a yeast system was evaluated. It was found that the short polyQ tract can upregulate the transactivation of the wild-type (WT) AR and partial-function (PF) AR mutants in response to a physiological level (10(-9) M) of dihydrotestosterone. Addition of a p160 coactivator (SRC-1 or TIF2) to the above systems resulted in a significant increase in the ligand-stimulated transactivation. Although the androgen antagonist bicalutamide could suppress the activity of androgen-activated WT or PF ARs, it was unable to do so for gain-of-function AR mutants. A combination of the short polyQ tract and coactivator TIF2 acted cooperatively on the WT AR and PF AR mutants to enhance their transactivation in response to either a low level of dihydrotestosterone (10(-10) M) or adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone. Taken together, this finding suggests that the modulated AR activity may involve early in the carcinogenesis of CaP. Additionally, these data support the concept that a given CaP in which the AR activity is modulated by multiple AR modulators may progress more readily to castrate resistance.""","""['Xu-Bao Shi', 'Lingru Xue', 'Donghua Shi', 'Ralph W deVere White']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Corepressive function of nuclear receptor coactivator 2 in androgen receptor of prostate cancer cells treated with antiandrogen.', 'Prolonged androgen receptor loading onto chromatin and the efficient recruitment of p160 coactivators contribute to androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of p160-mediated coactivation with increasing androgen receptor polyglutamine length.', 'Expression and function of androgen receptor coactivators in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Coactivators in Regulation of Growth and Differentiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Corepressive function of nuclear receptor coactivator 2 in androgen receptor of prostate cancer cells treated with antiandrogen.']"""

However, genetic alterations responsible for initiation and acquisition of metastatic phenotypes by prostate cancer are not well defined. We have observed a consistent change in chromosome 5 in an in vitro cell model of human prostate carcinogenesis in which the near-diploid cells from the surrounding tissue of an adenocarcinoma of the prostate obtained from a 42-year-old patient were subjected to in vitro cell culture and passages. We have examined three different passages of this cell strain by conventional and molecular cytogenetic methods and have seen an increased number of alterations in chromosome 5 in higher passage cells, with accompanying changes in cell morphology. In late passages of this cell line, no cell showed two normal copies of chromosome 5 as analyzed by G-banding and fluorecent in situ hybridization (FISH). The long arm (q) of chromosome 5 was either missing or involved in structural rearrangements. This observation suggests that the q arm of chromosome 5 may carry a tumor suppressor gene(s) that is well-expressed in normal prostate tissue, but when one of these tumor suppressor gene(s) is mutated or deleted and its encoded mRNA and protein are differentially expressed or not expressed at all in the prostate cells, then it may lead to initiation of tumor growth and development. Cytogenetic analyses of early passage cells in this cell strain revealed that approximately 78.8% of metaphases were normal, with a 46,XY chromosome constitution, and 21.2% of cells had clonal alterations mostly of chromosomes 5, 7, 8, 15, 16 and Y. In the middle passages, abnormal cells increased in number (78.26%) and also showed a large number of chromosomal changes. In the late passages, all cells showed structural and numerical abnormalities of the same chromosomes, in addition to some new markers; no cells were found to have a normal karyotype. These chromosomal aberrations could be considered early markers of prostate carcinogenesis. Some of the markers present in late passage cells were similar to those reported in a well-characterized prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP.""","""['M Ozen', 'A Multani', 'S Chang', 'A Voneschenbach', 'L Chung', 'S Pathak']""","""[]""","""1996""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['A novel human cell culture model for the study of familial prostate cancer.', ""Cytogenetic analysis and population study in P3HR-1 cell line derived from Burkitt's lymphoma."", 'Cytogenetic study on a human colorectal carcinoma cell line (HR-8348).', 'Identification of the breakpoint-flanking markers on chromosomes 1 and 17 of a constitutional translocation T(1;17)(P36;Q12-21) in a patient with neuroblastoma.', 'Molecular cytogenetic characterization of pancreas cancer cell lines reveals high complexity chromosomal alterations.', 'Met-Independent Hepatocyte Growth Factor-mediated regulation of cell adhesion in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Permanent phenotypic and genotypic changes of prostate cancer cells cultured in a three-dimensional rotating-wall vessel.', 'Amplification of the Y chromosome in three murine tumor cell lines transformed in vivo by different human prostate cancers.']"""

In order to further develop model systems for the study of 1,25(OH)(2)D action and to elucidate the mechanism of growth-inhibition, we studied several human prostate cell lines immortalized with either simian virus 40 (SV40) or human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV). The SV40-transformed cell lines P69SV40-T and P153SV40-T were not growth-inhibited by 1,25(OH)(2)D at concentrations as high as 100 nM, whereas the HPV-transformed cells PZ-HPV-7 and CA-HPV-10 were growth-inhibited. All cell lines expressed VDR, and VDR mRNA was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. All cells exhibited induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA, a 1,25(OH)(2)D responsive gene, after 1,25(OH)(2)D treatment. In an attempt to understand the apparent dissociation of 1,25(OH)(2)D actions in the SV40-transformed cells, we turned to the human prostate cancer cell line DU 145. These cells, like the SV40-transformed cells, are not growth-inhibited but demonstrate induction of 24-hydroxylase mRNA after 1,25(OH)(2)D treatment. DU 145 cells contain a mutated retinoblastoma gene (Rb) which contributes to their uncontrolled growth, analogous to the disruption of Rb by SV40 and HPV. We compared DU,145 cells to DU 145 cells transfected with normal Rb (DU 145/Rb). Similar to DU 145, DU 145/Rb cells were not growth-inhibited by 1,25(OH)(2)D, while 24-hydroxylase mRNA was induced. These results suggest that divergent pathways mediate the growth-inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D and its induction of 24-hydroxylase.

Survival rates are high, making preventive care maintenance important. Factors associated with prostate-cancer cases' preventive care in the short-term (Year 1) and long-term (Year 5), and how survivors' care compares to non-cancer controls, require study.  Methods:   This retrospective, controlled SEER-Medicare study included loco-regional prostate cancer cases age ≥ 66 in fee-for-service Medicare diagnosed in 2000 and surviving ≥ 12 months, and non-cancer controls matched to cases on socio-demographics and survival. Outcomes included influenza vaccination, cholesterol screening, and colorectal cancer screening. Independent variables were number of physician visits, physician specialties visited, initial prostate cancer treatment, socio-demographic characteristics, and case-control status.  Results:   There were 13,507 cases and 13,507 controls in Year 1, and 10,482 cases and 10,482 controls in Year 5. In Years 1 and 5, total number of visits (6/6 outcomes) and primary care provider (PCP) visits (5/6 outcomes) were most consistently associated with preventive care receipt. In Year 1, prostate cancer cases were more likely than controls to receive influenza vaccination (48% vs. 45%) but less likely to receive colorectal cancer screening (29% vs. 31%) (both p < 0.0001). In Year 5, prostate cancer cases remained more likely than controls to receive influenza vaccination (46% vs. 44%; p < 0.0001).

Methods:   The antiproliferative activity of R1530 was investigated in a range of human tumor, endothelial and fibroblast cell lines. Tolerability and antitumor activity were assessed in mice bearing a range of human tumor xenografts, and anti-angiogenic properties were established in the murine corneal pocket assay. R1530 pharmacokinetics in mice were established.  Results:   R1530 strongly inhibited human tumor cell proliferation. Growth factor-driven proliferation of endothelial and fibroblast cells was also inhibited. Significant tumor growth inhibition was demonstrated in a lung cancer xenograft model with a range of once daily, weekly and twice-weekly doses of R1530 (3.125-50 mg/kg qd, 100 mg/kg qw, 100 mg/kg biw). Daily doses were most effective in the lung cancer model and also had significant growth inhibitory effects in models of colorectal, prostate, and breast tumors. Tumor regression occurred in all models treated with the maximum tolerated daily dose (50 mg/kg). The doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg qd resulted in biologically significant increased survival in all tested models. After oral administration in nude mice, R1530 showed good tissue penetration. Exposure was dose dependent up to 100 mg/kg with oral administration.  Conclusions:   R1530 has demonstrated activity against a range of tumor models in vitro and in vivo and is an effective inhibitor of angiogenesis.

Methods:   An association study between 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TLR4 gene and prostate cancer was performed in 463 Korean male subjects including 240 prostate cancer patients and 223 healthy controls.

Results:   The statistical analysis revealed that one SNP at the 3'UTR (rs11536889) showed significant association with the risk of prostate cancer (P (corr) = 0.005, OR = 1.81). One common haplotype (ht2) was also significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer (P (corr) = 0.009, OR = 1.77).

Several functions have been attributed to its activity in cancer, including a histidine kinase activity, DNA repair, and regulation of other proteins involved in metastatic formation. While in breast cancer, NM23-H1 overexpression indicates a benign status through impairing progression of disease, its function is opposite in other cancers; e.g., neuroblastoma. To further understand this dichotomy of function in cancer, we have analyzed its function in prostate cancer, in which the relationship between NM23-H1 expression and prognostic state is today controversial. In vitro, overexpression of NM23-H1 in PC3 cells inhibited their cell motility, while downregulation of NM23-H1 expression in these cells by RNA interference showed enhanced cell motility. Immunohistochemistry analysis performed on 346 prostate cancer tissue samples showed a relationship between high levels of NM23-H1 expression in the nuclei of these tumorigenic cells and elevated Gleason score, with high levels of NM23-H1 cytoplasmic staining related to metastatic stage. This retrospective survival study demonstrates that high levels of NM23-H1 expression in the cytoplasm determine recurrence of prostate-specific antigen levels only in those patients with metastatic disease.

The expression of AR-Vs in the clinically most important metastatic site, the bone, has, however, not been well documented. Our aim was therefore to compare levels of AR-Vs in hormone-naive (HN) and CRPC bone metastases in comparison to primary PC and non-malignant prostate tissue, as well as in relation to AR protein expression, whole-genome transcription profiles and patient survival.  Methodology/principal findings:   Hormone-naïve (n = 10) and CRPC bone metastases samples (n = 30) were obtained from 40 patients at metastasis surgery. Non-malignant and malignant prostate samples were acquired from 13 prostatectomized men. Levels of full length AR (ARfl) and AR-Vs termed AR-V1, AR-V7, and AR-V567es mRNA were measured with RT-PCR and whole-genome transcription profiles with an Illumina Beadchip array. Protein levels were examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Transcripts for ARfl, AR-V1, and AR-V7 were detected in most primary tumors and metastases, and levels were significantly increased in CRPC bone metastases. The AR-V567es transcript was detected in 23% of the CRPC bone metastases only. A sub-group of CRPC bone metastases expressed LBD-truncated AR proteins at levels comparable to the ARfl. Detectable AR-V567es and/or AR-V7 mRNA in the upper quartile, seen in 1/3 of all CRPC bone metastases, was associated with a high nuclear AR immunostaining score, disturbed cell cycle regulation and short survival.  Conclusions/significance:   Expression of AR-Vs is increased in CRPC compared to HN bone metastases and associated with a particularly poor prognosis. Further studies are needed to test if patients expressing such AR-Vs in their bone metastases benefit more from drugs acting on or down-stream of these AR-Vs than from therapies inhibiting androgen synthesis.""","""['Emma Hörnberg', 'Erik Bovinder Ylitalo', 'Sead Crnalic', 'Henrik Antti', 'Pär Stattin', 'Anders Widmark', 'Anders Bergh', 'Pernilla Wikström']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Characterization of prostate cancer bone metastases according to expression levels of steroidogenic enzymes and androgen receptor splice variants.', 'Androgen receptor variants occur frequently in castration resistant prostate cancer metastases.', 'Subgroups of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases Defined Through an Inverse Relationship Between Androgen Receptor Activity and Immune Response.', 'Androgen receptor variants: RNA-based mechanisms and therapeutic targets.', 'Role of androgen receptor splice variants, their clinical relevance and treatment options.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'A role for androgen receptor variant 7 in sensitivity to therapy: Involvement of IGFBP-2 and FOXA1.', 'Investigating microRNA Profiles in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases and Functional Effects of microRNA-23c and microRNA-4328.', 'α-Mangostin Promotes In Vitro and In Vivo Degradation of Androgen Receptor and AR-V7 Splice Variant in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of Palomid 529 (P529), a novel TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor, in association with docetaxel (DTX) and cisplatin (CP). This work utilizes a wide panel of prostatic cancer cell lines with or without basal activation of Akt as well as two in vivo models of aggressive HRPC. The blockade of Akt/mTOR activity was associated to reduced cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Comparison of IC50 values calculated for PTEN-positive and PTEN-negative cell lines as well as the PTEN transfection in PC3 cells or PTEN silencing in DU145 cells revealed that absence of PTEN was indicative for a better activity of the drug. In addition, P529 synergized with DTX and CP. The strongest synergism was achieved when prostate cancer (PCa) cells were sequentially exposed to CP or DTX followed by treatment with P529. Treatment with P529 before the exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in a moderate synergism, whereas intermediated values of combination index were found when drugs were administered simultaneously. In vivo treatment of a combination of P529 with DTX or CP increased the percentage of complete responses and reduced the number of mice with tumor progression.

Recently, there have been several attempts to integrate interactome and transcriptome data to identify subnetworks that provide limited interpretations of known and candidate cancer genes, as well as increase classification accuracy. However, these studies provide little information about the detailed roles of identified cancer genes.  Results:   To provide more information to the network, we constructed the network by incorporating genetic interactions and manually curated gene regulations to the protein interaction network. To make our newly constructed network cancer specific, we identified edges where two genes show different expression patterns between cancer and normal phenotypes. We showed that the integration of various datasets increased classification accuracy, which suggests that our network is more complete than a network based solely on protein interactions. We also showed that our network contains significantly more known cancer-related genes than other feature selection algorithms. Through observations of some examples of cancer-specific subnetworks, we were able to predict more detailed and interpretable roles of oncogenes and other cancer candidate genes in the prostate cancer cells.

Correlations between BMI and PSA changes per year were negative but not statistically significantly different from zero.  Conclusions:   The individual man scrutinizing his PSA and weight year to year can expect a slight annual increase in both, but changes in PSA from one year to the next cannot be attributed to weight gain or loss.""","""['Donna P Ankerst', 'Brad H Pollock', 'Yuanyuan Liang', 'Nidzara Dizdarevic', 'Sergiy Kyrylenko', 'Andreas Boeck', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Robin Leach']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Body mass index adjusted prostate-specific antigen and its application for prostate cancer screening.', 'Body mass index does not predict prostate-specific antigen or percent free prostate-specific antigen in men undergoing prostate cancer screening.', 'The effect of obesity and lower serum prostate-specific antigen levels on prostate-cancer screening results in American men.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Prediction of future risk of any and higher-grade prostate cancer based on the PLCO and SELECT trials.', 'Age-specific reference ranges of prostate-specific antigen in the elderly of Amirkola: A population-based study.']"""

Our experiments on five human cell lines revealed substantial differences among tested analogs. Analogs with side-chains extended by one (PRI-1906) or two carbon units (PRI-1907) displayed similar or elevated cell-differentiating activity in comparison to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D), whereas further extending side-chain resulted in substantially lower biological activity (PRI-1908 and PRI-1909). Similar pattern of cell-differentiating activities to that observed in human cell lines has also been shown in blast cells isolated from patients diagnosed with AML. The ability of the analogs to activate expression of CYP24A1 gene has been studied in HL60 cell line. The analog PRI-1906 activated expression of CYP24A1 similarly to 1,25D, while PRI-1907 weaker than 1,25D. In addition, the analogs PRI-1906 and PRI-1907 were able to moderately inhibit proliferation and significantly activate expression of CYP24A1 mRNA in prostate cancer cells PC-3.

This activity may be mediated by Bcl-G (a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family) which can be covalently modified by FUBI. FAU gene expression has been shown to be down-regulated in human breast, prostate and ovarian tumours, and this down-regulation is strongly associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. We demonstrate here that ectopic FAU expression increases basal apoptosis in human T-cell lines and 293T/17 cells, whereas it has only a transient stimulatory effect on ultraviolet-C (UVC)-induced apoptosis. Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing of FAU gene expression has no effect on basal apoptosis, but attenuates UV-induced apoptosis. Importantly, prior knockdown of Bcl-G expression ablates the stimulation of basal apoptosis by FAU, consistent with an essential downstream role for Bcl-G, itself a candidate tumour suppressor, in mediating the apoptosis regulatory role of FAU. In 293T/17 cells, Bcl-G knockdown also attenuates UV-induced apoptosis, so that Bcl-G may constitute a common factor in the pathways by which both FAU and UV-irradiation induce apoptosis. UV irradiation increases Bcl-G mRNA levels, providing an explanation for the transient nature of the effect of ectopic FAU expression on UV-induced apoptosis. Since failure of apoptosis is fundamental to the development of many cancers, the pro-apoptotic activity of the Fau/Bcl-G pathway offers an attractive explanation for the putative tumour suppressor role of FAU.""","""['Mark R Pickard', 'Mirna Mourtada-Maarabouni', 'Gwyn T Williams']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Dysregulated expression of Fau and MELK is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.', 'Apoptosis regulators Fau and Bcl-G are down-regulated in prostate cancer.', 'fau and its ubiquitin-like domain (FUBI) transforms human osteogenic sarcoma (HOS) cells to anchorage-independence.', 'FAU regulates carboplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.', 'Bax.

Methods and materials:   Using the Prostate Brachytherapy Questionnaire, we previously examined patients' subjective experience of the brachytherapy procedure when it involved one implant and hospitalization with the template in situ for 2 days (Group 1). The protocol was subsequently changed to two implants, 2 weeks apart as outpatients. Fifty-eight patients treated with the new protocol (Group 2) completed the same questionnaire.

Little is known about how men experience bodily alterations in everyday life through the course of the prostate cancer and treatment. The aim of this study was to show how men with prostate cancer experience bodily changes and how these alterations influence daily life.  Method:   The study was conducted via qualitative interviews with a phenomenological hermeneutic approach. We interviewed ten men (aged 58-83) with prostate cancer who received endocrine therapy as the primary treatment method.  Results:   The results showed that five themes were important for the men's experiences of their bodily alterations throughout the course of the illness: ""something is 'wrong'"", ""when the body becomes troublesome"", ""to be well or to be ill"", ""dealing with the alterations"" and ""to talk about cancer and the intimate details"". Initially, the shock of receiving a cancer diagnosis and the physical changes in their bodies were at the forefront of many patients' minds. Eventually, the impact of the side effects became more evident, which caused problems in everyday life. Yet, the men were able to reflect on the impact of treatment on their everyday lives.

We developed a reproducible technique for performing MR-CT fusion and compared the resulting dosimetry to standard CT-based PID.  Methods and materials:   CT and T1-weighted MR images for 45 patients were fused and aligned based on seed distribution. The T2-weighted MR image was then fused to the aligned T1. Reproducibility of the fusion technique was tested by inter- and intraobserver variability for 13 patients. Dosimetry was computed for the prostate as a whole and for the prostate divided into anterior and posterior sectors of the base, mid-prostate, and apex.  Results:   Inter- and intraobserver variability for the fusion technique showed less than 1% variation in D90. MR-CT fusion D90 and CT D90 were nearly equivalent for the whole prostate, but differed depending on the identification of superior extent of the base (p = 0.007) and on MR/CT prostate volume ratio (p = 0.03). Sector analysis showed a decrease in MR-CT fusion D90 in the anterior base (ratio 0.93 ±0.25, p < 0.05) and an increase in MR-CT fusion D90 in the apex (p < 0.05). The volume of extraprostatic tissue encompassed by the V100 is greater on MR than CT. Factors associated with this difference are the MR/CT volume ratio (p < 0.001) and the difference in identification of the inferior extent of the apex (p = 0.03).  Conclusions:   We developed a reproducible MR-CT fusion technique that allows MR-based dosimetry. Comparing the resulting postimplant dosimetry with standard CT dosimetry shows several differences, including adequacy of coverage of the base and conformity of the dosimetry around the apex.

High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy as a monotherapy is appealing, but its use is still investigational. A Phase II trial was undertaken to explore the value of such treatment in low-to-intermediate risk prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   This was a single-institution, prospective study. Eligible patients had low-risk prostate cancer features but also Gleason scores of 7 (51% of patients) and stage T2b to T2c cancer. Treatment with HDR brachytherapy with a single implant was administered over 2 days. One of four fractionation schedules was used in a dose escalation study design: 3 fractions of 10, 10.5, 11, or 11.5 Gy. Patients were assessed with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 2.0 for urinary toxicity, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer scoring schema for rectal toxicity, and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire to measure patient-reported health-related quality of life. Biochemical failure was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir plus 2 ng/ml.  Results:   Between 2003 and 2008, 79 patients were enrolled. With a median follow-up of 39.5 months, biochemical relapse occurred in 7 patients. Three- and 5-year actuarial biochemical control rates were 88.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.0-96.2%) and 85.1% (95% CI, 72.5-94.5%), respectively. Acute grade 3 urinary toxicity was seen in only 1 patient. There was no instance of acute grade 3 rectal toxicity. Rates of late grade 3 rectal toxicity, dysuria, hematuria, urinary retention, and urinary incontinence were 0%, 10.3%, 1.3%, 9.0%, and 0%, respectively. No grade 4 or greater toxicity was recorded. Among the four (urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal) domains assessed with the EPIC questionnaire, only the sexual domain did not recover with time.

In the clinic, prostate volume estimation involves modeling the prostate as an ellipsoid or a spheroid from transrectal ultrasound, or T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, this requires some degree of manual intervention, and may not always yield accurate estimates. In this article, we present a multifeature active shape model (MFA) based segmentation scheme for estimating prostate volume from in vivo T2-weighted MRI.  Materials and methods:   We aim to automatically determine the location of the prostate boundary on in vivo T2-weighted MRI, and subsequently determine the area of the prostate on each slice. The resulting planimetric areas are aggregated to yield the volume of the prostate for a given patient. Using a set of training images, the MFA learns the most discriminating statistical texture descriptors of the prostate boundary via a forward feature selection algorithm. After identification of the optimal image features, the MFA is deformed to accurately fit the prostate border. An expert radiologist segmented the prostate boundary on each slice and the planimetric aggregation of the enclosed areas yielded the ground truth prostate volume estimate. The volume estimation obtained via the MFA was then compared against volume estimations obtained via the ellipsoidal, Myschetzky, and prolated spheroids models.  Results:   We evaluated our MFA volume estimation method on a total 45 T2-weighted in vivo MRI studies, corresponding to both 1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla field strengths. The results revealed that the ellipsoidal, Myschetzky, and prolate spheroid models overestimated prostate volumes, with volume fractions of 1.14, 1.53, and 1.96, respectively. By comparison, the MFA yielded a mean volume fraction of 1.05, evaluated using a fivefold cross-validation scheme. A correlation with the ground truth volume estimations showed that the MFA had an r(2) value of 0.82, whereas the clinical volume estimation schemes had a maximum value of 0.70.  Conclusions:   Our MFA scheme involves minimal user intervention, is computationally efficient and results in volume estimations more accurate than state of the art clinical models.""","""['Robert Toth', 'B Nicolas Bloch', 'Elizabeth M Genega', 'Neil M Rofsky', 'Robert E Lenkinski', 'Mark A Rosen', 'Arjun Kalyanpur', 'Sona Pungavkar', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Acad Radiol""","""['Automated detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution ex vivo MRI.', 'Fully automated prostate segmentation on MRI: comparison with manual segmentation methods and specimen volumes.', 'Differentiation of prostate cancer from normal prostate tissue in an animal model: conventional MRI and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.', 'Computer-assisted analysis of peripheral zone prostate lesions using T2-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate - technique and clinical applications.', 'Fully automated multiorgan segmentation of female pelvic magnetic resonance images with coarse-to-fine convolutional neural network.', 'SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING FOR PELVIC MR IMAGE SEGMENTATION BASED ON MULTI-TASK RESIDUAL FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS.', 'STRAINet: Spatially Varying sTochastic Residual AdversarIal Networks for MRI Pelvic Organ Segmentation.', 'Deformable MR Prostate Segmentation via Deep Feature Learning and Sparse Patch Matching.', 'Deformable segmentation of 3D MR prostate images via distributed discriminative dictionary and ensemble learning.']"""

Currently, needle-tip identification on ultrasound images can be subject to large uncertainty and errors because of ultrasound image quality and imaging artifacts. To address this problem, we developed a method based on physical measurements with simple and practical implementation to improve the accuracy and robustness of needle-tip identification.  Methods and materials:   Our method uses measurements of the residual needle length and an off-line pre-established coordinate transformation factor, to calculate the needle-tip position on the TRUS images. The transformation factor was established through a one-time systematic set of measurements of the probe and template holder positions, applicable to all patients. To compare the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method and the conventional method (ultrasound detection), based on the gold-standard X-ray fluoroscopy, extensive measurements were conducted in water and gel phantoms.  Results:   In water phantom, our method showed an average tip-detection accuracy of 0.7 mm compared with 1.6 mm of the conventional method.

Methods and materials:   A total of 630 postprostatectomy patients were retrospectively identified who were treated with three-dimensional conformal RT. Of these, 441 were found to be treated for salvage indications. Biochemical failure was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 0.2 ng/mL or greater above nadir with another PSA increase or the initiation of salvage ADT. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the absence of biochemical failure, continued PSA rise despite salvage therapy, initiation of systemic therapy, clinical progression, or distant failure. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed to determine which factors predict PFS.  Results:   Low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients made up 10%, 24%, and 66% of patients, respectively. The mean RT dose was 68 Gy. Twenty-four percent of patients received concurrent ADT (cADT). Regional pelvic nodes were treated in 16% of patients. With a median follow-up of 3 years, the 3-year PFS was 4.0 years for cADT vs. 3.4 years for cADT patients (p = 0.22). Multivariate analysis showed that concurrent ADT (p = 0.05), Gleason score (p < 0.001), and pre-RT PSA (p = 0.03) were independent predictors of PFS. When patients were stratified by risk group, the benefits of cADT (hazard ratio, 0.65; p = 0.046) were significant only for high-risk patients.  Conclusions:   This retrospective study showed a PFS benefit of concurrent ADT during salvage prostate RT.

While resistance to docetaxel remains an obstacle in prostate cancer chemotherapy, sodium selenite, has been exploited as a new therapeutic approach. Currently, development of therapies affecting a multitude of cell targets, have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance. This association may reduce systemic toxicity counteracting a wide range of side effects. Here we report the effect of docetaxel and sodium selenite combination on the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, derived from bone metastasis. Therefore we evaluate cell growth, cell cycle progression, viability, mitochondria membrane potential, cytochrome C, Bax/Bcl2 ratio, caspase-3 expression and reactive oxygen species production. Our results suggest that sodium selenite and docetaxel combination have a synergistic effect on cell growth inhibition (67%) compared with docetaxel (22%) and sodium selenite (24%) alone. This combination also significantly induced cell death, mainly by late apoptosis vs necrosis, which is correlated with mitochondria membrane potential depletion. On the other hand, cytochrome C, Bax/Bcl2 ratio and caspase-3, known as proapoptotic factors, significantly increased in the presence of sodium selenite alone, but not in the presence of docetaxel in monotherapy or in combination with sodium selenite. These findings suggest that docetaxel and sodium selenite combination may be more effective on prostate cancer treatment than docetaxel alone warranting further evaluation of this combination in prostate cancer therapeutic approach.""","""['Mariana Freitas', 'Vera Alves', 'Ana Bela Sarmento-Ribeiro', 'Anabela Mota-Pinto']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Azacitidine improves antitumor effects of docetaxel and cisplatin in aggressive prostate cancer models.', 'Combined Effect of Sodium Selenite and Ginsenoside Rh2 on HCT116 Human Colorectal Carcinoma Cells.', 'Inorganic selenium sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through superoxide/p53/Bax-mediated activation of mitochondrial pathway.', 'Prostate cancer and chemotherapy: standards care and perspectives.', 'The role of docetaxel based therapy for prostate cancer in the era of targeted medicine.', 'Synergistic enhancement of cell death by triple combination therapy of docetaxel, ultrasound and microbubbles, and radiotherapy on PC3 a prostate cancer cell line.', 'Ketone-selenoesters as potential anticancer and multidrug resistance modulation agents in 2D and 3D ovarian and breast cancer in vitro models.', 'Dexmedetomidine upregulates microRNA-185 to suppress ovarian cancer growth via inhibiting the SOX9/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Relationship Between Selenium in Human Tissues and Breast Cancer: a Meta-analysis Based on Case-Control Studies.', 'Superoxide-mediated ferroptosis in human cancer cells induced by sodium selenite.']"""

A key step in the process of metastasis is the attachment of circulatory tumor cells to target organ endothelium. This process is thought to be mediated by lectins, a class of cell surface proteins that bind two or more carbohydrate groups. Using fluorescent microscopy and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated lectins, the presence of various carbohydrates was examined in the following tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cell lines: rat prostate epithelial (EPYP-2, EPYP-1), rat prostate endothelial (YPEN-2, YPEN-1, YPEN-2PV), Dunning rat prostate cancer cell lines (MLL, ML, AT6.3, AT.1, AT2.1, GP9F3), and three tumorigenic human prostate cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, PC3 bone). The lectin Triticum vulgaris (WGA) was found to readily bind the carbohydrates N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid on the plasma membrane of tumorigenic cell lines. Interestingly, WGA bound carbohydrates located to the nucleus and cytoplasm in non-tumorigenic cell lines, indicating that N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid residues are preferentially expressed on the cell membrane of prostate cancer cells. Lectin staining patterns in cell lines of varying metastatic potential revealed no significant difference between highly metastatic vs. low metastatic cell lines. Observations revealed an absence of N-acetylgalactosamine and L-fucose in all rat Dunning, epithelial and endothelial cell lines as well as all human prostate cancer cell lines except for the androgen insensitive human prostate cancer cell line PC3, in which L-fucose residues were detected in the nucleus and on the plasma membrane. PC3 bone cells, which metastasized selectively to bone, demonstrated the presence of galactose residues whereas PC3 cells did not, suggesting that preference for target organ endothelium may be influenced by the expression of carbohydrate residues.

In the present study, cell growth was assessed by means of the computer-assisted microscope analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei combined with the mathematical Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi paving techniques, which enabled the cell colony patterns, i.e. their density and level of organisation, to be determined. The results from a previous study (Janssen et al, Prostate, in press) combined with those of the present one show that DHT was found to activate proliferation of the LNCaP model, as evidenced by increase in size of colonies, increase in number of cells within colonies, increase in cell colony density and, accordingly, decrease in mean segment length value (which is the distance between adjacent cell nuclei). Using the same criteria, DHT was found inhibitory on growth of DU145 cell line, and devoid of significant effect on PC3 cell line. Basic FGF was found to be a powerful stimulator of growth of PC3 cell Line and to induce a weaker stimulation of DU145 cell line. On LNCaP cell line, it increased the size of colonies without increase of the number of cells per colony. This feature can be explained by a decrease in cell colony density. With respect to the same colonies, the proliferation index (percentage of cells in the S+G2 phases of the cell cycle) was found similar to that of the controls. This suggests that the increase in the size of the colonies is due to a difference of spreading of the cells on their supports.

Assessing the pelvic floor muscles of male patients can be an invasive process that causes discomfort, making it worthwhile to evaluate alternatives to the conventional method of Digital Rectal Examination (DRE). Real time ultrasound (RTUS) has been used with female patients as an alternative to internal assessments. This paper examines the reliability and validity of assessing the male pelvic floor using abdominal RTUS.  Methods:   Twenty-eight men (mean age 66.2) with a history of treatment for prostate cancer were recruited to the study. They were assessed via DRE and RTUS. Findings from the procedures were correlated for evaluation of validity, and the RTUS readings were repeated by different therapists to assess reliability.  Results:   Measurements on screen correlated moderately with DRE findings (r = 0.57, P = 0.002), and RTUS was found to have good reliability (Intra-class Correlation Coefficient = 0.90). Continent men had more movement of the bladder wall on RTUS than those who were incontinent (P = 0.043). Scar tissue and an inability to maintain a moderately full bladder were found to cause the most difficulty in getting a complete picture of pelvic floor movement.  Conclusions:   RTUS can be used clinically to examine male pelvic floor function, and its use would be enhanced once it has been established by DRE that a true pelvic floor contraction is occurring. RTUS can give an indication of pelvic floor function as an alternative measurement method when DRE is contraindicated.""","""['Irmina Nahon', 'Gordon Waddington', 'Roger Adams', 'Grace Dorey']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Neurourol Urodyn""","""['Ultrasound-based motor control training for the pelvic floor pre- and post-prostatectomy: Scoring reliability and skill acquisition.', 'Reliability of real-time ultrasound to detect pelvic floor muscle contraction in urinary incontinent women.', 'Validation of new ultrasound parameters for quantifying pelvic floor muscle contraction.', 'Restoring pelvic floor function in men: review of RCTs.', 'Preoperative and postoperative ultrasound assessment of stress urinary incontinence.', 'Verbal Instruction for Pelvic Floor Muscle Contraction among Healthy Young Males.', 'Validity of Estimation of Pelvic Floor Muscle Activity from Transperineal Ultrasound Imaging in Men.', 'A pilot randomized trial of conventional versus advanced pelvic floor exercises to treat urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: a study protocol.', 'Reliability of superficial male pelvic floor structural measurements using linear-array transperineal sonography.', 'Dynamics of male pelvic floor muscle contraction observed with transperineal ultrasound imaging differ between voluntary and evoked coughs.']"""

Methods:   In a large nested case-control study of prostate cancer in the Physicians' Health Study (1982-2004), 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and genotyped to capture common variation within the TLR4 gene as well as 5 kb up and downstream. Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess associations of these SNPs with total prostate cancer incidence, and with prostate cancers defined as advanced stage/lethal (T3/T4, M1/N1(T1-T4), lethal) or high Gleason grade (7 (4 + 3) or greater). Cox-proportional hazards regression was used to assess progression to metastases and death among prostate cancer cases.  Results:   The study included 1,267 controls and 1,286 incident prostate cancer cases, including 248 advanced stage/lethal and 306 high grade cases. During a median follow-up of 10.6 years, 183 men died of prostate cancer or developed distant metastases. No statistically significant associations between the TLR4 SNPs were found for total prostate cancer incidence, including SNPs for which an association was reported in other published studies. Additionally, there were no significant associations with TLR4 SNPS and the incidence of advanced stage/lethal, or high grade cancers; nor was there evidence among prostate cancer cases for associations of TLR4 SNPs with progression to prostate cancer specific mortality or bony metastases.

However, genetic studies have indicated that it has anti-tumorigenic effects in certain cancers. The pathological and clinical significance of c-Fes in prostate cancer are unknown.  Methods:   Expression of c-Fes was evaluated in normal glands, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), cancer cells in tissues of knock-in mouse adenocarcinoma prostate (KIMAP) model, and prostate cancer patients free of metastasis. Expression of c-Fes was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and quantified by using the immunoreactivity score (IRS) (staining intensity × percentage of positive cells). Relationships between c-Fes expression and pT stage, Gleason's score (GS), and biochemical recurrence in patients who underwent radical surgery were also investigated.  Results:   In KIMAP, the percentage in normal glands, PIN and cancer cells positive for c-Fes expression were 0 (0/7), 25.0 (2/8), and 100% (7/7), respectively. In human tissues, c-Fes expression was also significantly higher in cancer cells than in normal cells and PIN, and it correlated with pT stage (P < 0.001) and GS (P = 0.047). Multivariate analysis showed that c-Fes expression was an independent predictor of poor outcome poor prognosis (hazard ratio = 3.21, 95% confidence interval = 1.11-9.37, P = 0.032).

This study sought to better define the role of SGK1 and GR in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was performed for AR, GR, and SGK1 on primary prostate cancers (n = 138) and 18 prostate cancers from patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Relative staining intensity was compared utilizing a Fisher's exact test. Univariate analyses were performed using log-rank and chi-squared tests to evaluate prostate cancer recurrence with respect to SGK1 expression.  Results:   SGK1 expression was strong (3+) in 79% of untreated cancers versus 44% in androgen-deprived cancers (P = 0.003). Conversely, GR expression was present in a higher proportion of androgen-deprived versus untreated cancers (78% vs. 38%, P = 0.002). High-grade cancers were nearly twice as likely to have relatively low (0 to 2+) SGK1 staining compared to low-grade cancers (13.8% vs. 26.5%, P = 0.08). Low SGK1 expression in untreated tumors was associated with increased risk of cancer recurrence (adjusted log-rank test P = 0.077), 5-year progression-free survival 47.8% versus 72.6% (P = 0.034).  Conclusions:   SGK1 expression is high in most untreated prostate cancers and declines with androgen deprivation. However, these data suggest that relatively low expression of SGK1 is associated with higher tumor grade and increased cancer recurrence, and is a potential indicator of aberrant AR signaling in these tumors. GR expression increased with androgen deprivation, potentially providing a mechanism for the maintenance of androgen pathway signaling in these tumors.

Methods:   In this study a targeted proteomic analysis was conducted to identify the differential expression of cell surface proteins in human benign (BPH-1) versus malignant (LNCaP and PC-3) prostate epithelial cells. We identified EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) as a key candidate and shRNA functional approaches were subsequently applied to determine the role of EMMPRIN in prostate cancer cell adhesion, migration, invasion as well as cytoskeleton organization.  Results:   EMMPRIN was found to be highly expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells compared to BPH-1 cells, consistent with a correlation between elevated EMMPRIN and metastasis found in other tumors. No significant changes in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, or apoptosis were detected in EMMPRIN knockdown cells compared to the scramble controls. Furthermore, EMMPRIN silencing markedly decreased the ability of PC-3 cells to form filopodia, a critical feature of invasive behavior, while it increased expression of cell-cell adhesion and gap junction proteins.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that EMMPRIN regulates cell adhesion, invasion, and cytoskeleton reorganization in prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   In the population-based 2001 Connecticut Family Health Study, 1019 participants reported on 20 578 first-degree relatives (FDR) and second-degree relatives (SDR). Of those, 2605 relatives were sampled for confirmation of cancer reports on breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer. Confirmation sources included state cancer registries, Medicare databases, the National Death Index, death certificates, and health-care facility records. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for reports on lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer and after stratification by sex, age, education, and degree of relatedness and used to estimate report accuracy. Pairwise t tests were used to evaluate differences between the two strata in each stratified analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Patients without pain had a significantly lower 2-year risk of progression in both groups. Without ADT testosterone remained at castrate level for 4 months. After the first and second IAD cycle 92% and 46%, respectively, had a normalized testosterone. No QOL difference was found, although more side effects occurred in CAD.  Conclusions:   Metastatic prostate cancer patients with high baseline PSA, pain, and high PSA nadir have a poor prognosis with ADT. Patients with low PSA nadir do significantly worse with IAD compared with CAD. Low testosterone after ADT and incomplete testosterone recovery may explain similar QOL.

Azadirachta indica (common name: neem) contains multiple active compounds that have potent anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. The present study investigates the novel targets of the anticancer activity of ethanol extract of neem leaves (EENL) in vitro and evaluates the in vivo efficacy in the prostate cancer models. Analysis of the components in the EENL by mass spectrometry suggests the presence of 2',3'-dehydrosalannol, 6-desacetyl nimbinene, and nimolinone. Treatment of C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 prostate cancer cells with EENL inhibited the cell proliferation. Genome-wide expression profiling, using oligonucleotide microarrays, revealed genes differentially expressed with EENL treatment in prostate cancer cells. Functional analysis unveiled that most of the up-regulated genes were associated with cell death, and drug metabolism, and the down-regulated genes were associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination, and repair functions. Quantitative PCR confirmed significant up-regulation of 40 genes and immunoblotting revealed increase in the protein expression levels of HMOX1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and AKR1B10. EENL treatment inhibited the growth of C4-2B and PC-3M-luc2 prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice. The suppression of tumor growth is associated with the formation of hyalinized fibrous tumor tissue and the induction of cell death by apoptosis. These results suggest that EENL-containing natural bioactive compounds could have potent anticancer property and the regulation of multiple cellular pathways could exert pleiotrophic effects in prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Saswati Mahapatra', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Michael W Holmes', 'Charles Y F Young', 'John C Cheville', 'Manish Kohli', 'Eric W Klee', 'Donald J Tindall', 'Krishna Vanaja Donkena']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""AAPS J""","""['Preclinical evaluation of the supercritical extract of azadirachta indica (neem) leaves in vitro and in vivo on inhibition of prostate cancer tumor growth.', 'Antiangiogenic Effects and Therapeutic Targets of Azadirachta indica Leaf Extract in Endothelial Cells.', 'A supercritical CO2 extract of neem leaf (A. indica) and its bioactive liminoid, nimbolide, suppresses colon cancer in preclinical models by modulating pro-inflammatory pathways.', 'Neem components as potential agents for cancer prevention and treatment.', 'Potential of neem (Azadirachta indica L.) for prevention and treatment of oncologic diseases.', 'Potential of Azadirachta indica as a Capping Agent for Antiviral Nanoparticles against SARS-CoV-2.', 'Exploring the therapeutic potential of Neem (Azadirachta Indica) for the treatment of prostate cancer: a literature review.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.', 'The HMOX1 Pathway as a Promising Target for the Treatment and Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 of 2019 (COVID-19).', 'A review of the anticancer activity of Azadirachta indica (Neem) in oral cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to determine the relation between body composition, leptin, and adiponectin levels with the prevalence and aggressiveness of PCa in men of Mendoza, Argentina. Seventy volunteers between 50 and 80 years (35 healthy men as control group and 35 with PCa) were selected. The PCa group was subclassified according to the Gleason Score (GS). Digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, and prostatic biopsy were performed; PSA, testosterone, leptin, and adiponectin levels were determined; and a nutritional interview including anthropometric measurements and a food frequency questionnaire was carried out. Statistical analysis was performed by Student t test, ANOVA I, and Bonferroni (p < 0.05). Body mass index and percentage of body fat mass were not statistically different between PCa and control groups. However, body fat mass was higher in subjects with more aggressive tumors (p = 0.032). No differences were observed regarding leptin levels between the groups. Nevertheless, leptin levels were higher in subjects with high GS (p < 0.001). Adiponectin levels showed no statistical differences regarding the presence and aggressiveness of the tumor (p = 0.131). Finally, consumption and nutrient intake did not differ in the studied groups.

ERG and ETV1 are the most common ETS members observed in these genetic alterations. The high prevalence of these rearrangements and their biological significance represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods and findings:   We recently reported the development of YK-4-279, a small molecule inhibitor of EWS-FLI1 oncoprotein in Ewing's Sarcoma. Since ERG and ETV1 belong to the same class of ETS factors as FLI1, we tested the ability of YK-4-279 to inhibit biological functions of ERG and ETV1 proteins in prostate cancer. YK-4-279 inhibited ERG and ETV1 mediated transcriptional activity in a luciferase assay. YK-4-279 also decreased ERG and ETV1 downstream target mRNA and protein expression in ETV1-fusion positive LNCaP and ERG fusion positive VCaP cells. YK-4-279 reduced the motility of LNCaP cells in a scratch assay and the invasive phenotype of both LNCaP and VCaP cells in a HUVEC invasion assay. Fusion-negative PC3 cells were unresponsive to YK-4-279. SiRNA mediated ERG knockdown in VCaP cells resulted in a loss of drug responsiveness. Concurrently, transient ERG expression in PC-3 cells resulted in increased invasive potential, which was reduced by YK-4-279.  Conclusion:   These data demonstrate that YK-4-279 inhibits ERG and ETV1 biological activity in fusion-positive prostate cancer cells leading to decreased motility and invasion. Therefore, YK-4-279 may have an impact on metastasis in prostate cancer and it may be further evaluated for its clinical applications in prostate cancer in addition to Ewing's sarcoma.""","""['Said Rahim', 'Elspeth M Beauchamp', 'Yali Kong', 'Milton L Brown', 'Jeffrey A Toretsky', 'Aykut Üren']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['ETS factors in prostate cancer.', 'A small molecule inhibitor of ETV1, YK-4-279, prevents prostate cancer growth and metastasis in a mouse xenograft model.', 'Molecular subtyping of primary prostate cancer reveals specific and shared target genes of different ETS rearrangements.', 'EWS-FLI1, EWS-ERG, and EWS-ETV1 oncoproteins of Ewing tumor family all suppress transcription of transforming growth factor beta type II receptor gene.', 'Clinical potential of the ERG oncoprotein in prostate cancer.', 'Nifuroxazide Activates the Parthanatos to Overcome TMPRSS2:ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'The DNA/RNA helicase DHX9 contributes to the transcriptional program of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'ETS factors in prostate cancer.', 'YK-4-279 Attenuates Progression of Pre-Existing Pigmented Lesions to Nodular Melanoma in a Mouse Model.']"""

The goals of this study are to measure serum EPCA levels in a cohort of patients with PCa prior to the treatment, and to evaluate the clinical value of serum EPCA.  Methods:   Pretreatment serum EPCA levels were determined with an ELISA in 77 patients with clinically localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy and 51 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who received primary androgen deprivation therapy, and were correlated with clinicopathological variables and disease progression. Serum EPCA levels were also examined in 40 healthy controls.  Results:   Pretreatment mean serum EPCA levels were significantly higher in PCa patients than in controls (16.84 ± 7.60 ng/ml vs. 4.12 ± 2.05 ng/ml, P<0.001). Patients with locally advanced and metastatic PCa had significantly higher serum EPCA level than those with clinically localized PCa (22.93 ± 5.28 ng/ml and 29.41 ± 8.47 ng/ml vs. 15.17 ± 6.03 ng/ml, P = 0.014 and P<0.001, respectively). Significantly elevated EPCA level was also found in metastatic PCa compared with locally advanced disease (P < 0.001). Increased serum EPCA levels were significantly and positively correlated with Gleason score and clinical stage, but not with PSA levels and age. On multivariate analysis, pretreatment serum EPCA level held the most significantly predictive value for the biochemical recurrence and androgen-independent progression among pretreatment variables (HR = 4.860, P<0.001 and HR = 5.418, P<0.001, respectively).

We have previously reported gene amplification of critical members of this pathway with the development of castrate-resistant disease. In addition, we have shown that rising Raf-1 expression, with the development of CRPC, influences time to biochemical relapse. We therefore sought to further analyse the role of both Raf-1 and its downstream target MAPK in the molecular pathogenesis of CRPC.  Methods:   Protein expression of Raf-1 and MAPK, including their activation status, was analysed using immunohistochemistry in a database of 65 paired tumour specimens obtained before and after the development of CRPC and correlated with other members of the pathway.  Results:   Patients whose nuclear expression of MAPK rose with the development of CRPC had a significantly shorter median time to death following biochemical relapse (1.40 vs 3.00 years, P=0.0255) as well as reduced disease-specific survival when compared with those whose expression fell or remained unchanged (1.16 vs 2.62 years, P=0.0005). Significant correlations were observed between protein expression of Raf-1 and MAPK with the type 1 receptor tyrosine kinases, Her2 and epidermal growth factor receptor, as well as the transcription factor AP-1 in CRPC tumours.  Conclusion:   We conclude that the Her2/Raf-1/MAPK/AP-1 axis may promote the development of CRPC, leading to early relapse, and reduced disease-specific survival.

Experimental design:   Patients with prostate cancer detectable by serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) following radical prostatectomy received 3 to 4 months of androgen suppression therapy, and were then randomized (2:1) to receive sipuleucel-T (n = 117) or control (n = 59). The primary endpoint was time to biochemical failure (BF) defined as serum PSA ≥ 3.0 ng/mL. PSA doubling time (PSADT), time to distant failure, immune response, and safety were also evaluated.  Results:   Median time to BF was 18.0 months for sipuleucel-T and 15.4 months for control (HR = 0.936, P = 0.737). Sipuleucel-T patients had a 48% increase in PSADT following testosterone recovery (155 vs. 105 days, P = 0.038). With only 16% of patients having developed distant failure, the treatment effect favored sipuleucel-T (HR = 0.728, P = 0.421). The most frequent adverse events in sipuleucel-T patients were fatigue, chills, and pyrexia. Immune responses to the immunizing antigen were greater in sipuleucel-T patients at Weeks 4 and 13 (P < 0.001, all) and were sustained prior to boosting as measured in a subset of patients a median of 22.6 months (range: 14.3-67.3 months) following randomization.  Conclusions:   No significant difference in time to BF could be shown. The finding of increased PSADT in the sipuleucel-T arm is consistent with its biologic activity in ADPC.

PIK3CA mutations, which are found in many cancer patients, activate the PI3K pathway, resulting in cancer development and progression. We previously identified CH5132799 as a novel PI3K inhibitor. Thus, this study aimed to clarify the biochemical and antitumor activity of CH5132799 and elucidate the correlation between CH5132799 response and genetic alterations in the PI3K pathway.  Experimental design:   Kinase inhibitory activity was profiled in cell-free assays. A large panel of human breast, ovarian, prostate, and endometrial cancer cell lines, as well as xenograft models, were used to evaluate the antitumor activity of CH5132799, followed by analysis for genetic alterations. Effects on Akt phosphorylation induced by mTORC1 inhibition were tested with CH5132799 and compared with mTORC1 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.  Results:   CH5132799 selectively inhibited class I PI3Ks and PI3Kα mutants in in vitro kinase assays. Tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations were significantly sensitive to CH5132799 in vitro and were remarkably regressed by CH5132799 in in vivo mouse xenograft models. In combination with trastuzumab, tumors disappeared in the trastuzumab-insensitive breast cancer model with the PIK3CA mutation. Moreover, CH5132799 did not reverse a negative feedback loop of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and induced regression against tumors regrown after long-term mTORC1 inhibitor treatment.  Conclusions:   CH5132799 is a selective class I PI3K inhibitor with potent antitumor activity against tumors harboring the PIK3CA mutations.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective database was created of all men who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy over 3 years. Men were 49% African or African Caribbean, and 51% Central or South American. Information about prostate specific antigen, cholesterol, hepatitis A, B and C, human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, tuberculin skin testing and histology were collected.  Results:   Hepatitis C antibody detection correlated with prostate cancer OR 11.2 (95% CI 3.0 to 72.4). The odds of prostate cancer increased annually (p = 0.0003). However, no correlation was found between prostate cancer and the following: PSA, biopsy date, repeat biopsy, more than 12 cores at biopsy, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein, risk measure reported with free and total PSA, hepatitis B surface antibody, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical small acinar proliferation. Histologic prostatitis and basal cell hyperplasia were inversely correlated with prostate cancer. Syphilis of unknown duration occurred in 17% of men with indeterminate correlation to prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   In Inner City men of African and African-Caribbean, or Central and South American descent, prostate specific antigen levels did not correlate with prostate cancer. Hepatitis C antibody detection correlates significantly with prostate cancer. One prostate biopsy is sufficient to diagnose statistically significant prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Between June 1997 and March 2000, patients with localized prostate cancer were included into a focal therapy protocol. Inclusion criteria were: PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL, ≤ 3 positive biopsies with only 1 lobe involved, clinical stage ≤ T2a, Gleason score ≤ 7 (3+4), negative CT scan and bone scan. Hemi-ablation of the prostate was performed with the Ablatherm® device. Survival, complication rates and urinary continence were evaluated. Control biopsies were performed at 1 year. Treatment failure was defined as a positive biopsy or need for salvage therapy.  Results:   Twelve patients with a mean age 70 years were included. Median follow-up was 10 years. Control prostate biopsies were negative in 11/12 (91%) patients. Overall survival was 83% (10/12) and cancer specific survival was 100% at 10 years. Two patients died from other causes. Recurrence free survival was 90% (95% CI; 0.71-1) at 5 years, and 38% (95% CI; 0.04-0.73) at 10 years. Five patients had salvage therapy with repeat HIFU (n = 1) or hormonal therapy (n = 4) and all salvage patients were alive at 10 years. No patients developed lymph node or bone metastasis. No patients suffered from urinary incontinence. International Prostate Symptom Score was stable at 1 year. Complications included two urinary tract infections and one episode of acute urinary retention.

Methods:   The recorded consultations of 156 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients from three Canadian cancer centers were examined using the Medical Interaction Process System (MIPS). The MIPS findings, independent observer ratings of patient, significant other, and oncologist affective behavior, and derived consultation ratios of patient centeredness, patient directedness, and psychosocial focus, were used to predict patient satisfaction with communication post-consultation and at 12-weeks post-consultation.  Results:   Biomedical content categories were predominant in the consultations, accounting for 86% of utterances, followed by administrative (9%) and psychosocial (5%) utterances. Post-consultation satisfaction with communication was significantly lower for patients whose significant others were rated as more assertive during the consultation, and those rated as more anxious during the consultation. Patients who were rated as more anxious during the consultation, those with lower satisfaction with communication immediately post-consultation and those with shorter consultations were significantly less satisfied with communication at 12-weeks post-consultation.  Conclusions:   Adjuvant treatment consultations in prostate oncology are characterized by a high degree of information-giving by the physician, a predominance of biomedical discussion, and relatively minimal time addressing patients' psychosocial concerns.

Transfection of SgI/SgII increased/decreased cell growth of androgen receptor (AR)-positive/semenogelin-negative CWR22Rv1 in the presence of zinc, whereas it showed marginal effects in AR-negative/semenogelin-negative PC-3 and DU145. Immunohistochemical studies showed that SgI and SgII stain positively in 55 (79%) and 31 (44%) cancer tissues, respectively, which was significantly higher than in corresponding benign tissues [SgI-positive in 13 (19%) cases (P < 0.0001) and SgII-positive in 15 (21%) cases (P = 0.0066)]. Among the histopathological parameters available for our patient cohort, there was an inverse association only between Gleason score (GS) and SgII expression (GS ≤ 7 vs. GS ≥ 8: P = 0.0150; GS7 vs. GS ≥ 8: P = 0.0111). Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests further revealed that patients with SgI-positive/SgII-negative tumor have the highest risk for biochemical recurrence (P = 0.0242).  Conclusions:   These results suggest the involvement of semenogelins in prostate cancer and their prognostic values in predicting cancer progression after radical prostatectomy.

Nodal has been implicated in cancer progression; however, there is no information on expression and functions of Nodal in prostate cancer. In this study, we have investigated the expression of Nodal, its receptors, and its effects on proliferation and migration of human prostate cells.  Methods:   RT-PCR, qPCR, and Western blot analyses were performed to analyze expression of Nodal and Nodal receptors and its effects on phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in prostate cells. The effects on proliferation and migration were determined by (3) H-Thymidine incorporation and cell migration assays in the presence or absence of Nodal receptor inhibitor (SB431542).  Results:   Nodal was highly expressed in WPE, DU145, LNCaP, and LNCaP-C81 cells with low expression in RWPE1 and RWPE2 cells, but not in PREC, PC3 and PC3M cells. Nodal receptors are expressed at varying levels in all prostate cells. Treatment with exogenous Nodal induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in WPE, DU145, and PC3 cells, which was blocked by SB431542. Nodal dose-dependently inhibited proliferation of WPE, RWPE1 and DU145 cells, but not LNCaP and PC3 cells. Nodal induced cell migration in PC3 cells, which was inhibited by SB431542; Nodal had no effect on cell migration in WPE and DU145 cells. The effects of Nodal on cell proliferation and migration are mediated via ALK4 and ActRII/ActRIIB receptors and Smad 2/3 phosphorylation.

Since the use of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing substances such as thapsigargin in prostate cancer therapy is widely discussed in the literature, we investigated the influence of Sec62 protein content on the cellular response to these drugs.  Methods:   Growth effects were analyzed by real-time cell analysis and viability tests in DU145-cells representing an increased SEC62 expression or PC3- and LNCaP-cells representing a similar SEC62 expression compared to non-tumor cells. Ca(2+) -imaging in an established HeLa-system with fluorescent dye was used to study molecular effects of Sec62 depletion.  Results:   We found a lower propensity toward apoptotic cell death after thapsigargin treatment for DU145 cells compared to PC3 or LNCaP and siRNA-mediated silencing of SEC62 resulted in a reduced viability of thapsigargin-treated PC3 cells, indicating that Sec62 functions in cellular stress response. Measurement of cytosolic [Ca(2+) ] demonstrated the influence of Sec62 on the cellular response to thapsigargin on a molecular level. Using real-time cell analysis, we observed the loss of androgen stimulation of LNCaP cells in the presence of thapsigargin, and an additional negative effect on cell growth of Sec62 depletion. Also, for PC3- and DU145-cells Sec62 depletion inhibited growth after thapsigargin treatment.  Conclusions:   Our data indicate a crucial function of Sec62 in the response to thapsigargin-induced ER stress.

In prostate cancer, AC plays a role in progression and resistance to chemotherapy.  Methods:   PC-3 and DU 145 hormone-refractory human prostate cancer cell lines were used. Cells were exposed to 4-HPR, DM102, and combinations; viability, apoptosis, cell migration, ceramide metabolism, and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed.  Results:   Single agent 4-HPR and DM102 (2.5-10 µM) were weakly cytotoxic; however, combinations synergistically decreased cell viably to as low as 1.5% of control. N-oleoylethanolamine (NOE), a frequently employed AC inhibitor, was not effective in producing synergy. The 4-HPR/DM102 regimen enhanced caspase activity and increased [(3) H](dihydro)ceramide and ROS levels 6- and 30-fold over control, respectively. The antioxidant vitamin E, but not the de novo ceramide synthesis inhibitor myriocin, partially rescued cells from 4-HPR/DM102 cytotoxicity. The 4-HPR/DM102 combination also elicited synergistic cytotoxicity in DU 145 cells, another human hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell line.  Conclusion:   This study shows that 4-HPR cytotoxicity is enhanced in a synergistic fashion by inclusion of the AC inhibitor DM102, by a mechanism that enlists generation of ROS, and thus provides a system to raise 4-HPR therapeutic potential.

This case-control study was designed to evaluate the association between germline variations in chromosome 8q24 and prostate cancer risk in Afro-Caribbean Tobago men, a population of predominantly West African ancestry.  Methods:   High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from blood clots using Qiagen kits.

Methods:   A specific monoclonal antibody was developed, validated, and used to characterize for the first time the expression of 5α-reductase-3 protein in 18 benign and 26 malignant human tissue types using immunostaining analyses.  Results and conclusions:   In benign tissues, 5α-reductase-3 immunostaining was high in conventional androgen-regulated human tissues, such as skeletal muscle and prostate. However, high levels of expression also were observed in non-conventional androgen-regulated tissues, which suggest either multiples target tissues for androgens or different functions of 5α-reductase-3 among human tissues. In malignant tissues, 5α-reductase-3 immunostaining was ubiquitous but particularly over-expressed in some cancers compared to their benign counterparts, which suggests a potential role for 5α-reductase-3 as a biomarker of malignancy. In benign prostate, 5α-reductase-3 immunostaining was localized to basal epithelial cells, with no immunostaining observed in secretory/luminal epithelial cells.

The smallest of these is sunflower trypsin inhibitor (SFTI-1), a potent and broad-range protease inhibitor. Recently, we re-engineered the contact β-sheet of SFTI-1 to produce a selective inhibitor of kallikrein-related peptidase 4 (KLK4), a protease associated with prostate cancer progression. However, modifications in the binding loop to achieve specificity may compromise structural rigidity and prevent re-engineered inhibitors from reaching optimal binding affinity.  Methodology/principal findings:   In this study, the effect of amino acid substitutions on the internal hydrogen bonding network of SFTI were investigated using an in silico screen of inhibitor variants in complex with KLK4 or trypsin. Substitutions favouring internal hydrogen bond formation directly correlated with increased potency of inhibition in vitro.

MAN2C1 activates AKT and promotes the formation of PTEN-positive DU145 cell-derived xenograft tumours by imparing endogenous PTEN function. In 659 PC patients who were examined, ~60% of tumours were PTEN positive with elevated AKT activation. Of these, 80% display MAN2C1 overexpression that co-localizes with PTEN. Increases in MAN2C1 were detected only in PTEN-positive prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinomas, and showed a significant association with PC recurrence only in patients with PTEN-positive PCs.

The suitability of prostasomes as blood biomarkers in patients with prostate cancer was tested by using an expanded variant of the proximity ligation assay (PLA). We developed an extremely sensitive and specific assay (4PLA) for detection of complex target structures such as microvesicles in which the target is first captured via an immobilized antibody and subsequently detected by using four other antibodies with attached DNA strands. The requirement for coincident binding by five antibodies to generate an amplifiable reporter results in both increased specificity and sensitivity. The assay successfully detected significantly elevated levels of prostasomes in blood samples from patients with prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy, compared with controls and men with benign biopsy results. The medians for prostasome levels in blood plasma of patients with prostate cancer were 2.5 to sevenfold higher compared with control samples in two independent studies, and the assay also distinguished patients with high and medium prostatectomy Gleason scores (8/9 and 7, respectively) from those with low score (≤ 6), thus reflecting disease aggressiveness.

Here we show that this R122C mutation of the Siglec-XII protein is fixed in the human population, i.e. it occurred prior to the origin of modern humans. Additional mutations have since completely inactivated the SIGLEC12 gene in some but not all humans. The most common inactivating mutation with a global allele frequency of 58% is a single nucleotide frameshift that markedly shortens the open reading frame. Unlike other CD33-related Siglecs that are primarily found on immune cells, we found that Siglec-XII protein is expressed not only on some macrophages but also on various epithelial cell surfaces in humans and chimpanzees. We also found expression on certain human prostate epithelial carcinomas and carcinoma cell lines. This expression correlates with the presence of the nonframeshifted, intact SIGLEC12 allele. Although SIGLEC12 allele status did not predict prostate carcinoma incidence, restoration of expression in a prostate carcinoma cell line homozygous for the frameshift mutation induced altered regulation of several genes associated with carcinoma progression. These stably transfected Siglec-XII-expressing prostate cancer cells also showed enhanced growth in nude mice.

Understanding the biology of prostate cancer and its evolution to an incurable androgen-independent phenotype requires an understanding of the genetic and cellular alterations that lead to the seeding and proliferation of tumor foci in bone, as well as the microenvironment in which these metastases arise. No intensive studies, however, have been conducted on osseous metastatic tissues from patients with metastatic prostate cancer due to lack of access to such tissues for profiling and other research.  Experimental design:   We show, for the first time, a reproducible methodology to obtain high quality clinical tumor tissues metastatic to the bone.

Previously we showed that Par-4-overexpressing colon cancer cells responded more readily to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than their wild-type counterparts. In this study we investigated (i) the effects of the Akt inhibitor, phenylbutyl isoselenocyanate (ISC-4), on tumor growth in nude mice and (ii) bystander effect of Par-4-overexpressing cells on wild-type tumor growth.  Experimental design:   Mice (n = 80) were injected with wild-type HT29 human colon cancer cells in the right flank. Forty of the mice were also injected in the left flank with HT29 cells engineered to overexpress Par-4. The mice were treated with 5-FU, ISC-4, a combination, or vehicle.  Results:   ISC-4 reduced tumor growth, with or without 5-FU. When Par-4-overexpressing tumors were present, wild-type tumors grew more slowly compared to when no Par-4-overexpressing tumors were present. The level of Par-4 protein as well as the Par-4 binding protein, GRP78, was increased in wild-type cells growing in the same mouse as Par-4-overexpressing tumors compared with wild-type tumors growing without Par-4-overexpressing tumors.  Conclusions:   Par-4-overexpressing tumors exhibited a bystander effect on wild-type tumors growing distally in the same mouse. This suggests that gene therapy need not achieve total penetration to have a positive effect on tumor treatment.

Similarly, sulfated hyaluronic acid (sHA) has not been evaluated for biological activity, although it is an HAase inhibitor. In this study, we show that sHA is a potent inhibitor of prostate cancer. sHA blocked the proliferation, motility, and invasion of LNCaP, LNCaP-AI, DU145, and LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells, and induced caspase-8-dependent apoptosis associated with downregulation of Bcl-2 and phospho-Bad. sHA inhibited Akt signaling including androgen receptor (AR) phosphorylation, AR activity, nuclear factor κB (NFκB) activation, and VEGF expression. These effects were traced to a blockade in complex formation between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and HA receptors and to a transcriptional downregulation of HA receptors, CD44, and RHAMM, along with PI3K inhibition. Angiogenic HA fragments or overexpression of myristoylated Akt or HA receptors blunted these effects of sHA, implicating a feedback loop between HA receptors and PI3K/Akt signaling in the mechanism of action. In an animal model, sHA strongly inhibited LNCaP-AI prostate tumor growth without causing weight loss or apparent serum-organ toxicity. Inhibition of tumor growth was accompanied by a significant decrease in tumor angiogenesis and an increase in apoptosis index.

Our main objective was to test accuracy of the new 3D method in men undergoing first and follow-up Bx to rule out prostate cancer (CaP).  Materials and methods:   Patients in the study were men ages 35-87 years (66.1 ± 9.9), scheduled for Bx to rule out CaP, who entered into an IRB-approved protocol. A total of 218 subjects underwent conventional trans-rectal US (TRUS); the tracking system was then attached to the US probe; the prostate was scanned and a 3D reconstruction was created. All Bx sites were visualized in 3D and tracked electronically. In 11 men, a pilot study was conducted to test ability of the device to return a Bx to an original site. In 47 men, multi-parametric 3 Tesla MRI, incorporating T2-weighted images, dynamic contrast enhancement, and diffusion-weighted imaging, was performed in advance of the TRUS, allowing the stored MRI images to be fused with real-time US during biopsy. Lesions on MRI were delineated by a radiologist, assigned a grade of CaP suspicion, and fused into TRUS for biopsy targeting.  Results:   3D Bx tracking was completed successfully in 180/218 patients, with a success rate approaching 95% among the last 50 men. Average time for Bx with the Artemis device was 15 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for MRI fusion and Bx targeting. In the tracking study, an ability to return to prior Bx sites (n=32) within 1.2 ± 1.1 mm SD was demonstrated and was independent of prostate volume or location of Bx site.

Understanding factors that impact cost may allow reduction in cost of prostate cancer care. We identified factors associated with higher costs in a contemporary series of RALP.  Materials and methods:   Total direct cost and clinicopathologic data were available for 264 patients who underwent RALP at our institution between May 2005 and April 2008. We performed linear regression analyses to identify predictors of direct cost using preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables.  Results:   On univariable analyses, operating room (OR) time, placement of a pelvic drain (both P<0.001), complications during surgery (P=0.002) or hospitalization, blood transfusion, and length of stay (all P<0.001) were associated with higher direct costs. On multivariable analysis, none of the preoperative features were found to predict direct costs. Of the intraoperative factors, OR time (P<0.001) and pelvic drain placement (P=0.006) were associated with higher direct costs. A longer OR time, length of stay, and usage of transfusions (all P<0.001) during the postoperative course were independently associated with higher direct costs.  Conclusions:   Of factors that are available preoperatively, none seems to be useful to predict added costs for individual patients undergoing RALP. Higher costs for RALP are driven by events occurring during the procedure or postoperative hospital stay.""","""['Christian Bolenz', 'Amit Gupta', 'Claus G Roehrborn', 'Yair Lotan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Cost comparison of robotic, laparoscopic, and open radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'A short-term cost-effectiveness study comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic and open retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'The influence of body mass index on the cost of radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Costs of radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Is robotic surgery cost-effective: yes.', 'Developing and validating a multivariable prediction model for predicting the cost of colon surgery.', 'Regional differences in total hospital charges between open and robotically assisted radical prostatectomy in the United States.', 'Pre- and intra-operative predictors of postoperative hospital length of stay in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in China: a retrospective observational study.', 'Patient comorbidity predicts hospital length of stay after robot-assisted prostatectomy.', 'Independent predictors of prolonged operative time during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Low androgen and low oxygen are two co-existing conditions frequently found in prostate cancer tissue following surgical or medical castration. In LNCaP cells, androgen deprivation and hypoxia together boosted AMPK activation to a higher level than that seen with either condition alone. The augmented AMPK response was associated with improved viability and the induction of autophagy. These observations suggest that a threshold of AMPK activity has to be attained in order to trigger autophagy, since neither androgen deprivation nor hypoxia by itself was capable of pushing AMPK activity past that threshold. Beclin-1 was identified as a potential downstream target of AMPK in turning on the autophagic cascade. If autophagy was blocked by chemical inhibition or RNA interference of key regulators, e.g., AMPK or beclin-1, more cells would die by apoptosis. The occurrence of autophagy is thus a survival mechanism for androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells to escape from an androgen-deprived and hypoxic subsistence.""","""['Rishi Raj Chhipa', 'Yue Wu', 'Clement Ip']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Autophagy protects LNCaP cells under androgen deprivation conditions.', 'Autophagy pathway is required for IL-6 induced neuroendocrine differentiation and chemoresistance of prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Survival advantage of AMPK activation to androgen-independent prostate cancer cells during energy stress.', ""AMPK's double-faced role in advanced stages of prostate cancer."", 'AMPK as a potential anticancer target - friend or foe?', 'Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane: Overview and inextricable link with cancer.', 'Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Targeting Drug Chemo-Resistance in Cancer Using Natural Products.', 'Skeletal Muscle-Adipose Tissue-Tumor Axis: Molecular Mechanisms Linking Exercise Training in Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, DU145 expressed an increased amount of the 28 kD form of cathepsin B. When E64, a cysteine protease inhibitor was added, a decreased amount of the active cathepsin D was expressed. Furthermore, when cathepsin B was added to concentrated plasma membrane homogenates, urokinase was processed to its active form at 33 kD. E64 inhibited the ability of both cell lines to degrade fibronectin. An in vitro Boyden chamber demonstrated that DU145 was more motile than LNCAP and that preincubation with E64 could decrease motility of both cell lines.

Methods:   Sextant biopsy of the prostate was performed for 619 patients aged 45-75 years who had unremarkable palpation findings and PSA values in the range of 4 to 10 ng/ml. The f/tPSA ratio was determined, transrectal ultrasound examination was performed, the prostate volume was measured and the PSA density calculated. The relationship between the various test variables - and their combination - and the histology results was investigated using logistic regression.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 131 of 619 patients. Analysis of the aforementioned test variables by means of logistic regression revealed that the combination of the parameters f/tPSA ratio, PSA density and patient's age can significantly increase the sensitivity and specificity of PSA in predicting prostate cancer compared with the use of these parameters on an individual basis. With an assumed limit value of 5% for performance of punch biopsy, 31% of biopsies could be avoided in practice. In such a case, only 3% of instances of prostate cancer would have gone undetected.

In this study, we sought to investigate the mechanisms of regulation of PAR-4 gene expression in MCF-7 cells treated with E2 or IGF-1. E2 (10 nM) and IGF-1 (12.5 nM) each down-regulated PAR-4 expression in MCF-7 cells after 24 h of treatment. The effect of E2 was dependent on ER activation, as demonstrated by an increase in PAR-4 expression when cells were pretreated for 1 h with 1 µM ICI-182,780 (ICI) before receiving E2 plus ICI. The effect of IGF-1 was abolished by pre-treatment for 1 h with 30 µM LY294002 (a specific PI3-K inhibitor), and significantly inhibited by 30 µM SB202190 (a specific p38MAPK inhibitor). We also demonstrated that E2 acts synergistically with IGF-1, resulting in greater down-regulation of PAR-4 mRNA expression compared with E2 or IGF-1 alone.

We found that embelin inhibited constitutive STAT3 activation in a variety of human cancer cell lines such as U266, DU-145, and SCC4 cells. The suppression of STAT3 was mediated through inhibition of the activation of JAK2 and c-Src. Pervanadate treatment also reversed the embelin-induced down-regulation of STAT3, suggesting the involvement of a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Indeed, we found that embelin-induced the expression of the tyrosine phosphatase PTEN and deletion of the PTEN gene by small interfering RNA abolished the ability of embelin to inhibit STAT3 activation. Besides, embelin failed to suppress STAT3 activation in PTEN-null PC3 cells, thus indicating that the inhibitory effect of embelin on STAT3 is PTEN-dependent. Embelin down-regulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products; this correlated with the suppression of cell proliferation and invasion, and the induction of apoptosis through the activation of caspase-3.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease remain largely unknown. Therefore, the identification of tumor specific molecules that serve as targets for the development of new cancer drugs is considered to be a major goal in cancer research. The mouse Engrailed-2 (En-2) gene, which is a homeobox-containing transcription factor was recently identified as a candidate oncogene in breast cancer. Here, we demonstrate that En-2 is over-expressed in human prostate cancer cells as compared to normal prostate epithelial cells. In addition, our data suggests that EN2 expression may be positively modulated by PAX2 transcription factor.

In the past decade, much attention in cancer research has been focused on the function of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Prohibitin is a potential tumor suppressor which was originally identified because of its anti-proliferative activities. Subsequent investigations led to the discovery of prohibitin mutations in sporadic breast cancers. Recent studies established that prohibitin directly regulates E2F-mediated transcription and growth suppression Prohibitin further attracted the attention of the translational cancer research community when it was recently connected to the regulation of estrogen receptor and androgen receptor activity. Prohibitin was shown to be required for the growth suppression of breast cancer cells induced by estrogen antagonists, and for therapeutic responses to androgen antagonists in prostate cancer. Through the application of new molecular technologies, additional novel functions of prohibitin have been revealed, demonstrating diverse and essential roles of this highly-conserved protein in regulating cell growth.""","""['Sheng Wang', 'Douglas V Faller']""","""[]""","""2008""","""None""","""Transl Oncogenomics""","""['Prohibitin and the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit BRG1 are required for effective androgen antagonist-mediated transcriptional repression of androgen receptor-regulated genes.', 'Prohibitin requires Brg-1 and Brm for the repression of E2F and cell growth.', 'BRG1/BRM and prohibitin are required for growth suppression by estrogen antagonists.', 'Prohibitin: a potential therapeutic target in tyrosine kinase signaling.', 'Significance of prohibitin domain family in tumorigenesis and its implication in cancer diagnosis and treatment.', 'Essential Protein PHB2 and Its Regulatory Mechanisms in Cancer.', 'Failure to Guard: Mitochondrial Protein Quality Control in Cancer.', 'Lamprey PHB2 maintains mitochondrial stability by tanslocation to the mitochondria under oxidative stress.', 'Genome-wide identification of loci associated with growth in rainbow trout.', 'Prostatic Carcinogenesis: More Insights.']"""

The prostate cases were also planned with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT). Dose distributions were evaluated through comparisons of dose-volumetric histograms and in-house IMRT protocol constraints, as well as validated via ion chamber array measurements. DAT plans for prostate showed a statistically comparable achievement of tumor conformity and dose sparing for bladder and rectum when compared to IMRT. Dose on femoral heads were similar to those achieved using 3DCRT. DAT could be planned with similar results to those obtained in IMRT for the dose constraints of the defined structures by using a 360° arc for the brain lesion and several arcs including noncoplanar ones for the head-and-neck and spinal tumors. Experimental validation of the calculated dose distributions via gamma analysis of composite distributions for DAT provided that more than 95% of the pixels satisfy the criteria 3 mm-3%, which was similar to that of IMRT. The average number of monitor units was approximately five times lower than IMRT. In conclusion, DAT is capable of providing conformal dose distributions to the targets accomplishing many of the IMRT dose constraints simultaneously.

Because of these biological activities, coffee may be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a prospective analysis of 47,911 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study who reported intake of regular and decaffeinated coffee in 1986 and every 4 years thereafter. From 1986 to 2006, 5035 patients with prostate cancer were identified, including 642 patients with lethal prostate cancers, defined as fatal or metastatic. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between coffee and prostate cancer, adjusting for potential confounding by smoking, obesity, and other variables. All P values were from two-sided tests.  Results:   The average intake of coffee in 1986 was 1.9 cups per day. Men who consumed six or more cups per day had a lower adjusted relative risk for overall prostate cancer compared with nondrinkers (RR = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68 to 0.98, P(trend) = .10). The association was stronger for lethal prostate cancer (consumers of more than six cups of coffee per day: RR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.75, P(trend) = .03). Coffee consumption was not associated with the risk of nonadvanced or low-grade cancers and was only weakly inversely associated with high-grade cancer. The inverse association with lethal cancer was similar for regular and decaffeinated coffee (each one cup per day increment: RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.01, P = .08 for regular coffee and RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.00, P = .05 for decaffeinated coffee). The age-adjusted incidence rates for men who had the highest (≥6 cups per day) and lowest (no coffee) coffee consumption were 425 and 519 total prostate cancers, respectively, per 100 000 person-years and 34 and 79 lethal prostate cancers, respectively, per 100 000 person-years.

The Fn14 receptor is expressed at relatively low levels in normal tissues, but it is known to be dramatically elevated in a number of tumor types, including brain and breast tumors. Thus, it seems to be an excellent candidate for therapeutic intervention. We first analyzed Fn14 expression in human tumor cell lines. Fn14 was expressed in a variety of lines including breast, brain, bladder, skin, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, colon, prostate, and cervical cancer cell lines. We then developed an immunoconjugate containing a high-affinity anti-Fn14 monoclonal antibody (ITEM-4) conjugated to recombinant gelonin (rGel), a highly cytotoxic ribosome-inactivating N-glycosidase. Both ITEM-4 and the conjugate were found to bind to cells to an equivalent extent. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that ITEM4-rGel specifically and rapidly (within 2 hours) internalized into Fn14-positive T-24 bladder cancer cells but not into Fn14-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Cytotoxicity studies against 22 different tumor cell lines showed that ITEM4-rGel was highly cytotoxic to Fn14-expressing cells and was 8- to 8 × 10(4)-fold more potent than free rGel. ITEM4-rGel was found to kill cells by inducing apoptosis with high-mobility group box 1 protein release. Finally, ITEM4-rGel immunoconjugate administration promoted long-term tumor growth suppression in nude mice bearing T-24 human bladder cancer cell xenografts.

Acetaminophen, a commonly used pain reliever, is not traditionally considered an NSAID but can have anti-inflammatory effects. Few studies have examined the association between long-term acetaminophen use and prostate cancer incidence.  Methods:   We examined the association between acetaminophen use and prostate cancer incidence among 78,485 men in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. Information on acetaminophen use was obtained from a questionnaire completed at study enrollment in 1992 and updated by using follow-up questionnaires in 1997 and every two years thereafter. Relative risks (RR) were estimated by using proportional hazards regression models. All models were adjusted for age, race, education, body mass index, diabetes, NSAID use, and history of prostate-specific antigen testing.  Results:   During follow-up from 1992 through 2007, 8,092 incident prostate cancer cases were identified. Current regular use of acetaminophen (30 or more pills per month) for 5 or more years was associated with lower risk of overall prostate cancer (RR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44-0.87) and aggressive prostate cancer (RR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.27-0.88). Current regular use of less than 5 years duration was not associated with prostate cancer risk.  Conclusion:   These results suggest that long-term regular acetaminophen use may be associated with lower prostate cancer risk.  Impact:   If the association between acetaminophen use and lower risk of prostate cancer is confirmed, it could provide clues about biological mechanisms that are important in prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Eric J Jacobs', 'Christina C Newton', 'Victoria L Stevens', 'Susan M Gapstur']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['A large cohort study of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prostate cancer incidence.', 'Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and breast cancer incidence in a large U.S. cohort.', 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of prostate cancer in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.', 'Prostate-specific antigen levels in relation to consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen: results from the 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.', 'Effects of long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution on respiratory and cardiovascular mortality in the Netherlands: the NLCS-AIR study.', 'Association between WHO First-Step Analgesic Use and Risk of Breast Cancer in Women of Working Age.', 'Use of acetaminophen in relation to the occurrence of cancer: a review of epidemiologic studies.', 'Approaches to the Development of Human Health Toxicity Values for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients in the Environment.', 'The modern pharmacology of paracetamol: therapeutic actions, mechanism of action, metabolism, toxicity and recent pharmacological findings.', 'Synergistic interaction of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis on prostate cancer risk.']"""

Purpose:   To investigate the efficacy of DTI at 3.0 T in diagnosing prostate cancer in the peripheral zone and to determine the normative ADC and FA values of the normal prostate.  Material and methods:   T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and DTI of the prostate was performed in 33 cases with diagnosis confirmed by biopsy at 3.0 T MR. ADC and FA values of cancerous and non-cancerous sextants were compared. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the ability of ADC, FA and the two values combined in diagnosing prostate cancer in the peripheral zone. DTI data of 20 healthy young volunteers were also acquired. ADC and FA values of the normal central gland and the peripheral zone were compared.  Results:   ADC value (1.10 ± 0.09 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was lower while FA value (0.37 ± 0.05) was higher in normal central gland, compared with that in normal peripheral zone (1.63 ± 0.15 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, 0.21 ± 0.07, respectively) (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, respectively). Sixteen of 33 cases were confirmed to be malignant while 17 of 33 cases were benign. All the 198 sextants were confirmed by biopsy, including 136 non-cancerous sextants and 62 cancerous sextants. There were significant differences between cancerous sextants (1.02 ± 0.16 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, 0.38 ± 0.09) and non-cancerous sextants (1.22 ± 0.14 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, 0.31 ± 0.06) for both ADC and FA values (P <0.0001, P <0.0001, respectively).

We assessed whether EDA reduces long-term mortality after colorectal cancer surgery.  Methods:   All patients having colorectal cancer surgery between January 2004 and January 2008 at Linköping and Örebro were included. Exclusion criteria were: emergency operations, laparoscopic-assisted colorectal resection, and stage 4 cancer. Statistical information was obtained from the Swedish National Register for Deaths. Patients were analysed in two groups: EDA group or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA group) as the primary method of analgesia.  Results:   A total of 655 patients could be included.

Multivariate regression analysis identified the following statistically significant factors for death after colon cancer (P<0.05): age (>72 yr) and cancer stage 3 (compared with stage 1). A similar model for rectal cancer found that age (>72 yr) and the use of PCA rather than EDA and cancer stages 2 and 3 (compared with stage 1) were associated with a higher risk for death.

The ability of proteasome inhibitors, such as Velcade, to promote extrinsic apoptotic effects illustrates the importance of the ubiquitin proteasome system in the regulation of death receptor signaling. Here, we set out to define the UPS machinery, particularly the E3 ubiquitin ligases, that repress apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway. A cell-based genome-wide E3 ligase siRNA screen was established to monitor caspase-8 activity following the addition of TRAIL.  Results:   Data from the high-throughput screen revealed that targeting the RING-finger containing E3 ligase Siah2 as well as the signaling platform molecule POSH (SH3RF1) conferred robust caspase-8 activation in response to TRAIL stimulus. Silencing Siah2 or POSH in prostate cancer cells led to increased caspase activity and apoptosis in response to both TRAIL and Fas ligand. The E3 activity of Siah2 was responsible for mediating apoptosis resistance; while POSH protein levels were critical for maintaining viability. Further characterization of Siah2 revealed it to function downstream of early death receptor events in the apoptotic pathway. The observed apoptosis resistance provides one biological explanation for the induction of Siah2 and POSH reported in lung and prostate cancer, respectively. Expanding on an initial yeast-two-hybrid screen we have confirmed a physical interaction between E3 ligases Siah2 and POSH. Utilizing a yeast-two-hybrid mapping approach we have defined the spacer region of POSH, more specifically the RPxAxVxP motif encompassing amino acids 601-607, to be the site of Siah2 binding.  Conclusions:   The data presented here define POSH and Siah2 as important mediators of death receptor mediated apoptosis and suggest targeting the interaction of these two E3 ligases is a promising novel cancer therapeutic strategy.""","""['Perry A Christian', 'Michael V Fiandalo', 'Steven R Schwarze']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['The WWP1 ubiquitin E3 ligase increases TRAIL resistance in breast cancer.', 'A20 ubiquitin ligase-mediated polyubiquitination of RIP1 inhibits caspase-8 cleavage and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in glioblastoma.', 'E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases as modulators of TRAIL-mediated extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway.', 'Phylogenetic analysis of the SINA/SIAH ubiquitin E3 ligase family in Metazoa.', 'The inducible E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH1 and SIAH2 perform critical roles in breast and prostate cancers.', 'The roles of E3 ubiquitin ligases in cancer progression and targeted therapy.', 'Protein degradation: expanding the toolbox to restrain cancer drug resistance.', 'The emerging roles of E3 ubiquitin ligases in ovarian cancer chemoresistance.', 'SEVEN IN ABSENTIA Ubiquitin Ligases Positively Regulate Defense Against Verticillium dahliae in Gossypium hirsutum.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

However, the direct role of NPRA signaling in prostate cancer remains unclear.  Results:   NPRA expression was examined by western blotting, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. NPRA was downregulated by transfection of siRNA, shRNA and NPRA inhibitor (iNPRA). Antitumor efficacy of iNPRA was tested in mice using a TRAMP-C1 xenograft. Here, we demonstrated that NPRA is abundantly expressed on tumorigenic mouse and human prostate cells, but not in nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells. NPRA expression showed positive correlation with clinical staging in a human PCa tissue microarray. Down-regulation of NPRA by siNPRA or iNPRA induced apoptosis in PCa cells. The mechanism of iNPRA-induced anti-PCa effects was linked to NPRA-induced expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory cytokine over-expressed in PCa and significantly reduced by siNPRA. Prostate tumor cells implanted in mice deficient in atrial natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA-KO) failed to grow, and treatment of TRAMP-C1 xenografts with iNPRA reduced tumor burden and MIF expression. Using the TRAMP spontaneous PCa model, we found that NPRA expression correlated with MIF expression during PCa progression.  Conclusions:   Collectively, these results suggest that NPRA promotes PCa development in part by regulating MIF. Our findings also suggest that NPRA is a potential prognostic marker and a target for PCa therapy.""","""['Xiaoqin Wang', 'Payal Raulji', 'Shyam S Mohapatra', 'Ronil Patel', 'Gary Hellermann', 'Xiaoyuan Kong', 'Pedro L Vera', 'Katherine L Meyer-Siegler', 'Domenico Coppola', 'Subhra Mohapatra']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['ANP-NPRA signaling pathway--a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of malignancy.', 'Natriuretic peptide receptor A inhibition suppresses gastric cancer development through reactive oxygen species-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest and cell death.', 'Natriuretic peptide receptor a as a novel anticancer target.', 'Natriuretic peptide receptor A signaling regulates stem cell recruitment and angiogenesis: a model to study linkage between inflammation and tumorigenesis.', 'Intracellular trafficking and metabolic turnover of ligand-bound guanylyl cyclase/atrial natriuretic peptide receptor-A into subcellular compartments.', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.', 'Natriuretic peptide system expression in murine and human submandibular salivary glands: a study of the spatial localisation of ANB, BNP, CNP and their receptors.', 'Is Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and Natriuretic Peptide Receptor-A (NPR-A) Expression in Human Placenta and Decidua Normal?', 'Natriuretic Peptides: The Case of Prostate Cancer.', 'Breakthroughs in modern cancer therapy and elusive cardiotoxicity: Critical research-practice gaps, challenges, and insights.']"""

Using RNAi, we show that RhoA-depleted cells became elongated and extended multiple Rac1-driven narrow protrusions in 2D and 3D environments, leading to increased invasion. These phenotypes were caused by combined but distinct effects of the Rho-regulated kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2. Depletion of ROCK2 induced multiple delocalized protrusions and reduced migratory polarity, whereas ROCK1 depletion selectively led to cell elongation and defective tail retraction. In contrast, RhoC depletion increased cell spreading and induced Rac1 activation around the periphery in broad lamellipodia, thereby inhibiting directed migration and invasion. These effects of RhoC depletion are mediated by the formin FMNL3, which we identify as a new target of RhoC but not RhoA.

Ten SNPs were significantly related to prostate cancer risk at a genome-wide significance level of P < 5 × 10(-8) with the most significant association with rs4430796 (P = 1.62 × 10(-24)). However, risk within this first locus was not entirely explained by rs4430796.

As expected, rs11649743 was related to prostate cancer risk (P = 3.54 × 10(-8)); however, the association within this second locus was stronger for rs4794758 (P = 4.95 × 10(-10)), which explained all of the risk observed with rs11649743 when both SNPs were included in the same model (P = 0.32 for rs11649743; P = 0.002 for rs4794758). Sequential conditional analyses indicated that five SNPs (rs4430796, rs7405696, rs4794758, rs1016990 and rs3094509) together comprise the best model for risk in this region.

Methods:   Tissue specimens from 73 patients with prostate carcinoma and corresponding paracancerous tissues were obtained by prostate cancer biopsy or radical prostatectomy. The expression of RhoC/ROCK-1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were performed to dertect the expression of RhoC/ROCK-1 protein.

The B isoform of TIG1 (TIG1B) inhibits growth and invasion of cancer cells. Expression of TIG1B is frequently downregulated in various cancer tissues; however, the expression and activities of the TIG1A isoform are yet to be reported. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of the TIG1A and TIG1B isoforms on cell growth and gene expression profiles using colon cancer cells.  Methods:   TIG1A and TIG1B stable clones derived from HCT116 and SW620 colon cancer cells were established using the GeneSwitch system; TIG1 isoform expression was induced by mifepristone treatment. Cell growth was assessed using the WST-1 cell proliferation and colony formation assays. RNA interference was used to examine the TIG1 mediating changes in cell growth. Gene expression profiles were determined using microarray and validated using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analyses.  Results:   Both TIG1 isoforms were expressed at high levels in normal prostate and colon tissues and were downregulated in colon cancer cell lines. Both TIG1 isoforms significantly inhibited the growth of transiently transfected HCT116 cells and stably expressing TIG1A and TIG1B HCT116 and SW620 cells. Expression of 129 and 55 genes was altered upon induction of TIG1A and TIG1B expression, respectively, in stably expressing HCT116 cells. Of the genes analysed, 23 and 6 genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in both TIG1A and TIG1B expressing cells. Upregulation of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) was confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses in both TIG1 stable cell lines. Silencing of TIG1A or GRK5 expression significantly decreased TIG1A-mediated cell growth suppression.  Conclusions:   Expression of both TIG1 isoforms was observed in normal prostate and colon tissues and was downregulated in colon cancer cell lines. Both TIG1 isoforms suppressed cell growth and stimulated GRK5 expression in HCT116 and SW620 cells. Knockdown of GRK5 expression alleviated TIG1A-induced growth suppression of HCT116 cells, suggesting that GRK5 mediates cell growth suppression by TIG1A. Thus, TIG1 may participate in the downregulation of G-protein coupled signaling by upregulating GRK5 expression.""","""['Chang-Chieh Wu', 'Fu-Ming Tsai', 'Rong-Yaun Shyu', 'Ya-Ming Tsai', 'Chun-Hua Wang', 'Shun-Yuan Jiang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Tazarotene-induced gene 1 inhibits prostaglandin E2-stimulated HCT116 colon cancer cell growth.', 'Tazarotene-Induced Gene 1 Enhanced Cervical Cell Autophagy through Transmembrane Protein 192.', 'Tazarotene-induced gene 1 interacts with Polo-like kinase 2 and inhibits cell proliferation in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells.', 'Tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) expression in prostate carcinomas and its relationship to tumorigenicity.', 'Tazarotene-Induced Gene 1 (TIG1) Interacts with Serine Protease Inhibitor Kazal-Type 2 (SPINK2) to Inhibit Cellular Invasion of Testicular Carcinoma Cells.', 'G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 4 Is a Novel Prognostic Factor in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', ""GRK5 Deficiency Causes Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Differential Regulation of GPCRs-Are GRK Expression Levels the Key?', 'The GRKs Reactome: Role in Cell Biology and Pathology.', 'Targeting GRK5 for Treating Chronic Degenerative Diseases.']"""

Moreover, current dietary recommendations for vitamin D do not take into account a person's body mass index (BMI). We investigated the relationship between serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] and BMI in cancer.  Methods:   A consecutive case series of 738 cancer patients. Serum 25(OH)D was measured at presentation to the hospital. The cohort was divided into 4 BMI groups (underweight: <18.5, normal weight: 18.5-24.9, overweight: 25-29.9, and obese: >30.0 kg/m²). Mean 25(OH)D was compared across the 4 BMI groups using ANOVA. Linear regression was used to quantify the relationship between BMI and 25(OH)D.  Results:   303 were males and 435 females. Mean age at diagnosis was 55.6 years. The mean BMI was 27.9 kg/m² and mean serum 25(OH)D was 21.9 ng/ml. Most common cancers were lung (134), breast (131), colorectal (97), pancreas (86) and prostate (45). Obese patients had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels (17.9 ng/ml) as compared to normal weight (24.6 ng/ml) and overweight (22.8 ng/ml) patients; p < 0.001.

The most predominant product of prostatic NE cells is Chromogranin A, but they also produce serotonin, CgB, secretogranin or CgC, thyroid-stimulating hormone-like peptide, calcitonin, katacalcin, PTHrP and a-human chorionic gonadotropin-like peptide. NE cells in normal and neoplastic prostates are devoid of androgen receptors, but they express epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and c-erbB-2. For these reason NE cells are androgen-insensitive.

While most oligos consist of a single mRNA binding site targeting a single gene product or those with sequence homology, our lab has developed bispecific oligos directed toward two unrelated proteins. In LNCaP cells, we initially identified bispecifics that increased the expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) while not affecting secreted prostate-specific antigen (PSA). We postulated that surface antigen expression is increased by bispecifics able to form double-stranded regions, acting as interferon (IFN-γ) inducers. In other systems, when induced, IFN-γ promotes cell surface antigen expression, including HLA and receptors for tumor necrosis factor. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of oligo treatment on both IFN-γ induction and the expression of another secreted product of differentiated prostate cells, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). This study initially evaluated the inhibition of in vitro propagating LNCaP cells employing mono- and bispecific oligos directed against bcl-2 (the second bispecific binding site was against the epidermal growth factor receptor). Employing RT-PCR, the expression of non-targeted proteins encoded by mRNA for PSMA, PSA, PAP, and IFN-γ was subsequently valuated. When LNCaP prostate tumor cells were incubated with oligos and compared to lipofectin-containing controls significant growth inhibition resulted. Employing RT-PCR, the levels of mRNA encoding PSMA were unexpectedly found to be elevated following treatment with the bispecific oligos but not with a monospecific directed solely against bcl-2. No differences were detected in mRNA levels encoding PSA following treatment with either oligo type. IFN-γ was significantly induced only by bispecific oligos, and PAP expression was similar to PSA. These data support the hypothesis that double strand-forming bispecific oligos induce IFN-γ that enhances cell surface PSMA expression.

Here, we sought to unravel the molecular mechanisms of the antimetastatic activity of nCLU. We found that nCLU: i) decreases LIMK1 expression, thus increasing the levels of the active (unphosphorylated) form of cofilin, the well known actin depolymerizing factor; ii) binds to vimentin, sequestering the protein from its adhesion sites at the cell periphery, thus interfering with its role in cell motility and adhesion; iii) affects the intracellular distribution of E-cadherin (the major component of epithelial adherens junctions) which appears to be diffusely distributed in the cells. Through these mechanisms nCLU reduces the migratory/invasive behavior of PC3 cells; this effect is further demonstrated by a decreased secretion of active MMP-2 from the cells. Thus, in addition to its proapoptotic function, nCLU also exerts a strong anti-migratory/anti-invasive activity in prostate cancer cells, by interfering with the cytoskeletal components and by decreasing MMP-2 activity.""","""['Roberta M Moretti', 'Stefania Mai', 'Marina Montagnani Marelli', 'Federica Rizzi', 'Saverio Bettuzzi', 'Patrizia Limonta']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Clusterin isoforms differentially affect growth and motility of prostate cells: possible implications in prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Nuclear clusterin accumulation during heat shock response: implications for cell survival and thermo-tolerance induction in immortalized and prostate cancer cells.', 'Expression of Frzb/secreted Frizzled-related protein 3, a secreted Wnt antagonist, in human androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells suppresses tumor growth and cellular invasiveness.', 'Chapter 4: Regulation of Clusterin activity by calcium.', 'Chapter 5: Nuclear CLU (nCLU) and the fate of the cell.', 'The role and function of CLU in cancer biology and therapy.', 'Proteotranscriptomic Measurements of E6-Associated Protein (E6AP) Targets in DU145 Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'miRNA-378 reverses chemoresistance to cisplatin in lung adenocarcinoma cells by targeting secreted clusterin.', 'Calcium homeostasis and ER stress in control of autophagy in cancer cells.', 'ZNF469 frequently mutated in the brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is a single exon gene possibly regulating the expression of several extracellular matrix components.']"""

It is unclear if differences in the diagnostic testing, disease severity, geography, or other factors account for the discordant results. We report here the prevalence of XMRV in a population with well-defined prostate cancers and RNase L polymorphism. We used broadly reactive PCR and Western blot (WB) assays to detect infection with XMRV and related murine leukemia viruses (MLV).  Methodology/principal findings:   We studied specimens from 162 US patients diagnosed with prostate cancer with a intermediate to advanced stage (Gleason Scores of 5-10; moderate (46%) poorly differentiated tumors (54%)). Prostate tissue DNA was tested by PCR assays that detect XMRV and MLV variants. To exclude contamination with mouse DNA, we also designed and used a mouse-specific DNA PCR test. Detailed phylogenetic analysis was used to infer evolutionary relationships. RNase L typing showed that 9.3% were homozygous (QQ) for the R462Q RNase L mutation, while 45.6% and 45.1% were homozygous or heterozygous, respectively. Serologic testing was performed by a WB test. Three of 162 (1.9%) prostate tissue DNA were PCR-positive for XMRV and had undetectable mouse DNA. None was homozygous for the QQ mutation. Plasma from all three persons was negative for viral RNA by RT-PCR. All 162 patients were WB negative. Phylogenetic analysis inferred a distinct XMRV.

Mitostatin negatively affects cell growth, induces cell death and regulates the expression and activation levels of Hsp27. In this study, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of Mitostatin in PC3, DU145, and LNCaP prostate cancer cells not only induced a significant reduction in cell growth, but also inhibited migration and invasion. Moreover, Mitostatin inhibited colony formation in soft-agar of PC3 and LNCaP cells as well as tumorigenicity of LNCaP cells in nude mice. Conversely, targeting endogenous Mitostatin by siRNA and anti-sense strategies in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells enhanced the malignant phenotype in both cell lines. In agreement of these anti-oncogenic roles, we discovered that Mitostatin was absent in ∼35% (n = 124) of prostate tumor samples and its overall reduction was associated with advanced cancer stages.

Consequently, FoxA1 downregulation, an unfavourable prognostic sign in certain advanced prostate tumours, triggers dramatic reprogramming of the hormonal response by causing a massive switch in AR binding to a distinct cohort of pre-established enhancers. These enhancers are functional, as evidenced by the production of enhancer-templated non-coding RNA (eRNA) based on global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) analysis, with a unique class apparently requiring no nucleosome remodelling to induce specific enhancer-promoter looping and gene activation.

Here we identify the ubiquitin ligase COP1 (also known as RFWD2) as a tumour suppressor that negatively regulates ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5. ETV1, which is mutated in prostate cancer more often, was degraded after being ubiquitinated by COP1. Truncated ETV1 encoded by prostate cancer translocation TMPRSS2:ETV1 lacks the critical COP1 binding motifs and was 50-fold more stable than wild-type ETV1. Almost all patient translocations render ETV1 insensitive to COP1, implying that this confers a selective advantage to prostate epithelial cells. Indeed, COP1 deficiency in mouse prostate elevated ETV1 and produced increased cell proliferation, hyperplasia, and early prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. Combined loss of COP1 and PTEN enhanced the invasiveness of mouse prostate adenocarcinomas. Finally, rare human prostate cancer samples showed hemizygous loss of the COP1 gene, loss of COP1 protein, and elevated ETV1 protein while lacking a translocation event.

It has recently been reported that the GNMT gene acts as a tumor-susceptible gene. However, little is known about the specific function of GNMT in carcinogenesis and malignant progression. To better our understanding of the function of GNMT in prostate cancer, we used siRNAs to examine the effects of GNMT knockdown on cell proliferation and the cell cycle. In addition, the relation between immunohistochemical GNMT expression and clinicopathologic parameters was investigated in 148 prostate cancer tissues. Here, we show that siRNA-mediated GNMT knockdown results in an inhibition of proliferation, and induces G1 arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, high cytoplasmic GNMT expression was also correlated with a higher Gleason score (P<0.001) and higher pT stage (P=0.027). The patients with high GNMT cytoplasmic expression showed significantly lower disease-free survival rates than patients with low expression (P<0.001). High GNMT cytoplasmic expression had a significant impact on patient disease-free survival in multivariate analysis (P=0.005). This is the first investigation to reveal the novel finding that GNMT may have an important role in promoting prostate cancer cell growth via the regulation of apoptosis and contribute to the progression of prostate cancer. The modulation of GNMT expression or function may be a strategy for developing novel therapeutics for prostate cancer.

Various stromal proliferations of STUMPs have been described; however, epithelial proliferations occurring within the STUMP have not been systematically described to date. We reviewed 89 cases of STUMP from our consultation service from 1990 to 2010. Nineteen cases without a glandular component were excluded. We next evaluated the glandular component of the remaining 70 cases of STUMP for glandular crowding and complexity, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), squamous metaplasia, urothelial metaplasia, basal cell hyperplasia, adenosis, and clear cell cribriform hyperplasia. In 58 cases (83%), the glandular component differed from glands on the same biopsy specimen uninvolved by STUMP. The most common abnormalities were glandular crowding in 35 of 70 (50%) and a very prominent basal cell layer in some glands in 32 of 70 (46%) cases. The next most frequent glandular variation from normal was prominent papillary infolding in 13 of 70 (19%) cases. Less-frequent epithelial changes within the STUMP were as follows: 10 of 70 (14%) showed cystically dilated glands; 7 of 10 (10%) had basal cell hyperplasia; 6 of 70 (9%) had urothelial metaplasia; 6 of 70 (9%) showed squamous metaplasia; 3 of 70 (4%) had cribriform hyperplasia; 3 of 70 (4%) had adenosis; and 1 case each showed high-grade PIN, low-grade PIN, and partial atrophy. The glandular component of STUMP was histologically normal in 12 (17%) cases. There was a tendency toward urothelial and squamous metaplasia in STUMPs with a phyllodes pattern, and a prominent basal cell layer in STUMPs with degenerative and cellular stroma. This is the first study to systematically describe the epithelial proliferations occurring in STUMP. This study suggests that, within STUMPs, there is epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk, as has been described in benign prostate and in prostatic carcinogenesis.

Following exposure of DU-145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines to the combination of 10 μmol/L ABT-888 and 6 Gy, we observed similar persistence between both cell lines of DNA damage foci and in vitro radiosensitization. We have previously observed that persistent DNA damage foci formed after ABT-888 plus IR efficiently promote accelerated cell senescence, but only PC-3 cells displayed the expected senescent response of G(2)-M arrest, induction of p21 and β-galactosidase expression, and accumulation as large flat cells. In turn, combining ABT-888 with 6 Gy resulted in delayed tumor regrowth compared with either agent alone only in PC-3 xenograft tumors, whereas DU-145 tumors continued to grow. By 7 days after treatment with ABT-888 plus IR, PC-3 tumors contained abundant senescent cells displaying persistent DNA damage foci, but no evidence of senescence was noted in the DU-145 tumors.

Experimental design:   Microarray-based DNA methylation and gene expression profiling was carried out using a panel of PCa cell lines and a control normal prostate cell line. The methylation status of candidate genes in prostate cell lines was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR, bisulfite sequencing analysis, and treatment with a demethylation agent.

Further validation using microarray gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was carried out.  Results:   Epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1) was identified as a lead candidate methylation marker for PCa. The gene expression level of EFEMP1 was significantly higher in tissue samples from patients with BPH than in those with PCa (P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of EFEMP1 methylation status in discriminating between PCa and BPH reached 95.3% (101 of 106) and 86.6% (84 of 97), respectively. From the GEO data set, we confirmed that the expression level of EFEMP1 was significantly different between PCa and BPH.

By deep sequencing the transcriptome of 20 human prostate cancer and 10 matched benign prostate tissues, we obtained 1.3 billion sequence reads, which led to the identification of 2,369 chimeric RNA candidates. Chimeric RNAs occurred in significantly higher frequency in cancer than in matched benign samples. Experimental investigation of a selected 46 set led to the confirmation of 32 chimeric RNAs, of which 27 were highly recurrent and previously undescribed in prostate cancer. Importantly, a subset of these chimeras was present in prostate cancer cell lines, but not detectable in primary human prostate epithelium cells, implying their associations with cancer. These chimeras contain discernable 5' and 3' splice sites at the RNA junction, indicating that their formation is mediated by splicing. Their presence is also largely independent of the expression of parental genes, suggesting that other factors are involved in their production and regulation. One chimera, TMEM79-SMG5, is highly differentially expressed in human cancer samples and therefore a potential biomarker. The prevalence of chimeric RNAs may allow the limited number of human genes to encode a substantially larger number of RNAs and proteins, forming an additional layer of cellular complexity.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the effects of statins (and duration of use) was performed after adjusting for age, body mass index, African-American race, number of cores taken and prostate volume.  Results:   We analyzed data from 4,204 patients, and we identified 3,182 (75.7%) not on statins and 1,022 on statins. Men diagnosed with prostate cancer on statins compared to those not taking statins were less likely to have digital rectal examination positivity (5.3% vs 8.9%, OR 0.7, p <0.01), Gleason score 7 or greater prostate cancer (61.4% vs 72.4%, OR 0.78, p = 0.02) and high volume prostate cancer (27.2 vs 31.4, p <0.01). Moreover statin users had lower prostate specific antigen compared to nonstatin users (5.13 vs 5.98, p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis adjusted risk ratios for prostate cancer diagnosis, high grade prostate cancer (Gleason score 7 or greater) and 3 or more cores positive in statin users were 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-0.98), 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.85) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.75-0.97) and only high grade prostate cancer persisted with length of use.  Conclusions:   Statin use was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer, less frequent high grade prostate cancer and lower volume of prostate cancer, suggesting that statin use has a protective effect against prostate cancer.""","""['Nelly Tan', 'Eric A Klein', 'Jianbo Li', 'Ayman S Moussa', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Association between statins and prostate tumor inflammatory infiltrate in men undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Improved biochemical outcomes with statin use in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy.', 'Statins and prostate cancer risk: a case-control study.', 'Review of recent evidence in support of a role for statins in the prevention of prostate cancer.', 'Association between statin usage and prostate cancer prevention: a refined meta-analysis based on literature from the years 2005-2010.', 'Assessing the role of lipid-lowering therapy on multi-cancer prevention: A mendelian randomization study.', 'Drug Repurposing: A New Hope in Drug Discovery for Prostate Cancer.', 'Association of Statin Use with the Risk of Incident Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.', 'Overcoming Drug Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer by Drug Repurposing.', 'Inhibition of Scavenger Receptor Class B Type 1 (SR-B1) Expression and Activity as a Potential Novel Target to Disrupt Cholesterol Availability in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

We estimated the risk of prostate cancer specific mortality following radical prostatectomy or brachytherapy in men with low or intermediate risk prostate cancer using prospectively collected data.  Materials and methods:   The study cohort comprised 5,760 men with low risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, clinical category T1c or 2a and Gleason score 6 or less), and 3,079 with intermediate risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml, clinical category T2b or T2c, or Gleason score 7). Competing risks multivariable regression was performed to assess the risk of prostate cancer specific mortality after radical prostatectomy or brachytherapy, adjusting for age, year of treatment, cardiovascular comorbidity and known prostate cancer prognostic factors.  Results:   After a median followup of 4.2 years (IQR 2.0-7.4) for low risk and 4.8 years (IQR 2.2-8.1) for intermediate risk men, there was no significant difference in the risk of prostate cancer specific mortality among low risk (adjusted hazard ratio 1.62, 95% CI 0.59-4.45, p = 0.35) or intermediate risk men (AHR 2.30, 95% CI 0.95-5.58, p = 0.07) treated with brachytherapy compared with radical prostatectomy.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of the natural, angio-inhibitory and anti-tumoral Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF) on the expression of IL8 cytokine by prostate cancer cells. Using a cytokine antibody array and ELISA, in addition to IL8 quantitative RT PCR, we showed that PEDF inhibits the production of IL8 in human hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells, and delays the growth of these cells in vitro. IL8 reduction was mimicked in cancer cells treated with PPARγ agonist and NFκB-specific inhibitors. Accordingly, PPARγ expression increased in response to PEDF, whereas RelA/p65 expression and nuclear localization, and NFκB transcriptional activity decreased. NFκB deactivation was reversed by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 and PPARγ (Leu(468)/Glu(471)) dominant negative suggesting a PPARγ-dependent process. We also investigated PEDF Receptor/PLA2 as key player in this pathway by small interference RNA. PEDFR knock down in prostate cancer cells reversed PEDF-induced PPARγ up-regulation, and NFκB and IL8 inhibition compared to non-targeting control siRNA. We conclude that by binding to PEDFR, PEDF up-regulates PPARγ, leading subsequently to suppressed NFκB-mediated transcriptional activation, reduced production of IL8 and limited proliferation of prostate cancer cells. These results reinforce PEDF's therapeutic potential and imply that blocking IL8 could represent a novel alternative for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Jennifer Hirsch', 'Christina Lisa Johnson', 'Thomas Nelius', 'Ronald Kennedy', 'Werner de Riese', 'Stéphanie Filleur']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cytokine""","""['Proapoptotic PEDF functional peptides inhibit prostate tumor growth--a mechanistic study.', 'Pigment epithelium-derived factor induces interleukin-10 expression in human macrophages by induction of PPAR gamma.', 'PEDF inhibits AGE-induced podocyte apoptosis via PPAR-gamma activation.', 'Cancer cell apoptotic pathways mediated by PEDF: prospects for therapy.', 'Characterization of PEDF: a multi-functional serpin family protein.', 'Lycopene inhibits endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition of choroidal vascular endothelial cells in laser-induced mouse choroidal neovascularization.', 'Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor and Sex Hormone-Responsive Cancers.', 'The Wnt non-canonical signaling modulates cabazitaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.', 'Pigment Epithelium-derived Factor secreted by corneal epithelial cells regulates dendritic cell maturation in dry eye disease.', 'Pigment epithelium‑derived factor facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome activation through downregulating cytidine monophosphate kinase 2: A potential treatment strategy for missed abortion.']"""

We assessed a series of 816 prostate needle biopsy cores in 68 consecutive patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. Biopsy specimens were reviewed using conventional examination. Then, slides were converted to whole slide imaging (Olympus BX51). Tumor was measured, and Gleason score was assigned using the OlyVia software. Optically evaluated pathological features were compared with digital findings to determine whether one of these two methods for the assignment of a preoperative Gleason score is appropriate for predicting the definitive Gleason score of radical prostatectomy. When comparing optical and digital measurements, maximum tumor length in biopsy cores and percent prostate needle biopsy with cancer showed no significant difference. The mean variation in the measurement of tumor length was 2.65mm per biopsy. Among 240 biopsy cores involved with cancer, the concordance rate for Gleason score assignment was 75.8% (κ=0.49, good agreement). When considering the higher Gleason score assignment as the score for the entire case (ISUP 2005), the concordance rate was 69.1% (κ=0.46, good agreement). When comparing the biopsy scores with the definitive score of radical prostatectomy, the concordance rate was significantly increased from 54.4% for conventional examination (κ=0.23, marginal agreement) to 66.2% for virtual slide examination (κ=0.42, good agreement).

Methods and materials:   Fifteen prostate patient plans were studied retrospectively. For each case, planning target volume, rectum, and bladder were considered. Three optimization schemes were used: dose-volume histogram (DVH) based, generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) based, and mixed DVH/gEUD based. For each scheme, a single or dual 6-MV, 356° VMAT arc was used. The plans were optimized with Pinnacle(3) (v. 9.0 beta) treatment planning system. For each patient, the optimized dose distributions were normalized to deliver the same prescription dose. The quality of the plans was evaluated by dose indices (DIs) and gEUDs for rectum and bladder. The tallied DIs were D(1%), D(15%), D(25%), and D(40%), and the tallied gEUDs were for a values of 1 and 6. Statistical tests were used to quantify the magnitude and the significance of the observed differences. Monitor units and treatment times for each optimization scheme were also assessed.  Results:   All optimization schemes generated clinically acceptable plans. The statistical tests indicated that biological optimization yielded increased organs-at-risk sparing, ranging from ~1% to more than ~27% depending on the tallied DI, gEUD, and anatomical structure. The increased sparing was at the expense of longer treatment times and increased number of monitor units.

Neuroendocrine differentiation and upregulation of NFκB transcriptional activity are two mechanisms that have been independently linked to this process.  Methods:   We investigated these two pathways together using in vitro models of androgen-dependent (AD) and androgen-independent (AI) PC. We measured cellular levels, activity and surface expression of Neutral Endopeptidase (NEP), levels of secreted Endothelin-1 (ET-1), levels, sub-cellular localisation and DNA binding ability of NFκB, and proteasomal activity in human native PC cell lines (LnCaP and PC-3) modelling AD and AI states.  Results:   At baseline, AD cells were found to have high NEP expression and activity and low secreted ET-1. In contrast, they exhibited a low-level activation of the NFκB pathway associated with comparatively low 20S proteasome activity. The AI cells showed the exact mirror image, namely increased proteasomal activity resulting in a canonical pathway-mediated NFκB activation, and minimal NEP activity with increased levels of secreted ET-1.  Conclusions:   Our results seem to support evidence for divergent patterns of expression of the NFκB/proteasome pathway with relation to components of the NEP/neuropeptide axis in PC cells of different level of androgen dependence.

The purpose of the study is to report multi-institutional experiences while performing salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (sRARP).  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively identified 15 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer after definitive radiotherapy who underwent sRARP in three academic institutions over a 20-month period. Continence was defined as the use of 0 pads after surgery. Potency was defined as the ability to achieve erections adequate enough for penetration with or without the use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Biochemical recurrence after sRARP was defined as a prostate-specific antigen value of >0.2 ng/mL.  Results:   Radiation treatment consisted of external-beam radiation therapy (XRT) in five cases, interstitial radioactive 125-iodine brachytherapy (BT) in five cases, proton beam therapy in two cases, and XRT followed by interstitial radioactive 125-iodine BT in three cases. The median operative time, the median estimated blood loss, and the median length of hospital stay were 140.5 min (interquartile range [IQR] 97.5-157 min), 75 mL (IQR 50-100 mL), and 1 day (IQR 1-2 d), respectively. There were no rectal injuries. Two (13.3%) patients had a positive surgical margin. A total of three (20%) patients had postoperative complications. One patient had a deep vein thrombosis (Clavien grade II), one had wound infection (Clavien grade II), and one patient had an anastomotic leak (Clavien gradeId). An anastomotic stricture (Clavien grade IIIa) later developed in this same patient, which was managed by direct visual internal urethrotomy. Of the patients, 71.4% were continent. At a median follow-up of 4.6 months (IQR 3-9.75 mos), four (28.6%) patients presented with biochemical recurrence after sRARP.  Conclusions:   The challenge during sRALP is the presence of extensive fibrosis and loss of dissection planes secondary to radiation therapy. It is a technically challenging but feasible procedure.

The purpose of this paper is to identify and compare exercise barriers among cancer survivors, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally as they undergo home-based behavioral interventions.  Methods:   Data on a sample of 452 breast and prostate cancer survivors who completed the FRESH START trial were analyzed collectively, as well as separately by cancer type.  Results:   More total barriers (3.5 vs. 2.4; p < 0.01) were reported among breast cancer survivors compared with prostate cancer survivors. Commonly reported baseline exercise barriers among both groups were ""too busy"" (breast, 52% and prostate, 45%) and ""no willpower"" (breast, 51% and prostate, 44%). At baseline, breast cancer survivors who reported ""no willpower"" also reported 18.7 fewer minutes of physical activity compared with those not reporting this barrier (p < 0.01). Among prostate cancer survivors, this difference was 39.5 min (p < 0.01). Change in barriers was not associated with change in minutes of physical activity from baseline to post-intervention in either cancer survivor group.  Conclusions:   This is the largest study evaluating barriers and physical activity over time among cancer survivors. There are similarities and differences that both need to be taken into consideration when promoting physical activity among subgroups of survivors.

We hypothesize that the presence of a unique IL-13Rα2 decoy receptor prevents GBM apoptosis. This receptor has a high affinity for interleukin-13 (IL-13), binds the cytokine, and competitively inhibits the intracellular signaling cascade initiated by IL-13. In cells lacking the IL-13Rα2 decoy receptor, IL-13 initiates the production of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1), which has been implicated in cellular apoptosis. Our group and others have shown that induction of 15-LOX-1 correlates with tumor cell death in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. How 15-LOX-1 induces apoptosis remains unclear. Preliminary evidence in GBM cells implicates an apoptotic process mediated by PPARγ. 15-LOX-1 metabolites can modulate PPARγ and activation of PPARγ can suppress tumor growth. We hypothesize that in GBM, IL-13 can induce 15-LOX-1, which regulates cell apoptosis via signaling through PPARγ and that expression of IL-13Rα2 prevents apoptosis and contributes to tumor growth. Our in vitro and in vivo data support this. Knocking down IL-13Rα2 with short interfering RNA dramatically induces 15-LOX-1 expression, promotes apoptosis, and reduces GBM tumor growth in vivo. These findings identify a mechanism for eliminating the blockade of endogenous IL-13 signaling and for promotion of apoptosis, and characterize a role for 15-LOX-1 in GBM apoptosis. Identifying a mechanistic pathway that can be targeted for pharmacologic intervention will have applied implications to developing novel and effective treatments of GBM.""","""['Linda C Hsi', 'Suman Kundu', 'Juan Palomo', 'Bo Xu', 'Ryan Ficco', 'Michael A Vogelbaum', 'Martha K Cathcart']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Identification of a novel role of IL-13Rα2 in human Glioblastoma multiforme: interleukin-13 mediates signal transduction through AP-1 pathway.', 'Analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database identifies an inverse relationship between interleukin-13 receptor α1 and α2 gene expression and poor prognosis and drug resistance in subjects with glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 cooperates with EGFRvIII signaling to promote glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Recent Advances in IL-13Rα2-Directed Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'IL-13 receptor isoforms: breaking through the complexity.', 'CAR T Cell Therapy in Glioblastoma: Overcoming Challenges Related to Antigen Expression.', 'Ligand-based CAR-T cell: Different strategies to drive T cells in future new treatments.', 'Modulation of IL-4/IL-13 cytokine signaling in the context of allergic disease.', 'Ferroptosis Involvement in Glioblastoma Treatment.', 'Advances in magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents for glioblastoma-targeting theranostics.']"""

No significant differences existed between patients with or without staining in terms of age, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen, tumor stage, hormone therapy administration, % biopsy core involvement, mean Gleason score, or RT dose/modality. CgA staining concentration independently predicted for biochemical and clinical failure, distant metastases (DM), and cause-specific survival (CSS). For patients with <1% vs. >1% staining, 10-year DM rates were 13.4% vs. 55.3%, respectively (p = 0.001), and CSS was 91.7% vs. 58.9% (p < 0.001). As a continuous variable, increasing CgA staining concentration predicted for inferior rates of DM, CSS, biochemical control, and any clinical failure. No differences in outcomes were appreciated for patients with 0% vs. <1% NED.  Conclusions:   For Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer, >1% NED is associated with inferior clinical outcomes for patients treated with radiotherapy. This relates most directly to an increase in distant disease failure.""","""['Daniel J Krauss', 'Sylvia Hayek', 'Mitual Amin', 'Hong Ye', 'Larry L Kestin', 'Steven Zadora', 'Frank A Vicini', 'Matthew Cotant', 'Donald S Brabbins', 'Michel I Ghilezan', 'Gary S Gustafson', 'Alvaro A Martinez']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Chromogranin A staining as a prognostic variable in newly diagnosed Gleason score 7-10 prostate cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy.', 'Year of treatment as independent predictor of relapse-free survival in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy in the PSA era.', 'Percentage of positive biopsy cores: a better risk stratification model for prostate cancer?', 'Prognostic significance of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Neuroendocrine cells in prostate cancer correlate with poor outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation: a risk fellow in colorectal cancer.', 'Identification and Validation of Three Hub Genes Involved in Cell Proliferation and Prognosis of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'Grading Evolution and Contemporary Prognostic Biomarkers of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'The Correlation between PSCA Expression and Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The objective of current study was to examine the effects of a proinflammatory cytokine on the expression of glycosyltransferase and sulfotransferase genes involved in the synthesis of selectin ligands in a prostate cancer cell line. Androgen-independent human lymph node-derived metastatic prostate cancer cells (C-81 LNCaP), which express functional androgen receptor and mimic the castration-resistant advanced prostate cancer, were used. TNFα treatment of these cells increased their binding to P-, E- and L-selectins, anti-sLe(x) antibody, and anti-6-sulfo-sialyl Lewis x antibody by 12%, 240%, 43%, 248% and 21%, respectively. Also, the expression of C2GnT-1, B4GalT1, GlcNAc6ST3, and ST3Gal3 genes was significantly upregulated. Further treatment of TNFα-treated cells with either anti-sLe(x) antibody or E-selectin significantly suppressed their in vitro migration (81% and 52%, respectively) and invasion (45% and 56%, respectively). Our data indicate that TNFα treatment enhances the motility and invasion properties of LNCaP C-81 cells by increasing the formation of selectin ligands through stimulation of the expression of selective glycosyl- and sulfotransferase genes.

Patients and methods:   A consecutive series of 1411 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (open surgery or robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery) at Karolinska University Hospital between 2002 and 2006 were invited to complete a study-specific questionnaire. Urinary leakage was defined as use of two or more pads per day.  Results:   Questionnaires were received from 1288 (91%) patients with a median follow-up of 2.2 years. Age at surgery predicts in an exponential manner long-term urinary incontinence at follow-up with an estimated relative increase of 6% per year. Among the oldest patients, 19% had urinary incontinence compared with 6% in the youngest age group, translating to a prevalence ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-8.1). Low educational level, as compared with high, yielded an increased age-adjusted prevalence ratio of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.7-3.9). Patients who had undergone salvage radiation therapy had an increased prevalence of urinary incontinence (2.5; 95% CI, 1.6-3.8), as did those with respiratory disease (2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.4). Body mass index, prostate weight, presence of diabetes or previous transurethral resection did not appear to influence the prevalence of urinary incontinence.  Conclusions:   In this series, a patient's age at radical prostatectomy influenced, in an exponential manner, his risk of long-term urinary incontinence. Other predictors are low educational level, salvage radiation therapy and respiratory disease. Intervention studies are needed to understand if these data are relevant to the prevalence of urinary leakage if a radical prostatectomy is postponed in an active monitoring programme.""","""['Andreas E Nilsson', 'Martin C Schumacher', 'Eva Johansson', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Johan Stranne', 'Tommy Nyberg', 'N Peter Wiklund', 'Gunnar Steineck']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Long-term oncological and continence outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single-centre experience.', 'Urinary continence after radical prostatectomy: predictive factors of recovery after 1 year of surgery.', 'The impact of prostate size on urinary quality of life indexes following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of Obesity on Long-Term Urinary Incontinence after Radical Prostatectomy: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Patient- and Tumour-related Prognostic Factors for Urinary Incontinence After Radical Prostatectomy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Latest Evidence on Post-Prostatectomy Urinary Incontinence.', 'Predictors of urinary function recovery after laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Diabetes mellitus lowers the chance of short-term urinary continence recovery in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'A prospective study of patient reported urinary incontinence among American, Norwegian and Spanish men 1 year after prostatectomy.', 'Clinical Documentation to Predict Factors Associated with Urinary Incontinence Following Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this context, comparative effectiveness research emerged as an alternative strategy to understand better what works in health care. Put simply, comparative effectiveness research compares the efficacy of two or more diagnostic tests, treatments, or health care delivery methods without any explicit consideration of costs. To economists, the omission of costs from an assessment might seem nonsensical, but we argue that comparative effectiveness research still holds promise. First, it sidesteps one problem facing cost-effectiveness analysis--the widespread political resistance to the idea of using prices in health care. Second, there is little or no evidence on comparative effectiveness for a vast array of treatments: for example, we don't know whether proton-beam therapy, a very expensive treatment for prostate cancer (which requires building a cyclotron and a facility the size of a football field) offers any advantage over conventional approaches. Most drug studies compare new drugs to placebos, rather than ""head-to-head"" with other drugs on the market, leaving a vacuum as to which drug works best. Finally, the comparative effectiveness research can prove a useful first step even in the absence of cost information if it provides key estimates of treatment effects. After all, such effects are typically expensive to determine and require years or even decades of data. Costs are much easier to measure, and can be appended at a later date as financial Armageddon draws closer.""","""['Amitabh Chandra', 'Anupam B Jena', 'Jonathan S Skinner']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Econ Perspect""","""['Comparative effectiveness research as choice architecture: the behavioral law and economics solution to the health care cost crisis.', 'Can CER be an effective tool for change in the development and assessment of new drugs and technologies?', 'The role of costs in comparative effectiveness research.', 'The impact of comparative effectiveness research on interventional pain management: evolution from Medicare Modernization Act to Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.', 'Social welfare and the Affordable Care Act: is it ever optimal to set aside comparative cost?', 'Short- and long-term strategies for navigating research-ambivalent organizational cultures besetting embedded researchers.', 'Saving Money or Just Saving Lives?

The dominant mechanism of acute-onset, hypomagnesemia-induced hypocalcemia is currently unclear. An 83-year-old man who had undergone chemotherapy with carboplatin for prostate cancer suffered from acute diarrhea and finger paresthesia. Laboratory data confirmed hypocalcemia as well as hypomagnesemia. Urinary calcium levels were not measured. However, the urinary fractional excretion of Mg (FE(Mg)) was elevated. Despite elevated PTH levels, the renal tubular maximal reabsorption rate of phosphate to GFR (TmP/GFR) was elevated, and bone formation and resorption markers were suppressed. A magnesium loading test revealed a clear magnesium deficiency. After administration of magnesium, bone marker levels were increased, and TmP/GFR was reduced to normal levels, despite the persistent elevation of PTH. Serum calcium levels eventually increased to approximately the reference range.

Pomegranate juice (PJ), a natural product, was shown in a clinical trial to inhibit progression of this disease. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in the anti-progression effects of PJ on prostate cancer remain unclear. Here we show that, in addition to causing cell death of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells, PJ also increases cell adhesion and decreases cell migration of the cells that do not die. We hypothesized that PJ does so by stimulating the expression and/or activation of molecules that alter the cytoskeleton and the adhesion machinery of prostate cancer cells, resulting in enhanced cell adhesion and reduced cell migration. We took an integrative approach to these studies by using Affimetrix gene arrays to study gene expression, microRNA arrays to study the non-coding RNAs, molecules known to be disregulated in cancer cells, and Luminex Multiplex array assays to study the level of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. PJ up-regulates genes involved in cell adhesion such as E-cadherin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and down-regulates genes involved in cell migration such as hyaluranan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) and type I collagen. In addition, anti-invasive microRNAs such as miR-335, miR-205, miR-200, and miR-126, were up-regulated, whereas pro-invasive microRNA such as miR-21 and miR-373, were down-regulated. Moreover, PJ significantly reduced the level of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-1β and RANTES, thereby having the potential to decrease inflammation and its impact on cancer progression. PJ also inhibits the ability of the chemokine SDF1α to chemoattract these cancer cells. SDF1α and its receptor CXCR4 are important in metastasis of cancer cells to the bone. Discovery of the mechanisms by which this enhanced adhesion and reduced migration are accomplished can lead to sophisticated and effective prevention of metastasis in prostate and potentially other cancers.""","""['Lei Wang', 'Andre Alcon', 'Hongwei Yuan', 'Jeffrey Ho', 'Qi-Jing Li', 'M Martins-Green']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Integr Biol (Camb)""","""['Pomegranate juice and specific components inhibit cell and molecular processes critical for metastasis of breast cancer.', 'Vasoactive intestinal peptide behaves as a pro-metastatic factor in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Modulation of ezrin and E-cadherin expression by IL-1beta and TGF-beta1 in human trophoblasts.', 'Advanced prostate cancer: reinforcing the strings between inflammation and the metastatic behavior.', 'miR-126 in human cancers: clinical roles and current perspectives.', 'The Therapeutic Alliance between Pomegranate and Health Emphasizing on Anticancer Properties.', 'Pomegranate juice and punicalagin-mediated chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinogenesis via regulating miR-21 and NF-κB-p65 in a rat model.', 'miR-335 Restrains the Aggressive Phenotypes of Ovarian Cancer Cells by Inhibiting COL11A1.', 'Polyphenol-Enriched Blueberry Preparation Controls Breast Cancer Stem Cells by Targeting FOXO1 and miR-145.', 'Molecular targets of pomegranate (Punica granatum) in preventing cancer metastasis.']"""

Quantitative measurements by ELISA showed that the p-Ser/Thr TRIM59 correlated with tumorigenesis, whereas the p-Tyr-TRIM59 protein correlated with advanced cancer of the prostate (CaP). The function of TRIM59 was elucidated using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of the gene in human CaP cells, which caused S-phase cell-cycle arrest and cell growth retardation. A hit-and-run effect of TRIM59 shRNA knockdown was observed 24 hours posttransfection. Differential cDNA microarrray analysis was conducted, which showed that the initial and rapid knockdown occurred early in the Ras signaling pathway. To confirm the proto-oncogenic function of TRIM59 in the Ras signaling pathway, we generated a transgenic mouse model using a prostate tissue-specific gene (PSP94) to direct the upregulation of the TRIM59 gene. Restricted TRIM59 gene upregulation in the prostate revealed the full potential for inducing tumorigenesis, similar to the expression of SV40 Tag, and coincided with the upregulation of genes specific to the Ras signaling pathway and bridging genes for SV40 Tag-mediated oncogenesis.

Our recent studies found UBE2C to be a CRPC-specific androgen receptor (AR) target gene that is necessary for CRPC growth, providing a potential novel target for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we showed that the G(1)-S cell-cycle inhibitor-779 (CCI-779), an mTOR inhibitor, inhibited UBE2C mRNA and protein expression in AR-positive CRPC cell models abl and C4-2B. Treatment with CCI-779 significantly decreased abl cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo through inhibition of cell-cycle progression of both G(2)-M and G(1)-S phases. In addition, exposure of abl and C4-2B cells to CCI-779 also decreased UBE2C-dependent cell invasion. The molecular mechanisms for CCI-779 inhibition of UBE2C gene expression involved a decreased binding of AR coactivators SRC1, SRC3, p300, and MED1 to the UBE2C enhancers, leading to a reduction in RNA polymerase II loading to the UBE2C promoter, and attenuation of UBE2C mRNA stability.

In primary CaP tissue, we have previously found by miRNA sequencing that miR-375 and miR-200c were upregulated 9.1- and 4.5-fold, respectively. A computational analysis predicted the 3'-UTR of the SEC23A gene as a potential target for both miR-375 and miR-200c. Here, we show that the 3'-UTR of SEC23A mRNA is indeed a target for miR-375 and miR-200c and that both miRNAs downregulate Sec23A protein expression when ectopically expressed in human 293T cells. In primary samples of CaP, we found a direct correlation between reduction of SEC23A mRNA and overexpression of miR-375 but not of miR-200c. The reduced levels of Sec23A protein were inversely correlated to the increased amount of miR-375 in the LNCaP and DU145 CaP cell lines when compared with normal prostate fibroblasts. In primary CaP, we also detected decreased amounts of Sec23A protein when compared with corresponding normal prostate tissue. Ectopically overexpressed Sec23A in LNCaP and DU145 CaP cells significantly reduced the growth properties, indicating that Sec23A might play a role in the induction or growth of prostate carcinoma.

Results:   Stringent statistical analysis identifies a cohort of genes that lack one or both androgen response elements (AREs) or vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in their promoters, which are nevertheless differentially regulated by both steroids (either additively or synergistically). This suggests that mechanisms in addition to VDR- and AR-mediated transcription are responsible for the modulation of gene expression. Microarray analysis shows that fifteen miRNAs are also differentially regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 and T. Among these miR-22, miR-29ab, miR-134, miR-1207-5p and miR-371-5p are up regulated, while miR-17 and miR-20a, members of the miR-17/92 cluster are down regulated. A number of genes implicated in cell cycle progression, lipid synthesis and accumulation and calcium homeostasis are among the mRNA targets of these miRNAs. Thus, in addition to their well characterized effects on transcription, mediated by either or both cognate nuclear receptors, 1,25(OH)2D3 and T regulate the steady state mRNA levels by modulating miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation, generating attenuation feedback loops that result in global changes in mRNA and protein levels. Changes in genes involved in calcium homeostasis may have specific clinical importance since the second messenger Ca2+ is known to modulate various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell death and cell motility, which affects prostate cancer tumor progression and responsiveness to therapy.  Conclusions:   These data indicate that these two hormones combine to drive a differentiated phenotype, and reinforce the idea that the age dependent decline in both hormones results in the de-differentiation of prostate tumor cells, which results in increased proliferation, motility and invasion common to aggressive tumors. These studies also reinforce the potential importance of miRNAs in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes.""","""['Wei-Lin W Wang', 'Namita Chatterjee', 'Sridar V Chittur', 'JoEllen Welsh', 'Martin P Tenniswood']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Analysis of vitamin D-regulated gene expression in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells using cDNA microarrays.', 'GADD45gamma: a new vitamin D-regulated gene that is antiproliferative in prostate cancer cells.', 'Induction of androgen receptor by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 9-cis retinoic acid in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', '1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 modulates lipid metabolism in prostate cancer cells through miRNA mediated regulation of PPARA.', '1α,25(OH)2D3 differentially regulates miRNA expression in human bladder cancer cells.', 'Calcitriol attenuates liver fibrosis through hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 3-transactivated protein 1-mediated TGF β1/Smad3 and NF-κB signaling pathways.', 'MiR-371a-5p Positively Associates with Hepatocellular Carcinoma Malignancy but Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Oxaliplatin by Suppressing BECN1-Dependent Autophagy.', 'Vitamin D Deficiency Impacts Exposure and Response of Pravastatin in Male Rats by Altering Hepatic OATPs.', 'Vitamin D and Breast Cancer: Mechanistic Update.', 'CPLM 4.0: an updated database with rich annotations for protein lysine modifications.']"""

Optical coherence tomography has been used for the diagnosis of retinal disease and has been used experimentally for imaging of vascular plaques, gastrointestinal pathology, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and recently to examine benign kidney microanatomy. It has not been previously used to image kidney cancer. This study presents the first data on the utility of OCT in the imaging for renal neoplasms. It found that OCT was most successful in distinguishing AML and TCC from normal parenchyma. OCT had more limited success at differentiating oncocytoma. Clear cell tumors and other renal cancer subtypes had a more heterogenous appearance, precluding reliable identification using OCT. The study shows that higher resolution versions of OCT, such as OCM, will be needed to allow optical coherence imaging to reach clinical utility in the assessment of renal neoplasms.  Objectives:   • To determine the appearance of normal and neoplastic renal tissue when imaged with optical coherence tomography (OCT). • To preliminarily assess the feasibility of using OCT to differentiate normal and neoplastic renal tissue.  Patients and methods:   • After radical or partial nephrectomy in 20 subjects, normal renal parenchyma and neoplastic tissue samples were obtained. • The tissue was evaluated with light microscopy and using a bench-top laboratory OCT system with a lateral resolution of 10 µm. • OCT images were compared with histological slides to evaluate the ability of OCT to differentiate renal neoplasms.  Results:   • Pathological subtypes included eight clear-cell, three papillary and two chromophobe renal carcinomas; two oncocytomas; one angiomyolipoma (AML); two transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs); and one haematoma. • Using OCT, benign renal parenchyma showed recognizable glomeruli and tubules. • TCC had a distinctive appearance on OCT whereas AML showed a unique identifiable signature because of its fat content. Oncocytomas had a lobulated appearance, which appeared subtly different from renal carcinoma. • Renal carcinoma lacked recognizable anatomical elements and had a heterogeneous appearance making differentiation from normal parenchyma at times difficult. • Subtypes of renal cancer appeared to vary on OCT imaging although discrimination was unreliable.  Conclusions:   • OCT imaging for renal neoplasms was most successful in distinguishing AML and TCC from normal parenchyma and malignant tumours. Oncocytoma differed subtly from renal carcinoma, making distinction more challenging. • Clear-cell tumours and other renal carcinoma subtypes had a heterogeneous appearance on OCT, which precluded reliable differentiation from normal parenchyma and between renal carcinoma subtypes. • Higher resolution versions of optical coherence imaging, such as optical coherence microscopy, will be necessary to achieve clinical utility.""","""['Jennifer A Linehan', 'Erika R Bracamonte', 'Lida P Hariri', 'Mitchell H Sokoloff', 'Photini S Rice', 'Jennifer K Barton', 'Mike M Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Differentiation between normal renal tissue and renal tumours using functional optical coherence tomography: a phase I in vivo human study.', 'Determination of characteristics of degenerative joint disease using optical coherence tomography and polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography.', 'Differential expression of the enzyme that esterifies retinol, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase, in subtypes of human renal cancer and normal kidney.', 'Optical coherence tomography: feasibility for basic research and image-guided surgery of breast cancer.', 'Frontiers in bronchoscopic imaging.', 'A pilot and ex-vivo study of examination of endometrium tissue by catheter based optical coherence tomography.', 'The clinical usefulness of optical coherence tomography during cancer interventions.', 'Clinical applications of optical coherence tomography in urology.', 'Real-time cancer diagnosis during prostate biopsy: ex vivo evaluation of full-field optical coherence tomography (FFOCT) imaging on biopsy cores.', 'Current and evolving uses of optical coherence tomography in the genitourinary tract.']"""

All patients with newly diagnosed PCa after HoLEP were retrospectively identified. Pre- and postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), biopsy history, pathological features and disease progression were examined. Patients were matched to a control group with benign pathology for outcome comparisons. The database consisted of 240 consecutive patients, aged 52-90 years with prostate sizes from 25 to 375 cm(3) . A total of 28 patients were identified with incidental PCa (14 cT1a and 14 cT1b). Median follow up was 11 months and 13 months for cT1a and cT1b, respectively. Hospitalization time, catheterization time, complications and functional outcomes were similar. Three patients with cT1b required additional treatment as a result of PSA progression. All other cancers are being closely followed. The functional benefits of HoLEP are well established. The incidental PCa detection rate of 11.7% shows the potential benefit of pathological analysis. Just 10.7% of these patients received additional treatment, but this might be significant as these patients would otherwise go untreated.

To enhance the sensitivity of conventional immunoassay technology for the detection of PSA in sera, we adopted a localized surface plasmon coupled fluorescence fiber-optic biosensor, which combines a sandwich immunoassay with the localized surface plasmon technique. The concentration of total PSA (t-PSA) (from 0.1 to 1000 pg/mL) in phosphate-buffered saline solution and the normalized fluorescence signal exhibit a linear relationship where the correlation coefficient is 0.9574. In addition, the concentration of additional t-PSA in 10-fold-diluted healthly women's serum across a similar range was measured. The correlation coefficient for this measurement is 0.9142. In clinical serum samples, moreover, the experimental results of t-PSA detection show that both the mean value and median of normalized fluorescence signals in the breast cancer group (155.2 and 145.7, respectively) are higher than those in the noncancer group (46.6 and 37.1, respectively).

Such receptors have been well described in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Despite the finding that the androgen receptor of LNCaP aberrantly recognizes a variety of steroids, including estrogen and progesterone, as androgenic agonists, there are no studies which examine the effect of estrogen antagonists and progesterone antagonist on baseline and androgen-stimulated LNCaP growth. In this report, LNCaP cells were cultured in phenol red-free media using charcoal-stripped sera. As previously reported, flutamide enhanced LNCaP growth and bicalutamide inhibited androgen-stimulated LNCaP proliferation. Neither tamoxifen nor RU486 influenced LNCaP growth (either in the presence or absence of exogenous androgens).

An example of five dimensional radiotherapy""","""It is very attractive, due to the assumed low alfa/beta ratio of prostate cancer (PC), to construct new treatment schedules for prostate cancer using only a few large fractions of radiation (hypofractionation). This will widen the therapeutic window since the ratio for PC might be lower than that of the organs at risk (OAR). PC is an extremely variable disease and often contains both highly and poorly differentiated cells. It is reasonable to assume that different cells have different patterns of radiosensitivity, i.e. alfa/beta ratios and proliferation. In this study we will simulate the effect on the outcome of the treatment with different fractionations and different ratios.  Material and methods:   In this simulation we use an extension of the Linear Quadratic (LQ)/Biological Effective Dose (BED) formula called the dose volume inhomogeneity corrected BED (DVIC-BED). In the formula the tumour volume is divided in 50 subvolumes (step of 2%) and it is possible to calculate the relative effect of the treatment with different ratios (1.5, 4 and 6.5) in different subvolumes.  Results:   The simulations demonstrate that only a small portion (5-10%) of cells with a higher ratio will dramatically change the effect of the treatment. Increasing the total dose can compensate this, but this will on the other hand increase the dose to the OAR and also the risk for severe side effects.  Conclusion:   These simulations highlight possible reasons for concerns about the use of hypofractionation for pathologically heterogeneous tumours, such as prostate cancer, and also demonstrate the need for testing new treatment schedules using both high and low ratios.""","""['Bo Lennernäs', 'Sten Nilsson', 'Seymour Levitt']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Four and five dimensional radiotherapy with reference to prostate cancer--definitions, state of the art and further directions--an overview.', 'Comparison of biologically equivalent dose-volume parameters for the treatment of prostate cancer with concomitant boost IMRT versus IMRT combined with brachytherapy.', 'Effect of patient variation on standard- and hypo-fractionated radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Power against prostate cancer.

As most reported cases are from transurethral resection specimens, the anatomic location and histologic spectrum of this entity have not been fully elucidated. Its immunohistochemical profile using current prostatic diagnostic markers has also not been well studied. In this study, we retrospectively characterized 10 cases of mesonephric remnant hyperplasia involving the prostate and periprostatic tissue, including 8 cases seen in radical prostatectomy specimens, with emphasis on the histopathologic and immunohistochemical features. Patients ranged in age from 48 to 70 years (average, 60 y). Seven of them had concurrent prostatic adenocarcinoma and underwent radical prostatectomy; one patient underwent prostatectomy because of the misdiagnosis of mesonephric remnant hyperplasia on transurethral resection as carcinoma; 2 patients had transurethral resection for urinary obstruction. The distribution of prostatic mesonephric hyperplasia was concentrated in 2 areas: one was in the anterior fibromuscular stroma and adjacent anterolateral periprostatic tissue (n=6 of 8); the other was located toward the base posteriorly and posterolaterally either within or exterior to the prostate and around the seminal vesicle (n=4 of 8). Histologic patterns observed included the following: small-to-medium-sized acini or tubules with a lobular distribution (n=10 of 10); cysts either in clusters or scattered containing secretions (n=8 of 10); small or ill-formed glands with an infiltrative growth (n=7 of 10); glands with papillary infoldings or micropapillary tufts (n=4 of 10); and 2 cases exceptionally displayed nodules of ill-formed small glands intermixed with spindle cells, mimicking sclerosing adenosis or Gleason pattern 5 prostate cancer. Most cases (7 of 10) had florid hyperplasia and harbored 3 or more growth patterns. All cases were negative for prostate-specific antigen. Cytokeratin 34βE12 was diffusely positive in 4 of 9 cases, and showed focal immunoreactivity in the remaining 5 cases. Except for focal positivity seen in 4 of 7 cases, p63 was largely negative. Racemase was focally positive in 4 of 7 cases. Small glands with an infiltrative growth pattern, the most difficult to distinguish from cancer, were negative (n=3 of 6) or only focally positive (n=3 of 6) for 34βE12, negative for p63 (n=6 of 6), and focally positive for racemase (n=4 of 6). All cases examined in the study were diffusely positive for PAX8. In conclusion, mesonephric remnant hyperplasia not only involves the bladder neck and base of the prostate as previously described, but may also present as a florid growth in the anterior fibromuscular stroma from the apex to the base, closely mimicking prostate cancer. Although basal cell marker and racemase expression overlaps with prostate cancer, mesonephric hyperplasia's unique morphology along with distinctive immunohistochemical expression of PAX8 and lack of prostate-specific antigen can help in distinguishing this benign entity from prostatic adenocarcinoma.""","""['Ying-bei Chen', 'Samson W Fine', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Florid hyperplasia of mesonephric remnants involving prostate and periprostatic tissue.

Existing prediction models have only modest capabilities to classify persons at risk accurately.  Methods:   Prospective data from 70 962 control subjects in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) were used in models for the general population (model 1) and for a subcohort of ever-smokers (N = 38 254) (model 2). Both models included age, socioeconomic status (education), body mass index, family history of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent chest x-ray, smoking status (never, former, or current), pack-years smoked, and smoking duration. Model 2 also included smoking quit-time (time in years since ever-smokers permanently quit smoking). External validation was performed with 44 223 PLCO intervention arm participants who completed a supplemental questionnaire and were subsequently followed. Known available risk factors were included in logistic regression models. Bootstrap optimism-corrected estimates of predictive performance were calculated (internal validation). Nonlinear relationships for age, pack-years smoked, smoking duration, and quit-time were modeled using restricted cubic splines. All reported P values are two-sided.  Results:   During follow-up (median 9.2 years) of the control arm subjects, 1040 lung cancers occurred. During follow-up of the external validation sample (median 3.0 years), 213 lung cancers occurred. For models 1 and 2, bootstrap optimism-corrected receiver operator characteristic area under the curves were 0.857 and 0.805, and calibration slopes (model-predicted probabilities vs observed probabilities) were 0.987 and 0.979, respectively. In the external validation sample, models 1 and 2 had area under the curves of 0.841 and 0.784, respectively. These models had high discrimination in women, men, whites, and nonwhites.

We used a preoperative clinical discovery platform to prioritize pathways for assessment as therapeutic targets and to test the hypothesis that the primary site harbors potentially lethal tumors after aggressive treatment.  Patients and methods:   Patients with locally advanced or lymph node-metastatic prostate cancer underwent 1 year of androgen ablation and three cycles of docetaxel therapy, followed by prostatectomy. All specimens were characterized for stage by accepted criteria. Expression of select molecular markers implicated in disease progression and therapy resistance was determined immunohistochemically and compared with that in 30 archived specimens from untreated patients with high-grade prostate cancer. Marker expression was divided into three groups: intracellular signaling pathways, stromal-epithelial interaction pathways, and angiogenesis.  Results:   Forty patients were enrolled, 30 (75%) of whom underwent prostatectomy and two (5%) who underwent cystoprostatectomy. Twenty-nine specimens contained sufficient residual tumor for inclusion in a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased epithelial and stromal expression of CYP17, SRD5A1, and Hedgehog pathway components, and modulations of the insulin-like growth factor I pathway.

We reasoned that a radiopharmaceutical that measures intratumoral changes in AR signaling could substantially improve our understanding of AR pathway directed therapies. Expanding on previous observations, we first show that prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is repressed by androgen treatment in multiple models of AR-positive prostate cancer in an AR-dependent manner. Conversely, antiandrogens up-regulate PSMA expression. These expression changes, including increased PSMA expression in response to treatment with the antiandrogen MDV3100, can be quantitatively measured in vivo in human prostate cancer xenograft models through PET imaging with a fully humanized, radiolabeled antibody to PSMA, (64)Cu-J591. Collectively, these results establish that relative changes in PSMA expression levels can be quantitatively measured using a human-ready imaging reagent and could serve as a biomarker of AR signaling to noninvasively evaluate AR activity in patients with CRPC.""","""['Michael J Evans', 'Peter M Smith-Jones', 'John Wongvipat', 'Vincent Navarro', 'Sae Kim', 'Neil H Bander', 'Steven M Larson', 'Charles L Sawyers']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['A novel antiandrogen, Compound 30, suppresses castration-resistant and MDV3100-resistant prostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.', 'Methylselenol prodrug enhances MDV3100 efficacy for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A novel regulation of PSMA and PSA expression by Q640X AR in 22Rv1 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Bimodal Conjugates of Cytotoxic Agents and Antiandrogens and Their Comparative Assessment with Monoconjugates.', 'Synthesis and Evaluation of 99mTc-Labeled PSMA-Targeted Tracers Based on the Lys-Urea-Aad Pharmacophore for Detecting Prostate Cancer with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography.', 'Designed ankyrin repeat proteins for detecting prostate-specific antigen expression in vivo.', 'Landscape of prostate-specific membrane antigen heterogeneity and regulation in AR-positive and AR-negative metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Reversible epigenetic alterations mediate PSMA expression heterogeneity in advanced metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included 70 patients (PSA level, > 4 ng/mL; free-to-total PSA ratio, < 20%) who underwent endorectal 1.5-T MRI before biopsy. We graded the likelihood of cancer on a 5-point scale. Imaging data were compared with histologic results on biopsy or prostatectomy. Accuracies were estimated from the area under receiver operating characteristic using the hemiprostate as the unit of analysis. A p value less than 0.05 denoted statistical significance.  Results:   The model combining all variables was more accurate than each variable alone (95.2% vs 73.5% for T2WI, 76.0% for MRS, 81.8% for DWI, 75.6% for DCE-MRI, and 78.8% for free-to-total PSA ratio). The complete model had accuracy similar to that of combining two imaging variables with free-to-total PSA ratio, especially free-to-total PSA ratio, T2WI, and DWI (94.0%); and free-to-total PSA ratio, DWI, and MRS (93.8%); with negative predictive values of 91.0% and 89.5%, respectively. The best models combining two imaging variables (MRS and DWI, 85.8%; T2WI and DWI, 84.8%) had accuracy that was similar to that of the combination of all imaging variables (87.3%) and higher than that of the best individual imaging variable (DWI, 81.8%), but lower than that of the complete model.  Conclusion:   The combination of at least one functional technique with free-to-total PSA ratio is more accurate than combining only imaging variables in cancer detection. The use of more than two imaging variables does not increase the detection rate.

Indirubin, an active molecule identified in the traditional Chinese herbal medicine-Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis), has been used to treat leukemia for decades. However, the anticancer properties of Natura-alpha, an indirubin derivative, are not well studied in solid tumors, particularly in PC.  Experimental design:   The growth kinetics and invasion ability of on human PC cell lines with or without Natura-alpha treatment were measured by cell proliferation and invasion assays. The antitumor effects of Natura-alpha were examined in nude mice tumor xenograft models, and in a patient with advanced hormone-refractory metastatic PC. Signal network proteins targeted by Natura-alpha were analyzed by using proteomic pathway array analysis (PPAA) on xenografts.  Results:   Natura-alpha inhibited the growth of both androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (LNCaP-AI, PC-3, and DU145) PC cells with IC(50) between 4 to 10 mmol/L, and also inhibited invasion of androgen-independent PC cells. Its antitumor effects were further evident in in vivo tumor reduction in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent nude mice tumor xenograft models and reduced tumor volume in the patient with hormone refractory metastatic PC. PPAA revealed that antiproliferative and antiinvasive activities of Natura-alpha on PC might primarily be through its downregulation of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) protein. Forced overexpression of FOXM1 largely reversed the inhibition of growth and invasion by Natura-alpha.

Methods and materials:   Between January 2008 and April 2010, 24 patients with localized prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled in the Evaluation of the Response to Irradiation with MR Spectroscopy (ERIS) trial. All the patients had been treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy with or without long-term adjuvant hormonal therapy (LTHT) and underwent 3-T MRS and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assays at baseline and every 3 months thereafter up to 12 months.  Results:   After radiation, the mean normalized citrate level (citrate/water) decreased significantly over time, both in the peripheral zone (PZ) (p = 0.0034) and in the entire prostate (p = 0.0008), whereas no significant change was observed in mean normalized choline levels (choline/water) in the PZ (p = 0.84) and in the entire prostate (p = 0.95). At 6 months after radiation, the mean choline level was significantly lower in the PZ for patients with a PSA value of ≤0.5 ng/mL at 12 months (4.9 ± 1.7 vs. 7.1 ± 1.5, p = 0.0378). Similar results were observed at 12 months in the PZ (6.2 ± 2.3 vs. 11.4 ± 4.1, p = 0.0117 for choline level and 3.4 ± 0.7 vs. 16.1 ± 6.1, p = 0.0054 for citrate level) and also in the entire prostate (6.2 ± 1.9 vs. 10.4 ± 3.2, p = 0.014 for choline level and 3.0 ± 0.8 vs. 13.3 ± 4.7, p = 0.0054 for citrate level).

We sought to investigate this possibility by analyzing the source of our patient population for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).  Methods:   We reviewed 200 consecutive patients who underwent robotic prostatectomy by a single surgeon (RA) at our institution. The source of referral for each patient was analyzed along with individual patient characteristics to identify whether only low-risk or unusually ideal candidates were referred.  Results:   Of the 200 patients, 90.5% were referred by a urologist with only 5.5% being referred by another urologist at our institution. Only <10 patients cited media or marketing sources as the reason for self-referral, and 10 were referred by primary care physicians or other acquaintances. This referral pattern did not change between the first and second 100 patients. Referred patients included those up to 80 years of age, up to 51 kg/m(2) in body mass index, and up to Gleason 9 on biopsy, with 36% of those referred by urologists having some history of previous abdominal or prostate surgery.  Conclusion:   The referral pattern for RALP at our institution may reflect a growing acceptance of robotic surgery among urologists in our region and is unlikely driven by patient-directed marketing.

Using AuNPs coupled with dynamic light scattering (DLS) detection, we developed a facile nanoparticle immunoassay for serum protein biomarker detection and analysis. A serum sample was first mixed with a citrate-protected AuNP solution. Proteins from the serum were adsorbed to the AuNPs to form a protein corona on the nanoparticle surface. An antibody solution was then added to the assay solution to analyze the target proteins of interest that are present in the protein corona. The protein corona formation and the subsequent binding of antibody to the target proteins in the protein corona were detected by DLS.  Results:   Using this simple assay, we discovered multiple molecular aberrations associated with prostate cancer from both mice and human blood serum samples. From the mice serum study, we observed difference in the size of the protein corona and mouse IgG level between different mice groups (i.e., mice with aggressive or less aggressive prostate cancer, and normal healthy controls). Furthermore, it was found from both the mice model and the human serum sample study that the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, a protein that is associated with tumor angiogenesis) adsorbed to the AuNPs is decreased in cancer samples compared to non-cancerous or less malignant cancer samples.

Heterogeneity could be due to multiple cancer cell types with distinct gene expression. Of clinical importance is the so-called cancer stem cell type. Cell type-specific transcriptomes are used to examine lineage relationship among cancer cell types and their expression similarity to normal cell types including stem/progenitor cells.  Methods:   Transcriptomes were determined by Affymetrix DNA array analysis for the following cell types. Putative prostate progenitor cell populations were characterized and isolated by expression of the membrane transporter ABCG2. Stem cells were represented by embryonic stem and embryonal carcinoma cells. The cancer cell types were Gleason pattern 3 (glandular histomorphology) and pattern 4 (aglandular) sorted from primary tumors, cultured prostate cancer cell lines originally established from metastatic lesions, xenografts LuCaP 35 (adenocarcinoma phenotype) and LuCaP 49 (neuroendocrine/small cell carcinoma) grown in mice. No detectable gene expression differences were detected among serial passages of the LuCaP xenografts.  Results:   Based on transcriptomes, the different cancer cell types could be clustered into a luminal-like grouping and a non-luminal-like (also not basal-like) grouping. The non-luminal-like types showed expression more similar to that of stem/progenitor cells than the luminal-like types. However, none showed expression of stem cell genes known to maintain stemness.

Here, we demonstrate that melatonin inhibits the proliferation of LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cells via activation of the same MT(1) receptor-mediated antiproliferative signaling pathway. Knockdown of the expression of wild-type androgen receptor (AR) and/or structural/functional AR variants in LNCaP, VCaP, 22Rv1, and RWPE-1 cells resulted in abrogation of melatonin receptor-mediated antiproliferation, indicating that the antiproliferative signaling pathway MT(1) /(Gα(s) ) PKA + (Gα(q) ) PKC/p27(Kip1) activated by melatonin in human prostate epithelial cells is AR dependent. Furthermore, melatonin was shown to decrease androgen/AR-mediated transactivation of the prostate-specific antigen promoter in the prostate epithelial cell lines. Together, our data indicate the presence of reciprocal functional interactions between MT(1) receptor and AR signaling in malignant and nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells. Notably, the dual actions of the MT(1) receptor-mediated antiproliferative signaling, leading to down-regulation of activated AR signaling and up-regulation of p27(Kip1) , constitute the mechanistic basis for the potential use of melatonin in chemoprevention of prostate cancer, as well as in a novel therapeutic strategy, comprising a combination of melatonin repletion and androgen depletion, for the treatment of advanced or relapsed disease.""","""['Chun W Tam', 'Stephen Y W Shiu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Pineal Res""","""['Melatonin as a negative mitogenic hormonal regulator of human prostate epithelial cell growth: potential mechanisms and clinical significance.', 'Signal transduction of receptor-mediated antiproliferative action of melatonin on human prostate epithelial cells involves dual activation of Gα(s) and Gα(q) proteins.', 'Melatonin MT1 receptor-induced transcriptional up-regulation of p27(Kip1) in prostate cancer antiproliferation is mediated via inhibition of constitutively active nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB): potential implications on prostate cancer chemoprevention and therapy.', 'Influence of stromal-epithelial interactions on androgen action.', 'Concise review: androgen receptor differential roles in stem/progenitor cells including prostate, embryonic, stromal, and hematopoietic lineages.', 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'Long-term environmental exposure of darkness induces hyperandrogenism in PCOS via melatonin receptor 1A and aromatase reduction.', 'Circadian Rhythm Disruption as a Contributor to Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer.', 'Membrane Melatonin Receptors Activated Cell Signaling in Physiology and Disease.', 'Melatonin as an Adjuvant to Antiangiogenic Cancer Treatments.']"""

Annexin/PI (propidium iodide) staining showed an increase in apoptotic death of PC3 cells in the presence of GdCl3. Wound healing and adhesion assay indicated that GdCl3 suppressed PC3 cell migration. Western-blot analysis demonstrated that GdCl3 treatment inhibited phosphorylation of ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Pretreatment with PTx (pertussis toxin), a Gi protein inhibitor, conferred resistance to GdCl3-induced colony formation, ERK and p38 phosphorylation in PC3 cells.

The RALP and RRP patients were matched 1:2 on the basis of age and the D'Amico Risk Classification of Prostate Cancer; 77 RALP and 154 RRP. An economic evaluation was made to estimate direct costs of the first postoperative year and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per successful surgical treatment and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). A successful RP was defined as: no residual cancer (PSA <0.2 ng/ml, preserved urinary continence and erectile function. A one-way sensitivity analysis was made to investigate the impact of changing one variable at a time.  Results:   The ICER per extra successful treatment was €64,343 using RALP. For indirect costs, the ICER per extra successful treatment was €13,514 using RALP. The difference in effectiveness between RALP and RRP procedures was 7% in favour of RALP. In the present study no QALY was gained 1 year after RALP, however this result is uncertain due to a high degree of missing data. The sensitivity analysis did not change the results noticeably.  Limitations:   The study was limited by the design resulting in a low percentage of information on the effect of medication for erectile dysfunction and only short-term quality of life was measured at 1 year postoperatively.  Conclusion:   RALP was more effective and more costly.

Now, we have tested the effect of inhibition of the neuropeptide Substance P (SP), a NK1 ligand, as a potential therapeutic approach in cancer. We found that the inhibition of SP with antibodies strongly inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in breast, colon, and prostate cancer cell lines. These effects were accompained by a decrease in the mitogen-activated kinase singaling pathway. Interestingly, in some cell lines SP abrogation decreased the steady state of Her2 and EGFR, suggesting that SP-mediated signaling is important for the basal activity of these ErbB receptors. In consequence, we observed a blockade of the cell cycle progression and the inhibition of several cell cycle-related proteins including mTOR. SP inhibition also induced cell death in cell lines resistant to Lapatinib and Trastuzumab that have increased levels of active Her2, suggesting that this therapeutic approach could be also effective for those cancers resistant to current anti-ErbB therapies.

Materials and methods:   A prostate model of fresh porcine abdomen and special polyvinylchloride (PVC) sheets was developed. To verify the model, deviations from 311 needle placements of real prostate implants were analyzed. Second, the accuracy of the template-guided positioning versus robot-assisted positioning was measured with 20 needle insertions in the model. For robot-assisted positioning, different velocities (2.7, 5.4, 9.8 mm/s) of needle insertion were investigated.  Results:   The average needle positioning accuracies of manual template guidance on the model closely resembled those of real patients (approximately 3 mm). The average needle positioning accuracy for the robot-assisted method on the prostate model was 1.8 ± 0.6 mm, at a velocity of 2.7 mm/s and, in comparison to the template-guided method (2.7 ± 0.7 mm), was statistically more precise (p < 0.001). At higher robotic velocities, the measured needle positioning accuracy showed no significant difference from that of the manual insertion procedure.  Conclusion:   By employing a prostate model, we showed for the first time that robot-assisted needle placement for HDR brachy-therapy is significantly more precise than the conventional method at a velocity of 2.7 mm/s.

Methods:   Agelasine B was purified from a marine sponge Agelas clathrodes and assayed for cytotoxicity by MTT on two human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and SKBr3), on a prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and on human fibroblasts. Changes in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations were assessed with FURA 2 and by confocal microscopy. Determination of Ca(2+)-ATPase activity was followed by Pi measurements. Changes in the mitochondria electrochemical potential was followed with Rhodamine 123. Apoptosis and DNA fragmentation were determined by TUNEL experiments.  Results:   Upon agelasine B treatment, cell viability of both human breast cancer cell lines was one order of magnitude lower as compared with fibroblasts (IC(50) for MCF-7 = 2.99 μM; SKBr3: IC(50) = 3.22 μM vs. fibroblasts: IC(50) = 32.91 μM), while the IC(50) for PC-3 IC(50) = 6.86 μM. Agelasine B induced a large increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in MCF-7, SKBr3, and PC-3 cells. By the use of confocal microscopy coupled to a perfusion system, we could observe that this toxin releases Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We also demonstrated that agelasine B produces a potent inhibition of the ER Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and that this compound induced the fragmentation of DNA. Accordingly, agelasine B reduced the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and was able to activate caspase 8, without affecting the activity of caspase 7.  Conclusions:   Agelasine B in MCF-7 cells induce the activation of apoptosis in response to a sustained increase in the [Ca(2+)]( i ) after blocking the SERCA activity.

Here, we report that PSP, an active component extracted from the mushroom Turkey tail (also known as Coriolus versicolor), is effective in targeting prostate CSCs. We found that treatment of the prostate cancer cell line PC-3 with PSP led to the down-regulation of CSC markers (CD133 and CD44) in a time and dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, PSP treatment not only suppressed the ability of PC-3 cells to form prostaspheres under non-adherent culture conditions, but also inhibited their tumorigenicity in vivo, further proving that PSP can suppress prostate CSC properties. To investigate if the anti-CSC effect of PSP may lead to prostate cancer chemoprevention, transgenic mice (TgMAP) that spontaneously develop prostate tumors were orally fed with PSP for 20 weeks. Whereas 100% of the mice that fed with water only developed prostate tumors at the end of experiment, no tumors could be found in any of the mice fed with PSP, suggesting that PSP treatment can completely inhibit prostate tumor formation.

To clarify in vivo effects of genistein in advanced prostate cancer patients, we developed a patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft model, in which a clinical prostatectomy sample was grafted into immune deficient mice. Our results showed an increased lymph node (LN) and secondary organ metastases in genistein-treated mice compared to untreated controls. Interestingly, invasive malignant cells aggregated to form islands/micrometastasis only in the secondary organs of the genistein-treated groups, not in the untreated control group. To understand the underlying mechanism for metastatic progression, we examined cell proliferation and apoptosis on paraffin-sections. Immunohistological data show that tumors of genistein-treated groups have more proliferating and fewer apoptotic cancer cells than those of the untreated group. Our immunoblotting data suggest that increased proliferation and metastasis are linked to enhanced activities of tyrosine kinases, EGFR and its downstream Src, in genistein-treated groups.

Restricting flux through anabolic pathways is an attractive approach to deprive tumours of the building blocks needed to sustain tumour growth. Therefore, we searched for targets of the AR that may contribute to these anabolic processes and could be amenable to therapeutic intervention by virtue of differential expression in prostate tumours. This highlighted calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2, which we show is overexpressed in prostate cancer and regulates cancer cell growth via its unexpected role as a hormone-dependent modulator of anabolic metabolism.

As a strategy to induce the maximal inhibition of this pathway in cancer cells, we combined allosteric mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and RAD001) with a dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor (PI-103). Both in vitro and in vivo, the combination exhibited more activity than single agents in human ovarian and prostate cancer cells that harbor alterations in the pathway. At the molecular level, combined inhibition of mTOR prevented the rebound activation of Akt that is seen after treatment with rapamycin and its analogues and caused more sustained inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, the combination strongly inhibited the expression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR downstream proteins. In particular, it showed greater activity than the single agents in inhibiting the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in selective inhibition of CAP-dependent translation. A proteomic approach was used to confirm the identification of c-Myc as the key regulator for the reduction in downstream proteins affected by the combined inhibition of mTOR. In conclusion, the combination of a catalytic and an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR shows greater activity, without a concomitant increase in toxicity, than either drug alone, and this may have therapeutic implications for inhibiting this pathway in the clinical setting.""","""['Marco Mazzoletti', 'Francesca Bortolin', 'Laura Brunelli', 'Roberta Pastorelli', 'Silvana Di Giandomenico', 'Eugenio Erba', 'Paolo Ubezio', 'Massimo Broggini']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['The role of PI3K/mTOR inhibition in combination with sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.', 'Synthetic lethal interaction between PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/MEK/ERK pathway inhibition in rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Arsenic disulfide synergizes with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor PI-103 to eradicate acute myeloid leukemia stem cells by inducing differentiation.', 'PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors in the therapy of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.', 'New inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway for cancer.', 'Integrative analysis of ferroptosis regulators for clinical prognosis based on deep learning and potential chemotherapy sensitivity of prostate cancer.', 'Exploring synthetic lethal network for the precision treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Blocking PI3K p110β Attenuates Development of PTEN-Deficient Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Metabolic Pathways and Targets in Chondrosarcoma.', 'Quadruple-editing of the MAPK and PI3K pathways effectively blocks the progression of KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer cells.']"""

It has also been shown that it is characterized by the late release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which acts through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and augments the presentation of antigens from dying tumor cells to DCs. Most of the data on immunogenic tumor cell death were obtained using mouse models. In this study, we investigated the capacity of clinically used chemotherapeutics to induce immunogenic cell death in human tumor cell lines and primary tumor cells. We found that only anthracyclines induced a rapid translocation of calreticulin, HSP70, and HSP90 to the cell surface and the release of HMGB1 12 hours after the treatment. The interaction of immature DCs with immunogenic tumor cells led to an increased tumor cell uptake and induces moderate phenotypic maturation of DCs. Killed tumor cell-loaded DCs efficiently stimulated tumor-specific IFN-γ-producing T cells. DCs pulsed with killed immunogenic tumor cells also induced significantly lower numbers of regulatory T cells than those pulsed with nonimmunogenic tumor cells. These data indicate that human prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells share the key features of immunogenic cell death with mice tumor cells.

The aim of this study was to investigate cancer risk in hyperprolactinemia patients. Design A population-based matched cohort study in Sweden.  Methods:   The hyperprolactinemia cohort consisted of patients hospitalized for hyperprolactinemia from 1987 to 1995 identified in the National Patient Register (n=585) and a hospital cohort of prolactinoma patients at Karolinska University Hospital (n=384). For each patient, ten matched individuals were identified via the Register of Population. Cancer occurrence was ascertained via the Swedish Cancer Registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Seventy-three malignant tumors were identified in the hyperprolactinemia patients and 660 tumors in the comparison group (HR 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.68), mainly attributed to an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal cancer in both males and females (HR 3.69; 95% CI: 1.70-8.03) and hematopoietic cancer in females (HR 3.51; 95% CI: 1.06-11.6). Twelve breast cancers occurred in the female patients, corresponding to an HR of 1.09 (95% CI: 0.60-1.99). Prostate cancer risk in hyperprolactinemia men was reduced (HR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.16-0.99).  Conclusions:   An increased overall cancer risk was found in hyperprolactinemia patients, but no increased risk of breast cancer in women and a reduced risk of prostate cancer in men.

Mining co-TFs is thus important to understand the mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Although existing methods can identify co-TFs, their accuracy depends heavily on the chosen background model and other parameters such as the enrichment window size and the PWM score cut-off. In this study, we have developed a novel web-based co-motif scanning program called CENTDIST (http://compbio.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chipseq/centdist/). In comparison to current co-motif scanning programs, CENTDIST does not require the input of any user-specific parameters and background information. Instead, CENTDIST automatically determines the best set of parameters and ranks co-TF motifs based on their distribution around ChIP-seq peaks. We tested CENTDIST on 14 ChIP-seq data sets and found CENTDIST is more accurate than existing methods. In particular, we applied CENTDIST on an Androgen Receptor (AR) ChIP-seq data set from a prostate cancer cell line and correctly predicted all known co-TFs (eight TFs) of AR in the top 20 hits as well as discovering AP4 as a novel co-TF of AR (which was missed by existing methods). Taken together, CENTDIST, which exploits the imbalanced nature of co-TF binding, is a user-friendly, parameter-less and powerful predictive web-based program for understanding the mechanism of transcriptional co-regulation.""","""['Zhizhuo Zhang', 'Cheng Wei Chang', 'Wan Ling Goh', 'Wing-Kin Sung', 'Edwin Cheung']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['TICA: Transcriptional Interaction and Coregulation Analyzer.', 'MEME-ChIP: motif analysis of large DNA datasets.', 'A novel transcriptional network for the androgen receptor in human epididymis epithelial cells.', 'Role of ChIP-seq in the discovery of transcription factor binding sites, differential gene regulation mechanism, epigenetic marks and beyond.', 'DNA sequence motif: a jack of all trades for ChIP-Seq data.', 'A map of cis-regulatory modules and constituent transcription factor binding sites in 80% of the mouse genome.', 'TF-COMB - Discovering grammar of transcription factor binding sites.', 'NAUTICA: classifying transcription factor interactions by positional and protein-protein interaction information.', 'Integrating Peak Colocalization and Motif Enrichment Analysis for the Discovery of Genome-Wide Regulatory Modules and Transcription Factor Recruitment Rules.', 'The hydroxymethylome of multiple myeloma identifies FAM72D as a 1q21 marker linked to proliferation.']"""

The follow-up is too limited to address the difference in DSS stratified for screening interval.  Conclusions:   In the setting of population-based PCa screening at 4-yr intervals, the DSS of men with interval cancer seems to be similar to that of men with PCa in the control arm. Given that interval cancers contribute significantly to PCa mortality, further benefit in DSS in the screening arm may be achieved by decreasing the occurrence of interval cancer. However, the balance between mortality reduction and overdiagnosis should be preserved.

The suggested diagnostic criteria will formulate a guide for pCLE image interpretation in urology.  Methods:   Patients scheduled for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) or nephrectomy were recruited. After white-light cystoscopy (WLC), fluorescein was administered as contrast. Different areas of the urinary tract were imaged with pCLE via direct contact between the confocal probe and the area of interest. Confocal images were subsequently compared with standard hematoxylin and eosin analysis.  Results:   pCLE images were collected from 66 participants, including 2 patients who underwent nephrectomy. We identified key features associated with different anatomic landmarks of the urinary tract, including the kidney, ureter, bladder, prostate, and urethra. In vivo pCLE of the bladder demonstrated distinct differences between normal mucosa and neoplastic tissue. Using mosaicing, a post hoc image-processing algorithm, individual image frames were juxtaposed to form wide-angle views to better evaluate tissue microarchitecture.  Conclusions:   In contrast to standard pathologic analysis of fixed tissue with hematoxylin and eosin, pCLE provides real time microscopy of the urinary tract to enable dynamic interrogation of benign and neoplastic tissues in vivo.

Material and methods:   Eight men with prostate cancer who had (11)C-choline PET scans prior to radical prostatectomy were studied. Several methods were used to contour the DIL on the PET scans: visual, PET Edge, Region Grow, absolute standardised uptake value (SUV) thresholds and percentage of maximum SUV thresholds. Prostatectomy specimens were sliced in the transverse plane and DILs were delineated on these by a pathologist. These were then compared with the PET scans. The accuracy of correlation was assessed by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the Youden index.  Results:   The contouring method resulting in both the highest DSC and the highest Youden index was 60% of the maximum SUV (SUV(60%)), with values of 0.64 and 0.51, respectively. However SUV(60%) was not statistically significantly better than all of the other methods by either measure.

Materials and methods:   Full-length human EPLIN cDNA was cloned into a pEF6 expression vector and used to transfect the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line. Cells over expressing EPLIN were termed PC-3(EPLIN EXP) while wild-type and empty pEF6 vector control cells were designated PC-3(WT) and PC-3(pEF6), respectively. The in vitro and in vivo impact of EPLIN on PC-3 cells was examined using a number of model assays.  Results:   EPLIN over expression in PC-3 cells resulted in a decrease in the growth rate of this cell line (mean ± SD 0.6 ± 0.17 for PC-3(pEF6) cells vs 0.33 ± 0.01 for PC-3(EPLIN EXP) cells, p <0.01).

In asserting such rights, individuals make claims above and beyond their legal rights, but those claims are based on the society's existing commitments and moral culture. In the United States such a right to accessible basic health care is generated by various empirical social facts, primarily the conjunction of the legal requirement of access to emergency care with widely held principles about unfair free riding and just sharing of costs between well and ill. The right can get expressed in social policy through either single-payer or mandated insurance. (2) The same elements that generate this right provide modest assistance in determining its content, the structure and scope of a basic minimum of care. They justify limits on patient cost sharing, require comparative effectiveness, and make cost considerations relevant. They shed light on the status of expensive, marginally life extending, last-chance therapies, as well as life support for PVS patients. They are of less assistance in settling contentious debates about screening for breast and prostate cancer and treatments for infertility and erectile dysfunction, but even there they establish a useful framework for discussion.

One of the drawbacks of focal therapy of prostate cancer is the problem of correct identification of prostate cancer lesions. The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of real-time elastography to correctly identify the prostate cancer index lesion.  Materials and methods:   In 32 patients, real-time elastography was performed the day before prostatectomy. During the examination, the location of the main lesion suspicious for prostate cancer was prospectively recorded. Moreover, the results of the randomized multicore biopsies were also used to predict the location of the index lesion. The preoperative elastography results, the biopsy results, and a combined use of elastography and biopsy results were then compared with the pathological results to calculate the diagnostic values for correct index lesion identification.  Results:   When using real-time elastography alone to identify the prostate cancer index lesion, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and accuracy were 58.8, 43.3, 54.1, 48.1, and 51.6%, respectively. Data from randomized biopsies alone achieved 67.8, 48.4, 56.8, 60.0, and 58.1%, respectively. The combination of elastography and biopsy data increased the values to, respectively, 84.9, 48.4, 61.9, 75.0, and 66.1%.

However, the molecular mechanism of PPARγ agonist-induced cell growth inhibition of prostate cancer cells is not clear. GSK-3β expression and NFκB activity have important roles in prostate cancer development. To investigate the mechanisms of the PPARγ agonist-induced prostate cancer cell growth inhibition, we examined the effect of troglitazone on the expression of PPARγ, GSK-3β and activity of NFκB as well as on the prostate cancer cell growth. Troglitazone induced the expression of PPARγ in the nuclear of PC-3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells. Troglitazone (0-16 uM) inhibited cancer cell growth in a similar extend between both cells accompanied by the induction of cell cycle arrest in G(0)/G(1) phase and an increased in the similar extent of apoptotic cell death in concentration dependent manner. Troglitazone inhibited the constitutive expression of GSK-3β and activation of NFκB. Co-treatment of troglitazone with a GSK-3β inhibitor (AR-a014418) or GSK-3β siRNA significantly augmented the inhibitory effect of troglitazone on the NFκB activity and on prostate cancer cell growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death. However, overexpression of GSK-3β hindered troglitazone-induced cell growth inhibition and NFκB inactivation.

Androgen deprivation therapy is the mainstay in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer; however, after an initial response, the disease inevitably progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent evidence suggests that continued AR activation, sometimes in a ligand-independent manner, is commonly associated with the development of CRPC. Thus, novel agents targeting the AR are urgently needed as a strategic step in developing new therapies for this disease state. In this study, we investigated the effect of berberine on AR signaling in prostate cancer. We report that berberine decreased the transcriptional activity of AR. Berberine did not affect AR mRNA expression, but induced AR protein degradation. Several ligand-binding, domain-truncated AR splice variants have been identified, and these variants are believed to promote the development of CRPC in patients. Interestingly, we found that these variants were more susceptible to berberine-induced degradation than the full-length AR. Furthermore, although the growth of LNCaP xenografts in nude mice was inhibited by berberine, and AR expression was reduced in the tumors, the morphology and AR expression in normal prostates were not affected. This study is the first to show that berberine suppresses AR signaling and suggests that berberine, or its derivatives, presents a promising agent for the prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Jing Li', 'Bo Cao', 'Xichun Liu', 'Xueqi Fu', 'Zhenggang Xiong', 'Li Chen', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Yan Dong', 'Haitao Zhang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Unique targeting of androgen-dependent and -independent AR signaling in prostate cancer to overcome androgen resistance.', 'Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A novel prostate cancer therapeutic strategy using icaritin-activated arylhydrocarbon-receptor to co-target androgen receptor and its splice variants.', 'Recent progress in the development of protein-protein interaction inhibitors targeting androgen receptor-coactivator binding in prostate cancer.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Berberine: An Important Emphasis on Its Anticancer Effects through Modulation of Various Cell Signaling Pathways.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Berberine Suppresses Lung Metastasis of Cancer via Inhibiting Endothelial Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 1.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.', 'Berberine as a Potential Anticancer Agent: A Comprehensive Review.']"""

However, many are aggressive and can spread rapidly causing patient suffering and/or death. Current technology does not allow physicians to differentiate between slow growing and aggressive tumors at diagnosis. Hence, many patients are exposed to invasive treatment and its associated morbidities such as incontinence and impotence. Markers that enable differentiation between slow and fast progressing cancer will allow physicians to prevent unnecessary treatments on men who may not need them, and focus on the men with aggressive disease. A longitudinal study was conducted (N = 140) using mixed effects regression models to determine the association of obesity and smoking toward prostate cancer progression. These models account for correlation because of repeated measures over time, thus, using maximum amount of information provided by the subject. Estimates thus obtained are more robust and reliable than those obtained using data from a single time point. Rate of change of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) over time (PSA velocity) was used as a measure of prostate cancer progression. Results indicate that PSA velocity of overweight and obese subjects (0.59 and 1.05 ng/mL/year) was not significantly different as compared with normal weight subjects (p values .91 and .31, respectively). For men in the highest tertile of pack-years of smoking, PSA velocity was significantly higher as compared with never smokers 1.57 ng/mL/year (p = .04).

Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 763 consecutive patients undergoing RP between 2007 and 2010 were prospectively included and serially followed postoperatively for comparative analysis.  Intervention:   RARP was performed in 528 patients, and 235 underwent RRP.  Measurements:   Continence was defined as being completely pad free. Potency was defined as having erection sufficient for intercourse with or without a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. Continence and potency recovery were checked serially by interview and questionnaire at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 mo postoperatively. Cox proportional hazards method analyses was performed to determine predictive factors for early recovery.  Results and limitations:   After the initial 132 cases, patients who underwent RARP demonstrated faster recovery of urinary continence compared to RRP patients. Potency recovery was more rapid in the RARP group at all evaluation time points, beginning from the initial cases. In multivariate analysis, younger age and longer preoperative membranous urethral length seen by prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated statistical significance as independent prognostic factors for continence recovery; younger age, surgical method (RARP vs RRP), and higher preoperative serum testosterone were independent prognostic factors for potency recovery. The limitations of the present study were that it was nonrandomized and used interview to evaluate potency recovery.  Conclusions:   Patients after RARP demonstrated superior functional recovery.

We evaluated whether abiraterone acetate, an inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis, prolongs overall survival among patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received chemotherapy.  Methods:   We randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 1195 patients who had previously received docetaxel to receive 5 mg of prednisone twice daily with either 1000 mg of abiraterone acetate (797 patients) or placebo (398 patients). The primary end point was overall survival. The secondary end points included time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (elevation in the PSA level according to prespecified criteria), progression-free survival according to radiologic findings based on prespecified criteria, and the PSA response rate.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 12.8 months, overall survival was longer in the abiraterone acetate-prednisone group than in the placebo-prednisone group (14.8 months vs. 10.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). Data were unblinded at the interim analysis, since these results exceeded the preplanned criteria for study termination. All secondary end points, including time to PSA progression (10.2 vs. 6.6 months; P<0.001), progression-free survival (5.6 months vs. 3.6 months; P<0.001), and PSA response rate (29% vs. 6%, P<0.001), favored the treatment group. Mineralocorticoid-related adverse events, including fluid retention, hypertension, and hypokalemia, were more frequently reported in the abiraterone acetate-prednisone group than in the placebo-prednisone group.

It is frequently refractory to conservative management, but the optimal endoscopic treatment of bleeding secondary to CRCP is still controversial. The efficacy and safety of bipolar eletrocoagulation (BEC) and argon plasma coagulation (APC) in the management of bleeding from CRCP were evaluated and compared.  Patients and methods:   30 patients (mean age 67.4 years) with active and chronic bleeding from telangiectasias, were randomly allocated to BEC or APC and stratified by severity of CRCP according to clinical severity and endoscopic findings (Saunders score). Success was defined as eradication of all telangiectasias, and therapeutic failure as need for more than seven sessions or for other treatment. Complications were categorized as minor (e.g. fever, anal or abdominal pain) or major (hemorrhagic).  Results:   Both treatments were equally effective for the treatment of CRCP rectal bleeding. Only one failure was observed in each group (P = 1.000). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding number of sessions, minor or major complications, or relapse. However, overall complication rate was significantly higher in the BEC group (P = 0.003).  Conclusions:   BEC and APC are both effective for the therapy of bleeding telangiectasias from CRCP. There are probably no major differences between them. Although APC seemed safer than BEC in this investigation, further studies, involving a much larger population, are needed to assess the complication rates and determine the best management option.""","""['L Lenz', 'J Tafarel', 'L Correia', 'D Bonilha', 'M Santos', 'R Rodrigues', 'G Gomes', 'G Andrade', 'F Martins', 'M Monaghan', 'F Nakao', 'E Libera', 'A P Ferrari', 'R Rohr']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Endoscopy""","""['Argon plasma coagulation for radiation proctitis.', 'Argon plasma coagulation for the treatment of hemorrhagic radiation proctitis.', 'Is argon plasma coagulation an efficient treatment for digestive system vascular malformation and radiation proctitis?', 'Endoscopic treatment of chronic radiation proctopathy.', 'Management of radiation proctitis.', 'Colonoscopic and Clinical Features of Colonic Angiodysplasia: A Study in 54 Patients.', 'Quality evaluation of guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of radiation enteritis.', 'Devices for endoscopic hemostasis of nonvariceal GI bleeding (with videos).', 'Assessment of chronic radiation proctopathy and radiofrequency ablation treatment follow-up with optical coherence tomography angiography: A pilot study.', 'Endoscopic and non-endoscopic approaches for the management of radiation-induced rectal bleeding.']"""

The KYL peptide encoded by the most specific phage clone was synthesized, labeled with fluorescein, and assayed in various cell lines. A fusion peptide composed of the KYL peptide and a proapoptotic peptide ( D )(KLAKLAK)(2) was synthesized, and the cell death effect was evaluated on different cells.

Identification of the molecular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and elucidation of its crosstalk with tumor cells may therefore be crucial for improving our understanding of the processes implicated in cancer progression, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and uncovering stromal gene expression signatures that may predict clinical outcome. A key issue to resolve, therefore, is whether the stromal response to tumor growth is largely a generic phenomenon, irrespective of the tumor type or whether the response reflects tumor-specific properties. To address similarity or distinction of stromal gene expression changes during cancer progression, oligonucleotide-based Affymetrix microarray technology was used to compare the transcriptomes of laser-microdissected stromal cells derived from invasive human breast and prostate carcinoma. Invasive breast and prostate cancer-associated stroma was observed to display distinct transcriptomes, with a limited number of shared genes. Interestingly, both breast and prostate tumor-specific dysregulated stromal genes were observed to cluster breast and prostate cancer patients, respectively, into two distinct groups with statistically different clinical outcomes. By contrast, a gene signature that was common to the reactive stroma of both tumor types did not have survival predictive value. Univariate Cox analysis identified genes whose expression level was most strongly associated with patient survival. Taken together, these observations suggest that the tumor microenvironment displays distinct features according to the tumor type that provides survival-predictive value.""","""['Anne Planche', 'Marina Bacac', 'Paolo Provero', 'Carlo Fusco', 'Mauro Delorenzi', 'Jean-Christophe Stehle', 'Ivan Stamenkovic']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A mouse stromal response to tumor invasion predicts prostate and breast cancer patient survival.', 'Prognostic stromal gene signatures in breast cancer.', 'Stromal responses among common carcinomas correlated with clinicopathologic features.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Stromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancer.', 'Differential translation of mRNA isoforms underlies oncogenic activation of cell cycle kinase Aurora A.', 'What is new in cancer-associated fibroblast biomarkers?', 'FASN multi-omic characterization reveals metabolic heterogeneity in pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Identifying General Tumor and Specific Lung Cancer Biomarkers by Transcriptomic Analysis.', 'Prostate Cancer Secretome and Membrane Proteome from Pten Conditional Knockout Mice Identify Potential Biomarkers for Disease Progression.']"""

Materials and methods:   This prospective study was approved by the local research ethics committee, and all patients gave written informed consent. A total of 29 patients (mean age, 69.1 years; range, 56-80 years) with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent a DCE-CT examination prior to radiation therapy. TKM parameter maps were calculated for each patient with the Tofts, extended Tofts, and AATH models. For each voxel, corrected Akaike information criterion values were calculated, taking into account both the goodness-of-fit and the number of model parameters. We consider the optimal model as the model with the lowest corrected Akaike information criterion.  Results:   All 3 TKMs are the optimal models in part of the prostate. For individual patients, the AATH model was the optimal model in 25.0% to 88.9%, the Tofts in 2.7% to 71.8%, and the extended Tofts model in 0.7% to 68.7% of the prostate voxels. The Tofts model was optimal in low flow regions (<0.1 min-1), the extended Tofts model in regions with high flow (>0.4 min-1) and low transit time (<12 seconds), and the AATH model in the intermediate flow range (0.1-0.4 min-1). However, differences between the 3 models were small and TKM parameter estimates gave consistent results between the 3 models.  Conclusions:   All the 3 models gave reasonable fits of DCE-CT data from the prostate. In view of the small parameter range in which the Tofts and extended Tofts models outperform the AATH model, the latter seems the optimal model for quantification of DCE-CT data of the prostate.""","""['Johannes G Korporaal', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Cornelis A T van den Berg', 'Uulke A van der Heide']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT for prostate cancer: relationship between image noise, voxel size, and repeatability.', 'Optimized Fast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate: Effect of Sampling Duration on Pharmacokinetic Parameters.', 'Variations of quantitative perfusion measurement on dynamic contrast enhanced CT for colorectal cancer: implication of standardized image protocol.', 'Dual-input tracer kinetic modeling of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in thoracic malignancies.', 'Tracer-kinetic modeling of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and CT: a primer.', '4D perfusion CT of prostate cancer for image-guided radiotherapy planning: A proof of concept study.', 'Assessment of prostate cancer with integrated CT-perfusion using a sector-wise approach.', 'Comparison of linear and nonlinear implementation of the compartmental tissue uptake model for dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.', 'Quantitative graphical analysis of simultaneous dynamic PET/MRI for assessment of prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of tumor heterogeneity using dynamic contrast enhanced CT and FDG-PET in non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

Methods:   Total PSA (tPSA) and free PSA were measured in 780 biopsy-referred men with 5 different assays. These data, together with other clinical parameters, were applied to 5 published nomograms that are used for PCa detection. Discrimination and calibration criteria were used to characterize the accuracy of the nomogram models under these conditions.  Results:   PCa was found in 455 men (58.3%), and 325 men had no evidence of malignancy. Median tPSA concentrations ranged from 5.5 μg/L to 7.04 μg/L, whereas the median percentage of free PSA ranged from 10.6% to 16.4%. Both the calibration and discrimination of the nomograms varied significantly across different types of PSA assays. Median PCa probabilities, which indicate PCa risk, ranged from 0.59 to 0.76 when different PSA assays were used within the same nomogram. On the other hand, various nomograms produced different PCa probabilities when the same PSA assay was used. Although the ROC curves had comparable areas under the ROC curve, considerable differences were observed among the 5 assays when the sensitivities and specificities at various PCa probability cutoffs were analyzed.  Conclusions:   The accuracy of the PCa probabilities predicted according to different nomograms is limited by the lack of agreement between the different PSA assays. This difference between methods may lead to unacceptable variation in PCa risk prediction.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine vigorous activity, nonvigorous activity, walking duration, and walking pace after diagnosis and risk of prostate cancer progression. We observed 117 events (45 biochemical recurrences, 66 secondary treatments, 3 bone metastases, 3 prostate cancer deaths) during 2,750 person-years. Walking accounted for nearly half of all activity. Men who walked briskly for 3 h/wk or more had a 57% lower rate of progression than men who walked at an easy pace for less than 3 h/wk (HR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.21-0.91; P = 0.03). Walking pace was associated with decreased risk of progression independent of duration (HR brisk vs. easy pace = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29-0.91; P(trend) = 0.01). Few men engaged in vigorous activity, but there was a suggestive inverse association (HR ≥3 h/wk vs. none = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.32-1.23; P(trend) = 0.17). Walking duration and total nonvigorous activity were not associated with risk of progression independent of pace or vigorous activity, respectively.

Water contaminated with hexavalent chromium is a worldwide problem, making this a question of significant public health importance.  Methods:   We conducted an ecological mortality study within the Oinofita region of Greece, where water has been contaminated with hexavalent chromium. We calculated gender, age, and period standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for all deaths, cancer deaths, and specific cancer types of Oinofita residents over an 11-year period (1999 - 2009), using the greater prefecture of Voiotia as the standard population.  Results:   A total of 474 deaths were observed. The SMR for all cause mortality was 98 (95% CI 89-107) and for all cancer mortality 114 (95% CI 94-136). The SMR for primary liver cancer was 1104 (95% CI 405-2403, p-value < 0.001). Furthermore, statistically significantly higher SMRs were identified for lung cancer (SMR = 145, 95% CI 100-203, p-value = 0.047) and cancer of the kidney and other genitourinary organs among women (SMR = 368, 95% CI 119-858, p-value = 0.025). Elevated SMRs for several other cancers were also noted (lip, oral cavity and pharynx 344, stomach 121, female breast 134, prostate 128, and leukaemias 168), but these did not reach statistical significance.  Conclusions:   Elevated cancer mortality in the Oinofita area of Greece supports the hypothesis of hexavalent chromium carcinogenicity via the oral ingestion pathway of exposure.

These nanobodies bind to the HER2 antigen which is highly expressed on breast and ovarian cancer cells. Flow cytometric analysis and dark field images of HER2 positive SKOV3 cells incubated with anti-HER2 conjugated branched gold nanoparticles show specific cell targeting.

In fact, only the two end chain groups of PEG can be modified and exploited for drug coupling. We have demonstrated that by synthesizing a dendrimer structure at the polymer end chains, it is possible to increase the drug payload and overcome this limitation. Furthermore, this approach can be improved by using heterobifunctional PEG. These polymers allow the precise linking of two different drugs, or a drug and a targeting agent, on the same polymeric chain. Heterobifunctional PEG-dendrimers have been obtained with defined chemical structures leading to their attractive use as drug delivery systems. In fact, they offer a double benefit; first, the possibility to choose the best drug/targeting agent ratio, and second, the separation of the two functions, activity and targeting, which are coupled at the opposite polymer end chains. In this study, we investigated the role of a PEG-dendrimer, H(2)N-PEG-dendrimer-(COOH)(4), as carrier for a combination of paclitaxel (PTX) and alendronate (ALN). PTX is a potent anticancer drug that is affected by severe side effects originating from both the drug itself and its solubilizing formulation, Cremophor EL. ALN is an aminobiphosphonate used for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone metastases as well as a bone-targeting moiety. The PTX-PEG-ALN conjugate was designed to exploit active targeting by the ALN molecule and passive targeting through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Our conjugate demonstrated a great binding affinity to the bone mineral hydroxyapatite in vitro and an IC(50) comparable to that of the free drugs combination in human adenocarcinoma of the prostate (PC3) cells. The PTX-PEG-ALN conjugate exhibited an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared with the free drugs owed to the marked increase in their half-life. In addition, PTX-PEG-ALN could be solubilized directly in physiological solutions without the need for Cremophor EL. The data presented in this manuscript encourage further investigations on the potential of PTX-PEG-ALN as treatment for cancer bone metastases.""","""['Chiara Clementi', 'Keren Miller', 'Anna Mero', 'Ronit Satchi-Fainaro', 'Gianfranco Pasut']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Poly(ethylene glycol)-paclitaxel-alendronate self-assembled micelles for the targeted treatment of breast cancer bone metastases.', 'Antiangiogenic antitumor activity of HPMA copolymer-paclitaxel-alendronate conjugate on breast cancer bone metastasis mouse model.', 'Self-aggregated pegylated poly (trimethylene carbonate) nanoparticles decorated with c(RGDyK) peptide for targeted paclitaxel delivery to integrin-rich tumors.', 'Development of self-immolative dendrimers for drug delivery and sensing.', 'Clinical impact of serum proteins on drug delivery.', 'Brief review: Applications of nanocomposite in electrochemical sensor and drugs delivery.', 'A technical note on emerging combination approach involved in the onconanotherapeutics.', 'Emerging concepts in designing next-generation multifunctional nanomedicine for cancer treatment.', 'Craft of Co-encapsulation in Nanomedicine: A Struggle To Achieve Synergy through Reciprocity.', 'Developing Actively Targeted Nanoparticles to Fight Cancer: Focus on Italian Research.']"""

Recently, TMPRSS2:ERG gene rearrangement was found to be highly specific for and detected in approximately 50% of prostate cancer. Positive immunohistochemical staining with a novel anti-ERG antibody highly correlated with TMPRSS2:ERG gene rearrangement status. We developed a double immunohistochemical staining containing both erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogen (ERG) and basal cell marker P63 antibodies and evaluated its use in the diagnosis of limited cancer in prostate needle biopsies. A total of 77 prostate needle biopsies containing cancer occupying <1 mm of the length of only 1 core of the entire biopsy set were stained with the double stain containing ERG and P63 antibodies. ERG positivity and its staining intensity in cancerous and other noncancerous lesions were evaluated. ERG expression was detected in 42% (32 of 77) of cases, with strong, moderate, and weak staining intensity in 72%, 16%, and 12% of cases. The staining was uniform in 84% of cases and heterogeneous in 16% of cases with different staining intensities in >10% of cancerous cells. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was present in 17 cases, and in 5 (29%) cases ERG was positive in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia glands, which were all immediately adjacent to or intermingled with ERG-positive cancerous glands. In 4 additional cases, positive ERG staining was found in morphologically benign glands, which were also immediately adjacent to or intermingled with ERG-positive cancerous glands. All other benign lesions distant from cancerous glands, including simple and partial atrophy, were negative for ERG. P63 was negative in all cancerous glands and positive in noncancerous lesions. The P63/ERG double immunostain combines the high sensitivity of P63 and the high specificity of ERG and may be potentially useful in the work-up of difficult prostate biopsies. The high specificity of ERG for the presence of cancer may have important implications for prostate biopsy interpretation and needs to be further validated in larger prospective studies.""","""['Oksana Yaskiv', 'Xiaochun Zhang', 'Kelly Simmerman', 'Tom Daly', 'Huiying He', 'Sara Falzarano', 'Longwen Chen', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Ming Zhou']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['The diagnostic utility of novel immunohistochemical marker ERG in the workup of prostate biopsies with ""atypical glands suspicious for cancer"".', 'Antibody-based detection of ERG rearrangements in prostate core biopsies, including diagnostically challenging cases: ERG staining in prostate core biopsies.', 'Expression of ERG protein, a prostate cancer specific marker, in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): lack of utility to stratify cancer risks associated with HGPIN.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Diagnostic utility of immunohistochemical markers alpha methyl acyl coA racemase (AMACR) and Ets related gene (ERG) in prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of ERG Expression in Prostate Adenocarcinoma and Its Prognostic Impact in Patients Survival Rate.', 'Use of dual-marker staining to differentiate between lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.', 'ERG expression in prostate cancer biopsies with and without high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: a study in Jordanian Arab patients.', 'Correlation between ERG Fusion Protein and Androgen Receptor Expression by Immunohistochemistry in Prostate, Possible Role in Diagnosis and Therapy.']"""

The expression levels of NDRG2 and c-Myc in prostate cell lines were detected through Western blot. The effects of adenovirus-mediated NDRG2 on PC3 cells and PC3 nude mouse xenografts was observed through cell growth curves, tumor growth curves, flow cytometry (FCM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and TUNEL staining. The NDRG2 gene was highly expressed in BPH tissues, but not in carcinomatous ones (χ(2)=25.98, p < 0.001). Furthermore, positive expression of NDRG2 was negatively correlated with the Gleason score (r = -0.445, p< 0.001) and the c-myc level (r = -0.311, p < 0.001). However, positive expression of NDRG2 was not correlated with pTNM tumor stages or the serum concentration of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (p > 0.05). The expression of the NDRG2 genes was low in the three PCA cell lines. PC3 cells infected by pAD-cmv-NDRG2 showed inhibition of proliferation both in vitro and vivo. To sum up, NDRG2 may be involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of PCA. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated NDRG2 can suppress the proliferation of PC3 cells significantly both in vitro and in vivo.

Furthermore, a germ line polymorphism in the FGFR-4 gene, resulting in arginine at codon 388 (Arg³⁸⁸) instead of glycine (Gly³⁸⁸), is associated with aggressive disease. The FGFR-4 Arg³⁸⁸ variant results in increased receptor stability, sustained receptor activation, and increased motility and invasion compared with Gly³⁸⁸. However, the impact of sustained signaling on cellular signal transduction pathways is unknown.  Experimental design:   Expression microarray analysis of immortalized prostatic epithelial cells lines expressing FGFR-4 Arg³⁸⁸ or Gly³⁸⁸ was used to establish a gene signature associated with FGFR-4 Arg³⁸⁸ expression. Transient transfection of reporters and inhibitors was used to establish the pathways activated by FGFR-4 Arg³⁸⁸ expression. The impact of pathway knockdown in vitro and in an orthotopic model was assessed using inhibitors and/or short hairpin RNA (shRNA).  Results:   Expression of the FGFR-4 Arg³⁸⁸ protein leads to increased activity of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, increased activity of serum response factor (SRF) and AP1, and transcription of multiple genes that are correlated with aggressive clinical behavior in PCa. Increased expression of SRF is associated with biochemical recurrence in men undergoing radical prostatectomy. Consistent with these observations, knockdown of FGFR-4 Arg³⁸⁸ in PCa cells decreases proliferation and invasion in vitro and primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.  Conclusions:   These studies define a signal transduction pathway downstream of FGFR-4 Arg³⁸⁸ that acts via ERK and SRF to promote PCa progression.""","""['Wendong Yu', 'Shu Feng', 'Olga Dakhova', 'Chad J Creighton', 'Yi Cai', 'Jianghua Wang', 'Rile Li', 'Anna Frolov', 'Gustavo Ayala', 'Michael Ittmann']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Targeting fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling inhibits prostate cancer progression.', 'The fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 Arg388 allele is associated with prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Altered fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 stability promotes prostate cancer progression.', 'Increased expression of the metastasis-associated gene Ehm2 in prostate cancer.', 'The role of fibroblast growth factors and their receptors in prostate cancer.', 'An updated meta-analysis of the association between fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 polymorphisms and susceptibility to cancer.', 'FGFR4 Gly388Arg Polymorphism Affects the Progression of Gastric Cancer by Activating STAT3 Pathway to Induce Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Protein Kinase N1 control of androgen-responsive serum response factor action provides rationale for novel prostate cancer treatment strategy.', 'Fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling plays a key role in transformation induced by the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene and decreased PTEN.', 'The FGFR4-388arg Variant Promotes Lung Cancer Progression by N-Cadherin Induction.']"""

It is well established that GSTp downregulation is through DNA methylation-based silencing. We report here that maspin expression in prostate cancer cell line DU145 reversed GSTp DNA methylation, as measured by methylation- specific PCR, MethyLight assay, and bisulfite sequencing. The effect of maspin on GSTp expression was similar to that of the combination of a synthetic histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Maspin expression also led to an increased level of acetylated histone 3, decreased level of methyl transferase, and methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins at the site of demethylated GSTp promoter DNA. Earlier, we have shown that maspin inhibits HDAC1. In PC3 cells, where both maspin and GSTp are expressed at a reduced level, maspin knockdown led to a significant reduction in GSTp expression, whereas dual knockdown of maspin and HDAC1 barely increased the level of GSTp expression. Thus, HDAC1 may play an essential role in cellular response to maspin-mediated GSTp desilencing. Maspin has been shown to increase tumor cell sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, GSTp reexpression in the absence of maspin expression perturbation blocked the phosphorylation of histone 2A.X, the induction of hypoxia-induced factor 1α (HIF-1α), and cell death of LNCaP cells under oxidative stress. Because DNA hypermethylation-based silencing may couple with and depend on histone deacetylation, our study suggests that endogenous HDAC inhibition by maspin may prevent pathologic gene silencing in prostate tumor progression.""","""['Xiaohua Li', 'Alexander Kaplun', 'Fulvio Lonardo', 'Elisabeth Heath', 'Fazlul H Sarkar', 'Jonathan Irish', 'Wael Sakr', 'Shijie Sheng']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Role of class I histone deacetylases in the regulation of maspin expression in prostate cancer.', 'Endogenous inhibition of histone deacetylase 1 by tumor-suppressive maspin.', 'Cytosine methylation represses glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) gene expression in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor suppressor maspin as a rheostat in HDAC regulation to achieve the fine-tuning of epithelial homeostasis.', 'The natural tumor suppressor protein maspin and potential application in non small cell lung cancer.', 'Integrating the tumor-suppressive activity of Maspin with p53 in retuning the epithelial homeostasis: A working hypothesis and applicable prospects.', 'The vulnerable primed cancer stem cells in disguise: demystifying the role of Maspin.', ""The Differential Antitumor Activity of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine in Prostate Cancer DU145, 22RV1, and LNCaP Cells."", 'Tumor Suppressive Maspin-Sensitized Prostate Cancer to Drug Treatment Through Negative Regulating Androgen Receptor Expression.', 'Role of class I histone deacetylases in the regulation of maspin expression in prostate cancer.']"""

Using multiple techniques such as MTT, Histone-DNA ELISA, activated caspase assays, clonogenic assays and EMSA, we investigated the mechanism of apoptosis-inducing effect of garcinol in prostate (LNCaP, C4-2B and PC3) and pancreatic (BxPC-3) cancer cells. We found that garcinol inhibited cell growth of all the cell lines tested with a concomitant induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Down-regulation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway appears to be the mechanism of apoptosis-induction because garcinol inhibited constitutive levels of NF-betaB activity, which was consistent with down-regulation of NF-betaB-regulated genes. A significant decrease in the colony forming ability of all the cell lines was also observed, suggesting the possible application of this compound against metastatic disease.

Objective:   To evaluate familial risks for renal cell carcinomas (RCC) through parental and sibling probands in the largest available dataset.  Design, setting, and participants:   This study examined the Swedish Family-Cancer Database on 12.2 million individuals, which contains families with parents and offspring. Cancer data were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry for the years 1961-2008, including 8513 patients with RCC.  Measurements:   Familial risk for offspring was defined through standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and adjusted for many variables, including a proxy for smoking and obesity.  Results and limitations:   The familial risk for RCCs was 1.75 when a parent and 2.61 when a sibling was diagnosed with any kidney cancer. Also, RCCs were shown to be associated with prostate cancer (PCa) when parents or parents and siblings were diagnosed with PCa. Among siblings, the associations of RCC with melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and urinary bladder and papillary thyroid tumours were found. None of the results differed significantly after excluding the families with cancer pathognomonic of a von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Limitations of this study include the small number of familial cases (229 familial cases).  Conclusions:   The present analysis showed a high familiarity for RCC, and recessive effects may be important for familial aggregation of RCC. As a novel association, offspring RCC was in excess when parents or parents and siblings were diagnosed with PCa.

Methods:   QOL questionnaires were sent at specified intervals to 95 men who received proton radiation. Of these, 87 men reported 3- and/or 12-month outcomes, whereas 73 also reported long-term outcomes (minimum 2 years). Symptom scores were calculated at baseline, 3 months, 12 months, and long-term follow-up. Generalized estimating equation models were constructed to assess longitudinal outcomes while accounting for correlation among repeated measures in an individual patient. Men were stratified into functional groups from their baseline questionnaires (normal, intermediate, or poor function) for each symptom domain. Long-term QOL changes were assessed overall and within functional groups using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  Results:   Statistically significant changes in all four symptom scores were observed in the longitudinal analysis. For the 73 men reporting long-term outcomes, there were significant change scores for incontinence (ID), bowel (BD) and sexual dysfunction (SD), but not obstructive/irritative voiding dysfunction (OID). When stratified by baseline functional category, only men with normal function had increased scores for ID and BD. For SD, there were significant changes in men with both normal and intermediate function, but not poor function.  Conclusions:   Patient reported outcomes are sensitive indicators of treatment-related morbidity. These results quantitate the long-term consequences of proton monotherapy for prostate cancer.

Here, we investigated the effects of imaging dose and the necessity for additional optimization when using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to treat prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   An arc beam mimicking MV-CBCT was generated using XiO (version 4.50; Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden). The monitor units (MU) for dose calculation were determined by conforming the calculated dose to the dose measured using an ionization chamber. IMRT treatment plans of 22 patients with prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed. Arc beams of 3, 5, 8, and 15 MU were added to the IMRT plans, and the dose covering 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) was normalized to the prescribed dose with (reoptimization) or without optimization (compensation).  Results:   PTV homogeneity and conformality changed negligibly with MV-CBCT integration. For critical organs, an imaging dose-dependent increase was observed for the mean rectal/bladder dose (D(mean)), and reoptimization effectively suppressed the D(mean) elevations. The bladder generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) increased with imaging dose, and reoptimization suppressed the gEUD elevation when 5- to 15-MU CBCT were added, although rectal gEUD changed negligibly with any imaging dose. Whereas the dose elevation from the simple addition of the imaging dose uniformly increased rectal and bladder dose, the rectal D(mean) increase of compensation plans was due mainly to low-dose volumes. In contrast, bladder high-dose volumes were increased by integrating the CBCT dose, and reoptimization reduced them when 5- to 15-MU CBCT were added.  Conclusion:   Reoptimization is clearly beneficial for reducing dose to critical organs, elevated by addition of high-MU CBCT, especially for the bladder. For low-MU CBCT aimed at bony structure visualization, compensation is sufficient.""","""['Yuichi Akino', 'Masahiko Koizumi', 'Iori Sumida', 'Yutaka Takahashi', 'Toshiyuki Ogata', 'Seiichi Ota', 'Fumiaki Isohashi', 'Koji Konishi', 'Yasuo Yoshioka']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Testicular doses in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Relationship between pelvic organ-at-risk dose and clinical target volume in postprostatectomy patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Doses delivered by portal imaging quality assurance in routine practice of adjuvant breast radiotherapy worth to by monitored and compensated in some cases.', 'A Preliminary Simulation Study of Dose-Guided Adaptive Radiotherapy Based on Halcyon MV Cone-Beam CT Images With Retrospective Data From a Phase II Clinical Trial.', 'Dose tracking assessment for image-guided radiotherapy of the prostate bed and the impact on clinical workflow.', 'Influence of daily imaging on plan quality and normal tissue toxicity for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', ""Correlation between patients' anatomical characteristics and interfractional internal prostate motion during intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.""]"""

However, the impact of active assistant/surgeon neurovascular bundle (NVB) countertraction on sexual function outcomes has not been studied or quantified.  Objective:   To illustrate technique and compare sexual function outcomes for nerve sparing without (NS-0C) versus with (NS-C) assistant and/or surgeon NVB countertraction.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a retrospective study of 342 NS-0C versus 268 NS-C RARP procedures performed between August 2008 and February 2011.  Surgical procedure:   RARP.  Measurements:   We used the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) sexual function and potency scores, estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time, and positive surgical margin (PSM).  Results and limitations:   In unadjusted analysis, men undergoing NS-0C versus NS-C were older, had worse baseline sexual function, higher biopsy and pathologic Gleason grade, and higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (all p ≤ 0.023). However, NS-0C versus NS-C was associated with higher 5-mo sexual function scores (20 vs 10; p < 0.001), and this difference was accentuated for bilateral intrafascial nerve sparing in preoperatively potent men (35.8 vs 16.6; p < 0.001). Similarly, 5-mo potency for preoperatively potent men was better with bilateral intrafascial NS-0C versus NS-C (45.0% vs 28.4%; p = 0.039). However, no difference in sexual function or potency was observed at 12 mo. In adjusted analyses, NS-0C versus NS-C was associated with improved 5-mo sexual function (parameter estimate: 10.90; standard error: 2.16; p < 0.001) and potency (odds ratio: 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.83; p = 0.046). NS-0C versus NS-WC was associated with shorter operative times (p = 0.001) and higher EBL (p = 0.001); however, there were no significant differences in PSM. Limitations include the retrospective, single-surgeon study design and smaller numbers for 12-mo comparison.

In addition, NPY receptors are expressed in neuroendocrine tumors, breast cancer, prostate cancer, kidney cancer, and some types of sarcomas. Different neuropeptides, particularly α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of melanoma.  Objective:   We sought to analyze the expression of NPY in cutaneous melanoma, its association with clinical and histologic features, and its correlation with α-MSH.  Methods:   This was an observational study of the immunohistochemical expression of NPY and α-MSH in tissue samples of cutaneous melanomas, different types of melanocytic nevi, and melanoma metastases diagnosed from 2004 to 2008 in San Jorge Hospital, Huesca, Spain.  Results:   A total of 184 lesions were studied: 49 primary cutaneous melanomas, 12 melanoma metastases (9 cutaneous and 3 lymphatic), and 123 melanocytic nevi. Immunostaining revealed that levels of NPY and α-MSH were significantly higher in melanomas than in melanocytic nevi (P < .001). Melanoma metastases were negative for both neuropeptides. Nodular melanomas showed the highest median percentage of NPY positive cells (75% [20-95]) followed by superficial spreading melanoma (25% [2-92]), whereas lentigo maligna were negative (0% [0-0]). Significant, direct associations between NPY expression and vertical growth (P = .0141) and presence of metastasis (P = .0196) were observed. NPY and α-MSH were positively correlated in cutaneous melanoma (0.49, P < .001).  Limitations:   The sample size of melanomas was not very large.  Conclusion:   Our study demonstrates that NPY is significantly expressed in melanomas, especially the nodular type, being associated with invasiveness independently of proliferative markers such as thickness, ulceration, and mitotic index.""","""['Yolanda Gilaberte', 'M Jose Roca', 'M Dolores Garcia-Prats', 'Carmen Coscojuela', 'M Dolores Arbues', 'Jesús J Vera-Alvarez']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Am Acad Dermatol""","""['Expression of galanin in melanocytic tumors.', 'Apolipoprotein D expression in cutaneous malignant melanoma.', 'Cdc7 expression in melanomas, Spitz tumors and melanocytic nevi.', 'The developmental biology of primary human malignant melanomas.', 'TIMPs expression in lentigo maligna÷lentigo maligna melanoma versus aged skin - a review of the literature and personal experience.', 'Current Insights Into the Role of Neuropeptide Y in Skin Physiology and Pathology.', 'Neuroendocrine Factors in Melanoma Pathogenesis.', 'scConnect: a method for exploratory analysis of cell-cell communication based on single-cell RNA-sequencing data.', ""Neuropeptides Profile and Increased Innervation in Becker's Nevus."", 'Neuropeptide Y (NPY) in tumor growth and progression: Lessons learned from pediatric oncology.']"""

Results:   During this study period, the overall utilisation rate of EBRT remained stable at around 25%, while the rate of BT for non-metastasized patients increased from 1% (95% CI:0-1%) to 12% (11-13%) in 2006 and slightly decreased towards 10% (9-11%) in 2008. From 2001 on, the overall utilisation rate of EBRT decreased significantly in one region (p<0.05). In this region, a sharp rise in the utilisation rate of BT for non-metastatic patients was noted to 17% (14-20%) in 2008 after a peak of 24% (21-27%) in 2006. For localised disease, BT was used more often at the expense of EBRT while for locally advanced disease the utilisation rate of EBRT increased. In the multivariate analysis, regional differences in the utilisation rate of EBRT persisted with odds ratios ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 compared to the reference region. Moreover, low rates of EBRT were associated with high BT rates. The regional differences could not be explained by differences in risk profiles.  Conclusions:   The utilisation rate of EBRT remained stable with limited variation between regions while BT was used increasingly with clear regional differences.

It is now possible to deliver intensity modulated neutron radiotherapy (IMNRT). The present work compares photon IMRT, 3D-CNRT and IMNRT for three prostate patients to quantify the benefits of IMNRT.  Materials and methods:   We compare updated 3D-CNRT plans, IMNRT plans, and conventional IMRT plans by translating neutron DVHs into effective photon DVHs using the dose dependent radiobiological effectiveness (RBE) for each structure. RBE curves are parameterized for a range of normal tissue and prostate tumor values. Generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) and gEUD in 2Gy fractions (gEUD(2)) is calculated for each structure, plan, and parameterization. Rectal sparing and dose to prostate-GTV are compared for 3D-CNRT, IMNRT, and IMRT as a function of normal tissue and prostate RBE.  Results:   The closer the RBE values of prostate tumor and normal tissue, the greater the advantage of IMNRT over 3D-CNRT. The rectal sparing achieved using IMNRT ranged from ∼5% to 13% depending upon the choice of RBE for rectum and the α/β value of prostate tumor. IMNRT may provide a theoretical dose advantage over photon IMRT if the α/β value of prostate is 1.5 and the RBEs of prostate and rectum differ by more than 5%. For higher values of prostate α/β any advantages of IMNRT over IMRT could require that the RBEs of prostate and rectum differ by as much as 20%.  Conclusions:   IMNRT provides a clear normal tissue sparing advantage over 3D-CNRT. The advantage increases when the RBEs of the target structure and the normal tissue are similar. This RBE translation method could help identify clinical sites where the dose sparing advantages of IMNRT would allow for the exploitation of the radiobiological advantages of high-LET neutron radiotherapy.""","""['Michael Snyder', 'Michael C Joiner', 'Andre Konski', 'Todd Bossenberger', 'Jay Burmeister']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Dosimetry and radiobiologic model comparison of IMRT and 3D conformal radiotherapy in treatment of carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Persistently better treatment planning results of intensity-modulated (IMRT) over conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in prostate cancer patients with significant variation of clinical target volume and/or organs-at-risk.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiologic comparison of 3D conformal versus intensity modulated planning techniques for prostate bed radiotherapy.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Benefit of intensity modulated and image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Comparisons of 3-Dimensional Conformal and Intensity-Modulated Neutron Therapy for Head and Neck Cancers.', 'Clinical Radiobiology of Fast Neutron Therapy: What Was Learnt?']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the PCA3 response in these situations.  Patients and methods:   In 15 consecutive men undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the prostate and who gave their informed consent, urinary PCA3 was determined twice: at a first consultation, urine being sampled immediately after an attentive DRE and second within 2 hours after the biopsy. The mean interval between the two samplings was 14 days (median 15). PCA3 measurements were centralized and performed by the same biologist. At least twelve cores were taken using a biopsy gun with an 18-gauge needle. Changes in PCA3 levels were studied.  Results:   Mean age of the 15 men was 67.3 years (range 50.9-79.1). Mean (median) pre-biopsy total and %free PSA were respectively 6.6 ng/ml (5.7) and 15.8% (15.5). Mean prostate volume was 43.6 cm(3). Seven patients complained of mild LUTS. DRE was suspicious in eight patients. Of the 15 men, 6 (40%) had adenocarcinoma on biopsy (all clinically confined to the prostate). Median (range) Gleason score was 6 (6-7). Median PCA3 score (range) before and after prostatic biopsy were respectively 36 (9-287) and 27 (5-287) with no significant difference between the two groups (sign test for matched series p > 0.05). The median variation between pre- and post-biopsy PCA3 was -18%. When considering a PCA3 cut-off of 35, two patients changed group: one patient had 51 before and 31 after (PSA 4.6; no cancer on prostate biopsy) and the second had 36 before and 27 after (PSA 5.6; low-risk PCa). The figure represents the PCA3 values for each case (squares for the pre-biopsy and diamonds for the post-biopsy).

The study of MF has been expanded to the field of oncology; yet it remains unclear whether the expression of PR is required for MF to act as an anti-cancer agent. Our laboratory has shown that MF is a potent inhibitor of ovarian cancer cell growth. In this study we questioned whether the growth inhibitory properties of MF observed in ovarian cancer cells would translate to other cancers of reproductive and non-reproductive origin and, importantly, whether its efficacy is related to the expression of cognate PR.  Methods:   Dose-response experiments were conducted with cancer cell lines of the nervous system, breast, prostate, ovary, and bone. Cultures were exposed to vehicle or increasing concentrations of MF for 72 h and analysed for cell number and cell cycle traverse, and hypodiploid DNA content characteristic of apoptotic cell death. For all cell lines, expression of steroid hormone receptors upon treatment with vehicle or cytostatic doses of MF for 24 h was studied by Western blot, whereas the activity of the G1/S regulatory protein Cdk2 in both treatment groups was monitored in vitro by the capacity of Cdk2 to phosphorylate histone H1.  Results:   MF growth inhibited all cancer cell lines regardless of tissue of origin and hormone responsiveness, and reduced the activity of Cdk2. Cancer cells in which MF induced G1 growth arrest were less susceptible to lethality in the presence of high concentrations of MF, when compared to cancer cells that did not accumulate in G1. While all cancer cell lines were growth inhibited by MF, only the breast cancer MCF-7 cells expressed cognate PR.  Conclusions:   Antiprogestin MF inhibits the growth of different cancer cell lines with a cytostatic effect at lower concentrations in association with a decline in the activity of the cell cycle regulatory protein Cdk2, and apoptotic lethality at higher doses in association with increased hypodiploid DNA content. Contrary to common opinion, growth inhibition of cancer cells by antiprogestin MF is not dependent upon expression of classical, nuclear PR.""","""['Chelsea R Tieszen', 'Alicia A Goyeneche', 'BreeAnn N Brandhagen', 'Casey T Ortbahn', 'Carlos M Telleria']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Response of human ovarian carcinoma cell lines to antiprogestin mifepristone.', 'Mifepristone induces growth arrest, caspase activation, and apoptosis of estrogen receptor-expressing, antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells.', 'Growth inhibition induced by antiprogestins RU-38486, ORG-31710, and CDB-2914 in ovarian cancer cells involves inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase 2.', 'Reproductive epidemiology of glial tumors may reveal novel treatments: high-dose progestins or progesterone antagonists as endocrino-immune modifiers against glioma.', 'Hormonal regulation and localization of estrogen, progestin and androgen receptors in the endometrium of nonhuman primates: effects of progesterone receptor antagonists.', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor and Ovarian Cancer: From Biology to Therapeutic Intervention.', 'Membrane Progesterone Receptors (mPRs/PAQRs) Are Going beyond Its Initial Definitions.', 'The metastatic capacity of high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells changes along disease progression: inhibition by mifepristone.', 'CmPn signaling networks in the tumorigenesis of breast cancer.', 'StackPR is a new computational approach for large-scale identification of progesterone receptor antagonists using the stacking strategy.']"""

We built PRS from lists of genetic markers prioritized by their association with breast cancer (BCa) or prostate cancer (PCa) in a training data set and evaluated whether these scores could improve current genetic prediction of these specific cancers in independent test samples.

Fenofibrate inhibited the motility of DU-145 cells and attenuated gap junctional intercellular coupling in a manner independent of its effects on cell viability, PPARα activation and cell membrane micro-viscosity. Instead, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, restored cell motility and gap junctional coupling in fenofibrate-treated DU-145 cell populations. These data indicate that two parameters crucial for cancer cell metastatic potential, i.e. cell motility and gap junctional coupling, are inhibited by fenofibrate.

Thus, GCS becomes a potential target to reverse drug resistance; however, little is known about GCS expression levels in normal tissues and whether GCS overexpression is associated with metastatic cancers. Herewith, we report our studies in GCS expression levels and breast cancer from patients. GCS levels were analyzed using cancer profiling arrays, breast cancer histo-arrays and quantitative RT-PCR in tumor tissues. We found that breast (18 exp. index) and other hormone-dependent organs (testis, cervix, ovary, prostate) displayed the lowest levels of GCS mRNA, whereas liver (52 exp. index) and other organs (kidney, bladder, stomach) displayed the highest levels of GCS. GCS mRNA levels were significantly elevated in tumors of breast, cervix, rectum and small intestine, as compared to each paired normal tissue. In mammary tissue, GCS overexpression was detected in breast cancers with metastasis, but not in benign fibroadenoma or primary tumors. GCS overexpression was coincident with HER2 expression (γ2=0.84) in ER-negative breast adenocarcinoma. In tumor specimens, GCS mRNA was elevated by 4-fold and significantly associated with stage III (5/7), lymph node-positive (7/8) and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers (7/9). GCS expression was significantly and selectively elevated in breast cancer, in particular in metastatic disease. GCS overexpression was highly associated with ER-positive and HER2-positive breast cancer with metastasis.

Overexpression of EGR-1 was found to induce nuclear expression of both, NF-κB and AP1. However, the intensity of the induced AP-1 and NF-κB was diminished after cisplatin treatment, but not after TPA. Our findings confirm that the overexpression of wild-type Egr-1 caused a marked increase in cell proliferation in PC-3 and LNCaP proliferation in a 14-day soft agar colony forming assay. In addition, luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the transcriptional activity of AP-1 and NF-κB in PC-3 and LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell lines was also modulated by the overexpression of EGR-1 in these cells using tandem repeated Luc-AP-1 and Luc-NF-κB. The activation of both NF-κB and AP-1 are key steps in the cascade of events following the activation of the EGR-1 gene. It was revealed that overexpression of EGR-1 selectively increased AP-1 and NF-κB activation, and that the activation of these nuclear factors appears to be essential for the induction of proliferation and anchorage independence in activated PC-3 and LNCaP cells.

Finally, a descriptive statistical analysis was performed.  Results:   Three hundred questionnaires were distributed to radiation oncologists attending the congress. One hundred twenty-five questionnaires were returned but only 122 (40.6%) were adequately completed and considered for the analysis. Considerable differences were observed among radiation oncologists in prescribing and delivering radiotherapy for bone metastases. There was also a notable divergence from international guidelines, which will be discussed in this report.

Study design and results:   In the Slovak Republic, prostate cancer incidence (age-adjusted to the world standard population) has risen from 14.6/100,000 in 1968 (95% CI, ±1.5772) to 36.2/100,000 in 2005 (95% CI, ±2.0678). The estimated annual increase in the incidence during the period 1968-1991 (before nationwide PSA testing) was 0.421; from 1991 (when nationwide PSA testing began) to up to 2003 it was 0.941. Mortality rates grew from 7.3/100,000 in 1968 to 14.9/100,000 in 2005. In spite of the geographic proximity of the two countries, the increase in incidence occurred faster in the Czech than in the Slovak Republic, from 15.8/100,000 in 1977 (95% CI, ±0.9748) to 59.5/100,000 in 2005 (95% CI, ±1.7187).

In the period before 1991, mortality rose more sharply in the Czech than in the Slovak Republic, whereas after the introduction of PSA testing mortality stabilized more quickly in the Czech than in the Slovak Republic. In the Slovak Republic, a significant reduction in mortality was observed after 2002 and has continued to the present and probably is not affected only by the results connected with the increase in PSA testing.

Apoptotic induction of BDH-treated LNCaP cells was associated with downregulation of Bcl-xL that caused, in turn, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and activation of procaspases and specific proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the patterns of apoptotic induction by BDH in non-prostate, ovarian cancer PA-1 (androgen-independent and -insensitive) cells and prostate cancer cells with different androgen responsiveness, such as C4-2 (androgen-independent and -sensitive), 22Rv1 (androgen-dependent and -low sensitive), and LNCaP (androgen-dependent and -high sensitive) cells. We found that BDH-treated LNCaP cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in a time-dependent manner and induced apoptosis via downregulation of the androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), as well as antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein.

In contrast, the induction of apoptosis and antiproliferative effect in BDH-treated non-prostate cancer PA-1 and hormone refractory C4-2 cells were not detectable and marginal, respectively.

Acceleration of radiotherapy may be also of importance in a subset of tumors. In this study we assessed the feasibility and efficacy of a highly accelerated and hypofractionated scheme of radiotherapy (HypoARC), for the treatment of localized low risk prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Fifty-five patients with prostate cancer (T1-2 stage, Gleason score <7 and prostate specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/ml) were treated with localized conformal 4-field radiotherapy to the prostate and seminal vesicles: 51 Gy were delivered (3.4 Gy/fraction, within 19 days). The biological dose to the prostate ranged from 67.9-91.7 Gy. Amifostine (0-1000 mg depending upon tolerance) was delivered daily for cytoprotection. The median follow-up of patients is 30 (6-69) months.  Results:   Early toxicity was overall low, proctitis being the most frequent side-effect (23.6% grade II). High dose amifostine significantly protected against proctitis (p=0.005). Grade 2 frequency and dysurea occurred in 1.8% and 3.7% of cases, respectively. There was no late toxicity ≥grade 2. Amifostine significantly protected against chronic frequency (p=0.02). Within a median follow-up of 30 months, one patient (1.8%) experienced a biochemical relapse.

The present study evaluated the impact of these drugs in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. A retrospective analysis of 177 patients was performed. The multivariate regression analyses were adjusted for age, prostate volume, Gleason score, T stage, diagnostic setting (clinical symptoms versus elevated PSA only) and presence of diabetes mellitus. Drug use increased with age, e.g. to 50% in patients ≥70 years. The most commonly used drugs were statins (32% of all patients, including those who used drug combinations), followed by NSAIDs (21%) and thiazide diuretics (13%). Drug use was associated with a statistically significant PSA reduction (12%, when comparing 104 non-users to 73 users of any of the three drug types; adjusted analysis, p=0.01). Compared to the U.S.A. National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group assignment based on measured PSA level, reassignment after correcting for medication use resulted in 8 changes among 57 patients with low or intermediate risk (14%). No such changes can be expected in patients belonging to the high-risk group.

PEITC induced morphological changes and DNA damage in DU 145 cells. The induction of G(2)/M phase arrest was mediated by the increase of p53 and WEE1 and it reduced the level of CDC25C protein. The induction of apoptosis was mediated by the activation of caspase-8-, caspase-9- and caspase-3-depedent pathways.

Active surveillance (AS) is becoming an increasingly accepted management alternative for low-risk PC. Our aim is to compare the cumulative medical costs of treatment vs. AS.  Methods and materials:   We collected data on the cumulative medical costs of open radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP), robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT), and AS at our institution. For physicians' reimbursements, Medicare values of our region were used to maintain uniformity. For inpatient costs other than reimbursements, we used the mean cost at our institution. The costs of RRP and RARP involve preoperative investigations, medical clearance, physicians' fees, inpatient costs, and pathologic examination of prostatectomy specimen and follow-up. The inpatient costs include the operating room, disposable equipment, anesthesia, post-anesthesia care, transfusion, and hospital stay. The cost of EBRT involves the cost of consultation, planning, simulation and treatment sessions, and follow-up. BT costs involved radiotherapy planning as well as inpatients costs. AS protocol involves regular visits, transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies, prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. To evaluate the cost of treating complications, treatment after AS, and treatment for recurrence, we created a Markov model based on recent studies and our experience.  Results:   The cumulative costs of RRP are $9,732 (1 year), $10,360 (2 years), $12,209 (5 years), and $15,084 (10 years). While for RARP, the costs are $17,824 (1 year), $18,308 (2 years), $20,117 (5 years), and $22,762 (10 years). The costs of EBRT are $20,730 (1 year), $20,969 (2 years), $22,043 (5 years), and $23,953 (10 years). BT costs are $14,061 (1 year), $14,300 (2 years), $15,374 (5 years), and $17,284 (10 years). The costs of AS are $1,154 (1 year), $2,308 (2 years), $8,761 (5 years), and $13,116 (10 years).  Conclusions:   The cumulative medical costs of RARP and EBRT are much higher than BT, RRP, and AS. AS is associated with a different cost distribution in which the initial cost is low and relatively higher cost of follow-up. Despite the higher follow-up cost, AS remains the most cost effective alternative for low-risk PC.""","""['Ahmed Eldefrawy', 'Devendar Katkoori', 'Matthew Abramowitz', 'Mark S Soloway', 'Murugesan Manoharan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Utilizing time-driven activity-based costing to understand the short- and long-term costs of treating localized, low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Cost comparison of robotic, laparoscopic, and open radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Hospitalization costs for radical prostatectomy attributable to robotic surgery.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Cost of New Technologies in Prostate Cancer Treatment: Systematic Review of Costs and Cost Effectiveness of Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy, Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy, and Proton Beam Therapy.', 'Cost talk: protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial of an intervention helping patients and urologic surgeons discuss costs of care for slow-growing prostate cancer during shared decision-making.', 'The clinical impact of strict criteria for active surveillance of prostate cancer in Korean population: Results from a prospective cohort.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of robotic-assisted versus retropubic radical prostatectomy: a single cancer center experience.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'A Cost-Effectiveness and Quality of Life Analysis of Different Approaches to the Management and Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

One of two problems plagues virtually are existing post-prostatectomy prediction tools: either (1) they predict PSA recurrences (which are of unclear importance) or (2) the predictions they make are anchored at the date of surgery and are not updated based on how patients evolve over the postoperative years. Our prediction tool is a significant improvement over existing prediction tools in that it predicts the development of metastases which is a very important clinical endpoint that indicates incurable prostate cancer. Additionally, our tool allows for updated predictions at any point following radical prostatectomy by considering commonly available postoperative information (postoperative serum PSA and use of adjuvant therapies) to modify its risk predictions. The net result is a dynamic tool that renders clinically relevant predictions that change as the patient's clinical status changes throughout the postoperative course.  Objective:   • To develop a dynamic algorithm that predicts the risk of metastases from any time point after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   • The study cohort consisted of 5741 RP patients who were treated from 1990-99. • Patients were grouped into one of four clinical states at follow-up: State(1) , prostate-specific antigen (PSA) undetectable; State(2), PSA 0.15-0.39 ng/mL; State(3), PSA ≥0.4 ng/mL; and State(4), previous androgen deprivation or radiation therapy. • Follow-up epochs (alive and at risk of systemic progression) at 0, 2, 4 and 6 years post-RP, cumulative incidence curves and multistate Cox models were used to assess the risk of metastases over the ensuing 5-year interval. • Gleason score, seminal vesicle and surgical margin involvement, and PSA variables were evaluated as predictors.  Results:   • Median follow-up was 11.7 years, with 4411, 4256 and 3983 patients followed with PSA at 2, 4 and 6 years, respectively. • In total, 287 metastatic events occurred and the 5-year risk of metastasis was 0.4%, 2.1%, 8.7% and 12.6% for men in States 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. • Independent predictors of metastasis by group included seminal vesicle involvement (all groups), Gleason score (groups 1, 3 and 4), current PSA (groups 3 and 4) and maximum past PSA (group 4).

These values were processed with the information-based similarity software to estimate the dissimilarity between two space series. The following comparisons were carried out: intrasubject versus intragroup distances; intragroup distances among the groups studied and intergroup distances. The distance defined between a vessels immunostained to Factor-VIII space series and its randomized surrogate was considered as an index of the nonrandomness of the space series. These indices were compared for all the groups. We conclude that (a) The information-based similarity analysis can be adapted to vessels immunostained to Factor-VIII space series from prostate microvessels. (b) There are no unique microvascular patterns associated with each individual. (c) There are characteristic patterns describing the microvessels from normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia and carcinoma. (d) This method is able to account for the differences between prostate cancer and both normal and benign prostate conditions, with respect to the microvessel patterns.""","""['L Santamaría', 'I Ingelmo', 'J Ruiz', 'F Teba']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Microsc""","""['Cathepsin B in angiogenesis of human prostate: an immunohistochemical and immunoelectron microscopic analysis.', 'Analysis of microvessels in pancreatic cancer: by light microscopy, confocal laser scan microscopy, and electron microscopy.', 'Computerized whole slide quantification shows increased microvascular density in pT2 prostate cancer as compared to normal prostate tissue.', 'Tumor-associated angiogenesis in prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of microvessel densities in rat prostate tissues treated with finasteride, bicalutamide and surgical castration: a preliminary study.', 'Dimensional study of prostate cancer using stereological tools.']"""

We evaluated the prognostic significance of PSA nadir and time to PSA nadir as well as their interactive effect on prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM) after ADT.  Methods:   A total of 650 men with advanced or metastatic PCa treated with ADT were studied. The prognostic significance of PSA nadir and time to PSA nadir on PCSM and ACM were analysed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox regression model.  Results:   On multivariate analysis, clinical M1 stage, Gleason Score 8-10, PSA nadir ≥ 0.2 ng/ml and time to PSA nadir < 10 months were independent predictors of PCSM and ACM. The combined analysis showed that patient with higher PSA nadir and shorter time to PSA nadir had significantly higher risk of PCSM and ACM compared to those with lower PSA nadir and longer time to PSA nadir (hazard ratios = 6.30 and 4.79, respectively, all P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that higher PSA nadir level and faster time to reach PSA nadir after ADT were associated with shorter survival for PCa.""","""['Shu-Pin Huang', 'Bo-Ying Bao', 'Ming-Tsang Wu', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'William B Goggins', 'Chia-Chu Liu', 'Chao-Yuan Huang', 'Yeong-Shiau Pu', 'Chia-Cheng Yu', 'Tony T Wu', 'Chun-Nung Huang', 'Chun-Hsiung Huang', 'Wen-Jeng Wu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Aging Male""","""['Predictors of mortality after androgen-deprivation therapy in patients with rapidly rising prostate-specific antigen levels after local therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Time to prostate-specific antigen nadir after androgen suppression therapy for postoperative or postradiation PSA failure and risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality.', 'Extreme-risk prostate adenocarcinoma presenting with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)>40 ng/ml: prognostic significance of the preradiation PSA nadir.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'The utility of prostate-specific antigen in the management of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic changes in PSA levels predict prognostic outcomes in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen -deprivation therapy: A multicenter retrospective analysis.', 'Time to Prostate-specific Antigen Nadir and the Risk of Death From Prostate Cancer Following Radiation and Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'The Importance of Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Nadir after Primary Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Hormone-Naïve Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Predictive factor of androgen deprivation therapy for patients with advanced stage prostate cancer.', 'Association of time to prostate-specific antigen nadir and logarithm of prostate-specific antigen velocity after progression in metastatic prostate cancer with prior primary androgen deprivation therapy.']"""
