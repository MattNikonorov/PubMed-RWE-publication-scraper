In turn, 2-5A activates latent ribonuclease (RNaseL), a candidate hereditary prostate cancer gene. OAS1 polymorphism (reference single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] 2660 [rs2660]) has been associated with increased susceptibility to infections and various diseases. In general, the low-enzyme-activity adenine-adenine (AA) genotype promotes susceptibility, whereas the high-enzyme-activity guanosine-guanosine (GG) genotype confers protection. In this study, the authors investigated the association of this functional OAS1 polymorphism (rs2660) with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Sample size and power were calculated using a power calculation software program for case-control genetic association analyses. Genomic DNA samples from a control group (n = 140) and from a case group of patients with prostate cancer (n = 164) were used for genotyping SNPs rs2660, rs1131454, and rs34137742 in all samples. Statistical analyses were performed using a logistic regression model.  Results:   A significant association was observed between the rs2660 genotype (A/G) and prostate cancer. Genotype AA increased the risk, whereas genotype GG decreased the risk of prostate cancer. The GG genotype was not observed in the African American samples. The AA genotype also increased the risk of prostate cancer with age.  Conclusions:   The OAS1 SNP rs2660 AA genotype was associated significantly with prostate cancer, whereas the GG genotype protected against prostate cancer. OAS1 rs2660 may be a prostate cancer susceptibility polymorphism, which is a significant observation, especially in a context of the OAS1-RNaseL pathway. Thus, a functional defect in OAS1 because of the rs2660 SNP not only can attenuate RNaseL function but also can alter cell growth and apoptosis independent of RNaseL.""","""['Sanjay Mandal', 'Fisseha Abebe', 'Jaideep Chaudhary']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['OAS1 gene polymorphism is associated with central nervous system involvement in children with enterovirus 71 infection.', 'Evaluate the relationship between polymorphisms of OAS1 gene and susceptibility to chronic hepatitis C with high resolution melting analysis.', 'OAS1: a multiple sclerosis susceptibility gene that influences disease severity.', 'Implications for RNase L in prostate cancer biology.', 'Significant association of catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met polymorphism with bladder cancer instead of prostate and kidney cancer.', 'The role of Neanderthal introgression in liver cancer.', 'Overexpression of OAS1 Is Correlated With Poor Prognosis in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Role of helical structure and dynamics in oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) mismatch tolerance and activation by short dsRNAs.', 'Comprehensive analysis of prognostic immune-related genes associated with the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Human OAS1 activation is highly dependent on both RNA sequence and context of activating RNA motifs.']"""

Materials and methods:   We reviewed data on 240 men who underwent RP as first-line treatment and who had a PSA assay available at 6 weeks after surgery. Persistent detectable PSA was defined as a PSA level ≥ 0.1 ng/ml at 6 weeks after surgery.  Results:   Overall, 83 men presented persistently elevated PSA after RP and 81 had a biochemical recurrence. Median follow-up was 44 months. In univariate analysis, these factors were associated with biochemical recurrence: preoperative PSA level (P < 0.0001), biopsy and pathologic Gleason score (P < 0.001), capsular involvement (P = 0.0001), positive surgical margins (P < 0.0001), pathological stage ≥ T3 (P = 0.0001), and detectable post-operative PSA ≥ 0.1 ng/ml (P = 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, only the detectable post-operative PSA level ≥ 0.1 ng/mL (P = 0.001), positive surgical margins (P = 0.002), and pathological stage ≥ T3 (P < 0.001) were significant. The individual, five-year, PSA-free survival rate for men with post-operative PSA <0.1 ng/ml and ≥ 0.1 ng/ml were 59 and 42%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Among these patients, 1,984 (39.7%) agreed to complete a battery of questionnaires.  Results:   Overall, 22.6% of the patients were currently consuming hypnotic medication. Factors associated with a greater utilization of hypnotic medication were older age, greater difficulties initiating sleep, more stressful life events experienced in the past 6 months, higher levels of anxiety, past or current psychological difficulties, poorer role functioning, less severe urinary symptoms, greater use of opioids, and past or current chemotherapy treatments.  Conclusions:   These results are consistent with those of previous studies conducted in cancer patients in showing high rates of hypnotic medication use.

Genistein, daidzein and equol, the predominant soy isoflavones, have been reported to lower the risk of prostate cancer. Isoflavones exert their chemopreventive properties by affecting apoptosis signalling pathways in cancer cells. Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an endogenous anticancer agent that induces apoptosis selectively in tumour cells. Soluble or expressed in immune cells, TRAIL molecules play an important role in immune surveillance and defense mechanisms against tumour cells. However, various types of cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. We examined the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of genistein, daidzein and equol in combination with TRAIL in LNCaP cells. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT and LDH assays. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy using Annexin V-FITC. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using DePsipher staining. Flow cytometry detected the expression of death receptor TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5) on cell surfaces. The soy isoflavones sensitized TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells to apoptotic death. The isoflavones did not alter death receptor expression, but significantly augmented TRAIL-induced disruption of ΔΨm in the LNCaP cells. We showed for the first time that the chemopreventive effects of soy foods on prostate cancer are associated with isoflavone-induced support of TRAIL-mediated apoptotic death.""","""['Ewelina Szliszka', 'Wojciech Krol']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Ethanolic extract of Brazilian green propolis sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'The dietary flavonol fisetin enhances the apoptosis-inducing potential of TRAIL in prostate cancer cells.', 'The dietary isoflavone biochanin-A sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'The role of dietary polyphenols in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis for cancer chemoprevention.', 'Targeting death receptors for TRAIL by agents designed by Mother Nature.', 'The Involvement of Natural Polyphenols in Molecular Mechanisms Inducing Apoptosis in Tumor Cells: A Promising Adjuvant in Cancer Therapy.', 'Flavonoids in Cancer and Apoptosis.', 'Synergistic Effect of Bioactive Anticarcinogens from Soybean on Anti-Proliferative Activity in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro.', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand-Induced Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells after Treatment with Xanthohumol-A Natural Compound Present in Humulus lupulus L.', 'Biotransformed soybean extract (BSE) inhibits melanoma cell growth and viability in vitro: involvement of nuclear factor-kappa B signaling.']"""

Glycyrrhetinic acid exists as α and β stereo-isomeric forms. Both stereo-isomeric forms are known to have anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity. However, the effects and anticancer mechanism of α glycyrrhetinic acid in prostate cancer cells has not yet been evaluated. Therefore, we investigated the growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis and the anticancer mechanisms of 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA), on the androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer cell line DU-145. Our results showed that AGA inhibited proliferation and growth of these cells by inducing apoptosis as determined by Annexin V and flow cytometry analyses. Our studies also showed that HUVEC tube formation was drastically reduced when cultured in conditioned medium of AGA-treated DU-145 cells. In addition, AGA treatment prevented the invasion of DU-145 prostate cancer cells on matrigel coated transwells via down-regulation of NF-κB (p65), VEGF and MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, AGA treatment also down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine/growth factor genes HMGB1, IL-6 and IL-8 in DU-145 cells. Interestingly, AGA simultaneously upregulated the expression of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory gene-1 (NAG-1) in DU-145 cells suggesting its anti-inflammatory activity on prostate cancer cells. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that AGA may be a promising anticancer agent that merits further investigation for the chemoprevention and treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Aditya V Shetty', 'Sivasakthivel Thirugnanam', 'Gajalakshmi Dakshinamoorthy', 'Abhilash Samykutty', 'Guoxing Zheng', 'Aoshuang Chen', 'Maarten C Bosland', 'André Kajdacsy-Balla', 'Munirathinam Gnanasekar']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['18β-Glycyrrhetinic acid suppresses TNF-α induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor by suppressing the Akt-dependent NF-κB pathway.', 'Bombesin stimulates nuclear factor kappa B activation and expression of proangiogenic factors in prostate cancer cells.', 'Constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappaB p50/p65 and Fra-1 and JunD is essential for deregulated interleukin 6 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic potential of glycyrrhetinic acids: a patent review (2010-2017).', 'Structure-activity relationship analyses of glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives as anticancer agents.', 'Synthesis, molecular docking, and biological evaluation of 3,2-bindole fused 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives against skin melanoma.', 'Pharmacological Features of 18β-Glycyrrhetinic Acid: A Pentacyclic Triterpenoid of Therapeutic Potential.', 'Integrated network pharmacology and experimental analysis unveil multi-targeted effect of 18α- glycyrrhetinic acid against non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Analysis of the network pharmacology and the structure-activity relationship of glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid.', 'Oncopreventive and oncotherapeutic potential of licorice triterpenoid compound glycyrrhizin and its derivatives: Molecular insights.']"""

We identified genetic determinants of human liver gene expression variation using two independent collections of primary tissue profiled with Agilent (n = 206) and Illumina (n = 60) expression arrays and Illumina SNP genotyping (550K), and we also incorporated data from a published study (n = 266). We found that ∼30% of SNP-expression correlations in one study failed to replicate in either of the others, even at thresholds yielding high reproducibility in simulations, and we quantified numerous factors affecting reproducibility. Our data suggest that drug exposure, clinical descriptors, and unknown factors associated with tissue ascertainment and analysis have substantial effects on gene expression and that controlling for hidden confounding variables significantly increases replication rate. Furthermore, we found that reproducible eQTL SNPs were heavily enriched near gene starts and ends, and subsequently resequenced the promoters and 3'UTRs for 14 genes and tested the identified haplotypes using luciferase assays. For three genes, significant haplotype-specific in vitro functional differences correlated directly with expression levels, suggesting that many bona fide eQTLs result from functional variants that can be mechanistically isolated in a high-throughput fashion. Finally, given our study design, we were able to discover and validate hundreds of liver eQTLs. Many of these relate directly to complex traits for which liver-specific analyses are likely to be relevant, and we identified dozens of potential connections with disease-associated loci. These included previously characterized eQTL contributors to diabetes, drug response, and lipid levels, and they suggest novel candidates such as a role for NOD2 expression in leprosy risk and C2orf43 in prostate cancer.

In this large study of prostate cancer in African American men (3,425 prostate cancer cases and 3,290 controls), we tested 49 risk variants located in 28 genomic regions identified through GWAS in men of European and Asian descent, and we replicated associations (at p≤0.05) with roughly half of these markers. Through fine-mapping, we identified nearby markers in many regions that better define associations in African Americans. At 8q24, we found 9 variants (p≤6×10(-4)) that best capture risk of prostate cancer in African Americans, many of which are more common in men of African than European descent. The markers found to be associated with risk at each locus improved risk modeling in African Americans (per allele OR = 1.17) over the alleles reported in the original GWAS (OR = 1.08). In summary, in this detailed analysis of the prostate cancer risk loci reported from GWAS, we have validated and improved upon markers of risk in some regions that better define the association with prostate cancer in African Americans.

The present study investigated the regulatory mechanism underlying P-Rex1 gene expression in prostate cancer cells. We showed that P-Rex1 expression was much higher in metastatic prostate cancer cells than in prostate epithelial cells and non-metastatic prostate cancer cells. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or silence of endogenous HDAC1 and HDAC2 markedly elevated P-Rex1 transcription in non-metastatic prostate cancer cells, whereas overexpression of recombinant HDAC1 in metastatic prostate cancer cells suppressed P-Rex1 expression. HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) also significantly increased P-Rex1 promoter activity and caused acetylated histones to accumulate and associate with the P-Rex1 promoter. One Sp1 site, essential for basal promoter activity, was identified as critical for the TSA effect. TSA treatment did not alter the DNA-binding activity of Sp1 toward the P-Rex1 promoter; however, it facilitated the dissociation of the repressive HDAC1 and HDAC2 from the Sp1 binding region. Interestingly, HDAC1 association with Sp1 and with the P-Rex1 promoter were much weaker in metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cells than in non-metastatic prostate cancer cells, and HDAC inhibitors only had very modest stimulatory effects on P-Rex1 promoter activity and P-Rex1 expression in PC-3 cells. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that HDACs could regulate P-Rex1 gene transcription by interaction with Sp1 and by region-specific changes in histone acetylation within the P-Rex1 promoter.

Methods:   All subjects who underwent a PleurX catheter placement between 2003 and 2009 were evaluated. General demographic data, time to pleurodesis, complications, and a satisfaction questionnaire were collected. The subjects were divided into two groups. Group I included patients with non-malignant effusions and group II included patients with malignant effusions.  Results:   A total of 64 subjects were included in the final data analysis. A total of 23 subjects were included in group I and 41 subjects were included in group II. The diagnoses in group I included congestive heart failure (CHF; 13), hepatic hydrothorax (8), traumatic bloody (1), and idiopathic exudative (1). The diagnoses in group II included lung cancer (20), breast cancer (11), colon cancer (5), prostate cancer (2), B-cell lymphoma (2), and mesothelioma (1). The time to pleurodesis was 36 ± 12 days for group II compared to 110.8 ± 41 days for group I (p < 0.0001). The mean satisfaction score was similar in both groups (3.8 ± 0.4). Time to pleurodesis was significantly shorter in hepatic hydrothorax compared to CHF (73.6 ± 9 days vs. 113 ± 36 days, p = 0.006). There was one case of exit site infection in a patient with hepatic hydrothorax. Among subjects who were alive at 3 months after the catheter removal, none had recurrence of their pleural effusion.  Conclusion:   The Denver catheter was effective in achieving pleurodesis in non-malignant pleural effusions.

Some studies indicate an association between GPX1 Pro198Leu polymorphism and an increased risk of cancer. The purpose of the present study was to determine the possible association of GPX1 Pro198Leu polymorphism and erythrocyte GPX activity with the risk of developing prostate cancer and to clarify whether erythrocyte GPX activity levels were correlated with the GPX1 Pro198Leu genotype in the Turkish population. The GPX1 Pro198Leu genotype was determined in 33 prostate cancer patients and 91 control individuals. As evident from our results, there was no difference between genotype and/or allele frequencies in prostate cancer patients and controls. No significant difference was found in GPX1 genotype or allele frequency between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancer patients.

Though PAR4 mRNA was detected in normal stomach, the role of PAR4 in gastric cancer has not been investigated. In this study, differential expression of PAR4 was measured by real-time PCR (n=28) and tissue microarrays (n=74). We showed that PAR4 was located from basal to middle portions of normal gastric mucosa. PAR4 expression was remarkably decreased in gastric cancer tissues as compared with matched noncancerous tissues, especially in positive lymph node or low differentiation cancers. Furthermore, methylation of the PAR4 promoter in cell lines was assessed by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and genomic bisulfite sequencing. AGS and N87 human gastric cancer cell lines did not express PAR4, as compared to HT-29 human colon cancer cell line with significant PAR4 expression. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored PAR4 expression in AGS and N87 cells, which exhibited significantly more 5-methylcytosines in the PAR4 promoter compared with HT-29 cells.

Focal laser ablation (FLA) could be one of these treatment modalities. Dosimetry planning and conformation of the treated area to the tumor remain major issues, especially when, several fibers are required. An effective method to perform pre-treatment planning of this therapy is computer simulation. In this study we present an in vivo validation of a mathematical model.  Methods:   The simulation model is based on finite elements method (FEM) to solve the bio-heat and the thermal damage equations. Laser irradiation was performed with a 980 nm laser diode system (5 W, 75 s). Light was transmitted using a cylindrical diffusing fiber inserted inside a preclinical animal prostate cancer model induced in Copenhagen rats. Non-enhanced T2-weighted and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging examinations were performed at baseline and 48 hours after the procedure. The model was validated by comparing the simulated necrosis volume to the results obtained in vivo on (MRI) and by histological analysis. 3 iso-damage temperatures were considered 43° C, 45° C and 50° C.  Results:   The mean volume of the tissue necrosis, estimated from the histological analyses was 0.974 ± 0.059 cc and 0.98 ± 0.052 cc on the 48 h MR images. For the simulation model, volumes were: 1.38 cc when T = 43° C, 1.1 cc for T = 45°C and 0.99 cc when T = 50 C°.  Conclusions:   In this study, a clear correlation was established between simulation and in vivo experiments of FLA for prostate cancer.Simulation is a promising planning technique for this therapy.

Standard therapies are still limited and include androgen ablation that initially causes tumor regression. However, tumor cells eventually relapse and develop into a hormone-refractory prostate cancer. One of the current challenges in this disease is to define new therapeutic targets, which have been virtually unchanged in the past 30 years. Recent studies have suggested that the family of enzymes known as the proprotein convertases (PCs) is involved in various types of cancers and their progression. The present study examined PC expression in prostate cancer and validates one PC, namely PACE4, as a target. The evidence includes the observed high expression of PACE4 in all different clinical stages of human prostate tumor tissues. Gene silencing studies targeting PACE4 in the DU145 prostate cancer cell line produced cells (cell line 4-2) with slower proliferation rates, reduced clonogenic activity, and inability to grow as xenografts in nude mice. Gene expression and proteomic profiling of the 4-2 cell line reveals an increased expression of known cancer-related genes (e.g., GJA1, CD44, IGFBP6) that are downregulated in prostate cancer. Similarly, cancer genes whose expression is decreased in the 4-2 cell line were upregulated in prostate cancer (e.g., MUC1, IL6). The direct role of PACE4 in prostate cancer is most likely through the upregulated processing of growth factors or through the aberrant processing of growth factors leading to sustained cancer progression, suggesting that PACE4 holds a central role in prostate cancer.""","""[""François D'Anjou"", 'Sophie Routhier', 'Jean-Pierre Perreault', 'Alain Latil', 'David Bonnel', 'Isabelle Fournier', 'Michel Salzet', 'Robert Day']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Transl Oncol""","""['Implications of Proprotein Convertases in Ovarian Cancer Cell Proliferation and Tumor Progression: Insights for PACE4 as a Therapeutic Target.', 'Role of proprotein convertases in prostate cancer progression.', 'PACE4 is an important driver of ZR-75-1 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer proliferation and tumor progression.', 'The proprotein convertases furin and PACE4 play a significant role in tumor progression.', ""Proprotein convertase inhibition: Paralyzing the cell's master switches."", 'Inactivation of Notch4 Attenuated Pancreatic Tumorigenesis in Mice.', 'Identification of Genes Associated with Liver Metastasis in Pancreatic Cancer Reveals PCSK6 as a Crucial Mediator.', 'Efficacy of PACE4 pharmacotherapy in JHU-LNCaP-SM preclinical model of androgen independent prostate cancer.', 'PACE4-altCT isoform of proprotein convertase PACE4 as tissue and plasmatic biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Testicular Germ Cell Tumours and Proprotein Convertases.']"""

Growth assays in vitro revealed that the IC(50) values were ∼30 µM, ∼3 nM, and ∼6 nM, for EGCG, paclitaxel and docetaxel, respectively. Isobolograms generated from the data clearly indicated that EGCG in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel had an additive effect in blocking tumor cell growth. EGCG combined with taxane also had an additive effect to increase the expression of apoptotic genes, (p53, p73, p21, and caspase 3) and the percent apoptosis observed in vitro and in tumor modeling studies in severe combined immunodeficient mice. The tumor modeling studies clearly showed that EGCG plus taxane injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) induced a significant increase in apoptosis rates (TUNEL assays) and eliminated preexisting tumors generated from PC-3ML cells implanted i.p., increasing disease-free survival rates to greater than 90%. More importantly, the combination therapy (i.p. biweekly) blocked metastases after intravenous injection of PC-3ML cells through the tail vein. In mice treated with EGCG plus taxane, the disease-free survival rates increased from 0% (in untreated mice) to more than 70% to 80% in treated mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that EGCG in combination with taxane may provide a novel therapeutic treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Mark E Stearns', 'Min Wang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Transl Oncol""","""['Combination therapy with epigallocatechin-3-gallate and doxorubicin in human prostate tumor modeling studies: inhibition of metastatic tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficiency mice.', 'Effect of a prodrug of the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate on the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer in vivo.', 'Identification of epigallocatechin-3-gallate in green tea polyphenols as a potent inducer of p53-dependent apoptosis in the human lung cancer cell line A549.', 'Green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as adjuvant in cancer therapy.', 'New cancer treatment strategy using combination of green tea catechins and anticancer drugs.', 'Apoptotic Potential of Glucomoringin Isothiocyanate (GMG-ITC) Isolated from Moringa oleifera Lam Seeds on Human Prostate Cancer Cells (PC-3).', 'Anticancer Therapeutic Effects of Green Tea Catechins (GTCs) When Integrated with Antioxidant Natural Components.', 'Role of Dietary Antioxidants in p53-Mediated Cancer Chemoprevention and Tumor Suppression.', 'EGCG synergizes the therapeutic effect of irinotecan through enhanced DNA damage in human colorectal cancer cells.', 'Phytoestrogens for Cancer Prevention and Treatment.']"""

We observed that GLI reporter activity was higher in normal (PNT-2) and tumourigenic (DU145 and PC-3) androgen-independent cells compared to androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells and, accordingly, GLI mRNA levels were also elevated. Ectopic expression of GLI1 or the constitutively active ΔNGLI2 mutant induced a distinct cobblestone-like morphology in LNCaP cells that, regarding the former, correlated with increased GLI2 as well as expression of the basal/stem-like markers CD44, β1-integrin, ΔNp63 and BMI1, and decreased expression of the luminal marker AR (androgen receptor). LNCaP-GLI1 cells were viable in the presence of the AR inhibitor bicalutamide and gene expression profiling revealed that the transcriptome of LNCaP-GLI1 cells was significantly closer to DU145 and PC-3 cells than to control LNCaP-pBP (empty vector) cells, as well as identifying LCN2/NGAL as a highly induced transcript which is associated with hormone independence in breast and prostate cancer. Functionally, LNCaP-GLI1 cells displayed greater clonal growth and were more invasive than control cells but they did not form colonies in soft agar or prostaspheres in suspension suggesting that they do not possess inherent stem cell properties. Moreover, targeted suppression of GLI1 or GLI2 with siRNA did not reverse the transformed phenotype of LNCaP-GLI1 cells nor did double GLI1/GLI2 knockdowns activate AR expression in DU145 or PC-3 cells. As such, early targeting of the GLI oncoproteins may hinder progression to a hormone independent state but a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms that maintain this phenotype is required to determine if their inhibition will enhance the efficacy of anti-hormonal therapy through the induction of a luminal phenotype and increased dependency upon AR function.""","""['Sandeep K Nadendla', 'Allon Hazan', 'Matt Ward', 'Lisa J Harper', 'Karwan Moutasim', 'Lucia S Bianchi', 'Mahmoud Naase', 'Lucy Ghali', 'Gareth J Thomas', 'David M Prowse', 'Michael P Philpott', 'Graham W Neill']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Hedgehog/Gli supports androgen signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Gli Transcription Factors Mediate the Oncogenic Transformation of Prostate Basal Cells Induced by a Kras-Androgen Receptor Axis.', 'Cell-line and tissue-specific signatures of androgen receptor-coregulator transcription.', 'Determinants of Gli2 co-activation of wildtype and naturally truncated androgen receptors.', 'Increased expression of androgen receptor sensitizes prostate cancer cells to low levels of androgens.', 'Gold Nanosystems Covered with Doxorubicin/DNA Complexes: A Therapeutic Target for Prostate and Liver Cancer.', 'Hedgehog Signaling for Urogenital Organogenesis and Prostate Cancer: An Implication for the Epithelial-Mesenchyme Interaction (EMI).', 'Analysis of hedgehog signaling in periocular sebaceous carcinoma.', 'NUMB inhibition of NOTCH signalling as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'RANK-mediated signaling network and cancer metastasis.']"""

It was hypothesized that germ-line genetic changes of PTEN affect susceptibility to PCa. Both common (with a minor allele frequency 5%) and rare (with a minor allele frequency <5%) germ-line variants of PTEN were comprehensively evaluated. A total of 15 germ-line variants were identified by re-sequencing the PTEN gene, including 5' untranslated region, all nine exons, exon-intron junctions and 3' untranslated region, in 188 probands of hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) families recruited from Johns Hopkins Hospital. Two microsatellite markers surrounding PTEN were used to test the co-segregation of 10 rare variants, which may give rise to highly penetrance in HPC. Two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated in the 188 HPC families using a family-based association study approach. To study low penetrant SNPs in PCa susceptibility, 33 SNPs covering PTEN were selected from the whole genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from our available case-control studies in Sweden (Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden (CAPS)) and the publicly available cancer genetic markers of susceptibility (CGEMS) study. Germ-line copy-number variations (CNVs) in PTEN were assessed in CAPS. Co-segregation of germ-line variants and PCa was not observed among HPC families and no significant differences in the allele frequencies were observed in sporadic cases and controls, aggressive and non-aggressive PCa (P>0.05).

MiR-146a is reported to be a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. We investigated the clinical significance of miR-146a in gastric cancer, in particular focusing on hypothetical miR-146a target genes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1).  Experimental design:   We examined miR-146a levels in 90 gastric cancer samples by q-real-time (qRT)-PCR and analyzed the association between miR-146a levels and clinicopathologic factors and prognosis. The regulation of EGFR and IRAK1 by miR-146a was examined with miR-146a-transfected gastric cancer cells. Moreover, we analyzed the association between miR-146a levels and the G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within pre-miR-146a seed sequences in 76 gastric cancer samples, using direct sequencing of genomic DNA.  Results:   In 90 clinical samples of gastric cancer, miR-146a levels in cancer tissues were significantly lower than those in the corresponding noncancerous tissue (P < 0.001). Lower levels of miR-146a were associated with lymph node metastasis and venous invasion (P < 0.05). Moreover, a lower level of miR-146a was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.003). Ectopic expression of miR-146a inhibited migration and invasion and downregulated EGFR and IRAK1 expression in gastric cancer cells. In addition, G/C SNP within the pre-miR-146a seed sequence significantly reduced miR-146a levels in the GG genotype compared with the CC genotype.  Conclusions:   MiR-146a contains an SNP, which is associated with mature miR-146a expression.

This multicenter study assessed its efficacy in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), without prior chemotherapy or CYP17-targeted therapy, and frequency of bone scans discordant with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and clinical response.  Experimental design:   Thirty-three patients received abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily with prednisone 5 mg twice daily in continuous 28-day cycles. Patients were evaluated monthly for efficacy and safety. Bone scan flare was defined as the combination, after 3 months of therapy, of an interpreting radiologist's report indicating ""disease progression"" in context of a 50% or more decline in PSA level, with scan improvement or stability 3 months later.  Results:   A 50% or more decline in PSA level at week 12 was confirmed in 22 of 33 (67%) patients. Declines in PSA level of 50% or more were seen in 26 of 33 (79%) patients. Undetectable PSA levels (≤0.1 ng/mL) occurred in 2 patients. Median time on therapy and time to PSA progression were 63 weeks and 16.3 months, respectively. Twenty-three patients were evaluable for bone scan flare. Progression was indicated in radiologist's report in 12 of 23 (52%), and 11 of 12 subsequently showed improvement or stability. As prospectively defined, bone scan flare was observed in 11 of 23 (48%) evaluable patients or 11 of 33 (33%) enrolled patients. Adverse events were typically grade 1/2 and consistent with prior published abiraterone reports.  Conclusion:   Clinical responses to abiraterone plus prednisone were frequent and durable in men with metastatic CRPC.

To address this question, we conducted a nested case-control study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial to investigate whether circulating levels of cytokines and other immune markers are associated with future risk of NHL. Selected cytokines [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α] and other immune markers [soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNF-R1), sTNF-R2, C-reactive protein, and sCD27] were measured in prediagnostic serum specimens from 297 incident NHL cases and 297 individually matched controls. ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) relating quartiles of analyte concentration to NHL risk were calculated by using conditional logistic regression. Statistically significant associations with increased NHL risk were observed for elevated serum levels of sTNF-R1 (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1: OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8; P(trend) = 0.02) and sCD27 (OR = 5.3, 95% CI: 2.9-9.4; P(trend) < 0.0001).

Elevated levels of IL-10, TNF-α and sTNF-R2 were also significantly associated with increased risk of NHL overall; however, these associations weakened with increasing time from blood collection to case diagnosis and were null for cases diagnosed longer than 6 years postcollection.

However, little is known regarding changes in Gleason grade on serial biopsies over an extended period of time.  Patients and methods:   Men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1998 and 2009 who elected active surveillance as initial treatment, with 6 or more months of follow-up and a minimum of six cores at biopsy, were included in analysis. Upgrading and downgrading were defined as an increase or decrease in primary or secondary Gleason score. Means and frequency tables were used to describe patient characteristics, and treatment-free survival rates were determined by life-table product limit estimates.  Results:   Three hundred seventy-seven men met inclusion criteria. Mean age at diagnosis was 61.9 years. Fifty-three percent of men had prostate-specific antigen of 6 ng/mL or less, and 94% had Gleason score of 6 or less. A majority of men were cT1 (62%), had less than 33% of biopsy cores involved (80%), and were low risk (77%) at diagnosis. Median number of cores taken at diagnostic biopsy was 13, mean time to follow-up was 18.5 months, and 29% of men had three or more repeat biopsies. Overall, 34% (129 men) were found to have an increase in Gleason grade. The majority of men who experienced an upgrade (81%) did so by their second repeat biopsy.

Three-dimensional ultrasound images acquired on five patient prostates, before and after TRUS-probe-induced deformation, were registered using a nonrigid, surface-based method, and the accuracy of different deformation models compared. Registration using a statistical motion model was found to outperform alternative elastic deformation methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, and required substantially fewer target surface points to achieve a successful registration. The mean final target registration error (based on anatomical landmarks) using this method was 1.8 mm.

P2Y(1) receptor activation by MRS2365 induced apoptosis in assays of Caspase-3, LDH release, and annexin-V staining. The pro-apoptotic effect of MRS2365 was blocked by MRS2500, P2Y(1) siRNA, and an inhibitor of the MAP kinase pathway PD98059. MRS2365 significantly inhibited the proliferation of PC-3 cells, examined using a MTT assay. Thus, activation of the P2Y(1) receptor induced cell death and inhibited growth of human prostatic carcinoma PC-3 cells. Activation of the P2Y(1) receptor should be a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.""","""['Qiang Wei', 'Stefano Costanzi', 'Qiu-Zhen Liu', 'Zhan-Guo Gao', 'Kenneth A Jacobson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Pharmacological characterization of purinergic inhibitory neuromuscular transmission in the human colon.', 'BPTU, an allosteric antagonist of P2Y1 receptor, blocks nerve mediated inhibitory neuromuscular responses in the gastrointestinal tract of rodents.', 'Purinergic inhibitory regulation of murine detrusor muscles mediated by PDGFRα+ interstitial cells.', 'Update of P2Y receptor pharmacology: IUPHAR Review 27.', 'Pharmacology and structure of P2Y receptors.', 'A2B Adenosine Receptor in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Pursuing Proper Pit Stop to Interfere with Disease Progression.', 'Activation of hypermethylated P2RY1 mitigates gastric cancer by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation.', 'Purinergic signaling: Diverse effects and therapeutic potential in cancer.', 'The P2 purinoceptors in prostate cancer.', 'P2 purinergic receptor dysregulation in urologic disease.']"""

The amount of PSA is dependent of DZ volume. Moreover, DZ volume depends on tumor volume, tumor localization in the prostate and tumor growth rate.  Results:   The study offers the wide spectrum of PSA values, dependent on tumor, prostate and patient characteristics.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of androgen blockades on testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) values in patients with locally advanced and metastatic prostatic cancer.  Methods:   The study included a total of 60 patients out of which 45 with prostatic cancer divided into 3 subgroups based on the type of the applied treatment protocol: 15 patients on monotherapy with luteinizing-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists (group I), 15 patients on total androgen blockade (group II) and 15 patients on monotherapy with antiandrogen (group III)). The control group consisted of 15 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. In all the patients, values of testosteron, LH and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were monitored initially, as well as 3 and 6 months after the treatment protocol introduction.  Results:   In the patients of the groups I, II and III, values of testosterone decreased after three months by 95.58%, 95.72%, and 67%, respectively. The difference was significant (p < 0.01). Between the values after three and six months there was no significant difference in these groups of participants. Testosterone values were significantly higher in the patients of the group III in both analyses. Comparing the values between the groups III and I, as well as those of the groups III and II, a significant difference was found after three and six months of the therapy (p < 0.01). There was a difference in testosterone values between the groups I and II after 3 and 6 months, but not significant. All types of the applied treatment protocols in the therapy of prostatic cancer significantly decreased the values of LH compared to the basal ones.  Conclusion:   Total androgen blockade and LH-RH agonists are more effective in lowering testosterone values (to castration values) compared to the antiandrogen monotherapy, where testosterone values stay above the castration level. This therapy approach has advantages, since it decreases testosterone values providing better therapy response. There is a difference in testosterone values, but not significant, when total androgen blockade and monotherapy with LH-RH agonists are administered. Registered lower basal values of LH in all patients with prostatic cancer open the possibility to introduce LH as a new additional, significant marker in diagnosis of this neoplasm.""","""['Sasa Vojinov', 'Ivan Levakov', 'Dimitrije Jeremić', 'Srdjan Zivojinov', 'Goran Marusić']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Vojnosanit Pregl""","""['Influence of hormonal therapy on the level of prostate specific antigen in patients with advanced prostatic cancer.', 'Hormonal therapy for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate: is there a role for discontinuing treatment after prolonged androgen suppression?', 'The gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist abarelix depot versus luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists leuprolide or goserelin: initial results of endocrinological and biochemical efficacies in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of methods of androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.']"""

A diary questionnaire scoring hot flashes, subjective side effects and quality of life (QOL) had to be completed. Clinical examination was performed at every visit and the concentration of ADT-linked hormones, haemoglobin and cholesterol was measured before, during and after ending treatment. Before the start of treatment, a 1 week baseline registration was performed. An analysis of variance with time of measurement as a within-subject factor was performed. When analysing the hot flashes score, one patient was excluded due to insufficient diary notes. The mean weekly score declined from 112 (SD = 71) at baseline to 59 (SD = 54) at the end of treatment (p = 0.002). Hot flashes diminished significantly from the first week up to and including week 3.

We demonstrated previously that expression of Skp2, a key protein regulating cell entry into the S phase, is inhibited by androgens in an AR-dependent manner (Oncogene, 2004; 23(12): 2161-2176). However, the underlying mechanism of this regulation is unknown.  Methods:   Using the LNCaP PCa cell line as a working model, the effect of androgens on the expression of Skp2 was examined by Western and Northern blot analyses. Cell cycle was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Gene transfection was performed by electroporation to manipulate the expression levels of proteins studied.  Results:   At physiological levels androgens markedly repressed Skp2 expression but slightly induced Skp2 expression at subphysiological levels. Androgens modestly decreased the stability of the Skp2 protein. Androgenic repression of Skp2 expression was completely abolished by E1A-mediated inactivation of pocket proteins including RB, p130, and p107. Moreover, ectopic expression of p107 inhibited Skp2 expression, and silencing of p107 partially blocked androgenic repression of Skp2.  Conclusions:   Our data indicate that androgens repress Skp2 expression via p107-dependent and -independent pathways in PCa cells.

Since the nomograms are optimized on different cohorts, the variations may be due to differences in patient risk-factor distributions. In addition, the nomograms assign different relative scores to the same PC risk factors and rarely stratify for tumor growth rate.  Methods:   We compared BCR-free probabilities from the GPSM model with a cell kinetics (CK) model that uses the individual's tumor state and growth rate. We first created a cohort of 143 patients that reproduced the GPSM patient distribution in Gleason score, Prostate specific antigen (PSA), Seminal vesicle involvement and Margin status since they form the GPSM score. We then performed 143 CK calculations to determine BCR-free probabilities for comparison with the GPSM results for all scores and with four other prominent nomograms for a high-risk patient.  Results:   The BCR-free probabilities from the CK model agree within 10% with those from the GPSM study for all scores once the CK model parameters are stratified in terms of the GPSM risk factors and the PSA doubling time (PSADT). However, the probabilities from widely used nomograms vary significantly.  Conclusions:   The CK model reproduces the observed GPSM BCR-free probabilities with a broad stratification of model parameters for PC risk factors and can thus be used to describe PC progression for individual patients.

We previously reported the functional expression of VGSC in primary cultures and biopsies derived from cervical cancer (CaC). Here, we investigate the relative expression levels of VGSC subunits and its possible role in CaC. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that mRNA levels of Na(V) 1.6 α-subunit in CaC samples were ∼40-fold higher than in noncancerous cervical (NCC) biopsies. A Na(V) 1.7 α-subunit variant also showed increased mRNA levels in CaC (∼20-fold). All four Na(V) β subunits were also detected in CaC samples, being Na(V) β1 the most abundant. Proteins of Na(V) 1.6 and Na(V) 1.7 α-subunits were immunolocalized in both NCC and CaC biopsies and in CaC primary cultures as well; however, although in NCC sections proteins were mainly relegated to the plasma membrane, in CaC biopsies and primary cultures the respective signal was stronger and widely distributed in both cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Functional activity of Na(V) 1.6 channels in the plasma membrane of CaC cells was confirmed by whole-cell patch-clamp experiments using Cn2, a Na(V) 1.6-specific toxin, which blocked ∼30% of the total sodium current. Blocking of sodium channels VGSC with tetrodotoxin and Cn2 did not affect proliferation neither migration, but reduced by ∼20% the invasiveness of CaC primary culture cells in vitro assays.

Computer-aided accurate and computationally efficient prostate segmentation in TRUS images is a challenging task, owing to low signal-to-noise ratio, speckle noise, calcifications, and heterogeneous intensity distribution in the prostate region.  Method:   A multi-resolution framework using texture features in a parametric deformable statistical model of shape and appearance was developed to segment the prostate. Local phase information of log-Gabor quadrature filter extracted texture of the prostate region in TRUS images. Large bandwidth of log-Gabor filter ensures easy estimation of local orientations, and zero response for a constant signal provides invariance to gray level shift. This aids in enhanced representation of the underlying texture information of the prostate unaffected by speckle noise and imaging artifacts.

However, the effect of diosgenin on cancer metastasis remains unclear. The aim of the study is to examine the effect of diosgenin on migration and invasion in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.  Methods and principal findings:   Diosgenin inhibited proliferation of PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. When treated with non-toxic doses of diosgenin, cell migration and invasion were markedly suppressed by in vitro wound healing assay and Boyden chamber invasion assay, respectively. Furthermore, diosgenin reduced the activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 by gelatin zymography assay. The mRNA level of MMP-2, -9, -7 and extracellular inducer of matrix metalloproteinase (EMMPRIN) were also suppressed while tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) was increased by diosgenin. In addition, diosgenin abolished the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PC-3 cells and tube formation of endothelial cells. Our immunoblotting assays indicated that diosgenin potently suppressed the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), Akt, extracellular signal regulating kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In addition, diosgenin significantly decreased the nuclear level of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), suggesting that diosgenin inhibited NF-κB activity.  Conclusion/significance:   The results suggested that diosgenin inhibited migration and invasion of PC-3 cells by reducing MMPs expression. It also inhibited ERK, JNK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways as well as NF-κB activity.

Better prognostic markers are needed to stratify patients for appropriately aggressive therapy. By expression profiling, we can identify a proliferation signature variably expressed in prostate cancers. Here, we asked whether one or more tissue biomarkers might capture that information, and provide prognostic utility. We assayed three proliferation signature genes: MKI67 (Ki-67; also a classic proliferation biomarker), TOP2A (DNA topoisomerase II, alpha), and E2F1 (E2F transcription factor 1). Immunohistochemical staining was evaluable on 139 radical prostatectomy cases (in tissue microarray format), with a median clinical follow-up of eight years. Each of the three proliferation markers was by itself prognostic. Notably, combining the three markers together as a ""proliferation index"" (0 or 1, vs. 2 or 3 positive markers) provided superior prognostic performance (hazard ratio = 2.6 (95% CI: 1.4-4.9); P = 0.001). In a multivariate analysis that included preoperative serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason grade and pathologic tumor stage, the composite proliferation index remained a significant predictor (P = 0.005). Analysis of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed the improved prognostication afforded by incorporating the proliferation index (compared to the clinicopathologic data alone).

Ku55933 or NU7441 alone increased the sensitivity of CaP cell lines to the DNA damaging agents, however combining both inhibitors together resulted in further enhancement of sensitivity. The cell cycle profile of both cell lines was altered with increased cell death, DNA DSBs and H2AX foci formation.

In the present study, the inhibitory mechanism of rhapontigenin isolated from Vitis coignetiae was investigated on HIF-1α stability and angiogenesis in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Rhapontigenin significantly suppressed HIF-1α accumulation at protein level but not at mRNA level in PC-3 cells under hypoxia. Also, rhapontigenin suppressed hypoxia-induced HIF-1α activation in various cancer cells, such as colorectal adenocarcinoma (SW620), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) and prostate carcinoma (LNCaP). Interestingly, rhapontigenin had more potency in inhibition of hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression than that of resveratrol, a known HIF-1α inhibitor. In addition, rhapontigenin promoted hypoxia-induced HIF-1α degradation and cycloheximide (CHX) blocked protein synthesis. A prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) is usually utilized to examine whether prolyl hydroxylation is involved in inhibition of HIF-1α accumulation. Here, DMOG recovered HIF-1α accumulation inhibited by rhapontigenin. Immunoprecipitation assay also revealed that rhapotigenin enhanced the binding of hydroxylated HIF-1α to von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein. Furthermore, rhapontigenin reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in hypoxic PC-3 cells as well as suppressed tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated by the conditioned media of hypoxic PC-3 cells.

Measuring isotopic enrichment in metabolites provides quantitative insights into the biosynthetic network and enables flux analysis as a function of external perturbations. NMR and mass spectrometry are the techniques of choice for global profiling of stable isotope labeling patterns in cellular metabolites. However, meaningful biochemical interpretation of the labeling data requires both quantitative analysis and complex modeling. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach that involved acquiring and modeling the timecourses of (13)C isotopologue data for UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) synthesized from [U-(13)C]-glucose in human prostate cancer LnCaP-LN3 cells. UDP-GlcNAc is an activated building block for protein glycosylation, which is an important regulatory mechanism in the development of many prominent human diseases including cancer and diabetes.  Results:   We utilized a stable isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) approach to determine the timecourse of (13)Cincorporation from [U-(13)C]-glucose into UDP-GlcNAc in LnCaP-LN3 cells. (13)CPositional isotopomers and isotopologues of UDP-GlcNAc were determined by high resolution NMR and Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry. A novel simulated annealing/genetic algorithm, called 'Genetic Algorithm for Isotopologues in Metabolic Systems' (GAIMS) was developed to find the optimal solutions to a set of simultaneous equations that represent the isotopologue compositions, which is a mixture of isotopomer species. The best model was selected based on information theory. The output comprises the timecourse of the individual labeled species, which was deconvoluted into labeled metabolic units, namely glucose, ribose, acetyl and uracil. The performance of the algorithm was demonstrated by validating the computed fractional 13C enrichment in these subunits against experimental data. The reproducibility and robustness of the deconvolution were verified by replicate experiments, extensive statistical analyses, and cross-validation against NMR data.  Conclusions:   This computational approach revealed the relative fluxes through the different biosynthetic pathways of UDP-GlcNAc, which comprises simultaneous sequential and parallel reactions, providing new insight into the regulation of UDP-GlcNAc levels and O-linked protein glycosylation. This is the first such analysis of UDP-GlcNAc dynamics, and the approach is generally applicable to other complex metabolites comprising distinct metabolic subunits, where sufficient numbers of isotopologues can be unambiguously resolved and accurately measured.""","""['Hunter N B Moseley', 'Andrew N Lane', 'Alex C Belshoff', 'Richard M Higashi', 'Teresa W M Fan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Biol""","""['Moiety modeling framework for deriving moiety abundances from mass spectrometry measured isotopologues.', 'Correcting for the effects of natural abundance in stable isotope resolved metabolomics experiments involving ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry.', 'Chloroformate derivatization for tracing the fate of Amino acids in cells and tissues by multiple stable isotope resolved metabolomics (mSIRM).', 'NMR-based isotope editing, chemoselection and isotopomer distribution analysis in stable isotope resolved metabolomics.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Differential Inhibition of Anaplerotic Pyruvate Carboxylation and Glutaminolysis-Fueled Anabolism Underlies Distinct Toxicity of Selenium Agents in Human Lung Cancer.', 'Tracer metabolomics reveals the role of aldose reductase in glycosylation.', 'Enhancing anti-AML activity of venetoclax by isoflavone ME-344 through suppression of OXPHOS and purine biosynthesis.', 'Deciphering the Properties and Functions of Glycoproteins Using Quantitative Proteomics.', 'Bayesian kinetic modeling for tracer-based metabolomic data.']"""

Material and methods:   Nine-hundred and fifteen patients with T0-4, Nx, M1, G1-3, hormone- naïve prostate cancer were randomized to treatment with PEP 240 mg i.m. twice a month for 2 months and thereafter monthly, or to flutamide (Eulexin®) 250 mg per os three times daily in combination with either triptorelin (Decapeptyl®) 3.75 mg i.m. per month or on an optional basis with bilateral orchidectomy. Pretreatment cardiovascular morbidity was recorded and cardiovascular events during treatment were assessed by an experienced cardiologist. A multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression.  Results:   There was a significant increase in cardiovascular events during treatment with PEP in patients with previous ischaemic heart disease (p = 0.008), ischaemic cerebral disease (p = 0.002), intermittent claudication (p = 0.031) and especially when the whole group of patients with pretreatment cardiovascular diseases was analysed together (p < 0.001). In this group 33% of the patients had a cardiovascular event during PEP treatment. In the multivariate analysis PEP stood out as the most important risk factor for cardiac complications (p = 0.029). Even in the CAD group there was a significant increase in cardiovascular events in the group with all previous cardiovascular diseases taken together (p = 0.036).  Conclusions:   Patients with previous cardiovascular disease are at considerable risk of cardiovascular events during treatment with high-dose PEP and even during CAD therapy. Patients without pretreatment cardiovascular morbidity have a moderate cardiovascular risk during PEP treatment and could be considered for this treatment if the advantages of this therapy, e.g. avoidance of osteopenia and hot flushes and the low price, are given priority.""","""['Per Olov Hedlund', 'Robert Johansson', 'Jan Erik Damber', 'Inger Hagerman', 'Peter Henriksson', 'Peter Iversen', 'Peter Klarskov', 'Peter Mogensen', 'Finn Rasmussen', 'Eberhard Varenhorst;SPCG- STUDY GROUP']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Scand J Urol Nephrol""","""['Parenteral estrogen versus combined androgen deprivation in the treatment of metastatic prostatic cancer -- Scandinavian Prostatic Cancer Group (SPCG) Study No. 5.', 'Parenteral estrogen versus combined androgen deprivation in the treatment of metastatic prostatic cancer: part 2.

Objective:   This study aimed to determine the relationship between dietary intake (macronutrients, fruits, vegetables and lycopene), lifetime physical activity and oxidative DNA damage with prostate cancer.  Design:   A case control study was carried out among 105 subjects (case n=35, control n=70), matched for age and ethnicity. Data on sociodemographic, medical, dietary intake, consumption of lycopene rich food and lifetime physical activity were obtained through an interview based questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements including weight, height and waist hip circumferences were also carried out on subjects. A total of 3 mL fasting venous blood was drawn to assess lymphocyte oxidative DNA damage using the alkaline comet assay.  Results:   Cases had a significantly higher intake of fat (27.7 ± 5.5%) as compared to controls (25.1 ± 5.9%) (p < 0.05). Mean intakes of fruits and vegetables (3.11 ± 1.01 servings/d)(p < 0.05), fruits (1.23 ± 0.59 servings/d) (p<0.05) and vegetables (1.97 ± 0.94 servings/d) were higher in controls than cases (2.53 ± 1.01, 0.91 ∓ 0.69, 1.62 ± 0.82 servings/d). A total of 71% of cases did not met the recommendation of a minimum of three servings of fruits and vegetables daily, as compared to 34% of controls (p < 0.05) (adjusted OR 6.52 (95% CI 2.3-17.8)) (p < 0.05). Estimated lycopene intake among cases (2,339 ∓ 1,312 mcg/d) were lower than controls (3881 ∓ 3120 mcg/d) (p< 0.01). Estimated lycopene intake of less than 2,498 mcg/day (50th percentile) increased risk of prostate cancer by double [Adjusted OR 2.5 (95%CI 0.99-6.31)]. Intake of tomatoes, watermelon, guava, pomelo, papaya, mango, oranges, dragon fruit, carrot, tomato sauce and barbeque sauce were higher in controls compared to cases. Intake of tomato sauce of more than 2.24 g/d (25th percentile), papaya more than 22.7 g/d (50th percentile) and oranges more than 19.1g/h (50th percentile) reduced prostate cancer risk by 7.4 (Adjusted OR 7.4 (95% CI 1.17-46.8)), 2.7 (adjusted OR 2.75 (95% CI 1.03-7.39)) and 2.6 times (adjusted OR = 2.6 (95% CI=1.01-6.67)), respectively (p < 0.05 for all parameters).

Methods:   A model for spatially anisotropic edema that resolves linearly with time was developed based on serial magnetic resonance imaging measurements made previously at our center to characterize the edema for a group of n = 40 prostate implant patients [R. S. Sloboda et al., ""Time course of prostatic edema post permanent seed implant determined by magnetic resonance imaging,"" Brachytherapy 9, 354-361 (2010)]. Model parameters consisted of edema magnitude, delta, and period, T. The TG-43 dose calculation formalism for a point source was extended to incorporate the edema model, thus enabling calculation via numerical integration of the cumulative dose around an individual seed in the presence of edema. Using an even power piecewise-continuous polynomial representation for the radial dose function, the cumulative dose was also expressed in closed analytical form. Application of the method was illustrated by calculating the preimplant dosimetry error, RE(preplan), in a 5 x 5 x 5 cm3 volume for 125I (Oncura 6711), 103Pd (Theragenics 200), and 131Cs (IsoRay CS-1) seeds arranged in the Radiological Physics Center test case 2 configuration for a range of edema relative magnitudes (delta = [0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0]) and periods (T = [28, 56, 84] d). Results were compared to preimplant dosimetry errors calculated using a variation of the isotropic edema model developed by Chen et al. [""Dosimetric effects of edema in permanent prostate seed implants: A rigorous solution,"" Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 47, 1405-1419 (2000)].  Results:   As expected, RE(preplan) for our edema model indicated underdosage in the calculation volume with a clear dependence on seed and calculation point positions, and increased with increasing values of delta and T. Values of RE(preplan) were generally larger near the ends of the virtual prostate in the RPC phantom compared with more central locations. For edema characteristics similar to the population average values previously measured at our center, i.e., delta = 0.2 and T = 28 d, mean values of RE(preplan) in an axial plane located 1.5 cm from the center of the seed distribution were 8.3% for 131Cs seeds, 7.5% for 103Pd seeds, and 2.2% for 125I seeds. Maximum values of RE(preplan) in the same plane were about 1.5 times greater. Note that detailed results strictly apply only for loose seed implants where the seeds are fixed in tissue and move in synchrony with that tissue.  Conclusions:   A dose calculation method for permanent prostate implants incorporating spatially anisotropic linearly time-resolving edema was developed for which cumulative dose can be written in closed form. The method yields values for RE(preplan) that differ from those for spatially isotropic edema. The method is suitable for calculating pre- and postimplant dosimetry correction factors for clinical seed configurations when edema characteristics can be measured or estimated.""","""['T T Monajemi', 'Charles M Clements', 'Ron S Sloboda']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Potential impact of prostate edema on the dosimetry of permanent seed implants using the new 131Cs (model CS-1) seeds.', 'The impact of edema on planning 125I and 103Pd prostate implants.', 'Optimum timing for image-based dose evaluation of 125I and 103PD prostate seed implants.', 'A dynamic model for the estimation of optimum timing of computed tomography scan for dose evaluation of 125I or 103Pd seed implant of prostate.', 'Recommendations of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine regarding the impact of implementing the 2004 task group 43 report on dose specification for 103Pd and 125I interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Impact of edema and seed movement on the dosimetry of prostate seed implants.']"""

Correlations between complexity metrics are also assessed.  Method:   A program was developed to calculate a series of metrics used to describe the complexity of IMRT fields using monitor units (MUs) and multileaf collimator files: Modulation index (MI), modulation complexity score (MCS), and plan intensity map variation (PIMV). Each metric, including the MUs, was used to assess changes in beam complexity for six prostate patients, following upgrades in the inverse planning optimization software designed to incorporate direct aperture optimization (DAO). All beams were delivered to a 2D ionization chamber array and compared to those calculated using gamma analysis. Each complexity metric was then calculated for all beams, on a different set of six prostate IMRT patients, to assess differences between plans calculated using different minimum field sizes and different maximum segment numbers. Different geometries, including CShape, prostate, and head and neck phantoms, were also assessed using the metrics. Correlations between complexity metrics were calculated for 20 prostate IMRT patients.  Results:   MU, MCS, MI, and PIMV could all detect reduced complexity following an upgrade to the optimization leaf sequencer, although only MI and MCS could detect a reduction in complexity when one-step optimization (DAO) was employed rather than two-step optimization. All metrics detected a reduction in complexity when the minimum field size was increased from 1 to 4 cm and all apart from PIMV detected reduced complexity when the number of segments was significantly reduced. All metrics apart from MI showed differences in complexity depending on the treatment site. Significant correlations exist between all metrics apart from MI and PIMV for prostate IMRT patients. Treatment deliverability appeared to be more correlated with MI and MCS than MU or PIMV.  Conclusions:   The application of complexity metrics in the IMRT treatment planning process has been demonstrated. Complexity of treatment plans can vary for different inverse planning software versions and can depend on planning parameters and the treatment site. MCS is most suitable for inclusion within the cost function to limit complexity in IMRT optimization due to its sensitivity to complexity changes and correlation to treatment deliverability.""","""['Conor K McGarry', 'Candice D Chinneck', ""Monica M O'Toole"", ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Kevin M Prise', 'Alan R Hounsell']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Complexity metrics for IMRT and VMAT plans: a review of current literature and applications.', 'Quantification of beam complexity in intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment plans.', 'A new metric for assessing IMRT modulation complexity and plan deliverability.', 'Fractal analysis for assessing the level of modulation of IMRT fields.', 'Direct aperture optimization as a means of reducing the complexity of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy plans.', 'Evaluation of a planar diode matrix for SRS patient-specific QA in comparison with GAFchromic films.', 'Evaluation of candidate template beam models for a matched TrueBeam treatment delivery system.', 'Beam complexity and monitor unit efficiency comparison in two different volumetric modulated arc therapy delivery systems using automated planning.', 'Comparison of complexity metrics for multi-institutional evaluations of treatment plans in radiotherapy.', 'Complexity metrics for IMRT and VMAT plans: a review of current literature and applications.']"""

This could allow for definition of quantitative image-based disease signatures and lead to development of classifiers for disease detection on multiprotocol in vivo MRI. Automated registration of MR and WMH images of the prostate is complicated by dissimilar image intensities, acquisition artifacts, and nonlinear shape differences.  Methods:   The authors present a method for automated elastic registration of multiprotocol in vivo MRI and WMH sections of the prostate. The method, multiattribute combined mutual information (MACMI), leverages all available multiprotocol image data to drive image registration using a multivariate formulation of mutual information.  Results:   Elastic registration using the multivariate MI formulation is demonstrated for 150 corresponding sets of prostate images from 25 patient studies with T2-weighted and dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI and 85 image sets from 15 studies with an additional functional apparent diffusion coefficient MRI series. Qualitative results of MACMI evaluation via visual inspection suggest that an accurate delineation of CaP extent on MRI is obtained. Results of quantitative evaluation on 150 clinical and 20 synthetic image sets indicate improved registration accuracy using MACMI compared to conventional pairwise mutual information-based approaches.  Conclusions:   The authors' approach to the registration of in vivo multiprotocol MRI and ex vivo WMH of the prostate using MACMI is unique, in that (1) information from all available image protocols is utilized to drive the registration with histology, (2) no additional, intermediate ex vivo radiology or gross histology images need be obtained in addition to the routinely acquired in vivo MRI series, and (3) no corresponding anatomical landmarks are required to be identified manually or automatically on the images.""","""['Jonathan Chappelow', 'B Nicolas Bloch', 'Neil Rofsky', 'Elizabeth Genega', 'Robert Lenkinski', 'William DeWolf', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Spatially weighted mutual information (SWMI) for registration of digitally reconstructed ex vivo whole mount histology and in vivo prostate MRI.', 'Development of a registration framework to validate MRI with histology for prostate focal therapy.', 'Central gland and peripheral zone prostate tumors have significantly different quantitative imaging signatures on 3 Tesla endorectal, in vivo T2-weighted MR imagery.', 'Challenges in accurate registration of 3-D medical imaging and histopathology in primary prostate cancer.', 'Histological Validation of MRI: A Review of Challenges in Registration of Imaging and Whole-Mount Histopathology.', 'Preoperative imaging accuracy in size determination of prostate cancer in men undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localised disease.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Deep Learning Model for Intracranial Hemangiopericytoma and Meningioma Classification.', '3D Registration of pre-surgical prostate MRI and histopathology images via super-resolution volume reconstruction.', 'ProsRegNet: A deep learning framework for registration of MRI and histopathology images of the prostate.']"""

Image registration is required in order to map biopsy targets planned on a previous session's 3D-TRUS image into the context of the current session. The authors evaluated the performance of surface- and intensity-based rigid and nonrigid registration algorithms for this task using a clinically motivated success criterion of a maximum 2.5 mm target registration error (TRE).  Methods:   The authors collected two 3D-TRUS images for each of 13 patients, where each image was collected in a separate biopsy session, and the sessions were 1 week apart. The authors tested the iterative closest point and thin-plate spline surface-based registration methods, and the block matching and B-spline intensity-based methods. Manually marked intrinsic fiducials (calcifications) were used to calculate a TRE for each of the tested methods. In addition, error ellipsoids, anisotropy, and variability due to image segmentation were analyzed. All analysis was performed separately for the peripheral zone since this area harbors up to 80% of all prostate cancer.  Results:   Only the intensity-based nonrigid registration method met the success criterion for both the whole gland and the peripheral zone. Segmentation was a substantial contributor to registration error variability for the surface-based methods, and the surface-based methods resulted in greater error volumes and anisotropy.  Conclusions:   Intensity-based rigid registration is clinically sufficient to register regions outside the peripheral zone, but nonrigid registration is required in order to register the peripheral zone with clinically needed accuracy. The clinical advantage of using nonrigid registration is questionable since the difference between the RMS TREs for rigid and nonrigid intensity-based registration could be considered to be small (0.3 mm) and is statistically significant.

The aim of this study was to validate diagnostic value of sarcosine for PCa, to evaluate urine metabolomic profiles in patients with PCa in comparison of non-cancerous control, and to further explore the other potential metabolic biomarkers for PCa. Isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (ID GC/MS) metabolomic approach was applied to evaluate sarcosine using [methyl-D(3)]-sarcosine as an internal standard. Microwave-assisted derivatization (MAD) together with GC/MS was utilized to obtain the urinary metabolomic information in 20 PCa patients compared with eight patients with benign prostate hypertrophy and 20 healthy men. Acquired metabolomic data were analyzed using a two-sample t test. Diagnostic models for PCa were constructed using principal component analysis and were assessed with receiver-operating characteristic curves. Results showed that the urinary sarcosine level has no statistical difference between the PCa group and the control group. In addition, nine metabolomic markers between the PCa group and the healthy male group were selected, which constructed a diagnostic model with a high area under the curve value of 0.9425.

Although this procedure is well tolerated by most patients, it can result in considerable discomfort that can effectively be overcome with local injection anesthesia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the size (i.e., circumference) of the transrectal probe on pain during TRUS-Bx.  Material and methods:   One hundred and seventy eligible patients who had elevated total prostate specific antigen (tPSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) were included in this study. Patients (pts.) were divided into three TRUS-Bx groups; Group I: 60 pts. underwent TRUS-Bx with newer B-K Type 8808 probe (circumference 58 mm) under injectable periprostatic anesthesia, Group II: 60 pts. underwent TRUS-Bx with B-K Type 8551 probe (circumference 74 mm) under injectable periprostatic anesthesia, and Group III: 50 pts. underwent TRUS-Bx with B-K Type 8551 probe (circumference 74 mm) without local anesthesia. Periprostatic injection anesthesia was performed with 10 cc, 1% lidocaine (5 cc on each side) 10 min before TRUS-Bx. Pain was assessed using a 10-point modified visual analog scale (VAS) 15 min after the biopsy procedure.  Results:   Three groups were homogeneous with respect to age and tPSA, and no statistically significant difference was observed in terms of mean biopsy duration between the 3 groups. Most of the patients experienced no pain to slight pain in Groups I and II, but 66% of the patients had more than moderate pain (VAS ≥ 5) in Group III with mean VAS score statistically higher than the other two groups (Group I vs. III, P = 0.0001; Group II vs. III, P = 0.0001). Mean VAS score was not statistically different between Group I and II (P = 0.126). No statistically significant difference in VAS pain perception was observed between different age categories within the Group I, II, and III.  Conclusion:   In the absence of injectable local anesthesia, larger probe (74 mm) results in much higher VAS pain perception than same size and smaller (58 mm) probe used under injectable local anesthesia. However, under injectable local anesthesia, the size (circumference) of the transrectal probe (58 mm vs. 74 mm) does not result in any different pain perception during TRUS-Bx.""","""['Sefik Koprulu', 'Ibrahim Cevik', 'Nuri Unlu', 'Ozdal Dillioglugil']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['May ultrasound probe size influence pain perception of needle piercing during transrectal prostate biopsy?

RNA-Seq (whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing) is proving to be a useful tool for the discovery of novel gene fusions in cancer transcriptomes. However, algorithmic methods for the discovery of gene fusions using RNA-Seq data remain underdeveloped. We have developed deFuse, a novel computational method for fusion discovery in tumor RNA-Seq data. Unlike existing methods that use only unique best-hit alignments and consider only fusion boundaries at the ends of known exons, deFuse considers all alignments and all possible locations for fusion boundaries. As a result, deFuse is able to identify fusion sequences with demonstrably better sensitivity than previous approaches. To increase the specificity of our approach, we curated a list of 60 true positive and 61 true negative fusion sequences (as confirmed by RT-PCR), and have trained an adaboost classifier on 11 novel features of the sequence data. The resulting classifier has an estimated value of 0.91 for the area under the ROC curve. We have used deFuse to discover gene fusions in 40 ovarian tumor samples, one ovarian cancer cell line, and three sarcoma samples. We report herein the first gene fusions discovered in ovarian cancer.

In this model, we show that prostate tumors from 30-week-old TRAMP mice have increased Ron expression compared with age-matched wild-type prostates. Based on the upregulation of Ron in human prostate cancers and in this murine model of prostate tumorigenesis, we hypothesized that this receptor has a functional role in the development of prostate tumors. To test this hypothesis, we crossed TRAMP mice with mice that are deficient in Ron signaling (TK-/-). Interestingly, TK-/- TRAMP+ mice show a significant decrease in prostate tumor mass relative to TRAMP mice containing functional Ron. Moreover, TK-/- TRAMP+ prostate tumors exhibited decreased tumor vascularization relative to TK+/+ TRAMP+ prostate tumors, which correlated with reduced levels of the angiogenic molecules vascular endothelial growth factor and CXCL2. Although Ron loss did not alter tumor cell proliferation, a significant decrease in cell survival was observed.

A single-arm, prospective phase II trial was initiated at Stanford in December of 2003. This trial uses SBRT as monotherapy for 'low-risk' prostate cancer patients, and 69 patients have been entered to date. We have analyzed the patient data for the first 5 years of this study. For study entry, patients were required to have clinical stage T1c or T2a disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 10 and a Gleason score of 3 + 3 (or 3 + 4 if the higher grade portion was of small volume, usually <25% of the cores involved). No prior treatment was permitted, including the use of transurethral resections or androgen deprivation therapies. A low urinary IPSS score of < 20 was required for study entry as well. The prescription dose was 7.25 Gy for 5 fractions for a total dose of 36.25 Gy. This was normalized to cover ≥ 95% of the planning target volume with 100% of the prescription dose. Patients were treated using CyberKnife technology. To date, excellent PSA responses have been observed in patients with lower-risk disease selected for treatment and receiving 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. To date, sexual quality of life outcomes have also been approximately comparable to other radiotherapy approaches.

Imaging and tracking of the prostate during a treatment course has yielded a great deal of information about the motion and deformation of the gland during radiotherapy, and has led the way toward the development of more accurate treatment methods including dose-guided and adaptive strategies. Now, there is long-term experience with the use of fiducials and electromagnetic implantable beacons that give high-quality tracking of prostate motion. From analyzing these extensive tracking data sets, a clear understanding of prostate motion and its dosimetric significance has developed. This knowledge can now be used to define current expectations and guidelines for clinical care. The random nature of prostate motion requires daily localization if treatment is to be delivered with small margins. Interfraction motion can have a significant impact on prostate gland dosimetry, and even more of an impact on the seminal vesicles and possibly intraprostatic tumor areas. The dosimetric impact on normal structures (bladder/rectum) is less clear, and there are significant individual variations. Interfraction and intrafraction rotations and deformations of the prostate are routinely detected. The dosimetric impact of these motions of the prostate gland is minimal when daily localization is used, even when the treatment margins are small. However, deformations of the seminal vesicles, rectum and bladder are much more pronounced. The dosimetric impact of deformation of the rectum and bladder is highly variable among patients, and the clinical consequences remain unclear. Daily volumetric imaging and dosimetry may become quite important for these volumes. Due to the random nature of motion/deformation during prostate radiotherapy, adaptive radiotherapy ideally would be performed as an on-line process. On-line adaptive radiotherapy requires robust deformable registration and replanning programs. These are beginning to emerge in useful clinic applications.""","""['Patrick Kupelian', 'John L Meyer']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Front Radiat Ther Oncol""","""['Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'A novel approach for evaluation of prostate deformation and associated dosimetric implications in IGRT of the prostate.', 'Dosimetric and deformation effects of image-guided interventions during stereotactic body radiation therapy of the prostate using an endorectal balloon.', 'Clinical to planning target volume margins in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Image guidance and the new practice of radiotherapy: what to know and use from a decade of investigation.', 'Adaptive proton therapy.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: Rationale, current applications, and clinical outcome.', 'Time and frequency to observe fiducial markers in MLC-modulated fields during prostate IMRT/VMAT beam delivery.', 'Three-dimensional MRI evaluation of the effect of bladder volume on prostate translocation and distortion.', 'Dose tracking assessment for image-guided radiotherapy of the prostate bed and the impact on clinical workflow.']"""

Positive surgical margins increase the risk of post-operative cancer recurrence. Positive surgical margins are frequently found at the apex. The utility of intraoperative FSA of the margins is controversial.  Methods:   We reviewed a consecutive series of radical prostatectomy cases (n = 1669) performed at our institution, in which UMs were routinely evaluated by intraoperative FSA.  Results:   The submitted UM tissue contained cancer glands in 111 cases (6.7%). On FSA, the pathologists detected cancer in 55 cases (3.3%), missed cancer in 38 (2.3%), and reported atypical glands in 18 (1.1%). FSA of the UMs had a sensitivity of 59.1%, specificity of 99.8%, and positive and negative predictive value of 94.8% and 97.6%, respectively. The low sensitivity resulted from a substantial false-negative rate (n = 38), which was largely attributed to limited sampling on FSA (n = 31). Of the 55 patients (3.3%) whose positive UMs were detected by FSA, 20 (1.2%) had cancer-free margins after tissue re-excision. A positive final UM was associated with greater biochemical recurrence (P = .0073). However, the few patients limited the statistical analysis of the benefit of margin conversion through tissue re-excision (P = .35).  Conclusions:   Although experienced pathologists can evaluate the UMs on FSA with good accuracy, FSA has a relatively low sensitivity.

The C-terminus part of HARP composed of amino acids 111 to 136 is particularly involved in its biological activities and we previously established that a synthetic peptide composed of the same amino acids (P111-136) was capable of inhibiting the biological activities of HARP. Here we evaluate the ability of P111-136 to inhibit in vitro and in vivo the growth of a human tumour cell line PC-3 which possess an HARP autocrine loop.  Methods:   A total lysate of PC-3 cells was incubated with biotinylated P111-136 and pulled down for the presence of the HARP receptors in Western blot. In vitro, the P111-136 effect on HARP autocrine loop in PC-3 cells was determined by colony formation in soft agar. In vivo, PC-3 cells were inoculated in the flank of athymic nude mice. Animals were treated with P111-136 (5 mg/kg/day) for 25 days. Tumour volume was evaluated during the treatment. After the animal sacrifice, the tumour apoptosis and associated angiogenesis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. In vivo anti-angiogenic effect was confirmed using a mouse Matrigel™ plug assay.  Results:   Using pull down experiments, we identified the HARP receptors RPTPβ/ζ, ALK and nucleolin as P111-136 binding proteins. In vitro, P111-136 inhibits dose-dependently PC-3 cell colony formation. Treatment with P111-136 inhibits significantly the PC-3 tumour growth in the xenograft model as well as tumour angiogenesis. The angiostatic effect of P111-136 on HARP was also confirmed using an in vivo Matrigel™ plug assay in mice  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that P111-136 strongly inhibits the mitogenic effect of HARP on in vitro and in vivo growth of PC-3 cells. This inhibition could be linked to a direct or indirect binding of this peptide to the HARP receptors (ALK, RPTPβ/ζ, nucleolin). In vivo, the P111-136 treatment significantly inhibits both the PC-3 tumour growth and the associated angiogenesis. Thus, P111-136 may be considered as an interesting pharmacological tool to interfere with tumour growth that has now to be evaluated in other cancer types.""","""['Yamina Hamma-Kourbali', 'Oya Bermek', 'Isabelle Bernard-Pierrot', 'Racha Karaky', 'Dominique Martel-Renoir', 'Sophie Frechault', 'José Courty', 'Jean Delbé']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Dominant negative effectors of heparin affin regulatory peptide (HARP) angiogenic and transforming activities.', 'Heparin affin regulatory peptide binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis.', 'Heparin affin regulatory peptide/pleiotrophin negatively affects diverse biological activities in C6 glioma cells.', 'Biochemical and mitogenic properties of the heparin-binding growth factor HARP.', 'Implication of HARP in angiogenesis and possible therapeutic role.', 'Overexpression of Nucleolin and Associated Genes in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of Hub Diagnostic Biomarkers and Candidate Therapeutic Drugs in Heart Failure.', 'Pleiotrophin: Activity and mechanism.', 'Targeting surface nucleolin induces autophagy-dependent cell death in pancreatic cancer via AMPK activation.', 'Pleiotrophin exerts its migration and invasion effect through the neuropilin-1 pathway.']"""

This study set out to determine the biospectroscopy-derived spectral differences between risk-associated cohorts to CaP. Benign prostate tissues were obtained using transurethral resection from high-risk (n = 11, UK) and low-risk (n = 14, India) cohorts.

However, the differences in prostate stromal cells present in young and old tissue are still obscure. We established primary cultured stromal cells from normal prostatic peripheral zone (PZ) of donors of varying ages and found that cultured stromal cells from old donors (PZ-old) were more enlarged and polygonal than those from young donors (PZ-young). Furthermore, based on immunocytochemical and ultrastructural analysis, the components of stromal cells changed from a majority of fibroblasts to a mixture of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with increasing donor age. Using a three-dimensional in vitro culture system, we found that PZ-old stromal cells could enhance the proliferation, migration and invasion of cocultured benign BPH-1 and PC-3 cells. Using an in vivo tissue recombination system, we also found that PZ-old stromal cells are more effective than PZ-young cells in promoting tumour formation by BPH-1 cells of high passage (>100) and PC-3 cells. To probe the possible mechanism of these effects, we performed cDNA microarray analysis and profiled 509 upregulated genes and 188 downregulated genes in PZ-old cells. Among the changed genes, we found genes coding for a subset of paracrine factors that are capable of influencing adjacent epithelial cells; these include hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IGFBP4), IGFBP5 and matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1). Changes in the expression of these genes were further confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Overall, our findings indicate that stromal cells from prostate PZ of old donors are more active than similar cells from young donors in promoting the malignant process of adjacent epithelial cells.

Lung cancer cells, in particular, have high rates of radioresistance that lead to treatment failure. We have previously shown that the autophagy induced in the context of decreased apoptosis confers radiosensitivity to prostate and lung cancer cells. Zinc supplementation has antiapoptotic effects in cell culture. In addition, the accumulation of zinc in response to oxidative stress has been associated with increased autophagy in astrocyte and breast cancer cells.  Methods:   In this study, we hypothesized that the zinc ionophore PCI-5002 radiosensitizes lung cancer cells by inducing autophagic cell death. To test this hypothesis, we used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, including clonogenic assays to test for radiosensitivity, biochemical analyses of apoptosis and autophagy, and a xenograft mouse model of tumor growth.  Results:   We found that PCI-5002 reduced clonogenic survival in treated cells compared with untreated cells (0.03% versus 0.1% surviving fraction, p < 0.001). The increased radiosensitive fraction of PCI-5002-treated cells was accompanied by increased autophagy. PCI-5002 treatment also reduced caspase-3 cleavage. In an irradiated xenograft mouse model, the tumor growth of irradiated, PCI-5002-treated mice was slower than untreated, irradiated mice (25 days versus 22 days to reach a 1.0 cm tumor size).  Conclusions:   PCI-5002 treatment sensitizes lung cancer cells to radiation, both in vitro and in vivo. This data suggest that PCI-5002 could potentially treat radioresistant/locally advanced lung cancer by amplifying the effects of radiotherapy.""","""['Kwang Woon Kim', 'Christina K Speirs', 'Dae Kwang Jung', 'Bo Lu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Thorac Oncol""","""['Combined Bcl-2/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition leads to enhanced radiosensitization via induction of apoptosis and autophagy in non-small cell lung tumor xenograft model.', 'AT-101, a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor, leads to radiosensitization of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Inhibition of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor by CP-751,871 radiosensitizes non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'Autophagy is not uniformly cytoprotective: a personalized medicine approach for autophagy inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Advances in the Research of the Regulation of Chinese Traditional Medicine Monomer and Its Derivatives on Autophagy in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Role of autophagy in tumor response to radiation: Implications for improving radiotherapy.', 'Zinc in Cognitive Impairment and Aging.', 'Autophagy as a Target for Drug Development Of Skin Infection Caused by Mycobacteria.', 'The effects and the mechanisms of autophagy on the cancer-associated fibroblasts in cancer.', 'Autophagy and radiosensitization in cancer.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the effect of screening for ovarian cancer on mortality in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   Randomized controlled trial of 78,216 women aged 55 to 74 years assigned to undergo either annual screening (n = 39,105) or usual care (n = 39,111) at 10 screening centers across the United States between November 1993 and July 2001. Intervention The intervention group was offered annual screening with CA-125 for 6 years and transvaginal ultrasound for 4 years. Participants and their health care practitioners received the screening test results and managed evaluation of abnormal results. The usual care group was not offered annual screening with CA-125 for 6 years or transvaginal ultrasound but received their usual medical care. Participants were followed up for a maximum of 13 years (median [range], 12.4 years [10.9-13.0 years]) for cancer diagnoses and death until February 28, 2010.  Main outcome measures:   Mortality from ovarian cancer, including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers. Secondary outcomes included ovarian cancer incidence and complications associated with screening examinations and diagnostic procedures.  Results:   Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 212 women (5.7 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and 176 (4.7 per 10,000 person-years) in the usual care group (rate ratio [RR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.48). There were 118 deaths caused by ovarian cancer (3.1 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and 100 deaths (2.6 per 10,000 person-years) in the usual care group (mortality RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.82-1.71). Of 3285 women with false-positive results, 1080 underwent surgical follow-up; of whom, 163 women experienced at least 1 serious complication (15%). There were 2924 deaths due to other causes (excluding ovarian, colorectal, and lung cancer) (76.6 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and 2914 deaths (76.2 per 10,000 person-years) in the usual care group (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.96-1.06).  Conclusions:   Among women in the general US population, simultaneous screening with CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasound compared with usual care did not reduce ovarian cancer mortality.

A purported novel application of PSMA detection is the intraoperative real-time identification of CaP using radioimmunoscintigraphy to define the extension of the surgical resection. Considering that PSMA expression has been reported in other tissues, we evaluated its immunoexpression in prostatic neurovascular bundle elements to assess the convenience and safety of the aforementioned procedure.  Materials and methods:   Twenty consecutive specimens of radical prostatectomy (RP) were retrieved from our surgical pathology archives. PSMA immunoexpression (Clone 3E6, DAKO) was assessed in a representative section from each specimen containing neurovascular bundle elements.  Results:   PSMA expression was documented in 20/20 of examined CaP slides. Most cases exhibited an apical/cytoplasmic or cytoplasmic with membranous accentuation pattern of staining. Focal weak to moderate cytoplasmic staining was detected in associated ganglionic tissue in 3/15 of the examined RP. In all cases, staining was cytoplasmic, less extensive, and weaker than the pattern observed in CaP. None of the peripheral nerve sheath cells or lymphovascular components of the examined neurovascular bundles were positive for PSMA.  Conclusions:   We found focal positive PSMA expression in the ganglionic cells of the prostatic neurovascular bundle. Our results suggest that the radioimmunoscintigraphic detection of radiolabeled PSMA antibodies might not be entirely specific for prostatic cells; this observation must be taken into account should an intraoperative PSMA-based fluorescent imaging technique be used to define the extension of the surgical procedure.""","""['Alcides Chaux', 'John Eifler', 'Sarah Karram', 'Turki Al-Hussain', 'Sheila Faraj', 'Martin Pomper', 'Ronald Rodriguez', 'George J Netto']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['PSMA expression in Schwannoma: a potential clinical mimicker of metastatic prostate carcinoma.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) protein expression in normal and neoplastic tissues and its sensitivity and specificity in prostate adenocarcinoma: an immunohistochemical study using mutiple tumour tissue microarray technique.', 'PSA-PSMA profiles and their impact on sera PSA levels and angiogenic activity in hyperplasia and human prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression is greatest in prostate adenocarcinoma and lymph node metastases.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen for prostate cancer theranostics: from imaging to targeted therapy.', 'PSMA expression by microvasculature of thyroid tumors - Potential implications for PSMA theranostics.', 'Visualization of prostatic nerves by polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography.', 'Novel methods for mapping the cavernous nerves during radical prostatectomy.', 'Prodrug strategy for PSMA-targeted delivery of TGX-221 to prostate cancer cells.']"""

The present study examined the effect of acute and chronic hypoxia on the metastatic potential of prostate cancer PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP cells.  Methods and materials:   Cell proliferation and clonogenicity were tested by MTT assay and colony formation assay, respectively. ""Wound-healing"" and Matrigel-based chamber assays were used to monitor cell motility and invasion. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression was tested by Western blot, and HIF-1-target gene expression was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was determined by gelatin zymography.  Results:   When PC-3 cells were exposed to 1% oxygen (hypoxia) for various periods of time, chronic hypoxia (≥24 h) decreased cell proliferation and induced cell death. In contrast, prostate cancer cells exposed to acute hypoxia (≤6 h) displayed increased motility, clonogenic survival, and invasive capacity. At the molecular level, both hypoxia and anoxia transiently stabilized HIF-1α. Exposure to hypoxia also induced the early expression of MMP-2, an invasiveness-related gene. Treatment with the HIF-1 inhibitor YC-1 attenuated the acute hypoxia-induced migration, invasion, and MMP-2 activity.

Methods and materials:   Between 2006 and 2010, a total of 50 men with newly diagnosed PC comprised the study cohort. We calculated and compared the false-positive and false-negative PSA velocity >2 ng/ml/y rates for all men and those with low-risk disease using two approaches to calculate PSA velocity. First, we used PSA values obtained within 18 months of diagnosis; second, we used values within 18 months of diagnosis, substituting the prebiopsy PSA for a repeat, nonconfounded PSA that was obtained using the same assay and without confounders.  Results:   Using PSA levels pre-biopsy, 46% of all men had a PSA velocity >2 ng/ml/y; whereas this value declined to 32% when substituting the last prebiopsy PSA for a repeat, nonconfounded PSA using the same assay and without confounders.

Methods and materials:   This multicenter protocol was characterized by the prospective evaluation of rectal toxicity through self-assessed questionnaires (minimum follow-up, 36 months) by 718 adult men in the AIROPROS 0102 trial. Doses were between 70 and 80 Gy. Nomograms were created based on multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Results:   Inputs for the nomogram for G2 to G3 late rectal bleeding estimation were as follows: presence of abdominal surgery before RT, percentage volume of rectum receiving >75 Gy (V75Gy), and nomogram-based estimation of the probability of G2 to G3 acute gastrointestinal toxicity (continuous variable, which was estimated using a previously published nomogram). G3 late rectal bleeding estimation was based on abdominal surgery before RT, V75Gy, and NOMACU. Prediction of G2 to G3 late fecal incontinence was based on abdominal surgery before RT, presence of hemorrhoids, use of antihypertensive medications (protective factor), and percentage volume of rectum receiving >40 Gy.

Methods and materials:   The charts of 47 prostate cancer patients with PSA recurrence after prostatectomy who had positive lymph nodes on magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) were reviewed. Positive lymph nodes were assigned to a lymph node region according to the guidelines of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) for delineation of the CTV for pelvic irradiation (RTOG-CTV). We defined four lymph node regions for positive nodes outside this RTOG-CTV: the para-aortal, proximal common iliac, pararectal, and paravesical regions. They were referred to as aberrant lymph node regions. For each patient, clinical and pathologic features were recorded, and their association with aberrant lymph drainage was investigated. The distribution of positive lymph nodes was analyzed separately for patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <1.0 ng/mL.  Results:   MRL detected positive aberrant lymph nodes in 37 patients (79%). In 20 patients (43%) a positive lymph node was found in the pararectal region. Higher PSA at the time of MRL was associated with the presence of positive lymph nodes in the para-aortic region (2.49 vs. 0.82 ng/mL; p = 0.007) and in the proximal common iliac region (1.95 vs. 0.59 ng/mL; p = 0.009).

Methods and materials:   From September 2003 to February 2006, 105 hormone-naive patients underwent permanent prostate brachytherapy with (125)I Rapid Strand (Oncura Inc., Arlington Heights, IL). All patients underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 weeks before implant, transrectal ultrasound at the time of implant, and both computed tomography and MRI 2.5 to 3 weeks after implant. Prostates were divided into 5 subgroups based on preimplant MRI volumes: less than 25 mL, 25 to 35 mL, 35 to 45 mL, 45 to 55 mL, and greater than 55 mL. Prostate swelling was assessed by use of preimplant and postimplant MRI volumes. Postimplant dosimetry was determined by MRI and compared between the subgroups.  Results:   All prostates showed postimplant swelling on MRI when compared with preimplant MRI, with a mean increase of 31% ± 31% (p < 0.0001). The greatest swelling was noted in small prostates (volume less than 25 mL), with a mean increase of 70% ± 36%. The degree of swelling in the group with a volume less than 25 mL was significantly larger than the degree of swelling in all other prostate subgroups (p < 0.003). Transrectal ultrasound significantly overestimates the prostate volume when compared with MRI by a mean of 15% ± 25% (p = 0.0006) and is more pronounced for smaller prostates. Although prostates with volumes less than 25 mL did not have significantly worse D90 compared with larger prostates, they had the largest percent of suboptimal implants by the standard ratio of D90 divided by the prescription dose.

Using megavoltage cone-beam computed tomography (MVCBCT), references such as bones, the prostate itself or implanted fiducial markers can be used as surrogates to correct patient positioning immediately before each treatment fraction. However, the use of fiducials requires an invasive procedure and may increase costs. We aimed to assess whether intra- or periprostatic calcifications (IPC) could be used as natural fiducials.  Methods and materials:   Data on patients treated with IGRT for prostate cancer with clearly visible IPC and implanted fiducials in both planning CT and MVCBCT images were reviewed. IPC were classified as central when inside the prostate and peripheral when within the planning target volume. Daily deviations in lateral, longitudinal, and vertical directions from baseline positioning using fiducials and using IPC were compared.  Results:   A total of 287 MVCBCT images were obtained and analyzed from 10 patients. The mean ± standard deviation daily deviation (mm) in the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical coordinates were 0.55 ± 3.11, 0.58 ± 3.45, and -0.54 ± 4.03, respectively, for fiducials, and 0.72 ± 3.22, 0.63 ± 3.58, and -0.69 ± 4.26, for IPC. The p values for comparisons (fiducials vs. IPC) were 0.003, 0.653, and 0.078 for lateral, longitudinal, and vertical coordinates, respectively. When cases with central IPC were analyzed (n = 7), no significant difference was found in such comparisons. Central IPC and fiducials exhibited a similar pattern of displacement during treatment, with equal values for daily displacements in the three directions for more than 90% of measurements.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that centrally located IPC may be used as natural fiducials for treatment positioning during IGRT for prostate cancer, with potential reductions in the risks and costs associated with fiducial implantation.""","""['Samir Abdallah Hanna', 'Wellington Furtado Pimenta Neves-Junior', 'Gustavo Nader Marta', 'Cecília Maria Kalil Haddad', 'João Luis Fernandes da Silva']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Intraprostatic calcifications as natural fiducial markers in image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) for prostate cancer comparing kV imaging of fiducial markers with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).', 'Inter- and intrafraction uncertainty in prostate bed image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Fiducial markers and spacers in prostate radiotherapy: current applications.', 'Comparison of image-guided radiotherapy technologies for prostate cancer.', 'Delineation of prostatic calcification using quantitative susceptibility mapping: Spatial accuracy for magnetic resonance-only radiotherapy planning.', 'Observed high incidence of prostatic calculi with the potential to act as natural fiducials for prostate image guided radiotherapy.', 'Observer uncertainties of soft tissue-based patient positioning in IGRT.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', 'Daily patient setup error in prostate image guided radiation therapy with fiducial-based kilovoltage onboard imaging and conebeam computed tomography.']"""

Background:   Urinary incontinence after radical prostate surgery is common immediately after surgery, although the chance of incontinence is less after TURP than following radical prostatectomy.  Design:   Two multicentre, UK, parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing active conservative treatment [pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) delivered by a specialist continence physiotherapist or a specialist continence nurse] with standard management in men after radial prostatectomy and TURP.  Setting:   Men having prostate surgery were identified in 34 centres across the UK. If they had urinary incontinence, they were invited to enroll in the RCT.  Participants:   Men with urinary incontinence at 6 weeks after prostate surgery were eligible to be randomised if they consented and were able to comply with the intervention.  Interventions:   Eligible men were randomised to attend four sessions with a therapist over a 3-month period. The therapists provided standardised PFMT and bladder training for male urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The control group continued with standard management.  Main outcome measures:   The primary outcome of clinical effectiveness was urinary incontinence at 12 months after randomisation, and the primary measure of cost-effectiveness was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Outcome data were collected by postal questionnaires at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.  Results:   Within the radical group (n = 411), 92% of the men in the intervention group attended at least one therapy visit and were more likely than those in the control group to be carrying out any PFMT at 12 months {adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.30 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.53]}. The absolute risk difference in urinary incontinence rates at 12 months between the intervention (75.5%) and control (77.4%) groups was -1.9% (95% CI -10% to 6%). NHS costs were higher in the intervention group [£ 181.02 (95% CI £ 107 to £ 255)] but there was no evidence of a difference in societal costs, and QALYs were virtually identical for both groups. Within the TURP group (n = 442), over 85% of men in the intervention group attended at least one therapy visit and were more likely to be carrying out any PFMT at 12 months after randomisation [adjusted RR 3.20 (95% CI 2.37 to 4.32)]. The absolute risk difference in urinary incontinence rates at 12 months between the intervention (64.9%) and control (61.5%) groups for the unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis was 3.4% (95% CI -6% to 13%). NHS costs [£ 209 (95% CI £ 147 to £ 271)] and societal costs [£ 420 (95% CI £ 54 to £ 785)] were statistically significantly higher in the intervention group but QALYs were virtually identical.  Conclusions:   The provision of one-to-one conservative physical therapy for men with urinary incontinence after prostate surgery is unlikely to be effective or cost-effective compared with standard care that includes the provision of information about conducting PFMT.

Material, methods and results:   In SR, the age-adjusted incidence of prostate cancer rose from 14.6/100,000 in 1968 to 36.2/100,000 in 2005. The estimated annual increase of incidence from 1968 to 1991 (before nation-wide PSA testing) was 0.421 and 1991-2003 it reached 0.941. The mortality rates rose from 7.3/100,000 in 1968 to 14.9/100,000 in 2005. The increase in incidence occurred faster in CR than in SR, from 15.8/100,000 in 1977 to 59.5/100,000 in 2005. The estimated annual increase of incidence in CR in 1977-1991 was 0.581,while in 1991-2003 it reached 1.981. Before 1991, mortality rose more sharply in CR than in SR while after the introduction of PSA testing mortality stabilized more quickly in the CR than in SR. In SR a significant reduction of mortality was observed after 2002 and is probably affected by more factors than those associated with the increase in PSA testing.

The present study was designed to understand the mechanism underlying adenosine-induced apoptosis in the DU-145, PC3, and LNcap-FGC10 human prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   To observe cell viability and proliferation, MTT assay, cell counting, and BrdU assay were carried out in DU-145, PC3, and LNcap-FGC10 cells. Apoptosis was assessed with the analysis of cell cycle, Hoechst 33258 staining, propidium iodide and annexin-V staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨM) measurement, caspase-3 activity assay, Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression. Moreover, the expression of adenosine receptors and the effects of adenosine receptor (A(1) , A(2a) , and A(3) ) antagonists were examined.  Result:   Adenosine significantly reduced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in DU-145, PC3, and LNcap-FGC10 cell lines. Adenosine induced arrest in the cell-cycle progression in G0/G1 phase through Cdk4/cyclinD1-mediated pathway. Adenosine induced apoptosis, which was determined by morphological changes and increased sub-G1 population.

Methods:   We investigated the expression levels and subcellular localization of Cldn3 and Cldn4 in primary human prostate cancer tissues, human prostate cancer cell lines (22Rv1, DU145, and PC3) and normal human prostate epithelial cells (PrECs). Cytotoxic effects of CPE on these cells were examined by colorimetric assay. We studied whether knockdown of Cldn3 and/or Cldn4 expression using RNA interference influenced CPE-mediated cytotoxicity. The therapeutic effect of CPE was evaluated in PC3 xenografts in athymic mice.  Results:   Cldn4 and Cldn3 were expressed in primary human prostate cancer tissues, 22Rv1, DU145, and PC3. Cldn4 protein was expressed in PrEC. Cldn4 was distributed along whole cell membranes of the cancer cell lines, whereas it was localized at tight junctions in PrEC. CPE-mediated cytotoxicity was greatly detected in PC3, but was hardly detectable in PrEC. Reduced expression of Cldn4, but not Cldn3, led to remarkable decreases of cytotoxicity in both PC3 and 22Rv1. The injection of CPE around PC3 xenografts significantly suppressed tumor growth.  Conclusion:   CPE-mediated cytotoxicity was observed in human prostate cancer cell lines, but barely detected in normal human PrECs.

Methods:   Transcriptomic experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation were combined to identify direct androgen regulated genes. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses were performed to measure TM4SF1 mRNA levels in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) specimens. Immunohistochemical methods were used to compare TM4SF1 protein expression profiles in the same cohort. A targeted siRNAs knockdown strategy was used, prior to wound healing assays, to analyze the role of TM4SF1 in cell migration in vitro.  Results:   We demonstrate for the first time that TM4SF1 is a direct target gene of the AR, a transcription factor of the steroid nuclear receptor family. A functional androgen response element was identified in the promoter region of the gene. In addition, TM4SF1 mRNA expression was higher in cancer samples compared to BPH tissues. The TM4SF1 protein mediates cell motility of prostate cancer cells where it is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, in contrast to its apical membrane localization in normal prostate epithelial cells.

We examined the possibility of long-term cryopreserved pyramidalis muscle (PM) specimens as a source of striated muscle stem cells for the treatment of post-prostatectomy SUI.  Methods:   PM specimens were obtained from five male patients (mean age, 61-70 years) who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Specimens (volume, approximately 125 mm³ ) were obtained from the incisional edge, minced, and stored at -80°C in a freezing medium (Cell Banker 1®). After 24-60 months, the specimens were thawed and directly incubated at 37°C. Satellite cells were selectively cultured by magnetic affinity cell sorting using an anti-neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) antibody. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were induced by bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7) and γ-linolenic acid, respectively.  Results:   NCAM-positive cells (>99% purity) were selectively cultured from all cryopreserved PM specimens and confirmed as being of striated muscle origin by the expression of desmin and MyoD. They fused and differentiated into multinucleated myotubes 7 days after incubation in a differentiation induction medium.

Recently it was found that EGFR in cancer cells has a kinase-independent pro-survival function, preventing cells from undergoing autophagy. In the present study we investigated whether the anti-autophagic function of EGFR may contribute to resistance of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells to chemotherapeutic-induced apoptosis.  Methods:   We first characterized the autophagic phenotype induced by knocking down EGFR in hormone refractory prostate cancer cells (PC-3MM2 and DU-145), then we tested whether loss of EGFR-induced autophagy could sensitize cancer cells to adriamycin.  Results:   Using continuous live cell imaging techniques, we observed that knocking down EGFR lead to typical autophagic morphological/molecular changes, cell shrinkage without detachment, aggregation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) protein and absence of activation of apoptotic caspases 3/7. Loss of EGFR also increased the activity of calpain, which is pro-apoptotic. Knocking down EGFR, but not inhibiting its tyrosine kinase activity, significantly sensitized cells to adriamycin-induced apoptosis. Adriamycin-induced apoptosis could be inhibited by increased extracellular glucose level, suggesting intracellular glucose deficiency is a key mediator of the sensitization. The loss of EGFR induced autophagy and sensitization to adriamycin were also reproduced by using another hormone refractory prostate cancer cell line, Du145.  Conclusion:   Taken together, these data suggest that decreasing the expression level of EGFR protein, rather than inhibiting its tyrosine kinase activity, may enhance the efficiency of EGFR targeted therapy for prostate cancer.""","""['Shuping Xu', 'Zhang Weihua']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist limits DU-145 prostate cancer growth by attenuating epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.', ""Phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activation leads to multidrug resistance protein-1 expression and subsequent chemoresistance in advanced prostate cancer cells."", 'Adenoviral vector-mediated augmentation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) enhances the radiosensitization properties of anti-EGFr treatment in prostate cancer cells.', 'Steroid hormone receptors as targets for the therapy of breast and prostate cancer--recent advances, mechanisms of resistance, and new approaches.', 'Autophagy and doxorubicin resistance in cancer.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Synergistic inhibitory effect of berberine and icotinib on non-small cell lung cancer cells via inducing autophagic cell death and apoptosis.', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Stimulates Fatty Acid Synthesis Mainly via PLC-γ1/Akt Signaling Pathway in Dairy Goat Mammary Epithelial Cells.', 'Arsenic circumvents the gefitinib resistance by binding to P62 and mediating autophagic degradation of EGFR in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Targeted reduction of the EGFR protein, but not inhibition of its kinase activity, induces mitophagy and death of cancer cells through activation of mTORC2 and Akt.']"""

The goal of this study was to characterize the expression and function of Nodal in prostate cancer and determine whether, like other TGFβ ligands, it modulates androgen receptor (AR) activity.  Methods:   Nodal expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays and Western blots of prostate cell lines. The functional role of Nodal was examined using Matrigel and soft agar growth assays. Cross-talk between Nodal and AR signaling was assessed with luciferase reporter assays and expression of endogenous androgen regulated genes.  Results:   Significantly increased Nodal expression was observed in cancer compared with benign prostate specimens. Nodal was only expressed by DU145 and PC3 cells. All cell lines expressed Nodal's co-receptor, Cripto-1, but lacked Lefty, a critical negative regulator of Nodal signaling. Recombinant human Nodal triggered downstream Smad2 phosphorylation in DU145 and LNCaP cells, and stable transfection of pre-pro-Nodal enhanced the growth of LNCaP cells in Matrigel and soft agar.

Meta-analysis was conducted in a fixed/random effect model.  Results:   Thirty-eight independent studies including 34,782 cases and 38,626 controls on the association of CYP17 gene polymorphisms with PCa risk in different ethnic groups were identified. The meta-analysis was performed for five polymorphisms: rs743572 (A1/A2, 38 studies), rs6162 (C/T, 3 studies), rs619824 (C/A, 4 studies), rs2486758 (T/C, 4 studies), and rs10883782 (A/G, 4 studies).

However, the working mechanisms are not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the possible molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by taxanes in prostate cancer.  Methods:   The human LNCaP cells (bearing wild-type p53), DU145 cells (bearing mutant p53) and PC3 cells (lacking p53) were used. The expression levels of protein were determined by Western blot and the mRNA levels were determined by reverse transcriptase PCR. The apoptosis was measured by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometric analysis.  Results:   LNCaP cells are more resistant to docetaxel than DU145 and PC3 cells. Knocking down p53 by small interference RNA (siRNA) sensitizes LNCaP cells to docetaxel treatment. Docetaxel stabilizes p53 protein level and upregulates p21 in a p53-dependent manner in LNCaP cells. Docetaxel increases p38 phosphorylation in LNCaP cells. Treatment with p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 or knocking down p38 by siRNA significantly impaired the upregulation of p53 and p21 by docetaxel. Knocking down p38 or p21 sensitizes LNCaP cells to docetaxel treatment and the antiapoptotic effect of p21 can be reversed by p38 siRNA in LNCaP cells.

Loss of glycosylation has been suggested to play important roles in tumor development, particularly in detachment and migration of carcinoma cells. We previously reported that glycosylation of α-DG, but not levels of α-DG core protein itself, is reduced in prostate carcinoma. In this study, we investigate the association between reduction of laminin-binding glycans on α-DG and the degree of tumor cell differentiation and/or infiltrative properties, as assessed by the Gleason grading system.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical analysis of 146 biopsy specimens of prostate adenocarcinoma with various Gleason scores was carried out employing IIH6 and 6C1 antibodies, which recognize laminin-binding glycans on α-DG and α-DG core proteins, respectively. Double immunofluorescence staining was performed to evaluate colocalization of α-DG and laminin, and to determine which types of epithelial cells express laminin-binding glycans on α-DG.  Results:   Reduction of α-DG glycosylation, rather than loss of α-DG core protein, was correlated with higher Gleason patterns. Reduction was most conspicuous at the interface between carcinoma cells and the basement membrane. In addition, in non-neoplastic prostate glands, laminin-binding glycans were expressed predominantly on the basolateral surface of basal cells.  Conclusions:   Reduced expression of laminin-binding glycans on α-DG may contribute to formation of highly infiltrative behavior of prostate carcinoma cells.

The authors report on the safety and efficacy of an expedited radiotherapy course for salvage prostate radiotherapy.  Methods:   A total of 108 consecutive patients were treated with salvage radiation therapy to 65 grays (Gy) in 26 fractions of 2.5 Gy. Median follow-up was 32.4 months. Median presalvage prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 0.44 (range, 0.05-9.50). Eighteen (17%) patients received androgen deprivation after surgery or concurrently with radiation.  Results:   The actuarial freedom from biochemical failure for the entire group at 4 years was 67% ± 5.3%. An identical 67% control rate was seen at 5 years for the first 50 enrolled patients, whose median follow-up was longer at 43 months. One acute grade 3 genitourinary toxicity occurred, with no acute grade 3 gastrointestinal and no late grade 3 toxicities observed. On univariate analysis, higher Gleason score (P = .006), PSA doubling time ≤12 months (P = .03), perineural invasion (P = .06), and negative margins (P = .06) showed association with unsuccessful salvage. On multivariate analysis, higher Gleason score (P = .057) and negative margins (P = .088) retained an association with biochemical failure.  Conclusions:   Hypofractionated radiotherapy (65 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions in about 5 weeks) reduces the length of treatment by from 1-½ to 3 weeks relative to other treatment schedules commonly used, produces low rates of toxicity, and demonstrates encouraging efficacy at 4 to 5 years.

However, their association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. We evaluated the association of FGFR4 polymorphisms with risk of HCC in a study population with HCC and with/without hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in East China. We genotyped four FGFR4 SNPs (rs351855, rs641101, rs376618, and rs31777) in 1,451 Chinese subjects, including 711 patients with HCC, 368 controls with HBV infection and 372 controls without HBV infection, using the TaqMan genotyping assay. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate associations of genotypes of each SNP with HCC risk. For the rs351855 (Arg388) locus, we observed a reduced HCC risk associated with the T variant genotypes, particularly for those whose tumors with gross portal vein tumor thrombosis (gross PVTT) (OR = 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI = 0.46-0.95 for CT + TT). Such a protective effect was also observed for those with liver cirrhosis (OR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.20-0.88 for CT + TT). Clearly the T allele was associated with these conditions.

Assessment of methylation status in body fluids may complement PSA screening if the test has high specificity.  Method:   The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection of glutathione-s-transferase-π (GSTP1) methylation in body fluids (plasma, serum, whole blood, urine, ejaculate, and prostatic secretions). We conducted a comprehensive literature search on Medline (Pubmed). We included studies if they met all four of the following criteria: (1) measurement of DNA methylation in body fluids; (2) a case-control or case-only design; (3) publication in an English journal; and (4) adult subjects. Reviewers conducted data extraction independently using a standardised protocol. Twenty-two studies were finally included in this paper. Primer sequences and methylation method in each study were summarised and evaluated using meta-analyses. This paper represents a unique cross-disciplinary approach to molecular epidemiology.  Results:   The pooled specificity of GSTP1 promoter methylation measured in plasma, serum, and urine samples from negative-biopsy controls was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.80-0.95). Stratified analyses consistently showed a high specificity across different sample types and methylation methods (include both primer sequences and location). The pooled sensitivity was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.40-0.64).  Conclusions:   The pooled specificity of GSTP1 promoter methylation measures in plasma, serum, and urine was excellent and much higher than the specificity of PSA. The sensitivity of GSTP1 was modest, no higher than that of PSA.

In this study, we developed a scoring system to allow indirect calculation of utilities from the PORPUS.  Methods:   We interviewed 234 PC outpatients, including those with newly diagnosed and metastatic disease, to obtain rating scale (RS) values on 4 to 6 levels of each of the 10 attributes of the PORPUS, and on 10 corner states (worst level on 1 attribute, best on 9). Patients also completed standard gamble (SG) and RS tasks on 4 multiattribute states (impotence and pain corner states, mild and severe PC symptoms). We used the RS and SG scores for multiattribute states to determine a risk aversion function for mapping values to utilities. We then tested 15 different strategies to estimate the multiattribute utility function (MAUF), using the single attribute disutilities for each level of the 10 PORPUS attributes, and the disutilities for the corner states. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of prediction of the SG on the 4 multiattribute states was used to identify the optimal strategy and scoring system.  Results:   The optimal strategy gave an RMSE of 0.06. Comparison of mean MAUF-predicted utilities to directly elicited SG utilities for the 2 multiattribute states from patients in 2 previously published studies (n = 248 and n = 141) supported the validity of the MAUF.

The mTOR pathway is a key regulator of protein synthesis and growth and is up-regulated in many cancers. The correlation of mTOR, RAPTOR and 14-3-3σ in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and prostate cancer has not previously been investigated.  Aims:   To examine the immunohistochemical expression of phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR), RAPTOR and 14-3-3σ in HGPIN and prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) using tissue microarrays.  Methods and results:   There were contrasting immunohistochemical patterns of expression for mTOR and 14-3-3σ in HGPIN and PCa. Cochran-Armitage analysis demonstrated decreasing p-mTOR and increasing 14-3-3σ expression, progressing from PIN through GL6 and GL7 to high grade PCa. In cores with coexistent staining for 14-3-3σ and p-mTOR, the expression of each marker was restricted to different geographical areas of an individual core.  Conclusion:   The inverse correlation of p-mTOR and 14-3-3σ expression supports the role of 14-3-3σ as an inhibitor of p-mTOR activity in the prostate. The extent of 14-3-3σ and mTOR expression in an individual patient with prostate cancer would determine how effective the use of mTOR inhibitors would be as potential therapeutic agents.""","""['Sevan Evren', 'Arthur Dermen', 'Gina Lockwood', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Joan Sweet']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Clin Pathol""","""['Immunohistochemical examination of the mTORC1 pathway in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and prostatic adenocarcinomas (PCa): a tissue microarray study (TMA).', 'Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin signalling pathway in prostate cancer and its association with patient clinicopathological characteristics.', 'Microvessel density as a molecular marker for identifying high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia precursors to prostate cancer.', 'Immunohistochemical expression and localization of somatostatin receptors in normal prostate, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer and its many faces.', 'Extracellular 14-3-3sigma protein: a potential mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'STAT3-mediated MLST8 gene expression regulates cap-dependent translation in cancer cells.', 'Maternal High Fat Diet and in-Utero Metformin Exposure Significantly Impact upon the Fetal Renal Proteome of Male Mice.', 'Gene polymorphisms in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway contribute to prostate cancer susceptibility in Chinese men.']"""

In several studies, AR was overexpressed in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). However, the mechanism of AR overexpression in CRPC is not fully elucidated. Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is a pleiotropic transcription factor that is upregulated in CPRC. We aimed to elucidate the role of YB-1 in castration resistance of PCa and identify therapeutic potential of targeting YB-1. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that nuclear YB-1 expression significantly correlated with the Gleason score and AR expression in PCa tissues. In PCa cells, YB-1 regulated AR expression at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, YB-1 expression and nuclear localization were upregulated in CRPC cells. Overexpression of AR, as well as YB-1, conferred castration-resistant growth in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Conversely, knocking down YB-1 resulted in suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis, which was more efficient than knocking down AR in LNCaP cells. In other types of PCa cells, such as CRPC cells, knocking down YB-1 resulted in a significant reduction of cell growth. In conclusion, these findings suggested that YB-1 induces castration resistance in androgen-dependent PCa cells via AR expression.

Despite high prevalence rates, these disorders remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. The purpose of our study was to examine the self-report rates of anxiety and depression with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and to assess the predictive factors for these reports in cancer patients with metastatic disease.  Materials and methods:   Consecutive patients who attended the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program (RRRP) completed the ESAS as well as baseline demographic information. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors that significantly predicted anxiety and/or depression. Pearson χ(2) was used to test goodness-of-fit for categorical variables and established whether or not an observed frequency distribution differed from a predicted frequency distribution. A univariate analysis was conducted first and those variables with a P value<0.100 were included in a multivariate analysis. A score test was used to test the proportional odds assumption.  Results:   In total, 1439 patients seen in the RRRP between January 1999 and October 2009 completed ESAS questionnaires. Fifty-five per cent of patients reported at least mild symptoms of depression and 65% reported at least mild anxiety. In the univariate analysis, patients who were female, who had a lower performance status score, or primary lung cancer were more likely to report depressed and anxious feelings. Primary prostate cancer patients were significantly less likely to report depression and anxiety. Patients referred for spinal cord compression were significantly less depressed. The multivariate models showed that younger patients were significantly more anxious than older patients and females reported more anxiety than males. Patients who reported higher feelings of nausea, tiredness, drowsiness, dyspnoea, and worse appetite and overall well-being on the ESAS tool were more likely to report feelings of depression. Patients who reported higher nausea, drowsiness, dyspnoea and worse overall well-being more often reported higher feelings of anxiety.  Conclusion:   The self-report rates of anxiety and depression were consistent with published prevalence rates. However, the explained variance based on factors included in the model remains low. Additional predictive factors should be examined in future studies in this population. The ESAS tool seems to be an efficient screening tool for anxiety and depression; however, future studies should examine its correlative properties with other known screening tools in the advanced cancer population. A prospective study should be conducted to assess the severity cut-off point in which the ESAS scores most frequently lead to a further diagnosis of an anxiety or depressive disorder in the advance cancer population.""","""['N Salvo', 'L Zeng', 'L Zhang', 'M Leung', 'L Khan', 'R Presutti', 'J Nguyen', 'L Holden', 'S Culleton', 'E Chow']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Association between self-reported sleep disturbance and other symptoms in patients with advanced cancer.', 'Predictive factors for well-being in advanced cancer patients referred for palliative radiotherapy.', 'Are anxiety and depressed mood related to physical symptom burden?

Objective:   To determine whether an ultrasensitive PSA measured at 3 yr following RP is a predictor of subsequent BCR.  Design, setting, and participants:   There were 1197 consecutive men with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent an open radical retropubic prostatectomy (ORRP) at a tertiary referral academic medical center. Exclusions included 107 men (8.9%) who developed a PSA level ≥ 0.2 ng/ml or underwent hormone therapy or radiation therapy (RT) within the first 3 r after surgery, 191 men (16%) who did not undergo a 3-yr ultrasensitive PSA assay, and 98 men (8.2%) who had PSA levels ≥ 0.1 and <0.2 at 3 yr. The remaining 801 men were stratified into two groups based on their ultrasensitive PSA level at 3 yr postoperatively: group 1, which consisted of patients whose PSA was ≤ 0.04 (n = 765), and group 2, which consisted of patients whose PSA was >0.04 and <0.10 (n = 36).  Measurements:   Delayed BCR was the primary end point and represented those men in this cohort who developed a PSA level ≥ 0.2 or underwent salvage RT for a persistently rising PSA level after 3 yr of follow-up.  Results and limitations:   The 7-yr cumulative BCR-free survival rate for groups 1 and 2 was 0.957 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.920-0.978) and 0.654 (95% CI, 0.318-0.855), respectively. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, ultrasensitive PSA level at 3 yr remained the only significant predictor of delayed BCR (likelihood ratio χ(2) for full model: 27.03; df = 1; p < 0.001). A limitation of the study is that no uniform PSA assay was obtained.

During the past decade, functional imaging techniques like diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI have increasingly been included into imaging protocols, allowing extraction of intratumoral information of underlying vascular, molecular and physiological mechanisms, not available in morphological images. Separately, pre-treatment and early changes in functional parameters obtained from DWMRI and DCEMRI have shown potential in predicting therapy response. We hypothesized that the combination of several functional parameters increased the predictive power.  Methods:   We challenged this hypothesis by using an artificial neural network (ANN) approach, exploiting nonlinear relationships between individual variables, which is particularly suitable in treatment response prediction involving complex cancer data. A clinical scenario was elicited by using 32 mice with human prostate carcinoma xenografts receiving combinations of androgen-deprivation therapy and/or radiotherapy. Pre-radiation and on days 1 and 9 following radiation three repeated DWMRI and DCEMRI acquisitions enabled derivation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the vascular biomarker Ktrans, which together with tumor volumes and the established biomarker prostate-specific antigen (PSA), were used as inputs to a back propagation neural network, independently and combined, in order to explore their feasibility of predicting individual treatment response measured as 30 days post-RT tumor volumes.  Results:   ADC, volumes and PSA as inputs to the model revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.54 (p < 0.001) between predicted and measured treatment response, while Ktrans, volumes and PSA gave a correlation coefficient of 0.66 (p < 0.001). The combination of all parameters (ADC, Ktrans, volumes, PSA) successfully predicted treatment response with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   We have in a preclinical investigation showed that the combination of early changes in several functional MRI parameters provides additional information about therapy response. If such an approach could be clinically validated, it may become a tool to help identifying non-responding patients early in treatment, allowing these patients to be considered for alternative treatment strategies, and, thus, providing a contribution to the development of individualized cancer therapy.""","""['Kathrine Røe', 'Manish Kakar', 'Therese Seierstad', 'Anne H Ree', 'Dag R Olsen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging-based assessment of vascular changes and radiation response in androgen-sensitive prostate carcinoma xenografts under androgen-exposed and androgen-deprived conditions.', 'Prostate Cancer: assessing the effects of androgen-deprivation therapy using quantitative diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.', 'Assessment of early therapeutic response to sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma xenografts by dynamic contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MR imaging.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'New opportunities, MRI biomarkers in the evaluation of gynaecological cancer.', 'Biochemical recurrence prediction after radiotherapy for prostate cancer with T2w magnetic resonance imaging radiomic features.', 'Prediction of Results of Radiotherapy With Ku70 Expression and an Artificial Neural Network.', 'Early Prediction of Treatment Response of Neuroendocrine Hepatic Metastases after Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy with 90Y-DOTATOC Using Diffusion Weighted and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Translational Research in Oncology.', 'T1-Weighted Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MR Perfusion Imaging Characterizes Tumor Response to Radiation Therapy in Chordoma.']"""

The expression of UPR genes/proteins correlates with increasing progression and poor clinical outcome of several tumor types, including prostate cancer. UPR signaling can activate NF-κB, a master regulator of transcription of pro-inflammatory, tumorigenic cytokines. Previous studies have shown that Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is upregulated in several epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer, and recently Lcn2 was implicated as a key mediator of breast cancer progression. Here, we hypothesize that the tumor cell UPR regulates Lcn2 production.  Methods:   We interrogated Lcn2 regulation in murine and human prostate cancer cells undergoing pharmacological and physiological ER stress, and tested UPR and NF-κB dependence by using pharmacological inhibitors of these signaling pathways.  Results:   Induction of ER stress using thapsigargin (Tg), a canonical pharmacologic ER stress inducer, or via glucose deprivation, a physiologic ER stressor present in the tumor microenvironment, upregulates LCN2 production in murine and human prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of the UPR using 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) dramatically decreases Lcn2 transcription and translation. Inhibition of NF-κB in prostate cancer cells undergoing Tg-mediated ER stress by BAY 11-7082 abrogates Lcn2 upregulation.  Conclusions:   We conclude that the UPR activates Lcn2 production in prostate cancer cells in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Our results imply that the observed upregulation of Lipocalin 2 in various types of cancer cells may be the direct consequence of concomitant UPR activation, and that the ER stress/Lipocalin 2 axis is a potential new target for intervention in cancer progression.""","""['Navin R Mahadevan', 'Jeffrey Rodvold', 'Gonzalo Almanza', 'Antonio Fernández Pérez', 'Matthew C Wheeler', 'Maurizio Zanetti']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Epigenetic induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition by LCN2 mediates metastasis and tumorigenesis, which is abrogated by NF-κB inhibitor BRM270 in a xenograft model of lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Over-expression of lipocalin 2 promotes cell migration and invasion through activating ERK signaling to increase SLUG expression in prostate cancer.', 'Activation of the unfolded protein response bypasses trastuzumab-mediated inhibition of the PI-3K pathway.', 'The multifaceted roles of neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) in inflammation and cancer.', 'Lipocalin 2 in cancer: when good immunity goes bad.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Alcohol and Prostate Cancer: Time to Draw Conclusions.', 'Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) Deficiency Leads to Cellular Changes in Highly Metastatic Human Prostate Cancer Cell Line PC-3.', 'The non-canonical mechanism of ER stress-mediated progression of prostate cancer.', 'The Unfolded Protein Response Is a Major Driver of LCN2 Expression in BCR-ABL- and JAK2V617F-Positive MPN.']"""

Physical phantom measurements indicate that for 3D, less healthy tissue is exposed to a relatively higher dose compared to SSIMRT. The purpose is to substantiate a dose distribution in lymphocytes in-vivo and to discuss the possibility of comparing it to the physical model of total body dose distribution.  Methods:   For each technique (3D and SSIMRT), blood was taken from 20 patients before and 10 min after their first fraction of radiotherapy. The isolated leukocytes were fixed 2 hours after radiation. DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in lymphocytes' nuclei were stained immunocytochemically using the gamma-H2AX protein. Gamma-H2AX foci inside each nucleus were counted in 300 irradiated as well as 50 non-irradiated lymphocytes per patient. In addition, lymphocytes of 5 volunteer subjects were irradiated externally at different doses and processed under same conditions as the patients' lymphocytes in order to generate a calibration-line. This calibration-line assigns dose-value to mean number of gamma-H2AX foci/ nucleus. So the dose distributions in patients' lymphocytes were determined regarding to the gamma-H2AX foci distribution. With this information a cumulative dose-lymphocyte-histogram (DLH) was generated. Visualized distribution of gamma-H2AX foci, correspondingly dose per nucleus, was compared to the technical dose-volume-histogram (DVH), related to the whole body-volume.  Results:   Measured in-vivo (DLH) and according to the physical treatment-planning (DVH), more lymphocytes resulted with low-dose exposure (< 20% of the applied dose) and significantly fewer lymphocytes with middle-dose exposure (30%-60%) during Step-and-Shoot-IMRT, compared to conventional 3D conformal radiotherapy. The high-dose exposure (> 80%) was equal in both radiation techniques. The mean number of gamma-H2AX foci per lymphocyte was 0.49 (3D) and 0.47 (SSIMRT) without significant difference.  Conclusions:   In-vivo measurement of the dose distribution within patients' lymphocytes can be performed by detecting gamma-H2AX foci. In case of 3D and SSIMRT, the results of this method correlate with the physical calculated total body dose-distribution, but cannot be interpreted unrestrictedly due to the blood circulation. One possible application of the present method could be in radiation-protection for in-vivo dose estimation after accidental exposure to radiation.""","""['Felix Zwicker', 'Benedict Swartman', 'Florian Sterzing', 'Gerald Major', 'Klaus-Josef Weber', 'Peter E Huber', 'Christian Thieke', 'Jürgen Debus', 'Klaus Herfarth']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""[""In vivo measurement of dose distribution in patients' lymphocytes: helical tomotherapy versus step-and-shoot IMRT in prostate cancer."", 'Improved identification of DNA double strand breaks: γ-H2AX-epitope visualization by confocal microscopy and 3D reconstructed images.', 'gamma-H2AX foci formation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of tumor patients after local radiotherapy to different sites of the body: dependence on the dose-distribution, irradiated site and time from start of treatment.', 'Biodosimetry Based on γ-H2AX Quantification and Cytogenetics after Partial- and Total-Body Irradiation during Fractionated Radiotherapy.', 'The nuclear γ-H2AX apoptotic ring: implications for cancers and autoimmune diseases.', 'Radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks in peripheral leukocytes and therapeutic response of heel spur patients treated by orthovoltage X-rays or a\xa0linear accelerator.', 'Prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy; an exploratory study of dose-dependent biomarkers and quality of life.', 'Visualization of complex DNA double-strand breaks in a tumor treated with carbon ion radiotherapy.', 'Induction and Processing of the Radiation-Induced Gamma-H2AX Signal and Its Link to the Underlying Pattern of DSB: A Combined Experimental and Modelling Study.', ""In vivo measurement of dose distribution in patients' lymphocytes: helical tomotherapy versus step-and-shoot IMRT in prostate cancer.""]"""

Numbers of studies suggest that this signaling pathway may play an important role in Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition (EMT), however, there was no evidence that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway directly controlled the EMT occurrence. Our previous research has successfully proved that overexpression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) could induce EMT in LNCaP cells, but not in PC-3. Consistently, the expression of β-catenin protein increased in LNCaP/HIF-1α cells, but not in PC-3/HIF-1α. This study mainly aimed at exploring the essentiality and importance of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in HIF-1α-induced EMT.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) were stably transfected by recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1(-)/HIF-1α. The positive clones were selected by G418 and confirmed through western blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and indirect immunofluoesence. Then LNCaP/HIF-1α was transiently transfected with β-catenin shRNA (shRNA1 and shRNA2) and negative shRNA (shRNA-scr). The epithelial markers, mesenchymal markers, and critical proteins in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were separately detected by western blot analysis. Finally, the invasive potency of cells in different transfection group was examined by Matrgel transwell assay.  Result:   We successfully established prostate cancer cell line LNCaP/HIF-1α and LNCaP/HIF-1α/β-catenin(-). LNCaP/HIF-1α displayed high expression of mesenchymal markers and low expression of epithelial markers. However, compared with LNCaP/HIF-1α, the epithelial marker E-cadherin was increased in LNCaP/HIF-1α/β-catenin(-), whereas the expression of mesenchymal marker N-cadherin, vimentin, MMP-2 were significantly decreased. Inhibition of Wnt signal activity through β-catenin shRNA cause a reversal of EMT induced by HIF-1α in human prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   Overexpression of HIF-1α stimulates the invasion potency of human prostate carcinoma cells through EMT pathway and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway played a vital role in this process. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway might be a necessary endogenous signal that directly controlled the EMT occurrence induced by HIF-1α.""","""['Jia-Hui Zhao', 'Yong Luo', 'Yong-Guang Jiang', 'Da-Lin He', 'Chun-Ting Wu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Invest""","""['Role of beta-catenin signaling pathway in EMT of human prostate cancer induced by HIF-1alpha.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signaling enhances hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma via crosstalk with hif-1α signaling.', 'Interplay between microRNAs and WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer.', 'The biological kinship of hypoxia with CSC and EMT and their relationship with deregulated expression of miRNAs and tumor aggressiveness.', 'Hypoxia is fine-tuned by Hif-1α and regulates mesendoderm differentiation through the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway.', 'Radiation Resistance: A Matter of Transcription Factors.', 'Pancreatic Cancer Signaling Pathways, Genetic Alterations, and Tumor Microenvironment: The Barriers Affecting the Method of Treatment.', 'Wnt/β-catenin/Slug pathway contributes to tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Effects of differential distributed-JUP on the malignancy of gastric cancer.']"""

TLK1/1B interacts specifically with the chromatin assembly factor Asf1, a histone H3-H4 chaperone, and with Rad9, a protein involved in DNA repair, and these interactions are believed to be responsible for the action of TLKs in double-strand break repair and radioprotection.  Methods:   Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to analyze the expression of TLK1, TLK1B, and TLK2 in a panel of prostate cancer (CaP) cell lines. The pattern of radiotolerance in the cell lines was analyzed in parallel. DU145 and PC-3 cells were also probed with assays utilizing transfected plasmids that could be cleaved in vivo with adeno-expressed HO nuclease to assess the potential contribution of TLK1/1B in DSB repair.  Results:   This is the first report of TLKs' expression in a panel of CaP cell lines and their relationship to radioresistance. Furthermore, expression of TLK1B in non-expressing PC-3 cells rendered them highly resistant to radiation, and conversely, knockdown to TLK1/1B in expressing DU145 reduced their radiotolerance.

They aimed to develop a similar postsurgical score with improved accuracy via incorporation of pathologic data.  Methods:   A total of 3837 prostatectomy patients in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE™) national disease registry were analyzed. Cox regression was used to determine the predictive power of preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), pathologic Gleason score (pGS), surgical margins (SM), extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and lymph node invasion (LNI). Points were assigned based on the relative weights of these variables in predicting recurrence. The new postsurgical score (CAPRA-S) was tested and compared with a commonly cited nomogram with proportional hazards analysis, concordance (c) index, calibration plots, and decision-curve analysis.  Results:   Recurrence appeared in 16.8% of the men; actuarial progression-free probability at 5 years was 78.0%. The CAPRA-S was determined by adding up to 3 points for PSA, up to 3 points for pGS, 1 point each for ECE and LNI, and 2 points each for SM and SVI. The hazard ratio for each point increase in CAPRA-S score was 1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.49-1.59), indicating a 2.4-fold increase in risk for each 2-point increase in score. The CAPRA-S c-index was 0.77, substantially higher than 0.66 for the pretreatment CAPRA score and comparable to 0.76 for the nomogram.

To date, the functional importance of ALDH enzymes in prostate carcinogenesis, progression and metastasis has remained elusive. Previously we identified strong expression of ALDH7A1 in human prostate cancer cell lines, primary tumors and matched bone metastases. In this study, we evaluated whether ALDH7A1 is required for the acquisition of a metastatic stem/progenitor cell phenotype in human prostate cancer. Knockdown of ALDH7A1 expression resulted in a decrease of the α2(hi)/αv(hi)/CD44(+) stem/progenitor cell subpopulation in the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3M-Pro4. In addition, ALDH7A1 knockdown significantly inhibited the clonogenic and migratory ability of human prostate cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, a number of genes/factors involved in migration, invasion and metastasis were affected including transcription factors (snail, snail2, and twist) and osteopontin, an ECM molecule involved in metastasis. Knockdown of ALDH7A1 resulted in decreased intra-bone growth and inhibited experimentally induced (bone) metastasis, while intra-prostatic growth was not affected. In line with these observations, evidence is presented that TGF-β, a key player in cancer invasiveness and bone metastasis, strongly induced ALDH activity while BMP7 (an antagonist of TGF-β signaling) down-regulated ALDH activity. Our findings show, for the first time, that the ALDH7A1 enzyme is functionally involved in the formation of bone metastases and that the effect appeared dependent on the microenvironment, i.e., bone versus prostate.""","""['Christel van den Hoogen', 'Geertje van der Horst', 'Henry Cheung', 'Jeroen T Buijs', 'Rob C M Pelger', 'Gabri van der Pluijm']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Integrin αv expression is required for the acquisition of a metastatic stem/progenitor cell phenotype in human prostate cancer.', 'Targeting of α(v)-integrins in stem/progenitor cells and supportive microenvironment impairs bone metastasis in human prostate cancer.', 'High aldehyde dehydrogenase activity identifies tumor-initiating and metastasis-initiating cells in human prostate cancer.', 'Aldehyde dehydrogenase as a marker and functional mediator of metastasis in solid tumors.', 'Osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer cells: a hypothesis supporting the predilection of prostate cancer metastasis and growth in the bone environment.', 'Long-Chain Acyl Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase, a Key Player in Metabolic Rewiring/Invasiveness in Experimental Tumors and Human Mesothelioma Cell Lines.', 'In Vitro Evaluation of ALDH1A3-Affinic Compounds on Breast and Prostate Cancer Cell Lines as Single Treatments and in Combination with Doxorubicin.', 'Aldehyde dehydrogenase in solid tumors and other diseases: Potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.', 'ALDEFLUOR activity, ALDH isoforms, and their clinical significance in cancers.', 'Plasma metabolomics and gene regulatory networks analysis reveal the role of nonstructural SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in metabolic dysregulation in COVID-19 patients.']"""

Both disease associations remain contentious. Indeed, a recent publication has concluded that ""XMRV is unlikely to be a human pathogen"". Subsequently related but different polytropic MLV (pMLV) sequences were also reported from the blood of 86.5% of patients with CFS. and 6.8% of controls. Consequently we decided to investigate blood donors for evidence of XMRV/pMLV.  Methodology/principal findings:   Testing of cDNA prepared from the whole blood of 80 random blood donors, generated gag PCR signals from two samples (7C and 9C). These had previously tested negative for XMRV by two other PCR based techniques. To test whether the PCR mix was the source of these sequences 88 replicates of water were amplified using Invitrogen Platinum Taq (IPT) and Applied Biosystems Taq Gold LD (ABTG). Four gag sequences (2D, 3F, 7H, 12C) were generated with the IPT, a further sequence (12D) by ABTG re-amplification of an IPT first round product. Sequence comparisons revealed remarkable similarities between these sequences, endogeous MLVs and the pMLV sequences reported in patients with CFS.  Conclusions/significance:   Methodologies for the detection of viruses highly homologous to endogenous murine viruses require special caution as the very reagents used in the detection process can be a source of contamination and at a level where it is not immediately apparent.

We examined the miRNA expression profiles of 6 primary and 7 bone metastatic PCa samples by miRNA microarray analysis.

By investigating relationship of the levels of miRs-143 and -145 with clinicopathological features of PCa patients, we found down-regulations of miRs-143 and -145 were negatively correlated to bone metastasis, the Gleason score and level of free PSA in primary PCa.

Studies suggest that the VHA provides better preventive care and care for some chronic illnesses than does the private sector.  Objective:   To assess the quality of cancer care for older patients provided by the VHA versus fee-for-service Medicare.  Design:   Observational study of patients with cancer that was diagnosed between 2001 and 2004 who were followed through 2005.  Setting:   VHA and non-VHA hospitals and office-based practices.  Patients:   Men older than 65 years with incident colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer; lymphoma; or multiple myeloma.  Measurements:   Rates of processes of care for colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer; lymphoma; or multiple myeloma. Rates were adjusted by using propensity score weighting.  Results:   Compared with the fee-for-service Medicare population, the VHA population received diagnoses of colon (P < 0.001) and rectal (P = 0.007) cancer at earlier stages and had higher adjusted rates of curative surgery for colon cancer (92.7% vs. 90.5%; P < 0.010), standard chemotherapy for diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (71.1% vs. 59.3%; P < 0.001), and bisphosphonate therapy for multiple myeloma (62.1% vs. 50.4%; P < 0.001). The VHA population had lower adjusted rates of 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer treated with external-beam radiation therapy (61.6% vs. 86.0%; P < 0.001). Adjusted rates were similar for 9 other measures. Sensitivity analyses suggest that if patients with cancer in the VHA system have more severe comorbid illness than other patients, rates for most indicators would be higher in the VHA population than in the fee-for-service Medicare population.  Limitation:   This study included only older men and did not include information about performance status, severity of comorbid illness, or patient preferences.

This fundamental alteration in glucose metabolism in cancer cells enables their specific detection by positron emission tomography (PET) following i.v. injection of the glucose analogue (18)F-fluorodeoxy-glucose ((18)FDG). However, this useful imaging technique is limited by the fact that not all cancers avidly take up FDG. To identify molecular determinants of (18)FDG retention, we interrogated the transcriptomes of human-cancer cell lines and primary tumors for metabolic pathways associated with (18)FDG radiotracer uptake. From ninety-five metabolic pathways that were interrogated, the glycolysis, and several glycolysis-related pathways (pentose phosphate, carbon fixation, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, one-carbon-pool by folate) showed the greatest transcriptional enrichment. This ""FDG signature"" predicted FDG uptake in breast cancer cell lines and overlapped with established gene expression signatures for the ""basal-like"" breast cancer subtype and MYC-induced tumorigenesis in mice. Human breast cancers with nuclear MYC staining and high RNA expression of MYC target genes showed high (18)FDG-PET uptake (P < 0.005).

We examined the effect of ON 01910.Na on DNA damage-signaling molecules upstream of Cdc25C (Chk1, Chk2, and H2AX), as well as on Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 conjugated to small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (RanGAP1·SUMO1), a mitosis coordinator. Prostate cancer, lymphoma, and leukemic cells were incubated with the drug for 4, 16, or 24 hours. Cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Camptothecin and doxorubicin treatment caused activation/phosphorylation of DNA damage-responsive molecules by 4 hours, whereas ON 01910.Na did not do so. ON 01910.Na caused hyperphosphorylation of RanGAP1·SUMO1 within 4 hours that was sustained for more than 24 hours. Mild phosphorylation of Chk2 was observed only after 24-hour exposure, indicating that DNA damage response was not an initial effect of ON 01910.Na. MOLT-3 cells, synchronized by double-thymidine block, when released into a medium containing ON 01910.Na, accumulated mitotic cell number with a peak from 10 to 14 hours and remained near plateau for 20 hours, which corresponded with the time of RanGAP phosphorylation. ON 01910.Na had minimal effects on tubulin polymerization. These findings imply that ON 01910.Na neither induces DNA damage directly nor acts as a tubulin toxin. Its biological activity appears to rely on prolonged phosphorylation/hyperphosphorylation of RanGAP1·SUMO1. M-phase arrest and the consequent induction of apoptosis that follows could possibly be attributed to it.

In order to deliver higher doses to cancerous regions within these pelvic structures (i.e. prostate or cervix) while maintaining or lowering the doses to surrounding non-cancerous regions, it is critical to account for setup variation, organ motion, anatomical changes due to treatment and intra-fraction motion. In previous work, manual segmentation of the soft tissues is performed and then images are registered based on the manual segmentation. In this paper, we present an integrated automatic approach to multiple organ segmentation and nonrigid constrained registration, which can achieve these two aims simultaneously. The segmentation and registration steps are both formulated using a Bayesian framework, and they constrain each other using an iterative conditional model strategy. We also propose a new strategy to assess cumulative actual dose for this novel integrated algorithm, in order to both determine whether the intended treatment is being delivered and, potentially, whether or not a plan should be adjusted for future treatment fractions. Quantitative results show that the automatic segmentation produced results that have an accuracy comparable to manual segmentation, while the registration part significantly outperforms both rigid and nonrigid registration. Clinical application and evaluation of dose delivery show the superiority of proposed method to the procedure currently used in clinical practice, i.e. manual segmentation followed by rigid registration.""","""['Chao Lu', 'Sudhakar Chelikani', 'Xenophon Papademetris', 'Jonathan P Knisely', 'Michael F Milosevic', 'Zhe Chen', 'David A Jaffray', 'Lawrence H Staib', 'James S Duncan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Integrated segmentation and nonrigid registration for application in prostate image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Object-constrained meshless deformable algorithm for high speed 3D nonrigid registration between CT and CBCT.', 'A 3D global-to-local deformable mesh model based registration and anatomy-constrained segmentation method for image guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'A constrained non-rigid registration algorithm for use in prostate image-guided radiotherapy.', 'A review of segmentation and deformable registration methods applied to adaptive cervical cancer radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Evaluation of localized region-based segmentation algorithms for CT-based delineation of organs at risk in radiotherapy.', 'Iterative Label Denoising Network: Segmenting Male Pelvic Organs in CT From 3D Bounding Box Annotations.', 'Evaluation of an Open Source Registration Package for Automatic Contour Propagation in Online Adaptive Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Fast-switching dual energy cone beam computed tomography using the on-board imager of a commercial linear accelerator.', 'CT male pelvic organ segmentation using fully convolutional networks with boundary sensitive representation.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between 1998 and 2008 at the University of Michigan Medical Center, 718 men were consecutively treated with EBRT to at least 75 Gy. Seven definitions of high-risk prostate cancer, applying to 11-33% of patients, were evaluated. Biochemical failure (BF), salvage ADT use, metastatic progression, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Each high-risk definition was associated with increased BF (hazard ratio [HR] 2.8-3.9, p < 0.0001), salvage ADT use (HR 3.9-6.3, p < 0.0001), metastasis (HR 3.7-6.6, p < 0.0001), and PCSM (HR 3.7-16.2, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, an increasing number of high-risk features predicted worse outcome. Adjuvant ADT yielded significant reductions in both metastases (HR 0.19-0.38, p < 0.001) and PCSM (HR 0.38-0.50, p < 0.05) for all high-risk definitions (with the exception of clinical Stage T3-4 disease) but improved BF only for those with elevated Gleason scores (p < 0.03, HR 0.25-0.48). When treated with ADT and dose-escalated EBRT, patients with Gleason scores 8 to 10, without other high-risk features, had 8-year freedom from BF of 74%, freedom from distant metastases of 93%, and cause-specific survival of 92%, with salvage ADT used in 16% of patients.  Conclusion:   Adjuvant ADT results in a significant improvement in clinical progression and PCSM across multiple definitions of high-risk disease even with dose-escalated EBRT. There is a subset of patients, characterized by multiple high-risk features or the presence of Gleason Pattern 5, who remain at significant risk for metastasis and PCSM despite current treatment.""","""['Matthew H Stenmark', 'Kevin Blas', 'Schuyler Halverson', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Daniel A Hamstra']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['The addition of low-dose-rate brachytherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy decreases biochemical failure and prostate cancer death compared with dose-escalated external-beam radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Redefining high-risk prostate cancer based on distant metastases and mortality after high-dose radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Interval to biochemical failure predicts clinical outcomes in patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated by combined-modality radiation therapy.', 'Dose escalated external beam radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and conventional dose external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: do we need both?', 'High-dose conformal radiotherapy reduces prostate cancer-specific mortality: results of a meta-analysis.', 'Prognostic factors in Japanese men with high-Gleason metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dose escalation of external beam radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer-Impact of multiple high-risk factor.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy in the treatment of locally advanced, nonmetastatic prostate cancer: practical experience and a review of the clinical trial evidence.', 'Classifying high-risk versus very high-risk prostate cancer: is it relevant to outcomes of conformal radiotherapy and androgen deprivation?', 'Grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma: current state and prognostic implications.']"""

However the true potential of oncolytic viruses may only be realized fully in combination with other modalities such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy and radiotherapy. In this study, we examine the oncolytic activity of reovirus T3D and chemotherapeutic agents against human prostate cancer cell lines, with particular focus on the highly metastatic cell line PC3 and the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel. Docetaxel is the standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer and acts by disrupting the normal process of microtubule assembly and disassembly. Reoviruses have been shown to associate with microtubules and may require this association for efficient viral replication.  Methods:   The effects of reovirus and chemotherapy on in vitro cytotoxicity were investigated in PC3 and Du 145 cells and the interactions between agents were assessed by combination index analysis. An Annexin V/propidium iodide fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based assay was used to determine mode of cell death. The effects of reovirus and docetaxel administered as single agent or combination therapy were tested in vivo in a murine model. The effects of docetaxel and reovirus, alone and together, on microtubule stabilisation were investigated by Western blot analysis.  Results:   Variable degrees of synergistic cytotoxicity were observed in PC3 and Du 145 cells exposed to live reovirus and several chemotherapy agents. Combination of reovirus infection with docetaxel exposure led to increased late apoptotic/necrotic cell populations. Reovirus/docetaxel combined therapy led to reduced tumour growth and increased survival in a PC3 tumour bearing mouse model. Microtubule stabilization was enhanced in PC3 cells treated with reovirus/docetaxel combined therapy compared to other reovirus/chemotherapy combinations.  Conclusions:   The co-administration of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents with live reovirus was able to enhance cytotoxicity synergistically in vitro. The combination of docetaxel with reovirus also delayed tumour growth and improved survival in vivo. Enhanced microtubule stabilisation following this combination treatment may, in part, explain the mechanism of synergy.

Immuno-blotting, fast activated cell-based (FACE) ELISA, caspase activity, cell invasion and proliferation assays were performed to ascertain some of the signalling events involved in PCa cell proliferation and invasion.  Results:   Unlike androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells, we report for the first time that the hormone-refractory cell line, PC3, expresses DOCK2. CXCL13-mediated LNCaP and PC3 cell invasion was regulated by Akt and ERK1/2 activation in a DOCK2-independent fashion.

Phosphorylation on serine, threonine, tyrosine or histidine residues by protein kinases is the most widespread and versatile form of covalent modification. Resultant changes in activity, localization or stability of phosphoproteins drives cellular events. MS and bioinformatic analyses estimate that ~30% of intracellular proteins are phosphorylated at any given time. Multiple approaches have been developed to systematically define targets of protein kinases; however, it is likely that we have yet to catalogue the full complement of the phosphoproteome. The amino acids that surround a phosphoacceptor site are substrate determinants for protein kinases. For example, basophilic enzymes such as PKA (protein kinase A), protein kinase C and calmodulin-dependent kinases recognize basic side chains preceding the target serine or threonine residues. In the present paper we describe a strategy using peptide arrays and motif-specific antibodies to identify and characterize previously unrecognized substrate sequences for protein kinase A.

The natural EGFR ligand epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been used for this purpose, despite the risk of mitogenic effects due to EGFR activation. We have developed a fully synthetic, EGFR-targeted gene delivery system based on PEGylated linear polyethylenimine (LPEI), allowing evaluation of different EGFR-binding peptides in terms of transfection efficiency and EGFR activation. Peptide sequences directly derived from the human EGF molecule enhanced transfection efficiency with concomitant EGFR activation. Only the EGFR-binding peptide GE11, which has been identified by phage display technique, showed specific enhancement of transfection on EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells including glioblastoma and hepatoma, but without EGFR activation. EGFR targeting led to high levels of cell association of fluorescently labeled polyplexes after only 30 min of incubation. EGF pretreatment of cells induced enhanced cellular internalization of all polyplex types tested, pointing at generally enhanced macropinocytosis. EGF polyplexes diminished cell surface expression of EGFR for up to 4 hr, whereas GE11 polyplexes did not. In a clinically relevant orthotopic prostate cancer model, intratumorally injected GE11 polyplexes were superior in inducing transgene expression when compared with untargeted polyplexes.""","""['A Schäfer', 'A Pahnke', 'D Schaffert', 'W M van Weerden', 'C M A de Ridder', 'W Rödl', 'A Vetter', 'C Spitzweg', 'R Kraaij', 'E Wagner', 'Manfred Ogris']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Hum Gene Ther""","""['PolyIC GE11 polyplex inhibits EGFR-overexpressing tumors.', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted (131)I-therapy of liver cancer following systemic delivery of the sodium iodide symporter gene.', 'Structure-based peptide ligand design for improved epidermal growth factor receptor targeted gene delivery.', 'Challenges for the application of EGFR-targeting peptide GE11 in tumor diagnosis and treatment.', 'Tumor-targeted gene transfer with DNA polyplexes.', 'GE11-antigen-loaded hepatitis B virus core antigen virus-like particles efficiently bind to TNBC tumor.', 'Understanding the good and poor cell targeting activity of gold nanostructures functionalized with molecular units for the epidermal growth factor receptor.', 'The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) as theranostic gene: its emerging role in new imaging modalities and non-viral gene therapy.', 'Pre-Clinical and Clinical Applications of Small Interfering RNAs (siRNA) and Co-Delivery Systems for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy.', 'Selective sodium iodide symporter (NIS) genetherapy of glioblastoma mediatedby EGFR-targeted lipopolyplexes.']"""

We aim to determine whether these pathological factors are associated with adverse pathologic features after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP).  Methods:   All 407 patients who underwent RALP with pelvic lymphadenectomy between July 2005 and December 2009 were analyzed, retrospectively. We investigated the association of these three pathological parameters with adverse pathological findings in RALP specimen and biochemical recurrence using Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   The PNI and LVI were significantly associated with a higher pathological stage, a higher pathological Gleason score, a higher tumor volume in RALP specimen, a higher frequency of positive surgical margins, and a higher frequency of seminal vesicle invasion. In addition, PNI correlated with preoperative PSA, clinical stage, and Gleason score on needle biopsy. However, the HGPIN was not significantly associated with the clinicopathological characteristics studied. Using log-rank test, presence of PNI (P < 0.001) increases the probability of biochemical recurrence. On multivariate analysis, all three pathological parameters were not significantly correlated with biochemical recurrence.  Conclusion:   Although presence of PNI and LVI in RALP specimen correlated with multiple adverse clinicopathological factors, it did not predict biochemical recurrence, thus limiting its clinical usefulness.

Inflammation is a process that has been involved in the origin of this cancer and its inhibition has been postulated as a prophylactic and therapeutic strategy. The present study evaluated two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (meclofenamic acid and mefenamic acid) that have been studied very little in regard to cancer treatment.  Methods:   In vitro, the cytotoxic effects of meclofenamic acid and mefenamic acid were determined in human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP: androgen-dependent; and PC3: androgen-independent). In vivo trials were divided into two phases; meclofenamic acid toxicity was initially determined at different doses (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day/25 days) in BALB/c mice, after which a trial using non-toxic doses was carried out to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the drug in a PC3/nude-mouse model of human androgen-independent prostate cancer.  Results:   In vitro trials showed that only meclofenamic acid is highly cytotoxic in neoplastic prostate cells. The 5 and 10 mg/kg/day/25 day doses did not cause relevant toxicity in the BALB/c mouse trial, and so both doses were used in the nude-mouse model of cancer trial. This latter trial showed that meclofenamic acid significantly reduces tumor growth, prolongs survival, and is even capable of generating total tumor regression in up to 25% of mice treated at high dose.

When the tumors reached a moderate size, the mice were surgically castrated and treated with atorvastatin (0.02% in the diet), celecoxib (0.05% in the diet) or RW alone or in combination for 42 days. RW or celecoxib alone had a moderate inhibitory effect on the androgen-independent growth of LNCaP tumors, but atorvastatin alone had little or no effect on tumor growth. Combinations of atorvastatin and celecoxib had a stronger inhibitory effect on the formation and growth of androgen-independent LNCaP tumors than either drug alone. A combination of RW together with atorvastatin and celecoxib had the most potent inhibitory effect on the progression of LNCaP tumors to androgen independent growth. The serum concentration of atorvastatin after two weeks of oral administration of atorvastatin was 6.1 ng/ml. The serum concentration of celecoxib after treatment with dietary celecoxib for two weeks was 1090 ng/ml. The serum concentration of atorvastatin but not that of celecoxib was substantially reduced when the two drugs were given in combination. The drug concentrations observed in our animal studies are comparable or less than those commonly found in humans treated with atorvastatin or celecoxib.

The incidence of table position adjustment required to keep intrafractional uncertainty within 2.0 mm was investigated in this study.  Methods and materials:   The coordinates of the center of gravity of the three fiducial markers were measured at the start of every portal irradiation in intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with seven ports. The table position was adjusted to the planned position if the discrepancy was larger than 2.0 mm in the anterior-posterior (AP), cranial-caudal (CC), or left-right (LR) directions. In total, we analyzed 4,541 observations in 20 patients who received 70 Gy in 30 fractions (7.6 times a day on average).  Results:   The incidence of table position adjustment at 10 minutes from the initial setup of each treatment was 14.2%, 12.3%, and 5.0% of the observations in the AP, CC, and LR directions, respectively. The accumulated incidence of the table position adjustment was significantly higher at 10 minutes than at 2 minutes for AP (p = 0.0033) and CC (p = 0.0110) but not LR (p = 0.4296). An adjustment greater than 5 mm was required at least once in the treatment period in 11 (55%) patients.

Methods:   Intraoperative PDD was carried out in 16 patients with pathologically confirmed PCa by biopsy of the apex, or carrying >25% of probability of extraprostatic extension as defined by Japan PC Table. Before operation, 1.0 g of ALA was given orally. During open RRP, the resection margins inside the body were examined by PDD system with a fluorescence laparoscope. After their removal, 12 harvested prostates were divided and also investigated by PDD. Red fluorescent-positive lesions were biopsied and compared with the pathological result.  Results:   All 16 patients were fluorescence-negative inside the body, and negative margins were pathologically confirmed during PDD. Among the 43 specimens of 12 cases obtained by biopsy under PDD, 11 specimens (25.6%) were pathologically diagnosed as malignant tissue (adenocarcinoma, 10 specimens; high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, 1 specimen) and 19 specimens (44.2%) were evaluated as positive fluorescence by PDD with a sensitivity of 81.8%, a specificity of 68.8% and a predictive accuracy of 72.1%.

Here, we sought to determine the biological effects of plumbagin on signalling mechanisms during tumour angiogenesis.  Experimental approach:   The effects of plumbagin were evaluated in various in vitro assays which utilised human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) proliferation, migration and tube formation. Plumbagin was also evaluated in vivo using chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and mouse corneal micropocket models., Human colon carcinoma and prostate cancer xenograft mouse models were used to evaluate the effects of plumbagin on angiogenesis. Immunofluorescence, GST pull-down and Western blotting were employed to explore the underlying mechanisms of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)2-mediated Ras signalling pathways.  Key results:   Plumbagin not only inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation but also suppressed chicken chorioallantoic membrane neovascularzation and VEGF-induced mouse corneal angiogenesis. Moreover, plumbagin suppressed tumour angiogenesis and tumour growth in human colon carcinoma and prostate cancer xenograft mouse models. At a molecular level, plumbagin blocked the Ras/Rac/cofilin and Ras/MEK signalling pathways mediated by VEGFR2 in HUVECs.  Conclusions and implications:   Plumbagin inhibited tumour angiogenesis and tumour growth by interference with the VEGFR2-mediated Ras signalling pathway in endothelial cells.

We therefore studied patients operated for metastatic spinal cord compression in order to evaluate outcome of surgery and to find predictors of survival.  Patients and methods:   We reviewed the records of 54 consecutive patients with metastatic prostate cancer who were operated for spinal cord compression at Umeå University Hospital. The indication for surgery was neurological deficit due to spinal cord compression. 41 patients had hormone-refractory cancer and 13 patients had previously untreated, hormone-naïve prostate cancer. 29 patients were operated with posterior decompression only, and in 25 patients posterior decompression and stabilization was performed.  Results:   Preoperatively, 6/54 of patients were able to walk. 1 month after surgery, 33 patients were walking, 15 were non-ambulatory, and 6 had died. Mortality rate was 11% at 1 month, 41% at 6 months, and 59% at 1 year. In the hormone-naïve group, 8/13 patients were still alive with a median postoperative follow-up of 26 months. In the hormone-refractory group, median survival was 5 months. Patients with hormone-refractory disease and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of ≤ 60% had median survival of 2.5 months, whereas those with KPS of 70% and KPS of ≥ 80% had a median survival of 7 months and 18 months, respectively (p < 0.001). Visceral metastases were present in 12/41 patients with hormone-refractory tumor at the time of spinal surgery, and their median survival was 4 months-as compared to 10 months in patients without visceral metastases (p = 0.003). Complications within 30 days of surgery occurred in 19/54 patients.  Interpretation:   Our results indicate that patients with hormone-naive disease, and those with hormone-refractory disease with good performance status and lacking visceral metastases, may be helped by surgery for metastatic spinal cord compression.""","""['Sead Crnalic', 'Christer Hildingsson', 'Pernilla Wikström', 'Anders Bergh', 'Richard Löfvenberg', 'Anders Widmark']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Acta Orthop""","""['Predicting survival for surgery of metastatic spinal cord compression in prostate cancer: a new score.', 'Early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for neurological recovery after surgery for metastatic spinal cord compression in prostate cancer.', 'Ambulation and survival following surgery in elderly patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression.', 'Decompression surgery for spinal metastases: a systematic review.', 'The surgical management of metastatic epidural compression of the spinal cord.', 'Outcomes of Patients With Spinal Metastases From Prostate Cancer Treated With Conventionally-Fractionated External Beam Radiation Therapy.', 'Clinical outcome of surgical management for symptomatic metastatic spinal cord compression from prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic factors for overall survival in patients with spinal metastasis secondary to prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Visceral Metastasis: A Prognostic Factor of Survival in Patients with Spinal Metastases.', 'Clinical significance of traditional clinical parameters and inflammatory biomarkers for the prognosis of patients with spinal chondrosarcoma: a retrospective study of 150 patients in a single center.']"""

Xenografting is used to identify the most highly capable cells of regenerating tumors, referred to as cancer repopulating cells. Because prostate cancers (PCa's) rarely grow as xenografts, indentifying PCa repopulating cells has not been possible. Here, we report improved methods to xenograft localized primary PCa tissues using chimeric grafts with neonatal mouse mesenchyme. Xenograft survival of tumor tissue was significantly increased by neonatal mesenchyme (six of six patients, 66% of grafts, versus four of six patients, 41% of grafts) and doubled the proliferation index of xenografted cancer cells. When applied to isolated PCa cells, neonatal mesenchyme effectively reconstituted PCa's and increased xenograft survival (four of nine patients; 32% of grafts with mesenchyme and 0% without), and supported active cancer cell proliferation. Using this assay, we showed that unfractionated α2β1integrin(hi) and α2β1integrin(lo) cells from primary localized PCa's demonstrated tumor formation at comparable rates, similar to previous reports using metastatic specimens. Thus, this new protocol efficiently established tumors and enabled proliferative expansion of both intact tumor tissue and fractionated cancer cells, providing a bioassay to identify and therapeutically target PCa repopulating cells.""","""['Roxanne Toivanen', 'David M Berman', 'Hong Wang', 'John Pedersen', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Alan K Meeker', 'Stuart J Ellem', 'Gail P Risbridger', 'Renea A Taylor']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Stem Cells""","""['Hierarchical organization of prostate cancer cells in xenograft tumors: the CD44+alpha2beta1+ cell population is enriched in tumor-initiating cells.', ""Development of metastatic and non-metastatic tumor lines from a patient's prostate cancer specimen-identification of a small subpopulation with metastatic potential in the primary tumor."", 'Development of seven new human prostate tumor xenograft models and their histopathological characterization.', 'Prostate cancer stem/progenitor cells: identification, characterization, and implications.', 'Patient-Derived Prostate Cancer: from Basic Science to the Clinic.', 'The Essential Factors of Establishing Patient-derived Tumor Model.', 'Cellular and Molecular Progression of Prostate Cancer: Models for Basic and Preclinical Research.', 'Development of Prostate Cancer Organoid Culture Models in Basic Medicine and Translational Research.', 'Engineering Prostate Cancer from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells-New Opportunities to Develop Preclinical Tools in Prostate and Prostate Cancer Studies.', 'Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Prostate Cancer Development: Therapeutic Implications.']"""

Paradoxically, published prostate cancer gene expression signatures of poor prognosis share little overlap and thus do not reveal shared mechanisms. The authors hypothesize that, by analyzing gene signatures with quantitative models of protein-protein interactions, key pathways will be elucidated and shown to be shared.  Design:   The authors statistically prioritized common interactors between established cancer genes and genes from each prostate cancer signature of poor prognosis independently via a previously validated single protein analysis of network (SPAN) methodology. Additionally, they computationally identified pathways among the aggregated interactors across signatures and validated them using a similarity metric and patient survival.  Measurement:   Using an information-theoretic metric, the authors assessed the mechanistic similarity of the interactor signature. Its prognostic ability was assessed in an independent cohort of 198 patients with high-Gleason prostate cancer using Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results:   Of the 13 prostate cancer signatures that were evaluated, eight interacted significantly with established cancer genes (false discovery rate <5%) and generated a 42-gene interactor signature that showed the highest mechanistic similarity (p<0.0001). Via parameter-free unsupervised classification, the interactor signature dichotomized the independent prostate cancer cohort with a significant survival difference (p=0.009). Interpretation of the network not only recapitulated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/NF-κB signaling, but also highlighted less well established relevant pathways such as the Janus kinase 2 cascade.

Here we use immunohistochemistry to evaluate EBP50's expression in normal donor prostate (NDP), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), normal tissue adjacent to prostatic adenocarcinoma (NAC), primary prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa), and metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma (Mets).  Methods:   Tissue microarrays were immunohistochemically stained for EBP50, with the staining intensities quantified using automated image analysis software. The data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA with subsequent Tukey tests for multiple comparisons. Eleven cases of NDP, 37 cases of NAC, 15 cases of BPH, 35 cases of HGPIN, 103 cases of PCa, and 36 cases of Mets were analyzed in the microarrays.  Results:   Specimens of PCa and Mets had the lowest absolute staining for EBP50. Mets staining was significantly lower than NDP (p = 0.027), BPH (p = 0.012), NAC (p < 0.001), HGPIN (p < 0.001), and PCa (p = 0.006). Additionally, HGPIN staining was significantly higher than NAC (p < 0.009) and PCa (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this represents the first study comparing the immunohistochemical profiles of EBP50 in PCa and Mets to specimens of HGPIN, BPH, NDP, and NAC and suggests that EBP50 expression is decreased in Mets. Given that PCa also had significantly higher expression than Mets, future studies are warranted to assess EBP50's potential as a prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer.""","""['Tanner L Bartholow', 'Michael J Becich', 'Uma R Chandran', 'Anil V Parwani']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Immunohistochemical staining of slit2 in primary and metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Immunohistochemical staining of radixin and moesin in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Immunohistochemical profiles of claudin-3 in primary and metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Roles of NHERF1/EBP50 in cancer.', 'Histological markers of risk and the role of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'MINDIN Exerts Protumorigenic Actions on Primary Prostate Tumors via Downregulation of the Scaffold Protein NHERF-1.', 'New roles of the Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor 1 scaffolding protein: a review.', 'Role of the PDZ-scaffold protein NHERF1/EBP50 in cancer biology: from signaling regulation to clinical relevance.', 'Overexpression of Aquaporin-1 is a Prognostic Factor for Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Targeting of NHERF1 through RNA interference inhibits the proliferation and migration of metastatic prostate cancer cells.']"""

Methods:   The study was carried out in a group of 229 patients who had transurethral prostate biopsy performed. The patients were divided into three groups: control group (BPH), PIN group or PCa group. The patients had plasma zinc concentration determined by atomic absorption spectrometry; IGF-1, IGFBP-3 analyzed using the chemiluminescence method and tPSA detected in serum with DELFIA assay.  Results:   The studies revealed that, in PCa and PIN patients aged under 65 years, mean zinc concentrations were significantly lower compared with the control group. IGF-1 level significantly increased with decreasing level of zinc in plasma, hence a significantly decreased Zn/IGF-1 ratio. The mean tPSA concentration was significantly increased only in PCa patients of both age groups, whereas the Zn/tPSA ratio significantly decreased with increasing severity of neoplastic lesions, particularly in patients aged under 65 years. Statistical significance was noted for IGF-1:tPSA and IGFBP-3:tPSA ratios, being almost two-fold lower in the PCa patients than in the control group.  Conclusions:   A significantly lowered Zn/tPSA ratio appears to be a sensitive marker of neoplastic lesions, PCa and PIN, regardless of age. In men under 65 years, the Zn/IGF-1 ratio was reduced, depending on the stage of neoplastic lesions (PIN>PCa).

Adipose tissue can be obtained readily in amounts sufficient for ASC isolation, which can be expanded rapidly, allowing its use at low passage numbers, and can be transduced by viral and nonviral means. Our goal was to examine the potential of ASC to deliver cytokine gene therapies melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (MDA-7) or pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF) to cancer cells. These novel cytokines are a potent proapoptotic and an antiangiogenesis mediator, respectively, with potential as antitumor agents. Expression of cytokine therapies did not adversely affect ASC biology, and these cells were still able to differentiate and retain normal viability. The ASC cytokine therapies were efficient in reducing tumor cell growth in coculture and also in suppressing in vitro angiogenesis phenotypes. We also observed that ASC retained their innate ability to migrate toward tumor cells in coculture, and this ability could be blocked by inhibition of CXCR4 signaling. The ASC were found to be nontumorigenic in vitro using a soft agar assay, as well as in vivo, utilizing 2 prostate cancer xenograft models. The ASC-MDA7 only reduced tumor growth in the TRAMP-C2-Ras (TC2Ras) prostate cancer model. The ASC-PEDF, however, reduced growth in both the TC2Ras and the PC3 highly aggressive prostate cancer models, and it was able to completely prevent prostate tumor establishment in vivo. In conclusion, ASC expressing PEDF and MDA7 could effectively reduce prostate tumor growth in vivo, suggesting ASC-cytokine therapies might have translational applications, especially the PEDF modality.""","""['Olga Zolochevska', 'Gang Yu', 'Jeffrey M Gimble', 'Marxa L Figueiredo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Stem Cells Dev""","""['Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cell pigment epithelium-derived factor cytotherapy modifies genetic and epigenetic profiles of prostate cancer cells.', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells Engineered to Secrete Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor Inhibit Tumor Metastasis and the Formation of Malignant Ascites in a Murine Colorectal Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Model.', 'Pigment epithelium-derived factor expression prolongs survival and enhances the cytotoxicity of low-dose chemotherapy in castration-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC) - basics and therapeutic approaches in otorhinolaryngology.', 'Adenovector pigment epithelium-derived factor (AdPEDF) delivery for wet age-related macular degeneration.', 'NFκB-Mediated Mechanisms Drive PEDF Expression and Function in Pre- and Post-Menopausal Oestrogen Levels in Breast Cancer.', 'Immunotherapy by mesenchymal stromal cell delivery of oncolytic viruses for treating metastatic tumors.', 'Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor and Sex Hormone-Responsive Cancers.', 'Enhancement of the Therapeutic Capacity of Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Genetic Modification: A Systematic Review.', 'Ligand-Mediated Targeting of Cytokine Interleukin-27 Enhances Its Bioactivity In\xa0Vivo.']"""

Despite the reproducibility of these associations, the molecular mechanism for most of these SNPs has not been well elaborated as most lie within non-coding regions of the genome. Androgens play a key role in prostate carcinogenesis. Recently, using ChIP-on-chip technology, 22,447 androgen receptor (AR) binding sites have been mapped throughout the genome, greatly expanding the genomic regions potentially involved in androgen-mediated activity.  Methodology/principal findings:   To test the hypothesis that sequence variants in AR binding sites are associated with PCa risk, we performed a systematic evaluation among two existing PCa GWAS cohorts; the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) study population. We demonstrate that regions containing AR binding sites are significantly enriched for PCa risk-associated SNPs, that is, more than expected by chance alone. In addition, compared with the entire genome, these newly observed risk-associated SNPs in these regions are significantly more likely to overlap with established PCa risk-associated SNPs from previous GWAS. These results are consistent with our previous finding from a bioinformatics analysis that one-third of the 33 known PCa risk-associated SNPs discovered by GWAS are located in regions of the genome containing AR binding sites.  Conclusions/significance:   The results to date provide novel statistical evidence suggesting an androgen-mediated mechanism by which some PCa associated SNPs act to influence PCa risk.

Stromoglandular pattern was the most common histological type of BPH accounting for 72.2 %( 393) of the cases. Malignant tumours constituted 28.9% of all prostatic biopsies. Most (93.7%) of these malignancies were seen in trucut biopsies. Adenocarcinoma accounted for 99.1% of the total 222 malignant tumours. It showed an age range of 40 to 98 years, a mean age of 66 years and peak prevalence in the 60-69 year age group. Gleason score nine was the most frequent (16.8%) in occurrence. Most adenocarcinomas were poorly differentiated (40%). Incidental carcinoma was seen in 4.2% of prostatectomy samples. High grade PIN was seen in 19.1% of adenocarcinoma cases. The most common inflammatory lesion was chronic non-specific prostatitis accounting for 76.4% of all inflammatory lesions. Malignant and benign lesions were accountable for PSA levels of 1 to 49.9ng/ml while values of 50ng/ml and above were seen exclusively in malignant lesions.  Conclusion:   Prostatic lesions constitute a significant source of morbidity among adult males in Lagos. Adenocarcinoma is the commonest histologic subtype of prostatic cancer and most are of poorly differentiated variety. Elevated levels of tPSA in Nigerian males may be as a result prostate cancer, BPH or BPH with prostatitis. PSA should in our opinion be used as a component of a strategy integrating multiple diagnostic approaches for prostate cancer screening and not to be used alone in our environment.""","""['C C Anunobi', 'O R Akinde', 'S O Elesha', 'A O Daramola', 'K H Tijani', 'R W Ojewola']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Niger Postgrad Med J""","""['Significance of focal proliferative atrophy lesions in prostate biopsy cores that test negative for prostate carcinoma.', 'Total PSA, PSA density and biopsy Gleason score in predicting the pathologic stage of prostate cancer.', 'Volume-based evaluation of serum assays for new prostate-specific antigen isoforms in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'The dynamics of prostate-specific antigen in benign and malignant diseases of the prostate.', 'Expectant management of localized prostate cancer.', 'Mapping Evidence on the Burden of Breast, Cervical, and Prostate Cancers in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Scoping Review.', 'High mortality risk of prostate cancer patients in Asia and West Africa: A systematic review.', 'A Review of Localized Prostate Cancer: An African Perspective.', 'A Clinicopathological Profile of Prostate Cancer in Trinidad and Tobago.', 'A histopathological study of prostate lesions in Lagos, Nigeria: A private practice experience.']"""

However, whether osteogenesis is necessary for prostate tumor growth in bone is unknown. Recently, 2 xenografts, MDA-PCa-118b and MDA-PCa-133, were generated from prostate cancer bone metastases. When implanted subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, MDA-PCa-118b induced strong ectopic bone formation while MDA-PCa-133 did not. To identify the factors that are involved in bone formation, we compared the expression of secreted factors (secretome) from MDA-PCa-118b and MDA-PCa-133 by cytokine array. We found that the osteogenic MDA-PCa-118b xenograft expressed higher levels of bone morphogenetic protein BMP4 and several cytokines including interleukin-8, growth-related protein (GRO), and CCL2. We showed that BMP4 secreted from MDA-PCa-118b contributed to about a third of the osteogenic differentiation seen in MDA-PCa-118b tumors. The conditioned media from MDA-PCa-118b induced a higher level of osteoblast differentiation, which was significantly reduced by treatment with BMP4 neutralizing antibody or the small molecule BMP receptor 1 inhibitor LDN-193189. BMP4 did not elicit an autocrine effect on MDA-PCa-118b, which expressed low to undetectable levels of BMP receptors. Treatment of SCID mice bearing MDA-PCa-118b tumors with LDN-193189 significantly reduced tumor growth.

It encodes 2 tumor-associated antigens, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), and is derived from the highly attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus stock known as MVA-BN. Past work has shown that the immunogenicity of antigens can be improved by targeting their localization to exosomes, which are small, 50- to 100-nm diameter vesicles secreted by most cell types. Exosome targeting is achieved by fusing the antigen to the C1C2 domain of the lactadherin protein. To test whether exosome targeting would improve the immunogenicity of PSA and PAP, 2 additional versions of MVA-BN-PRO were produced, targeting either PSA (MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2) or PAP (MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2) to exosomes, while leaving the second transgene untargeted. Treatment of mice with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 led to a striking increase in the immune response against PAP. Anti-PAP antibody titers developed more rapidly and reached levels that were 10- to 100-fold higher than those for mice treated with MVA-BN-PRO. Furthermore, treatment with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 increased the frequency of PAP-specific T cells 5-fold compared with mice treated with MVA-BN-PRO. These improvements translated into a greater frequency of tumor rejection in a PAP-expressing solid tumor model. Likewise, treatment with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 increased the antigenicity of PSA compared with treatment with MVA-BN-PRO and resulted in a trend of improved antitumor efficacy in a PSA-expressing tumor model. These experiments confirm that targeting antigen localization to exosomes is a viable approach for improving the therapeutic potential of MVA-BN-PRO in humans.""","""['Ryan B Rountree', 'Stefanie J Mandl', 'James M Nachtwey', 'Katie Dalpozzo', 'Lisa Do', 'John R Lombardo', 'Peter L Schoonmaker', 'Kay Brinkmann', 'Ulrike Dirmeier', 'Reiner Laus', 'Alain Delcayre']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Dual antigen target-based immunotherapy for prostate cancer eliminates the growth of established tumors in mice.', 'Prospects and limitations of recombinant poxviruses for prostate cancer immunotherapy.', 'Plasmid DNA vaccine encoding prostatic acid phosphatase is effective in eliciting autologous antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.', 'Partially circumventing peripheral tolerance for oncogene-specific prostate cancer immunotherapy.', 'CpG oligonucleotide as an adjuvant for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Current and prospective strategies for advancing the targeted delivery of CRISPR/Cas system via extracellular vesicles.', 'Drug target therapy and emerging clinical relevance of exosomes in meningeal tumors.', 'The emerging role of exosomes in innate immunity, diagnosis and therapy.', 'Engineered Exosomes for Tumor-Targeted Drug Delivery: A Focus on Genetic and Chemical Functionalization.', 'Exosome-Based Smart Drug Delivery Tool for Cancer Theranostics.']"""

The high level of OPN expression in prostate cells is associated with malignancy and reduced survival of the patient. Recent studies on prostate cancer (PCa) tissue have revealed recurrent genomic rearrangements involving the fusion of the 5' untranslated region of a prostate-specific androgen-responsive gene with a gene coding for transcription factors from the ETS family. The most frequently identified fusion gene is TMPRSS2:ERG, which causes ERG protein overexpression in PCa cells. ERG is a transcription factor linked to skeletogenesis. This study was designed to test whether ERG and the product of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene modulate OPN gene expression in PCa cells. To characterize ERG and TMPRSS2:ERG transcriptional activity of OPN, we focused on ETS binding sites (EBS) localized in conserved regions of the promoter. Using in vitro and in vivo molecular assays, we showed that ERG increases OPN expression and binds to an EBS (nt -115 to -118) in the OPN promoter. Moreover, stable transfection of prostate tumor cell lines by TMPRSS2:ERG upregulates endogenous OPN expression. Finally, in human prostate tumor samples, detection of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene was significantly associated with OPN overexpression. Taken together, these data suggest that OPN is an ERG-target gene in PCa where the abnormal expression of the transcription factor ERG, due to the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion, disturbs the expression of genes that play an important role in PCa cells and associated metastases.""","""['Sébastien Flajollet', 'Tian V Tian', 'Anne Flourens', 'Nathalie Tomavo', 'Arnauld Villers', 'Edith Bonnelye', 'Sébastien Aubert', 'Xavier Leroy', 'Martine Duterque-Coquillaud']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene expression alters chemo- and radio-responsiveness in cell culture models of androgen independent prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG fusion by translocation or interstitial deletion is highly relevant in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, but is bypassed in late-stage androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'Micro-RNA-204 Participates in TMPRSS2/ERG Regulation and Androgen Receptor Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'The oncogene ERG: a key factor in prostate cancer.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'PGC1 alpha coactivates ERG fusion to drive antioxidant target genes under metabolic stress.', 'HIC1 (Hypermethylated in Cancer 1) modulates the contractile activity of prostate stromal fibroblasts and directly regulates CXCL12 expression.', 'hPCL3S promotes proliferation and migration of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Osteopontin as a Link between Inflammation and Cancer: The Thorax in the Spotlight.', 'Targeting Transcription Factors for Cancer Treatment.']"""

We have developed/refined methods for enrichment of methylated genomic fragments using the methyl-binding domain of the human MBD2 protein (MBD2-MBD) followed by analysis with high-density tiling microarrays. This MBD-chip approach was used to characterize DNA methylation patterns across all non-repetitive sequences of human chromosomes 21 and 22 at high-resolution in normal and malignant prostate cells.  Results:   Examining this data using computational methods that were designed specifically for DNA methylation tiling array data revealed widespread methylation of both gene promoter and non-promoter regions in cancer and normal cells. In addition to identifying several novel cancer hypermethylated 5' gene upstream regions that mediated epigenetic gene silencing, we also found several hypermethylated 3' gene downstream, intragenic and intergenic regions. The hypermethylated intragenic regions were highly enriched for overlap with intron-exon boundaries, suggesting a possible role in regulation of alternative transcriptional start sites, exon usage and/or splicing. The hypermethylated intergenic regions showed significant enrichment for conservation across vertebrate species. A sampling of these newly identified promoter (ADAMTS1 and SCARF2 genes) and non-promoter (downstream or within DSCR9, C21orf57 and HLCS genes) hypermethylated regions were effective in distinguishing malignant from normal prostate tissues and/or cell lines.

In a hospital-based case control study in northern India, we genotyped 192 PCa patients and 225 unrelated healthy controls for caspase-5 (G>C) (T>C) and caspase-3 (G>A) polymorphisms using amplification refractory mutation system and polymerase chain restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. Data were statistically analyzed and variant genotype GG of caspase-3 demonstrated increased risk for PCa (odds ratio [OR]=2.72, p=0.005). Similarly variant allele carrier (AG+GG) (OR=1.53, p=0.034) and G allele (OR=1.54, p=0.005) were also statistically associated with PCa risk. High risk for PCa was also observed with respect to caspase-5 (CC) diplotypes (OR=21.67, p=0.012, Pc=0.048). We observed significantly enhanced risk for PCa due to interaction between caspase-3 and -5 gene polymorphisms. In association of genotypes with clinical characteristics, heterozygous TC genotype of caspase-5 (T>C) conferred risk with high Gleason grade tumor (OR=2.35, p=0.042). In case-only analysis, interaction of environmental risk factors and genotypes did not further modulate the risk for PCa.

We used this adenovirus vector to test the concept that multiantigenic effector T cells could be generated simultaneously following a single immunization.  Method:   To perform the rAd5 constructs, we selected a combination of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) genes based on their restricted distribution within the prostate tissue and their association with the development and progression of prostate cancer.  Results:   Immunization of mice with rAd5 vector carrying a fusion construct of PSA and PSCA (Ad5-PSA/PSCA) simultaneously induced the expansion of anti-PSA and anti-PSCA CD8 T cells, as measured by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ. The antigen-specific T-cell responses that developed were efficient in eliminating the target cells expressing cognate antigens measured by an in vivo cytotoxic T-cell assay. The in vivo tumor growth study showed that immunization of mice with Ad5-PSA/PSCA vaccine induced strong antitumor immunity when challenged with mouse prostate tumor cell lines (RM11) expressing human PSA (RM11/PSA). To further analyze the impact on therapeutic efficacy of Ad5-PSA/PSCA vaccine against the tumor cells expressing PSA and PSCA (RM11-PSA/PSCA) antigens, we injected mice with Ad5-PSA/PSCA vaccine. The vaccine inhibited the growth of established tumors with 80% of the mice becoming tumor free. These data provide useful information that antigen-specific effector T cells can be generated simultaneously and that their additive antitumor effect has the potential to eliminate the growth of established tumors.

Methods:   Age-specific incidence rates were modelled as a function of age, period and birth cohort using the NORDPRED software to predict future cancer incidence rates and numbers of cancer cases for the period 2007-11 and 2012-16 in Chennai. Predictions for Tamil Nadu state were computed using a weighted average of the predicted incidence rates of the Chennai registry and current rates in Dindigul district. RESULTS; In Chennai, the total cancer burden is predicted to increase by 32% by 2012-16 compared with 2002-06, with 19% due to changes in cancer risk and a further 13% due to the impact of demographic changes. The incidence of cervical cancer is projected to drop by 46% in 2015 compared with current levels, while a 100% increase in future thyroid cancer incidence is predicted. Among men, a 21% decline in the incidence of oesophageal cancer by 2016 contrasts with the 42% predicted increase in prostate cancer. The annual cancer burden predicted for 2012-16 is 6100 for Chennai, translating to 55 000 new cases per year statewide (in Tamil Nadu).

In order to improve overall survival, novel treatment strategies that are based upon specific molecular mechanisms that prolong the androgen-dependent state and that are useful for androgen-independent disease need to be identified. Both epidemiological as well as preclinical data suggest that omega-3 fatty acids are effective primary tumor prevention agents; however, their efficacy at preventing and treating refractory prostate cancer has not been as thoroughly investigated. We used an in vitro model of androgen ablation to determine the effect of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids on the progression to an androgen-independent state. The omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were able to prevent progression of LNCaP cells while the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) actually promoted cell growth under conditions of hormone depletion.

After classifying studies by geographic areas, carriers of ≥ 20 repeats had 11% decreased risk in populations from USA, 53% from Europe, and 20% from Asia (P > 0.05), whereas comparison of ≥ 23 repeats with others generated a significant prediction in European populations (OR = 1.17; P = 0.039). Stratification by study designs revealed no material changes in risk estimation. Meta-regression analysis found no significant sources of between-study heterogeneity for age, study design and geographic region for all comparisons. There was no identified publication bias.

Such information may guide individually tailored treatment or observation strategies, and help to avoid overtreatment. We retrospectively analyzed baseline parameters including information on comorbidity and medication use among 177 patients (median age at diagnosis 70 years). Actuarial survival analyses were performed. During the first 3 years, two patients (1.1%) died from progressive prostate cancer after they had developed distant metastases. The risk of dying from other causes (3.4%) was numerically higher, although not to a statistically significant degree. Six patients who died from other causes had age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) scores ≥5 (CCI is a sum score where each comorbid condition is assigned with a score depending on the risk of dying associated with this condition). The main comorbidity was cardiovascular disease. The two statistically significant predictive factors were medication use and age-adjusted CCI score ≥5 (univariate analysis). However, medication use was not an independent factor as all patients with age-adjusted CCI score ≥5 also used at least one class of medication. Median survival was 30 months in patients with age-adjusted CCI score ≥5. Prediction of non-prostate cancer death may be important to prevent overtreatment in patients who are more threatened by comorbidity. Our data suggest that simple parameters such as use of medications vs. none, or presence of serious cardiac disease vs. none, are not sufficient, and that age-adjusted CCI scores outperform the other factors included in our analysis.""","""['Carsten Nieder', 'Astrid Dalhaug', 'Adam Pawinski', 'Gro Aandahl', 'Jan Norum']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""ScientificWorldJournal""","""['Impact of Charlson comorbidity index varies by age in patients with prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy: a competing risk regression analysis.', 'Prediction of mortality after radical prostatectomy by Charlson comorbidity index.', 'Charlson Comorbidity Index is a predictor of outcomes in incident hemodialysis patients and correlates with phase angle and hospitalization.', 'Impact of comorbidity on treatment and prognosis of prostate cancer patients: a population-based study.', 'Hormonal therapy use for prostate cancer and mortality in men with coronary artery disease-induced congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction.', 'Assessment of Current Mental Health Status in a Population-Based Sample of Canadian Men With and Without a History of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: An Analysis of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA).', 'Consensus statements on the management of clinically localized prostate cancer from the Hong Kong Urological Association and the Hong Kong Society of Uro-Oncology.', 'Age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index is a significant prognostic factor for long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a Bayesian model averaging approach.', 'Impact of comorbidity in elderly prostate cancer patients treated with brachytherapy.', 'Multimorbidity: an issue of growing importance for oncologists.']"""

We have previously developed a modified TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model where prostate cancer cells express the T-cell epitope SIYRYYGL (SIY) recognized by CD8 T cells expressing the 2C T-cell receptor (TCR) (referred to as TRP-SIY mice). In TRP-SIY mice, activated 2C T cells rapidly become tolerant following infiltration into the prostate tumor. In this study, we show that tolerant 2C T cells persist in the prostate tumor of TRP-SIY mice by proliferating slowly in a tumor-dependent, but antigen-, interleukin (IL)-7- and IL-15-independent manner. We also show that disappearance of 2C T cells from the lymphoid organs of TRP-SIY mice are due to antigen-induced T-cell contraction rather than altered trafficking or generalized T-cell depletion in the mice. Finally, we show that clonal T cells unreactive to SIY are equally capable of persisting in the prostate tumor. These findings suggest that while functional tolerance of TILs is induced by antigen, persistence of tolerant TILs in the tumor tissue is mediated by a novel mechanism: slow proliferation independent of antigen and homeostatic cytokines.

Although phorbol ester-induced apoptotic pathways have been well characterized, little is known of the pro-survival pathways modulated by these agents. We now provide experimental evidence to indicate that protein kinase D (PKD) promotes survival signals in LNCaP cells in response to PMA treatment. Knockdown of endogenous PKD1 or PKD2 decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB)-dependent transcriptional activities and potentiated PMA-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of wild-type PKD1 enhanced ERK1/2 activity and suppressed PMA-induced apoptosis. PMA caused rapid activation, followed by progressive downregulation of endogenous PKD1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The downregulation of PKD1 was dependent on the activity of protein kinase C (PKC), but not that of PKD. Selective depletion of endogenous PKC isoforms revealed that both PKCδ and PKCε were required for PKD1 activation and subsequent downregulation. Further analysis showed that the downregulation of PKD1 was mediated by a ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, inhibition of which correlated to increased cell survival. In summary, our data indicate that PKD1 is activated and downregulated by PMA through a PKC-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, and the activation of PKD1 or PKD2 counteracts PMA-induced apoptosis by promoting downstream ERK1/2 and NF-κB activities in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.""","""['Jun Chen', 'Karthik V Giridhar', 'Liyong Zhang', 'Shuping Xu', 'Q Jane Wang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Protein kinase D3 (PKD3) contributes to prostate cancer cell growth and survival through a PKCepsilon/PKD3 pathway downstream of Akt and ERK 1/2.', 'Protein kinase C promotes apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells through activation of p38 MAPK and inhibition of the Akt survival pathway.', 'Phorbol ester-induced apoptosis of C4-2 cells requires both a unique and a redundant protein kinase C signaling pathway.', 'Molecular mechanisms of protein kinase C-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Emerging roles of protein kinase D1 in cancer.', 'Potential role for protein kinase D inhibitors in prostate cancer.', 'Bioactive Compounds and Their Impact on Protein Modification in Human Cells.', 'Golgi Complex: A Signaling Hub in Cancer.', 'Targeting Protein Kinases and Epigenetic Control as Combinatorial Therapy Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Protein Kinase D: A Potential Therapeutic Target in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   We identified 585 patients who met HR criteria by 2010 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, who were treated with EBRT consisting of ≥74 Gy from 1996 to 2008 at Cleveland Clinic, of whom 95% received ADT. We analyzed biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).  Results:   The median EBRT dose was 78 Gy, and median ADT duration was 6 months. At 10 years, the bRFS was 50.2%, the DMFS was 71.6%, and the PCSM was 14.4%. On multivariate analysis, significant predictors of bRFS were biopsy Gleason score (bGS) of 8 to 10, stage T3, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration; predictors of DMFS were bGS of 8 to 10 and stage T3; the only predictor of PCSM was bGS of 8 to 10. The duration of ADT was not predictive of any endpoint. We identified an unfavorable high-risk (UHR) group of stage T1-T2 tumors consisting of bGS of 8 with PSA of >10 ng/ml or bGS of 9 to 10 with any PSA level; the remaining clinically localized cancers comprised the favorable high-risk (FHR) group. Comparing FHR, UHR, and stage T3 groups, the DMFS rates were 81.4%, 57.8%, and 59.1% (p < 0.0001), and the PCSM rates were 7.5%, 28.4%, and 20.6% at 10 years, respectively (p = 0.006).

On the other hand, low-concentrations of BPs have been reported to increase cellular viability in several types of tumor cells. Therefore, we focused on the effect of BPs on cellular aggressiveness of malignant bone tumors at low concentrations. MTS assay was performed using osteosarcoma cell lines MG63 and HOS, fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, and prostate cancer cell line PC3. All the cell lines showed toxicity at high concentrations. On the other hand, at lower concentrations, the cellular viabilities of HOS and MG63 were rather higher than those of untreated controls. Since this tendency was most evident, HOS was used for further assays, including cellular motility, bone resorption activity, and cathepsin K activity. The low-concentration of alendronate enhanced cellular viability and motility, which correlated with the expression of connexin 43 at the mRNA and protein levels.

We examine biopsy characteristics of men with high-grade PC at RP to better select those who may benefit from surgery.  Materials and methods:   A total of 1,174 men from our Institutional Database (1982-2010) had Gleason 8-10 cancer at RP. Their demographic and prostate biopsy characteristics were compared among those with disease defined as favorable (pT2 or pT3a) vs. unfavorable (pT3b or N1). Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of unfavorable disease. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine survival outcomes.  Results:   Biopsy data were available for 1,157 men (median cores 12 [2-20]); 779 (66.4%) favorable, 394 (33.6%) unfavorable; 102 (8.7%), 515 (44.1%), and 552 (47.2%) were low, intermediate, and high-risk. For favorable and unfavorable cases, 10-year BFS was 40.0% and 5.7% (P < 0.001) and CSS was 84.9% and 60.3% (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that PSA ≥ 20 and perineural invasion (PNI) at biopsy increased the likelihood of unfavorable, high-grade disease. Considering PSA ≥ 20 and PNI as adverse features, 23.7%, 40.1%, and 71.4% of patients with none, 1, or 2 adverse features had unfavorable, high-Gleason PC (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   High-Gleason PC was not uniformly associated with poor outcomes after RP, though men with unfavorable (pT3b/N1) disease fared poorly.

Methods:   CTCs were isolated from peripheral blood (10 mL) using the CellSearch system and reagents (Veridex). A CTC is defined as EpCAM+, cytokeratin+, CD45-, and is positive for the nuclear stain DAPI. The normal reference range for CellSearch is <2 CTC/7.5 mL of blood. Hazard ratios adjusted for known prognostic factors were estimated by Cox regression.  Results:   Two-hundred sixteen patients had baseline CTC measurements of which 111 (51.4%) were randomized to the trabectedin+PLD arm; 143/216 patients (66.2%) were platinum-sensitive.

Urologists are involved in the management of men's prostate health. In practice, nonurology providers are more likely to see patients in the screening setting.  Methods:   Survey questions were designed to evaluate a nonurologist's approach to PSA screening. The survey instrument was distributed to physicians and physician extenders in fields of internal medicine and family practice at a tertiary-care medical center.  Results:   Of 116 nonurologist providers, 86 (74%) completed the survey. There was variability with respect to the age at which to screen the index patient (asymptomatic white man without a prostate cancer family history): 16% initiated screening at 41-50 years of age and 77% at 51-60 years. Additionally, heterogeneity was found with regard to categorizing an elevated PSA level, with 62% of providers using an absolute PSA cutoff of >4 ng/mL and only 27% citing age-specific criteria. When diagnosing an asymptomatic man with an elevated PSA level, most providers will recheck PSA in 3-6 months (38%) or initiate a trial of empiric antibiotics (30%). Only a smaller fraction will refer the patient to a urologist (21%) or repeat PSA test immediately within 2-4 weeks (11%).  Conclusions:   We noted variability in PSA management patterns by nonurologists.

PTHrP expression is suppressed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D). The aim of this study was to identify the pathways via which 1,25D exerts these effects. Our main findings are that 1,25D regulates PTHrP levels via multiple pathways in PC-3 and C4-2 (human prostate cancer) cell lines, and regulation is dependent on VDR expression. The human PTHrP gene has three promoters (P); PC-3 cells preferentially utilize P2 and P3, while C4-2 cells preferentially utilize P1. 1,25D regulates PTHrP transcriptional activity from both P1 and P3. The 1,25D-mediated decrease in PTHrP mRNA levels also involves a post-transcriptional pathway since 1,25D decreases PTHrP mRNA stability. 1,25D also suppresses PTHrP expression directly at the protein level by increasing its degradation. Regulation of PTHrP levels is dependent on VDR expression, as using siRNAs to deplete VDR expression negates the 1,25D-mediated downregulation of PTHrP expression.

This tract is encoded by a CAG trinucleotide repeat and varies from 8 to 33 codons in the healthy population. Q-tract length is inversely correlated with AR transcriptional activity in vitro, but whether endogenous androgen action is affected is not consistently supported by results of clinical and epidemiological studies. To test whether Q-tract length influences androgen sensitivity in vivo, we examined effects of controlled androgen exposure in ""humanized"" mice with hAR knock-in alleles bearing 12, 21 or 48 CAGs. Mature male mice were analyzed before or 2weeks after orchidectomy, with or without a subdermal dihydrotestosterone (DHT) implant to attain stable levels of this non-aromatizable androgen. The validity of this DHT clamp was demonstrated by similar serum levels of DHT and its two primary 3αDiol and 3βDiol metabolites, regardless of AR Q-tract length. Q-tract length was inversely related to DHT-induced suppression of castrate serum LH (p=0.005), as well as seminal vesicle (SV) weight (p=0.005) and prostate lobe weights (p<0.006). This confirms that the hAR Q-tract polymorphism mediates in vivo tissue androgen sensitivity by impacting negative hypothalamic feedback and trophic androgen effects on target organs.

Methods and materials:   This single-institution prospective randomized controlled trial compared naftopidil, tamsulosin, and silodosin in patients undergoing PI. Patients were randomized and received either naftopidil, tamsulosin, or silodosin. Treatment began 1 day after PI and continued for 1 year. The primary efficacy variables were the changes in total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and postvoid residual urine (PVR). The secondary efficacy variables were changes in IPSS storage score and IPSS voiding score from baseline to set points during the study (1, 3, 6, and 12 months).  Results:   Two hundred twelve patients were evaluated in this study between June 2006 and February 2009: 71, 70, and 71 patients in the naftopidil, tamsulosin, and silodosin groups, respectively. With respect to the primary efficacy variables, the mean changes in the total IPSS at 1 month after PI in the naftopidil, tamsulosin, and silodosin groups were +10.3, +8.9, and +7.5, respectively. There were significantly greater decreases with silodosin than naftopidil at 1 month in the total IPSS. The mean changes in the PVR at 6 months were +14.6, +23.7, and +5.7 mL in the naftopidil, tamsulosin, and silodosin groups, respectively; silodosin showed a significant improvement in the PVR at 6 months vs. tamsulosin. With respect to the secondary efficacy variables, the mean changes in the IPSS voiding score at 1 month in the naftopidil, tamsulosin, and silodosin groups were +6.5, +5.6, and +4.5, respectively; silodosin showed a significant improvement in the IPSS voiding score at 1 month vs. naftopidil.

Methods and materials:   Between February 2002 and December 2009, 977 patients received five-beam IMRT for prostate cancer to a dose of 76 Gy in 35 fractions combined with fiducial markers for position verification. In July 2008, the diet, consisting of dietary guidelines to obtain regular bowel movements and to reduce intestinal gas by avoiding certain foods and air swallowing, was introduced to reduce the prostate motion. The intrafraction prostate movement was determined from the portal images of the first segment of all five beams. Clinically relevant intrafraction motion was defined as ≥50% of the fractions with an intrafraction motion outside a range of 3 mm.  Results:   A total of 739 patients were treated without the diet and 105 patients were treated with radiotherapy after introduction of the diet. The median and interquartile range of the average intrafraction motion per patient was 2.53 mm (interquartile range, 2.2-3.0) without the diet and 3.00 mm (interquartile range, 2.4-3.5) with the diet (p < .0001). The percentage of patients with clinically relevant intrafraction motion increased statistically significant from 19.1% without diet to 42.9% with a diet (odds ratio, 3.18; 95% confidence interval, 2.07-4.88; p < .0001).

To date, none of these studies has compared distant metastases and CSS in brachytherapy patients. In this study, we evaluate such parameters in a consecutive cohort of brachytherapy patients.  Methods and materials:   From April 1995 to June 2007, 1,840 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with brachytherapy. Risk groups were stratified according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (www.nccn.org) guidelines. Subgroups of 658, 893, and 289 patients were assigned to low, intermediate, and high-risk categories. Median follow-up was 7.2 years. Along with brachytherapy implantation, 901 (49.0%) patients received supplemental XRT, and 670 (36.4%) patients received androgen deprivation therapy (median duration, 4 months). The mode of failure (biochemical, local, or distant) was determined for each patient for whom therapy failed. Cause of death was determined for each deceased patient. Multiple parameters were evaluated for impact on outcome.  Results:   For the entire cohort, metastases-free survival (MFS) and CSS at 12 years were 98.1% and 98.2%, respectively. When rates were stratified by low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, the 12-year MFS was 99.8%, 98.1%, and 93.8% (p < 0.001), respectively. CSS rates were 99.8%, 98.0%, and 95.3% (p < 0.001) for low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively. Biochemical progression-free survival was 98.7%, 95.9% and 90.4% for low, intermediate, and high-risk patients, respectively (p < 0.001). In multivariate Cox-regression analysis, MFS was mostly closely related to Gleason score and year of treatment, whereas CSS was most closely associated with Gleason score.  Conclusions:   Excellent CSS and MFS rates are achievable with high-quality brachytherapy for low, intermediate, and high-risk patients. These results compare favorably to alternative treatment modalities. In particular, our MFS and CSS rates for high-risk patients appear superior to those of published radical prostatectomy series.""","""['Al V Taira', 'Gregory S Merrick', 'Robert W Galbreath', 'Wayne M Butler', 'Jonathan Lief', 'Edward Adamovich', 'Kent E Wallner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Impact of supplemental external beam radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy on biochemical outcome after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'High-risk prostate cancer with Gleason score 8-10 and PSA level ≤15 ng/mL treated with permanent interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Primary causes of death after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Ten-year disease free survival after transperineal sonography-guided iodine-125 brachytherapy with or without 45-gray external beam irradiation in the treatment of patients with clinically localized, low to high Gleason grade prostate carcinoma.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Patient age as a predictive factor in biochemical recurrence following brachytherapy: Oncological outcomes at a single center.', 'Long-term results of a study using individualized planning target volumes for hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost for prostate cancer.', 'Predictors of distant metastasis after combined HDR brachytherapy and external beam radiation for prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Toxicity data of 512 patients (conformally treated to 68 Gy [n = 284] and 78 Gy [n = 228]) with complete follow-up at 3 years after radiotherapy were studied. Scored end points were rectal bleeding, high stool frequency, and fecal incontinence. Two traditional dose-based models (Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) and Relative Seriality (RS) and a logistic model were fitted using a maximum likelihood approach. Furthermore, these model fits were improved by including the most significant clinical factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare the discriminating ability of all fits.  Results:   Including clinical factors significantly increased the predictive power of the models for all end points. In the optimal LKB, RS, and logistic models for rectal bleeding and fecal incontinence, the first significant (p = 0.011-0.013) clinical factor was ""previous abdominal surgery."" As second significant (p = 0.012-0.016) factor, ""cardiac history"" was included in all three rectal bleeding fits, whereas including ""diabetes"" was significant (p = 0.039-0.048) in fecal incontinence modeling but only in the LKB and logistic models. High stool frequency fits only benefitted significantly (p = 0.003-0.006) from the inclusion of the baseline toxicity score. For all models rectal bleeding fits had the highest AUC (0.77) where it was 0.63 and 0.68 for high stool frequency and fecal incontinence, respectively. LKB and logistic model fits resulted in similar values for the volume parameter. The steepness parameter was somewhat higher in the logistic model, also resulting in a slightly lower D(50). Anal wall DVHs were used for fecal incontinence, whereas anorectal wall dose best described the other two endpoints.

Objective:   To assess mortality in different prognostic categories among men with locally advanced PCa managed with noncurative intent.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a register-based nationwide cohort study within the Prostate Cancer DataBase Sweden. The entire cohort of locally advanced PCa included 14 908 men. After the exclusion of 2724 (18%) men treated with curative intent, 12 184 men with locally advanced PCa either with local clinical stage T3 or T4 or with T2 with serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) between 50 and 99 ng/ml and without signs of metastases remained for analysis.  Measurements:   We followed up the patient cohort in the Cause of Death Register for ≤ 11 yr and assessed cumulative incidence of PCa -specific death stratified by age and clinical characteristics.  Results and limitations:   The PCa -specific mortality at 8 yr of follow-up was 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25-32%) for Gleason score (GS) 2-6, 41% (95% CI, 38-44%) for GS 7, 52% (95% CI, 47-57%) for GS 8, and 64% (95% CI, 59-69%) for GS 9-10. Even for men aged >85 yr at diagnosis with GS 8-10, PCa was a major cause of death: 42% (95% CI, 37-47%). Men with locally advanced disease and a PSA<4 ng/ml at diagnosis were at particularly increased risk of dying from PCa. One important limitation is the lack of bone scans in 42% of the patient cohort, but results remained after exclusion of patients with unknown metastasis status.  Conclusions:   The PCa-specific mortality within 8 yr of diagnosis is high in locally advanced PCa, suggesting undertreatment, particularly among men in older age groups.

The aim of our study is to verify that the tendency occurs as well in north-african population, as well as to establish a possible correlation between PSA level, bone scan result, and Gleason score.  Material and methods:   Records of 348 patients diagnosed to have prostatic adenocarcinoma were reviewed retrospectively for bone scan results, PSA levels, and Gleason score. Statistical analyses were performed using the Fisher exact test, by a statistical software (statistical package for the social sciences ""SPSS"", version 11.5.1, Chicago, IL) with differences at P<0,05 considered significant.

The primary aim of this study (ENGAGE) is to determine the efficacy of a referral and physical activity program among survivors of prostate cancer, in terms of increasing participation in physical activity. Secondary aims are to determine the effects of the physical activity program on psychological well-being, quality of life and objective physical functioning. The influence of individual and environmental mediators on participation in physical activity will also be determined.  Methods/design:   This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Clinicians of prostate cancer survivors will be randomised into either the intervention or control condition. Clinicians in the intervention condition will refer eligible patients (n=110) to participate in an exercise program, comprising 12 weeks of supervised exercise sessions and unsupervised physical activity. Clinicians allocated to the control condition will provide usual care to eligible patients (n=110), which does not involve the recommendation of the physical activity program. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months on physical activity, quality of life, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goals, and socio-structural factors.  Discussion:   The findings of this study have implications for clinicians and patients with different cancer types or other chronic health conditions.

Over the past several years, our group has been studying how mycoplasmas could possibly initiate and propagate cancers of the prostate. Specifically, Mycoplasma hyorhinis encoded protein p37 was found to promote invasion of prostate cancer cells and cause changes in growth, morphology and gene expression of these cells to a more aggressive phenotype. Moreover, we found that chronic exposure of benign human prostate cells to M. hyorhinis resulted in significant phenotypic and karyotypic changes that ultimately resulted in the malignant transformation of the benign cells. In this study, we set out to investigate another potential link between mycoplasma and human prostate cancer.  Methods:   We report the incidence of men with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) being seropositive for M. hyorhinis. Antibodies to M. hyorhinis were surveyed by a novel indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum samples collected from men presenting to an outpatient Urology clinic for BPH (N = 105) or prostate cancer (N = 114) from 2006-2009.  Results:   A seropositive rate of 36% in men with BPH and 52% in men with prostate cancer was reported, thus leading us to speculate a possible connection between M. hyorhinis exposure with prostate cancer.

The association between nutritional factors and risk of prostate cancer, the finding of increased expression of OC in prostate cancer cells, and the association between GPRC6A and risk of prostate cancer in Japanese men implicates a role of GPRC6A in prostate cancer.  Methods:   We examined if GPRC6A is expressed in human prostate cancer cell lines and used siRNA-mediated knockdown GPRC6A expression in prostate cancer cells to explore the function of GPRC6A in vitro. To assess the role of GPRC6A in prostate cancer progression in vivo, we intercrossed Gprc6a(-/-) mice onto the TRAMP mouse prostate cancer model.  Results:   GPRC6A transcripts were markedly increased in prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1, PC-3, and LNCaP, compared to the normal prostate RWPE-1 cell line. In addition, a panel of GPRC6A ligands, including calcium, OC, and arginine, exhibited in prostate cancer cell lines a dose-dependent stimulation of ERK activity, cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and prostate specific antigen and Runx2 gene expression. These responses were inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GPRC6A. Finally, transfer of Gprc6a deficiency onto a TRAMP mouse model of prostate cancer significantly retarded prostate cancer progression and improved survival of compound Gprc6a(-/-) /TRAMP mice.

However, CaP eventually progresses to grow in a castration-resistant state. The mechanisms involved in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remain unknown. We have previously generated LNCaP-IL6+ cells by treating LNCaP cells chronically with interleukin-6 (IL-6), which have acquired the ability to grow in androgen-deprived conditions.  Methods:   We compared the protein expression profile of LNCaP and LNCaP-IL6+ cells using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The gels were then silver stained in order to visualize proteins and the differentially expressed spots were identified and characterized by micro sequencing using MALDI-PMF mass spectrometry.  Results:   In this study, we have identified RhoGDIα (GDIα) as a suppressor of CaP growth. Expression of GDIα was reduced in LNCaP-IL6+ cells and was down-regulated in more aggressive CaP cells compared to LNCaP cells. Over expression of GDIα inhibited the growth of CaP cells and caused LNCaP-IL6+ cells reversal to androgen-sensitive state, while down-regulation of GDIα enhanced growth of androgen-sensitive LNCaP CaP cells in androgen-deprived conditions.

Results:   In a proteomic profiling of bone marrow aspirates from men with prostate cancer, we found that katanin p60 was one of the proteins differentially expressed in bone metastasis samples. Immunohistochemical staining showed that katanin p60 was expressed in the basal cells in normal human prostate glands. In prostatic adenocarcinomas, in which the basal cells were absent, katanin p60 was expressed in the prostate cancer cells. In the specimens from bone metastasis, katanin p60 was detectable in the metastatic cancer cells. Strikingly, some of the metastatic cancer cells also co-expressed basal cell biomarkers including the tumor suppressor p53-homologous protein p63 and the high molecular weight cytokeratins, suggesting that the metastatic prostate cancer cells may have a basal cell-like phenotype. Moreover, overexpression of katanin p60 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation but enhanced cell migration activity.  Conclusions:   Katanin p60 was aberrantly expressed during prostate cancer progression. Its expression in the metastatic cells in bone was associated with the re-emergence of a basal cell-like phenotype.

This association was validated in different Asian populations, and, very recently, a study has been published in Caucasians. In this study, we analyzed the association between PSCA variation and GC risk in Caucasians from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Six tagSNPs covering the PSCA gene region were genotyped in 411 incident gastric adenocarcinoma cases and 1530 matched controls from a nested case-control study in the EPIC cohort. Associations were analyzed by unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and country. The T allele of rs2294008 in PSCA was found to be a highly significant risk factor for GC (per allele OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.23-1.66, p-value = 6.5 × 10(-6) ), particularly of the noncardia-type (per allele OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.19-1.81, p-value = 3 × 10(-4) ).

To address this problem, pJAK-1(Tyr1022/1023) and pSTAT-3(Tyr705) were evaluated by immunostaining in needle biopsies of the prostate from 202 PCa patients treated by definitive therapy (105 cases) or hormonal therapy (97 cases). The correlation of two protein expression with the clinicopathologic features and the prognosis of PCa were subsequently assessed. The expression levels of pJAK-1(Tyr1022/1023) and pSTAT-3(Tyr705) were both positively correlated with Gleason score and clinical stage of patients with PCa. Their expression was also significantly higher in patients with biochemical (prostate-specific antigen, PSA) failure than that in those with no PSA failure (both P < 0.001). In all patients, the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were significantly higher in those with low pJAK-1(Tyr1022/1023) and pSTAT-3(Tyr705) expression than that in those with high expression (both P < 0.001).

We investigated employment outcomes among survivors in Ireland where sick leave and sick pay are at the employers' discretion and the law affords no protection against dismissal following extended absence.  Methods:   A questionnaire was mailed to 1,373 survivors, identified from the National Cancer Registry, 6-24 months post-diagnosis. The analysis included breast and prostate cancer respondents who were working at diagnosis. Factors associated with work continuation post-diagnosis and work resumption after cancer-related absence were identified using logistic regression.  Results:   The response rate was 54%. Three hundred forty-six respondents were working at diagnosis (breast cancer = 246; prostate cancer = 100). Sixty-two (18%) continued working post-diagnosis. Factors significantly associated with work continuation were: self-employment, prostate cancer, lower pre-diagnosis household income, and not having surgery. Two hundred eighty-four took time off work post-diagnosis; of these, 51 (18%) had left the workforce, 187 (66%) had resumed working, and 46 (16%) planned to resume working. Factors significantly associated with work resumption were: tertiary education, not having chemotherapy, receiving sick pay, and not having a medical card (which provides free access to public health services). Among those who resumed working, the median absence was 30.1 weeks (inter-quartile range = 12.9-51.6). The length of absence varied significantly by socio-demographic, financial, medical, and job- and social welfare-related factors. Median working hours pre- and post-diagnosis differed significantly (pre-diagnosis = 38/week; post-diagnosis = 30/week; p<0.001).  Conclusions:   The high level of workforce departure and associations between self-employment, sick pay and medical cards, and employment outcomes suggest that social welfare and legal provisions are important determinants of the survivors' workforce participation.

To understand the underlying mechanisms and facilitate the development of novel treatments for androgen-independent prostate cancer, we have investigated plasma membrane-associated sialidase (NEU3), the key enzyme for ganglioside hydrolysis participating in transmembrane signaling. We have discovered NEU3 to be upregulated in human prostate cancer compared with non-cancerous tissue, correlating with the Gleason score. NEU3 silencing with siRNA in prostate cancer PC-3 and LNCaP cells resulted in increased expression of differentiation markers and in cell apoptosis, but decrease in Bcl-2 as well as a progression-related transcription factor, early growth response gene (EGR-1). In androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells, forced overexpression of NEU3 significantly induced expression of EGR-1, androgen receptor (AR) and PSA both with and without androgen, the cells becoming sensitive to androgen. The NEU3-mediated induction was abrogated by inhibitors for PI-3 kinase and MAP kinase and more specifically by their silencing in the absence of androgen, being confirmed by increased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in NEU3 overexpressing cells. NEU3 siRNA introduction caused reduction of cell growth of an androgen-independent PC-3 cells in culture and of transplanted tumors in nude mice.

Moreover, studies have shown that more than 50% of human prostate cancers overexpress ERG (v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene related gene) due to AR-regulated TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene. However, the reported roles of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in cancer progression are not clear. In this study, we investigated the signal transduction in the AR/TMPRSS2-ERG/Wnt signaling network for studying the aggressive behavior of prostate cancer cells and further assessed the effects of BR-DIM and CDF [natural agents-derived synthetic formulation and analogue of 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) and curcumin, respectively, with improved bioavailability] on the regulation of AR/TMPRSS2-ERG/Wnt signaling. We found that activation of AR resulted in the induction of ERG expression through TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. Moreover, we found that ERG overexpression and nuclear translocation activated the activity of Wnt signaling. Furthermore, forced overexpression of ERG promoted invasive capacity of prostate cancer cells. More important, we found that BR-DIM and CDF inhibited the signal transduction in the AR/TMPRSS2-ERG/Wnt signaling network, leading to the inactivation of Wnt signaling consistent with inhibition of prostate cancer cell invasion. In addition, BR-DIM and CDF inhibited proliferation of prostate cancer cells and induced apoptotic cell death. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that because BR-DIM and CDF downregulate multiple signaling pathways including AR/TMPRSS2-ERG/Wnt signaling, these agents could be useful for designing novel strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Yiwei Li', 'Dejuan Kong', 'Zhiwei Wang', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Bin Bao', 'Subhash Padhye', 'Fazlul H Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""[""Editor's Note: Inactivation of AR/TMPRSS2-ERG/Wnt Signaling Networks Attenuates the Aggressive Behavior of Prostate Cancer Cells."", 'Micro-RNA-204 Participates in TMPRSS2/ERG Regulation and Androgen Receptor Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG fusions confer efficacy of enzalutamide in an in vivo bone tumor growth model.', 'ERG is a critical regulator of Wnt/LEF1 signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Emerging biological observations in prostate cancer.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Potential role of PIM1 inhibition in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'Anticancer Activity of Novel Difluorinated Curcumin Analog and Its Inclusion Complex with 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin against Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'In Vitro characterization of the endocrine disrupting effects of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) on the human androgen receptor.', 'Crosstalk Between AR and Wnt Signaling Promotes Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Growth.']"""

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane protein expressed in normal human prostate epithelium and is upregulated in prostate cancer. (S)-2-(3-((S)-1-carboxy-5-((4-(123)I-iodobenzyl)amino)pentyl)ureido)pentanedioic acid, (123)I-MIP-1072, targets PSMA and was evaluated for monitoring the growth of PSMA-positive LNCaP cells in vitro and as xenografts after paclitaxel therapy.  Methods:   LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells were treated with paclitaxel (0-100 nM) for 48 h, after which binding of (123)I-MIP-1072 was examined. Cell number was determined by MTS assay, and PSMA expression was analyzed by Western blotting. LNCaP xenograft-bearing mice were treated with paclitaxel (6.25 mg/kg) for 3.5 cycles of 5 d on and 2 d off. Tissue distribution of (123)I-MIP-1072 was determined on days 2 and 23 from the start of paclitaxel treatment.  Results:   Paclitaxel (10-100 nM) inhibited LNCaP and 22Rv1 cell growth after 48 h, and binding of (123)I-MIP-1072 was proportional to cell number. Western blot analysis verified there was no paclitaxel-dependent change in PSMA expression. Treatment of LNCaP xenografts with paclitaxel resulted in a decrease in tumor volume (-21%), compared with an increase in the untreated xenografts (+205%) by day 23. Tumor uptake of (123)I-MIP-1072 was proportional to changes in tumor mass: decreased by paclitaxel treatment and increased in untreated mice.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed the records of 8,418 patients who underwent robotic assisted radical prostatectomy at 7 institutions. Of the patients 323 had missing data on margin status. Positive surgical margins were categorized into 4 groups, including apex, bladder neck, posterolateral and multifocal. The records of 6,169 patients were available for multivariate analysis. The variables entered into the logistic regression models were age, body mass index, preoperative prostate specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score, prostate weight and pathological stage. A second model was built to identify predictive factors for positive surgical margins in the subset of patients with organ confined disease (pT2).  Results:   The overall positive surgical margin rate was 15.7% (1,272 of 8,095 patients). The positive surgical margin rate for pT2 and pT3 disease was 9.45% and 37.2%, respectively.

For men with an undetectable prostate specific antigen at 10 years the actuarial probability of biochemical recurrence and metastasis at 20 years varied by stage and grade, with no metastases in patients with a prostatectomy Gleason score 6 or less. A single patient with an undetectable prostate specific antigen at 10 years died of prostate cancer within 20 years after radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Men with an undetectable prostate specific antigen for more than 10 years have a low risk of subsequent biochemical recurrence, with correspondingly lower rates of metastasis and death. These patients should be counseled that their risk of subsequent cancer related morbidity and mortality is low. Furthermore, these results suggest that annual prostate specific antigen testing may be safely discontinued after 10 years for men with a prostatectomy Gleason score 6 or less and/or limited life expectancy.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Zhaoyong Feng', 'Ashley Ross', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Elizabeth B Humphreys', 'Patrick C Walsh']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Prostate Specific Antigen Testing after Radical Prostatectomy-Can We Stop at 20 Years?', 'Do Ultrasensitive Prostate Specific Antigen Measurements Have a Role in Predicting Long-Term Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Men after Radical Prostatectomy?', 'Low detectable prostate specific antigen after radical prostatectomy--treat or watch?', 'Long-term biochemical disease-free and cancer-specific survival following anatomic radical retropubic prostatectomy.

To our knowledge the significance of perineural invasion on biopsy in patients who otherwise meet the criteria for active surveillance has not been studied.  Materials and methods:   The biopsy criteria for active surveillance were Gleason score 6 or less, 2 or fewer positive cores and 50% or less involvement any positive core. All cases had at least 12 biopsy cores. A total of 313 cases met the biopsy criteria for active surveillance, and elected to undergo immediate radical prostatectomy at our institution between 1992 and 2008. These cases included 51 with perineural invasion and 262 without perineural invasion.  Results:   There was no significant difference in patient age and mean serum prostate specific antigen at diagnosis in cases with and those without perineural invasion. Cases with perineural invasion on biopsy had a higher maximum percentage of cancer on biopsy (18.6%) vs those without perineural invasion (15.0%, p=0.02). Cases with perineural invasion also had slightly more with 2 positive cores compared to cases without perineural invasion (56.9% and 39.7%, respectively, p=0.02).

Unifocal disease was defined as the identification of a solitary cancer focus in the prostate without additional tumor foci or satellite lesions, ie multifocal disease, on histopathological evaluation. Cox regression modeling was used to identify predictors of biochemical progression among groups.  Results:   A total of 184 patients (13%) fulfilled our unifocal tumor criteria. Unifocal tumors tended to be smaller in volume and in greatest diameter than multifocal tumors (p<0.0001 and <0.005, respectively). Of patients with pathologically insignificant disease the relative proportion with unifocal tumors increased to 28% from 13% in the overall cohort (p<0.0005). Also, tumor focality failed to predict biochemical recurrence in univariate and multivariate models.

Increasing patient involvement may allow a more personalized experience and may improve satisfaction. We assessed a strategy of surgeon deference to patient choice in regard to nerve sparing to determine to what degree patients are rational actors and capable of active decision making.  Materials and methods:   A total of 150 patients treated with prostatectomy participated in a standardized preoperative discussion regarding the concept of nerve sparing, extracapsular extension and the potential need for adjuvant radiation in the event of local recurrence. Each patient was given his nomogram predicted risk of extracapsular extension and then elected nerve sparing or nonnerve sparing. The corresponding procedure was performed unless grossly invasive disease was encountered.  Results:   Of the 150 patients 109 chose nerve sparing (73%) and 41 chose nonnerve sparing (27%). In patients with a nomogram predicted risk of extracapsular extension less than 20%, 20% to 50% and greater than 50%, nerve sparing was elected by 88%, 41% and 25%, respectively. Patients with lower risks of extracapsular extension electing nonnerve sparing were older and had higher rates of erectile dysfunction.  Conclusions:   Empowering patients to decide on their nerve sparing status is a reasonable strategy that did not lead to a high rate of patients with a high risk of extracapsular extension electing nerve sparing. With proper counseling informed patients made reasonable decisions, and appeared to be conservative, prioritizing cancer control in the majority of instances where extracapsular extension risk was high.

Materials and methods:   A 3-dimensional model of each gland and individual cancer was reconstructed using 107 radical whole mount specimens. We performed 500 transperineal prostate mapping simulations per case by varying needle targeting errors to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive value to detect lesions 0.2 ml or greater, or 0.5 ml or greater. Definitions of clinically significant cancer based on a combination of Gleason grade and cancer burden (cancer core length) were derived.  Results:   Mean±SD patient age was 61±6.4 years (range 44 to 74) and mean prostate specific antigen was 9.7±5.9 ng/ml (range 0.8 to 36.2). We reconstructed 665 foci. The total cancer core length from all positive biopsies for a particular lesion that detected more than 95% of lesions 0.5 ml or greater and 0.2 ml or greater was 10 mm or greater and 6 mm or greater, respectively. The maximum cancer core length that detected more than 95% of lesions 0.5 ml or greater and 0.2 ml or greater was 6 mm or greater and 4 mm or greater, respectively. We combined these cancer burden thresholds with dominant and nondominant Gleason pattern 4 to derive 2 definitions of clinically significant disease.

Materials and methods:   Analysis included men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer and enrolled in a phase III fracture prevention trial. All men were 70 years old or older or had a low bone mineral density (T-score less than -1.5 for the lumbar spine or total hip). We analyzed demographic and laboratory characteristics of men with and those without vertebral fractures at study entry.  Results:   Of the 1,244 subjects 162 (13.0%) had a vertebral fracture at baseline.

Lower bone mineral density was also significantly associated with vertebral fractures when analyzed as a continuous variable. Factors not associated with vertebral fractures included age, country of residence, androgen deprivation therapy duration at baseline, androgen deprivation therapy mode, body mass index, testosterone, estradiol, C-telopeptide, bone specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. Results were similar in analyses limited to men 70 years old or older.

Image registration is a necessary step in many applications, e.g. in patient positioning and therapy response assessment with repeated imaging. In this study, we investigate the dependence between the registration accuracy and the size of the registration volume for a subvolume based rigid registration protocol for MR images of the prostate.  Methods:   Ten patients were imaged four times each over the course of radiotherapy treatment using a T2 weighted sequence. The images were registered to each other using a mean square distance metric and a step gradient optimizer for registration volumes of different sizes. The precision of the registrations was evaluated using the center of mass distance between the manually defined prostates in the registered images. The optimal size of the registration volume was determined by minimizing the standard deviation of these distances.  Results:   We found that prostate position was most uncertain in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction using traditional full volume registration. The improvement in standard deviation of the mean center of mass distance between the prostate volumes using a registration volume optimized to the prostate was 3.9 mm (p < 0.001) in the AP direction. The optimum registration volume size was 0 mm margin added to the prostate gland as outlined in the first image series.  Conclusions:   Repeated MR imaging of the prostate for therapy set-up or therapy assessment will both require high precision tissue registration. With a subvolume based registration the prostate registration uncertainty can be reduced down to the order of 1 mm (1 SD) compared to several millimeters for registration based on the whole pelvis.""","""['Joakim H Jonsson', 'Patrik Brynolfsson', 'Anders Garpebring', 'Mikael Karlsson', 'Karin Söderström', 'Tufve Nyholm']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['A Bayesian nonrigid registration method to enhance intraoperative target definition in image-guided prostate procedures through uncertainty characterization.', 'Investigation of the clinical inter-observer bias in prostate fiducial marker image registration between CT and MR images.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Functional MRI for radiotherapy dose painting.', 'Imaging prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of gold fiducial marker manual localisation for magnetic resonance-only prostate radiotherapy.', 'The distance discordance metric-a novel approach to quantifying spatial uncertainties in intra- and inter-patient deformable image registration.', 'Image-guided radiation therapy.']"""

In the present work, the metabolic fate of phenstatin in rat and human microsomal preparations was studied to investigate the stability of this tubulin polymerization inhibitor and any effects of the metabolites on polymerization and on PC3 cancer cell proliferation. The metabolites were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and, after their synthesis, characterized by simultaneous LC-DAD-UV and LC-ESI-MS analyses.

The major biotransformation pathways are carbonyl reduction, O-methylation at C-3', O-methylation after aromatic hydroxylation at the position C-2' on phenyl B ring and O-demethylation on A ring. Four of the identified metabolites were as active or more active, than phenstatin in vitro.

There are no drugs with demonstrated efficacy on the risk of fracture in castrated men with prostate cancer. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits a cytokine acting mainly on bone cells and lymphocytes, has been authorised in the European Union for use in both these settings. There are no trials comparing denosumab versus alendronic acid for symptomatic fracture prevention. In two trials involving 1189 and 504 women, the incidence of clinical fractures, recorded as simple adverse effects, did not differ significantly between the groups. In a placebo-controlled trial in about 7900 elderly osteoporotic women, denosumab significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic vertebral fractures (0.8% versus 2.6% after 3 years) and hip fractures (0.7% versus 1.2%). An indirect comparison, providing weak evidence, suggests that denosumab is less effective than alendronic acid. In a placebo-controlled trial in 1468 castrated men with prostate cancer, denosumab did not reduce the incidence of symptomatic fractures after 3 years. Only the incidence of vertebral fractures, detected on routine radiographs, showed a statistically significant decline (1.5% versus 3.5%). Denosumab has numerous adverse effects.

PTOV1 is highly expressed in prostate cancers and considered as a potential marker for carcinogenesis and the progress of prostate cancer. It was reported that PTOV1 plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, but its role in mammalian oocyte development and meiosis is still unclear. In this paper, it was found that the expression levels of PTOV1 in mouse ovaries progressively increased from prepubescence to adulthood. And we found by immunohistochemistry that PTOV1 spreaded in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of oocytes during prepuberty, but in normal adult mouse oocytes, it concentrated not only in nuclei but also on the plasma membrane, though in some oocytes with abnormal shapes, PTOV1 did not display the typical distribution patterns. In granulosa cells, however, it was found to locate in the cytoplasm at all the selected ages. In postnatal mouse ovaries (28 days), estradiol treatment induced the adult-specific distribution pattern of PTOV1 in oocytes. In addition, UCH-L1 was shown to be associated with CDK1, which participated in the regulation of cell cycle and oocyte maturation. Therefore, we propose that the distribution changes of PTOV1 are age-dependent, and significant for mouse oocyte development and maturation. Moreover, the discovery that PTOV1 is associated with UCH-L1 in mouse oocytes supports the explanations for that UCH-L1 is involved in oocyte development and maturation, especially under the regulation of estrogen.""","""['Yu-Wei Yao', 'Yan Shi', 'Zhe-Fu Jia', 'Ya-Hong Jiang', 'Zheng Gu', 'Jian Wang', 'Mohamad Aljofan', 'Zhao-Gui Sun']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Histochem Cell Biol""","""['Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), a double-edged sword in mammalian oocyte maturation and spermatogenesis.', 'Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 contributes to the oocyte selective elimination in prepubertal mouse ovaries.', 'UCH-L1 inhibitor LDN-57444 hampers mouse oocyte maturation by regulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial function and reducing ERK1/2 expression.', 'Localization of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 in mouse ova and its function in the plasma membrane to block polyspermy.', 'Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1): structure, distribution and roles in brain function and dysfunction.', 'Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), a double-edged sword in mammalian oocyte maturation and spermatogenesis.', 'Ovarian Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Differential Expression Genes Associated with Cell Death Process after Selection for Ovulation Rate in Rabbits.', 'The role of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 in cancer progression.', 'Evaluation of follicular synchronization caused by estrogen administration and its reproductive outcome.', 'Winter hibernation and UCHL1-p34cdc2 association in toad oocyte maturation competence.']"""

Methods:   Between April 2000 and May 2010, 609 patients with prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy at Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine.

Interestingly, ADT also induced high levels of vimentin expression in prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and in human prostate tumors in vivo. The induction of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype by androgen depletion was mediated, at least in part, by down-regulation of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, whereas the neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells was under separate control. These data demonstrate a previously unrecognized link between inhibition of androgen receptor signaling, down-regulation of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, and the appearance of secretory, tumor-promoting senescent cells in prostate tumors.

Transformed epithelial cells can switch to a motile, mesenchymal phenotype by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Recently, it has been shown that EMT is functionally linked to prostate cancer stem cells, which are not only critically involved in prostate cancer maintenance but also in bone metastasis. We showed that treatment with the non-peptide α(v)-integrin antagonist GLPG0187 dose-dependently increased the E-cadherin/vimentin ratio, rendering the cells a more epithelial, sessile phenotype. In addition, GLPG0187 dose-dependently diminished the size of the aldehyde dehydrogenase high subpopulation of prostate cancer cells, suggesting that α(v)-integrin plays an important role in maintaining the prostate cancer stem/progenitor pool. Our data show that GLPG0187 is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Real-time bioluminescent imaging in preclinical models of prostate cancer demonstrated that blocking α(v)-integrins by GLPG0187 markedly reduced their metastatic tumor growth according to preventive and curative protocols. Bone tumor burden was significantly lower in the preventive protocol. In addition, the number of bone metastases/mouse was significantly inhibited. In the curative protocol, the progression of bone metastases and the formation of new bone metastases during the treatment period was significantly inhibited.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction have been the most commonly used techniques in this setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of ERG immunoexpression as a surrogate for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in a large series of PCa cases.  Materials and methods:   Four hundred twenty-seven radical retropubic prostatectomy tissue samples were used to construct 10 tissue microarrays (TMAs). FISH analysis was previously conducted using dual-color interphase break-apart probes for the 5' and 3' regions of the ERG gene. ERG expression was evaluated using a commercial rabbit anti-ERG monoclonal antibody (clone EPR3864; Epitomics, Burlingame, CA). Each TMA spot was independently assessed, and any nuclear staining positivity was considered as indicative of ERG expression.  Results:   TMPRSS2-ERG fusions were detected by FISH in 195 (45.7%) of the PCa cases. ERG immunoexpression was found in 192 (45.0%) of the PCa cases and in none of the nontumoral tissue samples. Mean ERG H-scores were significantly higher in tumors harboring FISH-detected TMPRSS2-ERG fusions (P<0.00001), and there was a strong association between ERG immunohistochemical expression and the TMPRSS2-ERG status defined by FISH (P<0.00001), with a sensitivity of 86% (95% CI, 80%-90%) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI, 84%-93%). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that ERG immunoexpression had a high accuracy for identifying TMPRSS2-ERG fusions detected by FISH, with an area under the curve of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84%-0.91; P<0.00001).

It has been appreciated that tumor cells metastasize to bone using mechanisms similar to those of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) homing to bone marrow (e.g., CXCL12/CXCR4). It was recently found that prostate cancer cells target the bone marrow microenvironment for HSCs, or the HSC niche, during metastasis. Of importance, these disseminated prostate cancer cells can be mobilized out of the niche with the use of HSC mobilizing agents. These findings suggest that the bone marrow HSC niche is a potential therapeutic target for metastatic disease. Therefore, a hypothesis worth considering is that agents that can disrupt the interactions between tumor cells and the HSC niche may be efficacious when used in conjunction with standard chemotherapeutic agents.

By employing an integrative approach, we show that the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion product binds to the ERG locus and drives the overexpression of wild-type ERG in prostate cancers. Knockdown of TMPRSS2-ERG in VCaP cells resulted in the downregulation of wild-type ERG transcription, whereas stable overexpression of TMPRSS2-ERG in the gene fusion-negative PC3 cells was associated with the upregulation of wild-type ERG transcript. Further, androgen signaling-mediated upregulation of TMPRSS2-ERG resulted in the concomitant upregulation of wild-type ERG transcription in VCaP cells. The loss of wild-type ERG expression was associated with a decrease in the invasive potential of VCaP cells.

Despite numerous case series published so far studies with detailed investigations into risk factors, the precise localization of ONJ and impact of ONJ on the oncological treatment remain sparse.  Patients and methods:   This single-centre study collated medical records (2003-2009) of all patients that suffered from ONJ within the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germany. In total, 126 patients fulfilled the case criteria of ONJ and were examined clinically. The complete medical history including detailed questionnaires was collected of 66 patients, focussing in particular on the identification of underlying risk factors, clinical features, ONJ localization as well as the impact on the oncological treatment.  Results:   The majority of ONJ cases occurred in patients suffering from malignant diseases (n=117; 92.8%), in particular breast cancer (n=57; 45.2%), multiple myeloma (n=37; 29.4%) and prostate cancer (n=13; 10.3%), all received nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates intravenously. ONJ was also diagnosed in 9 patients (7.1%) suffering from osteoporosis or rheumatoid arthritis. The most prevalent clinical feature was exposed necrotic bone (93.9%) in the oral cavity which was accompanied in 78.8% of cases by pain. A predilection for the mandible and in particular for molar and premolar regions in both jaws was shown. Although no recommendation concerning the oncologic treatment was made, the manifestation of ONJ resulted (in a significant proportion of the patients) in a change of medication and schedule. The most frequent co-medications were steroids and anti-angiogenetic drugs, such as thalidomide.  Discussion:   The predilection for mandibular molar and premolar regions, and the infectious conditions that often precede the onset of ONJ support recent pathogenesis theories stating that local inflammation and associated pH-changes may trigger the release and activation of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates ultimately resulting in necrosis.  Conclusion:   The development of ONJ has a multi-factorial aetiology and the clinical presentation can vary markedly.

Radiotherapy is used to treat localized prostate cancer. Some people consume green tea (EGCG) as a chemopreventive agent against prostate cancer. Green tea can act as an antioxidant and induce superoxide dismutase enzymes, which could scavenge the free oxygen radicals generated by radiotherapy.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cell line DU145 cells were treated with EGCG or radiotherapy, or both. Cell death was assessed using trypan blue cell counting, and apoptosis was confirmed by assessing poly (adenosine phosphate ribose) polymerase cleavage. The antioxidant potential was assessed using Western immunoblotting for manganese superoxide dismutase and copper zinc superoxide dismutase enzymes. Radiotherapy was delivered using a linear accelerator. Cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry.  Results:   Radiotherapy at 3.5 Gy induced a 5.9-fold increase in apoptosis of DU145 cells. Subapoptotic doses of EGCG (1.5-7.5 μM) significantly reduced ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis (P < .001), with the inhibitory effect of EGCG on ionizing radiation being most effective when added 30 minutes before radiotherapy (P < .001). In addition, when radiotherapy and EGCG were used together, an approximate 1.5-fold increase in manganese superoxide dismutase levels was seen compared with the control and a 2-fold increase compared with radiotherapy alone.  Conclusions:   Radiotherapy is effective in inducing apoptosis in DU145 cells, but its effect was significantly reduced in the presence of EGCG, and this was associated with an increase in the induction of manganese superoxide dismutase.""","""['Francis Thomas', 'Jeff M P Holly', 'Rajendra Persad', 'Amit Bahl', 'Claire M Perks']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Effect of a prodrug of the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate on the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer in vivo.', 'Growth inhibition, cell-cycle dysregulation, and induction of apoptosis by green tea constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate in androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Epigallocatechin-3-gallate and bicalutamide cause growth arrest and apoptosis in NRP-152 and NRP-154 prostate epithelial cells.', 'Role of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer.', 'Green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as adjuvant in cancer therapy.', 'Natural Compounds as Promising Adjuvant Agents in The Treatment of Gliomas.', 'Molecular Mechanisms and Bioavailability of Polyphenols in Prostate Cancer.', 'Green Tea Catechins for Prostate Cancer Prevention: Present Achievements and Future Challenges.', 'Homeostatic imbalance and colon cancer: the dynamic epigenetic interplay of inflammation, environmental toxins, and chemopreventive plant compounds.']"""

It has been suggested that overexpression of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 can contribute to the proliferative status of prostate tumor cells and, thus, to their biologic behavior. Prostate tumor overexpressed 1 and Ki-67 were immunohistochemically evaluated in prostate cancer, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and normal-looking epithelium in 20 cystoprostatectomies and 20 radical prostatectomies with pT2a Gleason score 6 prostate cancer. The aim was to see whether there were differences in marker expression between cystoprostatectomies and radical prostatectomies. The proportions of prostate tumor overexpressed 1- and Ki-67-positive cells in the cystoprostatectomies and radical prostatectomies increased from normal-looking epithelium through high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, away from and adjacent to prostate cancer, to prostate cancer. Prostate tumor overexpressed 1 expression in prostate cancer in cystoprostatectomies was lower than in radical prostatectomies, the differences being significant; there were significant differences in Ki-67 indices. In conclusion, our findings related to prostate tumor overexpressed 1 expression in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, evaluated adjacent and away from prostate cancer, and in incidental and clinical cancers give further support to the concept of field effect in prostatic carcinogenesis as well as to differences in the process of prostatic carcinogenesis between cystoprostatectomies and radical prostatectomies.""","""['Roberta Mazzucchelli', 'Francesca Barbisan', 'Alfredo Santinelli', 'Antonio Lopez-Beltran', 'Liang Cheng', 'Marina Scarpelli', 'Rodolfo Montironi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['HER2 expression and gene amplification in pT2a Gleason score 6 prostate cancer incidentally detected in cystoprostatectomies: comparison with clinically detected androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cancer.', 'alpha-Methylacyl coenzyme A racemase, Ki-67, and topoisomerase IIalpha in cystoprostatectomies with incidental prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of ELAV-like protein HuR is associated with increased COX-2 expression in atrophy, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and incidental prostate cancer in cystoprostatectomies.', 'Contemporary pathology of prostate cancer.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: state-of-the-art.', 'The role of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 in cancer progression.', 'Prostate tumor overexpressed 1 expression in invasive urothelial carcinoma.', 'Prostate Tumor Overexpressed 1 (PTOV1) Is a Novel Prognostic Marker for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Progression and Poor Survival Outcomes.', 'Identification of FISH biomarkers to detect chromosome abnormalities associated with prostate adenocarcinoma in tumour and field effect environment.', 'Cancer-associated changes in the expression of TMPRSS2-ERG, PCA3, and SPINK1 in histologically benign tissue from cancerous vs noncancerous prostatectomy specimens.']"""

Methods:   The authors performed a retrospective cohort study of men in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare diagnosed with localized prostate cancer from 1995 to 2005 linked to hospital and census data. A total of 134,291 men were assigned to the hospital where they received care. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine whether hospital racial composition was associated with the receipt of definitive therapy and type of treatment.  Results:   Black men were less likely to receive radiation and/or prostatectomy compared with white men (55.5% vs 63.7%, P < .001) and, among those who received definitive therapy, were less likely to undergo prostatectomy (27.5% vs 31.9%, P < .001). The percentage of black men who received their care at hospitals with a high proportion of black patients was 48.0%, compared with only 5.2% of white patients who received care in this subset of hospitals.

Methods:   In total, 2301 men were identified who had a minimum follow-up of 24 months and had received low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer at the Mount Sinai Medical Center from June 1990 to October 2008. Patient factors, with specific emphasis on patient race, were analyzed with respect to freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF). Kaplan-Meier analyses, life-tables, and log-rank tests were used to identify variables that were predictive of 10-year FFbF.  Results:   In this series, a total of 2268 patients included 81% Caucasians, 12% African Americans, 6% Hispanics, and 1% Asians. The 10-year actuarial FFbF rate was 70% for AA men and 84% for all others (P = .002). Between Caucasian men and AA men, the 10-year FFbF rate was 83% versus 70%, respectively (P = .001).There was no significant difference in 10-year FFbF between Caucasian men and Hispanic men (83% vs 86%, respectively; P = .6). The 10-year FFbF rate for Hispanic men and AA men was 86% versus 70%, respectively (P = .062). A greater percentage of AA men presented with higher prostate-specific antigen levels (PSA) (>10 ng/mL; 44% vs 21%; P < .001) and, thus, with higher risk disease (24% vs 15%; P < .001) compared with Caucasian men. Among the men with low-risk disease, the 10-year FFbF rate was 90% for Caucasian men and 76% for AA men (P = .041). The 10-year BDFS rate for patients who received brachytherapy alone was 86% for Caucasian men and 61% for AA men (P = .001); however, this difference was not observed when brachytherapy was combined with androgen-deprivation therapy(ADT) with or without supplemental external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Multivariate analysis revealed that PSA (P = .024), Gleason score (P < .001), the biologic effective dose (P < .001), EBRT (P = .002), ADT (P = .03), and AA race (P = .037) were significant predictors of 10-year FFbF. No significant differences was observed in overall survival, cause-specific survival, or distant metastasis-free survival between racial groups.

Until recently, the C-TRUS existed only as a stand-alone device. Now, C-TRUS was developed into a network-compatible module (C-TRUS-MS). This new technology allows users to transmit C-TRUS images from any internet platform to C-TRUS-MS investigation. After analysis, the cancer-suspicious marked images are then retransmitted via internet. Targeted biopsies can then be taken at the urologists' office remotely.  Materials and methods:   This prospective study investigates whether the rates of prostate cancer detection with C-TRUS-MS ""multicenter online"" are comparable with those achieved by the stand-alone unit. In addition to patients with a history of multiple systematic random biopsies, a group of patients who had not undergone systematic random biopsies were analyzed.  Results:   A total of 1,545 digital images (2-23 per patient, median 6) from 57 urologists were transmitted to the analysis center. After analysis, the color-coded images were sent back electronically and utilized for a maximum of six targeted biopsies. C-TRUS-MS was able to detect prostate cancer in 91 patients. In addition, we evaluated 75 patients without any previous random biopsies. In this group, C-TRUS-MS was able to detect prostate cancer in 31 out of 75 patients (41%).  Conclusion:   The results indicate that C-TRUS-MS ""online"" achieves similar results as the stand-alone system, independent of the user even with little experience in the method. Furthermore, C-TRUS-MS for the first time is able to detect carcinomas in patients without prior biopsies in a high number by taking only six targeted biopsies.""","""['Bjoern Grabski', 'Leif Baeurle', 'Annemie Loch', 'Bjoern Wefer', 'Udo Paul', 'Tillmann Loch']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Computerized transrectal ultrasound (C-TRUS) of the prostate: detection of cancer in patients with multiple negative systematic random biopsies.', 'Computerized supported transrectal ultrasound (C-TRUS) in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Prostate biopsy techniques and indications: when, where, and how?', 'A prospective multi-center randomized comparative trial evaluating outcomes of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided 12-core systematic biopsy, mpMRI-targeted 12-core biopsy, and artificial intelligence ultrasound of prostate (AIUSP) 6-core targeted biopsy for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Application of Multiple Ultrasonic Techniques in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'External validation of the computerized analysis of TRUS of the prostate with the ANNA/C-TRUS system: a potential role of artificial intelligence for improving prostate cancer detection.', 'The Value of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography Combined with Real-Time Strain Elastography in the Early Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Internal Fusion: exact correlation of transrectal ultrasound images of the prostate by detailed landmarks over time for targeted biopsies or follow-up.']"""

We constructed a Markov model to simulate the randomized studies of observation versus ART, assuming 75% of observation patients would receive SRT at PSA recurrence. Transition probabilities and utility inputs were drawn from randomized trials of ART and cohort studies of SRT. We projected 10-year PSA recurrence-free survival, metastasis-free survival and overall survival. We found that observation with selective SRT yielded slightly worse outcomes than ART for post-RT PSA recurrence-free survival (47 and 52%), metastasis-free survival (69 and 70%) and overall survival (72 and 73%). Findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. After adjusting for the disutility of RT, observation plus SRT yielded better QALYs at 10 years than ART (6.80 and 6.13 QALYs).

In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of KAI1/CD82-mediated changes in cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix using human prostate cancer cells. We found that high KAI1/CD82 expression attenuated short-term cell adhesion to uncoated- or fibronectin-coated plates. Moreover, high KAI1/CD82 expression generated an extracellular environment unfavorable for cell adhesion as compared to low KAI1/CD82 expression, suggesting KAI1/CD82-dependent regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule(s) expression and/or secretion. Among ECM components examined, fibronectin exhibited decreased expression and secretion in high KAI1/CD82-expressing cells. Furthermore, high KAI1/CD82 expression interfered with the activation of β (1) integrin at the cell surface while total β (1) integrin levels remained unchanged, concomitant with reduced formation of focal adhesion complex and decreased bundling of actin filaments. Finally, high KAI1/CD82 expression significantly retarded cell motility in a scratch wound assay. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that KAI1/CD82 attenuates the activation of β (1) integrin, and thereby down-regulates outside-in signaling of β (1) integrin, leading to the reduction of focal adhesion formation and fibronectin expression/secretion, which subsequently interferes with cell adhesion properties and motility.""","""['Hyun-Ah Lee', 'Iha Park', 'Hee-Jung Byun', 'Dooil Jeoung', 'Young-Myeong Kim', 'Hansoo Lee']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['The metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1 inhibits fibronectin adhesion-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells by repressing the associated integrin signaling.', 'Requirement of the p130CAS-Crk coupling for metastasis suppressor KAI1/CD82-mediated inhibition of cell migration.', 'Effect of KAI1/CD82 on the beta1 integrin maturation in highly migratory carcinoma cells.', 'KAI1/CD82, a tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'KAI1/CD82, Metastasis Suppressor Gene as a Therapeutic Target for Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma.', 'Prostate cancer cell-platelet bidirectional signaling promotes calcium mobilization, invasion and apoptotic resistance via distinct receptor-ligand pairs.', 'Tspan9 Induces EMT and Promotes Osteosarcoma Metastasis via Activating FAK-Ras-ERK1/2 Pathway.', 'Targeting CD82/KAI1 for Precision Therapeutics in Surmounting Metastatic Potential in Breast Cancer.', 'Role of Metastasis Suppressor KAI1/CD82 in Different Cancers.', 'Role of a metastatic suppressor gene KAI1/CD82 in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer.']"""

We validated two common North American-based, prostate cancer risk calculators.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a prospective, multi-institutional study of 2,130 patients who underwent a prostate biopsy for prostate cancer detection from five centers. We evaluated the performance of the Sunnybrook nomogram-based prostate cancer risk calculator (SRC) and the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) -based risk calculator (PRC) to predict the presence of any cancer and high-grade cancer. We examined discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis techniques to evaluate the prediction models.  Results:   Of the 2,130 patients, 867 men (40.7%) were found to have cancer, and 1,263 (59.3%) did not have cancer. Of the patients with cancer, 403 (46.5%) had a Gleason score of 7 or more. The area under the [concentration-time] curve (AUC) for the SRC was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.69); the AUC for the PRC was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.64).

Decision curve analyses showed that the SRC performed better than the PRC for risk thresholds of more than 30% for any cancer and more than 15% for aggressive cancer.

Our aim was to determine risk factors and to develop possible prevention strategies for LC in a community-based study.  Methods:   Data from 1163 RP-patients from 67 clinics between January 2002 and December 2004 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients underwent pelvic imaging procedures/LC-management during 3 weeks of rehabilitation post-RP.  Results:   LC were identified in 304 patients (26%). Lymphadenectomy was carried out in 92% of patients (1001/1086 patients), from which 28% had LC (n = 277) versus 14% without lymphadenectomy (12/85, P = 0.007). Complications (lower limb edema, pain, thrombosis, infection and bladder compression) were observed in 9% of patients (28/304; 2.4% of total patients); necessitating therapy. LC therapy was carried out in 59 patients (5.9%) with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) and in no patients (0%) without PLND (P = 0.021). Risk factors included were patients' age, body mass index, prostate volume, TNM-classification, number of removed lymph nodes, previous surgery/therapy, heparin prophylaxis, surgical instruments and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Univariate analysis showed lymphadenectomy as the only significant risk factor for the development of LC post-RP (P = 0.007). When applying multivariate analyses using stepwise logistic regression, only lymphadenectomy was associated with a significant risk for lymphoceles (odds ratio = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.3-4.9, P = 0.004). Adjusting for other factors, no other factor came close to being significant (P < 0.05). All symptomatic LC were successfully treated without further sequelae.  Conclusions:   Subclinical LC post-RP are more common than thought, and rarely necessitate intervention. Pelvic lymphadenectomy represents the only significant factor contributing to LC-development.

We aimed to describe contemporary experience and association of clinical factors with Prostate specific antigen (PSA) response and disease progression, in mCRPC progressing on GnRH-agonist, antiandrogen, antiandrogen withdrawal, and treated with ketoconazole.  Methods:   Data were retrospectively analyzed in all mCRPC patients treated with ketoconazole. Patients continued GnRH-agonist, and treated with ketoconazole 200-400 mg 3× a day until dose-limiting toxicity or disease progression. A multivariate cox regression model was used to identify clinical factors associated with PSA response and disease progression.  Results:   From 1999 to 2010, 114 mCRPC patients were treated with ketoconazole. With a median follow-up time of 31 months (range 5-129), 25 patients (22%) had grade 3/4 toxicity, most commonly fatigue, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and dizziness. Sixty-one patients (54%) had ≥50% PSA decline. Median time to progression was 8 months (range 1-129).

Methods:   LNCaP cells were treated with T and/or PRL. CPD expression was measured. Regulation by T (low doses) was determined using transfected cells overexpressing 5α-reductase type-1 (5αR1), which converts T to the more potent dihydrotestosterone. The effects of siRNAs targeting CPD (siCPDs) on NO production, cell viability, and apoptosis were determined using DAF2-DA, MTS, and Annexin-V assays. The effects of PRL/T on CPD/NO levels in PC-3, MDA-PCa-2b, and 22Rv1 cells were also evaluated.  Results:   In LNCaP cells, 10 nM T and 10 ng/ml PRL-upregulated CPD mRNA/protein levels. In pTRE-transfectants, 1 nM T-upregulated CPD mRNA levels by ∼2-fold over controls, whereas 0.1 nM T caused similar upregulation in pTRE-5αR1-transfectants. In LNCaP cells cultured in arginine-free medium, addition of furylacryloyl-Ala-Arg (FAR; CPD substrate) increased NO levels.

In particular, metadherin (MTDH) has been demonstrated to have a critical role in chemoresistance. Over-expression of MTDH correlates with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer, neuroblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. MTDH is also highly expressed in advanced endometrial cancers, a disease for which new therapies are urgently needed. In this present study, we focused on the therapeutic benefit of MTDH depletion in endometrial cancer cells to restore sensitivity to cell death. Cells were treated with a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which promotes death of malignant cells of the human reproductive tract, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which have been shown to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Our data indicate that depletion of MTDH in endometrial cancer cells resulted in sensitization of cells that were previously resistant in response to combinatorial treatment with TRAIL and the HDAC inhibitor LBH589. MTDH knockdown reduced the proportion of cells in S and increased cell arrest in G2/M in cells treated with LBH589 alone or LBH589 in combination with TRAIL, suggesting that MTDH functions at the cell cycle checkpoint to accomplish resistance. Using microarray technology, we identified 57 downstream target genes of MTDH, including calbindin 1 and galectin-1, which may contribute to MTDH-mediated therapeutic resistance. On the other hand, in MTDH depleted cells, inhibition of PDK1 and AKT phosphorylation along with increased Bim expression and XIAP degradation correlated with enhanced sensitivity to cell death in response to TRAIL and LBH589. These findings indicate that targeting or depleting MTDH is a potentially novel avenue for reversing therapeutic resistance in patients with endometrial cancer.""","""['Xiangbing Meng', 'Pavla Brachova', 'Shujie Yang', 'Zhi Xiong', 'Yuping Zhang', 'Kristina W Thiel', 'Kimberly K Leslie']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The oncogene metadherin modulates the apoptotic pathway based on the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member TRAIL (Tumor Necrosis Factor-related Apoptosis-inducing Ligand) in breast cancer.', 'c-FLIP degradation mediates sensitization of pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589.', 'A histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 downregulates XIAP in mesothelioma cell lines which is likely responsible for increased apoptosis with TRAIL.', 'The histone deacetylase inhibitor suberic bishydroxamate: a potential sensitizer of melanoma to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induced apoptosis.', 'The multifaceted role of MTDH/AEG-1 in cancer progression.', 'A ciprofloxacin derivative with four mechanisms of action overcomes paclitaxel resistance in p53-mutant and MDR1 gene-expressing type II human endometrial cancer.', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors: A Promising Therapeutic Alternative for Endometrial Carcinoma.', 'Galectins in Glioma: Current Roles in Cancer Progression and Future Directions for Improving Treatment.', 'Emerging Role and Clinicopathological Significance of AEG-1 in Different Cancer Types: A Concise Review.', 'Multifunctional Role of Astrocyte Elevated Gene-1 (AEG-1) in Cancer: Focus on Drug Resistance.']"""

During this process, the effects of a specific mutation on the incipient cancer cell may dictate the nature of subsequent mutations that can be tolerated or selected for, affecting the rate at which subsequent mutations occur. Here we have used a new mouse model of prostate cancer that recapitulates several salient features of the human disease to examine the relative rates in which the remaining wild-type alleles of Pten and p53 tumor suppressor genes are lost. In this model, focal overexpression of c-MYC in a few prostate luminal epithelial cells provokes a mild proliferative response. In the context of compound Pten/p53 heterozygosity, c-MYC-initiated cells progress to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) and adenocarcinoma lesions with marked heterogeneity within the same prostate glands. Using laser capture microdissection and gene copy number analyses, we found that the frequency of Pten loss was significantly higher than that of p53 loss in mPIN but not invasive carcinoma lesions. c-MYC overexpression, unlike Pten loss, did not activate the p53 pathway in transgenic mouse prostate cells, explaining the lack of selective pressure to lose p53 in the c-MYC-overexpressing cells.

Each encounter was dual coded for the presence or absence of 9 elements that reflect several important dimensions of IDM, such as information sharing, patient empowerment, and engaging patients in preference clarification. An IDM-9 score (range = 0-9) was determined for each encounter by summing the number of elements that were coded as present. Estimates of coding reliability and internal consistency were calculated.  Results:   Male patients tended to be white (59%), married (70%), and between the ages of 50 and 59 (70%). Physicians tended to be white (90%), male (74%), and have more than 10 years of practice experience (74%). IDM-9 scores ranged from 0 to 7.5 (mean [SD], 2.7 [2.1]).

Methods:   Associations between serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) levels and lung cancer were analyzed among 270 case patients and 296 control subjects participating in the National Cancer Institute-Maryland (NCI-MD) case-control study. Results were validated in 532 case patients and 595 control subjects in a nested case-control study within the prospective Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Association with C-reactive protein (CRP), a systemic inflammation biomarker, was also analyzed. Associations between biomarkers and lung cancer were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for smoking, stage, histology, age, and sex. The 10-year standardized absolute risks of lung cancer were estimated using a weighted Cox regression model.  Results:   Serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels in the highest quartile were associated with lung cancer in the NCI-MD study (IL-6, odds ratio [OR] = 3.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.88 to 5.77; IL-8, OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.19 to 3.57) and with lung cancer risk in the PLCO study (IL-6, OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.04 to 2.10; IL-8, OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.10 to 2.24), compared with the lowest quartile.

Objective:   To evaluate gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities in men treated with either primary radiation or conservative management for T1-T2 prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed a population-based cohort study, using Medicare claims data linked to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data. Competing risk models were used to evaluate the risks.  Measurements:   GI toxicities requiring interventional procedures occurring at least 6 mo after cancer diagnosis.  Results and limitations:   Among 41,737 patients in this study, 28,088 patients received radiation therapy. The most common GI toxicity was GI bleeding or ulceration. GI toxicity rates were 9.3 per 1000 person-years after three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, 8.9 per 1000 person-years after intensity-modulated radiotherapy, 5.3 per 1000 person-years after brachytherapy alone, 20.1 per 1000 person-years after proton therapy, and 2.1 per 1000 person-years for conservative management patients. Radiation therapy is the most significant factor associated with an increased risk of GI toxicities (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.97-5.66). Even after 5 yr, the radiation group continued to experience significantly higher rates of new GI toxicities than the conservative management group (HR: 3.01; 95% CI, 2.06-4.39). Because our cohort of patients were between 66 and 85 yr of age, these results may not be applicable to younger patients.

High activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule expression levels were significantly associated with favorable tumor features (pT: P = .0015; pN: P = .0008; preoperative prostate-specific antigen: P = .0057) and a lower risk of a biochemical recurrence (P = .0067). Cytoplasmatic activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule staining was usually associated with membranous staining. The small number of cancers with pure cytoplasmatic staining did not reveal any particularities with respect to clinical outcome or tumor phenotype. It is concluded that activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule protein is almost always expressed in prostate cancer and that decreased levels of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule expression may lead to an aggressive behavior of tumor cells. The abundant presence of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule and its membranous localization in prostate cancer epithelium make activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule a potentially attractive structure for targeted therapy.""","""['Sarah Minner', 'Franziska Kraetzig', 'Michael Tachezy', 'Ergin Kilic', 'Markus Graefen', 'Waldemar Wilczak', 'Carsten Bokemeyer', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Guido Sauter', 'Thorsten Schlomm']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Biologic role of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule overexpression in breast cancer cell lines and clinical tumor tissue.', 'Immunological microenvironment in prostate cancer: high mast cell densities are associated with favorable tumor characteristics and good prognosis.', 'Subcellular localization of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule is a molecular predictor of survival in ovarian carcinoma patients.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: from theory to practice.', 'Prognostic value of CD166 expression in cancers of the digestive system: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', ""Expression of ALCAM in Clinical Colon Cancer and Relationship With Patients' Treatment Responses."", 'Proteome profiling of enzalutamide-resistant cell lines and serum analysis identified ALCAM as marker of resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM)/CD166 in pancreatic cancer, a pivotal link to clinical outcome and vascular embolism.', 'Significant co-expression of putative cancer stem cell markers, EpCAM and CD166, correlates with tumor stage and invasive behavior in colorectal cancer.', 'The Clinical and Theranostic Values of Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (ALCAM)/CD166 in Human Solid Cancers.']"""

This approach allows to focus the dose to the target region while sparing healthy surrounding tissue. However, the flexibility in the placement of treatment beams is also a challenge during treatment planning. We study an approach to make the search for treatment beams more efficient by considering previous treatment plans.  Methods and material:   Conventionally, a beam generation heuristic based on randomly selected candidate beams has been proven to be most robust in clinical practice. However, for prevalent types of cancer similarities in patient anatomy and dose prescription exist. We present a case-based approach that introduces a problem specific measure of similarity and allows to generate candidate beams from a database of previous treatment plans. Similarity between treatments is established based on projections of the organs and structures considered during planning, and the desired dose distribution. Solving the inverse planning problem a subset of treatment beams is determined and adapted to the new clinical case.  Results:   Preliminary experimental results indicate that the new approach leads to comparable plan quality for substantially fewer candidate beams. For two prostate cases, the dose homogeneity in the target region and the sparing of critical structures is similar for plans based on 400 and 600 candidate beams generated with the novel and the conventional method, respectively. However, the runtime for solving the inverse planning problem for could be reduced by up to 47%, i.e., from approximately 19 min to less than 11 min.

LIMK1 levels are increased in several human cancers, with LIMK1 over-expression in prostate and breast cancer cells leading to tumor progression. While it has been presumed that the mechanism by which LIMK1 promotes cancer progression is via its cytoplasmic effects, the role of nuclear vs cytoplasmic LIMK1 in the tumorigenic process has not been examined.  Results:   To determine if cytoplasmic or nuclear LIMK1 expression correlated with breast cancer, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of breast tissue microarrays (TMAs), The IHC analysis of breast TMAs revealed that 76% of malignant breast tissue samples strongly expressed LIMK1 in the cytoplasm, with 52% of these specimens also expressing nuclear LIMK1. Only 48% of benign breast samples displayed strong cytoplasmic LIMK1 expression and 27% of these expressed nuclear LIMK1. To investigate the respective roles of cytoplasmic and nuclear LIMK1 in breast cancer progression, we targeted GFP-LIMK1 to cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular compartments by fusing nuclear export signals (NESs) or nuclear localization sequences (NLS), respectively, to the amino-terminus of GFP-LIMK1. Stable pools of MDA-MB-231 cells were generated by retroviral transduction, and fluorescence microscopy revealed that GFP alone (control) and GFP-LIMK1 were each expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas NLS-GFP-LIMK1 was expressed in the nucleus and NES-GFP-LIMK1 was expressed in the cytoplasm. Western blot analyses revealed equal expression of GFP-LIMK1 and NES-GFP-LIMK1, with NLS-GFP-LIMK1 expression being less but equal to endogenous LIMK1. Also, Western blotting revealed increased levels of phospho-cofilin, phospho-FAK, phospho-paxillin, phospho-Src, phospho-AKT, and phospho-Erk1/2 in cells expressing all GFP-LIMK1 fusions, compared to GFP alone. Invasion assays revealed that all GFP-LIMK1 fusions increased MDA-MB-231 cell invasion ~1.5-fold, compared to GFP-only control cells. Tumor xenograft studies in nude mice revealed that MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing GFP-LIMK, NLS-GFP-LIMK1 and NES-GFP-LIMK1 enhanced tumor growth 2.5-, 1.6- and 4.7-fold, respectively, compared to GFP-alone.

Gene expression data could provide insight into this question, but it is difficult to distinguish between a gene that causes a change in gene expression from a gene that is affected by this change. Furthermore, the proteins that regulate gene expression are often themselves not regulated at the transcriptional level. Here we propose a Bayesian modeling framework we term RegNetB that uses mechanistic information about the gene regulatory network to distinguish between factors that cause a change in expression and genes that are affected by the change. We test this framework using human gene expression data describing localized prostate cancer progression.  Results:   The top regulatory relationships identified by RegNetB include the regulation of RLN1, RLN2, by PAX4, the regulation of ACPP (PAP) by JUN, BACH1 and BACH2, and the co-regulation of PGC and GDF15 by MAZ and TAF8. These target genes are known to participate in tumor progression, but the suggested regulatory roles of PAX4, BACH1, BACH2, MAZ and TAF8 in the process is new.

Prostate and bladder cancers in particular may be underreported due to increased availability of outpatient care. Thus, there is a critical need to develop systems to completely and accurately capture longitudinal data to understand the true patterns of care and outcomes for these cancers.  Methods:   We determined the accuracy and impact of automated software to capture and process billing data to supplement reporting of cancers diagnosed and treated in a large community urology practice. From these data, we estimated numbers of unreported cancers for an actively reporting and for a non-reporting practice and the associated impact for a central cancer registry.  Results:   The software automatically processed billing data representing 26,133 visits for 15,495 patients in the 3.5-month study period. Of these, 2,275 patients had a cancer diagnosis and 87.2% of these matched with a central registry case. The estimated annual number of prostate and bladder cancers remaining unreported from this practice was 158. If the practice were not actively reporting, the unreported cases were estimated at 1,111, representing an increase of 12% to the registry. Treatments added from billing varied by treatment type with the largest proportion of added treatments for biologic response modifiers (BRMs) (127%-166%) and chemotherapy (22%).  Conclusion:   Automated processing of billing data from community urology practices offers an opportunity to enhance capture of missing prostate and bladder cancer surveillance data with minimal effort to a urology practice.

After its original discovery in prostate cancer tissue from North American patients, it was subsequently detected in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome from the same continent. However, most other research groups, mainly from Europe, reported negative results. The positive results could possibly be attributed to contamination with mouse products in a number of cases, as XMRV is nearly identical in nucleotide sequence to endogenous retroviruses in the mouse genome. But the detection of integrated XMRV proviruses in prostate cancer tissue proves it to be a genuine virus that replicates in human cells, leaving the question: how did XMRV enter the human population? We will discuss two possible routes: either via direct virus transmission from mouse to human, as repeatedly seen for, e.g., Hantaviruses, or via the use of mouse-related products by humans, including vaccines.

Toward this end, we constructed Bac-hEA that mediated transient hEA expression and Bac-ITR-hEA that exploited the adeno-associated virus inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) for prolonged hEA expression. Western blot and ELISA analyses showed that both Bac-hEA and Bac-ITR-hEA expressed hEA in transduced mammalian cells, yet Bac-ITR-hEA only marginally prolonged the hEA expression. In comparison with Bac-hEA, nonetheless, Bac-ITR-hEA significantly enhanced the hEA expression level that concurred with augmented antiangiogenic properties, as demonstrated by cell proliferation, migration and tubule network formation assays. Importantly, intratumoral injection of Bac-ITR-hEA into prostate cancer mouse models, when compared with Bac-hEA, exerted stronger antiangiogenic effects in vivo, more potently inhibited tumor growth and significantly prolonged mouse survival.

This study presents evidence that TGF-β-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) signaling in tumor cells promotes bone destruction by metastatic breast carcinoma cells, controlling expression of prometastatic factors including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and COX2. Suppression of TAK1 signaling by dominant-negative TAK1 (dn-TAK1) in breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells impairs bone colonization by carcinoma cells and bone osteolysis in the intracardiac injection model. Mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of TAK1 by dn-TAK1 or siRNA blocked expression of factors implicated in bone metastasis, such as MMP-9, COX2/PTGS2, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), but did not affect activation of p38MAPK by TGF-β. TAK1 signaling is mediated by TAK1-binding partners TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3. Carcinoma cells express elevated mRNA levels of TAB2 and TAB3, whereas the TAB1 expression is noticeably low. Accordingly, depletion of TAB2 by siRNA reduced expression of MMP-9 and COX2. Together, these studies show that the TAK1-TAB2-TAB3 signaling axis is critical for carcinoma-induced bone lesions, mediating expression of proinvasive and osteolytic factors.

Although BRCA1 interaction with key proteins involved in DNA repair is well known, its role as a coregulator in the transcriptional response to DNA damage remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that BRCA1 plays a central role in the transcriptional response to genotoxic stress in prostate cancer. BRCA1 expression mediates apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and decreased viability in response to doxorubicin treatment. Xenograft studies using human prostate carcinoma PC3 cells show that BRCA1 depletion results in increased tumor growth. A focused survey of BRCA1-regulated genes in prostate carcinoma reveals that multiple regulators of genome stability and cell-cycle control, including BLM, FEN1, DDB2, H3F3B, BRCA2, CCNB2, MAD2L1, and GADD153, are direct transcriptional targets of BRCA1. Furthermore, we show that BRCA1 targets GADD153 promoter to increase its transcription in response to DNA damage. Finally, GADD153 depletion significantly abrogates BRCA1 influence on cell-cycle progression and cell death in response to doxorubicin treatment.

Sensitivities of PSA≥ 4 and PCA3≥ 35 were 87% vs. 85%, with specificities of 12% vs. 33%, PPV 34% vs. 39% and NPV 63% vs. 81%, respectively. The PCA3 score showed direct correlation with the percentage of positive biopsies (P<.0001).  Conclusions:   Routine use of PCA3, due to its high NPV, results in a significant reduction in the number of biopsies. PCA3 appears to be more efficient in biopsy-naive patients.

Tumor cells commonly express the embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) that may contribute to the metabolism shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and tumorigenesis. Here we show that PKM2 is acetylated on lysine 305 and that this acetylation is stimulated by high glucose concentration. PKM2 K305 acetylation decreases PKM2 enzyme activity and promotes its lysosomal-dependent degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Acetylation increases PKM2 interaction with HSC70, a chaperone for CMA, and association with lysosomes. Ectopic expression of an acetylation mimetic K305Q mutant accumulates glycolytic intermediates and promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth.

Alterations in macrophage number and function during lung tumorigenesis suggest that these immune effector cells stimulate lung cancer growth. Evidence from cancer models in other tissues suggests that cancer cells actively recruit growth factor-producing macrophages through a reciprocal signaling pathway. While the levels of lung macrophages increase during tumor progression in mouse models of lung cancer, and high pulmonary macrophage content correlates with a poor prognosis in human non-small cell lung cancer, the specific role of alveolar macrophages in lung tumorigenesis is not clear.  Methods:   After culturing either an immortalized lung macrophage cell line or primary murine alveolar macrophages from naïve and lung-tumor bearing mice with primary tumor isolates and immortalized cell lines, the effects on epithelial proliferation and cellular kinase activation were determined. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was quantified by ELISA, and macrophage conditioned media IGF-1 levels manipulated by IL-4 treatment, immuno-depletion and siRNA transfection.  Results:   Primary macrophages from both naïve and lung-tumor bearing mice stimulated epithelial cell proliferation. The lungs of tumor-bearing mice contained 3.5-times more IGF-1 than naïve littermates, and media conditioned by freshly isolated tumor-educated macrophages contained more IGF-1 than media conditioned by naïve macrophages; IL-4 stimulated IGF-1 production by both macrophage subsets. The ability of macrophage conditioned media to stimulate neoplastic proliferation correlated with media IGF-1 levels, and recombinant IGF-1 alone was sufficient to induce epithelial proliferation in all cell lines evaluated. Macrophage-conditioned media and IGF-1 stimulated lung tumor cell growth in an additive manner, while EGF had no effect. Macrophage-derived factors increased p-Erk1/2, p-Akt and cyclin D1 levels in neoplastic cells, and the combined inhibition of both MEK and PI3K ablated macrophage-mediated increases in epithelial growth.  Conclusions:   Macrophages produce IGF-1 which directly stimulates neoplastic proliferation through Erk and Akt activation. This observation suggests that combining macrophage ablation therapy with IGF-1R, MEK and/or PI3K inhibition could improve therapeutic response in human lung cancer. Exploring macrophage-based intervention could be a fruitful avenue for future research.""","""['Jason M Fritz', 'Lori D Dwyer-Nield', 'Alvin M Malkinson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['IL-4-induced macrophage-derived IGF-I protects myofibroblasts from apoptosis following growth factor withdrawal.', 'Leukocyte antigen-related deficiency enhances insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells and promotes neointima formation in response to vascular injury.', 'The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor kinase inhibitor, NVP-ADW742, sensitizes small cell lung cancer cell lines to the effects of chemotherapy.', 'NO donor and MEK inhibitor synergistically inhibit proliferation and invasion of cancer cells.', 'Weight control and cancer preventive mechanisms: role of insulin growth factor-1-mediated signaling pathways.', 'Microvesicle-Mediated Communication Within the Alveolar Space: Mechanisms of Uptake by Epithelial Cells and Alveolar Macrophages.', 'SphK1 functions downstream of IGF-1 to modulate IGF-1-induced EMT, migration and paclitaxel resistance of A549 cells: A preliminary in vitro study.', 'Dysregulation of Gap Junction Function and Cytokine Production in Response to Non-Genotoxic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in an In Vitro Lung Cell Model.', 'Hydroxyl safflower yellow A regulates the tumor immune microenvironment to produce an anticancer effect in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Understanding the Biology of Self-Renewing Macrophages.']"""

Aim:   To assess stretched penile length before and after long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for treatment of PCa.  Methods:   From January 2008 to June 2010 at a single institution, 39 consecutive patients without distant metastases who were elected to receive ADT as initial therapy for PCa were prospectively enrolled. Exclusion criteria were history of penile anomalies and/or trauma, and prior radical prostate surgery or radiation therapy. Erectile functions were evaluated at baseline according to the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Vertically stretched penile length was measured every 3 months from the pubopenile junction to the meatus with a spring scale.  Main outcome measure:   After ADT, significant 3-month interval changes in stretched penile length were noted for up to 15 months (P < 0.001). The relationship between potency and penile shortening was not significant (P = 0.45).  Results:   The mean patient age was 67.1 years. Before therapy, the mean stretched penile length was 10.76 cm. After 24 months of ADT, mean penile length had decreased to 8.05 cm. However, these changes plateaued after 15 months. Normal erectile function (EF) was reported by 41% of patients before therapy, while 10.5% reported normal EF at the 24-month follow-up. The relationship between potency and penile shortening was not significant. However, patients who preserved their potency tended to experience less penile shortening.

We developed a collaborative study in each database.  Main outcome measure:   Sexual function and bother were estimated before treatment with validated English and Japanese versions of the University of California in Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA PCI).  Results:   The CA reported the highest sexual function score of all. Even after controlling for age, prostate specific antigen, clinical T stage, Gleason score and comorbidity, the JP were more likely than the CA to report poor sexual desire, poor erection ability, poor overall ability to function sexually, and poor ability to attain orgasm. With regard to sexual bother, however, no differences were reported between CA and JP. The JA reported sexual function closely approximate that of the JP, and they were less likely than the CA to report erection ability and intercourse. The JA were more likely to feel distress from their sexual function than the CA. When the JA were divided into two groups according to the ethnicity of their partners, UCLA PCI sexual function scores were equivalent between JA-partnered men and men partnered with other races.

Methods:   Consecutive series, follow-up at one point in calendar time of men having undergone radical prostatectomy (open surgery or robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery) at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 2002-2006.

Results:   Of the 1,288 men providing information, 691 were sexually active. Altogether, 268 men reported orgasm-associated urinary incontinence, of whom 230 (86%) were otherwise continent. When comparing them with the 422 not reporting the symptom but being sexually active, we found a prevalence ratio (with 95% confidence interval) of 1.5 (1.2-1.8) for not being able to satisfy the partner, 2.1 (1.1-3.5) for avoiding sexual activity because of fear of failing, 1.5 (1.1-2.1) for low orgasmic satisfaction, and 1.4 (1.2-1.7) for having sexual intercourse infrequently.

To analyse whether the use of treatment-specific criteria for repeat biopsy maintains the usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level for detecting high grade cancers.  Patients and methods:   The REDUCE study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of whether dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) reduced the risk of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer in men with a previous negative biopsy. The usefulness of PSA was evaluated using biopsy thresholds defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in the placebo group and any rise in PSA from nadir (the lowest PSA level achieved while in the study) in the dutasteride group. The number of cancers detected on biopsy in the absence of increased/suspicious PSA level as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for high grade prostate cancer detection were analysed by treatment group. Prostate cancer pathological characteristics were compared between men who did and did not meet biopsy thresholds.  Results:   Of 8231 men randomized, 3305 (dutasteride) and 3424 (placebo) underwent at least one prostate biopsy during the study and were included in the analysis. If only men meeting biopsy thresholds underwent biopsy, 25% (47/191) of Gleason 7 and 24% (7/29) of Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the dutasteride group, and 37% (78/209) of Gleason 7 and 22% (4/18) Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the placebo group. In both groups, the incidence of Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancers generally increased with greater rises in PSA. Sensitivity of PSA kinetics was higher and specificity was lower for the detection of Gleason 7-10 cancers in men treated with dutasteride vs placebo. Men with Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancer meeting biopsy thresholds had greater numbers of positive cores, percent core involvement, and biopsy cancer volume vs men not meeting thresholds.  Conclusion:   Using treatment-specific biopsy thresholds, the present study shows that the ability of PSA kinetics to detect high grade prostate cancer is maintained with dutasteride compared with placebo in men with a previous negative biopsy. The sensitivity of PSA kinetics with dutasteride was similar to (Gleason 8-10) or higher than (Gleason 7-10) the placebo group; however, biopsy decisions based on a single increased PSA measurement from nadir in the dutasteride group resulted in a lower specificity compared with using a comparable biopsy threshold in the placebo group, indicating the importance of confirmation of PSA measurements.""","""['Michael Marberger', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'Mark Emberton', 'Curtis Pettaway', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Claudio Teloken', 'Roger S Rittmaster', 'Matthew C Somerville', 'Ramiro Castro']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise as a marker of prostate cancer in men treated with dutasteride: lessons from the REDUCE study.', 'Clinical usefulness of serum prostate specific antigen for the detection of prostate cancer is preserved in men receiving the dual 5alpha-reductase inhibitor dutasteride.', 'The effect of dutasteride on the usefulness of prostate specific antigen for the diagnosis of high grade and clinically relevant prostate cancer in men with a previous negative biopsy: results from the REDUCE study.', 'Prostate cancer gene 3 score predicts prostate biopsy outcome in men receiving dutasteride for prevention of prostate cancer: results from the REDUCE trial.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

To shorten procedure time and consequently increase patient comfort and system accuracy, a prototype of a MRI-compatible master-slave needle driver module using piezo motors was also added to the base robot.  Results:   Variable size workspace was achieved using appropriate link length, compared with the previous design. The 5-DOF targeting accuracy demonstrated an average error of 2.5 mm (STD = 1.37 mm) in a realistic phantom inside a 3T magnet with a bevel-tip 18G needle. The average position tracking error of the master-slave needle driver was always below 0.1 mm.  Conclusion:   Phantom experiments showed sufficient accuracy for manual prostate biopsy.

Controlled release of DTX with a dosage suitable for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy has been achieved for 35 days. The device consists of a drug-loaded microreservoir (Ø6 mm ×∼550 μm), sealed by an elastic magnetic PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) membrane (Ø6 mm × 40 μm) with a laser-drilled aperture (∼100 × 100 μm(2)). By applying a magnetic field, the magnetic PDMS membrane deforms, causing the discharge of the drug solution from the device. Controlled DTX release at a rate of 171 ± 16.7 ng per actuation interval has been achieved for 35 days using a 255 mT magnetic field. The background leakage of drug solution through the aperture was negligible at 0.053 ± 0.014 ng min(-1). The biological activity of the released drug was investigated using a cytotoxicity assay (cell apoptosis) for two cell lines, HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and PC3 (prostate cancer) cells. Reproducible release rates have been achieved and DTX within the PDMS MEMS reservoir maintains full pharmacological efficacy for more than two months.

Our study included a total of 72 cell lines, which included 58 of the 60 human cancer cell lines used in anticancer drug screens and maintained at the NCI-Frederick (NCI-60).

The resultant promoter was designated clone 880-8, showing the highest dose-dependent activity enhancement with X-ray irradiation (X-irradiation). A recombinant retrovirus expressing the luciferase gene under the control of clone 880-8 was infected into LNCap cells that showed 9.12±0.36-fold enhancement of luciferase activity 12 h after X-irradiation at 10 Gy.

However the effect of glucosamine on tumor cells and the involved molecular mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. Glucosamine enters the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) downstream of the rate-limiting step catalyzed by the GFAT (glutamine:fluctose- 6-phosphate amidotransferase), providing UDPGlcNAc substrates for O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) protein modification. Considering that O-GlcNAc modification of proteasome subunits inhibits its activity, we examined whether glucosamine induces growth inhibition via affecting proteasomal activity. In the present study, we found glucosamine inhibited proteasomal activity and the proliferation of ALVA41 prostate cancer cells. The inhibition of proteasomal activity results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, followed by induction of apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrated that glucosamine downregulated proteasome activator PA28γ and overexpression of PA28γ rescued the proteasomal activity and growth inhibition mediated by glucosamine. We further demonstrated that inhibition of O-GlcNAc abrogated PA28γ suppression induced by glucosamine.

Here we show that mice that are genetically deficient in IGFBP-3 exhibit weaker growth of primary prostate tumors but higher incidence of metastatic disease. Prostates in IGFBP-3 knockout mice (IGFBP-3KO mice) failed to undergo apoptosis after castration. Spontaneous prostate tumors did not develop in IGFBP-3KO mice, but splenic lymphomas occurred in 23% of female IGFBP-3KO mice by 80 weeks of age. To assess the effects of IGFBP-3 deficiency on prostate cancer development, we crossed IGFBP-3KO mice with a c-Myc-driven model of CaP that develops slow-growing, nonmetastatic tumors. By 24 weeks of age, well-differentiated prostate cancers were observed in all mice regardless of IGFBP-3 status. However, by 80 weeks of age IGFBP-3KO mice tended to exhibit larger prostate tumors than control mice. More strikingly, lung metastases were observed at this time in 55% of the IGFBP-3KO mice but none in the control animals. Cell lines established from IGFBP-3KO:Myc tumors displayed more aggressive phenotypes in proliferation, invasion, and colony formation assays, relative to control Myc tumor cell lines.

Methods:   Microarray analysis was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed when epithelial cells were grown in 3D Matrigel culture with stromal co-culture compared to without stroma. Two culture models were employed: primary epithelial cells (ten samples) and an epithelial cell line (three experiments). A separate microarray analysis was performed on each model system and then compared to identify tissue-relevant genes in a cell line model.  Results:   TGF beta signalling was significantly ranked for both model systems and in both models the TGF beta signalling gene SOX4 was significantly down regulated. Analysis of all differentially expressed genes to identify genes that were common to both models found several morphology related gene clusters; actin binding (DIAPH2, FHOD3, ABLIM1, TMOD4, MYH10), GTPase activator activity (BCR, MYH10), cytoskeleton (MAP2, MYH10, TMOD4, FHOD3), protein binding (ITGA6, CD44), proteinaceous extracellular matrix (NID2, CILP2), ion channel/ ion transporter activity (CACNA1C, CACNB2, KCNH2, SLC8A1, SLC39A9) and genes associated with developmental pathways (POFUT1, FZD2, HOXA5, IRX2, FGF11, SOX4, SMARCC1).

Methods:   One hundred sixty newly diagnosed breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancer patients completed questionnaires after diagnosis and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Measures included personality, illness cognitions, emotion, coping and outcome (anxiety, depression and quality of life).  Results:   Between 47-74% of variance in psychosocial outcome was explained although large proportions were accounted for by clinical factors, demographics and earlier levels of anxiety, depression and quality of life.

At least the perioperative advantages (e.g. less blood loss, shorter period of hospitalization), to a large extent, are beyond dispute. The high costs may be compensated by a higher volume of treated patients. Only the treatment of a higher volume of patients will lead to a reduction of infrastructure costs per case.

Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective observational study of 5366 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1986 and 2006 in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.  Main outcome measures:   Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall, prostate cancer-specific, and CVD mortality, and biochemical recurrence, defined by an increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Results:   There were 1630 deaths, 524 (32%) due to prostate cancer and 416 (26%) to CVD, and 878 biochemical recurrences. Absolute crude rates for prostate cancer-specific death for never vs current smokers were 9.6 vs 15.3 per 1000 person-years; for all-cause mortality, the corresponding rates were 27.3 and 53.0 per 1000 person-years. In multivariable analysis, current vs never smokers had an increased risk of prostate cancer mortality (HR, 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-2.32), as did current smokers with clinical stage T1 through T3 (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.04-3.12).

After adjusting for clinical stage and grade (likely intermediates of the relation of smoking with prostate cancer recurrence and survival), current smokers had increased risk of prostate cancer mortality (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.94-2.03), as did current smokers with clinical stage T1 through T3 (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.80-2.49); they also had an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.06-2.04). Greater number of pack-years was associated with significantly increased risk of prostate cancer mortality but not biochemical recurrence. Current smokers of 40 or more pack-years vs never smokers had increased prostate cancer mortality (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.03-3.20) and biochemical recurrence (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.88-2.48).

As the number of men with prostate cancer increases and secondary care resources face pressure, alternative follow-up models are being sought. Current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance recommends follow-up outside the hospital setting for patients who are stable 2 years following radical treatment and for those undergoing 'watchful waiting'.  Objective:   To describe current practice in a sample of relevant health care professionals and to seek their views on the role of primary care in prostate cancer follow-up.  Methods:   Semi-structured telephone interviews with 38 UK health care professionals, from both secondary and primary care. Transcripts were analysed using the constant comparative method.  Results:   There are marked variations in current follow-up practice around the country, with hospital-based follow-up ranging from 6 months to lifetime. The predominant, although not universal, view expressed was that there is both scope and support for primary care to play a greater role, particularly for men with stable disease. This was qualified by the need for supporting education, including guidance on interpretation of prostate-specific antigen values, introduction of robust follow-up systems in primary care, easy access back into secondary (hospital) care, a mechanism for ensuring follow-up data can still be collected for audit purposes and appropriate resourcing.

The criteria that led us not to drain were the satisfactory urethral length, a tension-free anastomosis performed on a bladder catheter with separate sutures, and a lack of anastomotic leack after bladder filling with 200cc.  Results:   The mean hospital stay was 4 days (3-8). Ten patients (71.4%) needed intermittent bladder catherism four times (1-11) before starting micturitions, without any technical difficulties. No anastomic leack was reported. Nine patients (64.3%) were continent leaving the hospital. With a mean follow-up of 30 months (5-48), all of 14 patients (100%) were perfectly continent. No anastomotic stricture was reported.  Conclusion:   RRP without postoperative bladder catheter was feasible, with no other early or late complication associated. Early and late continence were perfect (100% at 2 years).""","""['N Surga', 'A-F Spinoit', 'L Viart', 'X Tillou', 'F Saint', 'J Petit']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prog Urol""","""['Urethral catheter removal 3 days after radical retropubic prostatectomy is feasible and desirable.', 'Early catheter removal 3 days after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Intussusception of the bladder neck does not promote early restoration to urinary continence after non-nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Safety and outcome of early catheter removal after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Simplified vesico-urethral anastomosis after radical retropubic prostatectomy for cancer.

In order to verify that these objectives are achieved, we compared our results of pelvic lymphadenectomy by laparotomy and by laparoscopy for the past 12 years.  Patients and methods:   Between January 1997 and June 2008, 36 (23.8%) patients underwent open pelvic lymphadenectomy and 76.16% (115 cases) laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy. We did a retrospective and comparative analysis of data including the preoperative characteristics, per- and postoperative complication as well pathologic results.  Results:   Preoperative data were comparable between both groups. The comparison of the peroperative data showed an increased bleeding volume in the open group (105.6±420.9mL; 12.1±96.1mL: P=0.001) and longer operative time in the laparoscopic group (103.7±83.9min; 132.8±40.9min: P=0.006). Postoperative complications were similar. Pathologic results showed a significantly more important number of lymph nodes removed in the open group (7.2±3.5; 5.7±3.2: P=0.022), but the positive rate similar in both groups (13.9%; 22.6%: P=0.258). In order to remove ""the learning curve effect"", we compared 36 open pelvic lymphadenectomy to the last 36 laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy. In the laparoscopic group the patients showed an upper Gleason score (6.3±1.1; 7±1: P=0.005); but there was no difference for the operative time, number of lymph nodes removed and the complications rates.

However, the apoptotic mechanism of decursin using primary malignant tumor (RC-58T/h/SA#4)-derived human prostate cells is not known. In the present study, we show that treatment of prostate cancer cells with decursin inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Decursin also induced apoptosis in RC-58T/h/SA#4 cells, as determined by flow cytometry, Hoechst 33258 staining, and DNA fragmentation. Decursin caused activation of caspases-8, -9, and -3 and promoted the apoptotic action of caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage. Decursin increased the protein levels of Bax and cytosolic cytochrome c as well as cleavage of PARP while decreasing the protein levels of Bcl-2. Furthermore, the caspase-independent mitochondrial apoptosis factor, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), was upregulated by treatment with decursin.

We have analyzed differential miRNA expression in PCa cells treated with Res.  Methods and results:   Using miRNA microarrays we found that 23 miRNAs were significantly down-regulated and 28 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated after Res treatment. The down-regulated miRs included miR-17-92 and miR-106ab clusters with well recognized oncogenic properties while the up-regulated miRs included several tumor suppressors. Selected miRs were verified by qRT-PCR, including miR-17, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a and miR106b. Since these miRNAs target PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), we performed Western blot to confirm up-regulation of PTEN in PCa cells. In addition, using TargetScan database, we have identified putative mRNA targets for Res-induced down- and up-regulated miRs. Using a bioinformatics approach, we generated gene networks specifically altered by Res-regulated miRNAs.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that the dietary compound Res may play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis through modulation of miRNA expression: Res down-regulated oncogenic miRs and up-regulated tumor suppressor miRs in PCa cells.

Images during deep respiration and during contraction of abdominal musculature (via a coughing maneuver) were obtained with dynamic two-dimensional (2D) balanced SSFP; 3 frames/s were obtained over an acquisition time of 15 s. Images were acquired in sagittal orientation to evaluate motion along both the craniocaudal (cc)-axis and anteroposterior (ap)-axis.

Fluence optimization as well as sequencing of IMRT plans was primarily performed using Monaco. Dose prediction errors were calculated using MC as reference. The dose-volume histrogram (DVH) analysis was complemented with 2D and 3D gamma evaluation. Both algorithms were compared to measurements using the Delta4 system (Scandidos).  Results:   Recalculated with eCC IMRT plans resulted in lower planned target volume (PTV) coverage, as well as in lower organs-at-risk (OAR) doses up to 8%. Small deviations between MC and eCC in PTV dose (1-2%) were detected for IMRT cases, while larger deviations were observed for SBRT (up to 5%). Conformity indices of both calculations were similar; however, the homogeneity of the eCC calculated plans was slightly better. Delta4 measurements confirmed high dosimetric accuracy of both TPS.

Experimental design:   Normal prostate epithelial cell (RWPE-1), LAPC4 (wild functional AR/ADPC), LNCaP (mutant functional/AR/ADPC), and C4-2b (mutant functional/AR/CRPC) cells were used to test the anti-AR activity of lupeol. Cells grown under androgen-rich environment and treated with lupeol were tested for proliferation, AR transcriptional activity, AR competitive ligand binding, AR-DNA binding, and AR-ARE/target gene binding. Furthermore, in silico molecular modeling for lupeol-AR binding was done. Athymic mice bearing C4-2b and LNCaP cell-originated tumors were treated intraperitoneally with lupeol (40 mg/kg; 3 times/wk) and tumor growth and surrogate biomarkers were evaluated. To assess bioavailability, lupeol serum levels were measured.  Results:   Lupeol significantly inhibited R1881 (androgen analogue) induced (i) transcriptional activity of AR and (ii) expression of PSA. Lupeol (i) competed antagonistically with androgen for AR, (ii) blocked the binding of AR to AR-responsive genes including PSA, TIPARP, SGK, and IL-6, and (iii) inhibited the recruitment of RNA Pol II to target genes. Lupeol sensitized CRPC cells to antihormone therapy. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that lupeol is bioavailable to mice. Lupeol inhibited the tumorigenicity of both ADPC and CRPC cells in animals. Serum and tumor tissues exhibited reduced PSA levels.

However, the efficacy of single-arc VMAT to treat prostate cancer suspicious for extraprostatic extension was heretofore unknown. In this work, we report our institutional experience with single-arc VMAT and fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer patients treated for seminal vesicle and/or lymph node involvement.  Methods:   Single-arc VMAT and 7- or 9-field IMRT treatment plans were compared for 10 prostate cancer patients treated for seminal vesicle involvement and/or lymph node involvement. All treatment plans were constructed using the Philips Pinnacle treatment planning system (v.9.0, Fitchburg, WI) and delivered on an Elekta Infinity radiotherapy accelerator (Crawley, UK). Resulting plans were compared using metrics that characterised dosimetry and delivery efficiency.  Results:   No statistically significant differences in target coverage, target homogeneity or normal tissue doses were noted between the plans (p>0.05). For prostate patients treated for seminal vesicle involvement, VMAT plans were delivered in 1.4±0.1 min (vs 9.5±2.4 min for fixed-beam IMRT) (p<0.01) and required approximately 20% fewer monitor units (p=0.01). For prostate patients treated for lymph node involvement, VMAT plans were delivered in 1.4±0.1 min (vs 11.7±1.3 min for fixed-beam IMRT) (p<0.01) and required approximately 45% fewer monitor units (p<0.01).

Target biopsies were obtained together with 12 core systematic biopsies. Pathological results were correlated with the imaging data.  Results:   Cancers were detected in 269 biopsy sites from 41 patients. 229 sites of cancer were depicted by 3D-GS TRUS and 213 sites were depicted by 3D-PDS. 30 sites were missed by both 3D-GS TRUS and 3D-PDS. Abnormal prostate images depicted by 3D-GS TRUS and 3D-PDS were associated with lesions with a Gleason score of 6.9 or higher.  Conclusion:   The detection rates of prostate cancer were significantly improved with 3D-GS TRUS and 3D-PDS on serum PSA levels >10 ng ml(-1) or 20 ng ml(-1). 3D-GS TRUS and 3D-PDS may improve the biopsy yield by determining appropriate sites for target and systematic biopsies.

In tumors, hypoxia is associated with aggressive disease course and poor clinical outcomes. Furthermore, many aggressive tumors have been shown to display gene expression signatures characteristic of human embryonic stem cells (hESC). We now tested whether hypoxia might be responsible for the hESC signature observed in aggressive tumors. We show that hypoxia, through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), can induce an hESC-like transcriptional program, including the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) inducers, OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC, and microRNA-302 in 11 cancer cell lines (from prostate, brain, kidney, cervix, lung, colon, liver, and breast tumors). Furthermore, nondegradable forms of HIFα, combined with the traditional iPSC inducers, are highly efficient in generating A549 iPSC-like colonies that have high tumorigenic capacity. To test potential correlation between iPSC inducers and HIF expression in primary tumors, we analyzed primary prostate tumors and found a significant correlation between NANOG-, OCT4-, and HIF1α-positive regions. Furthermore, NANOG and OCT4 expressions positively correlated with increased prostate tumor Gleason score. In primary glioma-derived CD133 negative cells, hypoxia was able to induce neurospheres and hESC markers.

However, alternative formulations are needed to overcome the serious side effects, also due to the adjuvant used, and to improve the clinical efficacy of the drug.In the present study, two novel biodegradable block-copolymers, poly(lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLA-PCL) and poly(lactide-co-caprolactone-co-glycolide) (PLGA-PCL), were explored for the formulation of Dtx-loaded NPs and compared with PLA- and PLGA-NPs. The nanosystems were prepared by an original nanoprecipitation method, using Pluronic F-127 as surfactant agent, and were characterized in terms of morphology, size distribution, encapsulation efficiency, crystalline structure, and in vitro release. To evaluate the potential anticancer efficacy of a nanoparticulate system, in vitro cytotoxicity studies on human prostate cancer cell line (PC3) were carried out. NPs were found to be of spherical shape with an average diameter in the range of 100 to 200 nm and a unimodal particle size distribution. Dtx was incorporated into the PLGA-PCL NPs with higher (p < 0.05) encapsulation efficiency than that of other polymers. Differential scanning calorimetry suggested that Dtx was molecularly dispersed in the polymeric matrices. In vitro drug release study showed that release profiles of Dtx varied on the bases of characteristics of polymers used for formulation. PLA-PCL and PLGA-PCL drug loaded NPs shared an overlapping release profiles, and are able to release about 90% of drug within 6 h, when compared with PLA- and PLGA-NPs. Moreover, cytotoxicity studies demonstrated advantages of the Dtx-loaded PLGA-PCL NPs over pure Dtx in both time- and concentration-dependent manner. In particular, an increase of 20% of PC3 growth inhibition was determined by PLGA-PCL NPs with respect to free drug after 72 h incubation and at all tested Dtx concentration. In summary, PLGA-PCL copolymer may be considered as an attractive and promising polymeric material for the formulation of Dtx NPs as delivery system for prostate cancer treatment, and can also be pursued as a validated system in a more large context.""","""['Vanna Sanna', 'Anna Maria Roggio', 'Anna Maria Posadino', 'Annalisa Cossu', 'Salvatore Marceddu', 'Alberto Mariani', 'Valeria Alzari', 'Sergio Uzzau', 'Gianfranco Pintus', 'Mario Sechi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nanoscale Res Lett""","""['Novel docetaxel chitosan-coated PLGA/PCL nanoparticles with magnified cytotoxicity and bioavailability.', 'Co-delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs with vitamin E TPGS by porous PLGA nanoparticles for enhanced chemotherapy against multi-drug resistance.', 'Development of novel PLGA nanoparticles with co-encapsulation of docetaxel and abiraterone acetate for a highly efficient delivery into tumor cells.', 'Skin cancer biology and barriers to treatment: Recent applications of polymeric micro/nanostructures.', 'Challenges and Complications of Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-Based Long-Acting Drug Product Development.', 'Effect of Resveratrol on Pregnancy, Prenatal Complications and Pregnancy-Associated Structure Alterations.', 'Essential Oils Extracted from Boswellia sacra Oleo Gum Resin Loaded into PLGA-PCL Nanoparticles: Enhanced Cytotoxic and Apoptotic Effects against Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Poly(l-lactide-co-caprolactone-co-glycolide)-Based Nanoparticles as Delivery Platform: Effect of the Surfactants on Characteristics and Delivery Efficiency.', 'Development of targeted nanoparticles loaded with antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.', 'Development and Optimization of Acriflavine-Loaded Polycaprolactone Nanoparticles Using Box-Behnken Design for Burn Wound Healing Applications.']"""

Aim:   To compare the efficacy and safety of on-demand 20-mg tadalafil (arm A) with the newly released tadalafil 5-mg once-a-day dosing (arm B) in patients with ED following radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   Randomized study to receive on-demand 20-mg or once-a-day 5-mg tadalafil for 12 weeks. Main Outcome Measures. Changes in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) domain scores and Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) question 2 and 3 positive response rates.  Results:   Fifty-two out of 86 screened patients were randomized. Forty-four patients were evaluable for efficacy.

Transrectal High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) ablation has been used as a minimally invasive treatment for localized prostate cancer for 15 years. Five-year disease-free survival rates of 66-78% have been reported, challenging the results of external-beam radiation therapy. Usually, a 6-mm safety margin is used in the apex to preserve the urinary sphincter and potency. The influence of this 6-mm margin on the results of the treatment has never been assessed. This retrospective study of a cohort of 99 patients who underwent systematic biopsy 3-6 months after HIFU ablation for prostate cancer (with a 6-mm safety margin in the apex) shows that post-HIFU residual cancer is found more frequently in the apex. Therefore, new strategies improving the prostate destruction at the apex while preserving the urinary continence need to be found.  Objective:   • To evaluate whether the location (apex/midgland/base) of prostate cancer influences the risk of incomplete transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) ablation.  Patients and methods:   • We retrospectively studied 99 patients who underwent prostate cancer HIFU ablation (Ablatherm; EDAP, Vaulx-en-Velin, France) with a 6-mm safety margin at the apex, and had systematic biopsies 3-6 months after treatment. • Locations of positive pre- and post-HIFU sextants were compared. • The present study included two analyses. First, sextants negative before and positive after treatment were recoded as positive/positive, hypothesizing that cancer had been missed at pretreatment biopsy. Second, patients with such sextants were excluded.  Results:   • Pre-HIFU biopsies found cancer in all patients and in 215/594 sextants (36.2%); 55 (25.6%) positive sextants were in the apex, 86 (40%) in the midgland and 74 (34.4%) in the base. • After treatment, residual cancer was found in 36 patients (36.4%) and 50 sextants (8.4%); 30 (60%) positive sextants were in the apex, 12 (24%) in the midgland and eight (16%) in the base. • Both statistical analyses found that the locations of the positive sextants before and after HIFU ablation were significantly different (P < 0.001), with a higher proportion of positive apical sextants after treatment. • At the first analysis, the mean (95% confidence interval) probability for a sextant to remain positive after HIFU ablation was 8.8% (3.5-20.3%) in the base, 12.7% (5.8-25.9%) in the midgland and 41.7% (27.2-57.89%) in the apex. • At the second analysis, these same probabilities were 5.9% (1.9-17%), 9.9% (3.9-23.2%) and 27.3% (13.7-47%), respectively.  Conclusion:   • When a 6-mm apical safety margin is used, residual cancer after HIFU ablation is found significantly more frequently in the apex.""","""['Romain Boutier', 'Nicolas Girouin', 'Alexandre Ben Cheikh', 'Aurélien Belot', 'Muriel Rabilloud', 'Albert Gelet', 'Jean-Yves Chapelon', 'Olivier Rouvière']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Single application of high-intensity focused ultrasound as a first-line therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes.', 'Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor the prostate for residual disease or local cancer recurrence after transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound.', 'Evaluation of color Doppler in guiding prostate biopsy after HIFU ablation.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: 5-year experience.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for definitive treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of post-ablation mpMRI as a predictor of residual prostate cancer after focal high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate after focal therapy with high-intensity focused ultrasound.', 'Hyperpolarized MRI of Human Prostate Cancer Reveals Increased Lactate with Tumor Grade Driven by Monocarboxylate Transporter 1.', 'Development of a model to predict prostate cancer at the apex (PCAP model) in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Mechanochemical Disruption Suppresses Metastatic Phenotype and Pushes Prostate Cancer Cells toward Apoptosis.']"""

DOTA-GABA-BBN (7-14) NH(2) was synthesized using a standard Fmoc strategy. Labeling with (67)Ga was performed at 95°C for 30 minutes in ammonium acetate buffer (pH = 4.8). Radiochemical analysis involved ITLC and HPLC methods. The stability of radiopeptide was examined in the presence of human serum at 37°C up to 24 hours. The receptor-bound internalization and externalization rates were studied in GRP receptor expressing PC-3 cells. Biodistribution of radiopeptide was studied in nude mice bearing PC-3 tumor. Labeling yield of >90% was obtained corresponding to a specific activity of approximatrly 2.6 MBq/nmol. Peptide conjugate showed good stability in the presence of human serum. The radioligand showed a good and specific internalization into PC-3 cells (16.13% ± 0.71% at 4 hours). After 4 hours, a considerable amount of activity (52.42% ± 1.86%) was externalized. In animal biodistribution studies, a receptor-specific uptake of radioactivity was observed in GRP-receptor-positive organs.

This study investigates the variation in costs, effects, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) associated with chemotherapy in elderly patients with metastatic (M1) prostate cancer (PC) across race/ethnicity subgroups (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and others).  Study design:   Retrospective observational analysis.  Methods:   We examined patients 66 years or older, identified by using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data set, who were diagnosed with M1 PC between 2000 and 2005. Cost data on the basis of Medicare reimbursements were available for 36 months after diagnosis. Mean costs and effects (life-years gained [LYG]) were adjusted for censoring. The baseline scenario examined PC-specific medical costs at 24 months and required survival of at least 3 months. Sensitivity analysis considered sampling uncertainty, selection into treatment, and adjustments to initial model assumptions.  Results:   We identified 3888 patients with M1 PC, of whom 24% (n = 930) received chemotherapy (primarily docetaxel and mitoxantrone). Twenty percent of observations were censored. The full sample ICER was $99,146 per LYG (95% confidence interval [CI], $75,042 to $130,195). Estimates for whites (ICER, $107,095; 95% CI, $78,391 to $148,272), blacks (ICER, $59,887; 95% CI, $22,860 to $121,509), and others (ICER, $123,909; 95% CI, $37,782 to $366,376) suggest considerable variation in the likelihood of chemotherapy being cost-effective. Results were similar in sensitivity analysis.  Conclusion:   Chemotherapy use in elderly patients with M1 PC is associated with an ICER of $99,146 per LYG.

Blockade of AR and its ligand, androgen is the basis for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). Nevertheless, a modest increase in the critical levels of AR mRNA and corresponding protein is sufficient for the development of resistance to antiandrogen therapy. A strategy to further downregulate AR mRNA and protein expression in combination with antiandrogen therapy may prevent or delay the development of androgen-independent PCa. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRNAs) perform tumor suppressor functions in various cancers. In this study, we demonstrate that the overexpression of miR 488* downregulates the transcriptional activity of AR and inhibits the endogenous AR protein production in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa cells. In addition, miR 488* blocks the proliferation and enhances the apoptosis of PCa cells. Our data indicate that miR 488* targets AR and is a potential modulator of AR mediated signaling.

We investigated the association between QoL at presentation and survival in prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 673 patients treated at two single-system cancer centers between January 2001 and December 2008. QoL was evaluated using EORTC-QLQ-C30. Patient survival was defined as the time interval between the date of first patient visit and the date of death/date of last contact. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression was performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of QoL.  Results:   Mean age at presentation was 63.2 years. Patient stage of disease at diagnosis was I, 4; II, 464; III, 76; IV, 107; and 22 indeterminate. Median overall survival was 89.1 months (95% CI: 46.1-132.0). QoL scales predictive of survival upon univariate analysis were physical, role, emotional, social, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, and constipation (p < 0.01 for all). Multivariate analyses found fatigue (p = 0.02) and constipation (p = 0.01) to be significantly associated with survival.

The MOSFET arrays were calibrated with an Ir192 source and phantom measurements were performed to check agreement with the treatment planning system. The angular dependence, linearity and constancy of the detectors were evaluated. For in vivo measurements two sites were investigated, transperineal needle implants for prostate cancer and Fletcher suites for cervical cancer. The MOSFETs were inserted into the patients' rectum in theatre inside a modified flatus tube. The patients were then CT scanned for treatment planning. Measured rectal doses during treatment were compared with point dose measurements predicted by the TPS. The MOSFETs were found to require individual calibration factors. The calibration was found to drift by approximately 1% ±0.8 per 500 mV accumulated and varies with distance from source due to energy dependence. In vivo results for prostate patients found only 33% of measured doses agreed with the TPS within ±10%. For cervix cases 42% of measured doses agreed with the TPS within ±10%, however of those not agreeing variations of up to 70% were observed. One of the most limiting factors in this study was found to be the inability to prevent the MOSFET moving internally between the time of CT and treatment. Due to the many uncertainties associated with MOSFETs including calibration drift, angular dependence and the inability to know their exact position at the time of treatment, we consider them to be unsuitable for in vivo dosimetry in rectum for HDR brachytherapy.""","""['Aisling Haughey', 'George Coalter', 'Koki Mugabe']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Australas Phys Eng Sci Med""","""['Verification of the plan dosimetry for high dose rate brachytherapy using metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor detectors.', 'Comparison study of MOSFET detectors and diodes for entrance in vivo dosimetry in 18 MV x-ray beams.', 'Feasibility study of using MOSFET detectors for in vivo dosimetry during permanent low-dose-rate prostate implants.', 'Measurement of source strength for 192Ir HDR RALS.', 'Dosimetry procedure to verify dose in High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment of cancer patients: A systematic review.', 'Evolution of Portable Sensors for In-Vivo Dose and Time-Activity Curve Monitoring as Tools for Personalized Dosimetry in Molecular Radiotherapy.', 'In vivo endorectal dosimetry of prostate tomotherapy using dual MOSkin detectors.', 'Characteristics of mobile MOSFET dosimetry system for megavoltage photon beams.', 'In vivo dosimetry: trends and prospects for brachytherapy.', 'On the use of a single-fiber multipoint plastic scintillation detector for 192Ir high-dose-rate brachytherapy.']"""

On the other hand, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors have been less extensively investigated for their potential use in cancer therapy. In prostate cancer, the HATs and coactivators p300 and CBP are upregulated and may induce transcription of androgen receptor (AR)-responsive genes, even in the absence or presence of low levels of AR. To discover a potential anticancer effect of p300/CBP inhibition, we used two different approaches: (i) downregulation of p300 and CBP by specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) and (ii) chemical inhibition of the acetyltransferase activity by a newly developed small molecule, C646. Knockdown of p300 by specific siRNA, but surprisingly not of CBP, led to an increase of caspase-dependent apoptosis involving both extrinsic and intrinsic cell death pathways in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. Induction of apoptosis was mediated by several pathways including inhibition of AR function and decrease of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) subunit p65. Furthermore, cell invasion was decreased upon p300, but not CBP, depletion and was accompanied by lower matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 transcriptions. Thus, p300 and CBP have differential roles in the processes of survival and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells was confirmed by the use of C646. This was substantiated by a decrease of AR function and downregulation of p65 impairing several NF-κB target genes. Taken together, these results suggest that p300 inhibition may be a promising approach for the development of new anticancer therapies.""","""['Frédéric R Santer', 'Philipp P S Höschele', 'Su Jung Oh', 'Holger H H Erb', 'Jan Bouchal', 'Ilaria T Cavarretta', 'Walther Parson', 'David J Meyers', 'Philip A Cole', 'Zoran Culig']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['An inhibitor of the acetyltransferases CBP/p300 exerts antineoplastic effects on gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells.', 'Valproic acid exposure decreases Cbp/p300 protein expression and histone acetyltransferase activity in P19 cells.', 'Epigenetic regulation of proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferase activity.', 'Androgen Receptor Coactivators in Regulation of Growth and Differentiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Current development of CBP/p300 inhibitors in the last decade.', 'The pattern of histone H3 epigenetic posttranslational modifications is regulated by the VRK1 chromatin kinase.', 'Epimutations and Their Effect on Chromatin Organization: Exciting Avenues for Cancer Treatment.', 'Lysine Acetyltransferases and Their Role in AR Signaling and Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibition of CBP/β-catenin signaling ameliorated fibrosis in cholestatic liver disease.', 'Understanding the epigenetic mechanisms in SARS CoV-2 infection and potential therapeutic approaches.']"""

Methods and materials:   Of 14,594 men with cT1c-T3aN0M0 prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy-based radiation from 1991 through 2006, 1,378 (9.4%) with a history of CHF or MI comprised the study cohort. Of these, 22.6% received supplemental external beam radiation, and 42.9% received a median of 4 months of neoadjuvant ADT. Median age was 71.8 years. Median follow-up was 4.3 years. Cox multivariable analysis tested for an association between ADT use and ACM within risk groups, after adjusting for treatment factors, prognostic factors, and propensity score for ADT.  Results:   ADT was associated with significantly increased ACM (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.34; p = 0.0001), with 5-year estimates of 22.71% with ADT and 11.62% without ADT.

Methods and results:   Expression of the Hh pathway components (Shh, Smo, Ptch, Gli1) in the microenvironment of non-neoplastic peripheral zone (n = 119), hormone-naive primary prostate carcinoma (n = 141) and castrate-resistant bone marrow metastases (n = 53) was analysed using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays and bone marrow sections. Results showed that epithelial Shh, Smo and Ptch expression was up-regulated, whereas stromal Smo, Ptch, and Gli1 expression was down-regulated in prostate carcinomas compared to non-neoplastic peripheral zone tissue. Ptch expression was modulated further in high-grade and high-stage primary tumours and in bone marrow metastases. Hh signalling correlated with ki67 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but not with CD31 expression.

As the reason for this variability is unknown, our aim was to investigate the ERG rearrangement frequency with a cohort design.  Methods and results:   We assessed three well-defined cohorts for ERG rearrangements, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The first cohort comprised 119 prostatectomy specimens. The second and third cohorts included incidentally diagnosed PCa [71 cystoprostatectomy specimens, and 105 transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimens]. Seventy of 119 (59%) cases of the prostatectomy cohort harboured ERG rearrangements. Regarding zonal origin, 2/11 (18%) transition zone (TZ) foci and 75/145 (52%) peripheral zone (PZ) foci harboured ERG rearrangements. Within the cystoprostatectomies, 24/71 (34%) cases harboured ERG rearrangements. Regarding zonal origin, 2/9 (22%) TZ foci and 26/86 (30%) PZ foci harboured ERG rearrangements. PCa incidentally identified by TURP harboured ERG rearrangements in 31/105 (29%) cases.  Conclusions:   ERG rearrangements occur in TZ PCa, although at a lower frequency than in PZ PCa. We confirmed that approximately half of all prostatectomies harbour ERG rearrangements.

The pathogenesis of inflammatory cells, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, and prostate cancer is still under investigation. Inflammatory cells by producing free radicals are considered as major and universal contributors to cancerogenesis. PIN is regarded as a precursor lesion to prostate cancer or a marker signaling the vulnerability of the epithelium to neoplastic transformation [1]. Differentiation markers that are frequently changed in early invasive carcinoma are also changed in PIN lesions. In this study, prostate tissue samples obtained during surgical operation and classified as various disease states (inflammation, PIN lesions, and cancer) were examined. The samples were measured by means of microbeam synchrotron-radiation-induced X-ray emission (micro-SRIXE). Special attention was paid to examine the relationship between the earlier-mentioned disorders and changes in relative concentrations of S, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, and Zn. Applying the image-processing program ImageJ enabled us to select the areas of interest from two-dimensional maps of various prostate samples according to the histopathologist's evaluation. Detailed analysis of micro-SRIXE spectra based on multivariate methods shows significant differences between elemental concentrations in inflammatory cells, PIN lesions, and cancerous tissues, which confirms that this method can be used to distinguish various pathological states in prostate tissues. Information obtained in this way may provide better understanding of the biochemistry of unhealthy prostate tissues, thus opening the way to find new medicines/treatments to prevent or slow down some harmful intracellular processes.""","""['A Banas', 'K Banas', 'W M Kwiatek', 'M Gajda', 'B Pawlicki', 'T Cichocki']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biol Inorg Chem""","""['Correlation of concentrations of selected trace elements with Gleason grade of prostate tissues.', 'Trace elemental analysis of normal, benign hypertrophic and cancerous tissues of the prostate gland using the particle-induced X-ray emission technique.', 'Methodological approach for trace and essential elements assessment in prostate tissue by SRIXE method.', 'Molecular biology of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Immunohistochemical expression and localization of somatostatin receptors in normal prostate, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer and its many faces.']"""

The TRUS images do not provide proper spatial localization of malignant tissues due to the poor sensitivity of TRUS to visualize early malignancy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been shown to be sensitive for the detection of early stage malignancy, and therefore, a novel 2D deformable registration method that overlays pre-biopsy MRI onto TRUS images has been proposed.  Method:   The registration method involves B-spline deformations with Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) as the similarity measure computed from the texture images obtained from the amplitude responses of the directional quadrature filter pairs. Registration accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated by computing the Dice Similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD) values for 20 patients prostate mid-gland slices and Target Registration Error (TRE) for 18 patients only where homologous structures are visible in both the TRUS and transformed MR images.  Results:   The proposed method and B-splines using NMI computed from intensities provide average TRE values of 2.64 ± 1.37 and 4.43 ± 2.77 mm respectively. Our method shows statistically significant improvement in TRE when compared with B-spline using NMI computed from intensities with Student's t test p = 0.02. The proposed method shows 1.18 times improvement over thin-plate splines registration with average TRE of 3.11 ± 2.18 mm. The mean DSC and the mean 95% HD values obtained with the proposed method of B-spline with NMI computed from texture are 0.943 ± 0.039 and 4.75 ± 2.40 mm respectively.  Conclusions:   The texture energy computed from the quadrature filter pairs provides better registration accuracy for multimodal images than raw intensities. Low TRE values of the proposed registration method add to the feasibility of it being used during TRUS-guided biopsy.""","""['Jhimli Mitra', 'Robert Martí', 'Arnau Oliver', 'Xavier Lladó', 'Soumya Ghose', 'Joan C Vilanova', 'Fabrice Meriaudeau']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Non-rigid MR-TRUS image registration for image-guided prostate biopsy using correlation ratio-based mutual information.', 'Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'Real-time multimodal image registration with partial intraoperative point-set data.', 'Focal therapy for prostate cancer: the technical challenges.', 'Learning Non-rigid Deformations for Robust, Constrained Point-based Registration in Image-Guided MR-TRUS Prostate Intervention.', 'Non-rigid MR-TRUS image registration for image-guided prostate biopsy using correlation ratio-based mutual information.', 'Population-based prediction of subject-specific prostate deformation for MR-to-ultrasound image registration.']"""

Patients and methods:   Records of cancer patients presenting to King Hussein Cancer Center (Amman, Jordan) between June 2006 and March 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients harboring multiple primary tumors were included for detailed analysis. Data relating to epidemiological features, pathological characteristics, and disease outcomes were extracted.  Results:   Out of 14,040 cases, 319 patients (2.3%) harbored two or more while 23 patients (0.16%) harbored three or more primary malignant tumors. This study included 17 males and six females between 4 and 78 years of age (median, 52 years) at the time of diagnosis of the first malignancy. The most prevalent tumor was colorectal adenocarcinoma found in nine, followed by lymphoma in seven, and prostate adenocarcinoma in six patients. The most common tumor combinations were colorectum-non-melanoma skin, colorectum-kidney, and non-melanoma skin-kidney all found in four patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 96 months from the time of diagnosis of the first primary (range, 2-337 months) and 8 months from the time of diagnosis of the last primary (range, 1-48 months), 13 were alive with no evidence of disease, six were alive with residual disease, three were dead due to disease, and one patient was alive with unknown disease status.  Conclusions:   The possibility of multiple primary malignancies should always be considered during the treatment and follow-up of cancer patients.

This phase II study assessed the outcome and predictive factors for prognosis and toxicity following intermittent chemotherapy with docetaxel, estramustine phosphate, and carboplatin (DEC) in patients with CRPC.  Methods:   Thirty-five patients were treated with a DEC regimen that consisted of a 28-day cycle of drugs as follows: docetaxel (60 mg/m(2) on day 1), carboplatin (AUC 5 on day 1) and estramustine phosphate (560 mg daily). Treatment was continued intermittently. The end point was to test the effect of DEC on the response rate and overall survival (OS). Statistical correlations between the outcomes and predictive factors, including clinical parameters and 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to drug metabolism, were assessed.  Results:   Prostate-specific antigen levels decreased by more than 30% in 65.7% of the patients. The median OS following DEC was 17.8 months, and the median total time of chemotherapy holiday was 7.7 months (range 1.7-35.8). On multivariate analysis, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was an independent prognostic factor for OS (p = 0.007). On SNP analysis, patients carrying the TT genotype of the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism showed a significantly more severe leukocytopenia during the first cycle of DEC therapy compared to patients with the CC + CT genotype (p = 0.036).  Conclusion:   Combination chemotherapy with DEC has a potential effect on CRPC with acceptable toxicity.

Inclusion criteria:   at least two sets of biopsies without evidence of malignancy and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)levels >10 ng/ml or PSA kinetics suggestive of malignancy (rate >0.75 ng/ml/year)and patients with atypia in a previous biopsy.The variables analyzed were: age, abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE), total PSA, free/total PSA ratio, prostate volume, PSA density, previous histopathology, number of cylinders obtained and complications. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square test, Student's t-test and logistic regression.  Results:   Mean age was 66 years (SD ± 6.4), mean total PSA 14.4 ng/ml (SD ± 12.6), mean free/total PSA ratio 0.09 (SD ± 0.09), mean prostate volume 61.6 cc (SD ± 27.4), mean PSA density 0.27 (SD ± 0.26) and mean number of cylinders obtained 30.45 (SD ± 3.8). We diagnosed 32% of the patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma. We observed PSA density was higher in the prostate cancer group, 0.39 (SD ± 0.36), compared to 0.21 (SD ± 0.18) in patients without cancer (p=0.003). Adenocarcinoma was found in 58% of the biopsies in patients with suspicious DRE, compared to 28% with normal DRE (p=0.009). Mean prostate volume in the prostate cancer group was 52.5 (SD ± 24.7)compared to 66.0 (SD ± 27.7)in the group without cancer (p=0.006). In the multivariate analysis, the PSA density (p=0.02; 95% CI 1.36 - 37.36) was the only variable that independently predicted the presence of adenocarcinoma. No statistically significant differences were found in either univariate or multivariate analysis for the remaining variables analyzed. The incidence of complications was similar to that described in the literature for other series.  Conclusions:   Saturation biopsy is safe and effective for detection of prostate cancer.

PSKs are stimulated in synchronous HeLa cells as they progress through mitosis, and these proteins are activated catalytically during each stage of mitosis. During prophase and metaphase activated PSKs are located in the cytoplasm and at the spindle poles, and during telophase and cytokinesis stimulated PSKs are present in trans-Golgi compartments. In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of PSK1-α/β or PSK2 expression inhibits mitotic cell rounding as well as spindle positioning and centralization.

Introduction:   Circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration by using the Cellsearch platform has established prognostic and predictive value in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Limited information exists regarding the clinical utility of CTC enumeration in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). The goal of this study was to prospectively determine the relative clinical utility of CTCs in mHSPC.  Patients and methods:   We analyzed serial CTC in conjunction with other classic biomarkers in 33 consecutive patients treated at the Nevada Cancer Institute with HSPC initiating androgen deprivation therapy and correlated these patients with prognostic prostate-specific antigen (PSA) endpoints and onset of CRPC.  Results:   Initial CTC correlated positively with lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase, and were unrelated to PSA and testosterone. In univariate analysis, baseline CTC, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, testosterone, and follow-up CTC were individual predictors of progression to CRPC. In a multivariate Cox regression, only baseline CTC retained independent predictive value. Threshold analysis revealed the cutpoint that optimized specificity and sensitivity of the test to be 3 cells per 7.5 mL whole blood. Baseline CTC also correlated well with PSA nadir benchmarks.  Conclusions:   Initial CTC values predict the duration and magnitude of response to hormonal therapy.

The isoechogenic nature of prostate carcinoma makes it necessary to sample the gland systematically, resulting in a low sensitivity. Also, it is difficult for the clinician to follow the sampling protocol accurately under 2D US control and the exact anatomical location of the biopsy cores is unknown after the intervention. Tracking systems for prostate biopsies make it possible to generate biopsy distribution maps for intra- and post-interventional quality control and 3D visualisation of histological results for diagnosis and treatment planning. They can also guide the clinician toward non-ultrasound targets. In this paper, a volume-swept 3D US based tracking system for fast and accurate estimation of prostate tissue motion is proposed. The entirely image-based system solves the patient motion problem with an a priori model of rectal probe kinematics. Prostate deformations are estimated with elastic registration to maximize accuracy.

Objective:   To determine whether clinical BPH is associated with an increased risk of PCa incidence and mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using designs with individual participant data from five national registries, we studied the entire Danish male population from 1980 through 2006, a total of 3,009,258 Danish men. We collected PCa diagnoses (n=53,315), information on PCa mortality (n=25,459), and ascertained clinical BPH (not histologically proven BPH) through hospitalization (n=187,591) and/or surgery (n=77,698) from 1980 to 2006 and the use of α-adrenergic receptor antagonists (n=143,365) and/or the use of 5α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) (n=47,465) from 1995 to 2006.  Measurements:   PCa incidence and mortality was assessed for each category of clinical BPH using Kaplan-Meier plots of cumulative incidence and Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for potential confounders.  Results and limitations:   For the entire cohort studies, multivariate-adjusted HRs for PCa incidence were 2.22 (95% confidence interval, 2.13-2.31) in men hospitalized and 3.26 (3.03-3.50) in men operated on for clinical BPH versus general population controls. Corresponding HRs for PCa mortality were 2.00 (1.91-2.08) for hospitalization and 7.85 (7.40-8.32) for surgery. For age-matched cohort studies, corresponding HRs for PCa incidence were 3.04 (2.96-3.13) for hospitalization, 2.60 (2.47-2.73) for surgery, 4.49 (4.33-4.65) for α-adrenergic receptor antagonist use, and 2.54 (2.40-2.68) for 5-ARI use. Each category of clinical BPH has limitations, but limitations differ between the categories and therefore are unlikely to explain the results.  Conclusions:   In Danish men followed for up to 27 yr, clinical BPH was associated with a two- to three-fold increased risk of PCa incidence and with a two- to eight-fold increased risk of PCa mortality.

Many nomograms have been developed to predict the outcome of initial PBx. However, most require information not available at the decision to biopsy.  Methods:   From March 2000 to April 2010, 1551 men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of ≤10 ng/mL who underwent initial extended PBx were included in the present study. The nomogram predictor variables were patient age, race, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, percent free PSA, family history of PCa, and the digital rectal examination findings. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated as a measure of discrimination. The calibration was assessed graphically.  Results:   Of the 1551 men, 606 (39.1%) had PCa on biopsy. The mean value for age, PSA, and percent free PSA was 63.4 years, 5.1 ng/mL, and 21.4%, respectively. Also, 25.1% and 7.8% of patients with positive PBx findings had digital rectal examination abnormalities and a positive family history, respectively.

The area under the curve for all factors in a model predicting PCa was 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.71-0.76). The area under the curve for predicting high-grade PCa was 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.69-0.74).

We investigated the incidence of existing spinal osteoporotic fractures in this population as this is known to be a risk factor for the development of treatment induced fractures.  Materials and methods:   Since 2003 we performed lateral thoracolumbar x-rays on all patients before androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. The heights of T4-L5 vertebral bodies were measured, then reanalyzed by the Eastell method to define grade 1 or worse grade 2 vertebral crush fractures. We used a morphometric algorithm including an age stratified random sample of men with normal thoracolumbar x-rays to quantitatively assess fractures.  Results:   A total of 202 patients with prostate cancer underwent thoracolumbar x-rays before androgen deprivation therapy. Of the patients 61.9% had 1 or more grade 1 and 60.9% had 1 or more grade 2 wedge fractures. In addition, 46.5% of patients had 1 or more grade 1 and 44.6% had greater than 1 grade 2 biconcavity fractures. Finally 63.9% of patients had 1 or more grade 1 and 47.8% had 1 or more grade 2 compression fractures. With conventional reporting 72.4% of patients had no bony abnormality, 14.9% had 1 and 12.7% multiple vertebral crush fractures. Bone mineral density was significantly less in patients with fracture(s) vs those with no abnormality (p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Routine reporting identifies a high incidence of spinal fractures before commencing androgen deprivation therapy, but this is much greater when quantitative assessment is applied. Thoracolumbar x-rays identify the risk of treatment induced fracture and allow baseline comparison in individuals who experience back pain on androgen deprivation therapy. We advocate more routine adoption of baseline thoracolumbar x-rays in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['R Mistry', 'D Hughes', 'V Wadhwa', 'N Parr']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Assessment of men before androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Editorial comment.', 'Factors associated with vertebral fractures in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Osteoporosis and spinal fractures in men with prostate cancer: risk factors and effects of androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Impact of androgen suppression and zoledronic acid on bone mineral density and fractures in the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) 03.04 Randomised Androgen Deprivation and Radiotherapy (RADAR) randomized controlled trial for locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Osteoporosis in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Value and potential limitations of vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) compared to conventional spine radiography: experience from a fracture liaison service (FLS) and a meta-analysis.', 'High prevalence of vertebral fractures at initiation of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Bone health management in the continuum of prostate cancer disease: a review of the evidence with an expert panel opinion.', 'Low rates of bone mineral density measurement in Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer initiating androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Prostate cancer and osteoporosis.']"""

Materials and methods:   Immunohistochemistry method with a 5-MC monoclonal antibody was used to identify the 5-methylcytosine (5-MC) levels in PCTs, PCABTs, LGPIN, and HGPIN specimens in the present study. Statistical analysis with SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used to compare differences of 5-MC levels in the four groups and evaluate the 5-MC alterations in prostate cancer with pathologic grade and clinical prognosis.  Results:   We found that 38 of 48 (79.1%) patients studied showed a decrease in 5-MC staining of PCTs compared with PCABTs. The difference in the methylation levels for the PCTs and the PCABTs was highly statistically significant (P < 0.001). Spearman correlation showed there was no statistically significant association between the average score of 5-MC staining and Gleason score sum. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patient group with no or weak 5-MC staining compared with group with moderate and strong 5-MC staining was associated with better survival of patients, although there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in predicating prognosis (P = 0.385). The average scores of 5-MC staining for LGPIN, HGPIN, PCABTs, and PCTs groups were 6.91, 1.58, 6.63, and 3.10, respectively. The methylation level of HGPIN group, as well as that of PCTs group, was significantly lower than those of LGPIN (P < 0.001; P < 0.001) and PCABTs groups (P < 0.001; P < 0.001), respectively, with the 5-MC levels of PCABTS group similar to that of LGPIN group (P = 0.476). 5-MC levels of HGPIN group was lower than that PCTs group (P = 0.004).  Conclusions:   We found that global DNA methylation was low in most prostate cancer compared with benign regions from the same patient's sections. None of the DNA hypomethylation changes in primary cancers were associated with pathologic grade and clinical prognosis. In addition, immunohistochemistry showed that the global methylation was lower in HGPIN compared with LGPIN and methylcytosine staining in HGPIN was lower than that of PCTs.

Objective:   To study the outcome of routinely obtained 1-yr repeat biopsies and factors predicting reclassification to higher risk, to contribute to risk stratification for men on AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analysed men with low-risk PCa (clinical stage ≤ T2, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 10 ng/ml, PSA density <0.2 ng/ml per millilitre, one or two positive biopsy cores, and Gleason score ≤ 6) who had been included in a prospective AS protocol.  Interventions:   PSA was measured 3-monthly and the first volume-dependent repeat biopsy was scheduled 1 yr after diagnosis, independent of PSA doubling time (PSA-DT). Reclassification to higher risk disease on repeat biopsy was defined as Gleason score ≥ 7 or ≥ 3 positive cores.  Measurements:   We analysed whether baseline patient characteristics and PSA-DT were associated with reclassification to more aggressive PCa on repeat biopsy.  Results and limitations:   A first repeat biopsy was taken in 757 patients after median follow-up of 1.03 yr. The results of repeat biopsies were favourable (no or low-risk PCa) in 594 patients (78.5%) and led to reclassification of risk in 163 (21.5%). Analysis showed that reclassification to higher risk was significantly influenced by the number of initial positive cores (two vs one) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.8; p=0.002) and higher PSA density (OR: 2.1; p=0.003). The outcome was not significantly influenced by age, clinical stage, total number of biopsy cores, or PSA. Adding PSA-DT at time of repeat biopsy to the model showed PSA-DT <3 yr to be significantly associated with reclassification to higher risk (OR: 1.7; p=0.015). Data on tumour involvement per biopsy core were not available.  Conclusions:   Clinical features at baseline and during follow-up in our AS cohort are significantly associated with short-term reclassification to higher risk on repeat biopsy.

Some relapses may be explained by the presence of radioresistant clones arising from hypoxic microenvironment. Since microRNAs (miR) are increased upon hypoxia, the aim of this study was to see whether miR-210 is a potential marker for hypoxia and/or a therapeutic target in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Human LNCaP, DU145 or PC3 prostate cancer cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for several hours. Gene expression of miR-210, miR-373 and several hypoxia markers were analyzed by Taqman and SYBR green qRT-PCR, respectively. Clonogenic survival after LNA miR-210 inhibitor (78 nM) and concomitant irradiation were evaluated.  Results:   During anoxia, CAIX and VEGF expressions were dramatically increased. miR-210 expression increased during anoxia exposure, while basal miR-373 expression was low and remained stable upon anoxia. LNA miR-210 inhibitor decreased anoxic miR-210 expression by 90% and clonogenic survival under anoxia (p=0.01). However, no enhanced effect was observed when miR-210 inhibitor was combined with irradiation.

Although it is commonly accepted that pathway, network and systemic level approaches are more reproducible than reductionism analyses, the meta-analysis of prostate cancer associated molecular signatures at the pathway level remains unexplored. In this article, we performed a meta-analysis of 10 prostate cancer microarray expression datasets to identify the common signatures at both the gene and pathway levels. As the enrichment analysis result of GeneGo's database and KEGG database, 97.8% and 66.7% of the signatures show higher similarity at pathway level than that at gene level, respectively. Analysis by using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method also supported the hypothesis. Further analysis of PubMed citations verified that 207 out of 490 (42%) pathways from GeneGo and 48 out of 74 (65%) pathways from KEGG were related to prostate cancer. An overlap of 15 enriched pathways was observed in at least eight datasets. Eight of these pathways were first described as being associated with prostate cancer. In particular, endothelin-1/EDNRA transactivation of the EGFR pathway was found to be overlapped in nine datasets.

To improve on this model, we introduced the conditional ROSA26 luciferase reporter allele to monitor prostate cancer progression via bioluminescence imaging and extensively backcrossed mice onto the albino C57BL/6 genetic background to address variability in tumor kinetics and to enhance imaging sensitivity. Bioluminescence signal increased rapidly in Pten(p-/-) mice from 3 to 11 weeks, but was much slower from 11 to 52 weeks. Changes in bioluminescence signal were correlated with epithelial proliferation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed progressive increases in prostate volume, which were attributed to excessive fluid retention in the anterior prostate and to expansion of the stroma. Development of invasive prostate cancer in 52-week-old Pten(p-/-) mice was rare, indicating that disease progression was slowed relative to that in previous reports. Tumors in these mice exhibited a spontaneous inflammatory phenotype and were rapidly infiltrated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Although Pten(p-/-) tumors responded to androgen withdrawal, they failed to exhibit relapsed growth for up to 1 year. Taken together, these data identify a mild prostate cancer phenotype in C57BL/6 prostate-specific Pten-deficient mice, reflecting effects of the C57BL/6 genetic background on cancer progression. This model provides a platform for noninvasive assessment of how genetic and environmental risk factors may affect disease progression.""","""['Robert U Svensson', 'Jessica M Haverkamp', 'Daniel R Thedens', 'Michael B Cohen', 'Timothy L Ratliff', 'Michael D Henry']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Mouse models of prostate adenocarcinoma with the capacity to monitor spontaneous carcinogenesis by bioluminescence or fluorescence.', 'Conditional deletion of the Pten gene in the mouse prostate induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasms at early ages but a slow progression to prostate tumors.', 'Timp3 loss accelerates tumour invasion and increases prostate inflammation in a mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'Pten inactivation and the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Cells of origin for cancer: an updated view from prostate cancer.', 'Defining cellular population dynamics at single-cell resolution during prostate cancer progression.', 'δ-Tocotrienol is the Most Potent Vitamin E Form in Inhibiting Prostate Cancer Cell Growth and Inhibits Prostate Carcinogenesis in Ptenp-/- Mice.', 'Syndecan Family Gene and Protein Expression and Their Prognostic Values for Prostate Cancer.', 'Identifying the role of apolipoprotein A-I in prostate cancer.', 'Locally invasive, castrate-resistant prostate cancer in a Pten/Trp53 double knockout mouse model of prostate cancer monitored with non-invasive bioluminescent imaging.']"""

Little is known about the expression of RREB1 isoforms in cell lines or human tumors, or about the clinical relevance of the latter. We have developed tools for IHC of RREB1 protein isoform-specific amplification of RREB1 mRNA and selective knockdown of RREB1 isoforms and use these to provide new information by characterizing RREB1 expression in bladder and prostate cancer cell lines and human tissue samples. Previously described splice variants RREB1α, RREB1β, RREB1γ, and RREB1δ were identified, as well as the novel variant RREB1ε. Total and isoform-specific mRNA expression was lower in most but not all tumors, compared with normal tissues. RREB1 IHC performed on a bladder cancer TMA did not indicate a relationship between total RREB1 expression and overall survival after radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer. In contrast, in vitro proliferation studies using the UMUC-3 bladder cancer cell line after selective isoform-specific knockdown of expression indicate that RREB1α is not necessary for proliferation, but that RREB1β may be required. These contributions should accelerate progress in the nascent RREB1 field by providing new reagents while also providing clues to the role of RREB1 isoforms in human cancer and raising the possibility of isoform-specific roles in human carcinogenesis and progression.""","""['Matthew D Nitz', 'Michael A Harding', 'Steven C Smith', 'Shibu Thomas', 'Dan Theodorescu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Metastatic progression of prostate cancer and e-cadherin regulation by zeb1 and SRC family kinases.', 'ETS variant\xa01 regulates matrix metalloproteinase-7 transcription in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) in prostate, bladder and kidney cancer cell lines and the use of IL-FABP as survival predictor in patients with renal cell carcinoma.', 'Transcription Factor RREB1: from Target Genes towards Biological Functions.', 'Potential molecular targeting of splice variants for cancer treatment.', 'Targeted long-read sequencing of the Ewing sarcoma 6p25.1 susceptibility locus identifies germline-somatic interactions with EWSR1-FLI1 binding.', 'circXRCC5 foster gastric cancer growth and metastasis by the HNRNPC/circXRCC5/miR-655-3p/RREB1/UBA2 positive feedback loop.', 'Knockdown of RREB1 inhibits cell proliferation via enhanced p16 expression in gastric cancer.', 'Pan-cancer analysis of non-coding recurrent mutations and their possible involvement in cancer pathogenesis.', 'Promoter-Level Transcriptome Identifies Stemness Associated With Relatively High Proliferation in Pancreatic Cancer Cells.']"""

EMT triggers tumor metastasis. Exit from EMT is marked by increased E-cadherin expression and is considered necessary for tumor growth at sites of metastasis; however, the mechanisms associated with exit from EMT are poorly understood. Herein are analyzed 185 prostate cancer metastases, with significantly higher E-cadherin expression in bone than in lymph node and soft tissue metastases. To determine the molecular mechanisms of regulation of E-cadherin expression, three stable isogenic cell lines from DU145 were derived that differ in structure, migration, and colony formation on soft agar and Matrigel. When injected into mouse tibia, the epithelial subline grows most aggressively, whereas the mesenchymal subline does not grow. In cultured cells, ZEB1 and Src family kinases decrease E-cadherin expression. In contrast, in tibial xenografts, E-cadherin RNA levels increase eight- to 10-fold despite persistent ZEB1 expression, and in all ZEB1-positive metastases (10 of 120), ZEB1 and E-cadherin proteins were co-expressed. These data suggest that transcriptional regulation of E-cadherin differs in cultured cells versus xenografts, which more faithfully reflect E-cadherin regulation in cancers in human beings. Furthermore, the aggressive nature of xenografts positive for E-cadherin and the frequency of metastases positive for E-cadherin suggest that high E-cadherin expression in metastatic prostate cancer is associated with aggressive tumor growth.""","""['Aaron P Putzke', 'Aviva P Ventura', 'Alexander M Bailey', 'Canan Akture', 'John Opoku-Ansah', 'Müge Celiktaş', 'Michael S Hwang', 'Douglas S Darling', 'Ilsa M Coleman', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Holly M Nguyen', 'Eva Corey', 'Muneesh Tewari', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Beatrice S Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Insulin-like growth factor-I-dependent up-regulation of ZEB1 drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Roles of STAT3 and ZEB1 proteins in E-cadherin down-regulation and human colorectal cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'An hTERT/ZEB1 complex directly regulates E-cadherin to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer.', 'Src-mediated regulation of E-cadherin and EMT in pancreatic cancer.', 'Transcription regulation of E-cadherin by zinc finger E-box binding homeobox proteins in solid tumors.', 'Anti-silencing function 1B knockdown suppresses the malignant phenotype of colorectal cancer by inactivating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway.', 'FDA-Approved Kinase Inhibitors in Preclinical and Clinical Trials for Neurological Disorders.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Clinical Aspects and Targeted Therapies.', 'E-Cadherin Signaling in Salivary Gland Development and Autoimmunity.']"""

Recently, it has become evident that P-cadherin contributes to the oncogenesis of many tumor types, including melanoma, prostate, breast, and colon carcinomas. Although cadherin switching is a crucial step in metastasis, the role of P-cadherin in colon cancer metastasis to the liver is unknown. In this study, we performed gene expression analysis and found that the level of P-cadherin was higher in tissue from liver metastases of colon cancer than in the corresponding primary colon cancer tissues. IHC analysis also showed that P-cadherin expression was significantly higher in liver metastases than in paired primary colorectal cancer tumors. Knockdown of P-cadherin in colon cancer cells inhibited wound healing, proliferation, and colony formation and resulted in developing fewer liver metastatic foci and reducing the tumor burden in vivo. Inhibition of P-cadherin expression also induced the up-regulation of E-cadherin and the down-regulation of β-catenin and its downstream target molecules, including survivin and c-Myc. In summary, these results uncover a novel function of P-cadherin in the regulation of colon cancer metastasis to the liver, suggesting that blocking the activity of P-cadherin or its associated signaling may be a valuable target for the treatment of hepatic metastases of colon carcinomas.""","""['Lichao Sun', 'Hai Hu', 'Liang Peng', 'Zhuan Zhou', 'Xuan Zhao', 'Jian Pan', 'Lixin Sun', 'Zhihua Yang', 'Yuliang Ran']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['c-Kit is suppressed in human colon cancer tissue and contributes to L1-mediated metastasis.', 'E-cadherin and beta-catenin mRNA levels throughout colon cancer progression.', 'Investigation of N-cadherin/β-catenin expression in adrenocortical tumors.', 'High expression and prognostic role of CAP1 and CtBP2 in breast carcinoma: associated with E-cadherin and cell proliferation.', 'Inhibition of PRRX2 suppressed colon cancer liver metastasis via inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Association of β-Catenin, APC, SMAD3/4, Tp53, and Cyclin D1 Genes in Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'P-Cadherin Regulates Intestinal Epithelial Cell Migration and Mucosal Repair, but Is Dispensable for Colitis Associated Colon Cancer.', 'ECM-Receptor Regulatory Network and Its Prognostic Role in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Cadherin-3 is a novel oncogenic biomarker with prognostic value in glioblastoma.', 'Regulation of cadherin dimerization by chemical fragments as a trigger to inhibit cell adhesion.']"""

Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), partly through their effects on calcium levels are implicated in the proliferation and carcinogenesis in the prostate gland. VDR, ER-α and CaSR genes show polymorphisms in humans that appear to have clinical significance in many pathological conditions, such as prostate cancer. Our aim was to evaluate the role of ER-α (PvuII, XbaI), VDR (BsmI) and CaSR (A986S) gene polymorphisms and serum calcium levels in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   Two hundred four patients with prostate cancer and 102 healthy controls were recruited into a hospital-based case control study. After genotyping, the relationship between the individual genotypes and prostate cancer was investigated.  Results:   Both the ER-α XbaI and the VDR BsmI polymorphisms were significantly related to the risk of prostate cancer. An age adjusted logistic regression limited to controls and patients not receiving bisphosphonate therapy showed that higher corrected serum calcium and the VDR Bb/BB genotypes independently increased the risk of prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   ER-α XbaI and VDR BsmI genetic polymorphisms had a significant association with the risk of prostate cancer.
