Each of these strategies is associated with different rates of local control, distant metastasis (DM), and toxicity. By using decision analysis, the authors of this report compared the quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) between men with high-risk PCA who received RT + H versus S + RT versus a hypothetical trimodality therapy (S + RT + H).  Methods:   The authors developed a Markov model to describe lifetime health states after treatment for high-risk PCA. Probabilities and utilities were extrapolated from the literature. Toxicities after radiotherapy were based on intensity-modulated radiotherapy series, and patients were exposed to risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and fracture for 5 years after completing H. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to model uncertainty in outcome rates, toxicities, and utilities.  Results:   RT + H resulted in a higher QALE compared with S + RT over a wide range of assumptions, nearly always resulting in an increase of >1 quality-adjusted life year with outcomes highly sensitive to the risk of increased all-cause mortality from H. S + RT + H typically was superior to RT + H, albeit by small margins (<0.5 quality-adjusted life year), with results sensitive to assumptions about toxicity and radiotherapy efficacy.  Conclusions:   For men with high-risk PCA, RT + H was superior to S + RT, and the result was sensitive to the risk of all-cause mortality from H. Moreover, trimodality therapy may offer local and distant control benefits that lead to optimal outcomes in a meaningful population of men.""","""['Ravi Parikh', 'David J Sher']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['What is the best way to treat high-risk prostate cancer?', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Death from high-risk prostate cancer versus cardiovascular mortality with hormonal therapy: a decision analysis.', 'Do older men benefit from curative therapy of localized prostate cancer?', 'External beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Postprostatectomy adjuvant versus salvage radiotherapy: a complication-adjusted number-needed-to-treat analysis.', 'Treatment paths for localised prostate cancer in Italy: The results of a multidisciplinary, observational, prospective study (Pros-IT CNR).', 'The role of radical prostatectomy in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate cancer: long-term follow-up.']"""

This study explored the appropriateness of (1) PCA3 testing; (2) biopsy; (3) active surveillance (AS) and the value of the PCA3 Score for biopsy and AS decisions.  Methods:   Using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method, 12 urologists assessed the appropriateness of PCA3, biopsy and AS for theoretical patient profiles, constructed by combining clinical variables. They individually scored the appropriateness for all profiles using a 9-point scale. Based on the median score and extent of agreement, the appropriateness for each profile was calculated.  Results:   The PCA3 Assay was mainly considered appropriate in men with ≥1 negative biopsy, PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL and life expectancy (LE) ≥10 years. A LE < 10 years, ≥2 negative biopsies and PCA3 Score <20 decreased biopsy appropriateness, while PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL and PCA3 Score >50 increased it. In men without a prior biopsy, LE ≥ 10 years and a suspicious DRE, PCA3 did not affect biopsy appropriateness. In other men, a PCA3 Score <20 discouraged biopsy, while a value ≥35 supported biopsy. AS was mainly considered appropriate if LE < 10 years, T1c PCa, ≤20% positive cores and PSA < 3 ng/mL. A PCA3 Score <20 pleads for and higher scores (particularly >50) against AS.

Only a few studies have evaluated complication rates after open retropubic radical prostatectomy using these criteria. In this study we report on complications of open retropubic radical prostatectomy using the standardized Clavien-Dindo reporting methodology.  Patients and methods:   The overall complication rate was 28.6% (907 of 3,172). We registered 1,069 medical or surgical complications in 907 patients. Of these, 714 complications were grade I (66.8%), 195 grade II (18.2%), 139 grade III (13%), and 17 grade IV (1.6%), respectively. The mortality rate (grade V) was 0.1% (4 of 3,172). Older age (hazard ratio 1.049, p=0.023) and a performed lymphadenectomy (hazard ratio 1.804, p=0.024) were independent predictors for high-grade complications (grade III or greater) on multivariate analysis.  Results:   Between 08/2003 and 06/2010 complications of 3172 consecutive men who underwent open retropubic radical prostatectomy at a single center were recorded prospectively. Complications which occurred within a period of 30 days postoperatively were graded retrospectively according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Clinical and histopathological risk factors were statistically evaluated for an association with complication grades. All 10 Martin criteria were fulfilled.  Conclusions:   Using the Clavien-Dindo classification as a standardized reporting methodology, we observed an acceptable overall complication rate of 28.6%. In the majority (85% of all complications) lower grade complications occurred. In this series older age and a lymphadenectomy were risk factors for high-grade complications (III-V).

The identification of these factors has led to novel approaches to the care of the high-risk cancer patient, specifically in the adoption of clinical interventions that convey similar benefits as favorable sociodemographic characteristics. This study examined the importance of marital status and race as prognostic indicators in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   This report is a meta-analysis of 3,570 patients with prostate cancer treated in three prospective RTOG clinical trials. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival rate and the cumulative incidence method was used to analyze biochemical failure rate. Hazard ratios were calculated for all covariates using either the Cox or Fine and Gray's proportional hazards model or logistic regression model with associated 95% confidence intervals and p values.  Results:   Hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) for single status compared to married status was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.53). OS HR for non-White compared to White patients was 1.05 (CI 0.92 to 1.21). In contrast, the disease-free survival (DFS) HR and biochemical failure (BF) HR were both not significantly different neither between single and married patients nor between White patients and non-White patients. Median time to death for married men was 5.68 years and for single men was 4.73 years. Median time for DFS for married men was 7.25 years and for single men was 6.56 years. Median time for BF for married men was 7.81 years and for single men was 7.05 years.  Conclusions:   Race was not associated with statistically significant differences in this analysis. Congruent with our previous work in other cancer sites, marital status predicted improved prostate cancer outcomes including overall survival.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Prostate cancer is the most common visceral cancer in men in the USA. The stratification of prostate cancer risk is currently modeled solely on pathologic prognostic factors including PSA and Gleason Score. Independent of these pathologic prognostic factors, our paper describes the central sociodemographic factor of being single as a negative prognostic indicator. Single men are at high risk of poorer outcomes after prostate cancer treatment. Intriguingly, in our group of patients, race was not a significant prognostic factor. The findings in this paper add to the body of work that describes important sociodemographic prognostic factors that are currently underappreciated in patients with cancer. Future steps will include the validation of these findings in prospective studies, and the incorporation of clinical strategies that identify and compensate for sociodemographic factors that predict for poorer cancer outcomes.""","""['Kevin Lee Du', 'Kyounghwa Bae', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Yan Yan', 'Charlene Bryan', 'Deborah Watkins Bruner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Race and survival of men treated for prostate cancer on radiation therapy oncology group phase III randomized trials.', 'Older age predicts decreased metastasis and prostate cancer-specific death for men treated with radiation therapy: meta-analysis of radiation therapy oncology group trials.', 'Impact of ultrahigh baseline PSA levels on biochemical and clinical outcomes in two Radiation Therapy Oncology Group prostate clinical trials.', 'Effect of Standard vs Dose-Escalated Radiation Therapy for Patients With Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: The NRG Oncology RTOG 0126 Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Local Failure Events in Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiotherapy: A Pooled Analysis of 18 Randomized Trials from the Meta-analysis of Randomized Trials in Cancer of the Prostate Consortium (LEVIATHAN).', 'Marital status and perceived stress in men with advanced prostate cancer: A randomized-controlled trial of cognitive behavioral stress management.', 'Neighborhood Deprivation and Rurality Associated With Patient-Reported Outcomes and Survival in Men With Prostate Cancer in NRG Oncology RTOG 0415.', 'Impact of Primary Tumor Resection on Survival of Patients with Metastatic Gallbladder Carcinoma: A Population-Based, Propensity‑Matched Study.', 'Sociodemographic and Geographic Disparities of Prostate Cancer Treatment Delay in Tennessee: A Population-Based Study.', 'Living alone as a risk factor for cancer incidence, case-fatality and all-cause mortality: A nationwide registry study.']"""

PC is the most common cancer in men in Europe and the Americas. Tumor growth and metastasis depend upon the development of neovasculature around the tumor. This process, called angiogenesis, may be regulated by NO, and thus modulation of NO production could play an important role in tumor progression. Recent studies report the involvement of DDAH, an enzyme which metabolizes the endogenous NOS inhibitor ADMA, in the development of tumor vasculature. The aim of the present study was to verify the involvement of the DDAH/NOS pathway in the progression of prostate cancer. The effect of the NOS inhibitor L-NAME was evaluated in the human prostate cancer cell line LnCap and in BPH-1 cells which represent benign prostatic hypertrophy. Higher DDAH-2, eNOS, iNOS and VEGF expression was found in LnCap cells compared to BPH-1 cells. L-NAME treatment of LnCap cells resulted in a reduction in VEGF, iNOS and eNOS expression. VEGF, iNOS and eNOS inhibition is a promising approach for targeting tumor vasculature and certain NOS inhibitors could potentially serve as experimental agents for treatment of certain chemoresistant tumors, including prostate tumors. Moreover, since in our experimental conditions L-NAME was unable to reduce DDAH activity and expression, it is plausible to hypothesize the development of a targeted polypharmacological approach by developing dual and specific inhibitors of DDAH and NOS to better control NO biosynthesis.""","""['Luca Vanella', 'Claudia Di Giacomo', 'Rosaria Acquaviva', 'Rosa Santangelo', 'Venera Cardile', 'Ignazio Barbagallo', 'Nader G Abraham', 'Valeria Sorrenti']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Endogenous production of nitric oxide by vascular endothelial growth factor down-regulates proliferation of choriocarcinoma cells.', 'Effect of cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors on tumor growth in mouse tumor models with and without cancer cachexia related to prostanoids.', 'S-nitrosylation of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase regulates enzyme activity: further interactions between nitric oxide synthase and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase.', 'Antioxidants inhibit human endothelial cell functions through down-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity.', 'Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) is frequently upregulated in prostate cancer, and its overexpression conveys tumor growth and angiogenesis by metabolizing asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA).', 'Evaluation of the Antioxidant and Antiangiogenic Activity of a Pomegranate Extract in BPH-1 Prostate Epithelial Cells.', 'A multicentric consortium study demonstrates that dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2 is not a dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase.', 'ESTAT3 Inhibitor AG-490 Inhibits the Growth of Prostate Cancer by miR-503-5p Both In Vivo and In Vitro.', 'L-Arginine/Nitric Oxide Pathway Is Altered in Colorectal Cancer and Can Be Modulated by Novel Derivatives from Oxicam Class of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs.', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Is Accompanied by Local and Systemic Changes in L-arginine/NO Pathway.']"""

Among several mechanisms leading to CRPC growth a dysregulation of androgen receptor (AR) co-regulators (i.e. up-regulation of co-activators or down-regulation of co-repressors) is discussed. There are numerous reports demonstrating an increased expression of co-activators during prostate cancer progression. On the contrary, the impact of co-repressors on tumor growth and development is less clear. In this study we compared the effects of two known co-repressors, NCoR and SMRT, on AR transcriptional activity in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and compared them to that in COS-1 cells. Interestingly, we found that NCoR/SMRT overexpression did not repress AR-dependent gene expression in the PCa cell lines, but rather activated it. This finding is probably due to an impaired AR-co-repressor interaction in the prostate cancer cell lines. In conclusion, we provide evidence that up-regulation of NCoR or SMRT may increase transcriptional activity of the AR in a cell type-specific context.""","""['Martin Laschak', 'Marina Bechtel', 'Klaus-Dieter Spindler', 'Andrea Hessenauer']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Formation of AR-SMRT binding in prostate cancer cells treated with natural histone deacetylase inhibitor.', 'Altered corepressor SMRT expression and recruitment to target genes as a mechanism that change the response to androgens in prostate cancer progression.', 'Inhibition of MAPK-signaling pathway promotes the interaction of the corepressor SMRT with the human androgen receptor and mediates repression of prostate cancer cell growth in the presence of antiandrogens.', 'Key targets of hormonal treatment of prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Clinical, pathologic, and follow-up data of 404 consecutive patients who were treated with radical prostatectomy alone and were diagnosed as pT2 prostate cancer in our institution were reviewed. Percent tumor volume (PTV) was estimated from the cancer distribution map, and the surgical margin status was reviewed by a single pathologist (JYR). Clinicopathologic variables were analyzed with respect to the risk of BCR.  Results and limitations:   Recurrence was observed in 39 (9.7%) patients at a mean of 28.9 (5-47) months. Preoperative PSA, biopsy Gleason score, surgical Gleason score, PTV, and surgical margin status were significantly related to BCR in univariate analysis; in multivariate analysis, PTV (P < 0.001) and surgical Gleason score (P = 0.021) were independent predictors of BCR. PTV was also an independent determinant of positive surgical margin (P = 0.035, HR 1.026, 95% CI 1.002-1.050). By combining the 2 predictors 5-year recurrence-free survivals for PTV ≤ 14.5% and surgical Gleason score ≤ 7, PTV >14.5% or surgical Gleason score > 7, and PTV > 14.5% and surgical Gleason score > 7 were 97.5%, 88.7%, and 44.5%, respectively (log-rank test, P < 0.01). Retrospective study nature, use of PTV instead of actual volume, and intermediate follow-up length are the main limitations of the study.  Conclusions:   In men with pT2 prostate cancer, percent tumor volume and the surgical Gleason score were independently prognostic of BCR and by combining the 2 factors, risk of BCR could be significantly stratified.

The core question was whether the surgical approach had an effect on the patients' continence status 3 months after surgery.  Methods:   We conducted a multicentric, longitudinal study in 7 German hospitals. Three hundred fifty prostate cancer patients (166 EERPE, 184 RRPE) were asked to self-assess symptoms associated with urinary incontinence (UI) 1 day before and 3 months after prostatectomy. Symptoms of UI were assessed using the EORTC QLQ-PR25 questionnaire. Urinary continence was defined according to (1) the use of no protective pad, (2) the use of up to a single protective pad in a 24-hour period, and (3) according to the patient's self-assessment. A binary regression model was employed to predict early continence status.  Results:   Three months after prostatectomy, 44% of patients who underwent EERPE and 40% of patients who underwent RRPE were completely continent. Patients who underwent nerve-sparing prostatectomy and patients younger than 65 years had a better chance of regaining urinary continence earlier. The surgical approach had no significant impact on the patients' continence status. Limitations of the study are a drop-out rate of 39% and sociodemographic and clinical differences between both treatment groups.  Conclusions:   Three months after prostatectomy, there were no significant differences between both treatment groups regarding urinary continence. The surgical approach had no significant effect on the patients' continence status.

However, only few series have yet reported combined results after radical prostatectomy. To determine the proportion of men who are continent, potent, and cancer-free (trifecta rate) 2 years after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP).  Materials and methods:   We included patients who underwent a RALRP at our department and who were followed during at least 2 years. Men who were impotent or incontinent before the surgery were excluded from the analysis. Overall, 500 men were included. All patients prospectively completed validated questionnaires (IIEF-5, ICS) before the medical visit and concerning their voiding and sexual disorders, preoperatively, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after RALRP. Biochemical recurrence was defined as any detectable serum PSA (≥ 0.2 ng/ml). The study end point was the trifecta rate (cancer control, continence, and potency) at 2 years of the surgery. Predictive factors of the trifecta outcome were assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses.  Results:   Median age and PSA level were 62.2 years and 9.7 ng/mL. A trifecta outcome was achieved in 44% and 53% of men at 12 and 24 months, respectively. The 2-year trifecta rate reached 62% in men undergoing bilateral nerve-sparing surgery and 71% in men < 60 years. Age < 60 years, PSA level < 10 ng/ml, organ-confined disease, and bilateral nerve-sparing procedure were significantly associated with the 2-year trifecta outcome.

Major contributors to these adverse effects are the transcriptional program activated by the HIF family of transcription factors as well as the translational response mediated by PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α and inhibition of mTORC1 activity. In this study we determined the relative contribution of both transcriptional and translational responses to changes in hypoxia induced gene expression.  Material and methods:   Total and efficiently translated (polysomal) mRNA was isolated from DU145 prostate carcinoma cells that were exposed for up to 24 h of hypoxia (<0.02% O(2)). Changes in transcription and translation were assessed using affymetrix microarray technology.  Results:   Our data reveal an unexpectedly large contribution of translation control on both induced and repressed gene expression at all hypoxic time points, particularly during acute hypoxia (2-4 h). Gene ontology analysis revealed that gene classes like transcription and signal transduction are stimulated by translational control whereas expression of genes involved in cell growth and protein metabolism are repressed during hypoxic conditions by translational control.

Most RUFs are secondary to lower urinary or intestinal tract surgery. Spontaneous closure is infrequent, and operative treatment is often mandatory. Several surgical approaches have been proposed.  Methods:   We reviewed retrospectively the medical records of 14 patients presenting with RUF in our Department between 1988 and 2010. In 10 patients, RUFs developed after radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP); in the other 4 patients, RUFs resulted after other surgical interventions. All patients were treated with the York-Mason approach. A temporary colostomy and suprapubic cystostomy were performed in all patients except one.  Results:   All patients were treated successfully. After fistulectomy, colostomies were closed after 4 mo, and patients reported fecal continence and no postoperative anal strictures. The colostomy was left in place permanently in 1 patient due to the simultaneous presence of Crohn's disease, in another with ulcerative rectocolitis, and in a third scheduled for adjuvant radiotherapy for relapse after RRP. In 1 patient, daily medications were essential because of wound infection. In the patient with Crohn's disease, the fistula recurred 11 years after first repair. Two patients died of metastatic prostate cancer 1 year after repair of the RUF.

Here, we describe the synthesis, characterization and evaluation of N(1)-(4-(2-[(18)F]-fluoroethyl)phenyl)-N(8)-hydroxyoctanediamide ([(18)F]-FESAHA), a PET tracer designed for the delineation of HDAC expression in cancer.  Methods:   FESAHA was synthesized and biologically characterized in vivo and in vitro. [(18)F]-FESAHA was then synthesized in high radiochemical purity, and the logP and serum stability of the radiotracer were determined. In vitro cellular uptake experiments and acute biodistribution and small-animal PET studies were performed with [(18)F]-FESAHA in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts.  Results:   [(18)F]-FESAHA was synthesized in high radiochemical purity via an innovative one-pot procedure. Enzymatic inhibition assays illustrated that FESAHA is a potent HDAC inhibitor, with IC(50) values from 3 nM to 1.7 μM against the 11 HDAC subtypes. Cell proliferation experiments revealed that the cytostatic properties of FESAHA very closely resemble those of SAHA in both LNCaP cells and PC-3 cells. Acute biodistribution and PET imaging experiments revealed tumor uptake of [(18)F]-FESAHA and substantially higher values in the small intestine, kidneys, liver and bone.  Conclusion:   The significant non-tumor background uptake of [(18)F]-FESAHA presents a substantial obstacle to the use of the radiotracer as an HDAC expression imaging agent.

We hypothesized that this change is rapidly shifting procedures away from hospitals that do not offer robotics and consequently increasing patient travel.  Methods:   A population-based observational study of all prostatectomies for cancer in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania from 2000 to 2009 was performed using hospital discharge data. Hospital procedure volume was defined as the number of prostatectomies performed for cancer in a given year. Straight-line travel distance to the treating hospital was calculated for each case. Hospitals were contacted to determine the year of acquisition of the first robot.  Results:   From 2000 to 2009, the total number of prostatectomies performed annually increased substantially. The increase occurred almost entirely at the very high-volume centers (≥ 106 prostatectomies/year). The number of hospitals performing prostatectomy fell 37% from 2000 to 2009. By 2009, the 9% (21/244) of hospitals that had very high volume performed 57% of all prostatectomies, and the 35% (86/244) of hospitals with a robot performed 85% of all prostatectomies. The median travel distance increased 54% from 2000 to 2009 (P<.001). The proportion of patients traveling ≥ 15 miles increased from 24% to 40% (P < .001).  Conclusions:   Over the past decade, the number of radical prostatectomies performed has risen substantially.

Because the newer technology is more costly, reasons for this rapid adoption are unclear. The authors of this report sought to determine whether hospital acquisition of robotic technology was associated with volume of prostate cancer surgery.  Methods:   The inpatient dataset of claims records from 2002 to 2008 and the acquisition dates of robotic technology were used to examine the rates of prostatectomy in Wisconsin hospitals. In analyses that accounted for hospital and referral region characteristics, changes in hospital prostatectomy volume were examined for their association with technology acquisition. Overall trends in the rate of prostatectomy also were examined over the study period.  Results:   In total, 10,021 prostatectomies were performed in 52 hospitals in Wisconsin's 8 health referral regions during the study period.

In contrast, the mean quarterly prostatectomy volume in hospitals that went on to acquire robotic technology was 16.5 in 2002 and 24.8 in 2007/2008. In adjusted models, the acquisition of a robot was associated with a 114% annual increase (95% confidence interval, 62%-177% annual increase) in hospital prostatectomy volume. The average Wisconsin hospital prostatectomy volume was unchanged during 2002 through 2006 but increased by 25.6% in 2007.  Conclusions:   Robotic technology acquisition occurred rapidly in Wisconsin hospitals, and hospitals that acquired a robot had large increases in prostatectomy volume.""","""['Joan M Neuner', 'William A See', 'Liliana E Pezzin', 'Sergey Tarima', 'Ann B Nattinger']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""[]"""

In a previous report, the authors observed that proteomic biomarkers and cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) exhibited a sensitivity of 84% at a specificity of 98% for identifying sera from patients who had stage I disease at the time of surgery, significantly improving the sensitivity of CA 125 alone. The challenge, however, is to detect ovarian cancer before clinical diagnosis. The current study was part of a large effort to compare different multimarker biomarker panels for the early detection of ovarian cancer. Several biomarkers were evaluated alone and in combination with CA 125 in prediagnostically collected sera from women in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.  Methods:   Proximal prediagnostic sera from 118 women with ovarian cancer (cases) and from 951 age-matched women (controls) (8 controls per case, including 4 randomly selected from the general population, 2 with CA 125 levels ≥ 35 U/mL, and 2 with a positive family history of breast/ovarian cancer) were analyzed using the CA 125 immunoassay and surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to measure 7 proteins (apolipoprotein A1, truncated transthyretin, transferrin, hepcidin, β-2 microglobulin, connective tissue activating protein III), and interalpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy-chain 4). Data were analyzed by 2 statistical strategies that combined the 7 markers and CA 125 into 1 predictive score for disease classification.  Results:   CA 125 levels were elevated (≥ 35 U/mL) in 61.5% of 65 patients who had CA 125 data available from samples that were collected <12 months before cancer diagnosis; however, levels of the additional 7 biomarkers were not different between cases and the 3 control groups individually or combined. Two panels that combined CA 125 and the 7 biomarkers failed to improve the sensitivity of CA 125 alone.

It is unknown whether this scenario impacts the prognosis of subsequent radical prostatectomy. We compared radical prostatectomy findings in 45 men with an initial diagnosis of HGPIN who subsequently were diagnosed with cancer with 18,494 men diagnosed with cancer who lacked an earlier diagnosis of HGPIN. All cases were retrieved from our institution between 1993 and 2008. The mean patient age was 60.2 years, and the mean serum prostate-specific antigen value was 9.0 ng/mL. For the 45 men with an initial HGPIN diagnosis, 21 of 45 (46.7%) men were found to have cancer within 6 months and 29 of 45 (64.4%) within 1 year after the diagnosis of HGPIN. Cancer involved a single core in 32 of 45 (71.1%) cases, and the maximum tumor volume was ≤5% in 57.8% of the 45 cases. Men with initial HGPIN had 84.4% organ-confined cancer, whereas cases without HGPIN had 65.4% organ-confined cancer (P=0.007) at radical prostatectomy. For the RPs performed in men with an earlier diagnosis of HGPIN followed by cancer on biopsy, the mean and median tumor volumes were 0.3 cm³ and 0.12 cm³ (0.003 cm³ to 1.46 cm³). Favorable pathologic stage was maintained even when we restricted the analysis to men with only Gleason score 6 cancer on biopsy. In men with Gleason score 6 cancer on biopsy, men with an initial diagnosis of HGPIN had 88.9% organ confined versus 73.2% for men with no earlier biopsy diagnosis of HGPIN, (P=0.03). At radical prostatectomy, although men with an earlier HGPIN diagnosis had less adverse findings in terms of Gleason score, surgical margin involvement, seminal vesicle involvement, and lymph node metastasis, the differences did not reach statistical significance. This was possibly due to the relatively small number of positive events in the men with no earlier HGPIN and due to the relatively small number of cases with earlier HGPIN. Prostatic adenocarcinomas discovered after an initial HGPIN diagnosis on biopsy are more likely to be organ confined, yet of similar grade, compared with cases diagnosed as cancer on the first biopsy. These findings likely reflect cancers associated with HGPIN, in which the cancers were missed on the initial biopsy as a result of smaller size.""","""['Turki O Al-Hussain', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Prostate cancer after initial high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and benign prostate biopsy.', 'Multiple cores of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and any core of atypia on first biopsy are significant predictor for cancer detection at a repeat biopsy.', 'Followup interval prostate biopsy 3 years after diagnosis of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is associated with high likelihood of prostate cancer, independent of change in prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'In situ and intraductal epithelial proliferations of prostate: definitions and treatment implications.

We compensate the translational motions of a C-arm, such as oscillation, sagging and wheel motion using a three-level optimization algorithm and obviate the need for full pose tracking using external trackers or fiducials.

Design, setting, and participants:   An exploratory analysis compared outcomes of 332 men who received DP in the TAX-327 trial, which stipulated up to 10 cycles, and 220 men who received DP in CS-205, a randomized phase 2 trial comparing DP plus AT-101 (bcl-2 inhibitor) versus DP plus placebo, which allowed up to 17 cycles.  Measurements:   Patients who completed 10 cycles of DP without progression in both trials were included. Men in both arms of CS-205 were combined for analysis, as no significant differences in outcomes were observed. OS was estimated from the date of cycle 10 docetaxel infusion.  Results and limitations:   The number of men receiving 10 cycles was similar (p=0.26) in the two trials (166 [50.0%] in TAX-327 vs 99 [45.0%] in CS-205; the latter group received a median of five additional cycles).

Periostin expression in different PCa cell lines was determined by immunofluorescence staining, western blotting and reverse transcription PCR(RT-PCR). The LNCap cells with Periostin expression were used for transfecting shRNA-Periostin lentiviral particles. The efficancy of transfecting shRNA lentiviral particles was evaluated by immunofluorescence, western blotting and Real-time PCR. The effect of silencing Periostin expression by RNAi on proliferation of LNCap cells was determined by MTT assay and tumor xenografts. The tissue slices from theses xenografts were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin(HE) staining. The expression of Periostin in the xenografts was deteminned by Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. The migration of LNCap cells after silencing Periostin gene expression were analyzed in vitro.  Results:   Periostin as the protein of interest was shown 9.12 fold up-regulation in PCa compared with BPH. The overexpression of Periostin in the stroma of PCa was confirmed by western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Periostin was only expressed in PCa LNCap cell line. Our results indicated that the transfection ratio was more than 90%. As was expected, both the protein level and mRNA level of Periostin in the stably expressing shRNA-Periostin LNCap cells were significantly reduced. The stably expressing shRNA-Periostin LNCap cells growed slowly in vitro and in vivo. The tissues of xenografts as PCa were verificated by HE staining.

Ad.mda-7 decreased expression of soluble CLU (sCLU) and increased expression of nuclear CLU (nCLU). In the initial phase of Ad.mda-7 infection sCLU expression increased and CLU interacted with MDA-7/IL-24 producing a cytoprotective effect. Infection of stable clones of DU-145 prostate cancer cells expressing sCLU with Ad.mda-7 resulted in generation of nCLU that correlated with decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. In the presence of mda-7/IL-24, sCLU-DU-145 cells displayed G(2)/M phase arrest followed by apoptosis. Similarly, Ad.mda-7 infection decreased cell migration by altering cytoskeleton in sCLU-DU-145 cells. Ad.mda-7-treated sCLU-DU-145 cells displayed a significant reduction in tumor growth in mouse xenograft models and reduced angiogenesis when compared to the vector control group.

Methods:   Uptake experiments were performed in androgen-sensitive (LNCaP, PC346C) and independent cell lines (22Rv1, PC346DCC, PC-3) as well as in a benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-1) cell line. Tracer uptake was assessed under androgen ablation. Results of the cancer cell lines were normalized to those of BPH-1. To evaluate the effect of androgen on the uptake of 18F-FDG, 11C-choline and 11C-acetate in PCa cell lines, 10(-8) M R1881, 10(-10) M R1881, the combination of 10(-10) M R1881 plus 10(-6) M Casodex or 10(-6) M Casodex alone were added in parallel cell cultures 1 day before uptake experiments. Uptake in androgen-supplemented cell cultures was compared to the uptake under androgen deprivation. Uptake was corrected for cell number using protein content.  Results:   Compared to BPH-1, a higher 18F-FDG uptake was observed only in PC346C cells, whereas a higher 11C-choline and markedly increased 11C-acetate uptake was seen in all cancer cell lines. Androgens significantly modulated the uptake of 18F-FDG in LNCaP, PC346C and 22Rv1 cells, and of 11C-choline in the PC346C and 22Rv1 cell line. No androgenic effect on 11C-choline and 18F-FDG uptake was observed in PC-3 and PC346DCC cells. 11C-Acetate uptake was independent of androgen status in all PCa cell lines studied.  Conclusion:   18F-FDG uptake in PCa cell lines showed the highest variability and strongest androgen effect, suggesting its poor potential for metabolic imaging of advanced PCa.

In addition, BA significantly reduced cellular and secreted levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a critical angiogenic factor and a target gene of STAT3 induced under hypoxia. Furthermore, BA prevented in vitro capillary tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) maintained in conditioned medium of hypoxic PC-3 cells, implying anti-angiogenic activity of BA under hypoxic condition. Of note, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) assay revealed that BA inhibited binding of HIF-1α and STAT3 to VEGF promoter.

However, it is still unclear which factors are involved in this downregulation. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is the most common known gene rearrangement in prostate carcinoma. Androgen stimulation can increase expression of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in fusion positive prostate cancer cells. The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether PSMA expression can be regulated by the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. We employed two PSMA positive cell lines: VCaP cells, which harbor TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, and LNCaP cells, which lack the fusion. After 24 hours of androgen treatment, TMPRSS2-ERG mRNA level was increased in VCaP cells. PSMA mRNA level was dramatically decreased in VCaP cells, while it only has moderate change in LNCaP cells. Treatment with the androgen antagonist flutamide partially restored PSMA expression in androgen-treated VCaP cells. Knocking down ERG by siRNA in VCaP cells enhances PSMA expression both in the presence and absence of synthetic androgen R1881. Overexpressing TMPRSS2-ERG fusions in LNCaP cells downregulated PSMA both in the presence or absence of R1881, while overexpressing wild type ERG did not.

The exact definition of surgical resection planes is pivotal to achieving negative circumferential resection margins.  Objective:   This study aims to describe the surrounding anatomical structures that are at risk for inadvertent damage during extralevator abdominoperineal excision.  Design and setting:   Joint surgical and macroanatomical dissection was performed in a university laboratory of clinical anatomy.  Methods:   A stepwise dissection study was conducted according to the technique of extralevator abdominoperineal excision by abdominal and perineal approaches in 4 human cadaveric pelvises. Muscular, fascial, tendinous, and neural structures were carefully exposed and related to the corresponding surgical resection planes.  Results:   In addition to the autonomic nerves to be identified and preserved during total mesorectal excision, further structures endangered during extralevator abdominoperineal excision can be clearly identified. Terminal pudendal nerve branches come close to the surgical resection plane at the outer surface of the puborectal sling. Likewise, the pelvic plexus and its neurovascular bundles embedded within the parietal pelvic fascia extend close to the apex of the prostate where the parietal pelvic fascia has to be divided. These neural structures converge in the region of the perineal body, an area that provides no ""self-opening"" planes for surgical dissection. Thus, the necessity to sharply detach the anorectal specimen anteriorly from the perineal body and the superficial transverse perineal muscle bears the risk of both inadvertent damage of the aforementioned anatomical structures and perforation of the specimen.  Limitations:   The study focused primarily on the macroscopic topography relevant to the surgical procedure, so that previously published histologic examinations were not performed.

URI is phosphorylated upon androgen treatment, suggesting communication between the URI and AR signaling pathways. Whereas depletion of URI enhances AR-mediated gene transcription, overexpression of URI suppresses AR transcriptional activation and anchorage-independent prostate cancer cell growth. Repression of AR-mediated transcription is achieved, in part, by URI binding and regulation of androgen receptor trapped clone 27 (Art-27), a previously characterized AR corepressor. Consistent with this idea, genome-wide expression profiling in prostate cancer cells upon depletion of URI or Art-27 reveals substantially overlapping patterns of gene expression. Further, depletion of URI increases the expression of the AR target gene NKX-3.1, decreases the recruitment of Art-27, and increases AR occupancy at the NKX-3.1 promoter. While Art-27 can bind AR directly, URI is bound to chromatin prior to hormone-dependent recruitment of AR, suggesting a role for URI in modulating AR recruitment to target genes.""","""['Paolo Mita', 'Jeffrey N Savas', 'Nabil Djouder', 'John R Yates rd', 'Susan Ha', 'Rachel Ruoff', 'Eric D Schafler', 'Jerome C Nwachukwu', 'Naoko Tanese', 'Nicholas J Cowan', 'Jiri Zavadil', 'Michael J Garabedian', 'Susan K Logan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['Genome-wide impact of androgen receptor trapped clone-27 loss on androgen-regulated transcription in prostate cancer cells.', 'Prohibitin and the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit BRG1 are required for effective androgen antagonist-mediated transcriptional repression of androgen receptor-regulated genes.', 'A competitive inhibitor that reduces recruitment of androgen receptor to androgen-responsive genes.', 'Role of the Unconventional Prefoldin Proteins URI and UXT in Transcription Regulation.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Transcription in Prostate Cancer.', 'A comprehensive analysis of prefoldins and their implication in cancer.', 'The functions and mechanisms of prefoldin complex and prefoldin-subunits.', 'Prefoldin-like Bud27 influences the transcription of ribosomal components and ribosome biogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.', 'Reference gene selection and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform expression in muscle tissues of domestic yak (Bos grunniens).', 'Ubiquitous expressed transcript promotes tumorigenesis by acting as a positive modulator of the polycomb repressive complex 2 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.']"""

Here we show that the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) translation initiation factor by a variety of cellular stresses leads to the inhibition of NMD and that eIF2α phosphorylation and NMD inhibition occur in tumors. To explore the significance of this NMD regulation, we used an unbiased approach to identify approximately 750 NMD-targeted mRNAs and found that these mRNAs are overrepresented in stress response and tumor-promoting pathways. Consistent with these findings, the inhibition of NMD promotes cellular resistance to endoplasmic reticulum stress and encourages tumor formation.

For this study, we chose 45°-scan angle that contained ~80 projections for the full-fan and ~160 projections with 2 x 45°-scan angle for the half-fan mode, each with 1024 x 768 pixels with 32-bit precision. Absolute pixel value differences, profiles, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) calculations were performed to compare and evaluate the images reconstructed using GPU- and CPU-based implementations. The time dependence on the reconstruction volume was also tested with (512 x 512) x 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 slices. In the end, the GPU-based implementation achieved, at most, 1.3 and 2.5 seconds to complete full reconstruction of 512 x 512 x 256 volume, for the full-fan and half-fan modes, respectively. In turn, this meant that our implementation can process > 13 projections-per-second (pps) and > 18 pps for the full-fan and half-fan modes, respectively. Since commercial CBCT system nominally acquires 11 pps (with 1 gantry-revolution-per-minute), our GPU-based implementation is sufficient to handle the incoming projections data as they are acquired and reconstruct the entire volume immediately after completing the scan. In addition, on increasing the number of slices (hence volume) to be reconstructed from 16 to 256, only minimal increases in reconstruction time were observed for the GPU-based implementation where from 0.73 to 1.27 seconds and 1.42 to 2.47 seconds increase were observed for the full-fan and half-fan modes, respectively. This resulted in speed improvement of up to 87 times compared with the CPU-based implementation (for 256 slices case), with visually identical images and small pixel-value discrepancies (< 6.3%), and CNR differences (< 2.3%). With this achievement, we have shown that time allocation for DTS image reconstruction is virtually eliminated and that clinical implementation of this approach has become quite appealing. In addition, with the speed achievement, further image processing and real-time applications that was prohibited prior due to time restrictions can now be tempered with.""","""['Justin C Park', 'Sung Ho Park', 'Jin Sung Kim', 'Youngyih Han', 'Min Kook Cho', 'Ho Kyung Kim', 'Zhaowei Liu', 'Steve B Jiang', 'Bongyong Song', 'William Y Song']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Fast compressed sensing-based CBCT reconstruction using Barzilai-Borwein formulation for application to on-line IGRT.', 'Towards the clinical implementation of iterative low-dose cone-beam CT reconstruction in image-guided radiation therapy: cone/ring artifact correction and multiple GPU implementation.', 'Combining scatter reduction and correction to improve image quality in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).', 'A review of GPU-based medical image reconstruction.', 'GPU-based high-performance computing for radiation therapy.', 'Combining Acceleration Techniques for Low-Dose X-Ray Cone Beam Computed Tomography Image Reconstruction.', 'Clinical Study of Orthogonal-View Phase-Matched Digital Tomosynthesis for Lung Tumor Localization.', 'An efficient iterative CBCT reconstruction approach using gradient projection sparse reconstruction algorithm.', 'A software tool of digital tomosynthesis application for patient positioning in radiotherapy.', 'Four dimensional digital tomosynthesis using on-board imager for the verification of respiratory motion.']"""

Silica nanoparticles containing [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) and secondary antibodies (RuBPY-silica-Ab(2)) are employed in this system for highly sensitive two-analyte detection. Antibodies to prostate specific antigen (PSA) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were attached to the same RuBPY-silica-Ab(2) particle. The array was fabricated by forming the wells on a conductive pyrolytic graphite chip (1 in. × 1 in.) with a single connection to a potentiostat to achieve ECL. The sandwich immunoassay protocol employs antibodies attached to SWCNTs in the wells to capture analyte proteins. Then RuBPY-silica-Ab(2) is added to bind to the captured proteins. ECL is initiated in the microwells by electrochemical oxidation of tripropyl amine (TprA), which generates excited state [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) in the 100-nm particles, and is measured with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Separation of the analytical spots by the hydrophobic wall barriers enabled simultaneous immunoassays for two proteins in a single sample without cross-contamination. The detection limit (DL) for PSA was 1 pg mL(-1) and for IL-6 was 0.25 pg mL(-1) (IL-6) in serum. Array determinations of PSA and IL-6 in patient serum were well-correlated with single-protein ELISAs.

However, its lack of selectivity has lead to the search for new biomarkers. PSA glycosylation seems to depend on the pathophysiological conditions of the individual. Thus, methods to separate PSA isoforms (peaks) to study their role as PCa markers are needed. In this work, CE methods for PSA isoforms separation, based on the use of different dynamic coatings, are developed using UV detection. Three complementary CE methods allowing the separation of 8 or 9 PSA isoforms are selected. The longest method takes only 17 min, while the shortest one separates 9 isoforms in < 8 min. Depending on the isoforms of interest for their use as PCa biomarker, the CE method to be used can be chosen or various of them can be combined. A remarkable aspect of these methods is that the BGEs employed are devoid of compounds with primary amino groups, making the CE methods compatible with fluorescent on-column derivatization through amino residues. As a proof-of-concept, a preliminary result shows that LIF detection of labeled PSA analyzed by one of the three developed methods permits detection of glycoprotein isoforms.""","""['Raul Garrido-Medina', 'Jose Carlos Díez-Masa', 'Mercedes de Frutos']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Electrophoresis""","""['On-capillary fluorescent labeling and capillary electrophoresis laser-induced fluorescence analysis of glycoforms of intact prostate-specific antigen.', 'Immunoaffinity chromatographic isolation of prostate-specific antigen from seminal plasma for capillary electrophoresis analysis of its isoforms.', 'Capillary electrophoresis for the investigation of prostate-specific antigen heterogeneity.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'Beyond PSA: utility of novel tumor markers in the setting of elevated PSA.', 'Capillary Electrophoresis Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA).']"""

A survey among urologists of the region showed a high acceptance of prostate cancer centers in general. The majority of participating urologists appreciated the work of the Charité center, in particular the treatment recommendations given by the center were mostly followed and the majority of urologists regularly use educational activities of the center. However, only 30% of the participating urologists confirmed short-term improvements in the quality of patient care. Yearly additional costs for the Charité prostate cancer center are estimated at 205,000 euro (precertification phase and certification) and 138,000 euro (monitoring phase), despite the initial drop in mean treatment costs per case (radical prostatectomy).

Methods:   From 1998 to 2008, a low-risk cohort by National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria of 341 men with a median followup of 41.6 months was analyzed. This cohort had a median age of 65.1 years, prostate volume of 35.8cc, and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen of 5.6ng/mL. Patients had predominately Gleason 6 (95.9%) and T1c (81.3%) disease.

In this study, we found that valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI), counteracted the suppressive effect of GOS on histone H3 acetylation and enhanced the cytotoxicity of GOS to DU145 prostate cancer cells. Significant synergistic effects were observed in combined GOS and VPA treatment, culminating in more DNA damage and cell death. The iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis revealed differential proteomic profiles in cells treated with VPA, GOS or their combination. In GOS-treated cells, oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins were depressed and endoplasmic reticulum stress markers were upregulated. In the presence of VPA, the GOS-induced mitochondrial stress was further enhanced since glycolysis- and hypoxia-associated proteins were upregulated, suggesting a disruption of energy metabolism in these cells. Furthermore, the DNA damage repair ability of cells co-treated with GOS and VPA was also decreased, as evidenced by the downregulation of DNA damage repair proteins and the enhancement of DNA fragmentation and cell death.

Optimal quality of post-treatment care requires greater knowledge of survivors' adherence to behavioral health recommendations. This study reports the rates of smoking, physical activity, alcohol use, cancer screenings, and routine primary care visits in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survivors.  Methods:   Stage IA and IB NSCLC survivors (N = 183, mean age = 69.0 years) with no evidence of disease 1-6 years post-treatment completed standard survey items regarding health and cancer screening behaviors.  Results:   Most survivors (83.5%) had a history of smoking, but 64.8% quit prior to diagnosis and only 5.5% continued to smoke. Alcohol intake recommendations were exceeded by 5.4% and 17.3% of men and women, respectively. In a typical week, 23.1% met physical activity guidelines. Regarding cancer screenings, 89.3% were adherent to colorectal cancer screening guidelines. Among women, 72.0% had a mammogram within the previous year and 81.5% had a pap test in the previous 3 years; among men, 86.7% had a prostate-specific antigen test in the previous year. Almost all (97.3%) had seen a primary care provider in the past year.  Discussions/conclusions:   The majority of lung cancer survivors were adherent to health promotion recommendations, but few engaged in the recommended level of physical activity.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Physical and pulmonary rehabilitation interventions may help lung cancer survivors maintain sufficient levels of physical activity, which can have numerous benefits for older adults.""","""['Paul Krebs', 'Elliot J Coups', 'Marc B Feinstein', 'Jack E Burkhalter', 'Richard M Steingart', 'Amy Logue', 'Bernard J Park', 'Jamie S Ostroff']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['Health-related quality of life among early-stage, non-small cell, lung cancer survivors.', 'Physical activity among lung cancer survivors: changes across the cancer trajectory and associations with quality of life.', 'Cancer screening practices among racially and ethnically diverse breast cancer survivors: results from the 2001 and 2003 California health interview survey.', 'Health-related quality of life after surgical treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review.', 'Survivorship in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Challenges Faced and Steps Forward.', 'Physical activity in surgical lung cancer patients: a systematic review.', 'Racial disparities in follow-up care of early-stage lung cancer survivors.', 'Association of Leisure-Time Physical Activity With Health-Related Quality of Life Among US Lung Cancer Survivors.', 'Long-term assessment of efficacy with a novel Thoracic Survivorship Program for patients with lung cancer.', 'Health care access and utilization among adult cancer survivors: Results from the National Institutes of Health ""All of Us"" Research Program.']"""

Recent studies have demonstrated FH(PSA)1 expression in numerous benign and malignant tissue types, as well as the malignant neovasculature. As FH(PSA)1 represents a diagnostic immunomarker for prostate cancer, we explored its expression pattern in various subtypes of bladder cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) of FH(PSA)1 was performed using tissue microarrays constructed from 167 bladder cancers, including 96 urothelial carcinomas (UCCs), 37 squamous cell carcinomas, 17 adenocarcinomas and 17 small cell carcinomas. We used a FH(PSA)1 monoclonal antibody obtained from Dako (clone 3E6, dilution 1:100), which recognizes the epitope present in the 57-134 amino acid region of the extracellular portion of the PSMA molecule. Intensity of IHC staining was scored as 0 (no expression) to 3+ (strong expression), with 2-3+ IHC considered a positive result. FH(PSA)1 demonstrated expression in a subset of bladder cancers and was most common in small cell carcinoma (3/17; 18%), with concurrent expression in non-small cell components in a subset of cases (2/6). FH(PSA)1 expression was less frequent in UCC (3/96; 3%) and adenocarcinoma (2/17; 12%). None of the squamous cell carcinomas demonstrated tumor cell expression of FH(PSA)1. However, all bladder cancers examined expressed FH(PSA)1 in the tumor vasculature, suggesting a potential role for this molecule in mediating new vessel ingrowth. FH(PSA)1 may occasionally be expressed in various subtypes of bladder cancer. These findings suggest cautious use of FH(PSA)1 as a diagnostic marker for prostatic tissue invading the bladder.

To ascertain CYP24A1 promoter methylation in tumor-associated endothelium, we utilized laser microdissection guided by CD31 immunohistochemistry to procure endothelial cells from human prostate tumor specimens. Prostate tissues were obtained following robotic radical prostatectomy from men with clinically localized prostate cancer. Adjacent histologically benign prostate tissues were used to compare endothelium from benign versus tumor microenvironments. Sodium bisulfite sequencing of CYP24A1 promoter region showed that the average CYP24A1 promoter methylation in the endothelium was 20% from the tumor microenvironment compared with 8.2% in the benign microenvironment (p< 0.05). A 2-fold to 17-fold increase in CYP24A1 promoter methylation was observed in the prostate tumor endothelium compared with the matched benign prostate endothelium in four patient samples, while CYP24A1 remained unchanged in two patient sample. In addition, there is no correlation of the level of CYP24A1 promoter methylation in prostate tumor-associated endothelium with that of epithelium/stroma.

Clinical tissue samples and various prostate cancer cell lines revealed a positive correlation between Drp1 and AR levels. Treatment of androgen-sensitive cells with an AR agonist, R1881, and antagonist, bicalutamide, showed that Drp1 is transcriptionally regulated by androgens, as confirmed by an AR ChIP-seq assay. Live imaging experiments using pAcGFP1-Mito stably transfected LNCaP (mito-green) cells revealed that androgen did not induce significant mitochondrial fission by itself, although Drp1 was upregulated. However, when treated with CGP37157 (CGP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ efflux, these cells exhibited mitochondrial fission, which was further enhanced by pretreatment with R1881, suggesting that androgen-induced Drp1 expression facilitated CGP-induced mitochondrial fission. This enhanced mitochondrial fission was correlated with increased apoptosis. Transfection with dominant-negative (DN-Drp1, K38A) rescued cells from increased apoptosis, confirming the role of androgen-induced Drp1 in the observed apoptosis with combination treatment. Furthermore, we found that CGP reduced the expression of Mfn1, a protein that promotes mitochondrial fusion, a process which opposes fission.

We compared the values of miR-141 in plasma of 21 CaP patients to the levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), circulating tumor cells (CTC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Data suggest a strong correlation of miR-141 values and clinical course. For prostate cancer (CaP), the measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and radiographic studies do not adequately predict response to therapy and survival, and, therefore, new relevant biomarkers are needed. We and other researchers have shown that longitudinal measurements of PSA, circulating tumor cells (CTC), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may aid in predicting response to therapy. Results of recent studies have determined that circulating microRNA (miRNA) miR-141 is detected in plasma of patients with CaP. We, therefore, compared the temporal changes of miR-141 with the levels of CTC, LDH, and PSA in 21 patients with CaP, and longitudinally examined these markers alone or in combinations to determine the utility of miR-141 in the predicting a patient's clinical course and response to therapy. Levels of miR-141 in plasma of 21 patients with CaP were measured by using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A total of 35 intervals were assessed. Directional changes (increasing or decreasing) in PSA, CTC, and miR-141 had sensitivity in predicting clinical outcome (progression vs. nonprogressing) of 78.9%. Logistic regression modeling of the probability of clinical progression demonstrates that miR-141 levels predicted clinical outcomes with an odds ratio of at least 8.3. miR-141 also had the highest correlation with temporal changes of PSA with a correlation of R = 0.77 (P < .001). In this retrospective study, miR-141 demonstrated a similar ability to predict clinical progression when compared with other clinically validated biomarkers.

The objective of this study was to determine if VFA would increase the diagnosis of osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer on ADT. One hundred sixteen men aged ≥ 60yrs with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT for ≥ 6mos underwent DXA of the spine, hip, and 1/3 distal radius, VFA, and conventional vertebral X-rays. Approximately 40% of the men had clinically defined osteoporosis. The use of conventional DXA criteria (spine and hip) alone resulted in the misdiagnosis of approx 75% of patients. VFA and addition of the 1/3 distal radius site performed by DXA both increased the rate of diagnosis and reduced the misclassification of osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer, compared with conventional DXA criteria alone. Analysis indicated that VFA assessment of mild, moderate, and severe fractures from all readable vertebrae (T5-L4) had a kappa statistic, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.92, 100%, and 95%, respectively, with semiquantitative radiography.

Physicians are seeking ways to measure progression of the disease such that AS is abandoned when appropriate. A blood test, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and the concept of doubling time (PSADT) and PSA kinetics are being used as proxies of disease speed of progression. Studies using these proxies report conflicting results. These studies cast doubts on the current rules for stopping AS and recent research concludes that PSADT and PSA kinetics are unreliable triggers for intervention in an AS program. These findings are consistent with stochastic processes being analyzed as if they were ""deterministic"" (i.e., current models measure disease progression by PSA's evolution assuming it to be deterministic). A model that best describes PSA evolution is a pre-requisite to the establishment of decision criteria for abandoning AS. This paper suggests modeling PSA evolutions and kinetics as stochastic processes. Consequently, triggers for stopping AS may be different than PSADT and can result in substantially different recommendations, which are likely to have significant impact on patients and the healthcare system.""","""['Eliezer Z Prisman', 'Amiram Gafni', 'Antonio Finelli']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['Testing the evolution process of prostate-specific antigen in early stage prostate cancer: what is the proper underlying model?', 'Screening, risk assessment, and the approach to therapy in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Prospective evaluation of selection criteria for active surveillance in Japanese patients with stage T1cN0M0 prostate cancer.', 'Posttreatment prostatic-specific antigen doubling time as a surrogate endpoint for prostate cancer-specific survival: an analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Protocol 92-02.', 'Active surveillance with selective delayed intervention using PSA doubling time for good risk prostate cancer.']"""

Design and methods:   We measured the TAC using trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC) assays in 80 serum samples: 20 presented elevated values of CA 19-9; 20 had elevated PSA levels and two groups of 20 samples had values within reference ranges respectively.  Results:   Total antioxidant capacity - measured using the two different analytical methods - was higher in serum samples from patients with elevated CA 19-9 and PSA levels.

Conclusions:   We concluded that increased serum TAC of the patients with altered levels of CA 19-9 and PSA may be due to the response of increased reactive oxygen species and can be considered as a sign of oxidative stress of these patients.

Measurements:   To examine the rates and trends of intraoperative and postoperative complications, transfusion rates, length of stay in excess of the median, and in-hospital mortality. We tested the effect of the late (2006-2007) versus the early (2001-2005) study period on all outcomes using multivariable logistic regression models controlled for clustering among hospitals.  Results and limitations:   Intraoperative and postoperative complications decreased from 7.0% to 0.8% (p < 0.001) and from 28.5% to 8.7% (p < 0.001), respectively. Transfusion rates decreased from 3.5% to 2.1% (p = 0.3). Hospital length of stay >2 d decreased from 56% to 15% (p < 0.001).

Limitations of these findings include the lack of adjustment for several patient variables including disease characteristics, surgeon variables including surgeon caseload, and the restriction to in-hospital events.

Materials and methods:   • The COLD (Cryo On-Line Data) Registry consists of case report forms with pre- and post-treatment information obtained from patients undergoing prostate cryoablation. • A total of 860 patients were stratified into low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups (D'Amico 2003 risk definitions). • Biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) was defined according to the traditional American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology definition (3 increases) and the newer (Phoenix) definition (nadir +2). • Biopsy was performed at physician discretion but most commonly for cause if a patient had an increasing or suspicious prostate-specific antigen level (PSA).  Results:   • The median age was 79 years (76-91) and the median follow-up was 16 months (4-60). • The 5-year [95% confidence interval (CI)] bDFS for the entire population using ASTRO and Phoenix definitions was 79% (4%) and 62.6% (8.3%), respectively. • Stratified by risk group, 5-year bDFS (ASTRO) was 82.4% (7.9%), 78.3% (5.8%) and 77.6% (7.7%) for low, moderate and high risk, respectively. • Using the Phoenix definition, 5-year bDFS was 74.9%± 15.3%, 61.4%± 13.2% and 58.0%± 11.9% for low-, moderate- and high-risk groups, respectively. • Incontinence was reported in eight patients (0.9%).  Conclusion:   • Whole gland cryoablation in older men maintains oncological efficacy similar to that of younger men without increased morbidity.""","""['Nivedita Dhar', 'John F Ward', 'Michael L Cher', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Editorial comment: Primary full-gland prostate cryoablation in older men (> age of 75 years): results from 860 patients tracked with the COLD registry.', 'Re: Primary full-gland prostate cryoablation in older men (> age of 75 years): results from 860 patients tracked with the Cold Registry.', 'Whole gland primary prostate cryoablation: initial results from the cryo on-line data registry.', 'Single center experience with third-generation cryosurgery for management of organ-confined prostate cancer: critical evaluation of short-term outcomes, complications, and patient quality of life.', 'Salvage prostate cryoablation: initial results from the cryo on-line data registry.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Variation in the definition of biochemical recurrence in patients treated for localized prostate cancer: the American Urological Association Prostate Guidelines for Localized Prostate Cancer Update Panel report and recommendations for a standard in the reporting of surgical outcomes.', 'Current status and future prospective of focal therapy for localized prostate cancer: development of multiparametric MRI, MRI-TRUS fusion image-guided biopsy, and treatment modalities.', 'Role of active surveillance and focal therapy in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancers.', ""Re-purposing cryoablation: a combinatorial 'therapy' for the destruction of tissue."", 'Prognostic value of saturated prostate cryoablation for localized prostate cancer.', 'Salvage cryosurgery for locally recurrent prostate cancer after primary cryotherapy.']"""

It is well known that MPO catalyses oxidation reactions via the release of reactive halogenating and nitrating species and thus induces tissue damage. Several studies have already implicated MPO in the development of neoplasia. Chronic or recurrent prostatic inflammation has long been recognized as having the potential to initiate and promote the development of prostate cancer. The objective was to investigate whether MPO is present in the prostate.  Methods:   Human prostate material was obtained from biopsies, transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP), prostatic adenomectomies, and retropubic radical prostatectomies. Twenty-nine slides of normal prostate tissue, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer were reviewed by a pathologist. Immunohistochemical analysis using MPO-specific human antibody was performed to detect MPO in the prostate tissue.  Results:   Immunocytohistochemistry showed cellular colocalization of MPO in the secretory epithelial cells of the prostate with staining varying from light to strong intensity. Staining in the glandular apical snouts was often reinforced although staining of basal as well as of luminal glandular cells was also present.

Significant inverse correlations were found for GRPR and increasing Gleason score, PSA value, and tumor size. A stratified Kaplan-Meyer analysis for GRPR and high AR expression shows a significant prognostic advantage for high GRPR expression, whereas GRPR expression alone shows no independent prognostic value. Highly significant correlations for GRPR, AR, and Cyclin D1 were found.  Conclusions:   Our data show that GRPR is overexpressed in prostate cancer, particularly of lower grade and smaller size.

To aid in the clinical decision making, novel biomarkers are being sought. Direct, global-scale examination of primary human specimens provides the most relevant picture of the tumor machinery and its perturbations, and this information is highly significant in the context of biomarker discovery. In the pilot study reported here, we focused on mapping of the phosphoproteome in human prostate cancer specimens obtained from a tissue repository. A gel-free proteomic strategy included whole proteome digestion, phosphopeptide enrichment with immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), and phosphoprotein identification via LC-MS/MS and database searches. We applied this strategy to obtain phosphoprotein signatures from a set of five specimens. Phosphoproteins were characterized from each specimen. The phosphoprotein panels included 16-23 phosphoproteins that encompassed 18-30 phosphorylation sites. Some of proteins/sites were characterized in multiple specimens, whereas the majority of sites were found in single specimens. The characterized panels include caldesmone, desmin, HSP β-1, synaptopodin-2, filamin-C, tensin-1, and others.

However, due in part to pathologist misreading, there is significant discrepancy of GS between needle-core biopsies (NCB) and radical prostatectomy specimens. We assessed the requirement for re-evaluating NCB diagnosed by outside pathologists in patients referred to our institution for management of PC. In 100 patients, we reviewed both their original ""outside"" and second-opinion (""in-house"") diagnoses of the same NCB specimens, and compared them with the diagnoses of the whole-mount radical prostatectomy (WMRP) specimens (gold standard for analysis). We found that both outside and in-house biopsy GS vary significantly from the WMRP diagnoses, with GS undergrading substantially predominating above overgrading. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the main diagnostic discrepancy was in the differentiation between primary and secondary Gleason grades (mainly 3 and 4) and that outside NCB GS was significantly less accurate with respect to the WMRP specimens than the in-house NCB GS. In addition, in a different cohort of 65 NCB cases, we found that in 5 out of 11 patients, outside pathologists failed to report the presence of extraprostatic extension, an important feature for diagnosis of a higher pathology stage (pT3a). Since histopathological evaluation is a critical factor for appropriate treatment selection, we recommend that a re-evaluation by in-house urologic pathologists should be performed in all outside NCB specimens before patients are admitted for treatment in any given institution.""","""['Al B Barqawi', 'Ruslan Turcanu', 'Eduard J Gamito', 'Scott M Lucia', ""Colin I O'Donnell"", 'E David Crawford', 'David D La Rosa', 'Francisco G La Rosa']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Pathol""","""['The value of mandatory second opinion pathology review of prostate needle biopsy interpretation before radical prostatectomy.', 'Gleason grading challenges in the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma: experience of a single institution.', 'Clinical and cost impact of second-opinion pathology.

PDT is therefore an option for focal therapy of localized disease or for otherwise unresectable tumors. In addition, there is increasing evidence that PDT can induce systemic anti-tumor immunity, supporting control of tumor cells, which were not eliminated by the primary treatment. However, the effect of non-lethal PDT on the behavior and malignant potential of tumor cells surviving PDT is molecularly not well defined.  Methodology/principal findings:   Here we have evaluated changes in the transcriptome of human glioblastoma (U87, U373) and human (PC-3, DU145) and murine prostate cancer cells (TRAMP-C1, TRAMP-C2) after non-lethal PDT in vitro and in vivo using oligonucleotide microarray analyses. We found that the overall response was similar between the different cell lines and photosensitizers both in vitro and in vivo. The most prominently upregulated genes encoded proteins that belong to pathways activated by cellular stress or are involved in cell cycle arrest. This response was similar to the rescue response of tumor cells following high-dose PDT. In contrast, tumor cells dealing with non-lethal PDT were found to significantly upregulate a number of immune genes, which included the chemokine genes CXCL2, CXCL3 and IL8/CXCL8 as well as the genes for IL6 and its receptor IL6R, which can stimulate proinflammatory reactions, while IL6 and IL6R can also enhance tumor growth.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that PDT can support anti-tumor immune responses and is, therefore, a rational therapy even if tumor cells cannot be completely eliminated by primary phototoxic mechanisms alone. However, non-lethal PDT can also stimulate tumor growth-promoting autocrine loops, as seen by the upregulation of IL6 and its receptor. Thus the efficacy of PDT to treat tumors may be improved by controlling unwanted and potentially deleterious growth-stimulatory pathways.""","""['Robert Kammerer', 'Alexander Buchner', 'Patrick Palluch', 'Thomas Pongratz', 'Konstantin Oboukhovskij', 'Wolfgang Beyer', 'Ann Johansson', 'Herbert Stepp', 'Reinhold Baumgartner', 'Wolfgang Zimmermann']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['IL-6 potentiates tumor resistance to photodynamic therapy (PDT).', 'Photodynamic therapy of tumors can lead to development of systemic antigen-specific immune response.', 'High-field magnetic resonance imaging of the response of human prostate cancer to Pc 4-based photodynamic therapy in an animal model.', 'Antitumor immunity promoted by vascular occluding therapy: lessons from vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP).', '5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy for the treatment of high-grade gliomas.', 'Advances in the Application of Preclinical Models in Photodynamic Therapy for Tumor: A Narrative Review.', 'Interstitial Photodynamic Therapy Using 5-ALA for Malignant Glioma Recurrences.', 'Comparing the immunogenicity of glycosidase-directed resiquimod prodrugs mediated by cancer cell metabolism.', 'The Emerging Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in the Glioma Immune Suppressive Microenvironment.', 'Vitamin D Receptor Activation and Photodynamic Priming Enables Durable Low-dose Chemotherapy.']"""

Methodology:   A retrospective cohort study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance claims database was conducted to identify adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without a history of cancer who initiated insulin glargine (n = 10,190) or intermediate/long-acting HI (n = 49,253) during 2004-2007. Exclusive users were followed from the date of insulin initiation to the earliest of cancer diagnosis, death, disenrollment, or December 31 2007. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for baseline propensity score.  Findings:   The incidence rate of all cancer per 1,000 person-years was 13.8 for insulin glargine initiators (179 cases) and 16.0 for intermediate/long-acting HI initiators (1,445 cases) during an average follow-up of 2 years. No significant difference in overall cancer risk between insulin glargine initiators and HI initiators was found. For men, however, the adjusted hazard ratio of insulin glargine use as compared with intermediate/long-acting HI was 2.15 (95% CI 1.01-4.59) for pancreatic cancer, and 2.42 (95% CI 1.50-8.40) for prostate cancer.

Preventive services are one area in which the use of a PCMH is hoped to achieve gains, though there has been limited exploration of PCMH characteristics that can assist with practice redesign. The purpose of this study was to examine whether first-contact access characteristics of a medical home (eg, availability of appointments or advice by telephone) confer additional benefit in the receipt of preventive services for individuals who already have a longitudinal relationship with a primary care physician at a site of care.  Methods:   This was a secondary analysis examining data from 5507 insured adults with a usual physician who participated in the 2003 to 2006 round of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. Using logistic regression, we calculated the odds of receiving each preventive service, comparing individuals who had first-contact access with those without first-contact access.  Results:   Eighteen percent of the sample received care with first-contact access. In multivariable analyses, after adjustment, individuals who had first-contact access had higher odds of having received a prostate examination (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.20-2.18), a flu shot (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01-1.82), and a cholesterol test (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01-1.82) during the past year. There was no significant difference in receipt of mammograms (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.94-1.61).  Conclusions:   In the primary care home, first-contact accessibility adds benefit, beyond continuity of care with a physician, in improving receipt of preventive services. Amid increasing primary care demands and finite resources available to translate the PCMH into clinic settings, there is a need for further studies of the interplay between specific PCMH principles and how they perform in practice.""","""['Nancy Pandhi', 'Jennifer E DeVoe', 'Jessica R Schumacher', 'Christie Bartels', 'Carolyn T Thorpe', 'Joshua M Thorpe', 'Maureen A Smith']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Am Board Fam Med""","""['Number of first-contact access components required to improve preventive service receipt in primary care homes.', 'Cross-sectional study examining whether the extent of first-contact access to primary care differentially benefits those with certain personalities to receive preventive services.', 'Principles of the patient-centered medical home and preventive services delivery.', 'Do Patient-Centered Medical Home Access and Care Coordination Measures Reflect the Contribution of All Team Members?

Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated proteins involved in PI3K/Akt, Erk/MAPK, and p38 MAPK signaling networks was performed in human cell line xenografts from lung, brain, ovary, and prostate tumors. In order to replicate real-world practices, the tissues were subjected to ischemic times of 0 (baseline), 1, 4, and 24 hours before fixation in formalin. Two key concepts emerge from this analysis: (1) the stability of different phospho-epitopes within a given tumor type is variable (e.g. phospho-PRAS40 is more labile than phospho-S6 ribosomal protein) and (2) the stability of a given phospho-epitope (e.g. phospho-MAPKAPK2) varies significantly across different tumor types.

Attenuation is associated with increased expression of Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp27, and clusterin (CLU) that mediate tumor cell survival and treatment resistance. We hypothesized that preventing CLU induction in this response would enhance Hsp90 inhibitor-induced CRPC cell death in vitro and in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we treated CRPC with the Hsp90 inhibitor PF-04929113 or 17-AAG in the absence or presence of OGX-011, an antisense drug that targets CLU. Treatment with either Hsp90 inhibitor alone increased nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of the heat shock factor HSF-1, which stimulated dose- and time-dependent increases in HSP expression, especially CLU expression. Treatment-induced increases in CLU were blocked by OGX-011, which synergistically enhanced the activity of Hsp90 inhibition on CRPC cell growth and apoptosis. Accompanying these effects was a decrease in HSF-1 transcriptional activity as well as expression of HSPs, Akt, prostate-specific antigen, and androgen receptor. In vivo evaluation of the Hsp90 inhibitors with OGX-011 in xenograft models of human CRPC showed that OGX-011 markedly potentiated antitumor efficacy, leading to an 80% inhibition of tumor growth with prolonged survival compared with Hsp90 inhibitor monotherapy. Together, our findings indicate that Hsp90 inhibitor-induced activation of the heat shock response and CLU is attenuated by OGX-011, with synergistic effects on delaying CRPC progression.""","""['Francois Lamoureux', 'Christian Thomas', 'Min-Jean Yin', 'Hidetoshi Kuruma', 'Eliana Beraldi', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Martin E Gleave']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Suppression of heat shock protein 27 using OGX-427 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and potentiates heat shock protein 90 inhibitors to delay castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Clusterin inhibition using OGX-011 synergistically enhances zoledronic acid activity in osteosarcoma.', 'Cotargeting Androgen Receptor and Clusterin Delays Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Progression by Inhibiting Adaptive Stress Response and AR Stability.', 'Hsp90 inhibitors in breast cancer: a systematic review.', 'The promise of heat shock protein inhibitors in the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic phase separation of the androgen receptor and its coactivators key to regulate gene expression.', 'Association of circulating markers with cognitive decline after radiation therapy for brain metastasis.', 'BRCA mutational status shapes the stromal microenvironment of pancreatic cancer linking clusterin expression in cancer associated fibroblasts with HSF1 signaling.', 'Lipoproteins in the Central Nervous System: From Biology to Pathobiology.', 'CircSTK40 contributes to recurrent implantation failure via modulating the HSP90/AKT/FOXO1 axis.']"""

If supplemental external beam treatment is administered afterward, the seeds may cause substantial dose perturbation, which is being investigated in this article.  Methods and materials:   Film measurements using 6-MV beam were primarily carried out using Kodak XV2 film layered above and below a nonradioactive iodine-125 ((125)I) seed. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out using DOSXYZnrc. Other experimental comparisons looked at changing beam energy, depth, and field size, including two opposing fields' pair. Effect of multiple seeds spatially spaced 0.5cm vertically was also studied.  Results:   For a single (125)I seed, on XV film, there is a localized dose enhancement of 6.3% upstream and -10.9% downstream. With two opposing fields, a cold spot around the seed of ∼3% was noticed. Increasing beam energy and field size decreased the magnitude of this effect, whereas the effect was found to increase with the increasing Z of material. DOSXYZnrc and EBT-2 film verified maximum dose enhancement of +15% upstream and -20% downstream of the (125)I seed surface.  Conclusions:   In general, the dose perturbation because of the seeds was spatially limited to ∼2mm upstream and ∼5mm downstream to the incident beam. Similar to other heterogeneities, the seeds perturbation depends on incident beam energy, field size, and its Z. With multiple seeds spatially apart and multiple radiation fields routinely used in external beam radiotherapy, the cumulative effect may not result in clinically significant dose perturbation.""","""['James Paul Steinman', 'Mohammad Bakhtiari', 'Harish Kumar Malhotra']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Monte Carlo simulations of dose near a nonradioactive gold seed.', 'Commissioning stereotactic radiosurgery beams using both experimental and theoretical methods.', 'Fiducial markers implanted during prostate brachytherapy for guiding conformal external beam radiation therapy.', 'Organ-confined prostate carcinoma radiation brachytherapy compared with external either photon- or hadron-beam radiation therapy.

The Epstein criteria, which utilize prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) benchmarks, are recognized to be a reasonable method of selecting men for active surveillance of prostate cancer. Transrectal ultrasonography, however, may not be a sufficiently precise method of measuring prostate volume for the determination of PSAD. This study shows that despite impressive intra-observer variability in transrectal ultrasonography guided prostate volume measurements, this variability typically does not affect the PSAD to an extent by which qualification for active surveillance would be altered.  Objective:   • To determine intra-observer variability in transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guided prostate volume measurements in the Johns Hopkins active surveillance group and to establish whether or not this variability could affect prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) estimates in this cohort.  Patients and methods:   • In all, 253 patients with a combined total of 1111 prostate biopsies underwent TRUS-guided prostate volume measurements performed by the same physician at least three times over the course of their care. • Coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for each set of measurements performed on each patient by the same physician, and average CVs were determined for each physician and for physicians overall. The CVs were correlated with the average of each patient's measured prostate volumes to look for any trend. • Finally, measured prostate volumes were used with each patient's initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value to calculate PSAD to reveal whether or not the degree of variability found in these measurements would have led to PSADs that would have otherwise precluded qualification for active surveillance.  Results:   • The average CV for all sets of prostate volume data was 0.168. Average CVs for each physician ranged from 0.136 to 0.234. • However, actual CVs ranged anywhere from 0.013 to 0.549. The CVs were found to have no correlation with prostate volumes (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.04). • In 95% of cases, variability in TRUS-guided prostate volume measurement did not affect PSAD sufficiently to elicit a value greater than 0.15.  Conclusions:   • Even among individuals who are highly experienced in TRUS-guided prostate volume measurement, significant intra-observer variation exists. However, this variability is not enough to affect one's eligibility for prostate cancer active surveillance when PSAD criteria are used. • The TRUS-guided prostate volume measurements remain a reliable method of assessing PSAD in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Joan S Ko', 'Patricia Landis', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Alan W Partin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Volume-adjusted prostate-specific antigen (PSA) variables in detecting impalpable prostate cancer in men with PSA levels of 2-4 ng/mL: transabdominal measurement makes a significant contribution.', 'Prostate volumetric assessment by magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound: impact of variation in calculated prostate-specific antigen density on patient eligibility for active surveillance program.', 'Detection of prostatic carcinoma: the role of TRUS, TRUS guided biopsy, digital rectal examination, PSA and PSA density.', 'Prostate-specific antigen versus prostate-specific antigen density as predictor of tumor volume, margin status, pathologic stage, and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Optimization of prostate biopsy in patients considered for active surveillance.

Patients and methods:   In this report genotyping for this marker was performed in 235 prostate cancer patients and 111 healthy control subjects. Clinical follow-up data were available for a subset of 197 patients.  Results:   Neither significant evidence for differences in genotype distributions between the prostate cancer cases and controls (odds ratio CT/TT=0.94, 95% CI 0.58-1.51, p=.82) nor evidence for genotype differences in e.g. progression-free survival in the subset of patients was observable (hazard ratio CT/TT=0.77, 95% CI 0.44-1.37, p=.38).

Of these, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) gene products lead to inactivation of steroids.  Objective:   Our objective was to determine whether polymorphisms in five UGT genes, involved in steroid metabolism, are associated with the risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) and to examine their relationship with hormonal exposure.  Design:   The study included 526 Caucasian and 320 Asian men who underwent RP for clinically localized PCa. The relationship between genotypes and biochemical recurrence were assessed with multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Plasma steroids were measured using specific and sensitive mass spectrometry-based methods.  Results:   The presence of at least two deleted copies of UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 genes resulted in a hazard ratio of 2.26 (95% confidence interval = 1.41-3.61; P = 0.0007) for Caucasians and 2.16 (95% confidence interval = 1.24-3.73; P = 0.006) for Asians. A positive association was observed only between UGT2B17 deletion and the Gleason score in Asians, whereas no other interaction was shown with prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and TNM (tumor node metastasis) staging. Patients carrying UGT2B17 deletions and those with three deleted UGT2B copies had significantly lower androgen glucuronides, in support of an altered androgen metabolism.  Conclusion:   This study is the first to recognize the prognostic significance of common deletions in steroid inactivation pathways in localized PCa after RP.

In the present study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with LMWH for 24 h. We found that the resulting HUVECs could significantly inhibit the highly metastatic human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3M) in terms of its adhesion to the endothelium and migration across the endothelium, according to scanning electron microscopy. We also determined the elevated levels of endothelial intercellular Ca(2+) concentration after the adhesion of PC-3M cells to HUVECs was greatly reduced by incubation with LMWH. Using proteomics, we surveyed the global protein changes in HUVECs after LMWH treatment and identified four down-regulated proteins that were possible isoforms of cytoskeletal vimentin intermediate filaments, cartilage-derived C-type lectin, and serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1β (PP-1B). LMWH affected the morphology of vimentin and the expression levels of α(v) integrin and PP-1B in HUVECs bound to PC-3M cells. Vimentin assists in the adhesion of PC-3M cells, which was confirmed by short interfering RNA experiments. Furthermore, the direct binding of purified vimentin protein with LMWH was detected with surface plasmon resonance methods. However, when we used fluorescence-labeled heparin for 24 h to identify whether this binding occurred within cells, heparin was distributed principally around endothelial cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the monoincubation of LMWH with HUVECs could inhibit PC-3M cell adhesion to, and migration through, endothelium.

Patients and methods:   Transurethral prostate (TURP) specimens in tissue microarray format and medical records from a 758 patient cohort were obtained. Slides were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), imaged and digitally outlined for invasive tumour. Additional sections were analysed with two multiplex quantitative immunofluorescence (IF) assays for cytokeratin-18 (epithelial cells), 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole(nuclei), p63/high-molecular-weight keratin (basal cells), androgen receptor (AR) and α-methyl CoA-racemase, Ki67, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT)and CD34.

Results:   Using a training set of 256 patients with 24% events, one clinical variable (Gleason score) and two tissue-specific characteristics (H&E morphometry and tumour-specific pAKT levels) were identified (concordance index [CoI] 0.79, sensitivity 76%, specificity 86%, hazard ratio [HR] 6.6) for predicting PCSS. Validation on an independent cohort of 269 patients with 29% events yielded a CoI of 0.76, sensitivity 59%, specificity 80% and HR of 3.6.

However, promising in vitro results often do not translate to in vivo clinical applications. To better understand this obstacle, we measured the expression differences in receptor signatures among several human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts as a function of tumorigenicity.  Methods:   Messenger RNA and protein expression levels for integrin α(ν) β(3), neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) were measured in LNCaP, C4-2, and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines and in murine xenografts using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Stable expression patterns were observed for integrin α(ν) and PSMA in all cells and corresponding xenografts. Integrin β(3) mRNA expression was greatly reduced in C4-2 xenografts and greatly elevated in PC-3 xenografts compared with the corresponding cultured cells. NTSR1 mRNA expression was greatly elevated in LNCaP and PC-3 xenografts. PSCA mRNA expression was elevated in C4-2 xenografts when compared with C4-2 cells cultured in vitro. Furthermore, at the protein level, PSCA was re-expressed in all xenografts compared with cells in culture.  Conclusions:   The regulation of mRNA and protein expression of the cell-surface target proteins α(ν) β(3), NTSR1, PSMA, and PSCA, in prostate cancer cells with different tumorigenic potential, was influenced by factors of the microenvironment, differing between cell cultures and murine xenotransplants.

Methods:   Cytokine levels were compared for each patient at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with lenalidomide. Regression models for correlated data were used to assess associations of cytokine levels with lenalidomide treatment effect. Estimates were obtained using generalized estimating equations. Changes in circulating anti-prostate antibodies were evaluated using a high-throughput immunoblot technique.  Results:   Treatment with lenalidomide was associated with global changes in immunoreactivity to a number of prostate-associated antigens, as well as with changes in circulating levels of the T(H) 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13.

Results:   Of the regions identified previously, modest evidence of replication was observed only on the short arm of chromosome 8, where HLOD scores of 1.63 and 3.60 were observed in the complete set of families and families with young average age at diagnosis, respectively. The most significant linkage signals found in the complete set of families were observed across a broad, 37 cM interval on 4q13-25, with LOD scores ranging from 2.02 to 2.62, increasing to 4.50 in families with older average age at diagnosis. In families with multiple cases presenting with more aggressive disease, LOD scores over 3.0 were observed at 8q24 in the vicinity of previously identified common PC risk variants, as well as MYC, an important gene in PC biology.

The objective of the study was to examine the risks of site-specific cancer in people with incident type 2 diabetes during different time windows following diabetes onset.  Methods:   This was a population-based retrospective cohort study. The study period was 1 April 1994 to 31 March 2006; censoring occurred at 31 March 2006, at death or on departure from British Columbia, Canada. Using linked health databases, we identified incident cohorts with and without diabetes, who were matched by age, sex and index year. Following a minimum 2-year cancer washout period, first site-specific cancers were identified prospectively in both cohorts.  Results:   Within 3 months following diabetes onset, participants with diabetes had significantly increased risks of colorectal, lung, liver, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers. After the initial 3-month period, the risks for colorectal (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05, 1.25), liver (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.93, 3.31) and endometrial (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.28, 1.94) cancers remained significantly elevated compared with those without diabetes.

Therefore, we explored the change in androgen receptor (AR)-related gene expression during this transition in a novel cell model.  Material and methods:   Prostate cancer cells were continuously treated with competitive androgen receptor inhibitor hydroxyflutamide for 1.5 years, which yielded an flutamide-insensitive LNCaP subline, LNCaP-flu, as confirmed by MTT assays, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy. We analyzed the differences in gene expression in LNCaP-flu cells and LNCaP cells using gene chips and follow-up RT-PCR.  Results:   Over 2,428 genes were differentially expressed between these cell lines: 1,194 were down-regulated and 1,234 were up-regulated. Three genes in particular were considered related to the androgen-dependent transition: NCOR1, TIF2 (NCOA2), and ARA70 (NCOA4). There were no apparent changes in expression of the androgen receptor or prostate-specific antigen.

Our study suggests that silica-coated magnetite nanoparticles reported in this study can potentially act as improved MR contrast agents by addressing a number of aforementioned issues, including longer shelf life and stability in biological fluids.

Recently, a frequent chromosomal aberration fusing androgen regulated TMPRSS2 promoter and the ERG gene (TMPRSS2/ERG) was discovered in prostate cancer. Several studies demonstrated cooperation between TMPRSS2/ERG and other defective pathways in cancer progression. However, the unveiling of more specific pathways in which TMPRSS2/ERG takes part, requires further investigation. Using immortalized prostate epithelial cells we were able to show that TMPRSS2/ERG over-expressing cells undergo an Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), manifested by acquisition of mesenchymal morphology and markers as well as migration and invasion capabilities. These findings were corroborated in vivo, where the control cells gave rise to discrete nodules while the TMPRSS2/ERG-expressing cells formed malignant tumors, which expressed EMT markers. To further investigate the general transcription scheme induced by TMPRSS2/ERG, cells were subjected to a microarray analysis that revealed a distinct EMT expression program, including up-regulation of the EMT facilitators, ZEB1 and ZEB2, and down-regulation of the epithelial marker CDH1(E-Cadherin). A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed direct binding of TMPRSS2/ERG to the promoter of ZEB1 but not ZEB2. However, TMPRSS2/ERG was able to bind the promoters of the ZEB2 modulators, IL1R2 and SPINT1.

Recent studies have demonstrated an in vivo signaling pathway mediated by ribosomal protein (RP)-Mdm2 interaction that responds to ribosome biogenesis stress and evokes a protective p53 reaction. It has been shown that mice harboring a Cys-to-Phe mutation in the zinc finger of Mdm2 that specifically disrupts RP L11-Mdm2 binding are prone to accelerated lymphomagenesis in an oncogenic c-Myc driven mouse model of Burkitt's lymphoma. Because most oncogenes when upregulated simultaneously promote both cellular growth and proliferation, it therefore stands to reason that the RP-Mdm2-p53 pathway might also be essential in response to oncogenes other than c-Myc. Using genetically engineered mice, we now show that disruption of the RP-Mdm2-p53 pathway by an Mdm2(C305F) mutation does not accelerate prostatic tumorigenesis induced by inactivation of the pRb family proteins (pRb/p107/p130). In contrast, loss of p19Arf greatly accelerates the progression of prostate cancer induced by inhibition of pRb family proteins. Moreover, using ectopically expressed oncogenic H-Ras we demonstrate that p53 response remains intact in the Mdm2(C305F) mutant MEF cells. Thus, unlike the p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 pathway, which is considered a general oncogenic response pathway, the RP-Mdm2-p53 pathway appears to specifically suppress tumorigenesis induced by oncogenic c-Myc.""","""['Wenqi Pan', 'Sameer Issaq', 'Yanping Zhang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Oncogenic c-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis is inhibited non-redundantly by the p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 and RP-Mdm2-p53 pathways.', 'Disruption of the RP-MDM2-p53 pathway accelerates APC loss-induced colorectal tumorigenesis.', 'RPL23 Links Oncogenic RAS Signaling to p53-Mediated Tumor Suppression.', 'The RP-Mdm2-p53 pathway and tumorigenesis.', 'RP-MDM2-p53 Pathway: Linking Ribosomal Biogenesis and Tumor Surveillance.', 'Ribosomal proteins and human diseases: molecular mechanisms and targeted therapy.', 'Knockdown of IARS2 Inhibited Proliferation of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells by Regulating p53/p21/PCNA/eIF4E Pathway.', 'Ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6) is recruited to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-dependent manner and regulates the DNA damage response.', 'Disruption of the ribosomal P complex leads to stress-induced autophagy.', 'Targeting MDM2-p53 interaction for cancer therapy: are we there yet?']"""

Previously, some depsipeptides have been linked to increased cardiac toxicity. Clinical databases were searched for cardiac adverse events (CAEs) that occurred in clinical trials with the single-agent plitidepsin. Demographic, clinical and pharmacological variables were explored by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Forty-six of 578 treated patients (8.0%) had at least one CAE (11 patients (1.9%) with plitidepsin-related CAEs), none with fatal outcome as a direct consequence. The more frequent CAEs were rhythm abnormalities (n = 31; 5.4%), mostly atrial fibrillation/flutter (n = 15; 2.6%). Of note, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias did not occur. Myocardial injury events (n = 17; 3.0%) included possible ischemic-related and non-ischemic events. Other events (miscellaneous, n = 6; 1.0%) were not related to plitidepsin. Significant associations were found with prostate or pancreas cancer primary diagnosis (p = 0.0017), known baseline cardiac risk factors (p = 0.0072), myalgia present at baseline (p = 0.0140), hemoglobin levels lower than 10 g/dL (p = 0.0208) and grade ≥2 hypokalemia (p = 0.0095). Treatment-related variables (plitidepsin dose, number of cycles, schedule and/or total cumulative dose) were not associated. Electrocardiograms performed before and after plitidepsin administration (n = 136) detected no relevant effect on QTc interval. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed had a significant impact on the probability of developing a CAE. In conclusion, the most frequent CAE type was atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, although its frequency was not different to that reported in the age-matched healthy population, while other CAEs types were rare. No dose-cumulative pattern was observed, and no treatment-related variables were associated with CAEs. Relevant risk factors identified were related to the patient's condition and/or to disease-related characteristics rather than to drug exposure.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) exploits this dependence and is used to treat metastatic prostate cancer; however, regression initially seen with ADT gives way to development of incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Although ADT generates a therapeutic response, it is also associated with a pattern of metabolic alterations consistent with metabolic syndrome including elevated circulating insulin. Because CRPC cells are capable of synthesizing androgens de novo, we hypothesized that insulin may also influence steroidogenesis in CRPC. In this study, we examined this hypothesis by evaluating the effect of insulin on steroid synthesis in prostate cancer cell lines. Treatment with 10 nmol/L insulin increased mRNA and protein expression of steroidogenesis enzymes and upregulated the insulin receptor substrate insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2). Similarly, insulin treatment upregulated intracellular testosterone levels and secreted androgens, with the concentrations of steroids observed similar to the levels reported in prostate cancer patients. With similar potency to dihydrotestosterone, insulin treatment resulted in increased mRNA expression of prostate-specific antigen. CRPC progression also correlated with increased expression of IRS-2 and insulin receptor in vivo.

Using a combination of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and hybridization with comprehensive promoter arrays, we have identified approximately 3,700 promoters that are hypomethylated in tumor samples. The hypomethylated promoters appeared in clusters across the genome suggesting that a high-level organization underlies the epigenomic changes in cancer. In normal liver, most hypomethylated promoters showed an intermediate level of methylation and expression, however, high-CpG dense promoters showed the most profound increase in gene expression. The demethylated genes are mainly involved in cell growth, cell adhesion and communication, signal transduction, mobility, and invasion; functions that are essential for cancer progression and metastasis. The DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, activated several of the genes that are demethylated and induced in tumors, supporting a causal role for demethylation in activation of these genes. Previous studies suggested that MBD2 was involved in demethylation of specific human breast and prostate cancer genes. Whereas MBD2 depletion in normal liver cells had little or no effect, we found that its depletion in human HCC and adenocarcinoma cells resulted in suppression of cell growth, anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness as well as an increase in promoter methylation and silencing of several of the genes that are hypomethylated in tumors.

Results:   We report that BBS stimulates COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, and the release of prostaglandin E2 from the GRP receptor (GRPR)-positive, androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell line, PC-3. BBS-stimulated COX-2 expression is mediated, in part, by p38MAPK and PI3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, and blocked by a GRPR antagonist. The PI3K/Akt pathway couples GRPR to the transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and enhanced COX-2 promoter activity. Although BBS stimulates nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) in PC-3, NF-κB does not regulate GRPR-mediated COX-2 expression. The p38MAPK pathway increases BBS-stimulated COX-2 expression by slowing the degradation of COX-2 mRNA. Expression of recombinant GRPR in the androgen-sensitive cell line LNCaP is sufficient to confer BBS-stimulated COX-2 expression via the p38MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.

Time-dependent results show that just by measuring the fluorescence intensity change, the photothermal therapy response during the therapy process can be monitored. The possible mechanism and operating principle of the NSET assay are discussed. Ultimately, this NSET assay could have enormous potential applications in rapid, on-site monitoring of the photothermal therapy process, which is critical to providing effective treatment of cancer and multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.""","""['Anant K Singh', 'Wentong Lu', 'Dulal Senapati', 'Sadia Afrin Khan', 'Zhen Fan', 'Tapas Senapati', 'Teresa Demeritte', 'Lule Beqa', 'Paresh Chandra Ray']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Small""","""['Gold nano-popcorn-based targeted diagnosis, nanotherapy treatment, and in situ monitoring of photothermal therapy response of prostate cancer cells using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.', 'Designing a multicolor long range nanoscopic ruler for the imaging of heterogeneous tumor cells.', 'Temperature determination of resonantly excited plasmonic branched gold nanoparticles by X-ray absorption spectroscopy.', 'Understanding and advancement in gold nanoparticle targeted photothermal therapy of cancer.', 'Strategies to improve the photothermal capacity of gold-based nanomedicines.', 'Multifunctional plasmonic shell-magnetic core nanoparticles for targeted diagnostics, isolation, and photothermal destruction of tumor cells.']"""

Soluble or expressed in immune cells, TRAIL plays an important role in the defense against tumour cells. The resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL immune surveillance is implicated in tumour development. Naturally occurring flavonoids can sensitize TRAIL-resistant cancer cells and augment their apoptotic activity. Fisetin, a dietary flavonol has cancer preventive properties. This study was designed to investigate the effect of fisetin on the TRAIL-induced apoptosis potential in prostate cancer cells. Prostate cancer cell lines represent an ideal model for research in chemoprevention. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT and LDH assays. Apoptosis was detected using Αnnexin V-FITC by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Mito-chondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was evaluated using DePsipher staining by fluorescence microscopy. Death receptor (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) expression was analysed by flow cytometry. Inhibition of NF-κB (p65) activation was confirmed with an ELISA-based TransAM NF-κB kit. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities were determined by colorimetric protease assays. Our study demonstrates that fisetin sensitizes the TRAIL-resistant androgen-dependent LNCaP and the androgen-independent DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced death. Fisetin augmented TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis in prostate cancer LNCaP cells by engaging the extrinsic (receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathways. Fisetin increased the expression of TRAIL-R1 and decreased the activity of NF-κB. Co-treatment of cancer cells with TRAIL and fisetin caused significant activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 and disruption of ΔΨm. Our data indicate the usefulness of fisetin in prostate cancer chemoprevention through enhancement of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.""","""['Ewelina Szliszka', 'Krzysztof J Helewski', 'Elzbieta Mizgala', 'Wojciech Krol']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Ethanolic extract of Brazilian green propolis sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'The dietary isoflavone biochanin-A sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'Soy isoflavones augment the effect of TRAIL-mediated apoptotic death in prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of dietary polyphenols in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis for cancer chemoprevention.', 'Targeting TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor by natural products as a potential therapeutic approach for cancer therapy.', 'The Potential Role of Fisetin, a Flavonoid in Cancer Prevention and Treatment.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.', 'Fisetin, a Potent Anticancer Flavonol Exhibiting Cytotoxic Activity against Neoplastic Malignant Cells and Cancerous Conditions: A Scoping, Comprehensive Review.', 'Fisetin Deters Cell Proliferation, Induces Apoptosis, Alleviates Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Human Cancer Cells, HeLa.']"""

For this reason, we examined the effects of blocking the Egr-1 activity by a short interfering RNA (siRNA) against Egr-1 on the expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling in the PC-3 and LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell lines. We observed that the reduction in expression of Egr-1 in PC-3 and LNCaP cells by effects of the siRNA vector resulted in lower cell viability and increased apoptosis at 24 and 120 h after transfection. This reduced cell viability correlated well with a reduced activity of the NF-κB and AP-1 factors. We analyzed the expression and activity of these factors and found that p65 and IκB but not p50 were reduced in the siRNA-treated cells. Similarly, we found that c-Fos but not c-Jun was reduced in the siRNA treated cells. These effects were translated to reduced transcriptional activity of NF-κB over cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) and p21 genes, as assayed by RT-PCR and of AP-1 over a luciferase reporter activated by AP-1 response elements. Egr-1 was also found to interact directly with p65 and IκB members of the NF-κB family, thereby was able to regulate directly their activity by post-transcriptional effects.

However, the relative contributions of the different Akt isoforms to tumorigenesis, and the effect of their deficiencies on cancer development are not well understood. We had previously shown that Akt1 deficiency is sufficient to markedly reduce the incidence of tumors in Pten(+/-) mice. Particularly, Akt1 deficiency inhibits endometrial carcinoma and prostate neoplasia in Pten(+/-) mice. Here, we analyzed the effect of Akt2 deficiency on the incidence of tumors in Pten(+/-) mice. Relative to Akt1, Akt2 deficiency had little-to-no effect on the incidence of prostate neoplasia, endometrial carcinoma, intestinal polyps and adrenal lesions in Pten(+/-) mice. However, Akt2 deficiency significantly decreased the incidence of thyroid tumors in Pten(+/-), which correlates with the relatively high level of Akt2 expression in the thyroid. Thus, unlike Akt1 deletion, Akt2 deletion is not sufficient to markedly inhibit tumorigenesis in Pten(+/-) mice in most tested tissues. The relatively small effect of Akt2 deletion on the inhibition of tumorigenesis in Pten(+/-) mice could be explained, in part, by an insufficient decrease in total Akt activity, due to the relatively lower Akt2 versus Akt1 expression, and relatively high blood insulin levels in Pten(+/-)Akt2(-/-) mice. The relatively high blood insulin levels in Pten(+/-)Akt2(-/-) mice may elevate the activity of Akt1, and possibly Akt3, thus, limiting the reduction of total Akt activity and preventing this activity from dropping to a threshold level required to inhibit tumorigenesis.""","""['P-Z Xu', 'M-L Chen', 'S-M Jeon', 'X-d Peng', 'N Hay']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['The deficiency of Akt1 is sufficient to suppress tumor development in Pten+/- mice.', 'Loss of Akt1 or Akt2 delays mammary tumor onset and suppresses tumor growth rate in MTB-IGFIR transgenic mice.', 'PTEN-deficient tumors depend on AKT2 for maintenance and survival.', 'Nonredundant functions for Akt isoforms in astrocyte growth and gliomagenesis in an orthotopic transplantation model.', 'Akt isoforms and glucose homeostasis - the leptin connection.', 'How to inhibit breast cancer and breast cancer metastasis with Akt inhibitors: Lessons learned from studies in mice.', 'Differential effects of single fatty acids and fatty acid mixtures on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/eNOS pathway in endothelial cells.', 'AGTR1 Inhibits the Progression of Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'PTEN and Other PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Lipid Phosphatases in Breast Cancer.', 'Akt isoform-specific effects on thyroid cancer development and progression in a murine thyroid cancer model.']"""

The odds ratio of recurrence and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from conditional logistic regression. Although the percentage of cases with fusion was slightly lower in cases than in controls (50 vs 57%), the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.20).

Construction of miRNA-target regulatory networks can provide useful information for the study and diagnosis of complex diseases. Many sequence-based and evolutionary information-based methods have been developed to identify miRNA-mRNA targeting relationships. However, as the amount of available miRNA and gene expression data grows, a more statistical and systematic method combining sequence-based binding predictions and expression-based correlation data becomes necessary for the accurate identification of miRNA-mRNA pairs.  Results:   We propose a Lasso regression model for the identification of miRNA-mRNA targeting relationships that combines sequence-based prediction information, miRNA co-regulation, RISC availability and miRNA/mRNA abundance data. By comparing this modelling approach with two other known methods applied to three different datasets, we found that the Lasso regression model has considerable advantages in both sensitivity and specificity. The regression coefficients in the model can be used to determine the true regulatory efficacies in tissues and was demonstrated using the miRNA target site type data. Finally, by constructing the miRNA regulatory networks in two stages of prostate cancer (PCa), we found the several significant miRNA-hubbed network modules associated with PCa metastasis. In conclusion, the Lasso regression model is a robust and informative tool for constructing the miRNA regulatory networks for diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases.  Availability:   The R program for predicting miRNA-mRNA targeting relationships using the Lasso regression model is freely available, along with the described datasets and resulting regulatory network, at http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/alarmnet/.

Areca nuts contain several alkaloids and tannins, of which arecoline is the most abundant and known to have several adverse effects in humans, specially an increased risk of oral cancer. On evaluating the effects of arecoline on the male endocrine physiology in Wistar rats, it was found that arecoline treatment led to an overall enlargement and increase in the wet weight of the prostate gland, and a two-fold increase in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels. Since the prostate is a major target for testosterone, the consequences of arecoline consumption were studied specifically in the prostate gland. Arecoline treatment led to an increase in the number of rough endoplasmic reticulum and reduction of secretory vesicles, signifying a hyperactive state of the prostate. Increased expression of androgen receptors in response to arecoline allowed for enhanced effect of testosterone in the prostate of treated animals, which augmented cell proliferation, subsequently confirmed by an increase in the expression of Ki-67 protein. Cellular proliferation was also the outcome of concomitant over expression of the G(1)-to-S cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin D1 and CDK4, both at the transcriptional and translational levels. Taken together, the findings provide the first evidence that regular use of arecoline may lead to prostatic hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and eventually to disorders associated with prostate enlargement.""","""['Indraneel Saha', 'Aniruddha Chatterjee', 'Anushree Mondal', 'Bishwa Ranjan Maiti', 'Urmi Chatterji']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Ultrastructural and hormonal changes in the pineal-testicular axis following arecoline administration in rats.', 'Tissue evidence of the testosterone role on the abnormal growth and aging effects reversion in the gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) prostate.', 'Protective role of a novel erythrocyte-derived depressing factor on blood vessels of renovascular hypertensive rats.', 'A protective role of arecoline hydrobromide in experimentally induced male diabetic rats.', 'Role of canine basal cells in prostatic post natal development, induction of hyperplasia, sex hormone-stimulated growth; and the ductal origin of carcinoma.', 'Low-dose arecoline regulates distinct core signaling pathways in oral submucous fibrosis and oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Betel Nut Arecoline Induces Different Phases of Growth Arrest between Normal and Cancerous Prostate Cells through the Reactive Oxygen Species Pathway.', 'Egr-1 mediates low-dose arecoline induced human oral mucosa fibroblast proliferation via transactivation of Wnt5a expression.', 'ARECOLINE CANNOT ALTER PINEAL-TESTICULAR RESPONSES TO METABOLIC STRESS IN WISTAR RATS.', 'DUAL ACTION OF ARECOLINE ON ADRENAL FUNCTION AND GLUCOSE-GLYCOGEN HOMEOSTASIS IN METABOLIC STRESS IN MICE.']"""

Specific roles of inflammatory neutrophils and their distinct proMMP-9 in the coordinate regulation of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell dissemination, however, have not been addressed. We demonstrate that the primary tumors formed by highly disseminating variants of human fibrosarcoma and prostate carcinoma recruit elevated levels of infiltrating MMP-9-positive neutrophils and concomitantly exhibit enhanced levels of angiogenesis and intravasation. Specific inhibition of neutrophil influx by interleukin 8 (IL-8) neutralization resulted in the coordinated diminishment of tumor angiogenesis and intravasation, both of which were rescued by purified neutrophil proMMP-9. However, if neutrophil proMMP-9, naturally devoid of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP), was delivered in complex with TIMP-1 or in a mixture with TIMP-2, the protease failed to rescue the inhibitory effects of anti-IL8 therapy, indicating that the TIMP-free status of proMMP-9 is critical for facilitating tumor angiogenesis and intravasation. Our findings directly link tumor-associated neutrophils and their TIMP-free proMMP-9 with the ability of aggressive tumor cells to induce the formation of new blood vessels that serve as conduits for tumor cell dissemination. Thus, treatment of cancers associated with neutrophil infiltration may benefit from specific targeting of neutrophil MMP-9 at early stages to prevent ensuing tumor angiogenesis and tumor metastasis.""","""['Erin M Bekes', 'Bernhard Schweighofer', 'Tatyana A Kupriyanova', 'Ewa Zajac', 'Veronica C Ardi', 'James P Quigley', 'Elena I Deryugina']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Human neutrophils uniquely release TIMP-free MMP-9 to provide a potent catalytic stimulator of angiogenesis.', 'Tissue-infiltrating neutrophils constitute the major in vivo source of angiogenesis-inducing MMP-9 in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Neutrophil MMP-9 proenzyme, unencumbered by TIMP-1, undergoes efficient activation in vivo and catalytically induces angiogenesis via a basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2)/FGFR-2 pathway.', 'Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors.', 'Tumor angiogenesis: MMP-mediated induction of intravasation- and metastasis-sustaining neovasculature.', 'Recent Insight about HE4 Role in Ovarian Cancer Oncogenesis.', 'Skin immunity in wound healing and cancer.', 'Neutrophil elastase: From mechanisms to therapeutic potential.', 'Systemic Inflammation Indices and Association with Prostate Cancer Survival in a Diverse Patient Cohort.', ""Prognostic implication of cuproptosis related genes associates with immunity in Ewing's sarcoma.""]"""

Thirty-two patients aged 54-76 years old were included. The results indicated that prostatectomy does not prevent normal psychological functioning, although there is a relationship between smoking and lower quality of life in these patients.  Introduction:   Different types of monotherapy for prostate cancer leads to impairment in urinary and sexual functions, but prostatectomy seems to have worse results in physical functioning when compared with other treatments. Nevertheless, patients report high quality of life (QOL) levels, even when there are comments about the impact of sexual dysfunction on psychological health. The objectives of this work were to analyze levels of QOL, marital adjustment (MA), and behavioral problems (BP) of patients submitted to prostatectomy.  Methods:   Thirty-two patients from 54 to 76 years of age who underwent radical prostatectomy were evaluated during their follow-up appointments with the medical staff at the urology department of a private medical school. QOL scores were obtained from the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument, short version. BP scores of patients younger than 60 years of age were assessed through the Adult Self-Report, whereas patients older than 60 years were assessed through the Older Adult Self-Report. MA scores were obtained by using the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test.  Results:   The patients reported relatively high levels of QOL and MA, along with low BPs. Marital support was associated with higher levels of QOL. BPs were associated with lower physical and total QOL scores. Smoking habits were associated with lower levels of MA, psychological health, and QOL. Erectile dysfunction was related to lower MA levels and lower QOL scores.

Genotyping of all 22 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in the KLK5, KLK6, KLK12, and KLK13 genes was performed in approximately 1,000 prostate cancer cases and 1,300 male controls from Australia. Data from any positive results were also accessed for 1,844 cases and 1,886 controls from a previously published prostate cancer genome-wide association study set from the United Kingdom. For one SNP in KLK12, rs3865443, there was evidence for association with prostate cancer risk of similar direction and magnitude in the replication set to that seen in the Australian cohort. We conducted genotyping of a further 309 prostate cancer cases, and combined analyses revealed an increased risk of prostate cancer for carriers of the rare homozygous genotype for rs3865443 (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.57; P = 0.018).

Immunohistochemistry, flow cytometric, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte assay were performed to assess the proportion and cytotoxicity of the T lymphocytes.  Results:   The IL-2 surface-modified MB49 cell vaccine inhibited tumor growth and extended the survival of the mice, and the vaccine-cured mice effectively resisted the second MB49 but not the RM-1 prostate cancer cell challenge. Furthermore, more cytotoxicity on the MB49 cells and more CD4-positive, CD8-positive T cells appeared in the vaccine-treated group.  Conclusion:   The results of our study have demonstrated that the human interleukin-2 surface-modified MB49 bladder cancer cell vaccine induced specific antitumor immunity and was efficient against metastatic bladder cancer.""","""['Xinji Zhang', 'Xiaojun Shi', 'Jinlong Li', 'Zhiming Hu', 'Fangfang Guo', 'Xiao Huang', 'Zhehuan Zhang', 'Pengyu Sun', 'Yuming Jing', 'Jimin Gao', 'Wanlong Tan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Development of a therapy against metastatic bladder cancer using an interleukin-2 surface-modified MB49 bladder cancer stem cells vaccine.', 'A novel therapeutic vaccine of mouse GM-CSF surface modified MB49 cells against metastatic bladder cancer.', 'Sequential administration of GM-CSF and IL-2 surface-modified MB49 cells vaccines against the metastatic bladder cancer.', 'Novel vaccines against M. tuberculosis.', 'Vesigenurtacel-L (HS-410) in the management of high-grade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.', 'PD-1 Blockade Overcomes Adaptive Immune Resistance in Treatment with Anchored-GM-CSF Bladder Cancer Cells Vaccine.', 'Combination immunotherapy with interleukin-2 surface-modified tumor cell vaccine and programmed death receptor-1 blockade against renal cell carcinoma.', 'A modified method by differential adhesion for enrichment of bladder cancer stem cells.', 'Future directions in bladder cancer immunotherapy: towards adaptive immunity.', 'Development of a therapy against metastatic bladder cancer using an interleukin-2 surface-modified MB49 bladder cancer stem cells vaccine.']"""

We have recently proposed new delivery systems to avoid ZOL accumulation into the bone, thus improving extra-skeletal bioavailability. In this work, we have compared the technological and anti-cancer features of either ZOL-containing self-assembly PEGylated nanoparticles (NPs) or ZOL-encapsulating PEGylated liposomes (LIPO-ZOL). ZOL-containing NPs showed superior technological characteristics in terms of mean diameter, size distribution, and ZOL encapsulation efficiency, compared to LIPO-ZOL. Moreover, the anti-cancer activity of NPs in nude mice xenografted with prostate cancer PC3 cells was higher than that one induced by LIPO-ZOL. In addition, NPs induced the complete remission of tumour xenografts and an increase of survival time higher than that one observed with LIPO-ZOL. It has also to be considered that PC3 tumour xenografts were almost completely resistant to the anti-cancer effects induced by free ZOL. Both nanotechnological products did not induce toxic effects not affecting the mice weight nor inducing deaths. Moreover, the histological examination of some vital organs such as liver, kidney and spleen did not find any changes in terms of necrotic effects or modifications in the inflammatory infiltrate. On the other hand, NPs but not LIPO-ZOL caused a statistically significant reduction of the tumour associated macrophages (TAM) in tumour xenografts. This effect was paralleled by a significant increase of both necrotic and apoptotic indexes. The effects of the NPs were also higher in terms of neo-angiogenesis inhibition. These results suggest the future preclinical development of ZOL-encapsulating NPs in the treatment of human cancer.""","""['Monica Marra', 'Giuseppina Salzano', 'Carlo Leonetti', 'Manuela Porru', 'Renato Franco', 'Silvia Zappavigna', 'Giuseppina Liguori', 'Gerardo Botti', 'Paolo Chieffi', 'Monica Lamberti', 'Giovanni Vitale', 'Alberto Abbruzzese', 'Maria Immacolata La Rotonda', 'Giuseppe De Rosa', 'Michele Caraglia']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biotechnol Adv""","""['Self-assembly nanoparticles for the delivery of bisphosphonates into tumors.', 'Nanoparticles for the delivery of zoledronic acid to prostate cancer cells: a comparative analysis through time lapse video-microscopy technique.', 'Nanotechnologies to use bisphosphonates as potent anticancer agents: the effects of zoledronic acid encapsulated into liposomes.', 'Zoledronic acid: an unending tale for an antiresorptive agent.', 'The backbone of progress--preclinical studies and innovations with zoledronic acid.', 'Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrative Analysis of Bulk RNA-Seq and Single-Cell RNA-Seq Unveils the Characteristics of the Immune Microenvironment and Prognosis Signature in Prostate Cancer.', 'Immunosuppressive cells in cancer: mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.', 'Hybrid Self-Assembling Nanoparticles Encapsulating Zoledronic Acid: A Strategy for Fostering Their Clinical Use.', 'Drug Delivery to the Bone Microenvironment Mediated by Exosomes: An Axiom or Enigma.']"""

Prognostic information is useful and aids treatment decisions. However, current nomograms based on clinical parameters alone have weak prognostic accuracy. Therefore, the identification of new prognostic serum biomarkers could be useful.  Objectives:   To assess if quantitative analysis of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) conditional knockout mouse proteome reveals significant prognostic biomarkers in mCRPC and to compare the accuracy of these biomarkers with known prognostic factors.  Design, setting, and participants:   Fifty-seven patients with mCRPC were evaluated retrospectively. Prognostic factors used in clinical nomograms were assessed from the records. New candidate biomarkers in patients' sera were derived using a cancer genetics-guided model we recently described, screening the murine Pten-dependent glycoproteome.  Measurements:   Quantification in patients' sera was performed by either mass spectrometry-based targeted proteomics or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Prognostic biomarkers for survival were identified based on Kaplan-Meier models. In a second step, random forest analysis was performed to identify a prognostic signature combined from the pooled data of known predictors and newly identified biomarkers.  Results and limitations:   With univariate analysis, 13 new significant prognostic factors for survival in the sera of mCRPC patients were found with a Bonferroni-corrected level of significance <5%. Random forest analysis revealed a five-factor predictor (thrombospondin 1; C-reactive protein; poliovirus receptor-related 1; ephrin-A5; and membrane metallo-endopeptidase) with an accuracy of 96% and 94% for 12- and 24-mo survival, respectively. This means that, in our dataset, the error was reduced by 15% compared to using the Halabi et al. nomogram. The retrospective nature of the work and absence of a validating dataset is the major limitation of this work.  Conclusions:   Analysis of the serum proteome in mCRPC patients based on our Pten conditional knockout model, combined with known prognostic factors, potentially improves accuracy of prognostic nomograms. These newly identified markers have to be validated in prospective studies.""","""['Martin Kälin', 'Igor Cima', 'Ralph Schiess', 'Niklaus Fankhauser', 'Tom Powles', 'Peter Wild', 'Arnoud Templeton', 'Thomas Cerny', 'Ruedi Aebersold', 'Wilhelm Krek', 'Silke Gillessen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prognostic Factors for Survival in Noncastrate Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Validation of the Glass Model and Development of a Novel Simplified Prognostic Model.', 'Ability of C-reactive protein to complement multiple prognostic classifiers in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'A rare castration-resistant progenitor cell population is highly enriched in Pten-null prostate tumours.', 'Biomarkers in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The utility of prostate-specific antigen in the management of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Serum protein profiling of lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers reveals alcohol consumption-mediated disruptions in early-stage cancer detection.', 'ADAM10-cleaved ephrin-A5 contributes to prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Identification of Lifestyle Behaviors Associated with Recurrence and Survival in Colorectal Cancer Patients Using Random Survival Forests.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Glycoproteomics and Prostate Cancer.', 'Membrane metalloendopeptidase suppresses prostate carcinogenesis by attenuating effects of gastrin-releasing peptide on stem/progenitor cells.']"""

This study aimed to investigate the different phenotypes of human various histological/pathological prostate stromal cells, and their role in tumor promotion.  Methods:   The different phenotypes of the human normal prostatic peripheral zonal primary stromal cells (NPPF), transitional zonal primary stromal cells (NPTF), and prostate cancer associated primary stromal cells (CAF) were examined with growth curves and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) assay. The different effects on prostate cancer cell line C4-2B by NPPF, NPTF, and CAF were examined with MTT assay and Annexin V-FITC assay. The gene expression of different histological/pathological prostate stromal cells was profiled by microarray and hierarchical cluster analysis.  Results:   The growth rate of NPPF, NPTF and CAF gradually increased, followed by decreasing apoptosis. In vitro stromal-C4-2B cell line co-culture models, the proliferation and apoptosis of C4-2B cell line were differently affected by human various histological/pathological prostate stromal cells. CAF showed the most powerful effect to C4-2B cell line, as opposed to a weakest effect of NPTF. Microarray and hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes of CAF and NPPF were less than NPPF and NPTF, or CAF and NPTF.

Ghrelin is expressed in a range of endometrial cancer tissues, while its cognate receptor, GHSR1a, is expressed in a small subset of normal and cancer tissues. Low to moderately invasive endometrial cancer cell lines were examined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, demonstrating that ghrelin axis mRNA and protein expression correlate with differentiation status of Ishikawa, HEC1B and KLE endometrial cancer cell lines.

We hypothesized that testosterone regulates components of prostate tight junctions which serve as a barrier to inflammation, thus providing a connection between age- and treatment-associated testosterone declines and prostatic pathology. We examined the expression and distribution of tight junction proteins in prostate biospecimens from mouse models and a clinical study of chemical castration, using transcript profiling, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. We determined that low serum testosterone is associated with reduced transcript and protein levels of Claudin 4 and Claudin 8, resulting in defective tight junction ultrastructure in benign prostate glands. Expression of Claudin 4 and Claudin 8 was negatively correlated with the mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate caused by testosterone deprivation. Testosterone suppression also induced an autoimmune humoral response directed toward prostatic proteins. Testosterone supplementation in castrate mice resulted in re-expression of tight junction components in prostate epithelium and significantly reduced prostate inflammatory cell numbers. These data demonstrate that tight junction architecture in the prostate is related to changes in serum testosterone levels, and identify an androgen-regulated mechanism that potentially contributes to the development of prostate inflammation and consequent pathology.""","""['Jing Meng', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Funda Vakar-Lopez', 'Bruce Montgomery', 'Larry True', 'Peter S Nelson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Expression patterns of claudin family of tight-junction proteins in the mouse prostate.', 'Heterogeneity in expression and subcellular localization of tight junction proteins, claudin-10 and -15, examined by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy.', 'Claudin-1 is not restricted to tight junctions in the rat epididymis.', 'Ruffles and spikes: Control of tight junction morphology and permeability by claudins.', 'Tight junctions of the proximal tubule and their channel proteins.', ""The role of testosterone in men's health: is it time for a new approach?"", 'The Role of ZIP9 and Androgen Receptor in the Establishment of Tight Junctions between Adult Rat Sertoli Cells.', 'Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals Changes in the Intestinal Microbiome, Transcriptome, and Methylome in a Rat Model of Chronic Non-bacterial Prostatitis: Indications for the Existence of the Gut-Prostate Axis.', 'Tetrapeptides Modelled to the Androgen Binding Site of ZIP9 Stimulate Expression of Tight Junction Proteins and Tight Junction Formation in Sertoli Cells.', 'Host Sex Steroids Interact With Virus Infection: New Insights Into Sex Disparity in Infectious Diseases.']"""

Castration produces involution of the prostate to a reversible basal state, and as the majority of prostate cancers also have a luminal phenotype, drug-induced castration is a front line therapy. It has therefore been assumed that the tumor arises from transformation of a luminal progenitor cell. Here, we demonstrate that a minority basal ""cancer stem cell"" (CSC) population persists in primary human prostate cancers, as in normal prostate, serving as a reservoir for tumor recurrence after castration therapy. While the CSCs exhibit a degree of phenotypic fluidity from different patients, the tumor-initiating cells in immunocompromised mice express basal markers (such as p63), but do not express androgen receptor (AR) or markers of luminal differentiation (PSA, PAP) when freshly fractionated from human tissues or following culture in vitro. Estrogen receptors α and β and AR are transcriptionally active in the transit amplifying (TA) cell (the progeny of SC). However, AR protein is consistently undetectable in TA cells. The prostate-specific TMPRSS2 gene, while upregulated by AR activity in luminal cells, is also transcribed in basal populations, confirming that AR acts as an expression modulator. Selected cells with basal phenotypes are tumor initiating, but the resultant tumors are phenotypically intermediate, with focal expression of AR, AMACR, and p63.

We previously reported that direct injection of antisense (AS) CK2α phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PTO) into xenograft prostate tumors in mice significantly reduced tumor size. Downregulation of CK2α in tumor cells in vivo appeared to result in overexpression of CK2α' protein. This suggested that in cancer cells downregulation of CK2α might be compensated by CK2α' in vivo, prompting us to design a bispecific (bs) AS PTO (bs-AS-CK2) targeting both catalytic subunits. bs-AS-CK2 reduced CK2α and α' protein expression, decreased cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in cultured cells. Biodistribution studies of administered bs-AS-CK2 oligonucleotide demonstrated its presence in orthotopic prostate xenograft tumors. High dose injections of bs-AS-CK2 resulted in no damage to normal liver or prostate, but induced extensive cell death in tumor tissue. Intraperitoneal treatment with bs-AS-CK2 PTO decreased orthotopic tumor size and downregulated both CK2 mRNA and protein expression. Tumor reduction was accomplished using remarkably low doses and was improved by dividing the dose using a multi-day schedule. Decreased expression of the key signaling pathway proteins NF-κB p65 and AKT was also observed.

Methods:   There were 81, 69, and 61 men visited at home prior to treatment (T1), 3 months later (T2), and 1 year after the first visit (T3), respectively. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to examine adjustment over time. Multiple regressions determined whether the predictors were associated with the adjustment domains.  Results:   Sexual relationship deteriorated and social environment improved between T1 and T2. Between T1 and T3, sexual, domestic, and family relationships deteriorated, whereas social environment improved. Mood disturbance, sense of coherence, couple cohesion, and couple adaptability were predictors of psychological, vocational, and domestic domains at T1. At T2, mood disturbance and sexual functioning were predictors of healthcare, vocational, social, psychological, and family domains. At T3, couple cohesion and adaptability and urinary functioning were predictors to vocational, domestic, social, and psychological adjustment.  Conclusions:   During the first year of prostate cancer, men showed deterioration in sexual, close-family, and extended-family relationship domains.

In a previous study we found that in prostate cancer cells, the G(q)PCR of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) induces apoptosis by reducing the PKC-dependent AKT activity and elevating JNK phosphorylation. Because it was thought that G(q)PCRs mainly induce activation of AKT, we first undertook to examine how general this phenomenon is. In a screen of 21 cell lines we found that PKC activation results in the reduction of AKT activity, which correlates nicely with JNK activation and in some cases with apoptosis. To understand further the signaling pathways involved in this stimulation, we studied in detail SVOG-4O and αT3-1 cells. We found that prostaglandin F2α and GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) indeed induce significant Gα(q)- and PKC-dependent apoptosis in these cells. This is mediated by two signaling branches downstream of PKC, which converge at the level of MLK3 upstream of JNK.

Transrectal gray-scale ultrasonography guided prostate biopsy sampling is the method for diagnosing prostate cancer (PC) in patients with an increased prostate specific antigen level and/or abnormal digital rectal examination. Several imaging strategies have been proposed to optimize the diagnostic value of biopsy sampling, although at the first biopsy nearly 10-30% of PC still remains undiagnosed. This study compares the PC detection rate when employing Colour Doppler ultransongraphy with or without the injection of SonoVue™ microbubble contrast agent, versus the transrectal ultrasongraphy-guided systematic biopsy sampling. The limited accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the additional cost of using the contrast agent do not justify its routine application in PC detection.  Objective:   • To compare prostate cancer (PC) detection rate employing colour Doppler ultrasonography with or without SonoVue™ contrast agent with transrectal ultrasonography-guided systematic biopsy sampling.  Patients and methods:   • A total of 300 patients with negative digital rectal examination and transrectal grey-scale ultrasonography, with PSA values ranging between 2.5 and 9.9 ng/mL, were randomized into three groups: 100 patients (group A) underwent transrectal ultrasonography-guided systematic bioptic sampling; 100 patients (group B) underwent colour Doppler ultrasonography, and 100 patients (group C) underwent colour Doppler ultrasonography before and during the injection of SonoVue™. • Contrast-enhanced targeted biopsies were sampled into hypervascularized areas of peripheral, transitional, apical or anterior prostate zones. • All the patients included in Groups B and C underwent a further 13 systematic prostate biopsies. The cancer detection rate was calculated for each group.  Results:   • In 88 (29.3%) patients a histological diagnosis of PC was made, whereas 22 (7.4%) patients were diagnosed with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical small acinar proliferation. • No significant differences were found among the three groups for cancer detection rate (P= 0.329). • Additionally, low sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of colour Doppler with or without SonoVue™ contrast agent were found.  Conclusions:   • Prostate cancer detection rate does not significantly improve with the use of colour Doppler ultrasonography with or without SonoVue™. • Although no collateral effects have been highlighted, the combined use of colour Doppler ultrasonography and SonoVue™ determines adjunctive costs and increases the mean time for taking a single prostate biopsy.""","""['Gianluigi Taverna', 'Giovanni Morandi', 'Mauro Seveso', 'Guido Giusti', 'Alessio Benetti', 'Piergiuseppe Colombo', 'Francesco Minuti', 'Fabio Grizzi', 'Pierpaolo Graziotti']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography for the detection of diffuse prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer detection in men with prostate specific antigen 4 to 10 ng/ml using a combined approach of contrast enhanced color Doppler targeted and systematic biopsy.', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with contrast-tuned imaging technology for the detection of prostate cancer: comparison with conventional ultrasonography.', 'Enhanced transrectal ultrasound modalities in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Safety and morbidity of first and repeat transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsies: results of a prospective European prostate cancer detection study.', 'Novel non-MRI imaging techniques for primary diagnosis of prostate cancer: micro-ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, elastography, multiparametric ultrasound, and PSMA PET/CT.', 'Application of Multiple Ultrasonic Techniques in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Optimizing biopsy strategy for prostate cancer: Bayesian framework of network meta-analysis and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model for diagnostic accuracy.', 'Role of Transrectal Ultrasound Elastography in the Diagnosis of Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Optimal biopsy strategy for prostate cancer detection by performing a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.']"""

We found that 11 of the 33 SNP were significantly associated with PCa risk in Chinese men (P < 0.05). The reported risk alleles were associated with increased risk for PCa, with allelic odds ratios ranging from 1.12 to 1.44.

In this study we perform in vivo animal experiments on implanted prostatic tumours in mice to measure temperature distribution in the tumour during magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia. Temperature elevations are induced by a commercially available ferrofluid injected via a single injection to the centre of the tumour, when the tumour is subject to an alternating magnetic field. Temperature mapping in the tumours during magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia has demonstrated the feasibility of elevating tumour temperatures higher than 50°C using only 0.1 cm(3) ferrofluid injected in the tumour under a relatively low magnetic field (3 kA/m). Detailed 3-D nanoparticle concentration distribution is quantified using a high-resolution microCT imaging system. The calculated nanoparticle distribution volume based on the microCT scans is useful to analyse nanoparticle deposition in the tumours. Slower ferrofluid infusion rates result in smaller nanoparticle distribution volumes in the tumours. Nanoparticles are more confined in the vicinity of the injection site with slower infusion rates, causing higher temperature elevations in the tumours. The increase in the nanoparticle distribution volume in the tumour group after the heating from that in the tumour group without heating suggests possible nanoparticle re-distribution in the tumours during the heating.""","""['Anilchandra Attaluri', 'Ronghui Ma', 'Yun Qiu', 'Wei Li', 'Liang Zhu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['Identification of infusion strategy for achieving repeatable nanoparticle distribution and quantification of thermal dosage using micro-CT Hounsfield unit in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia.', 'Effects of magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) on C3H mammary carcinoma in vivo.', 'Real-time infrared thermography detection of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia in a murine model under a non-uniform field configuration.', 'Magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer hyperthermia using magnetic nanoparticles.', 'A 3D Approach Using a Control Algorithm to Minimize the Effects on the Healthy Tissue in the Hyperthermia for Cancer Treatment.', 'Design of a temperature-feedback controlled automated magnetic hyperthermia therapy device.', 'Current Challenges in Image-Guided Magnetic Hyperthermia Therapy for Liver Cancer.', 'Development of 3D Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)/Maghemite (ϒ-Fe2O3) Using Ultra-Hard and Tough (UHT) Bio-Resin for Soft Tissue Engineering.', 'Examining the effect of ions and proteins on the heat dissipation of iron oxide nanocrystals.']"""

Average standardized incidence and mortality rates for the prostate cancer were 33.57 and 11.86 respectively. Standardized incidence rates of prostate cancer steadily increased from 29.34 per 100,000 in 1999 to 36.86 per 100,000 in 2005. In the observed period, the mortality rates significantly increased in the age groups 50-59 (y = 2.77+0.42x, p = 0.015), 70-79 (y = 61.92+10.70x, p = 0.000) and 80+ (y = 183.08+19.99x, p = 0.000). The average annual percentage of changes (AAPC) was the highest (7.2%) for the 70-79 age group, the lowest (0.1%) for the youngest group (< or = 50), and 5% for the total. The increase of prostate cancer incidence and mortality during the observed period in Belgrade population indicate urgent need for Serbian health professionals to adopt existing evidence-based cancer control and preventive measures. A national policy including prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening should be considered.""","""['Janko Janković', 'Sandra Sipetić']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Coll Antropol""","""['Quebec prostate cancer mortality dropped in 1996.', 'Prostate cancer screening (II): is prostate cancer a public health problem?

Recently, sarcosine was reported to be highly increased during prostate cancer progression, and exogenous sarcosine induces an invasive phenotype in benign prostate epithelial cells. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of sarcosine on HER2/neu expression in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP (androgen dependent), PC-3 and DU145 (both androgen independent). Relative amounts of HER2/neu and androgen receptor (AR) transcripts were determined using RT-qPCR. Total expression of HER2/neu was confirmed by Western blot (WB). HER2/neu protein on the surface of living LNCaP cells was visualized by confocal microscopy using a HER2/neu-specific fluorescent probe. Exposure of LNCaP cells to 50 μM sarcosine for 24 h resulted in a 58% increase of the HER2/neu mRNA level (P < 0.001) indicating that sarcosine effects HER2/neu expression on the level of transcription. Control experiments with alanine, an isomer of sarcosine, showed no significant effect on HER2/neu transcription. The upregulation of HER2/neu mRNA preceded the corresponding increment of the protein level after the 48-h exposure to sarcosine as shown by WB and confocal microscopy. Interestingly, sarcosine had no effect on the activated (phosphorylated) form of HER2/neu. No significant change in AR expression was observed after exposure to sarcosine. This is the first report indicating that sarcosine is involved in the regulation of the oncoprotein HER2/neu. Thus, sarcosine may induce prostate cancer progression by increased HER2/neu expression.

In this study we demonstrate that elevated IKKα expression in murine epidermis increases the malignancy potential of skin tumors. We describe the generation of transgenic mice overexpressing IKKα in the basal, proliferative layer of the epidermis and in the outer root sheath of hair follicles. The epidermis of K5-IKKα transgenic animals shows several alterations such as hyperproliferation, mislocalized expression of integrin-α6 and downregulation of the tumor suppressor maspin. Treatment of the back skin of mice with the mitogenic agent 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate causes in transgenic mice the appearance of different preneoplastic changes such as epidermal atypia with loss of cell polarity and altered epidermal tissue architecture, while in wild type littermates this treatment only leads to the development of benign epidermal hyperplasia. Moreover, in skin carcinogenesis assays, transgenic mice carrying active Ha-ras (K5-IKKα-Tg.AC mice) develop invasive tumors, instead of the benign papillomas arising in wild type-Tg-AC mice also bearing an active Ha-ras. Therefore we provide evidence for a tumor promoter role of IKKα in skin cancer, similarly to what occurs in other neoplasias, including hepatocarcinomas and breast, prostate and colorectal cancer. The altered expression of cyclin D1, maspin and integrin-α6 in skin of transgenic mice provides, at least in part, the molecular bases for the increased malignant potential found in the K5-IKKα skin tumors.""","""['Josefa P Alameda', 'Rodolfo Moreno-Maldonado', 'M Jesús Fernández-Aceñero', 'Manuel Navarro', 'Angustias Page', 'José L Jorcano', 'Ana Bravo', 'Ángel Ramírez', 'M Llanos Casanova']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Deciphering the role of nuclear and cytoplasmic IKKα in skin cancer.', 'Overexpression of protein kinase C-alpha in the epidermis of transgenic mice results in striking alterations in phorbol ester-induced inflammation and COX-2, MIP-2 and TNF-alpha expression but not tumor promotion.', 'Early epidermal destruction with subsequent epidermal hyperplasia is a unique feature of the papilloma-independent squamous cell carcinoma phenotype in PKCepsilon overexpressing transgenic mice.', 'Critical role of IkappaB kinase alpha in embryonic skin development and skin carcinogenesis.', 'IKKalpha, a critical regulator of epidermal differentiation and a suppressor of skin cancer.', 'IKKα Induces Epithelial-Mesenchymal Changes in Mouse Skin Carcinoma Cells That Can Be Partially Reversed by Apigenin.', 'CYLD Inhibits the Development of Skin Squamous Cell Tumors in Immunocompetent Mice.', 'IKKα regulates the stratification and differentiation of the epidermis: implications for skin cancer development.', 'Deciphering the role of nuclear and cytoplasmic IKKα in skin cancer.', 'Opposed expression of IKKα: loss in keratinizing carcinomas and gain in non-keratinizing carcinomas.']"""

While most oligos contain a single mRNA binding site, our laboratory has developed bispecifics directed towards two. Previous work has determined that when oligos are used to suppress the expression of individual proteins in highly regulated physiologic processes, additional proteins can be affected. These non-targeted (non-specific effects) regulators can compensate for proteins specifically targeted, reverse the intended effect and promote tumor growth. To evaluate specific and compensatory non-specific effects on growth inhibition of LNCaP cells employing mono- and bispecific oligos directed against BCL-2, LNCaP cells were incubated in the presence of oligos specifically directed against BCL-2 [the second binding site was directed against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)] and compared to lipofectin containing controls. Significant, but comparable, growth inhibition was produced by mono- and bispecific forms. Employing RT-PCR to determine BCL-2 expression, mRNA suppression approached 100% for each oligo type: monospecific MR4 (directed only against BCL-2), 100%; and bispecifics MR24 and MR42, 86% and 100% respectively. Based upon inhibition of in vivo growth and BCL-2 expression, bispecific antisense oligos directed against EGFR and BCL-2 mRNAs are at least as effective as a monospecific directed towards BCL-2. To identify a compensatory response to evade apoptosis in the presence of BCL-2 suppression, levels of mRNA encoding non-targeted BAX, caspase-3 and clusterin were evaluated. We initially found that specific suppression of the apoptosis inhibitor BCL-2 in LNCaP cells does not affect (non-targeted) BAX expression and (non-targeted) caspase-3 expression was suppressed.

MiR-1 has been found down-regulated in lung, colon, and prostate cancer.  Objectives:   In this study, we investigated the possible role of miR-1 in thyroid carcinogenesis.  Design:   We have analyzed miR-1 expression in a panel of thyroid neoplasias including benign and malignant lesions and searched for miR-1 targets.  Results:   Our results show that miR-1 expression is drastically down-regulated in thyroid adenomas and carcinomas in comparison with normal thyroid tissue. Interestingly, miR-1 down-regulation was also found in thyroid hyperproliferative nonneoplastic lesions such as goiters. We identified the CCND2, coding for the cyclin D2 (CCND2) protein that favors the G1/S transition, CXCR4, and SDF-1α genes, coding for the receptor for the stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCL12 chemokine and its ligand SDF-1/CXCL12, respectively, as miR-1 targets. An inverse correlation was found between miR-1 expression and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and SDF-1α protein levels in papillary and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Consistent with a role of the CCND2 protein in cell proliferation and CXCR4 and SDF-1α proteins in cell invasion and metastasis, functional studies demonstrate that miR-1 is able to inhibit thyroid carcinoma cell proliferation and migration.

Methods:   From 1994 through 2001, we randomly assigned 1979 eligible patients with stage T1b, T1c, T2a, or T2b prostate adenocarcinoma and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 20 ng per milliliter or less to radiotherapy alone (992 patients) or radiotherapy with 4 months of total androgen suppression starting 2 months before radiotherapy (radiotherapy plus short-term ADT, 987 patients). The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included disease-specific mortality, distant metastases, biochemical failure (an increasing level of PSA), and the rate of positive findings on repeat prostate biopsy at 2 years.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 9.1 years. The 10-year rate of overall survival was 62% among patients receiving radiotherapy plus short-term ADT (the combined-therapy group), as compared with 57% among patients receiving radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death with radiotherapy alone, 1.17; P=0.03). The addition of short-term ADT was associated with a decrease in the 10-year disease-specific mortality from 8% to 4% (hazard ratio for radiotherapy alone, 1.87; P=0.001). Biochemical failure, distant metastases, and the rate of positive findings on repeat prostate biopsy at 2 years were significantly improved with radiotherapy plus short-term ADT. Acute and late radiation-induced toxic effects were similar in the two groups. The incidence of grade 3 or higher hormone-related toxic effects was less than 5%. Reanalysis according to risk showed reductions in overall and disease-specific mortality primarily among intermediate-risk patients, with no significant reductions among low-risk patients.  Conclusions:   Among patients with stage T1b, T1c, T2a, or T2b prostate adenocarcinoma and a PSA level of 20 ng per milliliter or less, the use of short-term ADT for 4 months before and during radiotherapy was associated with significantly decreased disease-specific mortality and increased overall survival.

Of concern are possible disparities in uptake of CRC screening between white and African American men. The goal of this study was to assess for disparities in uptake of CRC screening among men participating in a high-risk prostate cancer clinic. If present, such disparities could support hypotheses for further research examining racial differences in awareness and patient preferences in undergoing CRC screening.  Methods:   Baseline data on a racially diverse cohort of men aged 50 to 69 years at increased risk of prostate cancer collected via the Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Program at Fox Chase Cancer Center were analyzed. Predictors of uptake of CRC screening were assessed using multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   Compared with whites, African American men had statistically significantly lower uptake of fecal occult blood testing (African American 49.0% vs white 60.7%, P = .035), lower endoscopy (African American 44.1% vs white 58.5%, P = .011), and any CRC screening (African American 66.2% vs white 76.3%, P = .053).

The objective of this study was to evaluate a commonly used PSA failure definition in a multinational, multi-institutional study after monotherapy with prostate brachytherapy.  Methods:   Participants were selected from 2919 men who underwent permanent prostate brachytherapy at the University Medical Center Utrecht, Princess Margaret Hospital, or Seattle Prostate Institute between 1998 and 2006. Inclusion required not having received androgen-deprivation therapy and having at least 30 months of follow-up. Failure was defined as any post-treatment use of hormone therapy, clinical relapse, or prostogram-defined biochemical (PSA) failure. Cases in which the nomogram predicted biochemical failure were evaluated at each institution to verify biochemical status over time and the actual clinical outcome at 5 years.  Results:   The median follow-up for the 1816 patients was 5.2 years. Concordance between the prostogram-predicted and actual outcomes, as measured by the Harrell c statistic, was 0.655 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.536-0.774; P = .010) for the Princess Margaret group, 0.493 (95% CI, 0.259-0.648; P = .955) for the Seattle group, and 0.696 (95% CI, 0.648-0.744, P < .001) for the Utrecht group. The overall mean difference in biochemical recurrence-free survival at 5 years between actual outcomes and prostogram-defined outcomes was 9.2% (95% CI, 7.7%-10.6%). The total numbers of prostogram-defined and actual biochemical failures were 312 and 157, respectively (P = .001).  Conclusions:   The widely used prostogram could not adequately distinguish a benign PSA bounce from a biochemical recurrence after prostate brachytherapy and could not be used to counsel patients about their predicted outcomes after treatment.

Area under the curve (AUC) [corrected] analyses tested the criteria for predicting unfavorable PCa. Then, the patients were stratified according to the cutoff age of 70 years. Multivariate analyses were used to test the role of age in predicting unfavorable PCa.  Results:   The rate of unfavorable PCa characteristics was between 24% and 27.8%. In the van den Bergh et al population, after age 70 years, the rate of unfavorable PCa characteristics was 41% compared with 23.2% and 24.1% in patients in the previous age tertiles (ages ≤ 63 years and 63.1 to 69 years, respectively).

Results:   We observed a significantly increased risk of abnormal suspicious TVU results for seven SNPs on 9p22, with odds ratios between 1.68 (95% CI: 1.04-2.72) for rs4961501 and 2.10 (95% CI: 1.31-3.38) for rs12379183. Associations were restricted to abnormal suspicious findings at the first TVU screen. We did not observe an association between 9p22 SNPs and CA-125 levels.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that 9p22 SNPs, which were found to be associated with decreased risk of ovarian cancer in a recent GWAS, are associated with sonographically detectable ovarian abnormalities. Our results corroborate the relevance of the 9p22 locus for ovarian biology. Further studies are required to understand the complex relationship between screening abnormalities and ovarian carcinogenesis and to evaluate whether this locus can influence the risk stratification of ovarian cancer screening.""","""['Nicolas Wentzensen', 'Amanda Black', 'Kevin Jacobs', 'Hannah P Yang', 'Christine D Berg', 'Neil Caporaso', 'Ulrike Peters', 'Lawrence Ragard', 'Saundra S Buys', 'Stephen Chanock', 'Patricia Hartge']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Functional Analysis and Fine Mapping of the 9p22.2 Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility Locus.', 'Ovarian cancer screening in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial: findings from the initial screen of a randomized trial.', 'Genetic variation in innate immunity and inflammation pathways associated with lung cancer risk.', 'The role of transvaginal ultrasound in screening for ovarian cancer.', 'Screening for Ovarian Cancer: Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Basonuclin-2 regulates extracellular matrix production and degradation.', 'Functional Analysis and Fine Mapping of the 9p22.2 Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility Locus.', 'The PLCO Biorepository: Creating, Maintaining, and Administering a Unique Biospecimen Resource.', 'Genome-wide investigation of regional blood-based DNA methylation adjusted for complete blood counts implicates BNC2 in ovarian cancer.', 'BRCA mutation frequency and patterns of treatment response in BRCA mutation-positive women with ovarian cancer: a report from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study Group.']"""

Forced expression of the enzyme in mice prostates is associated with matrix degradation, invasive growth, and prostate cancer progression. Conversely, hepsin overexpression in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines was reported to induce cell cycle arrest and reduction of invasive growth in vitro. We used a system for doxycycline (dox)-inducible target gene expression in metastasis-derived PC3 cells to analyze the effects of hepsin in a quantitative manner. Loss of viability and adhesion correlated with hepsin expression levels during anchorage-dependent but not anchorage-independent growth. Full expression of hepsin led to cell death and detachment and was specifically associated with reduced phosphorylation of AKT at Ser(473), which was restored by growth on matrix derived from RWPE1 normal prostatic epithelial cells. In the chorioallantoic membrane xenograft model, hepsin overexpression in PC3 cells reduced the viability of tumors but did not suppress invasive growth. The data presented here provide evidence that elevated levels of hepsin interfere with cell adhesion and viability in the background of prostate cancer as well as other tissue types, the details of which depend on the microenvironment provided.

Objective:   To quantify how often throughout adulthood clinically significant changes occur in cancer family history that would result in recommendations for earlier or intense screening.  Design and setting:   Descriptive study examining baseline and follow-up family history data from participants in the Cancer Genetics Network (CGN), a US national population-based cancer registry, between 1999 and 2009.  Participants:   Adults with a personal history, family history, or both of cancer enrolled in the CGN through population-based cancer registries. Retrospective colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer screening-specific analyses included 9861, 2547, and 1817 participants, respectively; prospective analyses included 1533, 617, and 163 participants, respectively. Median follow-up was 8 years (range, 0-11 years). Screening-specific analyses excluded participants with the cancer of interest.  Main outcome measures:   Percentage of individuals with clinically significant family histories and rate of change over 2 periods: (1) retrospectively, from birth until CGN enrollment and (2) prospectively, from enrollment to last follow-up.  Results:   Retrospective analysis revealed that the percentages of participants who met criteria for high-risk screening based on family history at ages 30 and 50 years, respectively, were as follows: for colorectal cancer, 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8%-2.4%) and 7.1% (95% CI, 6.5%-7.6%); for breast cancer, 7.2% (95% CI, 6.1%-8.4%) and 11.4% (95% CI, 10.0%-12.8%); and for prostate cancer, 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5%-1.4%) and 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.7%). In prospective analysis, the numbers of participants who newly met criteria for high-risk screening based on family history per 100 persons followed up for 20 years were 2 (95% CI, 0-7) for colorectal cancer, 6 (95% CI, 2-13) for breast cancer, and 8 (95% CI, 3-16) for prostate cancer. The rate of change in cancer family history was similar for colorectal and breast cancer between the 2 analyses.

In this study, the antitumor activity of PSMA ADC was evaluated against a panel of prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and in a novel in vivo model of taxane-refractory human prostate cancer. In vitro cell killing was efficient for cells with abundant PSMA expression (>10(5) molecules/cell; IC(50) ≤ 0.022 nmol/L) and 1,000-fold less efficient for cells with undetectable PSMA (IC(50) > 30 nmol/L). Intermediate potency (IC(50) = 0.80 nmol/L) was observed for cells with approximately 10(4) molecules of PSMA per cell, indicating a threshold PSMA level for selective cell killing. Similar in vitro activity was observed against androgen-dependent and -independent cells that had abundant PSMA expression. In vitro activity of PSMA ADC was also dependent on internalization and proper N-glycosylation/folding of PSMA. In contrast, less potent and nonselective cytotoxic activity was observed for a control ADC, free monomethylauristatin E, and other microtubule inhibitors. PSMA ADC showed high in vivo activity in treating xenograft tumors that had progressed following an initial course of docetaxel therapy, including tumors that were large (>700 mm(3)) before treatment with PSMA ADC.

Methods:   Phantom measurements were performed to assess the quantitative impact on image quality. A phantom was set up with and without the flat couch insert in place, and measurements of image uniformity and signal to noise were made. To assess clinical impact, six patients with pelvic cancer were recruited and scanned on both couch types. The image quality of pairs of scans was assessed by two consultant radiologists.  Results:   The use of the flat couch insert led to a drop in image signal to noise of approximately 14%. Uniformity in the anteroposterior direction was affected the most, with little change in right-to-left and feet-to-head directions. All six patients were successfully scanned on the flat couch, although one patient had to be positioned with their arms by their sides. The image quality scores showed no statistically significant change between scans with and without the flat couch in place.  Conclusion:   Although the quantitative performance of the coil is affected by the integration of a flat couch top, there is no discernible deterioration of diagnostic image quality, as assessed by two consultant radiologists.

From 1992 to 2004, distant-stage breast cancer incidence rates remained essentially constant among both AA and NHW women, though rates were 30-90% higher among AA women throughout. NHW men and women experienced declines in distant-stage colorectal cancer incidence rates [APC = -1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.3, -0.9], but AA men and women did not. Distant-stage prostate cancer incidence rates declined for both AA (APC = -5.8, 95% CI -7.9, -3.8) and NHW (APC = -5.1, 95% CI -6.7, -3.4). Despite now having nearly equal mammography screening rates, the persistent breast cancer disparity observed among AAs compared to NHWs may be due to the greater susceptibility of AAs to more aggressive tumors, particularly hormone-receptor-negative disease, which is more difficult to detect by mammography. For colorectal cancer, greater utilization of screening tests among NHWs vs. AAs is likely a primary contributor to the observed widening disparity.

Previously, using a gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry (IHC) screen, we identified TRPS-1 as a highly prevalent gene in breast cancer (BC), expressed in >90% of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)(+) and ERα(-) BC subtypes. TRPS-1 was also shown to be expressed in prostate cancer where it was shown to play a proapoptotic function during androgen withdrawal possibly through regulating antioxidant metabolism. The role of TRPS-1 and its prognostic significance in hormone-dependent and hormone-independent BC however is not known. In this study, we developed a new quantitative IHC (qIHC) method to further study TRPS-1 as a marker and possible prognostic indicator in BC. By using this method, a quantitative parameter for TRPS-1 expression called a quick score (QS) was derived from the measured labeling index and mean optical density after IHC and applied to a set of 152 stage II/III BC patients from 1993 to 2006 who did not receive preoperative chemotherapy. Associations between QS and tumor characteristics were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. A wide range of TRPS-1 QS was found among the sample set with higher TRPS-1 QS significantly associated with tumor ERα (p = 0.023 for QS and p = 0.028 for Allred score), progesterone receptor (p = 0.009), and GATA-3 (p < 0.0001). TRPS-1 QS was also positively associated with HER2 status (p = 0.026). Further analysis of different ductal structures in ten BC cases revealed that TRPS-1 expression was expressed at low levels in the remaining normal ducts and in areas of usual ductal hyperplasia but showed marked increase in expression in ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma lesions in the tissue. An analysis of TRPS-1 expression in association with overall survival in the 152 stage II/III sample set also revealed that TRPS-1 QS (≥4.0) was significantly associated with improved survival (p = 0.0165). Patients with TRPS-1 QS <4 had a hazard ratio of 2 (p = 0.019) after univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis. In summary, this new qIHC approach was found to reveal critical differences in TRPS-1 expression in primary BC samples and found that it is a promising prognostic marker that should be further evaluated as a possible tumor suppressor gene facilitating improved survival in different subtypes of BC.""","""['Jie Qing Chen', 'Jennifer Litton', 'Li Xiao', 'Hua-Zhong Zhang', 'Carla L Warneke', 'Yun Wu', 'Xiaoyun Shen', 'Sheng Wu', 'Aysegul Sahin', 'Ruth Katz', 'Melissa Bondy', 'Gabriel Hortobagyi', 'Neil L Berinstein', 'James L Murray', 'Laszlo Radvanyi']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Prognostic value of the trichorhinophalangeal syndrome-1 (TRPS-1), a GATA family transcription factor, in early-stage breast cancer.', 'Expression and relevance of TRPS-1: a new GATA transcription factor in breast cancer.', 'Association of TRPS1 gene with different EMT markers in ERα-positive and ERα-negative breast cancer.', 'Roles of trichorhinophalangeal syndrome-1 gene in normal breast development and breast cancer.', 'Expression of YES-associated protein (YAP) and its clinical significance in breast cancer tissues.', 'TRPS1 modulates chromatin accessibility to regulate estrogen receptor (ER) binding and ER target gene expression in luminal breast cancer cells.', 'Deficiency of Mineralization-Regulating Transcription Factor Trps1 Compromises Quality of Dental Tissues and Increases Susceptibility to Dental Caries.', 'Inference of phenotype-relevant transcriptional regulatory networks elucidates cancer type-specific regulatory mechanisms in a pan-cancer study.', 'TRPS1 Confers Multidrug Resistance of Breast Cancer Cells by Regulating BCRP Expression.', 'Invasive breast cancer over four decades reveals persisting poor metastatic outcomes in treatment resistant subgroup - the ""ATRESS"" phenomenon.']"""

Of the 427 patients, 73 (17%) were patients with primary neurologic-based tumor, 71 (16%) were patients with hematologic-based tumors, 48 (11%) were sarcoma patients, 35 (8%) were gastrointestinal tumor patients, 27 (6%) were head and neck tumor patients, 25 (6%) were prostate and bladder cancer patients, 24 (6%) were lung cancer patients, 22 (5%) were melanoma patients, 20 (5%) were breast cancer patients, 15 (4%) were renal cancer patients, 14 (3%) were gynecologic cancer patients, and 53 (12%) were patients with other types of cancer. Of the 427 patients admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation at MD Anderson Cancer Center, 324 (76%) were discharged home, 72 (17%) went back to acute care service, 15 (4%) were sent to a skilled nursing facility, 9 (2%) were discharged to palliative care, and 5 (1%) were discharged to a long-term acute care facility.  Conclusions:   An active inpatient rehabilitation unit within a national comprehensive cancer center receives referrals from patients with a wide variety of tumor types and is able to successfully discharge home 76% of its patients.""","""['Ki Y Shin', 'Ying Guo', 'Benedict Konzen', 'Jack Fu', 'Rajesh Yadav', 'Eduardo Bruera']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Phys Med Rehabil""","""['Hospital-acquired symptomatic urinary tract infection in patients admitted to an academic stroke center affects discharge disposition.', 'Incidence of and risk factors for transferring cancer patients from rehabilitation to acute care units.', 'Characterization of Cancer Patients in Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities: A Retrospective Cohort Study.', 'Inpatient rehabilitation of patients with cancer: efficacy and treatment considerations.', 'A Guide to Inpatient Cancer Rehabilitation: Focusing on Patient Selection and Evidence-Based Outcomes.', 'Palliative Rehabilitation in Acute Inpatient Rehabilitation: Prognostic Factors and Functional Outcomes in Patients with Cancer.', 'Functional outcomes of cancer patients in an acute inpatient setting at King Fahad Medical City.', 'Predictors of Acute Transfer and Mortality Within 6 Months From Admission to an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility for Patients With Brain Tumors.', 'Medical Complications and Prognostic Factors for Medically Unstable Conditions During Acute Inpatient Cancer Rehabilitation.', ""Women's Experiences After Ovarian Cancer Surgery: Distress, Uncertainty, and the Need for Occupational Therapy.""]"""

Methods:   Clinical and laboratory data of 282 prostate cancer patients, who underwent radical prostatectomy, were supplied from three different institutions in Bulgaria. Preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) values, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score and the pathological features of the radical prostatectomy specimens were collected from each center and evaluated. Nomogram-predicted probabilities for the presence of unfavorable pathological parameters (extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion/SVI, and lymph node involvement/LNI), and the 5-year freedom from recurrence were compared with actual patient outcomes. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) were determined for each variable to assess the predictive accuracy of the nomograms applied.  Results:   The MSKCC prostate cancer nomograms showed superior accuracy for all parameters studied, as compared with the JHH predictive tables. AUC values for organ-confined disease (OCD), SVI and LNI were calculated as 0.763, 0.750, 0.756 and 0.868, 0.787, 0.874 for JHH and MSKCC nomograms, respectively. The AUC values for 5-year freedom from recurrent disease were 0.751, 0.812, 0.813 and 0.894 for pre- and postoperative JHH and MSKCC nomograms, respectively.  Conclusion:   Despite the potential for heterogeneity in patient selection and management, most predictions demonstrated high concordance with actual observations. All studied nomograms showed reasonable predictive values for the fi nal pathological features, like OCD, SVI and LNI, and for the 5-year freedom from recurrent disease. This multi-institutional study showed that each of the predictive tools studied could be used in Bulgarian patients with comparable accuracy. Compared with the JHH tables, the MSKCC prostate cancer nomograms showed higher predictive accuracy and should therefore be preferred.""","""['A I Hinev', 'D Anakievski', 'N Kolev', 'V Marianovski', 'V Hadjiev']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['Plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 improves the predictive accuracy of prostate cancer nomograms.', 'Can nomograms derived in the U.S. applied to German patients?

Using conventional x-ray simulation is often difficult to accurately localize the extent of the tumor, to cover exactly the lymph nodes at risk and shield the organs at risk. We report on the results of a study comparing target localization with conventional and virtual simulation.  Methods:   One hundred prostate cancer patients underwent both conventional and virtual simulation. The conventional simulation films were compared with digitally reconstructed radiographs (DDRs) produced from the computed tomography (CT) data. All patients underwent target localization for radical prostate radiotherapy. The treatment fields were initially marked with a conventional portal film on linear accelerator (LINAC), plain x-ray film and available diagnostic imaging. Each patient then had a CT and these simulated treatment fields were reproduced within the virtual simulation planning system. The treatment fields defined by the clinicians using each modality were compared in terms of field area and implications for target coverage.  Results:   Virtual simulation showed significantly greater clinical tumor volume coverage and less normal tissue volume irradiated compared with conventional simulation (p <0.001).  Conclusion:   CT localization and virtual simulation allow more accurate definition of the clinical target volume.

Current clinical and pathological methods are limited in the prediction of postoperative outcome. It is becoming increasingly evident that small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species are associated with the development and progression of this malignancy. To assess the diversity and abundance of small ncRNAs in PCa, we analyzed the composition of the entire small transcriptome by Illumina/Solexa deep sequencing. We further analyzed the microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures of 102 fresh-frozen patient samples during PCa progression by miRNA microarrays. Both platforms were cross-validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Besides the altered expression of several miRNAs, our deep sequencing analyses revealed strong differential expression of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs). From microarray analysis, we derived a miRNA diagnostic classifier that accurately distinguishes normal from cancer samples. Furthermore, we were able to construct a PCa prognostic predictor that independently forecasts postoperative outcome. Importantly, the majority of miRNAs included in the predictor also exhibit high sequence counts and concordant differential expression in Illumina PCa samples, supported by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Our findings provide miRNA expression signatures that may serve as an accurate tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa.""","""['E S Martens-Uzunova', 'S E Jalava', 'N F Dits', 'G J L H van Leenders', 'S Møller', 'J Trapman', 'C H Bangma', 'T Litman', 'T Visakorpi', 'G Jenster']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['miRNAs can predict prostate cancer biochemical relapse and are involved in tumor progression.', 'microRNA biomarkers in body fluids of prostate cancer patients.', 'MiR-142-3p as a potential prognostic biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Beyond microRNA--novel RNAs derived from small non-coding RNA and their implication in cancer.', 'MicroRNA expression profiling in cancer from a bioinformatics prospective.', 'Long noncoding RNA SNHG6 promotes the malignant phenotypes of ovarian cancer cells via miR-543/YAP1 pathway.', 'Differential Expression of miRNAs Contributes to Tumor Aggressiveness and Racial Disparity in African American Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic Modifications in Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Microenvironment.', 'Investigating microRNA Profiles in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases and Functional Effects of microRNA-23c and microRNA-4328.', 'Midsize noncoding RNAs in cancers: a new division that clarifies the world of noncoding RNA or an unnecessary chaos?']"""

Vav3, a Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), is overexpressed in human prostate cancers, particularly in models of CRPC progression. Vav3 coactivates AR in a Vav3 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-dependent but GEF-independent manner. Ectopic expression of Vav3 in androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells conferred robust castration-resistant xenograft tumor growth. Vav3 but not a Vav3 PH mutant greatly stimulated interaction between the AR amino and carboxyl termini (N-C interaction), which is required for maximal receptor transcriptional activity. Vav3 was distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus with nuclear localization-dependent on the Vav3 PH domain. Membrane targeting of Vav3 abolished Vav3 potentiation of AR activity, whereas nuclear targeting of a Vav3 PH mutant rescued AR coactivation, suggesting that nuclear localization is an important function of the Vav3 PH domain. A nuclear role for Vav3 was further demonstrated by sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, which revealed that Vav3 and AR were recruited to the same transcriptional complexes of an AR target gene enhancer. These data demonstrate the importance of Vav3 in CRPC and define a novel nuclear function of Vav3 in regulating AR activity.""","""['S Rao', 'L S Lyons', 'C D Fahrenholtz', 'F Wu', 'A Farooq', 'W Balkan', 'K L Burnstein']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Vav3 enhances androgen receptor splice variant activity and is critical for castration-resistant prostate cancer growth and survival.', 'Vav3, a Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor, increases during progression to androgen independence in prostate cancer cells and potentiates androgen receptor transcriptional activity.', 'Ligand-independent activation of androgen receptors by Rho GTPase signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting AR Variant-Coactivator Interactions to Exploit Prostate Cancer Vulnerabilities.', 'Novel interaction between the co-chaperone Cdc37 and Rho GTPase exchange factor Vav3 promotes androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer growth.', 'LncRNA RP11-138J23.1 Contributes to Gastric Cancer Progression by Interacting With RNA-Binding Protein HuR.', 'Gene-Level Germline Contributions to Clinical Risk of Recurrence Scores in Black and White Patients with Breast Cancer.', 'VAV Proteins as Double Agents in Cancer: Oncogenes with Tumor Suppressor Roles.', 'BRG1 knockdown inhibits proliferation through multiple cellular pathways in prostate cancer.', 'EZH2 reduction is an essential mechanoresponse for the maintenance of super-enhancer polarization against compressive stress in human periodontal ligament stem cells.']"""

To identify possible mechanisms underlying zonal differences, we compared the effects of prostate stromal cells derived from the peripheral zone (PZsc) and the transition zone (TZsc) on a PCa epithelial cell line (PC3) in the presence of sex hormones. First, we observed that androgen receptor (AR) mRNA was more highly expressed in PZsc than TZsc when the cells were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and β-oestradiol (E2) (P<0.05). By ELISA, we looked for differences in the secretion of peptide growth factors from PZsc and TZsc. We found that keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) secretion increased with increasing concentrations of DHT (P<0.01) and was higher in PZsc than TZsc. Under treatment with DHT plus E2, PZsc secreted more transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) than TZsc, but this pattern was reversed when the cells were treated with E2 only. With increasing concentrations of DHT, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) secretion increased in PZsc but decreased in TZsc. To further characterize the effects of PZsc and TZsc on PC3 cells, we developed a coculture model and performed MTT assays, Western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR. We found that PZsc promoted PC3 cell proliferation and progression better than TZsc, particularly when treated with 10 nmol l(-1) DHT plus 10 nmol l(-1) E2. In conclusion, our data suggest that PZsc may have a greater capacity to induce PCa development and progression than TZsc via growth factors regulated by sex hormones.

We analyzed the role of E-cadherin missplicing as a mechanism of its downregulation by analyzing a misspliced E-cadherin transcript that lacks exon 11 of this gene. This results in a frameshift and a premature termination codon that targets this transcript for degradation. Tumor tissues, including breast (20%, n = 9), prostate (30%, n = 9) and head and neck (75%, n = 8) cancer, express the exon 11-skipped transcripts (vs. nonmalignant controls) and its levels inversely correlate with E-cadherin expression. This is a novel mechanism of E-cadherin downregulation by missplicing in tumor cells, which is observed in highly prevalent human tumors. In the head and neck cancer model, nontumorigenic keratinocytes express exon 11-skipped splice product two- to sixfold lower than the head and neck tumor cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that SFRS2 (SC35), a splicing factor, as one of the regulators that increases missplicing and downregulates E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, this splicing factor was found to be overexpressed in 5 of 7 head and neck cell lines and primary head and neck tumors.

Angiogenesis and inflammation are central to tumor growth and progression, but the effect of diet on these processes remains uncertain. We explored changes in 50 plasma cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAF) in 145 men with prostate cancer enrolled in a preoperative, randomized controlled phase II trial with four arms: control (usual diet), low-fat (LF) diet, flaxseed-supplemented (FS) diet, and FS+LS diet. The mean duration of dietary intervention was 30 to 31 days. Among the individual arms, the largest number of significant changes (baseline vs. preoperative follow-up) was observed in the LF arm, with 19 CAFs decreasing and one increasing (P < 0.05). Compared with the control arm, 6 CAFs-including proangiogenic factors (stromal-cell derived-1α) and myeloid factors (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor)-all decreased in the LF arm compared with controls; three and four CAFs changed in the FS and FS+LF arms, respectively. Weight loss occurred in the LF arms and significantly correlated with VEGF decreases (P < 0.001). The CAFs that changed in the LF arm are all known to be regulated by NF-κB, and a pathway analysis identified NF-κB as the most likely regulatory network associated with these changes in the LF arm but not in the FS-containing arms. These results suggest that a LF diet without flaxseed may reduce levels of specific inflammatory CAFs and suggests that the NF-κB pathway may be a mediator of these changes.""","""['John V Heymach', 'Terry J Shackleford', 'Hai T Tran', 'Suk-Young Yoo', 'Kim-Anh Do', 'Melanie Wergin', 'Pierre Saintigny', 'Robin T Vollmer', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Denise C Snyder', 'Mack T Ruffin th', 'Shaoyu Yan', 'Mark Dewhirst', 'Ajaikumar B Kunnumakkara', 'Bharat B Aggarwal', 'Wendy Demark-Wahnefried']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Flaxseed supplementation (not dietary fat restriction) reduces prostate cancer proliferation rates in men presurgery.', 'Pilot study to explore effects of low-fat, flaxseed-supplemented diet on proliferation of benign prostatic epithelium and prostate-specific antigen.', 'Pilot study of dietary fat restriction and flaxseed supplementation in men with prostate cancer before surgery: exploring the effects on hormonal levels, prostate-specific antigen, and histopathologic features.', 'Signature of cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAFs) defines a clinically distinct subgroup of gastric cancer.', 'Dietary intervention strategies to modulate prostate cancer risk and prognosis.', 'COVID-19 Spotlights Connections between Disease and Multiple Lifestyle Factors.', 'Association between low-fat diet and liver cancer risk in 98,455 participants: Results from a prospective study.', 'Unraveling the Potential Role of NEDD4-like E3 Ligases in Cancer.', 'Oroxylin A: A Promising Flavonoid for Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases.', 'The promising potential of piperlongumine as an emerging therapeutics for cancer.']"""

CXCR4 expression, alone or in combination with RANK, identified patients destined to relapse to bone.  Background:   The RANK/RANKL/OPG system is active in primary cancers such as breast, prostate, and also in their bone metastases. CXCR4 chemokine receptor is highly expressed in human breast cancer cells and is believed to facilitate the homing of tumor cells to organs such as bone that express high levels of its ligand SDF1. Our study aimed to investigate whether the analysis of these markers with an inexpensive and simple test can help to predict bone metastases in breast cancer patients.  Patients and methods:   Marker expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining in paraffin-embedded tissue sections of primary breast cancers from 40 individuals: 20 patients with bone metastases (BM), 10 with visceral metastases (VM; considered together as the relapsed group), and 10 with no evidence of disease (NED).  Results:   RANKL was not detected in tumor cells. OPG- and RANK-positive tumors are found with similar frequency in NED (20%) and in relapsed patients (23% and 17%, respectively). However, in the latter subgroup, only RANK positivity was always associated with bone relapse. The frequency of CXCR4-positive tumors was three-fold higher in relapsed (30%) than in NED (10%) patients and positivity was always linked to bone metastases. Considering NED and VM patients together versus BM patients, we observed that CXCR4 expression, alone (P = .008) or in combination with RANK (P < .001), identified patients destined to relapse to bone.

The effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Similarly, the effect of 1,25D(3) is mediated by the 1,25D(3) nuclear receptor (VDR). In this study, fibroblasts from benign- (BAS) and carcinoma-associated stroma (CAS) were isolated from human prostates to characterize VDR and GR function as transcription factors in prostate stroma. The VDR-mediated transcriptional activity assessed using the CYP24-luciferase reporter was limited to 3-fold induction by 1,25D(3) in 9 out of 13 CAS (70%), as compared to >10-fold induction in the BAS clinical sample pair. Expression of His-tagged VDR (Ad-his-VDR) failed to recover the low transcriptional activity of the luciferase reporter in 7 out of 9 CAS. Interestingly, expression of Ad-his-VDR successfully recovered receptor-mediated induction in 2 out of the 9 CAS analyzed, suggesting that changes in the receptor protein itself was responsible for decreased response and resistance to 1,25D(3) action. Conversely, VDR-mediated transcriptional activity was more efficient in 4 out of 13 CAS (30%), as compared to the BAS sample pair. Consistent with the reduced response to 1,25D(3) observed in CAS, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated decreased recruitment of coactivators SRC-1/CBP, without major changes in the recruitment of VDR to the CYP24 promoter. In addition, we observed that GR-mediated transcriptional activity was also altered in CAS, as compared to BAS.

However, local failure is also a major problem. We sought to establish the importance of more aggressive local radiotherapy (RT) to ≥80 Gy.  Methods and materials:   There were 226 men treated consecutively with RT ± ADT from 1988 to 2002 for GS 8-10 PCa. Conventional, three-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated (IM) RT was used. Radiation dose was divided into three groups: (1) <75 Gy (n = 50); (2) 75-79.9 Gy (n = 60); or (3) ≥80 Gy (n = 116). The endpoints examined included biochemical failure (BF; nadir + 2 definition), distant metastasis (DM), cause-specific mortality, and overall mortality (OM).  Results:   Median follow-up was 66, 71, and 58 months for Groups 1, 2, and 3. On Fine and Gray's competing risk regression analysis, significant predictors of reduced BF were RT dose ≥80 Gy (p = 0.011) and androgen deprivation therapy duration ≥24 months (p = 0.033).

Although most noted for its role as an embryonic morphogen, hyperactive hedgehog also causes human skin and brain malignancies. The hedgehog-related gene anomalies found in these tumors are rarely found in prostate cancer. Yet surveys of human prostate tumors show concordance of high expression of hedgehog ligands and Gli2 that correlate with the potential for metastasis and therapy-resistant behavior. Likewise, prostate cancer cell lines express hedgehog target genes, and their growth and survival is affected by hedgehog/Gli inhibitors. To date, the preponderance of data supports the idea that prostate tumors benefit from a paracrine hedgehog microenvironment similar to the developing prostate. Uncertainty remains as to whether hedgehog's influence in prostate cancer also includes aspects of tumor cell autocrine-like signaling. The recent findings that Gli proteins interact with the androgen receptor and affect its transcriptional output have helped to identify a novel pathway through which hedgehog/Gli might affect prostate tumor behavior and raises questions as to whether hedgehog signaling in prostate cancer cells is suitably measured by the expression of Gli target genes alone.""","""['Mengqian Chen', 'Richard Carkner', 'Ralph Buttyan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Expert Rev Endocrinol Metab""","""['Androgenic regulation of hedgehog signaling pathway components in prostate cancer cells.', 'Hedgehog/Gli supports androgen signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Non-canonical activation of hedgehog in prostate cancer cells mediated by the interaction of transcriptionally active androgen receptor proteins with Gli3.', 'Nonclassical hedgehog-GLI signaling and its clinical implications.', 'Clinical Implications of Hedgehog Pathway Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Genetic alterations in MED12 promote castration-resistant prostate cancer through modulation of GLI3 signaling.', 'The role of mediator subunit 12 in tumorigenesis and cancer therapeutics.', 'Nanomolar, Noncovalent Antagonism of Hedgehog Cholesterolysis: Exception to the ""Irreversibility Rule"" for Protein Autoprocessing Inhibition.', 'GLI3 Is Stabilized by SPOP Mutations and Promotes Castration Resistance via Functional Cooperation with Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer.', 'SHH-N non-canonically sustains androgen receptor activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.']"""

In this paper, we evaluate the advantages of using bio-impedance information as the input for a support vector machines (SVMs) classifier to overcome these limitations. In this method, the biopsy probes are used as electrodes to obtain electrical impedance data during each biopsy sample. Using a computer model of the prostate, a SVM was trained and tested. Different tumor shapes and conductivity values, and the classifier's ability to generalize to these different properties, were examined.

This field acts on the charged particles, responsible for depositing dose, through the Lorentz force. These conditions require a dose calculation engine capable of taking into consideration the effect of the magnetic field on the dose distribution during the planning stage. Also in the case of a change in anatomy at the time of treatment, a fast online replanning tool is desirable. It is improbable that analytical solutions such as pencil beam calculations can be efficiently adapted for dose calculations within a magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations have therefore been used for the computations but the calculation speed is generally too slow to allow online replanning. In this work, GPUMCD, a fast graphics processing unit (GPU)-based Monte Carlo dose calculation platform, was benchmarked with a new feature that allows dose calculations within a magnetic field. As a proof of concept, this new feature is validated against experimental measurements. GPUMCD was found to accurately reproduce experimental dose distributions according to a 2%-2 mm gamma analysis in two cases with large magnetic field-induced dose effects: a depth-dose phantom with an air cavity and a lateral-dose phantom surrounded by air. Furthermore, execution times of less than 15 s were achieved for one beam in a prostate case phantom for a 2% statistical uncertainty while less than 20 s were required for a seven-beam plan.

Adjusting for patient characteristics, dose, and metformin use, Cox models yielded hazard ratios (HRs) for incident cancer (breast, prostate, pancreas, colon, any site) associated with three forms of insulin: nonglargine, glargine, or glargine plus nonglargine (combination).  Results:   Overall, 81,681 patients were followed for a mean of 23.1 months. Mean age was 77.4 years. Treatment group distribution was 20.7% glargine, 60.5% nonglargine, 18.7% combination insulin.

The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms underlying androgen sensitivity in AIDL cells. We first examined the expression of androgen receptor (AR) and its co-regulators. However, no significant difference in mRNA expression was found between LNCaP and AIDL cells. Remarkably, AR protein levels were induced by R1881 and DHT in LNCaP cells, but not in AIDL cells. We next performed the cDNA sequencing to detect mutations in the AR gene. The T877A mutation was detected both in LNCaP and AIDL cells. Furthermore, AIDL cells harbored a missense substitution (TGG → TGT) in the AR gene, which caused a point mutation at codon 741 (W741C).

Thirteen tissue microarrays comprising 305 tumors and a subset of 112 samples of nonneoplastic prostatic tissue were assessed for ERG rearrangement status by FISH and for ERG expression by immunohistochemistry. Accuracy of ERG detection by immunohistochemistry in predicting ERG status as assessed by FISH (criterion standard) was calculated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. Of 305 tumor foci, 103 (34%) showed ERG rearrangement by FISH. ERG was detected by immunohistochemistry in 100 (33%) cases, 99 of which were FISH positive. ERG detection by immunohistochemistry demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 99%, respectively, with positive and negative predictive values of 99% and 98%, respectively. None of the 112 samples of nonneoplastic prostatic tissue was rearranged by FISH or showed any ERG expression. In conclusion, ERG detection by immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer was highly predictive of ERG rearrangement as assessed by FISH in a large cohort of prostatectomy patients.

For uncertainties that cannot be corrected online, such as rotation and deformation of the target volume, margins are still required to be added to the clinical target volume (CTV) for the treatment planning. Offline adaptive radiotherapy has been implemented to optimize the treatment for each individual patient based on the measurements at early stages of treatment process. It has been shown that offline adaptive radiotherapy can effectively reduce the required margin. Recently a hybrid strategy of offline adaptive replanning and online IG was proposed and the geometric evaluation was performed. It was found that the planning margins can further be reduced by 1-2 mm compared to online IG only strategy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dosimetric benefits of such a hybrid strategy on the target and organs at risk. A total of 420 repeated helical computed tomography scans from 28 patients were included in the study. Both low-risk patients (LRP, CTV = prostate) and intermediate-risk patients (IRP, CTV = prostate + seminal vesicles, SV) were included in the simulation. Two registration methods, based on center-of-mass shift of prostate only and prostate plus SV, were performed for IRP. The intensity-modulated radiotherapy was used in the simulation. Criteria on both cumulative and fractional doses were evaluated. Furthermore, the geometric evaluation was extended to investigate the optimal number of fractions necessary to construct the internal target volume (ITV) for the hybrid strategy. The dosimetric margin improvement was smaller than its geometric counterpart and was in the range of 0-1 mm. The optimal number of fractions necessary for the ITV construction is 2 for LRPs and 3-4 for IRPs in a hypofractionation protocol. A new cumulative index of target volume was proposed for the evaluation of adaptive radiotherapy strategies, and it was found that it had the advantages over other indices in evaluating different adaptive radiotherapy strategies.""","""['Han Liu', 'Qiuwen Wu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A hybrid strategy of offline adaptive planning and online image guidance for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'A ""rolling average"" multiple adaptive planning method to compensate for target volume changes in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluations of an adaptive planning technique incorporating dose feedback in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical to planning target volume margins in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Seminal vesicle inter- and intra-fraction motion during radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A review.', 'Dosimetric benefits of daily treatment plan adaptation for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Target margins in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'What benefit could be derived from on-line adaptive prostate radiotherapy using rectal diameter as a predictor of motion?', 'Validation of a dose warping algorithm using clinically realistic scenarios.', 'Prostate rotation detected from implanted markers can affect dose coverage and cannot be simply dismissed.']"""

In image guided intensity modulated proton therapy (IG-IMPT), because the proton range is more sensitive to the material it travels through, the realignment may introduce large dose variations. This effect is studied in this work and an on-line adaptive procedure is proposed to restore the planned dose to the target. A 2D anthropomorphic phantom was constructed from a real prostate patient's CT image. Two-field laterally opposing spot 3D-modulation and 24-field full arc distal edge tracking (DET) plans were generated with a prescription of 70 Gy to the planning target volume. For the simulated delivery, we considered two types of procedures: the non-adaptive procedure and the on-line adaptive procedure. In the non-adaptive procedure, only patient realignment to match the prostate location in the planning CT was performed. In the on-line adaptive procedure, on top of the patient realignment, the kinetic energy for each individual proton pencil beam was re-determined from the on-line CT image acquired after the realignment and subsequently used for delivery. Dose distributions were re-calculated for individual fractions for different plans and different delivery procedures. The results show, without adaptive, that both the 3D-modulation and the DET plans experienced delivered dose degradation by having large cold or hot spots in the prostate. The DET plan had worse dose degradation than the 3D-modulation plan. The adaptive procedure effectively restored the planned dose distribution in the DET plan, with delivered prostate D(98%), D(50%) and D(2%) values less than 1% from the prescription. In the 3D-modulation plan, in certain cases the adaptive procedure was not effective to reduce the delivered dose degradation and yield similar results as the non-adaptive procedure. In conclusion, based on this 2D phantom study, by updating the proton pencil beam energy from the on-line image after realignment, this on-line adaptive procedure is necessary and effective for the DET-based IG-IMPT.

REDMAPS is a recently reported algorithm that carries out seed localization by detecting, matching and reconstructing seeds in only a few seconds from three acquired x-ray images (Lee et al 2011 IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 29 38-51). In this paper, we present an automatic pose correction (APC) process that is combined with REDMAPS to allow for both more accurate seed reconstruction and the use of images with relatively large pose errors. APC uses a set of reconstructed seeds as a fiducial and corrects the image pose by minimizing the overall projection error. The seed matching and APC are iteratively computed until a stopping condition is met. Simulations and clinical studies show that APC significantly improves the reconstructions with an overall average matching rate of ⩾99.4%, reconstruction error of ⩽0.5 mm, and the matching solution optimality of ⩾99.8%.""","""['Junghoon Lee', 'Nathanael Kuo', 'Anton Deguet', 'Ehsan Dehghan', 'Danny Y Song', 'Everette C Burdette', 'Jerry L Prince']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['REDMAPS: reduced-dimensionality matching for prostate brachytherapy seed reconstruction.', 'Reconstruction of brachytherapy seed positions and orientations from cone-beam CT x-ray projections via a novel iterative forward projection matching method.', 'Matching and reconstruction of brachytherapy seeds using the Hungarian algorithm (MARSHAL).', 'An image-guidance system for dynamic dose calculation in prostate brachytherapy using ultrasound and fluoroscopy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Superior Postimplant Dosimetry Achieved Using Dynamic Intraoperative Dosimetry for Permanent Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of X-ray to MRI for post-implant dosimetry in prostate brachytherapy.', 'A deformable multimodal image registration using PET/CT and TRUS for intraoperative focal prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of PET/CT and ultrasound for disease-targeted focal prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of x ray and MRI for postimplant dosimetry in low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.']"""

Because the clinical impact of edema-induced dose variations strongly depends on the magnitude of the edema, the temporal pattern of its resolution and its interplay with the decay of radioactivity and the underlying biological processes of tumor cells (such as tumor potential doubling time), we investigated the impact of edema-induced dose variations on the tumor cell survival and tumor control probability after PIB with the (131)Cs, (125)I and (103)Pd sources used in current clinical practice. The exponential edema resolution model reported by Waterman et al (1998 Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 41 1069-77) was used to characterize the edema evolutions previously observed during clinical PIB for prostate cancer. The concept of biologically effective dose, taking into account tumor cell proliferation and sublethal damage repair during dose delivery, was used to characterize the effects of prostate edema on cell survival and tumor control probability. Our calculation indicated that prostate edema, if not appropriately taken into account, can increase the cell survival and decrease the probability of local control of PIB. The magnitude of an edema-induced increase in cell survival increased with increasing edema severity, decreasing half-life of radioactive decay and decreasing photon energy emitted by the source. At the doses currently prescribed for PIB and for prostate cancer cells characterized by nominal radiobiology parameters recommended by AAPM TG-137, PIB using (125)I sources was less affected by edema than PIB using (131)Cs or (103)Pd sources due to the long radioactive decay half-life of (125)I. The effect of edema on PIB using (131)Cs or (103)Pd was similar. The effect of edema on (103)Pd PIB was slightly greater, even though the decay half-life of (103)Pd (17 days) is longer than that of (131)Cs (9.7 days), because the advantage of the longer (103)Pd decay half-life was negated by the lower effective energy of the photons it emits (∼21 keV compared to ∼30.4 keV for (131)Cs). In addition, the impact of edema could be reduced or enhanced by differences in the tumor characteristics (e.g. potential tumor doubling time or the α/β ratio), and the effect of these factors varied for the different radioactive sources. There is a clear need to consider the effects of prostate edema during the planning and evaluation of permanent interstitial brachytherapy treatments for prostate cancer.""","""['Zhe Jay Chen', 'Kenneth Roberts', 'Roy Decker', 'Pradip Pathare', 'Sara Rockwell', 'Ravinder Nath']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Potential impact of prostate edema on the dosimetry of permanent seed implants using the new 131Cs (model CS-1) seeds.', 'Optimum timing for image-based dose evaluation of 125I and 103PD prostate seed implants.', 'Biologically effective dose for permanent prostate brachytherapy taking into account postimplant edema.', 'Does brachytherapy have a role in the treatment of prostate cancer?', 'A review of rectal toxicity following permanent low dose-rate prostate brachytherapy and the potential value of biodegradable rectal spacers.', 'TRPM8: a potential target for cancer treatment.', 'Prostate volume changes during permanent seed brachytherapy: an analysis of intra-operative variations, predictive factors and clinical implication.']"""

Considering the carcinogenic potential of estrogen metabolites as well as altered intraprostatic estrogen biosynthesis during the development of prostate cancer, we investigated associations between repeat polymorphisms of three key estrogen-related genes (CYP11A1, CYP19A1, UGT1A1) and risk of prostate cancer in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), designed to test finasteride versus placebo as a chemoprevention agent. Using data and specimens from 1154 cases and 1351 controls who were frequency matched on age, family history of prostate cancer and PCPT treatment arm, we used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) separately in the placebo and finasteride arms. Among men in the placebo arm, CYP19A1 7/8 genotype carriers had a significantly higher risk of prostate cancer compared with those with the 7/7 genotype (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.16-2.5), regardless of Gleason grade. This genotype was also associated with elevated serum estrogen levels.

No significant association was found with CYP11A1. These associations were not observed among men in the finasteride arm.

Moreover, factors that predict either early or late sexual HRQoL decline have not been fully investigated.  Aim:   The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between early and late phase sexual HRQoL decline, and identify clinical parameters that predict substantial sexual HRQoL decline after surgery in the early phase (3 months) and late phase (20 months) following RP.  Methods:   We analyzed data on 2,345 consecutive patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy, radical perineal prostatectomy, or robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy between 2001 and 2009 from the Duke Prostate Center database.  Main outcome measure:   Sexual HRQoL was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite instrument at baseline, early and late phase after surgery. The Spearman rank test was used to calculate correlation coefficients between early and late phase sexual HRQoL decline. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with substantial sexual HRQoL decline during both phases.  Results:   Of 406 men who met our criteria, 217 (53.5%) men had normal erectile function, whereas 189 (46.5%) men had erectile dysfunction at baseline. Declines of sexual HRQoL during early phase had a significant association with that of a decline during late phase (r = 0.48, P < 0.001). In logistic regression, older age at surgery (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; P = 0.007 and OR, 1.08; P = 0.001), African-American race (OR, 4.32; P = 0.001 and OR, 3.13; P = 0.017), and overall comorbidity (OR, 1.43; P = 0.072 and OR, 1.72; P = 0.010) were consistently associated with substantial decline of sexual HRQoL in both early and late phases.  Conclusions:   Sexual HRQoL at early and late phases after RP were strongly correlated. Additionally, several factors were identified to be a predictor for decline of sexual HRQoL.

Materials and methods:   All RP entries on the BAUS complex operations database were extracted from its commencement in January 2004 to September 2009. Patient age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, clinical tumour stage and biopsy Gleason score were analyzed together with operative variables, including the surgical approach, lymphadenectomy status, blood loss, hospital length of stay and individual surgeon case volume. The postoperative variables assessed included surgical specimen Gleason score and pathological tumour stage, prostate weight and the presence of positive surgical margins (PSM), as well as evidence of biochemical recurrence.  Results:   A total of 8032 RP cases were entered on the database and Follow-up data was available on 4206 cases. Mean patient age was 61.8 years and the mean presenting PSA was 8.3 ng/mL. Open RP procedures were performed on 5429 patients and laparoscopic RP on 2219. The positive surgical margin (PSM) rate for the entire series was 38%. Analysis of PSM by pathological stage revealed a pT2 PSM rate of 24%. Multivariate analysis of variables which might affect PSM revealed pre-operative clinical TNM stage, surgeon case volume, RP specimen Gleason score and pathological TNM stage were significant parameters (P < 0.01). When prostate weight and PSM status were analysed, these was a significant association between smaller prostate weight and PSM status. Interestingly, 45% of high grade Gleason 8-10 needle biopsy cancers were downgraded to Gleason scores 7 or less on RP analysis. Analysis of annual surgeon caseload revealed that 54% of surgeons performed an average of less than 10 procedures per annum and 6% of surgeons performed an average of 30 or more procedures per annum. When individual outcome variables where examined against surgeon case activity it was demonstrated that outcomes are clearly improved beyond 20 cases and there is a trend to continued improvement up to the series maximum of 40 cases per annum.  Conclusions:   High volume surgeons have less peri-operative and postoperative complications and better surgical and disease-free outcomes than low volume surgeons.

Direct age-standardized death rates were calculated and compared with the general Australian male population.  Results:   The 4025 male farmers or farm managers who died in this period represented 3.35% of all male deaths in the 25-74 year age range.

Based on published studies of 26 SNPs that are currently known to be associated with prostate cancer, we have extended our model to incorporate these SNPs by decomposing the polygenic component into two parts: a polygenic component due to the known susceptibility SNPs, , and the residual polygenic component due to the postulated but as yet unknown genetic variants, .

For prognostic monitoring after prostatectomy, recurrent increase of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the so-called PSA or biochemical relapse remains the leading biomarker. There is currently no biomarker that can accurately predict the risk of relapse at the time of surgery. We analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 52 primary prostate cancers and normal adjacent tissues obtained after radical prostatectomy. Patients were grouped into two categories: i) patients with early biochemical relapse (<1 year after radical prostatectomy) and ii) patients with late or no biochemical relapse (>2 years after surgery). Multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis was performed to identify a miRNA signature that can predict relapse. Results were validated by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. We identified 63 miRNAs that were differentially expressed among the same categories of patients, of whom 35 miRNAs were up-regulated and 28 were down-regulated. Literature search shows that many of these miRNAs have an established prognostic significance in other cancers and can be actively involved in tumor progression. Target prediction analysis showed that predicted targets of these miRNAs could be involved in biological processes and pathways that enhance tumor progression. We experimentally validated the role of one of the dysregulated miRNAs (miR-10b) in relapse using proliferation and wound-healing assay. miRNAs can be reliable predictive markers for biochemical relapse of prostate cancer at the time of radical prostatectomy.

PC3 cells were treated with atorvastatin, in combination with the inhibitors for transcription, protein translation, PI-3 kinase, mTOR, and MAP kinases. The atorvastatin-induced elevation of LC3-II was inhibited by both the translational and the transcriptional inhibitors, suggesting that the inhibition of geranylgeranyl biosynthesis by atorvastatin activates transcription of LC3, which results in elevation of LC3-II and activation of autophagy. RT-PCR and quantitative PCR assays showed that atorvastatin enhanced expression of LC3 mRNA, and addition of geranylgeraniol along with atorvastatin to the medium eliminated the enhancement, confirming the activation of transcription of LC3 is caused by atorvastatin-mediated inhibition of geranylgeranyl biosynthesis. Further, we found that both the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125, inhibited the atorvastatin-induced elevation of LC3-II, suggesting that the effect of atorvastatin on autophagy is mediated by the Erk and JNK pathways.

The planned adaptive module was used for dose recalculation. The study endpoints were to analyse the variations in certain dose-volume parameters of the rectum and bladder (BD 2cc , RD 2cc , BV 100% , BV 70% , RV 100% , RV 70% ), the maximum anteroposterior (AP) and lateral rectal diameters, the volume of the CTV receiving 100% of the prescription dose (CTV V 100% ) and the dose to 100% of the CTV (CTV D 100% ).  Results:   The difference between the planned and delivered target doses (CTV V100% and CTV D100%) was small and clinically insignificant indicating adequate target coverage during treatment.

Modified FABP expression patterns were described for prostate, bladder and for renal cell carcinoma. Studies on metabolic relationships and interactions in permanent cell lines allow a deeper insight into molecular processes. The aim of this study is therefore a systematic overview on mRNA and protein expressions of seven FABPs in frequently used urological cell lines.  Methods:   Nine cell lines of renal carcinomas, seven of urinary bladder carcinomas, and five of prostate carcinomas were investigated. Quantitative RT-qPCR and western blotting were used to determine different FABPs. In addition, 46 paired cancerous and noncancerous tissue samples from nephrectomy specimen with renal cell carcinomas were investigated regarding the ileum FABP mRNA expression level and associated with survival outcome.  Results:   General characteristics of all urological carcinoma cell lines were the expression of E-and IL-FABP on mRNA and protein level, while the expressions differed between the cell lines. The protein expression was not always congruent with the mRNA expression. Renal cell carcinoma cell lines showed expressions of L-, H- and B-FABP mRNA in addition to the general FABP expression in five out of the eight investigated cell lines. In bladder cancer cell lines, we additionally found the expression of A-FABP mRNA in six cell lines, while H-FABP was present only in three cell lines. In prostate cancer cell lines, a strong reduction of A- and E- FABP mRNA was observed. The expression of B-FABP mRNA and protein was observed only in the 22 RV-1 cells. IL-FABP mRNA was over-expressed in renal tumour tissue. The IL-FABP ratio was identified as an independent indicator of survival outcome.  Conclusions:   Distinctly different FABP expression patterns were observed not only between the cell lines derived from the three cancer types, but also between the cell lines from the same cancer. The FABP patterns in the cell lines do not always reflect the real situation in the tumours.

The procedure is challenging in large prostates, and the optimal prostate volume for brachytherapy was previously defined as ≤40 ml. This study analysed the outcome of PC patients with small (group A) and large (group B) prostate volume in prospective data.  Material and methods:   The material consisted of 535 consecutive patients treated with brachytherapy in Kuopio University Hospital. The mean follow-up time was nearly 6 years. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure was defined as PSA rising ≥2.0 μg/l above nadir. A PSA bounce was defined as a rise in PSA of ≥0.2 μg/l. The causes of death were recorded.  Results:   A bounce was recorded more frequently in group A (30%) than in group B (18%) (p = 0.006). A bounce correlated with young age predicted a favourable outcome in both groups. PSA failure rate was similar in both groups: 13% and 12% in groups A and B, respectively. Post-treatment PSA ≤0.5 μg/l was the only independent prognostic factor associated with PSA failure in both groups (p < 0.0001, both groups). PC survival was 98.4% in both groups. Overall survival was 91% and 94% in groups A and B, respectively (p = not significant).

A promising method to overcome this problem is dynamic multi-leaf collimator (DMLC) tracking. The purpose of this phantom study was to integrate a wired electromagnetic (EM) transponder localization system with DMLC tracking and to investigate the geometric accuracy of the integrated system.  Material and methods:   DMLC tracking experiments were performed on a Trilogy accelerator with a prototype DMLC tracking system. A wired implantable EM transponder was mounted on a motion stage with a 3 mm tungsten sphere used for target visualization in continuous portal images. The three dimensional (3D) transponder position signal was used for DMLC aperture adaption. The motion stage was programmed to reproduce eight representative patient-measured trajectories for prostate and for lung tumors. The tracking system latency was determined and prediction was used for the lung tumor trajectories to account for the latency. For each trajectory, three conformal fields with a 10 cm circular MLC aperture and 72 s treatment duration were delivered: (1) a 358° arc field; (2) an anterior static field; and (3) a lateral static field. The tracking error was measured as the difference between the marker position and the MLC aperture in the portal images.  Results:   The tracking system latency was 140 ms. The mean root-mean-square (rms) of the 3D transponder localization error was 0.53/0.54 mm for prostate/lung tumor trajectories. The mean rms of the two dimensional (2D) tracking error was 0.69 mm (prostate) and 0.98 mm (lung tumors) with tracking and 3.4 mm (prostate) and 5.3 mm (lung tumors) without tracking.  Conclusions:   DMLC tracking was integrated with a wired EM transponder localization system and investigated for arc and static field delivery.

This study aims to evaluate the robustness towards geometrical uncertainties in prostate cancer using two image-guided RT (IGRT) set-up strategies for two SIB delivery methods. Secondly, we evaluate the ability of geometrical parameters to predict when the applied margins are insufficient, resulting in target underdosage (TUD).  Material and methods:   The study included nine patients with eight to nine repeat computed tomography (CT)-scans evenly distributed throughout their treatment course. The prostate target (CTV-p) and the lymph node target including seminal vesicles (CTV-ln/sv) were delineated in all scans. SIB treatment plans for intensity-modulated RT and volumetric modulated arc therapy were generated on the planning CT and transferred to the repeat CTs for dose re-calculation using registration based on either anatomy or intra-prostatic fiducial markers. Receiving operator characteristic analysis was used to deduce the ability of the parameters to predict TUD.  Results:   The dosimetric differences between the two positioning strategies were small for all parameters evaluated and significant only for the dose to rectum. Anatomy based registration resulted in inferior target coverage with a larger number of TUDs, mostly seen in the seminal vesicles. For both targets the highest sensitivity and specificity of predicting TUD was seen for the relative volume and the lowest was found for the displacement vector.  Conclusions:   Positioning based on fiducials gave the best trade-off between coverage of the targets although resulting in the highest dose to rectum. Target underdosage occurred mostly in the seminal vesicles.

Motion patterns include both volume and shape changes, calling for deformable image registration (DIR), in approaches involving dose accumulation and adaptation. In this study, we tested the performance of a DIR application for contour propagation from the treatment planning computed tomography (pCT) to repeat cone-beam CTs (CBCTs) for a set of prostate cancer patients.  Material and methods:   The prostate, rectum and bladder were delineated in the pCT and in six to eight repeat CBCTs for each of five patients. The pCT contours were propagated onto the corresponding CBCT using the Multi-modality Image Registration and Segmentation application, resulting in 36 registrations. Prior to the DIR, a rigid registration was performed. The algorithm used for the DIR was based on a 'demons' algorithm and the performance of it was examined quantitatively using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and qualitatively as visual slice-by-slice scoring by a radiation oncologist grading the deviations in shape and/or distance relative to the anatomy.  Results:   The average DSC (range) for the DIR over all scans and patients was 0.80 (0.65-0.87) for prostate, 0.77 (0.63-0.87) for rectum and 0.73 (0.34-0.91) for bladder, while the corresponding DSCs for the rigid registrations were 0.77 (0.65-0.86), 0.71 (0.55-0.82) and 0.64 (0.33-0.87). The percentage of propagated contours of good/acceptable quality was 45% for prostate; 20% for rectum and 33% for bladder. For the bladder, there was an association between the average DSC and the different scores of the qualitative evaluation.  Conclusions:   DIR improved the performance of pelvic organ contour propagation from the pCT to CBCTs as compared to rigid registration only. Still, a large fraction of the propagated rectum and bladder contours were unacceptable. The image quality of the CBCTs was sub-optimal and the usability of CBCTs for dose accumulation and adaptation purposes is therefore likely to benefit from improved image quality and improvements of the DIR algorithm.""","""['Maria Thor', 'Jørgen B B Petersen', 'Lise Bentzen', 'Morten Høyer', 'Ludvig Paul Muren']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Propagation of target and organ at risk contours in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using deformable image registration.', 'Dose/volume-based evaluation of the accuracy of deformable image registration for the rectum and bladder.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy strategies for pelvic tumors - a systematic review of clinical implementations.', 'Deep-Learning-based Fast and Accurate 3D CT Deformable Image Registration in Lung Cancer.', 'An Unsupervised Learning-Based Regional Deformable Model for Automated Multi-Organ Contour Propagation.', 'Evaluation of generalization ability for deep learning-based auto-segmentation accuracy in limited field of view CBCT of male pelvic region.', 'Dosimetric impact of deformable image registration using radiophotoluminescent glass dosimeters with a physical geometric phantom.', 'Automatic contouring using deformable image registration for tandem-ring or tandem-ovoid brachytherapy.']"""

The center of gravity (CoG) positions of the manually segmented FM artefacts (FMA) and the size of FMAs in x-, y- and z direction were measured in the two corresponding image sets, based on the intensity changes caused by the FM reconstruction. Also, a similarity measure, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), of the segmented FMAs in the two image sets was calculated.

Materials and methods:   Eighty-one patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy underwent DCEMRI with Gd-DTPA prior to external beam radiotherapy. The median follow-up time after treatment was four years, in which nine patients had primary tumor relapse. By fitting a pharmacokinetic two-compartment model function to the temporal contrast enhancement in the tumor, two pharmacokinetic parameters, K(trans) and ύ(e), were estimated voxel by voxel from the DCEMR-images. Intratumoral regions with similar vascularization were identified by k-means clustering of the two pharmacokinetic parameter estimates over all patients. The volume fraction of each cluster was used to evaluate the prognostic value of the clusters.  Results:   Three clusters provided a sufficient reduction of the cluster variance to label different vascular properties within the tumors. The corresponding median volume fraction of each cluster was 38%, 46% and 10%. The second cluster was significantly associated with primary tumor control in a log-rank survival test (p-value: 0.042), showing a decreased risk of treatment failure for patients with high volume fraction of voxels.

Material and methods:   Fourteen patients (planned accrual: 31 pts) have been treated within this trial so far. IMRT is prescribed to the median PTV at a dose of 30 × 2 Gy; (12)C boost is applied to the prostate (GTV) at a dose of 6 × 3 GyE using raster scan technique. Safety margins added to the clinical target volume were determined individually for each patient based on five independent planning computed tomography (CT)-scans. Acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity was assessed and documented according to the CTCAE Version 3.0.  Results:   Radiotherapy was very well tolerated without any grade 3 or higher toxicity. Acute anal bleeding grade 2 was observed in 2/14 patients.

It uses a simple expected value algorithm to calculate a score for each option by taking into account the individual's preferences for different criteria (as importance weights) and the evidence of the performance of each option on each criterion. Given the uncertainty surrounding the trade offs between benefits and harms for prostate cancer screening, this topic was chosen as the vehicle to introduce this new decision-support template.  Objective:   The aim of the study was to introduce a new decision-support template, AL, and to develop and pilot a decision-support tool for prostate cancer screening using it.  Methods:   A decision-support tool for prostate cancer screening (ALProst) was implemented in the AL template. ALProst incorporated evidence on both the benefits and the potential harms of prostate cancer screening (the 'attributes') from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Individual weights for each attribute were elicited during interviews. By combining the individual's preferences and the evidence, the best option for the user was identified on the basis of quantified scores. A convenience sample of computer-proficient primary-care physicians (general practitioners [GPs] in Australia) from the Sydney Metropolitan area (Australia) were invited to complete a face-to-face interview involving the decision-support tool. Preference for undergoing prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer, both personally and for their patients, was sought prior to seeing the tool. After gaining hands-on experience with using the tool, GPs were asked to comment on the merits of the template and the tool. Preference for presenting the benefits of prostate cancer screening as the relative or absolute risk reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality was also sought.  Results:   Of 60 GPs approached, ten (six men and four women) completed an interview (16.7% response rate). Most GPs agreed/strongly agreed with positive statements about the ease with which they could use AL (seven GPs), and understand the information in, and format of, AL (nine and eight, respectively). Eight agreed/strongly agreed that ALProst would be a useful tool for discussing prostate cancer screening with their patients. GPs were also asked to nominate difficult clinical decisions that they, and their patients, have had to make; responses included cancer screening (including prostate cancer); treating patients with multiple illnesses/diseases; managing multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors; and managing patients who are receiving multiple medications. The common element was the need to consider multiple factors in making these complex decisions.  Conclusions:   AL is distinguishable from most other decision-support templates available today by its underlying conceptual framework, MCDA, and its power to combine individual preferences with evidence to derive the best option for the user quantitatively. It therefore becomes potentially useful for all decisions at all levels in the healthcare system. Moreover, it will provide a universal graphic 'language' that can overcome the burden to patients of encountering a plethora of widely varying decision aids for different conditions during their lifetime.""","""['Michelle Cunich', 'Glenn Salkeld', 'Jack Dowie', 'Joan Henderson', 'Clare Bayram', 'Helena Britt', 'Kirsten Howard']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Patient""","""['Web-Based Versus Usual Care and Other Formats of Decision Aids to Support Prostate Cancer Screening Decisions: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', ""General Practitioners' Experiences of, and Responses to, Uncertainty in Prostate Cancer Screening: Insights from a Qualitative Study."", 'Does evidence-based information about screening for prostate cancer enhance consumer decision-making?

The prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF), a novel epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor, acts as an androgen-independent transcriptional activator of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter. We determined the antitumor function of luteolin via upregulation of PDEF gene expression in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. Results from flow cytometry and (3) H-thymidine incorporation assays revealed that luteolin treatments attenuated cell proliferation and arrested the cell cycle at the G1/S phase. High concentration of luteolin (30 μM) induced cell apoptosis. Immunoblot assays and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay revealed that luteolin treatment upregulated PDEF but downregulated androgen receptor (AR) gene expression, which decreased PSA gene expression in LNCaP cells. Results of immunoblot and transient gene expression assays revealed that luteolin treatments at proapoptosis dosage, enhanced gene expression of PDEF, B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2), N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) and Maspin. Transient gene expression assays indicated that cotransfection of the PDEF expression vector enhanced the promoter activities of the BTG2, NDRG1 and Maspin genes. Stable overexpression of PDEF significantly induced BTG2, NDRG1 and Maspin gene expression, which markedly attenuated in vitro cell proliferation and invasion of LNCaP cells. The modulatory effect of luteolin on BTG2, NDRG1 and Maspin gene expression were attenuated when PDEF was knocked-down. These results suggest that luteolin blocks PSA gene expression by downregulation of AR expression. The enhancement of PDEF expression, which induced BTG2, NDRG1 and Maspin gene expression, could account for the function of luteolin for antiproliferation and anti-invasion in LNCaP cells.""","""['Ke-Hung Tsui', 'Li-Chuan Chung', 'Tsui-Hsia Feng', 'Phei-Lang Chang', 'Horng-Heng Juang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['L-Mimosine blocks cell proliferation via upregulation of B-cell translocation gene 2 and N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Metallothionein 3: an androgen-upregulated gene enhances cell invasion and tumorigenesis of prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Glycoprotein transmembrane nmb: an androgen-downregulated gene attenuates cell invasion and tumorigenesis in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Prostate derived ETS factor (PDEF): a putative tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'Signatures of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) in cancer.', 'BTG2 and SerpinB5, a novel gene pair to evaluate the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Luteolin on Cancer.', 'Current Perspective on the Natural Compounds and Drug Delivery Techniques in Glioblastoma Multiforme.', 'Maspin is a PTEN-Upregulated and p53-Upregulated Tumor Suppressor Gene and Acts as an HDAC1 Inhibitor in Human Bladder Cancer.', 'Recruitment of miR-8080 by luteolin inhibits androgen receptor splice variant 7 expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Viable numbers of MDA-MD-231 human breast cancer cells, DU145 human prostate cancer cells, and AGS human gastric cancer cells decreased by 18, 31, and 69%, respectively, following treatment with 200 µg/mL CPE for 24 hr.

CPE increased the levels of cleaved caspase-8, -7, -3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in a dose-dependent manner but not cleaved caspase-9. CPE exerted no effects on Bcl-2 and Bax levels. The level of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein decreased within a narrow range following CPE treatment. The levels of Trail, DR4, and Fas-L increased dose-dependently in CPE-treated AGS cells. These results show that CPE decreases growth and induces apoptosis in AGS gastric cancer cells and that activation of the death receptor pathway contributes to CPE-induced apoptosis in AGS cells.

Its manifestation, however, varies from clinically asymptomatic insidious neoplasms that progress slowly and do not threaten life to one that is highly aggressive with a propensity for metastatic spread and lethality if not treated in time. A number of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations occur in prostate cancer cells. Some of these changes, such as loss of the tumor suppressors PTEN and p53, are linked to disease progression. Others, such as ETS gene fusions, appear to be linked more with early phases of the disease, such as invasion. Alterations in chromosome 8q24 in the region of MYC have also been linked to disease aggressiveness for many years. However, a number of recent studies in human tissues have indicated that MYC appears to be activated at the earliest phases of prostate cancer (e.g., in tumor-initiating cells) in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, a key precursor lesion to invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma. The initiation and early progression of prostate cancer can be recapitulated in genetically engineered mouse models, permitting a richer understanding of the cause and effects of loss of tumor suppressors and activation of MYC. The combination of studies using human tissues and mouse models paints an emerging molecular picture of prostate cancer development and early progression. This picture reveals that MYC contributes to disease initiation and progression by stimulating an embryonic stem cell-like signature characterized by an enrichment of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and by repressing differentiation. These insights pave the way to potential novel therapeutic concepts based on MYC biology.""","""['Cheryl M Koh', 'Charles J Bieberich', 'Chi V Dang', 'William G Nelson', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Angelo M De Marzo']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Genes Cancer""","""['Combined MYC Activation and Pten Loss Are Sufficient to Create Genomic Instability and Lethal Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'A mouse model of heterogeneous, c-MYC-initiated prostate cancer with loss of Pten and p53.', 'Loss of Nkx3.1 leads to the activation of discrete downstream target genes during prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Survey of genetically engineered mouse models for prostate cancer: analyzing the molecular basis of prostate cancer development, progression, and metastasis.', 'Alterations of p53 are common in early stage prostate cancer.', 'Potent carotenoid astaxanthin expands the anti-cancer activity of cisplatin in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Alterations and Co-Occurrence of C-MYC, N-MYC, and L-MYC Expression are Related to Clinical Outcomes in Various Cancers.', 'A kinome-wide CRISPR screen identifies CK1α as a target to overcome enzalutamide resistance of prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of super-enhancer using machine learning and its application to medical biology.', 'MYC-driven increases in mitochondrial DNA copy number occur early and persist throughout prostatic cancer progression.']"""

ALDH+ subpopulations were detected and isolated from the human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and long-term IL-6 stimulated LNCaP cells using ALDEFLUOR® assay and flow cytometry. In contrast to ALDH- cells, ALDH+ prostate cancer cells showed cancer stem cell-like characteristics such as increased self-renewing and colony forming capacity and tumorigenicity. In addition, ALDH+ cells showed an increased expression of putative prostate cancer stem cell markers (CD44 and integrin α2β1). Furthermore, ALDH+ cells expressed phosphorylated STAT3. Galiellalactone treatment decreased the proportion of ALDH+ prostate cancer cells and induced apoptosis of ALDH+ cells.

HGF plays a crucial role as a mediator of stromal-epithelial interactions in the normal prostate but the precise biological function of HGF/c-Met interaction in the normal prostate and in prostate cancer is not clear. HGF has two naturally occurring splice variants and NK1, the smallest of these HGF variants, consists of the HGF amino terminus through the first kringle domain. We evaluated the intracellular signaling cascades and the morphological changes triggered by NK1 in human prostate epithelial cell line PNT1A which shows molecular and biochemical properties close to the normal prostate epithelium. We demonstrated that these cells express a functional c-MET, and cell exposure to NK1 induces the phosphorylation of tyrosines 1313/1349/1356 residues of c-MET which provide docking sites for signaling molecules. We observed an increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, c-Src, p125FAK, SMAD2/3, and STAT3, down-regulation of the expression of epithelial cell-cell adhesion marker E-cadherin, and enhanced expression levels of mesenchymal markers vimentin, fibronectin, vinculin, α-actinin, and α-smooth muscle actin. This results in cell proliferation, in the appearance of a mesenchymal phenotype, in morphological changes resembling cell scattering and in wound healing.

However, this can be a diagnostic challenge when there is limited tissue and in poorly differentiated tumors. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of a dual immunohistochemical stain comprising p63 and P501S (prostein), applied sequentially on a single slide and visualized by double chromogen reaction, in differentiating these two cancers. Thus far, there have been no previous studies assessing the diagnostic utility of p63 and P501S combined together as a dual immunostain in distinguishing between these two cancers.  Methods:   p63/P501S dual-color sequential immunohistochemical staining was performed on archival material from 132 patients with high-grade UC and 23 patients with PC, and evaluated for p63 (brown nuclear) and P501S (red cytoplasmic) expression. Both the staining intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells were assessed.  Results:   p63 was positive in 119/132 of UC and negative in PC. P501S was positive in 22/23 of PC and negative in UC. The p63+/P501S- immunoprofile had 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity for UC. The p63-/P501S+ immunoprofile had 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity for PC.

Differential analysis of gene networks allows spotting condition-specific interactions that, for instance, form disease networks if the conditions are a disease, such as cancer, and normal. This could potentially allow developing better and subtly targeted drugs to cure cancer. Differential network analysis with direct physical gene interactions needs to be explored in this endeavour.  Results:   C3NET is a recently introduced information theory based gene network inference algorithm that infers direct physical gene interactions from expression data, which was shown to give consistently higher inference performances over various networks than its competitors. In this paper, we present, DC3net, an approach to employ C3NET in inferring disease networks. We apply DC3net on a synthetic and real prostate cancer datasets, which show promising results. With loose cutoffs, we predicted 18583 interactions from tumor and normal samples in total. Although there are no reference interactions databases for the specific conditions of our samples in the literature, we found verifications for 54 of our predicted direct physical interactions from only four of the biological interaction databases. As an example, we predicted that RAD50 with TRF2 have prostate cancer specific interaction that turned out to be having validation from the literature. It is known that RAD50 complex associates with TRF2 in the S phase of cell cycle, which suggests that this predicted interaction may promote telomere maintenance in tumor cells in order to allow tumor cells to divide indefinitely. Our enrichment analysis suggests that the identified tumor specific gene interactions may be potentially important in driving the growth in prostate cancer. Additionally, we found that the highest connected subnetwork of our predicted tumor specific network is enriched for all proliferation genes, which further suggests that the genes in this network may serve in the process of oncogenesis.  Conclusions:   Our approach reveals disease specific interactions. It may help to make experimental follow-up studies more cost and time efficient by prioritizing disease relevant parts of the global gene network.""","""['Gökmen Altay', 'Mohammad Asim', 'Florian Markowetz', 'David E Neal']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Structural influence of gene networks on their inference: analysis of C3NET.', 'Identifying significant genetic regulatory networks in the prostate cancer from microarray data based on transcription factor analysis and conditional independency.', 'BRCA1 localization to the telomere and its loss from the telomere in response to DNA damage.', 'Cell cycle-dependent role of MRN at dysfunctional telomeres: ATM signaling-dependent induction of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) in G1 and resection-mediated inhibition of NHEJ in G2.', 'Biological Network Inference and analysis using SEBINI and CABIN.', ""3'-UTR Shortening Contributes to Subtype-Specific Cancer Growth by Breaking Stable ceRNA Crosstalk of Housekeeping Genes."", 'Profiling of differentially expressed genes in cadmium-induced prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Host Transcriptomics as a Tool to Identify Diagnostic and Mechanistic Immune Signatures of Tuberculosis.', 'Large scale study of anti-sense regulation by differential network analysis.', 'Use of Microarray Datasets to generate Caco-2-dedicated Networks and to identify Reporter Genes of Specific Pathway Activity.']"""

Patients and methods:   • Recent data support the hypothesis that the hormonal environment in overweight and obese men may alter androgen-dependent prostate growth. Body mass index (BMI) has been implicated in prostate cancer pathophysiology. • We analysed 1275 patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at a single tertiary care institution. Mean tumour volume (TV) was evaluated according to BMI WHO categories (normal <25 kg/m(2) vs overweight 25-30 kg/m(2) vs obese 30-35 kg/m(2) vs severely obese >35 kg/m(2)). • Univariable linear regression analyses targeted the association between BMI and TV at radical prostatectomy. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, prostate-specific antigen value, biopsy Gleason sum, clinical stage and prostate volume.  Results:   • Mean BMI was 26.3 kg/m(2) (median 26; range 16.7-42.0). Mean TV was 5.6 mL (median 3.3; range 0.1-61.2). The mean prostate-specific antigen value was 10.3 ng/dL (median 6.6; range 0.3-327). • The mean TV was 5.0, 5.8, 6.3 and 9.2 mL in normal, overweight, obese and severely obese patients, respectively (P= 0.03). TVs in men with a normal BMI were 84% smaller than in severely obese men (5.0 vs 9.2 mL). • On univariable analysis, BMI was correlated with TV at radical prostatectomy (P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, BMI reached the independent predictor status after adjustment for age, prostate-specific antigen value, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage and prostate volume (P= 0.03).

Patients and methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 450 men treated with prostatectomy at a tertiary hospital between July 1981 and July 2010 who developed PSA recurrence (≥0.2 ng/mL) and never received adjuvant or salvage therapy before the development of metastatic disease. We estimated MFS using the Kaplan-Meier method, and investigated factors influencing the risk of metastasis using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Median follow-up after prostatectomy was 8.0 years, and after biochemical recurrence was 4.0 years. At last follow-up, 134 of 450 patients (29.8%) had developed metastases, while median MFS was 10.0 years. Using multivariable regressions, two variables emerged as independently predictive of MFS: PSA doubling time (<3.0 vs 3.0-8.9 vs 9.0-14.9 vs ≥15.0 months) and Gleason score (≤6 vs 7 vs 8-10). Using these stratifications of Gleason score and PSA doubling time, tables were constructed to predict median, 5- and 10-year MFS after PSA recurrence. In different patient subsets, median MFS ranged from 1 to 15 years.  Conclusions:   In men undergoing prostatectomy, MFS after PSA recurrence is variable and is most strongly influenced by PSA doubling time and Gleason score.

Their new ROCO implementation works with the treatment planning system and full dose calculation used at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). The authors have implemented mean dose hard constraints, along with the point-dose and dose-volume constraints that the authors used for our previous work on the prostate.  Methods:   ROCO consists of three major steps. First, the space of treatment plans is sampled by solving a series of optimization problems using penalty-based quadratic objective functions. Next, an efficient basis for this space is found via principal component analysis (PCA); this reduces the dimensionality of the problem. Finally, a constrained optimization problem is solved over this basis to find a clinically acceptable IMRT plan. Dimensionality reduction makes constrained optimization computationally efficient.  Results:   The authors apply ROCO to 12 stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases, generating IMRT plans that meet all clinical constraints and are clinically acceptable, and demonstrate that they are competitive with the clinical treatment plans. The authors also test how many samples and PCA modes are necessary to achieve an adequate lung plan, demonstrate the importance of long-range dose calculation for ROCO, and evaluate the performance of nonspecific normal tissue (""rind"") constraints in ROCO treatment planning for the lung. Finally, authors show that ROCO can save time for planners, and they estimate that in the clinic, planning using their approach would save a median of 105 min for the patients in the study.  Conclusions:   New challenges arise when applying ROCO to the lung site, which include the lack of a class solution, a larger treatment site, an increased number of parameters and beamlets, a variable number of beams and beam arrangement, and the customary use of rinds in clinical plans to avoid high-dose areas outside the PTV. In the authors previous work, use of an approximate dose calculation in the hard constraint optimization sometimes meant that clinical constraints were not met when evaluated with the full dose calculation. This difficulty has been removed in the current work by using the full dose calculation in the hard constraint optimization. The authors have demonstrated that ROCO offers a fast and automatic way to create IMRT plans for advanced NSCLC, which extends their previous application of ROCO to prostate cancer IMRT planning.""","""['Hans Stabenau', 'Linda Rivera', 'Ellen Yorke', 'Jie Yang', 'Renzhi Lu', 'Richard J Radke', 'Andrew Jackson']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Reduced-order constrained optimization (ROCO): clinical application to head-and-neck IMRT.', 'Impact of dose calculation accuracy during optimization on lung IMRT plan quality.', 'Reducing dose to the lungs through loosing target dose homogeneity requirement for radiotherapy of non small cell lung cancer.', 'Planning evaluation of radiotherapy for complex lung cancer cases using helical tomotherapy.', 'Reduced-order constrained optimization in IMRT planning.', 'On the optimal number of dose-limiting shells in the SBRT auto-planning design for peripheral lung cancer.', 'Multiobjective, Multidelivery Optimization for Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning.', 'Automated inverse optimization facilitates lower doses to normal tissue in pancreatic stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Esophagus and Contralateral Lung-Sparing IMRT for Locally Advanced Lung Cancer in the Community Hospital Setting.', 'A novel reduced-order prioritized optimization method for radiation therapy treatment planning.']"""

US waves travel at different speeds in different human tissues. Conventional US-based imaging systems assume that SOS is constant in all tissues at 1540 m/s which is an accepted average value for soft tissues. This assumption leads to errors of up to a few millimeters when converting echo times into distances and is a source of systematic errors and image distortion in quantitative US imaging.  Methods:   At simulation, US applications for IGRT provide a computed tomography (CT) image coregistered to a US volume. The CT scan provides the physical density which can be used in an empirical relationship with SOS. This can be used to correct for different SOS in different tissues within the patient. For each US scan line each voxel's axial dimension is rescaled according to the SOS associated to it. This SOS correction method was applied to US scans of a PMMA container filled with either water, a 20% saline water solution or sunflower oil, and the results were compared to the CT. The correction was also applied to an US quality assurance (QA) phantom containing rods with high ultrasound contrast. This phantom was scanned with US through a container filled with the same three liquids. Finally, the algorithm was applied to two clinical cases: a prostate cancer patient and a breast cancer patient.  Results:   After the correction was applied to the phantom images, spatial registration between the bottom of the phantom in the US scan and in the CT scan was improved; the difference was reduced from a few millimeters to less than one millimeter for all three different liquids. Reference structures in the QA phantom appeared at more closely corresponding depths in the three cases after the correction, within 0.5 mm. Both clinical cases showed small shifts, up to 3 mm, in the positions of anatomical structures after correction.  Conclusions:   The SOS correction presented increases quantitative accuracy in US imaging which may lead to small but systematic improvements in patient positioning.""","""['Davide Fontanarosa', 'Skadi van der Meer', 'Emma Harris', 'Frank Verhaegen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['On the significance of density-induced speed of sound variations on US-guided radiotherapy.', 'A speed of sound aberration correction algorithm for curvilinear ultrasound transducers in ultrasound-based image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Phantom validation of coregistration of PET and CT for image-guided radiotherapy.', 'X-ray-based attenuation correction for positron emission tomography/computed tomography scanners.', 'Implementation and clinical use of portal imaging.', 'Reconstruction of thermoacoustic emission sources induced by proton irradiation using numerical time reversal.', 'An ultrasound based platform for image-guided radiotherapy in canine bladder cancer patients.', 'Initial phantom study on estimation of speed of sound in medium using coherence among received echo signals.', 'The Use of Ultrasound Imaging in the External Beam Radiotherapy Workflow of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Acoustic-based proton range verification in heterogeneous tissue: simulation studies.']"""

The task is to reduce noise and to improve the contrast of the elasticity map.  Methods:   The protocol of the CrW approach was first tested on heterogeneous elastic phantoms as a model of prostate cancers. Then, the contrast-to-noise ratio of the estimation was calculated iteratively with various sequences of algorithms to determine the optimal signal processing settings. Finally, the optimized signal processing was applied to ex vivo prostate cancer detection. The comparison of the segmented elasticity map and the histology tumor outline was made by quadrants to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the protocol. Furthermore, the CrW approach was combined with amplitude-sonoelastography to achieve a higher specificity.  Results:   This study demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach for clinical applications. In the application to ex vivo prostate cancer detection, the established approach was tested on 43 excised prostate glands. The combination of the CrW approach and amplitude-sonoelastography achieved an accuracy of over 80% for finding tumors larger than 4 mm in diameter. The elasticity values and contrast found by the CrW approach were in agreement with the previous results derived from mechanical testing.

Eleven catheters were inserted and used for dose delivery from 192Ir radioactive source, while two others were used to mimic dosimetry at the rectum wall and in the urethra using a PSD. The measured dose and dose rate data were compared to the expected values from the planning system. The importance of removing stem effects from in vivo dosimetry using a PSD during 192Ir HDR brachytherapy treatments was assessed. Applications for dwell position error detection and temporal verification of the treatment delivery were also investigated.  Results:   In-phantom dosimetry measurements of the treatment plan led to a ratio to the expected dose of 1.003 +/- 0.004 with the PSD at different positions in the urethra and 1.043 +/- 0.003 with the PSD inserted in the rectum. Verification for the urethra of dose delivered within each catheter and at specific dwell positions led to average measured to expected ratios of 1.015 +/- 0.019 and 1.014 +/- 0.020, respectively. These values at the rectum wall were 1.059 +/- 0.045 within each catheter and 1.025 +/- 0.028 for specific dwell positions. The ability to detect positioning errors of the source depended of the tolerance on the difference to the expected value. A 5-mm displacement of the source was detected by the PSD system from 78% to 100% of the time depending on the acceptable range value. The implementation of a stem effect removal technique was shown to be necessary, particularly when calculating doses at specific dwell positions, and allowed decreasing the number of false-error detections-the detection of an error when it should not be the case--from 19 to 1 for a 5% threshold out of 43 measurements. The use of the PSD system to perform temporal verification of elapsed time by the source in each catheter--generally on the order of minutes--was shown to be in agreement within a couple of seconds with the treatment plan  Conclusions:   We showed that the PSD system used in this study, which was capable of stem effect removal, can perform accurate dosimetry during 192Ir HDR brachytherapy treatment in a water phantom. The system presented here shows some clear advantages over previously proposed dosimetry systems for HDR brachytherapy, and it has the potential for various online verifications of treatment delivery quality.""","""['Francois Therriault-Proulx', 'Tina M Briere', 'Firas Mourtada', 'Sylviane Aubin', 'Sam Beddar', 'Luc Beaulieu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Technical note: removing the stem effect when performing Ir-192 HDR brachytherapy in vivo dosimetry using plastic scintillation detectors: a relevant and necessary step.', 'On the use of a single-fiber multipoint plastic scintillation detector for 192Ir high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'The evaluation of a 2D diode array in ""magic phantom"" for use in high dose rate brachytherapy pretreatment quality assurance.', 'Comparative Analysis of 60Co and 192Ir Sources in High Dose Rate Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer.', 'Physical and Dosimetric Aspects of the Iridium-Knife.', 'In Vivo Verification of Treatment Source Dwell Times in Brachytherapy of Postoperative Endometrial Carcinoma: A Feasibility Study.', 'Inorganic scintillation detectors based on Eu-activated phosphors for 192Ir brachytherapy.', 'Measurement of Total Scatter Factor for Stereotactic Cones with Plastic Scintillation Detector.', 'Ruby-based inorganic scintillation detectors for 192Ir brachytherapy.', 'Polyethylene Naphthalate Scintillator: A Novel Detector for the Dosimetry of Radioactive Ophthalmic Applicators.']"""

Each new case would be matched against others in the knowledge base. Once the best match is identified, that clinically approved plan is used to generate the new plan.  Methods:   A database of 100 prostate IMRT treatment plans was assembled into an information-theoretic system. An algorithm based on mutual information was implemented to identify similar patient cases by matching 2D beam's eye view projections of contours. Ten randomly selected query cases were each matched with the most similar case from the database of prior clinically approved plans. Treatment parameters from the matched case were used to develop new treatment plans. A comparison of the differences in the dose-volume histograms between the new and the original treatment plans were analyzed.  Results:   On average, the new knowledge-based plan is capable of achieving very comparable planning target volume coverage as the original plan, to within 2% as evaluated for D98, D95, and D1. Similarly, the dose to the rectum and dose to the bladder are also comparable to the original plan. For the rectum, the mean and standard deviation of the dose percentage differences for D20, D30, and D50 are 1.8% +/- 8.5%, -2.5% +/- 13.9%, and -13.9% +/- 23.6%, respectively. For the bladder, the mean and standard deviation of the dose percentage differences for D20, D30, and D50 are -5.9% +/- 10.8%, -12.2% +/- 14.6%, and -24.9% +/- 21.2%, respectively. A negative percentage difference indicates that the new plan has greater dose sparing as compared to the original plan.  Conclusions:   The authors demonstrate a knowledge-based approach of using prior clinically approved treatment plans to generate clinically acceptable treatment plans of high quality. This semiautomated approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of the treatment planning process while ensuring that high quality plans are developed.""","""['Vorakarn Chanyavanich', 'Shiva K Das', 'William R Lee', 'Joseph Y Lo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A knowledge-based approach to improving and homogenizing intensity modulated radiation therapy planning quality among treatment centers: an example application to prostate cancer planning.', 'Use of deformed intensity distributions for on-line modification of image-guided IMRT to account for interfractional anatomic changes.', 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy for pancreatic and prostate cancer using pulsed low-dose rate delivery techniques.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Knowledge-based computer systems for radiotherapy planning.', 'Simultaneous dose distribution and fluence prediction for nasopharyngeal carcinoma IMRT.', 'Combining distance and anatomical information for deep-learning based dose distribution predictions for nasopharyngeal cancer radiotherapy planning.', 'Prediction of dose deposition matrix using voxel features driven machine learning approach.', 'Validation of RapidPlan Knowledge-Based Model for Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Knowledge-based planning for multi-isocenter VMAT total marrow irradiation.']"""

This is performed by applying them on three different cancer types and treatment plans of different conformalities. Furthermore, their usefulness is examined in conjunction with traditionally applied radiobiological and dosimetric treatment plan evaluation criteria.  Methods:   Three different cancer types (head and neck, breast and prostate) were selected to quantify the benefits of the proposed treatment plan evaluation method. In each case, conventional conformal radiotherapy (CRT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment configurations were planned. Iso-probability of response charts was produced by calculating the response probability in every voxel using the linear-quadratic-Poisson model and the dose-response parameters of the corresponding structure to which this voxel belongs. The overall probabilities of target and normal tissue responses were calculated using the Poisson and the relative seriality models, respectively. The 3D dose distribution converted to a 2 Gy fractionation, D2(GY) and iso-BED distributions are also shown and compared with the proposed methodology. Response-probability volume histograms (RVH) were derived and compared with common dose volume histograms (DVH). The different dose distributions were also compared using the complication-free tumor control probability, P+, the biologically effective uniform dose, D, and common dosimetric criteria.  Results:   3D Iso-probability of response distributions is very useful for plan evaluation since their visual information focuses on the doses that are likely to have a larger clinical effect in that particular organ. The graphical display becomes independent of the prescription dose highlighting the local radiation therapy effect in each voxel without the loss of important spatial information. For example, due to the exponential nature of the Poisson distribution, cold spots in the target volumes or hot spots in the normal tissues are much easier to be identified. Response-volume histograms, as DVH, can also be derived and used for plan comparison. RVH are advantageous since by incorporating the radiobiological properties of each voxel they summarize the 3D distribution into 2D without the loss of relevant information. Thus, more clinically relevant radiobiological objectives and constraints could be defined and used in treatment planning optimization. These measures become increasingly important when dose distributions need to be designed according to the microscopic biological properties of tumor and normal tissues.  Conclusions:   The proposed methods do not aim to replace quantifiers like the probabilities of total tissue response, which ultimately are the quantities of interest to evaluate treatment success. However, iso-probability of response charts and response-probability volume histograms illustrates more clearly the difference in effectiveness between different treatment plans than the information provided by alternative dosimetric data. The use of 3D iso-probability of response distributions could serve as a good descriptor of the effectiveness of a dose distribution indicating primarily the regions in a tissue that dominate its response.""","""['Panayiotis Mavroidis', 'Brigida Costa Ferreira', 'Maria do Carmo Lopes']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Analysis of fractionation correction methodologies for multiple phase treatment plans in radiation therapy.', 'Radiobiologic comparison of helical tomotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, and conformal radiotherapy in treating lung cancer accounting for secondary malignancy risks.', 'The linear-quadratic transformation of dose-volume histograms in fractionated radiotherapy.', 'Conformal index and radiotherapy.', 'Identifying MRI markers associated with early response following laser ablation for neurological disorders: preliminary findings.', 'Beam path toxicity in candidate organs-at-risk: assessment of radiation emetogenesis for patients receiving head and neck intensity modulated radiotherapy.']"""

In this respect, denosumab mimics osteoprotegerin, the endogenous antagonist of RANKL. Recently, denosumab has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) and treatment-induced bone loss in breast and prostate cancer patients undergoing hormone ablation. Oncologic indications affecting bone are promising, but still under clinical evaluation. In clinical trials for PMO, denosumab has shown significant increases in bone mineral density (BMD) at various skeletal sites, decreases in bone turnover markers, and reductions in fracture risk. In head-tohead studies, denosumab proved to be superior to alendronate with regard to the increase in BMD. Considering clinical trial data, the risk-benefit profile of denosumab seems to be favorable since the rates of adverse events, serious adverse events, infections, malignancies and deaths were not higher compared to the control arms.

As inhibition of this pathway caused only ~50% reduction in CR growth, the goal of the current study was to identify additional RLN2-activated pathways that contribute to CR growth. Next-generation sequencing-based transcriptome and gene ontology analyses comparing LNCaP stably transfected with RLN2 versus LNCaP-vector identified differential expression of genes associated with cell proliferation (12.7% of differentially expressed genes), including genes associated with the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathways. Subsequent molecular analyses confirmed that the cAMP/PKA and NF-κB pathways play a role in facilitating H2 relaxin-mediated CR growth of CaP cells. Inhibition of PKA-attenuated RLN2-mediated AR activity inhibited proliferation and caused a small but significant increase in apoptosis. Combined inhibition of the PKA and NF-κB signaling pathways via inhibition of PKA and Akt induced significant apoptosis and dramatically reduced clonogenic potential, outperforming docetaxel, the standard of care treatment for CR CaP. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays in combination with multispectral quantitative imaging comparing RLN2 levels in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and CaP determined that RLN2 is significantly upregulated in CaP vs BPH (p = 0.002). The combined data indicate RLN2 overexpression is frequent in CaP patients and provides a growth advantage to CaP cells.

Here, we describe studies that used the mouse prostate and human prostate cancer cells as model systems to investigate signals that control subcellular localization of p44/WDR77. We observed distinct subcellular location of p44/WDR77 during prostate development. p44/WDR77 localizes in the cytoplasm at the early stage of prostate development, when prostate epithelial cells are rapidly proliferating, and in the nucleus in adult prostate, when epithelial cells are fully differentiated. Subcellular localization assays designed to span the entire open-reading frame of p44/WDR77 protein revealed the presence of two nuclear exclusion signal (NES) and three nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences in the p44/WDR77 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of critical residues within an NLS led to loss of nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of p44/WDR77, suggesting that nuclear localization of p44/WDR77 is essential for its function as a transcriptional cofactor for AR. Three identified NLS were not functional in AR-positive prostate cancer (LNCaP and 22RV1) cells, which led to localization of p44/WDR77 in cytoplasm. The function of NLS in LNCaP cells could be restored by factor(s) from Cos 7 or PC3 cells.

Further, metabolic phenotyping studies confirm higher flux through pathways associated with amino acid metabolism in prostate cancer cells treated with androgen. These findings provide insight into the potential biochemical processes regulated by androgen signaling in prostate cancer.

The role of radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer is constantly increasing as less-invasive treatment modalities are sought for the management of this widely, prevalent disease. Moreover the wide adoption of screening for prostate cancer has led to a decrease in the average age that patients are diagnosed with prostate cancer. Screening has also resulted in the diagnosis of low-grade, less-aggressive prostate cancers which would probably never lead to complications or death from the disease. Radiotherapy for prostate cancer has been linked to the late occurrence of second malignancies both in the true pelvis and outside the targeted area due to low-dose radiation scatter. Secondary malignancies following prostate irradiation include predominantly bladder cancer and, to a lesser extent, colon cancer.

The MAGE-11 gene is located at Xq28 on the human X chromosome as part of an X-linked MAGE gene family of cancer-testis antigens. MAGE-11 stabilizes AR when androgen levels are low, and functions in a transcriptional hub to promote AR-mediated gene activation. The evolutionary development and organization of the MAGE-11 gene within the cancer-testis antigen family suggests that MAGE-11 provides a gain-of-function to AR among primates in both normal physiology and cancer, and may serve as a therapeutic target in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Elizabeth M Wilson']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Ther Adv Urol""","""['Melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) enhances transcriptional activity by linking androgen receptor dimers.', 'Up-Regulation of Follistatin-Like 1 By the Androgen Receptor and Melanoma Antigen-A11 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Increased expression of androgen receptor coregulator MAGE-11 in prostate cancer by DNA hypomethylation and cyclic AMP.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Recent progress in the development of protein-protein interaction inhibitors targeting androgen receptor-coactivator binding in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Modeling Studies of Natural Inhibitors of Androgen Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Relevance of the 21-gene expression assay in male breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Pathogenicity of the MAGE family.', 'Methylation Profile of X-Chromosome-Related Genes in Male Breast Cancer.', 'MAGE-A11 Expression Predicts Patient Prognosis in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   Patients with a diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma and adequate PSA follow-up were selected for this retrospective study. Brachytherapy with permanent (125)I seeds was performed as monotherapy, with a prescribed dose of 145 Gy to the prostate. Patients were stratified into recurrence risk groups according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Biochemical failure was defined using the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines. The post-implant D90 (defined as the minimum dose covering 90% of the prostate) was obtained for each patient. Two cutoff points were used to test the correlation between D90 and bDFS results: 130 Gy and 140 Gy. bDFS was calculated from the implant date to the date of biochemical recurrence. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed using the SPSS software and included clinical stage, pretreatment PSA, Gleason score (GS), androgen deprivation therapy, D90, and risk groups. In the univariate analysis we used a cutoff point of 5.89 ng/mL for PSA and 5 for GS.  Results:   From June 2003 to April 2007, 70 patients were analyzed. The patients' distribution into recurrence risk groups was as follows: 39 patients (56%) in the low-risk group, 23 patients (33%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 8 patients (11%) in the high-risk group. At a median follow-up of 47 months (range, 19-70 months) bDFS was 88.4%, with a global actuarial 5-year bDFS of 86%.

For this reason, socio-economic factors can be used to project survival rates by means of ecological models. The present study had two main aims: to generalize to all adult patients study of the association between survival and socio-economic and healthcare technologies and related medical resources factors; to provide insights on the possible bias in giving national meaning to survival rates based on pools of regional cancer registries where national coverage is not available.  Material and methods:   The EUROCARE 3 Study provided age-standardized survival rates at 5 years from the diagnosis for 10 major cancer sites collected by 52 cancer registries from 21 European countries for the period 1990-1994. For each area and country, socio-economic and health-related variables were collected for the period 1993-1995. Multiple linear regression models were used to compute predicted survival rates in countries totally covered by registration, starting from the correlation between socio-economic and health-related variables and observed survival rates. For those areas not totally covered by cancer registry activity, a correctional parameter coming from the previous linear regression models was computed in order to estimate survival at a national level also in these countries.  Results:   Predicted survival rates were very close to the observed rates for countries totally covered by cancer registries. The estimates were also good for nations with partial national cancer registration, with less convergence in results for countries where socio-economic differences between the whole territory and the covered area were relevant.  Conclusions:   In the light of these findings, evaluation of the role of socio-economic and health-related factors and the estimation of survival is of utmost importance in order to evaluate healthcare outcomes and to support planners in allocating resources in a more effective and egalitarian way.""","""['Roberto Lillini', 'Marina Vercelli', 'Alberto Quaglia', 'Andrea Micheli', 'Riccardo Capocaccia']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Socio-economic factors and health care system characteristics related to cancer survival in the elderly.

Methods:   Expression of the candidate biomarkers was studied in sedimented urine using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in two sets of patients with and without restriction on serum PSA levels.  Results:   We confirmed that PCA3 is an independent predictor of cancer in the patients without restriction of serum PSA values (set 1, n=176, PSA=0.1-587 ng ml(-1)). However, AMACR was the only parameter that differentiated CaP from non-CaP patients with serum PSA between 3 and 15 ng ml(-1) (set 2, n=104). The area under curve (AUC) for this gene was 0.645 with both sensitivity and specificity at 65%. Further improvement was achieved by multivariate logistic regression analysis, which identified novel duplex (TRPM8 and MSMB), triplex (plus AMACR) and quadriplex (plus PCA3) models for the detection of early CaPs (AUC=0.665, 0.726 and 0.741, respectively).

Although high-throughput measurement techniques, such as transcriptional profiling, give some insight into the altered state of a cell, they fall far short of providing by themselves a complete picture. Some improvement can be made by using enrichment-based methods to, for example, organize biological data of this sort into collections of dysregulated pathways. However, such methods arguably are still limited to primarily a transcriptional view of the cell. Augmenting these methods still further with networks and additional -omics data has been found to yield pathways that play more fundamental roles. We propose a previously undescribed method for identification of such pathways that takes a more direct approach to the problem than any published to date. Our method, called latent pathway identification analysis (LPIA), looks for statistically significant evidence of dysregulation in a network of pathways constructed in a manner that implicitly links pathways through their common function in the cell. We describe the LPIA methodology and illustrate its effectiveness through analysis of data on (i) metastatic cancer progression, (ii) drug treatment in human lung carcinoma cells, and (iii) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. With these analyses, we show that LPIA can successfully identify pathways whose perturbations have latent influences on the transcriptionally altered genes.""","""['Lisa Pham', 'Lisa Christadore', 'Scott Schaus', 'Eric D Kolaczyk']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Molecular signature of response and potential pathways related to resistance to the HSP90 inhibitor, 17AAG, in breast cancer.', 'Inhibition of Heat Shock Protein 90 suppresses TWIST1 Transcription.', 'Identification of Novel Response and Predictive Biomarkers to Hsp90 Inhibitors Through Proteomic Profiling of Patient-derived Prostate Tumor Explants.', 'Drug-mediated targeted disruption of multiple protein activities through functional inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone complex.', 'Discovery and development of heat shock protein 90 inhibitors as anticancer agents: a review of patented potent geldanamycin derivatives.', 'REFINING CELLULAR PATHWAY MODELS USING AN ENSEMBLE OF HETEROGENEOUS DATA SOURCES.', 'ViLoN-a multi-layer network approach to data integration demonstrated for patient stratification.', 'CTpathway: a CrossTalk-based pathway enrichment analysis method for cancer research.', 'Comparative transcriptomic analysis reveals an association of gibel carp fatty liver with ferroptosis pathway.', 'Transcription Factor 4 Regulates the Regeneration of Corneal Endothelial Cells.']"""

Using genome-wide studies, we investigated the role of promoter-associated H2A.Z and acetylated H2A.Z (acH2A.Z) in gene deregulation and its relationship with DNA methylation and H3K27me3 in prostate cancer. Our results reconcile the conflicting reports of positive and negative roles for histone H2A.Z and gene expression states. We find that H2A.Z is enriched in a bimodal distribution at nucleosomes, surrounding the transcription start sites (TSSs) of both active and poised gene promoters. In addition, H2A.Z spreads across the entire promoter of inactive genes in a deacetylated state. In contrast, acH2A.Z is only localized at the TSSs of active genes. Gene deregulation in cancer is also associated with a reorganization of acH2A.Z and H2A.Z nucleosome occupancy across the promoter region and TSS of genes. Notably, in cancer cells we find that a gain of acH2A.Z at the TSS occurs with an overall decrease of H2A.Z levels, in concert with oncogene activation. Furthermore, deacetylation of H2A.Z at TSSs is increased with silencing of tumor suppressor genes. We also demonstrate that acH2A.Z anti-correlates with promoter H3K27me3 and DNA methylation.

Consequently, in spite of the well known skin cancer risks, some researchers advocate more exposure to ultraviolet radiation, supported by the solarium industry. We estimated the risk of internal cancer before the patient contracted a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin, the most common cancer in white populations and strongly associated with extensive sun exposure.  Methods:   A nested case control study was undertaken in the whole Swedish population. 115,016 patients with BCC and 987,893 controls were linked to population based registers.  Findings:   The cases had an increased risk of getting another form of cancer before the BCC diagnosis: odds ratio (OR)=1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.81-1.86. This risk was mainly due to skin cancer: OR=4.95; 95% CI 4.81-5.09 but also non-skin cancer risk was elevated: OR=1.37; 95% CI 1.35-1.39. We adjusted the estimates for age, level of income, occupational status in national censuses, place of living and sex, where appropriate. Of the cancers specifically suggested to be related to vitamin D status: colon, prostate, breast, and ovary cancer, all had slightly increased ORs whilst for pancreatic and gastric cancer no increased OR was found.  Interpretation:   Patients with BCC, a proxy for extensive sun exposure, run an increased risk of other forms of cancer prior to the diagnosis of BCC.

Materials and methods:   Data were collected from the TRiUS (Testim® Registry in the United States), an observational registry of hypogonadal men on testosterone replacement therapy (849). Participants were Testim naïve, had no prostate cancer and received 5 to 10 gm Testim 1% (testosterone gel) daily.  Results:   A total of 451 patients with prostate specific antigen and total testosterone values were divided into group A (197 with total testosterone less than 250 ng/dl) and group B (254 with total testosterone 250 ng/dl or greater). The groups differed significantly in free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin, but not in age or prostate specific antigen. In group A but not group B prostate specific antigen correlated significantly with total testosterone (r=0.20, p=0.005), free testosterone (r=0.22, p=0.03) and sex hormone-binding globulin (r=0.59, p=0.002) at baseline. After 12 months of testosterone replacement therapy, increase in total testosterone (mean±SD) was statistically significant in group A (+326±295 ng/dl, p<0.001; final total testosterone 516±28 ng/dl) and group B (+154±217 ng/dl, p<0.001; final total testosterone 513±20 ng/dl). After 12 months of testosterone replacement therapy, increase in prostate specific antigen was statistically significant in group A (+0.19±0.61 ng/ml, p=0.02; final prostate specific antigen 1.26±0.96 ng/ml) but not in group B (+0.28±1.18 ng/ml, p=0.06; final prostate specific antigen 1.55±1.72 ng/ml). The average percent prostate specific antigen increase from baseline was higher in group A (21.9%) than in group B (14.1%). Overall the greatest prostate specific antigen was observed after 1 month of treatment and decreased thereafter.  Conclusions:   Patients with baseline total testosterone less than 250 ng/dl were more likely to have an increased prostate specific antigen after testosterone replacement therapy than those with baseline total testosterone 250 ng/dl or greater, supporting the prostate saturation hypothesis.

However, the best approach regarding core number and location remains controversial. Transrectal saturation biopsy is believed to increase cancer detection but to our knowledge no studies comparing it to 12 to 14-core extended biopsy have been published. We compared saturation and extended repeat biopsy protocols after initially negative biopsy.  Materials and methods:   A total of 1,056 men underwent prostate biopsy after initially negative biopsy. The extended biopsy group included 393 men with 12 to 14-core repeat biopsy. The saturation biopsy group included 663 men with 20 to 24-core repeat biopsy. We analyzed demographics and prostate cancer between the 2 groups. We compared prostate cancer detection in patients with previous atypical small acinar proliferation and/or high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia as well as the risk of detecting clinically insignificant tumors.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 315 of the 1,056 patients (29.8%). Saturation biopsy detected almost a third more cancers (32.7% vs 24.9%, p=0.0075). In patients with a benign initial biopsy saturation biopsy achieved significantly greater prostate cancer detection (33.3% vs 25.6%, p=0.027). For previous atypical small acinar proliferation and/or high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia there was a trend toward higher prostate cancer detection rate in the saturation group but it did not attain statistical significance (31.2% vs 23.3%, p=0.13). Of 315 positive biopsies 119 (37.8%) revealed clinically insignificant cancer (40.1% vs 32.6%, p=0.2).

Recently studies showed wide ranges in positive surgical margin rates among individual registries, which we hypothesized was the result of coding inaccuracies. Thus, we systematically audited SEER prostate cancer data.  Materials and methods:   The New Mexico Tumor Registry, a SEER core registry, was queried for incident prostate cancer cases in 2007 that met certain criteria, including 1) adenocarcinoma histology, 2) malignant behavior and 3) radical prostatectomy as the first course of therapy. Pathological stage codes were audited by examining original radical prostatectomy pathology reports in accordance with SEER coding guidelines. The incidence and sites of positive surgical margins were critically analyzed.  Results:   Of the 305 cases that met all study inclusion criteria with complete source documents available 92 (30%) were coded incorrectly. The most common error was failure to properly account for surgical margin status (46 of 92 cases or 50%). The incidence of positive surgical margins in organ confined disease cases was 13% by SEER coding rules but 28% by a more clinical definition of positive surgical margins (p<0.001). In organ confined cases positive surgical margins occurred principally at the apex but in nonorgan confined cases most were multifocal.  Conclusions:   In this SEER registry 30% of radical prostatectomy cases in 2007 were coded inaccurately. SEER coding guidelines result in underestimating the positive surgical margin incidence.

Cox regression multivariable analysis was performed to assess whether known prostate cancer prognostic factors, history of coronary artery revascularization for cardiovascular disease, age, Charlson comorbidity score and prostate cancer treatment were associated with the risk of death.  Results:   Despite a significantly higher Charlson comorbidity score (p<0.001) due to a higher rate of prior myocardial infarction, the risk of death was significantly lower (adjusted hazard ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.82, p<0.001) in men who underwent revascularization.

Materials and methods:   The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice is a 1-page, 16-item questionnaire that we constructed to measure urinary incontinence, urinary irritation, and the bowel, sexual and hormonal health related quality of life domains. We eliminated conceptually overlapping items from the 3-page Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 and revised the questionnaire format to mirror the AUA symptom index, thereby enabling practitioners to calculate health related quality of life scores at the point of care. We administered the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice to a new cohort of patients with prostate cancer in community based and academic oncology, radiation, and urology practices to evaluate instrument validity as well as ease of use in clinical practice.  Results:   A total of 175 treated and 132 untreated subjects with prostate cancer completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice. The domain scores of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice correlated highly with the respective domain scores from longer versions of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (r≥0.93 for all domains). The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0.64-0.84) and sensitivity to prostate cancer treatment related effects (p<0.05 in each of 5 health related quality of life domains).

Although localized prostate cancer can be effectively treated via surgery or radiation, metastatic disease is usually lethal. Recent evidence suggests that the development and progression of human prostate cancer involves complex interplay between epigenetic alterations and genetic defects. We have recently demonstrated that Nrf2, a master regulator of cellular antioxidant defense systems, was epigenetically silenced during the progression of prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP mice. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of curcumin (CUR), a dietary compound that we have reported to be able to prevent the development of prostate cancer in TRAMP mice, as a DNA hypomethylation agent. Using bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS), treatment of TRAMP C1 cells we showed that CUR reversed the methylation status of the first 5 CpGs in the promoter region of the Nrf2 gene. Methylation DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) analysis revealed that CUR significantly reduced the anti-mecyt antibody binding to the first 5 CpGs of the Nrf2 promoter, corroborated the BGS results. Demethylation of Nrf2 was found to be associated with the re-expression of Nrf2 and one of its downstream target gene, NQO-1, one of the major anti-oxidative stress enzymes, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, our current study suggests that CUR can elicit its prostate cancer chemopreventive effect, potentially at least in part, through epigenetic modification of the Nrf2 gene with its subsequent induction of the Nrf2-mediated anti-oxidative stress cellular defense pathway.""","""['Tin Oo Khor', 'Ying Huang', 'Tien-Yuan Wu', 'Limin Shu', 'Jonghun Lee', 'Ah-Ng Tony Kong']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Epigenetics Reactivation of Nrf2 in Prostate TRAMP C1 Cells by Curcumin Analogue FN1.', 'Sulforaphane enhances Nrf2 expression in prostate cancer TRAMP C1 cells through epigenetic regulation.', 'Epigenetic reactivation of Nrf2 in murine prostate cancer TRAMP C1 cells by natural phytochemicals Z-ligustilide and Radix angelica sinensis via promoter CpG demethylation.', 'Curcumin Activates the Nrf2 Pathway and Induces Cellular Protection Against Oxidative Injury.', 'NRF2 modulation in TRAMP mice: an in vivo model of prostate cancer.', 'Modulation of the activity of histone lysine methyltransferases and demethylases by curcumin analog in leukaemia cells.', 'Oxidative stress-mediated beta cell death and dysfunction as a target for diabetes management.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'Comprehensive overview of Nrf2-related epigenetic regulations involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury.', 'Mangiferin exerts neuroprotective activity against lead-induced toxicity and oxidative stress via Nrf2 pathway.']"""

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the clinico-pathological value of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) expression, namely MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4, together with CD147 and gp70 as MCT1/4 and MCT2 chaperones, respectively, in prostate carcinoma.  Methods:   Prostate tissues were obtained from 171 patients, who performed radical prostatectomy and 14 patients who performed cystoprostatectomy. Samples and clinico-pathological data were retrieved and organized into tissue microarray (TMAs) blocks. Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in neoplastic (n = 171), adjacent non-neoplastic tissues (n = 135), PIN lesions (n = 40) and normal prostatic tissue (n = 14). Protein expression was correlated with patients' clinicopathologic characteristics.  Results:   In the present study, a significant increase of MCT2 and MCT4 expression in the cytoplasm of tumour cells and a significant decrease in both MCT1 and CD147 expression in prostate tumour cells was observed when compared to normal tissue. All MCT isoforms and CD147 were expressed in PIN lesions. Importantly, for MCT2 and MCT4 the expression levels in PIN lesions were between normal and tumour tissue, which might indicate a role for these MCTs in the malignant transformation.

KLKs are considered to have potential as prognostic biomarkers for hormone dependent cancers, particularly ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in hormone response elements and ovarian cancer survival. DNA samples were analyzed from 304 Australian women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer. The KLK3 rs266882 and rs11084033 SNPs were genotyped by the Sequenom iPLEX Mass Array platform. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox regression models. An association was observed with ovarian cancer survival for homozygote carriers of the rare allele of rs11084033 (adjusted HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.08-4.15). This finding is consistent with bioinformatic analysis predicting the rs11084033 rare allele to be responsible for the loss of a confirmed androgen response element, and with published expression data suggesting that aggressive ovarian cancers show decreased KLK3 tumor expression. The rs11084033 has potential prognostic significance in ovarian cancer.

Using the vibration sonoelastography technique, the spectral variance image reveals a moving interference pattern. It has been shown that the speed of the moving interference pattern, i.e., the crawling wave speed, is proportional to the shear wave speed with a nonlinear factor. This factor can generate high-speed artifacts in the crawling wave speed images that do not actually correspond to increased stiffness. In this paper, an inverse algorithm is developed to reconstruct both the crawling wave speed and the shear wave speed using the phases of the crawling wave and the shear wave. The feature for the data is the application to in vitro prostate data, while the features for the algorithm include the following: (1) A directional filter is implemented to obtain a wave moving in only one direction; and (2) an L(1) minimization technique with physics inspired constraints is employed to calculate the phase of the crawling wave and to eliminate jump discontinuities from the phase of the shear wave. The algorithm is tested on in vitro prostate data measured at the Rochester Center for Biomedical Ultrasound and University of Rochester. Each aspect of the algorithm is shown to yield image improvement. The results demonstrate that the shear wave speed images can have less artifacts than the crawling wave images.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the aberrant responses to androgen are not fully understood. Here, we apply state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methods to investigate the phosphoproteome profiles in ARCaP cells. Because protein biological phosphorylation is always substoichiometric and the ionization efficiency of phosphopeptides is low, selective enrichment of phosphorylated proteins/peptides is required for mass spectrometric analysis of phosphorylation from complex biological samples. Therefore, we compare the sensitivity, efficiency, and specificity for three established enrichment strategies: calcium phosphate precipitation (CPP), immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), and TiO(2)-modified metal oxide chromatography. Calcium phosphate precipitation coupled with the TiO(2) approach offers the best strategy to characterize phosphorylation in ARCaP cells. We analyzed phosphopeptides from ARCaP cells by LC-MS/MS with a hybrid LTQ/FT-ICR mass spectrometer. After database search and stringent filtering, we identified 385 phosphoproteins with an average peptide mass error of 0.32 ± 0.6 ppm.

Patients and methods:   We studied all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer at the Urological Oncology Clinic, Tygerberg Hospital, from January 1995 to December 2005. Most presented symptomatically as PSA screening is not readily available in the referral area of the hospital. Race was self-defined as white, coloured or black. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test or Fisher's exact test, where appropriate. A two-tailed p-value <0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.  Results:   There were 901 patients: 291 (32.3%) white, 539 (59.8%) coloured and 71 (7.9%) black. Mean age at presentation was significantly higher in the white than the coloured and black groups (69.7, 67.9 and 68.9 years, respectively). Grade 1 adenocarcinoma was most common in the white (37%) and coloured groups (38%), and grade 2 was most common in the black group (39%). There was a significantly lower percentage of patients with T3-4 disease at diagnosis in the white group (47%) than the coloured (61%) and black (62%) groups. Mean serum PSA at diagnosis was significantly higher in the black than the coloured and white groups (766.1,673.3 and 196.1 ng/ml, respectively). Potentially curative therapy (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy) was chosen by 31% of white, 23% of coloured and only 12% of black patients. The mean duration of follow-up was significantly shorter in the black than in the white or coloured groups (24.0, 31.5 and 35.0 months, respectively).  Conclusions:   Black men presented with higher grade and stage disease and higher serum PSA, received potentially curative treatment less often, and had a shorter follow-up (probably owing to shorter survival) than the white and coloured groups.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed various preoperative clinical and biopsy findings of 225 consecutive patients who underwent prostatectomy from October 2007 to June 2010. The indication for biopsy was placed in presence of an abnormal rectal examination and/or suspected transrectal ultrasound and/or PSA >4 ng/ml. We consider insignificant a tumor with a volume ≤5% of the entire gland with a Gleason score ≤ 6, with no grades 4 or 5 and organ confined.  Results:   The prevalence of potentially insignificant PCa in our experience was 12%. The preoperative findings of patients with insignificant PCa were significantly more favorable than the remaining cases with PCa not insignificant.

In the present report, we investigated the effect of celastrol on proliferation of various cancer cell lines. The mechanism, by which this triterpene exerts its apoptotic effects, was also examined in detail. We found that celastrol inhibited the proliferation of wide variety of human tumor cell types including multiple myeloma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, melanoma, glioma, and breast cancer with concentrations as low as 1 μM. Growth inhibitory effects of celastrol correlated with a decrease in the levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, but concomitant increase in the levels of p21 and p27. The apoptosis induced by celastrol was indicated by the activation of caspase-8, bid cleavage, caspase-9 activation, caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage and through the down regulation of anti-apoptototic proteins. The apoptotic effects of celastrol were preceded by activation of JNK and down-regulation of Akt activation. JNK was needed for celastrol-induced apoptosis, and inhibition of JNK by pharmacological inhibitor abolished the apoptotic effects. Overall, our results indicate that celastrol can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through the activation of JNK, suppression of Akt, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein expression.""","""['Radhamani Kannaiyan', 'Kanjoormana Aryan Manu', 'Luxi Chen', 'Feng Li', 'Peramaiyan Rajendran', 'Aruljothi Subramaniam', 'Paula Lam', 'Alan Prem Kumar', 'Gautam Sethi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Apoptosis""","""['Guggulsterone inhibits tumor cell proliferation, induces S-phase arrest, and promotes apoptosis through activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, suppression of Akt pathway, and downregulation of antiapoptotic gene products.', 'Celastrol induces apoptosis in non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cells through activation of mitochondria- and Fas/FasL-mediated pathways.', 'Celastrol inhibits growth and induces apoptotic cell death in melanoma cells via the activation ROS-dependent mitochondrial pathway and the suppression of PI3K/AKT signaling.', 'Celastrol as an emerging anticancer agent: Current status, challenges and therapeutic strategies.', 'Molecular targets of celastrol derived from Thunder of God Vine: potential role in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and cancer.', 'Celastrol elicits antitumor effects by inhibiting the STAT3 pathway through ROS accumulation in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'A brief overview of antitumoral actions of bruceine D.', 'Induction of the ER stress response in NRVMs is linked to cardiotoxicity caused by celastrol.', 'Emerging Mechanisms and Targeted Therapy of Pyroptosis in Central Nervous System Trauma.', 'Celastrol Alleviates Autoimmune Hepatitis Through the PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway Based on Network Pharmacology and Experiments.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between 1997 and 2007, 301 prostate cancer patients received SRT after RP at the Charité - University Medicine Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin. None of the patients had antihormone therapy prior to SRT. A total of 234 patients received 66.6 Gy. From 2002 on, 67 patients with a PSA decrease during SRT were irradiated with 70.2 Gy. The influence of this selection and dose escalation on freedom from biochemical progression (bNED) was analyzed.  Results:   The median follow-up of the whole group was 30 months, the median pre-SRT PSA was 0.28 ng/ml.

However, a significant proportion of patients tend to relapse early, with the emergence of biochemical failure (BF) as an established precursor of progression to metastatic disease. Several candidate molecular markers have been studied in an effort to enhance the accuracy of existing predictive tools regarding the risk of BF after RP. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of p53, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cyclin D1 in a cohort of 70 patients that underwent RP for early stage, hormone naïve PCa, with the aim of prospectively identifying any possible interrelations as well as correlations with known prognostic parameters such as Gleason score, pathological stage and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse. We observed a significant (p = 0.003) prognostic role of p53, with high protein expression correlating with shorter time to BF (TTBF) in univariate analysis. Both p53 and COX-2 expression were directly associated with cyclin D1 expression (p = 0.055 and p = 0.050 respectively). High p53 expression was also found to be an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.023). Based on previous data and results provided by this study, p53 expression exerts an independent negative prognostic role in localized prostate cancer and could therefore be evaluated as a useful new molecular marker to be added in the set of known prognostic indicators of the disease.

Fears that authority will be lost are unfounded as long as responsibility for this task is taken seriously and active use is made of the possibilities for creativity. A similarly important function is fulfilled by the testicular cancer centers that offer second opinion services, which were initiated by urology conjointly with German Cancer Aid to pursue the goal of quality assurance for this tumor entity and therefore likewise secure the position of this tumor in the realm of urologists.

Moreover, gene transcriptional activity was also measured by nuclear run-on experiments. We demonstrated an increase of BCL-2 mRNA expression in patients who underwent neoadjuvant ADT for 1 month in comparison to patients who had not received any therapy. Moreover, we demonstrated that there were no significant modifications of BCL-2 mRNA levels in patients who underwent neoadjuvant ADT for 3 and 6 months. Furthermore, BCL-2 protein levels in patients who underwent neoadjuvant ADT for 1 month were upregulated in comparison to patients who had not received any therapy. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a strong positivity of prostate cells depending on ADT administration for 1 month. Finally, transcriptional activity was not modified in patients who underwent neoadjuvant ADT, suggesting the absence of hormonal regulation on BCL-2 gene expression at the transcriptional level. Our data show that short-term administration of ADT interferes with BCL-2 expression, suggesting that androgen-mediated mechanisms may act through BCL-2-mediated apoptotic pathways.

Pathological characteristics of patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria under three active surveillance criteria--those of the University of California-San Francisco, the National Cancer Institute and the European Association of Urology--were examined. The proportion of men who were deemed candidates for active surveillance but were subsequently upstaged or upgraded was determined.

Upgrading (Gleason scores 7-10) ranged from 32.8% to 38.6%, while upstaging (≥pT3) ranged from 10.2% to 12.5%, depending on the three active surveillance criteria. After a median follow-up of 24 months, three patients developed a biochemical recurrence. When the impact of varying PSA levels was examined using a test for trend analysis in the context of PSA for each protocol, rates of upstaging were lower in men with PSA <4 ng ml(-1).

Methods:   We used a retrospective cohort of 833 African American and white, non-Hispanic men diagnosed with prostate cancer at four Chicago area medical centers between 1986 and 1990. Tract-level concentrated disadvantage (CD), a multidimensional area-based measure of SES, was calculated for each case, using the 1990 U.S. census data. Its association with prostate cancer-specific survival was measured by using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for case and tumor characteristics, treatment, and health care system [private sector vs. Veterans Health Administration (VA)].  Results:   Tract-level CD associated with an increased risk of death from prostate cancer (highest vs. lowest quartile, HR = 2.37, P < 0.0001). However, the association was observed in the private sector and not in the VA (per 1 SD increase, HR = 1.33, P < 0.0001 and HR = 0.93, P = 0.46, respectively).

Materials and methods:   The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 9 registry database from 1973 to 1999 (SEER) was reviewed for patients with initial primary cancers in oral cavity and pharynx, colon and rectum, respiratory system, breast, prostate, testis, or penis. This group of patients was then examined to identify subsequent separate primary malignancies in the bladder. Comparison was made to the incidence of bladder cancer in the general population to determine a standardized incidence ratio (SIR). Additional analysis was performed based on age at diagnosis, stage, gender, race, and use of external beam radiation for treatment of initial cancer.  Results:   A total of 7,289 (0.5%) of patients had a bladder cancer following their initial malignancy. Patients with prostate cancer had the largest increase in risk of bladder cancer with a SIR of 8.24, and all initial cancer groups had an elevated risk of bladder cancer relative to the general population. External beam radiation and non-White gender were associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Older age at diagnosis of the initial cancer correlated with a lower risk of subsequent bladder cancer.  Conclusions:   This study suggests an increased risk of bladder cancer following a separate initial cancer.

This study evaluated the potential activity of lapatinib in men with biochemically-relapsed androgen-dependent (stage D0) prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Patients with a rising PSA after primary therapy for prostate cancer were enrolled. A PSA doubling time (PSADT) <12 months was required. Lapatinib was administered at 1,500 mg orally daily. Outcome measures were changes in PSA kinetics. Primary tumor blocks were obtained and assessed for EGFR expression, EGFR Q787Q polymorphism, and Kras 38 mutational status.  Results:   Forty-nine patients were enrolled (14 ineligible), resulting in 35 patients for analysis. No PSA response was observed; best response was stable disease (n = 28, 80.0%). Pretreatment average slope was 0.19 log (PSA)/month (PSADT = 3.70 months), in contrast to on-treatment average slope of 0.13 log (PSA)/month (PSADT = 5.44 months) using linear mixed effects models (P = 0.006). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 17.4 months for the high EGFR group and 6.0 months for the low EGFR group (P = 0.50). Patients with Kras 38 mutation had shorter PFS than those without Kras 38 mutation (P = 0.09).  Conclusion:   Although no PSA responses (primary endpoint) was observed, lapatinib may have biologic activity in men with stage D0 prostate cancer as evidenced by a decrease in PSA slope in this non-randomized study.

Methods and materials:   Patients were treated exclusively with HDRB and HypoRT. HDRB delivered a dose of 10 Gy to the prostate surface and HypoRT consisted of 50 Gy delivered in 20 daily fractions. The first 121 consecutive patients with a minimum of 2 years posttreatment follow-up were assessed for toxicity and disease control.  Results:   The median follow-up was 65.2 months. No acute Grade III or higher toxicity was seen. Late Grade II gastrointestinal toxicity was seen in 9 patients (7.4%) and Grade III in 2 (1.6%). Late Grade III genitourinary toxicity was seen in 2 patients (1.6%).

The aim of the study was to explore karyometry as a method for monitoring the efficacy of intervention with preventive agents in patients with CaP.  Materials and methods:   The material used in this investigation was from the 2F study, i.e., an Italian prospective randomized phase IIb presurgical study of finasteride vs. low-dose flutamide vs. placebo in men with CaP. Image analysis was performed in 16 cases treated with finasteride, 24 with flutamide, and 20 with placebo. For all these cases, CaP and normal looking secretory epithelium were present in the pretreatment biopsies as well as the post-treatment ex-vivo biopsies obtained from the radical prostatectomy specimens.  Results:   To establish a direction of nuclear change from normal to malignancy, i.e., the so-called line of progression, a discriminant function was derived with the normal looking epithelium in the pretreatment biopsies as one endpoint, and the CaP in the pretreatment biopsies as the other. The discriminant function was then applied to the post-treatment groups. The increase in relative nuclear area was the dominant feature. In the placebo group, 15 out of 20 CaP (75%) cases had a higher discriminant function score at the end of study, with a significant increase of the mean score by 90%. The flutamide treated CaP cases had increased discriminant function scores in 19 out of 24 cases (79%) and an increase of the mean score by 43%; the 5 cases with lower scores involved only minor reductions. In contrast, the finasteride treated CaP cases had increased discriminant function scores for 8 out of 16 cases (50%), but the increase in the mean score was by only 8%.

Methods:   A total of 813 patients underwent RP for high-risk PCa in a national retrospective multi-institutional study. High-risk PCa was defined as follows: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level>20 ng/mL, Gleason score 8-10, and/or clinical Stage T2c-T4 disease. The preoperative criteria of high-risk PCa were studied in a logistic regression model to assess the correlations with the pathologic findings in the RP specimens. The predictive factors isolated or combined in scores were assessed by Cox multivariate and Kaplan-Meier analyses in predicting PSA failure (recurrence-free survival [RFS]) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   The median follow-up was 64 months. Organ-confined disease was reported in 36.5%. The 5-year RFS, metastasis-free survival, and OS rate was 74.1%, 96.1%, and 98.6%, respectively. Each preoperative criteria of high-risk PCa was an independent predictor of PSA failure. The PSA failure risk was increased by 1.5- and 2.8-fold in men with 2 and 3 criteria, respectively. The RFS, but not the OS, was significantly different according to the preoperative score (P<.001). The postoperative score was significantly predictive for RFS and OS (P<.001 and P<.035, respectively). The risk of PSA failure was significantly increased with an increasing postoperative score (2-4.6-fold).

Seventy separate levels were scored. The observers' CT scores were compared with the MRI findings. All scoring radiologists were specialist registrars at different stages of training.  Results:   Agreement between CT and MRI scores for metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) were high with Cohen's weighted Kappa score 0.70 (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.75). CT has a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 92% for MSCC. Half the false-positive and false-negative results came from a single junior radiologist who would not normally report CT or MRI studies unsupervised.

The present retrospective study enrolled 375 patients who had not received neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. MIE-RP was performed through a 6-cm suprapubic midline incision. A 30° laparoscope was conveniently positioned on the head side of the patient for precise observation and monitoring.  Results:   The median operating time was 119 min, and the estimated blood loss was 900 ml. The most frequent perioperative complication was leakage from the vesicourethral anastomosis (6.7%), and rectal injury occurred in 1.0%. Overall, 31.2% of the patients had a positive surgical margin, including 11.1% with pT2, 52.9% with pT3 and 100% with pT4 diseases.

Methods:   Area-specific smoothed standardised incidence ratios were estimated for priority-area cancers across 478 statistical local areas in Queensland, Australia (1998-2007, n = 186,075). For those cancers with significant spatial variation, CART models were used to identify whether area-level accessibility, socioeconomic status and ethnicity were associated with high area-specific incidence.  Results:   The accessibility of a person's residence had the most consistent association with the risk of cancer diagnosis across the specific cancers. Many cancers were likely to have high incidence in more urban areas, although male lung cancer and cervical cancer tended to have high incidence in more remote areas.

Based on the sequence characteristics, they can be divided into two major types: bacterial-type tRNase ZS and eukaryotic-type tRNase ZL, and one minor type, Thermotoga maritima (TM)-type tRNase ZS. The number of tRNase Zs is highly variable, with the largest number being identified experimentally in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. It is unknown whether multiple tRNase Zs found in A. thaliana is common to the plant kingdom. Also unknown is the extent of sequence and structural conservation among tRNase Zs from the plant kingdom.  Results:   We report the identification and analysis of candidate tRNase Zs in 27 fully sequenced genomes of green plants, the great majority of which are flowering plants. It appears that green plants contain multiple distinct tRNase Zs predicted to reside in different subcellular compartments. Furthermore, while the bacterial-type tRNase ZSs are present only in basal land plants and green algae, the TM-type tRNase ZSs are widespread in green plants. The protein sequences of the TM-type tRNase ZSs identified in green plants are similar to those of the bacterial-type tRNase ZSs but have distinct features, including the TM-type flexible arm, the variant catalytic HEAT and HST motifs, and a lack of the PxKxRN motif involved in CCA anti-determination (inhibition of tRNase Z activity by CCA), which prevents tRNase Z cleavage of mature tRNAs. Examination of flowering plant chloroplast tRNA genes reveals that many of these genes encode partial CCA sequences. Based on our results and previous studies, we predict that the plant TM-type tRNase ZSs may not recognize the CCA sequence as an anti-determinant.  Conclusions:   Our findings substantially expand the current repertoire of the TM-type tRNase ZSs and hint at the possibility that these proteins may have been selected for their ability to process chloroplast pre-tRNAs with whole or partial CCA sequences. Our results also support the coevolution of tRNase Zs and tRNA 3'-trailer sequences in plants.""","""['Lijuan Fan', 'Zhikang Wang', 'Jinyu Liu', 'Weili Guo', 'Jie Yan', 'Ying Huang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Evol Biol""","""[""Identification and sequence analysis of metazoan tRNA 3'-end processing enzymes tRNase Zs."", ""Identification and analysis of candidate fungal tRNA 3'-end processing endonucleases tRNase Zs, homologs of the putative prostate cancer susceptibility protein ELAC2."", 'The flexible arm of tRNase Z is not essential for pre-tRNA binding but affects cleavage site selection.', 'tRNase Z: the end is not in sight.', ""3' processing of eukaryotic precursor tRNAs."", 'The transcription factor OsbHLH138 regulates thermosensitive genic male sterility in rice via activation of TMS5.', 'Workable male sterility systems for hybrid rice: Genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and utilization.', 'Identification of glutathione (GSH)-independent glyoxalase III from Schizosaccharomyces pombe.', ""Partitioning of the nuclear and mitochondrial tRNA 3'-end processing activities between two different proteins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe."", ""Identification and sequence analysis of metazoan tRNA 3'-end processing enzymes tRNase Zs.""]"""

However, this therapy is associated with several undesired side-effects, including increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. To study if termination of long-term androgen ablation and restoration of testosterone levels could suppress the growth of relapsed hormone-refractory prostate tumors, we implanted testosterone pellets in castrated nude mice carrying androgen receptor (AR)-positive LNCaP 104-R2 cells, which relapsed from androgen-dependent LNCaP 104-S cells after long-term androgen deprivation. 104-R2 tumor xenografts regressed after testosterone pellets were implanted. Of 33 tumors, 24 adapted to elevation of testosterone level and relapsed as androgen-insensitive tumors. Relapsed tumors (R2Ad) expressed less AR and prostate-specific antigen. We then studied the molecular mechanism underlying the androgenic regulation of prostate cancer cell proliferation. Androgen suppresses proliferation of 104-R2 by inducing G(1) cell cycle arrest through reduction of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) and c-Myc, and induction of p27(Kip1). 104-R2 cells adapted to androgen treatment and the adapted cells, R2Ad, were androgen-insensitive cells with a slower growth rate and low protein level of AR, high levels of c-Myc and Skp2, and low levels of p27(Kip1). Nuclear AR and prostate-specific antigen expression is present in 104-R2 cells but not R2Ad cells when androgen is absent. Overexpression of AR in R2Ad cells regenerated an androgen-repressed phenotype; knockdown of AR in 104-R2 cells generated an androgen-insensitive phenotype. Overexpression of Skp2 and c-Myc in 104-R2 cells blocked the growth inhibition caused by androgens.

The network shows that PPARγ target genes are highly associated with cancer and neurological diseases. Thirty-eight PPARγ direct target genes were found to be involved in prostate cancer and two key (hub) PPARγ direct target genes, PRKCZ and PGK1, were experimentally validated to be repressed upon PPARγ activation by its natural ligand, 15d-PGJ(2) in three prostrate cancer cell lines.

This leads to significant unnecessary suffering among prostate cancer patients and massive unnecessary health care expenditures. In this study, we aim to identify glycoproteins associated with aggressive prostate cancer using optimal cutting temperature (OCT)-embedded frozen tissues obtained from patients with known clinical outcome. To eliminate the interference of mass spectrometric analysis by the compounds in OCT and identify extracellular proteins that are likely to serve as biomarkers in body fluids, we employed glycoproteomic analysis using solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides, which allowed the immobilization of glycopeptides to solid support and removal of OCT from sample proteins before releasing the glycopeptides from the solid support for mass spectrometry analysis. Tumor tissues were cryostat microdissected from four cases of aggressive and four cases of nonaggressive prostate tumors, and glycopeptides were isolated and labeled with iTRAQ reagents before the samples were analyzed with LTQ Orbitrap Velos. From the aggressive prostate cancer tissues, we identified the overexpression of three glycoproteins involved in an extracellular matrix remodeling and further examined two glycoproteins, cathepsin L and periostin, using Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. This is the first proteomic study to identify proteins potentially associated with aggressive prostate cancer using OCT-embedded frozen tissues.

Methods:   Three hundred thirty-two men with prostate cancer commencing external beam radiotherapy completed the SCNS-SF34 with revised response format, along with measures of psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and quality of life (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-short form). Exploratory factor and parallel analyses were undertaken to examine the structure of the revised instrument. Reliability analysis was performed, and convergent and divergent validity were examined using a priori predictions.  Results:   As with the original scale, a five-factor solution was indicated. Four of the five factors were identical to those reported in the original SNCS-SF34 validation study. Internal consistency was excellent, exceeding 0.8 for all five domains. Consistent with expectations, correlations between SCNS domains and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscales indicated moderate to large convergent relations (ranging from 0.31-0.67).  Conclusions:   The SCNS-SF34 with revised response format maintained the same factor structure as the original, with five domains. This analysis demonstrates that the simplified response scale does not adversely affect the psychometric properties of the instrument. The SCNS-SF34 with revised response format is reliable, valid and more acceptable to cancer patients than its predecessor.""","""['Penelope Schofield', 'Karla Gough', 'Kerryann Lotfi-Jam', 'Sanchia Aranda']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Short-form Supportive Care Needs Survey questionnaire (SCNS-SF34-J).', ""Brief assessment of adult cancer patients' perceived needs: development and validation of the 34-item Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34)."", 'Validation of the Chinese version of the short-form Supportive Care Needs Survey Questionnaire (SCNS-SF34-C).', 'Psychological Distress and Its Association with Unmet Needs and Symptom Burden in Outpatient Cancer Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Identifying the unmet supportive care needs of men living with and beyond prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'Web-Based Peer Navigation for Men with Prostate Cancer and Their Family Caregivers: A Pilot Feasibility Study.', 'Validity and reliability of the Amharic version of supportive care needs survey - short form 34 among cancer patients in Ethiopia.', 'Health-Related Internet Use Among Men With Prostate Cancer in Canada: Cancer Registry Survey Study.', 'The Preliminary Efficacy of a Technology-Based Cancer Pain Management Program Among Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors.', 'The survivorship experience for patients with metastatic melanoma on immune checkpoint and BRAF-MEK inhibitors.']"""

Methods:   Patients with T2DM were identified from the nationwide Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, and cancers were recorded from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox regression models to compare variations in cause-specific survival between cancer patients with and without T2DM.  Results:   Of the 1016,105 cancer patients, 16,123 had been hospitalized with T2DM before their diagnosis of cancer. The mortality rate was significantly higher among cancer patients with T2DM than among those without T2DM (cause-specific HR, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-1.41). There were no differences in TNM stage distribution among cancer patients with or without T2DM for the main cancers, with an exception of tumor and metastatic classifications for breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively.

It has been suggested that the high local polyamine concentrations suppress cell growth of primary prostatic carcinomas and that this growth control is lost when cancer cells metastasize. It has also been shown that the sensitivity to polyamine-induced growth arrest correlates with antizyme induction in prostate carcinoma cell lines. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of poorly metastatic (LNCaP) and highly metastatic (DU145) prostate cancer cell lines to conditional antizyme 1 over-expression. Antizyme 1 induction resulted in a marked loss of ODC activity and polyamine uptake in both cell lines. However, the proliferation of LNCaP cells was repressed by antizyme 1 induction, whereas the proliferation of DU 145 cells was not affected. Neither cell line showed any reduction in polyamine pools after manipulation nor did polyamine addition into the medium save the LNCaP cells from the growth retardation. The growth inhibition of LNCaP cells was accompanied by accumulation of cells in the G1 phase and depletion of cyclin E1 protein. These results confirm that different prostate cancer cell lines show diverse sensitivities to antizyme 1 which may not be directly polyamine related.

However, improvements in the therapeutic ratio for several disease sites are sorely needed, leading us to assess molecularly targeted therapeutics as radiosensitizers. The aim of this study was to assess the wee1 kinase inhibitor, MK-1775, for its ability to radiosensitize human tumor cells.  Experimental design:   Human tumor cells derived from lung, breast, and prostate cancers were tested for radiosensitization by MK-1775 using clonogenic survival assays. Both p53 wild-type and p53-defective lines were included. The ability of MK-1775 to abrogate the radiation-induced G₂ block, thereby allowing cells harboring DNA lesions to prematurely progress into mitosis, was determined using flow cytometry and detection of γ-H2AX foci. The in vivo efficacy of the combination of MK-1775 and radiation was assessed by tumor growth delay experiments using a human lung cancer cell line growing as a xenograft tumor in nude mice.  Results:   Clonogenic survival analyses indicated that nanomolar concentrations of MK-1775 radiosensitized p53-defective human lung, breast, and prostate cancer cells but not similar lines with wild-type p53. Consistent with its ability to radiosensitize, MK-1775 abrogated the radiation-induced G₂ block in p53-defective cells but not in p53 wild-type lines. MK-1775 also significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of radiation in vivo as shown in tumor growth delay studies, again for p53-defective tumors.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that p53-defective human tumor cells are significantly radiosensitized by the potent and selective wee1 kinase inhibitor, MK-1775, in both the in vitro and in vivo settings.

Here, we report that taxanes inhibit ligand-induced AR nuclear translocation and downstream transcriptional activation of AR target genes such as prostate-specific antigen. AR nuclear translocation was not inhibited in cells with acquired β-tubulin mutations that prevent taxane-induced microtubule stabilization, confirming a role for microtubules in AR trafficking. Upon ligand activation, AR associated with the minus-end-microtubule motor dynein, thereby trafficking on microtubules to translocate to the nucleus. Analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTC) isolated from the peripheral blood of CRPC patients receiving taxane chemotherapy revealed a significant correlation between AR cytoplasmic sequestration and clinical response to therapy.

The normal prostate development and prostate cancer progression are mediated by androgen receptor (AR). Recently, the roles of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and its activator, p35, in cancer biology are explored one after another. We have previously demonstrated that Cdk5 may regulate proliferation of thyroid cancer cells. In addition, we also identify that Cdk5 overactivation can be triggered by drug treatments and leads to apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study is to investigate how Cdk5 regulates AR activation and growth of prostate cancer cells. At first, the data show that Cdk5 enables phosphorylation of AR at Ser-81 site through direct biochemical interaction and, therefore, results in the stabilization of AR proteins. The Cdk5-dependent AR stabilization causes accumulation of AR proteins and subsequent activation. Besides, the positive regulations of Cdk5-AR on cell growth are also determined in vitro and in vivo. S81A mutant of AR diminishes its interaction with Cdk5, reduces its nuclear localization, fails to stabilize its protein level, and therefore, decreases prostate cancer cell proliferation. Prostate carcinoma specimens collected from 177 AR-positive patients indicate the significant correlations between the protein levels of AR and Cdk5 or p35. These findings demonstrate that Cdk5 is an important modulator of AR and contributes to prostate cancer growth. Therefore, Cdk5-p35 may be suggested as diagnostic and therapeutic targets for prostate cancer in the near future.""","""['Fu-Ning Hsu', 'Mei-Chih Chen', 'Ming-Ching Chiang', 'Eugene Lin', 'Yueh-Tsung Lee', 'Pao-Hsuan Huang', 'Guan-Shun Lee', 'Ho Lin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 modulates STAT3 and androgen receptor activation through phosphorylation of Ser⁷²⁷ on STAT3 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Future Aspects of CDK5 in Prostate Cancer: From Pathogenesis to Therapeutic Implications.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 acts as a critical determinant of AKT-dependent proliferation and regulates differential gene expression by the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor phosphorylation and stabilization in prostate cancer by cyclin-dependent kinase 1.', 'Posttranslational modification of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Comparison among Neuroblastoma Stages Suggests the Involvement of Mitochondria in Tumor Progression.', 'Antrodia salmonea Extracts Regulate p53-AR Signaling and Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cells.', 'Aspalathus linearis suppresses cell survival and proliferation of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of c-Myc and stability of androgen receptor.', 'Post-translational modifications of CDK5 and their biological roles in cancer.', 'Steroid Receptors in Breast Cancer: Understanding of Molecular Function as a Basis for Effective Therapy Development.']"""

To investigate the respective effects of these hormones on insulin sensitivity in men, we employed a model of experimental hypogonadism with or without hormone replacement.  Design:   Placebo-controlled, randomized trial.  Participants:   Twenty-two healthy male volunteers, 18-55 years old.  Methods:   Following screening, subjects received the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist acyline plus one of the following for 28 days: Group 1, placebo transdermal gel and placebo pills; Group 2, transdermal testosterone gel 10 g/day plus placebo pills; Group 3, transdermal testosterone gel 10 g/day plus the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole 1 mg/day to normalize testosterone while selectively reducing serum estradiol. Fasting insulin, glucose, adipokines and hormones were measured bi-weekly.  Results:   With acyline administration, serum testosterone was reduced by >90% in all subjects in Group 1. In these men, mean fasting insulin concentrations were significantly increased compared with baseline (P = 0·02) at 28 days, despite stable body weight and no changes in fasting glucose concentrations. Decreased insulin sensitivity was also apparent in the insulin sensitivity indices homeostasis model of insulin resistance (P = 0·03) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (P = 0·04). In contrast, in Groups 2 and 3, testosterone concentrations remained in the physiologic range, despite significant reduction in mean estradiol in Group 3.

Docetaxel is metabolized in the liver by hepatic CYP3A4 activity. Piperine, a major plant alkaloid/amide, has been shown to inhibit the CYP3A4 enzymatic activity in a cell-free system. Thus, we investigated whether the co-administration of piperine and docetaxel could increase docetaxel's pharmacokinetic activity in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Liver CYP3A4 enzymatic activity was measured by fluorescence. In vivo docetaxel pharmacokinetic activity was analyzed by liquid chromatography. An in vivo xenograft model of human CRPC was utilized to assess the anti-tumor effect of docetaxel when co-administered with piperine.  Results:   Inhibition of hepatic CYP3A4 activity resulted in an increased area under the curve, half-life and maximum plasma concentration of docetaxel when compared to docetaxel alone administration. The synergistic administration of piperine and docetaxel significantly improved the anti-tumor efficacy of docetaxel in a xenograft model of human CRPC.  Conclusions:   Docetaxel is one of the most widely used cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and is currently the mainstay treatment for metastatic CRPC.

Methods:   Wild type intact FVB male mice were injected by subcutaneous injection with Myc-CaP cells to establish androgen sensitive Myc-CaP tumors. Tumor bearing mice were castrated and resulting tumors serially passaged in pre-castrated FVB male mice to produce a bone fide Myc-CaP castrate resistant tumor.  Results:   Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that initial androgen sensitive Myc-CaP tumors had strong nuclear transcriptional active androgen receptor expression, as indicated by marked c-MYC staining and were highly proliferative. Castration of tumor bearing animals resulted in cytoplasmic relocation of androgen receptor concurrent with loss of transcriptional activity and tumor proliferation. Serial passaging of castrate refractory Myc-CaP in pre-castrated male FVB mice resulted in the development of a bona fide castrate resistant Myc-CaP tumor which pheno-copied the original androgen sensitive parental Myc-CaP tumor.

Therefore, the inhibition of AR function is an established therapeutic intervention. Since the expression of the AR is retained and often increased in progressive disease, AR protein down-regulation is a promising therapeutic approach against prostate cancer. We show here that the curcumin analog 27 (ca27) down-regulates AR expression in several prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods:   ca27 at low micromolar concentrations was tested for its effect on AR expression, AR activation, and induction of oxidative stress in human LNCaP, C4-2, and LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells.  Results:   ca27 induced the down-regulation of AR protein expression in LNCaP, C4-2, and LAPC-4 cells within 12 hr. Further, ca27 led to the rapid induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To further support this finding, ca27 treatment led to the activation of the cellular redox sensor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the induction of the Nrf2-regulated genes NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 and aldoketoreductase 1C1. We show that ROS production preceded AR protein loss and that ca27-mediated down-regulation of the AR was attenuated by the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine.  Conclusions:   ca27 induces ROS and mediates AR protein down-regulation through an oxidative stress mechanism of action. Our results suggest that ca27 represents a novel agent for the elucidation of mechanisms of AR down-regulation, which could lead to effective new anti-androgenic strategies for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Alexandra M Fajardo', 'Debra A MacKenzie', 'Ming Ji', 'Lorraine M Deck', 'David L Vander Jagt', 'Todd A Thompson', 'Marco Bisoffi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Piperlongumine induces rapid depletion of the androgen receptor in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Pharmacological inhibition of androgen receptor expression induces cell death in prostate cancer cells.', 'Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) down-regulates androgen receptor expression and diminishes androgenic responses in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Oxidative stress and redox signaling in CRPC progression: therapeutic potential of clinically-tested Nrf2-activators.', 'Diarylpentanoid (1,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,4-pentadiene-3-one) (MS13) Exhibits Anti-proliferative, Apoptosis Induction and Anti-migration Properties on Androgen-independent Human Prostate Cancer by Targeting Cell Cycle-Apoptosis and PI3K Signalling Pathways.', 'AR ubiquitination induced by the curcumin analog suppresses growth of temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma through disrupting GPX4-Mediated redox homeostasis.', 'Molecular Pathways Modulated by Curcumin Analogue, Diarylpentanoids in Cancer.', 'Targeting Crosstalk between Nrf-2, NF-κB and Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.']"""

This oncoprotein promotes resistance to cell death induced by oxidative stress and chemotherapy by mechanisms that remain unclear. To get insights into these mechanisms we identified candidate target stress genes of LEDGF/p75 using pathway-specific gene expression profiling in PCa cells.  Methods:   A ""Human oxidative stress and antioxidant defense"" qPCR array was used to identify genes exhibiting significant expression changes in response to knockdown or overexpression of LEDGF/p75 in PC-3 cells. Validation of array results was performed by additional qPCR and immunoblotting.  Results:   Cytoglobin (CYGB), Phosphoinositide-binding protein PIP3-E/IPCEF-1, superoxidase dismutase 3 (SOD3), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and albumin (ALB) exhibited significant transcript down- and up-regulation in response to LEDGF/p75 knockdown and overexpression, respectively. CYGB gene was selected for further validation based on its emerging role as a stress oncoprotein in human malignancies. In light of previous reports indicating that LEDGF/p75 regulates peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), and that PRDXs exhibit differential expression in PCa, we also examined the relationship between these proteins in PCa cells. Our validation data revealed that changes in LEDGF/p75 transcript and protein expression in PCa cells closely paralleled those of CYGB, but not those of the PRDXs.  Conclusions:   Our study identifies CYGB and other genes as stress genes potentially regulated by LEDGF/p75 in PCa cells, and provides a rationale for investigating their role in PCa and in promoting resistance to chemotherapy- and oxidative stress-induced cell death.""","""['Anamika Basu', 'Awa Drame', 'Ruben Muñoz', 'Rik Gijsbers', 'Zeger Debyser', 'Marino De Leon', 'Carlos A Casiano']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['LEDGF/p75 Overexpression Attenuates Oxidative Stress-Induced Necrosis and Upregulates the Oxidoreductase ERP57/PDIA3/GRP58 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting the stress oncoprotein LEDGF/p75 to sensitize chemoresistant prostate cancer cells to taxanes.', 'Expression of the stress response oncoprotein LEDGF/p75 in human cancer: a study of 21 tumor types.', 'LEDGF/p75-mediated chemoresistance of mixed-lineage leukemia involves cell survival pathways and super enhancer activators.', 'LEDGF/p75: a novel nuclear autoantigen at the crossroads of cell survival and apoptosis.', 'Impact of EcSOD Perturbations in Cancer Progression.', 'Unlike Its Paralog LEDGF/p75, HRP-2 Is Dispensable for MLL-R Leukemogenesis but Important for Leukemic Cell Survival.', 'New In Vitro Model of Oxidative Stress: Human Prostate Cells Injured with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) for the Screening of Antioxidants.', 'Twenty years of research on the DFS70/LEDGF autoantibody-autoantigen system: many lessons learned but still many questions.', 'Glucocorticoids Induce Stress Oncoproteins Associated with Therapy-Resistance in African American and European American Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Genetic scores were estimated for subjects in a Chinese case-control study (1,108 cases and 1,525 controls) based on these SNPs. To assess the performance of the genetic score on its ability to predict risk for PCa, we calculated area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in combination with 10-fold cross-validation.  Results:   The genetic score was significantly higher for cases than controls (P = 5.91 × 10(-20)), and was significantly associated with risk of PCa in a dose-dependent manner (P for trend: 4.78 × 10(-18)). The AUC of the genetic score was 0.604 for risk prediction of PCa in Chinese men. When ORs derived from this Chinese study population were used to calculate genetic score, the AUCs were 0.631 for all 33 SNPs and 0.617 when using only the 11 significant SNPs.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that genetic variants related to PCa risk may be useful for risk prediction in Chinese men. Prospective studies are warranted to further evaluate these findings.""","""['Jie Zheng', 'Fang Liu', 'Xiaoling Lin', 'Xiang Wang', 'Qiang Ding', 'Haowen Jiang', 'Hongyan Chen', 'Daru Lu', 'Guangfu Jin', 'Ann W Hsing', 'Qiang Shao', 'Jun Qi', 'Yu Ye', 'Zhong Wang', 'Xin Gao', 'Guozeng Wang', 'Lisa W Chu', 'Jun Ouyang', 'Yichen Huang', 'Yanbo Chen', 'Yutang Gao', 'Rong Shi', 'Qijun Wu', 'Meilin Wang', 'Zhengdong Zhang', 'Yanlin Hu', 'Jielin Sun', 'S Lilly Zheng', 'Xu Gao', 'Chuanliang Xu', 'Zengnan Mo', 'Yinghao Sun', 'Jianfeng Xu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Evaluation of reported prostate cancer risk-associated SNPs from genome-wide association studies of various racial populations in Chinese men.', 'Plateau effect of prostate cancer risk-associated SNPs in discriminating prostate biopsy outcomes.', 'Prediction of prostate cancer from prostate biopsy in Chinese men using a genetic score derived from 24 prostate cancer risk-associated SNPs.', 'Polygenic risk score for genetic evaluation of prostate cancer risk in Asian populations: A narrative review.', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'Identification of Germline Genetic Variants that Increase Prostate Cancer Risk and Influence Development of Aggressive Disease.', 'The incidence, mortality, and risk factors of prostate cancer in Asian men.', 'Differences in inherited risk among relatives of hereditary prostate cancer patients using genetic risk score.', 'Clinical validity and utility of genetic risk scores in prostate cancer.', 'Population-standardized genetic risk score: the SNP-based method of choice for inherited risk assessment of prostate cancer.']"""

We investigated the effects of glucan on immune cell response to prostate carcinoma.  Methods:   Dendritic cells (DC) were co-cultured with prostate carcinoma cells LNCaP and/or glucan, and maturation markers expression, cytokine release, and superoxide anion production were evaluated. Conditioned media from glucan-treated or untreated DC and/or LNCaP cultures were used to stimulate T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells.  Results:   LNCaP promoted partial DC maturation and scarce IL-12 secretion. Glucan induced DC maturation but no IL-12 production by DC. However, glucan increased IL-12 release by DC co-cultured with LNCaP. Moreover, LNCaP enhanced IL-1β, IL-23, IL-6, and TNF-α secretion, but decreased superoxide anion production in glucan-stimulated DC. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium chloride (DPI) and the superoxide anion scavenger superoxide dismutase (SOD) reproduced this effect, but did not affect IL-12 secretion. Conditioned media of glucan-treated DC/LNCaP co-cultures activated IFN-γ production by NK cells and Th1/Th17 generation by CD4(+) lymphocytes, whereas media from DC/LNCaP co-cultured without glucan produced scarce NK and CD4(+) cells responses. Experiments performed with an IL-12-blocking antibody demonstrated that these effects arise from glucan-dependent regulation of IL-12 production by DC.  Conclusions:   Glucan and LNCaP cooperate in induction of cytokine synthesis by DC. LNCaP enhance IL-1β, IL-23, IL-6, and TNF-α secretion by decreasing glucan-dependent NADPH oxidase activity, whereas glucan increases IL-12 production through NADPH oxidase-unrelated mechanisms.

In line with this, co-repressor dysfunction seems to be a major player for development of castration-resistant prostate cancer or therapy-resistant breast cancer. The molecular basis of hormone therapy by particular antihormones (antagonists) for the androgen receptor (AR) is mediated by enhanced recruitment and activity of co-repressors that cause repression of AR target genes that regulate proliferation and alteration of cancer cells. Therefore co-repressor recruitment is a crucial molecular mechanism of gene repression as well as inhibition of cancer growth.

The 518 protein kinases encoded by the human genome play a central role in various diseases, a fact that has encouraged extensive investigations on their biological function and three dimensional structures. Selenium (Se) is an important nutritional trace element involved in different physiological functions with antioxidative, antitumoral and chemopreventive properties. The mechanisms of action for selenocompounds as anticancer agents are not fully understood, but kinase modulation seems to be a possible pathway. Various organosulfur compounds have shown antitumoral and kinase inhibition effects but, in many cases, the replacement of sulfur by selenium improves the antitumoral effect of compounds. Although Se atom possesses a larger atomic volume and nucleophilic character than sulfur, Se can also formed interactions with aminoacids of the catalytic centers of proteins. So, we propose a novel chemical library that includes organoselenium compounds as kinase modulators. In this study thirteen selenocompounds have been evaluated at a concentration of 3 or 10 µM in a 24 kinase panel using a Caliper LabChip 3000 Drug Discover Platform. Several receptor (EGFR, IGFR1, FGFR1…) and non-receptor (Abl) kinases have been selected, as well as serine/threonine/lipid kinases (AurA, Akt, CDKs, MAPKs…) implicated in main cancer pathways: cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, angiogenesis regulation among them. The obtained results showed that two compounds presented inhibition values higher than 50% in at least four kinases and seven derivatives selectively inhibited one or two kinases. Furthermore, three compounds selectively activated IGF-1R kinase with values ranging from -98% to -211%. In conclusion, we propose that the replacement of sulfur by selenium seems to be a potential and useful strategy in the search of novel chemical compound libraries against cancer as kinase modulators.""","""['Daniel Plano', 'Elena Ibáñez', 'Alfonso Calvo', 'Juan Antonio Palop', 'Carmen Sanmartín']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Inhibition of constitutively activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway enhances antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1-defective breast cancer cells.', 'Selenium deficiency induces splenic growth retardation by deactivating the IGF-1R/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'Developments in selective small molecule ATP-targeting the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB.', 'Recent developments of small molecule PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors.', 'Discovery of novel anticancer therapeutics targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'New Phosphoramidates Containing Selenium as Leishmanicidal Agents.', ""Novel N,N'-Disubstituted Acylselenoureas as Potential Antioxidant and Cytotoxic Agents."", 'Selenides and Diselenides: A Review of Their Anticancer and Chemopreventive Activity.', 'Library of Seleno-Compounds as Novel Agents against Leishmania Species.', 'Antitumor activity of a rhenium (I)-diselenoether complex in experimental models of human breast cancer.']"""

Objective:   To determine the specific predictive value of the Tokuhashi scoring system (T12) and its revised version (T15) in spinal metastases of various primary tumors.  Summary of background data:   The life expectancy of patients with spinal metastases is one of the most important factors in selecting the treatment modality. Tokuhashi et al formulated a prognostic scoring system with a total sum of 12 points for preoperative prediction of life expectancy in 1990 and revised it in 2005 to a total sum of 15 points. There is a lack of knowledge about the specific predictive value of those scoring systems in patients with spinal metastases from a variety of cancer groups.  Methods:   We included 448 patients with vertebral metastases who underwent surgical treatment during November 1992 to November 2009 in Aarhus University Hospital NBG. Data were retrieved from Aarhus Metastases Database. Scores based on T12 and T15 were calculated prospectively for each patient. We divided all the patients into different groups dictated by the site of their primary tumor. Predictive value and accuracy rate of the 2 scoring systems were compared in each cancer group.  Results:   Both the T12 and T15 scoring systems showed statistically significant predictive value when the 448 patients were analyzed in total (T12, P < 0.0001; T15, P < 0.0001). The accuracy rate was significantly higher in T15 (P < 0.0001) than in T12. The further analyses by primary cancer groups showed that the predictive value of T12 and T15 was primarily determined by the prostate (P = 0.0003) and breast group (P = 0.0385). Only T12 displayed predictive value in the colon group (P = 0.0011). Neither of the scoring systems showed significant predictive value in the lung (P > 0.05), renal (P > 0.05), or miscellaneous primary tumor groups (P > 0.05). The accuracy rate of prognosis in T15 was significantly improved in the prostate (P = 0.0032) and breast group (P < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   Both T12 and T15 showed significant predictive value in patients with spinal metastases. T15 has a statistically higher accuracy rate than T12. Among the various cancer groups, the 2 scoring systems are especially reliable in prostate and breast metastases groups. T15 is recommended as superior to T12 because of its higher accuracy rate.""","""['Miao Wang', 'Cody Eric Bünger', 'Haisheng Li', 'Chunsen Wu', 'Kristian Høy', 'Bent Niedermann', 'Peter Helmig', 'Yu Wang', 'Anders Bonde Jensen', 'Katrin Schättiger', 'Ebbe Stender Hansen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Spine (Phila Pa 1976)""","""['Survival analysis of 254 patients after manifestation of spinal metastases: evaluation of seven preoperative scoring systems.', 'Estimation of life expectancy for selecting surgical procedure and predicting prognosis of extradural spinal metastases.', 'The predictive value of the Tokuhashi revised scoring system for the survival time of patients with spinal metastases.', 'Prognostic scoring systems for spinal metastases in the era of anti-VEGF therapies.', 'Comparing prognostic factors in patients with spinal metastases: a literature review.', 'Surgical Management of the Metastatic Spine Disease: A Review of the Literature and Proposed Algorithm.', 'Survival after surgery for spinal metastatic disease: a nationwide multiregistry cohort study.', 'Does knowledge of the primary tumour affect survival after surgery for spinal metastatic disease?

However, the precise role of AR in prostate cancer development and progression still remains largely unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether overexpression of AR is sufficient to induce prostate tumor formation in vivo. Here, we inserted the human AR transgene with a LoxP-stop-loxP (LSL) cassette into the mouse ROSA26 locus, permitting ""conditionally"" activated AR transgene expression through Cre recombinase-mediated removal of the LSL cassette. By crossing this AR floxed strain with Osr1-Cre (odd skipped related) mice, in which the Osr1 promoter activates at embryonic day 11.5 in urogenital sinus epithelium, we generated a conditional transgenic line, R26hAR(loxP):Osr1-Cre+. Expression of transgenic AR was detected in both prostatic luminal and basal epithelial cells and is resistant to castration. Approximately one-half of the transgenic mice displayed mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) lesions. Intriguingly, four mice (10%) developed prostatic adenocarcinomas, with two demonstrating invasive diseases. Positive immunostaining of transgenic AR protein was observed in the majority of atypical and tumor cells in the mPIN and prostatic adenocarcinomas, providing a link between transgenic AR expression and oncogenic transformation. An increase in Ki67-positive cells appeared in all mPIN and prostatic adenocarcinoma lesions of the mice. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that conditional activation of transgenic AR expression by Osr1 promoter induces prostate tumor formation in mice. This new AR transgenic mouse line mimics the human disease and can be used for study of prostate tumorigenesis and drug development.""","""['Chunfang Zhu', 'Richard Luong', 'Ming Zhuo', 'Daniel T Johnson', 'Jesse K McKenney', 'Gerald R Cunha', 'Zijie Sun']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Conditional deletion of the Pten gene in the mouse prostate induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasms at early ages but a slow progression to prostate tumors.', 'Androgen signaling is a confounding factor for β-catenin-mediated prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Stromal activation associated with development of prostate cancer in prostate-targeted fibroblast growth factor 8b transgenic mice.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Current mouse and cell models in prostate cancer research.', 'Aberrant androgen action in prostatic progenitor cells induces oncogenesis and tumor development through IGF1 and Wnt axes.', 'The role of epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) overexpression in the prognosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Androgen receptor with short polyglutamine tract preferably enhances Wnt/β-catenin-mediated prostatic tumorigenesis.', 'Aberrant activation of hepatocyte growth factor/MET signaling promotes β-catenin-mediated prostatic tumorigenesis.', 'From genomics to functions: preclinical mouse models for understanding oncogenic pathways in prostate cancer.']"""

The response is usually transient, and metastatic tumors almost invariably eventually progress as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The development of CRPC is dependent upon the intratumoral generation of the potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), from adrenal precursor steroids. Progression to CRPC is accompanied by increased expression of steroid-5α-reductase isoenzyme-1 (SRD5A1) over SRD5A2, which is otherwise the dominant isoenzyme expressed in the prostate. DHT synthesis in CRPC is widely assumed to require 5α-reduction of testosterone as the obligate precursor, and the increased expression of SRD5A1 is thought to reflect its role in converting testosterone to DHT. Here, we show that the dominant route of DHT synthesis in CRPC bypasses testosterone, and instead requires 5α-reduction of androstenedione by SRD5A1 to 5α-androstanedione, which is then converted to DHT. This alternative pathway is operational and dominant in both human CRPC cell lines and fresh tissue obtained from human tumor metastases. Moreover, CRPC growth in mouse xenograft models is dependent upon this pathway, as well as expression of SRD5A1. These findings reframe the fundamental metabolic pathway that drives CRPC progression, and shed light on the development of new therapeutic strategies.""","""['Kai-Hsiung Chang', 'Rui Li', 'Mahboubeh Papari-Zareei', 'Lori Watumull', 'Yan Daniel Zhao', 'Richard J Auchus', 'Nima Sharifi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Prostate cancer: DHT bypasses testosterone to drive progression to castration resistance.', 'The 5α-androstanedione pathway to dihydrotestosterone in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dihydrotestosterone synthesis from adrenal precursors does not involve testosterone in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Direct Metabolic Interrogation of Dihydrotestosterone Biosynthesis from Adrenal Precursors in Primary Prostatectomy Tissues.', 'Evidence of limited contributions for intratumoral steroidogenesis in prostate cancer.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The potential role of the microbiota in prostate cancer pathogenesis and treatment.', 'Regulatory genes in the androgen production, uptake and conversion (APUC) pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', '5-alpha reductase inhibitors use in prostatic disease and beyond.', 'Disruption of CCL2 in Mesenchymal Stem Cells as an Anti-Tumor Approach against Prostate Cancer.']"""

This serpin was previously detected in human milk as complexes with matriptase, a membrane-bound serine protease broadly expressed in epithelial and carcinoma cells, and under tight regulation by hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor (HAI)-1, a transmembrane Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor that forms heat-sensitive complexes with active matriptase. In the current study, we detect, in addition to matriptase-HAI-1 complexes, heat-resistant matriptase complexes generated by nontransformed mammary, prostate, and epidermal epithelial cells that we show to be matriptase-antithrombin complexes. These findings suggest that in addition to HAI-1, interstitial antithrombin participates in the regulation of matriptase activity in epithelial cells. This physiological mechanism appears, however, to largely be lost in cancer cells since matriptase-antithrombin complexes were not detected in all but two of a panel of seven breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer cell lines. Using purified active matriptase, we further characterize the formation of matriptase-antithrombin complex and show that heparin can significantly potentiate the inhibitory potency of antithrombin against matriptase. Second-order rate constants for the inhibition were determined to be 3.9 × 10(3) M(-1)s(-1) in the absence of heparin and 1.2 × 10(5) M(-1)s(-1) in the presence of heparin, a 30-fold increase, consistent with the established role of heparin in activating antithrombin function.

Materials and methods:   A case series of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (T1-2N0M0) at a comprehensive cancer center was assessed. Of the 1,370 eligible patients, 869 (63.34%) completed questionnaires at diagnosis (baseline) and 6 months following treatment. Patients were treated with surgery (16.8%), brachytherapy (27.6%), or external beam radiation (EBRT; 55.6%). Depressive symptoms and disease-specific QOL were assessed with established measures (i.e., Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D); sexual adjustment questionnaire (SAQ); and the American Urological Association symptom index).  Results:   A fifth of the sample (19.7%) reported clinically elevated levels of depressive symptoms at baseline. The proportion of clinically elevated levels of baseline depressive symptoms was higher among surgery patients compared with patients treated with brachytherapy or external beam radiation.

Materials and methods:   Androgen-responsive human prostate cancer LNCaP cells were employed and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was used as an androgenic mediator to induce androgen-modulated cellular events. Effects of BFA on synthesis and secretion of PSA, cell growth, and AR activity were assessed using Tandem PSA assay, trypan blue exclusion method, and AR binding assay, respectively.  Results:   BFA (30 ng/ml) dramatically (90%) blocked secretion of PSA and also reduced cell growth by >75% under non-androgen-regulated condition. Under androgen-stimulated condition using DHT (1 nM), both the cellular and secreted PSA levels as well as cell growth was significantly elevated or stimulated by DHT (compared with controls); however, BFA was capable of completely inhibiting such DHT-stimulated cellular events. In addition, AR binding assay revealed that AR activity has been drastically (~90%) diminished by BFA, likely resulting in interruption of DHT-mediated events.  Conclusions:   BFA is capable of attenuating androgenic regulation in LNCaP cells such as androgen-stimulated PSA synthesis/secretion and cell growth. This BFA-blocked androgen action appears to be primarily attributed to severe inactivation of AR with BFA because AR is a crucial factor for relaying androgenic messages (to DNA). Therefore, BFA could be considered a promising agent for a more effective treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer.""","""['Bobby Alexander', 'Andrew I Fishman', 'David Green', 'Muhammad S Choudhury', 'Sensuke Konno']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Growth inhibition of androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells with brefeldin A targeting cell cycle and androgen receptor.', 'Regulation of prostate-specific antigen by activin A in prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Androgen receptor activity at the prostate specific antigen locus: steroidal and non-steroidal mechanisms.', 'Castration-recurrent prostate cancer is not androgen-independent.', 'Research on the structure of the PSA promoter and the mechanisms of its expression regulation.', 'Brefeldin A enhances docetaxel-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in monolayer and 3D cultures.', 'Discovery Proteomics Identifies a Molecular Link between the Coatomer Protein Complex I and Androgen Receptor-dependent Transcription.']"""

Methods:   An institutional database of 1,477 RALP performed by a single surgeon was queried for AS candidates, defined as PSA <10 ng/mL, biopsy Gleason score ≤6 with a minimum of 10 biopsy cores, <3 positive cores with <50% tumor volume in a single core and clinical stage ≤T2a.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of PNI during periods of extended prostate biopsies and to determine the value of this preoperative parameter as a predictor of pathologic findings in surgical specimens and in biochemical recurrence.  Materials and methods:   Between 2001 and 2009, 599 prostate biopsies and their respective RP specimens were examined in our laboratory. The RP specimens were always examined completely. The mean age of the patients was 61 years, and the mean PSA was 6.4 ng/mL. The mean and median number of biopsy cores obtained was 14.4 and 14, respectively. PNI was identified in 105 biopsies (17.5%). We studied the ability of PNI in prostate biopsies to determine the tumor stage in surgical specimens and the relationship of PNI with biochemical recurrence during a mean follow-up time of 51.4 months.  Results:   The presence of PNI in prostate biopsies was observed in older patients (63 vs. 61 years old, P = 0.008). All of the prognostic factors determined for the RP specimens were significantly worse in patients with PNI compared with those without PNI. PNI was strongly associated with a higher pathologic stage (87% specificity, 40% sensitivity, odds ratio 4.8). Stage pT3 prostatic cancer was determined in 46 (43.8%) of 105 patients with PNI on biopsy compared to 69 (14%) of 494 patients without PNI (P = 0.01). Fifty-six (19.6%) patients had a biochemical recurrence, and PNI correlated significantly with PSA recurrence. A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference in recurrence-free survival between patients with and without PNI (45% vs. 53%, respectively, P = 0.021, log-rank test = 0.19).

The aim is to analyze if a supra-additive/synergic effect of the combined treatment on cell viability exists and to understand the molecular key-factors involved. We first hypothesized an effect of vandetanib in modulation the function of MDR1, leading to a longer retention of docetaxel inside the cell. It may also be possible that vandetanib could modulate the docetaxel-induced changes in expression of prosurvival and proapoptotic proteins, leading to a positive balance forward cell death.  Materials and methods:   We used PC3 cells either wild type (PC3wt) or with acquired resistance to docetaxel (PC3R), characterized by a higher expression of MDR1. We studied both mRNA and protein, the expression of EGF and VEGF receptors at a basal level and after each treatment, as well as the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis related genes.  Results:   Cell proliferation data suggested a supra-additive cytotoxic effect of the combination of docetaxel plus vandetanib, when given together or with the sequence vandetanib followed by docetaxel. We did not observe any effect of vandetanib on MDR1, in the PC3R cell lines, characterized by a higher pump expression than PC3wt. On the other side, we defined a number of key factors involved in the pro- and anti-survival balance, which regulation, by single drugs and/or by combined treatment, could explain the effect on cell cytotoxicity; also where there are apparently contradictory results.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that combined treatment with vandetanib and docetaxel alters the balance of proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, ultimately leading to potentiation of docetaxel-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells in vitro, irrespective of cells being sensitive or resistant to docetaxel.""","""['Martino Monteverde', 'Federica Tonissi', 'Jean-Louis Fischel', 'Marie-Christine Etienne-Grimaldi', 'Gerard Milano', 'Marco Merlano', 'Cristiana Lo Nigro']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Contrasted effects of the multitarget TKi vandetanib on docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Differential molecular mechanism of docetaxel-octreotide combined treatment according to the docetaxel-resistance status in PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Dual epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibition with vandetanib sensitizes bladder cancer cells to cisplatin in a dose- and sequence-dependent manner.', 'Vandetanib (ZD6474), a dual inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinases: current status and future directions.', 'Inhibition of P-glycoprotein functionality by vandetanib may reverse cancer cell resistance to doxorubicin.', 'Phase I study of BIBF 1120 with docetaxel and prednisone in metastatic chemo-naive hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed 197 prostate cancer patients undergoing 3DCRT for gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities, and conducted a pilot immunological study including flow cytometry and an NK cell cytotoxicity assay. Acute and late toxicities were recorded according to the RTOG and the LENT-SOMA scales, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted for factors associated with toxicity.  Results:   In the WP group, an increase of acute rectal toxicity was observed. A higher incidence of late GI/GU toxicity appeared in the PO group. Only 18 patients (WP-7.76% and PO-11.11%) suffered severe late GI toxicity, and 26 patients (WP-11.21% and PO-16.05%) severe late GU toxicity. In the majority of acute toxicity suffering patients, the diminution of late GI/GU toxicity to grade 1 or to no toxicity after radiotherapy was observed. The 3DCRT technique itself, patient age, T stage of TNM classification, surgical intervention, and some dose-volume parameters emerged as important factors in the probability of developing acute and late GI/GU toxicity. The proportion and differentiation of NK cells positively correlated during 3DCRT and negatively so after its completion with dose-volumes of the rectum and urinary bladder. T and NKT cells were down-regulated throughout the whole period. We found a negative correlation between leukocyte numbers and bone marrow irradiated by 44-54 Gy and a positive one for NK cell proportion and doses of 5-25 Gy. The acute GU, late GU, and GI toxicities up-regulated the T cell (CTL) numbers and NK cytotoxicity.  Conclusion:   Our study demonstrates the association of acute and late damage of the urinary bladder and rectum, with clinical and treatment related factors. The 3DCRT itself does not induce the late GI or GU toxicity and rather reduces the risk of transition from acute to late toxicity.

Results:   Median follow-up was 51 (0-253) months for progression. Initial treatment consisted of transurethral resection (TUR) alone (109 patients) or TUR plus BCG (54 patients). Twenty-eight patients underwent delayed treatment with BCG. Twenty-one patients in the TUR-alone group (19%) and 42 BCG-treated patients (51%) were free of disease at the end of follow-up (p < 0.001). Progression occurred in 18 BCG-treated patients (22%) versus 31 patients (41%) treated by TUR alone. The 10-year progression-free survival was 62% overall, 50% without BCG and 71% after BCG treatment (p = 0.04). BCG reduced the risk of progression by 46% (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.97). Thirteen patients (9%) experienced progression in the prostate and nine (6%) showed extravesical progression (upper urinary tract or metastases). This was independent of BCG treatment.  Conclusion:   CIS in the absence of invasive (T1) disease carried a 10-year risk of progression of 29?48%. Although BCG was effective against CIS, this effect was limited to the bladder.

Optimal progress was defined as decreasing incidence and/or improving survival accompanied by declining mortality, and deterioration as increasing incidence and/or deteriorating survival accompanied by increasing mortality rates. Optimal progress was observed in 12 of 19 cancer types among males: laryngeal, lung, stomach, gallbladder, colon, rectal, bladder, prostate and thyroid cancer, leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Among females, optimal progress was observed in 12 of 21 cancers: stomach, gallbladder, colon, rectal, breast, cervical, uterus, ovarian and thyroid cancer, leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Deterioration occurred in three cancer types among males: skin melanoma, esophageal and kidney cancer, and among females six cancer types: skin melanoma, oral cavity, pharyngeal, esophageal, pancreatic and lung cancer. Our conceptual framework limits misinterpretations from separate trends and generates a more balanced discussion on progress.""","""['Henrike E Karim-Kos', 'Lambertus A L M Kiemeney', 'Marieke W J Louwman', 'Jan Willem W Coebergh', 'Esther de Vries']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Cancer in adolescents and young adults (15-29 years): a population-based study in the Netherlands 1989-2009.', 'Trends in the incidence and death from cancer from 1989-2003 in The Netherlands.', 'Epidemiology of cancer among Hispanics in the United States.', 'Cancer in 15- to 29-year-olds by primary site.', 'Radiation Exposure From Pediatric CT Scans and Subsequent Cancer Risk in the Netherlands.', 'Five-Year Survival is Not a Useful Measure for Cancer Control in the Population: an Analysis Based on UK Data.', 'Survival for oesophageal, stomach and small intestine cancers in Europe 1999-2007: Results from EUROCARE-5.', 'A Systematic Review of the Burden of Pancreatic Cancer in Europe: Real-World Impact on Survival, Quality of Life and Costs.', 'Leukemia and brain tumors among children after radiation exposure from CT scans: design and methodological opportunities of the Dutch Pediatric CT Study.']"""

A cohort based on four groups of men (n = 34,891), according to age at cohort entry (45, 55, 65 and 75 years), with measurements of glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, haptoglobin, albumin, hemoglobin and leukocytes were selected from the Apolipoprotein Mortality Risk database. A total of 17,937 men had measurements of non-high-sensitive CRP. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze associations between inflammatory markers and PCa. A total of 49 of 12,063 men developed PCa in the age 45 group, whereas 207 of 9,940, 472 of 8,266 and 276 of 3,618 were diagnosed in the age 55, 65 and 75 groups, respectively. Mean follow-up time was 7.5 years (SD: 3.9). No markers showed an association with PCa risk, nor was there a trend by quartiles or an indication for different PCa risks by strata of hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia status. The studied markers were not found to be associated with PCa risk. These null findings might be due to methodological issues; however, it is unlikely that strong and long-lasting associations between inflammation and PCa risk were missed as this was a large database with long follow-up.

Understanding variation in surgical outcomes may identify processes that could affect the quality of surgical and postoperative care. The authors of this report examined hospital-level variation in outcomes after inpatient urologic oncology procedures.  Methods:   Patients who underwent radical cystectomy, radical nephrectomy, and radical prostatectomy were identified from the Washington State Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System for the years 2003 through 2007. The postoperative length of stay (LOS) was measured, and LOS that exceeded the 75th percentile was classified as prolonged. The occurrence of Agency for Healthcare Quality patient safety indicators (PSIs), readmissions, and deaths also were measured. Analyses were adjusted for patient age and comorbidity in random effects, multilevel, multivariable models that assessed hospital-level outcomes.  Results:   The authors identified 853 patients from 37 hospitals who underwent cystectomy, 3018 patients who underwent nephrectomy from 51 hospitals, and 8228 patients who underwent prostatectomy from 51 hospitals. Complications captured by PSIs were rare. Hospital-level variation was most profound for LOS outcomes after nephrectomy and prostatectomy (variance in prolonged LOS, 8.1% and 26.7%, respectively), thromboembolic events after nephrectomy (8% of variance), and mortality after cystectomy (7.1% of variance).  Conclusions:   Hospital-level variation confounds the care of urologic cancer patients in the state of Washington. The authors concluded that transparent reporting of surgical outcomes and local quality-improvement initiatives should be considered to ameliorate the observed variation and improve the quality of cystectomy, nephrectomy, and prostatectomy care.""","""['John L Gore', 'Jonathan L Wright', 'Kenn B Daratha', 'Kenneth P Roberts', 'Daniel W Lin', 'Hunter Wessells', 'Michael Porter']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Outcomes for urologic oncology procedures: are there differences between academic and community hospitals?', 'Hospital-level Variation in the Quality of Benign Inpatient Urologic Surgery.', 'Mortality after urologic cancer surgery: impact of non-index case volume.', 'A systematic review and critique of the literature relating hospital or surgeon volume to health outcomes for 3 urological cancer procedures.', 'Anesthesia for radical prostatectomy, cystectomy, nephrectomy, pheochromocytoma, and laparoscopic procedures.', 'Effect of Early Postoperative Rehabilitation on Length of Hospital Stay after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Saudi Oncology Society and Saudi Urology Association combined clinical management guidelines for prostate cancer 2017.', 'Benchmarking quality for renal cancer surgery: Canadian Kidney Cancer information system (CKCis) perspective.', 'Risk-adjusted outcomes in Medicare inpatient nephrectomy patients.', 'Saudi oncology society and Saudi urology association combined clinical management guidelines for prostate cancer.']"""

Recent studies have shown improvement of survival and quality of life when radiopharmaceuticals were given repeatedly or in combination with chemotherapy. We designed a phase I study combining docetaxel and (186)Re-labelled hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (HEDP) in men with CRPC and bone metastases to evaluate toxicity.  Methods:   A dose escalation schedule was designed consisting of four dose levels with a standard dosage of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) 3-weekly). (186)Re-HEDP was given in increasing activities (1,250 MBq up to 2,500 MBq) after the third and sixth cycle of docetaxel. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any grade 4 toxicity lasting more than 7 days or any grade 3 toxicity that did not recover within 10 days. Three patients were planned for each dose level expanding to six if a DLT occurred.  Results:   Fourteen patients were recruited with a median age of 64.6 years. One DLT, grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting >10 days, occurred at dose level 3 leading to expansion of this group to six. One of these patients had an episode of acute renal failure which resolved. Because of production problems of (186)Re-HEDP dose level 4 was not started.  Conclusion:   Combined therapy with docetaxel and (186)Re-HEDP is generally well tolerated in patients with CRPC metastatic to bone.

Relatively little is known about the possible interactions between these loci and the established risk factors for breast cancer.  Methods:   To assess interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and established risk factors, we prospectively collected DNA samples and questionnaire data from 8576 breast cancer case subjects and 11 892 control subjects nested within the National Cancer Institute's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). We genotyped 17 germline SNPs (FGFR2-rs2981582, FGFR2-rs3750817, TNRC9-rs3803662, 2q35-rs13387042, MAP3K1-rs889312, 8q24-rs13281615, CASP8-rs1045485, LSP1-rs3817198, COL1A1-rs2075555, COX11-rs6504950, RNF146-rs2180341, 6q25-rs2046210, SLC4A7-rs4973768, NOTCH2-rs11249433, 5p12-rs4415084, 5p12-rs10941679, RAD51L1-rs999737), and odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression to confirm previously reported associations with breast cancer risk. We performed likelihood ratio test to assess interactions between 17 SNPs and nine established risk factors (age at menarche, parity, age at menopause, use of hormone replacement therapy, family history, height, body mass index, smoking status, and alcohol consumption), and a correction for multiple testing of 153 tests (adjusted P value threshold = .05/153 = 3 × 10(-4)) was done. Case-case comparisons were performed for possible differential associations of polymorphisms by subgroups of tumor stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and age at diagnosis. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   We confirmed the association of 14 SNPs with breast cancer risk (P(trend) = 2.57 × 10(-3) -3.96 × 10(-19)). Three SNPs (LSP1-rs3817198, COL1A1-rs2075555, and RNF146-rs2180341) did not show association with breast cancer risk. After accounting for multiple testing, no statistically significant interactions were detected between the 17 SNPs and the nine risk factors. We also confirmed that SNPs in FGFR2 and TNRC9 were associated with greater risk of estrogen receptor-positive than estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (P(heterogeneity) = .0016 for FGFR2-rs2981582 and P(heterogeneity) = .0053 for TNRC9-rs3803662). SNP 5p12-rs10941679 was statistically significantly associated with greater risk of progesterone receptor-positive than progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer (P(heterogeneity) = .0028).

A secondary aim was to search for differences between these tumor classes.  Experimental design:   A tissue microarray containing samples from more than 2,800 prostate cancers with clinical data was analyzed for ERG alterations by immunohistochemistry and FISH. Results were compared with tumor phenotype, biochemical recurrence, and molecular features considered important for prostate cancer. The effect of ERG on androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription was analyzed in cell lines.  Results:   ERG expression was found in 52.4% of 2,805 cancers with a 95% concordance between ERG expression and ERG gene rearrangement detected by FISH.

Differences in AMACR, Annexin A3, Bcl2, CD10, ALCAM, chromogranin A, epidermal growth factor receptor, HER2, mTOR, p53, and synaptophysin status were significant but minimal in absolute numbers. The most striking difference was found for AR expression, which was markedly higher in ERG-positive cancers. In vitro studies showed ERG-dependent impairment of AR-mediated transcriptional activity.  Conclusions:   The striking similarities between these two types of prostate cancers rules out a major impact of ERG on tumor aggressiveness in early, not hormonally treated cancer.

Materials and methods:   Between January 2000 and December 2009, a total of 159 men with at least 2 transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) procedures and concurrent PSA measurements underwent prostate biopsy because of suspicion of prostate cancer. We measured PSAV, prostate volume velocity (PVV), PSA density (PSAD), PSAD velocity (PSADV), and PSAV per initial volume. We then classified the total group into a prostate cancer (PC) group and non-PC group, and compared the 2 groups. We investigated which variables were exact to predict prostate biopsy using univariate and multivariate analyses, and assessed the diagnostic performance using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.  Results:   PVV showed a positive correlation with initial prostate volume in the total and non-PC group; PVV showed a positive correlation with PSAV, and initial prostate volume correlated with PSAV in the non-PC group. The PC group showed smaller prostate volumes, higher PSAD, higher PSADV, higher PSAV per initial volume, and longer follow-up periods.

We determined the prevalence and severity of incontinence during sexual activity with time and the relationship between incontinence during sexual activity and stress urinary incontinence in the absence of sexual activity.  Materials and methods:   A total of 1,459 men with prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy between October 2000 and December 2007, as performed by 1 surgeon. Patients completed UCLA-PCI preoperatively, and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively. We analyzed the frequency distribution of incontinence during sexual activity and stress urinary incontinence with time. We also examined the relationship between incontinence during sexual activity and stress urinary incontinence by chi-square analysis.  Results:   The percent of patients who reported any bother from incontinence during sexual activity was 44.4% at 3 months, which decreased to 36.1% at 24 months. The percent of patients reporting major bother from incontinence during sexual activity was 22.4% and 12.1% at 3 and 24 months, respectively. Bother from incontinence during sexual activity and from stress urinary incontinence were strongly associated at all times (p<0.001). More than half of the men with major bother due to incontinence during sexual activity also reported bother from stress urinary incontinence. However, more than 10% of those with no stress urinary incontinence problem reported major bother from incontinence during sexual activity.  Conclusions:   Incontinence during sexual activity is a persistent problem for some men after radical prostatectomy. Significant incontinence during sexual activity may occur in the absence of stress urinary incontinence during nonsexual activities. Effective management of this problem requires further investigation.""","""['Sarah A Mitchell', 'Rajat K Jain', 'Juliana Laze', 'Herbert Lepor']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Prostate cancer: postprostatectomy climacturia.', 'Can sexual bother after radical prostatectomy be predicted preoperatively?

These difficulties may be amplified by physical inactivity and obesity. We propose to apply a multimodal intervention approach that targets both unmet supportive care needs and physical activity.  Methods/design:   A two arm randomised controlled trial will compare usual care to a multimodal supportive care intervention ""Living with Prostate Cancer"" that will combine self-management with tele-based group peer support. A series of previously validated and reliable self-report measures will be administered to men at four time points: baseline/recruitment (when men are approximately 3-6 months post-diagnosis) and at 3, 6, and 12 months after recruitment and intervention commencement. Social constraints, social support, self-efficacy, group cohesion and therapeutic alliance will be included as potential moderators/mediators of intervention effect. Primary outcomes are unmet supportive care needs and physical activity levels. Secondary outcomes are domain-specific and health-related quality of life (QoL); psychological distress; benefit finding; body mass index and waist circumference. Disease variables (e.g. cancer grade, stage) will be assessed through medical and cancer registry records. An economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the randomised trial.  Discussion:   This study will address a critical but as yet unanswered research question: to identify a population-based way to reduce unmet supportive care needs; promote regular physical activity; and improve disease-specific and health-related QoL for prostate cancer survivors. The study will also determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

In contrast, robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALP) require the completion of several operative steps before the devascularized prostate can be extirpated, casting doubt on the validity of this technique as a source for obtaining prostatic tissue. We seek to establish the integrity of our biobanking process by measuring the RNA quality of specimens derived from robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We describe our biobanking process and report the RNA quality of prostate specimens using advanced electrophoretic techniques (RNA Integrity Numbers, RIN). Using multivariate regression analysis we consider the impact of various clinicopathological correlates on RNA integrity.  Results:   Our biobanking process has been used to acquire 1709 prostates, and allows us to retain approximately 40% of the prostate specimen, without compromising the histopathological evaluation of patients. We collected 186 samples from 142 biobanked prostates, and demonstrated a mean RIN of 7.25 (standard deviation 1.64) in 139 non-stromal samples, 73% of which had a RIN ≥ 7. Multivariate regression analysis revealed cell type--stromal/epithelial and benign/malignant--and prostate volume to be significant predictors of RIN, with unstandardized coefficients of 0.867(p = 0.001), 1.738(p < 0.001) and -0.690(p = 0.009) respectively. A mean warm ischaemia time of 120 min (standard deviation 30 min) was recorded, but multivariate regression analysis did not demonstrate a relationship with RIN within the timeframe of the RALP procedure.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate the robustness of our protocol--representing the concerted efforts of dedicated urology and pathology departments--in generating RNA of sufficient concentration and quality, without compromising the histopathological evaluation and diagnosis of patients.

The aim of the present study was to assess the features of prostate cancer detectable by prebiopsy 3.0-Tesla MRI.  Methods:   From January 2007 through to December 2008, 116 patients who were examined by prebiopsy 3.0-Tesla MRI underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. Prostate specimens were examined to see whether the largest cancer area was the same as the area indicated on the MRI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify variables predictive of agreement between MRI and histopathological findings.  Results:   Sixty-six (56.9%) patients were suspected of having prostate cancer on the basis of MRI findings. In 49 of these patients (74.2%), it was considered that there was agreement between the abnormal area on the MRI and the index tumor. Univariate analysis revealed that there were significant differences in abnormal digital rectal examination, capsular penetration, the diameter of the index tumor of the radical prostatectomy specimen, and the Gleason scores of the biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens. Multivariate analysis revealed that the Gleason score of the radical prostatectomy specimen was associated with the accurate detection of the prostate cancer by MRI (P = 0.0177).  Conclusions:   In conclusion, 3.0-Tesla MRI tends to accurately diagnose prostate cancer with high tumor burden and aggressiveness.

In the current retrospective study, the propriety of actual decisions was assessed using preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), combining T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), numbers of positive biopsy cores, tumor volume and the Gleason score. MRI before prostate biopsy was performed in 35 patients who underwent LRP for clinically localized prostate cancer. A single radiologist retrospectively assessed whether the tumor localization, capsular penetration, seminal vesicle invasion, NVB involvement, and MRI findings correlated with the postoperative histological results. With the postoperative specimens, 83 lesions demonstrated a Gleason score of 6 or more. Using T2WI with and without DWI and ADC, 39 and 27 of 54 lesions were correctly identified, respectively, the difference being significant. For cancers in the transitional zone, using a threshold Gleason score of 3 or greater, sensitivity was also significantly higher for T2+DWI+ADC than for T2WI alone. Of 35 patients, using all available clinical information (biopsy results including Gleason score, tumor location, percentage of positive biopsy cores, and the percentage of tumor-involved core tissue), we found that the preoperative and postoperative staging were concordant in 25 cases. There is no universal consensus for nerve-sparing LRP; therefore, we performed an additional analysis using simplified clinically defined selection criteria (PSA level >15ng/mL, cT2, less than two positive biopsy scores in the unilateral lobe and less than 30% tumor volume, and a Gleason score of 6). Using this criteria, we selected 12 of 35 patients, and the detection rate of NVB involvement by MRI combined T2WI + DWI + ADC maps was 100% in their 30 lesions, and therefore we consider it safe to perform nerve-sparing LRP using our criteria. Our findings suggest that NVB can be safely preserved in patients with low-grade tumors using simplified clinically defined selection criteria to determine margin involvement.""","""['Taku Naiki', 'Takehiko Okamura', 'Daisuke Nagata', 'Yuji Mori', 'Noriyasu Kawai', 'Kumiko Ogawa', 'Hidetoshi Akita', 'Yoshihiro Hashimoto', 'Keiichi Tozawa', 'Kenjiro Kohri']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['The role of conventional and functional endorectal magnetic resonance imaging in the decision of whether to preserve or resect the neurovascular bundles during radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for the assessment of extracapsular invasion and other staging parameters in patients with prostate cancer candidates for radical prostatectomy.', 'Ability of preoperative 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging to predict the absence of side-specific extracapsular extension of prostate cancer.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'A Critical Analysis of the Current Knowledge of Surgical Anatomy of the Prostate Related to Optimisation of Cancer Control and Preservation of Continence and Erection in Candidates for Radical Prostatectomy: An Update.', 'Dosimetric feasibility of neurovascular bundle-sparing stereotactic body radiotherapy with periprostatic hydrogel spacer for localized prostate cancer to preserve erectile function.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of biparametric prostate MRI for prostate cancer in men at risk.', 'Is dynamic contrast enhancement still necessary in multiparametric magnetic resonance for diagnosis of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Reproducibility in contouring the neurovascular bundle for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Evaluating the Impact of PSA as a Selection Criteria for Nerve Sparing Radical Prostatectomy in a Screened Cohort.']"""

However, these methods do not quantify the changes in relation to overall changes that occurred in the total cancer cases over the period of time. An alternative approach is therefore necessary, particularly to identify emerging new cancers.  Methods:   The cancer incidence data of various sites for men, over the periods 1988-90 and 2003-05 in India, for five urban registries namely Bangalore, Bhopal, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai, functioning under the network of National Cancer Registry Programme (ICMR), formed the sources of data for the present analysis. Changes in incidence cases by various cancer sites for men are assessed by calculating the differences in incidence cases over the two period of time. Based on the contribution of each site to total change, the ten most leading sites are identified separately for each registry. The relative changes in the sites with time are taken to identify the most emerging new cancer cases over the period of time.  Results:   The pooled cancer cases for men among five urban registries increased from 30042 cases in 1988-90 to 46946 cases in 2003-05 registering an increase of about 55.8%. The lowest percentage of increase is observed in the registry of Mumbai (25.6%) and the maximum in Bhopal (96.4%). Based on the pooled figures of five urban registries, the lung cancer contributed the maximum % change (9.7%), followed by cancer of prostate (9.2%), mouth (7.5%), tongue (5.9%) and NHL (5.9%). Based on the pooled figures and the relative changes, the emerging new cancers are prostate (140%), liver (112%) and mouth (95%). The % change by sites and the emerging new cancers varied between the registries.""","""['Ramnath Takiar', 'C R Vijay']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['An alternative approach to study the changes in the cancer pattern of women in India (1988-2005).', 'Time trend in breast and cervix cancer of women in India - (1990-2003).', 'Trends in incidence of head and neck cancers in India.', 'The magnitude of cancer cervix in India.', 'Epidemiology of prostate cancer in India.', 'Thirty Years Cancer Incidence Data for Lahore, Pakistan: Trends and Patterns 1984-2014.', 'Trends in mouth cancer incidence in Mumbai, India (1995-2009): An age-period-cohort analysis.', 'Molecular profiling of ETS and non-ETS aberrations in prostate cancer patients from northern India.']"""

Histological disease is present in more than 60% of men beyond their sixties, and more than 40% of men in this age group have lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The prevalence increases with age. About one-fifth of patients with symptomatic disease who present to a doctor will eventually be treated surgically. The remainder will often be managed initially by active surveillance. The majority of these men suffer gradual progression of symptoms and increasingly require treatment. BPH is characterised by a spectrum of obstructive and irritative symptoms, known collectively as LUTS. Poor urinary flow and the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying are the two symptoms that correlate most closely with the eventual need for prostate surgery. Untreated, a significant number of men with BPH will eventually develop acute urinary retention. In addition tosymptom assessment, digital rectal examination can provide an estimate of prostate volume and exclude a palpable nodule suggestive of prostate cancer. PSA testing provides additional information about the risk of prostate cancer being present. Medical management of BPH is suitable for most patients with moderate symptoms. The two main evidence-based approaches are treatment with alpha1-blockers and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARLs). Severely symptomatic patients may also respond to these drugs. Mild symptoms should usually be managed by active surveillance. Combination therapy with an alpha1-blocker and a 5-ARI is more effective than monotherapy in terms of symptom relief and prevention of progression.""","""['Roger Kirby']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Practitioner""","""['Benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms: evidence and approaches for best case management.', 'Treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in benign prostatic hyperplasia and its impact on sexual function.', 'The American Urological Association symptom score in the evaluation of men with lower urinary tract symptoms: at 2 years of followup, does it work?', 'Anticholinergic therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Benign hypertrophy of the prostate: which treatment, for whom?.', 'What are the differences between older and younger patients with epididymitis?', 'Digital rectal examination standardization for inexperienced hands: teaching medical students.']"""
