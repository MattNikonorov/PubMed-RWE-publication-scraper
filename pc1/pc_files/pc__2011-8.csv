AMACR is involved in the β-oxidation of the dietary branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. It is highly expressed in prostate (more than 95 %), colon (92 %), and breast cancers (44 %) but not in the respective normal or hyperplastic tissues. Thus, targeting of AMACR could be a new strategy for molecular imaging and therapy of prostate and some other cancers. Unlabeled 2-methylenacyl-CoA thioesters (12 a-c) were designed as AMACR binding ligands. The thioesters were tested for their ability to inhibit the AMACR-mediated epimerization of (25R)-THC-CoA and were found to be strong AMACR inhibitors. Radioiodinated (E)-(131) I-13-iodo-2-methylentridec-12-enoic acid ((131) I-7 c) demonstrated preferential retention in AMACR-positive prostate tumor cells (LNCaP, LNCaP C4-2wt and DU145) compared with both AMACR-knockout LNCaP C4-2 AMACR-siRNA and benign BPH1 prostate cell lines. A significant protein-bound radioactive fraction with main bands at 47 (sum of molecular weights of AMACR plus 12 c), 70, and 75 kDa was detected in LNCaP C4-2 wt cells. In contrast, only negligible amounts of protein-bound radioactivity were found in LNCaP C4-2 AMACR-siRNA cells.""","""['Agnieszka Morgenroth', 'Elizaveta A Urusova', 'Cornelia Dinger', 'Ehab Al-Momani', 'Thomas Kull', 'Gerhard Glatting', 'Holm Frauendorf', 'Olaf Jahn', 'Felix M Mottaghy', 'Sven N Reske', 'Boris D Zlatopolskiy']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Chemistry""","""['Branched fatty acids in dairy and beef products markedly enhance alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase expression in prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase: a new molecular marker for prostate cancer.', 'Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase as an androgen-independent growth modifier in prostate cancer.', 'Discovery and clinical application of a novel prostate cancer marker: alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S).', 'Value of new prostate cancer markers: alpha methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S) and p63.', 'Racemases and epimerases operating through a 1,1-proton transfer mechanism: reactivity, mechanism and inhibition.', 'Current Knowledge on the Function of α-Methyl Acyl-CoA Racemase in Human Diseases.', 'Sulforaphane Bioavailability and Chemopreventive Activity in Men Presenting for Biopsy of the Prostate Gland: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'A study on the AMACR catalysed elimination reaction and its application to inhibitor testing.']"""

A community based survey""","""Although successful utilization of medical and preventive care by members of the non-US born communities is an important public health concern, our knowledge regarding health practices of different ethnic subgroups is limited. In the present study, participants of the health fairs organized during South Asian cultural and religions events were asked anonymously to complete the South Asian Total Health Initiative (SATHI) health survey questionnaire to evaluate their health-related practices, self-health perception, and satisfaction with medical care. Among 1,250 surveyed, 1,016 foreign born Asian Indians adults that represented the fastest growing subgroups of the South Asian born nationals in the US were included in the analysis. We found that the majority reported healthy behavior (exercise activities and abstinence from alcohol or tobacco), high self-health perception, satisfaction with medical care, and compliance with annual routine medical examinations that was directly associated with the annual house income. Approximately 40% of women complied with breast and cervical cancer screenings and less than 20% of men complied with prostate cancer screening guidelines. Presence of chronic conditions (mostly cardiovascular pathology and/or diabetes) that were reported by approximately half of the participants negatively impacted their self-health perception. In conclusion, positive self-reported health perception and compliance with routine health examinations of the surveyed foreign born Asian Indians was reported along with an increased rate of chronic morbidity and underutilization of specific preventive services. Observed discrepancy between self-health perception and health status highlights the need to enhance utilization of preventive services among the non-US born Asian Indian community.""","""['Naveen Mehrotra', 'Sunanda Gaur', 'Anna Petrova']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Community Health""","""['Health care access and utilization among US-born and foreign-born Asian Americans.', 'Perceived discrimination and health outcomes among Asian Indians in the United States.', 'Surveillance of health status in minority communities - Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Across the U.S. (REACH U.S.) Risk Factor Survey, United States, 2009.', 'Under-Researched Demographics: Heavy Episodic Drinking and Alcohol-Related Problems Among Asian Americans.', 'Asian student depression in American high schools: differences in risk factors.', 'Preventive Health Screening Disparities Among Immigrants: Exploring Barriers to Care.', 'Is Socioeconomic Advantage Associated With Positive Health Behaviors and Health Outcomes Among Asian Indians?', 'Cardiovascular Disease Screening Among Immigrants from Eight World Regions.', 'Differences in nativity, age and gender may impact health behavior and perspectives among Asian Indians.', 'Asian American women in California: a pooled analysis of predictors for breast and cervical cancer screening.']"""

Although underlying mechanisms are unknown, evidence suggests a role of oxidative DNA damage.  Objectives:   Because base excision repair (BER) is the predominant pathway involved in repairing oxidative damage, we evaluated interactions between 39 pesticides and 394 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 31 BER genes among 776 prostate cancer cases and 1,444 male controls in a nested case-control study of white Agricultural Health Study (AHS) pesticide applicators.  Methods:   We used likelihood ratio tests from logistic regression models to determine p-values for interactions between three-level pesticide exposure variables (none/low/high) and SNPs (assuming a dominant model), and the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple comparison adjustment approach.  Results:   The interaction between fonofos and rs1983132 in NEIL3 [nei endonuclease VIII-like 3 (Escherichia coli)], which encodes a glycosylase that can initiate BER, was the most significant overall [interaction p-value (pinteract) = 9.3 × 10-6; FDR-adjusted p-value = 0.01]. Fonofos exposure was associated with a monotonic increase in prostate cancer risk among men with CT/TT genotypes for rs1983132 [odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for low and high use compared with no use were 1.65 (0.91, 3.01) and 3.25 (1.78, 5.92), respectively], whereas fonofos was not associated with prostate cancer risk among men with the CC genotype. Carbofuran and S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC) interacted similarly with rs1983132; however, these interactions did not meet an FDR < 0.2.  Conclusions:   Our significant finding regarding fonofos is consistent with previous AHS findings of increased prostate cancer risk with fonofos exposure among those with a family history of prostate cancer. Although requiring replication, our findings suggest a role of BER genetic variation in pesticide-associated prostate cancer risk.""","""['Kathryn Hughes Barry', 'Stella Koutros', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Gabriella Andreotti', 'Jane A Hoppin', 'Dale P Sandler', 'Laurie A Burdette', 'Meredith Yeager', 'Laura E Beane Freeman', 'Jay H Lubin', 'Xiaomei Ma', 'Tongzhang Zheng', 'Michael C R Alavanja']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Environ Health Perspect""","""['Genetic variation in nucleotide excision repair pathway genes, pesticide exposure and prostate cancer risk.', 'Fonofos exposure and cancer incidence in the agricultural health study.', 'Pesticide use modifies the association between genetic variants on chromosome 8q24 and prostate cancer.', 'Farming, reported pesticide use, and prostate cancer.', 'A weight-of-evidence review of colorectal cancer in pesticide applicators: the agricultural health study and other epidemiologic studies.', 'Construction of Bone Metastasis-Specific Regulation Network Based on Prognostic Stemness-Related Signatures in Prostate Cancer.', 'NEIL3 contributes toward the carcinogenesis of liver cancer and regulates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.', 'Occupational Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', 'TDG Gene Polymorphisms and Their Possible Association with Colorectal Cancer: A Case Control Study.', 'Functional Polymorphisms in DNA Repair Genes Are Associated with Sporadic Colorectal Cancer Susceptibility and Clinical Outcome.']"""

We show that the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is exposed in the outer leaflet of their plasma membrane not only in tumor cell lines, but also in metastases and primary cultures thereof, which contrasts with a lack of PS exposure by differentiated non-tumorigenic counterparts. Studied tumor cell lines were derived from non-tumorigenic and malignant melanomas, prostate- and renal cancer, glioblastoma and a rhabdomyosarcoma. Importantly, also metastases of melanoma expose PS and there is a correlation between malignancy of melanoma cell lines from different stages of tumor progression and PS exposure. The PS exposure we found was neither of apoptotic nor of experimental artificial origin. Finally potentially malignant and non-malignant cells could be differentiated by sorting of a primary cell culture derived from a glioblastoma based on PS exposure, which has so far not been possible within one culture due to lack of a specific marker.

Methods:   81 men aged 69.3 ± 0.8 years (39 men with late-onset hypogonadism and 42 age-matched controls) were recruited. Serum levels of OPG, total soluble RANKL (sRANKL), total and free testosterone (FT), estradiol (E2), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and β-Cross Laps were assessed.  Results:   Compared with controls, both OPG (p = 0.023) and sRANKL (p = 0.010) serum levels were increased in men with late-onset hypogonadism; however, when expressed as a ratio, sRANKL/OPG, the two groups were not significantly different. Simple and age-adjusted analyses showed that OPG was inversely related to FT and positively related to SHBG, E2 and BAP. In the patient population, LH demonstrated statistically significant correlations with both OPG (r = 0.274, p = 0.013) and sRANKL (r = 0.276, p = 0.018). Multiple regression analysis retained age, SHBG, E2 and BAP as independent predictors of OPG, explaining 27.71% of serum OPG variability.  Conclusions:   Late-onset hypogonadism is associated with enhanced RANKL activity. Increased bone turnover-related OPG levels may act as a coupling factor between bone resorption and formation.

Methods:   In this study, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) inhibition was used for the discovery of truncating mutations. Six prostate cancer (PC) patients and their healthy brothers were selected from a group of HPCX1-linked families. Expression analyses were done using Agilent 44 K oligoarrays, and selected genes were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. In addition, microRNA expression levels in the lymphoblastic cells were analyzed to trace variants that might alter miRNA expression and explain partly an inherited genetic predisposion to PC.  Results:   Seventeen genes were selected for resequencing based on the NMD array, but no truncating mutations were found. The most interesting variant was MAGEC1 p.Met1?.

Defining their composition may help to understand the development of neoplasms arising from this tissue.  Aims:   The aim of this study was to define the existence, structure, and arrangement of a possible human female prostate.  Methods:   Urethras of 25 women were investigated by immunohistochemistry and stained with specific monoclonal antibodies against prostate-specific antigen (PSA, mono- and polyclonal antibody), prostate specific alkaline phosphatase (PSAP), and androgen receptor (AR). From two urethras, which underwent a totally serial work up with PSA-staining, a three-dimensional model of the urethra and the prostatic glands was created to enable 3D-perception of the results.  Main outcome measure:   The main outcome measures used in this study were identifying glandular structures in hematoxylin-eosin-staining, positive staining with the respective antibodies, and 3-D orientation of described glands.  Results:   Fourteen of 25 patients had glandular structures encircling the urethra. Twelve of 14 showed positive staining for PSA, PSAP, and AR in gland acini, while the excretory ducts, the urethra, and the surrounding stroma did not express those proteins. The strongest PSA and PSAP expression was found in apical cytoplasm of the glandular cells, and AR was confined to cell nuclei. Prostatic glands were located laterally to the distal half of the urethra.  Conclusion:   A female prostate was found in every second woman in this study and can be discriminated from other urethral caverns and immature paraurethral ducts.

Methods:   From published Jamaica Cancer Registry (JCR) data, we extracted age-standardized rates of prostate cancer for the six 5-year reporting periods that comprised the 30-year study span, and from the archived files of the JCR, the patient ages at diagnosis for all prostate cancer cases recorded over the 30-year period were extracted. The results were compared with data from other black populations.  Results:   The incidence of prostate cancer in KSA, Jamaica, is lower than that in black men in the United States and United Kingdom. The KSA incidence showed a progressive increase since the 1983-1987 reporting period, and the greatest 5-year percentage increases were seen over the period 1983 to 1997. Men in the 60-74-year age group were the commonest contributors to prostate cancer total in all 5-year periods examined, and between 1988 and 2007, there were increases in the proportionate contributions from the 25-59 and 60-74-year age groups, and a decrease in contribution from men aged 75 years and older.

Furthermore, the unique mechanisms that mediate RCC vasculogenesis in bone remain unknown. To understand this process we developed a xenograft model that recapitulates highly vascular RCC versus less vascular tumors that metastasize to bone. Human tumor cell lines of RCC (786-O), prostate cancer (PC3), lung cancer (A549), breast cancer (MDA-MB231), and melanoma (A375) were transduced with firefly luciferase (Luc), injected into the tibiae of nude mice, and differences in growth, osteolysis, and vascularity were assessed by longitudinal bioluminescent imaging, micro-CT for measurement of calcified tissues and vascularity and histology. The results showed that while RCC-Luc has reduced growth and osteolytic potential versus the other tumor lines, it displayed a significant increase in vascular volume (p < 0.05). This expansion was due to 3- and 5-fold increases in small and large vessel numbers respectively. In vitro gene expression profiling revealed that RCC-Luc expresses significantly (p < 0.05) more vegf-a (10-fold) and 20- to 30-fold less ang-1 versus the other lines.

However, the mechanisms that generate CAFs are not well elucidated. To understand how CAFs are generated during primary cancer progression, we investigated the biochemical characteristics of normal human prostate stromal cells (PrSC) co-cultured with human prostate cancer (PCa) cells in vitro. In primary cultures of human PCa-derived stromal cells (PCaSC-8 and PCaSC-9), expression of TNC, ACTA2, EGF, FGF7, and IGF1 mRNA was generally higher than PrSC but gene expression patterns were not uniform between PCaSC-8 and PCaSC-9 cells. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein levels in both PCaSC-8 and PCaSC-9 cells were generally higher than PrSC but levels of both secreted proteins were not same. When PrSCs were co-cultured with androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells or its sublines, androgen-low-sensitive E9 cells and androgen-insensitive AIDL cells, mRNA expression of IGF1 was significantly increased in all combinations. In contrast, expression of COL1A1, TNC, and ACTA2 mRNA was significantly increased only in LNCaP + PrSC and E9 + PrSC co-cultures. Protein production of VEGF was significantly increased only in LNCaP + PrSC and E9 + PrSC co-cultures. Increase of TGFβ protein was observed only in E9 + PrSC co-cultures. These biochemical characteristics of PrSC were partially recapitulated in TGFβ-treated PrSC. We have demonstrated that normal fibroblasts co-cultured with cancer cells become activated and exhibit biochemical characteristics of CAFs in a heterogenous manner.

The effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on these parameters was also studied.  Methods:   VEGF and Ang-2, as well as pericyte coverage of blood vessels were studied in HN and CR prostate tumors by immunohistochemistry. The effects of ADT on VEGF expression and microvessel density (MVD) were investigated in biopsies at diagnosis, 3 months after starting ADT and at tumor relapse. Plasma was also analyzed for VEGF and Ang-2 with ELISA.  Results:   CR tumors had higher levels of VEGF and Ang-2 as well as increased blood vessel stabilization compared to HN tumors. Three months after initiated ADT an increase of VEGF but not MVD in the tumors was observed. In contrast, plasma levels of VEGF decreased after ADT, and increased again at time of tumor relapse. Ang-2 levels were unaffected.  Conclusions:   CR prostate cancer is associated with elevated levels of VEGF and Ang-2, indicating that these factors could be used as targets for anti-angiogenic treatment. Still, the observed increase in blood vessel stabilization in CR tumors could influence the outcome of anti-angiogenic treatment.

The objective of the current study is to investigate the activity of NAG-1 H6D variant in prostate cancer tumorigenesis in vivo.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer DU145 cells expressing the H6D NAG-1 or wild-type (WT) NAG-1 were injected subcutaneously into nude mice and tumor growth was monitored. Serum and tumor samples were collected for subsequent analysis.  Results:   The H6D variant was more potent than the WT NAG-1 and inhibited tumor growth significantly compared to control mice. Mice with tumors expressing the WT NAG-1 have greater reduced both body weight and abdominal fat than mice with H6D variant tumors suggesting different activities of the WT NAG-1 and the H6D NAG-1. A significant reduction in adiponectin, leptin, and IGF-1 serum levels was observed in the tumor-bearing mice with a more profound reduction observed with expression of H6D variant. Cyclin D1 expression was suppressed in the tumors with a dramatic reduction observed in the tumor expressing the H6D variant.

Methods:   The post-treatment functional course was studied prospectively in 254 patients (N = 150 RALP and N = 104 EBRT) with PBS-90 and GEE. The time points at which functions reached stability and significant associations with function at 24 months were examined with PBS-90, and predictors were identified with GEE. The patients filled in the UCLA-PCI questionnaire at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24-month post-treatment.  Results:   The proportions reaching PBS-90 at 24 months were 69% EBRT and 34% RALP patients for urinary function, 70% of EBRT and 7% of RALP patients for sexual function, and 70% of EBRT and 86% of RALP patients for bowel function. GEE showed that the function scores at 6 months were significantly associated with the functions at 24 months. PBS-90 found that stability of function was reached at 3 months for urinary and 6 months for sexual and bowel functions.

Although Pin1 has been shown to be involved in cell transformation and the maintenance of the malignant phenotype in prostate cancer, its specific substrates during these processes have not yet been determined.  Methods:   Cancer-specific phosphorylated proteins were isolated from two human prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, LNCaP) and the Dunning rat prostate cancer cell lines by GST-pull down analysis with recombinant GST-Pin1 protein. These proteins were then identified by the LC-MS/MS analysis using a Q-Tof micro mass spectrometer and processed for further functional analysis.  Results:   We newly identified five prostate cancer-specific Pin1 binding proteins (PINBPs) in this screen. Among these, TRK-fused gene (TFG) was found to be preferentially up-regulated in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. The targeted inhibition of TFG by specific siRNA resulted in the reduced cell proliferation and the induction of premature senescence in PC3 prostate cancer cells. We further found that TFG can facilitate the cell signaling mediated by NF-kappaB and androgen receptor (AR). Tissue micro-dissection based quantitative RT-PCR analysis of prostate cancer tissues following radical prostatectomy further revealed that TFG expression is closely associated with both a higher probability and shorter period of tumor recurrence following surgery.

However, both the regulation of PIP expression and its function in cancer cells are poorly understood. Using BCa and PCa cells, we found that Runx2, a pro-metastatic transcription factor, functionally interacts with the Androgen Receptor (AR) to regulate PIP expression. Runx2 expression in C4-2B PCa cells synergized with AR to promote PIP expression, whereas its knockdown in T47D BCa cells abrogated basal as well as hormone stimulated PIP expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that Runx2 and AR co-occupied an enhancer element located ∼11 kb upstream of the PIP open reading frame, and that Runx2 facilitated AR recruitment to the enhancer. PIP knockdown in T47D cells compromised DHT-stimulated expression of multiple AR target genes including PSA, FKBP5, FASN, and SGK1. The inhibition of AR activity due to loss of PIP was attributable at least in part to abrogation of its nuclear translocation. PIP knockdown also suppressed T47D cell proliferation driven by either serum growth factors or dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

BSPs reduce osteoclastic functions, which result in bone resorption. Bisphosphonates-related osteonecrosis of jaws (BRONJ) is a newly developed term that is used to describe the significant complication in patients receiving bisphosphonates. BSPs are known to exhibit an anti-angiogenetic effect that initiates tissue necrosis of the hard tissue. There is currently no consensus on the correct approach to this issue. The aim of this retrospective study is to compare the effects of laser surgery with biostimulation to conventional surgery in the treatment of BSP-induced avascular bone necrosis on 20 patients who have been treated in our clinic. BRONJ was evaluated in patients with lung, prostate, and breast cancer under intravenous BSP treatment. Twenty patients in this study developed mandibular or maxillary avascular necrosis after a minor tooth extraction surgery or spontaneously. Bone turnover rates were evaluated by serum terminal C-telopeptide levels (CTX) using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay technique and patients were treated with laser or conventional surgical treatments and medical therapy. Ten patients were treated with laser surgery and biostimulation. An Er:YAG laser (Fotona Fidelis Plus II® Combine laser equipment, Slovenia) very long pulse (VLP) mode (200 mJ, 20 Hz) using a fiber tip 1.3 mm in diameter and 12 mm in length was used to remove the necrotic and granulation tissues from the area of avascular necrosis. Biostimulation was applied postoperatively using an Nd:YAG laser. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) was applied to the tissues for 1 min from 4 cm distance using an Nd:YAG laser (Fotona-Slovenia) with a R24 950-µm fiber handpiece long-pulse (LP) mode, 0.25-W, 10 Hz power/cm(2) from the mentioned distance the spot size was 0.4 cm(2), and power output was 2.5 J. Energy density from the mentioned distance was calculated to be 6.25 J/cm(2). The other ten patients were treated with conventional surgery. Treatment outcomes were noted as either complete healing or incomplete healing. There were no statistically significant differences between laser surgery and conventional surgery (p > 0.05). CTX values also did not affect the prognosis of the patients. Treatment outcomes were significantly better in patients with stage II osteonecrosis than in patients with stage I osteonecrosis.

The aim of this study was to determine whether blood and tissue lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and selenium (Se) levels are associated with oxidative damage in the context of prostate cancer progression and development. Seventy-nine patients comprising 25 patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), 23 patients with malignant prostatic carcinoma (malign Ca), 16 patients with low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (LGPIN), and 15 patients with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) diagnosed on the basis of their clinical profile, transrectal ultrasonography, and histopathology were included in this study. Cd and Pb levels in whole blood were found to be increased in patients with HGPIN compared with the BPH group; also, the levels of Cd in whole blood and tissue were found to be increasing in patients with malign Ca, unlike BPH patients. Moreover, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma and tissue were significantly increased in malign Ca, LGPIN, and HGPIN than those in BPH. However, the levels of tissue Pb were found to be decreasing in BPH, unlike the malign Ca and HGPIN patients, and the levels of tissue protein carbonyls in malign Ca were significantly lower than those in HGPIN. The levels of tissue reduced glutathione (GSH) in malign Ca were significantly lower than those in BPH. Additionally, the levels of Se in serum and tissue in LGPIN were significantly lower than those in BPH. The serum Se levels in HGPIN were also significantly lower than those in BPH and malign Ca groups. Furthermore, the concentrations of serum Se in LGPIN were significantly lower than those in malign Ca. From the Pearson correlation analysis, there were significant positive correlations between tissue Cd and MDA levels in malign Ca, LGPIN, and HGPIN and between the tissue Pb and tissue MDA and protein carbonyl levels in malign Ca. Blood Pb and tissue Pb were also significantly positively correlated with plasma MDA and protein carbonyl levels in malign Ca. In addition, blood Pb was significantly positively correlated with tissue MDA and protein carbonyl levels in malign Ca, and a significant positive correlation was also found between blood Cd and plasma protein carbonyls and tissue MDA in LGPIN. We observed that altered prooxidant-antioxidant balance and heavy metal levels may lead to an increase in oxidative damage and may consequently play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis. These findings indicate that changes in the levels of Pb, Cd, Se, MDA, protein carbonyls, and GSH in the blood and/or tissue are related to the prostatic carcinoma development and progression, although triggering one of the mentioned changes is unknown; therefore, further study is required to determine the exact steps of the process and clarify the roles of different substances in order to obtain a more detailed explanation of the phenomenon.""","""['Savas Guzel', 'Lebriz Kiziler', 'Birsen Aydemir', 'Bulent Alici', 'Suleyman Ataus', 'Abdullah Aksu', 'Haydar Durak']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biol Trace Elem Res""","""['Is low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia a risk factor for cancer?', 'High levels of cadmium and lead in seminal fluid and blood of smoking men are associated with high oxidative stress and damage in infertile subjects.', 'Evaluation of global DNA hypomethylation in human prostate cancer and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm tissues by immunohistochemistry.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'Oxidative stress in benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review.', 'Environmental Exposure to Metals, Parameters of Oxidative Stress in Blood and Prostate Cancer: Results from Two Cohorts.', 'Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in Age-Related Lower Urinary Tract Disorders: A Systematic Review.', 'Association between urinary arsenic, blood cadmium, blood lead, and blood mercury levels and serum prostate-specific antigen in a population-based cohort of men in the United States.', 'Non-Essential Trace Elements Dietary Exposure in French Polynesia: Intake Assessment, Nail Bio Monitoring and Thyroid Cancer Risk.', 'Dual Roles of Oxidative Stress in Metal Carcinogenesis.']"""

Only recently has its antioxidant properties and preventive effects against disease been highlighted. Chrysin is a natural flavone commonly found in honey that has been shown to be an antioxidant agent. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of honey and chrysin on cultured human prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Cells were cultured in RPMI medium and treated with different concentrations of honey and chrysin for three consecutive days. Cell viability was quantitated by the 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate.  Results:   The MTT assay revealed that both compounds had an antiproliferative effect on PC-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC50 values for honey and chrysin against PC-3 cells were 2.5% and 24.5% after 48 h and 1.8% and 8.5% after 72 h, respectively. Chrysin induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells, as determined by flow cytometry.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that honey has anti-proliferative effects on prostate cancer cells and the effects are mainly due to chrysin. Therefore, chrysin may be a potential compound for both cancer prevention and treatment. Further in vivo investigation is needed to support the use of chrysin in cancer therapy.""","""['Saeed Samarghandian', 'Jalil Tavakkol Afshari', 'Saeideh Davoodi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clinics (Sao Paulo)""","""['Acacia honey and chrysin reduce proliferation of melanoma cells through alterations in cell cycle progression.', 'Role of caspases, Bax and Bcl-2 in chrysin-induced apoptosis in the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells.', 'Inhibitory and Cytotoxic Activities of Chrysin on Human Breast Adenocarcinoma Cells by Induction of Apoptosis.', 'From the hive: Honey, a novel weapon against cancer.', 'Antiproliferative effects of honey and of its polyphenols: a review.', 'Propolis: A Detailed Insight of Its Anticancer Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Niosomes nanoparticles as a novel approach in drug delivery enhances anticancer properties of chrysin in human ovarian carcinoma cells (SKOV3): an in vitro study.', 'Anti-cancer Activity of Chrysin in Cancer Therapy: a Systematic Review.', 'Synergic Effect of Honey with Other Natural Agents in Developing Efficient Wound Dressings.', 'Chrysin Induces Apoptosis via the MAPK Pathway and Regulates ERK/mTOR-Mediated Autophagy in MC-3 Cells.']"""

We evaluated long-term outcomes of patients with a PSM at RRP and determined predictors of systemic progression (SP) and mortality in these men.  Methods:   We reviewed our institutional registry of 16,749 patients who underwent RRP between 1990 and 2008 to identify 2895 patients with a PSM. Median follow-up was 10.6 years. Postoperative survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze clinicopathological variables associated with SP and death from prostate cancer.  Results:   A 15-year SP-free and cancer-specific survival was 90 and 93%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, higher tumor volume, increased pathological Gleason score and advanced pathological tumor stage were associated with significantly increased risks of SP and death from prostate cancer, whereas number and location of PSM did not predict mortality.

The effectiveness of abiraterone in reducing tumor androgens is not known, nor have mechanisms contributing to abiraterone resistance been established.  Experimental design:   We treated human CRPC xenografts with abiraterone and measured tumor growth, tissue androgens, androgen receptor (AR) levels, and steroidogenic gene expression versus controls.  Results:   Abiraterone suppressed serum PSA levels and improved survival in two distinct CRPC xenografts: median survival of LuCaP35CR improved from 17 to 39 days (HR = 3.6, P = 0.0014) and LuCaP23CR from 14 to 24 days (HR = 2.5, P = 0.0048). Abiraterone strongly suppressed tumor androgens, with testosterone (T) decreasing from 0.49 ± 0.22 to 0.03 ± 0.01 pg/mg (P < 0.0001), and from 0.69 ± 0.36 to 0.03 ± 0.01 pg/mg (P = 0.002) in abiraterone-treated 23CR and 35CR, respectively, with comparable decreases in tissue DHT. Treatment was associated with increased expression of full-length AR (AR(FL)) and truncated AR variants (AR(FL) 2.3-fold, P = 0.008 and AR(del567es) 2.7-fold, P = 0.036 in 23 CR; AR(FL) 3.4-fold, P = 0.001 and AR(V7) 3.1-fold, P = 0.0003 in 35CR), and increased expression of the abiraterone target CYP17A1 (∼2.1-fold, P = 0.0001 and P = 0.028 in 23CR and 35CR, respectively) and transcript changes in other enzymes modulating steroid metabolism.  Conclusions:   These studies indicate that abiraterone reduces CRPC growth via suppression of intratumoral androgens and that resistance to abiraterone may occur through mechanisms that include upregulation of CYP17A1, and/or induction of AR and AR splice variants that confer ligand-independent AR transactivation.""","""['Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Brett T Marck', 'Stephen R Plymate', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Stephen Balk', 'Alvin M Matsumoto', 'Peter S Nelson', 'R Bruce Montgomery']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Rapid induction of androgen receptor splice variants by androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone switches castration-resistant prostate cancer dependency from adrenal androgens towards androgen receptor variants and glucocorticoid receptor signalling.', 'Intratumoral de novo steroid synthesis activates androgen receptor in castration-resistant prostate cancer and is upregulated by treatment with CYP17A1 inhibitors.', 'Intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in prostate cancer pathogenesis and response to therapy.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Histone H2A Lys130 acetylation epigenetically regulates androgen production in prostate cancer.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Niclosamide Analogs as Therapeutic Agents for Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Pseurotin A Validation as a Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Recurrence-Suppressing Lead via PCSK9-LDLR Axis Modulation.', 'Using the AR-V7 biomarker to determine treatment in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, a feasibility randomised control trial, conclusions from the VARIANT trial version 2; peer review: 2 approved.', 'Effect of Dexamethasone on Abiraterone Pharmacokinetics in Mice: Determined by LC/MS Analysis.']"""

TGF-β utilizes a multitude of intracellular signalling pathways in addition to Smads with actions that are dependent on circumstances, including dose, target cell type, and context. The aims of this research were (i) to verify the effects of dose-dependent TGF-β3 treatment on YY1 and p53 expression, in BPH-1 cell line, human benign prostate hyperplasia, and two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, which is androgen-sensitive, and DU-145, which is androgen-non responsive, (ii) establish a correlation between p53 and YY1 and (iii) determine the expression of a number of important intracellular signalling pathways in TGF-β3-treated prostate cell lines. The expression of YY1, p53, PI3K, AKT, pAKT, PTEN, Bcl-2, Bax, and iNOS was evaluated through Western blot analysis on BPH-1, LNCaP, and DU-145 cultures treated with 10 and 50 ng/ml of TGF-β3 for 24 h. The production of nitric oxide (NO) was determined by Griess reagent and cell viability through MTT assay. The results of this research demonstrated profound differences in the responses of the BPH-1, LNCaP, and DU-145 cell lines to TGF-β3 stimulation.

DPA can undergo free radical-mediated peroxidation via lipoxygenase (LOX). 15-LOX, one of the LOX isomers, has received much attention in cancer research because of its very different expression level in normal tissues compared to tumors and some bioactive fatty acid metabolites modulating the tumorigenic pathways in cancer. However, the mechanism linking 15-LOX, DPA metabolites, and their bioactivities is still unclear, and the free radicals generated in DPA peroxidation have never been characterized. In this study, we have studied radicals formed from both soybean and human cellular (PC3-15LOS cells) 15-LOX-catalyzed peroxidation of DPAs at various pH's using a combination of LC/ESR/MS with the spin trapping technique. We observed a total of three carbon-centered radicals formed in 15-LOX-DPA (n-3) stemming from its 7-, 17-, and 20-hydroperoxides, whereas only one formed from 17-hydroperoxide in DPA (n-6). A change in the reaction pH from 8.5 (15-LOX enzyme optimum) to 7.4 (physiological) and to 6.5 (tumor, acidic) not only decreased the total radical formation but also altered the preferred site of oxygenation.

The aim of this study was to clarify the role played by H₂O₂ in the chemopreventive activities of 3,4-DHPEA on breast (MDA and MCF-7), prostate (LNCap and PC3) and colon (SW480 and HCT116) cancer cell lines and to investigate the effects of cell culture medium components and the possible mechanisms at the basis of the H₂O₂-producing properties of 3,4-DHPEA.  Methods:   The proliferation was measured by the MTT assay and the apoptosis by both fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The concentration of H₂O₂ in the culture medium was measured by the ferrous ion oxidation-xylenol orange method.  Results:   It was found that the H₂O₂-inducing ability of 3,4-DHPEA is completely prevented by pyruvate and that the exposure of cells to conditions not supporting the H₂O₂ accumulation (addition of either catalase or pyruvate to the culture medium) inhibited the anti-proliferative effect of 3,4-DHPEA. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the different cell lines to the anti-proliferative effect of 3,4-DHPEA was inversely correlated with their ability to remove H₂O₂ from the culture medium. With regard to the mechanism by which 3,4-DHPEA causes the H₂O₂ accumulation, it was found that superoxide dismutase increased the H₂O₂ production while tyrosinase, slightly acidic pH (6,8) and absence of oxygen (O₂) completely prevented this activity. In addition, different transition metal-chelating compounds did not modify the H₂O₂-producing activity of 3,4-DHPEA.  Conclusions:   The pro-oxidant activity of 3,4-DHPEA deeply influences its 'in vitro' chemopreventive activities. The main initiation step in the H₂O₂-producing activity is the auto-oxidation of 3,4-DHPEA by O₂ with the formation of the semiquinone, superoxide ions (O₂(-)) and 2H(+).""","""['Roberto Fabiani', 'Maria Vittoria Sepporta', 'Patrizia Rosignoli', 'Angelo De Bartolomeo', 'Marilena Crescimanno', 'Guido Morozzi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur J Nutr""","""['In vitro chemo-preventive activities of hydroxytyrosol: the main phenolic compound present in extra-virgin olive oil.', 'Production of hydrogen peroxide is responsible for the induction of apoptosis by hydroxytyrosol on HL60 cells.', 'Enhanced chemopreventive activity of hydroxytyrosol on HL60 and HL60R cells by chemical conversion into thio derivatives.', 'Hydroxytyrosol promotes superoxide production and defects in autophagy leading to anti-proliferation and apoptosis on human prostate cancer cells.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting hydrogen peroxide metabolism in the treatment of brain ischaemia.', 'Hydroxytyrosol-rich extract from olive juice as an additive in gilthead sea bream juveniles fed a high-fat diet: Regulation of somatic growth.', 'Involvement of the PI3K/AKT Intracellular Signaling Pathway in the AntiCancer Activity of Hydroxytyrosol, a Polyphenol from Olea europaea, in Hematological Cells and Implication of HSP60 Levels in Its Anti-Inflammatory Activity.', 'Nutraceutical Role of Polyphenols and Triterpenes Present in the Extracts of Fruits and Leaves of Olea europaea as Antioxidants, Anti-Infectives and Anticancer Agents on Healthy Growth.', 'Influence of Olive Oil and Its Components on Breast Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Potential Effects of Phenolic Compounds That Can Be Found in Olive Oil on Wound Healing.']"""

Prostate, colon, breast and cervical cancer cell lines were analyzed for the expression of MICA and MICB at the mRNA and protein levels by RT-PCR, Western blot, flow cytometry and ELISA. The activating mark H3K4m2 at the MICA and MICB promoters was investigated by ChIP assays. Cytotoxicity of NK cells against the target epithelial cancer cells was investigated with the CD107 cytotoxicity assay. The results show that hydralazine and valproic acid not only increase the expression of MICA and MICB ligands of target cells, but also reduce their shedding to the supernatant. This upregulation occurs at the transcriptional level as revealed by increase of the H3K4 activating mark at the promoter of MICA and MICB genes. These effects are paralleled by increased cytotoxicity of NK cells, which was attenuated at different degrees by using blocking antibodies against the NKG2D receptor and ligands.

Modification of thermosensitivity by treatment with PTL prior to hyperthermia was investigated in the human prostate cancer androgen-independent cell lines PC3 and DU145. In addition, we analyzed the mechanisms related to induction of apoptosis or G₂/M cell-cycle arrest via the effects of ERK1/2, p38 and SAPK/JNK signaling on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Lethal damage caused by mild hyperthermia at 41.0˚C or 42.0˚C in both cell lines resulted in a low level of thermosensitivity, while sequential combination with PTL showed significant thermosensitization. Step-up hyperthermia (SUH) (42˚C for 30 min, 43.0˚C or 43.5˚C for various periods) reduced the thermosensitivity of the cells to second heating. However, PTL given as pre-treatment prior to SUH prevented SUH-induced thermal tolerance and resulted in significant thermosensitization. Induction of apoptosis by the combination of PTL and hyperthermia at 44.0˚C was determined by the ratio of sub-G1 division cells using flow cytometry, which was increased significantly in comparison with single treatment, and was more effective in PC3 than DU145 cells. The behavior of ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK signaling in the MAPK cascade by treatment with PTL and hyperthermia were examined by Western blotting. As for PC3 cells, ras-downstream p-ERK1/2 was activated and p-p38 slightly activated by combined treatment with PTL and hyperthermia in comparison with each alone. As for DU145 cells, ERK1/2 was not changed, while p38 and SAPK/JNK were slightly activated by combination treatment. These results were related to increases in the induction of apoptosis, G₂/M cell cycle arrest, and lethal damage of cells via the MAPK cascade.

However, therapeutic effect of embelin in combination with conventional radiation therapy is not yet determined. In this study, we evaluate the sensitizing potential of embelin on ionizing radiation (IR) in a human prostate cancer model. In vitro, embelin combined with radiation potently suppressed prostate cancer PC-3 cell proliferation that was associated with S and G2/M arrest in cell cycle. Moreover, the combination treatment promoted caspase-independent apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased apoptotic cell death without caspase-3 activation, but not autophagy. Clonogenic survival assay showed that S-phase arrest was required for embelin-mediated radiosensitization. In vivo, embelin significantly improved tumor response to X-ray radiation in the PC-3 xenograft model. Combination therapy produced enhanced tumor growth delay and prolonged time to progression, with minimal systemic toxicity. Immunohistochemistry studies showed that embelin plus IR significantly inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased microvessel density in tumors as compared with either treatment alone, suggesting an enhanced combinatory inhibition on tumor suppression and angiogenesis. Our results demonstrate that embelin significantly facilitates tumor suppression by radiation therapy both in vitro and in vivo in the prostate cancer model.

Mesenchyme (embryonic stroma) controls prostate organogenesis, and in some circumstances can re-differentiate prostate tumours. We have applied next-generation Tag profiling to fetal human prostate, normal human prostate fibroblasts (NPFs) and CAFs to identify molecules expressed in prostatic stroma. Comparison of gene expression profiles of a patient-matched pair of NPFs vs CAFs identified 671 transcripts that were enriched in CAFs and 356 transcripts whose levels were decreased, relative to NPFs. Gene ontology analysis revealed that CAF-enriched transcripts were associated with prostate morphogenesis and CAF-depleted transcripts were associated with cell cycle. We selected mRNAs to follow-up by comparison of our data sets with published prostate cancer fibroblast microarray profiles as well as by focusing on transcripts encoding secreted and peripheral membrane proteins, as well as mesenchymal transcripts identified in a previous study from our group. We confirmed differential transcript expression between CAFs and NPFs using QrtPCR, and defined protein localization using immunohistochemistry in fetal prostate, adult prostate and prostate cancer.

This capability is lost during the early stage in the development of prostate malignancy. ZIP4 is an important zinc transporter. In this study, we explore the expression of ZIP4 in prostate carcinoma and invest the functional contributions of ZIP4 to cancer growth in vitro.  Methods:   ZIP4 expression was detected in 14 prostate carcinoma and 20 BPH tissues by real-time RT-PCR and western blot. To invest the biological function of ZIP4 in prostate carcinoma cells, ZIP4 stable over-expression in cells was established in prostate carcinoma cell line DU145 (DU145-ZIP4) and ZIP4 short hairpin RNA(shRNA) expression in stable cells was also established in prostate carcinoma cell line 22RV1(22RV1-shRNA). The proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of the prostate carcinoma cells were detected.  Results:   The expression of ZIP4 mRNA and protein are significantly down-regulated in prostate carcinoma tissues compared with that in BPH tissues. However, we found that there was no correlation between the ZIP4 expression and the pathologic grade of prostate carcinoma. In in vitro studies, over-expression of ZIP4 not only inhibits the proliferation but also inhibits the invasive ability of prostate carcinoma cell line DU145-ZIP4. At the same time, we found silencing of ZIP4 was associated with increased cell proliferation and invasion ability in 22RV1-shRNA cell line. However, both DU145-ZIP4 and 22RV1-shRNA cells showed a significant reduction on cell migration ability compared with the control.  Conclusion:   The results indicate that ZIP4 expression is down-regulated in prostate carcinoma and it may serve as a promising biomarker for prostate carcinoma. ZIP4 has an inhibitory effect on prostate carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion. It suggests that ZIP4 may be a tumor suppressor gene and down-regulation of ZIP4 may be a critical early event in the development of prostate carcinoma.""","""['Qi-guang Chen', 'Zhe Zhang', 'Qi Yang', 'Guang-yi Shan', 'Xiu-yue Yu', 'Chui-ze Kong']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Glycoprotein transmembrane nmb: an androgen-downregulated gene attenuates cell invasion and tumorigenesis in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Up-regulated expression of the MAT-8 gene in prostate cancer and its siRNA-mediated inhibition of expression induces a decrease in proliferation of human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Blockade of the type I IGF receptor expression in human prostate cancer cells inhibits proliferation and invasion, up-regulates IGF binding protein-3, and suppresses MMP-2 expression.', 'The clinical relevance of the metabolism of prostate cancer; zinc and tumor suppression: connecting the dots.', 'Zinc as an anti-tumor agent in prostate cancer and in other cancers.', 'Zinc in Prostate Health and Disease: A Mini Review.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'A Correlation Between Intracellular Zinc Content and Osteosarcoma.', 'SLC39A4 as a Novel Prognosis Marker Promotes Tumor Progression in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Growth Modulatory Role of Zinc in Prostate Cancer and Application to Cancer Therapeutics.']"""

Median OR time was 175 minutes (IQR: 136.8-202.5) and median EBL was 150 cc (IQR: 100-200). There were 4 complications (5.8%): urine leak (2) and ileus (2). Median duration of stay was 1 day and no patient had a hospital stay over 3 days. On final pathology, 26 men (37.7%) had organ-confined disease with negative surgical margins and 27 (39.1%) had extracapsular extension with negative margins. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 12 patients (17.4%) at a median follow-up of 37.7 months. There was a single incidence of positive lymph nodes at the time of surgery (1.4%). Actuarial biochemical recurrence-free survival was 91% at 12 months and 86% at 36 months. Functional outcomes assessed by patient administered questionnaire at a median follow-up of 26.2 months showed an improvement in median IPSS score from 8.0 preoperatively to 5.0 postoperatively (P = 0.0004) with 53 (81.5%) of patients using 1 pad per day or less for urine control and 7 patients (33.3%) of the 21 men with preoperative SHIM score > 21 preoperatively achieving erections sufficient for intercourse.

We hypothesized that PITX2 hypermethylation leads to PITX2 silencing and that decreased PITX2 expression is likewise associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancers. Moreover, it is unknown so far how PITX2 hypermethylation relates to other molecular changes in prostate cancer, such as ERG oncogenic activation in about half of all cases.  Objective:   To investigate how PITX2 expression and methylation are related, whether biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy can be predicted by PITX2 mRNA levels, and how changes in PITX2 relate to ERG overexpression.  Material and methods:   We measured PITX2 and ERG expression in 45 cancerous and 13 benign tissues from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (age range: 59-74 years). Methylation of the PITX2 gene was analyzed in an extended series of 93 cancers. Follow-up was performed for all patients for a 98-month median period. Additionally, expression and methylation changes of PITX2 were investigated in prostate carcinoma cell lines. Gene expression and methylation were determined by quantitative RT-PCR and methylation-specific PCR, respectively. Biochemical recurrence defined as a total PSA of >0.2 ng/ml on 2 consecutive tests was considered as the surrogate endpoint for survival analysis.  Results:   PITX2 expression was significantly and strongly decreased in prostate cancer compared to benign tissues. Cases with decreased PITX2 experienced significantly earlier biochemical recurrences. PITX2 down-regulation was associated with PITX2 promoter hypermethylation in tumor samples and cell lines. PITX2 hypermethylation was more pronounced in cases with ERG overexpression.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) triggers apoptosis selectively in cancer cells but not in normal cells. Soluble or expressed in immune cells, molecules TRAIL plays a significant role in surveillance and defense mechanisms against tumours. Prostate cancer is an ideal disease for nutritional prevention. The TRAIL-mediated apoptosis pathway in prostate cancer cells is an attractive target for chemopreventive activities of dietary agents. LNCaP and DU145 prostate cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We showed that biochanin-A markedly augmented TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in both prostate cancer cell lines. Then, we investigated the mechanisms by which biochanin-A enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis using the LNCaP cell line. The isoflavone sensitized the TRAIL-resistant LNCaP cells through the inhibition of transcription factor NF-κB(p65) activity, increased the expression of the death receptor TRAIL-R2 (DR5), and disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Our study confirmed that biochanin-A overcame TRAIL-resistance by engaging both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways and by regulating the NF-κB activity.

Objective:   To evaluate the impact of BMI on the risk of reclassification for AS eligibility.  Design, setting, and participants:   We assessed 230 men who underwent an immediate RP and were eligible for AS according to the following criteria: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 10 ng/ml, clinical stage T1c, Gleason score ≤ 6, fewer than three positive cores, extent of cancer in any core <50%, and life expectancy >10 yr.  Intervention:   All patients underwent a standardised 21-core biopsy and RP at our department between January 2001 and December 2010.  Measurements:   Reclassification was defined as upstaged disease (pathologic stage >pT2) and/or upgraded disease (Gleason score ≥ 7; primary Gleason pattern 4) in RP specimens. PSA outcomes were also recorded.  Results and limitations:   Mean BMI was 26.4 kg/m(2), and 13% of patients were obese (BMI >30). Mean BMI was the only preoperative factor significantly associated with the risk of upstaged disease. In multivariate analysis, BMI >30 remained an independent predictive factor for upstaged disease (p=0.003; odds ratio: 4.2). The risk of upgraded disease (primary Gleason pattern 4) was significantly decreased 4.5-fold in large prostate glands (>50 ml; p=0.008). The biochemical recurrence-free survival curves were not significantly different between men who were or were not overweight (p=0.950).  Conclusions:   Obese men are at higher risk of upstaged disease, with a proportion of 30% of pT3 disease in RP specimens.

Methods:   Ellagic acid (10-100 mol/L) treatment (48 h) of human prostate carcinoma PC3 cells was found to result in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis of PC3 cells as assessed by MTT assay, western blotting, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.  Results:   We observed that ellagic acid treatment of PC3 cells resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of cell growth/cell viability. This ellagic acid caused cell growth inhibition was found to be accompanied by induction of apoptosis, as assessed by the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and morphological changes. Further, induction of apoptosis accompanied a decrease in the levels of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increase in proapoptotic protein Bax, thus shifting the Bax: Bcl-2 ratio in favor of apoptosis. Ellagic acid treatment of PC3 cells was also found to result in significant activation of caspases, as shown by the dose dependent decrease in the protein expression of procaspase-3, -6, -8 and -9. This ellagic acid-mediated induction of apoptosis was significantly (80%-90%) inhibited by the caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK).

Prostate cancer accounts for 28% of cancer cases and 11% of cancer deaths in men with 217,730 estimated new cases and 32,050 estimated deaths in 2010 in the United States alone. The major current limitation is the inability to reliably localize implanted radiation seeds spatially in relation to the prostate. Multimodality approaches that incorporate X-ray for seed localization have been proposed, but they require both accurate tracking of the imaging device and segmentation of the seeds. Some use image-based radiographic fiducials to track the X-ray device, but manual intervention is needed to select proper regions of interest for segmenting both the tracking fiducial and the seeds, to evaluate the segmentation results, and to correct the segmentations in the case of segmentation failure, thus requiring a significant amount of extra time in the operating room. In this paper, we present an automatic segmentation algorithm that simultaneously segments the tracking fiducial and brachytherapy seeds, thereby minimizing the need for manual intervention. In addition, through the innovative use of image processing techniques such as mathematical morphology, Hough transforms, and RANSAC, our method can detect and separate overlapping seeds that are common in brachytherapy implant images. Our algorithm was validated on 55 phantom and 206 patient images, successfully segmenting both the fiducial and seeds with a mean seed segmentation rate of 96% and sub-millimeter accuracy.""","""['Nathanael Kuo', 'Anton Deguet', 'Danny Y Song', 'Everette C Burdette', 'Jerry L Prince', 'Junghoon Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Eng Phys""","""['An image-guidance system for dynamic dose calculation in prostate brachytherapy using ultrasound and fluoroscopy.', 'Automated localization of implanted seeds in 3D TRUS images used for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Automatic segmentation of seeds and fluoroscope tracking (FTRAC) fiducial in prostate brachytherapy x-ray images.', 'EM-enhanced US-based seed detection for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Automatic shape-based level set segmentation for needle tracking in 3-D TRUS-guided prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of X-ray to MRI for post-implant dosimetry in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of x ray and MRI for postimplant dosimetry in low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Intraoperative Registered Ultrasound and Fluoroscopy (iRUF) for dose calculation during prostate brachytherapy: Improved accuracy compared to standard ultrasound-based dosimetry.', 'Automatic seed picking for brachytherapy postimplant validation with 3D CT images.', 'Automatic detection and measurement of viral replication compartments by ellipse adjustment.']"""

Objective:   To study the role of transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) fusion, an androgen-dependent growth factor, in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a biomarker of sensitivity to AA.  Design, setting, and participants:   The predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG status was studied in 41 of 48 men with postchemotherapy-treated CRPC enrolled in sequential phase 2 AA trials.  Intervention:   Patients received AA 1000 mg daily and continuously.  Measurements:   TMPRSS2-ERG status was characterized by a sensitive, analytically valid reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay in CTCs enriched from ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid anticoagulated blood obtained prior to AA treatment. Outcomes were measured by PSA Working Group 1 criteria.  Results and limitations:   Standard procedures for specimen acquisition, processing, and testing using the validated TMPRSS2-ERG assay on a multiplex platform gave intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation <7%. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was present in 15 of 41 patients (37%), who had a median baseline CTC count of 17 (interquartile range: 7-103 cells per 7.5 ml). A PSA decline ≥50% was observed in 7 of 15 patients (47%) with the fusion and in 10 of 26 patients (38%) without the fusion. Although limited by the low number of patients, a posttherapy CTC count of less than five per 7.5 ml was prognostic for longer survival relative to a CTC count five or more. TMPRSS2-ERG status did not predict a decline in PSA or other clinical outcomes.  Conclusions:   Molecular profiles of CTCs with an analytically valid assay identified the presence of the prostate cancer-specific TMPRSS2-ERG fusion but did not predict for response to AA treatment. This finding demonstrates the role of CTCs as surrogate tissue that can be obtained in a routine practice setting.

In order to evaluate the complex relationship between the genotoxicity and the AhR-mediated activity of PAHs in prostate cells, we selected benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), as model genotoxic and nongenotoxic AhR ligands, respectively, to explore global changes in gene expression in LNCaP cells by microarray analysis. We identified 112 genes that were differentially expressed in cells treated for 24h with BaP, TCDD or both compounds. Our data indicated that the impacts of BaP and TCDD on transcriptome of LNCaP cells significantly overlap, since over 64% of significantly up-regulated genes and 47% of down-regulated genes were similarly affected by both AhR ligands. This suggested that the activation of AhR played a prominent role in the nongenotoxic effects of BaP in the prostate carcinoma cell model LNCaP. Both AhR ligands suppressed expression of genes associated with cell cycle progression, DNA replication, spindle assembly checkpoint or DNA repair, which probably occurred secondary to inhibition of cell cycle progression. In contrast, we identified Wnt5a, an important regulator of prostate cancer progression, to be induced as early as 6h after exposure to both AhR ligands.

Methods:   We constructed tissue microarrays from 183 prostate tumor tissues, 43 adjacent non-neoplastic tissues from the same patients, and 13 tissue samples from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. A semiquantitative assessment of SLC5A8 protein expression was determined as the product of immunostaining intensity and the percentage of cells stained.

The development of a SSI after radical prostatectomy is associated with increased cost and significant morbidity. However, existing comparisons between open and robotic surgery have been made comparing a contemporary robotic experience with historical cohorts undergoing open surgery.  Methods:   We reviewed the incidence of SSI in 5908 consecutive patients undergoing both retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP; n = 4824 [81.7%]) and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP; n = 1084 [18.3%]) at our institution between 2004 and 2008.

Results:   In total, 222 (3.7%) patients developed an SSI. Those undergoing RARP (6/1084, 0.6%) were significantly less likely to develop an SSI than patients undergoing RRP (216/4824, 4.5%) (P <.001). Furthermore, SSIs in patients undergoing RARP resolved more quickly (median, 7 vs 16 days) and were less likely to require wound incision and/or drainage (1 vs 84 patients), hospital readmission (0 vs 11 patients), or return to the operating room for debridement (0 vs 6 patients).

In cancer, this hierarchical structure is altered and epigenetic control deregulated, but the relationship between these two phenomena is still unclear. CD133 is a marker for adult stem cells in various tissues and tumour types. Stem cell specificity is maintained by tight regulation of CD133 expression at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. In this study we investigated the role of epigenetic regulation of CD133 in epithelial differentiation and cancer.  Methods:   DNA methylation analysis of the CD133 promoter was done by pyrosequencing and methylation specific PCR; qRT-PCR was used to measure CD133 expression and chromatin structure was determined by ChIP. Cells were treated with DNA demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors. All the experiments were carried out in both cell lines and primary samples.  Results:   We found that CD133 expression is repressed by DNA methylation in the majority of prostate epithelial cell lines examined, where the promoter is heavily CpG hypermethylated, whereas in primary prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia, low levels of DNA methylation, accompanied by low levels of mRNA, were found. Moreover, differential methylation of CD133 was absent from both benign or malignant CD133+/α2β1integrinhi prostate (stem) cells, when compared to CD133-/α2β1integrinhi (transit amplifying) cells or CD133-/α2β1integrinlow (basal committed) cells, selected from primary epithelial cultures. Condensed chromatin was associated with CD133 downregulation in all of the cell lines, and treatment with HDAC inhibitors resulted in CD133 re-expression in both cell lines and primary samples.  Conclusions:   CD133 is tightly regulated by DNA methylation only in cell lines, where promoter methylation and gene expression inversely correlate. This highlights the crucial choice of cell model systems when studying epigenetic control in cancer biology and stem cell biology. Significantly, in both benign and malignant prostate primary tissues, regulation of CD133 is independent of DNA methylation, but is under the dynamic control of chromatin condensation. This indicates that CD133 expression is not altered in prostate cancer and it is consistent with an important role for CD133 in the maintenance of the hierarchical cell differentiation patterns in cancer.""","""['Davide Pellacani', 'Richard J Packer', 'Fiona M Frame', 'Emma E Oldridge', 'Paul A Berry', 'Marie-Christine Labarthe', 'Michael J Stower', 'Matthew S Simms', 'Anne T Collins', 'Norman J Maitland']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Epigenetic regulation of CD133 and tumorigenicity of CD133+ ovarian cancer cells.', 'Human α(2)β(1)(HI) CD133(+VE) epithelial prostate stem cells express low levels of active androgen receptor.', 'Epigenetic regulation of CD133/PROM1 expression in glioma stem cells by Sp1/myc and promoter methylation.', ""Tumour-initiating cells vs. cancer 'stem' cells and CD133: what's in the name?"", 'Targeting CD133 antigen in cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: The Role of CD133.', 'Cancer stem cell marker expression and methylation status in patients with colorectal cancer.', 'HDAC inhibitors with potential to overcome drug resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Relationship between Cancer Stem Cell Marker CD133 and Cancer Germline Antigen Genes in NCI-H292 Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Midkine silencing enhances the anti-prostate cancer stem cell activity of the flavone apigenin: cooperation on signaling pathways regulated by ERK, p38, PTEN, PARP, and NF-κB.']"""

This novel formulation is available as a 1-, 3- and most recently 6-month depot (Eligard® 45 mg). The latter was shown to lower and maintain safe and effective serum testosterone suppression in a clinical study.  Methods:   A non-interventional study to confirm the efficacy and safety of 6-monthly leuprolide acetate (Eligard® 45 mg) in routine urological practice was performed in Germany. Data were obtained from 1273 patients under the care of 634 urologists, and were analysed descriptively. Concentrations of PSA and serum testosterone were documented at the baseline visit and at 6 and 12 months following 6-monthly leuprolide acetate. The participating physicians were also asked to assess the efficacy, tolerability and handling of 6-monthly leuprolide acetate.  Results:   Serum concentrations of PSA and testosterone were decreased substantially within 6 months of initial 6-monthly leuprolide acetate administration. At 12 months, median reductions of 96% (to 0.5 ng/ml) in PSA, and 90% (to 8.9 ng/dl) in serum testosterone, were observed. Further PSA and serum testosterone decreases were also observed in a subpopulation of patients who switched to 6-monthly leuprolide acetate from other GnRH analogues. Physicians rated 6-monthly leuprolide acetate as easy to use, and patients reported good tolerability. Adverse events occurred in 9% of patients; the majority were not serious. In particular, low rates of hot flushes were reported.  Conclusions:   This non-interventional study showed that the reliable reduction of PSA and testosterone levels demonstrated in previous clinical studies of twice-yearly leuprolide acetate can also be achieved in routine clinical practice.

Inhibition of the expression of cell cycle-regulating cyclins resulted in cell cycle arrest in the G₀/G₁ phase, reduction in the number of cells in the S phase, and the triggering of apoptosis, as detected by increased expression of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface and by formation of DNA laddering. In addition, 1 suppressed the formation of prostate cancer colonies in soft agar and inhibited proliferation, angiogenesis, and the growth of prostate tumors xenografted onto chick chorioallantoic membranes without overt systemic toxicity.

PTV was determined by the sum of all visually estimated tumor foci on every section. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as 2 consecutive increases in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 0.2 ng/ml and various clinicopathological variables were tested for prognostication of recurrence-free survival.  Results:   Serum PSA at surgery was 12.5 ± 16.8 ng/ml and pathological stage was T2 in 899 (57.4%) patients. Surgical Gleason score was 7 in 842 patients (53.7%), higher than 7 in 250 (16%) patients, and in 32% of the patients, surgical margin was positive.

In the presents study mechanisms and potential consequences of the crosstalk between extra- and intracellular pH (pH(e), pH(i)) and mitogen-activated-protein-kinases (ERK1/2, p38) was analyzed. Data were obtained mainly in AT1 R-3327 prostate carcinoma cells, but the principle importance was confirmed in 5 other cell types. Extracellular acidosis leads to a rapid and sustained decrease of pH(i) in parallel to p38 phosphorylation in all cell types and to ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 3 of 6 cell types. Furthermore, p38 phosphorylation was elicited by sole intracellular lactacidosis at normal pH(e). Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation during acidosis led to necrotic cell death. No evidence for the involvement of the kinases c-SRC, PKC, PKA, PI3K or EGFR nor changes in cell volume in acidosis-induced MAPK activation was obtained. However, our data reveal that acidosis enhances the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), probably originating from mitochondria, which subsequently trigger MAPK phosphorylation. Scavenging of ROS prevented acidosis-induced MAPK phosphorylation whereas addition of H(2)O(2) enhanced it. Finally, acidosis increased phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB via p38, leading to increased transcriptional activity of a CRE-reporter even 24 h after switching the cells back to a normal environmental milieu. Thus, an acidic tumor microenvironment can induce a longer lasting p38-CREB-medited change in the transcriptional program, which may maintain the altered phenotype even when the cells leave the tumor environment.""","""['Anne Riemann', 'Bettina Schneider', 'Angelika Ihling', 'Martin Nowak', 'Christoph Sauvant', 'Oliver Thews', 'Michael Gekle']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Impact of extracellular acidosis on intracellular pH control and cell signaling in tumor cells.', 'Acidic environment activates inflammatory programs in fibroblasts via a cAMP-MAPK pathway.', 'Cyclic AMP promotes cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-dependent induction of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2 and suppresses apoptosis of colon cancer cells through ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK.', 'Acidic priming enhances metastatic potential of cancer cells.', 'What do cellular responses to acidity tell us about cancer?', 'RAGE/SNAIL1 signaling drives epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Inhibition of high-voltage-activated calcium currents by acute hypoxia in cultured retinal ganglion cells.', 'Acidic Growth Conditions Promote Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition to Select More Aggressive PDAC Cell Phenotypes In Vitro.', 'Metabolic targeting, immunotherapy and radiation in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Where do we go from here?', 'Role of the mTOR Signalling Pathway During Extracellular Acidosis in Tumour Cells.']"""

Interviews with local subject matter experts informed the design of the strategy. The revised curriculum was pilot tested in 2009 with 63 men who completed pre- and posttest surveys that measured knowledge, norms, beliefs, decision self-efficacy, and screening intention. The intervention resulted in statistically significant improvement in prostate cancer knowledge, decreased perceived risks and barriers, and increased screening decision self-efficacy. The educational outreach strategy offered in community settings was effective in improving knowledge, beliefs, and decision self-efficacy related to prostate cancer screening. This project sought to devise a screening outreach strategy that struck a balance between the imperatives of informed decision-making goals and the pragmatics of community settings.

We hypothesized that ATN-224 may induce antitumor effects as an antiangiogenic agent at low dose-levels while possessing direct antitumor activity at higher dose-levels. The objective of this study was to screen its clinical activity in patients with biochemically recurrent hormone-naïve prostate cancer.  Methods:   Biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer patients with prostate specific antigen doubling times (PSADT) < 12 months, no radiographic evidence of metastasis, and no hormonal therapy within 6 months (with serum testosterone levels > 150 ng/dl) were eligible. ATN-224 was administered at 2 dose-levels, 300 mg (n = 23) or 30 mg (n = 24) daily, by way of randomization. PSA progression was defined as a ≥ 50% increase (and >5 ng/ml) in PSA from baseline or post-treatment nadir. Endpoints included the proportion of patients who were free of PSA progression at 24 weeks, changes in PSA slope/PSADT, and safety. The study was not powered to detect differences between the 2 treatment groups.  Results:   At 24 weeks, 59% (95% CI 33%-82%) of men in the low-dose arm and 45% (95% CI 17%-77%) in the high-dose arm were PSA progression-free. Median PSA progression-free survival was 30 weeks (95% CI 21-40(+)) and 26 weeks (95% CI 24-39(+)) in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively. Pre- and on-treatment PSA kinetics analyses showed a significant mean PSA slope decrease (P = 0.006) and a significant mean PSADT increase (P = 0.032) in the low-dose arm only. Serum ceruloplasmin levels, a biomarker for ATN-224 activity, were lowered in the high-dose group, but did not correlate with PSA changes.  Conclusions:   Low-dose ATN-224 (30 mg daily) may have biologic activity in men with biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer, as suggested by an improvement in PSA kinetics.

Statins are small molecules that suppress the production of multiple hydrophobic substrates in the mevalonate pathway. Although still controversial, statins may decrease the risk of certain cancers such as colon cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. Since the evaluations of the direct effect of statins on malignant mesothelioma are still few, the present study was done to evaluate the effects of lovastatin on ACC-MESO-1 cells in vivo and to investigate the potential mechanisms involved in vitro.  Materials and methods:   The in vivo effect of lovastatin was evaluated using an NOD/SCID/γnull (NOG) mouse model of human malignant mesothelioma using ACC-MESO-1 cells. Lovastatin was also applied to ACC-MESO-1 cells in vitro and the effects were observed.  Results:   Lovastatin administration reduced primary tumor and metastasis in the NOG mouse model of human malignant mesothelioma. In vitro studies showed that lovastatin administration induced cytostatic effects as per reduced cell viability and cell migration in ACC-MESO-1 cells. These effects were suggested to be dependent on autophagic changes rather than apoptosis. Furthermore, induction of autophagic changes by lovastatin in ACC-MESO-1 cells was independent of mTOR, and was considered to be dependent at least in part on Rac/phospholipase C/ inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate axis.

Despite the important role of IGF-1R signaling in radioresistance, studies of such agents in combination with radiotherapy are lagging behind. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the small molecule IGF-1R kinase inhibitor NVP-AEW541 on the intrinsic radioresistance of prostate cancer cells.  Methods and materials:   The effect of NVP-AEW541 on cell proliferation, cell viability, IGF-1R signaling, radiosensitivity, cell cycle distribution, and double strand break repair was determined in three human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, 22Rv1). Moreover, the importance of the PTEN pathway status was explored by means of transfection experiments with constitutively active Akt or inactive kinase-dead Akt.  Results:   NVP-AEW541 inhibited cell proliferation and decreased cell viability in a time-and dose-dependent manner in all three cell lines. Radiosensitization was observed in the PTEN wild-type cell lines DU145 and 22Rv1 but not in the PTEN-deficient PC3 cell line. NVP-AEW541-induced radiosensitization coincided with downregulation of phospho-Akt levels and high levels of residual double strand breaks. The importance of PTEN status in the radiosensitization effect was confirmed by transfection experiments with constitutively active Akt or inactive kinase-dead Akt.  Conclusions:   NVP-AEW541 enhances the effect of ionizing radiation in PTEN wild-type, but not in PTEN-deficient, prostate cancer cells.

In contrast to PC3 and LNCaP cells, HNE-treated DU145 cells showed a smaller reduction in growth and did not undergo apoptosis. In DU145 cells, HNE did not induce ROS production and DNA damage and generated a lower amount of HNE-protein adducts. DU145 cells had a greater GSH and GST A4 content and GSH/GST-mediated HNE detoxification. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a regulator of the antioxidant response. Nrf2 protein content and nuclear accumulation were higher in DU145 cells compared to PC3 and LNCaP cells, whereas the expression of KEAP1, the main negative regulator of Nrf2 activity, was lower. Inhibition of Nrf2 expression with specific siRNA resulted in a reduction in GST A4 expression and GS-HNE formation, indicating that Nrf2 controls HNE metabolism. In addition, Nrf2 knockdown sensitized DU145 cells to HNE-mediated antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity.

Therefore, automated cancer segmentation using multiparametric MRI is receiving a growing interest, since MRI can provide both morphological and functional images for tissue of interest. However, all automated methods to this date are applicable to a single zone of the prostate, and the peripheral zone (PZ) of the prostate needs to be extracted manually, which is a tedious and time-consuming job. In this paper, our goal is to remove the need of PZ extraction by incorporating the spatial and geometric information of prostate tumors with multiparametric MRI derived from T2-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).  Methods:   In order to remove the need of PZ extraction, the authors propose a new method to incorporate the spatial information of the cancer. This is done by introducing a new feature called location map. This new feature is constructed by applying a nonlinear transformation to the spatial position coordinates of each pixel, so that the location map implicitly represents the geometric position of each pixel with respect to the prostate region. Then, this new feature is combined with multiparametric MR images to perform tumor localization. The proposed algorithm is applied to multiparametric prostate MRI data obtained from 20 patients with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer.  Results:   The proposed method which does not need the masks of PZ was found to have prostate cancer detection specificity of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.80 and dice coefficient value of 0.42.  Conclusions:   The authors have found that fusing the spatial information allows us to obtain tumor outline without the need of PZ extraction with a considerable success (better or similar performance to methods that require manual PZ extraction). Our experimental results quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, depicting that the proposed method has a slightly better or similar localization performance compared to methods which require the masks of PZ.""","""['Xin Liu', 'Imam Samil Yetik']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Supervised and unsupervised methods for prostate cancer segmentation with multispectral MRI.', 'Automated segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on T2-weighted (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map MR images using U-Nets.', 'Peripheral zone prostate cancer localization by multiparametric magnetic resonance at 3 T: unbiased cancer identification by matching to histopathology.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Diffusion-weighted MRI and its role in prostate cancer.', 'Detection of prostate cancer with multiparametric MRI utilizing the anatomic structure of the prostate.', 'MRI-based prostate cancer detection with high-level representation and hierarchical classification.', 'Computer aided diagnosis of prostate cancer: A texton based approach.', 'Computer-aided Detection of Prostate Cancer with MRI: Technology and Applications.', 'Automated prostate cancer detection using T2-weighted and high-b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

Methods:   A multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) was used to produce sets of IMRT plans. The MOEA consisted of two interacting algorithms: (i) a deterministic inverse planning optimization of beamlet intensities that minimizes a weighted sum of quadratic penalty objectives to generate IMRT plans and (ii) an evolutionary algorithm that selects the superior IMRT plans using decision criteria and uses those plans to determine the new weights and penalty objectives of each new plan. Plans resulting from the deterministic algorithm were evaluated by the evolutionary algorithm using a set of decision criteria for both targets and organs at risk (OARs). Decision criteria used included variation in the target dose distribution, mean dose, maximum dose, generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD), an equivalent uniform dose (EUD(alpha,beta) formula derived from the linear-quadratic survival model, and points on dose volume histograms (DVHs). In order to quantatively compare results from trials using different decision criteria, a neutral set of comparison metrics was used. For each set of decision criteria investigated, IMRT plans were calculated for four different cases: two simple prostate cases, one complex prostate Case, and one complex head and neck Case.  Results:   When smaller numbers of decision criteria, more descriptive decision criteria, or less anti-correlated decision criteria were used to characterize plan quality during multiobjective optimization, dose to OARs and target dose variation were reduced in the final population of plans. Mean OAR dose and gEUD (a = 4) decision criteria were comparable. Using maximum dose decision criteria for OARs near targets resulted in inferior populations that focused solely on low target variance at the expense of high OAR dose. Target dose range, (D(max) - D(min)), decision criteria were found to be most effective for keeping targets uniform. Using target gEUD decision criteria resulted in much lower OAR doses but much higher target dose variation. EUD(alpha,beta) based decision criteria focused on a region of plan space that was a compromise between target and OAR objectives. None of these target decision criteria dominated plans using other criteria, but only focused on approaching a different area of the Pareto front.  Conclusions:   The choice of decision criteria implemented in the MOEA had a significant impact on the region explored and the rate of convergence toward the Pareto front. When more decision criteria, anticorrelated decision criteria, or decision criteria with insufficient information were implemented, inferior populations are resulted. When more informative decision criteria were used, such as gEUD, EUD(alpha,beta), target dose range, and mean dose, MOEA optimizations focused on approaching different regions of the Pareto front, but did not dominate each other. Using simple OAR decision criteria and target EUD(alpha,beta) decision criteria demonstrated the potential to generate IMRT plans that significantly reduce dose to OARs while achieving the same or better tumor control when clinical requirements on target dose variance can be met or relaxed.""","""['Clay Holdsworth', 'Robert D Stewart', 'Minsun Kim', 'Jay Liao', 'Mark H Phillips']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A hierarchical evolutionary algorithm for multiobjective optimization in IMRT.', 'The use of a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to increase flexibility in the search for better IMRT plans.', 'PARETO: A novel evolutionary optimization approach to multiobjective IMRT planning.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Outcome-based multiobjective optimization of lymphoma radiation therapy plans.', 'Prescription Value-Based Automatic Optimization of Importance Factors in Inverse Planning.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'Personalized treatment planning with a model of radiation therapy outcomes for use in multiobjective optimization of IMRT plans for prostate cancer.', 'How to compare treatment plans?

The second approach was a binary classifier based on support vector machines (SVM).  Results:   The ANN and SVM-based solutions showed comparable prediction accuracy, exhibiting an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.7.

A number of virtual TURP simulators have been validated in the past. This study is the first description and preliminary evaluation of a non-virtual, low-cost TURP trainer as a teaching tool for residents in urology.  Methods:   Dr K. Forke's prostatic resection trainer (PRT; LS 10-2/S, Samed GmbH, Dresden, Germany) was tested during the surgical training of a resident. Under the supervision of an experienced senior surgeon, three aspects were examined: the resection trainer's approximation to reality, the ease of instruction, and the potential capability to improve surgeons' psychomotor abilities with regard to the three-dimensional (3D) guidance of the instrument. The improvement in resection speed (RS) of residents with no PRT training (control group) was also compared to the results of the PRT-trained resident.  Results:   During the PRT training, the resident displayed clear improvement in resection quality (RQ) and a 27% increase in RS (p = 0.03). In the post-training stage, the PRT-trained resident showed a more constant progress rate, to a maximum RS of 0.37 g/min (35% increase; p = 0.01), whereas the control group displayed varied RS learning curves. Composed of a synthetic material, which can be resected by standard instruments, the trainer offers a haptical experience that is particularly realistic and may provide an increased learning rate.  Conclusion:   From the findings, we conclude that this novel PRT is suitable for daily use and offers an effective and more affordable alternative to virtual simulators.

Radiation therapy has been widely used for bone metastasis. However, it remains a challenging therapy because no radiation therapeutic guidelines, including radiation dose, radiation field, and fractionation, for patients with bone metastasis have been established. Many randomized controlled trials for bone metastasis have been carried out. They showed no significant difference in pain relief with a short course of radiation therapy such as 8 Gy/1 Fr and 20 Gy/5 Fr or with a long course of radiation therapy such as 30 Gy/10 Fr, 37.5 Gy/15 Fr, and 40 Gy/20 Fr. Toxicity rates with short and long courses were also the same. Recurrence rate at 2 years, however, was significantly higher in patients irradiated with a short course than in patients irradiated with a long course. Those trials also showed that response rate is affected by patient's age, performance state, tumor type, pathological state, number of metastatic tumors, and span from diagnosis of cancer to development of metastatic tumor. Breast cancer has a better prognosis than most other cancers. Recently, there have been significant advances in cancer therapy techniques and improvement in clinical results. Bone metastasis can cause extreme pain and motor deficits. Quality of life for patients with bone metastasis is drastically worsened. Patients with bad prognosis should be treated with radiation therapy when analgesia is the main aim of treatment. Survival of patients with oligometastasis or predominantly bone metastasis is expected to be better than that of patients with visceral metastasis. For patients with vertebral or weight-bearing long bone metastasis, long-course therapy is recommended. Many patients who are expected to have a good prognosis should be treated with a long course of radiation.""","""['Masaharu Fujino', 'Keishiro Suzuki', 'Masamichi Nishio', 'Noriaki Nishiyama', 'Yasuhiro Osaka']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Breast Cancer""","""['Prognostic factors for local control and survival after radiotherapy of metastatic spinal cord compression.', 'Prognostic factors predicting functional outcomes, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival after radiotherapy for metastatic spinal cord compression in breast cancer patients.', 'Value of high-dose radiation therapy for isolated osseous metastasis in breast cancer in terms of oligo-recurrence.', 'Role of palliative and symptomatic radiotherapy in bone metastasis.', 'Bisphosphonates for cancer patients: why, how, and when?', 'Radiation therapy for oligometastatic bone disease in breast cancer.', 'Bone metastases in breast cancer: Frequency, metastatic pattern and non-systemic locoregional therapy.', 'Radiotherapy in patients with distant metastatic breast cancer.', 'An effective therapy to painful bone metastases: cryoablation combined with zoledronic acid.']"""

The target genes deregulated by this rearrangement, however, remain mostly unknown. To address this subject we performed genome-wide mRNA expression analysis on 6 non-malignant prostate samples and 24 prostate carcinomas with (n = 16) and without (n = 8) TMPRSS2-ERG fusion as determined by FISH. The top-most differentially expressed genes and their associations with ERG over-expression were technically validated by quantitative real-time PCR and biologically validated in an independent series of 200 prostate carcinomas. Several genes encoding metabolic enzymes or extracellular/transmembrane proteins involved in cell adhesion, matrix remodeling and signal transduction pathways were found to be co-expressed with ERG. Within those significantly over-expressed in fusion-positive carcinomas, CRISP3 showed more than a 50-fold increase when compared to fusion-negative carcinomas, whose expression levels were in turn similar to that of non-malignant samples. In the independent validation series, ERG and CRISP3 mRNA levels were strongly correlated (r(s) = 0.65, p<0.001) and both were associated with pT3 disease staging. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry results showed CRISP3 protein overexpression in 63% of the carcinomas and chromatin immunoprecipitation with an anti-ERG antibody showed that CRISP3 is a direct target of the transcription factor ERG. We conclude that ERG rearrangement is associated with significant expression alterations in genes involved in critical cellular pathways that define a subset of locally advanced PCa.

We used the mapping of DNase I hypersensitive sites as a tool to prioritise regions for further functional analysis. This approach identified rs378854, which is in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs620861, as a novel functional prostate cancer-specific genetic variant. We demonstrate that the risk allele (G) of rs378854 reduces binding of the transcription factor YY1 in vitro. This factor is known to repress global transcription in prostate cancer and is a candidate tumour suppressor. Additional experiments showed that the YY1 binding site is occupied in vivo in prostate cancer, but not breast cancer cells, consistent with the observed cancer-specific effects of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Using chromatin conformation capture (3C) experiments, we found that the region surrounding rs378854 interacts with the MYC and PVT1 promoters. Moreover, expression of the PVT1 oncogene in normal prostate tissue increased with the presence of the risk allele of rs378854, while expression of MYC was not affected.

Given the lack of specificity and unclear mortality benefit of PSA testing, methods to individualize management of elevated PSA are needed. Greater than 50% of PSA-screened prostate cancers harbor fusions between the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (avian) (ERG) genes. Here, we report a clinical-grade, transcription-mediated amplification assay to risk stratify and detect prostate cancer noninvasively in urine. The TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcript was quantitatively measured in prospectively collected whole urine from 1312 men at multiple centers. Urine TMPRSS2:ERG was associated with indicators of clinically significant cancer at biopsy and prostatectomy, including tumor size, high Gleason score at prostatectomy, and upgrading of Gleason grade at prostatectomy. TMPRSS2:ERG, in combination with urine prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), improved the performance of the multivariate Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator in predicting cancer on biopsy. In the biopsy cohorts, men in the highest and lowest of three TMPRSS2:ERG+PCA3 score groups had markedly different rates of cancer, clinically significant cancer by Epstein criteria, and high-grade cancer on biopsy.

By using a specific antagonist that binds the C-terminal RGG domain of nucleolin, the HB-19 pseudopeptide, we recently reported that targeting surface nucleolin with HB-19 suppresses progression of established human breast tumor cells in the athymic nude mice, and delays development of spontaneous melanoma in the RET transgenic mice.  Methods:   By the capacity of HB-19 to bind stably surface nucleolin, we purified and identified nucleolin partners at the cell surface. HB-19 and related multivalent Nucant pseudopeptides, that present pentavalently or hexavalently the tripeptide Lysψ(CH2N)-Pro-Arg, were then used to show that targeting surface nucleolin results in distinct inhibitory mechanisms on breast, prostate, colon carcinoma and leukemia cells.  Results:   Surface nucleolin exists in a 500-kDa protein complex including several other proteins, which we identified by microsequencing as two Wnt related proteins, Ku86 autoantigen, signal recognition particle subunits SRP68/72, the receptor for complement component gC1q-R, and ribosomal proteins S4/S6. Interestingly, some of the surface-nucleolin associated proteins are implicated in cell signaling, tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion, cell death, autoimmunity, and bacterial infections. Surface nucleolin in the 500-kDa complex is highly stable. Surface nucleolin antagonists, HB-19 and related multivalent Nucant pseudopeptides, exert distinct inhibitory mechanisms depending on the malignant tumor cell type. For example, in epithelial tumor cells they inhibit cell adhesion or spreading and induce reversion of the malignant phenotype (BMC cancer 2010, 10:325) while in leukemia cells they trigger a rapid cell death associated with DNA fragmentation. The fact that these pseudopeptides do not cause cell death in epithelial tumor cells indicates that cell death in leukemia cells is triggered by a specific signaling mechanism, rather than nonspecific cellular injury.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that targeting surface nucleolin could change the organization of the 500-kDa complex to interfere with the proper functioning of surface nucleolin and the associated proteins, and thus lead to distinct inhibitory mechanisms. Consequently, HB-19 and related Nucant pseudopeptides provide novel therapeutic opportunities in treatment of a wide variety of cancers and related malignancies.""","""['Bernard Krust', 'Diala El Khoury', 'Isabelle Nondier', 'Calaiselvy Soundaramourty', 'Ara G Hovanessian']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Targeting surface nucleolin with a multivalent pseudopeptide delays development of spontaneous melanoma in RET transgenic mice.', 'Suppression of tumor growth and angiogenesis by a specific antagonist of the cell-surface expressed nucleolin.', 'Suppression of tumorigenicity of rhabdoid tumor derived G401 cells by the multivalent HB-19 pseudopeptide that targets surface nucleolin.', 'Midkine, a cytokine that inhibits HIV infection by binding to the cell surface expressed nucleolin.', 'Cell surface nucleolin as active bait for nanomedicine in cancer therapy: a promising option.', 'Quantum Dot-Based Screening Identifies F3 Peptide and Reveals Cell Surface Nucleolin as a Therapeutic Target for Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Proteomic-Based Machine Learning Analysis Reveals PYGB as a Novel Immunohistochemical Biomarker to Distinguish Inverted Urothelial Papilloma From Low-Grade Papillary Urothelial Carcinoma With Inverted Growth.', 'Cell surface nucleolin is a novel ADAMTS5 receptor mediating endothelial cell apoptosis.', 'Targeting the oncogenic TBX3:nucleolin complex to treat multiple sarcoma subtypes.', 'Nucleolin Aptamer N6L Reprograms the Translational Machinery and Acts Synergistically with mTORi to Inhibit Pancreatic Cancer Proliferation.']"""

Results:   • We analysed data from 905 patients, including 528 (58.3%) with positive biopsy findings. • Using 150 mg/dL as the threshold point of TG levels, multivariate analysis yielded an adjusted odds ratio (OR) reflecting the association of higher TG levels with prostate cancer diagnosis of 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-2.29, P = 0.002). • Pearson correlation coefficient analysis including age, PSA level, prostatic volume, BMI and TG, showed TG level significantly correlated with BMI (r = 0.185, P < 0.001). • In the analysis by age intervals (≤59, 60-69, and ≥70 years), the association between high TG levels and positive biopsy findings was enhanced in the age groups 60-69 and ≥70 years (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.31-3.37, P = 0.002 and OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.03-3.53, P = 0.039, respectively), but not in the group aged ≤59 years. • In patients aged ≥60 years, high TG levels were statistically significantly associated with a Gleason score of ≥8.

These alternatives include the currently accepted deterministic growth model. The paper reports strong empirical evidence in favour of the Geometric Browning Motion model. A model that best describes PSA evolution is a prerequisite to the establishment of decision-making criteria for abandoning active surveillance (i.e. a strategy that involves close monitoring) in early stage prostate cancer.

There is evidence suggesting that the serine protease activity of PSA could be involved in the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer. In this study, we determined the effects of PSA and its precursor, pro-PSA, on invasion and the type of bone metastasis.  Methods:   We stably transfected prostate adenocarcinoma cells, human DU-145 and rat MatLyLu, with either the full-length prepro-PSA sequence or pre-PSA DNA, to generate subclones of cells that secrete pro-PSA or free PSA, respectively. Secretion of PSA was measured by western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The invasive and migratory properties of the cells were determined using a basement membrane extract and were compared with corresponding empty vector control cells. Twelve days after injection of PSA-secreting MatLyLu cells into the femora of nude mice, bone tumor burden and histomorphometry were determined using a stereological technique.  Results:   The transfected cells secreted 0.15-2.23 ng PSA/10(6) cells/day. Pro-PSA-secreting subclones increased invasion and migration by 24-263%. Conversely, the PSA-secreting subclones significantly reduced both invasion and migration by 59-70%. The divergent effects on invasion and migration observed in pro-PSA- and PSA-secreting subclones indicate that different forms of PSA may have different functions. Intrafemoral injections with PSA-secreting MatLyLu cells resulted in an increase in osteoblastic parameters when compared with non-PSA-secreting subclones as measured by bone histomorphometry. Concomitantly, a decrease in osteoclasts and eroded surface was observed.  Conclusions:   Our in vitro data suggest that PSA, dependent on the predominant form secreted, may decrease or increase invasive properties of prostate cancer cells.

In human tumors, uPA and uPAR are expressed in tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). TAMs localize to solid tumors and contribute to increased tumor growth and the metastatic phenotype. In this study, we utilized a coculture system of PC-3 prostate tumor cells and macrophages [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-differentiated human leukemia HL-60 cells] to investigate the hypothesis that macrophages stimulate the production of the prometastatic variant α6pβ1 on human prostate cancer cells via the uPA/uPAR axis. Our results indicate that adherent macrophages cocultured with PC-3 cells increased PC-3 uPAR mRNA, uPAR cell surface protein expression and α6 integrin cleavage. The stimulation does not require macrophage/tumor cell contact because macrophage conditioned medium is sufficient for increased uPAR transcription and α6 cleavage-dependent PC-3 cell invasion. The increased cleavage was dependent on uPAR because production was blocked by silencing RNA-targeting uPAR. These results indicate that macrophages can stimulate uPA/uPAR production in tumor cells which results in α6 integrin cleavage. These data suggest that TAMs promote prometastatic integrin-dependent pericellular proteolysis.""","""['Isis C Sroka', 'Cynthia P Sandoval', 'Harsharon Chopra', 'Jaime M C Gard', 'Sangita C Pawar', 'Anne E Cress']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Interleukin-1alpha enhances the aggressive behavior of pancreatic cancer cells by regulating the alpha6beta1-integrin and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor expression.', 'Activation of urokinase plasminogen activator and its receptor axis is essential for macrophage infiltration in a prostate cancer mouse model.', 'RNA interference-directed knockdown of urokinase plasminogen activator and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor inhibits prostate cancer cell invasion, survival, and tumorigenicity in vivo.', 'The laminin binding integrin alpha6beta1 in prostate cancer perineural invasion.', 'Mechanism of tumor cell-induced extracellular matrix degradation--inhibition of cell-surface proteolytic activity might have a therapeutic effect on tumor cell invasion and metastasis.', 'Macrophages and Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor System in Multiple Myeloma: Case Series and Literature Review.', 'The Roles of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of secreted extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT) in prostate cancer progression: Novel biomarker and therapeutic target.', 'Non-genomic Actions of Thyroid Hormones Regulate the Growth and Angiogenesis of T Cell Lymphomas.', 'Translational Significance for Tumor Metastasis of Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.']"""

The segmentation of prostate lesions from TRUS images is very challenging due to issues, such as poor contrast, low SNRs, and irregular shape variations. To address these issues, a novel approach is employed to segment the lesions from the surrounding prostate, where region merging is performed via a region-merging likelihood function based on regional statistics, as well as Fisher-Tippett statistics. Experimental results using TRUS prostate images demonstrate that the proposed Fisher-Tippett region-merging approach achieves more accurate segmentation of prostate lesions when compared to other segmentation methods.""","""['Alexander Wong', 'Jacob Scharcanski']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Inf Technol Biomed""","""['Discrete deformable model guided by partial active shape model for TRUS image segmentation.', 'A medical texture local binary pattern for TRUS prostate segmentation.', 'A coarse-to-fine approach to prostate boundary segmentation in ultrasound images.', 'Hierarchical clustering method to improve transrectal ultrasound-guided diffuse optical tomography for prostate cancer imaging.', 'Transrectal three dimensional sonography.

Methods:   we propose multislice-to-volume registration algorithms for tracking the biopsy targets within the prostate. Three orthogonal plus additional transverse intraoperative slices are acquired in the approximate center of the prostate and registered with a high-resolution target planning volume. Both rigid and deformable scenarios were implemented. Both simulated and clinical MRI-guided robotic prostate biopsy data were used to assess tracking accuracy.  Results:   average registration errors in clinical patient data were 2.6 mm for the rigid algorithm and 2.1 mm for the deformable algorithm.  Conclusion:   rigid tracking appears to be promising.

In this series, we studied the effect of smoking on pathologic outcomes and biochemical recurrence in a cohort of men undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We identified 630 men who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1989 and 2005 who had detailed smoking histories. There were 321 smokers and 309 nonsmokers. Pathologic outcomes included prostate weight, volume of cancer, volume of high grade cancer, margin status, seminal vesicle involvement, extraprostatic extension, perineural invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, and the presence of nodal metastasis. Biochemical recurrence was defined as a postoperative PSA ≥ 0.1 ng/ml. Univariate analysis and multivariate linear and Cox regression were used to study the impact of smoking on these outcomes.  Results:   The volume of cancer (2.54 vs. 2.16 ml, P = 0.016) and the volume of high grade cancer (0.58 vs. 0.28 ml, P = 0.004) were greater in smokers compared with nonsmokers. Smoking independently predicted greater volumes of cancer and high grade cancer in multivariate analysis. Heavy smokers (≥20 pack-year history) had a greater risk of biochemical recurrence on univariate survival analysis. Smoking also predicted a greater risk of biochemical recurrence on Cox regression, the magnitude of which was approximately 1% per pack-year smoked.  Conclusions:   Smoking is associated with adverse pathologic features and a higher risk of biochemical recurrence in men undergoing radical prostatectomy.

This apoptosis is prevented by exogenous metabolites of 5-LOX, suggesting an essential role of 5-LOX metabolites in the survival of prostate cancer cells. However, downstream signaling mechanisms which mediate the survival-promoting effects of 5-LOX metabolites in prostate cancer cells are still unknown. Recently, we reported that MK591, a specific inhibitor of 5-LOX activity, induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells without inhibition of Akt, or ERK, two well-characterized regulators of pro-survival mechanisms, suggesting the existence of an Akt and ERK-independent survival mechanism in prostate cancer cells regulated by 5-LOX. Here, we report that 5-LOX inhibition-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells occurs via rapid inactivation of protein kinase C-epsilon (PKCε), and that exogenous 5-LOX metabolites prevent both 5-LOX inhibition-induced down-regulation of PKCε and induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, pre-treatment of prostate cancer cells with diazoxide (a chemical activator of PKCε), or KAE1-1 (a cell-permeable, octa-peptide specific activator of PKCε) prevents 5-LOX inhibition-induced apoptosis, which indicates that inhibition of 5-LOX triggers apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via down-regulation of PKCε. Altogether, these findings suggest that metabolism of arachidonic acid by 5-LOX activity promotes survival of prostate cancer cells via signaling through PKCε, a pro-survival serine/threonine kinase.""","""['Sivalokanathan Sarveswaran', 'Vijayalakshmi Thamilselvan', 'Chaya Brodie', 'Jagadananda Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase selectively triggers disruption of c-Myc signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'OXER1, a G protein-coupled oxoeicosatetraenoid receptor, mediates the survival-promoting effects of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase in prostate cancer cells.', 'Wedelolactone, a medicinal plant-derived coumestan, induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via downregulation of PKCε without inhibiting Akt.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

Off-target replication of oncolytic adenoviruses would have serious clinical consequences. As a proposed ex vivo test, we describe the assessment of the specificity of Ad[I/PPT-E1A] viral cytotoxicity and replication in human nonprostate primary cells. Four primary nonprostate cell types were selected to mimic the effects of potential in vivo exposure to Ad[I/PPT-E1A] virus: bronchial epithelial cells, urothelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and hepatocytes. Primary cells were analyzed for Ad[I/PPT-E1A] viral cytotoxicity in MTS assays, and viral replication was determined by hexon titer immunostaining assays to quantify viral hexon protein. The results revealed that at an extreme multiplicity of infection of 500, unlikely to be achieved in vivo, Ad[I/PPT-E1A] virus showed no significant cytotoxic effects in the nonprostate primary cell types apart from the hepatocytes. Transmission electron microscopy studies revealed high levels of Ad[I/PPT-E1A] sequestered in the cytoplasm of these cells. Adenoviral green fluorescent protein reporter studies showed no evidence for nuclear localization, suggesting that the cytotoxic effects of Ad[I/PPT-E1A] in human primary hepatocytes are related to viral sequestration. Also, hepatocytes had increased amounts of coxsackie adenovirus receptor surface protein. Active viral replication was only observed in the permissive primary prostate cells and LNCaP prostate cell line, and was not evident in any of the other nonprostate cells types tested, confirming the specificity of Ad[I/PPT-E1A].

Evidence indicates that 22 induced autophagy and apoptosis, both of which were integral to its antiproliferative activity.

Methods:   We analyzed 102 patients who were pathological T2 with positive surgical margins or pT3 without pathological lymph node metastasis or neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Patients were classified into three groups according to postoperative nadir PSA value: <0.01 ng/ml, ≥0.01 ng/ml but <0.02 ng/ml, and ≥0.02 but <0.10 ng/ml. PSA relapse-free rate was compared according to postoperative nadir PSA. Univariate and multivariate analyses with the Cox proportional hazards regression model identified prognostic factors for PSA relapse.  Results:   Of the 102 patients, 22 (21.6%) developed PSA relapse within a median follow-up time of 31.3 months. PSA relapse-free rate at 30 months was 81.2%. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that postoperative nadir PSA was the only statistically significant risk factor: postoperative nadir PSA ≥0.01 ng/ml but <0.02 ng/ml (P = 0.009, HR: 4.502, 95% CI: 1.457-13.916); ≥0.02 ng/ml but <0.10 ng/ml (P < 0.001, HR: 15.126, 95% CI: 4.738-48.292). PSA relapse-free rates at 30 months in patients with postoperative nadir PSA <0.01 ng/ml, ≥0.01 ng/ml but <0.02 ng/ml, and ≥0.02 ng/ml but <0.10 ng/ml were 91.9, 57.1, and 20.0%, respectively.

The mechanisms that result in increased nucleolar size, number and function in prostate cancer have not been fully elucidated. The nucleolus is formed around repeats of a transcriptional unit encoding a 45S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor that is then processed to yield the mature 18S, 5.8S and 28S RNA species. Although it has been generally accepted that tumor cells overexpress rRNA species, this has not been examined in clinical prostate cancer. We find that indeed levels of the 45S rRNA, 28S, 18S and 5.8S are overexpressed in the majority of human primary prostate cancer specimens as compared with matched benign tissues. One mechanism that can alter nucleolar function and structure in cancer cells is hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides of the upstream rDNA promoter region. However, this mechanism has not been examined in prostate cancer. To determine whether rRNA overexpression could be explained by hypomethylation of these CpG sites, we also evaluated the DNA methylation status of the rDNA promoter in prostate cancer cell lines and the clinical specimens. Bisulfite sequencing of genomic DNA revealed two roughly equal populations of loci in cell lines consisting of those that contained densely methylated deoxycytidine residues within CpGs and those that were largely unmethylated. All clinical specimens also contained two populations with no marked changes in methylation of this region in cancer as compared with normal. We recently reported that MYC can regulate rRNA levels in human prostate cancer; here we show that MYC mRNA levels are correlated with 45S, 18S and 5.8S rRNA levels. Further, as a surrogate for nucleolar size and number, we examined the expression of fibrillarin, which did not correlate with rRNA levels. We conclude that rRNA levels are increased in human prostate cancer, but that hypomethylation of the rDNA promoter does not explain this increase, nor does hypomethylation explain alterations in nucleolar number and structure in prostate cancer cells. Rather, rRNA levels and nucleolar size and number relate more closely to MYC overexpression.""","""['M Uemura', 'Q Zheng', 'C M Koh', 'W G Nelson', 'S Yegnasubramanian', 'A M De Marzo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Overexpression of Ribosomal RNA in the Development of Human Cervical Cancer Is Associated with rDNA Promoter Hypomethylation.', 'Reduced ribosomal RNA expression and unchanged ribosomal DNA promoter methylation in oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Relative expression of rRNA transcripts and 45S rDNA promoter methylation status are dysregulated in tumors in comparison with matched-normal tissues in breast cancer.', 'Regulation of Pol I-transcribed 45S rDNA and Pol III-transcribed 5S rDNA in Arabidopsis.', 'Structure and epigenetics of nucleoli in comparison with non-nucleolar compartments.', 'Regulation of RNA Polymerase I Stability and Function.', 'Ribosome-Directed Therapies in Cancer.', 'Amelioration for an ignored pitfall in reference gene selection by considering the mean expression and standard deviation of target genes.', 'Differential Sensitivity of the Protein Translation Initiation Machinery and mTOR Signaling to MECP2 Gain- and Loss-of-Function Involves MeCP2 Isoform-Specific Homeostasis in the Brain.', 'Human rDNA and Cancer.']"""

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most prevalent malignancy among males, characterized by high mortality rates. Aberrant DNA methylation in promoters of tumor suppressor genes is an early and frequent event during prostate carcinogenesis. Modern techniques allow a sensitive detection of DNA methylation biomarkers in bodily fluids from cancer patients offering a noninvasive tool for PCa monitoring. Our study aimed at the analysis of DNA methylation in urine sediments from PCa patients for the selection of most informative noninvasive biomarkers. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of methylated RASSF1, RARB, and GSTP1 genes in catheterized urine specimens from 34 patients with biopsy-proven early or medium stage PCa. RESULTS. At least one gene was methylated in urine sediments from 28 cases with PCa, with a sensitivity of the test reaching 82%. RASSF1 was methylated in 71% (24 of 34), RARB in 44% (15 of 34), and GSTP1 in 3% (1 of 34) of the specimens. High level of methylation (≥50%) in RARB and RASSF1 genes was detected in 40% and 20% of cases, respectively. A significant association was observed between high level of RARB methylation and Gleason score (P=0.01), while methylation of at least one gene occurred more frequently in urine DNA of older patients (P=0.02).

Lrig1 is expressed at low levels in several cancer types but is overexpressed in some prostate and colorectal tumors. Given this heterogeneity, whether Lrig1 functions to suppress or promote tumor growth remains a critical question. Previously, we found that Lrig1 was poorly expressed in ErbB2-positive breast cancer, suggesting that Lrig1 has a growth-inhibitory role in this tumor type. However, breast cancer is a complex disease, with ErbB2-positive tumors accounting for just 25% of all breast cancers. To gain a better understanding of the role of Lrig1 in breast cancer, we examined its expression in estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive disease which accounts for the majority of breast cancers. We find that Lrig1 is expressed at significantly higher levels in ERα-positive disease than in ERα-negative disease. Our study provides a molecular rationale for Lrig1 enrichment in ERα-positive disease by showing that Lrig1 is a target of ERα. Estrogen stimulates Lrig1 accumulation and disruption of this induction enhances estrogen-dependent tumor cell growth, suggesting that Lrig1 functions as an estrogen-regulated growth suppressor. In addition, we find that Lrig1 expression correlates with prolonged relapse-free survival in ERα-positive breast cancer, identifying Lrig1 as a new prognostic marker in this setting. Finally, we show that ErbB2 activation antagonizes ERα-driven Lrig1 expression, providing a mechanistic explanation for Lrig1 loss in ErbB2-positive breast cancer.

A total of 542 unaffected men who had at least one brother who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer regarding their use of vitamins and supplements, as well as the motivation for use, were interviewed.  Methods:   The associations between subject characteristics and vitamin and supplement use were evaluated using an unconditional logistic regression modeling approach.  Results:   Overall, 59.2% and 36.5% of men reported ever using and currently using, respectively, one or more vitamins or supplements (including multivitamins). One third of men took a vitamin or supplement that has been targeted for prostate health or cancer prevention, including green tea, magnesium, male hormones, saw palmetto, selenium, soy, vitamins A, C, E, and zinc.

Treatments are associated with morbidity. Results for functional outcome and quality of life are rarely reported beyond 10 years and are lacking from randomised settings. We report results for quality of life for men in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4 (SPCG-4) after a median follow-up of more than 12 years.  Methods:   All living Swedish and Finnish men (400 of 695) randomly assigned to radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting in SPCG-4 from 1989 to 1999 were included in our analysis. An additional 281 men were included in a population-based control group matched for region and age. Physical symptoms, symptom-induced stress, and self-assessed quality of life were evaluated with a study-specific questionnaire. Longitudinal data were available for 166 Swedish men who had answered quality-of-life questionnaires at an earlier timepoint.  Findings:   182 (88%) of 208 men in the radical prostatectomy group, 167 (87%) of 192 men in the watchful-waiting group, and 214 (76%) of 281 men in the population-based control group answered the questionnaire. Men in SPCG-4 had a median follow-up of 12·2 years (range 7-17) and a median age of 77·0 years (range 61-88). High self-assessed quality of life was reported by 62 (35%) of 179 men allocated radical prostatectomy, 55 (34%) of 160 men assigned to watchful waiting, and 93 (45%) of 208 men in the control group. Anxiety was higher in the SPCG-4 groups (77 [43%] of 178 and 69 [43%] of 161 men) than in the control group (68 [33%] of 208 men; relative risk 1·42, 95% CI 1·07-1·88). Prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 84% (146 of 173 men) in the radical prostatectomy group, 80% (122 of 153) in the watchful-waiting group, and 46% (95 of 208) in the control group and prevalence of urinary leakage was 41% (71 of 173), 11% (18 of 164), and 3% (six of 209), respectively. Distress caused by these symptoms was reported significantly more often by men allocated radical prostatectomy than by men assigned to watchful waiting. In a longitudinal analysis of men in SPCG-4 who provided information at two follow-up points 9 years apart, 38 (45%) of 85 men allocated radical prostatectomy and 48 (60%) of 80 men allocated watchful waiting reported an increase in number of physical symptoms; 50 (61%) of 82 and 47 (64%) of 74 men, respectively, reported a reduction in quality of life.  Interpretation:   For men in SPCG-4, negative side-effects were common and added more stress than was reported in the control population. In the radical prostatectomy group, erectile dysfunction and urinary leakage were often consequences of surgery. In the watchful-waiting group, side-effects can be caused by tumour progression. The number and severity of side-effects changes over time at a higher rate than is caused by normal ageing and a loss of sexual ability is a persistent psychological problem for both interventions.

To solve geometric anatomic constraints, including rectal size and distance from the prostate, we developed a technique that modifies the geometry by noninvasive direct intervention.  Methods and materials:   In a patient with local recurrence of prostate cancer at 18 months after initial radiotherapy of 61.8 GyE(LQ2,3) (gray equivalent in 2 Gy/fraction at α/β=3 calculated with linear quadratic [LQ] model) to the prostate, we prescribed 16 Gy (60.8 GyE(LQ2,3) or 78.2 GyE(LQ2,1.6)) of reirradiation by high-dose-rate brachytherapy, using a bolus injection of native-type hyaluronate to create and maintain a distance between the prostate and the rectum and decrease rectal size during treatment.  Results:   The procedure was achieved in 10min, without complications. Rectal D(2cc) of the reirradiation was 5.58 Gy (9.58 GyE(LQ2,3)). Compared with the initial radiation, the gel injection resulted in an improved therapeutic ratio. The patient was regularly followed up at our clinic; at over 3.5 years after reirradiation, there was no evidence of recurrence or radiation-related toxicities greater than Grade 2, maintaining a nadir prostate-specific antigen level of 0.03 ng/mL without hormonal therapy.

As the chemokine receptor CCR5 is over-expressed in more aggressive forms of prostate cancer, and is also a critical receptor in inflammation, chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonists could potentially act as anti-prostate cancer agents. Anibamine, a natural product CCR5 antagonist, provides a unique molecular scaffold for the generation of novel analogs with possible anti-prostate cancer activity. A series of analogs of anibamine were designed, synthesized and tested against several prostate cancer cell lines. The analogs all acted as CCR5 antagonists at micromolar range affinity to the receptor while their anti-proliferative activity varied depending on the cell line type and their chemical structural properties. Further basal cytotoxicity characterization on these compounds indicated some of them may be suitable for in vivo studies.""","""['Kendra M Haney', 'Feng Zhang', 'Christopher K Arnatt', 'Yunyun Yuan', 'Guo Li', 'Joy L Ware', 'David A Gewirtz', 'Yan Zhang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem Lett""","""['Structure activity relationship studies of natural product chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist anibamine toward the development of novel anti prostate cancer agents.', 'Exploration on natural product anibamine side chain modification toward development of novel CCR5 antagonists and potential anti-prostate cancer agents.', 'Design, syntheses, and characterization of pharmacophore based chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonists as anti prostate cancer agents.', 'Ursane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids as useful platforms to discover anticancer drugs.', 'A dual CCR2/CCR5 chemokine antagonist, BMS-813160?

Objective:   To identify the optimal combination of sampling sites (number and location) to detect prostate cancer (PCa) in patients previously submitted to an initial negative prostatic biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic 24-core prostate biopsy (24PBx) was performed prospectively in 340 consecutive patients after a first negative biopsy (at least 12 cores).  Measurements:   We relied on a classification and regression tree analysis to identify three clinically different subgroups of patients at dissimilar risk of harboring PCa at second biopsy. Subsequently, we set the cancer-positive rate of the 24PBx at 100% and calculated PCa detection rates for 255 possible combinations of sampling sites. We selected the optimal biopsy scheme (defined as the combination of sampling sites that detected 95% of all the cancers with the minimal number of biopsy cores) for each patient subgroup.  Results and limitations:   After an initial negative biopsy, cancer was detected at rebiopsy in 95 men (27.9%). At a given number of cores, the cancer detection rates varied significantly according to the different combination of sites considered. Three different PCa risk groups were identified: (1) previous report of atypical small acinar proliferation of the prostate (ASAP), (2) no previous ASAP and ratio of free prostate-specific antigen (fPSA) to total PSA (%fPSA) ≤10%, and (3) no previous ASAP and %fPSA >10%. For patients with previous ASAP or patients with no previous ASAP and %fPSA ≤10%, two schemes with different combinations of 14 cores were most favorable. The optimal sampling in patients with no previous ASAP and %fPSA >10% was a scheme with a combination of 20 cores.  Conclusions:   Both the number and the location of biopsy cores taken affect cancer detection rates in a repeated biopsy setting.

CaP has been associated with other common malignancies. Recently, numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with CaP susceptibility.  Methods:   We genotyped 1121 patients with CaP for 36 risk alleles known to be significantly associated with CaP susceptibility and determined their relationships to other malignancies in CaP probands and their first-degree relatives.  Results:   The most common other malignancies in the CaP probands were nonmelanoma skin cancer (13.6%), leukemia (7.3%), melanoma (3.9%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (0.7%), colorectal cancer (0.6%), and multiple myeloma (0.3%). Among the probands, a significantly increased frequency of leukemia was found in the carriers of SNP rs2736098 (5p15, P = .03) and melanoma in the carriers of either SNP rs1512268 (8p21, P = .006) or SNP rs5759167 (22q13, P = .02). Multiple myeloma was more common in carriers of SNP rs9364554 (6q25, P = .02). The probands who were carriers of SNP rs16901979 (8q24) were significantly more likely to report a family history of melanoma (P = .03), and the probands with a family history of multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's disease were significantly more likely to be carriers of SNP rs12621278 (2q31, P = .04) and rs6465657 (7q21, P = .02), respectively.

Methods:   Urine and serum samples from 930 men in the active arm were acquired at years 2 and 4 of the biopsy visits. In addition to univariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis, multivariate analysis for association with biopsy outcome was performed for PCA3 score in the presence of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), age, prostate volume, and family history of prostate cancer.  Results:   At year 2, the univariate PCA3 score area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.668 versus 0.603 for PSA. At year 4, the PCA3 assay significantly predicted the biopsy outcome (AUC 0.628, 95% confidence interval 0.556-0.700), and the PSA level was not predictive (AUC 0.556, 95% confidence interval 0.469-0.642). The year 2 multivariate model yielded an AUC of 0.712. Removing the PCA3 score decreased the AUC to 0.660 (P = .0166 vs the full model). The median PCA3 scores in the dutasteride arm were not different from those in the 1072 men in the placebo arm (16.2 and 17.2 at year 2, P = .1755; and 18.8 and 18.1 at year 4, P = .2340, respectively). However, the PSA values were reduced >50% in the dutasteride arm at both visits (both P < .0001 vs placebo). At a PCA3 score cutoff of 35, the sensitivity and specificity were equivalent between the 2 arms.  Conclusions:   In the present study, the PCA3 assay outperformed PSA for cancer detection in men undergoing dutasteride treatment and improved the diagnostic accuracy when combined with the PSA level and other clinical variables. In addition, no adjustment in PCA3 score was needed to yield equivalent clinical performance between the dutasteride and placebo arms.

The median number of biopsy cores was 59. Thirty patients received a leutinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide, whereas 52 patients received bicalutamide (50mg daily) and dutasteride (0.5mg daily). A transrectal ultrasound volumetric study of the prostate gland and ellipsoid volume determinations of the prostate gland and transition zone (TZ) were obtained immediately before TTMB and at 90 days (±7 days) after the initiation of neoadjuvant medical therapy. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of prostate gland and TZ volume reduction.  Results:   At TTMB, the mean prostate volumetric and ellipsoid volumes were 55.4 cm(3) and 49.0 cm(3), respectively.

Design:   We investigated the effects of a blocking antibody against the IGF-I receptor (αIR3) on DNA synthesis in prostate cancer cells cultured in the presence of recombinant human IGF-I or normal human serum (NHS).  Results:   We show that in all three prostate cancer cell lines, NHS exerts a markedly stronger stimulating effect on DNA synthesis than IGF-I, and that the effect of NHS can be completely abrogated by an antibody against the IGF-I receptor (αIR3). Using pharmacological inhibitors of the two canonical IGF-I receptor signaling pathways, we show that the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K) and the Mek-Erk pathways are not required for the stimulating effect of NHS.  Conclusion:   Our observations indicate that the stimulating effect of NHS is completely dependent on IGF-I receptor signaling transduction and that IGF-I stimulates DNA synthesis in prostate cancer cells in strong synergy with other serum factors. We speculate that the role of other serum factors could explain the discrepancy between the results observed in different animal models to study the function of IGF-I in prostate cancer.""","""['Eddy Himpe', 'Saranyapin Potikanond', 'Peggy Verdood', 'Ron Kooijman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Growth Horm IGF Res""","""['Regulation of interleukin-8 expression in human prostate cancer cells by insulin-like growth factor-I and inflammatory cytokines.', 'Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor blockade inhibits the action of EGF, insulin-like growth factor I, and a protein kinase A activator on the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Effect of zinc on regulation of insulin-like growth factor signaling in human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Plasma and tissue insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer and anti-IGF-IR agents as novel therapeutic strategy for refractory cases: a review.', 'Resveratrol reduces prostate cancer growth and metastasis by inhibiting the Akt/MicroRNA-21 pathway.']"""

We assessed the impact of PNI as well as pretreatment and treatment-related factors on freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), freedom from metastasis (FFM), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival.  Results:   PNI was present in 34% of specimens at biopsy and was significantly associated with higher Gleason score (GS), T stage, and prostate-specific antigen level. On univariate and multivariate analysis, the presence of PNI was associated with worse FFBF (hazard ratio = 1.7, p <0.006), FFM (hazard ratio = 1.8, p <0.03), and CSS (HR = 1.4, p <0.05) compared with absence of PNI; there was no difference in overall survival. Seven-year rates of FFBF, FFM, and CCS were 64% vs. 80%, 84% vs. 92%, and 91% vs. 95% for those patients with and without PNI, respectively. On recursive partitioning analysis, PNI predicted for worse FFM and CSS in patients with GS 8-10, with FFM of 67% vs. 89% (p <0.02), and CSS of 69% vs. 91%, (p <0.04) at 7 years for those with and without PNI, respectively.

Case report:   Hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Alcian blu-periodic acid schiff (AB-PAS) at pH 2.5 stained sections and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC), were performed on prostate gland paraffin-embedded tissue.

Basal cell proliferations exhibited a morphological continuum ranging from basal cell hyperplasia to prostatic gland carcinoma. In these prostatic lesions, positive reactivity was demonstrated for 34betaE12 and CD56. These findings indicate that the basaloid cells of basal cell hyperplasia, florid basal cell hyperplasia, atypical basal cell hyperplasia and basal cell carcinoma are derived from basal cells of the normal prostate gland suggesting a continuum in the progression of hyperplasia to benign and then malignant neoplasia. The presence of CD56 protein in the discovered lesions may be related to their neuroendocrine differentiation.

E2F3 levels are elevated in prostate tumors and E2F3 overexpression independently predicts clinical outcome. The goals of this study were to identify direct transcriptional targets of E2F3 in prostate tumor derived cells.  Methods:   Expression array studies identified the interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R) as an E2F3 target. E2F3-dependent expression of IL-6R was analyzed by real time PCR and Western immunoblot analysis in several cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and IL-6R-luciferase reporter plasmid studies were used to characterize the IL-6R promoter.  Results:   Expression array studies identified genes that were regulated by E2F3 in prostate tumor derived cell lines. The network most significantly associated with E2F3-regulated transcripts was cytokine signaling and the IL-6R was a component of several of the most prominent E2F3-regulated pathways. The transcriptional regulation of IL-6R by E2F3 knockdown was validated in several prostate tumor-derived cell lines at the RNA level and protein level. The IL-6R regulatory region containing ChIP-identified E2F3 binding sites was cloned into a reporter and co-transfected with an E2F3a expression plasmid. The luciferase assay showed that E2F3a transactivated the IL-6R promoter in a dose dependent manner. The functional consequence of IL-6R decrease was a reduction in the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that IL-6R initiated signaling was altered.

The present study aims to examine the chemopreventive effects and the molecular mechanism of I3C, particularly the anti-oxidative stress pathway regulated by nuclear erythroid related factor 2 (Nrf2). HepG2-C8-ARE-luciferase cells were used for Nrf2-ARE activity. TRAMP C1 cells were used to investigate the effects of I3C on Nrf2-mediated genes. To test the chemopreventive efficacy of I3C, transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice were fed with 1% I3C supplemented diet for 12 or 16 wk. The expression of Nrf2 and its downstream target genes, cell cycle and apoptosis genes were investigated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The protein expressions of these biomarkers were also investigated using Western blotting. I3C induced antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Treatments of TRAMP C1 cells with I3C also resulted in the induction of Nrf2-mediated genes. I3C significantly suppressed the incidence of palpable tumor and reduced the genitourinary weight in TRAMP mice. Western blots and qPCR analyses of prostate tissues showed that I3C induced the expression of Nrf2, NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) as well as cell cycle and apoptosis related biomarkers in I3C-fed TRAMP mice.

The objective of this study was to determine whether tumor stage differed between whites and blacks with breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers, which have effective screening regimens, based on data from the DoD Automated Cancer Tumor Registry from 1990 to 2003.  Methods:   Distributions of tumor stage (localized vs nonlocalized) between whites and blacks in the military were compared stratified by sex, active duty status, and age at diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to further adjust for age, marital status, year of diagnosis, geographic region, military service branch, and tumor grade. Distributions of tumor stage were then compared between the military and general populations.  Results:   Racial differences in the distribution of stage were significant only among nonactive duty beneficiaries. After adjusting for covariates, earlier stages of breast cancer after age 49 years and prostate cancer after age 64 years were significantly more common among white than black nonactive duty beneficiaries (P < .05), although the absolute difference was minimal for prostate cancer. Racial differences in stage for cervical and colorectal cancers were not significant after adjustment. Compared with the general population, racial differences in the military were similar or were slightly attenuated.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of ADAM17 on the proliferation and on the cell cycle distribution of human prostate cancer cells. Experiments were also performed to gain insights into the possible mechanism of action of ADAM17. We used over-expression and RNAi strategy to investigate the function of ADAM17 in human prostate cancer cells. Changes in rate of proliferation and cell cycle profile were measured by growth curve, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay and cell cycle analysis. In addition, changes in expression of associated genes and proteins were studied by semiquantitative RT-PCR, western blotting and ELISA analysis. Ectopic over-expression of ADAM17 resulted in increased cell proliferation. We also showed that ADAM17 promoted G1 to S phase transition concomitantly with upregulation of cyclin E, CDK2 and downregulation of p21 and p27 proteins. ADAM17 over-expression cells showed that more TGF-α released to the supernatant and activated the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway. Conversely, silencing ADAM17 led to the opposite effect. Both siRNAs knockdown of ADAM17 and blocking the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway using specific inhibitor caused downregulation of cyclin E, CDK2, and upregulation of p21 and p27 in prostate cancer cells.

Endogenous osteocalcin mRNA was expressed and further enhanced by vitamin D(3) in all osteosarcoma and prostate cancer cell lines and human osteoblasts, but not in human fibroblasts. The osteocalcin promoter activity was weak even with vitamin D(3) treatment in these osteocalcin-expressing cancers, leading to low E1BΔ55K expression after Surv.m-CRA-OCp infection. Nevertheless, Surv.m-CRA-OCp had significantly increased cancer specificity without reduced anticancer effects in both in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Correlation with radical prostatectomy findings""","""Currently, there is no consensus as to the optimal method for measuring tumor length or percentage of cancer on a core when there are 2 or more foci of prostate cancer in a single core separated by benign intervening stroma. One option is to measure discontinuous foci of cancer as if they were 1 single continuous focus. The other option is to add the measurements of the individual separate foci of cancer, ignoring the extent of the intervening benign prostate tissue. The surgical pathology database at The Johns Hopkins Hospital was searched for outside consult cases of prostate needle biopsies reviewed between 2005 and 2010 when the patient came to our institution for radical prostatectomy (RP). Cases were restricted to those with biopsy Gleason score 6 in which there was at least 15% discordance between the outside and our institution in terms of the reported highest percentage of cancer per core per case. One hundred and nine patients were identified fulfiling our inclusion criteria. Seventy-nine showed the same Gleason score in the RP, and 30 had an upgrade to Gleason ≥7. Including all cases (scores 6, 7, and 8 at RP), there was no significant association between the maximum percentage of cancer per core with organ-confined disease or risk of positive surgical margins, regardless if the cores were measured at Hopkins or at the outside institutions. For cases with no upgrade at RP, the differences between the maximum percentage of cancer per core per case recorded at Hopkins and the outside institutions ranged from 15% to 80%, in which the mean and median differences were 35% and 30%, respectively. The maximum percentages of tumor involvement on a core per case given at our institution more strongly correlated with the presence of organ-confined disease (P=0.004) compared with the percentages given at the outside institutions (P=0.027). Surgical margin positivity was also associated with the maximum percentages of tumor involvement per core given at our institution (P=0.004), whereas the outside percentages were not significant predictors of margin status (P=0.2). In a multivariable analysis, maximum percentage of cancer per core per case measured at Hopkins which includes intervening benign prostate tissue in the measurement was also more predictive of stage and margins than ignoring intervening benign tissue. In summary, our study demonstrated that for prostate cancer in which the needle biopsy grade is representative of the entire tumor, quantifying cancer extent on biopsy by measuring discontinuous cancer on biopsy from one end to the other as opposed to ""collapsing"" the cancer by subtracting out the intervening benign prostate tissue correlates better with organ-confined disease and risk of positive margins.""","""['Sarah Karram', 'Bruce J Trock', 'George J Netto', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Re: should intervening benign tissue be included in the measurement of discontinuous foci of cancer on prostate needle biopsy?

PEC proliferation (Ki-67 staining) and apoptosis (TUNEL method) were determined in the anterior prostate (AP). In study 1, wild-type (WT) and TgAPT(121) mice (a model of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia) were fed diets with 25, 200 (reference diet), or 10,000 IU VD/kg diet (as vitamin D(3)) prior to castration/repletion. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels were 26, 78, and 237 nmol/L in the three diet groups, respectively.

Low VD diet increased proliferation in WT (+82%) and TgAPT(121) (+24%) mice while it suppressed apoptosis in WT (-29%) and TgAPT(121) (-37%) mice. This diet also increased the severity of prostate intraepithelial neoplastic lesions in the AP of intact TgAPT(121) mice.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary folate manipulation, possibly being of primary importance for prostate epithelial cell metabolism, could significantly affect prostate cancer progression. Strikingly, mild dietary folate depletion arrested prostate cancer progression in 25 of 26 transgenic adenoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice, in which tumorigenesis is prostate-specific and characteristically aggressive. The significant effect on prostate cancer growth was characterized by size, grade, proliferation, and apoptosis analyses. Folate supplementation had a mild, nonsignificant, beneficial effect on grade. In addition, characterization of folate pools (correlated with serum), metabolite pools (polyamines and nucleotides), genetic and epigenetic damage, and expression of key biosynthetic enzymes in prostate tissue revealed interesting correlations with tumor progression.

Low-level radiation can cause these diseases and the difference of cancer rates gives rise to renewed evaluation of current risk estimates. Risk factors for radiation-induced childhood leukaemia and breast cancer are derived from the literature, considering a higher relative biological effectiveness of diagnostic X rays in comparison to the A-bomb gamma rays in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The prostate is not considered as radiation sensitive by the ICRP. But following a variety of low-level findings in the last two decades it was shown by Myles et al. in the UK that prostatic cancer is inducible by diagnostic X-ray procedures. From their study in men below the age of 60, a doubling dose of about 20 mSv can be estimated. Medical exposures of the considered tissues are taken from published data for East and West Germany.

Material of study:   Two patients referred to us for a swelling in his left preauricolar region with a moderate pain. They underwent a radiologic and bioptic examinations that showed a metastasis which could arise from a primary prostatic and renal adenocarcinoma. The patients underwent surgical treatment (Subtotal-emimandibulectomy and reconstruction with metallic endoprosthesis).  Results:   The final follow up for the first patient was acceptable and without any motor or sensory deficit. The patient also underwent chemotherapy for his primary tumour and radiotherapy of his mandibular condyle metastasis during the preoperative stage.

The patient had a chemotherapy treatment with the administration of bisphosphonates for the presence of skeletal metastases.  Discussion and conclusion:   Just 1% of carcinomas metastasizes in jaw bones. The low rate is linked to the low active bone marrow content in jaw bones of adult patients. For the prostatic and breast adenocarcinomas the neoplastic embolis reaches the skeleton directly, passing through the vertebral venous system (Batson's hypothesis).

Methods:   Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT was performed on 14 patients with untreated localized primary prostate cancer 3 h post-injection of approximately 390 MBq of 18F-FAZA using forced diuresis to decrease radioactivity in the urinary bladder. Anatomical trans-pelvic coil and pre- and post-contrast 1.5 T MRI with endorectal coil were performed on the same day. Patients underwent radical prostatectomy and ex vivo 3 T MRI of the prostatectomy specimen within 14 days following in vivo imaging. Imaging results were verified by whole mount histopathology plus tissue microarray (TMA) immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Registration of in vivo imaging with histology was achieved using mutual information software and performing ex vivo MRI of the prostatectomy specimen and whole mount sectioning with block face photography as intermediate steps.  Results:   Whole mount histology identified 43 tumor nodules, 19 of them larger than 1 ml as determined on coregistered volumes featuring 18F-FAZA, MRI, and histological 3-D image information. None of these lesions was found to be positive for CAIX or visualized by 18F-FAZA PET/CT while IHC for HIF-1α showed variable staining of tumor tissues. Accordingly, no correlation was found between 18F-FAZA uptake and Gleason scores.

Once a tumor is established it may attain further characteristics via mutations or hypoxia, which stimulate new blood vessels. Angiogenesis is a hallmark in the pathogenesis of cancer and inflammatory diseases that may predispose to cancer. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) counteracts oxidative and inflammatory damage and was previously reported to play a key role in prostate carcinogenesis. To gain insight into the anti-tumoral properties of HO-1, we investigated its capability to modulate PCa associated-angiogenesis. In the present study, we identified in PC3 cells a set of inflammatory and pro-angiogenic genes down-regulated in response to HO-1 overexpression, in particular VEGFA, VEGFC, HIF1α and α5β1 integrin. Our results indicated that HO-1 counteracts oxidative imbalance reducing ROS levels. An in vivo angiogenic assay showed that intradermal inoculation of PC3 cells stable transfected with HO-1 (PC3HO-1) generated tumours less vascularised than controls, with decreased microvessel density and reduced CD34 and MMP9 positive staining. Interestingly, longer term grown PC3HO-1 xenografts displayed reduced neovascularization with the subsequent down-regulation of VEGFR2 expression. Additionally, HO-1 repressed nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-mediated transcription from an NF-κB responsive luciferase reporter construct, which strongly suggests that HO-1 may regulate angiogenesis through this pathway.

Conflicting evidence has been published about T levels and development of PCa.  Aim:   (1) To determine the relationship between hormone levels and the diagnosis of PCa. (2) To specifically focus on the relationship between PCa and T in men classified as biochemically hypogonadal.  Materials and methods:   Prospective analysis of 1,000 transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies (5 + 5 cores biopsies) between September 2007 and January 2010 in one center. Indication for prostate biopsy was suspicion of PCa on the basis of elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or digital rectal examination (DRE). Serum testosterone and sex hormones binding globulin (SHBG) were determined in these patients. Of 557 men, the data were sufficient for further analysis. Age, body mass index (BMI), smoking/drinking habits, PSA, free PSA, PSA density, prostate volume, number of previous biopsies, DRE, and hormone levels were prospectively recorded.  Results:   No relationship was found between T and PCa (449 ± 167 ng/dL in PCa versus 437 ± 169 ng/dL in non-PCa). SHBG was significantly higher in patients with PCa (51 ± 27 ng/dL in PCa vs. 44 ± 18 ng/dL in non-PCa). In hypogonadal men, T levels correlated with the PCa (235 ± 95 ng/dL in men with PCa versus 270 ± 58 ng/dL in men without PCa, P = 0.004).  Conclusions:   T levels were comparable in men with and without PCa, but SHBG levels were significantly higher in men with PCa.

Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer among males, accompanied with increased castration levels and β2AR activation in patients. However, the role of β2AR activation in prostate cancer cells and its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we found that β2AR activation promoted cell proliferation and cell migration through increasing cellular adenylyl cyclase (cAMP) levels and ERK1/2 activation in LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Moreover, the scaffold protein β-arrestin2 was found to be involved in the β2AR-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and cell proliferation using stable overexpressing β-arrestin2 LNCaP (LNCaP-βArr2) cells. Furthermore, enhanced β-arrestin2/c-Src complex formation by β2AR activation was observed in LNCaP-βArr2 cells. In addition, the c-Src inhibitor could block this enhanced complex formation and suppressed cell proliferation.

In addition, the ETS family of transcription factors which is involved in translocations frequently found in prostate cancer is reported to be essential for the regulation of immunity-related genes. In order to identify immunity-related genes in prostate cancer, we performed two microarrays using RNA extracted from laser microdissected glands of the normal prostate proper (or the peripheral zone) and moderately and poorly differentiated prostate carcinomas from patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy. Many differentially expressed genes were found, however, only immunity-related genes (B cell, innate, and T cell immunity) with an expression of more than 10-fold increase or decrease and a P<0.01 between the moderately differentiated tumors and the normal glands, and the poorly differentiated tumors and the normal glands were considered significant. Based on these two microarrays, we identified a set of 37 genes that were up- or down-regulated in tumors (moderately and poorly differentiated) compared to the normal glands. Analysis of these genes revealed, strikingly, that 31/37 of these genes have potential binding sites within their promoter regions for members of the ETS family of transcription factors, and some are reported to be targets of ETS members. These findings identified immunity-related genes in prostate cancer, and provided insights into their potential regulation, which may lead to a better early detection, immunotherapy, and therapeutic drug treatment of this disease.

Cellular fractionation experiments indicated that mitochondria are the major intracellular sink for 11β; flow cytometry studies showed that 11β exposure rapidly induced oxidative stress, mitochondria being an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, 11β inhibited oxygen consumption both in intact HeLa cells and in isolated mitochondria. Specifically, 11β blocked uncoupled oxygen consumption when mitochondria were incubated with complex I substrates, but it had no effect on oxygen consumption driven by substrates acting downstream of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Moreover, 11β enhanced ROS generation in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that complex I inhibition is responsible for ROS production. At the cellular level, the presence of antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine or vitamin E) significantly reduced the toxicity of 11β, implicating ROS production as an important contributor to cytotoxicity. Collectively, our findings establish complex I inhibition and ROS generation as a new mechanism of action for 11β, which supplements conventional DNA adduct formation to promote cancer cell death.""","""['Bogdan I Fedeles', 'Angela Y Zhu', 'Kellie S Young', 'Shawn M Hillier', 'Kyle D Proffitt', 'John M Essigmann', 'Robert G Croy']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Respiration in adipocytes is inhibited by reactive oxygen species.', 'Forty percent methionine restriction decreases mitochondrial oxygen radical production and leak at complex I during forward electron flow and lowers oxidative damage to proteins and mitochondrial DNA in rat kidney and brain mitochondria.', 'Isoflurane differentially modulates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production via forward versus reverse electron transport flow: implications for preconditioning.', 'Increased Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species Mediates the Anti-Cancer Effects of WZ35 via Activating Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Production of reactive oxygen species in brain mitochondria: contribution by electron transport chain and non-electron transport chain sources.', 'Proteomics analysis of chronic skin injuries caused by mustard gas.', 'The cytotoxicity of benzaldehyde nitrogen mustard-2-pyridine carboxylic acid hydrazone being involved in topoisomerase IIα inhibition.', 'Cardiopulmonary exercise test findings in symptomatic mustard gas exposed cases with normal HRCT.', 'Targeting cancer cell mitochondria as a therapeutic approach.']"""

Patients and methods:   After initially performing >50 cases of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALRP), between December 2009 and April 2010, we performed 12 RALRC procedures with BELND. Bilateral (n=10) and unilateral (n=1) intrafascial NVB preservation was performed in 11 patients; nonnerve-sparing RALRC was performed in 1 patient.  Results:   Patient characteristics and surgical and postoperative parameters were mean patient age (y): 60 (43-80); American Society of Anesthesiologists score: 2 (1-3); body mass index (kg/m(2)): 24.5 (19.3-31.2); preoperative International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score: 25 (5-65); operative time (h): 10 (8.1-11.5); intraoperative blood loss (mL): 455 (100-700); lymph node (LN) yield: 21.3 (8-38); hospital stay (d): 10.7 (9-16); lodge drain removal (d): 10 (9-15). Five patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Surgical margins were negative in all patients. Postoperative pathologic stages were: pT(0) (n=2), pT(1) (n=1), pT(2a) (n=2), pT(2b) (n=2), pT(3a) (n=4), and pT(4a) (n=1). Positive LNs and incidental prostate cancer were detected in five and three patients, respectively. Perioperative death rate was zero. Right external iliac vein injury occurred in one patient during the performance of BELND; surgery was converted to an open procedure and the injury was repaired. Colonic fistula developed in one patient at postoperative day 40; the patient died from cardiac disease at day 60. At a mean follow-up of 7.1 ± 2.3 months, three patients died from metastatic disease. Of the available seven patients, six were fully continent and one had mild daytime incontinence.

However, few studies have addressed the role of cell-free plasma DNA methylation in discriminating aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) from indolent cases. We conducted a case series and a case-control study among histologically confirmed stage II/III cases and matched controls recruited at Columbia University Medical Center. The aim of this study was to investigate whether plasma DNA methylation levels are appropriate surrogate biomarker of PCa tumor tissue levels and whether these markers are associated with worse clinicopathological tumor characteristics, which correlate with poorer prognosis. Quantitative pyrosequencing was used to detect methylation levels of p16 (CDKN4A), APC, GSTP1, and LINE-1 in 24 pairs of prostate tumor and adjacent tissues, as well as 27 plasma samples of PCa patients and 24 of controls. DNA methylation levels were significantly higher in tumor tissue than in adjacent nontumor tissue for p16 (CDKN4A), GSTP1, and APC; GSTP1 had a higher average percentage methylation in tumor tissue (38.9%) compared with p16 (CDKN4A) (5.9%) and APC (14.5%). GSTP1, p16 (CDKN4A), and APC methylation in tumor tissue was statistically significantly higher for cases with Gleason score ≥7 compared with those with Gleason score <7 [49.0% vs. 21.9% (p=0.01), 6.6% vs. 4.5% (p=0.04), and 19.1% vs. 7.4% (p=0.02), respectively]. Plasma LINE-1 methylation levels were higher in those with higher Gleason (67.6%) than in those with Gleason's below 7 (64.6%, p=0.03). Significant plasma-tissue correlations were observed for GSTP1 and LINE-1 methylation. These data, although preliminary, suggest that aberrant methylation may be a useful marker to identify PCa patients with clinically aggressive disease.""","""['Lissette Delgado-Cruzata', 'Gregory W Hruby', 'Karina Gonzalez', 'James McKiernan', 'Mitchel C Benson', 'Regina M Santella', 'Jing Shen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""DNA Cell Biol""","""['Correlation between the expression of DNMT1, and GSTP1 and APC, and the methylation status of GSTP1 and APC in association with their clinical significance in prostate cancer.', 'Methylation of APC and GSTP1 in non-neoplastic tissue adjacent to prostate tumour and mortality from prostate cancer.', 'Combined hypermethylation of APC and GSTP1 as a molecular marker for prostate cancer: quantitative pyrosequencing analysis.', 'GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation for DNA-based detection of occult tumor cells in surgical margins after radical prostatectomy.', 'GSTP1 methylation in cancer: a liquid biopsy biomarker?', 'DNA-methylation and genomic copy number in primary tumors and corresponding lymph node metastases in prostate cancer from patients with low and high Gleason score.', 'Glutathione-S-Transferase p1 Gene Promoter Methylation in Cell-Free DNA as a Diagnostic and Prognostic Tool for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Epigenetics in prostate cancer: clinical implications.', 'Elucidation of the Genomic-Epigenomic Interaction Landscape of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic Analysis of Circulating Tumor DNA in Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Clinical Biomarker Potential.']"""

Methods:   Guided by conceptual model, we conducted semistructured interviews of 21 American (14 black and 7 white) men with recently diagnosed localized prostate cancer.  Results:   Physician recommendation was very important in the treatment decision, but patient self-perception/values and attitudes/beliefs about prostate cancer were also influential. Patients who chose surgery believed it offered the best chance of cure and were more concerned that the cancer might spread if not surgically removed. Patients who chose radiation therapy believed it offered equal efficacy of cure but fewer side effects than surgery. Fear of future consequences was the most common reason to reject watchful waiting. Anecdotal experiences of family and friends were also important, especially in deciding ""what not to do."" The new technology of robotic-assisted prostatectomy provided optimism for men who wanted surgery but feared morbidity associated with traditional open surgery. Few men seemed aware that treatment did not guarantee improved survival.  Conclusion:   Most men reported making ""the best choice for me"" by taking into account medical information and personal factors. Perceptions of treatment efficacy and side effects, which derived mainly from physicians' descriptions and/or anecdotal experiences of family and friends, were the most influential factors in men's treatment decision.

This study is designed to investigate molecular mechanism and apoptotic pathway of A3 adenosine receptor in DU-145, PC3 and LNcap-FGC10 human prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The expression level of A3 adenosine receptor was examined using real-time RT-PCR. cAMP concentration was also measured. MTT viability, cell counting and BrdU incorporation tests were used to study the cell proliferation effect of IB-MECA. Cell cycle analysis, Annexin V-FITC staining, Hoechst 33258 staining, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨM), caspase-3 activity, Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression were used to detect apoptosis.  Result:   A3 adenosine receptors mRNAs were detected at different levels. IB-MECA inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP. IB-MECA at (1 μM) suppressed cell proliferation and induced G1 cell cycle arrest. Indeed, IB-MECA down-regulated the expression of CDK4, cyclin D1 and up-regulated p53 expression. IB-MECA at (10-100 μM) induced apoptosis. The activity of caspase-3 was also increased. Expression of Bcl-2 was decreased in response to IB-MECA, while the expression of Bax protein was increased. The results showed a significant loss of ΔΨM, in a dose-dependent manner.  Conclusion:   This study introduces a possible mechanism through A3 adenosine receptor activation. IB-MECA inhibited prostate cancer cells proliferation and induced G1 cell cycle arrest through p53, Cdk4/cyclinD1 pathway. Apoptosis determined by characteristic morphological changes and increased in sub-G1 population.

In (early) prostate cancer (PCa) androgens also regulate tumor growth, which is exploited by hormonal therapies in metastatic disease. The aim of the present study was to characterize the androgen receptor (AR) response in hormonal therapy-resistant PC346 cells and identify potential disease markers.  Methodology/principal findings:   Human 19K oligoarrays were used to establish the androgen-regulated expression profile of androgen-responsive PC346C cells and its derivative therapy-resistant sublines: PC346DCC (vestigial AR levels), PC346Flu1 (AR overexpression) and PC346Flu2 (T877A AR mutation). In total, 107 transcripts were differentially-expressed in PC346C and derivatives after R1881 or hydroxyflutamide stimulations. The AR-regulated expression profiles reflected the AR modifications of respective therapy-resistant sublines: AR overexpression resulted in stronger and broader transcriptional response to R1881 stimulation, AR down-regulation correlated with deficient response of AR-target genes and the T877A mutation resulted in transcriptional response to both R1881 and hydroxyflutamide. This AR-target signature was linked to multiple publicly available cell line and tumor derived PCa databases, revealing that distinct functional clusters were differentially modulated during PCa progression. Differentiation and secretory functions were up-regulated in primary PCa but repressed in metastasis, whereas proliferation, cytoskeletal remodeling and adhesion were overexpressed in metastasis. Finally, the androgen-regulated genes ENDOD1, MCCC2 and ACSL3 were selected as potential disease markers for RT-PCR quantification in a distinct set of human prostate specimens. ENDOD1 and ACSL3 showed down-regulation in high-grade and metastatic PCa, while MCCC2 was overexpressed in low-grade PCa.  Conclusions/significance:   AR modifications altered the transcriptional response to (anti)androgens in therapy-resistant cells. Furthermore, selective down-regulation of genes involved in differentiation and up-regulation of genes promoting proliferation and invasion suggest a disturbed balance between the growth and differentiation functions of the AR pathway during PCa progression. These findings may have implications in the current treatment and development of novel therapeutical approaches for metastatic PCa.""","""['Rute B Marques', 'Natasja F Dits', 'Sigrun Erkens-Schulze', 'Wilfred F J van Ijcken', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Guido Jenster']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Androgen receptor modifications in prostate cancer cells upon long-termandrogen ablation and antiandrogen treatment.', 'Bypass mechanisms of the androgen receptor pathway in therapy-resistant prostate cancer cell models.', 'A new prostate cancer therapeutic approach: combination of androgen ablation with COX-2 inhibitor.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Advances in androgen receptor targeted therapy for prostate cancer.', 'STEAP1 regulation and its influence modulating the response of LNCaP prostate cancer cells to bicalutamide, enzalutamide and apalutamide.', 'Alterations in the Ca2+ toolkit in oesophageal adenocarcinoma.', 'Whole-Exome Sequencing Reveals New Potential Mutations Genes for Primary Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Arising From the Kidney.', 'MCCC2 promotes HCC development by supporting leucine oncogenic function.', 'Non-Coding and Regulatory RNAs as Epigenetic Remodelers of Fatty Acid Homeostasis in Cancer.']"""

The integrative analysis of networks typically combines networks from different studies that investigate the same or similar research questions. In order to perform an integrative analysis it is often necessary to compare the properties of matching edges across the data set. This identification of common edges is often burdensome and computational intensive. Here, we present an approach that is different from inferring a new network based on common features. Instead, we select one network as a graph prototype, which then represents a set of comparable network objects, as it has the least average distance to all other networks in the same set. We demonstrate the usefulness of the graph prototyping approach on a set of prostate cancer networks and a set of corresponding benign networks.

However, whether this salicylic acid could block angiogenesis has not been elucidated to date. Here, we postulate that anacardic acid affects multiple steps of tumor angiogenesis to contribute to tumor inhibition. In this study, we found that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion and capillary-like structure formation of primary cultured human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) could all be significantly suppressed by anacardic acid in vitro, without detectable cellular toxicity. Furthermore, anacardic acid effectively inhibited vascular development in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane ex vivo (n = 10) and VEGF-triggered corneal neovascularization in vivo (n = 10). A mechanistic study revealed that anacardic acid blocked activities of Src and FAK kinases in concentration- and time-dependent manners in HUVECs, resulting in activation of RhoA-GTPase and inactivation of Rac1- and Cdc42-GTPases. Of note, when anacardic acid (2 mg/kg per day) was subcutaneously administrated to mice bearing human prostate tumor xenografts (n = 6-7), the volume and weight of solid tumors were significantly retarded. Src, Ki-67, and CD31 immunohistochemical staining further revealed that Src protein expression, tumor cell proliferation, and microvessel density could be remarkably suppressed by anacardic acid.

Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study, including 532 lung cancer cases, 582 matched controls, and 150 additional controls with chest X-ray (CXR) evidence of pulmonary scarring, in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.

These sequences are mostly silenced in normal cells, but genome-wide DNA hypomethylation in cancers might lead to their re-expression. Whether this re-expression really occurs in human cancers is largely unkown. We therefore investigated expression and DNA methylation of several classes of retroelements in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing, respectively. The most striking finding was strong and generalized increased expression of the HERV-K_22q11.23 provirus in cancers, including de novo expression of a spliced accessory Np9 transcript in some tumors. In parallel, DNA methylation in the long terminal repeat (LTR) decreased. Conversely, HERVK17 expression was significantly diminished in cancer tissues, but this decrease was unrelated to LTR methylation. Expression of both proviruses was restricted to androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines and LTRs sequences containing steroid hormone-responsive elements bound the androgen receptor and conferred androgen responsiveness to reporter constructs. Expression of LINE-1 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and 3'-UTR sequences in prostate cancers rather decreased, despite significant hypomethylation of the internal LINE-1 promoter. Increased expression of the young AluYa5 and AluYb8 families was restricted to individual tumors. Our findings demonstrate a surprising specificity of changes in expression and DNA methylation of retroelements in prostate cancer. In particular, LINE-1 hypomethylation does not lead to generalized overexpression, but specific human endogenous retrovirus-K proviruses display conspicuous changes in their expression hinting at significant functions during prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Wolfgang Goering', 'Teodora Ribarska', 'Wolfgang A Schulz']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['DNA methylation and expression of LINE-1 and HERV-K provirus sequences in urothelial and renal cell carcinomas.', 'CpG methylation directly regulates transcriptional activity of the human endogenous retrovirus family HERV-K(HML-2).', 'Methylation of the androgen receptor minimal promoter silences transcription in human prostate cancer.', 'The role of human endogenous retroviral long terminal repeat sequences in human cancer (Review).', 'Molecular biology of type A endogenous retrovirus.', 'Long-range gene regulation in hormone-dependent cancer.', 'Expression of Envelope Protein Encoded by Endogenous Retrovirus K102 in Rheumatoid Arthritis Neutrophils.', 'Anti-HERV-K Drugs and Vaccines, Possible Therapies against Tumors.', 'HERVs and Cancer-A Comprehensive Review of the Relationship of Human Endogenous Retroviruses and Human Cancers.', 'Expression of Human Endogenous Retrovirus Group K (HERV-K) HML-2 Correlates with Immune Activation of Macrophages and Type I Interferon Response.']"""

Fn14 and its ligand TWEAK were highly expressed in two AIPC cell lines, DU 145 and PC-3, whereas expression was weak in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Fn14 knockdown using small-interfering RNAs attenuated migration, invasion and proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in the AIPC cell lines. Both forced overexpression of Fn14 by stable Fn14 complementary DNA transfection to PC-3 cells (PC-3/Fn14) and ligand activation by recombinant TWEAK in PC-3 cells enhanced invasion. Fn14 was shown to modulate expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and MMP-9 mediated the invasive potential influenced by Fn14 in PC-3 cells. In vivo, subcutaneous xenografts of PC-3/Fn14 grew significantly faster than xenograft of PC-3/Mock, and the invasive capacity in PC-3/Fn14 was found to be higher than that of PC-3/Mock as evaluated in an invasion model of the diaphragm. Furthermore, the messenger RNA expressions of MMP-9 in PC-3/Fn14 xenografts were significantly higher than those in PC-3/Mock xenografts. Clinically, high expression of Fn14 was significantly associated with higher prostate-specific antigen recurrence rate in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.

Material and methods:   Files from 70 consecutive patients who undergone radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for organ-confined PCa were retrospectively evaluated. During each intervention, after prostate removal, biopsies of the surgical bed were obtained from the following sites: urethral/periapical section margin, basal, left and right postero-lateral and under/retrotrigonal regions. No patient was been previously treated with either radiation or hormone therapy. We evaluated the relationship between the presence of either benign or malignant prostatic cells at surgical bed biopsies and the following parameters: postoperative serum PSA levels, definitive Gleason score, tumour staging, margin status.  Results:   In all cases pathological stage was pT2NOMO, an immediate postoperative PSA zeroing occurred and surgical margins were negative. Surgical bed biopsies after prostate removal were positive for malignant cells in 5/70 cases (7.1%) and for benign prostatic cells in 16/70 patients (22.9%). Overall a biochemical disease progression was observed in 13/70 cases (18.6%): 1 case with surgical bed biopsies positive for cancer; 3 cases with biopsies positive for benign prostatic tissue; 9 patients with biopsies negative for prostatic tissue residuals. In this latter group 2 cases of disease progression were observed. Stratifying patients according to biopsy features, we did not find any significant difference between groups concerning preoperative PSA (p = 0.319), prostate weight (p = 0.158), pathological staging (p = 0.371), Gleason score (p = 0.457), follow-up (p = 0.144), biochemical progression rates (p = 0.553). At logistic regression model the only statistically significant association was between disease progression and preoperative PSA (p = 0.026). Stratifying patients with no malignant biopsies in two subgroups (presence and absence of residual benign prostate tissue) no statistically significant differences were detected in terms of disease relapse (p = 0.158).  Conclusions:   In patients with pathologically organ-confined PCa, minimal neoplastic tissue residuals might not significantly affect medium-long-term prognosis: 80% of patients with positive biopsy showed undetectable serum PSA levels after a median follow-up over 5 years.

Suppression of relaxin or relaxin receptor RXFP1 expression inhibited prostate cancer both in vitro and in vivo. RXFP1 is a G protein-coupled receptor with the extracellular low density lipoprotein A (LDL-A) module located at the N-terminus. The LDL-A module exhibits a competitive inhibition effect on the RXFP1 function and might be used to suppress relaxin signaling. In this study, we investigated the effect of LDL-A overexpression on prostate cancer cells. PC3 cells expressing the RXFP1-LDL-A module had a decreased proliferation, soft agar colony formation, adhesion, invasion in vitro, and grew at a slower rate than control cells as tumors in xenograft models in mice. Expression analysis revealed that the RXFP1-LDL-A expression in PC3 cells inhibited Akt phosphorylation and MMP2 activation, and led to the down-regulation of several genes previously implicated in tumorigenesis, such as MMP28, S100P, IGFBP2, MUC1 and S100A4.

SIRT1 and SIRT2 deacetylate FOXO factors to regulate FOXO function. Because acetylation and ubiquitination both modify the ɛ-amino group of lysine residues, we investigated whether FOXO3 deacetylation by SIRT1 or SIRT2 facilitates FOXO3 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. We found that SIRT1 and SIRT2 promote FOXO3 poly-ubiquitination and degradation. Proteasome-inhibitor treatment prevented sirtuin-induced FOXO3 degradation, indicating that this process is proteasome dependent. In addition, we demonstrated that E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit Skp2 binds preferentially to deacetylated FOXO3. Overexpression of Skp2 caused poly-ubiquitination of FOXO3 and degradation, whereas knockdown of Skp2 increased the amount of FOXO3 protein. We also present evidence that SCF-Skp2 ubiquitinates FOXO3 directly in vitro. Furthermore, mutating four known acetylated lysine residues (K242, K259, K290 and K569) of FOXO3 into arginines to mimic deacetylated FOXO3 resulted in enhanced Skp2 binding but with inhibition of FOXO3 ubiquitination; this suggests that some or all of these four lysine residues are likely the sites for ubiquitination. In the livers of mice deficient in SIRT1, we detected increased expression of FOXO3, indicating SIRT1 regulates FOXO3 protein levels in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the elevation of SIRT1 and Skp2 expression in malignant PC3 and DU145 prostate cells is responsible for the downregulation of FOXO3 protein levels in these cells. Taken together, our data support the notion that deacetylation of FOXO3 by SIRT1 or SIRT2 facilitates Skp2-mediated FOXO3 poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.""","""['F Wang', 'C-H Chan', 'K Chen', 'X Guan', 'H-K Lin', 'Q Tong']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['SIRT2 inhibits non-small cell lung cancer cell growth through impairing Skp2-mediated p27 degradation.', 'Posttranslational modifications control FoxO3 activity during denervation.', 'Lipopolysaccharide modulates p300 and Sirt1 to promote PRMT1 stability via an SCFFbxl17-recognized acetyldegron.', 'Regulation of FOXO protein stability via ubiquitination and proteasome degradation.', 'Skp2 in the ubiquitin-proteasome system: A comprehensive review.', 'Evaluating the iron chelator function of sirtinol in non-small cell lung cancer.', ""SNORD17-mediated KAT6B mRNA 2'-O-methylation regulates vasculogenic mimicry in glioblastoma cells."", 'AIM2 promotes renal cell carcinoma progression and sunitinib resistance through FOXO3a-ACSL4 axis-regulated ferroptosis.', 'SIRT2-PFKP interaction dysregulates phagocytosis in macrophages with acute ethanol-exposure.', 'Sirt3 restricts tumor initiation via promoting LONP1 deacetylation and K63 ubiquitination.']"""

The strength of this relationship may be subject to the choice of deprivation index used.  Methods:   A range of possibilities for measuring area-based deprivation in Northern Ireland are investigated. The relationship between each measure and cancer incidence is described using standardised incidence ratios and age-standardised rates fitted with a log-linear model.  Results:   Standardised incidence ratios for lung cancer comparing the most to the least deprived deciles were greater using an income measure (371.1, 95%CI: 355.4-386.9) than an employment measure (321.1; 95%CI: 307.9-334.2). Income, employment and education measures gave similar results for breast, prostate and colorectal cancers. Standardised incidence ratios generated for all cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin) using income deciles based upon census output areas (142.4; 95%CI: 139.6-145.1) were larger than those generated using super output areas (133.0; 95%CI: 130.3-135.7) or electoral wards (130.4; 95%CI: 127.8-133.1).

We followed participants until the date of PCa, the date of death, or the last follow-up at December 31, 2008, or up to a maximum of 12 yr after initial screening. Potentially life-threatening (advanced) cancer was defined as cancer with at least one of following characteristics: clinical stage ≥T3a, M1, or N1; serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >20.0 ng/ml; or Gleason score ≥8 at biopsy.  Intervention:   We compared the proportional total (advanced) cancer incidence (screen-detected and interval cases), defined as the ratio of the observed number of (advanced) cancers to the expected numbers of (advanced) cancers based on the control arm of the study.

At multivariable analyses, only PSA >4 ng/ml (HR: 2.13; p=0.03) and the presence of retroperitoneal uptake at PET/CT scan (HR=2.92; p=0.004) represented independent preoperative predictors of CR. Similarly, the presence of pathologic nodes in the retroperitoneum (HR: 2.78; p=0.02), higher number of positive lymph nodes (HR: 1.04; p=0.006), and complete BR to salvage LND (HR: 0.31; p=0.002) represented postoperative independent predictors of CR. Main limitations consisted of the lack of a control group and the heterogeneity of patients included in the analyses.  Conclusions:   Salvage LND is feasible in patients with BCR after RP and nodal pathologic uptake at [11C]choline PET/CT scan.

However, although recent research has led to several nonviral nucleic acid delivery systems with encouraging transfection performance, there remains a substantial gap between these systems and an ideal siRNA carrier that can be safely and effectively used for the more complex delivery tasks such as cancer management. We hypothesized that by integrating the high transfection performance of linear polyethylenimine (PEI) with the controlled release properties of solid lipid components, and complementing the resulting lipid-PEI hybrid nanocarrier (LPN) with receptor-targeting capability, multiple limitations of the conventional siRNA carriers would be simultaneously overcome. Data comparing this new hybrid system with the conventional siRNA-PEI polyplexes showed 15 to 21% less loss of siRNA, higher selectivity for prostate cancer cells over noncancerous prostate cells, and significant reduction in both acute and delayed carrier toxicity especially to the noncancerous RWPE1 cells (e.g., 71.2% of LPN-treated cells preserved proliferative capacity versus ≤30.2% in other groups). We further demonstrated sustained intracellular siRNA release from LPNs, which was shown translatable into extended in vitro and in vivo RNA-interference effects for a minimum of one week. Our findings generally support the use of LPN technology to achieve a longer-acting, less toxic, more efficient, and cancer-specific form of siRNA therapy in an ""all-in-one"" manner.

Between May 2008 and July 2008, 64 patients were enrolled in the study (group 1). Following sterilization, the Odissey Tissue Oximeter probe was placed on the shaft of the penis, 2 cm from its base. The patient underwent continuous penile tissue saturation monitoring. Surgical dissection was altered whenever the oxygen saturation alarm went off until it was restored to 85%.

These patients did not have any intraoperative tissue oxygenation monitoring. Opening of the endopelvic fascia and steps of nerve sparing were associated with significant drops in oxygen levels, especially if done using torque. Drop in oxygen levels were also noted whenever excessive traction was applied on the Foley catheter, seminal vesicles or prostate during apical dissection. We deliberately modified our surgical steps to make surgery more traction free. A significantly higher percentage of group 1 patients with bilateral nerve sparing had no ED compared with group 2 patients at 6 weeks (24.5% vs 10.4%; P=0.014) and 52 weeks (83.7% vs 68%; P=0.029).

Methods and results:   We generated Escherichia coli ampicillin secretion trap (CAST) libraries from 2 PCa cell lines and normal prostate tissues. By sequencing 3,264 colonies from CAST libraries, we identified 18 candidate genes that encode transmembrane proteins present in PCa. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of these candidates revealed that STEAP1, ADAM9 and CDON were expressed much more highly in PCa than in 15 kinds of normal tissues. Among the candidates, CDON encodes the CDO protein, which is an orphan cell surface receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Additional quantitative RT-PCR revealed that 83% of PCa tissues showed CDON overexpression. Knockdown of CDON in DU145 cells induced 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion ability.

Expression of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), which has been implicated in cancer invasion and metastasis, is associated with advanced prostate cancer. We show here that MT1-MMP plays a key role in eliciting oxidative stress in prostate cancer cells. Stable MT1-MMP expression in less invasive LNCaP prostate cancer cells with low endogenous MT1-MMP increased activity of ROS, whereas MT1-MMP knockdown in DU145 cells with high endogenous MT1-MMP decreased activity of ROS. Expression of MT1-MMP increased oxidative DNA damage in LNCaP and in DU145 cells, indicating that MT1-MMP-mediated induction of ROS caused oxidative stress. MT1-MMP expression promoted a more aggressive phenotype in LNCaP cells that was dependent on elaboration of ROS. Blocking ROS activity using the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine abrogated MT1-MMP-mediated increase in cell migration and invasion. MT1-MMP-expressing LNCaP cells displayed an enhanced ability to grow in soft agar that required increased ROS. Using cells expressing MT1-MMP mutant cDNAs, we showed that ROS activation entails cell surface MT1-MMP proteolytic activity. Induction of ROS in prostate cancer cells expressing MT1-MMP required adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and was impeded by anti-β1 integrin antibodies. These results highlight a novel mechanism of malignant progression in prostate cancer cells that involves β1 integrin-mediated adhesion, in concert with MT1-MMP proteolytic activity, to elicit oxidative stress and induction of a more invasive phenotype.""","""['Hoang-Lan Nguyen', 'Stanley Zucker', 'Kevin Zarrabi', 'Pournima Kadam', 'Cathleen Schmidt', 'Jian Cao']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Shedding of RANKL by tumor-associated MT1-MMP activates Src-dependent prostate cancer cell migration.', 'Prostate cancer-associated membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase: a pivotal role in bone response and intraosseous tumor growth.', 'Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase promotes human prostate cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Integrated functions of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase in regulating cancer malignancy: Beyond a proteinase.', 'Matrix invasion by tumour cells: a focus on MT1-MMP trafficking to invadopodia.', 'Effects of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate on Matrix Metalloproteinases in Terms of Its Anticancer Activity.', 'Mitochondria preserve an autarkic one-carbon cycle to confer growth-independent cancer cell migration and metastasis.', 'The Role of the Metzincin Superfamily in Prostate Cancer Progression: A Systematic-Like Review.', 'The androgen receptor/filamin A complex as a target in prostate cancer microenvironment.', 'Metabolic Potential of Cancer Cells in Context of the Metastatic Cascade.']"""

Since the magnitude of fat gain and muscle loss is most pronounced during the early phases of androgen suppression therapy, the exercise response may differ by the duration of androgen suppression therapy. We investigated whether the exercise response varied by the prior duration of exposure to androgen suppression therapy, that is acute--less than 6 months vs later--6 months or greater.  Materials and methods:   A total of 50 men 55 to 84 years old undergoing androgen suppression therapy for nonbone metastatic prostate cancer completed a progressive resistance and cardiovascular exercise program for 12 weeks, including 16 with acute and 34 with chronic androgen suppression therapy exposure. We assessed fat and lean mass by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry as well as muscle strength, functional performance, quality of life and blood biomarkers.  Results:   Patients on acute androgen suppression showed an increase in total body fat compared to those on chronic androgen suppression (0.9 kg, p = 0.018). Each group experienced increased appendicular skeletal muscle (about 0.5 kg, p <0.01). Triglycerides decreased in the chronic group and increased in the acute group (p = 0.027).

Ginger has been known to display anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiproliferative activities, indicating its promising role as a chemopreventive agent. Here, we show that whole ginger extract (GE) exerts significant growth-inhibitory and death-inductory effects in a spectrum of prostate cancer cells. Comprehensive studies have confirmed that GE perturbed cell-cycle progression, impaired reproductive capacity, modulated cell-cycle and apoptosis regulatory molecules and induced a caspase-driven, mitochondrially mediated apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. Remarkably, daily oral feeding of 100 mg/kg body weight of GE inhibited growth and progression of PC-3 xenografts by approximately 56 % in nude mice, as shown by measurements of tumour volume. Tumour tissue from GE-treated mice showed reduced proliferation index and widespread apoptosis compared with controls, as determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical methods. Most importantly, GE did not exert any detectable toxicity in normal, rapidly dividing tissues such as gut and bone marrow.

Objective:   Although grayscale transrectal ultrasound is the standard method for prostate imaging, it lacks accuracy in the detection and localization of prostate cancer. With the introduction of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), perfusion imaging of the microvascularization became available. By this, cancer-induced neovascularisation can be visualized with the potential to improve ultrasound imaging for prostate cancer detection and localization significantly. For example, several studies have shown that CEUS-guided biopsies have the same or higher PCa detection rate compared with systematic biopsies with less biopsies needed.  Materials and methods:   This paper describes the current status of CEUS and discusses novel quantification techniques that can improve the accuracy even further. Furthermore, quantification might decrease the user-dependency, opening the door to use in the routine clinical environment. A new generation of targeted microbubbles is now under pre-clinical testing and showed avidly binding to VEGFR-2, a receptor up-regulated in prostate cancer due to angiogenesis. The first publications regarding a targeted microbubble ready for human use will be discussed.  Conclusion:   Ultrasound-assisted drug delivery gives rise to a whole new set of therapeutic options, also for prostate cancer. A major breakthrough in the future can be expected from the clinical use of targeted microbubbles for drug delivery for prostate cancer diagnosis as well as treatment.""","""['Martijn Smeenge', 'Massimo Mischi', 'M Pilar Laguna Pes', 'Jean J M C H de la Rosette', 'Hessel Wijkstra']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['The prostate cancer detection rates of CEUS-targeted versus MRI-targeted versus systematic TRUS-guided biopsies in biopsy-naïve men: a prospective, comparative clinical trial using the same patients.', 'Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with MRI image fusion for monitoring focal therapy of prostate cancer with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)1.', 'Diagnostic performance of power doppler and ultrasound contrast agents in early imaging-based diagnosis of organ-confined prostate cancer: Is it possible to spare cores with contrast-guided biopsy?', 'Contrast-enhanced versus systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate cancer detection: an overview of techniques and a systematic review.', 'Contrast specific imaging in the detection and localization of prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Modeling of an Analog to Pseudo-Diffusivity in Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Irreversible Electroporation for the Ablation of Prostate Cancer.', 'Ultrasound Molecular Imaging of VEGFR-2 in Clear-Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Tracks Disease Response to Antiangiogenic and Notch-Inhibition Therapy.', 'Focal vs extended ablation in localized prostate cancer with irreversible electroporation; a multi-center randomized controlled trial.', 'A human GRPr-transfected Ace-1 canine prostate cancer model in mice.']"""

Thus, significant emphasis has been placed on combinations of naturally occurring chemopreventive agents. Silibinin is a major bioactive flavonolignan extracted from milk thistle with chemopreventive activity in various organs including the skin, prostate, and breast. However, the mechanism underlying the inhibitory action of silibinin in breast cancer has not been completely elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effect of silibinin in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and determined whether silibinin enhances ultraviolet (UV) B-induced apoptosis.  Methods:   The effects of silibinin on MCF-7 cell viability were determined using the MTT assay. The effect of silibinin on PARP cleavage, as the hallmark of apoptotic cell death, and p53 protein expression in MCF-7 cells was analyzed using Western blot. The effect of silibinin on UVB-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.  Results:   A dose- and time-dependent reduction in viability was observed in MCF-7 cells treated with silibinin. Silibinin strongly induced apoptotic cell death in MCF-7 cells, and induction of apoptosis was associated with increased p53 expression. Moreover, silibinin enhanced UVB-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.  Conclusion:   Silibinin induced a loss of cell viability and apoptotic cell death in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the combination of silibinin and UVB resulted in an additive effect on apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that silibinin might be an important supplemental agent for treating patients with breast cancer.""","""['Eun-Mi Noh', 'Mi Suk Yi', 'Hyun Jo Youn', 'Byoung Kil Lee', 'Young-Rae Lee', 'Ji-Hey Han', 'Hong-Nu Yu', 'Jong-Suk Kim', 'Sung Hoo Jung']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Breast Cancer""","""['Synergistic anti-cancer effects of silibinin with conventional cytotoxic agents doxorubicin, cisplatin and carboplatin against human breast carcinoma MCF-7 and MDA-MB468 cells.', 'Coenzyme Q0 Enhances Ultraviolet B-Induced Apoptosis in Human Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast (MCF-7) Cancer Cells.', 'Synergistic anti-cancer effects of silibinin-etoposide combination against human breast carcinoma MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.', 'Silibinin and non-melanoma skin cancers.', 'Mechanisms and preclinical efficacy of silibinin in preventing skin cancer.', 'Effect of Silibinin on the Expression of Mir-20b, Bcl2L11, and Erbb2 in Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Recent updates on anticancer mechanisms of polyphenols.', 'Functional Role of p53 in the Regulation of Chemical-Induced Oxidative Stress.', 'Effect of Silibinin on Maspin and ERα Gene Expression in MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cell Line.', 'Adjuvant Therapy with Silibinin Improves the Efficacy of Paclitaxel and Cisplatin in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

A constitutively active version of IκB kinase 2 (IKK2), which is activated by many inflammatory stimuli, was expressed specifically in the prostate epithelium. Constitutive activation of the IKK2/nuclear factor κB axis was insufficient for prostate transformation. However, in combination with heterozygous loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog, IKK2 activation led to an increase in tumor size, formation of cribriform structures, and increase in fiber in the fibroblastic stroma. This phenotype was coupled with persistent inflammation evoked by chemokine expression in the epithelium and stroma. The hyperplastic and dysplastic epithelia correlated with changes evoked by decreased androgen receptor activation. Conversely, inflammation correlated with stromal changes highlighted by loss of smooth muscle cells around prostate ducts. Despite the loss of the smooth muscle barrier, tumors were rarely invasive in a C57BL/6 background. Data mining revealed that smooth muscle markers are also downregulated in human prostate cancers, and loss of these markers in primary tumors is associated with subsequent metastasis. In conclusion, our data show that loss of smooth muscle and invasiveness of the tumor are not coupled in our model, with inflammation leading to increased tumor size and a dedifferentiated stroma.""","""['Andreas Birbach', 'David Eisenbarth', 'Nicolas Kozakowski', 'Eva Ladenhauf', 'Marc Schmidt-Supprian', 'Johannes A Schmid']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Impact of prostate inflammation on lesion development in the POET3(+)Pten(+/-) mouse model of prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Stromal activation associated with development of prostate cancer in prostate-targeted fibroblast growth factor 8b transgenic mice.', 'Malignant transformation of human prostatic epithelium is associated with the loss of androgen receptor immunoreactivity in the surrounding stroma.', 'Pten inactivation and the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Antagonistic Functions of Androgen Receptor and NF-κB in Prostate Cancer-Experimental and Computational Analyses.', 'Elevated expression of the colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia dependent of epithelial-Gp130.', 'Absence of nuclear receptors LXRs impairs immune response to androgen deprivation and leads to prostate neoplasia.', 'STAT3-dependent analysis reveals PDK4 as independent predictor of recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'PTEN deletion drives aberrations of DNA methylome and transcriptome in different stages of prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   In this hypothesis-driven study, we genotyped 937 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 156 candidate genes in a population-based cohort of 1,309 prostate cancer patients.

Previously, we reported grilled red meat consumption associated with PhIP-DNA adduct levels in human prostate. In this study, we expanded our investigation to estimate the associations between beverage consumption and PhIP-DNA adduct levels in prostate for 391 prostate cancer cases. Of the 15 beverages analyzed, red wine consumption had the strongest association with PhIP-DNA adduct levels showing an inverse correlation in both tumor (P = 0.006) and nontumor (P = 0.002) prostate cells. Red wine consumption was significantly lower in African American compared with white cases, but PhIP-DNA adduct levels in prostate did not vary by race. In African Americans compared with whites, however, associations between red wine consumption and PhIP-DNA adduct levels were not as strong as associations with specific (e.g., SULT1A1 and UGT1A10 genotypes) and nonspecific (e.g., African ancestry) genetic variation. In a multivariable model, the covariate for red wine consumption explained a comparable percentage (13%-16%) of the variation in PhIP-DNA adduct levels in prostate across the two racial groups, but the aforementioned genetic factors explained 33% of the PhIP-DNA adduct variation in African American cases, whereas only 19% of the PhIP-DNA adduct variation in whites.

Results:   First we evaluated the change of the erectile function domain score over time before and after radiotherapy. The population of severe erectile dysfunction (ED) increased while those with no or mild ED decreased after radiotherapy. The erectile function and intercourse satisfaction domain score of the IIEF declined significantly after radiotherapy, however, the orgasmic function, sexual desire, and overall satisfaction domain scores did not change after external beam radiation. Of the 34 patients who had erectile function at baseline, 10 patients could maintain erectile function 12 months after radiotherapy. Though there were no significant differences in clinical features between patients who could maintain erectile function and those who had worsening erectile function 12 months after radiotherapy, the sexual desire domain score before radiotherapy was significantly higher in patients who could maintain erectile function than their counterparts.  Conclusion:   Using the IIEF survey, external beam radiation was found to affect erectile function in patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Eiji Kikuchi', 'Jun Nakashima', 'Toshiyuki Ando', 'Hirohiko Nagata', 'Akira Miyajima', 'Ken Nakagawa', 'Ken Marumo', 'Mototsugu Oya']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""['A prospective longitudinal survey of erectile dysfunction in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prophylactic sildenafil citrate improves select aspects of sexual function in men treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Erectile function after prostate brachytherapy.', 'The Natural History of Erectile Dysfunction After Prostatic Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Sexual dysfunction after curietherapy and external radiotherapy of the prostate for localized prostate cancer.', 'Changes in male sexuality after urologic cancer: a narrative review.']"""

Materials and methods:   Lipid peroxidation was monitored by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) level in different tissues of rats. Activities of free radical scavenging enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase) were determined using H2O2 decomposition.  Results:   Results showed that administration of H2O2 (0.1%) in drinking water of the rats, for 25 weeks, increased the malondialdehyde levels in liver, kidney and lung tissues of all the rats. However, rats receiving Podophyllum hexandrum extract and alpha-tocopherol had lower MDA levels in a dose dependent manner, which indicates decreased lipid peroxidation in these rats. Increase in the catalase activity appears to be a response to H2O2 accumulation. The decrease in the activity of catalase and increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in different organs of the rats receiving Podophyllum hexandrum extract and alpha-tocopherol indicates the protective effect of the plant in combating oxidative stress undergone by the rats.  Objectives:   Rhizome of Podophyllum hexandrum have been ethnomedically claimed to possess a wide array of biological activities including anticancer activity.  Materials and methods:   To verify the folklore claim, this study was performed in a six Human carcinoma cell lines, Lung (A-549), Prostate (PC-3), Colon (Colo-25), Breast (MCF-7), Neuroblastoma (IMR-32) and CNS (SF-295) MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.  Results:   Methanol and 70% ethanolic extracts of the rhizome of Podophyllum hexandrum showed highest cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 (Breast) and Colo-25 (Colon) cell line, as determined with sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay.  Conclusions:   These findings 1 - showed that Podophyllum hexandrum extract may ameliorate H2O2 induced oxidative stress by decreasing lipid peroxidation via alteration of the antioxidant defense system of the rats. 2 - these data also showed the anticancer activity of the plant extracts on different human cancer cell lines.

Ten patients with brain tumors who received intensity-modulated radiotherapy had dose distributions re-evaluated to assess the impact of systematic rotational setup errors. The dosimetric effect of rotational setup errors was simulated by rotating images and contours using a 3 by 3 rotational matrix. Combined rotational errors of ± 1°, ± 3°, ± 5° and ± 7° and residual translation errors of 1 mm along each axis were simulated. Dosimetric effects of the rotated images were evaluated by recomputing dose distributions and compared with the original plan. The mean volume of CTV that received the prescription dose decreased from 99.3% ± 0.5% (original) to 98.6% ± 1.6% (± 1°), 97.0% ± 2.0% (± 3°), 93.1% ± 4.6% (± 5°), and 87.8% ± 14.2% (± 7°). Minimal changes in the cold and hot spots were seen in the CTV. In general, the increase in the volumes of the organs at risk (OARs) receiving the tolerance doses was small and did not exceed the tolerance, except for cases where the OARs were in close proximity to the PTV. For intracranial tumors treated with IMRT with a CTV-to-PTV margin of 3 mm, rotational setup errors of 3° or less didn't decrease the CTV coverage to less than 95% in most cases. However, for large targets with irregular or elliptical shapes, the target coverage decreased significantly as rotational errors of 5° or more were present. Our results indicate that setup margins are warranted even in the absence of translational setup errors to account for rotational setup errors. Rotational setup errors should be evaluated carefully for clinical cases involving large tumor sizes and for targets with elliptical or irregular shape, as well as when isocenter is away from the center of the PTV or OARs are in close proximity to the target volumes.""","""['Jean L Peng', 'Chihray Liu', 'Yu Chen', 'Robert J Amdur', 'Kenneth Vanek', 'Jonathan G Li']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric influences of rotational setup errors on head and neck carcinoma intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatments.', 'Evaluation of clinical margins via simulation of patient setup errors in prostate IMRT treatment plans.', 'Evaluation of dosimetric margins in prostate IMRT treatment plans.', 'Dosimetric effects of patient rotational setup errors on prostate IMRT treatments.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Is Halcyon feasible for single thoracic or lumbar vertebral segment SBRT?', 'Region of interest optimization for radiation therapy of breast cancer.', 'Combined effect of dose gradient and rotational error on prescribed dose coverage for single isocenter multiple brain metastases in frameless stereotactic radiotherapy.', 'The effect of designing a rotational planning target volume on sparing pharyngeal constrictor muscles in patients with oropharyngeal cancer.', 'A review of Image Guided Radiation Therapy in head and neck cancer from 2009-201 - Best Practice Recommendations for RTTs in the Clinic.']"""

Ten prostate plans were created with a single 360° arc. The DICOM files for these treatment plans were then imported into an in-house computer program that introduced delivery errors. Random and systematic gantry position (0.25°, 0.5°, 1°), monitor unit (MU) (1.25%, 2.5%, 5%), and multileaf collimator (MLC) position (0.5, 1, 2 mm) errors were introduced. The MLC errors were either random or one of three types of systematic errors, where the MLC banks moved in the same (MLC gaps remain unchanged) or opposing directions (increasing or decreasing the MLC gaps). The generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) was calculated for the original plan and all treatment plans with errors introduced. The dose sensitivity for the cohort was calculated using linear regression for the gantry position, MU, and MLC position errors. Because there was a large amount of variability for systematic MLC position errors, the dose sensitivity of each plan was calculated and correlated with plan MU, mean MLC gap, and the percentage of MLC leaf gaps less than 1 and 2 cm for each individual plan. We found that random and systematic gantry position errors were relatively insignificant (< 0.1% gEUD change) for gantry errors up to 1°. Random MU errors were also insignificant, and systematic MU increases caused a systematic increase in gEUD. For MLC position errors, random MLC errors were relatively insignificant up to 2 mm as had been determined in previous IMRT studies. Systematic MLC shift errors caused a decrease of approximately -1% in the gEUD per mm. For systematic MLC gap open errors, the dose sensitivity was 8.2%/mm and for MLC gap close errors the dose sensitivity was -7.2%/mm. There was a large variability for MLC gap open/close errors for the ten RapidArc plans which correlated strongly with MU, mean gap width, and percentage of MLC gaps less than 1 or 2cm.

This study assessed mortality outcomes in a large national registry to further elucidate the association between treatment selection and cause of mortality.  Patients and methods:   A total of 7,248 men in the CaPSURE registry were analyzed. Treatment was categorized as local only, primary ADT monotherapy, local treatment plus ADT, and watchful waiting/active surveillance (WW/AS). Competing hazards survival analysis was performed for prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), CVM, and all-cause mortality. A propensity score-adjusted and a propensity-matched analysis were undertaken to adjust for imbalances in covariates among men receiving various treatments.  Results:   Patients treated with ADT or WW/AS had a higher likelihood of PCSM than those treated with local therapy alone. Patients treated with primary ADT had an almost two-fold greater likelihood of CVM (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.97) than those treated with local therapy alone; however, patients treated with WW/AS had a greater than two-fold increased risk of CVM (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.53 to 3.95). A propensity-matching algorithm in a subset of 1,391 patients was unable to find a significant difference in CVM between those who did or did not receive ADT.  Conclusion:   Patients matched on propensity to receive ADT did not show an association between ADT and CVM. This suggests that potential unmeasured variables affecting treatment selection may confound the relationship between ADT use and cardiovascular risk.

Design:   To examine decision-making in relation to palliative chemotherapy for advanced cancer, ASPECTS was a qualitative study involving non-participant observation and recording of oncology consultations. During the ProtecT feasibility study, recruitment interviews were routinely audiotaped and in-depth interviews conducted with men to explore their understanding of treatment options and randomization to trial arms.  Results:   ASPECTS identified that insufficient information was given to patients about the survival benefits of palliative chemotherapy with implications for informed consent. ProtecT illustrated the effective use of qualitative research methods to resolve recruitment and randomization problems for a randomized controlled trial.  Conclusions:   These studies illustrate the value of qualitative research, particularly during the earlier phases of the research continuum. Such research may generate hypotheses, strengthen the development and implementation of interventions and enhance their evaluation: all of which are essential to evidence-based medicine.""","""['Suzanne Audrey']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Palliat Med""","""['Improving the effectiveness of interventions in palliative care: the potential role of qualitative research in enhancing evidence from randomized controlled trials.', 'Factors affecting feasibility and acceptability of a practice-based educational intervention to support evidence-based prescribing: a qualitative study.', 'Methodological challenges in supportive and palliative care cancer research.', 'Health-related quality-of-life assessment in GI cancer randomized trials: improving the impact on clinical practice.', 'Alternatives for randomization in lifestyle intervention studies in cancer patients were not better than conventional randomization.', ""Doing palliative care research on hematologic cancer patients: A realist synthesis of literature and experts' opinion on what works, for whom and in what circumstances."", 'Using qualitative methods in pilot and feasibility trials to inform recruitment and retention processes in full-scale randomised trials: a qualitative evidence synthesis.', 'Factors that impact on recruitment to randomised trials in health care: a qualitative evidence synthesis.', ""Women's experiences of medical treatment for endometriosis and its impact on PRE-EMPT trial participation: a qualitative study."", 'Development of an intervention to support patients and clinicians with advanced lung cancer when considering systematic anticancer therapy: protocol for the PACT study.']"""

While radiation has harmful effects, it has utility in many applications such as radiotherapy for cancer. To increase the efficacy of radiation treatment and minimize its risks, a better understanding of the individual differences in radiosensitivity and the molecular basis of radiation response is needed. Here, we integrated human genetic and functional genomic approaches to study the response of human cells to radiation. We measured radiation-induced changes in gene expression and cell death in B cells from normal individuals. We found extensive individual variation in gene expression and cellular responses. To understand the genetic basis of this variation, we mapped the DNA sequence variants that influence expression response to radiation. We also identified radiation-responsive genes that regulate cell death; silencing of these genes by small interfering RNA led to an increase in radiation-induced cell death in human B cells, colorectal and prostate cancer cells. Together these results uncovered DNA variants that contribute to radiosensitivity and identified genes that can be targeted to increase the sensitivity of tumors to radiation.""","""['Denis A Smirnov', 'Lauren Brady', 'Krzysztof Halasa', 'Michael Morley', 'Sonia Solomon', 'Vivian G Cheung']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Genome Res""","""['Genetic analysis of radiation-induced changes in human gene expression.', 'Genetic variation in normal tissue toxicity induced by ionizing radiation.', 'Functional consequences of ATM sequence variants for chromosomal radiosensitivity.', 'Individual response to ionising radiation: What predictive assay(s) to choose?.', 'Functional Assays for Individual Radiosensitivity: A Critical Review.', 'Gene expression variability in long-term survivors of childhood cancer and cancer-free controls in response to ionizing irradiation.', 'Radiation-mediated supply of genetic variation outweighs the effects of selection and drift in Chernobyl Daphnia populations.', 'Transcriptomics for radiation biodosimetry: progress and challenges.', 'Dynamic effects of genetic variation on gene expression revealed following hypoxic stress in cardiomyocytes.', 'Establishment of a Transformation Coupled in vitro End Joining Assay to Estimate Radiosensitivity in Tumor Cells.']"""

The overall goal of these studies is to determine whether dual inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 would prolong the effectiveness of this treatment in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   We used androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and its CRPC sublines LNCaP-AI and C4-2. Additional data were collected in pRNS-1-1 cells stably expressing a mutant androgen receptor (AR-T877A), and in nude mice harboring CWR22 tumors. Studies utilized EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and AG1478, and HER2 inhibitors trastuzumab and AG879.  Results:   Dual EGFR/HER2 inhibition induced apoptosis selectively in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells undergoing AWT, but not in the presence of androgens, or in CRPC cells. We show that AWT alone failed to induce significant apoptosis in androgen-dependent cells, due to AWT-induced increase in HER2 and ErbB3, which promoted survival by increasing Akt phosphorylation. AWT-induced ErbB3 stabilized the AR and stimulated PSA, while it was inactivated only by inhibition of both its dimerization partners EGFR and HER2 (prostate cancer cells do not express ErbB4); but not the inhibition of any one receptor alone, explaining the success of dual EGFR/HER2 inhibition in sensitizing androgen-dependent cells to AWT. The effectiveness of the inhibitors in suppressing growth correlated with its ability to prevent Akt phosphorylation.

Patients and methods:   Group I included 500 of 13,754 men whose cancers were detected through screening, and Group II included 2731 men referred for treatment through the habitual public health system. We used Mann-Whitney and χ(2) tests to compare clinical and pathologic findings, considering significant any P < 0.05.  Results:   Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was lower among screened patients (5.5 ng/mL versus 10.0 ng/mL; P < 0.001). Of the screened patients, 170 (34%) had biopsy Gleason score ≥ 7, compared with 1265 (46.3%) in the referred group (P < 0.001).

Stage migration with the widespread use of PSA screening is well documented; however, the association between the PSA level and tumor volume is less defined. Additionally, the effect of obesity on the serum PSA level might cause relative hemodilution and account for the decreased predictive ability of the PSA level to determine the tumor volume in the modern era.  Methods:   We identified 14 293 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer from 1987 to 2007 and had a documented BMI. Using the clinicopathologic variables, we examined the relationship among the BMI, preoperative PSA level, and tumor volume at radical prostatectomy using multiple linear regression analysis.  Results:   An elevated BMI was associated with an increased pathologic Gleason score (P < .0001), increased tumor volume (P < .0001), and increased prostate size (P < .0001). The preoperative PSA level correlated significantly with the tumor volume (P < .0001). No significant correlation was found between the BMI and preoperative PSA level (P = .39). On multivariate analysis, controlling for the BMI, the preoperative PSA level remained a significant predictor of the tumor volume (P < .0001). The interaction between the preoperative PSA level and BMI in the prediction of the tumor volume was not statistically significant (P = .56), suggesting that the BMI does not affect the association between the PSA level and tumor volume.

The circular, multi-copy mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is used as a sensitive surrogate to oxidative DNA damage. We demonstrate that exogenous H(2)O(2) induces preferential cytotoxicity in aggressive prostate cancer than normal cells; a cascade production of cellular ROS, composed mainly of superoxide (O(2)(-)), is shown to be a critical determinant of H(2)O(2)-induced selective toxicity in cancer cells. In contrast, mtDNA damage and copy number depletion, as measured by a novel two-phase strategy of the supercoiling-sensitive qPCR method, are very sensitive to exogenous H(2)O(2) exposure in both cancer and normal cell lines. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the sensitive mtDNA damage response to exogenous H(2)O(2) is independent of secondary cellular ROS production triggered by several ROS modulators regardless of cell phenotypes.

Screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may decrease mortality. Repeated testing allows for the calculation of PSA velocity (change of PSA over time), which may be a more clinically useful test for prostate cancer than a single PSA measurement. The objective of this study was to examine whether blacks were as likely as whites to report having had repeated PSA testing.  Methods:   The Maryland Cancer Survey 2006 was a population-based, random-digit-dialed statewide survey on cancer screening and risk behaviors of adults aged 40 years or older. We analyzed self-reported information on repeated PSA testing (2 PSA tests in the preceding 3 years) for 1,721 black and white men. We used logistic regression to estimate the effect of race and age on repeated PSA testing, adjusting for other covariates.  Results:   Sixty-five percent of men reported ever having had a PSA test; 41% had repeated PSA testing in the past 3 years. Blacks aged 40 to 49 were more likely to report having repeated PSA testing than whites in this age group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-6.5). Blacks aged 60 to 69 were less likely to report repeated PSA testing than whites (AOR, 0.4, 95% CI, 0.2-0.8). No difference was seen by race among men aged 50 to 59 and men aged 70 or older. Repeated PSA testing was associated with living in an urban area and with having higher education, health insurance, a family history of prostate cancer, and having discussed cancer screening with a doctor.

Methods:   Expression of PSCA on cell lines and primary tumour samples was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.

This project aimed to establish the improvement in accuracy when using gold markers for daily prostate localisation, to assess patient satisfaction and morbidity from the transrectal implantation of gold seed markers and establish staff attitudes towards the newly introduced processes.  Methods:   Twenty patients with prostate cancer had three gold seeds implanted into the base, apex and central zone of the prostate transrectally using ultrasound guidance. Surveys were conducted to assess staff and patient satisfaction with the process of gold seed localisation. The gold markers were used to localise the prostate on a daily basis using megavoltage electronic portal imaging. Measurements were taken to establish the increase in accuracy when using gold fiducial markers compared with using the surrounding bony anatomy.  Results:   Inter-fraction motion (1 standard deviation (SD)) of the fiducial markers was 2.20, 4.28 and 4.27 mm in the LR, SI and AP directions, respectively. Intra-fraction prostate motion (1 SD) was measured as 0.8 mm LR, 1.1 mm SI and 2.0 mm AP. The patient survey showed that the insertion and associated side effects were acceptable, with 5% of patients stating that the seed insertion was worse than the prostate biopsy, and 23.1% of patients experienced short duration (1-2 days) haematuria. The staff survey showed that daily online image guidance was achievable without affecting patient throughput. Thirty percent of treatment staff believed that performing online daily localisation did not add any extra time to a standard treatment, and the remaining 70% thought that the added time was minimal (2-4 min).

Methods:   The South Eastern European Research Oncology Group (SEEROG) collected and analyzed epidemiological data on incidence and mortality that reflect cancer management in 8 countries - Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Slovakia, and Serbia and Montenegro in the last 20-40 years.  Results:   The most common cancer type in men in all countries was lung cancer, followed by colorectal and prostate cancer, with the exception of the Czech Republic, where prostate cancer and colorectal cancer were more common. The most frequent cancer in women was breast cancer followed by colorectal cancer, with the exceptions of Romania and Central Serbia where cervical cancer was the second most common. Cancer mortality data from the last 20-40 years revealed two different patterns in men. In Romania and in Serbia and Montenegro, there was a trend toward an increase, while in the other countries mortality was declining, after increasing for a number of years. In women, a steady decline was observed over many years in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, while in the other countries it remained unchanged.  Conclusions:   There are striking variations in the risk of different cancers by geographic area. Most of the international variation is due to exposure to known or suspected risk factors which provides a clear challenge to prevention.

Early detection of prostate cancer likely to develop rapid recurrence could support neo-adjuvant therapeutics and adjuvant options prior to frank biochemical recurrence. This study compared markers in serum and urine of patients with rapidly recurrent prostate cancer to recurrence-free patients after radical prostatectomy. Based on previous identification of urinary sarcosine as a metastatic marker, we tested whether methionine metabolites in urine and serum could serve as pre-surgical markers for aggressive disease.  Methodology/principal findings:   Urine and serum samples (n = 54 and 58, respectively), collected at the time of prostatectomy were divided into subjects who developed biochemical recurrence within 2 years and those who remained recurrence-free after 5 years. Multiple methionine metabolites were measured in urine and serum by GC-MS. The role of serum metabolites and clinical variables (biopsy Gleason grade, clinical stage, serum prostate specific antigen [PSA]) on biochemical recurrence prediction were evaluated. Urinary sarcosine and cysteine levels were significantly higher (p = 0.03 and p = 0.007 respectively) in the recurrent group. However, in serum, concentrations of homocysteine (p = 0.003), cystathionine (p = 0.007) and cysteine (p<0.001) were more abundant in the recurrent population. The inclusion of serum cysteine to a model with PSA and biopsy Gleason grade improved prediction over the clinical variables alone (p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Higher serum homocysteine, cystathionine, and cysteine concentrations independently predicted risk of early biochemical recurrence and aggressiveness of disease in a nested case control study. The methionine metabolites further supplemented known clinical variables to provide superior sensitivity and specificity in multivariable prediction models for rapid biochemical recurrence following prostatectomy.""","""['Sally Stabler', 'Tatsuki Koyama', 'Zhiguo Zhao', 'Magaly Martinez-Ferrer', 'Robert H Allen', 'Zigmund Luka', 'Lioudmila V Loukachevitch', 'Peter E Clark', 'Conrad Wagner', 'Neil A Bhowmick']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Chemokine markers predict biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following prostatectomy.', 'PSA doubling time as a predictor of clinical progression after biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Discovery and validation of a prostate cancer genomic classifier that predicts early metastasis following radical prostatectomy.', 'Contemporary preoperative parameters predict cancer-free survival after radical prostatectomy: a tool to facilitate treatment decisions.', 'Urinary Biomarkers and Point-of-Care Urinalysis Devices for Early Diagnosis and Management of Disease: A Review.', 'Prediction of disease progression indicators in prostate cancer patients receiving HDR-brachytherapy using Raman spectroscopy and semi-supervised learning: a pilot study.', 'Hydrogen Sulfide Biology and Its Role in Cancer.', 'Molecular Functions of Hydrogen Sulfide in Cancer.', 'Energy Metabolism-Related Gene Prognostic Index Predicts Biochemical Recurrence for Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Materials and methods:   The study was approved by the institutional and research committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. DW MR imaging was performed on a CuSO(4) phantom at 1.5 T with a range of b values and compared with computed DW MR imaging images synthesized from lower b values (0 and 600 sec/mm(2)). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was compared, and agreement between the SNR of computed DW MR imaging and theoretical estimation assessed. Computed DW MR imaging was evaluated in 10 oncologic patients who underwent whole-body DW MR imaging with b values of 0 and 900 sec/mm(2). Computed DW MR images at computed b values of 1500 and 2000 sec/mm(2) were generated. The image quality and background suppression of acquired and computed images were rated by a radiologist using a four-point scale. The diagnostic performance for malignant lesion detection using these images was evaluated and compared by using the McNemar Test.  Results:   The SNR of computed DW MR imaging of the phantom conformed closely to theoretical predictions. Computed DW MR imaging resulted in a higher SNR compared with acquired DW MR imaging, especially at b values greater than 840 sec/mm(2). In patients, images with a computed b value of 2000 sec/mm(2) produced good image quality and high background suppression (mean scores of 2.8 and 4.0, respectively). Evaluation of images with a computed b value of 2000 sec/mm(2) resulted in higher overall diagnostic sensitivity (96.0%) and specificity (96.6%) compared with images with an acquired b value of 900 sec/mm(2) (sensitivity, 89.4%; specificity, 87.5%; P < .01).  Conclusion:   Computed DW MR imaging in the body allows higher-b-value images to be obtained with a good SNR. Clinical computed DW MR imaging is feasible and may improve disease detection.

High risk PCa was defined as T3 tumour, and/or Gleason score 8-10 and/or PSA 20-50 ng/mL. Use of bone scan, curative treatment, and mortality in relation to SES was assessed by logistic, Cox, and competing risk regression with hazard ratios (HR), sub-distributed HR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for co-morbidity, age, calendar period and clinical subgroups.  Results:   Amongst 17,522 high risk prostate cancer patients, a bone scan was more often performed in higher white-collar than in blue-collar workers (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.21-1.40).

Patients and methods:   The clinical data and histopathology reports of patients with retention admitted to Tygerberg Hospital between September 1998 and June 2007 were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test and Fisher's exact test where appropriate and P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.  Results:   Prostatic histology was available in 405 patients, 204 with BPH and 201 with ACP. Comparing those with BPH and those with ACP showed statistically significant differences in mean age (69.5 vs 71.9 years), serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (18.6 vs 899.5 ng/mL) and histological prostatitis (48 vs 25%) but not duration of catheterization, prostate volume or urinary tract infection (UTI). Comparing those with BPH only and those with BPH plus prostatitis showed significant differences in mean age (71.9 vs 67.1 year) and PSA level (14.6 vs 22.8 ng/mL) but not prostate volume, UTI or duration of catheterization. Comparing those with ACP only and those with ACP plus prostatitis showed significant differences in stage T4 cancer (68.1 vs 35.4%) and PSA level (1123.4 vs 232.4 ng/mL) but not age, prostate volume, UTI or duration of catheterization.  Conclusions:   Histological prostatitis was almost twice as common in patients with urinary retention associated with underlying BPH than in patients with ACP, but there was no significant difference in the duration of catheterization, prostatic volume or presence of UTI, suggesting that histological prostatitis more often contributes to the development of retention in patients with underlying BPH than in those with ACP.

Serum testosterone was consistently suppressed below 50 ng/dL in all patients and mean testosterone levels were 13.1, 14.8 and 10.8 ng/dL after 104 weeks (year 2), 156 weeks (year 3) and 208 weeks (year 4) of treatment, respectively. Most patients showed no clinical worsening of their disease, were able to continue normal daily activities, and did not require analgesic medication during the extension period. Mean (SD) time to place the histrelin implant was 4.5 (6.2) min, with only three patients having insertions that were considered difficult. Adverse events were reported in 100 (96.2%) patients. The eight deaths and 28 (26.9%) serious adverse events were judged as unrelated to the study drug. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events was hot flashes in 67 (64.4%) patients. Most of these cases was judged as mild or moderate.  Conclusions:   The once-yearly histrelin implant maintained testosterone suppression for repeated treatment cycles and was generally well tolerated. The histrelin implant provides a clinically attractive option for long-term androgen deprivation therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer seeking fewer office visits and repeated injections.""","""['Neal Shore', 'Michael S Cookson', 'Marc C Gittelman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['An evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the histrelin implant for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy and safety of histrelin subdermal implant in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'An implant releasing the gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone agonist histrelin maintains medical castration for up to 30 months in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Histrelin: in advanced prostate cancer.', 'A review of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties of a once-yearly administered histrelin acetate implant in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Small-molecule inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and more: FDA-approved novel therapeutic drugs for solid tumors from 1991 to 2021.', 'Targeting signaling pathways in prostate cancer: mechanisms and clinical trials.', 'Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering: Addressing Key Design Needs Toward Clinical Translation.', 'Histrelin Implants for Suppression of Puberty in Youth with Gender Dysphoria: A Comparison of 50 mcg/Day (Vantas) and 65 mcg/Day (SupprelinLA).', 'Evaluation of the Release Kinetics of a Pharmacologically Active Substance from Model Intra-Articular Implants Replacing the Cruciate Ligaments of the Knee.']"""

Materials and methods:   The health-economic analysis included four steps: modeling, determination of probabilities, evaluation, and sensitivity analyses. We performed an effectiveness analysis from the patient perspective as well as a cost-effectiveness and a cost-utility analysis from the health insurance perspective for Austria and Germany. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis used a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 patients. The result parameters were number of biopsies, number of detected PCa, and monetary costs. For the cost-efficiency analysis, the result parameters, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs, were calculated for an individual patient.  Results:   The efficiency analysis showed that MRI before a first biopsy can prevent ca. 64,000 unnecessary biopsies/ 100,000 patients. The diagnostic efficiency was higher by a factor of 1.7. Due to MRI, eight PCas were additionally detected. From a health insurance perspective, MRI was not cost-effective. Extra costs of ca. 42 m. € per 100,000 patients and of 650 € per prevented biopsy were calculated. The costs per detected PCa were increased by 1395 €. The attainable QALYs were a little higher for the MRI alternative, which was therefore not dominated.  Conclusion:   Our results do not permit a clear recommendation for or against the application of MRI in the diagnostics of PCa.

Moreover, ferritin degradation and an increase of labile iron pool has been linked to the activation of the JNK signaling axis. In the present work, we extended this study to determine which of the c-jun kinases is responsible for ferritin degradation and the role of iron in DATS-induced cell death. We hypothesized that JNK1 activates Itch ligase which will lead to ferritin ubiquitination, an increase in iron-dependent ROS formation and cell death.  Methods:   PC-3 prostate cancer cells were used in this study. Cell viability, concentration of ROS, labile iron pool, and changes in ferritin and P-Itch and DNA damage were determined.  Results:   We observed that DATS induced ferritin degradation through JNK, Itch signaling axis. DATS did not induce neither ROS formation nor increase the LIP in JNK1-DN transfected cells. We also observed that DATS increased JNK-dependent activating phosphorylation of E3ligase Itch. The cells transfected with inactive form of Itch were more resistant against cytotoxicity of DATS and showed lower DATS-induced ferritin degradation.

Some clinicians have advocated focal prostatic ablation as an alternative to more aggressive interventions to manage these lesions. To identify which patients might benefit from focal ablative techniques, we analysed the surgical specimens of a large sample of population-detected men undergoing radical prostatectomy as part of a randomised clinical trial.  Methods:   Surgical specimens from 525 men who underwent prostatectomy within the ProtecT study were analysed to determine tumour volume, location and grade. These findings were compared with information available in the biopsy specimen to examine whether focal therapy could be provided appropriately.  Results:   Solitary cancers were found in prostatectomy specimens from 19% (100 out of 525) of men. In addition, 73 out of 425 (17%) men had multiple cancers with a solitary significant tumour focus. Thus, 173 out of 525 (33%) men had tumours potentially suitable for focal therapy. The majority of these were small, well-differentiated lesions that appeared to be pathologically insignificant (38-66%). Criteria used to select patients for focal prostatic ablation underestimated the cancer's significance in 26% (34 out of 130) of men and resulted in overtreatment in more than half. Only 18% (24 out of 130) of men presumed eligible for focal therapy, actually had significant solitary lesions.  Conclusion:   Focal therapy appears inappropriate for the majority of men presenting with prostate-specific antigen-detected localised prostate cancer. Unifocal prostate cancers suitable for focal ablation are difficult to identify pre-operatively using biopsy alone.

This study demonstrates that in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, expression of c-JUN, JUN-B, c-FOS, and FOS-B was induced by the AAR, whereas JUN-D, FRA-1, and FRA-2 were not. Of the four activated FOS/JUN members, c-JUN made the largest contribution to the induction of several known AAR target genes. For several human liver, prostate, and ovarian cell lines, the AAR-induced increase in c-JUN expression was greater in transformed cells compared with nontransformed counterparts, an effect independent of cell growth rate. Thus far, the best characterized AA-responsive genes are all transcriptionally activated by ATF4, but the AAR-dependent induction of c-JUN transcription was ATF4-independent. The increased expression of c-JUN was dependent on ATF2 and on activation of the MEK-ERK and JNK arms of the MAPK signaling pathways. Formation of c-JUN-ATF2-activated heterodimers was increased after AA limitation, and c-JUN or ATF2 knockdown suppressed the induction of c-JUN and other AAR target genes. AA deprivation triggers a feed-forward process that involves phosphorylation of existing c-JUN protein by JNK and subsequent auto-activation of the c-JUN gene by recruitment of c-JUN and ATF2 to two AP-1 sites within the proximal promoter. The results document the novel observation that AP-1 sequences within the c-JUN gene can function as transcriptional amino acid-response elements.""","""['Lingchen Fu', 'Mukundh Balasubramanian', 'Jixiu Shan', 'Elizabeth E Dudenhausen', 'Michael S Kilberg']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['MAPK signaling triggers transcriptional induction of cFOS during amino acid limitation of HepG2 cells.', 'Regulation of the ATF3 gene by a single promoter in response to amino acid availability and endoplasmic reticulum stress in human primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cells.', 'ERK signaling pathway is involved in p15INK4b/p16INK4a expression and HepG2 growth inhibition triggered by TPA and Saikosaponin a.', 'The roles of ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2) in tumorigenesis.', 'ATF4-dependent transcription mediates signaling of amino acid limitation.', 'Clonal transcriptomics identifies mechanisms of chemoresistance and empowers rational design of combination therapies.', 'Regulation of Hepatic Metabolism and Cell Growth by the ATF/CREB Family of Transcription Factors.', 'Oncogenic K-Ras4B Dimerization Enhances Downstream Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Signaling.', 'Induction of early growth response gene 1 (EGR1) by endoplasmic reticulum stress is mediated by the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) arm of the MAPK pathways.', 'A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network identification for exploring underlying pathogenesis and therapy strategy of hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Mixed model ANOVAs showed that while U.S.-born African Americans had few discrepancies between self-report and Stroop-ascertained anxiety, Jamaicans reported greater PC anxiety than indicated by Stroop performance, while the opposite was true among U.S.-born Europeans. As expected, self-reported (but not Stroop-ascertained) PC anxiety predicted screening in multivariate analysis. Although men from different age and ethnic groups varied in the discrepancy between self-reported and Stroop-ascertained PC anxiety, the influence of avoidance-producing emotions appears to operate predominantly through conscious channels.""","""['Nathan S Consedine']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['Prostate cancer screening behavior in men from seven ethnic groups: the fear factor.', 'Fear, knowledge, and efficacy beliefs differentially predict the frequency of digital rectal examination versus prostate specific antigen screening in ethnically diverse samples of older men.', ""African-American and Caribbean-Born Men's Perceptions of Prostate Cancer Fear and Facilitators for Screening Behavior: a Pilot Study."", 'Using the health belief model in understanding prostate cancer in African American men.', 'Social ecological predictors of prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal examination in black American men.', 'Is there any association between prostate-specific antigen screening frequency and uptake of active surveillance in men with low or very low risk prostate cancer?', 'Assessing anxiety in Black men with prostate cancer: further data on the reliability and validity of the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC).', 'Addressing cancer control needs of African-born immigrants in the US: a systematic literature review.', 'Beyond the black box: a systematic review of breast, prostate, colorectal, and cervical screening among native and immigrant African-descent Caribbean populations.']"""

Our aim is to clarify a suitable group whereby a bone scan could be spared at the initial staging of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Consecutive 857 patients who were newly diagnosed from 2004 through 2009 and received bone scans using technetium 99m methylene diphosphonate at the initial staging were enrolled. The proportion of positive bone metastases by age distribution, prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis, Gleason score and clinical T stage were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the predictors of positive bone metastases.  Results:   Of all 857 patients, 40 patients (4.7%) showed bone metastases. Patients with higher age, prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage and Gleason score showed significantly higher rate of bone metastases (P < 0.001). In univariate logistic regression analyses, age, prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage and Gleason score were independent predictors of bone metastasis. The multivariate analysis showed that both the prostate-specific antigen level >50 ng/ml and the Gleason score ≥4 + 3 were independent predictors of bone metastases.

PSA is not cancer-specific, cannot be used as a cancer marker and it has been demonstrated that there is no level of PSA that is definitive for prostate cancer. The value of the PSA test varies when used for screening, diagnosis, prognosis or as a signal of disease recurrence. Misuse of the test for screening has created unnecessary anxiety and costs, and has led to the significant overdiagnosis and overtreatment of men. More important than whether or not to screen is how one acts upon the data from a single test; with the exception of extremely high double- or triple-digit levels of PSA, it is prudent only to use a single PSA determination as a baseline, with biopsy and cancer treatment reserved for those with significant PSA changes over time, or for those with clinical manifestations mandating immediate therapy. Using the PSA test to monitor disease progression or recurrence is appropriate, provided one understands that absolute levels of PSA are rarely meaningful; it is the relative change in PSA levels over time that provides insight, but not definitive proof of a cancerous condition necessitating therapy. PSA secretion is under hormonal control and thus PSA levels may be affected differently by the type of drug therapy, by the stage of a patients' disease, and by genetic factors suggesting some men are 'high PSA producers'. Until a validated alternative test for prostate cancer is found and adopted, the current flawed PSA test needs to be used more judiciously and not used for routine screening as studies have demonstrated that screening, as defined, does not lead to a reduction in patient mortality. All men, their families and their physicians need to understand the significant limitations of PSA testing.""","""['Mark R Haythorn', 'Richard J Ablin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biomark Med""","""['Prostate-specific antigen testing in Ontario: reasons for testing patients without diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in Austria.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'PSA-based screening for prostate cancer.

It is believed that some diseases like cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, cachexia, anaemia are systemic consequences of COPD. Some data show that the co-morbidities are more frequent in severe COPD patients than in control groups and are associated with the serious health outcomes. It is debated whether extra pulmonary comorbidities or pulmonary complications are the main reason of death in COPD. The aim of the study was to analyze the mortality and comorbidity in COPD patients who died during hospitalization in the Department of Pneumonology and Allergology in WMU from 2004 to 2008.  Material and methods:   We analyzed 266 records of patients who had diagnosis of COPD and died during hospitalization (179 [67%] M and 87 [33%] F). The mean age at death was 73 ± 8 years (M 73 ± 8 years, F 74 ± 9 years).  Results:   The most frequent cause of death were: COPD exacerbation (n = 81 [30%], F = 32, M = 49), pneumonia (n = 67 [25%], F = 17, M = 50), lung cancer (n = 50 [19%], F = 18, M = 32), ischemic heart disease (n = 20 [7%], F = 5, M = 15), cardiovascular insufficiency (n = 14 [5%], F = 6, M = 8) and other (n = 34 [14%]). The lung cancer was more frequent cause of death in younger patients (p = 0.002), and pneumonia in older (p = 0.02).

This occurred without affecting systemic pH, which was compensated. Additionally, these prior data did not rule out the possibility that bicarbonate was working though effects on carbonic anhydrase, and not as a buffer per se. Here, we present evidence that chronic ingestion of a non-volatile buffer, 2-imidazole-1-yl-3-ethoxycarbonylpropionic acid (IEPA) with a pK (a) of 6.9 also reduced metastasis in an experimental PC3M prostate cancer mouse model. Animals (n = 30) were injected with luciferase expressing PC3M prostate cancer cells either subcutaneously (s.c., n = 10) or intravenously (i.v., n = 20). Four days prior to inoculations, half of the animals for each experiment were provided drinking water containing 200 mM IEPA buffer. Animals were imaged weekly to follow metastasis, and these data showed that animals treated with IEPA had significantly fewer experimental lung metastasis compared to control groups (P < 0.04). Consistent with prior work, the pH of treated tumors was elevated compared to controls. IEPA is observable by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy and this was used to measure the presence of IEPA in the bladder, confirming that it was orally available. The results of this study indicate that metastasis can be reduced by non-volatile buffers as well as bicarbonate and thus the effect appears to be due to pH buffering per se.""","""['Arig Ibrahim Hashim', 'Heather H Cornnell', 'Maria de Lourdes Coelho Ribeiro', 'Dominique Abrahams', 'Jessica Cunningham', 'Mark Lloyd', 'Gary V Martinez', 'Robert A Gatenby', 'Robert J Gillies']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Bicarbonate increases tumor pH and inhibits spontaneous metastases.', 'Mapping extracellular pH in rat brain gliomas in vivo by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging: comparison with maps of metabolites.', 'Free Base Lysine Increases Survival and Reduces Metastasis in Prostate Cancer Model.', 'Animal models of bone metastasis.', 'Acidosis and cancer: from mechanism to neutralization.', 'Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Implemented with Multiple Harmonic Detections Successfully Maps Extracellular pH In Vivo.', 'Intraperitoneal Delivery of Iopamidol to Assess Extracellular pH of Orthotopic Pancreatic Tumor Model by CEST-MRI.', 'Back to basic: Trials and tribulations of alkalizing agents in cancer.', 'Tumor acidity: From hallmark of cancer to target of treatment.', 'Autoregulation of H+/lactate efflux prevents monocarboxylate transport (MCT) inhibitors from reducing glycolytic lactic acid production.']"""

A structured questionnaire was used to assess the estimated workload of the respondents, with reference to prostate cancer management, the stage proportion at the time of diagnosis, and the proportion of patients requesting for CaP screening. The data was analyzed using the SPSS version 15 statistical software.  Results:   Twenty-two respondents completed and returned the questionnaire and formed the basis of further analysis.

The majority of the respondents managed between one and fifteen new patients with CaP every month, with 36.4% of them managing more than 15 new patients on an average every month. About 95.4% of all the patients seen by the respondents were diagnosed with advanced stages of the disease, while the remaining ones were incidental findings.

The majority of respondents, 20 (22); 90.9%, were 'not aware' of any national guideline on CaP screening.  Conclusions:   A majority of practitioners affirmed that patients with prostate cancer present late. The mean number of patients requesting for screening for prostate cancer per month, per respondent, for CaP, is still low.

Further investigation was performed to determine whether PET can detect early changes in tumor metabolism after androgen ablation therapy through surgical castration.  Methods:   PET was performed on 4 consecutive days. In addition, the CWR22 and PAC120 tumor models were surgically castrated after the baseline measurement and imaged again after castration. The tracer uptake was analyzed using time-activity curves, percentage injected dose per volume (%ID/cm(3)), and tumor-to-muscle ratio (T/M).  Results:   Regarding the hormone-independent prostate tumor models, (18)F-FLT showed the best T/M and highest %ID/cm(3) in PC-3 (2.97 ± 0.63 %ID/cm(3)) and DU145 (2.06 ± 0.75 %ID/cm(3)) tumors. (18)F-FDG seemed to be the tracer of choice for delineation of the PC-3 tumors but not for the DU145 tumors. Using (11)C-choline (PC-3: 1.33 ± 0.29 %ID/cm(3), DU145: 1.60 ± 0.27 %ID/cm(3)) and (18)F-FEC, we did not find any significant uptake in the tumors, compared with muscle tissue. Regarding the hormone-dependent prostate tumor models, the CWR22 model showed a highly significant (P < 0.01) decrease in tumor (18)F-FDG uptake from 4.11 ± 1.29 %ID/cm(3) to 2.19 ± 1.45 %ID/cm(3) after androgen ablation therapy. However, the (18)F-FLT, (11)C-choline, or (18)F-FEC tracers did not provide sufficient uptake or reliable information about therapy response in CWR22 tumors. The PAC120 model showed a significant increase in (18)F-FLT tumor uptake (P = 0.015) after androgen ablation therapy. The accumulation of (18)F-FEC (before: 2.32 ± 1.01 %ID/cm(3), after: 1.36 ± 0.39 %ID/cm(3)) was found to be the next highest after (18)F-FDG (before: 2.45 ± 0.93 %ID/cm(3), after: 2.18 ± 0.65 %ID/cm(3)) in PAC120 tumors before castration and is better suited for monitoring therapy response.  Conclusion:   This comprehensive study in 2 hormone-dependent and 2 hormone-independent prostate tumor mouse models shows that (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FDG are the most appropriate tracers for delineation of PC-3, DU145 (except (18)F-FDG), and CWR22 tumors, but not for PAC120 tumors. (18)F-FEC and (11)C-choline, in particular, revealed insufficient T/M ratio in the prostate tumor models.

These malignancies include leukemias, lymphomas, multiple myeloma, brain cancer, melanoma and skin, lung, prostate, breast, ovarian, liver, gastrointestinal, pancreatic and colorectal epithelial cancers. Curcumin mediates its anti-proliferative, anti-invasive and apoptotic effects on cancer cells, including cancer stem/progenitor cells and their progenies, through multiple molecular mechanisms. The oncogenic pathways inhibited by curcumin encompass the members of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR and erbB2), sonic hedgehog (SHH)/GLIs and Wnt/β-catenin and downstream signaling elements such as Akt, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). In counterbalance, the high metabolic instability and poor systemic bioavailability of curcumin limit its therapeutic efficacy in human. Of great therapeutic interest, the selective delivery of synthetic analogs or nanotechnology-based formulations of curcumin to tumors, alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs, may improve their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic efficacies against cancer progression and relapse.

A set of computational parameters are hypothesized that will give a dose plan that meets dosimetric criteria. A dose plan is computed using these parameters, and if any dosimetric criteria are not met, the process is iterated until a suitable dose plan is found. In this way, the dose distribution is controlled by abstract parameters. The purpose of this study is to develop a new approach for HDR brachytherapy by directly optimizing the dose distribution based on dosimetric criteria.  Methods:   The authors developed inverse planning by integer program (IPIP), an optimization model for computing HDR brachytherapy dose plans and a fast heuristic for it. They used their heuristic to compute dose plans for 20 anonymized prostate cancer image data sets from patients previously treated at their clinic database. Dosimetry was evaluated and compared to dosimetric criteria.  Results:   Dose plans computed from IPIP satisfied all given dosimetric criteria for the target and healthy tissue after a single iteration. The average target coverage was 95%. The average computation time for IPIP was 30.1 s on an Intel(R) Core 2 Duo CPU 1.67 GHz processor with 3 Gib RAM.  Conclusions:   IPIP is an HDR brachytherapy planning system that directly incorporates dosimetric criteria. The authors have demonstrated that IPIP has clinically acceptable performance for the prostate cases and dosimetric criteria used in this study, in both dosimetry and runtime. Further study is required to determine if IPIP performs well for a more general group of patients and dosimetric criteria, including other cancer sites such as GYN.""","""['Timmy Siauw', 'Adam Cunha', 'Alper Atamtürk', 'I-Chow Hsu', 'Jean Pouliot', 'Ken Goldberg']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'A gEUD-based inverse planning technique for HDR prostate brachytherapy: feasibility study.', 'Comparison of high-dose rate prostate brachytherapy dose distributions with iridium-192, ytterbium-169, and thulium-170 sources.', 'Dosimetry procedure to verify dose in High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment of cancer patients: A systematic review.', 'A review of dosimetric impact of implementation of model-based dose calculation algorithms (MBDCAs) for HDR brachytherapy.', 'Bi-objective optimization of catheter positions for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'An extended dose-volume model in high dose-rate brachytherapy - Using mean-tail-dose to reduce tumor underdosage.', 'A fast multitarget inverse treatment planning strategy optimizing dosimetric measures for high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy.', 'A survey of quality control practices for high dose rate (HDR) and pulsed dose rate (PDR) brachytherapy in the United Kingdom.', 'Physics-aspects of dose accuracy in high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy: source dosimetry, treatment planning, equipment performance and in vivo verification techniques.']"""

The authors investigate dosimetrically driven action thresholds (whether treatment needs to be interrupted and patient repositioned) in VMAT treatment with electromagnetic (EM) tracking.  Methods:   VMAT plans for five patients are generated for prescription doses of 32.5 and 42.5 Gy in five fractions. Planning target volume (PTV) encloses the clinical target volume (CTV) with a 3 mm margin at the prostate-rectal interface and 5 mm elsewhere. The VMAT delivery is modeled using 180 equi-spaced static beams. Intrafraction prostate motion is simulated in the plan by displacing the beam isocenter at each beam assuming rigid organ motion according to a previously recorded trajectory of the transponder centroid. The cumulative dose delivered in each fraction is summed over all beams. Two sets of 57 prostate motion trajectories were randomly selected to form a learning and a testing dataset. Dosimetric end points including CTV D95%, rectum wall D1cc, bladder wall D1cc, and urethra Dmax, are analyzed against motion characteristics including the maximum amplitude of the anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), and left-right components. Action thresholds are triggered when intrafraction motion causes any violations of dose constraints to target and organs at risk (OAR), so that treatment is interrupted and patient is repositioned.  Results:   Intrafraction motion has a little effect on CTV D95%, indicating PTV margins are adequate. Tight posterior and inferior action thresholds around 1 mm need to be set in a patient specific manner to spare organs at risk, especially when the prescription dose is 42.5 Gy. Advantages of setting patient specific action thresholds are to reduce false positive alarms by 25% when prescription dose is low, and increase the sensitivity of detecting dose limits violations by 30% when prescription dose is high, compared to a generic 2 mm action box. The sensitivity and specificity calculated from the testing dataset are consistent to the learning set, which indicates that the patient specific approach is reliable and reproducible within the scope of the prostate database.  Conclusions:   This work introduces a formalism for ensuring a VMAT delivery meets the most clinically important dose requirements by using patient specific and dosimetric-driven action thresholds to hold the beam and reposition the patient when necessary. Such methods can provide improved sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional methods, which assume directionally symmetric action thresholds.""","""['Pengpeng Zhang', 'Dennis Mah', 'Laura Happersett', 'Brett Cox', 'Margie Hunt', 'Gig Mageras']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Robust plan optimization for electromagnetic transponder guided hypo-fractionated prostate treatment using volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'What is the Optimal Dose, Fractionation and Volume for Bladder Radiotherapy?', 'A review of artificial intelligence applications for motion tracking in radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'A Simulation Study of Tolerance of Breathing Amplitude Variations in Radiotherapy of Lung Cancer Using 4DCT and Time-Resolved 4DMRI.', 'Adaptive Imaging Versus Periodic Surveillance for Intrafraction Motion Management During Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Simulating intrafraction prostate motion with a random walk model.', 'Target margins in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.']"""

The authors assessed the impact of individual comorbid illnesses on the risk of early, other-cause death in prostate cancer treatment candidates and propose a modification of an existing comorbidity scale.  Methods:   A population-based case-cohort study included patients diagnosed from 1990 through 1998 in Ontario, Canada who had planned curative radiotherapy or prostatectomy. The subcohort numbered 1643, and the case sample (those dying of other causes within 10 years) numbered 630. Ontario Cancer Registry data were linked to data from medical charts, including: age, comorbidity using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G), stage, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and treatment. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the age-adjusted association between CIRS-G and other-cause death.  Results:   Respiratory and cardiac diseases were the most common comorbidities and most strongly associated with an increased risk of death. Other important comorbidities included vascular disease, renal disease, and diabetes. The modified CIRS-G(pros) score yielded a relative risk (RR) of 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-1.76) for those scoring 1 compared with 0 and RR 1.18 (95% CI, 1.15-1.21) for each increment above 1.

BALB/c mice immunized with PSA-MPyVLPs were only marginally protected against outgrowth of a PSA-expressing tumor. To improve protection, PSA-MPyVLPs were co-injected with adjuvant CpG, either alone or loaded onto murine dendritic cells (DCs). Immunization with PSA-MPyVLPs loaded onto DCs in the presence of CpG was shown to efficiently protect mice from tumor outgrowth.

Using web-based questionnaires, we gathered self-reported data on 50 medical phenotypes from a generally unselected cohort of over 20,000 genotyped individuals. Of a list of genetic associations curated by NHGRI, we successfully replicated about 75% of the associations that we expected to (based on the number of cases in our cohort and reported odds ratios, and excluding a set of associations with contradictory published evidence). Altogether we replicated over 180 previously reported associations, including many for type 2 diabetes, prostate cancer, cholesterol levels, and multiple sclerosis. We found significant variation across categories of conditions in the percentage of expected associations that we were able to replicate, which may reflect systematic inflation of the effects in some initial reports, or differences across diseases in the likelihood of misdiagnosis or misreport. We also demonstrated that we could improve replication success by taking advantage of our recontactable cohort, offering more in-depth questions to refine self-reported diagnoses.

Following a study of increased risks of lung cancer due to cadmium emission (hazard ratio was 4.2 for high vs. low cadmium exposure areas in that study), we used data from the three regional population-based cancer registries, covering an area with 2.9 million inhabitants. Analyses of observed incidence were carried out for all cancers and cancer of the lung, kidney, bladder, prostate, testis, and breast separately. At the municipality level standardized incidence ratios were calculated and smoothed using a Poisson-gamma or a conditional autoregressive model. To detect clusters and to calculate an observed/expected ratio (O/E ratio) for each cluster a spatial scan statistic was applied. Significantly increased cancer incidence rates were found at a multimunicipality level for female lung cancer (O/E ratio=1.2), male and female bladder cancer (O/E ratio male=1.8, O/E ratio female=1.7), and prostate cancer (O/E ratio=1.3), none of these clusters being located specifically around the area of the zinc smelters.

In T2*-weighted image (T2*-WI), seeds can be easily detected without the use of an intravenous contrast material. We present a novel method for postimplant dosimetry using T2*-WI/T2-weighted image (T2-WI) fusion. We compared the outcomes of T2*-WI/T2-WI fusion-based and CT/T2-WI fusion-based postimplant dosimetry. Between April 2008 and July 2009, 50 consecutive prostate cancer patients underwent brachytherapy. All the patients were treated with 144 Gy of brachytherapy alone. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters (prostate D90, prostate V100, prostate V150, urethral D10, and rectal D2cc) were prospectively compared between T2*-WI/T2-WI fusion-based and CT/T2-WI fusion-based dosimetry. All the DVH parameters estimated by T2*-WI/T2-WI fusion-based dosimetry strongly correlated to those estimated by CT/T2-WI fusion-based dosimetry (0.77 ≤ R ≤ 0.91). No significant difference was observed in these parameters between the two methods, except for prostate V150 (p = 0.04). These results show that T2*-WI/T2-WI fusion-based dosimetry is comparable or superior to MRI-based dosimetry as previously reported, because no intravenous contrast material is required. For some patients, rather large differences were observed in the value between the 2 methods. We thought these large differences were a result of seed miscounts in T2*-WI and shifts in fusion. Improving the image quality of T2*-WI and the image acquisition speed of T2*-WI and T2-WI may decrease seed miscounts and fusion shifts. Therefore, in the future, T2*-WI/T2-WI fusion may be more useful for postimplant dosimetry of prostate brachytherapy.""","""['Norihisa Katayama', 'Mitsuhiro Takemoto', 'Kotaro Yoshio', 'Kuniaki Katsui', 'Tatsuya Uesugi', 'Yasutomo Nasu', 'Toshi Matsushita', 'Mitsumasa Kaji', 'Hiromi Kumon', 'Susumu Kanazawa']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Interobserver variability of 3.0-tesla and 1.5-tesla magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography fusion image-based post-implant dosimetry of prostate brachytherapy.', 'Importance of the CT/MRI fusion method as a learning tool for CT-based postimplant dosimetry in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Correlation between real-time intraoperative and postoperative dosimetry and its implications on intraoperative planning.', 'The American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for permanent prostate brachytherapy postimplant dosimetric analysis.', 'Prostate volume measurement by transrectal ultrasound and computed tomography before and after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Pulse sequence considerations for simulation and postimplant dosimetry of prostate brachytherapy.', 'Radiotherapy planning using MRI.', 'A new two-step accurate CT-MRI fusion technique for post-implant prostate cancer.']"""

However, the relationships between phenotype-related loci and lncRNAs are largely unknown. Utilizing the 1000 Genomes data, we compared single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the sequences of lncRNA and protein-coding genes as defined in the Ensembl database. We further annotated the phenotype-related SNPs reported by GWAS at lncRNA intervals. Because prostate cancer (PCa) risk-related loci were enriched in lncRNAs, we then performed meta-analysis of two existing GWAS for discovery and an additional sample set for replication, revealing PCa risk-related loci at lncRNA regions. The SNP density in regions of lncRNA was similar to that in protein-coding regions, but they were less polymorphic than surrounding regions. Among the 1998 phenotype-related SNPs identified by GWAS, 52 loci were located directly in lncRNA intervals with a 1.5-fold enrichment compared with the entire genome. More than a 5-fold enrichment was observed for eight PCa risk-related loci in lncRNA genes. We also identified a new PCa risk-related SNP rs3787016 in an lncRNA region at 19q13 (per allele odds ratio = 1.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.27) with P value of 7.22 × 10(-7). lncRNAs may be important for interpreting and mining GWAS data.

AR antagonists repress the AR by recruitment of corepressors. Not much is known about the inactivation of AR by corepressors in the presence of agonists (androgens). Here we show that the corepressor LCoR acts as an androgen-dependent corepressor that represses human PCa growth in vivo. In line with this, progressive decrease of ligand-dependent corepressor expression was observed in the PCa TRAMP mouse model with increasing age. LCoR interacts with AR and is recruited to chromatin in an androgen-induced manner. Unexpectedly, the LXXLL motif of LCoR is dispensable for interaction with the AR. Rather, the data indicate that LCoR interacts with the AR DNA binding domain on DNA. Interestingly, the interaction of LCoR with AR is inhibited by signaling pathways that are associated with androgen-independent PCa. Here we also show that the Src kinase inactivates the corepressive function of LCoR. Interfering with endogenous Src function by a dominant negative Src mutant, the growth inhibitory activity of LCoR is enhanced in vivo in a xenograft mouse model system. Thus, our studies indicate a role of LCoR as an AR corepressor and a tumor suppressor.

The absence of precise clinical staging modalities currently makes it difficult to predict which patients are most appropriate for AS. The goal of our study was to evaluate the ability of endorectal MRI (eMRI) to predict adverse pathologic features in patients who would otherwise qualify for an AS program.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed our institution's radical prostatectomy (RP) database from 1991 to 2007 and identified 172 patients who would have qualified for AS and underwent preoperative staging eMRI with T2-weighted (T2W) sequences. MRI findings were correlated to final pathology in order to assess the ability of staging eMRI to predict adverse pathologic features in patients suitable for AS.  Results:   The mean age of our cohort was 59.8 ± 6.2 years. The mean PSA at the time of diagnosis was 5.2 ± 2.2 ng/ml. In 51% of patients, no discrete tumor was visualized on eMRI and in 49% of patients a discrete tumor was detected. At the time of RP, Gleason score upgrading, extracapsular extension, and a positive surgical margin occurred in 17%, 6%, and 5% of cases, respectively. Patients with documented tumor on eMRI did not have an increased incidence of adverse pathologic findings with regard to tumor volume (P = 0.31), extra-capsular extension (P = 0.82), Gleason upgrading (P = 0.92), seminal vesicle invasion (P = 0.97), or positive surgical margin rate (P = 0.95) compared with those in whom no tumor was seen.

Maspin and RelB expression is correlated negatively in prostate cancer tissues at the later stage. TNF-α signaling triggers the nuclear accumulation of RelB and the concomitant reduction of Maspin expression in a time-dependent manner. In addition, the proteasome inhibitor-induced Maspin expression is accompanied by the reduction of RelB expression. A successful depletion of RelB expression, but not RelA expression, induces Maspin expression. RelB-deficiency abrogates the proteasome inhibitor-induced Maspin expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that the enforced expression of RelB protein in prostate cancer cells inhibits Maspin expression.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 3,763 male and female patients from a urology database at a single academic institution. Patients were identified whose levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured for the first time between 1997 and 2010. We determined the prevalence of normal--greater than 30, insufficient--20 to 29 and deficient--less than 20 ng/ml 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.  Results:   Overall 2,559 patients (68%) had suboptimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (less than 30 ng/ml), of whom 1,331 (52%) were frankly deficient (less than 20 ng/ml) in the vitamin. Vitamin D deficiency was more common in patients younger than age 50 years (44.5%), black (53.2%) and Hispanic (41.6%) patients (p <0.001), and patients without an existing urological malignancy (35.4%, p <0.001). On multivariate analysis race, age, season and cancer diagnosis were independent predictors of vitamin D status.  Conclusions:   Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in urological patients at a major urban medical center. Urologists should consider recommending appropriate supplementation during the initial assessment of all patients.""","""['Max S Pitman', 'Philippa J Cheetham', 'Gregory W Hruby', 'Aaron E Katz']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Hypovitaminosis D in medical inpatients.', 'Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and its relationship with pain.', 'Are low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases or malignancies in renal transplantation?', 'Hypovitaminosis D among healthy children in the United States: a review of the current evidence.', 'Vitamin D in chronic liver disease.', 'Active Holistic Surveillance: The Nutritional Aspect of Delayed Intervention in Prostate Cancer.']"""

In the present study, we evaluated the expression of N-cadherin in human prostate cancer tissue specimens and cell lines. Enhanced expression of N-cadherin was observed in both the malignant and bone-metastasized prostate tissue specimens compared to the healthy prostate tissues. Consistent with the tissue array data, N-cadherin was highly expressed in PC3, but not in Du145 and LNCaP human prostate cell lines. Based on cell to cell binding assay, we found that N-cadherin expression facilitates homotypic interaction between human prostate cancer cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). Human angiogenesis antibody array and in vitro angiogenesis assay showed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of N-cadherin reduced the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which played a potential role in stimulating capillary network formation of HMEC. Additionally, culture supernatant of Du145 cells transfected with full-length N-cadherin expressing plasmid showed increased MCP-1 expression and chemoattractant ability compared to normal Du145 cells. Further, we noticed that blocking PI3K activity inhibited N-cadherin mediated MCP-1 expression.

Parameter maps were calculated for all parameters.  Results:   The ADC, D and f were significantly (P<.005) lowered in cancerous tissue (1.01±0.22 μm(2)/ms, 0.84±0.19 μm(2)/ms and 14.27±7.10%, respectively) compared to benign tissue (1.49±0.17 μm(2)/ms, 1.21±0.22 μm(2)/ms and 21.25±8.32%, respectively).

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the postprostatectomy salvage setting is gaining interest as a treatment strategy.  Objective:   Compare acute and late toxicities in patients treated with IMRT and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in the postprostatectomy salvage setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 285 patients who were treated at our institution between 1988 and 2007 with SRT after radical prostatectomy for biochemical recurrence were identified. All medical records were reviewed and toxicity recorded. Median follow-up was 60 mo.  Intervention:   All patients were treated with SRT with either 3D-CRT (n=109) or IMRT (n=176). A total of 205 patients (72%) were treated with doses ≥70Gy.  Measurements:   Late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities were recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v. 3.0 definition.  Results and limitations:   The 5-yr actuarial rates of late grade ≥2 GI and GU toxicity were 5.2% and 17.0%, respectively. IMRT was independently associated with a reduction in grade ≥2 GI toxicity compared with 3D-CRT (5-yr IMRT, 1.9%; 5-yr 3D-CRT, 10.2%; p=0.02). IMRT was not associated with a reduction in risk of grade ≥2 GU toxicity (5-yr IMRT, 16.8%; 5-yr 3D-CRT, 15.8%; p=0.86), urinary incontinence (5-yr IMRT, 13.6%; 5-yr 3D-CRT, 7.9%; p=0.25), or grade 3 erectile dysfunction (5-yr IMRT, 26%; 5-yr 3D-CRT, 30%; p=0.82). Of patients who developed late grade ≥2 GI or GU toxicity, 38% and 44%, respectively, experienced resolution of their symptoms prior to the last follow-up.

Despite the stage migration witnessed in patients with prostate cancer since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, detection of extraprostatic disease at the time of surgery and biochemical recurrence following prostatectomy pose significant therapeutic challenges. Radiation therapy (RT) after radical prostatectomy (RP) has been associated with a survival benefit in both the adjuvant and salvage setting. Nevertheless, optimal targeting of the prostate bed following surgery remains challenging. The Calypso 4D Localization System (Calypso Medical Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) is a target positioning device that continuously monitors the location of three implantable electromagnetic transponders. These transponders can be placed into the empty prostatic bed after prostatectomy to facilitate the delivery of radiation therapy in the post-surgical setting. In this article, we detail our technique for transrectal placement of electromagnetic transponders into the post-prostatectomy bed for the delivery of adjuvant or salvage intensity-modulated radiation therapy. We prefer this technique of post-surgical radiation therapy because it allows for improved localization of the target area allowing for the maximal delivery of the radiation dose while minimizing exposure of surrounding normal tissues.

A total of 71.5% of men under 65 years old reported full urinary continence, while only 57.0% of men older than 65 considered themselves continent. Men < 65 years recovered full urinary control significantly faster than men older than 65 years- 3.6 versus 4.7 months. Neurovascular bundle resection has a negative effect on continence.  Conclusions:   The ultimate continence status should be measured with self-administered disease specific questionnaires at 24 months after RP, as it differs from standard physician reported methods. Age and neurovascular bundle resection are variables affecting continence. We believe that patients' subjective reports of their continence are crucial and that multiple outcomes should be objectively measured. Therefore we suggest that validated questionnaires dealing with the patients' perspective postoperatively should be included in routine follow up.""","""['Franklin E Kuehhas', 'Ralph Naegele', 'Elisabeth Eckersberger', 'Markus Margreiter', 'Ralf Herwig', 'Amir Kazzazi', 'Bob Djavan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: incidence by definition, risk factors and temporal trend in a large series with a long-term follow-up.', 'Urinary continence after radical prostatectomy: the Columbia experience.', 'Role of bladder neck preservation in urinary continence following radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Risk factors for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Safety and outcome of early catheter removal after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Early Continence and Extravasation After Open Retropubic Radical Prostatectomy - Interrupted vs Continuous Suturing for Vesicourethral Anastomosis.', 'Very Early Continence After Radical Prostatectomy and Its Influencing Factors.', 'Effect of Continuous Urethro-Vesical Anastomosis Technique in Incontinence After Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy, 1:1 Matching Study.', 'Age and comorbidity in early prostate cancer.', 'Current trends in the management of post-prostatectomy incontinence.']"""

The study objective was to cross-validate the PCRT domains versus the expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) questionnaire urinary (U), bowel (B), hormonal (H), and S subscales.  Methods and materials:   A single-institution cross-sectional PCRT patient cohort was surveyed. Descriptive and intra- and inter-class correlation coefficient statistics for the various EPIC and PCRT HRQoL domain scores were generated. Univariable and multivariable Cox and logistic regressions were performed depending on the HRQoL endpoint being assessed.  Results:   A total of 189/276 patients (68%) completed questionnaires with EPIC and PCRT missing data rates of 9% and 4%, respectively. Mean age was 75.8 years (SD 5.5) and the mean time of questionnaire completion after radiotherapy was 852 days (range 212-1454 days). Mean EPIC urinary (85.1 SD 12.9), bowel (84.1 SD 15.8), sexual (21.8 SD 20.7), and hormonal (85.3 SD 13.7) as well as PCRT genitourinary (66.1 SD 15.3), gastrointestinal (83.6 SD 14.3), and sexual (39.4 SD 21.6) domain scores were calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficients comparing corresponding EPIC/PCRT domains ranged from 0.50-0.88. Interclass correlation coefficients for non-corresponding EPIC/PCRT domains ranged from 0.16-0.43 and 0.23-0.30, respectively. EPIC B/U, PCRT GI/GU and PCRT S required arcsin square root transformation and EPIC S/H domains required dichotomous transformations prior to univariable/multivariable analyses. Multivariable analysis demonstrated novel associations between predictive variables and HRQoL domains including between the PTV-bladder overlap volume and PCRT GU score.  Conclusions:   The PCRT is a compact, valid, and HRQoL instrument with very high questionnaire compliance rates and similar statistical properties to the EPIC instrument. However, dichotomization of the PRCT S data was not required which suggests some potential statistical advantage to the PCRT.""","""['George Rodrigues', 'Glenn Bauman', 'Varagur Venkatesan', 'Belal Ahmad', 'Michael Lock', 'Tracy Sexton', ""David D'Souza"", 'Larry Stitt', 'Somaya Eid']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Cross-sectional survey of long-term quality of life after radical perineal prostatectomy.', 'Quality of life after whole pelvic versus prostate-only external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a matched-pair comparison.', 'Acute and late complications after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: results of a multicenter randomized trial comparing 68 Gy to 78 Gy.', 'A systematic review of expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) quality of life after surgery or radiation treatment.', 'Measuring symptoms in localized prostate cancer: a systematic review of assessment instruments.', 'Health-related quality of life and rates of toxicity after high-dose-rate brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Quality of Life after post-prostatectomy intensity modulated radiation therapy to the prostate bed with or without the use of gold fiducial markers for image guidance or higher total radiotherapy doses.', 'Quality of life after high-dose-rate brachytherapy monotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   In all, 101 men on active surveillance for prostate cancer underwent restaging transperineal template prostate biopsies at a single centre. Criteria for active surveillance were ≤75 years, Gleason ≤3+3, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤15 ng/mL, clinical stage T1-2a and ≤50% ultrasound-guided transrectal biopsy cores positive for cancer with ≤10 mm of disease in a single core.

Results:   In all, 34% of men had more significant prostate cancer on restaging transperineal template biopsies compared with their transrectal biopsies. Of these men, 44% had disease predominantly in the anterior part of the gland, an area often under-sampled by transrectal biopsies.

Our previous studies have shown that decursin and isomer decursinol angelate (DA), isolated from the Korean medicinal herb Angelica gigas Nakai, interrupt AR signaling and possess anti-PCa activities in vitro. In the LNCaP PCa cell model, these pyranoccoumarin compounds exhibit properties distinct from currently used antagonists (e.g., Casodex). However, both are rapidly de-esterified to decursinol, a partial AR agonist. We report here that a synthetic decursin analog, decursinol phenylthiocarbamate (DPTC), has greater in vivo stability than the parent compounds. DPTC-decursinol conversion was undetectable in mice. Furthermore, in LNCaP cells, DPTC decreased prostate specific antigen (PSA) expression, down-regulated AR abundance and mRNA and inhibited AR nuclear translocation. The effect of DPTC on AR and PSA mRNA and protein abundance was also observed in VCaP cells expressing wild type AR. DPTC inhibited growth of both PCa cell lines through G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as did decursin and DA. Furthermore, i.p. administration of DPTC for 3 weeks suppressed the expression of AR target genes probasin and Nkx3.1 in mouse prostate glands.

One important mechanism mediating this AR reactivation is intratumoral conversion of the weak adrenal androgens DHEA and androstenedione into the AR ligands testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. DHEA and androstenedione are synthesized by the adrenals through the sequential actions of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP11A1 and CYP17A1, so that CYP17A1 inhibitors such as abiraterone are effective therapies for CRPC. However, the significance of intratumoral CYP17A1 and de novo androgen synthesis from cholesterol in CRPC, and the mechanisms contributing to CYP17A1 inhibitor resistance/relapse, remain to be determined. We report that AR activity in castration-resistant VCaP tumor xenografts can be restored through CYP17A1-dependent de novo androgen synthesis, and that abiraterone treatment of these xenografts imposes selective pressure for increased intratumoral expression of CYP17A1, thereby generating a mechanism for development of resistance to CYP17A1 inhibitors. Supporting the clinical relevance of this mechanism, we found that intratumoral expression of CYP17A1 was markedly increased in tumor biopsies from CRPC patients after CYP17A1 inhibitor therapy. We further show that CRPC cells expressing a progesterone responsive T877A mutant AR are not CYP17A1 dependent, but that AR activity in these cells is still steroid dependent and mediated by upstream CYP11A1-dependent intraturmoral pregnenolone/progesterone synthesis. Together, our results indicate that CRPCs resistant to CYP17A1 inhibition may remain steroid dependent and therefore responsive to therapies that can further suppress de novo intratumoral steroid synthesis.""","""['Changmeng Cai', 'Sen Chen', 'Patrick Ng', 'Glenn J Bubley', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Brett Marck', 'Alvin M Matsumoto', 'Nicholas I Simon', 'Hongyun Wang', 'Shaoyong Chen', 'Steven P Balk']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['A bypass mechanism of abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer: Accumulating CYP17A1 substrates activate androgen receptor signaling.', 'Resistance to CYP17A1 inhibition with abiraterone in castration-resistant prostate cancer: induction of steroidogenesis and androgen receptor splice variants.', 'Abiraterone switches castration-resistant prostate cancer dependency from adrenal androgens towards androgen receptor variants and glucocorticoid receptor signalling.', 'Intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in prostate cancer pathogenesis and response to therapy.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Histone H2A Lys130 acetylation epigenetically regulates androgen production in prostate cancer.', 'Non-steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors: Discovery and Assessment.', 'M6A-modified circRBM33 promotes prostate cancer progression via PDHA1-mediated mitochondrial respiration regulation and presents a potential target for ARSI therapy.', 'Antiandrogen-Equipped Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Selectively Inhibit Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR-Splice Variant (AR-SV) in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.']"""

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the survival rate, and Cox regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic parameters.  Results:   Altogether, 84 neoplasms in 70 patients were observed. A total of 54 were nonhepatic (15.3%) mainly colorectal carcinoma, prostate cancer and tobacco-related neoplasms. TNM stage was the best prognostic parameter (p<0.0001). Low bilirubin (p=0.01), normal albumin (p=0.005) and absence of ascites (p<0.0001) were also related significantly to longer survival. The rate of postinterventional death after specific treatment was high. A proportion of patients received no specific therapy due to reduced physical performance, even in cases of limited disease.  Conclusion:   Our data confirm the increased risk of cirrhotic patients for developing nonhepatic cancer. Advanced TNM stage was associated with reduced long-term survival. Scoring systems, such as Child's classification and Model of Elevated Liver Disease (MELD) score, were suitable parameters to predict mortality. Oncological management in patients with cirrhosis must be on an individual basis, independent from TNM classification.""","""['Felix Gundling', 'Holger Seidl', 'Fabian Schmidtler', 'Nicola Löffler', 'Ingrid Strassen', 'Petra Wolf', 'Christian Pehl', 'Thomas Schmidt', 'Wolfgang Schepp']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Colorectal adenocarcinoma in cirrhotic patients.', 'Limitation of the model for end-stage liver disease for outcome prediction in patients with cirrhosis-related complications.', 'The 1-year and 3-month prognostic utility of the AST/ALT ratio and model for end-stage liver disease score in patients with viral liver cirrhosis.', '259 Patients with DCIS of the breast applying USC/Van Nuys prognostic index: a retrospective review with long term follow up.', 'Prognostic factors of hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis: univariate and multivariate analysis.', 'Management of Patients with Liver Cirrhosis and Invasive Bladder Cancer: A Case-series.', 'Factors affecting the postoperative morbidity and survival of patients with liver cirrhosis following colorectal cancer surgery.', 'Urological aspects in patients with liver cirrhosis.', 'Development of second primary malignancy in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Comorbidity in cirrhosis.']"""

DNA methylation results in the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to promoter regions, thereby repressing expression of genes. General inhibitors of class I and II HDACs (HDACi), such as sodium butyrate and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, suppress the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of re-expression of silenced cell cycle inhibitors and retinoic acid receptor B2 (RARB2). HDACi inhibited cell cycle progression, and reversed promoter methylation and silencing of three tumor suppressor genes: RARB2 and the cell cycle regulating cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16 and p21. HDACi repressed MAP kinase I (ERK) activation and down-regulated DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) levels. Direct inhibition of ERK activity similarly decreased DNMT1 protein levels and reversed the basal hypermethylation of the promoters and silencing of the RARB2, p21 and p16 tumor suppressor genes. Suppression of DNMT1 level by siRNA also reversed methylation of these tumor suppressor genes with similar kinetics. Collectively, these data demonstrate that HDACi, by inhibiting ERK activity, regulate DNMT1 and ultimately DNA methylation. These results demonstrate that HDACs regulate gene methylation, in addition to the established and reciprocal ability of CpG methylation to recruit HDACs to repress transcription.""","""['Sibaji Sarkar', 'Ana L Abujamra', 'Jenny E Loew', 'Lora W Forman', 'Susan P Perrine', 'Douglas V Faller']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['DNMT1 is required to maintain CpG methylation and aberrant gene silencing in human cancer cells.', 'Dual action on promoter demethylation and chromatin by an isothiocyanate restored GSTP1 silenced in prostate cancer.', 'Methylation silencing of the Apaf-1 gene in acute leukemia.', 'Analysis of methylation pattern in multiple myeloma.', 'Epigenetic cancer therapies: DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.', 'Brain Tumors: Development, Drug Resistance, and Sensitization - An Epigenetic Approach.', 'Effects of the loss of maternal gut microbiota before pregnancy on gut microbiota, food allergy susceptibility, and epigenetic modification on subsequent generations.', 'Combinatorial quantification of 5mC and 5hmC at individual CpG dyads and the transcriptome in single cells reveals modulators of DNA methylation maintenance fidelity.', 'PGC7 Regulates Genome-Wide DNA Methylation by Regulating ERK-Mediated Subcellular Localization of DNMT1.', 'Cross-reactivity between histone demethylase inhibitor valproic acid and DNA methylation in glioblastoma cell lines.']"""

Methods and materials:   Fifteen patients were treated in our institution with combination (131)Cs brachytherapy followed by pelvic external beam radiation therapy for intermediate to high-risk prostate cancers. For all patients, CT scans were scheduled at 7 days (CT(7)) and again at 2 months for external beam radiation therapy simulation purpose (CT(60)) postseed implantation. Comprehensive postseed implant dosimetry was performed for both CT(7) and CT(60) scans. In each case, dose-volume histogram parameters, rectal separation (the distance between the center of posterior most seed and most anterior rectal wall), and posterior row activity (the total activity implanted within 2-4mm anterior to the posterior wall of the prostate) data were collected. The absolute rectal volumes receiving 100% and 110% prescription dose were also collected.  Results:   Rectal dose correlated strongly with rectal separation (p<0.001). The mean change in rectal separation between CT(7) and CT(60) scans was 1.1 (±1.7) mm, and the corresponding change in 0.1-cc rectal dose was 18 (±26.5) Gy. Posterior row activity did not correlate with rectal dose (p=0.51).

Methods:   PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP cells were treated with RAD001, AEE788 or VPA or with a RAD-AEE-VPA combination. Tumor cell growth, cell cycle progression and cell cycle regulating proteins were then investigated by MTT-assay, flow cytometry and western blotting, respectively. Furthermore, tumor cell adhesion to vascular endothelium or to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins as well as migratory properties of the cells was evaluated, and integrin α and β subtypes were analyzed. Finally, effects of drug treatment on cell signaling pathways were determined.  Results:   All drugs, separately applied, reduced tumor cell adhesion, migration and growth. A much stronger anti-cancer effect was evoked by the triple drug combination. Particularly, cdk1, 2 and 4 and cyclin B were reduced, whereas p27 was elevated. In addition, simultaneous application of RAD001, AEE788 and VPA altered the membranous, cytoplasmic and gene expression pattern of various integrin α and β subtypes, reduced integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and deactivated focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Signaling analysis revealed that EGFr and the downstream target Akt, as well as p70S6k was distinctly modified in the presence of the drug combination.  Conclusions:   Simultaneous targeting of several key proteins in prostate cancer cells provides an advantage over targeting a single pathway.

Tumor suppressor protein p53 is a master regulator of cell cycle progression and is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers. p53 was increased in SEPW1 silenced cells and was inversely correlated with SEPW1 mRNA in cell lines with altered SEPW1 expression. Silencing SEPW1 decreased ubiquitination of p53 and increased p53 half-life. SEPW1 silencing increased p21(Cip1/WAF1/CDKN1A), while p27 (Kip1/CDKN1B) levels were unaffected. G1-phase arrest from SEPW1 knockdown was abolished by silencing p53 or p21. Cell cycle arrest from SEPW1 silencing was not associated with activation of ATM or phosphorylation of Ser-15 in p53, suggesting the DNA damage response pathway was not involved. Silencing GPX1 had no effect on cell cycle, suggesting that G1-phase arrest from SEPW1 silencing was not due to loss of antioxidant protection. More research is required to identify the function of SEPW1 and how it affects stability of p53.""","""['Wayne Chris Hawkes', 'Ignat Printsev', 'Zeynep Alkan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Delayed cell cycle progression from SEPW1 depletion is p53- and p21-dependent in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.', 'Delayed cell cycle progression in selenoprotein W-depleted cells is regulated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4-p38/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-p53 pathway.', 'LYG-202 inhibits the proliferation of human colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 cells through induction of G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via p53 and p21(WAF1/Cip1) expression.', 'Selenoproteins in bladder cancer.', 'The roles of p53R2 in cancer progression based on the new function of mutant p53 and cytoplasmic p21.', 'Circulating non-coding RNAs as a diagnostic and management biomarker for breast cancer: current insights.', 'Breast Cancer and the Other Non-Coding RNAs.', 'The Biogenesis and Functions of piRNAs in Human Diseases.', 'PIWI-interacting RNA-36712 restrains breast cancer progression and chemoresistance by interaction with SEPW1 pseudogene SEPW1P RNA.', 'Accessing human selenoproteins through chemical protein synthesis.']"""

Further study using HeLa cells indicated that the vacuoles induced by celastrol might be derived from dilation of endoplasmic reticulum. And, in celastrol-treated cells, markers of autophagy such as transformation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)I to LC3II and LC3 punctates formation were identified. Interestingly, autophagy inhibitors could not interrupt but enhance the induction of cytoplasmic vacuolization. Furthermore, MAPK pathways were activated by celastrol and inhibitors of MEK and p38 pathways could prevent the formation of cytoplasmic vacuolization. Celastrol treatment also induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HeLa cells. In conclusion, celastrol induced a kind of paraptosis accompanied by autophagy and apoptosis in cancer cells. The coincidence of apoptosis and autophagy together with paraptosis might contribute to the unique characteristics of paraptosis in celastrol-treated cells such as the dependence of paraptosis on MAPK pathways and dynamic change of LC3 proteins. Both paraptosis and apoptosis could contribute to the cell death induced by celastrol while autophagy might serve as a kind of survival mechanism. The potency of celastrol to induce paraptosis, apoptosis and autophagy at the same dose might be related to its capability to affect a variety of pathways including proteasome, ER stress and Hsp90.""","""['Wen-Bo Wang', 'Li-Xing Feng', 'Qing-Xi Yue', 'Wan-Ying Wu', 'Shu-Hong Guan', 'Bao-Hong Jiang', 'Min Yang', 'Xuan Liu', 'De-An Guo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Autophagy in the pharmacological activities of celastrol (Review).', 'Taxol induces paraptosis independent of both protein synthesis and MAPK pathway.', 'Cycloheximide promotes paraptosis induced by inhibition of cyclophilins in glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Honokiol induces paraptosis-like cell death of acute promyelocytic leukemia via mTOR & MAPK signaling pathways activation.', 'Small-molecule compounds target paraptosis to improve cancer therapy.', 'Different Ways to Die: Cell Death Pathways and Their Association With Spinal Cord Injury.', 'Paraptosis: a unique cell death mode for targeting cancer.', 'ORP5 promotes migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'Autophagy in the pharmacological activities of celastrol (Review).', 'Surveying the landscape of emerging and understudied cell death mechanisms.']"""

Acrylamide intake ranged from a mean of 10.5 mcg/day in the lowest quintile to 40.1 mcg/day in the highest quintile; coffee and potato products were largest contributors to intake. The multivariate-adjusted relative risk of prostate cancer was 1.02 (95% confidence interval: 0.92-1.13) for the highest versus lowest quintile of acrylamide intake (p-value for trend = 0.90). Results were similar when restricted to never smokers and to men who had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests. There was no significant association for dietary acrylamide and risk of lethal, advanced or high-grade disease, or for different latency periods ranging from 0-4 years to 12-16 years.

Induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is particularly important for the invasiveness of various cancer cells. Celastrol, a triterpenoid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine, is known to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells, including leukemia, glioma, prostate and breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of celastrol on the migration and invasion of human breast carcinoma cells.  Results:   We observed that celastrol suppressed phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced invasion and migration of MCF-7 cells. We also found that celastrol inhibited PMA-induced MMP-9 expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels, and the proteolytic activity of MMP-9 in MCF-7 cells. Our results revealed that celastrol inhibited the transcriptional activity of MMP-9 by suppression of the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in the MMP-9 promoter, and inhibited degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB.

Methods and materials:   In the period March 2005-April 2009, 178 patients were treated with radical or adjuvant/salvage intent with WPRT Tomotherapy. Median dose to the pelvic nodes was 51.8 Gy/28 fractions while concomitantly delivering 65.5-74.2 Gy to prostate/prostatic bed. The impact of many anatomical and clinical parameters on ≥ Grade 2 acute bowel toxicity was investigated by logistic analyses.  Results:   Only 15/178 patients (8.4%) experienced Grade 2 toxicity (none Grade 3). Main predictors at univariate analysis were nodal CTV (CTVN ≥ 380 cc; OR: 3.7, p=0.017), treatment duration (< 40 days; OR: 6.2, p=0.006) and Grade 2 acute rectal toxicity (OR: 6.5, p=0.015). A multivariate analysis including only pre-treatment variables revealed an independent role of CTVN and age; if including treatment-related factors the best predictors were age, treatment duration and Grade 2 rectal toxicity. This last was correlated with the overlap between PTVN and loops (OVPN ≥ 51 cc; OR: 14.4, p=0.0003) that is representative of the volume of loops receiving the prescribed dose (51.8 Gy, 1.85 Gy/fr).  Conclusions:   Acute bowel toxicity after WPRT Tomotherapy is mild, relatively rare and associated to larger CTVN and older age. While efforts to further reduce it do not appear to be relevant, the pre-treatment assessment of ""high-risk"" patients may help physicians in better managing symptoms.

Previous studies show that BA induces proteasome-dependent degradation of specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in prostate cancer cells and this study focused on the mechanism of action of BA in colon cancer cells.  Methods:   The effects of BA on colon cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis and tumor growth in vivo were determined using standardized assays. The effects of BA on Sp proteins and Sp-regulated gene products were analyzed by western blots, and real time PCR was used to determine microRNA-27a (miR-27a) and ZBTB10 mRNA expression.  Results:   BA inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in RKO and SW480 colon cancer cells and inhibited tumor growth in athymic nude mice bearing RKO cells as xenograft. BA also decreased expression of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 transcription factors which are overexpressed in colon cancer cells and decreased levels of several Sp-regulated genes including survivin, vascular endothelial growth factor, p65 sub-unit of NFκB, epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin D1, and pituitary tumor transforming gene-1. The mechanism of action of BA was dependent on cell context, since BA induced proteasome-dependent and proteasome-independent downregulation of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in SW480 and RKO cells, respectively. In RKO cells, the mechanism of BA-induced repression of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 was due to induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ROS-mediated repression of microRNA-27a, and induction of the Sp repressor gene ZBTB10.

Citrulline concentrations are known to decrease with intestinal failure. We thus evaluated the feasibility of plasma citrulline levels in predicting radiation-induced intestinal toxicity.  Material and methods:   Fifty-three patients (36 prostate cancer, 17 endometrial cancer) who received 45 Gy pelvic RT using conventional fractionation were prospectively evaluated. Patients with prostate cancer received an additional 25-30.6 Gy conformal boost. Plasma citrulline levels were assessed on day 0, mid- (week 3) and post-RT (week 8), and four months post-RT. Dose-volume histogram, citrulline concentration changes, and weekly intestinal toxicity scores were analyzed.  Results:   Mean age was 63 years (range: 43-81 years) and mean baseline citrulline concentration was 38.0 ± 10.1 μmol/l. Citrulline concentrations were significantly reduced at week 3 (27.4 ± 5.9 μmol/l; p < 0.0001), treatment end (29.9 ± 8.8 μmol/l; p < 0.0001), and four months post-treatment (34.3 ± 12.1; p = 0.01). The following factor pairs were significantly positively correlated: Citrulline concentration/mean bowel dose during, end of treatment, and four months post-RT; dose-volume parameters/citrulline change groups; cumulative mean radiation dose/intestinal toxicity at end and four months post-RT; citrulline changes/intestinal toxicity during and end of RT. Citrulline concentration changes significantly differed during treatment according to RTOG intestinal toxicity grades (p < 0.0001). Although the citrulline changes differed significantly within RTOG intestinal toxicity grades (p = 0.003), the difference between Grade 0 and Grade 1 did not differ significantly at the end of the treatment. At four months after RT, no significant differences were apparent.

The extensive usage of cytotoxic nucleobases and nucleoside analogues in chemotherapy also results in the development of specific mechanisms of drug resistance, such as nucleoside transport or activation deficiencies. These drugs are prodrugs; and being converted into the active mono-, di-, and triphosphates inside cancer cells following administration, they affect nucleic acid synthesis, nucleotide metabolism, or sensitivity to apoptosis. Previously, we actively promoted the idea that the nanodelivery of active nucleotide species, e.g., 5'-triphosphates of nucleoside analogues, can enhance drug efficacy and reduce nonspecific toxicity. In this study, we report the development of a novel type of drug nanoformulations, polymeric conjugates of nucleoside analogues, which are capable of the efficient transport and sustained release of phosphorylated drugs. These drug conjugates have been synthesized, starting from cholesterol-modified mucoadhesive polyvinyl alcohol or biodegradable dextrin, by covalent attachment of nucleoside analogues through a tetraphosphate linker. Association of cholesterol moieties in aqueous media resulted in intramolecular polymer folding and the formation of small nanogel particles containing 0.5 mmol/g of a 5'-phosphorylated nucleoside analogue, e.g., 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (floxuridine, FdU), an active metabolite of anticancer drug 5-fluorouracyl (5-FU). The polymeric conjugates demonstrated rapid enzymatic release of floxuridine 5'-phosphate and much slower drug release under hydrolytic conditions (pH 1.0-7.4). Among the panel of cancer cell lines, all studied polymeric FdU-conjugates demonstrated an up to 50× increased cytotoxicity in human prostate cancer PC-3, breast cancer MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cells, and more than 100× higher efficacy against cytarabine-resistant human T-lymphoma (CEM/araC/8) and gemcitabine-resistant follicular lymphoma (RL7/G) cells as compared to free drugs. In the initial in vivo screening, both PC-3 and RL7/G subcutaneous tumor xenograft models showed enhanced sensitivity to sustained drug release from polymeric FdU-conjugate after peritumoral injections and significant tumor growth inhibition. All these data demonstrate a remarkable clinical potential of novel polymeric conjugates of phosphorylated nucleoside analogues, especially as new therapeutic agents against drug-resistant tumors.""","""['Thulani H Senanayake', 'Galya Warren', 'Serguei V Vinogradov']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Application of activated nucleoside analogs for the treatment of drug-resistant tumors by oral delivery of nanogel-drug conjugates.', 'Efficient overcoming of drug resistance to anticancer nucleoside analogs by nanodelivery of active phosphorylated drugs.', ""Synthesis and biological evaluation of butanoate, retinoate, and bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)phosphate derivatives of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine and 2',5-difluoro-2'-deoxyuridine as potential dual action anticancer prodrugs."", 'Polymeric nanogels containing the triphosphate form of cytotoxic nucleoside analogues show antitumor activity against breast and colorectal cancer cell lines.', 'Cytotoxic nucleoside analogues: different strategies to improve their clinical efficacy.', 'Exploring Carbohydrates for Therapeutics: A Review on Future Directions.', 'Self-assembling prodrugs.', 'Sustaining Intravitreal Residence With L-Arginine Peptide-Conjugated Nanocarriers.', 'Chloroquine-Modified Hydroxyethyl Starch as a Polymeric Drug for Cancer Therapy.', 'Nanogel-Conjugated Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors and Their Combinations as Novel Antiviral Agents with Increased Efficacy against HIV-1 Infection.']"""

Patients and methods:   This single-center, retrospective study included 205 men who underwent an initial 14-core TRUS-guided pBx due to PSA > 3.0 ng/ml or suspicious digital-rectal examination (DRE). PCA3 scores were measured with the Progensa assay. Linear regression models were fit to identify factors that impact PCA3 score and to determine age-specific reference values. Predictive accuracies of logistic regression models predicting presence of prostate cancer (PCa) were analyzed.  Results:   The positive biopsy rate was 37%. In multivariable linear regression, age (P < 0.001), presence of PCa (P < 0.001), and multifocal HG-PIN (P = 0.012) were independent predictors of PCA3 score. Age showed the strongest impact on PCA3 score (T = 4.77). The upper 95% confidence interval of PCA3 score in each age category was defined as the age-specific limit. A PCA3-score over the age-specific limit (PCA3-age) was associated with an 4.17-fold increased odds of being diagnosed with PCa (P < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression models predicting the presence of PCa, predictive accuracy of a base model (age, DRE, PSA, volume) increased from 69.6 to 75.4% (P = 0.037) by adding the continuous PCA3 score, to 73.9% (P = 0.098) with the 35 cutoff (PCA3-35) and to 77.1% (P = 0.008) with PCA3-age.  Conclusions:   PCA3 score increases with age, independent of PCa presence. Age-specific PCA3 score reference values are superior to PSA, continuous PCA3 score, and PCA3-35 in predicting initial pBx outcome.

Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess social and clinical influences on treatment decision.  Results:   A total of 435 men were evaluated. Men of both races who chose surgery (versus radiation) were more likely to be influenced by their physician and by family/friends. Black men who chose surgery also were ~5 times more likely to make independent decisions (i.e., rather than be influenced by their doctor). White men who chose surgery were twice as likely to be influenced by the desire for cure and less likely to consider the side effects of impotence (odds ratio (OR) = 0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18, 0.88) and incontinence (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.63); by contrast, there was a suggestion of an opposite effect in black men, whose decision regarding surgery tended to be more strongly influenced by these side effects.

The MSP/RON system promotes wound healing and invasive tumor growth and suppresses proinflammatory immune response. MSP binding to RON requires proteolytic conversion of the inactive single-chain form (pro-MSP) into the disulfide-linked α/β heterodimer. The pro-MSP cleavage sequence (Ser-Lys-Leu-Arg(483)↓Val(484)) closely matches the substrate recognition sequences of hepsin, a type II transmembrane serine protease, that is overexpressed in several cancers. Here, we show that recombinant hepsin cleaves pro-MSP at the consensus site Arg(483)-Val(484) with superior efficiency compared with the known activators MT-SP1 and hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA). At least 50% of pro-MSP was processed within 1 hour at a hepsin concentration of 2.4 nmol/L and at a molar enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:500. An uncleavable single-chain variant of MSP weakly bound to a RON-Fc fusion protein, whereas hepsin-cleaved MSP bound with a K(D) of 10.3 nmol/L, suggesting that the high-affinity binding site in MSP β-chain was properly formed. LNCaP prostate cancer cells overexpressing hepsin on the cell surface efficiently activated pro-MSP, which was blocked by a specific anti-hepsin antibody. Incubation of pro-MSP with hepsin led to robust RON-mediated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, ribosomal S6 protein, and Akt in human A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells stably expressing RON protein. In macrophages, pro-MSP with hepsin induced chemotaxis and attenuated lipopolysaccharide-dependent production of nitric oxide. These findings suggest that the MSP/RON signaling pathway may be regulated by hepsin in tissue homeostasis and in disease pathologies, such as in cancer and immune disorders.""","""['Rajkumar Ganesan', 'Ganesh A Kolumam', 'S Jack Lin', 'Ming-Hong Xie', 'Lydia Santell', 'Thomas D Wu', 'Robert A Lazarus', 'Amitabha Chaudhuri', 'Daniel Kirchhofer']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Hepatocyte growth factor activator is a serum activator of single-chain precursor macrophage-stimulating protein.', 'Macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) binds to its receptor via the MSP beta chain.', 'Plasma macrophage-stimulating protein and hepatocyte growth factor levels are associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Biological aspects of macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) and its receptor.', 'Oncogenic and invasive potentials of human macrophage-stimulating protein receptor, the RON receptor tyrosine kinase.', 'A network map of macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) signaling.', 'Clinical Significance of Hepsin and Underlying Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'The POR rs10954732 polymorphism decreases susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma and hepsin as a prognostic biomarker correlated with immune infiltration based on proteomics.', 'Hepsin regulates TGFβ signaling via fibronectin proteolysis.', 'Piperidine carbamate peptidomimetic inhibitors of the serine proteases HGFA, matriptase and hepsin.']"""

Methods:   The expression of cell surface HSP90 on PC3 cells was studied by immunofluorescence staining and surface biotinylation assay respectively. A specific HSP90 antibody was used to inhibit the cell surface HSP90. In vitro cell invasion was assessed by modified Boyden chambers. Phosphorylated FAK on tyr 397, 576, 577 and 925, and phosphorylated c-Src on tyr 416 were examined by Western blot assay. The association between FAK and c-Src was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. The effects of FAK knockdown by siRNA or Src kinases inhibitor PP2, with or without anti-HSP90 antibody, on PC3 cell invasion were also evaluated.  Results:   A pool of HSP90 was detected on the cell surface of PC3 cells. A specific HSP90 antibody significantly retarded tumor cell invasion. Concomitant with this finding, targeting cell surface HSP90 significantly inhibited the phosphorylations of FAK and c-Src, and also the interactions between FAK and c-Src. FAK knockdown or PP2 dramatically suppressed cell invasion, however, anti-HSP90 antibody didn't further inhibit cell invasion.

One of the many problems is that the virus infects many different cell types in the body, resulting in high toxicity, whereas the target cancer cells are often less prone to wild-type Ad infection. Our aim was to develop genetically de- and retargeted Ad vectors to reduce off-target effects and increase target infection for prostate cancer. We have previously reported an Ad5 vector specific for the cancer-associated receptor Her2/neu, created by inserting Her2/neu-reactive Affibody(®) molecules (ZH) into the HI loop of a coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor binding-ablated fiber (Ad[ZH/1]). In addition to virus retargeting to Her2/neu, this virus was further modified from wild-type Ad by changing the RGD motif in the penton base to EGD and by substitution of the KKTK motif in the third shaft repeat to RKSK, resulting in the vector Ad[ZH/3]. The ZH-containing vectors could be produced to high titers and were specific for their target, resulting in efficient infection and killing of Her2/neu-positive androgen-dependent PC346C prostate cancer cells in vitro. Here we show that the oncolytic Ad[ZH/3] vector significantly prolonged survival time and reduced serum prostate-specific antigen levels in an orthotopic prostate tumor model in nude mice to the same extent as wild-type Ad5.

In this study, four Y-linked short tandem repeats (STRs), DYS388, DYS435, DYS437, and DYS439, were genotyped to compare Malaysian prostate cancer patients and normal control males.  Materials and methods:   A total of 175 subjects comprising 84 patients and 91 healthy individuals were recruited. Multiplex PCR was optimized to co-amplify DYS388, DYS435, DYS437, and DYS439 loci. All samples were genotyped for alleles of four DYS loci using a Genetic Analysis System.  Results:   Of all DYS loci, allele 10 (A) of DYS388 had a significantly lower incidence of disease in compare with other alleles of this locus, while a higher incidence of disease was found among males who had either allele 12 (C) of DYS388 or allele 14 (E) of DYS439.

Objective:   We examined the cost effectiveness of dutasteride compared with placebo in preventing PCa in men at increased risk as seen in REDUCE, from a US payer perspective.  Methods:   A Markov model was developed to compare costs and outcomes of chemoprevention with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day or placebo with usual care in men aged 50-75 years, with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 2.5-10 ng/mL (men aged <60 years) or 3.0-10 ng/mL (men aged ≥60 years), and with a single negative prostate biopsy in the prior 6 months. The model simulated the REDUCE cohort annually through different health states over 4-, 10-year and lifetime time horizons. Risks of PCa for men receiving placebo and dutasteride were obtained from REDUCE. Rates of acute urinary retention events and benign prostate hyperplasia-related surgeries also came from REDUCE. Costs and utilities were obtained from published literature. All costs are reported in $US, year 2009 values.  Results:   The model indicated that, over 10 years, dutasteride patients would experience fewer PCas (251 vs 312 per 1000 patients) at increased cost ($US15 341 vs $US12 316) than placebo patients. Although life-years were not substantially affected, the model calculated an increase in QALYs of 0.14 for dutasteride patients. Chemoprevention with dutasteride appeared to be cost effective, with an incremental cost per QALY of $US21 781 and cost per PCa avoided of $US50 254. The 4-year and lifetime incremental costs per QALY were $US18 409 and $US22 498, respectively.

MMP activities are regulated by specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). A nutrient mixture (NM) containing lysine, proline, ascorbic acid and green tea extract showed anticancer activity against a number of cancer cell lines. Our main objective was to study the effect of NM on the activity of u-PA, MMPs and their inhibitor TIMPs on human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145. Human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145 (ATCC) were grown in MEM media with 10% FBS and antibiotics in 24‑well tissue culture plates. At near confluence, the cells were treated with NM at 0-1000 µg/ml in triplicate at each concentration. Analysis of u-PA activity was carried out by fibrin zymography, MMPs by gelatinase zymography and TIMPs by reverse zymography. Both PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated u-PA activity (subunits 1 and 2, corresponding to 35 and 33 kDa). Prostate cancer cell line PC-3 secretion of u-PA subunit 1 was decreased by 65% at NM 500 µg/ml and subunit 2 by 100% at NM 50 µg/ml. Prostate cancer cell line DU-145 secretion of u-PA subunit 1 was decreased by 97% at NM 500 µg/ml and subunit 2 by 100% at NM 100 µg/ml. Untreated PC-3 showed two bands for MMP-2 and MMP-9. NM inhibited their expression in a dose-dependent manner. The activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly inhibited at 250 µg/ml with total inhibition at 500 µg/ml. DU-145 cells did not exhibit MMP activity. Activity of TIMPs was up-regulated in both prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Minimum activity was expressed at 50 µg/ml NM and maximum at 1000 µg/ml. Correlation analyses revealed a positive correlation between u-PA and MMPs and a negative correlation between u-PA/MMPs and TIMPs.

Materials and methods:   Between 1993 and 2003, 370 patients entered the study; 330/370 (STD: 179; HFX: 151) were evaluable for current analysis. Median doses were 79.2 Gy and 74 Gy for HFX (1.2 Gy/fr, two daily fractions) and STD (2 Gy/fr), respectively; median follow-up was 7.5 yr. The two regimens were compared in terms of biochemical relapse-free survival (according to ASTRO definition, bRFS) by univariate (log-rank test) and multivariate analyses (Cox regression hazard model). Based on published relationships between EQD2 and 5-yr biochemical control, α/β values for each subgroup could be estimated.  Results:   7.5 yr bRFS were 53.4% (± 4.4%, 95% CI) and 65.4% (± 4.0%) for HFX and STD, respectively (p=0.13); HFX was associated with a poorer outcome in NCCN low+intermediate patients (7.5 yr bRFS: 56.6% vs 73.5%, p=0.048) while no differences were seen for high-risk patients (7.5 yr bRFS: 44.1% vs 45.3%). Multivariate analysis revealed that NCCN risk grouping (high vs low+intermediate; OR: 0.59, p=0.009) and age (< vs ≥ 70 yr; OR: 0.67, p=0.03) were the main predictors of worse bRFS. In the subgroups of low+intermediate-risk patients < 70 yr, the poorer outcome of HFX was more evident (7.5 yr bRFS: 47.1% vs 70.9%, p=0.078) while no difference was seen for older patients (7.5 yr bRFS: 69.4% vs 72.0%, p=0.76). Our α/β estimates differ between low+intermediate-risk and high-risk patients.  Conclusions:   The bRFS long-term results of this non-randomized trial are consistent with different sensitivities to fractionation depending on NCCN risk grouping. The impact of age on the outcome of HFX for younger low+intermediate patients is consistent with an incomplete repair effect in older patients.""","""['Riccardo Valdagni', 'Alan E Nahum', 'Tiziana Magnani', 'Corrado Italia', 'Angelo Lanceni', 'Paolo Montanaro', 'Tiziana Rancati', 'Barbara Avuzzi', 'Claudio Fiorino']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Is the alpha-beta ratio of prostate cancer really low?

It was found that PPP2R2A was commonly (67.1%) deleted in tumor samples, including a homozygous deletion in three tumors (2.1%). We performed a mutation screen for PPP2R2A in 96 probands of hereditary prostate cancer families. No high risk mutations were identified. In addition, we re-analyzed 10 SNPs of PPP2R2A in sporadic PCa cases and controls.

However there are compelling reasons why 25(OH)D should preferably exceed 75 nmol/L: (A) Scrutiny of actual data specified by the IOM relating 25(OH)D to bone density and osteomalacia shows the desirable minimum 25(OH)D to be 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL). (B) Humans are primates, optimized through evolution to inhabit tropical latitudes, with serum 25(OH)D over 100 nmol/L. (C) Epidemiologic relationships show health benefits if 25(OH)D levels exceed 70 nmol/L; these include fewer falls, better tooth attachment, less colorectal cancer, improved depression and wellbeing. Some studies of populations at high-latitude relate higher 25(OH)D to risk of prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer or mortality. Those relationships are attributable to the dynamic fluctuations in 25(OH)D specific to high latitudes, and which can be corrected by maintaining 25(OH)D at steady, high levels throughout the year, the way they are in the tropics. (D) There are now many clinical trials that show benefits and/or no adversity with doses of vitamin D that raise serum 25(OH)D to levels beyond 75 nmol/L. Together, the evidence makes it very unlikely that further research will change the conclusion that risk of disease with serum 25(OH)D higher than 75 nmol/L is lower than the risk of disease if the serum 25(OH)D is approximately 53 nmol/L.""","""['Reinhold Vieth']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['Vitamin D status of Irish adults: findings from the National Adult Nutrition Survey.', 'Determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in Finnish children: the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC) study.', 'Insufficient autumn vitamin D intake and low vitamin D status in 7-year-old Icelandic children.', 'An estimate of the economic burden and premature deaths due to vitamin D deficiency in Canada.', 'Review of the concept of vitamin D ""sufficiency and insufficiency"".', 'Nutritional deficiency in South African adults scheduled for bariatric surgery.', 'Using a low-dose ultraviolet-B lighting solution during working hours: An explorative investigation towards the effectivity in maintaining healthy vitamin D levels.', 'Melanin levels in relation to vitamin D among first-generation immigrants from different ethnic groups and origins: A comparative national Canadian cross-sectional study.', 'COVID-19 Inflammatory Markers and Vitamin D Relationship in Pediatric Patients.', 'Prevalence of an insufficient vitamin D status at the onset of a spinal cord injury - a cross-sectional study.']"""

Our main objective was to assess their contribution before radiation therapy or brachytherapy. Our secondary objective was to compare pathologic findings of the SVB to the magnetic resonance imaging's (MRI) results.  Patients and methods:   From 2000 to 2008, 135 men (median age: 70 years) with prostate cancer (cT1a to cT3) underwent SVB right and left. The median PSA was 12 ng/ml. The median Gleason score was 7. Forty-one patients had an endorectal MRI. The median follow-up was 47 months.  Results:   Seminal vesicle involvement was found in 10% of patients. In 9.2% of cases, the biopsy was not contributive. The risk of invasion was significantly associated with the stage T3, the Gleason score up to 7 and the percentage of prostate positive biopsies. A MRI was performed in 41 cases: the correlation between MRI and SVB for the invasion of seminal vesicle was significant but moderate (kappa=0.38). The complications rate of SVB was 10%.  Conclusion:   SVB were a simple and profitable method. They have provided supplementary information that could improve the staging and that could lead to the make use of an appropriate treatment. This information was comparable to the information provided by MRI. Further studies should establish their role in relation to MRI and in particular confirm the best specificity of the SVB.""","""['R Braguet', 'N Brichart', 'O Haillot', 'S Guérif', 'G Fromont', 'B Doré', 'J Irani']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Prog Urol""","""['Seminal vesicle biopsy: accuracy and implications for staging of prostate cancer.', 'Seminal vesicle biopsy and laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection: implications for patient selection in the radiotherapeutic management of prostate cancer.', 'Patterns of local failure following prostate brachytherapy.', 'Seminal vesicle biopsies: an useful staging procedure-exposure of seminal vesicle biopsies protocol and review of the literature.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of prostate cancer.']"""

Downregulation of AR protein, but not mRNA, was blocked by proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and bortezomib, indicating that the pathway regulation is mediated at multiple points.

Objective:   To evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of patients with UR.  Design, setting, and participants:   We reviewed 1506 patients who underwent RC to identify patients with UR. Median follow-up after RC was 13.5 yr (interquartile range [IQR]: 10.5-18.4).  Intervention:   Urethrectomy.  Measurements:   Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze predictors of UR and evaluate factors associated with death from urothelial carcinoma (UC) in patients who experienced UR. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) for patients with UR, stratified according to the mode of diagnosis (abnormal urethral cytology vs symptoms), was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test.  Results and limitations:   UR was identified in 85 patients (5.6%) at a median of 13.3 mo (IQR: 6.1-23.2) after RC, including 80 of 1243 (6.4%) who underwent cutaneous urinary diversion and 5 of 242 (2.1%) who received an orthotopic neobladder (p=0.002). On multivariate analysis, prostate involvement with UC (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.89; p<0.0001), bladder tumor multifocality (HR: 2.34; p=0.001), and orthotopic diversion (HR: 0.34; p=0.02) were significantly associated with the risk of UR. The 5-yr CSS after UR diagnosed by cytology was 80% versus 41% for patients who presented with symptoms (p<0.0001). Patients with symptomatic UR were noted to have significantly higher stage disease at urethrectomy (p=0.04) and tended toward an increased risk of death from UC (HR: 1.94; p=0.08). Limitations included retrospective study design.  Conclusions:   Prostate involvement with UC, tumor multifocality, and type of urinary diversion are significantly associated with UR following RC.

To elucidate molecular mechanisms of efficient tumor progression under the hypoferric condition, we studied the roles of six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate family member 3 (STEAP3), which was reported to facilitate iron uptake. Using Raji cells with low STEAP3 mRNA expression, human STEAP3-overexpressing cells were established. The impact of STEAP3 expression was analyzed about the amount of iron storage, the survival under hypoferric conditions in vitro and the growth of tumor in vivo. STEAP3 overexpression increased ferritin, an indicator of iron storage, in STEAP3-overexpressing Raji cells. STEAP3 gave Raji cells the resistance to iron deprivation-induced apoptosis. These STEAP3-overexpressing Raji cells preserved efficient growth even in hypoferric mice, while parental Raji cells grew less rapidly. In addition, iron deficiency enhanced STEAP3 mRNA expression in tumor cells. Furthermore, human colorectal cancer tissues exhibited more STEAP3 mRNA expression and iron storage compared with normal colon mucosa.

In prostate cancer, similar to other cancer types, CSCs and/or progenitor cancer cells are believed to drive tumor recurrence and tumor growth. Thus salinomycin can potentially interfere with the end-stage progression of hormone-indifferent and chemotherapy-resistant prostate cancer. Androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and androgen-refractive (PC-3, DU-145) human prostate cancer cells showed dose- and time-dependent reduced viability upon salinomycin treatment; non-malignant RWPE-1 prostate cells were relatively less sensitive to drug-induced lethality. Salinomycin triggered apoptosis of PC-3 cells by elevating the intracellular ROS level, which was accompanied by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, translocation of Bax protein to mitochondria, cytochrome c release to the cytoplasm, activation of the caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP-1, a caspase-3 substrate. Expression of the survival protein Bcl-2 declined. Pretreatment of PC-3 cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prevented escalation of oxidative stress, dissipation of the membrane polarity of mitochondria and changes in downstream molecular events.

These novel CRC-FNPs were prepared by a two-step co-acervation method using calcium chloride as the cross-linker. The prepared nanoparticles were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetry (TG), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. DLS studies showed that the particle size of CRC-FNPs was in the range of 150-200 nm. The loading efficiency (LE) and in vitro drug release were studied using UV spectrophotometer. The LE was found to be 90%. The cytotoxicity was studied using L929 (mouse fibroblast), PC3 (prostate) and MCF7 (breast) cancer cell lines by MTT assay, which confirmed that CRC-FNPs were comparatively non toxic to L929 cell line while toxic to PC3 and MCF7 cancer cells. Cellular uptake of CRC-FNPs studied using L929, MCF-7 and PC3 cells monitored by fluorescent microscopy, demonstrated significant internalization and retention of nanoparticles inside the cells. The preferential accumulation of curcumin within the cancer cells were also confirmed by flowcytometry based uptake studies. The apoptosis assay showed increased apoptosis on MCF-7 compared to L929 cells. The blood compatibility of CRC-FNPs throws light on the fact that it is possible to administer the prepared nanoformulation intravenously. The results indicated that CRC-FNPs could be a promising therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.""","""['N Sanoj Rejinold', 'M Muthunarayanan', 'K P Chennazhi', 'S V Nair', 'R Jayakumar']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biomed Nanotechnol""","""['5-fluorouracil loaded fibrinogen nanoparticles for cancer drug delivery applications.', 'Development of novel fibrinogen nanoparticles by two-step co-acervation method.', 'Synthesis and characterization of curcumin loaded polymer/lipid based nanoparticles and evaluation of their antitumor effects on MCF-7 cells.', 'Enhanced delivery system of flutamide loaded chitosan-dextran sulphate nanoparticles for prostate cancer.', 'Curcumin-loaded N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles for cancer drug delivery.', 'Accelerated Simple Preparation of Curcumin-Loaded Silk Fibroin/Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogels for Biomedical Applications.', 'Prospects of Curcumin Nanoformulations in Cancer Management.', 'Thromboelastometric Analysis of Anticancer Cerrena unicolor Subfractions Reveal Their Potential as Fibrin Glue Drug Carrier Enhancers.', 'Improved Bioavailability of Curcumin in Gliadin-Protected Gold Quantum Cluster for Targeted Delivery.', 'Encapsulation of epigallocatechin-3-gallate into albumin nanoparticles improves pharmacokinetic and bioavailability in rat model.']"""
