However, GA-affected DNA damage and repair gene expressions in human prostate cancer cells are still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether or not GA induces DNA damage and inhibits DNA repair gene expression in a human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3). The results from flow cytometric assay indicated that GA decreased the percentage of viable PC-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. PC-3 cells after exposure to different doses (50, 100, and 200 μM) of GA and various periods of time (12, 24, and 48 h) led to a longer DNA migration smear (comet tail) occurred based on the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). These observations indicated that GA-induced DNA damage in PC-3 cells, which also confirmed by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, results from real-time polymerase chain reaction assay also indicated that GA inhibited ataxia telangiectasia mutated, ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related, O⁶-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, DNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase, and p53 mRNA expressions in PC-3 cells. Taken together, the present study showed that GA caused DNA damage and inhibited DNA repair genes as well as both effects may be the critical factors for GA-inhibited growth of PC-3 cells in vitro.""","""['Kuo-Ching Liu', 'Heng-Chien Ho', 'An-Cheng Huang', 'Bin-Chuan Ji', 'Hui-Yi Lin', 'Fu-Shin Chueh', 'Jai-Sing Yang', 'Chi-Cheng Lu', 'Jo-Hua Chiang', 'Menghsiao Meng', 'Jing-Gung Chung']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Environ Toxicol""","""['Gallic acid induces DNA damage and inhibits DNA repair-associated protein expression in human oral cancer SCC-4 cells.', 'Emodin, aloe-emodin and rhein induced DNA damage and inhibited DNA repair gene expression in SCC-4 human tongue cancer cells.', 'Triptolide induced DNA damage in A375.S2 human malignant melanoma cells is mediated via reduction of DNA repair genes.', 'DNA repair inhibition: a selective tumour targeting strategy.', 'Targeting the DNA damage response in oncology: past, present and future perspectives.', 'Therapeutic and Nutraceutical Effects of Polyphenolics from Natural Sources.', 'Gallic Acid: A Potential Anti-Cancer Agent.', 'Gallic Acid Suppressed Tumorigenesis by an LncRNA MALAT1-Wnt/β-Catenin Axis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'HPLC phenolic profile and induction of apoptosis by Linum usitatissimum extract in LNCaP cells by caspase3 and Bax pathways.', 'Modulation of cell signaling pathways by Phyllanthus amarus and its major constituents: potential role in the prevention and treatment of inflammation and cancer.']"""

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a key regulator of calcium absorption. In the small intestine, VDR expression is regulated by the CDX-2 transcription factor, which binds a polymorphic site in the VDR gene promoter. We examined VDR Cdx2 genotype and calcium intake, assessed by a food frequency questionnaire, in 533 African-American prostate cancer cases (256 with advanced stage at diagnosis, 277 with localized stage) and 250 African-American controls who participated in the California Collaborative Prostate Cancer Study. We examined the effects of genotype, calcium intake, and diet-gene interactions by conditional logistic regression. Compared with men in the lowest quartile of calcium intake, men in the highest quartile had an approximately twofold increased risk of localized and advanced prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.40, 3.46), with a significant dose-response. Poor absorbers of calcium (VDR Cdx2 GG genotype) had a significantly lower risk of advanced prostate cancer (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.90). The gene-calcium interaction was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Among men with calcium intake below the median (680 mg/day), carriers of the G allele had an approximately 50% decreased risk compared with men with the AA genotype.

Various approaches have been used to down-regulate neoplastic growth of prostate cancer using natural flavonoids, soluble receptors, pseudo-ligands, monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tyrphostins). Selected growth factor/growth factor receptor loops (mainly TGFα/EGFR and IGFs/IGFIR) have been proposed as regulators of prostate cancer cell growth. We have previously determined that blockade of IGFIR or VEGF2R signaling pathways by tyrphostin AG1024 and SU1498 inhibits autocrine growth and viability of DU145 cells in vitro. Recently, we compared the activity of AG1024 and SU1498 with the inhibiting effect of tyrphostin A23 (a selective inhibitor of EGFR). The results described in this paper confirm that DU145 cells do not produce IGFI or EGF. In contrast, DU145 cells produce a great amount of VEGF, much more than TGFα (about 60-fold), and VEGF may be the real autocrine growth factor of the investigated cells. The results indicate that the growth of DU145 may be regulated by at least three autocrine loops: TGFα/EGFR, IGFII/IGFIR and VEGF/VEGFR2. Neither AG1024 nor SU1498 affected the production of TGFα substantially, which excludes the possibility that IGFRs or VEGFR2 inhibitors arrest the growth of these cells by inhibition of synthesis and/or secretion of TGFα. The obtained data indicate that all tree investigated tyrphostins (AG1024, SU1498 and A23) inhibit signal transmission by Akt (PKB), ERK(1/2), Src and STAT in a similar manner. A comparison of the effects of the investigated tyrphostins indicates that TGFα, IGFII and VEGF stimulate cell growth by affecting the same signaling pathway. The hypothesis was confirmed by the effect of the investigated tyrphostins on activation of EGFR. All these inhibitors decreased phosphorylation of EGFR to the same extent, and after the same time of incubation with cell culture. These results strongly suggest that stimulation of EGFR kinase is the main step in the initiation of mitogen signaling in DU145 cells, regardless of the type of ligand (TGFα, IGFs or VEGF) and their specific receptors.""","""['Janusz Ligęza', 'Joanna Ligęza', 'Andrzej Klein']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Acta Biochim Pol""","""['The effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, tyrphostins: AG1024 and SU1498, on autocrine growth of prostate cancer cells (DU145).', 'Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor blockade inhibits the action of EGF, insulin-like growth factor I, and a protein kinase A activator on the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Differential roles of ERK and Akt pathways in regulation of EGFR-mediated signaling and motility in prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting of EGFR tyrosine kinase by ZD1839 (""Iressa"") in androgen-responsive prostate cancer in vitro.', 'Targeting of membrane receptor tyrosine kinases: is there resistance in the HER?.', 'AG1024, an IGF-1 receptor inhibitor, ameliorates renal injury in rats with diabetic nephropathy via the SOCS/JAK2/STAT pathway.', 'Chronic and Cycling Hypoxia: Drivers of Cancer Chronic Inflammation through HIF-1 and NF-κB Activation: A Review of the Molecular Mechanisms.', 'The Protein Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Tyrphostin 23 Strongly Accelerates Glycolytic Lactate Production in Cultured Primary Astrocytes.', 'Kaiso, a transcriptional repressor, promotes cell migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through regulation of miR-31 expression.', 'Induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells by blocking of vascular endothelial growth factor by siRNA.']"""

Age-adjusted odds ratios are employed to reveal the disparities by single and composite socioeconomic indicators at county, census tract, and block group levels.  Results:   The analysis shows that (1) disparities in prostate cancer mortality are significant for most socioeconomic indicators, (2) area-level socioeconomic indicators tend to reveal a less extent of disparity than individual-level indicators do, and (3) socioeconomic disparities in prostate cancer mortality at the census tract and block group levels are similar to each other but are completely different from those at the county level.

Since the finding that β-catenin is a cofactor of the androgen receptor (AR) and can augment AR signaling, several proteins have been found to affect AR signaling through their interaction with β-catenin. Here, we investigated inhibitor of β-catenin and T-cell factor (ICAT), a β-catenin binding protein that inhibits the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, in AR signaling. We demonstrated that expression of ICAT in two AR positive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and LAPC4, augments ligand-dependent AR-mediated transcription. In contrast, short hairpin RNA knockdown of ICAT and β-catenin specifically blocks enhanced AR-mediated transcription by ICAT. Using both stable expression of ICAT and short hairpin RNA knockdown of ICAT expression approaches, we further showed that ICAT enhances expression of endogenous PSA and KLK2, two androgen response genes, and ligand-induced cell growth. In addition, we identified that ICAT and AR can form a ternary complex with β-catenin using in vitro glutathione S-transferase protein pulldown assays. Moreover, we detected the endogenous protein complex containing ICAT, AR, and β-catenin in prostate cancer cells using immunoprecipitation assays. Recruitment of endogenous ICAT onto the promoter region of the human PSA gene, an AR downstream target promoter, was also identified in LNCaP cells. Finally, using in vitro protein binding assays, we examined the effect of full-length and truncated ICAT on the AR-β-catenin interaction and observed that addition of full-length ICAT retained the interaction between β-catenin and AR proteins. Intriguingly, the truncated ICAT comprising the N-terminal helical domain showed a more pronounced effect on β-catenin binding to AR proteins.

Patients and methods:   A total of 241 cases of SCC of the prostate were reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries from 1973 to 2003 of which 191 cases were included in our study. We used the Kaplan-Meier method for estimating survival, and Cox proportional hazard regression modelling to evaluate prognostic variables.  Results:   The overall age-adjusted incidence rate was 0.278 per 1,000,000 (95% confidence interval, 0.239-0.323). In all, 60.5% presented as metastatic disease compared with 39.5% who presented as local/regional disease (P= 0.012). The 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months observed survival rates were 47.9%, 27.5%, 19%, 17% and 14.3% respectively. On univariate analyses, age <60, concomitant low-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma, absence of metastasis, prostatectomy and radiation therapy were favourable prognostic factors. In multivariate regression modelling, age, pathology and stage were strong predictors of survival.  Conclusions:   Using the SEER database, we present the largest study describing the epidemiology of primary SCC of the prostate. We found age, concomitant low-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma, and stage of the disease to be the strongest predictors of survival for patients with prostatic SCC.

Patients and methods:   From the SEER registry, 693 men with ductal PCa were identified from 1970. The demographics, clinical features and cause of death data were collected from men with ductal and acinar histological types.  Results:   The incidence of ductal PCa has increased over each decade, but the overall percentage of ductal relative to acinar PCa has remained stable. Men with ductal PCa were more likely to present with advanced disease (30% T3 with ductal PCa, compared with 7% with acinar PCa). Men with ductal PCa underwent similar rates of radical surgery, lower rates of radiotherapy but a higher frequency of outlet (transurethral resection) procedures. Men with ductal PCa had a significantly greater rate of death from PCa (12% vs 4%) than men with acinar PCa. Comparing PCa-specific mortality, men with ductal PCa had similar rates of death to men with Gleason 4 + 4 grade acinar PCa.  Conclusions:   Despite a stable incidence, ductal PCa remains an aggressive PCa usually presenting with advanced clinical stage and resulting in a high rate of PCa-specific mortality similar to Gleason 4 + 4 acinar PCa.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is widely used to treat men with prostate cancer, little is known about the information needs of patients on ADT. We found that patients are generally very satisfied with using ADT and expressed minimal decisional regret with its use up to four years later. For men receiving ADT in the adjuvant setting, their survival estimates with the addition of ADT were quite reasonable when compared to findings in randomized trails. A key area to enhance patient education appears to be side effects, especially around hot flashes and fatigue, which were also the most bothersome treatment sequelae for patients.  Objective:   To evaluate information needs of men receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Patients and methods:   A cross-sectional survey was distributed to English-speaking prostate cancer patients receiving ADT adjuvant to radical therapy or for biochemical relapse. Three cohorts were recruited based on duration of ADT use: <6 months (cohort 1), 6-18 months (cohort 2) and 18 months to 4 years (cohort 3). Several validated questionnaires were used, including the Control Preferences Scale (CPS), Satisfaction with Treatment Decision Scale (SWD) and Decisional Regret Scale (DRS). Patients on adjuvant ADT were asked to estimate their overall survival with and without ADT.  Results:   Eighty-five men were recruited, of whom 91.8% were receiving a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist, 4.7% were receiving anti-androgen monotherapy and 3.5% were receiving combined androgen blockade. Patients preferred the following decision-making roles: 23.5% active, 50.6% collaborative, 27.0% passive. Mean patient satisfaction for ADT use was high at 24.0/30 and decisional regret was low at 7.9/25. There was a perceived overall survival benefit of 3.9-6.9% at 5 years, 3.6-17.8% at 10 years and 5.7-18.1% at 15 years with the addition of adjuvant ADT. Hot flushes and fatigue were reported as the most common theoretical adverse effects as well as those experienced most commonly by patients.

Level of Evidence 2a. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) has been most commonly used for the symptom assessment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). However, LUTS in men are so variable that they may not be fully captured by the IPSS questionnaire alone. This study has demonstrated that the Core Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Score (CLSS) questionnaire, which addresses 10 important symptoms, is an appropriate initial assessment tool for LUTS in men with various diseases/conditions.  Objective:   International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) has been commonly used to assess lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). We have recently developed Core Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Score (CLSS). The aim of this study is to compare IPSS and CLSS for assessing LUTS in men.  Patients and methods:   Consecutive 515 men fulfilled IPSS and CLSS questionnaires. IPSS QOL Index was used as the QOL surrogate. The clinical diagnoses were BPH (n = 116), BPH with OAB wet (n =80), prostate cancer (n = 128), prostatitis (n = 68), underactive bladder (n = 8), others (n = 72), and controls (e.g., occult blood) (n = 42). Simple statistics and predictability of poor QOL (QOL Index 4 or greater) were examined.  Results:   All symptom scores were significantly increased in symptomatic men compared with controls. Scores of corresponding symptoms of two questionnaires were significantly correlated (r = 0.58-0.85, all P < 0.0001). A multivariate regression model to predict poor QOL indicated nine symptoms (daytime frequency, nocturia, urgency, urgency incontinence, slow stream, straining, incomplete emptying, bladder pain and urethral pain) as independent factors. The hazard ratios for bladder pain (2.2) and urgency incontinence (2.0) were among the highest. All the nine symptoms are addressed in CLSS, while three symptoms (urgency incontinence, bladder, and urethral pain) are dismissed in IPSS.  Conclusion:   CLSS questionnaire is more comprehensive than IPSS questionnaire for symptom assessment of men with various diseases/conditions, although both questionnaires can capture LUTS with possible negative impact on QOL.""","""['Tetsuya Fujimura', 'Haruki Kume', 'Hiroaki Nishimatsu', 'Toru Sugihara', 'Akira Nomiya', 'Yuzuri Tsurumaki', 'Hideyo Miyazaki', 'Motofumi Suzuki', 'Hiroshi Fukuhara', 'Yutaka Enomoto', 'Yukio Homma']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men by international prostate symptom score and core lower urinary tract symptom score.', 'Core lower urinary tract symptom score (CLSS) for the assessment of female lower urinary tract symptoms: a comparative study.', 'Association between lower urinary tract symptoms and sexual dysfunction assessed using the core lower urinary tract symptom score and International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaires.', 'Natural history of lower urinary tract symptoms in Japanese men from a 15-year longitudinal community-based study.', 'Total urgency and frequency score as a measure of urgency and frequency in overactive bladder and storage lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'EAU Guidelines on the Assessment of Non-neurogenic Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms including Benign Prostatic Obstruction.', 'A new nomogram of urinary flow rate and volume based on multiple measurements per healthy adult Japanese men using a portable uroflowmeter (P-Flowdiary®).', 'Relationship between the cross-sectional area of the lumbar dural sac and lower urinary tract symptoms: A population-based cross-sectional study.', 'Beneficial Effects of Saw Palmetto Fruit Extract on Urinary Symptoms in Japanese Female Subjects by a Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.', 'Prevalence, Burden, and Treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Men Aged 50 and Older: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Impact of early vs. delayed initiation of dutasteride/tamsulosin combination therapy on the risk of acute urinary retention or BPH-related surgery in LUTS/BPH patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms at risk of disease progression.']"""

Patients and methods:   Demographic, clinical and pathological data were collected on men undergoing primary cryosurgery from 2002-2010, excluding those who had received neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiotherapy. Complications and events were broadly defined as any deviation from the expected postoperative course and any subjective complaint expressed during a follow-up visit. Descriptive statistics were generated and compared between groups using chi-squared and rank sum tests as appropriate. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the potential predictors of any complication or event.  Results:   In total, 106 consecutive patients were identified.

Methods:   Human CaP cells, LNCaP, were each genetically altered to express the AS and AI phenotypes and subjected to VD(3) treatment and freezing in an in vitro and tissue-engineered model. Cell viability, caspase inhibitor and western blot studies were used to determine the basis of the different responses of AI and AS cells to VD(3) cryosensitization.  Results:   VD(3) was found to be a highly effective cryosensitizer, resulting in a >50% overall increase in cell death after -15 °C freezing. Fluorescence microscopy, western blot analysis and caspase protease assays confirmed that the increased activation of apoptosis was modulated through a mitochondrial-mediated pathway. Caspase inhibition studies showed that apoptosis played an integral role in cell death, with VD(3) cryosensitivation-induced apoptotic events responsible for >30% of the overall cell death after -15 °C freezing.  Conclusions:   The present study suggests that the use of VD(3) as a cryosensitizer increases cryoablation efficacy through the increased activity of apoptosis as well as through necrosis. The data show that through VD(3) treatment the overall level of AI CaP cell tolerance to freezing is reduced to a level similar to that of AS CaP.

Patients and methods:   Clinical data from two multi-centre European open-label, prospective studies evaluating the clinical utility of the PCA3 assay in guiding initial and repeat biopsy decisions were analysed. First-catch urine was collected after digital rectal examination (three strokes per lobe) and the PCA3 score was determined using the PROGENSA(®) PCA3 assay. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (≥8 cores) and radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens were analysed by the local pathologist. The relationship between biopsy and RP outcomes with the PCA3 score was assessed.  Results:   Of the 1009 men enrolled, 348 (34%) had a positive biopsy. The median and mean PCA3 scores were statistically significantly lower in men with biopsy Gleason score <7 vs ≥7, with clinical stage T1c vs T2a-T2c, T3a cancers, with ≤33% vs >33% positive biopsy cores and with 'biopsy indolent' vs 'biopsy significant' prostate cancer (indolent prostate cancer defined by biopsy Epstein criteria). In all, 175 men with a positive biopsy had a RP: median and mean PCA3 scores were statistically significantly lower in men with pathological Gleason score <7 vs ≥7, and with pathological stage T2a-T2c vs T3a-T3b cancers.  Conclusions:   The PCA3 score may combined with traditional tools aid in identifying men with clinically insignificant prostate cancer, as shown by biopsy and RP pathological features including biopsy Epstein criteria, who could be candidates for active surveillance. Treatment selection should be based on a combination of clinical and pathological variables. If one wants to use a threshold point to guide treatment decisions in clinical practice, a PCA3 score threshold of 20 may have the highest utility for selecting men with clinically insignificant prostate cancer in whom active surveillance may be appropriate; a PCA3 score threshold of 50 may be used to identify men at high risk of harbouring significant prostate cancer who are candidates for RP.

The system was used to assess the quality of prostate cancer surgery and to analyze possible time-dependent trends in the quality of care.  Patients and methods:   An Internet-based database system enabled a standardized collection of treatment data and clinical findings from the participating urological centres for the years 2005-2009. An analysis was performed aiming to evaluate relevant patient characteristics (age, pathological tumour stage, preoperative International Index of Erectile Function-5 score), intra-operative parameters (operating time, percentage of nerve-sparing operations, complication rate, transfusion rate, number of resected lymph nodes) and postoperative parameters (hospitalization time, re-operation rate, catheter indwelling time). Mean values were calculated and compared for each annual cohort from 2005 to 2008. The overall survival rate was also calculated for a subgroup of the Berlin patients.  Results:   A total of 914, 1120, 1434 and 1750 patients submitted to radical prostatectomy in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were documented in the database. The mean age at the time of surgery remained constant (66 years) during the study period. More than half the patients already had erectile dysfunction before surgery (median International Index of Erectile Function-5 score of 19-20). During the observation period, there was a decrease in the percentage of pT2 tumours (1% in 2005; 64% in 2008) and a slight increase in the percentage of patients with lymph node metastases (8% in 2005; 10% in 2008). No time trend was found for the operating time (142-155 min) or the percentage of nerve-sparing operations (72-78% in patients without erectile dysfunction). A decreasing frequency was observed for the parameters: blood transfusions (1.9% in 2005; 0.5% in 2008), postoperative bleeding (2.6%; 1.2%) and re-operations (4.5%; 2.8%). The mean hospitalization time decreased accordingly (10 days in 2005; 8 days in 2008). The examined subcohort had an overall mortality of 1.5% (median follow-up of 3 years).  Conclusions:   An Internet-based database system for tumour documentation in patients with prostate cancer enables the collection and assessment of important parameters for the quality of care and outcomes.

In the present study, testosterone has been derivatized to 17α-azidoandrost-4-ene-3-one using microwave-mediated azidation of the mesylate. Subsequently, a facile one-pot Cu(I)-catalyzed Click reaction was carried out to synthesize (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-labeled 17α-triazolylandrost-4-ene-3-one, which was characterized by HPLC. The chemical characterization of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-17α-triazolylandrost-4-ene-3-one was carried out by preparing its corresponding rhenium complex using [NEt(4)](2)[Re(CO)(3)Br(3)] precursor. The radiolabeled complex could be prepared in >95% radiochemical yield as determined by HPLC. In vitro studies of (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-17α-triazolylandrost-4-ene-3-one complex in LNCaP cell lines overexpressing ARs showed binding of 4.95%±1.2%, with inhibition of 8%±0.9%. In vivo biodistribution studies in male Wistar rats have shown uptake in the prostate to the extent of 0.48%±0.19% injected dose/g at 1 hpi and retention therein till 3 hpi.

Methods:   Our analysis included 1,444 radical prostatectomy patients with available information concerning the number and location of tumor foci in the specimen. Each patient was assigned to one of three groups depending on whether they had unifocal, multifocal, or extensive cancer. Clinical and pathological features as well as biochemical outcomes were compared between the groups.  Results:   Two hundred and seventy-two mens in the study cohort (18.8%) had unifocal cancer.

The number of positive biopsy cores was slightly lower in the unifocal group, while the overall amount of biopsy tissue containing cancer was similar in both groups. The patients in the multifocal group had higher pathologic Gleason scores, increased incidence of positive surgical margin, and larger tumors. The rate of clinically significant Gleason score upgrade was significantly higher in the multifocal group compared to the unifocal group (35.7% vs. 21.7%, respectively, P < 0.001).

To better fill the gap with human, we refined the previously described orthotopic dog prostate cancer (DPC)-1 model.  Methods:   Cyclosporine (Cy) A was used for immune suppression at varying doses and time-periods prior and after orthotopic DPC-1 cell implantation in the dog prostate (n = 12). Follow up included digital rectal examination, ultrasound prostate imaging and biopsies of hypoechoic areas. At necropsy, the prostate, iliosacral lymph nodes (LN), lung nodules, and suspicious bone segments were collected for histopathology.  Results:   15 mg CyA/kg daily for 10 days was optimal for tumor take. Maintaining these conditions post-implantation resulted in a rapid tumor development within and beyond the prostate and in iliosacral LNs. To minimize tumor burden, 10 times less DPC-1 cells were implanted. A series of dogs was next followed for 3-4 months, under continuous immune suppression (n = 3) or with CyA interruption at 8.5 weeks (n = 2). In all instances, multifocal tumors were found within the prostate. Predominant patterns were micropapillary and cribriform. Metastases were present in iliosacral LNs and lungs. Moreover, pelvic bone metastases producing a mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic reaction were confirmed in two dogs, one per group. Lastly, the release of CyA 1-2 weeks post-implantation (n = 3) did not prevent tumor growth and spreading to LNs.  Conclusions:   The continuing growth of DPC-1 tumors despite the release of CyA and, for the first time, spreading to bones renders this refined model closer to the spontaneous canine and hormone-refractory phase of human PCa.""","""['Maurice Anidjar', 'Eleonora Scarlata', 'Fabio L Cury', 'Joice Rocha', 'Lucie Hamel', 'Murilo Luz', 'Simone Chevalier']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Severe combined immunodeficient-hu model of human prostate cancer metastasis to human bone.', 'Animal models of bone metastasis.', 'A metastatic human prostate cancer model using intraprostatic implantation of tumor produced by PC-3 neolacZ transfected cells.', 'New bone formation and osteolysis by a metastatic, highly invasive canine prostate carcinoma xenograft.', 'In vivo models of prostate cancer metastasis to bone.', 'RNA-seq of nine canine prostate cancer cell lines reveals diverse therapeutic target signatures.', 'Canine prostatic cancer cell line (LuMa) with osteoblastic bone metastasis.', 'Canine prostate models in preclinical studies of minimally invasive interventions: part I, canine prostate anatomy and prostate cancer models.', 'The dog prostate cancer (DPC-1) model: a reliable tool for molecular imaging of prostate tumors and metastases.', 'Animal Models of Bone Metastasis.']"""

We have performed the first systematic analysis of ID4 expression and methylation in prostate cancer.  Methods:   ID4 mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in 47 carcinoma and 13 benign prostatic tissues obtained by prostatectomy. Methylation was analyzed in an extended series of samples by methylation-specific MS-PCR and pyrosequencing, controlled by bisulfite sequencing.  Results:   ID4 expression was significantly decreased in prostate cancers, especially in cases with adverse clinical and histopathological features and earlier recurrence.

Mechanisms leading to inactivation of this pathway (example: activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling or mutations of members of the degradation complex) can result in β-catenin stabilization and activation of β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) signaling. β-Catenin-mediated cellular events are diverse and complex. A better understanding of the cellular signaling networks that control β-catenin pathway is important for designing effective therapeutic strategies targeting this axis. To gain more insight, we focused on determining any possible cross-talk between β-catenin and mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), a MAPK kinase kinase member. Our studies indicated that MLK3 can induce β-catenin expression via post-translational stabilization in various cancer cells, including prostate cancer. This function of MLK3 was dependent on its kinase activity. MLK3 can interact with β-catenin and phosphorylate it in vitro. Overexpression of GSK3β-WT or the S9A mutant was unable to antagonize MLK3-induced stabilization, suggesting this to be independent of GSK3β pathway. Surprisingly, despite stabilizing β-catenin, MLK3 inhibited TCF transcriptional activity in the presence of both WT and S37A β-catenin. These resulted in reduced expression of β-catenin/TCF downstream targets Survivin and myc. Immunoprecipitation studies indicated that MLK3 did not decrease β-catenin/TCF interaction but promoted interaction between β-catenin and KLF4, a known repressor of β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity. In addition, co-expression of MLK3 and β-catenin resulted in significant G(2)/M arrest. These studies provide a novel insight toward the regulation of β-catenin pathway, which can be targeted to control cancer cell proliferation, particularly those with aberrant activation of β-catenin signaling.""","""['Ramesh P Thylur', 'Subramanian Senthivinayagam', 'Edward M Campbell', 'Velusamy Rangasamy', 'Nithyananda Thorenoor', 'Gautam Sondarva', 'Suneet Mehrotra', 'Prajna Mishra', 'Erin Zook', 'Phong T Le', 'Ajay Rana', 'Basabi Rana']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Sox17 and Sox4 differentially regulate beta-catenin/T-cell factor activity and proliferation of colon carcinoma cells.', 'Regulation of β-catenin by t-DARPP in upper gastrointestinal cancer cells.', 'Lysophosphatidic acid activates β-catenin/T cell factor signaling, which contributes to the suppression of apoptosis in H19-7 cells.', 'Signaling through beta-catenin and Lef/Tcf.', 'Wnt signaling through T-cell factor phosphorylation.', 'Bone Health Management in the Continuum of Prostate Cancer Disease.', 'Mixed Lineage Kinase 3 phosphorylates prolyl-isomerase PIN1 and potentiates GLI1 signaling in pancreatic cancer development.', 'Berberine Represses β-Catenin Translation Involving 4E-BPs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.', 'Rationalized inhibition of mixed lineage kinase 3 and CD70 enhances life span and antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cells.', 'Ras and Wnt Interaction Contribute in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.']"""

Although these proteins control transcriptional elongation and perhaps modulate the effects of other transcription factors, the mechanisms of their actions remain largely unknown. To gain new insights into the biology of the EAF2 and ELL family proteins, we used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to explore the in vivo roles of their worm orthologs. Through the use of transgenic worms, RNAi, and an eaf-1 mutant, we found that both genes are expressed in multiple cell types throughout the worm life cycle and that they play important roles in fertility, survival, and body size regulation. ELL-1 and EAF-1 likely contribute to these activities in part through modulating cuticle synthesis, given that we observed a disrupted cuticle structure in ell-1 RNAi-treated or eaf-1 mutant worms. Consistent with disruption of cuticle structure, loss of either ELL-1 or EAF-1 suppressed the rol phenotype of specific collagen mutants, possibly through the control of dpy-3, dpy-13, and sqt-3 collagen gene expression. Furthermore, we also noted the regulation of collagen expression by ELL overexpression in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.

The synovial sarcoma X chromosome breakpoint (SSX) proteins comprise a set of cancer-testis antigens that are upregulated in MHC class I-deficient germline cells and in various types of advanced cancers with a poor prognosis. Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the SSX family member SSX2 can arise spontaneously in prostate cancer patients. Thus, SSX2 and other proteins of the SSX family may offer useful targets for tumor immunotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the expression of SSX family members in prostate cancer cell lines and tumor biopsies to identify which members might be most appropriate for immune targeting. We found that SSX2 was expressed most frequently in prostate cell lines, but that SSX1 and SSX5 were also expressed after treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Immunohistochemical analysis of microarrayed tissue biopsies confirmed a differential level of SSX protein expression in human prostate cancers. Notably, SSX expression in patient tumor samples was restricted to metastatic lesions (5/22; 23%) and no expression was detected in primary prostate tumors examined (0/73; P < 0.001). We determined that cross-reactive immune responses to a dominant HLA-A2-specific SSX epitope (p103-111) could be elicited by immunization of A2/DR1 transgenic mice with SSX vaccines.

The aim of this study is to propose a new model including a possible role for recently described micro RNAs in prostate cancer (CaP) progression.  Methods:   Sixty-three patients underwent radical prostatectomy to treat localized prostate carcinoma. The specimens of 15 patients were representative of high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). Fourteen specimens represented localized favorable CaP, and 34 unfavorable, mostly non-organ-confined disease. Representing the advanced disease we studied 4 metastatic androgen-independent CaP and 2 cell lines. Micro RNAs were isolated using the mirVana miRNA Isolation kit and cDNA was obtained using the TaqMan miRNA Reverse Transcription kit to the miRNAs: hsa-miR-let7c, hsa-miR-15a, hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-25, hsa-miR-32, hsa-miR-100, hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-145, hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-199a, hsa-miR-206, and hsa-miR-218. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System and the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix. miRNA expression levels were measured by relative quantification, and fold expression changes were determined by the 2(-ΔΔCT) method. The small nucleolar RNA RNU43 was used as an endogenous control.  Results:   Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs significantly changed during the progression of CaP. Interestingly, there was a significant global loss of miRNA expression between HGPIN and metastasis at 2 important steps. The first was related to the transition from HGPIN to invasive adenocarcinoma, and the second was related to the transition from localized to metastatic adenocarcinomas.  Conclusion:   Through the analysis of 14 miRNAs in 4 groups of prostate lesions, which reproduced the progression of CaP, we showed that there is a global loss of miRNA expression at 2 distinct steps. The first related to the transition between HGPIN and localized invasive carcinoma, and the second associated with the transition from localized to metastatic CaP. The importance of our study is in the identification of possible miRNAs and miRNA-targeted genes involved in the progression of prostate carcinogenesis that may help the development of potential diagnostic or prognostic markers as well as the design of new target therapies.""","""['Katia R M Leite', 'Alberto Tomiyama', 'Sabrina T Reis', 'Juliana M Sousa-Canavez', 'Adriana Sañudo', 'Luiz H Camara-Lopes', 'Miguel Srougi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Corrigendum to <MicroRNA expression profiles in the progression of prostate cancer - From high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia to metastasis> Urologic Oncology: Seminars and Original Investigations 31/6 (August, 2013) 796-801.', 'MicroRNA alteration and putative target genes in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer: STAT3 and ZEB1 are upregulated during prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Change in expression of miR-let7c, miR-100, and miR-218 from high grade localized prostate cancer to metastasis.', 'Use of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in prostate needle biopsy specimens with isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia as a predictor of prostate adenocarcinoma on follow-up biopsy.', 'Recent scenario of microRNA as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'HIF-1-Induced hsa-miR-429: Understanding Its Direct Targets as the Key to Developing Cancer Diagnostics and Therapies.', 'Urinary MicroRNAs as Biomarkers of Urological Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'Intratumoral Restoration of miR-137 Plus Cholesterol Favors Homeostasis of the miR-137/Coactivator p160/AR Axis and Negatively Modulates Tumor Progression in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Differential Expression of miRNAs Contributes to Tumor Aggressiveness and Racial Disparity in African American Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Orchestration of miRNA Patterns by Testosterone and Dietary Tomato Carotenoids during Early Prostate Carcinogenesis in TRAMP Mice.', 'MicroRNAs as clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in prostate cancer.']"""

The 2010 NCCN practice guidelines for prostate cancer recommend a pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) at radical prostatectomy in all individuals with a nomogram predicted LNI risk of ≥2%.  Patients and methods:   We assessed 20,877 patients who were treated with radical prostatectomy and PLND between 2004 and 2006, within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. The 2% nomogram threshold, as well as other threshold values (range 1-10%) were tested. Finally, we externally validated the NCCN guideline nomogram.  Results:   Overall, 2.5% of patients had LNI. The use of the 2% threshold would allow the avoidance of 23% of PLNDs, at the cost of missing 1.7% of patients with LNI. Conversely, the use of a 3% threshold would allow the avoidance of 58% of PLNDs, at the cost of missing 15% of patients with LNI vs 72% and 26%, respectively, for the 4% threshold. Overall, the accuracy of the NCCN guideline nomogram quantified according to the receiver-operator characteristics-derived area under the curve was 82%.  Conclusions:   In a population-based sample, the NCCN guideline nomogram is highly accurate. However, the 2% threshold will permit the avoidance of only 23% of PLNDs, instead of the 48% intended by the NCCN guidelines.

The majority of the biological activities of oestrogens are mediated through the oestrogen receptor (ER), which functions as a hormone-inducible transcription factor to regulate target gene expression by binding to oestrogen response elements (EREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes. Sequence variants in EREs might affect the ER-ERE interaction and subsequent physiological activities. Therefore, we tested whether common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inside EREs are related to the clinical outcomes of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We systematically evaluated 49 ERE SNPs predicted using a genome-wide database in a cohort of 601 men with advanced prostate cancer treated with ADT. The prognostic significance of these SNPs on disease progression, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM) after ADT was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox regression model.  Results:   Based on multiple hypothesis testing, BNC2 rs16934641 was found to be associated with disease progression; in addition, TACC2 rs3763763 was associated with PCSM, and ALPK1 rs2051778 and TACC2 rs3763763 were associated with ACM. These SNPs remained significant in multivariate analyses that included known clinicopathological predictors. Moreover, a combined genotype effect on ACM was observed when ALPK1 rs2051778 and TACC2 rs3763763 were analysed in combination.

The androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variants play important roles in regulating the transcription program essential for castration resistance. Here, we report the identification of a novel AR splice variant, designated as AR8, which is up-regulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. AR8 is structurally different from other known AR splice variants because it lacks a DNA binding domain and therefore, unlikely functions as a transcription factor on its own. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that AR8 was primarily localized on the plasma membrane, possibly through palmitoylation of two cysteine residues within its unique C-terminal sequence. Mutation of these putative palmitoylation sites in AR8 led to loss of its plasma membrane localization. In addition, we demonstrated that overexpression of AR8 in prostate cancer cells promoted association of Src and AR with the EGF receptor in response to EGF treatment and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of AR. Conversely, specific knockdown of AR8 expression in prostate cancer cells compromised EGF-induced Src activation and AR phosphorylation. This effect was accompanied with attenuation of proliferation and increased apoptosis in prostate cancer cells cultured in androgen-depleted medium. We also showed that AR8 was required for optimal transcriptional activity of AR in response to treatment of both androgen and EGF. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the membrane-associated AR8 isoform may contribute to castration resistance by potentiating AR-mediated proliferative and survival responses to hormones and growth factors.""","""['Xi Yang', 'Zhiyong Guo', 'Feng Sun', 'Wei Li', 'Alan Alfano', 'Hermela Shimelis', 'Mingyuan Chen', 'Angela M H Brodie', 'Hegang Chen', 'Zhen Xiao', 'Timothy D Veenstra', 'Yun Qiu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['A novel androgen receptor splice variant is up-regulated during prostate cancer progression and promotes androgen depletion-resistant growth.', 'Dasatinib inhibits site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of androgen receptor by Ack1 and Src kinases.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants activate androgen receptor target genes and support aberrant prostate cancer cell growth independent of canonical androgen receptor nuclear localization signal.', 'Androgen receptor variant-driven prostate cancer: clinical implications and therapeutic targeting.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC7 inhibits androgen receptor and suppresses prostate cancer.', 'Modulating the Activity of Androgen Receptor for Treating Breast Cancer.', 'The palmitoylation of AEG-1 dynamically modulates the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'AR Structural Variants and Prostate Cancer.', 'Protein palmitoylation in cancer: molecular functions and therapeutic potential.']"""

PTEN is a tumor suppressor commonly inactivated in prostate cancer that has been mechanistically linked to disease aggressiveness. Though deletion of PTEN, as detected by cumbersome FISH spot counting assays, is associated with poor prognosis, few studies have validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays to determine whether loss of PTEN protein is associated with unfavorable disease.  Experimental design:   PTEN IHC was validated by employing formalin fixed and paraffin-embedded isogenic human cell lines containing or lacking intact PTEN alleles. PTEN IHC was 100% sensitive and 97.8% specific for detecting genomic alterations in 58 additional cell lines. PTEN protein loss was then assessed on 376 prostate tumor samples, and PTEN FISH or high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis was done on a subset of these cases.  Results:   PTEN protein loss, as assessed as a dichotomous IHC variable, was highly reproducible, correlated strongly with adverse pathologic features (e.g., Gleason score and pathologic stage), detected between 75% and 86% of cases with PTEN genomic loss, and was found at times in the absence of apparent genomic loss. In a cohort of 217 high risk surgically treated patients, PTEN protein loss was associated with decreased time to metastasis.  Conclusion:   These studies validate a simple method to interrogate PTEN status in clinical specimens and support the utility of this test in future multicenter studies, clinical trials, and ultimately perhaps for routine clinical care.""","""['Tamara L Lotan', 'Bora Gurel', 'Siobhan Sutcliffe', 'David Esopi', 'Wennuan Liu', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Jessica L Hicks', 'Ben H Park', 'Elizabeth Humphreys', 'Alan W Partin', 'Misop Han', 'George J Netto', 'William B Isaacs', 'Angelo M De Marzo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Loss of PTEN Expression Detected by Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry Predicts Lethal Prostate Cancer in Men Treated with Prostatectomy.', 'Analytic validation of a clinical-grade PTEN immunohistochemistry assay in prostate cancer by comparison with PTEN FISH.', 'Reduced AZGP1 expression is an independent predictor of early PSA recurrence and associated with ERG-fusion positive and PTEN deleted prostate cancers.', 'Clinical implications of PTEN loss in prostate cancer.', 'The PTEN Conundrum: How to Target PTEN-Deficient Prostate Cancer.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'A synthetic lethal screen for Snail-induced enzalutamide resistance identifies JAK/STAT signaling as a therapeutic vulnerability in prostate cancer.', 'Correlations of PTEN and ERG Immunoexpression in Prostate Carcinoma and Lesions Related to Its Natural History: Clinical Perspectives.', 'Association Between ERG/PTEN Genes and Pathologic Parameters of Prostate Cancer With an Emphasis on Gleason Score: A Literature Review.', 'Supporting Biomarker-Driven Therapies in Oncology: A Genomic Testing Cost Calculator.']"""

In contrast, α2-macroglobulin (α2M) is involved in inflammation through its function as a carrier protein of IL-6. We had previously reported on advanced prostate cancer (PCa) patients with multiple distant bone metastases in whom serum α2M levels were markedly decreased (α2M deficiency). However, the relationship between serum levels of α2M and acute inflammatory biomarkers in PCa patients with or without α2M deficiency has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we examined serum levels of CRP, SAA, IL-6, α1AT, α1AG and CP in PCa patients with or without α2M deficiency to establish clinical significance and changes in these biomarkers during PCa disease progression. We found that upon addition of recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) to serum from PCa patients with α2M deficiency, since a function of α2M is to bind and stabilize IL-6, the α2M-IL-6 complex and free endogenous IL-6 were not detectable. Serum levels of the α2M-independent markers, α1AT, α1AG and CP, in all PCa patients regardless of α2M deficiency were significantly higher than in healthy controls, but those of the α2M-dependent molecules, CRP, SAA and IL-6, were not increased in PCa patients with α2M deficiency. Therefore, quantitation of both α2M-dependent (CRP, SAA and IL-6) and α2M-independent (α1AT, α1AG and CP) acute inflammatory biomarkers in advanced PCa patients may be an auxiliary indicator, together with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), to monitor PCa disease progression.""","""['Yuhsaku Kanoh', 'Hideki Ohtani', 'Shin Egawa', 'Shiro Baba', 'Tohru Akahoshi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Clinicopathological characteristics of androgen-dependent advanced prostate cancer patients with α2-macroglobulin deficiency.', 'Changes of proteases and proteinase inhibitors in androgen-dependent advanced prostate cancer patients with alpha2-macroglobulin deficiency.', 'Progression of prostate cancer: diagnostic and prognostic utility of prostate-specific antigen, alpha2-macroglobulin, and their complexes.', 'Inflammatory biomarkers in coronary artery disease.', 'Immunological background of plasma protein abnormalities--the relation between inflammation and malignant neoplasm.', 'Serum amyloid A and other clinicopathological variables in cats with intermediate- and large-cell lymphoma.', 'PSA-alpha-2-macroglobulin complex is enzymatically active in the serum of patients with advanced prostate cancer and can degrade circulating peptide hormones.', 'Serum amyloid A, phospholipase A₂-IIA and C-reactive protein as inflammatory biomarkers for prostate diseases.', 'Chemoprevention of prostate cancer by d,l-sulforaphane is augmented by pharmacological inhibition of autophagy.', 'High-throughput screening of tumor metastatic-related differential glycoprotein in hepatocellular carcinoma by iTRAQ combines lectin-related techniques.']"""

Background:   Prostate cancer is one of the common cancers in Australia. Due to the chronic nature of the disease, it is important to have effective disease management strategy and care model. Multi-disciplinary care is a well-proven approach for chronic disease management. The Multi-disciplinary team (MDT) can function more effectively if all the required information is available for the clinical decision support. The development of innovative technology relies on an accurate understanding of the advanced prostate cancer patient's journey over a prolonged period. This need arises from the fact that advanced prostate cancer patients may follow various treatment paths and change their care providers. As a result of this, it is difficult to understand the actual sources of patient's clinical records and their treatment patterns. The aim of the research is to understand variable sources of clinical records, treatment patterns, alternative therapies, over the counter (OTC) medications of advanced prostate cancer patients. This study provides better and holistic understanding of advanced prostate cancer journey.  Methods:   The study was conducted through an on-line survey developed to seek and analyse the responses from the participants. The on-line questionnaire was carefully developed through consultations with the clinical researchers at the Australian Prostate Cancer Research Centre-Queensland, prostate cancer support group representatives and health informaticians at the Australian E-Health Research Centre. The non-identifying questionnaire was distributed to the patients through prostate cancer support groups in Queensland, Australia. The pilot study was carried out between August 2010 and December 2010.  Results:   The research made important observations about the advanced prostate cancer journey. It showed that General Practitioner (GP) was the common source of patient's clinical records (41%) followed by Urologist (14%) and other clinicians (14%). The data analysis also showed that selenium was the common complementary supplement (55%) used by the patients and about 48% patients did not use any OTC drugs. The most common OTC used by the patients was Paracetamol (about 45%).  Conclusion:   The results have provided a foundation to the architecture of the proposed technology solution. The outcomes of this study are incorporated in design of the proposed patient journey browser system.

Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) technologies such as RapidArc® (RA) may be a more efficient way of delivering intensity-modulated radiotherapy-like (IM) treatments. This study is an audit of the RA experience in an Australian department with a planning and economic comparison to IM.  Methods:   30 consecutive prostate cancer patients treated radically with RA were analyzed. Eight RA patients treated definitively were then completely re-planned with 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D); and a conventional sliding window IM technique; and a new RA plan. The acceptable plans and their treatment times were compared and analyzed for any significant difference. Differences in staff costs of treatment were computed and analyzed.  Results:   Thirty patients had been treated to date with eight being treated definitely to at least 74 Gy, nine post high dose brachytherapy (HDR) to 50.4Gy and 13 post prostatectomy to at least 64Gy. All radiotherapy courses were completed with no breaks. Acute rectal toxicity by the RTOG criteria was acceptable with 22 having no toxicity, seven with grade 1 and one had grade 2.Of the eight re-planned patients, none of the 3D (three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy) plans were acceptable based on local guidelines for dose to organs at risk. There was no statistically significant difference in planning times between IM and RA (p = 0.792). IM had significantly greater MUs per fraction (1813.9 vs 590.2 p < 0.001), total beam time per course (5.2 vs 3.1 hours, p = 0.001) and average treatment staff cost per patient radiotherapy course ($AUD489.91 vs $AUD315.66, p = 0.001). The mean saving in treatment staff cost for RA treatment was $AUD174.25 per patient.  Conclusions:   3D was incapable of covering a modern radiotherapy volume for the radical treatment of prostate cancer. These volumes can be treated via conventional IM and RA. RA was significantly more efficient, safe and cost effective than IM.

Materials and methods:   Fifty patients with 76 malignant liver tumors treated by computed tomography (CT)-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) were included in the study. The prescribed radiation dose was delivered by 1 - 11 catheters with exposure times in the range of 844 - 4432 seconds. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets for assessing irradiation effects on normal liver tissue, edema, and hepatocyte dysfunction, obtained 6 and 12 weeks after HDR-BT, were merged with 3D dosimetry data. The isodose of the treatment plan covering the same volume as the irradiation effect was taken as a surrogate for the liver tissue tolerance dose. Catheter positioning accuracy was assessed by calculating the shift between the 3D center coordinates of the irradiation effect volume and the tolerance dose volume for 38 irradiation effects in 30 patients induced by catheters implanted in nearly parallel arrangement. Effects of prolonged irradiation were assessed in areas where the irradiation effect volume and tolerance dose volume did not overlap (mismatch areas) by using a catheter contribution index. This index was calculated for 48 irradiation effects induced by at least two catheters in 44 patients.  Results:   Positioning accuracy of the brachytherapy catheters was 5-6 mm. The orthogonal and axial shifts between the center coordinates of the irradiation effect volume and the tolerance dose volume in relation to the direction vector of catheter implantation were highly correlated and in first approximation identically in the T1-w and T2-w MRI sequences (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively), as were the shifts between 6 and 12 weeks examinations (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). There was a significant shift of the irradiation effect towards the catheter entry site compared with the planned dose distribution (p < 0.005). Prolonged treatment time increases the normal tissue tolerance dose. Here, the catheter contribution indices indicated a lower tolerance dose of the liver parenchyma in areas with prolonged irradiation (p < 0.005).  Conclusions:   Positioning accuracy of brachytherapy catheters is sufficient for clinical practice. Reduced tolerance dose in areas exposed to prolonged irradiation is contradictory to results published in the current literature. Effects of prolonged dose administration on the liver tolerance dose for treatment times of up to 60 minutes per HDR-BT session are not pronounced compared to effects of positioning accuracy of the brachytherapy catheters and are therefore of minor importance in treatment planning.""","""['Lutz Lüdemann', 'Christian Wybranski', 'Max Seidensticker', 'Konrad Mohnike', 'Siegfried Kropf', 'Peter Wust', 'Jens Ricke']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['In vivo assessment of dose volume and dose gradient effects on the tolerance dose of small liver volumes after single-fraction high-dose-rate 192Ir irradiation.', 'The effect of catheter displacement and anatomical variations on the dose distribution in MRI-guided focal HDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Accuracy of applicator tip reconstruction in MRI-guided interstitial 192Ir-high-dose-rate brachytherapy of liver tumors.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

Curcumin (CUR), a natural diphenol, has shown potent anti-cancer efficacy in various types of cancers. However, suboptimal pharmacokinetics and poor bioavailability limit its effective use in cancer therapeutics. Several successful CUR nanoformulations have recently been reported which improve upon these features; however, there is no personalized safe nanoformulation for prostate cancer. This study contributes two important scientific aspects of prostate cancer therapeutics. The first objective was to investigate the comparative cellular uptake and cytotoxicity evaluation of β-cyclodextrin (CD), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (cellulose), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), and dendrimer based CUR nanoformulations in prostate cancer cells. Curcumin loaded cellulose nanoparticles (cellulose-CUR) formulation exhibited the highest cellular uptake and caused maximum ultrastructural changes related to apoptosis (presence of vacuoles) in prostate cancer cells. Secondly, the anti-cancer potential of the cellulose-CUR formulation was evaluated in cell culture models using cell proliferation, colony formation and apoptosis (7-AAD staining) assays. In these assays, the cellulose-CUR formulation showed improved anti-cancer efficacy compared to free curcumin. Our study shows, for the first time, the feasibility of cellulose-CUR formulation and its potential use in prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Murali Mohan Yallapu', 'Mitch Ray Dobberpuhl', 'Diane Michele Maher', 'Meena Jaggi', 'Subhash Chand Chauhan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Curr Drug Metab""","""['Anti-cancer activity of curcumin loaded nanoparticles in prostate cancer.', 'Novel curcumin-loaded magnetic nanoparticles for pancreatic cancer treatment.', ""In Vitro and In Vivo Comparison of Curcumin-Encapsulated Chitosan-Coated Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) Nanoparticles and Curcumin/Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes Administered Intranasally as Therapeutic Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Antimicrobial Activity of Curcumin in Nanoformulations: A Comprehensive Review.', 'A comprehensive review of the therapeutic potential of curcumin nanoformulations.', 'An introductory review on advanced multifunctional materials.', 'Design of Innovative Biocompatible Cellulose Nanostructures for the Delivery and Sustained Release of Curcumin.', 'Delivery of curcumin within emulsome nanoparticles enhances the anti-cancer activity in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell.', 'Curcumin affects function of Hsp90 and drug efflux pump of Candida albicans.', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.']"""

We have recently shown that once cancer cells disseminate to a secondary organ, a mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transition (MErT) may occur, which we postulate is to enable metastatic colonization. Despite a wealth of in vitro and in vivo studies, evidence supportive of MErT in human specimens is rare and difficult to document because clinically detectable metastases are typically past the micrometastatic stage at which this transition is most likely evident. We obtained paired primary and metastatic tumors from breast and prostate cancer patients and evaluated expression of various epithelial and mesenchymal markers by immunohistochemistry. The metastases exhibited increased expression of membranous E-cadherin compared to primary tumors, consistent with EMT at the primary site and MErT at the metastatic site. However, the re-emergence of the epithelial phenotype was only partial or incomplete. Expression of epithelial markers connexins 26 and/or 43 was also increased on the majority of metastases, particularly those to the brain. Despite the upregulation of epithelial markers in metastases, expression of mesenchymal markers vimentin and FSP1 was mostly unchanged. We also examined prostate carcinoma metastases of varied sizes and found that while E-cadherin expression was increased compared to the primary lesion, the expression inversely correlated with size of the metastasis. This not only suggests that a second EMT may occur in the ectopic site for tumor growth or to seed further metastases, but also provides a basis for the failure to discern epithelial phenotypes in clinically examined macrometastases. In summary, we report increased expression of epithelial markers and persistence of mesenchymal markers consistent with a partial MErT that readily allows for a second EMT at the metastatic site. Our results suggest that cancer cells continue to display phenotypic plasticity beyond the EMT that initiates metastasis.""","""['Yvonne Chao', 'Qian Wu', 'Marie Acquafondata', 'Rajiv Dhir', 'Alan Wells']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Microenviron""","""['Breast carcinoma cells re-express E-cadherin during mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transition.', 'Epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers are associated with an increased metastatic risk in primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas but are attenuated in lymph node metastases.', 'Epithelial requirement for in vitro proliferation and xenograft growth and metastasis of MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells: oncogenic rather than tumor-suppressive role of E-cadherin.', 'Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition and Circulating Tumor Cells in Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'E-cadherin as an indicator of mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transitions during the metastatic seeding of disseminated carcinomas.', 'Sorcin promotes migration in cancer and regulates the EGF-dependent EGFR signaling pathways.', 'APP deficiency and HTRA2 modulates PrPc proteostasis in human cancer cells.', 'Liver Microenvironment Response to Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Hormonal Therapy.', 'The Significance of MicroRNAs in the Molecular Pathology of Brain Metastases.', 'Association of Clinical Features of Colorectal Cancer with Circulating Tumor Cells and Systemic Inflammatory Markers.']"""

KLF2 is one of the prominent members of the family because of its diminished expression in malignancies and its growth-inhibitory, pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic roles. In this study, we show that epigenetic silencing of KLF2 occurs in cancer cells through direct transcriptional repression mediated by the Polycomb group protein Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2). Binding of EZH2 to the 5'-end of KLF2 is also associated with a gain of trimethylated lysine 27 histone H3 and a depletion of phosphorylated serine 2 of RNA polymerase. Upon depletion of EZH2 by RNA interference, short hairpin RNA or use of the small molecule 3-Deazaneplanocin A, the expression of KLF2 was restored. The transfection of KLF2 in cells with EZH2-associated silencing showed a significant anti-tumoral effect, both in culture and in xenografted nude mice. In this last setting, KLF2 transfection was also associated with decreased dissemination and lower mortality rate. In EZH2-depleted cells, which characteristically have lower tumorigenicity, the induction of KLF2 depletion 'rescued' partially the oncogenic phenotype, suggesting that KLF2 repression has an important role in EZH2 oncogenesis. Most importantly, the translation of the described results to human primary samples demonstrated that patients with prostate or breast tumors with low levels of KLF2 and high expression of EZH2 had a shorter overall survival.""","""['H Taniguchi', 'F V Jacinto', 'A Villanueva', 'A F Fernandez', 'H Yamamoto', 'F J Carmona', 'S Puertas', 'V E Marquez', 'Y Shinomura', 'K Imai', 'M Esteller']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Polycomb protein EZH2 regulates tumor invasion via the transcriptional repression of the metastasis suppressor RKIP in breast and prostate cancer.', 'Combinatorial pharmacologic approaches target EZH2-mediated gene repression in breast cancer cells.', 'Repression of E-cadherin by the polycomb group protein EZH2 in cancer.', 'Roles of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase in cancer epigenetics.', 'Epigenetic regulation of signaling pathways in cancer: role of the histone methyltransferase EZH2.', 'Krüppel-Like Factor 2 Is a Gastric Cancer Suppressor and Prognostic Biomarker.', 'EZH2/hSULF1 axis mediates receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to shape cartilage tumor progression.', 'Kruppel-like Factors in Skeletal Physiology and Pathologies.', 'Histone modification and histone modification-targeted anti-cancer drugs in breast cancer: Fundamentals and beyond.', 'Dynamical Analysis of a Boolean Network Model of the Oncogene Role of lncRNA ANRIL and lncRNA UFC1 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   In this study, we retrospectively reviewed all In-111 capromab pendetide SPECT/CT acquired at our institution for dedicated histopathology within a 4-month period. Statistical measures of performance were calculated in terms of glandular, seminal vesicle, and lymph node activity. The accuracies of glandular and seminal vesicle activity were then correlated to the indices of risk, including the stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen level, as well as the treatment history.  Results:   Of the 200 scans meeting the criteria of our study, 197 had prostate gland histopathology, 94 had bilateral seminal vesicle histopathology, and 5 had a total of 43 resected lymph nodes for comparison. The overall accuracies of the scan results were determined to be 77.7% (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.539) for the gland, 67.0% (AUC = 0.510) for the seminal vesicles, and 93.0% (AUC = 0.787) for lymph nodes. For glandular activity alone, scan accuracy was found to significantly improve with increasing Gleason score (P < 0.0001), and in a setting prior to treatment (P = 0.0005). No statistically significant differences were found between different scan groups with regards to seminal vesicle activity.

It determines to what degree one can achieve a good treatment plan in the subsequent plan optimization process. In this paper, we have developed a BOO algorithm via adaptive l(2, 1)-minimization. Specifically, we introduce a sparsity objective function term into our model which contains weighting factors for each beam angle adaptively adjusted during the optimization process. Such an objective function favors a small number of beam angles. By optimizing a total objective function consisting of a dosimetric term and the sparsity term, we are able to identify unimportant beam angles and gradually remove them without largely sacrificing the dosimetric objective. In one typical prostate case, the convergence property of our algorithm, as well as how beam angles are selected during the optimization process, is demonstrated. Fluence map optimization (FMO) is then performed based on the optimized beam angles. The resulting plan quality is presented and is found to be better than that of equiangular beam orientations. We have further systematically validated our algorithm in the contexts of 5-9 coplanar beams for five prostate cases and one head and neck case. For each case, the final FMO objective function value is used to compare the optimized beam orientations with the equiangular ones. It is found that, in the majority of cases tested, our BOO algorithm leads to beam configurations which attain lower FMO objective function values than those of corresponding equiangular cases, indicating the effectiveness of our BOO algorithm. Superior plan qualities are also demonstrated by comparing DVH curves between BOO plans and equiangular plans.""","""['Xun Jia', 'Chunhua Men', 'Yifei Lou', 'Steve B Jiang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Development of methods for beam angle optimization for IMRT using an accelerated exhaustive search strategy.', 'Spherical cluster analysis for beam angle optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Beam orientation optimization for intensity-modulated radiation therapy using mixed integer programming.', 'Improving intensity-modulated radiation therapy using the anatomic beam orientation optimization algorithm.', 'Beam angle optimization for proton therapy via group-sparsity based angle generation method.', 'A data-driven approach to optimal beam/arc angle selection for liver stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Beam Angle Optimization for Double-Scattering Proton Delivery Technique Using an Eclipse Application Programming Interface and Convolutional Neural Network.', 'SDDRO-joint: simultaneous dose and dose rate optimization with the joint use of transmission beams and Bragg peaks for FLASH proton therapy.', 'Plan optimization with L0-norm and group sparsity constraints for a new rotational, intensity-modulated brachytherapy for cervical cancer.']"""

Further, depletion of Pten results in elevated expression of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator of the cell cycle. We show that overexpression of Plk1 correlates with genetic inactivation of Pten during prostate neoplasia formation. Significantly, we find that elevated Plk1 is critical for Pten-depleted cells to adapt to mitotic stress for survival and that reintroduction of wild-type Pten into Pten-null prostate cancer cells reduces the survival dependence on Plk1. We further show that Plk1 confers the tumorigenic competence of Pten-deleted prostate cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model.

Objective:   Identify predictors of biochemical tumor control and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) outcomes for patients with clinically localized PCa treated with conformal external-beam radiotherapy (RT) as well as present an updated nomogram predicting long-term biochemical tumor control after RT.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective analysis comprised 2551 patients with clinical stages T1-T3 PCa. Median follow-up was 8 yr, extending >20 yr.  Intervention:   Prescription doses ranged from 64.8 to 86.4 Gy. A total of 1249 patients (49%) were treated with neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT); median duration of ADT was 6 mo.  Measurements:   A proportional hazards regression model predicting the probability of biochemical relapse and distant metastases after RT included pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason sum, ADT use, and radiation dose. A nomogram predicting the probability of biochemical relapse after RT was developed.  Results and limitations:   Radiation dose was one of the important predictors of long-term biochemical tumor control. Dose levels < 70.2 Gy and 70.2-79.2 Gy were associated with 2.3- and 1.3-fold increased risks of PSA relapse compared with higher doses. Improved PSA relapse-free survival (PSA-RFS) outcomes with higher doses were observed for all risk groups. Use of ADT, especially for intermediate- and high-risk patients, was associated with significantly improved biochemical tumor-control outcomes. A nomogram predicting PSA-RFS was generated and was associated with a concordance index of 0.67. T stage, Gleason score, pretreatment PSA, ADT use, and higher radiation doses were also noted to be significant predictors of improved DMFS outcomes.  Conclusions:   Higher radiation dose levels were consistently associated with improved biochemical control outcomes and reduction in distant metastases. The use of short-course ADT in conjunction with RT improved long-term PSA-RFS and DMFS in intermediate- and high-risk patients; however, an overall survival advantage was not observed.""","""['Michael J Zelefsky', 'Xin Pei', 'Joanne F Chou', 'Michael Schechter', 'Marisa Kollmeier', 'Brett Cox', 'Yoshiya Yamada', 'Anthony Fidaleo', 'Dahlia Sperling', 'Laura Happersett', 'Zhigang Zhang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer: a plea for high-dose, high-precision intensity-modulated radiotherapy with a modulated duration of androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Biochemical response to androgen deprivation therapy before external beam radiation therapy predicts long-term prostate cancer survival outcomes.', 'The natural history and predictors of outcome following biochemical relapse in the dose escalation era for prostate cancer patients undergoing definitive external beam radiotherapy.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Systematic study of the iodinated rectal hydrogel spacer material discrepancy on accuracy of proton dosimetry.', 'Dose-escalated radiotherapy to 82\xa0Gy for prostate cancer following insertion of a peri-rectal hydrogel spacer: 3-year outcomes from a phase II trial.', 'Dosimetric feasibility of moderately hypofractionated/dose escalated radiation therapy for localised prostate cancer with intensity-modulated proton beam therapy using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB-IMPT) and impact of hydrogel prostate-rectum spacer.', 'Mixed-Beam Approach for High-Risk Prostate Cancer Carbon-Ion Boost Followed by Photon Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy: Preliminary Results of Phase II Trial AIRC-IG-14300.', 'Use of a Biodegradable, Contrast-Filled Rectal Spacer Balloon in Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Dosimetric Gains in the BioPro-RCMI-1505 Study.']"""

We have retrospectively analyzed 24 patients treated with IMRT. Five were selected within each of the following regions: head and neck, thoracic, abdomen, and prostate. Four patients were optimized within the brain region. The clinically treated plans were re-optimized using Philips Pinnacle3 v. 8 with the direct machine parameter optimization algorithm. The number of segments per beam from the treated plan was systematically reduced by 80%, 60%, 40%, and 30%, and the following statistics have been analyzed for plan quality: target min, mean, and max doses; critical structure doses; and integral dose. We have attempted to define the smallest number of segments per beam for IMRT treatment plans. Results indicate that IMRT plans can be delivered with acceptable quality with approximately 3-6 segments per beam for the anatomical regions analyzed. A reduction in the number of segments decreases treatment delivery time, reduces machine wear and tear, and minimizes the amount of time the patient is on the treatment table, which in turn reduces the chances of intrafractional uncertainties.""","""['Jordan Sutton', 'David Kabiru', 'Michael Neu', 'Lehendrick Turner', 'Peter Balter', 'Matthew Palmer']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Comparison of IMRT planning with two-step and one-step optimization: a way to simplify IMRT.', 'Clinical evaluation of direct aperture optimization when applied to head-and-neck IMRT.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'The IMRT information process-mastering the degrees of freedom in external beam therapy.', 'Optimization and clinical use of multisegment intensity-modulated radiation therapy for high-dose conformal therapy.', 'Head and neck radiotherapy on the MR linac: a\xa0multicenter planning challenge amongst MRIdian platform users.', 'Three-dimensional conformal planning with low-segment multicriteria intensity modulated radiation therapy optimization.']"""

Results:   In BPH and PC samples, immunoexpressions were observed for NF-κBp65 and NF-κBp50; while in NP samples, only were detected NF-κBp50. PC samples showed immunoreactions to NF-κBp65 and NF-κBp50 more intense (respectively 24.18±0.67 and 28.23±2.01) than that observed in BPH samples (respectively18.46±2.04 and 18.66±1.59) with special localisation in the nucleus.

Methods:   From 1992 to 2007, 2168 (395 age ≤ 60) men received conformal RT alone for prostate cancer at our institution (median dose=76 Gy, range: 72-80). Multivariable analysis (MVA) was used to identify significant predictors for BF and PCSM. Cumulative incidence was estimated using the competing risk method (Fine and Gray) for BF (Phoenix definition) and PCSM to account for the competing risk of death.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 72.2 months (range: 24.0-205.1), 8-year BF was 27.1% for age ≤ 60 vs. 23.7% for age >60 (p=0.29). Eight-year PCSM was 3.0% for age ≤ 60 vs. 2.0% for age >60 (p=0.52).

Given the large doses delivered, it is critical that the volume treated matches that planned. Our outpatient protocol comprises two 9 Gy fractions, two weeks apart. We prospectively assessed catheter displacement between CT planning and treatment delivery.  Materials and methods:   Three fiducial markers and the catheters were implanted under transrectal ultrasound guidance. Metal marker wires were inserted into 4 reference catheters before CT; marker positions relative to each other and to the marker wires were measured from the CT scout. Measurements were repeated immediately prior to treatment delivery using pelvic X-ray with marker wires in the same reference catheters. Measurements from CT scout and film were compared. For displacements of 5mm or more, indexer positions were adjusted prior to treatment delivery.  Results:   Results are based on 48 implants, in 25 patients. Median time from planning CT to treatment delivery was 254 min (range 81-367 min). Median catheter displacement was 7.5mm (range -2.9-23.9 mm), 67% of implants had displacement of 5mm or greater. Displacements were predominantly caudal.  Conclusions:   Catheter displacement can occur in the 1-3h between the planning CT scan and treatment.

We analyzed PCa characteristics and behavior among low income uninsured men, and compare them to high income patients with health insurance in a developing country.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective case-control study was performed on 934 patients with clinically localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy between March, 1999 and July, 2009. Patients were divided in two groups, according to their SES. In group 1 (n =380), all had low income, low educational levels and couldn ' t afford medical insurance. In group 2 (n =554), all had higher income, higher education and had medical insurance.  Results:   Patients from group 1 were older, had higher Gleason scores, higher rates of seminal vesicle and bladder neck involvement. The Kaplan Meier disease-free survival curve demonstrated that after a follow-up of four years, about 50% of uninsured patients had biochemical recurrence, versus 21% of insured patients (Log rank test: p < 0.001). A multivariate Cox regression analysis for the risk of disease recurrence demonstrated that only PSA levels, Gleason score, seminal vesicle involvement and SES were statistically significant variables. Patients with a low SES presented 1.8 times the risk of recurrence as compared to patients with a high SES.  Conclusions:   Patients with low SES were older, presented more aggressive PCa characteristics and a high rate of disease recurrence.

The open straddle is 0.53 m and fits most OR tables. We performed 7 pelvic laparoscopy cases with the 1st generation ETHOS™ platform including 2 laparoscopic ureteral reimplantations, 5 laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomies for staging prostate cancer in which one case involved a laparoscopic radical retropubic prostatectomy, performed by 2 different surgeons.  Results:   All 7 pelvic laparoscopic procedures were successful with the ETHOS™ chair. No conversion to open surgery was necessary. Survey done by surgeons after the procedures revealed minimal stress on back or upper extremities by the surgeons from these operations even when surgery was longer than 120 minutes. Conversely, the surgical assistants still had issues with their positions since they were on either sides of the patient stressing their positions during the procedure.  Conclusion:   The ETHOS chair system allows the surgeon to operate seated in comfortable position with ergonomic chest, arms, and back supports. These supports minimize surgeon fatigue and discomfort during pelvic laparoscopic procedures even when these procedures are longer than 120 minutes without consequence to the patient safety or detrimental effects to the surgical team.""","""['Fernando J Kim', 'David E Sehrt', 'Wilson R Molina', 'Jung-Sik Huh', 'Jens Rassweiler', 'Craig Turner']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Direct comparison of the different conventional laparoscopic positions with the ethos surgical platform in a laparoscopic pelvic surgery simulation setting.', 'Combining of ETHOS Operating Ergonomic Platform, Three-dimensional Laparoscopic Camera, and Radius Surgical System Manipulators Improves Ergonomy in Urologic Laparoscopy: Comparison with Conventional Laparoscopy and da Vinci in a Pelvi Trainer.', 'Effect of chair types on work-related musculoskeletal discomfort during vaginal surgery.', 'Building a framework for ergonomic research on laparoscopic instrument handles.', 'Future developments and perspectives in laparoscopy.', 'Unpacking the Broad Landscape of Intraoperative Stressors for Clinical Personnel: A Mixed-Methods Systematic Review.', 'The burden of performing minimal access surgery: ergonomics survey results from 462 surgeons across Germany, the UK and the USA.']"""

Peptides are a new-generation of drug-delivery vector to increase efficacy of this therapy and avoid the resulting damage. The cytotoxic somatostatin (SST) conjugate JF-10-81 was developed by coupling camptothecin (CPT) to the N-terminus of a SST analog (JF-07-69) using an activated carbamate linker. This conjugate selectively targets somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) and also retains high binding affinity and rapid internalization as well as anti-proliferative activity towards various tumor cells. JF-10-81 was tested for its inhibitory activity against the growth of human tumors which included neuroblastoma (IMR32), pancreatic cancer (CFPAC-1), leukemia (MOLT-4), pancreatic carcinoid (BON) and prostate cancer (PC-3). Both SSTR2 mRNAs and proteins were detected in all these tumor cell lines. The conjugate displayed potent in vivo inhibitory activity, although some of the potency measured in in vitro experiments was lost. JF-10-81 was found to significantly inhibit growth of these SSTR-positive tumors, resulting in 87% tumor reduction in neuroblastoma IMR32 and 97% in leukemia MOLT-4 bearing animals, even inducing regression of CFPAC-1 tumors. SSTR-overexpressing BON tumors were unfortunately relatively CPT-insensitive in vitro, however, JF-10-81 again exhibited in vivo potency presumably by specifically increasing CPT concentrations inside the tumor cells so that the inhibition rate for JF-10-81 was 85%. Also, JF-10-81 was used to treat highly invasive PC-3 tumors where s.c. injections inhibited both tumor growth (almost 60% reduction) and tumor metastasis (over 70%). This conjugate demonstrated its broad and excellent anti-tumor activity by targeting SSTR2-specific tumor tissues, supporting that short peptides and their analogs may be applied as ideal drug-delivery carriers to improve the traditional chemotherapy.""","""['Li-Chun Sun', 'L Vienna Mackey', 'Jing Luo', 'Joseph A Fuselier', 'David H Coy']""","""[]""","""2008""","""None""","""Clin Med Oncol""","""['Effects of camptothecin conjugated to a somatostatin analog vector on growth of tumor cell lines in culture and related tumors in rodents.', 'Somatostatin receptor-targeted anti-cancer therapy.', 'Investigation of cancer cell lines for peptide receptor-targeted drug development.', 'A conjugate of camptothecin and a somatostatin analog against prostate cancer cell invasion via a possible signaling pathway involving PI3K/Akt, alphaVbeta3/alphaVbeta5 and MMP-2/-9.', 'Somatostatin analogs and radiopeptides in cancer therapy.', 'Click Chemistry and Multicomponent Reaction for Linker Diversification of Zinc Dipicolylamine-Based Drug Conjugates.', 'Synthesis and preliminary evaluation of octreotate conjugates of bioactive synthetic amatoxins for targeting somatostatin receptor (sstr2) expressing cells.', 'Peptide-Drug Conjugates with Different Linkers for Cancer Therapy.', 'Peptide-Drug Conjugates and Their Targets in Advanced Cancer Therapies.', 'Smart Targeting To Improve Cancer Therapeutics.']"""

Objectives:   The objective of this study is to describe health status, levels of anxiety and depression, unmet supportive care needs and positive outcomes in the partners/family members of breast, prostate and colorectal cancer survivors 5-16 years post-diagnosis.  Methods:   Patients in a linked study were asked to invite a partner or other close family member to complete a self-administered postal questionnaire. Data were analysed by cancer site and time since diagnosis. Matched comparisons were made between cancer patients in the linked study and their partners.  Results:   An expression of interest was received from 330 partners/family members, and 257 questionnaires (77.9%) were returned. Health status and levels of anxiety and depression were comparable with population norms. Respondents reported an average of 2.7 unmet needs from 34 possible options. Hospital parking, information about familial risk, help managing fear of recurrence and coordination of care were the most cited unmet needs. There was little variation in health status, psychological morbidity and unmet needs by cancer site or time since diagnosis. Concordance between patients and partners was low for anxiety but higher with respect to positive outcomes and some unmet needs.  Conclusions:   Most partners/family members of long-term cancer survivors report few ongoing issues. However, a small proportion (<10%) have high levels of anxiety and/or moderate or strong unmet needs.

Differences in uptake of screening related to socio-economic status exist and may contribute to differences in morbidity and mortality across socio-economic groups. Although a number of factors are likely to underlie differential uptake, differential access to subsequent diagnostic tests and/or treatment may have a pivotal role. This study examines differences in the uptake of cancer screening in Ireland related to socio-economic status. Data were extracted from SLÁN 2007 concerning uptake of breast, cervical, colorectal and prostate cancer screening in the preceding 12 months. Concentration indices were calculated and decomposed. Particular emphasis was placed in the decomposition upon the impact of private health insurance, evidenced in other work to impact on access to care within the mixed public-private Irish health system. This study found that significant differences related to socio-economic status exist with respect to uptake of cancer screening and that the main determinant of difference for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer screening was possession of private insurance.

The goal of this study was to evaluate genetic vaccine encoding SSX-2 to prioritize human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-specific epitopes and determine if a DNA vaccine can elicit SSX-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) capable of lysing prostate cancer cells. HLA-A2-restricted epitopes were identified based on their in vitro binding affinity for HLA-A2 and by the ability of a genetic vaccine to elicit peptide-specific CTL in A2/DR1 (HLA-A2.1+/HLA-DR1+/H-2 class I-/class II-knockout) transgenic mice. We found that SSX-2 peptides p41-49 (KASEKIFYV) and p103-111 (RLQGISPKI) had high affinity for HLA-A2 and were immunogenic in vivo; however, peptide p103-111 was immunodominant with robust peptide-specific immune responses elicited in mice vaccinated with a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding SSX-2. Furthermore, p103-111-specific CTLs were able to lyse an HLA-A2+ prostate cancer cell line. The immunodominance of this epitope was found not to be due to a putative HLA-DR1 epitope (p98-112) flanking p103-111. Finally, we demonstrated that SSX-2 epitope-specific CTLs could be detected and cultured from the peripheral blood of HLA-A2+ prostate cancer patients, notably patients with advanced prostate cancer. Overall, we conclude that SSX-2 peptide p103-111 is an immunodominant HLA-A2-restricted epitope, and epitope-specific CD8 T cells can be detected in patients with prostate cancer, suggesting that tolerance to SSX-2 can be circumvented in vivo.

STS may be considered a new promising drug target for treating estrogen-mediated carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of STS expression is not well-known. To investigate whether tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is able to regulate gene transcription of STS, we studied the effect of TNF-α on STS expression in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that TNF-α significantly induced the expression of STS mRNA and protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with TNF-α resulted in a strong increase in the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 and when cells were treated with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors such as LY294002 or wortmannin, or Akt inhibitor (Akt inhibitor IV), induction of STS mRNA expression by TNF-α was significantly prevented. Moreover, activation of Akt1 by expressing the constitutively active form of Akt1 increased STS expression whereas dominant-negative Akt suppressed TNF-α-mediated STS induction. We also found that TNF-α is able to increase STS mRNA expression in other human cancer cells such as LNCaP, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 as well as PC-3 cells.

We determined: bone mineral density by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, bone turnover markers, serum levels of sex steroids and osteoprotegerin, and prevalent radiographic vertebral fractures. Serum OPG levels were higher in patients with vertebral fractures (8.02 ± 2.0 vs 4.91 ± 0.28 pmol/L; P < .05). OPG level and the duration of hormonal therapy were related (r = 0.299, P = .004), but this association did not persist after adjustment for age. In patients without androgen deprivation therapy, serum OPG levels were correlated with the levels of total testosterone (r = 0.508, P = .001) and bioavailable testosterone (r = 0.311, P = .037). In patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy, serum OPG levels were correlated with levels of total estradiol (r = 0.199, P = .18), bioavailable estradiol (r = 0.37, P = .009), and free estradiol (r = 0.349, P = .016). In conclusion, in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy, serum OPG levels were correlated with the levels of total estradiol, bioavailable estradiol, and free estradiol.

We hypothesized that global deletion of Igfbp1 would accelerate the development of prostate cancer in a c-Myc transgenic mouse model. To test our hypothesis, c-Myc transgenic mice (Myc/BP-1 wild-type (WT)) were crossed and interbred with the Igfbp1 knockout mice (Myc/BP-1 KO). The animals were placed on a high-protein diet at weaning, weighed every 2 weeks, and euthanized at 16 weeks of age. Prostate histopathology was assessed and proliferation status was determined by Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen analyses. IGF-related serum biomarkers and body composition were measured. No significant difference in the incidence of prostate cancer was observed between the Myc/BP-1 KO and the Myc/BP-1 WT mice (65 and 80% respectively, P=0.48). Proliferation was significantly decreased by 71% in prostate tissue of Myc/BP-1 KO mice compared with Myc/BP-1 WT mice. Myc/BP-1 KO mice exhibited a significant 6.7% increase in body weight relative to the Myc/BP-1 WT mice that was attributed to an increase in fat mass. Fasting insulin levels were higher in the Myc/BP-1 KO mice without any difference between the groups in fasting glucose concentrations. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, global deletion of Igfbp1 in a c-Myc transgenic mouse model did not accelerate the development of prostate cancer.

Enhancing tumor radiosensitivity could both reduce the amount of radiation required for definitive treatment and improve clinical outcome. Androgen suppression therapy improves clinical outcomes when combined with radiation therapy but is associated with significant acute and chronic toxicities; hence, there is a clear need for alternative means to increase the therapeutic window of radiotherapy. Herein, it is demonstrated that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors rapamycin (sirolimus) and temsirolimus limit both hormone therapy (HT)-sensitive and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cell proliferation as single agents and have a profound radiosensitization effect when used in combination with IR. Importantly, the observed radiosensitization was influenced by the treatment schedule, in which adjuvant administration of mTOR inhibitors was most effective in limiting PCa cell population doubling. This schedule-dependent influence on in vitro treatment outcome was determined to be the result of relative effects on the cell cycle kinetics.

However, radioresistance that contributes to recurrence remains a major therapeutic problem in many patients. In this study, we define the high-affinity neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) as a tractable new molecular target to radiosensitize prostate cancers. The selective NTR1 antagonist SR48692 sensitized prostate cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, increasing apoptotic cell death and decreasing clonogenic survival. The observed cancer selectivity for combinations of SR48692 and radiation reflected differential expression of NTR1, which is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells but not in normal prostate epithelial cells. Radiosensitization was not affected by androgen dependence or androgen receptor expression status. NTR1 inhibition in cancer cell-attenuated epidermal growth factor receptor activation and downstream signaling, whether induced by neurotensin or ionizing radiation, establish a molecular mechanism for sensitization. Most notably, SR48692 efficiently radiosensitized PC-3M orthotopic human tumor xenografts in mice, and significantly reduced tumor burden.

Although SSeCKS and PKCα bind phosphatidylserine, we demonstrate that phosphatidylserine-independent binding of PKC by SSeCKS is facilitated by two homologous SSeCKS motifs, EG(I/V)(T/S)XWXSFK(K/R)(M/L)VTP(K/R)K(K/R)X(K/R)XXXEXXXE(E/D) (amino acids 592-620 and 741-769). SSeCKS binding to PKCα decreased kinase activity and was dependent on the two PKC-binding motifs. SSeCKS scaffolding of PKC was increased in confluent cell cultures, correlating with significantly increased SSeCKS protein levels and decreased PKCα activity, suggesting a role for SSeCKS in suppressing PKC activation during contact inhibition. SSeCKS-null mouse embryo fibroblasts displayed increased relative basal and phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate)-induced PKC activity but were defective in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization and cell shape change; these responses could be rescued by the forced expression of full-length SSeCKS but not by an SSeCKS variant deleted of its PKC-binding domains. Finally, the PKC binding sites in SSeCKS were required to restore cell rounding and/or decreased apoptosis in phorbol ester-treated LNCaP, LNCaP-C4-2, and MAT-LyLu prostate cancer cells.

To provide insight into the beneficial effect of gold markers, the influence on treatment volume and radiation doses to healthy tissues was investigated.  Patients and methods:   Three consecutive treatment margins were constructed, for 10 patients with localized prostate cancer, to show the reduction of planning target volume (PTV): PTV 10 mm (no markers), PTV 7 mm (markers), and PTV 7/5 mm (markers and online correction).

Methods:   This qualitative study was made up of four focus group interviews (elderly persons, users of health support groups, students, and rural inhabitants). Participants were asked to report their perceptions of decision making in three written clinical scenarios (hypertension, breast cancer, prostate cancer). The analysis was based on the principles of grounded theory.  Results:   Most patients perceived decision making as shared decision making, a deliberative question-response interaction with the physician that allowed patients to be experts in obtaining clearer information, participating in the care process, and negotiating compromises with physician preferences. Requesting second opinions allowed patients to maintain control, even within the paternalistic model preferred by elderly persons. Facilitating factors (trust, qualitative non-verbal communication, time to think) and obstacles (serious/emergency situations, perceived inadequate scientific competence, problems making requests, fear of knowing) were also part of shared decision making.

Thus, to address the mechanism of AR-mediated neoplastic transformation, we developed in vitro methodology to isolate and characterize, via mass spectrometry, AR complexes of three AR genetic variants: wild type-AR, and two somatic gain-of-function AR prostatic mutants (T877A-AR and 0CAG-AR isoforms).

We observed significant associations between plasma testosterone level and SNPs in HSD17B2 (rs1424151), HSD17B3 (rs9409407), and HSD17B1 (rs12602084), with P values of 0.002, 0.006, and 0.006, respectively. We also observed borderline significant associations between prostate aggressiveness at diagnosis and SNPs in AKR1C1 (rs11252845; P = 0.005), UGT2B15 (rs2045100; P = 0.007), and HSD17B12 (rs7932905; P = 0.008). No individual SNP was associated with both clinical variables. Genetic variants of genes in hormone metabolic pathways may influence plasma androgen levels or prostate cancer aggressiveness.

In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), FoxA1 acts as an androgen receptor cofactor to drive G₂ to M-phase cell-cycle transit. Here, we describe a mechanistically distinct SR-independent role for FoxA1 in driving G₁ to S-phase cell-cycle transit in CRPC. By comparing FoxA1 binding sites in prostate cancer cell genomes, we defined a codependent set of FoxA1-MYBL2 and FoxA1-CREB1 binding sites within the regulatory regions of the Cyclin E2 and E2F1 genes that are critical for CRPC growth. Binding at these sites upregulate the Cyclin E2 and Cyclin A2 genes in CRPC but not in earlier stage androgen-dependent prostate cancer, establishing a stage-specific role for this pathway in CRPC growth. Mechanistic investigations indicated that FoxA1, MYBL2, or CREB1 induction of histone H3 acetylation facilitated nucleosome disruption as the basis for codependent transcriptional activation and G₁ to S-phase cell-cycle transit.

Especially, the potassium channel K(V)10.1 (Ether-á-go-go) is attractive as target since this surface protein is virtually not detected in normal tissue outside the central nervous system, but is expressed in approximately 70% of tumors from different origins.  Methods:   We designed a single-chain antibody against an extracellular region of K(V)10.1 (scFv62) and fused it to the human soluble TRAIL. The K(V)10.1-specific scFv62 antibody -TRAIL fusion protein was expressed in CHO-K1 cells, purified by chromatography and tested for biological activity.  Results:   Prostate cancer cells, either positive or negative for K(V)10.1 were treated with the purified construct. After sensitization with cytotoxic drugs, scFv62-TRAIL induced apoptosis only in K(V)10.1-positive cancer cells, but not in non-tumor cells, nor in tumor cells lacking K(V)10.1 expression. In co-cultures with K(V)10.1-positive cancer cells the fusion protein also induced apoptosis in bystander K(V)10.1-negative cancer cells, while normal prostate epithelial cells were not affected when present as bystander.

There is considerable uncertainty in prostate epithelial biology where both basal and luminal stem cells have been described, and in this study the clonal relationships within the human prostate epithelial cell layers were explored by tracing stem cell fate. Fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed histologically-benign prostate samples from 35 patients were studied using sequential cytochrome c oxidase (COX)/succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme histochemistry and COX subunit I immunofluorescence to identify areas of respiratory chain deficiency; mtDNA mutations were identified by whole mitochondrial genome sequencing of laser-captured areas. We demonstrated that cells with respiratory chain defects due to somatic mtDNA point mutations were present in prostate epithelia and clonally expand in acini. Lineage tracing revealed distinct patterning of stem cell fate with mtDNA mutations spreading throughout the whole acinus or, more commonly, present as mosaic acinar defects. This suggests that individual acini are typically generated from multiple stem cells, and the presence of whole COX-deficient acini suggests that a single stem cell can also generate an entire branching acinar subunit of the gland.

Here, we apply lineage tracing to visualize the clonal progeny of stem cells in benign and malignant human prostates and understand the clonal architecture of this epithelium. Cells deficient for the mitochondrially-encoded enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) were identified in 27 frozen prostatectomy specimens using dual colour enzyme histochemistry and individual CCO-normal and -deficient cell areas were laser-capture microdissected. PCR-sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) of cells from CCO-deficient areas found to share mtDNA mutations not present in adjacent CCO-normal cells, thus proving a clonal origin. Immunohistochemistry was performed to visualize the three cell lineages normally present in the prostatic epithelium. Entire CCO-deficient acini, and part-deficient acini were found. Deficient patches spanned either basal or luminal cells, but sometimes also both epithelial cell types in normal, hyperplastic or atrophic epithelium, and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Patches comprising both PIN and invasive cancer were observed. Each cell area within a CCO-deficient patch contained an identical mtDNA mutation, defining the patch as a clonal unit. CCO-deficient patches in benign epithelium contained basal, luminal and endocrine cells, demonstrating multilineage differentiation and therefore the presence of a stem cell. Our results demonstrate that the normal, atrophic, hypertrophic and atypical (PIN) epithelium of human prostate contains stem cell-derived clonal units that actively replenish the epithelium during ageing. These deficient areas usually included the basal compartment indicating the basal layer as the location of the stem cell. Importantly, single clonal units comprised both PIN and invasive cancer, supporting PIN as the pre-invasive lesion for prostate cancer.""","""['Nadine T Gaisa', 'Trevor A Graham', 'Stuart Ac McDonald', 'Richard Poulsom', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'Gerhard Jakse', 'Ruth Knuechel', 'Nicholas A Wright']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['The human urothelium consists of multiple clonal units, each maintained by a stem cell.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Focal degeneration of basal cells and the resultant auto-immunoreactions: a novel mechanism for prostate tumor progression and invasion.', 'In situ lineage tracking of human prostatic epithelial stem cell fate reveals a common clonal origin for basal and luminal cells.', 'New aspects in histogenesis of hyperplasia and cancers of the prostate.', 'The most effective but largely ignored target for prostate cancer early detection and intervention.', 'Lineage tracing in human tissues.', 'Fluctuating methylation clocks for cell lineage tracing at high temporal resolution in human tissues.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'Heterogeneity and complexity of the prostate epithelium: New findings from single-cell RNA sequencing studies.']"""

However, the critical issues associated with RNAi as a therapeutic are delivery, specificity, and stability of the RNAi reagents. To date, the delivery is currently considered the biggest hurdle, as the introduction of siRNAs systemically into body fluids can result in their degradation, off-target effects, and immune detection.

Here, we assessed the role of MCs in prostate tumor development. In prostate tumors from both tumor-prone transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice and human patients, MCs are specifically enriched and degranulated in areas of well-differentiated (WD) adenocarcinoma but not around poorly differentiated (PD) foci that coexist in the same tumors. We derived novel TRAMP tumor cell lines, representative of WD and PD variants, and through pharmacologic stabilization or genetic ablation of MCs in recipients mice, we showed that MCs promote WD adenocarcinoma growth but are dispensable for PD tumors. WD tumors rely on MCs for matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) provision, as reconstitution of MC-deficient mice with wild-type but not MMP-9(-/-) MCs was sufficient to promote their growth. In contrast, PD tumors are MMP-9 self-competent, consistently with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Such a dual source of MMP-9 was confirmed in human tumors, suggesting that MCs could be a good target for early-stage prostate cancer. Interestingly, in testing whether MC targeting could block or delay tumorigenesis in tumor-prone TRAMP mice, we observed a high incidence of early and aggressive tumors, characterized by a neuroendocrine (NE) signature and c-Kit expression. Taken together, these data underscore the contribution of MCs in tumor progression and uncover a new, opposite role of MCs in protecting against the occurrence of aggressive NE variants in prostate cancer.""","""['Paola Pittoni', 'Claudio Tripodo', 'Silvia Piconese', 'Giorgio Mauri', 'Mariella Parenza', 'Alice Rigoni', 'Sabina Sangaletti', 'Mario P Colombo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['A probasin-large T antigen transgenic mouse line develops prostate adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastatic potential.', 'Utilization of bone marrow-derived endothelial cell precursors in spontaneous prostate tumors varies with tumor grade.', 'Genistein in the diet reduces the incidence of poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma in transgenic mice (TRAMP).', 'The dark side of mast cell-targeted therapy in prostate cancer.', 'The role of mast cells in neuroinflammation.', 'Mast Cells as a Target-A Comprehensive Review of Recent Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.', 'Characterization of the immune cell landscape in CRC: Clinical implications of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes in early- and late-stage CRC.', 'Dual Effect of Immune Cells within Tumour Microenvironment: Pro- and Anti-Tumour Effects and Their Triggers.', 'Mast Cell-Tumor Interactions: Molecular Mechanisms of Recruitment, Intratumoral Communication and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Tumor Growth.']"""

Some recent studies shows that prohibitin is overexpressed in cells expressing HCV core proteins, and up-regulated prohibitin is also found in human hepatoma cell line HCC-M, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and other cancers. Prohibitin is an important member of the membrane protein superfamily, and it plays a role of molecular chaperones in mitochondrial protein stability. Meanwhile, it has a permissive action on tumor growth or acts as an oncosuppressor. Based on our previously established the in vitro HCV cell-culture system (HCVcc), here we aimed to investigate the different expression profiles of prohibitin in Huh-7-HCV and Huh-7.5-HCV cells  Methods:   The total cellular RNA of Huh-7, Huh-7.5, Huh-7-HCV and Huh-7.5-HCV cells were extracted, and then the first-strand cDNA was reversely transcribed. The expression of prohibitin at the mRNA level was assessed by real-time PCR with GAPDH as the control. Furthermore, the expression of prohibitin at the protein level was evaluated by western blot with GAPDH as an internal control.  Results:   Our results of real-time PCR showed that the mRNA expression level of prohibitin in Huh-7-HCV cells was 2.09 times higher than that in Huh-7 cells, while, the mRNA level of prohibitin in Huh-7.5-HCV cells was 2.25 times higher than that in Huh-7.5 cells. The results of western blot showed that the protein expression level of prohibitin in Huh-7-HCV cells was 2.38 times higher than that in Huh-7 cells, while the protein expression of prohibitin in Huh-7.5-HCV cells was 2.29 times higher than that in Huh-7.5 cells.

Results:   Infection and replication of XMRV was seen in a variety of GHOST cells, LNCaP, DU145, A549 and Caski cell lines. The levels of XMRV replication varied in different cell lines showing differential replication in different cell lines.

Results:   • In all, 684 consecutive patients with Gleason score 6 or 7 prostate cancer on diagnostic biopsy were identified. • Of 298 patients diagnosed with Gleason 6 tumour on biopsy, 201 (67.4%) were upgraded to Gleason 7 or higher on final pathology. Similarly, of 262 patients diagnosed with Gleason 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer on initial biopsy, 60 (22.9%) were upgraded to Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 or higher. • Tumours upgraded from Gleason 6 to 7 had a significantly lower index tumour volume (1.73 vs 2 mL, P= 0.029), higher calculated prostate volume (41.6 vs 39 mL, P= 0.017) and lower relative percentage of tumour to benign glandular tissue (4.3% vs 5.9%, P= 0.001) than tumours concordant for the higher grade. • Similarly, tumours that were Gleason score 3 + 4 on biopsy and upgraded on final pathology to 4 + 3 were significantly smaller as measured by both total tumour volume (2.3 vs 3.3 mL, P= 0.005) and index tumour volume (2.2 vs 3, P= 0.027) and occupied a smaller percentage of the gland volume (6.3% vs 8.9%, P= 0.017) compared with tumours concordant for the higher grade. • On multivariate analysis, lower prostate weight (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.96-0.99, P < 0.001) and larger total tumour volume (hazard ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.6, P < 0.001) independently predicted an upgrade in Gleason score from 6 to 7.

Conclusions:   • Under-graded tumours are significantly smaller than tumours concordant for the higher grade, indicating that incomplete tumour sampling plays a significant role in Gleason score assignment error. • Surrogate measures of tumour volume may predict those at greatest risk of Gleason score upgrade.""","""['Niall M Corcoran', 'Chris M Hovens', 'Matthew K H Hong', 'John Pedersen', 'Rowan G Casey', 'Stephen Connolly', 'Justin Peters', 'Laurence Harewood', 'Martin E Gleave', 'S Larry Goldenberg', 'Anthony J Costello']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Upgrade in Gleason score between prostate biopsies and pathology following radical prostatectomy significantly impacts upon the risk of biochemical recurrence.', 'Extended prostate biopsy scheme improves reliability of Gleason grading: implications for radiotherapy patients.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Level of Evidence 4. What's known on the subject? And what does the study add? Multifocality, age, PSA values, and biopsy protocols regarding the predictive value of high grade PIN have been discussed extensively in the literature. Our study developed for the first time a predictive nomogram that could be helpful for patient counselling and to guide the urologist to perform rPBX after an initial diagnosis of isolated HGPIN.  Objective:   • To evaluate factors that may predict prostate cancer (PCa) detection after the initial diagnosis of high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) on prostate biopsy (PBx) with six to 24 random cores.  Patients and methods:   • We retrospectively evaluated 262 patients submitted from 1998 to 2007 to prostate re-biopsy (rPBx) after an initial HGPIN diagnosis in tertiary academic centres. • HGPIN diagnosis was obtained on initial systematic PBx with six to 24 random cores. • All patients were re-biopsied with a 'saturation' rPBx with 20-26 cores, with a median time to rPBx of 12 months. • All slides were reviewed by expert uropathologists.  Results:   • Plurifocal HGPIN (pHGPIN) was found in 115 patients and monofocal HGPIN (mHGPIN) was found in 147 patients. • In total, 108 and 154 patients, respectively, were submitted to >12-core initial PBx and ≤12-core initial PBx. • Overall PCa detection at rPBx was 31.7%. PSA level (7.7 vs 6.6 ng/mL; P= 0.031) and age (68 vs 64 years; P= 0.001) were significantly higher in patients with PCa at rPBx. • PCa detection was significantly higher in patients with a ≤12-core initial PBx than in those with a >12-core initial PBx (37.6% vs 23.1%; P= 0.01), as well as in patients with pHGPIN than in those with mHGPIN (40% vs 25.1%; P= 0.013). • At multivariable analysis, PSA level (P= 0.041; hazards ratio, HR, 1.08), age (P < 0.001; HR, 1.09), pHGPIN (P= 0.031; HR, 1.97) and ≤12-core initial PBx (P= 0.012; HR, 1.95) were independent predictors of PCa detection. • A nomogram including these four variables achieved 72% accuracy for predicting PCa detection after an initial HGPIN diagnosis.  Conclusions:   • PCa detection on saturation rPBx after an initial diagnosis of HGPIN is significantly higher in patients with a ≤12-core initial PBx than those with a >12-core initial PBx and in patients with pHGPIN than in those with mHGPIN. • We developed a simple prognostic tool for the prediction of PCa detection in patients with initial HGPIN diagnosis who were undergoing saturation rPBx.""","""['Marco Roscigno', 'Vincenzo Scattoni', 'Massimo Freschi', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Carmen Maccagnano', 'Andrea Galosi', 'Vito Lacetera', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Giovanni Muzzonigro', 'Federico Deho', 'Gianfranco Deiana', 'Domenico Belussi', 'Daniela Chinaglia', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Luigi F Da Pozzo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Diagnosis of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: the impact of the number of biopsy cores at initial sampling on cancer detection after a saturation re-biopsy.', 'The incidence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and atypical glands suspicious for carcinoma on first-time saturation needle biopsy, and the subsequent risk of cancer.', 'Low testosterone level predicts prostate cancer in re-biopsy in patients with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: its morphological and molecular diagnosis and clinical significance.', 'In situ and intraductal epithelial proliferations of prostate: definitions and treatment implications.

The decision to pursue radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer is often influenced by factors outside the realm of tumour risk, such as a man's support system at home.  Patients and methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of 418 low-income men who were diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer and underwent definitive treatment with either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. We performed univariate and multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression analysis, with the dependent variable being treatment type. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the predicted probabilities and relative risks were derived using bias-corrected bootstrapping with 1000 repetitions.  Results:   Men with two or more members in their support system were more likely to be older, Hispanic, have less than a high school education, earn more than US $1500 monthly, have high-risk disease and be in a significant relationship. In multivariate analysis, partnered men with fewer than two social support members (relative risk, RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.63) were more likely to undergo surgery, whereas men who were morbidly obese (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.09-0.88), high school graduates (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64-0.99) or had high-risk disease (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.85) were less likely to undergo surgery than their respective referent groups. Partnered men with two or more social support members were no more likely to undergo surgery than unpartnered men who lacked any social support.  Conclusions:   In the present study cohort, married men with fewer than two members in their social network were more likely to have undergone surgery. Although marital status is often used as a proxy for social support, we find that the quality of support and partner may impact treatment type more than the extent of the social matrix.""","""['Karim Chamie', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Sarah E Connor', 'Mary Zavala', 'Jessica Labo', 'Mark S Litwin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Partnership and outcomes in men with prostate cancer.', 'Five-year outcomes after prostatectomy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer: the prostate cancer outcomes study.', 'Partnership status influences quality of life in low-income, uninsured men with prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer outcomes among older men: insurance status comparisons results from CaPSURE database.', 'Long-term survival probability in men with clinically localized prostate cancer treated either conservatively or with definitive treatment (radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy).', 'Living alone as a risk factor for cancer incidence, case-fatality and all-cause mortality: A nationwide registry study.', 'The association of marital status and mortality among men with early-stage prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: insight into post-prostatectomy survival strategies.', 'Social Support and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Gay and Bisexual Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Is ""Active Surveillance"" an Acceptable Alternative?: A Qualitative Study of Couples\' Decision Making about Early-Stage, Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Variation in prostate cancer treatment associated with population density of the county of residence.']"""

There was no correlation between baseline CgA and PSA. Two patients with PSA < 10 ng/ml had elevated CgA. Baseline CgA was not influenced by variables such as site of metastasis and time to develop CRPC status. Seven patients (50%) had PSA-response and 5 (36%) CgA-response.

We then analyzed SEPT9_i1 by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies and found that SEPT9_i1 interacts with both α and γ tubulin. SEPT9_i1 expressing cells demonstrated dramatic chromosome segregation defects, centrosome amplification and cytokinesis defects, suggesting two possible molecular mechanisms contributing to the development of genomic instability.

On the other hand, the number of lymph vessels in tumorous tissue was significantly higher than the number of lymph vessels mimicking periacinar retractions. Overall, the number of lymph vessels mimicking periacinar clefts was particularly low. These results are in accordance with our previous studies, which had shown that periacinar clefting appears due to lack of basal cells and stromal changes around tumorous acini.

Because of the role of Cx43 in the determination of carcinoma cell invasive potential, we addressed the problem of the possible Cx43 involvement in early prostate cancer invasion. For this purpose, we analysed Cx43-positive DU-145 cell subsets established from the progenies of the cells most readily transmigrating microporous membranes. These progenies displayed motile activity similar to the control DU-145 cells but were characterized by elevated Cx43 expression levels and GJIC intensity. Thus, apparent links exist between Cx43 expression and transmigration potential of DU-145 cells. Moreover, Cx43 expression profiles in the analysed DU-145 subsets were not affected by intercellular contacts and chemical inhibition of GJIC during the transmigration.

It is important to determine the long-term outcomes to establish an appropriate management in patients with incidental prostate cancer.  Aims:   We aim to determine 10-year survival and to identify the factors of worse prognosis of incidental prostate cancers diagnosed at transurethral resection of prostate.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of patients with pT1a-pT1b prostate cancers diagnosed between 1998 and 2003. Medical notes, PSA and pathology results were reviewed. Overall and cancer specific survival was calculated at mean 10-year follow-up.  Results:   Sixty patients with incidental prostate cancer were identified (pT1a = 18, pT1b = 42). Fifty-one percents of the patients were managed on a watchful waiting strategy with overall 84% survival and 9.7% cancer specific mortality. Twenty patients (all with pT1b) received hormone therapy. Overall survival in this cohort was 50% with 20% cancer specific mortality. Nine patients received curative therapy (Radical prostatectomy = 4, Radiotherapy = 5). In this group, overall survival was 88% with no cancer specific mortality.  Conclusions:   Stage pT1a disease and preoperative low PSA were associated with favourable survival. However, for pT1b and/or high Gleason score (≥7), mortality was comparatively higher. Hence, patients with high Gleason score and/or pT1b disease should be considered for curative therapy.

Although colon cancer cells endogenously express Par-4, the presence or overexpression of Par-4 alone does not cause apoptosis. We hypothesize that Par-4 is inactivated in colon cancer. In colon cancer, the levels and the kinase activity of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src increase with tumor progression. One of the downstream effectors of c-Src is Akt1. Akt1 has been shown to inhibit the pro-apoptotic activity of Par-4 in prostate cancer cells. We therefore investigated the potential of activating Par-4 by inhibiting c-Src. Colon carcinoma cell lines were treated with the Src kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(dimethylethyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU. Treating cells with PP2 and 5-FU resulted in reduced interaction of Par-4 with Akt1 and with the scaffolding protein 14-3-3σ, and mobilization of Par-4 to the nucleus. Par-4 was shown to interact not only with Akt1 and 14-3-3σ, but also with c-Src. Overexpression of c-Src induced the phosphorylation of Par-4 at tyrosine site/s. Thus, in this study, we have shown that Par-4 can be activated by inhibiting Src with a pharmacological inhibitor and adding a chemotherapeutic agent. The activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Par-4 as reported in this study is a novel mechanism by which apoptosis occurs with a Src kinase inhibitor and 5-FU.

Despite the persistence of progressive prostate cancer, CS and hypophosphatemia resolved in parallel after bilateral adrenalectomy. Thus, these data suggest that paraneoplastic CS per se was involved in the pathogenesis of hypophosphatemia. Calcitriol and intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels were within the reference range at onset, which is inappropriate in the setting of severe hypophosphatemia. All parameters of phosphate metabolism normalized after resolution of hypercortisolism. Based on the known suppressive effect of glucocorticoids (GCs) on bone remodeling and the inverse relationship between bone turnover rate and circulating FGF23 levels, we postulate that GCs interfere indirectly with phosphate homeostasis by inducing inappropriate FGF23 production and release.

At the preclinical level, its action is shown to be mediated by induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in many tumor types, including androgen-dependent (AD) and androgen-independent (AI) prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which is directly involved in tumor growth, is one of the most studied and promising molecular targets for anti-cancer therapy and is often overexpressed in PCa. Bortezomib has been reported to impair tumor growth by also inhibiting HIF-1α. In this study, we investigated the effect of bortezomib on the expression, activity and localization of HIF-1α in LNCaP (AD) and PC3 (AI) PCa cells. First, we show that hypoxic upregulation of HIF-1α protein levels and activity involves both the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p44/42 MAPK pathways. Second, bortezomib inhibits expression of HIF-1α protein under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, represses HIF-1 transcriptional activity and attenuates the release of vascular endothelial growth factor. These effects correlate with the ability of bortezomib to cause dephosphorylation of phospho-Akt, phospho-p70S6K, and phospho-S6RP, thus inactivating a pathway known to be required for HIF-1α protein expression at the translational level. Furthermore, bortezomib also abrogates p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation, which results to reduced nuclear translocation of HIF-1α.

In cells overexpressing AR, the chromatin binding of the receptor took place in 100-fold lower concentration of the ligand than in control cells. We confirmed the association of AR level and chromatin binding in two PC xenografts, one containing AR gene amplification with high AR expression, and the other with low expression. By combining the ChIP-seq and expression profiling, we identified AR target genes that are upregulated in PC. Of them, the expression of ZWINT, SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (p45)) and FEN1 (flap structure-specific endonuclease 1) was demonstrated to be increased in CRPC, while the expression of SNAI2 was decreased in both PC and CRPC.

As a candidate ACT effector, γ9δ2T cells can be activated and expanded in vitro and in vivo and display strong antitumor activity against colorectal, lung, prostate, ovarian and renal cell carcinomas. However, it is difficult to obtain a large enough number of γδT cells to meet the need for immunotherapy that can overcome the cancer patients' immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. In previous studies, our lab confirmed that γ9δ2T cells recognized tumor cells via the CDR3δ region of the γδ-T-cell receptor (TCR). We constructed full-length human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived γ9 and δ2 chains in which the CDR3 region was replaced by an ovarian epithelial carcinoma (OEC)-derived CDR3. We transferred the CDR3δ-grafted γ9δ2TCR into peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to develop genetically modified γ9δ2T cells. In vitro studies have shown that these CDR3δ-grafted γ9δ2T cells can produce cytokines after stimulation with tumor cell extracts and exhibit cytotoxicity towards tumor cells, including human OEC and cervical adenocarcinoma. CDR3δ-grafted γ9δ2T cells adoptively transferred into nude mice bearing a human OEC cell line demonstrated significant antitumor effects. These results indicate that CDR3δ-grafted γ9δ2T cells might be candidates for clinical tumor immunotherapy.""","""['Hui Zhao', 'Xueyan Xi', 'Lianxian Cui', 'Wei He']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cell Mol Immunol""","""['Profiling the pattern of the human T-cell receptor γδ complementary determinant region 3 repertoire in patients with lung carcinoma via high-throughput sequencing analysis.', 'Targeting solid tumors via T cell receptor complementarity-determining region 3delta in an engineered antibody.', 'γ9 and δ2CDR3 domains regulate functional avidity of T cells harboring γ9δ2TCRs.', 'γδ T cells in cancer immunotherapy.', 'Prospects for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) γδ T cells: A potential game changer for adoptive T cell cancer immunotherapy.', 'Role of Immune Cells and Receptors in Cancer Treatment: An Immunotherapeutic Approach.', 'Engineering γδ T Cells: Recognizing and Activating on Their Own Way.', 'γδ T Cells in Peripheral Blood of Glioma Patients.', 'The Generation of Human γδT Cell-Derived Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells from Whole Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Culture.', 'Current Advances in γδ T Cell-Based Tumor Immunotherapy.']"""

In this study, we report the preparation and in vivo evaluation of (89)Zr-desferrioxamine B (DFO)-7E11, a novel (89)Zr-labeled monoclonal antibody (mAb) construct for targeted imaging of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a prototypical cell surface marker highly overexpressed in prostate cancer. The ability of (89)Zr-DFO-7E11 to delineate tumor response to therapy was also investigated, because it binds to the intracellular epitope of PSMA, which becomes available only on membrane disruption in dead or dying cells.  Methods:   7E11 as a marker of dying cells was studied by flow cytometry and microscopy of cells after antiandrogen-, radio-, and chemotherapy in LNCaP and PC3 PSMA-positive cells. The in vivo behavior of (89)Zr-DFO-7E11 was characterized in mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP (PSMA-positive) tumors by biodistribution studies and immuno-PET. The potential of assessing tumor response was evaluated in vivo after radiotherapy.  Results:   In vitro studies correlated 7E11 binding with markers of apoptosis (7-amino-actinomycin-D and caspase-3). In vivo biodistribution experiments revealed high, target-specific uptake of (89)Zr-DFO-7E11 in LNCaP tumors after 24 h (20.35 ± 7.50 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]), 48 h (22.82 ± 3.58 %ID/g), 96 h (36.94 ± 6.27 %ID/g), and 120 h (25.23 ± 4.82 %ID/g). Excellent image contrast was observed with immuno-PET. 7E11 uptake was statistically increased in irradiated versus control tumor as measured by immuno-PET and biodistribution studies. Binding specificity was assessed by effective blocking studies at 48 h.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that (89)Zr-DFO-7E11 displays high tumor-to-background tissue contrast in immuno-PET and can be used as a tool to monitor and quantify, with high specificity, tumor response in PSMA-positive prostate cancer.""","""['Alessandro Ruggiero', 'Jason P Holland', 'Tvrtko Hudolin', 'Larissa Shenker', 'Anna Koulova', 'Neil H Bander', 'Jason S Lewis', 'Jan Grimm']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['89Zr-DFO-J591 for immunoPET of prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in vivo.', 'Cerenkov luminescence imaging of medical isotopes.', 'Translational Development of a Zr-89-Labeled Inhibitor of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen for PET Imaging in Prostate Cancer.', '89Zr-Desferrioxamine B-7E11 anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen monoclonal antibody.', '89Zr-Desferrioxamine B-J591 anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen monoclonal antibody.', 'The Influence of Boron on the Structure and Properties of Hybrid Compounds Containing Zirconium and Phosphorus.', 'Current Perspectives on 89Zr-PET Imaging.', 'Development of zirconium-89 PET for in vivo imaging of alpha-klotho.', 'Therapeutic effects of human monoclonal PSMA antibody-mediated TRIM24 siRNA delivery in PSMA-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Radiochemistry and Preclinical PET Imaging of 68Ga-Desferrioxamine Radiotracers Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.']"""

To date, few studies have investigated whether this therapy also increases the risk of cerebrovascular events.  Objective:   To determine whether different types of ADT increase the risk of stroke/transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) in patients with prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a population-based cohort study using a nested case-control analysis within the United Kingdom's General Practice Research Database population. The cohort included all patients at least 40 yr of age newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 2008, and followed until December 31, 2009. Cases consisted of those who experienced a first-ever stroke/TIA during follow-up. Up to 10 controls were matched to each case on age, year of cohort entry, and duration of follow-up.  Measurements:   Adjusted rate ratios (RRs) of stroke/TIA associated with the use of different ADTs (gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonists, oral antiandrogens, combined androgen blockade, bilateral orchiectomy, and others) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   The cohort included 22 310 patients with prostate cancer, followed for a mean of 3.9 yr, where 938 patients experienced a first-ever stroke/TIA (rate: 10.7 per 1000/yr). Compared with nonusers of ADT, current users of GnRH agonists (adjusted RR: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.39), oral antiandrogens (adjusted RR: 1.47; 95% CI, 1.08-2.01), and those who underwent bilateral orchiectomy (adjusted RR: 1.77; 95% CI, 1.25-2.39) were at an increased risk of stroke/TIA. No statistically significant increased risks were observed for patients on combined androgen blockade and other ADTs, but the small numbers do not rule out a possible association.

While patients initially respond favorably to androgen ablation therapy, most experience a relapse of the disease within 1-2 years by expressing androgen receptor (AR) mutants. Such mutations, indeed, promote unfavorable agonistic behavior from classical antagonists. Here, we have synthesized and screened 37 novel compounds derived from dihydrotestosterone (DHT), cyanolutamide and hydroxyflutamide. These derivatives were tested for their potential antagonistic activity using a luciferase reporter gene assay and binding properties were determined for wild type (WT) and mutant ARs (T877A, W741C, W741L, H874Y). In the absence and presence of antiandrogens, androgen dependent cellular proliferation and prostate specific antigen (PSA) expression were assayed in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP by crystal violet, real time PCR and by Western blots. Also, cellular proliferation and PSA expression were assayed in 22Rv1. A novel compound RB346, derived from DHT, was found to be an antagonist for all tested AR forms, preventing DHT induced proliferation and PSA expression in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. RB346 displayed no agonistic activity, in contrast to the non-steroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide (Casodex) with unfavorable agonistic activity for W741L-AR. Additionally, RB346 has a slightly higher binding affinity for WT-AR, T877A-AR and H874Y-AR than bicalutamide. Thus, RB346 is the first potent steroidal antiandrogen with efficacy for WT and various AR mutants.""","""['Thomas Andrieu', 'Reto Bertolini', 'Sara E Nichols', 'Raschid Setoud', 'Felix J Frey', 'Michael E Baker', 'Brigitte M Frey']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Suppression of mutant androgen receptors by flutamide.', 'Study of the impact of the T877A mutation on ligand-induced helix-12 positioning of the androgen receptor resulted in design and synthesis of novel antiandrogens.', 'Novel mutations of androgen receptor: a possible mechanism of bicalutamide withdrawal syndrome.', 'Androgen receptor antagonists (antiandrogens): structure-activity relationships.', 'Androgen receptor mutations in carcinoma of the prostate: significance for endocrine therapy.', 'Recent Advances in Drug Design and Drug Discovery for Androgen- Dependent Diseases.', 'The direct inhibitory effect of dutasteride or finasteride on androgen receptor activity is cell line specific.']"""

Recent studies have examined the cancer diagnostic/prognostic values of various acute phase proteins, such as haptoglobin. We describe here a novel method of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based on multi-sequential analysis with SNA-1, AAL, and PHA-L(4) lectin, to estimate the glycosylation status of haptoglobin in sera of patients with prostate cancer (n=15), benign prostate disease (BPD) including benign prostatic hypertrophy (n=20), and normal subjects (n=11). The SPR-based analysis involves the use of anti-haptoglobin as ligand and dilution of the analyte to 1400-fold and filtration, followed by detection of the sugar chain by lectin solution. The normalized RU of lectin to haptoglobin represents the binding amount of lectin divided by that of haptoglobin. The normalized RU by SNA-1 of the prostate cancer group was significantly higher than those of the control and BPD group. SNA-1 detected NeuAcα2,6 in a biantennary sugar chain, whose content was the highest among the major glycoproteins in serum. Serum samples diluted about 7000-fold were subjected to microanalysis at 10 ng/μl and 10 μl/min for 4 min.

Study design:   Cross-sectional.  Methods:   In total, 7286 individuals aged 16-64 years, randomly selected from the National Population Register, filled out questionnaires in postal surveys in 2000, 2004 and 2008. The target age group was 45-64 years for mammography, 25-64 years for Pap test and 50-64 years for prostate examination. The probability of using these preventive medical services within the past 2 years by BMI was analysed using logistic regression models. Potential confounding variables included socio-economic factors, health behaviour, number of outpatient visits, current self-rated health, study year and age.  Results:   Compared with women of normal weight, the probability of mammography use was higher for overweight women [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.73], and the probability of a Pap test was significantly lower for severely obese women (adjusted OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35-0.76). Prostate examination was independent of BMI. In 2008, mammography was predominantly performed within the screening framework for all BMI groups (highest rate in the mild obesity group, 76.2%), while Pap tests were predominantly performed following referral by a doctor (especially in the severe obesity group, 66.7%). The attendance rate for prostate examination was higher for men who rated their current health status as rather poor/poor.  Conclusions:   In a country where population-based breast cancer screening works fairly well, cervical cancer screening is in its developmental stage and there is no screening for prostate cancer, the deciding role in referring people for preventive examinations for cervical and prostate cancer is still held by doctors. As such, they should pay particular attention to obese women, as this group has a worse prognosis for cervical cancer, and perform more prostate examinations for preventive purposes.""","""['M Tekkel', 'T Veideman', 'M Rahu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Public Health""","""['Cancer screening in women: body mass index and adherence to physician recommendations.', 'Racial/Ethnic Differences Affecting Adherence to Cancer Screening Guidelines Among Women.', 'Breast and cervical cancer screening in obese minority women.', 'Health technology assessment and screening in The Netherlands: case studies of mammography in breast cancer, PSA screening in prostate cancer, and ultrasound in normal pregnancy.', 'Accuracy of self-reports of Pap and mammography screening compared to medical record: a meta-analysis.', 'Inequalities in reported use of cervical screening in Estonia: results from cross-sectional studies in 2004-2020.', 'A systematic review of obesity as a barrier to accessing cancer screening services.', 'Body Mass Index and Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening.', 'Determinants of breast cancer screening uptake in Kurdish women of Iran.', 'Alcohol consumption, smoking and overweight as a burden for health care services utilization: a cross-sectional study in Estonia.']"""

Here, we examine the functional role of αv integrin receptor expression in the acquisition of a metastatic stem/progenitor phenotype in human prostate cancer. Stable knockdown of αv integrins expression in PC-3M-Pro4 prostate cancer cells coincided with a significant decrease of prostate cancer stem/progenitor cell characteristics (α2 integrin, CD44, and ALDH(hi)) and decreased expression of invasion-associated genes Snail, Snail2, and Twist. Consistent with these observations, αv-knockdown strongly inhibited the clonogenic and migratory potentials of human prostate cancer cells in vitro and significantly decreased tumorigenicity and metastatic ability in preclinical models of orthotopic growth and bone metastasis.

Despite prior reports demonstrating improved cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in patients who receive an early/immediate radical cystectomy (RC), the role of early surgery remains ill-defined. We analyzed the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database to ascertain the use of RC as an initial therapy for clinical HGT1 bladder cancer.  Materials and methods:   Using the SEER database from 2004 through 2007, we identified and stratified patients with clinical HGT1 bladder cancer who underwent RC as initial therapy within 1 year of diagnosis. We used χ(2) tests and t-tests to compare characteristics of surgical vs. nonsurgical patients. Cumulative incidence functions and Gray's test for inferences were employed to assess cause-specific mortality outcomes.  Results:   From 2004 to 2007, 8,467 patients were diagnosed with clinical HGT1 bladder cancer, and 397 (4.7%) patients underwent RC. Patients who underwent RC for clinical HGT1 disease were significantly younger (P < 0.0001) and married (P < 0.0001). Surgical patients also had a significantly improved overall (P = 0.004) and other cause of death (P = 0.0053) survival probabilities yet CSM at 1, 2, and 3 years was not statistically different between the surgical and nonsurgical groups (P = 0.134).  Conclusions:   In contrast to the clinically early stage renal and prostate cancers, HGT1 bladder cancer exhibits a higher degree of early progression and potential lethality. Despite routine use of extirpative surgery for T1 lesions of the kidney and prostate, our analysis of the SEER database reveals that definitive surgical therapy is uncommonly employed for HGT1 bladder cancer.""","""['Daniel Canter', 'Brian Egleston', 'Yu-Ning Wong', 'Marc C Smaldone', 'Jay Simhan', 'Richard E Greenberg', 'Robert G Uzzo', 'Alexander Kutikov']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Marital status: a gender-independent risk factor for poorer survival after radical cystectomy.', 'Conditional survival of patients with urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder treated with radical cystectomy.', 'Role of immediate radical cystectomy in the treatment of patients with residual T1 bladder cancer on restaging transurethral resection.', 'Upper urinary tract recurrence following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a meta-analysis on 13,185 patients.', 'Determining the role of cystectomy for high-grade T1 urothelial carcinoma.', 'CD8+ Cell Density Gradient across the Tumor Epithelium-Stromal Interface of Non-Muscle Invasive Papillary Urothelial Carcinoma Predicts Recurrence-Free Survival after BCG Immunotherapy.', 'Effectiveness of Early Radical Cystectomy for High-Risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'High-Grade Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: When to Move to Early Radical Cystectomy?', 'Impact of Diagnosing Urologists and Hospitals on the Use of Radical Cystectomy.', 'Application of nomograms in the prediction of overall survival and cancer-specific survival in patients with T1 high-grade bladder cancer.']"""

Methods:   Men with PSA levels below 10 ng/ml were enrolled in a prospective cohort study and underwent combined MRSI and DCE-MRI and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T MR scanner (Symphony TIM; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with an endorectal coil (Medrad; Pittsburg, PA), inflated with 60 cc of air. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopic data were acquired by using water and a lipid-suppressed double-spin-echo point-resolved spectroscopy sequence, which was optimized for quantitative detection of both choline and citrate. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI sequences were obtained with 3D T1-weighted FLASH images before and during rapid bolus administration of intravenous paramagnetic contrast medium gadoteric acid. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were computed considering patients, each of the 2 lobes, each of the 6 sextants, and each 12th part of the prostate gland as single measurements.  Results:   Overall, 106 patients were included in the analysis. Median age was 65.9 years (range, 61.2-70.5 years) and median PSA level at study entry was 7.1 ng/ml (range, 2.5-9.9). CaP was detected at biopsy in 24 patients (22.6 % of the population) with a median Gleason score of 8 (range 4-10). Diagnostic accuracy of combined MRSI and DCE-MRI was 85%, sensitivity was 71%, and specificity was 48%, considering patients as single measurements, with a negative predictive value of 91%, but a positive predictive value of only 19%. Positive predictive value of the examination improved to 25% for patients who repeated biopsy.  Conclusions:   Although this study confirms the potential usefulness of MRI for the diagnosis of CaP, the positive predictive value obtained was unacceptably low due to the high number of false positives recorded. Nevertheless, the high negative predictive value of the examination may serve to avoid unnecessary biopsies. Future research should be directed at assessing the value of combining MRI-based techniques with novel biochemical markers for the diagnosis of CaP in patients with low PSA levels.""","""['Sisto Perdonà', 'Giuseppe Di Lorenzo', 'Riccardo Autorino', 'Carlo Buonerba', 'Marco De Sio', 'Sergio Venanzio Setola', 'Roberta Fusco', 'Francesco Michele Ronza', 'Michele Caraglia', 'Matteo Ferro', 'Antonella Petrillo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Localising prostate cancer: comparison of endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and 3D-MR spectroscopic imaging with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy.', 'Value of endorectal MRI and MRS in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and previous negative biopsies to localize peripheral zone tumours.', 'Role of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (¹HMRSI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in identifying prostate cancer foci in patients with negative biopsy and high levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA).', 'The role of magnetic resonance imaging in targeting prostate cancer in patients with previous negative biopsies and elevated prostate-specific antigen levels.', 'Imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis: present role and future perspectives.', 'Multiparametric MRI reporting using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.0 (PI-RADSv2) retains clinical efficacy in a predominantly post-biopsy patient population.', 'Histogram analysis of prostate cancer on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging: A preliminary study emphasizing on zonal difference.', 'A systematic review on multiparametric MR imaging in prostate cancer detection.', 'Diagnostic value and relative weight of sequence-specific magnetic resonance features in characterizing clinically significant prostate cancers.', 'The emerging role of obesity, diet and lipid metabolism in prostate cancer.']"""

This study evaluated the anticancer activity of phenyl-2-aminoethyl selenide (PAESe) and its potential to reduce doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity. Growth inhibitory effects of PAESe with DOX, and vincristine, clinically used anticancer agents, and tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP), a known oxidant, on the growth of human prostate carcinoma (PC-3) cells was determined. PAESe (≤1μm) did not alter the growth of PC-3 cells, however, concomitant use of PAESe decreased the oxidative-mediated cytotoxicity of TBHP, but had limited effect on vincristine or DOX activity. Further, PAESe decreased the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species from TBHP and DOX. The effect of PAESe on the activity of DOX was determined using a tumor (PC-3) xenograft model in mice. PAESe did not alter DOX antitumor activity and showed evidence of direct antitumor activity relative to controls. DOX treatment decreased mice body weight significantly, whereas concomitant administration of PAESe and DOX was similar to controls. Most importantly, PAESe decreased DOX-mediated infiltration of neutrophil and macrophages into the myocardium.

The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to evaluate the unedited- and edited- AABS and inter-observer variability among the RO. Descriptive statistics, paired t-tests and a Pearson correlation were performed. ANOVA analysis using logit transformations of DSC values was calculated to assess inter-observer variability.

Data on survival, costs and quality of life were inputs in a decision analysis, and a decision support model was developed. The model can generate cost-effectiveness information on subgroups of patients with different characteristics.  Results:   Age was the most important independent factor explaining cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness value varied from 21,026 Swedish kronor (SEK) to 858,703 SEK for those aged 65 to 75 years, depending on Gleason scores and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Information from the decision support model can support decision makers in judging whether or not radical prostatectomy (RP) should be used to treat a specific patient group.  Conclusions:   The cost-effectiveness ratio for RP varies with age, Gleason scores, and PSA values. Assuming a threshold value of 200,000 SEK per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, for patients aged ≤70 years the treatment was always cost-effective, except at age 70, Gleason 0-4 and PSA ≤10. Using the same threshold value at age 75, Gleason 7-9 (regardless of PSA) and Gleason 5-6 (with PSA >20) were cost-effective.

Methods:   In order to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in CRPC progression and to identify new therapeutic targets, we analyzed a unique sample set of 11 CRPCs and 7 advanced tumors by array-CGH and gene expression microarrays. The genome-wide DNA and RNA data were integrated to identify genes whose overexpression was driven by their amplification. To assess the functional role of these genes, their expression was analyzed in a transcriptional data set of 329 clinical prostate cancers and the corresponding gene products were silenced using RNA interference in prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Six recurrent genetic targets were identified in the CRPCs; ATP1B1, AR, FAM110B, LAS1L, MYC, and YIPF6. In addition to AR and MYC, FAM110B emerged as a potential key gene involved in CRPC progression in a subset of the tumors. FAM110B was able to regulate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells and FAM110B itself was regulated by androgens. FAM110B siRNA inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and this effect was substantially enhanced in androgen deficient conditions. Ectopic FAM110B expression in non-cancerous epithelial prostate cells induced aneuploidy and impaired antigen presentation.

Granzyme B (GrB), a protease located in natural killer cells, initiates apoptosis in target cells. Inhibition of GrB by PI-9, its natural inhibitor, can prevent apoptosis. Here we investigate whether PI-9 protects prostate cancer cells from apoptosis.  Methods:   The expression of PI-9 was quantified by qPCR in several prostate cancer cell lines, and GrB activity was tested in each cell line. PI-9 was overexpressed in LNCaP cells, which lack endogenous PI-9. Apoptosis was induced by natural killer cells in LNCaP cells that either contained or lacked PI-9, and the percent cell death was quantified. Lastly, PI-9 levels were examined by qPCR and immunohistochemistry in prostate tumor tissue.  Results:   Prostate cancer cell lines that expressed PI-9 could inhibit GrB. Overexpression of PI-9 protected LNCaP cells from natural killer cell-mediated apoptosis. Examination of the levels of PI-9 in tissue from prostate tumors showed that PI-9 could be upregulated in low grade tumors and stochastically dysregulated in high grade tumors. Additionally, PI-9 was found consistently in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and atrophic lesions.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that overexpression of PI-9 can protect prostate cancer cells from apoptosis, and this effect may occur in human prostate tumors. These findings imply that early prostatic inflammation may trigger this increase in PI-9. This suggests that PI-9 upregulation is needed early in tumor progression, before additional protective mechanisms are in place.""","""['Manisha Ray', 'Daniel R Hostetter', 'Carly R K Loeb', 'Jeffry Simko', 'Charles S Craik']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Serpins prevent granzyme-induced death in a species-specific manner.', 'The intracellular granzyme B inhibitor, proteinase inhibitor 9, is up-regulated during accessory cell maturation and effector cell degranulation, and its overexpression enhances CTL potency.', 'Human kallikrein 2 (hK2), but not prostate-specific antigen (PSA), rapidly complexes with protease inhibitor 6 (PI-6) released from prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Expression of maspin and glutathionine-S-transferase-pi in normal human prostate and prostatic carcinomas.', 'Granzyme B-induced apoptosis in cancer cells and its regulation (review).', 'Update of cellular responses to the efferocytosis of necroptosis and pyroptosis.', 'Serpin B9 controls tumor cell killing by CAR T cells.', 'Escaping Death: How Cancer Cells and Infected Cells Resist Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity.', 'A Combination of Glutaminase Inhibitor 968 and PD-L1 Blockade Boosts the Immune Response against Ovarian Cancer.', 'Pyroptosis: mechanisms and diseases.']"""

Imaging probes that target receptors for ghrelin may delineate PCas from benign disease. The specificity of a novel ghrelin-imaging probe for PCa over normal tissue or benign disease was assessed.  Methods:   A fluorescein-bearing ghrelin analogue was synthesized (fluorescein-ghrelin(1-18)), and its application for imaging was evaluated in a panel of PCa cell lines and human prostate tissue. Prostate core biopsy samples were collected from fresh surgery specimens of 13 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Ghrelin probe signal was detected and quantified in each sample using a hapten amplification technique and associated with pathological features.  Results:   The ghrelin probe was taken up by GHSR-expressing LNCaP and PC-3 cells, and not in BPH cells that express low levels of GHSR. Binding was blocked by competition with excess unlabeled probe. The ghrelin probe signal was 4.7 times higher in PCa compared to benign hyperplasia tissue (P = 0.0027) and normal tissue (P = 0.0093). Furthermore, while the ghrelin probe signal was 1.9-fold higher in PIN compared to benign hyperplasia (P = 0.0022) and normal tissue (P = 0.0047), there was no significant difference in the signal of benign hyperplasia compared to normal tissue.  Conclusion:   The imaging probe fluorescein-ghrelin(1-18) is specific for PCa, and did not associate significantly with benign hyperplasia or normal prostate tissue.

Our aim was to determine whether single biomarkers and/or multivariate algorithms significantly improved on the predictive power of an algorithm based on demographics for prediction of urothelial cancer in patients presenting with hematuria.  Methods:   Twenty-two biomarkers in urine and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and biochip array technology in 2 patient cohorts: 80 patients with urothelial cancer, and 77 controls with confounding pathologies. We used Forward Wald binary logistic regression analyses to create algorithms based on demographic variables designated prior predicted probability (PPP) and multivariate algorithms, which included PPP as a single variable. Areas under the curve (AUC) were determined after receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis for single biomarkers and algorithms.  Results:   After univariate analysis, 9 biomarkers were differentially expressed (t test; P < .05). CEA AUC 0.74; bladder tumor antigen (BTA) AUC 0.74; and nuclear matrix protein (NMP22) 0.79. PPP included age and smoking years; AUC 0.76. An algorithm including PPP, NMP22, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) significantly improved AUC to 0.90 when compared with PPP. The algorithm including PPP, BTA, CEA, and thrombomodulin (TM) increased AUC to 0.86. Sensitivities = 91%, 91%; and specificities = 80%, 71%, respectively, for the algorithms.

Desipramine is used for treating neuropathic pain, particularly in prostate cancer patients. The clinically used drugs cisplatin (cis-[PtCl(2)(NH(3))(2)]), oxaliplatin [1,2-diaminocyclohexaneoxalatoplatinum(II)], and the cationic trinuclear agent BBR3464 [{trans-PtCl(NH(3))(2)}(2)-μ-(trans-Pt(NH(3))(2)(H(2)N(CH(2))(6)NH(2))(2))](4+), which has undergone evaluation in phase II clinical trials for activity in lung and ovarian cancers, were evaluated. Surprisingly, desipramine greatly augments the cytotoxicity of all the platinum-based chemotherapeutics in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Desipramine enhanced cellular accumulation of cisplatin, but had no effect on the accumulation of oxaliplatin or BBR3464, suggesting that enhanced accumulation could not be a consistent means by which desipramine altered the platinum-drug-mediated cytotoxicity. The desipramine/cisplatin combination resulted in increased levels of p53 as well as mitochondrial damage, caspase activation, and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage, suggesting that desipramine may synergize with cisplatin more than with other platinum chemotherapeutics partly by activating distinct apoptotic pathways. The study argues that desipramine may be a means of enhancing chemoresponsiveness of platinum drugs and the results warrant further investigation. The results emphasize the importance of understanding the differential pharmacological action of adjuvants employed in combinations with cancer chemotherapeutics.""","""['Peyman Kabolizadeh', 'Brigitte J Engelmann', 'Nicholas Pullen', 'Jennifer K Stewart', 'John J Ryan', 'Nicholas P Farrell']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Inorg Chem""","""['Differences in the cellular response and signaling pathways of cisplatin and BBR3464 (trans-PtCl(NH3)(2)2mu-(trans-Pt(NH3)(2)(H2N(CH2)(6)-NH2)2)4+) influenced by copper homeostasis.', 'Novel oximato-bridged platinum(II) di- and trimer(s): synthetic, structural, and in vitro anticancer activity studies.', 'Biological consequences of trinuclear platinum complexes: comparison of trans-PtCl(NH3)22mu-(trans-Pt(NH3)2(H2N(CH2)6-NH2)2)4+ (BBR 3464) with its noncovalent congeners.', 'Drug discovery research in in-vivo antitumor-active azolato-bridged dinuclear Pt(II) complexes.', 'Antitumor potential of platinum(II) complexes of selenium donor ligands.', 'Antitumoral Effects of Tricyclic Antidepressants: Beyond Neuropathic Pain Treatment.', 'A novel signature based on autophagy-related lncRNA for prognostic prediction and candidate drugs for lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Platinum Complexes in Colorectal Cancer and Other Solid Tumors.', 'Turning liabilities into opportunities: Off-target based drug repurposing in cancer.', 'In vitro anticancer effect of tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline on multiple myeloma.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between December 2008 and 2010, thirty-nine patients with low (n=26) and intermediate (n=13) risk prostate cancer were treated with PPI. Their mean age and initial PSA were 66 year (51-80 year) and 9 ng/ml (3,2-15 ng/ml). Iodine-125 loose seeds were implanted under spinal anaesthesia using the FIRST system (Nucletron, The Netherlands). Needles were inserted into the prostate through the perineum according to the preplan based on transrectal ultrasound images. The treatment plan was modified according to updated positions of the needles on live US images. The prescribed dose to the prostate was 145 Gy. Seed loading was performed under real-time US assistance. Implanted sources were checked by X-ray and CT images. Patients were discharged one day after the implantation. On follow-up visits PSA and toxicity were registered.  Results:   The mean follow-up was 10 months (3-27 months), the median number of seeds was 53 (30-78), their mean activity was 0.48 mCi (0.41-0.52 mCi). The mean coverage of the prostate by the prescribed dose was 96% (92-98%). The mean percent dose of the prescribed dose that covered the 90% of the prostate (D90), 2 cm3 of the rectum (Dr2cm3) and 10% of the urethra (Du10) were 113% (104-121%), 85% (48-121%) and 124% (98-146%) respectively. Deviation from the requested dose-volume constraints never exceeded 3%. Acute >grade 2 proctitis, grade 2 and 3 cysto-prostatitis were observed in 0 (0%), 13 (33.3%) and 1 (2.6%) cases. Biochemical relapse occurred in one patient (2.6%).  Conclusion:   This is a report of the first application of PPI in Hungary. The observed rate of acute proctitis was negligible, the rate and severity of acute cysto-prostatitis was tolerable. With the use of intraoperative planning, dose distributions met the dose-volume constraints in most of the cases.

Baculovirus is an emerging gene delivery vector but only mediates transient expression (<7 days); thus, this study primarily aimed to develop a hybrid baculovirus for sustained antiangiogenic gene expression and cancer therapy. We first constructed plasmids featuring adeno-associated virus inverted terminal repeats (AAV ITRs), oriP/Epstein-Barr virus-expressed nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) or Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon and compared their efficacies in terms of persistent expression. In human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, AAV ITR failed to prolong the expression while oriP/EBNA1 moderately extended the expression to 35 days. In contrast, the SB system led to stable expression beyond 77 days even without antibiotic selection. Given this finding, we constructed a hybrid SB baculovirus expressing the SB transposase and harboring the transgene cassette flanked by inverted repeat/direct-repeat (IR/DR) elements recognizable by SB. The hybrid SB baculovirus efficiently transduced mammalian cells and mediated an expression duration longer than that by conventional baculoviruses, thanks to the transgene persistence and integration. The SB baculovirus (Bac-SB-T2hEA/w) expressing the antiangiogenic fusion protein comprising endostatin and angiostatin (hEA) also enabled prolonged hEA expression. With sustained hEA expression, Bac-SB-T2hEA/w repressed the angiogenesis in vivo, hindered the growth of two different tumors (prostate tumor allografts and human ovarian tumor xenografts) in mice and extended the life span of animals. These data altogether implicated the potential of the hybrid SB-baculovirus vector for prolonged hEA expression and for the treatment of multiple types of angiogenesis-dependent tumors.""","""['W-Y Luo', 'Y-S Shih', 'C-L Hung', 'K-W Lo', 'C-S Chiang', 'W-H Lo', 'S-F Huang', 'S-C Wang', 'C-F Yu', 'C-H Chien', 'Y-C Hu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Gene Ther""","""['Baculovirus vectors for antiangiogenesis-based cancer gene therapy.', 'Sleeping Beauty-baculovirus hybrid vectors for long-term gene expression in the eye.', 'Development of hybrid baculovirus vectors for artificial MicroRNA delivery and prolonged gene suppression.', 'Nonviral gene delivery with the sleeping beauty transposon system.', 'The Sleeping Beauty transposon toolbox.', 'Baculoviruses in Gene Therapy and Personalized Medicine.', 'Coactivation of Endogenous Wnt10b and Foxc2 by CRISPR Activation Enhances BMSC Osteogenesis and Promotes Calvarial Bone Regeneration.', 'Recombinant baculovirus expressing the FrC-OVA protein induces protective antitumor immunity in an EG7-OVA mouse model.', 'Synthetic switch-based baculovirus for transgene expression control and selective killing of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Gene delivery and gene expression in vertebrate using baculovirus Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus vector.']"""

The currently-available treatments for bone metastasis are unsatisfactory in their effectiveness and outcome. Bone continuously undergoes remodeling through a repeated cycle of osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation. When cancer cells metastasize to the bone, their growth is promoted under the influence of a variety of growth factors that are supplied from the bone as a consequence of osteoclastic bone resorption. This, in turn, causes an increased production of osteoclast- and osteoblast-stimulating cytokines in these cancer cells, leading to a further increase in bone remodeling. This vicious cycle between bone and metastatic cancer cells supports the development and progression of bone metastases. Accumulating evidence shows that RANKL, a cytokine expressed in osteoblasts/bone marrow stromal cells, plays an important role in the formation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts, which are key players in bone remodeling. RANKL is thus expected to inhibit bone metastasis by disrupting this vicious cycle, and is considered a rational new therapeutic intervention for bone metastasis. In animal models, inhibition with RANKL has been shown to prevent the development of bone metastases. Based on the promising results from these preclinical studies, a fully human monoclonal anti-RANKL antibody, denosumab, has been developed. In three phase III clinical trials of denosumab versus zoledronic acid(ZA)in advanced cancer patients with bone metastases, denosumab was superior or equal to ZA in delaying the time to the first on-study skeletal-related events(SRE). In conclusion, denosumab, a fully human monoclonal anti-RANKL antibody with a targeted mechanism of action, enables us to more easily and effectively treat bone metastases and manage cancer patients with bone metastases.""","""['Toshiyuki Yoneda']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Gan To Kagaku Ryoho""","""['Anti-RANKL antibody for treatment of patients with bone metastasis from breast cancer.', 'Clinical development of anti-RANKL therapies for treatment and prevention of bone metastasis.', 'Treatment of bone metastasis with anti-RANKL antibody.', 'Treatment of bone metastasis by denosumab, the human monoclonal neutralizing antibody to RANKL.', 'The clinical merit of anti-RANKL antibody denosumab in prostate cancer.', 'Stimulation of host bone marrow stromal cells by sympathetic nerves promotes breast cancer bone metastasis in mice.']"""

In various cancer types, including prostate cancer cells, a side population (SP) and CD133-expressing cells have been proposed as containing a population cancer cells with stem-like ability. Therefore the aim of this work was to determine, in prostate cancer cell lines, the frequency and tumorigenic potential of SP and CD133+ cells.  Results:   In vitro 2D colony-forming assay and sphere-forming assay, Flow cytometry analysis and magnetic cell sorting were utilized to sort CD133+, CD133- and Side population (SP) cells. Our findings indicate that CD44 and integrin α-6 are uniformly expressed in the hTERT cell lines; however, CD133 is expressed only in a small population (< 0.1%). FACS-sorted CD133+ and CD133- cells exhibited similar tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, for the hTERT cells, SP rather than CD133 expression showed an 8-fold enhanced tumorigenic potential. The data suggest that SP cells, rather than those with CD133 marker, contain the rare population of CSC capable of producing prostate tumors.  Conclusion:   Collectively, our data suggest that although CD133 is expressed only in a small population of hTERT-immortalized prostate cancer cells, it is not likely to be associated with stem cells, as CD133- and CD133+ cells exhibited similar tumorigenicity. However, SP isolated cells, appear to be enriched with tumorigenic stem-like cells capable of generating palpable tumors.""","""['Jianjun Zhou', 'Honghe Wang', 'Virginetta Cannon', 'Karen Marie Wolcott', 'Hongbin Song', 'Clayton Yates']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['CD133 and CD44 are universally overexpressed in GIST and do not represent cancer stem cell markers.', 'Polarized cell migration induces cancer type-specific CD133/integrin/Src/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling required for maintenance of cancer stem cell properties.', 'Highly enriched CD133(+)CD44(+) stem-like cells with CD133(+)CD44(high) metastatic subset in HCT116 colon cancer cells.', 'Research progression of CD133 as a marker of cancer stem cells.', 'CD133 as a marker for cancer stem cells: progresses and concerns.', 'Exploring the Onset and Progression of Prostate Cancer through a Multicellular Agent-based Model.', 'Integrating Pharmacogenomics Data-Driven Computational Drug Prediction with Single-Cell RNAseq to Demonstrate the Efficacy of a NAMPT Inhibitor against Aggressive, Taxane-Resistant, and Stem-like Cells in Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'The emerging potentials of lncRNA DRAIC in human cancers.', 'Targeting cancer stem cells in cholangiocarcinoma (Review).', 'Targeting Cancer Stem Cells by Genetically Engineered Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells.']"""

As a result of their restricted expression patterns, the CTAs could serve as unique biomarkers for cancer diagnosis/prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify promising CTAs that are associated with prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence following radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   The expression of 5 CTAs was measured by quantitative multiplex real-time PCR using prostate tissue samples obtained from 72 patients with apparently clinically localized PCa with a median of two years follow-up (range, 1 to 14 years).  Results:   The expression of CTAs namely, CEP55, NUF2, PBK and TTK were significantly higher while PAGE4 was significantly lower in patients with recurrent disease. All CTAs with the exception of TTK were significantly correlated with the prostatectomy Gleason score, but none were correlated with age, stage, or preoperative PSA levels. In univariate proportional hazards models, CEP55 (HR = 3.59, 95% CI: 1.50-8.60), p = 0.004; NUF2 (HR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.11-4.67), p = 0.024; and PAGE4 (HR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.93), p = 0.031 were significantly associated with the risk of PCa recurrence. However, the results were no longer significant after adjustment for prostatectomy Gleason score.

Design/methodology/approach:   In-depth interviews were conducted with 11 male inpatients suffering prostate cancer. The interviews were personal narrations based on open-ended questions. The theoretical basis is founded in sense-making, trust and competence.  Findings:   Existential issues related to nursing care were interpreted by nurses as a need for (technical) information. However, respondents indicated a need for professional support regarding their whole life. The social climate seems not to be optimal for existential talk owing to hospital routines. Patients' personal traits also affect the propensity to cooperation, and three types were distinguished: cooperating patients; passive patients; and denying patients. Nurses' competence may be regarded as hierarchical levels from optimising single items, over system optimisation and to optimisation from the patient perspective. The study indicates that not even first-level requirements are met.  Research limitations/implications:   Only patients' views were studied. Nurses' perceptions would add additional insights. Lack of personal relations and cooperation between patient and nurse may decrease service quality. Patient attitudes seem to be a major obstacle. For some patients, passively receiving technical information may be an excuse for not wanting to participate in mutual sense-making. The supposed need for technical information may also be an excuse for nurses to avoid more sensitive issues.

Among metabolites, profiling of plasma free amino acids (PFAAs) is a promising approach because PFAAs link all organ systems and have important roles in metabolism. Furthermore, PFAA profiles are known to be influenced by specific diseases, including cancers. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine the characteristics of the PFAA profiles in cancer patients and the possibility of using this information for early detection.  Methods and findings:   Plasma samples were collected from approximately 200 patients from multiple institutes, each diagnosed with one of the following five types of cancer: lung, gastric, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer. Patients were compared to gender- and age- matched controls also used in this study. The PFAA levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS). Univariate analysis revealed significant differences in the PFAA profiles between the controls and the patients with any of the five types of cancer listed above, even those with asymptomatic early-stage disease. Furthermore, multivariate analysis clearly discriminated the cancer patients from the controls in terms of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC of ROC >0.75 for each cancer), regardless of cancer stage. Because this study was designed as case-control study, further investigations, including model construction and validation using cohorts with larger sample sizes, are necessary to determine the usefulness of PFAA profiling.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that PFAA profiling has great potential for improving cancer screening and diagnosis and understanding disease pathogenesis. PFAA profiles can also be used to determine various disease diagnoses from a single blood sample, which involves a relatively simple plasma assay and imposes a lower physical burden on subjects when compared to existing screening methods.""","""['Yohei Miyagi', 'Masahiko Higashiyama', 'Akira Gochi', 'Makoto Akaike', 'Takashi Ishikawa', 'Takeshi Miura', 'Nobuhiro Saruki', 'Etsuro Bando', 'Hideki Kimura', 'Fumio Imamura', 'Masatoshi Moriyama', 'Ichiro Ikeda', 'Akihiko Chiba', 'Fumihiro Oshita', 'Akira Imaizumi', 'Hiroshi Yamamoto', 'Hiroshi Miyano', 'Katsuhisa Horimoto', 'Osamu Tochikubo', 'Toru Mitsushima', 'Minoru Yamakado', 'Naoyuki Okamoto']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The significance and robustness of a plasma free amino acid (PFAA) profile-based multiplex function for detecting lung cancer.', 'The performance of a novel amino acid multivariate index for detecting lung cancer: A case control study in Korea.', 'A Novel Multivariate Index for Pancreatic Cancer Detection Based On the Plasma Free Amino Acid Profile.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Plasma free amino acid profile in cancer patients.', 'Common alterations in plasma free amino acid profiles and gut microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites of five types of cancer patients.', 'Dietary Manipulation of Amino Acids for Cancer Therapy.', 'Possible-sarcopenic screening with disturbed plasma amino acid profile in the elderly.', 'UPLC-Q-TOF/MS-Based Serum Metabolomics Reveals Potential Anti-tumor Mechanism of Banxia Xiexin Decoction in Colorectal Cancer Mice.', 'Cross-sectional relationships between general and central adiposity and plasma amino acids in Chinese adults.']"""

However, the mechanisms that regulate AR function in prostate cancer are poorly known. We report here a new paradigm for the forkhead protein FoxA1 action in androgen signalling. Besides pioneering the AR pathway, FoxA1 depletion elicited extensive redistribution of AR-binding sites (ARBs) on LNCaP-1F5 cell chromatin that was commensurate with changes in androgen-dependent gene expression signature. We identified three distinct classes of ARBs and androgen-responsive genes: (i) independent of FoxA1, (ii) pioneered by FoxA1 and (iii) masked by FoxA1 and functional upon FoxA1 depletion. FoxA1 depletion also reprogrammed AR binding in VCaP cells, and glucocorticoid receptor binding and glucocorticoid-dependent signalling in LNCaP-1F5 cells. Importantly, FoxA1 protein level in primary prostate tumour had significant association to disease outcome; high FoxA1 level was associated with poor prognosis, whereas low FoxA1 level, even in the presence of high AR expression, predicted good prognosis. The role of FoxA1 in androgen signalling and prostate cancer is distinctly different from that in oestrogen signalling and breast cancer.""","""['Biswajyoti Sahu', 'Marko Laakso', 'Kristian Ovaska', 'Tuomas Mirtti', 'Johan Lundin', 'Antti Rannikko', 'Anna Sankila', 'Juha-Pekka Turunen', 'Mikael Lundin', 'Juho Konsti', 'Tiina Vesterinen', 'Stig Nordling', 'Olli Kallioniemi', 'Sampsa Hautaniemi', 'Olli A Jänne']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""EMBO J""","""['FoxA1 specifies unique androgen and glucocorticoid receptor binding events in prostate cancer cells.', 'Cooperativity and equilibrium with FOXA1 define the androgen receptor transcriptional program.', 'Elevated levels of FOXA1 facilitate androgen receptor chromatin binding resulting in a CRPC-like phenotype.', 'FOXA1: a transcription factor with parallel functions in development and cancer.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Joint analysis of WES and RNA-Seq identify signature genes related to metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Stem Cells and Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'TRAF4-mediated nonproteolytic ubiquitination of androgen receptor promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

We identified and quantified a population ageing factor, a factor due to incidence trend of cancer sites with early-diagnosis interventions and a remainder factor (concerning all other cancer sites).  Methods:   We calculated incidence rates for two calendar period (1993-95 and 2003-05).We used data from Cancer Registries with at least one incidence year available for each period (jointly for males and female). We compared crude and age-adjusted rates by the direct method for prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma of the skin cancer, thyroid cancer, group of other cancer sites and for all cancer sites (but non-melanoma skin cancer).  Results:   Since 1993-95 to 2003-05 all cancer crude incidence rates have been increasing 17.9% (from 555.4 cases for 100,000 inhabitants/years to 654.8). If population age structure had remained the same, rates would have increased only 6.6% (from 555.4 to 592.0): almost 2/3 of observed increasing are due to population ageing. The remainder part of the increasing is due to incidence trend of cancer sites with early-diagnosis interventions (that anticipates the diagnosis).

Cancer mortality time trends show that southern Italy is progressively losing its lower mortality gap as compared to the North of the country. The mortality contribution of this pattern at a fine geographical scale (provinces) has not been extensively studied in southern Italy.  Objective:   To provide a cancer mortality profile in the 23 provinces of South Italy.  Design:   Descriptive geographical study at population level.  Setting:   Cancer mortality analysis by main causes of death and gender, conducted between 1999 and 2003. We computed age-standardized rates (reference World population) (ASR) as well as standardized mortality ratios (South Italy as reference population) (SMR) to compare mortality between geographical areas.  Main outcome measures:   Mortality from all cancer causes and from major neoplasms.  Results:   In southern Italy, ASRs for all cancer causes (benign and malignant) were 149.3/105 in males and 81.0/105 in females. In both genders, these rates were lower than rates in Italy as a whole (-8% in males and -9% in females). Cancer mortality ASRs for liver, prostate, urinary organs, melanoma and skin, and neoplasms of lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues displayed weak, or barely any, differences between the South and Italy as a whole. Statistically significant (p<0.01) mortality excesses were observed in 7 out of 23 examined provinces, with highest frequency excesses in Naples and Caserta provinces. In males liver cancer mortality showed a SMR excess of 30- 50% in 4/23 provinces. Female breast cancer mortality displayed a 10% excess in 3/23 provinces.  Conclusions:   Although this analysis highlighted a lower mortality in southern Italy, as compared to Italy as a whole, seven provinces showed excesses mainly for liver and breast cancers. Current knowledge on cancer etiology explains the vast majority of such observed excesses. Further analyses will help in designing and monitoring cancer prevention and early diagnosis interventions also in South Italy.""","""['Ettore Bidoli', 'Maurizio Montella', 'Silvia Bruzzone', 'Angela De Paoli', 'Mario Fusco', 'Luisa Frova', 'Monica Pace', 'Marilena Pappagallo', 'Diego Serraino']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Epidemiol Prev""","""['Benvenuti al sud.', 'Forse tabacco, alcol e dieta non spiegano tutto.', 'State of health of populations residing in geothermal areas of Tuscany.', 'Mortality Atlas of the Campania Region.

Red clover (RC) isoflavones inhibits transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced androgenicity. Mechanisms controlling those activities were explored. Three hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs), 3β-HSD, HSD-17β1 and HSD-17β5 involved in metabolizing DHEA to testosterone (TESTO) were investigated. Individual depletion of HSDs in 6S cells significantly reduced TGF-β1/DHEA-induced PSA in LAPC-4 cells in cocultures. Monomer amounts of 3β-HSD were similar without or with TGF-β1 in both cell types but aggregates of 3β-HSD in 6S cells were much higher than those in LAPC-4 cells and were upregulated by TGFβ in 6S cells. Basal and TGF-β1-treated levels of HSD-17β1 and HSD-17β5 in LAPC-4 cells were significantly lower than in 6S cells, whereas levels of HSD-17β1 but not HSD-17β5 were TGFβ inducible. 6S cell HSD genes expression induced by TGFβ or androgen signaling was insignificant to contribute TGF-β1/DHEA-upregulated protein levels of HSDs. RC decreased TGF-β1- upregulation of aggregates of 3β-HSD but not HSD-17β1. Depletion of TGFβ receptors (TGFβ Rs) reduced TGF-β1/DHEA-upregulated HSDs and TESTO. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that TGF-β1 disrupted associations of TGFβ Rs/HSDs aggregates, whereas RC suppressed the dissociations of aggregates of 3β-HSD but not HSD-17β1 from the receptors. Given that TGFβ Rs are recycled with or without ligand, TGF-β1-induced disassociation of the HSDs from TGFβ Rs may increase stability and activity of the HSDs.

Methods:   A total of 32 fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens of metastatic prostate carcinomas were retrieved from the pathology files at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The metastatic sites included the pelvic and remote lymph nodes, liver, bone, and thyroid gland. Immunohistochemical staining for PSA, PAP, synaptophysin, chromogranin A was performed. TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion was evaluated on sections of cell blocks by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using ERG gene break-apart probes.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 67 years. Twenty-six patients had a previous history of prostatic adenocarcinoma, while 6 patients presented initially with metastasis. In 11 patients, the metastatic lesions showed characteristic features of small cell carcinoma (SCC) and were positive for synaptophysin (9/9), chromogranin A (7/8), but negative for prostatic specific antigen (7/7). FISH analysis demonstrated a rearrangement of ERG gene in 10 of 32 cases (31.3%), and the rearrangement was associated with deletion of the 5' ERG gene in 6 cases. In addition, the copy number of ERG rearrangement gene locus was increased in 8 cases. Among the 11 cases with SCC features, a rearrangement of ERG gene was present in 5 cases, of which a deletion of the 5' ERG gene and increased copy number were seen in 3 cases.  Conclusions:   TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion can be evaluated in FNA specimens of metastatic prostate cancer. Metastatic prostate cancers have a high prevalence of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion along with a frequent copy number increase of ERG gene.

Thus, the aims of this work were to characterize and correlate the occurrence and extent of retraction clefting with the reactivities of α and β dystroglycan (αDG, βDG), laminin, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), p63, insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1), vimentin, and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2). The study was based on nonneoplastic and neoplastic prostatic tissues obtained from necropsies and retropubic radical prostatectomies. The results showed that periacinar retraction clefting was significantly more frequent in prostatic carcinoma samples than in normal prostatic acini. Most of the neoplastic acini (72.0%) showed retraction clefting of more than 50% of circumference, which were significantly more frequent in Gleason score 7 and 6. Decreased collagen and reticular and elastic fibers were verified in the stroma around neoplastic acini. Weak and discontinuous αDG, βDG, and laminin immunoreactivities and intensified MMP-2, vimentin, IGF-1 and FGF-2 immunoreactivities were verified in the neoplastic acini; p63 immunoreactivity was negative in all carcinomas. Thus, these findings showed that the lack of epithelial basal cells, DGs, and laminin and increased MMP-2, IGF-1, and FGF-7 could be considered important pathways in periacinar retraction occurrence.

We examined the effects of lycopene and fish oil on prostate gene expression in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.  Methods:   Eighty-four men with low risk prostate cancer were stratified based on self-reported dietary consumption of fish and tomatoes and then randomly assigned to a 3-month intervention of lycopene (n = 29) or fish oil (n = 27) supplementation or placebo (n = 28). Gene expression in morphologically normal prostate tissue was studied at baseline and at 3 months via cDNA microarray analysis. Differential gene expression and pathway analyses were performed to identify genes and pathways modulated by these micronutrients.  Results:   Global gene expression analysis revealed no significant individual genes that were associated with high intake of fish or tomato at baseline or after 3 months of supplementation with lycopene or fish oil. However, exploratory pathway analyses of rank-ordered genes (based on p-values not corrected for multiple comparisons) revealed the modulation of androgen and estrogen metabolism in men who routinely consumed more fish (p = 0.029) and tomato (p = 0.008) compared to men who ate less. In addition, modulation of arachidonic acid metabolism (p = 0.01) was observed after 3 months of fish oil supplementation compared with the placebo group; and modulation of nuclear factor (erythroid derived-2) factor 2 or Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response for either supplement versus placebo (fish oil: p = 0.01, lycopene: p = 0.001).

Methods:   We assessed the age-standardized prevalence of BPH and/or LUTS among West Africans in a probability sample of 950 men aged 50-74 in Accra, Ghana, with no evidence of biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer after screening with PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). Information on LUTS was based on self-reports of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). BPH was estimated using DRE, PSA levels and imputed prostate volume.  Results:   The prevalence of DRE-detected enlarged prostate was 62.3%, while that of PSA≥1.5 ng ml(-1) (an estimate of prostate volume ≥ 30 cm(3)) was 35.3%. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe LUTS (IPSS≥8) was 19.9%. The prevalence of IPSS≥8 and an enlarged prostate on DRE was 13.3%. Although there is no universally agreed-upon definition of BPH/LUTS, making comparisons across populations difficult, BPH and/or LUTS appear to be quite common among older Ghanaian men.  Conclusions:   We found that after age standardization, the prevalence of DRE-detected enlarged prostate in Ghanaian men is higher than previously reported for American men, but the prevalence of LUTS was lower than previously reported for African Americans.

Our aim was to determine the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in prostate carcinomas in relation to intratumoral microvessel density (MVD), tumor grade and androgen receptor (AR) status.  Materials and methods:   The expression of AR, VEGF-A and COX-2 was immunohistochemically evaluated in 24 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 139 prostate carcinoma cases. MVD was evaluated by CD34 immunostaining.  Results:   Nuclear AR expression was inversely related to tumor grade (p < 0.001). MVD was strongly related to tumor grade, VEGF-A and COX-2 (p < 0.001 in all comparisons). VEGF-A expression increased with tumor grade (p < 0.01) and was inversely related to stromal AR expression. COX-2 was present in both BPH and prostate carcinoma, but its expression increased with tumor grade (p < 0.01). High-grade neoplasms presented low-to-moderate VEGF staining intensity compared to strong COX-2 expression.  Conclusions:   Both VEGF-A and COX-2 expression is positively correlated with tumor grade and MVD.

Earlier diagnosis increases survival rate in patients. However, treatments for advanced disease are limited to hormone ablation techniques and palliative care. Thus, new methods of treatment and prevention are necessary for inhibiting disease progression to a hormone refractory state. One of the approaches to control prostate cancer is prevention through diet, which inhibits one or more neoplastic events and reduces the cancer risk. For centuries, Ayurveda has recommended the use of bitter melon (Momordica charantia) as a functional food to prevent and treat human health related issues. In this study, we have initially used human prostate cancer cells, PC3 and LNCaP, as an in vitro model to assess the efficacy of bitter melon extract (BME) as an anticancer agent. We observed that prostate cancer cells treated with BME accumulate during the S phase of the cell cycle and modulate cyclin D1, cyclin E, and p21 expression. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with BME enhanced Bax expression and induced PARP cleavage. Oral gavage of BME, as a dietary compound, delayed the progression to high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate) mice (31%). Prostate tissue from BME-fed mice displayed approximately 51% reduction of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression.

Because of 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) therapeutic potential in treating cancers, numerous analogues have been synthesized with an attempt to increase anti-proliferative and/or decrease calcemic properties. Among these analogues, 19-nor-1α,25(OH)(2)D(2) while being less calcemic has equivalent potency as 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) in several in vitro and in vivo systems. We recently showed that 19-nor-2α-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) (MART-10) was at least 500-fold and 10-fold more active than 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) in inhibiting the proliferation of an immortalized normal prostate PZ-HPV-7 cells and the invasion of androgen insensitive PC-3 prostate cancer cells, respectively. In this study, we further investigated the effects of MART-10 and 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) on the dose- and time-dependent induction of CYP24A1 gene expression in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. We found that MART-10 induced CYP24A1 gene expression at a lower concentration with a longer duration compared to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3), suggesting that MART-10 is less susceptible to CYP24A1 degradation. Molecular docking model of human CYP24A1 and MART-10 indicates that its side chain is far away from the heme ion and is less likely to be hydroxylated by the enzyme. Furthermore, MART-10 was a more potent inhibitor of PC-3 cell proliferation and invasion compared to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3). In addition, MART-10 down-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression which could be one mechanism whereby MART-10 influences cancer cell invasion. Finally, we observed that subcutaneous administration of MART-10 up-regulated the CYP24A1 mRNA expression in rat kidneys without affecting their plasma calcium levels.

Methods:   A prospective pre-test-post-test descriptive survey was conducted on a convenience sample of 73 men with prostate cancer who were recruited from a Regional Cancer Centre in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Participants receiving radiation treatment (brachy therapy, high dose radiation [HDR] and external beam radiation [EBR], or EBR alone) completed a questionnaire that elicited information pertaining to quality of life (QOL), symptom experiences, and perceived health state prior to, and one month after completion of their radiation treatment.  Results:   Post-treatment scores showed increased problems with urinary bother (p<0.001) and function (p<0.001), bowel bother (p=0.002) and function (p=0.001), and sexual function (p<0.001). The results also suggested that urinary bother, sexual bother, and pain were independent predictors of the perceived health state of participants after radiation treatment.  Discussion:   Our findings suggest that prostate cancer treatment presents a challenge with regard to symptom experiences and perceived health state in men with prostate cancer. Therefore, strategies for patient education to assist men to cope with their symptoms and to provide them with support in the initial weeks following treatment are discussed.""","""['Sheila Cameron', 'Colvin Springer', 'Susan Fox-Wasylyshyn', 'Maher M El-Masri']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur J Oncol Nurs""","""['Radical prostatectomy versus high-dose rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: effects on health-related quality of life.', 'Quality of life study in prostate cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: comparing late bowel and bladder quality of life symptoms to that of the normal population.', 'Prostate cancer survivors who would be eligible for active surveillance but were either treated with radiotherapy or managed expectantly: comparisons on long-term quality of life and symptom burden.', 'Health-related quality of life and treatment outcomes for men with prostate cancer treated by combined external-beam radiotherapy and hormone therapy.', 'What Aspects of Personal Care Are Most Important to Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer?', 'Relationship Between Self-Perceived Health, Vitality, and Posttraumatic Growth in Liver Transplant Recipients.', 'Transitions in Symptom Cluster Subgroups Among Men Undergoing Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Quality of Life and Sexual Health in the Aging of PCa Survivors.']"""

Methods:   We analysed the data of 1 571 men with prostatic adenocarcinoma treated between January 1997 and December 2008 at out institution, a tertiary level public secotr hospital serving a largely indigent population. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's, the Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests where appropriate (p<0.05 accepted as statistically significant).  Results:   Of 1 571 men, 47 (3%) were aged < 50 years.

The knowledge of such a background set of experiments can be used to compute expected gene behavior based on known links. It is particularly interesting to detect previously unseen specific effects in other experiments. Here, a new method to spot genes deviating from expected behavior (PAttern DEviation SCOring--Padesco) is devised. It uses linear regression models learned from a background set to arrive at gene specific prediction accuracy distributions. For a given experiment, it is then decided whether each gene is predicted better or worse than expected. This provides a novel way to estimate the experiment specificity of each gene.

Curcumin, a yellow curry pigment, has been reported to enhance androgen receptor (AR) degradation. We examined the effects of curcumin on increasing PSA expression by hypoxia and prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, L-mimosine and dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells.  Methods and results:   The 3H-thymidine incorporation assay revealed that either L-mimosine or DMOG treatments attenuated cell proliferation. Immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) indicated that both L-mimosine and DMOG have an effect similar to hypoxia, which stabilized hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and induced PSA gene expression. The results of the immunoblot and transient gene expression assays indicated that induction of the PSA expression by hypoxia is both HIF-1α- and AR-dependent.

One candidate molecule which might be involved in GBC development is prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface antigen with a tissue-specific pattern of expression in the epithelium of several organs, such as the prostate, stomach, bladder, and gallbladder. It is up-regulated in a number of cancers including prostate, urinary bladder, and pancreatic cancers, while it is down-regulated in esophageal and gastric cancers, suggesting that PSCA has an oncogenic activity in the former but a tumor suppressor activity in the latter. However, the precise function of PSCA and the regulatory mechanism for its expression in normal and cancer cells are yet to be determined. In this study, immunohistochemical analyses with a specific antibody revealed that PSCA is down-regulated in non-neoplastic gallbladder lesions such as cholesterolosis, cholecystolithiasis, and cholecystitis (9/17; 53%), and also in adenocarcinoma (40/44; 91%), a common neoplasm in gallbladder. Analyses of the DNA methylation status in the GBC cell lines by bisulfite-Pyrosequencing and a reporter assay for the PSCA promoter activity suggested that the down-regulation is explained, at least partly, by DNA methylation. Moreover, colony formation assay revealed that PSCA has cell-proliferation inhibition activity in the GBC cell lines, which was also observed in vivo. These lines of in vivo and in vitro evidence suggest that PSCA is acting as a tumor suppressor in GBC development.""","""['Hiroe Ono', 'Nobuyoshi Hiraoka', 'Yeon-Su Lee', 'Sang Myung Woo', 'Woo Jin Lee', 'Il Ju Choi', 'Akira Saito', 'Kazuyoshi Yanagihara', 'Yae Kanai', 'Sumiko Ohnami', 'Fumiko Chiwaki', 'Hiroki Sasaki', 'Hiromi Sakamoto', 'Teruhiko Yoshida', 'Norihisa Saeki']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Genes Chromosomes Cancer""","""['Down-regulation of Immune-related Genes by PSCA in Gallbladder Cancer Cells Implanted into Mice.', 'PSCA gene variants (rs2294008 and rs2978974) confer increased susceptibility of gallbladder carcinoma in females.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) expression in human prostate cancer tissues: implications for prostate carcinogenesis and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen and cancer risk, mechanisms and therapeutic implications.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: a Jekyll and Hyde molecule?', 'The Correlation between PSCA Expression and Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of PSCA gene polymorphisms in modulating gastric cancer risk in the Chinese population.', 'Prostate-specific markers to identify rare prostate cancer cells in liquid biopsies.', 'PSCA expression is associated with favorable tumor features and reduced PSA recurrence in operated prostate cancer.', 'Correlation between prostate stem cell antigen gene expression and oral squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Because of their low cost and safety, patients commonly use a variety of dietary supplements, although evidence of their efficacy is often lacking. One such commonly used food supplement is Zyflamend, a polyherbal preparation with potent anti-inflammatory activities and preclinical efficacy against prostate and oral cancer. Whether Zyflamend has any efficacy against human pancreatic cancer alone or in combination with gemcitibine, a commonly used agent, was examined in cell cultures and in an orthotopic mouse model. In vitro, Zyflamend inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines regardless of p53 status and also enhanced gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. This finding correlated with inhibition of NF-κB activation by Zyflamend and suppression of cyclin D1, c-myc, COX-2, Bcl-2, IAP, survivin, VEGF, ICAM-1 and CXCR4. In nude mice, oral administration of Zyflamend alone significantly inhibited the growth of orthotopically transplanted human pancreatic tumors, and when combined with gemcitabine, further enhanced the antitumor effects. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses of tumor tissue showed that the suppression of pancreatic cancer growth correlated with inhibition of proliferation index marker (Ki-67), COX-2, MMP-9, NF-κB and VEGF. Overall, these results suggest that the concentrated multiherb product Zyflamend alone can inhibit the growth of human pancreatic tumors and, in addition, can sensitize pancreatic cancers to gemcitabine through the suppression of multiple targets linked to tumorigenesis.""","""['Ajaikumar B Kunnumakkara', 'Bokyung Sung', 'Jayaraj Ravindran', 'Parmeswaran Diagaradjane', 'Amit Deorukhkar', 'Sanjit Dey', 'Cemile Koca', 'Zhimin Tong', 'Juri G Gelovani', 'Sushovan Guha', 'Sunil Krishnan', 'Bharat B Aggarwal']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['{Gamma}-tocotrienol inhibits pancreatic tumors and sensitizes them to gemcitabine treatment by modulating the inflammatory microenvironment.', 'Curcumin potentiates antitumor activity of gemcitabine in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer through suppression of proliferation, angiogenesis, and inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated gene products.', 'Piperlongumine Suppresses Growth and Sensitizes Pancreatic Tumors to Gemcitabine in a Xenograft Mouse Model by Modulating the NF-kappa B Pathway.', 'Resveratrol, a multitargeted agent, can enhance antitumor activity of gemcitabine in vitro and in orthotopic mouse model of human pancreatic cancer.', 'Effect of NF-κB inhibition on chemoresistance in biliary-pancreatic cancer.', 'Curcumin Formulations for Better Bioavailability: What We Learned from Clinical Trials Thus Far?', 'Targeting Autophagy Using Long Non-Coding RNAs (LncRNAs): New Landscapes in the Arena of Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Demystifying the Functional Role of Nuclear Receptors in Esophageal Cancer.', 'Oroxylin A: A Promising Flavonoid for Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Diseases.', 'The promising potential of piperlongumine as an emerging therapeutics for cancer.']"""

Objective:   We sought to characterize treatment type and subsequent survival for men with no more than a single comorbid condition.  Design and participants:   We conducted a retrospective study of 1,031 veterans with non-metastatic prostate cancer diagnosed in 1997-2004 at the Greater Los Angeles and Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Centers and followed until 2010. We used multivariate analyses to determine probabilities and relative risks of undergoing treatment for each health state and competing-risks regression analyses to model non-prostate cancer mortality.  Results:   Compared with subjects without any comorbid conditions, only men with moderate-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were less likely to receive definitive treatment for their prostate cancer (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.44-0.99). Men with all other individual comorbidities were equally likely as men without comorbidity to receive definitive treatment. Compared with men without any comorbidities, a higher hazard rate for non-prostate cancer mortality was identified among men with diabetes without end-organ damage (HR 2.32; 95% CI 1.32-4.08), peripheral vascular disease (HR 2.77; 95% CI 1.14-6.73), moderate-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 5.46; 95% CI 2.68-11.12), diabetes with end-organ damage (HR 4.27; 95% CI 1.64-11.10), those in need of a mobility device (HR 3.29; 95% CI 1.87-5.80), and men with history of alcoholism (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.07-2.93).

In this context we describe a new stereotactic prostate biopsy system, which integrates pre-interventional MRI with peri-interventional ultrasound for targeted perineal prostate biopsies. Furthermore, the novel system allows exact documentation of biopsies in three dimensions.  Patients and methods:   Stereotactic biopsy was performed in 50 consecutive men with suspicion of PC [median age 67 years (42-77), mean PSA 8.9±6.8 ng/ml, and mean prostate volume 51±23.7 ml]. Twenty-five of these patients (50%) had already had a negative transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy. All men underwent multiparametric, contrast-enhanced 3T MRI without endorectal coil. Suspicious lesions were marked before the obtained data were transferred to a novel stereotactic biopsy system. Using a custom-made biplane TRUS probe mounted on a stepper, 3-D ultrasound data were generated and fused with the MRI. As a result, suspicious MRI lesions were superimposed onto the TRUS data. Next, 3-D biopsy planning was performed including systematic biopsies from the peripheral zone of the prostate. According to local standards patients were treated with perioperative quinolone antibiotics and applied a rectal enema the evening before the procedure. Perineal biopsies were taken under live US imaging, and the location of each biopsy was documented in an individual 3-D model. Feasibility, safety, target registration error, and cancer detection were evaluated.  Results:   The median number of biopsies taken per patient was 24 (12-36). In 27 men of the initial cohort of 50 consecutive patients presented here, biopsy samples showed PC (54%). In patients undergoing their first biopsy, cancerous lesions were diagnosed in 13 of 19 patients (68%). The result was positive in 36% of men undergoing a re-biopsy without previous cancer diagnosis (9/25). A positive correlation between MRI findings and histopathology was found in 72%. In MRI lesions marked as highly suspicious, the tumor detection rate was 100% (13/13). Looking at single cores from highly suspicious lesions, 40 of 75 (53%) biopsies were positive. The target registration error of the first 1,159 biopsy cores was 1.7 mm. Regarding adverse effects, one patient experienced urinary retention and one patient a perineal hematoma. Urinary tract infections did not occur.  Conclusion:   Perineal stereotactic prostate biopsies guided by the combination of MRI and ultrasound allow effective examination of suspicious MRI lesions. Each biopsy core taken is documented accurately for its location in 3-D enabling MRI validation and tailored treatment planning.

Acid ceramidase (AC) hydrolyzes ceramide, and thus reduces intracellular levels of this proapoptotic lipid. The role of AC as a putative anticancer target is supported by reports of upregulation in prostate cancer and in some breast tumors. In this study, we determined whether the introduction of an AC inhibitor would enhance the apoptosis-inducing effects of C6-ceramide (C6-cer) in breast cancer cells. Cultured breast cancer cells were treated with DM102 [(2R,3Z)-N-(1-hydroxyoctadec-3-en-2-yl)pivalamide, C6-cer, or the combination. Cell viability and cytotoxic synergy were assessed. Activation of apoptotic pathways, generation of reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial transmembrane potential were determined. DM102 was a more effective AC inhibitor than N-oleoylethanolamine (NOE) and (1R,2R)-2-N-(tetradecanoylamino)-1-(4'-nitrophenyl)-1,3-propandiol (B-13) in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and BT-474 cells. As single agents, C6-cer (IC(50) 5-10 μM) and DM102 (IC(50) 20 μM) were only moderately cytotoxic in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and SK-BR-3 cells. Co-administration, however, produced synergistic decreases in viability (combination index <0.5) in all cell lines. Apoptosis was confirmed in MDA-MB-231 cells by detection of caspase 3 cleavage and a >3-fold increase in caspase 3/7 activation, PARP cleavage, and a >70% increase in Annexin-V positive cells. C6-cer/DM102 increased ROS levels 4-fold in MDA-MB-231 cells, shifted the ratio of Bax:Bcl-2 to >9-fold that of control cells, and resulted in mitochondrial membrane depolarization. DM102 also increased the synthesis of (3)H-palmitate-labeled long-chain ceramides by 2-fold when C6-cer was present. These data support the effectiveness of targeting AC in combination with exogenous short-chain ceramide as an anticancer strategy, and warrant continued investigation into the utility of the C6-cer/DM102 drug duo in human breast cancer.""","""['Margaret Flowers', 'Gemma Fabriás', 'Antonio Delgado', 'Josefina Casas', 'Jose Luis Abad', 'Myles C Cabot']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Apoptosis induced by intracellular ceramide accumulation in MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells is dependent on the generation of reactive oxygen species.', 'Novel ceramide analogs as potential chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer.', 'Targeting ceramide metabolic pathway induces apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines.', 'Acid ceramidase, an emerging target for anti-cancer and anti-angiogenesis.', 'Tamoxifen regulation of sphingolipid metabolism--Therapeutic implications.', 'Engineered Lipidic Nanomaterials Inspired by Sphingomyelin Metabolism for Cancer Therapy.', 'Cross-Regulation of the Cellular Redox System, Oxygen, and Sphingolipid Signalling.', 'Cell-intrinsic ceramides determine T cell function during melanoma progression.', 'A genome-wide CRISPR screen implicates plasma membrane asymmetry in exogenous C6-ceramide toxicity.', 'diTFPP, a Phenoxyphenol, Sensitizes Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells to C2-Ceramide-Induced Autophagic Stress by Increasing Oxidative Stress and ER Stress Accompanied by LAMP2 Hypoglycosylation.']"""

After subcutaneous transplantation of several human cancer cell lines (colorectal, non-small cell lung, small cell lung, prostate, ovarian and gastric cancer cells) to nude mice, IHL-305 or CPT-11 was administered intravenously 3 times at 4-day intervals. In all xenograft models tested, IHL-305 showed superior antitumor activity to that of CPT‑11 and a comparable tumor-growth-inhibitory effect at one-eighth or less of the dose of CPT-11, even against HT-29 colorectal and NCI-H460 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, which show intrinsic resistance to CPT-11. A single injection or 2 injections of IHL-305 on several dosing schedules also resulted in a significant antitumor effect compared to that of vehicle control in a dose-dependent manner and showed comparable antitumor activity at about one-fifth the dose of the maximum tolerated dose of CPT-11. The analysis of the concentrations of irinotecan and SN-38, an active metabolite of CPT-11, in plasma and tumors revealed that irinotecan was maintained at high concentrations, and the prolonged presence of SN-38 in plasma and tumors in IHL-305 treated mice compared with CPT-11-treated mice. Therefore, the stronger tumor inhibitory effect of IHL-305, as compared to CPT-11, was associated with the difference in the concentration of irinotecan in plasma or tumors after each agent was administered and with the maintainance of a higher concentration of SN-38.

Green tea extract (GTE) has been proved to be one of the most promising natural substances capable of inhibiting PCa progression in animal models (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate), as well as in humans. However, the cellular targets of the GTE action are mostly unknown. The main objective of this work was to investigate whether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus (GA), known to be actively involved in sensing stress stimuli and initiating and propagating cell death signalling, may represent the subcellular targets of GTE action. To this end, 42 TRAMP mice were divided into four experimental groups: groups II and IV, received GTE in tap water (0.3 g/100 ml solution) starting at 8 weeks of age and up to the time of sacrifice. Groups I and III were respective age-matched water-fed controls. The animals were sacrificed after 4 weeks (groups I and II) or 40 weeks of treatment (groups II and IV). We also treated TRAMP-C2 cells with GTE (20 µg/ml for 7 days) to check the expression profile of clusterin (CLU), a protein involved in prostate tumourigenesis, extensively processed through ER-GA before being secreted through the plasma membrane. In vivo we found that chronic administration of GTE in TRAMP mice results in collapse of ER and GA in prostate epithelial cells. Consistently, in vitro we found that the mature, fully processed form of CLU, sCLU, is strongly reduced by GTE treatment in TRAMP-C2 cells.

We developed a MitoExpress array for rapid analysis of all known nuclear genes encoding the mitochondrial proteome. The gene-expression pattern was compared among a normal breast epithelial cell line, its rho(0) derivative, breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors. Among several genes, our study revealed that over-expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP2 in rho(0) breast epithelial cells reflects gene expression changes in breast cancer cell lines and in primary breast tumors. Furthermore, over-expression of UCP2 was also found in leukemia, ovarian, bladder, esophagus, testicular, colorectal, kidney, pancreatic, lung and prostate tumors. Ectopic expression of UCP2 in MCF7 breast cancer cells led to a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased tumorigenic properties as measured by cell migration, in vitro invasion and anchorage independent growth. Consistent with in vitro studies, we demonstrate that UCP2 over-expression leads to development of tumors in vivo in an orthotopic model of breast cancer. Genipin, a plant derived small molecule, suppressed the UCP2 led tumorigenic properties, which were mediated by decreased reactive oxygen species and down-regulation of UCP2. However, UCP1, 3, 4 and 5 gene expression was unaffected. UCP2 transcription was controlled by SMAD4. Together, these studies suggest a tumor-promoting function of UCP2 in breast cancer. In summary, our studies demonstrate that i) the Warburg Effect is mediated by UCP2; ii) UCP2 is over-expressed in breast and many other cancers; iii) UCP2 promotes tumorigenic properties in vitro and in vivo and iv) genipin suppresses the tumor promoting function of UCP2.""","""['Vanniarajan Ayyasamy', 'Kjerstin M Owens', 'Mohamed Mokhtar Desouki', 'Ping Liang', 'Andrei Bakin', 'Kumarasamy Thangaraj', 'Donald J Buchsbaum', 'Albert F LoBuglio', 'Keshav K Singh']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Uncoupling protein-2 modulates myocardial excitation-contraction coupling.', 'Genipin-induced inhibition of uncoupling protein-2 sensitizes drug-resistant cancer cells to cytotoxic agents.', 'Negative regulation of UCP2 by TGFβ signaling characterizes low and intermediate-grade primary breast cancer.', 'Overexpression of uncoupling protein-2 in cancer: metabolic and heat changes, inhibition and effects on drug resistance.', 'UCP2, not a physiologically relevant uncoupler but a glucose sparing switch impacting ROS production and glucose sensing.', 'UCP2 as a Cancer Target through Energy Metabolism and Oxidative Stress Control.', 'Mechanism of tonifying-kidney Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of chronic heart failure.', 'Selenoproteins and the senescence-associated epitranscriptome.', 'Identification of UCP1 and UCP2 as Potential Prognostic Markers in Breast Cancer: A Study Based on Immunohistochemical Analysis and Bioinformatics.', 'Genipin, an Inhibitor of UCP2 as a Promising New Anticancer Agent: A Review of the Literature.']"""

The transcription factor Pax6 has recently been reported to act as a repressor of AR and to be hypermethylated in prostate cancer cells. SPBP is a transcriptional regulator that previously has been shown to enhance the activity of Pax6. In this study we have identified SPBP to act as a transcriptional coactivator of AR. We also show that Pax6 inhibits SPBP-mediated enhancement of AR activity on the AR target gene probasin promoter, a repression that was partly reversed by increased expression of SPBP. Enhanced expression of Pax6 reduced the amount of SPBP associated with the probasin promoter when assayed by ChIP in HeLa cells. We mapped the interaction between both AR and SPBP, and AR and Pax6 to the DNA-binding domains of the involved proteins. Further binding studies revealed that Pax6 and SPBP compete for binding to AR. These results suggest that Pax6 represses AR activity by displacing and/or inhibiting recruitment of coactivators to AR target promoters. Understanding the mechanism for inhibition of AR coactivators can give rise to molecular targeted drugs for treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Julianne Elvenes', 'Ernst Ivan Simon Thomassen', 'Sylvia Sagen Johnsen', 'Katrine Kaino', 'Eva Sjøttem', 'Terje Johansen']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Tumor suppressor PAX6 functions as androgen receptor co-repressor to inhibit prostate cancer growth.', 'The Optimedin gene is a downstream target of Pax6.', 'Phosphorylation and transactivation of Pax6 by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2.', 'Er81 is a downstream target of Pax6 in cortical progenitors.', 'Pax6 interactions with chromatin and identification of its novel direct target genes in lens and forebrain.', 'Disruption of MeCP2-TCF20 complex underlies distinct neurodevelopmental disorders.', 'Characterization of a castrate-resistant prostate cancer xenograft derived from a patient of West African ancestry.', 'Tyrosine aminotransferase is involved in the oxidative stress response by metabolizing meta-tyrosine in Caenorhabditis elegans.', 'De novo and inherited TCF20 pathogenic variants are associated with intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, and neurological impairments with similarities to Smith-Magenis syndrome.', 'Expression in the human brain of retinoic acid induced 1, a protein associated with neurobehavioural disorders.']"""

Vice versa, therapy-resistant cancer cells seem to manifest CSC phenotypes and properties. It has been generally assumed that drug-resistant cancer cells may all be CSCs although the generality of this assumption is unknown. Here, we chronically treated Du145 prostate cancer cells with etoposide, paclitaxel and some experimental drugs (i.e., staurosporine and 2 paclitaxel analogs), which led to populations of drug-tolerant cells (DTCs). Surprisingly, these DTCs, when implanted either subcutaneously or orthotopically into NOD/SCID mice, exhibited much reduced tumorigenicity or were even non-tumorigenic. Drug-tolerant DLD1 colon cancer cells selected by a similar chronic selection protocol also displayed reduced tumorigenicity whereas drug-tolerant UC14 bladder cancer cells demonstrated either increased or decreased tumor-regenerating capacity. Drug-tolerant Du145 cells demonstrated low proliferative and clonogenic potential and were virtually devoid of CD44(+) cells. Prospective knockdown of CD44 in Du145 cells inhibited cell proliferation and tumor regeneration, whereas restoration of CD44 expression in drug-tolerant Du145 cells increased cell proliferation and partially increased tumorigenicity. Interestingly, drug-tolerant Du145 cells showed both increases and decreases in many ""stemness"" genes. Finally, evidence was provided that chronic drug exposure generated DTCs via epigenetic mechanisms involving molecules such as CD44 and KDM5A. Our results thus reveal that 1) not all DTCs are necessarily CSCs; 2) conventional chemotherapeutic drugs such as taxol and etoposide may directly target CD44(+) tumor-initiating cells; and 3) DTCs generated via chronic drug selection involve epigenetic mechanisms.""","""['Hong Yan', 'Xin Chen', 'Qiuping Zhang', 'Jichao Qin', 'Hangwen Li', 'Can Liu', 'Tammy Calhoun-Davis', 'Luis Della Coletta', 'Jim Klostergaard', 'Izabela Fokt', 'Stanislaw Skora', 'Waldemar Priebe', 'Yongyi Bi', 'Dean G Tang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cancer stem-like cells enriched with CD29 and CD44 markers exhibit molecular characteristics with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in squamous cell carcinoma.', 'miR-199a-3p targets stemness-related and mitogenic signaling pathways to suppress the expansion and tumorigenic capabilities of prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Identification of gastric cancer stem cells using the cell surface marker CD44.', 'Activation of Matrix Hyaluronan-Mediated CD44 Signaling, Epigenetic Regulation and Chemoresistance in Head and Neck Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Cancer stem cell epigenetics and chemoresistance.', 'JMJD family proteins in cancer and inflammation.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'Cancer stem cells in head and neck cancer.', 'The emerging role of KDM5A in human cancer.', 'Metronomic chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

Methods:   Records from 1733 patients who underwent surgery for PDAC were analyzed for the occurrence of prior extrapancreatic malignancies. Patients' records showing extrapancreatic malignancies were then analyzed for tumor type, epidemiological data, risk factors, PDAC tumor stage, and long-term survival.  Results:   A total of 239 patients with PDAC (13.8%) had a history of 271 extrapancreatic tumors; 26 patients had a history of two pancreatic cancers, and 3 patients had 3 extrapancreatic cancers. The most common extrapancreatic tumors were breast cancer (56 patients) and prostate cancer (41 patients), followed by colorectal, reno/urothelial, and gynecologic tumors (39, 32, and 23 patients, respectively). No significant difference in overall survival was found between patients with PDAC with or without extrapancreatic malignancies.  Conclusions:   Pancreatic cancer is associated with extrapancreatic malignancies in a remarkable number of patients.

Method:   A partially observable Markov decision process model was used to optimize PSA screening decisions. Age-specific prostate cancer incidence rates and the mortality rates from prostate cancer and competing causes were considered. The model trades off the potential benefit of early detection with the cost of screening and loss of patient quality of life due to screening and treatment. PSA testing and biopsy decisions are made based on the patient's probability of having prostate cancer. Probabilities are inferred based on the patient's complete PSA history using Bayesian updating.  Data sources:   The results of all PSA tests and biopsies done in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1993 to 2005 (11,872 men and 50,589 PSA test results).  Outcome measures:   Patients' perspective: to maximize expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); societal perspective: to maximize the expected monetary value based on societal willingness to pay for QALYs and the cost of PSA testing, prostate biopsies, and treatment.  Results:   From the patient perspective, the optimal policy recommends stopping PSA testing and biopsy at age 76. From the societal perspective, the stopping age is 71. The expected incremental benefit of optimal screening over the traditional guideline of annual PSA screening with threshold 4.0 ng/mL for biopsy is estimated to be 0.165 QALYs per person from the patient perspective and 0.161 QALYs per person from the societal perspective. PSA screening based on traditional guidelines is found to be worse than no screening at all.

Many of the conventional prostate-specific promoters rely on the androgen axis to drive gene expression. However, considering the cancer heterogeneity and varying androgen receptor status, we herein evaluated the utility of prostate-specific enhancing sequence (PSES), an androgen-independent promoter in CRPC. The PSES is a fused enhancer derived from the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate-specific membrane antigen gene regulatory region. We augmented the activity of PSES by the two-step transcriptional amplification (TSTA) system to drive the expression of imaging reporter genes for either bioluminescent or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The engineered PSES-TSTA system exhibits greatly elevated transcriptional activity, androgen independency, and strong prostate specificity, verified in cell culture and preclinical animal experimentations. These advantageous features of PSES-TSTA elicit superior gene expression capability for CRPC in comparison with the androgen-dependent PSA promoter-driven system. In preclinical settings, we showed robust PET imaging capacity of PSES-TSTA in a castrated prostate xenograft model. Moreover, intravenous administrated PSES-TSTA bioluminescent vector correctly identified tibial bone marrow metastases in 9 of 9 animals, whereas NaF- and FDG-PET was unable to detect the lesions. Taken together, this study showed the promising utility of a potent, androgen-independent, and prostate cancer-specific expression system in directing gene-based molecular imaging in CRPC, even in the context of androgen deprivation therapy.""","""['Ziyue Karen Jiang', 'Makoto Sato', 'Liu H Wei', 'Chinghai Kao', 'Lily Wu']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Functionality of androgen receptor-based gene expression imaging in hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Configurations of a two-tiered amplified gene expression system in adenoviral vectors designed to improve the specificity of in vivo prostate cancer imaging.', 'Optimization of adenoviral vectors to direct highly amplified prostate-specific expression for imaging and gene therapy.', 'Human prostate cancer progression models and therapeutic intervention.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Establishment of xenografts of urological cancers on chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) to study metastasis.', 'PEG10 Promoter-Driven Expression of Reporter Genes Enables Molecular Imaging of Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Alpha-fetoprotein-targeted reporter gene expression imaging in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Molecular Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Quantitative volumetric imaging of normal, neoplastic and hyperplastic mouse prostate using ultrasound.']"""

Because score domains of the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) can be affected by factors such as recall intervals and psychological stress or discomfort due to cancer diagnosis and treatment, it is important to assess the prediagnostic baseline EF at appropriate times.  Aim:   To determine optimal timing to evaluate prediagnostic baseline EF in patients undergoing bilateral nerve sparing RLRP.  Methods:   Between March 2009 and February 2010, 54 patients ranging in age from 48 to 74 years were asked to complete IIEF-5 questionnaires before prostate biopsy, 1 day before RLRP, and 1 month after RLRP to assess preoperative baseline EF.  Main outcome measures:   Differences in the mean scores of IIEF-5 were analyzed using paired t-tests. The strengths of the linear relationships among the three IIEF-5 scores were quantified using Pearson's correlation coefficient. An interrator agreement analysis in distribution was performed using the kappa statistic to determine the degree of agreement among the IIEF-5 scores.  Results:   The mean IIEF-5 score before RLRP was significantly higher than the mean IIEF-5 score before prostate biopsy (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the mean IIEF-5 scores before prostate biopsy and 1 month following RLRP (P = 0.931). Scores of the IIEF-5 taken before prostate biopsy and 1 month following RLRP showed substantial agreement (kappa = 0.712), whereas scores of the IIEF-5 taken before prostate biopsy and before RLRP showed lower agreement (kappa = 0.325).  Conclusion:   To more accurately assess the prediagnostic baseline EF in patients with localized prostate cancer, the IIEF-5 questionnaire should be administered before prostate biopsy rather than before RLRP as cancer diagnosis-related symptoms and depression can affect IIEF-5 scores.""","""['Dong Suk Kim', 'Yeun Goo Chung', 'Dong Jun Kim', 'Kyung Kgi Park', 'Mun Su Chung', 'Dae Hoon Lee', 'Seung Hwan Lee', 'Sang Yol Mah', 'Byung Ha Chung']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Prospective comprehensive assessment of sexual function after retropubic non nerve sparing radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Recovery of Baseline Erectile Function in Men Following Radical Prostatectomy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Analysis Using Validated Measures.', 'Nightly vs on-demand sildenafil for penile rehabilitation after minimally invasive nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: results of a randomized double-blind trial with placebo.', 'Patient-reported validated functional outcome after extraperitoneal robotic-assisted nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: an objective assessment and review of the literature.', 'Comparison of the efficacy of the early LI-SWT plus daily tadalafil with daily tadalafil only as penile rehabilitation for postprostatectomy erectile dysfunction.', 'Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Radical Prostatectomy-a Contemporary Review.', 'Postprostatectomy Erectile Dysfunction: A Review.', 'Prevention and management of post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction.']"""

Nomograms are available that combine clinical and biopsy findings to predict the probability of pathologically insignificant prostate cancer in patients with clinically low-risk disease. Based on data from patients with Gleason score 6, clinical stage ≤ T2a and PSA <20 ng/ml, our group developed the first nomogram models for predicting insignificant prostate cancer that incorporated clinical data, detailed biopsy data and findings from MRI or MRI/MRSI (BJU Int. 2007;99(4):786-93). When tested retrospectively, these MR models performed significantly better than standard clinical models with and without detailed biopsy data. We prospectively validated the previously published MR-based nomogram models in a population of patients with Gleason score 6, clinical stage ≤ T2a and PSA <10 ng/ml. Based on data from this same population, we also developed two new models for predicting insignificant prostate cancer that combine MR findings and clinical data without detailed biopsy data. Upon initial testing, the new MR models performed significantly better than a clinical model lacking detailed biopsy data.  Objectives:   • To validate previously published nomograms for predicting insignificant prostate cancer (PCa) that incorporate clinical data, percentage of biopsy cores positive (%BC+) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or MRI/MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) results. • We also designed new nomogram models incorporating magnetic resonance results and clinical data without detailed biopsy data. Nomograms for predicting insignificant PCa can help physicians counsel patients with clinically low-risk disease who are choosing between active surveillance and definitive therapy.  Patients and methods:   • In total, 181 low-risk PCa patients (clinical stage T1c-T2a, prostate-specific antigen level <10 ng/mL, biopsy Gleason score of 6) had MRI/MRSI before surgery. • For MRI and MRI/MRSI, the probability of insignificant PCa was recorded prospectively and independently by two radiologists on a scale from 0 (definitely insignificant) to 3 (definitely significant PCa). • Insignificant PCa was defined on surgical pathology. • There were four models incorporating MRI or MRI/MRSI and clinical data with and without %BC+ that were compared with a base clinical model without %BC and a more comprehensive clinical model with %BC+. Prediction accuracy was assessed using areas under receiver-operator characteristic curves.  Results:   • At pathology, 27% of patients had insignificant PCa, and the Gleason score was upgraded in 56.4% of patients. • For both readers, all magnetic resonance models performed significantly better than the base clinical model (P ≤ 0.05 for all) and similarly to the more comprehensive clinical model.

So far, few publications have shown that a prediction model influences the behaviour of both physicians and patients. To our knowledge, it was unknown whether urologists and patients are compliant with the recommendations of a prostate cancer risk calculator and their reasons for non-compliance. Recommendations of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer risk calculator (ERSPC RC) about the need of a prostate biopsy were followed in most patients. In most cases of non-compliance with 'no biopsy' recommendations, a PSA level ≥ 3 ng/mL was decisive to opt for biopsy. Before implementation of the ERSPC RC in urological practices at a large scale, it is important to obtain insight into the use of guidelines that might counteract the adoption of the use of the RC as a result of opposing recommendations.  Objectives:   To assess both urologist and patient compliance with a 'no biopsy' or 'biopsy' recommendation of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Risk Calculator (RC), as well as their reasons for non-compliance. To assess determinants of patient compliance.  Patients and methods:   The ERSPC RC calculates the probability on a positive sextant prostate biopsy (P(posb) ) using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, outcomes of digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography, and ultrasonographically assessed prostate volume. A biopsy was recommended if P(posb) ≥20%. Between 2008 and 2011, eight urologists from five Dutch hospitals included 443 patients (aged 55-75 years) after a PSA test with no previous biopsy. Urologists calculated the P(posb) using the RC in the presence of patients and completed a questionnaire about compliance. Patients completed a questionnaire about prostate cancer knowledge, attitude towards prostate biopsy, self-rated health (12-Item Short Form Health Survey), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory-6, Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer) and decision-making measures (Decisional Conflict Scale).  Results:   Both urologists and patients complied with the RC recommendation in 368 of 443 (83%) cases. If a biopsy was recommended, almost all patients (96%; 257/269) complied, although 63 of the 174 (36%) patients were biopsied against the recommendation of the RC. Compliers with a 'no biopsy' recommendation had a lower mean P(posb) than non-compliers (9% vs 14%; P < 0.001). Urologists opted for biopsies against the recommendations of the RC because of an elevated PSA level (≥ 3 ng/mL) (78%; 49/63) and patients because they wanted certainty (60%; 38/63).  Conclusions:   Recommendations of the ERSPC RC on prostate biopsy were followed in most patients. The RC hence may be a promising tool for supporting clinical decision-making.""","""['Heidi A van Vugt', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Martijn Busstra', 'Paul Kil', 'Eric H Oomens', 'Igle J de Jong', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Ewout W Steyerberg', 'Ida Korfage']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Selecting men diagnosed with prostate cancer for active surveillance using a risk calculator: a prospective impact study.', 'Prospective validation of a risk calculator which calculates the probability of a positive prostate biopsy in a contemporary clinical cohort.', 'Comparison of risk calculators from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer in a contemporary Canadian cohort.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: the current evidence and guidelines controversy.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Integrating inflammatory serum biomarkers into a risk calculator for prostate cancer detection.', 'A risk calculator to inform the need for a prostate biopsy: a rapid access clinic cohort.', 'Real-world implementation of precision psychiatry: Transdiagnostic risk calculator for the automatic detection of individuals at-risk of psychosis.', 'eHealth and mHealth in prostate cancer detection and active surveillance.', 'Multivariable risk-based patient selection for prostate biopsy in a primary health care setting: referral rate and biopsy results from a urology outpatient clinic.']"""

This is the first publication addressing clinical outcome in patients with a tertiary Gleason grade pattern 4 or 5 showing a negative influence on clinical failure rates.  Objective:   To investigate the impact of a tertiary Gleason grade (TGG) pattern 4 or 5 on clinical failure, as the presence of a TGG pattern 4 or 5 in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens has been associated with biochemical failure.  Patients and methods:   In all, 151 consecutive patients undergoing RP between 1985 and 2006 were reviewed, and 148 patients met study inclusion criteria. The RP specimens were pathologically re-examined and the presence of a TGG pattern 4 or 5 was recorded. The endpoint was clinical failure defined as local recurrence and/or development of metastasis at a mean follow-up of 108 months. Univariate analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Clinical failure was more likely among men with presence of a TGG pattern 4 or 5 than in men without a TGG pattern 4 or 5 (P= 0.006). In the subgroup of patients with Gleason score 7 the presence of a TGG 5 was significantly associated with clinical failure rate (P= 0.002). In patients with Gleason score <7 or >7, a TGG pattern 4 or 5 was not associated with increased failure rates. Multivariate Cox regression analyses in patients with Gleason score 7 showed that a TGG pattern 5 was a statistically significant predictor of clinical failure when adjusting for pathological stage, surgical margin status, extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion (hazard ratio 4.03, 95% confidence interval 1.72-9.46; P= 0.001). Further subgroup analyses showed that a TGG pattern 5 was associated with statistically higher clinical progression rates in patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 (P= 0.03). In patients with Gleason score 4 + 3, a TGG pattern 5 was associated with a trend towards a higher clinical progression rate, although this was not statistically significant (P= 0.189).

Men with prostate cancer have higher rates of non-cancer mortality and CV morbidity and some of that excess risk has been attributed to the treatment they receive. ADT is an established treatment option for men with locally-advanced and metastatic prostate cancer and, although it has been shown to confer a disease-free survival advantage, it has also been associated with an increased incidence of CV disease and the metabolic syndrome (characterized by a cluster of CV risk factors, including insulin resistance). The benefits of the insulin sensitizer metformin and lifestyle intervention for reducing the incidence of metabolic syndrome have been shown in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. At the time of writing, the present study is the first to use metformin and lifestyle intervention in men with prostate cancer with the aim of reducing the risk of developing ADT-related CV morbidity and the metabolic syndrome. The study shows that lifestyle changes and metformin may indeed reduce the complications of androgen suppression in these men. Although further investigations are needed to establish which of the two interventions may be most beneficial, the favourable effects of a combination of these interventions on patients' quality of life and the potential for improved overall survival are of clinical significance.  Objective:   To investigate the effects of metformin and lifestyle changes on the development of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-related metabolic syndrome.  Patients and methods:   Men with prostate cancer due to receive ADT were recruited and randomized. Controls received ADT alone. Men in the intervention arm received ADT with 6 months of metformin, a low glycaemic index diet and an exercise programme. All patients were investigated pretreatment and at 6 months for the metabolic syndrome, as well as for related biochemical and physical parameters.  Results:   In total, 40 men were recruited and randomized (20 to each arm). After 6 months, significant improvements in abdominal girth (P= 0.05), weight (P < 0.001), body mass index (P < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (P= 0.01) were seen in the intervention arm compared to controls. Biochemical markers of insulin resistance did not differ significantly.  Conclusions:   The present study shows the potential benefits of metformin and lifestyle changes in ADT-treated men.

Patients and methods:   The subjects were 11 patients who met the above conditions and underwent salvage HDR-BT between December 2006 and January 2009. The T stage at the initial treatment was T1c in three patients, T2 in three patients and T3 in five patients. Ten patients received HDR-BT ± electron beam radiation therapy and one patient received proton beam irradiation. Follow-up after the completion of salvage HDR-BT lasted 18-41 months (mean 29 months). A dose of 11.0 Gy radiation was delivered twice (22.0Gy in total), separated by a 6-h interval, on the day the applicators were inserted.  Results:   Seven of the 11 cases remained in a biochemical non-evidence of disease state. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level continuously rose after salvage HDR-BT in three of the four other cases. Hormone administration was initiated in the four cases of PSA recurrence. No G3 or more severe events occurred, and the incidence of G2 was low during this study period.  Conclusion:   Of the 11 cases treated with salvage HDR-BT, PSA levels remained low in seven cases and the incidence of complications was also low.

To date, studies to evaluate clinical significance of prostate cancer detected on repeat biopsy in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy have yielded inconsistent results. The present study confirms that prostate cancer diagnosed after repeat biopsies is related to better pathological outcomes after radical prostatectomy, but not predictive of biochemical recurrence. Additionally, we find that the number of cores taken at initial biopsy do not affect the association between the number of previous biopsies and the prognosis.  Objective:   To determine whether repeat prostate biopsies are associated with more favourable prognoses compared with diagnosis at initial biopsy in patients who undergo radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and to determine if this association is affected by the number of cores taken at initial biopsy.  Patients and methods:   We reviewed 1147 patients with prostate cancer from 1991 to 2008. Patients were stratified into two groups by the number of biopsies before diagnosis (initial biopsy vs repeat biopsy: at least two biopsies). The effects of several variables on pathological outcomes and biochemical recurrence-free and systemic progression-free survivals were assessed.  Results:   Of the 1147 patients, 1064 (92.8%) were diagnosed with cancer at first biopsy and 83 (7.2%) at repeat biopsy. Compared with patients diagnosed at initial biopsy, those diagnosed at repeat biopsies were more likely to have a lower clinical stage (cT1c: 79.5% vs 55.5%, P < 0.001) and organ-confined tumours (78.3% vs 61.3%, P= 0.003), but there was no significant difference in initial biopsy core number (8.3 vs 8.7, P= 0.373). Five-year biochemical recurrence-free and progression-free survival rates did not show significant differences between the two groups (88.8% vs 82.2%, P= 0.078; 100.0% vs 96.5%, P= 0.105, respectively), and these results were not affected by the number of cores taken at initial biopsy.

Anti-androgens to reduce or prevent androgens binding to AR are widely used to suppress AR-mediated PCa growth; however, the androgen depletion therapy (ADT) is only effective for a short period of time. Here we tested PTS33, a new sodium derivative of cryptotanshinone, which can effectively inhibit the DHT-induced AR transactivation and PCa cell growth, and then explored the effects of PTS33 on inhibiting the expressions of AR target genes and proteins.  Methods:   PCa cells, LNCaP, CWR22Rv1, C4-2, PC-3, and DU145, were treated with PTS33 and luciferase assay was used to evaluate the ability of each to regulate AR transactivation. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the mRNA levels of AR target genes such as PSA, TMPRSS2, and TMEPA1. Western blot was used to determine AR, PSA, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and progesterone receptor (PR) protein expression. Cell growth and IC50 were determined by MTT assay after 48 hr treatment.  Results:   Our data showed that PTS33 selectively inhibits AR activities, but PTS33 does not repress the activities of other nuclear receptors, including ERα, GR, and PR. At a low concentration, 2 µM of PTS33 effectively suppresses the growth of AR-positive PCa cells, and has little effect on AR-negative PCa cells. Furthermore, our data indicated that PTS33 could modulate AR transactivation and suppress the AR target genes (PSA, TMPRSS2, and TMEPA1) expression in both androgen responsive PCa LNCaP cells and castration-resistant C4-2 cells. In addition, PTS33 can also inhibit estrogen/Δ5-androstenediol induced AR activities. The mechanistic studies indicate that PTS33 can inhibit AR function by suppression of AR protein expression, the AR N-C interaction, and AR-coregulator interaction.  Conclusions:   PTS33 has shown a good efficacy to inhibit AR transactivation, block AR regulated gene expression, and reduce cell growth in AR positive PCa cells. The structure of PTS33 could be used as a base for development of novel AR signaling inhibitors to treat PCa.""","""['Defeng Xu', 'Tzu-Hua Lin', 'Caixia Zhang', 'Yu-Chieh Tsai', 'Shaoshun Li', 'Jing Zhang', 'Min Yin', 'Shuyuan Yeh', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Baicalein suppresses the androgen receptor (AR)-mediated prostate cancer progression via inhibiting the AR N-C dimerization and AR-coactivators interaction.', 'Cryptotanshinone suppresses androgen receptor-mediated growth in androgen dependent and castration resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Pharmacological inhibition of androgen receptor expression induces cell death in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tanshinone against Prostate Cancer.', 'An overview of the anti-cancer actions of Tanshinones, derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen).', 'The Anticancer Properties of Tanshinones and the Pharmacological Effects of Their Active Ingredients.', 'Baicalein suppresses the androgen receptor (AR)-mediated prostate cancer progression via inhibiting the AR N-C dimerization and AR-coactivators interaction.', 'Crosstalk between Beclin-1-dependent autophagy and caspase‑dependent apoptosis induced by tanshinone\xa0IIA in human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells.']"""

Methods:   Akt-2 expression was analyzed by western-blotting and Q-PCR in cell lines. We also analyzed the Akt-2 protein expression in a tissue microarray from 64 prostate cancer patients. Akt-2 promoter activity was assessed and analyzed by luciferase assay.  Results:   A concomitant over-expression of Her-2 and Akt2 expression was observed by western-blotting and quantitative-PCR in prostate cancer cell lines. A significant correlation between Her-2 and Akt2 protein expression was also observed by immunohistochemistry assay on prostate cancer tissues. In LNCaP cells, over-expression of Akt2 protein and mRNA was decreased by Her-2 pharmacologic inhibitors as well as small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to Her-2. Cloning of the AKT2 promoter in a luciferase reporter plasmid further showed that Akt2 over-expression in cell lines is associated with increased AKT2 promoter activity suggesting that Her-2 modulates a signaling pathway involving AKT2 gene regulation.

Methods:   Twenty DBC-resistant CRPC patients and 22 patients with no prior DBC, as a control, were treated with PPV using peptides chosen from 31 peptides in patients, respectively.

Methods:   In this study we tested if prostate cancer cells are heterogeneous with regard to their intrinsic 26S proteasome activity, which could explain the lack of clinical responses to bortezomib. PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells and an imaging system for proteasome activity were used to identify individual cells with low proteasome activity. Clonogenic survival assays, a sphere-forming assay and an in vivo limiting dilution assay were used to characterize radiation sensitivity, self-renewal capacity, and tumorigenicity of the different subsets of cells.  Results:   We identified a small population of cells with intrinsically low 26S proteasome activity. Fractionated radiation enriched for these cells and clonogenic survival assays and sphere-forming assays revealed a radioresistant phenotype and increased self-renewal capacity.

However, a causal relationship between XMRV and prostate cancer remains controversial due to conflicting reports on its etiologic occurrence. Even though gammaretroviruses are known to induce cancer in animals, a mechanism for XMRV-induced carcinogenesis remains unknown. Several mechanisms including insertional mutagenesis, proinflammatory effects, oncogenic viral proteins, immune suppression, and altered epithelial/stromal interactions have been proposed for a role of XMRV in prostate cancer. However, biochemical data supporting any of these mechanisms are lacking. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate a potential role of XMRV in prostate carcinogenesis.  Methods:   Growth kinetics of prostate cancer cells are conducted by MTT assay. In vitro transformation and invasion was carried out by soft agar colony formation, and Matrigel cell invasion assay, respectively. p27(Kip1) expression was determined by Western blot and MMP activation was evaluated by gelatin-zymography. Up-regulation of miR221 and miR222 expression was examined by real-time PCR.  Results:   We demonstrate that XMRV infection can accelerate cellular proliferation, enhance transformation, and increase invasiveness of slow growing prostate cancer cells. The molecular basis of these viral induced activities is mediated by the downregulation of cyclin/cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) . Downstream analyses illustrated that XMRV infection upregulates miR221 and miR222 expression that target p27(Kip1) mRNA.  Conclusions:   We propose that downregulation of p27(Kip1) by XMRV infection facilitates transition of G1 to S, thereby accelerates growth of prostate cancer cells.

A model was tested in which CBSM-related improvements in emotional well-being were attained through changes in men's perceptions of their condition, as conceptualized by information processing explanations of self-regulation theory. The model also tested whether life stress and treatment-related side effects moderated intervention effects.  Methods:   Men treated for localized prostate cancer (n = 257) within the past 18 months were randomized to CBSM or a half-day psycho-educational seminar. At pre-intervention and 12-week follow-up, emotional well-being, illness perceptions, life stress, and sexual and urinary function were assessed using validated questionnaires.  Results:   After controlling for covariates, CBSM participants showed greater improvements in emotional well-being relative to control participants (β = 0.13, p < 0.05). For men reporting higher stress upon study entry, CBSM-related improvements were partially explained by changes in some, but not all, illness perceptions.

Methods:   Seventy-eight consecutive patients with biochemical progression of PCa (mean prostate-specific antigen 21.1 ng/ml, range 0.2-500.0 ng/ml) referred for both [(11)C]choline PET/CT and BS for restaging purposes were retrospectively analysed. The diagnostic accuracy of [(11)C]choline PET/CT and BS was assessed by using morphological imaging and/or follow-up as standards of reference. As equivocal findings were found, the accuracy analysis was performed twice, once including them as positive and once as negative. A separate analysis was also performed in hormone-resistant patients and data compared with those of patients who did not receive anti-androgenic treatment.  Results:   Equivocal findings occurred in 1 of 78 (1%) cases in [(11)C]choline PET/CT and in 21 of 78 (27%) cases in BS. Depending on their attribution as either positive or negative, the ranges of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for [(11)C]choline PET/CT were 89-89%, 98-100%, 96-100%, 94-96% and 95-96%, respectively. For BS they were 100-70%, 75-100%, 68--100%, 100-86% and 83-90%, respectively. Concordant findings between [(11)C]choline PET/CT and BS occurred in 55 of 78 (71%) cases. The accuracy of [(11)C]choline PET/CT did not significantly (p = 0.30) differ between hormone-resistant patients (97%) and those who did not receive anti-androgenic treatment (95%).

A comparative study included patients who received uninterrupted finasteride (mMAB) treatment and those who did not MAB.  Methods:   A randomized group of 63 patients with PCa (T3NxM1; Gl. 6-7) was prospectively examined for 5 years: group A (GrA)-31 patients receiving MAB and group B (GrB)-32-mMAB. Testosterone inactivating pharmaceuticals period (TIP) lasted until PSA was 0.2 ng/ml (group A) and 0.1 ng/ml (group B), followed by MAB (TOP) discontinuation.

We have previously established that the pro-apoptotic cytokine melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/Interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24) is a crucial mediator of NSAID-induced apoptosis in prostate, breast, renal and stomach cancer cells. In this report we evaluated various structurally different NSAIDs for their efficacies to induce apoptosis and mda-7/IL-24 expression in ovarian cancer cells. While several NSAIDs induced apoptosis, Sulindac Sulfide and Diclofenac most potently induced apoptosis and reduced tumor growth. A combination of these agents results in a synergistic effect. Furthermore, mda-7/IL-24 induction by NSAIDs is essential for programmed cell death, since inhibition of mda-7/IL-24 by small interfering RNA abrogates apoptosis. mda-7/IL-24 activation leads to upregulation of growth arrest and DNA damage inducible (GADD) 45 α and γ and JNK activation. The NF-κB family of transcription factors has been implicated in ovarian cancer development. We previously established NF-κB/IκB signaling as an essential step for cell survival in cancer cells and hypothesized that targeting NF-κB could potentiate NSAID-mediated apoptosis induction in ovarian cancer cells. Indeed, combining NSAID treatment with NF-κB inhibitors led to enhanced apoptosis induction.

GLIPR1 is currently being investigated as a candidate for prostate cancer gene therapy and for glioblastoma targeted therapy. Crystal structures of a truncated soluble domain of the human GLIPR1 protein (sGLIPR1) solved by molecular replacement using a truncated polyalanine search model of the CAP domain of stecrisp, a snake-venom cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP), are presented. The correct molecular-replacement solution could only be obtained by removing all loops from the search model. The native structure was refined to 1.85 Å resolution and that of a Zn2+ complex was refined to 2.2 Å resolution. The latter structure revealed that the putative binding cavity coordinates Zn2+ similarly to snake-venom CRISPs, which are involved in Zn2+-dependent mechanisms of inflammatory modulation.

This is functionally relevant, as targeting Her2 activation to the murine prostate cooperates with Pten loss and drives CaP progression. Mechanistically, this is associated with activation of the MAPK pathway and abrogation of the Pten loss-induced cellular senescence program. Importantly, inhibition of MEK function strongly suppressed proliferation within these tumors by restoring the Pten loss-induced cellular senescence program.

Characterisation of human prostate epithelial progenitor differentiation in response to androgens""","""Introduction:   A stem cell model of prostate cancer tumourigenesis explains progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and offers novel perspectives in targeting this cancer in its more advanced forms. Androgen receptor (AR) regulated pathways are central mechanisms in progression to CRPC. However, AR was thought to be lacking in prostate stem cell enriched fractions. Potential low levels of AR expression in stem cell enriched cells were investigated and potential direct effects of androgen were examined.  Methods:   Human prostate stem cell enriched populations, based on high α(2)β(1) integrin expression (α(2)β(1)(hi)), were selected from primary human prostate tissue in men undergoing transurethral prostatectomy or cystoprostatectomy. Effects on differentiation were assayed with flow cytometry using differentiation-specific markers.  Results:   Low levels of AR were demonstrable in α(2)β(1)(hi) cells following inhibition of the proteasome using MG132. Furthermore, a direct effect of androgen was shown in stabilising/inducing AR expression. Androgen treatment of α(2)β(1)(hi) cells was associated with the induction of differentiation using a number of differentiation-specific markers (prostatic acid phosphatase, cytokeratin 18 and AR) with increases ranging from 49% to 67% (p<0.05). These effects were blocked with the AR-specific inhibitor bicalutamide (p<0.05). These data support a role of direct androgen activity on stem cell enriched cells in the prostate and the implications of these findings are discussed.""","""['R Heer']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Ann R Coll Surg Engl""","""['The role of androgen in determining differentiation and regulation of androgen receptor expression in the human prostatic epithelium transient amplifying population.', 'Androgen deprivation causes truncation of the C-terminal region of androgen receptor in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Human α(2)β(1)(HI) CD133(+VE) epithelial prostate stem cells express low levels of active androgen receptor.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'New strategies in metastatic prostate cancer: targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway.', 'Role of prostate cancer stem-like cells in the development of antiandrogen resistance.', 'The Efflux Transporter ABCG2 Maintains Prostate Stem Cells.', 'Prostate progenitor cells proliferate in response to castration.']"""

Additionally, they irradiated the detectors in-phantom with breast and prostate hypofractionated treatments.  Results:   The detectors showed no significant dose rate, treatment time, energy, or dose dependence. Furthermore, the detectors were found to perform within manufacturer tolerances for all hypofractionated treatments examined, accurately reporting the measured dose (average disagreement of - 0.65%).

The next version of the treatment control system (Integrity) supports continuously variable dose rate (CVDR) as well as BVDR. Using CVDR opposed to BVDR for VMAT has the potential of reducing the treatment time but may lead to lower dosimetric accuracy due to faster moving accelerator parts. Using D7 and a test version of Integrity, differences in ability to control the accelerator, treatment efficiency, and dosimetric accuracy between the two systems were investigated.  Methods:   Single parameter tests were designed to expose differences in the way the two systems control the movements of the accelerator. In these tests, either the jaws, multi leaf collimators (MLCs), or gantry moved at constant speed while the dose rate was changed in discrete steps. The positional errors of the moving component and dose rate were recorded using the control systems with a sampling frequency of 4 Hz. The clinical applicability of Integrity was tested using 15 clinically used VMAT plans (5 prostate, 5 H&N, and 5 lung) generated by the SmartArc algorithm in PINNACLE. The treatment time was measured from beam-on to beam-off and the accuracy of the dose delivery was assessed by comparing DELTA4 measurements and PINNACLE calculated doses using gamma evaluation.  Results:   The single parameter tests showed that Integrity had an improved feedback between gantry motion and dose rate at the slight expense of MLC control compared to D7. The single parameter test did not reveal any significant differences in the control of either jaws or backup jaws between the two systems. These differences in gantry and MLC control together with the use of CVDR gives a smoother Integrity VMAT delivery compared to D7 with less abrupt changes in accelerator motion. Gamma evaluation (2% of 2 Gy and 2 mm) of the calculated doses and DELTA4 measured doses corrected for systematic errors showed an average pass rate of more than 97.8% for both D7, Integrity BVDR, and Integrity CVDR deliveries. Direct comparisons between the measured doses using strict gamma criteria of 0.5% and 0.5 mm showed excellent agreement between D7 and Integrity delivered doses with average pass rates above 95.7%. Finally, the Integrity control system resulted in a significant 35% (55 +/- 13 s) reduction in treatment time, on average.  Conclusions:   Single parameter tests showed that the two control systems differed in their feedbac loops between MLC, gantry, and dose rate. These differences made the VMAT deliveries more smooth using the new Integrity treatment control system, compared to the current Desktop 7.01. Together with the use of CVDR, which results in less abrupt changes in dose rate, this further increases the smoothness of the delivery. The use of CVDR for VMAT with the Integrity desktop results in a significant reduction in treatment time compared to BVDR with an average reduction of 35%. This decrease in delivery time was achieved without compromising the dosimetric accuracy.""","""['Anders Bertelsen', 'Ebbe L Lorenzen', 'Carsten Brink']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['The impact of continuously-variable dose rate VMAT on beam stability, MLC positioning, and overall plan dosimetry.', 'Analysis of direct clinical consequences of MLC positional errors in volumetric-modulated arc therapy using 3D dosimetry system.', 'Evaluation of MLC leaf positioning accuracy for static and dynamic IMRT treatments using DAVID in vivo dosimetric system.', 'Evaluation of fluence-based dose delivery incorporating the spatial variation of dosimetric leaf gap (DLG).', 'Utility of VMAT: Aspect of Clinical Application.', 'Dosimetric Comparison between Single and Dual Arc-Volumetric Modulated Arc Radiotherapy and Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Using a Simultaneous Integrated Boost Technique.', 'Delivery efficiency of an Elekta linac under gated operation.', 'Single arc volumetric-modulated arc therapy is sufficient for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a dosimetric comparison with dual arc VMAT and dynamic MLC and step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Dose verification of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) by use of in-treatment linac parameters.', 'Beam modeling and VMAT performance with the Agility 160-leaf multileaf collimator.']"""

Methods:   A dosimetric study involving 28 patients was undertaken where measured doses received during treatment were compared to those calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). After the ultrasound imaging required for treatment planning had been recorded, the ultrasound probe was replaced with a geometric replica that contained an 8 mm diameter cylindrical cavity in which a PTW diode array type 9112 was placed. The replica probe was then positioned inside the rectum with the individual diode positions determined using fluoroscopy. Dose was then recorded during the patients' treatment and compared to associated coordinates in the planning system.  Results:   Factors influencing diode response and experimental uncertainty were initially investigated to estimate the overall uncertainty involved in dose measurements, which was determined to be +/- 10%. Data was acquired for 28 patients' first fractions, 11 patients' second fractions, and 13 patients' third fractions with collection dependent upon circumstances. Deviations between the diode measurements and predicted values ranged from -42% to +35% with 71% of measurements experiencing less than a 10% deviation from the predicted values. If the +/- 10% measurement uncertainty was combined with a tolerated dose discrepancy of +/- 10% then over 95% of the diode results exhibited agreement with the calculated data to within +/- 20%. It must also be noted that when large dose discrepancies were apparent they did not necessarily occur for all five diodes in the one measurement.  Conclusions:   This technique provided a method that could be utilized to detect gross errors in dose delivery of a real-time prostate HDR plan.

During insertion, the needle deflects en route resulting in target misplacement. In this paper, 18-gauge needle insertion experiments into phantom were performed to test effects of three parameters, which include the clearance between the grid hole and needle, the thickness of the grid, and the needle insertion speed. Measurement apparatus that consisted of two datum surfaces and digital depth gauge was developed to quantify needle deflections.  Methods:   The gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R) test was performed on the measurement apparatus, and it proved to be capable of measuring a 2 mm tolerance from the target. Replicated experiments were performed on a 2(3) factorial design (three parameters at two levels) and analysis included averages and standard deviation along with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find significant single and two-way interaction factors.  Results:   Results showed that grid with tight clearance hole and slow needle speed increased precision and accuracy of needle insertion. The tight grid was vital to enhance precision and accuracy of needle insertion for both slow and fast insertion speed; additionally, at slow speed the tight, thick grid improved needle precision and accuracy.  Conclusions:   In summary, the tight grid is important, regardless of speed. The grid design, which shows the capability to reduce the needle deflection in brachytherapy procedures, can potentially be implemented in the brachytherapy procedure.""","""['Carl S McGill', 'Jonathon A Schwartz', 'Jason Z Moore', 'Patrick W McLaughlin', 'Albert J Shih']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Needle deflection estimation: prostate brachytherapy phantom experiments.', 'Effects of insertion speed and trocar stiffness on the accuracy of needle position for brachytherapy.', 'Brachytherapy needle deflection evaluation and correction.', 'Estimating needle tip deflection in biological tissue from a single transverse ultrasound image: application to brachytherapy.', 'Measurement of prostate rotation during insertion of needles for brachytherapy.', 'Percutaneous MR-guided whole-gland prostate cancer cryoablation: safety considerations and oncologic results in 30 consecutive patients.', 'Surface markers for guiding cylindrical diffuser fiber insertion in interstitial photodynamic therapy of head and neck cancer.', 'Accuracy evaluation of a 3D-printed individual template for needle guidance in head and neck brachytherapy.', 'Needle deflection estimation: prostate brachytherapy phantom experiments.']"""

Methods:   Simulation and daily in-room CT scans from ten prostate carcinoma patients were analyzed. PT treatment plans (78 Gy in 39 fractions of 2 Gy) were created on the simulation CT, delivering 25 fractions to PTV1 (expanded from prostate and seminal vesicles), followed by 14 boost fractions to PTV2 (expanded from prostate). Plans were subsequently applied to daily CT, with beams aligned to the prostate center in the sagittal plane. For five patients having a sufficiently large daily imaging volume, structure contours were manually drawn, and plans were evaluated for all CT sets. For the other five patients, the plans were evaluated for six selected fractions. The daily CT was matched to the simulation CT through deformable registration. The registration accuracy was validated for each fraction, and the three patients with a large number of accurately registered fractions were used for dose accumulation.  Results:   In individual fractions, the coverage of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and PTV1 was generally maintained at the corresponding prescription dose. For PTV2, the volume covered by the fractional prescription dose of 2 Gy (i.e., V2) was, on average, reduced by less than 3% compared to the simulation plan. Among the 225 (39 x 5 + 6 x 5) fractions examined, 15 showed a V2 reduction larger than 5%, of which ten were caused by a large variation in rectal gas, and five were due to a prostate shift in the craniocaudal direction. The fractional dose to the anterior rectal wall was found to increase for one patient who had large rectal gas volume in 25 of the 39 fractions, and another who experienced significant prostate volume reduction during the treatment. The fractional bladder dose generally increased with decreasing fullness. In the total accumulated dose for the three patients after excluding a few fractions with inaccurate registration due to a large amount of rectal gas (a condition inconsistent with RTOG protocol), 98.5%, 96.6%, and 98.2% of the PTV2 received the prescription dose of 78 Gy. The V75 and V70 of the anterior rectal wall and bladder both remained within tolerance.  Conclusions:   The results confirm that the PT planning techniques and dose constraints used at our institution ensure that target coverage to the prescription dose is maintained in the presence of interfractional anatomical variations. Dose coverage in individual fractions can be compromised, and normal tissue dose increased, due to deviations in the bladder and rectal volume compared to the simulation plans or progressive changes in the prostate volume during the treatment. Deviations from the plan can be reduced with efforts aimed at maintaining consistent daily patient anatomy.""","""['Yi Wang', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Gregory C Sharp', 'Hsiao-Ming Lu', 'I Frank Ciernik', 'Alexei V Trofimov']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Adaptive proton therapy.', 'Probabilistic dose distribution from interfractional motion in carbon ion radiation therapy for prostate cancer shows rectum sparing with moderate target coverage degradation.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Hypofractionated proton therapy for prostate cancer: dose delivery uncertainty due to interfractional motion.', 'Seminal vesicle inter- and intra-fraction motion during radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A review.', 'Optimizing 3DCT image registration for interfractional changes in carbon-ion prostate radiotherapy.', 'Proton Beam Therapy for Esophageal Cancer.', 'Dosimetric advantages of daily adaptive strategy in IMPT for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Adaptive proton therapy.', 'Interfractional robustness of scanning carbon ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer: An analysis based on dose distribution from daily in-room CT images.']"""

Since then, however, despite the substantial progression that has been made in investigation of the biologic roles played by this gene, the manner in which it exerts its regulatory influence is still unknown. With transfection of various deletion or mutation constructs, we identified a potential enhancer and three potential silencers in the 5'-flanking region. However, it was particularly interesting to find that a region (+59 to +123 bp) of exon 1 exhibited a strong role in initiation of tmsg-1 gene transcription. Deletion of this region led to essentially complete loss of driving activity of exon-1 sequence on luciferase. Further analysis showed that transcription factors KLF6 and Sp1 are able to interact with each other and bind to their elements in this region. Co-transfection of pGL3-114/+123 with KLF6- and/or Sp1-expressing plasmids resulted in an elevation of luciferase activity and transcription level of tmsg-1, which was abolished by knockdown of KLF6 or Sp1. Analysis of metastatic capacity showed that cells with high metastatic capability exhibited a lower level of KLF6/TMSG-1 proteins with higher invasive capability and vice versa. Thus, we concluded that interaction of KLF6 and Sp1, together with their binding of elements in exon 1 are critical events in initiation of transcription of the tmsg-1 gene. These results reveal a hitherto unreported mechanism for initiation of transcription of the tmsg-1 gene.""","""['Miaozi Gong', 'Wenjuan Yu', 'Fei Pei', 'Jiangfeng You', 'Xianglin Cui', 'Michael A McNutt', 'Gang Li', 'Jie Zheng']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Transcriptional activation of TMSG-1 by complex of KLF6 and Sp1.', 'Overexpression of human tumor metastasis-related gene TMSG-1 suppresses cell proliferation and invasion of a highly metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC-3M-1E8 in vitro.', 'Regulation of KLF5 involves the Sp1 transcription factor in human epithelial cells.', 'Biology of Krüppel-like factor 6 transcriptional regulator in cell life and death.', 'The role of KLF6 and its splice variants in cancer therapy.', 'Alternative splicing of ceramide synthase 2 alters levels of specific ceramides and modulates cancer cell proliferation and migration in Luminal B breast cancer subtype.', 'Clinical and pathological significance of Homo sapiens ceramide synthase 2 (CerS-2) in diverse human cancers.', 'Role of ceramide synthase 2 in G-CSF signaling and G-CSF-R translocation into detergent-resistant membranes.', 'Prognostic cancer gene signatures share common regulatory motifs.', 'Minnelide Inhibits Androgen Dependent, Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Growth by Decreasing Expression of Androgen Receptor Full Length and Splice Variants.']"""

The project network is composed of 9 research units (RUs) and has been active since 2005. The aim of the FIRB project was the design, production and validation of optoelectronic and chemoelectronic biosensors for the simultaneous detection of a novel class of cancer biomarkers associated with immunoglobulins of the M class (IgM) for early diagnosis of cancer. Biomarker immune complexes (BM-ICs) were assessed on samples of clinical cases and matched controls for breast, colorectal, liver, ovarian and prostate malignancies. This article describes in detail the architecture of the project website, the central database application, and the biobank developed for the FIRB Nanosized Cancer Polymarker Biochip Project. The article also illustrates many unique aspects that should be considered when developing a database within a multidisciplinary scenario. The main deliverables of the project were numerous, including the development of an online database which archived 1400 case report forms (700 cases and 700 matched controls) and more than 2700 experimental results relative to the BM-ICs assayed. The database also allowed for the traceability and retrieval of 21,000 aliquots archived in the centralized bank and stored as backup in the RUs, and for the development of a centralized biological bank in the coordinating unit with 6300 aliquots of serum. The constitution of the website and biobank database enabled optimal coordination of the RUs involved, highlighting the importance of sharing samples and scientific data in a multicenter setting for the achievement of the project goals.""","""['Antonette E Leon', 'Aline S C Fabricio', 'Fabio Benvegnù', 'Silvia Michilin', 'Annamaria Secco', 'Omar Spangaro', 'Sabrina Meo', 'Massimo Gion']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Biol Markers""","""['The project data sphere initiative: accelerating cancer research by sharing data.', 'Establishment of a network-based intra-hospital virtual cancer biobank.', 'CT colonography: Project of High National Interest No. 2005062137 of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR).', 'Research on cancer diagnosis in Malaysia: current status.', 'Establishing and managing a periodontal biobank for research: the sharing of experience.', 'Pathway-based expression profiling of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer delineates an immunophilin molecule associated with cancer progression.']"""

Patients and methods:   We included epidemiological and oncological data as well as standardized questionnaires on incontinence and sexual function. Data were analyzed using standard descriptive and explorative statistics.  Results:   We obtained pre-therapeutic data as well as a complete data set after 36 months for 488 patients. A total of 162 patients (33.2%) in whom we could not exclude a tumor relapse according to the guidelines of the EAU or because of incomplete data were excluded from further analysis. In a univariate analysis as expected stress incontinence, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), overactive bladder (OAB), urgency, pad use, sexual activity as well as perceived pre-therapeutic HRQoL, being privately insured, and a better school education were significantly associated with post-therapeutic long-term HRQoL (p<0.05). In a multivariate analysis of covariance only dry OAB (p=0.0411) and sexual activity (p=0.0046) proved to be independent parameters with a significant impact on HRQoL after 36 months.

Earlier diagnosis and prognosis marker of pancreatic cancer is not yet available. In colorectal cancer, protein biosynthesis enzyme, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS), is up-regulated in good-prognosis tumors and down-regulated in metastatic poor-prognosis tumors. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase status in pancreatic cancer is unknown. To correlate metastatic ability with hypoxia and TrpRS as a possible prognostic marker, we examined mRNA and protein expression in 2 human pancreatic cancer cell lines with different metastatic abilities and TrpRS levels using our site-specific monoclonal antibodies directed to conformation-dependent epitopes on pancreatic TrpRS.  Methods:   Pancreatic MIAPaCa-2, Panc-1, cervical HeLa, and prostate cancer PC-3 cells were cultivated under normoxia or in hypoxic chamber. Expression of full-length TrpRS, antiangiogenic TrpRS, cyclin B1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, and Glut-1 was determined with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemistry.  Results:   We demonstrate that hypoxia regulates differentially TrpRS splice forms. Pronounced down-regulation of full-length TrpRS by hypoxia is concomitant with higher metastatic ability.  Conclusions:   Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase down-regulation by hypoxia may be a factor responsible for low TrpRS in tumors with high metastatic ability.

Proinflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is secreted by many cell types and plays important roles in the process of angiogenesis via activation of cognate EP1-4 receptors. Here, we provide evidence that PGE2 promotes the in vitro tube formation of human microvascular endothelial cells, ex vivo vessel outgrowth of aortic rings, and actual in vivo angiogenesis. Use of EP subtype-selective agonists and antagonists suggested EP4 mediates the prostaglandin-induced tube formation, and this conclusion was substantiated with small interfering RNA to specifically knockdown the EP4 expression. EP4 couples to Gαs, leading to activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Inhibition of PKA activity or knockdown of PKA catalytic subunit γ with RNAi attenuates the PGE2-induced tube formation. Further, knocking down the expression of Rap1A, HSPB6, or endothelial NO synthase, which serve as PKA-activatable substrates, inhibits the tube formation, whereas knockdown of RhoA or glycogen synthase kinase 3β that are inactivated after phosphorylation by PKA increases the tube formation. These results support the existence of EP4-to-PKA angiogenic signal and provide rationale for use of selective EP4 signal inhibitors as a probable strategy to control pathologic angiogenesis.""","""['Yushan Zhang', 'Yehia Daaka']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Blood""","""['CP-25 inhibits PGE2-induced angiogenesis by down-regulating EP4/AC/cAMP/PKA-mediated GRK2 translocation.', 'The EP1/EP3 receptor agonist 17-pt-PGE2 acts as an EP4 receptor agonist on endothelial barrier function and in a model of LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation.', 'Prostaglandin E2 promotes endothelial differentiation from bone marrow-derived cells through AMPK activation.', 'Role of prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 in cardiovascular diseases.', 'EP4 as a Therapeutic Target for Aggressive Human Breast Cancer.', 'Role of functional fatty acids in modulation of reproductive potential in livestock.', 'Targeting cancer-related inflammation with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Perspectives in pharmacogenomics.', 'Human Adipose Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells Improve Fat Transplantation Performance.', 'The Prostaglandin E2 Receptor EP4 Promotes Vascular Neointimal Hyperplasia through Translational Control of Tenascin C via the cAPM/PKA/mTORC1/rpS6 Pathway.', 'The microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1/prostaglandin E2 axis induces recovery from ischaemia via recruitment of regulatory T cells.']"""

Here, we describe a robust alternative method that monitors proliferating cell thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) activity via LC-MS/MS quantification of 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FLT) and its monophosphate metabolite FLT-MP. LNCaP prostate cancer cells were cultured at four densities (20,000; 10,000; 5000; and 500 cells/well) and incubated with 2000 ng/mL FLT in multi-well plates. Internal standards were FLT-d3 for FLT and d4-thymidine for FLT-MP. In culture medium, peak area ratios of FLT to FLT-d3 and FLT-MP to d4-thymidine were linear over the range 0.25-100 ng/mL (r(2)≥0.998). Accuracy for quality controls was between -7.3% and 6.3% for FLT, and from -3.3% to 1.7% for FLT-MP. Quality control precision was from 2.4% to 5.7% for FLT and 3.2% to 7.5% for FLT-MP. The limit of quantification was 0.25 ng/mL, with good control results (precision of 9.6% for FLT and 14.8% for FLT-MP). FLT-MP formation was linearly proportional to cell number from 500 to 20,000 cells/well 1 h after FLT addition. FLT-MP and ATP generation were comparable in LNCaP cells exposed to cell cycle inhibitor drugs (Spearman r=0.925, p<0.0001), demonstrating assay suitability for drug screening.

Fourteen patients were included in the analysis. The planning target volume (PTV), which contained the prostate gland and proximal seminal vesicles, received 76 Gy in 38 fractions. Seven-field IMRT, SA, and DA plans were generated for each patient. Dosimetric quality in terms of the minimum PTV dose, PTV hotspot, inhomogeneity, and conformity index; and sparing of rectum, bladder, and femoral heads as measured by V70, V-40, and V20 (% of volume receiving >70 Gy, 40 Gy, and 20 Gy, respectively), treatment efficiency as assessed by monitor units (MU) and treatment time were compared. All plan objectives were met satisfactorily by all techniques. DA achieved the best dosimetric quality with the highest minimum PTV dose, lowest hotspot, and the best homogeneity and conformity. It was also more efficient than IMRT. SA achieved the highest treatment efficiency with the lowest MU and shortest treatment time. The mean treatment time for a 2-Gy fraction was 4.80 min, 2.78 min, and 1.30 min for IMRT, DA, and SA, respectively. However, SA also resulted in the highest rectal dose. DA could improve target volume coverage and reduce treatment time and MU while maintaining equivalent normal tissue sparing when compared with IMRT. SA achieved the greatest treatment efficiency but with the highest rectal dose, which was nonetheless within tolerable limits.

In practise, expected survival is usually calculated from general population life tables. Such estimates are known to be biased since they also include mortality from the cancer patients, but the bias is ignored since mortality among individuals with a specific cancer is thought to constitute only a small proportion of total mortality. Using the computerised population registers that exist in Sweden we had the unique opportunity to calculate expected survival both including and excluding individuals with cancer, and thereby estimate the size of the bias arising from using general population estimates. We also evaluated a simple method to adjust expected survival probabilities estimated from general population statistics as an aid to researchers who do not have access to computerised registers of the entire national population. Our results show that the bias is sufficiently small to be ignorable for most applications, notably for cancers with high or low mortality and for younger age groups (<60 years). However, the bias in relative survival estimates can be greater than 1 percent unit for older age groups for common cancers and even larger for all sites combined. For example, the bias in 10-year relative survival for men aged 75+ diagnosed with prostate cancer was 2.6 percent units, which we think is of sufficient magnitude to warrant adjustment.""","""['Mats Talbäck', 'Paul W Dickman']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Trends in the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer in the Nordic countries 1964-2003 followed up to the end of 2006.

Materials and methods:   The PRVs are generated from a coverage probability (CP) matrix of the small bowel wall (SBW) by thresholding. To estimate the CPs, we extend a previously published 'relative frequency of coverage' approach by adding a 'soft margin' around each SBW instance. This prevents the CP matrix from containing any holes, thus making it more robust. As the number of CTs approach infinity, the 'soft margin' approaches zero and the CP matrix converges to the 'relative frequency of coverage'. The PRVs were evaluated by using the bootstrap method in three patients with different degrees of SB motion: The PRVs from randomly sampled subsets of CTs were compared to the PRVs generated from all 10-11 CT scans, by analysis of sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, the PRVs generated for CP=0.005 (i.e. generous patient-specific PRVs) and for CP=0.03 (i.e. tight patient-specific PRVs) were compared to an intestinal cavity (IC) approach and a population based PRV approach of 10 and 30 mm isotropic planning margins around SB.  Results:   The sensitivity and specificity of the PRVs depend on the number of CT scans and the CP threshold. With three CT scans and a threshold of 0.03, an average sensitivity of 94-96% and specificity of 86-97% was obtained. All investigated SB planning volumes had an average overlap >89% of both SB and SBW. The tight patient-specific PRVs and the 10mm margins had the lowest relative volumes, followed by the generous patient-specific PRVs, the 30 mm margins and the ICs.  Conclusions:   Based on a few CTs, our method generates patient-specific SB PRVs which are both sensitive and specific. Compared to conventional approaches, the patient-specific PRVs are either similar or better in predicting for SB voxels, and at the same time they occupy a smaller or similar volume in the patient.""","""['Liv Bolstad Hysing', 'Matthias Söhn', 'Ludvig P Muren', 'Markus Alber']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Planning organ at risk volume margins for organ motion of the intestine.', 'Preoperative radiation treatment for rectal cancer: comparison of target coverage and small bowel NTCP in conventional vs. 3D-conformal planning.', 'The use of spatial dose gradients and probability density function to evaluate the effect of internal organ motion for prostate IMRT treatment planning.', 'Strategies to reduce the systematic error due to tumor and rectum motion in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', ""Testing the new ICRU 62 'Planning Organ at Risk Volume' concept for the rectum."", 'A Contouring Strategy and Reference Atlases for the Full Abdominopelvic Bowel Bag on Treatment Planning and Cone Beam Computed Tomography Images.']"""

In the present report, we investigated the effects of β-caryophyllene oxide (CPO), a sesquiterpene isolated from essential oils of medicinal plants such as guava (Psidium guajava), oregano (Origanum vulgare L.), cinnamon (Cinnamomum spp.) clove (Eugenia caryophyllata), and black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and MAPK activation pathways in human prostate and breast cancer cells. We found that CPO not only inhibited the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 signaling cascade; but also caused the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in tumor cells. CPO induced increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from mitochondria, which is associated with the induction of apoptosis as characterized by positive Annexin V binding and TUNEL staining, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. Inhibition of ROS generation by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly prevented CPO-induced apoptosis. Subsequently, CPO also down-regulated the expression of various downstream gene products that mediate cell proliferation (cyclin D1), survival (bcl-2, bcl-xL, survivin, IAP-1, and IAP-2), metastasis (COX-2), angiogenesis (VEGF), and increased the expression of p53 and p21. Interestingly, we also observed that CPO can significantly potentiate the apoptotic effects of various pharmacological PI3K/AKT inhibitors when employed in combination in tumor cells.

Gleason grade is a critical predictor of the aggressiveness of PCa. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies (TRUSBxs) show substantial undergrading of Gleason grades found after radical prostatectomy (RP). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be a biomarker of tumour aggressiveness.  Objective:   To improve pretreatment assessment of PCa aggressiveness, this study prospectively evaluated MRI-guided prostate biopsies (MR-GBs) of abnormalities determined on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The results were compared with a 10-core TRUSBx cohort. RP findings served as the gold standard.  Design, setting, and participants:   A 10-core TRUSBx (n=64) or MR-GB (n=34) was used for PCa diagnosis before RP in 98 patients.  Measurements:   Using multiparametric 3-T MRI: T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, and DWI were performed to identify tumour-suspicious regions in patients with a negative TRUSBx. The regions with the highest restriction on ADC maps within the suspicions regions were used to direct MR-GB. A 10-core TRUSBx was used in a matched cohort. Following RP, the highest Gleason grades (HGGs) in biopsies and RP specimens were identified. Biopsy and RP Gleason grade results were evaluated using chi-square analysis.  Results and limitations:   No significant differences on RP were observed for proportions of patients having a HGG of 3 (35% vs 28%; p=0.50), 4 (32% vs 41%; p=0.51), and 5 (32% vs 31%; p=0.61) for the MR-GB and TRUSBx cohort, respectively. MR-GB showed an exact performance with RP for overall HGG: 88% (30 of 34); for TRUS-GB it was 55% (35 of 64; p=0.001). In the MR-GB cohort, an exact performance with HGG 3 was 100% (12 of 12); for HGG 4, 91% (10 of 11); and for HGG 5, 73% (8 of 11). The corresponding performance rates for TRUSBx were 94% (17 of 18; p=0.41), 46% (12 of 26; p=0.02), and 30% (6 of 20; p=0.01), respectively.

Our purpose is to compare outcomes with a single fraction HDR boost to that with a standard fractionated boost in intermediate risk prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Results of two sequential phase II clinical trials are compared. The Single Fraction protocol consists of 15 Gy HDR in one fraction followed by 37.5 Gy EBRT in 15 fractions over 3 weeks; the Standard Fractionation protocol consisted of two HDR fractions each of 10 Gy, 1 week apart, followed by 45 Gy EBRT in 25 fractions. Patients had intermediate risk disease, and were well balanced for prognostic factors. Patients were followed prospectively for efficacy, toxicity and health-related quality of life (Expanded Prostate Index Composite). Efficacy was assessed biochemically using the Phoenix definition, and by biopsy at 2 years.  Results:   The Single Fraction protocol accrued 123 patients and the Standard Fractionation protocol, 60. With a median follow-up of 45 and 72 months, respectively, the biochemical disease-free survival was 95.1% and 97.9% in the Single and Standard Fractionation trials (p=0.3528). Two-year prostate biopsy was positive in only 4% and 8%, respectively. There was no difference in late urinary or rectal toxicity rates, or in health-related quality of life between the two protocols.  Conclusions:   The Single Fraction HDR protocol results in high disease control rate and low toxicity similar to our previous protocol using two HDR insertions, with significant savings in resources. While mature results with longer follow-up are awaited, a single 15 Gy may be considered as a standard fractionation regimen in combination with EBRT for men with intermediate risk disease.""","""['Gerard Morton', 'Andrew Loblaw', 'Patrick Cheung', 'Ewa Szumacher', 'Manraj Chahal', 'Cyril Danjoux', 'Hans T Chung', 'Andrea Deabreu', 'Alexandre Mamedov', 'Liying Zhang', 'Raxa Sankreacha', 'Eric Vigneault', 'Colvin Springer']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy and hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer: analysis of short- and medium-term toxicity and quality of life.', 'Long term results of a prospective dose escalation phase-II trial: interstitial pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy as boost for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Brachytherapy: current status and future strategies -- can high dose rate replace low dose rate and external beam radiotherapy?', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Implementation of High-Dose-Rate, CT-Based Prostate Brachytherapy in an Academic Teaching Hospital and Residency Training Program.', 'Low-/high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy: long-term results from a single institution team experience.', '169 Yb-based rotating shield brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'A comparison of outcomes for patients with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer treated with low dose rate and high dose rate brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiotherapy.', 'Transitioning From a Low-Dose-Rate to a High-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy Program: Comparing Initial Dosimetry and Improving Workflow Efficiency Through Targeted Interventions.']"""

Whereas curcumin has both a Michael acceptor and a Michael donor units, its analogues dibenzoylmethane (DBM, a component of licorice) and dibenzoylpropane (DBP) have a Michael donor but not a Michael acceptor unit, and the analogue dibenzylideneacetone (DBA) has a Michael acceptor unit. In the current report, we investigated the potency of DBM, DBP, and DBA in relation to curcumin for their ability to suppress TNF-induced NF-κB activation, NF-κB-regulated gene products, and cell proliferation. We found that all four agents were active in suppressing NF-κB activation; curcumin was most active and DBM was least active. When examined for its ability to inhibit the direct DNA binding activity of p65, a subunit of NF-κB, only DBP inhibited the binding. For inhibition of TNF-induced IKK activation, DBA was most active. For suppression of TNF-induced expression of NF-κB-regulated gene products such as COX-2 (inflammation marker), cyclin D1 (proliferation marker), and VEGF (angiogenesis marker), DBA and curcumin were more active than DBM. Similarly for suppression of proliferation of leukemia (KBM-5), T cell leukemia (Jurkat), prostate (DU145), and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells, curcumin and DBA were most active and DBP was least active.

Here, we identify EZH2 as a target of the MYC oncogene in prostate cancer and show that MYC coordinately regulates EZH2 through transcriptional and post-transcriptional means. Although prior studies in prostate cancer have revealed a number of possible mechanisms of EZH2 upregulation, these changes cannot account for the overexpression EZH2 in many primary prostate cancers, nor in most cases of high grade PIN. We report that upregulation of Myc in the mouse prostate results in overexpression of EZH2 mRNA and protein which coincides with reductions in miR-26a and miR-26b, known regulators of EZH2 in some non-prostate cell types, albeit not in others. Further, in human prostate cancer cells, Myc negatively regulates miR-26a and miR-26b via direct binding to their parental Pol II gene promoters, and forced overexpression of miR-26a and miR-26b in prostate cancer cells results in decreased EZH2 levels and suppressed proliferation. In human clinical samples, miR-26a and miR-26b are downregulated in most primary prostate cancers. As a separate mechanism of EZH2 mRNA upregulation, we find that Myc binds directly to and activates the transcription of the EZH2 promoter. These results link two major pathways in prostate cancer by providing two additional and complementary Myc-regulated mechanisms by which EZH2 upregulation occurs and is enforced during prostatic carcinogenesis. Further, the results implicate EZH2-driven mechanisms by which Myc may stimulate prostate tumor initiation and disease progression.""","""['Cheryl M Koh', 'Tsuyoshi Iwata', 'Qizhi Zheng', 'Carlise Bethel', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Angelo M De Marzo']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['MicroRNA-101 negatively regulates Ezh2 and its expression is modulated by androgen receptor and HIF-1alpha/HIF-1beta.', 'Polycomb protein EZH2 regulates tumor invasion via the transcriptional repression of the metastasis suppressor RKIP in breast and prostate cancer.', 'MiR-26a inhibits cell growth and tumorigenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma through repression of EZH2.', 'Mutations and deletions of PRC2 in prostate cancer.', 'Beyond Expression: Role of Phosphorylated Residues of EZH2 in Lineage Plasticity in Prostate Cancer.', 'Current research on viral proteins that interact with fibrillarin.', 'The RUNX Family Defines Trk Phenotype and Aggressiveness of Human Neuroblastoma through Regulation of p53 and MYCN.', 'Phenotypic Plasticity - Alternate Transcriptional Programs Driving Treatment Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A mitochondrial unfolded protein response inhibitor suppresses prostate cancer growth in mice via HSP60.', 'Polyploid giant cancer cells, EZH2 and Myc upregulation in mammary epithelial cells infected with high-risk human cytomegalovirus.']"""

In this report, we demonstrate an increase in hZip1 and hZip3 zinc transporters' expression and zinc uptake by the prostate cancer cells DU-145 and LNCaP in response to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. This effect is due to demethylation of the promoter region of the activator protein (AP)-2alpha protein, which is crucial for hZip1 and hZip3 genes expression. Loss of AP-2alpha expression in DU-145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells is due to hypermethylation of its promoter region. Similarly, we found higher AP-2alpha promoter methylation levels in clinical samples of early-stage prostate adenocarcinoma when compared with adjacent non-malignant prostate tissue.

The aim of this study was to validate the UCSF-CAPRA score for Japanese prostate cancer patients receiving radical prostatectomy using the contemporary Gleason grading.  Methods:   From 1999 to 2010, 211 men who underwent radical prostatectomy were used for validation.

After stratification according to the number of previous biopsies (first, second and ≥ third), calculation of specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) and the proportion of avoided unnecessary repeat biopsies (PAB) compared with tPSA at fixed sensitivity thresholds (75, 85 and 95%) were performed. Finally, accuracy estimates (area under the curve [AUC]) were quantified for each repeat biopsy scenario.  Results:   At repeat biopsy, overall prostate cancer (PCa) detection was 34.6%. At first repeat biopsy, PCA3 predicted PCa best (AUC = 0.80) and would have avoided 72.2% of repeat biopsies (75% sensitivity) compared with tPSA. At second repeat biopsy, %fPSA demonstrated the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.82) and would have avoided 66.7% of repeat biopsies (75% sensitivity) compared with tPSA. At ≥ third repeat biopsy, again %fPSA demonstrated the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.70) and would have avoided 45.0% of repeat biopsies (75% sensitivity) compared with tPSA. The main limitation of our study resides in its small sample size.  Conclusions:   The findings of the present study promote the concept that the number of previous repeat biopsy sessions strongly influences the performance characteristics of biopsy risk factors. Total PSA was no significant risk factor in the entire analysis. By contrast, %fPSA performed best at second and ≥ third repeat biopsy. PSAV's diagnostic potential was reserved to patients at second and ≥ third repeat biopsy. Finally, PCA3 demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy and potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies at first repeat biopsy. However, this advantage dissipated at second and ≥ third repeat biopsy.""","""['Marco Auprich', 'Herbert Augustin', 'Lars Budäus', 'Luis Kluth', 'Sebastian Mannweiler', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Margit Fisch', 'Markus Graefen', 'Karl Pummer', 'Felix K-H Chun']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate can improve the predictive value of the urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 test in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and a previous negative biopsy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Head-to-head comparison of prostate health index and urinary PCA3 for predicting cancer at initial or repeat biopsy.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

The present study was to perform contrast-tuned imaging (CnTI) technology to detect prostate cancer and compare the use of CnTI technology for the detection of prostate cancer with conventional ultrasonography. The preliminary data from our study suggested that targeted biopsy of the prostate with CnTI technology could improve the cancer detection and detect higher grade prostate cancers.  Objectives:   To perform contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) using contrast-tuned imaging (CnTI) technology to detect prostate cancer. To evaluate the detection of prostate cancer with CnTI compared with conventional grey-scale and power Doppler ultrasonography.  Patients and methods:   In all, 150 patients referred for prostate biopsy were evaluated using transrectal grey-scale, power Doppler and CnTI ultrasonography. Biopsy was performed at 10 sites in each patient. If an abnormality was found at any of these three ultrasonography examinations, a biopsy specimen was targeted towards from the corresponding site. The performances of the three ultrasonography techniques for prostate cancer detection were compared.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected at 383 sites from 73 patients. The combination of these three examinations detected more patients with prostate cancer than grey-scale (P= 0.002), power Doppler (P= 0.001) or baseline imaging (the combination of grey-scale and power Doppler; P= 0.031) alone. By biopsy site, CnTI had higher sensitivity and accuracy (73.1% and 83.7%) than grey-scale (50.9%; P < 0.001 and 78.8%; P < 0.001) or power Doppler (48.3%; P < 0.001 and 77.7%; P < 0.001), while the specificity was similar for grey-scale (88.4%), power Doppler (87.8%) and CnTI (87.3%; P > 0.05 in each case). CnTI had higher sensitivity (73.1% vs 62.9%; P < 0.001), specificity (87.3% vs 82.1%; P < 0.001) and accuracy (83.7% vs 77.2%; P < 0.001) than baseline imaging. The mean Gleason score of CnTI-positive cases was significantly higher than CnTI-negative cases (7.1 vs 6.3; P= 0.002).  Conclusions:   CEUS using CnTI technology enables a visualization of the microvasculature associated with prostate cancer. CnTI technology could be used to guide biopsy and improve the detection rate of prostate cancer. CnTI technology was able to detect higher grade prostate cancers.""","""['Shao Wei Xie', 'Hong Li Li', 'Jing Du', 'Jian Guo Xia', 'Yi Fen Guo', 'Mei Xin', 'Feng Hua Li']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Colour Doppler and microbubble contrast agent ultrasonography do not improve cancer detection rate in transrectal systematic prostate biopsy sampling.', 'Contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography for the detection of diffuse prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic performance of power doppler and ultrasound contrast agents in early imaging-based diagnosis of organ-confined prostate cancer: Is it possible to spare cores with contrast-guided biopsy?', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for diagnosis of prostate cancer and kidney lesions.', 'Value of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric ultrasound of prostate: role in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Application of Multiple Ultrasonic Techniques in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiparametric ultrasound and micro-ultrasound in prostate cancer: a comprehensive review.', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound evaluation of the prostate before transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy can improve diagnostic sensitivity: A STARD-compliant article.', 'Contrast-Enhanced Transrectal Ultrasound in Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   • Between 2002 and 2008, 715 men with prostate-specific antigen levels in the range 2.5-20 ng/mL or abnormal digital rectal examination underwent three-dimensional 26-core prostate biopsy (i.e. a combination of transrectal 12-core biopsy and transperineal 14-core biopsy) on initial examination. • Of the 257 patients diagnosed with cancer, 120 patients subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy. • Cancers were grouped into TR12-negative cancers (i.e. not detected through transrectal 12-core biopsy but detected through transperineal 14-core biopsy) and TR12-positive (i.e. detected through transrectal 12-core biopsy) cancers. • Clinicopathological characteristics of the TR12-negative and TR12-positive cancers were evaluated.  Results:   • TR12-negative cancers comprised 21% of the three-dimensional 26-core biopsy-detected cancers. • The frequency of cancers with a biopsy Gleason score ≤ 6 and that of cancers with a biopsy primary Gleason grade ≤ 3 was higher in TR12-negative cancers, at 58% and 83%, respectively, than in TR12-positive cancers, at 25% (P < 0.001) and 53% (P < 0.001), respectively. • The median number of positive cores in TR12-negative cancers was two out of 26. • TR12-negative cancers were more frequently located anteriorly than posteriorly. • The incidence of the TR12-negative cancers was not associated significantly with any clinical variable.

In prostate cancer (CaP), however, expression of Gluts has been characterized poorly. In this study, expression and distribution of Glut-1 and Glut-5 proteins were characterized using immunohistochemistry in 76 specimens of benign prostate, 10 specimens of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), and 28 specimens of CaP. In addition, mRNA expression of Glut-2, Glut-7, Glut-9, and Glut-11 was analyzed in a set of five specimens of benign prostate and CaP. In benign prostate, Glut-1 localized to the basal cells and to the basolateral membrane of secretory/luminal epithelial cells. Glut-5, however, localized to the apical membrane of secretory/luminal epithelial cells. In HGPIN, Glut-1 was immunohistochemically undetectable. Glut-5, however, localized to the apical membrane of the neoplastic epithelial cells. In CaP, Glut-1 and Glut-5, were immunohistochemically undetectable. However, over-expression of GLUT1 was observed in some specimens of highly proliferative intraductal CaP. Glut-7, Glut-9, and Glut-11 mRNAs were detected in benign prostate and CaP, however, only Glut-11 mRNA was consistently up-regulated in CaP compared to benign prostate. Low levels of expression of Glut-1 protein in the majority of CaP could explain, at least in part, the limited clinical applicability of positron emission tomography using 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose for imaging CaP. Moreover, expression of Glut-5 in HGPIN suggested that fructose could be utilized as potential metabolic substrate in HGPIN.

Chromatin remodeling-related epigenetic regulation has emerged as an important mechanism of carcinogenesis, chemoprevention, and chemotherapy. CUR has been found to inhibit histone acetyltransferase activity, and it was also postulated to be a potential DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. In this study, we show that when human prostate LNCaP cells were treated with CUR, it led to demethylation of the first 14 CpG sites of the CpG island of the Neurog1 gene and restored the expression of this cancer-related CpG-methylation epigenome marker gene. At the protein level, CUR treatment had limited effects on the expression of epigenetic modifying proteins MBD2, MeCP2, DNMT1, and DNMT3a. Using ChIP assay, CUR decreased MeCP2 binding to the promoter of Neurog1 dramatically. CUR treatment showed different effects on the protein expression of HDACs, increasing the expression of HDAC1, 4, 5, and 8 but decreasing HDAC3. However, the total HDAC activity was decreased upon CUR treatment. Further analysis of the tri-methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) showed that CUR decreased the enrichment of H3K27me3 at the Neurog1 promoter region as well as at the global level. Taken together, our present study provides evidence on the CpG demethylation ability of CUR on Neurog1 while activating its expression, suggesting a potential epigenetic modifying role for this phytochemical compound in human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Limin Shu', 'Tin Oo Khor', 'Jong-Hun Lee', 'Sarandeep S S Boyanapalli', 'Ying Huang', 'Tien-Yuan Wu', 'Constance L-L Saw', 'Ka-Lung Cheung', 'Ah-Ng Tony Kong']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""AAPS J""","""['Epigenetic DNA methylation of antioxidative stress regulator NRF2 in human prostate cancer.', 'Curcumin inhibits anchorage-independent growth of HT29 human colon cancer cells by targeting epigenetic restoration of the tumor suppressor gene DLEC1.', ""Demethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in colorectal cancer cells targets genomic DNA whilst promoter CpG island methylation persists."", 'Curcumin: An epigenetic regulator and its application in cancer.', 'Epigenetic impact of curcumin on stroke prevention.', 'Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Applications of Curcumin: Update.', 'Polyphenols as Potent Epigenetics Agents for Cancer.', 'Comprehensive overview of Nrf2-related epigenetic regulations involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury.', ""Curcumin prevents Alzheimer's disease progression by upregulating JMJD3."", 'Natural Bioactive Compounds Targeting Histone Deacetylases in Human Cancers: Recent Updates.']"""

This work describes a dose planning method that uses inverse planning to create a low-dose tunnel around the urethra and presents a class solution to achieve this additional dose sparing of the urethra.  Methods:   Fifteen patients on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0321 protocol were treated for prostate cancer with a high-dose-rate brachytherapy dose boost to an external beam radiation treatment regimen. All were treated with 9.5Gy for each of the two fractions after 45Gy of the external beam radiation. The inverse-planning algorithm, inverse planning simulated annealing (IPSA), was used to create both the standard RTOG protocol (SRP) plan for treatment and the a posteriori urethra dose sparing (UDS) plan consisting of a dose tunnel along the urethra. Both plans maintained the protocol parameters: prostate V(100) (volume receiving 100% of prescribed dose)>90% and bladder and rectum V(75)<1 cm(3). In the SRP plans, the urethra surface was optimized to receive <125% of the prescription dose and in the UDS plans <100%. Dose-volume histograms for the clinical treatment volume, bladder, rectum, penile bulb, and urethra for both plans are compared using a paired sample t test with significance claimed for probability values<0.05.  Results:   UDS planning reduced the urethra V(100) from 88% to 58% on average (p<0.01) and the V(125) from 3.3% to 0.2% (p < 0.01). Bladder and rectum V(75) were maintained at <1 cm(3) and not significantly different between plans. Prostate coverage was maintained per protocol at V(100)>90%, with mean for the SRP V(100)=93% versus UDS plan V(100)=90%. Prostate D(90) for SRP was 104% versus UDS plan D(90)=101%. For all patients, the UDS achieved a dose tunnel surrounding the length of the intraprostatic urethra. The class solution for generating UDS is presented.  Conclusions:   A urethral sparing-focused planning solution using IPSA reduces mean urethral dose by 34%, as compared with IPSA-generated plans based on the RTOG 0321 protocol. This is done while maintaining prostate coverage and critical structure dose. This technique can be applied to all patients in whom urethra toxicity is of particular concern.""","""['J Adam M Cunha', 'Jean Pouliot', 'Vivian Weinberg', 'Alice Wang-Chesebro', 'Mack Roach rd', 'I-Chow Hsu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['A comparison of anatomy-based inverse planning with simulated annealing and graphical optimization for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Comparison of inverse planning simulated annealing and geometrical optimization for prostate high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Anatomy-based inverse planning simulated annealing optimization in high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy: significant dosimetric advantage over other optimization techniques.', 'Three-dimensional conformal brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Simple diagrammatic method to delineate male urethra in prostate cancer radiotherapy: an MRI based approach.', 'Long-Term Results of NRG Oncology/RTOG 0321: A Phase II Trial of Combined High Dose Rate Brachytherapy and External Beam Radiation Therapy for Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Phase I study of dose escalation to dominant intraprostatic lesions using high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Template guided transperineal saturation biopsy of the prostate: lessons for focal and urethra-sparing high-dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of Oncentra® Brachy IPSA and graphical optimisation techniques: a case study of HDR brachytherapy head and neck and prostate plans.', 'Salvage brachytherapy in prostate local recurrence after radiation therapy: predicting factors for control and toxicity.']"""

However, patients with preexisting lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and PCa, who would otherwise be good brachytherapy candidates, are often contraindicated because of the risk of postoperative urinary morbidity. We report our clinical experience with limited transurethral resection of the prostate (LTURP) and/or transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) months before brachytherapy to treat patients with LUTS and low- to intermediate-risk PCa.  Methods and materials:   Of 258 men undergoing prostate brachytherapy at our institution between 1998 and 2011, 42 were treated with planned LTURP and/or TUIP well before (mean, 5.7 months) seed implantation. Transurethral surgery was considered before brachytherapy for patients who at presentation required α-blocker therapy for LUTS, had an International Prostate Symptom Score greater than 14 off α-blockers, or had an elevated postvoid residual (>100 mL). Patients only proceeded to brachytherapy once LUTS resolved.  Results:   All 42 patients in our series underwent TUIP (25), LTURP (7), or TUIP/LTURP (10) with mean 5.7 months before prostate brachytherapy for low- or intermediate-risk PCa. Mean International Prostate Symptom Score, peak flow rate, and postvoid residual significantly improved after transurethral surgery, and improvement persisted at the latest followup. No patient developed retention, urethral necrosis, or urinary incontinence after transurethral surgery or brachytherapy (median followup, 39 months and range, 1-121).

The mean age of the patients was 61 years, and the median Gleason score in the radical prostatectomy specimens was 7 (4 + 3). Prostate cancer was unifocal in 6 cases and multifocal in 13 cases, including 10 with 2 foci and 3 with 3 foci. In the primary prostate cancers, rearrangement of the ERG gene was observed in 13 cases and associated with deletion of the 5' ERG gene in 8 cases. In the metastases, the ERG rearrangement was present in 10 cases and associated with deletion of the 5' ERG gene in 6 cases. In unifocal prostate cancers, the status of the ERG rearrangement was concordant between the primary prostate cancer and metastasis in 5 of 6 cases. In multifocal prostate cancer, despite a significant interfocal discordance, the status of the ERG rearrangement was concordant between the index (largest) primary tumor focus and metastasis in all 13 cases.

This study was undertaken to investigate the frequency of Y chromosome losses and this chromosomal abnormality might play a potential role in prostate cancer.  Methods:   A preexisting prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA) containing samples of 3,261 patients treated by radical prostatectomy with clinical follow-up data was used in this study. TMA sections were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a dual labeling probe for the centromeres of the X and Y chromosome.  Results:   Unequivocal losses of the Y chromosome were seen in only 12 of 2,053 analyzable cases. No significant associations were found between Y loss and patient age, pT stage, and the risk of PSA recurrence. Interestingly, in our study the presence of Y losses was significantly associated with high Gleason grade (P = 0.0034).  Conclusions:   Loss of the Y chromosome is a rare event in prostate cancer. Y losses occur in much higher rates in most other cancer types.

It has been reported that PSA transactivates AR, but the mechanistic requirements of this response have not been investigated.  Methods:   We studied the localization of PSA, AR, and Src in intracellular compartments of synthetic androgen (R1881)-stimulated LNCaP and C4-2B PrCa cells, using immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation approaches. We also investigated the effect of downregulation of PSA on AR expression by immunoblotting and real-time PCR using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Src activity was analyzed by immunoblotting.  Results:   R1881 stimulation induced nuclear localization of both PSA and AR in LNCaP and C4-2B PrCa cells as well as increased phosphorylation of Src. Stable shRNA or transient siRNA knockdown of PSA resulted in reduced AR protein levels as well as AR mRNA levels in C4-2B cells. Similar to C4-2B cells, ablation of AR levels upon silencing of PSA was also confirmed in VCaP cells, another androgen-independent cell line. Silencing of PSA did not cause significant changes in Src activation; besides, Src regulation by integrins did not appear to affect AR transcriptional activity.  Conclusions:   PSA localizes to nuclei of androgen-stimulated PrCa cells, and controls AR mRNA and protein levels. This regulatory loop is specific for PSA, does not involve known AR activators such as Src and AKT, and may contribute to AR signaling under conditions of increasing PSA levels in patients.""","""['Parmita Saxena', 'Marco Trerotola', 'Tao Wang', 'Jing Li', 'Aejaz Sayeed', 'Jennifer Vanoudenhove', 'Dave S Adams', 'Thomas J Fitzgerald', 'Dario C Altieri', 'Lucia R Languino']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Androgen-induced PSA expression requires not only activation of AR but also endogenous IGF-I or IGF-I/PI3K/Akt signaling in human prostate cancer epithelial cells.', ""Down-regulation of androgen receptor by 3,3'-diindolylmethane contributes to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in both hormone-sensitive LNCaP and insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells."", 'The PPARγ ligand ciglitazone regulates androgen receptor activation differently in androgen-dependent versus androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells.', 'Dissociation between androgen responsiveness for malignant growth vs. expression of prostate specific differentiation markers PSA, hK2, and PSMA in human prostate cancer models.', 'A novel regulation of PSMA and PSA expression by Q640X AR in 22Rv1 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'SWATH-MS Based Proteomic Profiling of Prostate Cancer Cells Reveals Adaptive Molecular Mechanisms in Response to Anti-Androgen Therapy.', 'Comprehensive role of prostate-specific antigen identified with proteomic analysis in prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Extracellular Proteases in Tumor Progression and the Development of Innovative Metal Ion Chelators that Inhibit their Activity.', 'Understanding Failure and Improving Treatment Using HDAC Inhibitors for Prostate Cancer.']"""

It has been suggested that multiple cores per donor can increase the representativity of tissue microarray studies. To estimate the potential benefit of multiple cores, we analyzed Ki67 and p53 in triplet cores taken from three different areas of 3,261 prostate cancer tissue blocks. Both p53 and Ki67 labeling index were linked to advanced tumor stage (p<0.0001 each), Gleason score (p<0.0001), and early PSA recurrence (p<0.0001) independently of whether the 3 tissue spots were analyzed separately or combined for a consensus result. The rate of positive findings increased with the amount of analyzed tissue. The average Ki67 labeling index was higher in tumors with 3 interpretable spots (5.3±5.6) as compared to two (4.1±4.7) or one interpretable spot (4.1±4.2, p<0.0001). For p53, tumors with three interpretable spots were positive in 3.8% of cases, and tumors with 1 or 2 interpretable spots in 1.9% only (p=0.003).

We now show that HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 is toxic to almost all cancer cell lines and to some normal primary cells examined. In contrast, HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 in combination with supplemental L-citrulline is selectively cytotoxic to a fraction of human cancer cell lines in tissue culture, including some melanomas, mesotheliomas, acute myeloid leukemias, hepatocellular carcinomas, pancreas adenocarcinomas, prostate adenocarcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, osteosarcomas, and small cell lung carcinomas. Unfortunately, a subset of normal human tissues is also sensitive to HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 with L-citrulline supplementation, including umbilical endothelial cells, bronchial epithelium, neurons, and renal epithelial cells. We further show that cell sensitivity is predicted by the level of cellular argininosuccinate synthetase protein expression measured by immunoblots. By comparing a 3-day and 7-day exposure to HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 with supplemental L-citrulline, some tumor cells sensitive on short-term assay are resistant in the 7-day assay consistent with the induction of argininosuccinate synthetase expression.

The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic impact of immunohistochemical RBM3 expression in prostate cancer.  Findings:   Immunohistochemical RBM3 expression was examined in a tissue microarray with malignant and benign prostatic specimens from 88 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for localized disease. While rarely expressed in benign prostate gland epithelium, RBM3 was found to be up-regulated in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and present in various fractions and intensities in invasive prostate cancer. High nuclear RBM3 expression was significantly associated with a prolonged time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) (HR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.93, p = 0.024) and clinical progression (HR 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01-0.71, p = 0.021).

Common tumours, such as breast, multiple myeloma, and prostate tumours, frequently metastasize to the bone. To search for an inhibitor of cancer-induced bone loss, we investigated the effect of thiocolchicoside, a semi-synthetic colchicoside derived from the plant Gloriosa superba and clinically used as a muscle relaxant, on osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and tumour cells.  Experimental approach:   We used RAW 264.7 (murine macrophage) cells, a well-established system for osteoclastogenesis, and evaluated the effect of thiocolchicoside on RANKL-induced NF-κB signalling and osteoclastogenesis as well as on osteoclastogenesis induced by tumour cells.  Key results:   Thiocolchicoside suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL, and by breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway was responsible for this effect since the colchicoside inhibited RANKL-induced NF-κB activation, activation of IκB kinase (IKK) and suppressed inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα) phosphorylation and degradation, an inhibitor of NF-κB. Furthermore, an inhibitor of the IκBα kinase γ or NF-κB essential modulator, the regulatory component of the IKK complex, demonstrated that the NF-κB signalling pathway is mandatory for osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL.  Conclusions and implications:   Together, these data suggest that thiocolchicoside significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and tumour cells via the NF-κB signalling pathway. Thus, thiocolchicoside, a drug that has been used for almost half a century to treat muscle pain, may also be considered as a new treatment for bone loss.""","""['Simone Reuter', 'Subash C Gupta', 'Kanokkarn Phromnoi', 'Bharat B Aggarwal']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Br J Pharmacol""","""['Thiocolchicoside a semi-synthetic derivative of the Glory Lily: a new weapon to fight metastatic bone resorption?', 'Embelin suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand and tumor cells in vitro through inhibition of the NF-κB cell signaling pathway.', 'RANKL signaling and osteoclastogenesis is negatively regulated by cardamonin.', 'Simvastatin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand through modulation of NF-kappaB pathway.', 'NF-κB signaling and bone resorption.', 'Medicinal Plants in Cancer Treatment: Contribution of Nuclear Factor- Kappa B (NF-kB) Inhibitors.', 'Benzodiazepine partially reverses tonic-clonic seizures induced by thiocolchicoside.', 'Drug Repositioning With an Anticancer Effect: Contributions to Reduced Cancer Incidence in Susceptible Individuals.', 'Overcoming cancer therapeutic bottleneck by drug repurposing.', 'Losartan increases bone mass and accelerates chondrocyte hypertrophy in developing skeleton.', 'Thiocolchicoside a semi-synthetic derivative of the Glory Lily: a new weapon to fight metastatic bone resorption?']"""

Current interpretations of prostate data rely on quantification algorithms that fit model metabolite resonances to individual voxel spectra and calculate relative levels of metabolites, such as choline, creatine, citrate and polyamines. Statistical pattern recognition techniques can potentially improve the detection of prostate cancer, but these analyses are hampered by artefacts and sources of noise in the data, such as variations in phase and frequency of resonances. Phase and frequency variations may arise as a result of spatial field gradients or local physiological conditions affecting the frequency of resonances, in particular those of citrate. Thus, there are unique challenges in developing a peak alignment algorithm for these data. We have developed a frequency and phase correction algorithm for automatic alignment of the resonances in prostate MRSI spectra. We demonstrate, with a simulated dataset, that alignment can be achieved to a phase standard deviation of 0.095 rad and a frequency standard deviation of 0.68 Hz for the citrate resonances. Three parameters were used to assess the improvement in peak alignment in the MRSI data of five patients: the percentage of variance in all MRSI spectra explained by their first principal component; the signal-to-noise ratio of a spectrum formed by taking the median value of the entire set at each spectral point; and the mean cross-correlation between all pairs of spectra. These parameters showed a greater similarity between spectra in all five datasets and the simulated data, demonstrating improved alignment for phase and frequency in these spectra. This peak alignment program is expected to improve pattern recognition significantly, enabling accurate detection and localisation of prostate cancer with MRSI.""","""['Alan J Wright', 'Lutgarde M C Buydens', 'Arend Heerschap']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['Quantification of prostate MRSI data by model-based time domain fitting and frequency domain analysis.', 'MR Spectroscopy in Prostate Cancer: New Algorithms to Optimize Metabolite Quantification.', 'Temporal B0 field variation effects on MRSI of the human prostate at 7 T and feasibility of correction using an internal field probe.', 'Metabolite ratios in 1H MR spectroscopic imaging of the prostate.', 'Proton MR spectroscopy of the prostate.', 'Developments in proton MR spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Absolute choline tissue concentration mapping for prostate cancer localization and characterization using 3D 1 H MRSI without water-signal suppression.']"""

Methods:   Couples were randomized adaptively to a 3-month WL, a 3-session face-to-face format (FF), or an internet-based format (WEB1). A second internet-based group (WEB2) was added to examine the relation between web site use and outcomes. At baseline, post-WL, post-treatment, and 6-month, and 12-month follow-up assessments, participants completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 to measure emotional distress, and the abbreviated Dyadic Adjustment Scale.  Results:   Outcomes did not change during the WL period. Of 115 couples that were randomized to FF or WEB1 and 71 couples in the WEB2 group, 34% dropped out.

Inflammation, focal prostatic atrophy, and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) are common in prostate tumor specimens, but it is not clear whether these lesions have prognostic significance.  Methods:   We conducted a case-control study nested in a cohort of men diagnosed with stage T1a-b PCa through transurethral resection of the prostate in Sweden. Cases are men who died of PCa (n = 228). Controls are men who survived more than 10 years after PCa diagnosis without metastases (n = 387). Slides were assessed for Gleason grade, inflammation, PIN, and four subtypes of focal prostatic atrophy: simple atrophy (SA), postatrophic hyperplasia (PAH), simple atrophy with cyst formation, and partial atrophy. We estimated OR and 95% CI for odds of lethal PCa with multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   Chronic inflammation and PIN were more frequently observed in tumors with PAH, but not SA. No specific type of atrophy or inflammation was significantly associated with lethal PCa overall, but there was a suggestion of a positive association for chronic inflammation. Independent of age, Gleason score, year of diagnosis, inflammation, and atrophy type, men with PIN were 89% more likely to die of PCa (95% CI: 1.04-3.42).

PSCA mRNA was measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay in peripheral blood samples from 116 patients with locally advanced or metastatic PCa who were treated with primary ADT and from 40 healthy controls. The Kaplan-Meier and the Cox proportional hazards methods were used to assess potential predictors of AIP. Pretreatment RT-PCR-PSCA was positive in 37 (31.9%) of 116 patients.

Although seven (14.9%) of 47 patients with Gleason score ≤7 were PSCA positive, 30 (43.5%) of 69 patients with Gleason score >7 were PSCA positive (p = 0.016). PSCA mRNA was detected in 28 (58.3%) of 48 patients with metastatic PCa, compared to nine (13.2%) of 68 patients with locally advanced disease (p = 0.012). AIP developed in 59 (50.9%) patients during a median follow-up period of 35.4 months (range: 4-78 months).

We previously estimated that about 2% of PrCa cases diagnosed ≤ 55 years harbour a BRCA2 mutation and PrCa among BRCA2 carriers has been shown to be more aggressive, with poorer survival.  Methods:   To further evaluate the role of BRCA2 in PrCa predisposition, we screened 1864 men with PrCa aged between 36 and 88 years. We analysed the BRCA2 gene using a novel high-throughput multiplex fluorescence heteroduplex detection system developed for the ABI3130xl genetic analyzer.  Results:   We identified 19 protein-truncating mutations, 3 in-frame deletions and 69 missense variants of uncertain significance (UV) in our sample set. All the carriers of truncating mutations developed PrCa at ≤ 65 years, with a prevalence of BRCA2 mutation of 1.20% for cases in this age group.  Conclusion:   Based on the estimated frequency of BRCA2 mutations in the United Kingdom we estimate that germline mutations in the BRCA2 gene confer an ∼ 8.6-fold increased risk of PrCa by age 65, corresponding to an absolute risk of ∼ 15% by age 65. These results suggest that routine testing of early onset PrCa cases for germline BRCA2 mutations will further help to refine the prevalence and risk associated with BRCA2 mutations and may be useful for guiding management options.""","""['Z Kote-Jarai', 'D Leongamornlert', 'E Saunders', 'M Tymrakiewicz', 'E Castro', 'N Mahmud', 'M Guy', 'S Edwards', ""L O'Brien"", 'E Sawyer', 'A Hall', 'R Wilkinson', 'T Dadaev', 'C Goh', 'D Easton;UKGPCS Collaborators;D Goldgar', 'R Eeles']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Subgroups of familial and aggressive prostate cancer with considerable frequencies of BRCA2 mutations.', 'The role of germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair genes in men ascertained for early-onset and/or familial prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer in BRCA2 germline mutation carriers is associated with poorer prognosis.', 'Hereditary Predisposition to Prostate Cancer: From Genetics to Clinical Implications.', 'Genetic Tests for Breast and Ovarian Cancer Internet.', 'Impact of DNA damage repair alterations on prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Multi-Gene Next-Generation Sequencing Panel for Analysis of BRCA1/BRCA2 and Homologous Recombination Repair Genes Alterations Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Frequency of Germline and Somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations in Prostate Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The Prevalence of Prostate Cancer Among Young Men Below 55\xa0Years of Age in Nigeria.', 'Serum testosterone and prostate cancer in men with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants.']"""

Treatment for locally advanced and metastatic PC remains unsatisfactory. The androgen receptor (AR) has been validated in having a key role in both naïve and castrate-resistant PC (CRPC). However, the significance of other signalling pathways in CRPC is less well validated.  Methods:   To gain a better insight into the molecular signalling cascades involved in clinical CRPC, we performed gene expression profiling using the Illumina DASL assay and studied matched hormone-naive (HN) and CR prostate tumours (n=10 pairs). Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was used to identify potential networks involved, and further validation was performed in in vitro cell models and clinical tumours.  Results:   Expression of 50 genes was significantly different between HN and CRPC. IPA revealed two networks of particular interest, including AR and FGFR1, respectively. FGFR1 expression was confirmed to be significantly upregulated in CRPC (P ≤ 0.005), and abnormal FGFR1 expression was associated with shorter time to biochemical relapse in HNPC (P=0.006) and less favourable disease-specific survival in CRPC (P=0.018).

In this study we observed courses of micturition symptoms and differentiated degrees of symptoms for each point in time while also considering the impact of bothersomeness. Our data show that not only significantly more patients who have undergone BT suffer from OAB than those who have undergone RP, but also that those affected show significantly higher values for severity of OAB symptoms throughout the whole observation period of 36 months. Our data analysis further shows that variability of OAB symptoms as well as fluctuation of severity of OAB symptoms vary to a significantly higher degree after BT than after RP. Looking only at mean figures at a given point in time clearly underestimates the underlying problem. This fact is not reflected in the literature.  Objective:   • To look at individual courses of postoperative micturition symptoms, especially urgency, in patients treated either with radical prostatectomy (RP) or with brachytherapy (BT).  Patients and methods:   • In a prospective longitudinal study we investigated individual changes in micturition symptoms before treatment, and 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after treatment. • All patients received the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life questionnaire, QLQ-C30, and the International Continence Society male questionnaire at each assessment. • We looked at long-term results as well as changes in time using repeated measures analysis of variance. We further analysed fluctuation of symptoms using sum of changes.  Results:   • Of the 389 patients treated consecutively in our clinic over the last few years, 99 patients with a mean (sd) age of 65 (6.3) years had completed all five questionnaires and thus were further analysed. Of these, 66 (66.7%) were treated with RP and 33 (33.3%) with BT. • With the exception of age, no significant difference was found between the treatment groups either in physical functioning or in prevalence and severity of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. • Adjusted for age and pretreatment symptoms in analysis of covariance, we found that there were statistically more symptoms of OAB 36 months after BT compared with those patients treated with RP (P < 0.025). Whereas 30% of patients complained about severe symptoms of urgency after BT, only 11% did so after RP. • Changes of severity of OAB symptoms over the course of time (P < 0.007) using analysis of repeated measures as well as variability of OAB symptoms (P < 0.033) using the two-sided Wilcoxon t-test were significantly higher in patients treated with BT than in patients treated with RP.  Conclusions:   • Independently of age and physical functioning, BT is significantly associated with higher rates of long-term urgency symptoms, even after 3 years. • Repeated measurements show that OAB symptoms are highly fluctuating and that in patients treated with BT, severity of symptoms as well as variability of symptoms was significantly higher than in those patients treated with RP. • Persistent OAB seems to be an underestimated problem after treatment for localized prostate cancer, especially in patients treated with BT.""","""['Martin Boettcher', 'Angelika Haselhuhn', 'Gerhard Jakse', 'Bernhard Brehmer', 'Ruth Kirschner-Hermanns']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Determinants of long-term quality of life and voiding function of patients treated with radical prostatectomy or permanent brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Permanent 125I-seed brachytherapy or radical prostatectomy: a prospective comparison considering oncological and quality of life results.', 'Health-related quality of life after radical prostatectomy and low-dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'A review of detrusor overactivity and the overactive bladder after radical prostate cancer treatment.', 'Voiding dysfunction in prostate cancer.', 'The association of smoking with urinary and sexual function recovery following radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Large Prostate Volume Does Not Negatively Impact Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Ultrahypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.', 'The impact of catheter removal time on urinary continence and overactive bladder symptoms after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a retrospective analysis of consecutive 432 cases from a single institution.', 'De Novo Urinary Storage Symptoms Are Common after Radical Prostatectomy: Incidence, Natural History and Predictors.', 'Preoperative exercise interventions to optimize continence outcomes following radical prostatectomy.']"""

Aim. To assess surgical outcomes and satisfaction after PP implantation in RP patients and compare the results with those in patients with vasculogenic ED (controls).  Methods:   A database of 415 consecutive PPs (January 1996-December 2008) was used to collate data on preimplantation ED treatments, surgical complications, satisfaction, and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scores before and 3 months after implantation. The results for 90 post-RP implants (79 primary, 11 secondary) and 131 implants for vasculogenic ED were compared.  Main outcome measures:   The main outcome measures of this study are intra- and postoperative complications and IIEF domain scores.  Results:   Mean follow-up of RP patients was 37.6 ± 26.8 months. Mean interval between RP and PP implantation was 31.5 ± 28.7 months. Nearly all primary implants (96.2%) were inflatable (3-piece, 70.1%; 2-piece, 24.1%). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of rates of infection (1.1%), mechanical failure (3.3%), and other surgical complications requiring revision surgery (migration, auto-inflation) (4.4%). For primary implants, the mean preimplantation IIEF score (all items) was significantly lower in RP patients than in controls (14.7 ± 5.9 vs. 22.6 ± 10.8, P = 0.003), chiefly because of significantly lower scores for erectile function, intercourse satisfaction, and orgasmic function. After PP implantation in RP patients, the scores for all domains improved, but the total score remained significantly lower than in controls (63.1 ± 7.0 vs. 68.5 ± 6.9, P = 0.005). The orgasmic function score was significantly lower (P < 0.001). Overall satisfaction rate was 86.1% in RP patients and 90.7% in controls (P = 0.3).  Conclusions:   PP implantation after RP is associated with low morbidity and high satisfaction. It improves the scores for all IIEF domains and, in particular, erectile function.

The growth of the prostate gland depends on circulating androgens and intracellular steroid signalling pathways. The effects of androgens are mediated through the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear transcription factor encoded by the AR gene. The common polymorphisms, CAG and GGN repeats, in exon 1 of this gene have been implicated as possible risk factors. Thus far, existing supporting data are scanty and none are from sub-Saharan African populations. Therefore, this study investigates the possible association between AR polymorphism repeat length (CAG and GGN) and prostate cancer in Nigerians. A total of 261 subjects (70 with prostate cancer, 68 with benign prostate hyperplasia [BPH], 123 age-matched apparently normal subjects as controls) were studied. CAG and GGN repeats length were determined by fragment length analysis using GeneScan. The CAG repeat length in prostate cancer and in BPH compared to the controls was significantly different (P < 0.05) with reduce length of CAG repeats showing a significant odds ratio (OR) in both cases. However, this was not observed in GGN repeat length, which showed no significant difference between cases and controls (P > 0.05). CAG and GGN haplotype variation showed no significant difference between cases and controls (P > 0.05), except that the haplotypes CAG > or =21 and GGN < or =21 were more common in the control group.

CCL20/CCR6 interactions are involved in prostatic and colonic malignancy pathogenesis. The expression and function of CCL20/CCR6 and its related Th-17 type immune response in NSCLC is not yet defined. We sought to characterize the role of the CCL20/CCR6/IL-17 axis in NSCLC tumor growth.  Methods:   A specialized histopathologist blindly assessed CCL20/CCR6 expression levels in 49 tissue samples of NSCLC patients operated in our department. Results were correlated to disease progression. Colony assays, ERK signaling and chemokine production were measured to assess cancer cell responsiveness to CCL20 and IL-17 stimulation.  Results:   CCL20 was highly expressed in the majority (38/49, 77.5%) of tumor samples. Only a minority of samples (8/49, 16.5%) showed high CCR6 expression. High CCR6 expression was associated with a shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.008) and conferred a disease stage-independent 4.87-fold increased risk for disease recurrence (P = 0.0076, CI 95% 1.52-15.563). Cancerous cell colony-forming capacity was increased by CCL20 stimulation; this effect was dependent in part on ERK phosphorylation and signaling.

The compound 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), in contrast, partially blocks glycolysis, slowing cell growth but rarely causing cell death. Injected into an animal, 2DG accumulates predominantly in tumors but does not harm other tissues. However, when cells that were highly resistant to ABT were pre-treated with 2DG for 3 hours, ABT became a potent inducer of apoptosis, rapidly releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria and activating caspases at submicromolar concentrations in a Bak/Bax-dependent manner. Bak is normally sequestered in complexes with Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. 2DG primes cells by interfering with Bak-Mcl-1 association, making it easier for ABT to dissociate Bak from Bcl-xL, freeing Bak to induce apoptosis. A highly active glucose transporter and Bid, as an agent of the mitochondrial apoptotic signal amplification loop, are necessary for efficient apoptosis induction in this system.

All tumors were propagated in mice as xenografts, designated the LuCaP series, to model phenotypic variation, such as responses to cancer-directed therapeutics. Although corresponding normal tissue was not available for most tumors, we were able to take advantage of increasingly deep catalogs of human genetic variation to remove most germline variants. On average, each tumor genome contained ~200 novel nonsynonymous variants, of which the vast majority was specific to individual carcinomas. A subset of genes was recurrently altered across tumors derived from different individuals, including TP53, DLK2, GPC6, and SDF4. Unexpectedly, three prostate cancer genomes exhibited substantially higher mutation frequencies, with 2,000-4,000 novel coding variants per exome. A comparison of castration-resistant and castration-sensitive pairs of tumor lines derived from the same prostate cancer highlights mutations in the Wnt pathway as potentially contributing to the development of castration resistance. Collectively, our results indicate that point mutations arising in coding regions of advanced prostate cancers are common but, with notable exceptions, very few genes are mutated in a substantial fraction of tumors.

Here, we show that sweet potato greens extract (SPGE) has the maximum polyphenol content compared with several commercial vegetables including spinach. The polyphenol-rich SPGE exerts significant antiproliferative activity in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines while sparing normal prostate epithelial cells. Mechanistically, SPGE perturbed cell cycle progression, reduced clonogenic survival, modulated cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory molecules and induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells both in vitro and in vivo. SPGE-induced apoptosis has a mitochondrially mediated component, which was attenuated by pretreatment with cyclosporin A. We also observed alterations of apoptosis regulatory molecules such as inactivation of Bcl2, upregulation of BAX, cytochrome c release and activation of downstream apoptotic signaling. SPGE caused DNA degradation as evident by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining of increased concentration of 3'-DNA ends. Furthermore, apoptotic induction was caspase dependent as shown by cleavage of caspase substrate, poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase. Oral administration of 400 mg/kg SPGE remarkably inhibited growth and progression of prostate tumor xenografts by ∼69% in nude mice, as shown by tumor volume measurements and non-invasive real-time bioluminescent imaging. Most importantly, SPGE did not cause any detectable toxicity to rapidly dividing normal tissues such as gut and bone marrow.

Participants underwent annual health checkups including PSA testing at the Center for Preventive Medicine in Japan. Participants with high PSA (≥ 4.0 ng/ml) underwent further examination for prostate cancer. A subgroup analysis was conducted age group (<50 years, ≥ 50 years).  Results:   Mean age was 50 years.

In over 50-year group, for those with initial PSA of <1.0, 1.0-1.9, 2.0-2.9, and 3.0-3.9 ng/ml at baseline, the 3-year cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 0%, 0.1%, 0.3%, and 5.7%, respectively. No prostate cancer was identified in those <50 years, regardless of PSA level.  Conclusions:   If PSA screening is recommended, males >50 years with PSA of 3.0-3.9 ng/ml at baseline should undergo rescreening at 2 years.

Filamentous outgrowths from spheroid structures that were formed from PC-3 cells in 3D cultures were strikingly evident when the spheroids were exposed to extracellular BMP7. This morphological change in 3D was accompanied by down-regulation of E-cadherin, which is an essential adhesion molecule for the integrity of epithelial phenotype. Invasiveness of the cancer cells was significantly enhanced with BMP7 treatment along with activation and up-regulation of proteases such as MMP1, MMP13, and urokinase plasminogen activator. Signal transduction of EMT conversion was examined by the use of certain pathway-specific inhibitors. Of the chemical inhibitors tested, inhibitors of PI3 kinase and Erk were found to suppress BMP-induced morphological changes both in 2D and 3D conditions. These results suggest that, besides the Smad signaling pathways, BMP-induced activation of PI3K and Erk contribute to EMT morphologic conversion of the PC-3 prostate cancer cells.

In this article, we describe the cancer phenotypes of these families and further assess the contribution of this variant in the French Canadian population. We screened index breast cancer cases from 58 cancer families with at least three confirmed cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer and 960 breast cancer cases (48 years mean age) not selected for family history of cancer that were previously found not to carry the most common BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations reported in this population. The index variant-positive cases from each family had breast cancer between the ages of 35-55 years (43 years mean age); and reported close relatives with breast cancer diagnoses between the ages of 28-84 years (57 years mean age). Three families had ovarian or peritoneal cancers. BRCA2-associated cancers, such as bladder, esophagus, pancreas, prostate, and thyroid cancers also occurred in these families. One c.9004G>A carrier also harbored the PALB2 c.2323C>T (Q775X) mutation found to recur in French Canadian breast cancer cases. No new BRCA2 variant carriers were identified in mutation screens. The absence of BRCA2 c.9004G>A carriers in the breast cancer cases not selected for family history contrasts with familial cases, supporting a pathogenic status for this variant and addition to the existing common BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-screening panel for French Canadian breast and/or ovarian cancer families.""","""['Stephanie Cote', 'Suzanna L Arcand', 'Robert Royer', 'Serge Nolet', 'Anne-Marie Mes-Masson', 'Parviz Ghadirian', 'William D Foulkes', 'Marc Tischkowitz', 'Steven A Narod', 'Diane Provencher', 'Patricia N Tonin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Contribution of the PALB2 c.2323C>T p.Q775X founder mutation in well-defined breast and/or ovarian cancer families and unselected ovarian cancer cases of French Canadian descent.', 'Double PALB2 and BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers are rare in breast cancer and breast-ovarian cancer syndrome families from the French Canadian founder population.', 'The limited spectrum of pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the French Canadian breast and breast-ovarian cancer families, a founder population of Quebec, Canada.', 'Histology of prophylactically removed ovaries from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers compared with noncarriers in hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome kindreds.', 'Clinical implications of germline mutations in breast cancer genes: RECQL.', 'Molecular Genetic Characteristics of FANCI, a Proposed New Ovarian Cancer Predisposing Gene.', 'A functionally impaired missense variant identified in French Canadian families implicates FANCI as a candidate ovarian cancer-predisposing gene.', 'Germline PALB2 Mutation in High-Risk Chinese Breast and/or Ovarian Cancer Patients.', 'The Genetic Analyses of French Canadians of Quebec Facilitate the Characterization of New Cancer Predisposing Genes Implicated in Hereditary Breast and/or Ovarian Cancer Syndrome Families.', 'Founder BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 pathogenic variants in French-Canadian breast cancer cases and controls.']"""

To improve local staging, the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) for the identification of promoter hypermethylation of the detoxifying glutathione-S-transferase P1 gene (GSTP1) to detect occult prostate cancer (PCa) cells in the prostatic fossa after RP.  Methods:   A total of 39 consecutive patients with clinically organ-confined PCa underwent RP. After gland excision, biopsies were obtained from eight defined areas of the prostatic fossa and bisected for both histopathological and molecular analyses. Results were related to clinicopathological data including tumor stage, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Of 39 patients, 11 with PCa had at least one positive molecular margin status indicated by GSTP1 methylation. These included 5 of 17 (29.4%) with organ-confined and 6 of 22 (27.3%) with advanced (≥pT3 and/or pN+) PCa. GSTP1 methylation in surgical margins strongly correlated with histopathological R-status (P = 0.022) and preoperative PSA (P = 0.01) whereas no association with tumor stage (pT2 vs pT3), grade (Gleason score <7 vs ≥7), and lymph node status was found. No patient experienced biochemical relapse.  Conclusions:   GSTP1 hypermethylation detected by Q-MSP in prostatic fossa biopsies after RP is well suited for the detection of occult tumor cells in surgical margins. However, the limited number of patients and the short-term follow-up does not allow definite conclusions on the prognostic value of GSTP1 in surgical margins.""","""['Florian Jentzmik', 'Hans Krause', 'Ute Reichelt', 'Andres Jan Schrader', 'Mark Schrader', 'Daniel Baumunk', 'Hannes Cash', 'Kurt Miller', 'Martin Schostak']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Molecular margin status after radical prostatectomy using glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) promoter hypermethylation.', 'Preoperative serum DNA GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation and the risk of early prostate-specific antigen recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of hormonal therapy on the detection of promoter hypermethylation of the detoxifying glutathione-S-transferase P1 gene (GSTP1) in prostate cancer.', 'GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation as a molecular biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Glutathione-S-Transferase p1 Gene Promoter Methylation in Cell-Free DNA as a Diagnostic and Prognostic Tool for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'NOVA1 inhibition by miR-146b-5p in the remnant tissue microenvironment defines occult residual disease after gastric cancer removal.', 'DNA comparison between operative and biopsy specimens to investigate stage pT0 after radical prostatectomy.', 'Methylation of APC and GSTP1 in non-neoplastic tissue adjacent to prostate tumour and mortality from prostate cancer.']"""

However, the mechanism by which sodium butyrate (SB) induces apoptosis is not completely understood. We focused on SB which exists in the intestine and is therefore expected to have less adverse effects. In this study, three prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145 and PC-3) were treated in vitro with different concentrations of SB. Cell proliferation was studied by the XTT assay; cell cycle analysis and induction of apoptosis were studied by laser scanning cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to study p21, p27, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, caspase-3, caspase-7, Fas, FADD, TRADD, Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression. SB inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, DU145 and PC-3). Western blot analysis showed dose-dependent increases of p21 levels in DU145 and PC-3 cells, and dose-dependent decreases of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and procaspase-3 protein levels in all three prostate cancer cell lines. Bcl-xL was significantly down-regulated in DU145 cells, and Bcl-2 was significantly down-regulated in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. No significant changes were observed in procaspase-7, TRADD and Bax expression, although slight decreases in Fas and FADD expression were seen in all three prostate cancer cell lines. Analysis of cell morphology using laser scanning microscopy detected condensed and fragmented nuclei. In conclusion, SB induces G1 and G2 arrest by increasing p21 expression resulting in CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 down-regulation. SB potently induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by DNA fragmentation, down-regulated Bcl-2 in LNCaP and PC-3 cells, Bcl-xL in DU145 cells, and down-regulated procaspase-3, but not procaspase-7, in these human prostate cancer cell lines.

Objective:   The objective was to study the sociodemographic characteristics and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among NH residents with and without a cancer diagnosis, adjusting for comorbidity.  Methods:   This was a cross-sectional observation study: 30 NHs; 227 residents 65 to 102 years old: 60 with cancer and 167 without, at least 6 months' residence. All had Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5 or less and could converse. Health-related quality of life was measured using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey in face-to-face interviews. Sociodemographic variables and medical diagnoses were obtained from records. Possible differences in HRQOL, controlled for age, gender, marital status, education, length of stay, and comorbidity, were examined by multiple linear regression analyses.  Results:   The most common cancer diagnoses were breast cancer among women (20%) and prostate cancer among men (12%). More residents with cancer were married (P = .007), reported more bodily pain (P = .17) and scored lower on all other HRQOL subscales, except for role-emotional. General health was worse than that of the residents without cancer (P = .04) after adjusting for sociodemographic variables but not for comorbidity (P = .06).  Conclusion:   Cognitively intact NH residents with cancer reported more pain and worse general health but better role limitation related to emotional problems compared with residents without cancer.

Some investigators have suggested that use of opioids favour relapse, whereas regional analgesia and NSAIDs improve oncological outcomes.  Objective:   To evaluate the impact of intraoperative analgesia (epidural and intravenous) on the incidence of biochemical recurrence-free (BRF) survival.  Design, setting and participants:   This retrospective study includes 1111 consecutive retropubic radical prostatectomies (RRPs) for localised prostate cancer, performed between 1993 and 2006. Median follow-up was 38 months (interquartile range 16-69). BRF survival probabilities were compared with log-rank tests and the Cox regression model.  Main outcome measures and results:   Epidural analgesia was used in 52% of patients, intravenous ketorolac in 25%, sufentanil in 97%, clonidine in 25% and ketamine in 16%. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that intravenous sufentanil significantly reduced BRF survival rate, hazard ratio 7.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.79, 9.78), for extracapsular extension stage pT 2 or less, hazard ratio 0.44 (95% CI 0.12, 0.75), Gleason score at least 7, hazard ratio 1.96 (95% CI 1.65, 2.26), positive margin, hazard ratio 1.87 (95% CI 1.58, 2.02) and lymph node involvement, hazard ratio 1.77 (95% CI 1.27, 2.27, P > 0.05). In contrast, neither epidural analgesia nor other analgesics were associated with a statistically significant effect (P > 0.05).

No significant difference was found between the 3rd month and the 6th month after the patients received MAB (P>0.05). The prostate volume had significant difference in the 3rd month and the 6th month (P<0.05), but no significant difference in the 6th month and the 9th month (P>0.05).

Material and methods:   We compared the enhanced collapsed cone (eCC) algorithm implemented in OncentraMasterplan and the XVMC (MC) code in Monaco. Test plans were created for 10MV FF and FFF beams. Single beam tests were delivered to radiochromic films positioned within a solid water phantom and evaluated with 1D γ-index analysis. Conformal plans were verified with ion chambers in an anthropomorphic thorax phantom. IMRT plans were applied to the Delta4 system and evaluated with γ-criteria of 3% and 3mm.  Results:   1D γ-index evaluation revealed significantly lower (p<0.05) average γ(mean)-values of 0.46±0.22 for MC calculated FFF profiles compared to average values of 0.53±0.27 detected for FF beams. Respective values for eCC were 0.42±0.27/0.38±0.26 (FF/FFF). When considering off-axis profiles separately, we found significantly reduced average γ(mean)-values for FFF and both algorithms (MC: 0.55±24 vs. 0.45±0.21, eCC: 0.41±0.24 vs. 0.35±0.22). No significant differences were detected on-axis. Absolute dosimetry in the anthropomorphic phantom revealed superior results for MC based dose calculation, with mean deviations of 0.8±0.8/0.0±1.0% compared to -0.1±1.7/-0.5±0.1.7% (FF/FFF) for the eCC algorithm. IMRT plans showed similar results for both linac modes.  Conclusions:   The dose calculation accuracy for unflattened beams was found to be at least as high as for flattened beams.

Objective:   We assessed the frequency of multiple events (fractures, stroke, heart disease [HD], and thromboembolic disease [TED]) following PCa diagnosis.  Design, setting, and participants:   PCBaSe Sweden is based on the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) that covers >96% of incident PCa cases in Sweden.  Measurements:   We evaluated the number of events (fractures, stroke, HD, and TED) leading to hospitalisation recorded in the National Hospital Discharge Registry after PCa diagnosis and conducted multivariate age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the risk of developing multiple events.  Results and limitations:   Between 1997 and 2007, 30 642 men received primary endocrine treatment, 26 432 curative treatment, and 19 526 surveillance: 75% had no event during follow-up, 17% had one event, and 9% had more than one event. The incidence of any event was 102 in 1000 person-years. Men who already had experienced an event, particularly HD, before or after the date of PCa diagnosis were more likely to have multiple events afterwards. For example, the hazard ratio of developing a third event for those with two or more events of HD before PCa diagnosis was 1.40 (95% confidence interval, 1.28-1.52) compared with those with no events of HD before PCa diagnosis. Events treated without hospitalisation were not included, so the number of adverse events is possibly underestimated.  Conclusions:   A third of PCa patients with an adverse event after treatment subsequently experienced another adverse event, but apart from history of HD or stroke before PCa diagnosis, no specific characteristics were found for these men. Thus PCa management needs to take into account the risk of adverse events in all PCa patients, especially those with a history of adverse events before PCa diagnosis.""","""['Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'Hans Garmo', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Pär Stattin', 'Jan Adolfsson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Adverse effects of androgen deprivation and the limits of national tumor registries.', 'Re: Mieke Van Hemelrijck, Hans Garmo, Lars Holmberg, et al.

Methods:   We evaluated the view of physicians performing multimedia supported preoperative educations within a randomized controlled trial. Therein 8 physicians educated 203 patients for radical prostatectomy.  Results:   All physicians rated multimedia supported education better than the standard procedure. Main reasons were better comprehensibility, the visual presentation, and greater ease in explaining complex issues. Objective time measurement showed no difference between both educations. The major disadvantage was the impression, that multimedia supported education lasted longer. Moreover, they had the impression that some details could be further improved. Given the choice, every physician would decide for multimedia support.  Conclusion:   Physicians appreciate multimedia support in preoperative education and contrary to their impression, multimedia support does not prolong patient education. Therefore, patients and physicians likewise profit from multimedia support for education and counseling.

Thus, the role of NKX3.1 as a functional topoisomerase I activity enhancer in cell cycle regulation and the DNA damage response (DDR) was explored in prostate cancer cell lines. As an early response to DNA damage following CPT-11 treatment, we found that there was an increase in the γH2AX(S139) foci number and that total phosphorylation levels were reduced in PC-3 cells following ectopic NKX3.1 expression as well as in LNCaP cells following androgen administration. Furthermore, upon drug treatment, the increase in ATM(S1981) phosphorylation was reduced in the presence of NKX3.1 expression, whereas DNA-PKcs expression was increased. Additionally, phosphorylation of CHK2(T68) and NBS1(S343) was abrogated by ectopic NKX3.1 expression, compared with the increasing levels in control PC-3 cells in a time-course experiment. Finally, NKX3.1 expression maintained a high cyclin D1 expression level regardless of drug treatment, while total γH2AX(S139) phosphorylation remained depleted in PC-3, as well as in LNCaP, cells.

Since then, clinical trials have concentrated on three main populations of patients with metastatic CRPC: those who are chemotherapy naïve and are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, those who need docetaxel therapy, and those who have received docetaxel previously and/or those with symptomatic disease. Over the last year, four Phase III therapeutic trials have met their primary endpoint of improved overall survival: sipuleucel-T in the pre-chemotherapy setting, cabazitaxel and abiraterone in the post-docetaxel setting, and radium-223 for those with symptomatic bone metastases who have received or are not suitable to receive docetaxel. In addition to these therapeutic trials, a Phase III head-to-head trial of denosumab compared to zoledronic acid showed that denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing skeletal related events. As a result, the treatment paradigm for metastatic CRPC is changing rapidly.

Methods and materials:   Semiautomatic segmentation using a tapered ellipsoid model was applied to transrectal ultrasound images. Region-based volumetric evaluation was performed between original and physician-reviewed semiautomatic contours. For dosimetric assessment, treatment plans generated on semiautomatic contours were overlaid on physician-reviewed semiautomatic contours and dose parameters were computed. To establish a threshold for the acceptable amount of dosimetric degradation below which the adoption of semiautomatic planning is unacceptable, the range of variability in dosimetric quality attributed to manual variability was obtained and compared with that of semiautomatic contours.  Results:   An average volume error (1-Dice similarity coefficient) of less than 7% between semiautomatic and manual volumes (140 cases) was obtained. The difference between the mean V(100) of plans created for semiautomatic contours then overlaid on physician-reviewed semiautomatic contours and the original V(100) values, that is, before overlaying on the physician-reviewed contours (41 cases) was lower than 5%. An average total duration of 2-4min, which includes algorithm initialization, 11.67±3.57s algorithm time, and contour modification is required per case. This algorithm is being used at the British Columbia Cancer Agency and to this date has been applied for the treatment of more than 600 patients.  Conclusions:   In terms of volumetric and dosimetric accuracy, the proposed algorithm is a suitable replacement for manual segmentation in the context of our planning technique.

It does this by being converted to 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (ZMP), an AMP analog. We combined this promising antineoplastic agent with ionizing radiation in an attempt to increase its efficacy.  Methods and materials:   The effect of AICAR on cell proliferation, cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species production, radiosensitivity, and AMPK activation was determined in the human prostate cancer cell line PC3. To elucidate the radiosensitizing mechanism, clonogenic survival assays in the presence of a drug agonist or antagonist or with small interfering RNA targeting AMPK were done, as well as measurements of ZMP production and double strand break repair. Moreover, immunoblot analysis of the radiation response signaling pathways after AICAR treatment was performed.  Results:   The incubation of human PC3 prostate cancer cells with AICAR-activated AMPK inhibited cell proliferation, decreased viability, increased apoptosis, and generated reactive oxygen species in a dose- and time-dependent manner. None of these endpoints gave more than additive effects when radiation was added. Radiosensitization was observed but only after 72 hours of treatment with 250 μM AICAR, suggesting that it was independent of AMPK activation. This finding was confirmed by small interfering RNA knockdown of AMPK. The mechanism of radiosensitization was associated with imbalanced deoxynucleotide pools owing to ZMP accumulation after AICAR administration that interfered with DNA repair.  Conclusions:   Our findings on the favorable interaction between low doses of AICAR and ionizing radiation in PC3 cells could open new perspectives for the clinical use of this or similar compounds. However, additional research is still required to establish the ZMP pathway as being of general applicability.""","""['Sofie F Isebaert', 'Johannes V Swinnen', 'William H McBride', 'Adrian C Begg', 'Karin M Haustermans']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""[""Overexpression of CYP2E1 induces HepG2 cells death by the AMP kinase activator 5'-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR)."", 'Activation of AMP-kinase by AICAR induces apoptosis of DU-145 prostate cancer cells through generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase.', '5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranoside stimulates tyrosine hydroxylase activity and catecholamine secretion by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in PC12 cells.', 'The Role of AMPK/mTOR Modulators in the Therapy of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'Beyond AICA riboside: in search of new specific AMP-activated protein kinase activators.', 'Inhibition of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Proliferation and Survival by Rosemary Extract Is Associated with Activation of ERK and AMPK.', 'Rho GTPases in cancer radiotherapy and metastasis.', 'The roles of glucose metabolic reprogramming in chemo- and radio-resistance.', 'Identification of ATIC as a Novel Target for Chemoradiosensitization.', 'MUC1-Mediated Metabolic Alterations Regulate Response to Radiotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer.']"""

We determined the risk of serious complications requiring hospitalization. We hypothesized that with emerging multidrug resistant organisms there may be an increasing risk of infectious complications.  Materials and methods:   In a 5% random sample of Medicare participants in SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) regions from 1991 to 2007 we compared 30-day hospitalization rates and ICD-9 primary diagnosis codes for admissions between 17,472 men who underwent prostate biopsy and a random sample of 134,977 controls. Multivariate logistic and Poisson regression were used to examine the risk and predictors of serious infectious and noninfectious complications with time.  Results:   The 30-day hospitalization rate was 6.9% within 30 days of prostate biopsy, which was substantially higher than the 2.7% in the control population. After adjusting for age, race, SEER region, year and comorbidities prostate biopsy was associated with a 2.65-fold (95% CI 2.47-2.84) increased risk of hospitalization within 30 days compared to the control population (p <0.0001). The risk of infectious complications requiring hospitalization after biopsy was significantly greater in more recent years (p(trend) = 0.001). Among men undergoing biopsy, later year, nonwhite race and higher comorbidity scores were significantly associated with an increased risk of infectious complications.  Conclusions:   The risk of hospitalization within 30 days of prostate biopsy was significantly higher than in a control population. Infectious complications after prostate biopsy have increased in recent years while the rate of serious noninfectious complications is relatively stable.

The investigational ProCaM™ prostate cancer methylation assay detects aberrant methylation of DNA in cells associated with prostate cancer. We describe a large, prospective, multicenter study done to verify the performance of this assay.  Materials and methods:   The assay is designed to detect epigenetic modifications in the 3 markers GSTP1, RARβ2 and APC, which are indicative of prostate cancer. A total of 232 men with cancer and 283 without cancer from 18 clinical sites were evaluated by trained operators at central testing laboratories. Study inclusion criteria were age 40 to 75 years, total prostate specific antigen between 2.0 and 10.0 ng/ml, and a digital rectal examination result. All participants signed an informed consent form and underwent transrectal ultrasound guided needle biopsy with 10 or more cores.  Results:   Assay sensitivity was 60%, specificity was 80% and the informative rate was 97%. Assay predictive accuracy was higher than that of age, digital rectal examination, family history, prostate specific antigen, prior negative biopsy and prostate volume (AUC 0.73 vs 0.52 to 0.66, p <0.038). Risk factors plus the assay improved overall predictive power (AUC 0.79, p = 0.001). A man with a positive prostate cancer methylation result was 7.7 times more likely to have high grade cancer.

Materials and methods:   We sampled 1,598 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 1997 to 2004 at the Greater Los Angeles and Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to determine the risks of other cause mortality associated with comorbidities and used these hazard ratios to re-weight the Charlson index. We then compared the ability of each index to predict other cause mortality.  Results:   Cox modeling showed that moderate to severe liver disease, metastatic solid tumor, lymphoma and leukemia carried the highest risk (HR greater than 5) for other cause mortality, followed by moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, moderate to severe renal disease, dementia, hemiplegia and congestive heart failure (HR 2.5 to less than 3.5). The revised and original Charlson indices performed similarly in predicting other cause mortality across all patients (c-index 0.816 vs 0.802). However, in survival analysis our revised index identified 137 men with a greater than 90% probability of other cause mortality within 10 years while the original Charlson identified only 51. In multivariate modeling the odds of 5-year other cause mortality for men with original Charlson scores 1, 2, 3 and 4+ were 2.9, 6.0, 9.2 and 29.8, respectively, compared with 3.9, 6.2, 12.8 and 84.2 for the revised index.

Event rates were similar before and after degarelix treatment in the total population (5.5 vs 6.1/100 person-years, p = 0.45) and in men without cardiovascular disease (5.6 vs 4.3/100 person-years, p = 0.11). In contrast, event rates appeared higher after degarelix treatment in men with cardiovascular disease at baseline (5.3 to 10.5 events per 100 person-years, p = 0.0013). On multivariate analysis cardiovascular disease at baseline was the strongest independent predictor of events, followed by older age, alcohol abstinence and obesity (each p <0.05). Degarelix dose and schedule were not independently associated with cardiovascular disease events.  Conclusions:   In men with prostate cancer observed rates of cardiovascular disease events were similar before and after degarelix treatment. Events were largely confined to men with preexisting cardiovascular disease and further modulated by age and modifiable risk factors.

Materials and methods:   The study cohort included men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1998 and 2010 enrolled in active surveillance with 6 or more months of followup. Change in volume over time was assessed as change in percent cores positive, percent cancer in 1 biopsy core and the doubling of total cancer volume (mm). Logistic regression was used to determine the association between grade and volume progression.  Results:   A total of 399 men met the study inclusion criteria. Mean patient age was 61.8 years old and 313 (78%) had low risk disease. Overall 231 (58%) men had stable disease on repeat biopsies. There were 39 (10%) men with a volume increase, defined by an increase to more than 33% cores involved or an increase in maximum single core positive to more than 50%, and there were 44 (11%) with an increase in volume and grade. Approximately 10% of men experienced a decrease in cancer volume. On multivariate analysis there was a significant association between grade and volume progression on any biopsy (OR 3.07), and a doubling of tumor length (mm) at 5 years (OR 6.30).  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer volume increases and decreases at a similar rate of 10% per biopsy. An increase in tumor volume is associated with an increase in cancer grade on early repeat biopsies.

PSA measurements are an important component of surveillance for men with clinically localized prostate cancer who do not receive initial treatment.  Methods:   Using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare program, we evaluated 7145 men, aged 65-84 years, who had been diagnosed from 1997 to 2002 with American Joint Committee on Cancer, 6th edition, Stage T1-T2, Gleason score ≤7 prostate cancer and received expectant management.

We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the relationship between the primary outcome of annual PSA surveillance and the patient, clinical, and demographic characteristics.  Results:   Of the men with localized Gleason score ≤7 prostate cancer who did not receive initial treatment, 39% underwent at least annual PSA measurement. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, annual PSA surveillance was positively associated with older age (75-84 vs 65-74 years, odds ratio [OR] 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.52), more comorbidities (OR 3.38, 95% CI 2.91-3.93), and residence in a neighborhood with a greater median income (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.46-2.25). A lower likelihood of annual PSA surveillance was associated with black race (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45-0.67).

Methods:   A cohort study was performed to evaluate hormone-related factors associated with meningioma. Patients (12-89 years) with a first diagnosis of meningioma (January 1996-June 2008) were identified from The Health Improvement Network UK primary care database and age- and sex-matched to controls (n=10000) from the same cohort. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated following a nested case control analysis using unconditional logistic regression.  Results:   In total, 745 patients with meningioma were identified from a study population of 2171287. No significantly increased risk of meningioma was found among female users of oral contraceptives (OR: 1.15; CI: 0.67-1.98), hormone replacement therapy (OR: 0.99; CI: 0.73-1.35) or low-dose cyproterone acetate (CPA; OR: 1.51; CI: 0.33-6.86) compared with non-users. There was a significantly increased risk of meningioma among male users of androgen analogues (OR: 19.09; CI: 2.81-129.74) and among users of high-dose CPA (OR: 6.30; CI: 1.37-28.94) compared with non-users, however there were only three cases currently using these drugs. No significant association was found between meningioma and prostate, breast, or genital cancers.  Conclusions:   Our results do not support a role for exogenous hormone use by females in meningioma development. The risk in males was only observed with high-dose, short-term (<1 year) therapy.

Results:   During the period of the study, 123 patients benefit of a histological diagnosis of prostate cancer recording Gleason score on biopsies and postsurgical intervention on gross specimen. After analysis of biopsies and for gross specimen the reported Gleason scores vary from 3 to 9 and the mean was 5.9 and 6.1 respectively.

We noted a difference of score of one point in 37.3% of patients and a difference of two points and more in 30% of cases. In 28.4% the Gleason scores were overestimated while in 39% they were underestimated. More than half of the patients' cohort was classified in the group of histologically moderately differentiated cancer. When grouping the patients according to the histological types well, moderately or less differentiated cancers, the Gleason scores concordance for biopsies and for gross specimen change from 32.5% up to 74.8%. The correlation can be considered good for the less differentiated cancers.  Conclusion:   Gleason score showed some limits in the appreciation of the prediction.

Interleukins (IL) represent essential inflammation mediators. IL-2, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21, sharing a common receptor γ chain (c-γ), control T lymphocyte homeostasis and proliferation and play major roles in regulating cancer-immune system interactions. We evaluated local IL-2, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21 gene expression in prostate tissues from patients with early stage PCA or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As control, we used IL-6 gene, encoding an IL involved in PCA progression. IL-6, IL-7 and IL-15 titres were also measured in patients' sera.  Methods:   Eighty patients with BPH and 79 with early (1 to 2c) stage PCA were enrolled. Gene expression in prostate tissues was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Serum IL concentrations and acute phase protein titres were evaluated by ELISA. Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon and χ(2) tests were used to compare IL gene expression and serum titers in the two groups of patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the possibility to distinguish sera from different groups of patients based on IL titers.  Results:   IL-2 and IL-21 gene expression was comparably detectable, with low frequency and at low extents, in PCA and BPH tissues. In contrast, IL-6, IL-7 and IL-15 genes were expressed more frequently (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0047 and p = 0.0085, respectively) and to significantly higher extents (p = 0.0051, p = 0.0310 and p = 0.0205, respectively) in early stage PCA than in BPH tissues. Corresponding proteins could be detected to significantly higher amounts in sera from patients with localized PCA, than in those from patients with BPH (p = 0.0153, p = 0.0174 and p = 0.0064, respectively). Analysis of ROC curves indicates that IL-7 (p = 0.0039), but not IL-6 (p = 0.2938) or IL-15 (p = 0.1804) titres were able to distinguish sera from patients with malignancy from those from patients with benign disease. Serum titres of C reactive (CRP), high mobility group B1 (HMGB1) and serum amyloid A (SAA) acute phase proteins were similar in both groups of patients.

Few studies have investigated the molecular pathways potentially capable of predicting said response. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) acts as a 'master switch' protein in cancer cells, modulating metabolism, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Cancer treatment with mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin analogs, or rapalogs) has produced promising results in various malignancies (renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and melanoma). The novel aim of the present study was to ascertain the prognostic role of mTOR expression in a series of patients with LSCC treated with primary surgery followed by RT.  Methods:   The retrospective study involved 25 consecutive patients with LSCC given postoperative RT. Immunohistochemical mTOR expression was evaluated in primary LSCC by image analysis.  Results:   The locoregional recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with LSCC whose mTOR expression was >2.5% (P = 0.013). After postoperative RT, the locoregional recurrence risk ratio was 3.25 in LSCCs with mTOR >2.5%. The different disease-free survival was significantly shorter in cases of LSCC with mTOR >2.5% (P = 0.029).  Conclusions:   mTOR should be studied as a potential predictor for identifying LSCCs at higher risk of early recurrence after postoperative RT.

A prospective multi-Institute study (DUE-01) was implemented with the aim to assess the predictive parameters of ED. Previously, an evaluation of inter-observer variations of PB contouring was mandatory in order to quantify its impact on PB dose-volume parameters by means of a dummy run exercise. Fifteen observers, from different Institutes, drew the PB on the planning CT images of ten patients; inter-observer variations were analysed in terms of PB volume variation and cranial/caudal limits. 3DCRT treatment plans were simulated to evaluate the impact of PB contouring inter-variability on dose-volume statistics parameters. For DVH analysis the values of PB mean dose and the volume of PB receiving more than 50 Gy and 70 Gy (V50 and V70, respectively) were considered. Systematic differences from the average values were assessed by the Wilcoxon test. Seven observers systematically overestimated or underestimated the PB volume with deviations from the average volumes ranging between -48% and +34% (p < 0.05). The analysis of the cranial and caudal borders showed a prevalence of random over systematic deviations. Inter-observer contouring variability strongly impacts on DVH parameters, although standard deviations of inter-patient differences were larger than inter-observer variations: 14.5 Gy versus 6.8 Gy for mean PB dose, 23.0% versus 11.0% and 16.8% versus 9.3% for V50 and V70 respectively. In conclusion, despite the large inter-observer variation in contouring PB, a large multi-centric study may have the possibility to detect a possible correlation between PB % dose-volume parameters and ED. The impact of contouring uncertainty could be reduced by ""a posteriori"" contouring from a single observer or by introducing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the planning procedures and/or in improving the skill of observers through post-dummy run tutoring of those observers showing large systematic deviations from the mean.""","""['Lucia Perna', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Eleonora Maggiulli', 'Gianni Fellin', 'Tiziana Rancati', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Vittorio Vavassori', 'Sergio Villa', 'Claudio Fiorino']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Rectum contouring variability in patients treated for prostate cancer: impact on rectum dose-volume histograms and normal tissue complication probability.', 'The impact of contouring uncertainty on rectal 3D dose-volume data: results of a dummy run in a multicenter trial (AIROPROS01-02).', 'Magnetic resonance imaging for prostate bed radiotherapy planning: An inter- and intra-observer variability study.', 'Sparing the penile bulb in the radical irradiation of clinically localised prostate carcinoma: A comparison between MRI and CT prostatic apex definition in 3DCRT, Linac-IMRT and Helical Tomotherapy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in the radiation treatment planning of localized prostate cancer using intra-prostatic fiducial markers for computed tomography co-registration.', 'Evaluation of erectile potency and radiation dose to the penile bulb using image guided radiotherapy in the CHHiP trial.', 'Dose to penile bulb is not associated with erectile dysfunction 18\u202fmonths post radiotherapy: A secondary analysis of a randomized trial.', 'Baseline status and dose to the penile bulb predict impotence 1\xa0year after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Rationale and development of image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy post-prostatectomy: the present standard of care?']"""

Recently, a SP-based prostate cancer (PCa) predictive model for both preoperative (Px+) and postoperative (Px) prostatectomy has been developed. The purpose of this study is to calculate the percent agreement and the concordance between the Px+ and Px end points.  Patients and methods:   Fifty-three patients underwent robot-assisted prostatectomy for PCa, and had Px+ and Px testing performed. Data were collected on Px+ end points and Px end points along with pathologic specimen results. The percent agreement and the degree of correlation between the Px+ and Px end points were then calculated.  Results:   The percent agreement (PA) between Px+ end points and Px end points ranged from 77% to 87%. The PA between a high Px+ favorable pathology (FP) classification and dominant Gleason score ≤ 3 and Gleason sum ≤ 6 was 71.7% and 37.4%, respectively. On univariate analysis, Px+ disease progression (DP) score significantly correlated with Px prostate-specific antigen recurrence (PSAR) score (P<0.001), while Px+ DP probability significantly correlated with PxPSAR probability (P<0.001). Px+ FP probability significantly correlated with postprostatectomy dominant Gleason grade ≤ 3 (P<0.001) and Gleason sum (P<0.001).  Conclusion:   The PA between Px+ and Px testing end points for radical prostatectomy patients was very good. Furthermore, there was a direct correlation between most Px+ and Px end points. While the Px+FP classification and Gleason sum demonstrated a poor PA, Px+FP score still maintained a direct correlation to prostatectomy Gleason sum.""","""['Joseph A Graversen', 'Lara K Suh', 'Adam C Mues', 'Ruslan Korets', 'Michael J Donovan', 'Faisal M Khan', 'Qiuhua Liu', 'Jaime Landman', 'Mantu Gupta', 'James M McKiernan', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Improved risk stratification for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy using a novel risk group system based on prostate specific antigen density and biopsy Gleason score.', 'Preoperative prostate-specific antigen isoform p2PSA and its derivatives, %p2PSA and prostate health index, predict pathologic outcomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and pathologic outcome after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer patients with a preoperative Gleason sum of 8 to 10.', 'Gleason score 7 prostate cancer on needle biopsy: relation of primary pattern 3 or 4 to pathological stage and progression after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate cancer: Mouse model for testing treatments.']"""

In a study of autopsies of patients with prostate cancer, 65%-75% had bone metastases. Bone metastases place a substantial economic burden on payers with estimated total annual costs of $1.9 billion in the United States. Skeletal-related events (SREs), including pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, and radiation to bone, affect approximately 50% of patients with bone metastases. They are associated with a decreased quality of life and increased health care costs. Zoledronic acid is an effective treatment in preventing SREs in solid tumors and multiple myeloma. Recently, denosumab was FDA-approved for prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. A Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT00321620) demonstrated that denosumab had superior efficacy in delaying first and subsequent SREs compared with zoledronic acid. However, the economic value of denosumab has not been assessed in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.  Objective:   To compare the cost-effectiveness of denosumab with zoledronic acid in the treatment of bone metastases in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.  Methods:   An Excel-based Markov model was developed to assess costs and effectiveness associated with the 2 treatments over a 1- and 3-year time horizon. Because the evaluation was conducted from the perspective of a U.S. third-party payer, only direct costs were included. Consistent with the primary outcome in the Phase 3 trial, effectiveness was assessed based on the number of SREs. The model consisted of 9 health states defined by SRE occurrence, SRE history, disease progression, and death. A hypothetical cohort of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer received either denosumab 120 mg or zoledronic acid 4 mg at the model entry and transitioned among the 9 health states at the beginning of each 13-week cycle. Transition probabilities associated with experiencing the first SRE, subsequent SREs, disease progression, and death were primarily derived from the results of the Phase 3 clinical trial and were supplemented with published literature. The model assumed that a maximum of 1 SRE could occur in each cycle. Drug costs included wholesale acquisition cost, health care professional costs associated with drug administration, and drug monitoring costs, if applicable. Nondrug costs included incremental costs associated with disease progression, costs associated with SREs, and terminal care costs, which were derived from the literature. Adverse event (AE) costs were estimated based on the incidence rates reported in the Phase 3 trial. Resource utilization associated with AEs was estimated based on consultation with a senior medical director employed by the study sponsor. All costs were presented in 2010 dollars. The base case estimated the incremental total cost per SRE avoided over a 1-year time horizon. Results for a 3-year time horizon were also estimated. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to test the robustness of the model.  Results:   In the base case, the total per patient costs incurred over 1 year were estimated at $35,341 ($19,230 drug costs and $16,111 nondrug costs) for denosumab and $27,528 ($10,960 drug costs and $16,569 nondrug costs) for zoledronic acid, with an incremental total direct cost of $7,813 for denosumab. The estimated numbers of SREs per patient during the 1-year period were 0.49 for denosumab and 0.60 for zoledronic acid, resulting in an incremental number of SREs of -0.11 in the denosumab arm. The estimated incremental total direct costs per SRE avoided with the use of denosumab instead of zoledronic acid were $71,027 for 1 year and $51,319 for 3 years. The 1-way sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were sensitive to the drug costs, median time to first SRE, and increased risk of SRE associated with disease progression. Results of the PSA showed that based on willingness-to-pay thresholds of $70,000, $50,000, and $30,000 per SRE avoided, respectively, denosumab was cost-effective compared with zoledronic acid in 49.5%, 17.5%, and 0.3% of the cases at 1 year, respectively, and 79.0%, 49.8%, and 4.1% of the cases at 3 years, respectively.  Conclusions:   Although denosumab has demonstrated benefits over zoledronic acid in preventing or delaying SREs in a Phase 3 trial, it may be a costly alternative to zoledronic acid from a U.S. payer perspective.""","""['Jipan Xie', 'Madhav Namjoshi', 'Eric Q Wu', 'Kejal Parikh', 'Melissa Diener', 'Andrew P Yu', 'Amy Guo', 'Kenneth W Culver']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Manag Care Pharm""","""['Words of wisdom.

Although, it is target specific, it may still lead to damage to the nerve fibers around the prostate tumor. In this study, by directly exposing the co-cultures of prostate cancer cells, PC-3 and Schwann cell-Dorsal Root Ganglion neuron (SC-DRG) to cryo-shock and by exposing SC-DRG to cryo-shock conditioned media (CSCM) obtained from PC-3 cells, robust neuro-protective effects were observed. Since this neuro-protective effect originated from cryotherapy-treated PC-3 cells, the presence of putative factors secreted by PC-3 cells in the medium following cryo-shock was analyzed. Using human cytokine antibody array analysis, differential release of cytokines in CSCM was observed with induced release of cytokines involved in neuro-protection like IL-1α, MIP-4, MIP-5, Leptin, IL-15 and ICAM-1 with simultaneous inhibition of TNFRI and TNFRII that are implicated in killing of nerve cells. Further, using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time Of Flight (MALDI-TOF) sequencing, two proteins were identified namely, CypA (cyclophilin A) and NM23 (nonmetastatic protein 23) in the CSCM. CypA functions as a mediator of intracellular as well as extracellular neuro-protective mechanisms and NM23 has been implicated as a potential suppressor protein of tumor metastasis. Thus, this study revealed the presence of factors in CSCM that has the potential to protect normal neuronal cells and suppress metastasis.""","""['Seema Gupta', 'Mini Varghese', 'Mohammed M Shareef', 'Mansoor M Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2009""","""None""","""Mol Cell Pharmacol""","""['Activated eosinophils upregulate the metastasis suppressor molecule E-cadherin on prostate tumor cells.', 'In vitro modulation of tumor progression-associated properties of hormone refractory prostate carcinoma cell lines by cytokines.', 'A proteome study of secreted prostatic factors affecting osteoblastic activity: galectin-1 is involved in differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells.', 'Cooperation of liver cells in health and disease.', 'Novel findings from an animal tourniquet shock model.']"""
