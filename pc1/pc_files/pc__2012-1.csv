This study was performed to elucidate the mechanism of lipid metabolism disorder during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in terms of the association of interleukin-6 with sex steroids.  Methods:   Seventy-two patients with localized prostate cancer were prospectively studied based on their body-composition and blood samples before and after ADT for 6 months.  Results:   Before ADT, serum interleukin-6 levels were inversely correlated with serum total-testosterone (rs = -0.305, P = 0.009) and dihydrotestosterone (rs = -0.380, P = 0.006) concentrations, but not correlated with adrenal androgen or estradiol levels. Pretreatment interleukin-6 levels were positively correlated with %body fat (rs = 0.349, P = 0.003) and %visceral fat (rs = 0.384, P = 0.001). After ADT, %body fat increased (P < 0.001) and lean body mass decreased (P = 0.036). After ADT, in contrast to the pretreatment relationship, interleukin-6 levels were positively correlated with total-testosterone concentrations (rs = 0.343, P = 0.003), and were positively correlated also with levels of androstenedione (rs = 0.351, P = 0.002) and estoradiol (rs = 0.335, P = 0.004). Interleukin-6 levels were equivalent between before and after ADT (2.02 vs. 2.16 pg/ml, P = 0.205), but the positive correlation between interleukin-6 levels and %body or %visceral fat noted before ADT disappeared after ADT.  Conclusions:   Posttreatment interleukin-6 levels had a strong positive correlation with total-testosterone, androstenedione, and estradiol levels, suggesting that a regulation loop may emerge between these sex steroids and interleukin-6 during ADT. The altered association between interleukin-6 and sex steroids is possibly involved in ADT-related lipid metabolism disorder with unchanged interleukin-6 levels despite increased %body fat.""","""['Shuichi Komatsu', 'Noboru Hara', 'Fumio Ishizaki', 'Tsutomu Nishiyama', 'Itsuhiro Takizawa', 'Etsuko Isahaya', 'Takashi Kawasaki', 'Kota Takahashi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Deficiency in androgens and upregulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 are involved in high bone turnover in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Decrease in lean body mass in men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy: mechanism and biomarkers.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-1 is associated with regulation of the luteinizing hormone production in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for localized prostate cancer.', 'Increased risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Intra-prostatic androgen levels during various androgen-blockade regimens.', 'Multi-omics & pathway analysis identify potential roles for tumor N-acetyl aspartate accumulation in murine models of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Accumulation of Palmitoylcarnitine and Its Effect on Pro-Inflammatory Pathways and Calcium Influx in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate carcinogenesis with diabetes and androgen-deprivation-therapy-related diabetes: an update.']"""

However, its role in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a chemoresistant bile duct carcinoma with a poor prognosis, remains unclear. In this study we found that AIB1 protein was frequently overexpressed in human CCA specimens and CCA cell lines. Down-regulation of AIB1 induced the G2/M arrest and decreased the expression of mitosis-promoting factors including Cyclin A, Cyclin B, and Cdk1 through suppressing the Akt pathway, which resulted in inhibiting CCA cell proliferation. In addition, AIB1 enhanced the chemoresistance of CCA cells at least in part through up-regulating the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. AIB1 regulated the expression of Bcl-2 in CCA cells through activating the Akt pathway as well as suppressing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). AIB1 suppressed ROS by up-regulating antioxidants such as glutathione synthetase and glutathione peroxidase, which are targets of the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a critical transcription factor that regulates antioxidants, detoxification enzymes, and drug efflux proteins. AIB1 also increased the expression of another two Nrf2 targets, ABCC2 and ABCG2, to enhance drug efflux. AIB1 served as an essential coactivator for Nrf2 activation by physically interacting with Nrf2 to enhance its transcriptional activity.  Conclusion:   AIB1 plays an important role in proliferation and chemoresistance of CCA through simultaneous activation of Akt and Nrf2 pathways, suggesting that AIB1 is a potential molecular target for CCA treatment.""","""['Qiang Chen', 'Wenjiao Li', 'Yunyan Wan', 'Xiaochun Xia', 'Qiao Wu', 'Yanling Chen', 'Zhide Lai', 'Chundong Yu', 'Wengang Li']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Hepatology""","""['Oncogenic activity of retinoic acid receptor γ is exhibited through activation of the Akt/NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin pathways in cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Nrf2 inhibition sensitizes cholangiocarcinoma cells to cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities of chemotherapeutic agents.', 'Cryptotanshinone induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt/NFκB pathways in cholangiocarcinoma cells.', 'Role of Nrf2 in cancer photodynamic therapy: regulation of human ABC transporter ABCG2.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signaling as an emerging potential key pharmacological target in cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Molecular Targets and Signaling Pathways in Cholangiocarcinoma: A Systematic Review.', 'Overcome Drug Resistance in Cholangiocarcinoma: New Insight Into Mechanisms and Refining the Preclinical Experiment Models.', 'SRC-3, a Steroid Receptor Coactivator: Implication in Cancer.', 'Upregulation of amplified in breast cancer 1 contributes to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression and vulnerability to blockage of hedgehog activation.', 'Non-esterified Fatty Acid Induce Dairy Cow Hepatocytes Apoptosis via the Mitochondria-Mediated ROS-JNK/ERK Signaling Pathway.']"""

However, few studies have focused on the comparative accuracy of these predictive tools. We aim to establish the predictive accuracy of three commonly used nomograms by comparing their prostate biopsy outcome predictions with actual pathological results.  Methods:   From January 2008 to December 2010, 708 consecutive patients with an elevated serum PSA level and/or abnormal DRE were referred to our institution. All data were collected prospectively. All patients underwent a TRUS 12-core biopsy. Probability of a positive biopsy was predicted using three online risk calculation nomograms. The discriminative ability of the nomograms was assessed via AUC and the most accurate model was calibrated and compared to actual biopsy results.  Results:   Of 667 patients fulfilling all three nomograms criteria, 384 (57.5%) had PCa and 283 (42.5%) did not. AUC for the PCPT-CRC, SWOP-PRI, and Montreal nomograms was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63-0.72), 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68-0.76), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.82), respectively. A comparison of the three models' performance showed that the Montreal model provided the greatest predictive accuracy (P = 0.03).  Conclusions:   External validation of three commonly used nomograms designed to predict the likelihood of a positive prostate biopsy reveals the Montreal model was more accurate than either the PCPT-CRC or SWOP-PRI models. The Montreal nomogram achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 79% and is superior to PSA alone though we await further research to define the probability (of cancer) threshold above which a prostate biopsy would be advised.""","""['Idir Ouzaid', 'David R Yates', 'Vincent Hupertan', 'Pierre Mozer', 'Emmanuel Chartier-Kastler', 'Alain Haertig', 'Marc-Olivier Bitker', 'Morgan Rouprêt']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Comparison of two on-line risk calculators versus the detection of circulating prostate cells for the detection of high risk prostate cancer at first biopsy..', 'Head-to-head comparison of two online nomograms for prostate biopsy outcome prediction.', 'Development, validation, and head-to-head comparison of logistic regression-based nomograms and artificial neural network models predicting prostate cancer on initial extended biopsy.', 'Prospective evaluation of prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density in the detection of nonpalpable and stage T1C carcinoma of the prostate.', 'The development of nomograms for stratification of men at risk of prostate cancer prior to prostate biopsy.', 'Prediction models for prostate cancer to be used in the primary care setting: a systematic review.', 'Defining the radiobiology of prostate cancer progression: An important question in translational prostate cancer research.', 'Prostate cancer nomograms: a review of their use in cancer detection and treatment.', 'Chinese nomogram to predict probability of positive initial prostate biopsy: a study in Taiwan region.']"""

These findings have prompted us to evaluate the effect of HMGA1 on developing androgen independency, which is associated with the progression of PCa.  Methods:   Expression of HMGA1 in PCa cells and mouse tissues was examined by Western blot. In order to examine the effect of HMGA1 on cell growth under androgen-deprived condition, we transfected HMGA1 into LNCaP cells, and siRNA into both DU145 and PC-3 cells, respectively.  Results:   Androgen-deprivation induced an increase in the level of HMGA1 in LNCaP cells in vitro and in vivo, but did not in normal prostate tissue. Overexpression of HMGA1 maintained the cell growth of LNCaP under androgen-deprived condition. Furthermore, knockdown of HMGA1 suppressed the cell growth of DU145 and PC-3.

Clonogenicity assays, cell cycle profiles, and expressions of p53, p21, BAX, survivin and cyclin B1 proteins were used to examine the effects of the treatments.  Results:   Quercetin synergistically inhibited the clonogenicity of the wild-type cells, but inhibited the cell cycle effects of all the drugs tested. In p53-null cells, the combination of low dose 5-FU with up to 6 μM quercetin promoted clonogenic survival. Treatment of p53-wild-type cells with 50 μM quercetin reduced drug-induced up-regulation of p53, p21 and BAX. The combination of quercetin and the drugs also reduced the levels of cyclin B1 and survivin proteins.

Utilization of small molecule inhibitors to treat bone metastatic PCa have had limited success either as monotherapies or in combination with other chemotherapeutics due to intolerable toxicities. In the current study, we developed a clinically relevant in vivo intraosseous tumor model overexpressing the platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGF D) to test the efficacy of a newly characterized vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)/PDGFR inhibitor, cediranib (also called AZD2171).  Methods:   An intratibial-injection model was established utilizing DU145 cells with or without increased PDGF D expression. Tumor-bearing mice were treated by daily gavage administration of cediranib and/or weekly i.p. injection of docetaxel for 7 weeks. Tibiae were monitored by in vivo/ex vivo X-rays and histomorphometry analysis was performed to estimate tumor volume and tumor-associated trabecular bone growth.  Results:   Cediranib reduced intraosseous growth of prostate tumors as well as tumor-associated bone responses. When compared to the standard chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel, cediranib exhibited a stronger inhibition of tumor-associated bone response. The efficacy of cediranib was further enhanced when the drug was co-administered with docetaxel. Importantly, the therapeutic benefits of cediranib and docetaxel are more prominent in intraosseous prostate tumors overexpressing PDGF D.

However, information on protein-changing mutations, genetic heterogeneity and genetic (in)stability is largely lacking for these cells.  Methods:   Next-generation sequencing of the LNCaP exome revealed many single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To help identify the mutations that are most likely drivers of the oncogenic process, we developed an in silico protocol, which can be adapted for other exome analyses.  Results:   We detected 1,802 non-synonymous SNVs and 218 small insertions and deletions in the LNCaP exome. We confirm the known mutations in the androgen receptor and the PTEN gene, but most other mutations remained undescribed until now. The presence of 38 out of 42 SNVs was confirmed in monoclonal as well as in polyclonal LNCaP derivatives. Moreover, most variants were also detectable in LNCaP mRNA.  Conclusions:   We provide an extensive database of genetic variations in the protein-coding part of the genome of LNCaP cells, which should be taken into consideration when using LNCaP cells or its derivatives as models for prostate cancer. From the analysis of several LNCaP-derived cultures and clones, we can confirm that the cell line is heterozygous for a large number of variants and that both the variant and the wild-type allele can be simultaneously expressed as mRNA.

Results:   IL-6 did not induce NED in LNCaP-S17 cells, even though IL-6 induced NED in LNCaP-C3 cells. IL-6 activated JAK2 and STAT3 pathways in LNCaP-C3 cells but not in LNCaP-S17 cells. IL-6 did not activate ERK1/2, AKT, or NF-κB pathways in either cell line.

The basal level of JAK2 expression was slightly higher in LNCaP-C3 cells than in LNCaP-S17 cells. Two suppressors of cytokine signaling, SOCS7 and cytokine-inducible SH2 protein (CIS), were expressed constitutively at higher levels in LNCaP-S17 cells than in LNCaP-C3 cells, while SOCS1 to SOCS6 were expressed at approximately the same levels. Using siRNA to knockdown SOCS7 and CIS expression in LNCaP-S17 cells led to increased phosphorylation of STAT3 upon IL-6 stimulation.

Little is known about allelic loss or gain pertaining to genes associated with the androgen synthesis axis and whether this is prognostic in patients who receive localized radiotherapy. In this hypothesis generating study, we conducted an array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis of 33 androgen synthesis genes to identify potential prognostic factors for radiotherapy outcome.  Methods:   aCGH analysis of tumor DNA prospectively derived from frozen needle biopsies of 126 men with intermediate-risk disease who underwent image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) to a mean dose of 76.4 Gy was conducted. Statistical analyses were conducted for allelic loss or gain in genes as potential prognostic factors relative to prostate specific antigen, Gleason-score, and T-category.  Results:   We observed that allelic losses of loci containing the genes StAR and HSD17B2 were associated with increased genetic instability (as determined by percentage genome alteration).

We recently showed that over-expression of tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1), a cell stress response protein, is a worse prognostic factor in PC, particularly predictive of biological cancer relapse. Moreover, treatment of castration-sensitive (CS) LNCaP tumor cells with a TP53INP1 antisense oligonucleotide (TP53INP1 ASO) inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate variations of TP53INP1 expression in PC during androgen withdrawal therapy and in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   Quantitative measurements of immunohistochemical expression of TP53INP1 using high-throughput densitometry, assessed on digitized microscopic tissue micro-array images were correlated with hormone therapy (HT) status in human PC. Northern blot analysis of TP53INP1 after castration was performed in LNCaP xenograft. Treatment of CR C4-2 tumor cells in vitro with TP53INP1 ASO was analyzed. We also analyzed the effect of TP53INP1 ASO treatment in vivo on tumor xenograft growth.  Results:   TP53INP1 protein expression decreases during HT and increases after HT in human CRPC. TP53INP1 mRNA increases significantly in CR tumors of LNCaP xenograft.

Using the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, which recruited 17,045 men aged between 40 and 69 years at study entry, we investigated associations between reported weight and body mass index (BMI) at age 18 and measured at study entry, height, weight change between age 18 and study entry and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression. During follow-up (mean = 15 years) of 16,514 men, we ascertained 1,374 incident prostate cancers of which 410 were classified as aggressive, and 139 deaths from prostate cancer. The incidence of all prostate cancer was not associated with body size or weight change. Weight and BMI at study entry were positively associated with aggressive prostate cancer risk (HR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.13 per 5 kg; HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.08-1.49 per 5 kg/m(2)) and prostate cancer mortality (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01-1.23 per 5 kg; HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.11-2.00 per 5 kg/m(2)). Weight gain was positively associated with prostate cancer mortality (HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02-1.26 per 5 kg increment); the HR for ≥ kg weight gain between age 18 and study entry compared to <5 kg gain over this period was 1.84, 95% CI: 1.09-3.09.

A role for PSA in the pathobiology for prostate cancer has not been firmly established. Experimental studies to date support a role for PSA through mechanisms such as release or processing of growth factors and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Exposure of prostate cancer cells to exogenous PSA also results in gene expression changes. These in vitro and biochemical assays rely on the use of commercially available PSA. Contamination of these commercial preparations can significantly impact the results of these in vitro studies.  Methods:   We characterized PSA and trypsin-like activity of PSA preparations obtained from three commercial sources: Calbiochem, Fitzgerald, and AbD Serotec. Silver stained gels were used to compare the purity of each preparation and mass spectrometry was performed to characterize contaminating proteases.  Results:   PSA activity varied between PSA preparations with AbD Serotec PSA having highest degree of activity. Significant trypsin-like activity, which was inhibited by aprotinin, was observed in PSA preparations from Calbiochem and Fitzgerald, but not AbD Serotec. These former two PSA preparations also contained the greatest degree of non-PSA contaminants by silver stain and mass spectrometry.

Here, we investigated the effect of AR overexpression on the dynamics of AR loading and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) recruitment to chromatin. Acetylation of histone 3 (AcH3) on lysines 9 and 14 (K9 and K14) was also studied.  Methods:   We used an LNCaP-based AR overexpression cell line model that includes a control line and two sublines, LNCaP-ARmo and LNCaP-ARhi, which overexpress AR twofold to threefold and fourfold to fivefold, respectively. Cells were exposed to 1 or 100 nM of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on the promoters and enhancers of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) genes was performed. qRT-PCR was used to measure the levels of PSA and TMPRSS2 transcripts.  Results:   Upon stimulation with 1 nM DHT, AR and RNA Pol II were recruited onto PSA and TMPRSS2 enhancer regions to a greater extent (P < 0.05) in AR-overexpressing cells compared to control cells. The difference in AR loading between the control and AR-overexpressing cells was abolished by a higher DHT concentration. The ratio of AcH3/H3 was increased in AR-overexpressing cells. The induction of transcription of PSA and TMPRSS2 occurred earlier in the AR-overexpressing cells.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that the levels of AR potentiate the recruitment of the AR, as well as components of the basic transcription machinery, to chromatin and affect the acetylation of histones in the presence of low levels of androgens.

Results:   For men with PSA measurements 2 years apart, the median annual percent change in serum PSA level was 4.83% and the 95th percentile was about 49.76%. The variability in estimated annual change decreased with increasing time between assessments, with a 95th percentile of 21.82% after 8 or more years between assessments. Although the median absolute change per year increased with increasing age, the median percent change per year was fairly consistent across age groups.

The purpose of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the German version of the Short-Form Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34-G).  Methods:   One thousand forty-seven participants with heterogeneous tumor entities were recruited in inpatient and outpatient cancer care facilities (female, 51%; median age, 57 years; breast cancer, 26%; prostate cancer, 22%). Concurrent and divergent validity of the SCNS-SF34-G was analyzed through associations with measures of distress, depression, anxiety, and social support.  Results:   Principal component analyses revealed five dimensions replicating the factorial structure of the original SCNS-SF34 (health system and information, psychological, physical and daily living, patient care and support, sexuality needs) explaining 68% of variance. Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.82 to 0.94. Convergent validity was supported by significant correlations between all SCNS-SF34-G subscales and psychosocial burden. Divergent validity was indicated by marginal correlations with social support. The SCNS-SF34-G was able to discriminate patient groups with respect to sex and age but not regarding tumor stage.  Conclusions:   The SCNS-SF34-G is an instrument with excellent psychometric properties for assessing supportive care needs among patients with various cancer entities.

Morphological effects are often identified in needle biopsy specimens, transurethral resectates, and radical prostatectomy specimens. A range of histological changes are noted in the non-neoplastic prostate tissue, as well as in the pre-neoplastic and carcinomatous areas. Other ablative therapies, such as cryotherapy, and emerging focal therapies, including high-intensity focused ultrasound, photodynamic therapy, and interstitial laser thermotherapy, may have morphological effects on prostate tissue. It is important for the pathologist to be aware of the spectrum of histological changes affecting the prostate gland post-therapy. The treatment effects may obscure residual carcinoma, and make measurements of tumour extent and stage difficult.

Modifications to the classification were recommended at a conference convened by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) in 2005. This modified classification has resulted in a significant upgrading of tumours, although some studies have shown a greater concordance between needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy scores when compared to classical Gleason (CG) grading. The ISUP consensus conference recommended that for needle biopsies higher tertiary patterns should be incorporated into the final Gleason score, and this has been correlated with biochemical failure, tumour volume and mortality. Recently the validity of including cribriform glands as a component of Gleason pattern 3 has been questioned and it has been recommended that all tumours showing cribriform architecture should be classified as Gleason pattern 4. The recommendations arising from the 2005 Consensus Conference were largely unsupported by validating data, yet this new grading system has achieved widespread usage. It is unfortunate that recent suggestions for further modification are similarly lacking in supporting evidence.

We examined these questions within the REDUCE study, where biopsies were largely independent of prostate specific antigen (PSA) minimizing screening biases.  Methods:   Data were from REDUCE, which tested dutasteride 0.5 mg daily for PCa risk reduction in men with PSA 2.5-10.0 ng mL(-1) and a negative prestudy biopsy. Among men undergoing at least one on-study biopsy with complete data (n = 6415; 78.1%), the association between family history and PCa risk was tested using multivariate logistic regression adjusting for clinicodemographic characteristics.  Results:   A family history of PCa alone was associated with increased PCa diagnosis (OR: 1.47, 95%CI: 1.22-1.77). In North America, PCa family history was not related to PCa diagnosis (OR: 1.02, 95%CI: 0.73-1.44), whereas outside North America, PCa family history was significantly related to diagnosis (OR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.38-2.15) (P-interaction = 0.01).

Ultimately, our observations may support the need for changes in how we address family history in terms of both risk of PCa diagnosis and general risk stratification.""","""['J-A Thomas nd', 'L Gerber', 'D M Moreira', 'R J Hamilton', 'L L Bañez', 'R Castro-Santamaria', 'G L Andriole', 'W B Isaacs', 'J Xu', 'S J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Intern Med""","""['Serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone and prostate cancer risk in the placebo arm of the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events trial.', 'Effect of dutasteride on prostate biopsy rates and the diagnosis of prostate cancer in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and enlarged prostates in the Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin trial.', 'Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism-Based Genetic Risk Score and Patient Age at Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Dutasteride: novel milestones in prostate cancer chemoprevention.', '5-α-Reductase inhibitors for prostate cancer chemoprevention: an updated Cochrane systematic review.', 'Family History of Prostate and Breast Cancer Integrated with a Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Men at Highest Risk of Dying from Prostate Cancer before Age 75 Years.', 'Role of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the HSD3B1 gene (rs6203 and rs33937873) in the prediction of prostate cancer risk.', 'Defining the Impact of Family History on Detection of High-grade Prostate Cancer in a Large Multi-institutional Cohort.', 'Family history of prostate cancer and prostate tumor aggressiveness in black and non-black men;results from an equal access biopsy study.', 'Assessing the clinical utility of genetic risk scores for targeted cancer screening.']"""

Moreover, we performed in vitro experiments to explore the tumor suppressor function of miR-1. Cell-based assays showed that miR-1 is epigenetically silenced in human prostate cancer. Overexpression of miR-1 in these cells led to growth inhibition and down-regulation of genes in pathways regulating cell cycle progression, mitosis, DNA replication/repair and actin dynamics. This observation was further corroborated with protein expression analysis and 3'-UTR-based reporter assays, indicating that genes in these pathways are either direct or indirect targets of miR-1. A gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the miR-1-mediated tumor suppressor effects are globally similar to those of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Lastly, we obtained preliminary evidence that miR-1 alters the cellular organization of F-actin and inhibits tumor cell invasion and filipodia formation.

The antitumor mechanism is presumably mediated in part by the expansion of tumor-specific T cells. Androgen deprivation, the cornerstone of treatment for patients with metastatic prostate cancer, has been shown to elicit prostate tissue apoptosis and lymphocytic inflammation. We hypothesized that treatment with androgen deprivation, followed by an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, could augment a tumor-specific immune response elicited by androgen deprivation. We report here the results of a phase I trial evaluating a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA-4, CP-675,206 (tremelimumab), in combination with androgen deprivation using an antiandrogen. Eligible patients were those with PSA-recurrent prostate cancer after primary surgery and/or radiation therapy, not previously treated with androgen deprivation, and without radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. Subjects were treated in two cycles, 3 months apart, in which they received bicalutamide 150 mg daily days 1-28 and tremelimumab on day 29. The primary endpoint of the trial was safety. Secondary endpoints included measures of PSA kinetics and identification of a maximum tolerated dose. Eleven patients were enrolled and completed at least 1 year of follow-up. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 diarrhea and skin rash. No favorable changes in PSA doubling time were observed in a period shortly after completing treatment; however, three patients experienced a prolongation in PSA doubling time detectable several months after completing treatment. The identification of delayed, prolonged favorable changes in serum PSA suggests that future studies could explore this combination in studies evaluating time to disease progression.""","""['Douglas G McNeel', 'Heath A Smith', 'Jens C Eickhoff', 'Joshua M Lang', 'Mary Jane Staab', 'George Wilding', 'Glenn Liu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Effect of Adding Docetaxel to Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer With Rising Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels After Primary Local Therapy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Dutasteride and bicalutamide in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer: the Therapy Assessed by Rising PSA (TARP) study rationale and design.', 'An open-label, phase 2 trial of bicalutamide dose escalation from 50 mg to 150 mg in men with CAB and castration resistance.

Clinical studies have shown that both PDGF receptor β (β-PDGFR) and its ligand PDGF D are up-regulated in primary prostate cancers and bone metastases, whereas PDGF B, a classic ligand for β-PDGFR, is not frequently detected in clinical samples. In this study, we examined the role of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in the regulation of PDGF expression levels using both a prostate-specific, conditional PTEN-knockout mouse model and mouse prostate epithelial cell lines established from these mice. We found an increase in PDGF D and β-PDGFR expression levels in PTEN-null tumor cells, accompanied by a decrease in PDGF B expression. Among Akt isoforms, increased Akt3 expression was most prominent in mouse PTEN-null cells, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activity was essential for the maintenance of increased PDGF D and β-PDGFR expression. In vitro deletion of PTEN resulted in a PDGF ligand switch from PDGF B to PDGF D in normal mouse prostate epithelial cells, further demonstrating that PTEN regulates this ligand switch. Similar associations between PTEN status and PDGF isoforms were noted in human prostate cancer cell lines. Taken together, these results suggest a mechanism by which loss of PTEN may promote prostate cancer progression via PDGF D/β-PDGFR signal transduction.""","""['M Katie Conley-LaComb', 'Wei Huang', 'Shihua Wang', 'Dongping Shi', 'Young Suk Jung', 'Abdo Najy', 'Rafael Fridman', 'R Daniel Bonfil', 'Michael L Cher', 'Yong Q Chen', 'Hyeong-Reh Choi Kim']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Differential tumorigenic potential and matriptase activation between PDGF B versus PDGF D in prostate cancer.', 'A critical role of the PTEN/PDGF signaling network for the regulation of radiosensitivity in adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) autocrine signaling regulates survival and mitogenic pathways in glioblastoma cells: evidence that the novel PDGF-C and PDGF-D ligands may play a role in the development of brain tumors.', 'Targeting the PDGF/PDGFR signaling pathway for cancer therapy: A review.', 'The PDGF family in renal fibrosis.', 'PDGFB-targeted functional MRI nanoswitch for activatable T1-T2 dual-modal ultra-sensitive diagnosis of cancer.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Identification of candidate miRNAs in early-onset and late-onset prostate cancer by network analysis.', 'Cancer stem cells in breast and prostate: Fact or fiction?', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cell Markers Drive Progression, Therapeutic Resistance, and Bone Metastasis.']"""

Therapeutic ratio was 3.64 times higher for this brachytherapy plan compared with an intensity-modulated radiation therapy plan. At followup at 1 year after brachytherapy, the symptoms had disappeared, tumor size had reduced with no fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation, and prostate-specific antigen level had decreased.

Objective:   Determine whether inherited variations in HSD17B genes are associated with PCa progression.  Design, setting, and participants:   We studied two independent Caucasian cohorts composed of 526 men with organ-confined PCa and 213 men with advanced disease who had a median follow-up of 7.4 yr and 7.8 yr after surgery, respectively.  Measurements:   Patients with localised PCa were genotyped for 88 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms in HSD17B type 1 (HSD17B1), type 2 (HSD17B2), type 3 (HSD17B3), type 4 (HSD17B4), type 5 (HSD17B5), and type 12 (HSD17B12), and their prognostic significance on disease progression was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models. Positive findings were then investigated in advanced disease.  Results and limitations:   After adjusting for known risk factors, 12 SNPs distributed across HSD17B2, HSD17B3, and HSD17B12 were significantly associated with risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in localised PCa (for variants in HSD17B2: hazard ratio [HR]: 1.92-2.93; p=0.025-0.004). In addition, four variants of HSD17B2 (rs1364287, rs2955162, rs1119933, rs9934209) were significantly associated with progression-free survival (HR: 2.96-4.69; p=0.004-0.00005) and overall survival in advanced disease (HR: 3.98-8.14; p=0.003-0.00002).

Method and materials:   Implanted fiducials (four gold markers) were used to determine interfractional translations, rotations, and dilations of the prostate. We used hybrid imaging: The markers were automatically detected in two pretreatment planar X-ray projections; their actual position in three-dimensional space was reconstructed from these images at first. The structure set comprising prostate, seminal vesicles, and adjacent rectum wall was transformed accordingly in 6 degrees of freedom. Shapes of IMRT segments were geometrically adapted in a class solution forward-planning approach, derived within seconds on-site and treated immediately. Intrafractional movements were followed in MV electronic portal images captured on the fly.  Results:   In 31 of 39 patients, for 833 of 1013 fractions (supine, flat couch, knee support, comfortably full bladder, empty rectum, no intraprostatic marker migrations >2 mm of more than one marker), the online aperture adaptation allowed safe reduction of margins clinical target volume-planning target volume (prostate) down to 5 mm when only interfractional corrections were applied: Dominant L-R rotations were found to be 5.3° (mean of means), standard deviation of means ±4.9°, maximum at 30.7°. Three-dimensional vector translations relative to skin markings were 9.3 ± 4.4 mm (maximum, 23.6 mm). Intrafractional movements in 7.7 ± 1.5 min (maximum, 15.1 min) between kV imaging and last beam's electronic portal images showed further L-R rotations of 2.5° ± 2.3° (maximum, 26.9°), and three-dimensional vector translations of 3.0 ±3.7 mm (maximum, 10.2 mm). Addressing intrafractional errors could further reduce margins to 3 mm.

Objective:   Assess temporal trends in the utilization and outcomes of MIRP and RRP among US Medicare beneficiaries from 2003 to 2007.  Design, setting, and participants:   A population-based retrospective study of 19 594 MIRP and 58 638 RRP procedures was performed from 2003 to 2007 from the 100% Medicare sample, composed of almost all US men ≥ 65 yr of age.  Intervention:   MIRP and RRP.  Measurements:   We measured 30-d outcomes (cardiac, respiratory, vascular, genitourinary, miscellaneous medical, miscellaneous surgical, wound complications, blood transfusions, and death), cystography utilization within 6 wk of surgery, and late complications (anastomotic stricture, ureteral complications, rectourethral fistulae, lymphocele, and corrective incontinence surgery).  Results and limitations:   From 2003 to 2007, MIRP increased from 4.9% to 44.5% of radical prostatectomies while RRP decreased from 89.4% to 52.9%. MIRP versus RRP subjects were younger (p<0.001) and had fewer comorbidities (p<0.001). Decreased MIRP genitourinary complications (6.2-4.1%; p = 0.002), miscellaneous surgical complications (4.7-3.7%; p=0.030), transfusions (3.5-2.2%; p=0.005), and postoperative cystography utilization (40.3-34.1%; p<0.001) were observed over time. Conversely, overall RRP perioperative complications increased (27.4-32.0%; p<0.001), including an increase in perioperative mortality (0.5-0.8%, p=0.009). Late RRP complications increased, with the exception of fewer anastomotic strictures (10.2-8.8%; p=0.002). In adjusted analyses, RRP versus MIRP was associated with increased 30-d mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55-4.59; p<0.001) and more perioperative (OR: 1.60; 95% CI, 1.45-1.76; p<0.001) and late complications (OR: 2.52; 95% CI, 2.20-2.89; p<0.001). Limitations include the inability to distinguish MIRP with versus without robotic assistance and also the lack of pathologic information.  Conclusions:   From 2003 to 2007, there were fewer MIRP transfusions, genitourinary complications, and miscellaneous surgical complications, whereas most RRP perioperative and late complications increased.

Methods and materials:   We treated 18 patients with LTAS with bicalutamide and goserelin in combination with bevacizumab and IMRT. Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered for the first 16 weeks, and 15 mg/kg was then given every 3 weeks for 12 additional weeks, with an IMRT dose of 77.9 Gy to the prostate, 64.6 Gy to the seminal vesicles, and 57 Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes. Patients were eligible if they had clinical stage T2b to T4, a Gleason sum score of 8 to 10, or a prostate- specific antigen level of 20ng/mL or greater. The primary endpoint of the study was evaluation of acute and late toxicities.  Results:   The median age was 69 years, with a median pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level of 12.5 ng/mL and Gleason score of 8. The pretreatment clinical stage was T1c in 4 patients, T2 in 11, and T3 in 3.

Adaptive image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) corrects for target position and volume variations, reducing the risk of biochemical failure while yielding acceptable rates of gastrointestinal (GI)/genitourinary (GU) toxicities.  Methods and materials:   Between 1998 and 2006, 962 patients were treated with computed tomography (CT)-based offline adaptive IGRT. Patients were stratified into low (n = 400) vs. intermediate/high (n = 562) National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk groups. Target motion was assessed with daily CT during the first week. Electronic portal imaging device (EPID) was used to measure daily setup error. Patient-specific confidence-limited planning target volumes (cl-PTV) were then constructed, reducing the standard PTV and compensating for geometric variation of the target and setup errors. Rectal volume (RV), cross-sectional area (CSA), and rectal volume from the seminal vesicles to the inferior prostate (SVP) were assessed on the planning CT. The impact of these volumetric parameters on 5-year biochemical control (BC) and chronic Grades ≥2 and 3 GU and GI toxicity were examined.  Results:   Median follow-up was 5.5 years. Median minimum dose covering cl-PTV was 75.6 Gy. Median values for RV, CSA, and SVP were 82.8 cm(3), 5.6 cm(2), and 53.3 cm(3), respectively. The 5-year BC was 89% for the entire group: 96% for low risk and 83% for intermediate/high risk (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences in BC were seen with stratification by RV, CSA, and SVP in quartiles. Maximum chronic Grades ≥2 and 3 GI toxicities were 21.2% and 2.9%, respectively. Respective values for GU toxicities were 15.5% and 4.3%. No differences in GI or GU toxicities were noted when patients were stratified by RV.  Conclusions:   Incorporation of adaptive IGRT reduces the risk of geometric miss and results in excellent biochemical control that is independent of rectal volume/distension while maintaining very low rates of chronic GI toxicity.""","""['Sean S Park', 'Di Yan', 'Samuel McGrath', 'Joshua T Dilworth', 'Jian Liang', 'Hong Ye', 'Daniel J Krauss', 'Alvaro A Martinez', 'Larry L Kestin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Inverse relationship between biochemical outcome and acute toxicity after image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'A dose-escalation trial with the adaptive radiotherapy process as a delivery system in localized prostate cancer: analysis of chronic toxicity.', 'Increased risk of biochemical and local failure in patients with distended rectum on the planning CT for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'A systematic review of organ motion and image-guided strategies in external beam radiotherapy for cervical cancer.', 'Clinical commissioning of an adaptive radiotherapy platform: Results and recommendations.', 'Prospects for daily online adaptive radiotherapy via ethos for prostate cancer patients without nodal involvement using unedited CBCT auto-segmentation.', 'The effect of rectal gas on dose distribution during prostate cancer treatment using full arc and partial arc Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) treatment plans.', 'Multiparametric prostate MRI-based intensity-modulated radiation therapy guided by prostatic calcifications.', 'Observed high incidence of prostatic calculi with the potential to act as natural fiducials for prostate image guided radiotherapy.']"""

Properly constrained blind matrix factorization methods extract those components using mixture samples only. However, automatic selection of extracted components to be retained for classification analysis remains an open issue.  Results:   The method proposed here is applied to well-studied protein and genomic datasets of ovarian, prostate and colon cancers to extract components for disease prediction. It achieves average sensitivities of: 96.2 (sd = 2.7%), 97.6% (sd = 2.8%) and 90.8% (sd = 5.5%) and average specificities of: 93.6% (sd = 4.1%), 99% (sd = 2.2%) and 79.4% (sd = 9.8%) in 100 independent two-fold cross-validations.  Conclusions:   We propose an additive mixture model of a sample for feature extraction using, in principle, sparseness constrained factorization on a sample-by-sample basis. As opposed to that, existing methods factorize complete dataset simultaneously. The sample model is composed of a reference sample representing control and/or case (disease) groups and a test sample. Each sample is decomposed into two or more components that are selected automatically (without using label information) as control specific, case specific and not differentially expressed (neutral). The number of components is determined by cross-validation. Automatic assignment of features (m/z ratios or genes) to particular component is based on thresholds estimated from each sample directly. Due to the locality of decomposition, the strength of the expression of each feature across the samples can vary. Yet, they will still be allocated to the related disease and/or control specific component. Since label information is not used in the selection process, case and control specific components can be used for classification. That is not the case with standard factorization methods. Moreover, the component selected by proposed method as disease specific can be interpreted as a sub-mode and retained for further analysis to identify potential biomarkers. As opposed to standard matrix factorization methods this can be achieved on a sample (experiment)-by-sample basis. Postulating one or more components with indifferent features enables their removal from disease and control specific components on a sample-by-sample basis. This yields selected components with reduced complexity and generally, it increases prediction accuracy.""","""['Ivica Kopriva', 'Marko Filipović']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['A combinational feature selection and ensemble neural network method for classification of gene expression data.', 'SamCluster: an integrated scheme for automatic discovery of sample classes using gene expression profile.', 'Classification between normal and tumor tissues based on the pair-wise gene expression ratio.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Functional genomics and proteomics in the clinical neurosciences: data mining and bioinformatics.', 'Decision support methods for finding phenotype--disorder associations in the bone dysplasia domain.']"""

In addition, the A(n)/T(n) (n = 5 or 7) overhangs act as protruding molecular arms that allow the siRNA molecule to enwrap the dendrimer and promote a better interaction and stronger binding, ultimately contributing toward the improved delivery activity of G(5).

Marrow stromal cells in the microenvironment support homing, lodging, and growth of MM cells through activation of multiple signaling pathways in both MM and stromal cells. Recently, we identified annexin II (AXII) as a previously unknown factor produced by stromal cells and osteoclasts (OCL) that is involved in OCL formation, HSC and prostate cancer (PCa) homing to the BM as well as mobilization of HSC and PCa cells. AXII expressed on stromal cells supports PCa cell lodgment via the AXII receptor (AXIIR) on PCa cells, but the role of AXII and AXIIR in MM is unknown. In this study, we show that MM cells express AXIIR, that stromal/osteoblast-derived AXII facilitates adhesion of MM cells to stromal cells via AXIIR, and OCL-derived AXII enhances MM cell growth. Finally, we demonstrate that AXII activates the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways in MM cells to enhance MM cell growth. These results demonstrate that AXII and AXIIR play important roles in MM and that targeting the AXII/AXIIR axis may be a novel therapeutic approach for MM.""","""[""Sonia D'Souza"", 'Noriyoshi Kurihara', 'Yusuke Shiozawa', 'Jeena Joseph', 'Russell Taichman', 'Deborah L Galson', 'G David Roodman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Blood""","""['Annexin II increases osteoclast formation by stimulating the proliferation of osteoclast precursors in human marrow cultures.', 'Cloning and identification of annexin II as an autocrine/paracrine factor that increases osteoclast formation and bone resorption.', 'CS1 promotes multiple myeloma cell adhesion, clonogenic growth, and tumorigenicity via c-maf-mediated interactions with bone marrow stromal cells.', 'Zoledronic acid exerts its antitumor effect in multiple myeloma interfering with the bone marrow microenvironment.', 'Migration, adhesion and differentiation of malignant plasma cells in the 5T murine model of myeloma.', 'Proteomic Alteration in the Progression of Multiple Myeloma: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Aptamers, a New Therapeutic Opportunity for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma.', 'Osteoblasts and osteoclasts: an important switch of tumour cell dormancy during bone metastasis.', 'Pathogenesis and Treatment of Myeloma-Related Bone Disease.', 'ANXA2P2: A Potential Immunological and Prognostic Signature in Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma via Pan-Carcinoma Synthesis.']"""

Recently, we found that non-steroidal phyto-chemical Compound A (CpdA) is AR/GR modulator acting as anti-inflammatory anti-androgen. CpdA inhibits AR and prevents GR transactivation while enhancing GR transrepression. GR and AR are controlled by proteasomal degradation. We found that prolonged exposure of LNCaP, LNCaP-GR, DU145 and PC3 prostate carcinoma (PCa) cells to proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (BZ) caused AR degradation and GR accumulation. BZ enhanced CpdA ability to inhibit AR and to augment GR transrepression. We also found that CpdA+BZ differentially regulated GR/AR to cooperatively suppress PCa cell growth and survival and to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Importantly, CpdA+BZ differentially regulated GR-responsive genes. CpdA+BZ blocked activation of glucocorticoid-responsive pro-survival genes, including SGK1, but activated BZ-induced ERS-related genes BIP/HSPA5 and CHOP /GADD153. Using ChIP, we showed that SGK1, BIP/HSPA5 and CHOP regulation was due to effects of CpdA and CpdA+BZ on GR loading on their promoters. We also found that AR and GR are abundant in advanced PCa from patients treated by androgen ablation and/or chemotherapy: 56% of carcinomas from treated patients expressed both receptors, and the other 27% expressed either GR or AR. Overall, our data validate the concept of dual AR/GR targeting in prostate cancer (PC) and suggest that BZ combination with dual-target steroid receptor modulator CpdA has high potential for PC therapy.""","""['Alexander Yemelyanov', 'Pankaj Bhalla', 'Ximing Yang', 'Andrey Ugolkov', 'Kenichi Iwadate', 'Apollon Karseladze', 'Irina Budunova']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Novel steroid receptor phyto-modulator compound a inhibits growth and survival of prostate cancer cells.', 'Compound A Inhibits Bladder Cancer Growth Predominantly via Glucocorticoid Receptor Transrepression.', 'Antitumor effect of non-steroid glucocorticoid receptor ligand CpdA on leukemia cell lines CEM and K562.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Is the glucocorticoid receptor a key player in prostate cancer?: A literature review.', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor and β-Catenin Interact in Prostate Cancer Cells and Their Co-Inhibition Attenuates Tumorsphere Formation, Stemness, and Docetaxel Resistance.', 'Antiproliferative Activity of Two Unusual Dimeric Flavonoids, Brachydin E and Brachydin F, Isolated from Fridericia platyphylla (Cham.)

Methods:   The study included 2 parts: 1) an analysis of existing nationwide SEER data; and 2) an evaluation of time and effort as reported by hospital registrars in the Metropolitan Atlanta and Rural Georgia (MARGA) SEER Registry catchment area. The first analysis examined all SSF for all types of cancers reported to the SEER Program between 2004 and 2007 from all 17 SEER registries. The data for the second analysis were limited to 5 cancer sites: breast, prostate, colon/rectum, testes, and lymphoma. Information for each cancer site was collected from 40 cancer registrars who were asked to estimate the amount of time and effort spent on abstracting each variable of interest.  Results:   We analyzed 825,952 cases pertaining to 18 different cancer sites and 45 different variables. Of the 45 SSF variables examined in this study, 12 had at least 50% of cases with missing data. Conversely, a total of 21 variables were at least 80% complete. Our analysis of determinants of missing SSF data showed an improvement of reporting since 2004 for most variables. Older patients (80+ years of age) tended to have a higher proportion of missing data compared to 40- to 59-year-olds (reference category). For the specific cancers presented in this paper, patients diagnosed in non-metropolitan areas tended to have a slightly higher proportion of missing data compared to those diagnosed in metropolitan areas. We found no discernable patterns of association between probability of having missing data and patients' race, sex, or registry. According to the registrars' reports, data collection for CS SSF requires a median of 2-3 minutes with a range of 1-15 minutes. There was great variability in the perceived level of difficulty associated with finding the necessarily data.  Conclusions:   The data completeness for CS SSF ranges widely, and is largely site- and variable-specific. The main barrier to data completeness appears to be the availability of information in the medical records. Our results indicate that for a number of SSF the proportion of missing data is so high that these variables can be of little, if any, use for population-based research. The practical implications of our findings with respect to existing and future SSF need to be explored.""","""['Hye Mi Kim', 'Michael Goodman', 'Brian I Kim', 'Kevin C Ward']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Registry Manag""","""[""Bias due to missing SEER data in D'Amico risk stratification of prostate cancer."", 'Prophylactic Oophorectomy: Reducing the U.S. Death Rate from Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.

They consist of a traditional NSAID to which an H(2)S-releasing moiety is covalently attached. We examined the effects of four different HS-NSAIDs on the growth properties of eleven different human cancer cell lines of six different tissue origins. Human colon, breast, pancreatic, prostate, lung, and leukemia cancer cell lines were treated with HS-aspirin, -sulindac, -iburofen, -naproxen, and their traditional counterparts. HS-NSAIDs inhibited the growth of all cancer cell lines studied, with potencies of 28- to >3000-fold greater than that of their traditional counterparts. HS-aspirin (HS-ASA) was consistently the most potent. HS-NSAIDs inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and caused G(0)/G(1) cell cycle block. Metabolism of HS-ASA by colon cells showed that the acetyl group of ASA was hydrolyzed rapidly, followed by hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the salicylate anion to the H(2)S releasing moiety, producing salicylic acid and ADT-OH from which H(2)S is released. In reconstitution studies, ASA and ADT-OH were individually less active than the intact HS-ASA towards cell growth inhibition. Additionally, the combination of these two components representing a fairly close approximation to the intact HS-ASA, was 95-fold less active than the intact HS-ASA for growth inhibition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HS-NSAIDs have potential anti-growth activity against a wide variety of human cancer cells.""","""['Mitali Chattopadhyay', 'Ravinder Kodela', 'Niharika Nath', 'Yosef M Dastagirzada', 'Carlos A Velázquez-Martínez', 'Daniel Boring', 'Khosrow Kashfi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Hydrogen sulfide-releasing aspirin suppresses NF-κB signaling in estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'NOSH-aspirin (NBS-1120), a novel nitric oxide- and hydrogen sulfide-releasing hybrid is a potent inhibitor of colon cancer cell growth in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model.', 'Nitric oxide-releasing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alter the kinetics of human colon cancer cell lines more effectively than traditional NSAIDs: implications for colon cancer chemoprevention.', 'Molecular targets of nitric-oxide-donating aspirin in cancer.', 'Novel agents for cancer prevention based on nitric oxide.', 'Codelivery of resveratrol melatonin utilizing pH responsive sericin based nanocarriers inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cell line at the different pH.', 'Hydrogen sulfide suppresses H2O2-induced proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Sulfur Metabolism of the Gut Microbiome and Colorectal Cancer: The Threat to the Younger Generation.', 'Implications of hydrogen sulfide in colorectal cancer: Mechanistic insights and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.', 'Hydrogen Sulfide and Its Donors: Keys to Unlock the Chains of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.']"""

We previously found peritumoral lymphatic vessel density (PTLD) in biopsy cores to be an independent predictor of lymphatic invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens, so we speculate that PTLD parameters in biopsy specimens could also be independent predictors of BCR after surgery.  Patients and methods:   We obtained positive biopsy cores from 110 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution. Biopsy cores were immunostained with the D2-40 monoclonal antibody, which specifically and selectively detects lymphatic endothelium. We evaluated differences between the BCR-free survival rates and used univariate and multivariate analyses to detect independent predictors of BCR.  Results:   The results of a Cox proportional hazards model showed that lymphatic invasion in prostatectomy specimens was one of the independent postoperative prognostic factors for BCR (p = 0.0338). An additional model showed that one PTLD parameter, maximal PTLD, was among the independent preoperative predictors of lower BCR-free survival rates (p = 0.0200).

This study examined the relationship of caregiving for a partner with PC with diurnal cortisol output in women between the ages of 42 and 75 years old. Participants were women whose partners had PC (n = 19) and women who were in relationships with men with no diagnosed medical illness (n = 26). Women provided saliva samples (4 times per day over 3 days) in their natural environment. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders was also conducted to assess for the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression. Partners of men with PC had lower daily cortisol output across the three days than controls, F(1,444.08) = 20.72, p<.001). They were also more likely to report PTSD symptoms with 68.4% of PC partners fulfilling criteria for sub-threshold PTSD as compared to 23.1% of controls (χ(2) = 11.30, p = .01). Mixed model analyses revealed that the presence of sub-threshold PTSD symptoms significantly predicted cortisol production, F(1,419.64) = 5.10, p<.01). Regardless of caregiver status, women who reported at least sub-threshold PTSD symptoms had lower cortisol production than those with no PTSD symptoms. Major depression did not explain differences in cortisol production between partners of PC patients and controls.

Objective:   To assess correlations between Prostate CAncer gene 3 (PCA3) levels and pathological features of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, which define cancer aggressiveness.  Patients and methods:   After digital rectal examination (DRE), first-catch urine was collected from 160 patients with localized prostate cancer. The PCA3 score was calculated using the Gene Probe Progensa(™) assay. PCA3 scores were then correlated to the pathological features of the RP specimens.  Results:   PCA3 scores correlated significantly with tumour volume (r= 0.34, P < 0.01). A PCA3 score of >35 was an independent predictor in a multivariate analysis of a tumour volume >0.5 mL (odds ratio [OR] 2.7, P= 0.04). It was also an independent predictor of positive surgical margins (OR 2.4, P= 0.04). Receiver-operator characteristic curves indicated PCA3 as the most accurate predictor of positive margins (area under the curve [AUC] 0.62), in addition to a positive biopsy percentage (AUC 0.52).

The purpose of this study was to present the influence of using different optimization algorithms in 3D-CBRT planning on the treatment plan quality.  Materials and methods:   Treatment plans were calculated for 15 patients--three plans for each patient using: geometrical optimization (GO), inverse optimization (IO) and blind inverse optimization (BIO). For each patient, PTV and OAR volumes, number of needles and geometry of the implant were set equal. Differences between dose distributions were tracked using: D90, V100, V200, Dmax (for prostate); D10, Dmax (for urethra); D10, V100, Dmax (for rectum).  Results:   The analysis of mean values of D90 and V100 in the prostate showed that inverse algorithms gave the best results (mean D90 was 12.1% for BIO and 9.3% for IO better than for GO, mean V100 was 8.2% for BIO and 6.3% for IO better than for GO). From a clinical point of view, GO diminished the doses in the PTV and urethra in all analyzed parameters. The lowest mean doses in the rectum were achieved for plans optimized with IO and BIO (mean D10: 61.2% for GO, 58.1% for IO, 58.0% for BIO; mean Dmax: 92.8% for GO, 85.1% for IO, 83.6% for BIO).  Conclusions:   Application of the blind inverse optimization (BIO) algorithm led to clinically best dose parameters for PTV and the rectum.

The shapes of the dose-response curves indicate that the association between 25(OH)D and total and free testosterone is linear at lower levels of 25(OH)D (below approximately 75-85 nmol/l), reaching a plateau at higher levels. Unlike for 25(OH)D, we did not observe any seasonal variation of testosterone concentrations.

Of these, the group with an increased risk was selected, and the optimal value was determined by the maximal area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve within the selected group. The risk of CaP diagnosis was evaluated by Cox regression. The mean follow-up period was 8.3 yr. CaP was detected in 27 of the 6,651 subjects. CaP detection rate was increased according to age. The optimal PSA value to distinguish the risk of CaP was 2.0 ng/mL for 50- to 69-yr-olds. Patients with a baseline PSA level greater than the optimal value had a 27.78 fold increase in the prostate cancer risk.

The aim of this study was to clarify whether combined treatment with EMAP II and flutamide is more effective than monotherapy with regard to retardation of PC progression.  Materials and methods:   Antitumor effects of EMAP II (10 µg/kg b.w./d, s.c., 3d), or flutamide (10 mg/kg b.w./d, per os, 3d), or their combination were studied in CBA male mice bearing human androgen-dependent PC xenografts for 7 days. Androgen-dependent phenotype of the tumors was verified in preliminary castrated mice. The xenografts were weighed and underwent a histopathologic examination. The results were compared with those of non-treated mice.  Results:   EMAP II and flutamide used separately inhibited growth of the xenografts by 74% and 53% respectively. Both drugs caused destructive changes in malignant epithelial cells along with leukocyte infiltration of the tumor. Combined treatment inhibited tumor growth by 85%, and was more effective than monotherapy with regard to morphological changes.

Since its inception, the initiative has reviewed a wide range of topics and generated valuable data on the patterns of prostate cancer treatment and patient outcomes in the two geographical regions. The objectives of this 5th Joint Meeting were to provide an update on the current status of the J-CaP and CaPSURE databases, and also to discuss perspectives from a range of other Asian countries-Japan, China, Indonesia and Korea-on the use of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. The collaborators recognize that large databases, such as J-CaP and CaPSURE, provide valuable 'real-world' information, to complement data from clinical trials, which can help to advance the clinical management of prostate cancer patients worldwide. It is anticipated that in the near future, the Joint Initiative will expand globally to include patient registries from other countries so that best practice can be shared and regional differences in patients, treatments and outcomes can be explored.""","""['Hideyuki Akaza', 'Peter Carroll', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Shiro Hinotsu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Jpn J Clin Oncol""","""['Sixth joint meeting of J-CaP and CaPSURE--a multinational perspective on prostate cancer management and patient outcomes.', 'Seventh Joint Meeting of K-J-CaP and CaPSURE: extending the global initiative to improve prostate cancer management.', 'Trans-Pacific variation in outcomes for men treated with primary androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer.', 'The case for androgen deprivation as primary therapy for early stage disease: results from J-CaP and CaPSURE.', 'The contemporary management of prostate cancer in the United States: lessons from the cancer of the prostate strategic urologic research endeavor (CapSURE), a national disease registry.', 'The homogeneous and heterogeneous risk factors for the morbidity and prognosis of bone metastasis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer trends in Asia.', 'Ten-year outcomes of I¹²⁵ low-dose-rate brachytherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: a single-institution experience in Japan.', 'Age at diagnosis on prostate cancer survival undergoing androgen deprivation therapy as primary treatment in daily practice: results from Japanese observational cohort.', 'Asian trends in primary androgen depletion therapy on prostate cancer.']"""

Recently, its dietary intake has been shown to protect against breast cancer. Mushroom polysaccharides are known for their immunomodulating and antitumor properties; however, little is known regarding the properties of A. bisporus polysaccharides. Using size-exclusion chromatography to fractionate the crude extract of A. bisporus, two polysaccharide fractions (designated as ABP-1 and ABP-2) were obtained. The estimated molecular masses of ABP-1 and ABP-2 were 2,000 kDa and 40-70 kDa, respectively, and their sugar compositions consisted mainly of glucose, mannose, xylose, and fructose. Analysis of the effects of the polysaccharides on murine macrophages demonstrated that both fractions stimulated the production of nitric oxide, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Modulation of macrophage function by A. bisporus polysaccharides was mediated in part through activation of nuclear factor-κB with the production p50/105 heterodimers. Both ABP-1 and ABP-2 had the ability to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells but had little effect on the growth of human colon, prostate, gastric cancer, and murine Sarcoma 180 cells as assessed by a tetrazolium dye [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]-based assay. However, when murine Sarcoma 180 cells exposed to ABP-1 or ABP-2 were implanted subcutaneously into mice, a reduction in tumor growth was observed compared with that observed in control mice. Taken together, our data provide a molecular basis to explain in part the reported beneficial therapeutic effects of A. bisporus WBM intake and suggest that macrophages likely contribute to the antitumor effects of Agaricus polysaccharides.""","""['Sang Chul Jeong', 'Sundar Rao Koyyalamudi', 'Yong Tae Jeong', 'Chi Hyun Song', 'Gerald Pang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Med Food""","""['Polysaccharides from Agaricus bisporus and Agaricus brasiliensis show similarities in their structures and their immunomodulatory effects on human monocytic THP-1 cells.', 'Effects of mushroom-derived beta-glucan-rich polysaccharide extracts on nitric oxide production by bone marrow-derived macrophages and nuclear factor-kappaB transactivation in Caco-2 reporter cells: can effects be explained by structure?', 'Assessing the immunomodulatory potential of high-molecular-weight extracts from mushrooms; an assay based on THP-1 macrophages.', 'Antitumor polysaccharides from mushrooms: a review on the structural characteristics, antitumor mechanisms and immunomodulating activities.', 'Antitumor, Anti-Inflammatory and Antiallergic Effects of Agaricus blazei Mushroom Extract and the Related Medicinal Basidiomycetes Mushrooms, Hericium erinaceus and Grifola frondosa: A Review of Preclinical and Clinical Studies.', 'Focus and Insights into the Synthetic Biology-Mediated Chassis of Economically Important Fungi for the Production of High-Value Metabolites.', 'Macrofungi as a Nutraceutical Source: Promising Bioactive Compounds and Market Value.', 'Suppressor capacity of copper nanoparticles biosynthesized using Crocus sativus L. leaf aqueous extract on methadone-induced cell death in adrenal phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cell line.', 'Historical and current perspectives on therapeutic potential of higher basidiomycetes: an overview.', 'Effects of 4-week continuous ingestion of champignon extract on halitosis and body and fecal odor.']"""

Nonetheless, concerns have been raised regarding contamination of human vaccines as a possible source of introduction of XMRV and MLV into human populations. To address this possibility, we tested eight live attenuated human vaccines using generic PCR for XMRV and MLV sequences. Viral metagenomics using deep sequencing was also done to identify the possibility of other adventitious agents.  Results:   All eight live attenuated vaccines, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (SA-14-14-2), varicella (Varivax), measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR-II), measles (Attenuvax), rubella (Meruvax-II), rotavirus (Rotateq and Rotarix), and yellow fever virus were negative for XMRV and highly related MLV sequences. However, residual hamster DNA, but not RNA, containing novel endogenous gammaretrovirus sequences was detected in the JEV vaccine using PCR. Metagenomics analysis did not detect any adventitious viral sequences of public health concern. Intracisternal A particle sequences closest to those present in Syrian hamsters and not mice were also detected in the JEV SA-14-14-2 vaccine. Combined, these results are consistent with the production of the JEV vaccine in Syrian hamster cells.  Conclusions:   We found no evidence of XMRV and MLV in eight live attenuated human vaccines further supporting the safety of these vaccines. Our findings suggest that vaccines are an unlikely source of XMRV and MLV exposure in humans and are consistent with the mounting evidence on the absence of these viruses in humans.""","""['William M Switzer', 'Haoqiang Zheng', 'Graham Simmons', 'Yanchen Zhou', 'Shaohua Tang', 'Anupama Shankar', 'Beatrix Kapusinszky', 'Eric L Delwart', 'Walid Heneine']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Contamination of human DNA samples with mouse DNA can lead to false detection of XMRV-like sequences.', 'An endogenous murine leukemia viral genome contaminant in a commercial RT-PCR kit is amplified using standard primers for XMRV.', 'Lack of the detection of XMRV or polytropic MLV-related sequences in blood cells from HIV-1-infected patients in Spain.', 'Distribution of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) infection in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'Endogenous retroviruses as potential hazards for vaccines.', 'Downregulation of Hyaluronic acid-CD44 signaling pathway in cervical cancer cell by natural polyphenols Plumbagin, Pongapin and Karanjin.', 'Multiplexed Metagenomic Deep Sequencing To Analyze the Composition of High-Priority Pathogen Reagents.', 'Experimental therapies for yellow fever.', 'No evidence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus transmission by blood transfusion from infected rhesus macaques.', 'A multicenter blinded analysis indicates no association between chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis and either xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus or polytropic murine leukemia virus.']"""

Hypoxic niches can be occupied by cancer stem/progenitor-like cells that are associated with tumor progression and resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, it has not yet been fully elucidated how hypoxia influences the stem-like properties of prostate cancer cells. In this report, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU145. In comparison to normoxia (20% O(2)), 7% O(2) induced higher expressions of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, which were associated with upregulation of Oct3/4 and Nanog; 1% O(2) induced even greater levels of these factors. The upregulated NANOG mRNA expression in hypoxia was confirmed to be predominantly retrogene NANOGP8. Similar growth rates were observed for cells cultivated under hypoxic and normoxic conditions for 48 hours; however, the colony formation assay revealed that 48 hours of hypoxic pretreatment resulted in the formation of more colonies. Treatment with 1% O(2) also extended the G(0)/G(1) stage, resulting in more side population cells, and induced CD44 and ABCG2 expressions. Hypoxia also increased the number of cells positive for ABCG2 expression, which were predominantly found to be CD44(bright) cells. Correspondingly, the sorted CD44(bright) cells expressed higher levels of ABCG2, Oct3/4, and Nanog than CD44(dim) cells, and hypoxic pretreatment significantly increased the expressions of these factors. CD44(bright) cells under normoxia formed significantly more colonies and spheres compared with the CD44(dim) cells, and hypoxic pretreatment even increased this effect.

Statins are effective suppressors of cholesterol synthesis with a well-established risk-benefit ratio in cardiovascular disease prevention. Mechanistically, targeting HMGCR activity primarily influences cholesterol biosynthesis and prenylation of signaling proteins. Pravastatin is a hydrophilic statin that is selectively taken up by a sodium-independent organic anion transporter protein-1B1 (OATP1B1) exclusively expressed in liver. Simvastatin is a hydrophobic statin that enters cells by other mechanisms. Poorly-differentiated and well-differentiated cancer cell lines were selected from various tissues and examined for their response to these two statins. Simvastatin inhibited the growth of most tumor cell lines more effectively than pravastatin in a dose dependent manner. Poorly-differentiated cancer cells were generally more responsive to simvastatin than well-differentiated cancer cells, and the levels of HMGCR expression did not consistently correlate with response to statin treatment. Pravastatin had a significant effect on normal hepatocytes due to facilitated uptake and a lesser effect on prostate PC3 and colon Caco-2 cancer cells since the OATP1B1 mRNA and protein were only found in the normal liver and hepatocytes. The inhibition of cell growth was accompanied by distinct alterations in mitochondrial networks and dramatic changes in cellular morphology related to cofilin regulation and loss of p-caveolin. Both statins, hydrophilic pravastatin and hypdrophobic simvastatin caused redistribution of OATP1B1 and HMGCR to perinuclear sites. In conclusion, the specific chemical properties of different classes of statins dictate mechanistic properties which may be relevant when evaluating biological responses to statins.""","""['David G Menter', 'Victoria P Ramsauer', 'Sam Harirforoosh', 'Kanishka Chakraborty', 'Peiying Yang', 'Linda Hsi', 'Robert A Newman', 'Koyamangalath Krishnan']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Brain cholesterol synthesis in mice is affected by high dose of simvastatin but not of pravastatin.', '3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) induce hepatic expression of the phospholipid translocase mdr2 in rats.', 'Differential efficacy of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors on the cell cycle of prostate cancer cells.', 'Pharmacokinetic comparison of the potential over-the-counter statins simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin and pravastatin.', 'Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

In normal cells, loss of attachment to the ECM induces a specific type of apoptosis, termed anoikis. Resistance to anoikis in cancer cells promotes their survival in circulation and dispersion to distant anatomic sites, leading to tumor metastasis. The Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcription coactivator is a human oncogene and a key regulator of organ size. The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway phosphorylates and inhibits YAP. However, little is known about the signals that regulate the Hippo pathway. Here we report that through cytoskeleton reorganization, cell detachment activates the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2 and leads to YAP phosphorylation and inhibition. The detachment-induced YAP inactivation is required for anoikis in nontransformed cells, whereas in cancer cells with deregulation of the Hippo pathway, knockdown of YAP and TAZ restores anoikis. Furthermore, we provided evidence that Lats1/2 expression level is indeed significantly down-regulated in metastatic prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   A population-based random sample was drawn from the 20% Medicare claims files for August 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008. Participants had hospital and physician claims for radical prostatectomy and diagnostic codes for prostate cancer and reported undergoing either a robotic or open surgery. They received a mail survey that included self-ratings of problems with continence and sexual function a median of 14 months postoperatively.  Results:   Completed surveys were obtained from 685 (86%) of 797 eligible participants, and 406 and 220 patients reported having had robotic or open surgery, respectively.

In logistic regression models predicting the log odds of a moderate or big problem with postoperative continence and adjusting for age and educational level, robotic prostatectomy was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward greater problems with continence (odds ratio [OR] 1.41; 95% CI, 0.97 to 2.05). Robotic prostatectomy was not associated with greater problems with sexual function (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.49).

Genome-wide association studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are statistically associated with low- to moderate-level risks of diseases. There has been limited study of complementarity for these two assessment methods. We sought to compare cancer risk categorizations from FHRA and from Navigenics Personal Genome Screening (PGS). We compared FHRA with PGS for breast (22 females), prostate (22 males), and colon cancer (44 males and females) assessed by kappa (κ) statistic. We also assessed each participant's hereditary risk based on clinical criteria and/or gene-test results. Both FHRA and PGS placed 59%, 68% and 44% of participants into the same risk categories for breast, prostate, and colon cancer, respectively. Overall, however, there was little concordance in FHRA versus PGS for all three cancer risks (κ<0.2). FHRA assigned 22 with hereditary risk compared with PGS, which identified one as high risk (P<0.0001). We assessed nine with hereditary colorectal cancer risk, five with germline mutations, but none were classified as PGS high risk (P=0.0001). FHRA and PGS may be complementary tools for cancer risk assessment.

We compared the gene expression profile of PCa tissues to adjacent benign tissues of prostate using gene expression microarray. 1207 genes that were consistently different from adjacent benign tissues of prostate (paired t test, P<0.05) were selected as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among them, 652 DEGs were upregulated in PCa, whereas 555 DEGs were downregulated in PCa. In addition, two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with MS was performed to screen for candidate markers in the proteome of PCa and adjacent benign tissues of prostate. A total of 89 spots were significantly up-regulated (ratio≥2, P<0.01) in PCa samples, whereas 66 spots were down-regulated (ratio≤-2, P<0.01). Sixty gene products were identified among these spots. Moreover, 14 potential candidate markers, which were identified as differentially expressed molecules by both gene expression microarray and 2D-DIGE, were chosen for validation and analysis by ELISA. The serum levels of three proteins correlated well with the 2D-DIGE results. Furthermore, the increased serum level of Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase II (IMPDH2) was significantly associated with the clinicopathological features of the patients with PCa, suggesting its potential as a serological tumor marker.

Each patient's data were stored in two databases (personal information and clinical database) while samples of urine, blood and its derivatives, fresh material and formalin-processed tissue were stored in a correlated biobank. The proposed method for collecting fresh material was to take samples of the neoplastic tissue by carrying out targeted biopsies in the area indicated by the biopsy mapping as the site of the malignancy, under manual palpation to identify the neoplastic nodule. The site of sampling was marked by an injection of India ink. 55 patients agreed to participate in the study. In 43 cases biopsies were correct, with a mean of 48% of core involved by tumour (range, 10-90%). Overall the tumour detection rate was 78.2%. The protocol for collecting biological material and the new method for collecting fresh tissue reduce internal steps and staff involved, thereby reducing all those variables that cause heterogeneity of material and changes in its quality.

Patients who report having a usual site of care and usual provider are more likely to receive preventive services, but less is known about the influence of specific components of first-contact access (e.g., availability of appointments, advice by telephone) on preventive services receipt.  Objective:   To examine the relationship between number of first-contact access components and receipt of recommended preventive services.  Design:   Secondary survey data analysis.  Participants:   Five thousand five hundred and seven insured adults who had continuity with a usual primary care physician and participated in the 2003-2006 round of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Survey.  Main measures:   Using multivariable logistic regression, we calculated adjusted risk ratios, adjusted predicted probabilities and 95% confidence intervals for each preventive service.  Key results:   Experiencing more first-contact access components was significantly associated with a higher rate of receiving cholesterol tests, flu shots and prostate exams but not mammography. There was variation in the number of components needed (between two and seven) to achieve a significant difference.  Conclusions:   Having an increasing number of first-access components in a primary care office may improve preventive services receipt, and more components may be required for those services requiring greater provider contact (e.g., prostate exam) versus those that require less (e.g., mammography). In primary care redesign, the largest gains in preventive services receipt likely will come with redesign of multiple components simultaneously. While our study is a necessary step towards broadly understanding the relationship between first-contact access and preventive service receipt, other important questions remain. Certain components may drive greater improvements in the receipt of different services, and the effect of some of these components may depend on individual patient characteristics. Further research is critical for understanding redesign strategies that may optimize preventive service delivery.""","""['Nancy Pandhi', 'Jennifer E DeVoe', 'Jessica R Schumacher', 'Christie Bartels', 'Carolyn T Thorpe', 'Joshua M Thorpe', 'Maureen A Smith']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Gen Intern Med""","""['Cross-sectional study examining whether the extent of first-contact access to primary care differentially benefits those with certain personalities to receive preventive services.', 'Preventive service gains from first contact access in the primary care home.', 'Preventive care.', 'From concept to application: the impact of a community-wide intervention to improve the delivery of preventive services to children.', 'Receipt of Selected Preventive Health Services for Women and Men of Reproductive Age - United States, 2011-2013.', '""Patient centered care in medical disinformation era"" among patients attending tertiary care hospital: A cross sectional study.', 'Cross-sectional study examining whether the extent of first-contact access to primary care differentially benefits those with certain personalities to receive preventive services.', 'Patient-centered medical home implementation and use of preventive services: the role of practice socioeconomic context.']"""

Methods:   The growth inhibitory potential of salinomycin was studied in a panel of prostate cells. To get insights into the mechanism of action, a variety of assays such as gene expression and steroid profiling were performed in salinomycin-exposed prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Salinomycin inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells, but did not affect non-malignant prostate epithelial cells. Salinomycin impacted on prostate cancer stem cell functions as evidenced by reduced aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and the fraction of CD44(+) cells. Moreover, salinomycin reduced the expression of MYC, AR and ERG, induced oxidative stress as well as inhibited nuclear factor-κB activity and cell migration. Furthermore, profiling steroid metabolites revealed increased levels of oxidative stress-inducing steroids 7-ketocholesterol and aldosterone and decreased levels of antioxidative steroids progesterone and pregnenolone in salinomycin-exposed prostate cancer cells.

Twelve cycles of selection and counter-selection were done to obtain a panel of internalizing Apts, which can distinguish PCa cells from nonprostate and normal prostate cells. After Apt characterization, size minimization, and conjugation of the Apts with fluorescently labeled polymeric NPs, the NP-Apt conjugates exhibit PCa specificity and enhancement in cellular uptake when compared to nontargeted NPs lacking the internalizing Apts. Furthermore, when docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of PCa, was encapsulated within the NP-Apt, a significant improvement in cytotoxicity was achieved in targeted PCa cells. Rather than isolating high-affinity Apts as reported in previous selection processes, our selection strategy was designed to enrich cancer cell-specific internalizing Apts.

Methods:   Data were obtained from two migrant cohorts residing in the federal states of North Rhine Westphalia (n=34,393) and Saarland (n=18,619). Vital status was ascertained through local population registries. Causes of death were obtained from the federal statistical office or from local health authorities. Cancer incidence of the Saarland cohort was derived from the Saarland Cancer Registry using record linkage.  Results:   From 1990 to 2005 we observed 3360 deaths of which 28 were due to prostate cancer. In the Saarland cohort 35 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer during the respective period. Migrants had lower prostate cancer incidence (SIR 0.74 (95% CI: 0.52-1.03)) and mortality (SMR 0.57 (95% CI: 0.38-0.83)) compared to the German population. Multivariate analysis showed a strong age effect on incidence meaning young migrants (below age 60) were diagnosed significantly more often with prostate cancer compared to Germans of the same age. However, mortality did not show any effects.  Discussion:   Lower prostate cancer mortality and incidence among migrants may reflect an ongoing situation in the FSU. Additionally, longitudinal analysis did not reveal convergence of migrant prostate cancer to German rates as expected from lifestyle driven cancer sites.

However, only approximately 30% of men with suspicion of cancer have it confirmed on prostate biopsy, and not all of these need treatment. Detection of circulating tumor cells in localized prostate cancer has given variable results, but it could be a useful complementary screening tool to detect prostate cancer in men with abnormal screening tests before the evaluation with prostate biopsy. To evaluate the diagnostic yield of the detection of mCPC as a complementary PC screening test in a population fulfilling criteria for a prostate biopsy for suspicion of PC.  Methods:   A prospective screening study of consecutive patients aged 45-80 years presenting to the urologist for PC screening. Inclusion criteria were PSA >4.0 ng/ml, PSA velocity >0.35 ng/ml/year and/or DRE suspicious for cancer. Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria had blood taken for mCPC detection and then underwent 12-core transrectal prostate biopsy. Double immune-histochemical staining with anti-PSA and anti-P504S was used to detect mCPC. Both cytologist and pathologist were blinded to the results of the biopsy, mCPC results and clinical details. The diagnostic yield of the presence or absence of mCPC was evaluated; the prostate biopsy was classified as cancer or no -cancer.  Results:   228 men participated, with a mean age of 66.8 ± 8.8 years and a median serum PSA of 5.15 ng/ml. 28.6% of the biopsies were positive for PC, and mCPC were detected in 31.0%of all cases. Sensibility, specificity and negative predictive value were 86.2%, 90.8% and 94.3% respectively. The negative and positive like-lihood ratios were 9.36 and 0.15. In men with a PSA <4.0ngml, 13.3% had cancer detected on biopsy, with a sensibility and specificity for mCPC detection of 83.3% and 84.6% and negative predictive value of 97.1%. All the mCPC determinations were interpretable. There were 9 false negative cases, all with small low grade tumors.

Experimental design:   Lymphocytes were transduced with TRAIL lentivirus and the antitumor effect in presence and absence of EpCAMxCD3 was evaluated in vitro and in xenograft studies using epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive pancreatic and prostate cancer cells.

Cotransplantation of TRAIL-lymphocytes and tumor cells in mice or peritumoral injection of TRAIL-lymphocytes in larger xenografts retarded growth and induced apoptosis. Combination of TRAIL-lymphocytes with EpCAMxCD3 potentiated tumor eradication by enhancing antiapoptotic and antiproliferative signaling and by decreasing tumor vasculature.

Mortality after 7-10 years of follow-up has been reported previously. We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial.  Methods:   A total of 76 685 men, aged 55-74 years, were enrolled at 10 screening centers between November 1993 and July 2001 and randomly assigned to the intervention (organized screening of annual PSA testing for 6 years and annual DRE for 4 years; 38 340 men) and control (usual care, which sometimes included opportunistic screening; 38 345 men) arms. Screening was completed in October 2006. All incident prostate cancers and deaths from prostate cancer through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31, 2009, were ascertained. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated as the ratio of observed rates in the intervention and control arms, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of events. Poisson regression modeling was used to examine the interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality between trial arm and age, comorbidity status, and pretrial PSA testing. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Approximately 92% of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57% to 13 years. At 13 years, 4250 participants had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm. Cumulative incidence rates for prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 108.4 and 97.1 per 10 000 person-years, respectively, resulting in a relative increase of 12% in the intervention arm (RR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.17). After 13 years of follow-up, the cumulative mortality rates from prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 3.7 and 3.4 deaths per 10 000 person-years, respectively, resulting in a non-statistically significant difference between the two arms (RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.87 to 1.36). No statistically significant interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality were observed between trial arm and age (P(interaction) = .81), pretrial PSA testing (P(interaction) = .52), and comorbidity (P(interaction) = .68).

In this study, we determined whether Nod1 and Nod2 are involved in the innate immune responses of prostate epithelial cells.  Methods:   The expression of Nod1 and Nod2 was examined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. ELISA was performed to determine the production of cytokines/chemokines. Activation of NF-κB and MAPK was examined using western blot analysis.  Results:   The Nod1 gene was distinctly expressed in all tested cells including DU145, PC3, and TRAMP-C2 cells, whereas Nod2 expression was weak. Both Nod1 and Nod2 proteins were expressed in normal mouse prostate epithelia with difference of expression levels. Tri-DAP (Nod1 agonist), but not MDP (Nod2), increased the production of IL-8 (or KC) and IL-6 in prostate epithelial cells. Tri-DAP and MDP could upregulate the gene expression of COX-2 and activate NF-κB and MAPK. In addition, Tri-DAP and MDP synergized with TLR agonists to induce the production of IL-8/KC or IL-6 in PC3 and TRAMP-C2 cells. We finally showed that Nod1 and Nod2 were also expressed in a wide range of prostate lesions including prostate intraepithelial neoplasm (PIN), phyllodes-like tumor, and adenocarcinoma in TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate) mice, even though the expression level of Nod1 and Nod2 was different.

Although TGF-β is a tumor suppressor for normal epithelial and early-stage cancer cells, it may act paradoxically as a tumor promoter in more advanced cancers, although its effects are largely cell and context dependent. This study analyzed prostate cancer responses to TGF-β signaling in an isogenic model of androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2 and Smad3 were analyzed using immunoblotting. Proliferation and cell cycle responses to TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) were assessed using growth assays and flow cytometry for DNA content, as well as Western blot and immunoprecipitation of cell cycle proteins.  Results:   Both androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and castration-resistant (C4-2 and C4-2B) prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 that was robust in metastatic lines. Smad phosphorylation was completely abrogated with inhibition of ALK-5 kinase activity using the kinase inhibitor, SB-431542. Increased sensitivity to TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition was observed in C4-2 and C4-2B cells, as compared to LNCaP cells. This was paralleled with downregulation of Cyclin D and increased association of p15(Ink4b) or p27(Kip) with CDK's. Additionally, TGF-β1 inhibited motility and invasion of metastatic cell lines.  Conclusions:   TGF-β-mediated suppression of growth and motility is enhanced in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. Enhanced TGF-β1-induced Smad2 and -3 signaling in prostate cancer cells may correlate with tumor suppressive activity. Therefore, the direct effects of TGF-β1 on prostate cancer cells post-castration may be anti-tumorigenic and growth-suppressive.""","""['Fayth L Miles', 'Navpreet S Tung', 'Adam A Aguiar', 'Senem Kurtoglu', 'Robert A Sikes']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Transforming growth factor-beta1 activates interleukin-6 expression in prostate cancer cells through the synergistic collaboration of the Smad2, p38-NF-kappaB, JNK, and Ras signaling pathways.', 'Overexpression of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1 type II receptor restores TGF-beta1 sensitivity and signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Apigenin inhibits TGF-β-induced VEGF expression in human prostate carcinoma cells via a Smad2/3- and Src-dependent mechanism.', 'Transforming growth factor-beta1 and prostate cancer.', 'Insensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of activin A: an acquired capability in prostate cancer progression.', 'Retinol dehydrogenase 10 promotes metastasis of glioma cells via the transforming growth factor-β/SMAD signaling pathway.', 'Bone microenvironment signaling of cancer stem cells as a therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Fatty Acids and Calcium Regulation in Prostate Cancer.', 'The miR-486-5p plays a causative role in prostate cancer through negative regulation of multiple tumor suppressor pathways.', 'Transforming growth factor-β: A therapeutic target for cancer.']"""

We performed a cell-based high-throughput screen with a compound library of 2000 bioactives for novel SAC inhibitors and discovered a plant-derived phenolic compound eupatorin (3',5-dihydroxy-4',6,7-trimethoxyflavone) as an anti-mitotic flavonoid. The premature override of the microtubule drug-imposed mitotic arrest by eupatorin is dependent on microtubule-kinetochore attachments but not interkinetochore tension. Aurora B kinase activity, which is essential for maintenance of normal SAC signaling, is diminished by eupatorin in cells and in vitro providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed forced mitotic exit. Eupatorin likely has additional targets since eupatorin treatment of pre-mitotic cells causes spindle anomalies triggering a transient M phase delay followed by impaired cytokinesis and polyploidy. Finally, eupatorin potently induces apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines and suppresses cancer cell proliferation in organotypic 3D cell culture model.""","""['Anna-Leena Salmela', 'Jeroen Pouwels', 'Anu Kukkonen-Macchi', 'Sinikka Waris', 'Pauliina Toivonen', 'Kimmo Jaakkola', 'Jenni Mäki-Jouppila', 'Lila Kallio', 'Marko J Kallio']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Novel pyrimidine-2,4-diamine derivative suppresses the cell viability and spindle assembly checkpoint activity by targeting Aurora kinases.', 'Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitor BI2536 causes mitotic catastrophe following activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint in non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'The small molecule Hesperadin reveals a role for Aurora B in correcting kinetochore-microtubule attachment and in maintaining the spindle assembly checkpoint.', 'Mitotic kinases: the key to duplication, segregation, and cytokinesis errors, chromosomal instability, and oncogenesis.', 'BubR1 kinase: protection against aneuploidy and premature aging.', 'Hesperetin Inhibits TGF-β1-Induced Migration and Invasion of Triple Negative Breast Cancer MDA-MB-231 Cells via Suppressing Fyn/Paxillin/RhoA Pathway.', 'Evaluation of apoptotic effects of mPEG-b-PLGA coated iron oxide nanoparticles as a eupatorin carrier on DU-145 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Eupatorin Suppressed Tumor Progression and Enhanced Immunity in a 4T1 Murine Breast Cancer Model.', 'Evaluation of antiproliferative and protective effects of Eupatorium cannabinum L. extracts.', 'Cytotoxicity of eupatorin in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells via cell cycle arrest, anti-angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis.']"""

The metastatic spread of PCa is responsible for most deaths related to PCa. Although KISS1 functions as a metastasis suppressor in various cancers, its expression levels and functions in PCa development and progression remain undetermined. The goals of this study were to correlate the expression levels of KISS1 in PCas with clinicopathologic characteristics and to assess the biological relevance of KISS1 to the viability and motility of PCa cells. Strong KISS1 staining was detected in benign prostate tissues, but the staining was weaker in primary and metastatic PCas (both P < 0.001, t-test). Furthermore, the low expression levels of KISS1 in PCas correlated with clinical stage (P < 0.01) and with KISS1R expression (P < 0.001). Overexpression of full-length KISS1 in low KISS1-expressing PC-3M cells, but not KFMΔSS, which lacks the secretion signal sequence, induced re-sensitization of cells to anoikis, although it had no effect on either cell proliferation or apoptosis. Overexpression of KISS1 also suppressed steps in the metastatic cascade, including motility and invasiveness. Moreover, cells overexpressing KISS1 were found to enhance chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. Collectively, our data suggest that KISS1 functions as a metastasis suppressor in PCas and may serve as a useful biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for aggressive PCas.""","""['Honghe Wang', 'Jacqueline Jones', 'Timothy Turner', 'Qinghua P He', 'Shana Hardy', 'William E Grizzle', 'Danny R Welch', 'Clayton Yates']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Expression of Kisspeptin (KISS1) and its Receptor GPR54 (KISS1R) in Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of KiSS1 as a Prognostic Biomarker in North Indian Breast Cancer Cases.', 'KISS1 Associates with Better Outcome via Inhibiting Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 in Colorectal Liver Metastasis.', 'KISS1 in breast cancer progression and autophagy.', 'Role of the tumor microenvironment in regulating the anti-metastatic effect of KISS1.', 'Restoration of miR-650 leads to down-regulation of KISS1, a possible route involved in overcoming 5-FU resistance and induction of apoptosis in CRC cells in-vitro.', 'KISS-1, Mediated by Promoter Methylation, Suppresses Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Metastasis via MMP2/9/MAPK Axis.', 'The designed NF-κB inhibitor, DHMEQ, inhibits KISS1R-mediated invasion and increases drug-sensitivity in mouse plasmacytoma SP2/0 cells.', 'A Review of the Pathophysiological Mechanisms Underlying Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Reduced Kiss‑1 expression is associated with clinical aggressive feature of gastric cancer patients and promotes migration and invasion in gastric cancer cells.']"""

In this study, we investigated the clinical outcome of MCP-1 expression in patients with prostate cancer (CaP) and the regulation of MCP-1 through angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R) in CaP. Specimens were obtained from 138 CaP patients and analyzed by immunostaining for both MCP-1 and macrophages. We investigated the regulation of MCP-1 expression through AT1R both in vivo and in vitro using three human prostate cancer cell lines: LNCaP, C4-2, and C4-2AT6. Specimens with a high Gleason score (≥7) and a high pathological classification (≤pT3), and those with castration-resistant prostate cancer showed significantly higher MCP-1 expression and higher macrophage infiltration than low malignant potential CaP. High MCP-1 expression in CaP correlated significantly with high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence rates. AngII induced significantly higher MCP-1 levels in C4-2AT6 than in LNCaP, whereas AT1R blockade (ARB) inhibited MCP-1 production via the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C4-2AT6. ARB also significantly suppressed MCP-1 expression in C4-2AT6 tumors.

Trade-offs between the potential benefits and downsides of screening must be weighed by men deciding whether to participate in prostate cancer screening; little is known about benefit:harm trade-offs men are willing to accept. Methods/Design The Community Preferences for Prostate Cancer Screening (COMPASs) Study examines Australian men's preferences for prostate cancer screening using PSA testing. The aims are to (1) determine which factors influence men's decision to participate in prostate cancer screening or not and (2) determine the extent of trade-offs between benefits and harms that men are willing to accept in making these decisions. Quantitative methods will be used to assess men's preferences for PSA screening. Using data on the quantitative outcomes of PSA testing from the published literature, a discrete choice study will be designed to quantitatively assess men's preferences. A web-based survey will be conducted in approximately 1000 community respondents aged 40-69 years, stratified by family history of prostate cancer, to assess men's preferences for PSA testing. A mixed logit model will be used; model results will be expressed as parameter estimates (β) and the odds of choosing screening over no screening. Trade-offs between attributes will also be calculated.

Although some reports are available on acute hypoxia-response in CaP cells aggressiveness, little is known about chronic hypoxia-response. We investigated the effects of chronic hypoxia on human CaP cells.  Materials and methods:   The human androgen-dependent CaP cell line LNCaP was cultured under normoxia (21% O2), acute hypoxia (1% O2), or chronic hypoxia (1% O2 for over 6 months). The cell growth, cell cycle and cell behavior of these cells were analyzed by cell count, flow cytometric analysis and in vitro cell migration and invasion assay, respectively. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases and intracellular signaling pathways were tested by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.  Results:   Chronic hypoxia-conditioned LNCaP cells grew in an androgen-independent manner with acceleration of G1 to S phase cell cycle progression. Chronic hypoxia, but not acute hypoxia, accelerated cell migration and invasion. The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-7, -9, -14, and -15 were significantly up-regulated in LNCaP cells under chronic hypoxia, but not under acute hypoxia. In addition, PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, and HIF-1 pathways were activated in chronic hypoxia-conditioned LNCaP cells.

Uptake, specificity and detection sensitivity of both lorglumide conjugates was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and magnetic resonance relaxometry. While the conjugate containing only lorglumide and rhodamine isothiocyanate as fluorescent dye showed clearly higher uptake than the bifunctional conjugate in FACS analysis, both conjugates clearly showed preferential staining of the PC3 prostate carcinoma cells. Magnetic resonance relaxometry experiments with the bifunctional conjugate containing the MRI contrast agent gadolinium-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid confirmed the higher PC3-affinity of the lorglumide ligand. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images of PC3/U2OS mixed cell cultures incubated with the bifunctional conjugate also clearly showed PC3 preference and cytoplasmic dot-like staining concurring with uptake by receptor binding and subsequent receptor internalization.

The prostatic and capsular arteries run along the lateral border of the prostate and could help identify the location of the CNs during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Objective:   Describe the visual cues that have helped us achieve consistent nerve sparing (NS) during RARP, placing special emphasis on the usefulness of the prostatic vasculature (PV).  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective video analysis of 133 consecutive patients who underwent RARP in a single institution between January and February 2011.  Surgical procedure:   NS was performed using a retrograde, antegrade, or combined approach.  Measurements:   A landmark artery (LA) was identified running on the lateral border of the prostate corresponding to either a prostatic or capsular artery. NS was classified as either medial or lateral to the LA. The area of residual nerve tissue on surgical specimens was measured to compare the amount of NS between the groups.  Results and limitations:   We could identify an LA in 73.3% (195 of 266) of the operated sides. The area of residual nerve tissue was significantly different whether the NS was performed medial (between the LA and the prostate) or lateral to the LA (between the LA and pelvic side wall): median (interquartile range) of 0 (0-3) mm2 versus14 (9-25) mm2; p<0.001, respectively.  Conclusions:   The PV is an identifiable landmark during NS.

Methods and materials:   Human lung, prostate, and breast normal and cancer cells were treated with 0 or 8 Gy IR and mRNA and protein levels of AMPK were evaluated by RT-PCR and immunoblotting 24 or 48 h later. Untreated and radiated wild type (WT) and AMPKα(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were analyzed by immunoblotting using total- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Histone H2Ax was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The cell cycle and survival of WT and AMPKα(-/-) MEFs was also evaluated following 8 Gy by IR.  Results:   AMPK subunits were found widely expressed in normal and cancer epithelial cells. IR increased subunit protein levels and stimulated gene transcription in cancer cells. AMPKα(-/-)-MEFs showed enhanced basal total levels of ATM and phosphorylation of its substrates histone H2Ax, but inhibited response of these markers and of checkpoint kinase Chk2 phosphorylation to IR. AMPKα(-/-)-MEFs showed increased basal levels of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(cip1), but lack of response of both genes to IR. These cells had increased basal levels and activation of the Akt-mTOR-p70(S6K)/4-EBP1 signalling pathway. IR increased Akt, p70(S6K) and 4-EBP1 phosphorylation in WT-MEFs, but this was reduced in AMPKα(-/-)-MEFs. AMPKα(-/-)-MEFs failed to arrest at the G2-M checkpoint after IR and showed a trend for radio-resistance in proliferation assays.  Conclusions:   AMPK is widely expressed in human normal and cancer epithelial cells and its gene transcription, protein levels, and enzymatic activity is stimulated by IR. Work with AMPKα knockout cells suggests that AMPK (i) may mediate a suppressive regulation on basal expression and activity of ATM and its downstream effector pathways Chk2/p53-p21(cip1) and Akt-mTOR, (ii) facilitates the normal response of these pathways to IR and, (iii) mediates the IR-induced G2-M checkpoint.""","""['Toran Sanli', 'Yaryna Storozhuk', 'Katja Linher-Melville', 'Robert G Bristow', 'Keith Laderout', 'Benoit Viollet', 'James Wright', 'Gurmit Singh', 'Theodoros Tsakiridis']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['AMPK regulates metabolism and survival in response to ionizing radiation.', 'Chronic modulation of AMP-Kinase, Akt and mTOR pathways by ionizing radiation in human lung cancer xenografts.', 'Induction of MET by ionizing radiation and its role in radioresistance and invasive growth of cancer.', 'Cell cycle regulation after exposure to ionizing radiation.', 'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) beyond metabolism: a novel genomic stress sensor participating in the DNA damage response pathway.', 'LTF Induces Radioresistance by Promoting Autophagy and Forms an AMPK/SP2/NEAT1/miR-214-5p Feedback Loop in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'AMPK phosphorylates NAMPT to regulate NAD+ homeostasis under ionizing radiation.', 'Adenosine Monophosphate Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) enhances chemotherapy response in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).', 'Phosphoproteomics Reveals the AMPK Substrate Network in Response to DNA Damage and Histone Acetylation.', 'miR-410 induces both epithelial-mesenchymal transition and radioresistance through activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

The use of these paradigms emphasizes the importance of smaller treatment margins to avoid high dose to surrounding normal tissue or organs at risk (OARs). However, tighter margins may lead to underdosage of the target due to the presence of organ motion. It is important to characterize organ motion and possibly account for it during treatment delivery. The need for real-time localization of dynamic targets has encouraged the use and development of more continuous motion monitoring systems such as kilo-voltage/fluoroscopic imaging, electromagnetic tracking, and optical monitoring systems.  Methods:   This paper presents the implementation of an algorithm to quantify translational and rotational interfractional and intrafractional prostate motion and compute the dosimetric effects of these motion patterns. The estimated delivered dose is compared with the static plan dose to evaluate the success of delivering the plan in the presence of prostate motion. The method is implemented on a commercial treatment planning system (Pinnacle(3), Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Philips Healthcare) and is termed delivered dose investigational tool (DiDIT). The DiDIT implementation in Pinnacle(3) is validated by comparisons with previously published results. Finally, different workflows are discussed with respect to the potential use of this tool in clinical treatment planning.  Results:   The DiDIT dose estimation process took approximately 5-20 min (depending on the number of fractions analyzed) on a Pinnacle(3) 9.100 research version running on a Dell M90 system (Dell, Inc., Round Rock, TX, USA) equipped with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor (Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The DiDIT implementation in Pinnacle(3) was found to be in agreement with previously published results, on the basis of the percent dose difference (PDD). This metric was also utilized to compare plan dose versus delivered dose, for prostate targets in three clinically acceptable treatment plans.  Conclusions:   This paper presents results from the implementation of an algorithm on a commercially available treatment planning system that quantifies the dosimetric effects of interfractional and intrafractional motion in external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) of prostate cancer. The implementation of this algorithm within a commercial treatment planning system such as Pinnacle(3) enables easy deployment in the existing clinical workflow. The results of the PDD tests validate the implementation of the DiDIT algorithm in Pinnacle(3), in comparison with previously published results.""","""['Shyam Bharat', 'Parag Parikh', 'Camille Noel', 'Michael Meltsner', 'Karl Bzdusek', 'Michael Kaus']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['The use of spatial dose gradients and probability density function to evaluate the effect of internal organ motion for prostate IMRT treatment planning.', 'Determination of action thresholds for electromagnetic tracking system-guided hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy using volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Evaluations of an adaptive planning technique incorporating dose feedback in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy: current status and issues of interest.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy: a new dimension in radiation oncology.', 'Effects on Periocular Tissues after Proton Beam Radiation Therapy for Intraocular Tumors.', 'A method of dose reconstruction for moving targets compatible with dynamic treatments.', 'Adaptive radiation therapy for postprostatectomy patients using real-time electromagnetic target motion tracking during external beam radiation therapy.']"""

Lung cancer treatments were initially excluded, because the original back-projection dose-reconstruction algorithm uses water-based scatter-correction kernels and therefore does not account for tissue inhomogeneities accurately. The aim of this study was to test a new method, in aqua vivo EPID dosimetry, for fast dose verification of lung cancer irradiations during actual patient treatment.  Methods:   The key feature of our method is the dose reconstruction in the patient from EPID images, obtained during the actual treatment, whereby the images have been converted to a situation as if the patient consisted entirely of water; hence, the method is termed in aqua vivo. This is done by multiplying the measured in vivo EPID image with the ratio of two digitally reconstructed transmission images for the unit-density and inhomogeneous tissue situation. For dose verification, a comparison is made with the calculated dose distribution with the inhomogeneity correction switched off. IMRT treatment verification is performed for each beam in 2D using a 2D γ evaluation, while for the verification of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatments in 3D a 3D γ evaluation is applied using the same parameters (3%, 3 mm). The method was tested using two inhomogeneous phantoms simulating a tumor in lung and measuring its sensitivity for patient positioning errors. Subsequently five IMRT and five VMAT clinical lung cancer treatments were investigated, using both the conventional back-projection algorithm and the in aqua vivo method. The verification results of the in aqua vivo method were statistically analyzed for 751 lung cancer patients treated with IMRT and 50 lung cancer patients treated with VMAT.  Results:   The improvements by applying the in aqua vivo approach are considerable. The percentage of γ values ≤1 increased on average from 66.2% to 93.1% and from 43.6% to 97.5% for the IMRT and VMAT cases, respectively. The corresponding mean γ value decreased from 0.99 to 0.43 for the IMRT cases and from 1.71 to 0.40 for the VMAT cases, which is similar to the accepted clinical values for the verification of IMRT treatments of prostate, rectum, and head-and-neck cancers. The deviation between the reconstructed and planned dose at the isocenter diminished on average from 5.3% to 0.5% for the VMAT patients and was almost the same, within 1%, for the IMRT cases. The in aqua vivo verification results for IMRT and VMAT treatments of a large group of patients had a mean γ of approximately 0.5, a percentage of γ values ≤1 larger than 89%, and a difference of the isocenter dose value less than 1%.  Conclusions:   With the in aqua vivo approach for the verification of lung cancer treatments (IMRT and VMAT), we can achieve results with the same accuracy as obtained during in vivo EPID dosimetry of sites without large inhomogeneities.""","""['Markus Wendling', 'Leah N McDermott', 'Anton Mans', 'Ígor Olaciregui-Ruiz', 'Raul Pecharromán-Gallego', 'Jan-Jakob Sonke', 'Joep Stroom', 'Marcel van Herk', 'Ben J Mijnheer']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Validation of a method for in vivo 3D dose reconstruction for IMRT and VMAT treatments using on-treatment EPID images and a model-based forward-calculation algorithm.', 'An in vivo dose verification method for SBRT-VMAT delivery using the EPID.', 'Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'A literature review of electronic portal imaging for radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'Dosimetric verification of IMRT and 3D conformal treatment delivery using EPID.', 'Clinical rationale for in vivo portal dosimetry in magnetic resonance guided online adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Extending in aqua portal dosimetry with dose inhomogeneity conversion maps for accurate patient dose reconstruction in external beam radiotherapy.', 'A feasibility study for in vivo treatment verification of IMRT using Monte Carlo dose calculation and deep learning-based modelling of EPID detector response.', 'A method for in vivo treatment verification of IMRT and VMAT based on electronic portal imaging device.', 'Evaluation of Daily CT for EPID-Based Transit In Vivo Dosimetry.']"""

Methods:   Men, 40-79 years old, attending public and private urology clinics in Kingston, Jamaica were recruited to a case-control study on the role of dietary and lifestyle factors on prostate cancer. Trained interviewers administered questionnaires and measured weight and height using standardized techniques. Blood samples for PSA were measured at a central laboratory using a micro-particle enzyme immunoassay method. Prostate biopsy was used to confirm prostate cancer. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the relationship between BMI and PSA separately in the cases and controls.  Results:   Data from 501 men (233 cases and 263 controls) were assessed. Thirty-five per cent of subjects were overweight and 13% were obese. Among cases, the median PSA was 35.3 ng/dL in normal weight, 26.1 ng/dL in overweight and 14.5 ng/dL in obese men (p = 0.02). For controls, median PSA was 2.0 ng/dL in normal weight, 1.3 ng/dL in overweight and 1.1ng/dl in obese men (p = 0.01). Among cases, BMI was negatively associated with PSA (B(SE) per 5 kg/m2 (BMI difference = -0.51 (0.13); p < 0.01) and remained significant after adjustment for age, sexual activity, smoking, use of statins and tumour grade. For controls, the BMI was also inversely related to the PSA (B(SE) per 5 kg/m2 difference -0.17 (0.07)) but the effect became of borderline significance after adjusting for age.  Conclusions:   Prostate specific antigen was inversely related to body mass index in Jamaican men with prostate cancer.

Although lipids have been implicated in several aspects of invadopodia formation, the contributions of de novo fatty acid synthesis and lipogenesis have not been defined. Inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), the committed step of fatty acid synthesis, reduced invadopodia formation in Src-transformed 3T3 (3T3-Src) cells, and also decreased the ability to degrade gelatin. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis through AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation and ACC phosphorylation also decreased invadopodia incidence. The addition of exogenous 16∶0 and 18∶1 fatty acid, products of de novo fatty acid synthesis, restored invadopodia and gelatin degradation to cells with decreased ACC1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of ACC also altered the phospholipid profile of 3T3-Src cells, with the majority of changes occurring in the phosphatidylcholine (PC) species. Exogenous supplementation with the most abundant PC species, 34∶1 PC, restored invadopodia incidence, the ability to degrade gelatin and the ability to invade through matrigel to cells deficient in ACC1 activity. On the other hand, 30∶0 PC did not restore invadopodia and 36∶2 PC only restored invadopodia incidence and gelatin degradation, but not cellular invasion through matrigel. Pharmacological inhibition of ACC also reduced the ability of MDA-MB-231 breast, Snb19 glioblastoma, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells to invade through matrigel. Invasion of PC-3 cells through matrigel was also restored by 34∶1 PC supplementation.

Intragenic miRNAs account for ∼50% of mammalian miRNAs. Classic studies reported that they are usually coexpressed with host genes. Here, using genome-wide miRNA and gene expression profiles from five sample sets, we show that evolutionarily conserved ('old') intragenic miRNAs tend to be coexpressed with host genes, but non-conserved ('young') ones rarely do so. This result is robust: in all sample sets, the coexpression rate of young miRNAs is significantly lower than that of conserved ones even after controlling for abundance. As a result, although young miRNAs dominate in human genome, the majority of intragenic miRNAs that show coexpression with host genes are phylogenetically old ones. For younger miRNAs, extrapolation of their expression profiles from those of their host genes should be treated with caution. We propose a model to explain this phenomenon in which the majority of young miRNAs are unlikely to be coexpressed with host genes; however, for some fraction of young miRNAs coexpression with their host genes, initially imbued by chromatin level effects, is advantageous and these are the ones likely to embed into the system and evolve ever higher levels of coexpression, possibly by evolving piggybacking mechanisms.""","""['Chunjiang He', 'Zejuan Li', 'Ping Chen', 'Hao Huang', 'Laurence D Hurst', 'Jianjun Chen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Host gene constraints and genomic context impact the expression and evolution of human microRNAs.', ""A potential role for intragenic miRNAs on their hosts' interactome."", 'Intragenic MicroRNAs Autoregulate Their Host Genes in Both Direct and Indirect Ways-A Cross-Species Analysis.', 'Interplay between miRNAs and host genes and their role in cancer.', 'miRNAs associated with immune response in teleost fish.', 'Functional mapping of microRNA promoters with dCas9 fused to transcriptional regulators.', 'miR‑374c‑5p regulates PTTG1 and inhibits cell growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating epithelial‑mesenchymal transition.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis Reveals Common and Specific Relationships between Intragenic miRNAs and Their Host Genes.', 'Multifaceted Regulation of MicroRNA Biogenesis: Essential Roles and Functional Integration in Neuronal and Glial Development.', 'miRNA Clusters with Up-Regulated Expression in Colorectal Cancer.']"""

Laminin-binding glycans on α-DG expressed on cancer cells suppress tumor progression by attenuating tumor cell migration from the BM. However, mechanisms controlling laminin-binding glycan expression are not known. Here, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) library screening and identified Fer kinase, a non-receptor-type tyrosine kinase, as a key regulator of laminin-binding glycan expression. Fer overexpression decreased laminin-binding glycan expression, whereas siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Fer kinase increased glycan expression on breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Loss of Fer kinase function via siRNA or mutagenesis increased transcription levels of glycosyltransferases, including protein O-mannosyltransferase 1, β3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1, and like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that are required to synthesize laminin-binding glycans. Consistently, inhibition of Fer expression decreased cell migration in the presence of laminin fragment. Fer kinase regulated STAT3 phosphorylation and consequent activation, whereas knockdown of STAT3 increased laminin-binding glycan expression on cancer cells.

Nevertheless, XMRV is a retrovirus of undefined pathogenic potential that is able to replicate in human cells. Here we describe a comprehensive analysis of two male pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) experimentally infected with XMRV. Following intravenous inoculation with >10(10) RNA copy equivalents of XMRV, viral replication was limited and transient, peaking at ≤2,200 viral RNA (vRNA) copies/ml plasma and becoming undetectable by 4 weeks postinfection, though viral DNA (vDNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells remained detectable through 119 days of follow-up. Similarly, vRNA was not detectable in lymph nodes by in situ hybridization despite detectable vDNA. Sequencing of cell-associated vDNA revealed extensive G-to-A hypermutation, suggestive of APOBEC-mediated viral restriction. Consistent with limited viral replication, we found transient upregulation of type I interferon responses that returned to baseline by 2 weeks postinfection, no detectable cellular immune responses, and limited or no spread to prostate tissue. Antibody responses, including neutralizing antibodies, however, were detectable by 2 weeks postinfection and maintained throughout the study. Both animals were healthy for the duration of follow-up. These findings indicate that XMRV replication and spread were limited in pigtailed macaques, predominantly by APOBEC-mediated hypermutation.

The discovery of more than two-dozen independent single-nucleotide polymorphism markers in prostate cancer has raised the possibility for such risk stratification. In this study, we evaluated the discriminative and predictive ability for prostate cancer risk models incorporating 25 common prostate cancer genetic markers, family history of prostate cancer, and age.  Methods:   We fit a series of risk models and estimated their performance in 7,509 prostate cancer cases and 7,652 controls within the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). We also calculated absolute risks based on SEER incidence data.  Results:   The best risk model (C-statistic = 0.642) included individual genetic markers and family history of prostate cancer. We observed a decreasing trend in discriminative ability with advancing age (P = 0.009), with highest accuracy in men younger than 60 years (C-statistic = 0.679). The absolute ten-year risk for 50-year-old men with a family history ranged from 1.6% (10th percentile of genetic risk) to 6.7% (90th percentile of genetic risk). For men without family history, the risk ranged from 0.8% (10th percentile) to 3.4% (90th percentile).  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that incorporating genetic information and family history in prostate cancer risk models can be particularly useful for identifying younger men that might benefit from prostate-specific antigen screening.  Impact:   Although adding genetic risk markers improves model performance, the clinical utility of these genetic risk models is limited.""","""['Sara Lindström', 'Fredrick R Schumacher', 'David Cox', 'Ruth C Travis', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Naomi E Allen', 'Gerald Andriole', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Heiner Boeing', 'H Bas Bueno-de-Mesquita', 'E David Crawford', 'W Ryan Diver', 'J Michael Gaziano', 'Graham G Giles', 'Edward Giovannucci', 'Carlos A Gonzalez', 'Brian Henderson', 'David J Hunter', 'Mattias Johansson', 'Laurence N Kolonel', 'Jing Ma', 'Loïc Le Marchand', 'Valeria Pala', 'Meir Stampfer', 'Daniel O Stram', 'Michael J Thun', 'Anne Tjonneland', 'Dimitrios Trichopoulos', 'Jarmo Virtamo', 'Stephanie J Weinstein', 'Walter C Willett', 'Meredith Yeager', 'Richard B Hayes', 'Gianluca Severi', 'Christopher A Haiman', 'Stephen J Chanock', 'Peter Kraft']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Assessing the clinical role of genetic markers of early-onset prostate cancer among high-risk men enrolled in prostate cancer early detection.', 'Evaluation of multiple risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms versus prostate-specific antigen at baseline to predict prostate cancer in unscreened men.', 'Sequence variants of estrogen receptor beta and risk of prostate cancer in the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Polygenic Risk Scores in Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment and Screening.', 'CanRisk-Prostate: A Comprehensive, Externally Validated Risk Model for the Prediction of Future Prostate Cancer.', 'Germline Variants in DNA Damage Repair Genes and HOXB13 Among Black Patients With Early-Onset Prostate Cancer.', 'Genetic signature of differentiated thyroid carcinoma susceptibility: a machine learning approach.', 'Prediction of future risk of any and higher-grade prostate cancer based on the PLCO and SELECT trials.', 'TRIM21 Polymorphisms are associated with Susceptibility and Clinical Status of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients.']"""

A total of 1,638,910 new cancer cases and 577,190 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2012. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2004-2008), overall cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.6% per year in women. Over the past 10 years of available data (1999-2008), cancer death rates have declined by more than 1% per year in men and women of every racial/ethnic group with the exception of American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates have remained stable. The most rapid declines in death rates occurred among African American and Hispanic men (2.4% and 2.3% per year, respectively). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate), with lung cancer accounting for almost 40% of the total decline in men and breast cancer accounting for 34% of the total decline in women. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 1,024,400 deaths from cancer.

Methods:   Human PCa cell lines (LNCaP, 22RV1, DU145 and PC-3) were plated in serum-free suspension culture system allowed for tumorsphere forming. To evaluate the CSC characteristics of tumorspheres, the self-renewal, chemoresistance, tumorigenicity of the PCa tumorsphere cells, and the expression levels of stemness-related proteins in the PCa tumorsphere cells were assessed, comparing with the parental adherent cells.  Results:   Tumorsphere cells from PCa cell lines displayed enhanced self-renewal, chemoresistance and tumor-initiating capacity when compared with the adherent cells. Additionally, these cells overexpressed CSC marker CD44. Also, the tumorsphere cells expressed high levels of ""stemness"" genes Gli1, ABCG2 and Bmi-1.

Patients and methods:   A cohort of 307 patients with myotonic dystrophy identified from medical records of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, from January 1, l993, through May 28, 2010, was retrospectively analyzed. We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of specific cancers for patients with myotonic dystrophy compared with age- and sex-specific cancer incidences of the general population. Age-dependent cumulative risks were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   A total of 53 cancers were observed at a median age at diagnosis of 55 years. Patients with myotonic dystrophy had an increased risk of thyroid cancer (SIR, 5.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-12.93; P=.001) and choroidal melanoma (SIR, 27.54; 95% CI, 3.34-99.49; P<.001).

While often considered 'stop' signals for adherent cells, CXCR3-binding chemokines have recently been correlated positively with cancer progression though the molecular basis remains unclear.  Results:   Here, we examined the expression and function of two CXCR3 variants in human prostate cancer biopsies and cell lines. Globally, both CXCR3 mRNA and protein were elevated in localized and metastatic human cancer biopsies compared to normal. Additionally, CXCR3A mRNA level was upregulated while CXCR3B mRNA was downregulated in these prostate cancer specimens. In contrast to normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1), CXCR3A was up to half the receptor in the invasive and metastatic DU-145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells, but not in the localized LNCaP cells. Instead of inhibiting cell migration as in RWPE-1 cells, the CXCR3 ligands CXCL4/PF4 and CXCL10/IP10 promoted cell motility and invasiveness in both DU-145 and PC-3 cells via PLCβ3 and μ-calpain activation. CXCR3-mediated diminution of cell motility in RWPE-1 cells is likely a result of cAMP upregulation and m-calpain inhibition via CXCR3B signal transduction. Interestingly, overexpression of CXCR3B in DU-145 cells decreased cell movement and invasion.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that the aberrant expression of CXCR3A and down-regulation of CXCR3B may switch a progression ""stop"" to a ""go"" signal to promote prostate tumor metastasis via stimulating cell migration and invasion.""","""['Qian Wu', 'Rajiv Dhir', 'Alan Wells']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Potential role of CXCR3 in proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'Disparate roles of CXCR3A and CXCR3B in regulating progressive properties of colorectal cancer cells.', 'CXCR3A contributes to the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer cells.', 'CXCR3 in carcinoma progression.', 'CXCR3 ligands in disease and therapy.', 'Functional Analysis of CXCR3 Splicing Variants and Their Ligands Using NanoBiT-Based Molecular Interaction Assays.', 'Role of CXCL10 in Spinal Cord Injury.', 'The role of CXCR3 and its ligands in cancer.', 'Chemokine CXCL10 Modulates the Tumor Microenvironment of Fibrosis-Associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Evolution, Expression and Functional Analysis of CXCR3 in Neuronal and Cardiovascular Diseases: A Narrative Review.']"""

Consequently, a greater frequency of low-volume disease or no tumor has been found in radical prostatectomy specimen.  Aims:   In the present study authors analyzed patients classified as pT0 after radical prostatectomy at their center.  Methods:   1134 radical prostatectomies were evaluated retrospectively at the author's center between 1996 and 2010. If there was no evidence of prostate cancer in the specimen, patient was staged as pT0. Patients were divided into two groups: received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy or not.  Results:   Overall 32 (2.8%) patients were staged as pT0. The rate of pT0 staging was 9.3% and 1.2% in the hormonally treated group and non-hormonally treated group. False-positive prostate biopsy was found in 2 cases. The rate of pT0 staging was higher in patients with incidental prostate cancer, low Gleason score and enlarged prostate. Biochemical relapse was observed in 3 pT0 patients in the hormonally treated group, among them there was one clinical relapse. In non-hormonally treated group no recurrence was detected.  Conclusion:   The rate of pT0 staging was higher in the hormonally treated group. Because of biochemical and clinical relapse despite vanishing prostate cancer phenomenon, these cases are considered not to be true pT0.

Linkage studies have implicated chromosome 17q21-22 as a possible location of a prostate-cancer susceptibility gene.  Methods:   We screened more than 200 genes in the 17q21-22 region by sequencing germline DNA from 94 unrelated patients with prostate cancer from families selected for linkage to the candidate region. We tested family members, additional case subjects, and control subjects to characterize the frequency of the identified mutations.  Results:   Probands from four families were discovered to have a rare but recurrent mutation (G84E) in HOXB13 (rs138213197), a homeobox transcription factor gene that is important in prostate development. All 18 men with prostate cancer and available DNA in these four families carried the mutation. The carrier rate of the G84E mutation was increased by a factor of approximately 20 in 5083 unrelated subjects of European descent who had prostate cancer, with the mutation found in 72 subjects (1.4%), as compared with 1 in 1401 control subjects (0.1%) (P=8.5x10(-7)). The mutation was significantly more common in men with early-onset, familial prostate cancer (3.1%) than in those with late-onset, nonfamilial prostate cancer (0.6%) (P=2.0x10(-6)).  Conclusions:   The novel HOXB13 G84E variant is associated with a significantly increased risk of hereditary prostate cancer. Although the variant accounts for a small fraction of all prostate cancers, this finding has implications for prostate-cancer risk assessment and may provide new mechanistic insights into this common cancer.

The pathophysiology of anorectal toxicity remains unknown, but we speculate that rectal distensibility is impaired due to fibrosis. Our goal was to determine whether EBRT induces changes of rectal distensibility as measured by an electronic barostat and to explore whether anorectal complaints are related to specific changes of anorectal function.  Methods:   Thirty-two men, irradiated for localized prostate carcinoma, underwent barostat measurements, anorectal manometry, and completed a questionnaire prior to and 1 year after radiotherapy. The primary outcome measure was rectal distensibility in response to stepwise isobaric distensions. In addition, we assessed sensory thresholds, anal pressures, and anorectal complaints.  Key results:   External beam radiotherapy reduced maximal rectal capacity (227 ± 14 mL vs 277 ± 15 mL; P < 0.001), area under the pressure-volume curve (3212 ± 352 mL mmHg vs 3969 ± 413 mL mmHg; P < 0.005), and rectal compliance (15.7 ± 1.2 mL mmHg(-1) vs 17.6 ± 0.9 mL mmHg(-1) ; P = 0.12). Sensory pressure thresholds did not significantly change. Sixteen of the 32 patients (50%) had one or more anorectal complaints. Patients with urgency (n = 10) had a more reduced anal squeeze and maximum pressure (decrease 29 ± 11 mmHg vs 1 ± 7 mmHg; P < 0.05 and 31 ± 12 mmHg vs 2 ± 8 mmHg; P < 0.05 respectively) compared with patients without complaints, indicating a deteriorated external anal sphincter function.

We studied the functional effects of miR-34a on c-Myc transcriptional complexes in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Transfection of miR-34a into PC-3 cells strongly inhibited in vitro cell proliferation, cell invasion and promoted apoptosis. Transfection of miR-34a into PC-3 cells also significantly inhibited in vivo xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. miR-34a downregulated expression of c-Myc oncogene by targeting its 3' UTR as shown by luciferase reporter assays. miR-34a was found to repress RhoA, a regulator of cell migration and invasion, by suppressing c-Myc-Skp2-Miz1 transcriptional complex that activates RhoA. Overexpression of c-Myc reversed miR-34a suppression of RhoA expression, suggesting that miR-34a inhibits invasion by suppressing RhoA through c-Myc. miR-34a was also found to repress c-Myc-pTEFB transcription elongation complex, indicating one of the mechanisms by which miR-34a has profound effects on cellular function. This is the first report to document that miR-34a suppresses assembly and function of the c-Myc-Skp2-Miz1 complex that activates RhoA and the c-Myc-pTEFB complex that elongates transcription of various genes, suggesting a novel role of miR-34a in the regulation of transcription by c-Myc complex.""","""['Soichiro Yamamura', 'Sharanjot Saini', 'Shahana Majid', 'Hiroshi Hirata', 'Koji Ueno', 'Guoren Deng', 'Rajvir Dahiya']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['MicroRNA-34a suppresses malignant transformation by targeting c-Myc transcriptional complexes in human renal cell carcinoma.', 'MicroRNA-34a Attenuates Paclitaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells via Direct Suppression of JAG1/Notch1 Axis.', 'MicroRNA-34a inhibits human trophoblast cell invasion by targeting MYC.', 'Molecular landscape of c-Myc signaling in prostate cancer: A roadmap to clinical translation.', 'Anti-tumor effects of miR-34a by regulating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Plasmatic MicroRNAs and Treatment Outcomes of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Hospital-Based Cohort Study and In Silico Analysis.', 'Next-generation poly-L-histidine formulations for miRNA mimic delivery.', 'MicroRNAs in T Cell-Immunotherapy.', 'MicroRNA-34a, Prostate Cancer Stem Cells, and Therapeutic Development.', 'Mir-34a: a regulatory hub with versatile functions that controls osteosarcoma networks.']"""

Potential association of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) in patients with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome has attracted broad interests in this topic. Although recent studies have indicated that XMRV is unlikely a human pathogen, further understanding of XMRV xenoinfection would allow in vivo modeling of the initial steps of gammaretroviral interspecies transmission, evolution and dissemination in a new host population. In this study, we monitored the long-term consequences of XMRV infection and its possible vertical transmission in a permissive foreign host, wild-derived Mus pahari mice. One year post-infection, XMRV-infected mice showed no notable pathological changes, while proviral DNA was detected in three out of eight mice. XMRV-infected mice remained seropositive throughout the study although the levels of gp70 Env- and p30 capsid-specific antibodies gradually decreased. When vertical XMRV transmission was assessed, no viremia, humoral immune responses nor endogenization were observed in nine offspring from infected mothers, yet one offspring was found PCR-positive for XMRV-specific sequences. Amplified viral sequences from the offspring showed several mutations, including one amino acid deletion in the receptor binding domain of Env SU.

Radiolabeled choline uptake within the imaging time is primarily a function of transport, phosphorylation, and oxidation. Rapid choline oxidation, however, complicates interpretation of PET data. In this study, we investigated the biologic basis of the oxidation of deuterated choline analogs and assessed their specificity in human tumor xenografts.  Experimental design:   (11)C-Choline, (11)C-methyl-[1,2-(2)H(4)]-choline ((11)C-D4-choline), and (18)F-D4-choline were synthesized to permit comparison. Biodistribution, metabolism, small-animal PET studies, and kinetic analysis of tracer uptake were carried out in human colon HCT116 xenograft-bearing mice.  Results:   Oxidation of choline analogs to betaine was highest with (11)C-choline, with reduced oxidation observed with (11)C-D4-choline and substantially reduced with (18)F-D4-choline, suggesting that both fluorination and deuteration were important for tracer metabolism. Although all tracers were converted intracellularly to labeled phosphocholine (specific signal), the higher rate constants for intracellular retention (K(i) and k(3)) of (11)C-choline and (11)C-D4-choline, compared with (18)F-D4-choline, were explained by the rapid conversion of the nonfluorinated tracers to betaine within HCT116 tumors. Imaging studies showed that the uptake of (18)F-D4-choline in three tumors with similar radiotracer delivery (K(1)) and choline kinase α expression-HCT116, A375, and PC3-M-were the same, suggesting that (18)F-D4-choline has utility for cancer detection irrespective of histologic type.

However, the magnitude of risk conferred in men living in West Africa is unknown.  Methods:   Here we determine the prevalence of 8q24 risk alleles and test for association with CaP risk alleles in West African (WA) descent populations from rural Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Caribbean island of Jamaica. Ten 8q24 SNPs were genotyped in histologically confirmed CaP cases (n = 308) and clinically evaluated controls (n = 469). In addition, unrelated individuals from Sierra Leone (n = 380) were genotyped for comparison of allele frequency comparisons.  Results:   SNPs rs6983561, rs7008482, and rs16901979 were significantly associated with CaP risk in WAs (P < 0.03). No associations with CaP were observed in our Caribbean samples. Risk alleles for rs6983267, rs7008482, and rs7000448 were highly prevalent (>84%) in West Africa. We also reveal that the A-risk allele for the 'African-specific' SNP bd11934905 was not observed in 1,886 chromosomes from three WA ethnic groups suggesting that this allele may not be common across West Africa, but is geographically restricted to specific ethnic group(s).  Conclusions:   We provide evidence of association of 8q24 SNPs with prostate cancer risk in men from Nigeria and Cameroon. Our study is the first to reveal genetic risk due to 8q24 variants (in particular, region 2) with CaP within two WA countries. Most importantly, in light of the disparate burden of CaP in African-Americans, our findings support the need for larger genetic studies in WA descent populations to validate and discern function of susceptibility loci in the 8q24 region.""","""['Adam B Murphy', 'Flora Ukoli', 'Vincent Freeman', 'Frankly Bennett', 'William Aiken', 'Trevor Tulloch', 'Kathleen Coard', 'Fru Angwafo', 'Rick A Kittles']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Region 2 of 8q24 is associated with the risk of aggressive prostate cancer in Caribbean men of African descent from Guadeloupe (French West Indies).', '8q24 risk alleles and prostate cancer in African-Barbadian men.', 'Chromosome 8q24 variants are associated with prostate cancer risk in a high risk population of African ancestry.', '8q24 rs4242382 polymorphism is a risk factor for prostate cancer among multi-ethnic populations: evidence from clinical detection in China and a meta-analysis.', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'Review of prostate cancer genomic studies in Africa.', 'Testing the generalizability of ancestry-specific polygenic risk scores to predict prostate cancer in sub-Saharan Africa.', 'Correlation between Genomic Variants and Worldwide Epidemiology of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics Research Disparities in Africa: Advancing Knowledge in Resource Constrained Settings.', 'Genetic Contributions to Prostate Cancer Disparities in Men of West African Descent.']"""

Prostate tumor cells that secrete and turn over excessive quantities of pericellular hyaluronan (HA) exhibit accelerated growth kinetics and spontaneous lymph node metastasis in mice. The HA receptor for endocytosis (HARE) is an endocytic clearance receptor for HA in the liver that is also highly expressed in sinusoidal endothelium of lymph nodes and bone marrow, which are frequent sites of prostate cancer metastasis. In our study, we tested the hypothesis that HARE can act as an endothelial receptor for metastatic tumor cells with pericellular HA. In an orthotopic mouse model of prostate cancer, we delivered a monoclonal antibody against HARE that specifically blocks HA binding and internalization. This treatment fully blocked the formation of metastatic tumors in lymph nodes. No effects on primary tumor growth were observed and the antibody did not induce toxic outcomes in any other tissue. Our results implicate HARE for the first time in potentiation of tumor metastasis and suggest a novel mechanism by which tumor cell-associated HA could promote tissue-specific dissemination.

In the final stage of the steroidogenic cascade, testosterone is metabolised to oestradiol by P450 aromatase, in the cytoplasm of adipocytes, breast cells, endothelial cells and prostate cells, to increase intracellular oestradiol concentration at the expense of testosterone. It follows therefore, that any compound that up-regulates aromatase, or any molecule that mimics oestrogen, will not only increase the activation of the mainly proliferative, classic ER-α, oestrogen receptors to induce adipogenesis and growth disorders in oestrogen-sensitive tissues, but also activate the recently identified transmembrane G protein-coupled oestrogen receptors (GPER), and deleteriously alter important intracellular signalling sequences, that promote mitogenic growth and endothelial damage. This paper simplifies how stress, xeno-oestrogens, poor dietary choices and reactive toxins up-regulate aromatase to increase intracellular oestradiol production; how oestradiol in combination with leptin and insulin cause insulin resistance and leptin resistance through aberrant serine phosphorylation; how the increased oestradiol, insulin and leptin stimulate rapid, non-genomic G protein-coupled phosphorylation cascades, to increase fat deposition and create the vasoconstrictive, dyslipidemic features of metabolic syndrome; how aberrant GPER signalling induces benign prostatic hypertrophy; and how increased intracellular oestradiol stimulates mitogenic change and tumour-cell activators, to cause prostate cancer. In essence, the up-regulation of aromatase produces increased intracellular oestradiol, increases ER-α activation and increases GPER activation, in combination with insulin, to cause aberrant downstream transduction signaling, and thus induce metabolic syndrome and mitogenic prostate growth. To understand this fact, that raised intracellular oestradiol levels in men, induce and promote obesity, gynecomastia, metabolic syndrome, type two diabetes, benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer, rather than low testosterone, represents a shift in medical thinking, a new awareness, that will reduce the rising incidence of obesity, metabolic syndrome and prostate disease, and significantly improve the health of men worldwide.""","""['Graeme Williams']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['The role of oestrogen in the pathogenesis of obesity, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer and prostate disease.', 'Sex steroid receptors in male human bladder: expression and biological function.', 'Oestrogens and prostate cancer.', 'G-Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER) and Sex-Specific Metabolic Homeostasis.', 'Obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes: sex differences and role of oestrogen receptors.', 'Lowering the percent body fat in the obese population might reduce male lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'Comparative G-Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER) Systems in Diabetic and Cancer Conditions: A Review.', 'Correlation of Visceral Obesity and Interleukin-6 Level on LUTS Due to Benign Prostatic Enlargement.', 'A Genome-Wide Association Study on Feed Efficiency Related Traits in Landrace Pigs.', 'Bisphenol A enhances adipogenic signaling pathways in human mesenchymal stem cells.']"""

ETS (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene) transcription factors are regulators of carcinogenesis. Protein levels of the archetypical ETS factor, ETS1, are increased in clinical and latent prostate cancer relative to benign prostatic hyperplasia and normal prostate to promote multiple cancer-associated processes, such as energy metabolism, matrix degradation, survival, angiogenesis, migration and invasion. Our studies have found that ETS1 expression is highest in high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason 7 and above). Increased ETS1 expression and transcriptional activity promotes an aggressive and castrate-resistant phenotype in immortalized prostate cancer cells. Elevated AKT (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog) activity was demonstrated to increase ETS1 protein levels specifically in castrate-resistant cells and exogenous ETS1 expression was sufficient to rescue invasive potential decreased by inhibition of AKT activity. Significantly, targeted androgen receptor activity altered ETS1 expression, which in turn altered the castrate-resistant phenotype. These data suggest a role for oncogenic ETS1 transcriptional activity in promoting aggressive prostate cancer and the castrate-resistant phenotype.""","""['A M Smith', 'V J Findlay', 'S G Bandurraga', 'E Kistner-Griffin', 'L S Spruill', 'A Liu', 'A R Golshayan', 'D P Turner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['ETS1 promotes chemoresistance and invasion of paclitaxel-resistant, hormone-refractory PC3 prostate cancer cells by up-regulating MDR1 and MMP9 expression.', 'N-cadherin increases after androgen deprivation and is associated with metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen levels increase by intratumoral de novo steroidogenesis during progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signalling axis in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Epiregulin expression and secretion is increased in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Ets1 mediates sorafenib resistance by regulating mitochondrial ROS pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Schlafen 11 expression in human acute leukemia cells with gain-of-function mutations in the interferon-JAK signaling pathway.', 'MED19 alters AR occupancy and gene expression in prostate cancer cells, driving MAOA expression and growth under low androgen.', 'Cordycepin Resensitizes T24R2 Cisplatin-Resistant Human Bladder Cancer Cells to Cisplatin by Inactivating Ets-1 Dependent MDR1 Transcription.']"""

These effects may lead to the disruption of major regulatory mechanisms, the onset of developmental disorders, and carcinogenesis. Especially, among diverse EDCs, xenoestrogens such as bisphenol A, dioxins, and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, have been shown to activate estrogen receptors (ERs) and to modulate cellular functions induced by ERs. Furthermore, they appear to be closely related with carcinogenicity in estrogen-dependant cancers, including breast, ovary, and prostate cancers. In in vivo animal models, prenatal exposure to xenoestrogens changed the development of the mouse reproductive organs and increased the susceptibility to further carcinogenic exposure and tumor occurence in adults. Unlike EDCs, which are chemically synthesized, several phytoestrogens such as genistein and resveratrol showed chemopreventive effects on specific cancers by contending with ER binding and regulating normal ER action in target tissues of mice. These results support the notion that a diet containing high levels of phytoestrogens can have protective effects on estrogen-related diseases. In spite of the diverse evidences of EDCs and phytoestrogens on causation and prevention of estrogen-dependant cancers provided in this article, there are still disputable questions about the dose-response effect of EDCs or chemopreventive potentials of phytoestrogens. As a wide range of EDCs including phytoestrogens have been remarkably increasing in the environment with the rapid growth in our industrial society and more closely affecting human and wildlife, the potential risks of EDCs in endocrine disruption and carcinogenesis are important issues and needed to be verified in detail.""","""['Min-Ah Park', 'Kyung-A Hwang', 'Kyung-Chul Choi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Lab Anim Res""","""['Impacts of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on prostate function and cancer.', 'Developmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals alters the epigenome: Identification of reprogrammed targets.', 'Endocrine disrupting chemicals targeting estrogen receptor signaling: identification and mechanisms of action.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals, Hormone Receptors, and Acne Vulgaris: A Connecting Hypothesis.', 'Interference of endocrine disrupting chemicals with aromatase CYP19 expression or activity, and consequences for reproduction of teleost fish.', ""In utero and postnatal exposure to Foeniculum vulgare and Linum\xa0usitatissimum\xa0seed extracts: modifications of key enzymes involved in epigenetic regulation and estrogen receptors expression in the offspring's ovaries of NMRI mice."", 'PI3K-AKT-Targeting Breast Cancer Treatments: Natural Products and Synthetic Compounds.', 'Role of Estradiol Hormone in Human Life and Electrochemical Aptasensing of 17β-Estradiol: A Review.', 'Rodent Model of Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapies as Specific Tool for Identifying Susceptibility and Vulnerability of Transgender People and Future Applications for Risk Assessment.', 'Development of a Human Estrogen Receptor Dimerization Assay for the Estrogenic Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals Using Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer.']"""

It is expressed in a wide range of tumor cells and is associated with tumor progression. The functions of galectin-3 are dependent on its localization and post-translational modifications such as cleavage and phosphorylation. Recently, we showed that galectin-3 Tyr-107 is phosphorylated by c-Abl; concomitantly, it was also shown that galectin-3 can be cleaved at this site by prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a chymotrypsin-like serine protease, after Tyr-107, resulting in loss of galectin-3 multivalency while preserving its carbohydrate binding activity. Galectin-3 is largely a monomer in solution but may form a homodimer by self-association through its carbohydrate recognition domain, whereas, in the presence of a ligand, galectin-3 polymerizes up to pentamers utilizing its N-terminal domain. Oligomerization is a unique feature of secreted galectin-3, which allows its function by forming ordered galectin-glycan structures, i.e. lattices, on the cell surface or through direct engagement of specific cell surface glycoconjugates by traditional ligand-receptor binding. We questioned whether Tyr-107 phosphorylation by c-Abl affects galectin-3 cleavage by PSA. The data suggest a role for galectin-3 in prostate cells associated with increased activity of c-Abl kinase and loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) activity. In addition, the ratio of phosphorylated/dephosphorylated galectin-3 might be used as a complementary value to that of PSA for prognosis of prostate cancer and a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Vitaly Balan', 'Pratima Nangia-Makker', 'Dhong Hyo Kho', 'Yi Wang', 'Avraham Raz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Galectin-3 is a substrate for prostate specific antigen (PSA) in human seminal plasma.', 'Galectin-3: A novel substrate for c-Abl kinase.', 'Cleavage and phosphorylation: important post-translational modifications of galectin-3.', 'Proteomic identification of galectin-3 binding ligands and characterization of galectin-3 proteolytic cleavage in human prostasomes.', 'Galectin-3 in angiogenesis and metastasis.', 'Gal-3 Protein Expression and Localization in Prostate Tumours.', 'Inhibition of galectins in cancer: Biological challenges for their clinical application.', 'Galectin-3 in prostate cancer and heart diseases: a biomarker for these two frightening pathologies?', 'Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 in B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.', 'Modified Citrus Pectin Treatment in Non-Metastatic Biochemically Relapsed Prostate Cancer: Results of a Prospective Phase II Study.']"""

Interindividual variation in estrogen metabolism may also influence the risk of breast cancer and could provide clues to mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis. Long-standing hypotheses about how estrogen metabolism might influence breast cancer have not been adequately evaluated in epidemiological studies because of the lack of accurate, reproducible, and high-throughput assays for estrogen metabolites.  Methods:   We conducted a prospective case-control study nested within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Participants included 277 women who developed invasive breast cancer (case subjects) and 423 matched control subjects; at PLCO baseline, all subjects were aged 55-74 years, postmenopausal and not using hormone therapy, and provided a blood sample. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure serum concentrations of 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites, in unconjugated and conjugated forms, including the parent estrogens, estrone and estradiol, and estrogen metabolites in pathways defined by irreversible hydroxylation at the C-2, C-4, or C-16 positions of the steroid ring. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) approximating risk in highest vs lowest deciles of individual estrogens and estrogen metabolites, estrogens and estrogen metabolites grouped by metabolic pathways, and metabolic pathway ratios using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Nearly all estrogens, estrogen metabolites, and metabolic pathway groups were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer; the serum concentration of unconjugated estradiol was strongly associated with the risk of breast cancer (HR = 2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 3.62). No estrogen, estrogen metabolite, or metabolic pathway group remained statistically significantly associated with the risk of breast cancer after adjusting for unconjugated estradiol. The ratio of the 2-hydroxylation pathway to parent estrogens (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.87) and the ratio of 4-hydroxylation pathway catechols to 4-hydroxylation pathway methylated catechols (HR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.72) were statistically significantly associated with the risk of breast cancer and remained so after adjustment for unconjugated estradiol.

Recently, N-terminal epitope-targeted mouse and a C-terminal epitope-targeted rabbit monoclonal anti-ERG antibody (ERG-MAbs) have been introduced for the detection of the ERG protein. Independent studies reported that immunohistochemistry (IHC) with both ERG-MAbs highly correlates with the underlying ERG gene rearrangement status. However, comparative studies of both antibodies are lacking. Here, we are among the first to compare the mouse ERG-MAb with the rabbit ERG-MAb for their concordance on the same PCa cohort. Furthermore, we assessed whether the ERG protein expression is conserved in lymph node and distant PCa metastases.  Methods:   We evaluated tissue microarrays of 278 specimens containing 265 localized PCa, 29 lymph node, 30 distant metastases and 13 normal prostatic tissues. We correlated ERG protein expression with ERG rearrangement status using an ERG break-apart fluorescence in-situ hybridization assay and IHC of both ERG-MAbs.  Results:   ERG expression and ERG rearrangement status were highly concordant regardless of whether the mouse or rabbit ERG-MAb was used (97.8% versus 98.6%, respectively). Of interest, both ERG antibodies reliably detected the ERG expression in lymph node and distant PCa metastases, of which a subset underwent decalcification. Lymphocytes only revealed immunoreactivity using the rabbit ERG-MAb. If ERG protein expression was present in localized PCa, we observed the same pattern in the corresponding lymph node metastases.  Conclusions:   By demonstrating a broad applicability of IHC to study ERG protein expression using either antibody, this study adds an important step toward a facilitated routine clinical application. Further, we demonstrate that the clonal nature of the ERG rearrangement is not restricted to the genomic level, but proceeds in the proteome.

The interfractional motion can be managed through either online or offline image guidance (IG). The position changes are commonly corrected through online IG by correcting couch position at each treatment fraction, while the shape and volume changes, or target deformation, can be compensated by margins in offline adaptive planning. In this study, we proposed and evaluated a rolling-average (RA) adaptive replanning method to account for the target volume variations. A total of 448 repeated helical computed tomography (HCT) scans from 28 patients were included in the study. Both low-risk patients (LRP, CTV = prostate) and intermediate-risk patients (IRP, CTV = prostate + seminal vesicles) were simulated. The benefit of RA strategy was evaluated geometrically and compared with the standard online IG-only method and a single replanning adaptive hybrid strategy. A new geometric index, cumulative index of target volume (CITV), was used for the evaluation. Two extreme scenarios of target volume changes, Type Ascending and Descending, were simulated by sorting the CTV volumes of actual patient data in order to have a better evaluation of the methods. Modest target volume variations were observed in our patient group. The prostate volume change was -0.14 ± 0.11 cc/day (or -0.30% ± 0.26% per day). It is found that RA is superior to the online IG and hybrid techniques. However, the magnitude of improvement depends on how significantly and rapidly the target volume changes. On the issue of planning complexity, the hybrid is more complex than online IG only, requiring one offline replanning, and RA is significantly more complex, with multiple replanning. In clinical implementation of RA, the effectiveness and efficiency should be balanced. The effectiveness is dependent on the patient population. For low-risk patients, RA is beneficial if there is significant time trend in target volume during the treatment course of radiotherapy. The optimal number of fractions necessary for the internal target volume (ITV) construction is 2 for LRP and 3 for IRP for RA strategy.""","""['Han Liu', 'Qiuwen Wu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric and geometric evaluation of a hybrid strategy of offline adaptive planning and online image guidance for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'A hybrid strategy of offline adaptive planning and online image guidance for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Evaluations of an adaptive planning technique incorporating dose feedback in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Adaptive Radiotherapy in the Management of Cervical Cancer: Review of Strategies and Clinical Implementation.', 'Practical and technical key challenges in head and neck adaptive radiotherapy: The GORTEC point of view.', 'Impact of Acquisition Protocols on Accuracy of Dose Calculation Based on XVI Cone Beam Computed Tomography.', 'What benefit could be derived from on-line adaptive prostate radiotherapy using rectal diameter as a predictor of motion?', 'A framework for deformable image registration validation in radiotherapy clinical applications.']"""

The high atomic number of the metallic hips not only gives rise to streak artifacts that obscure anatomy but also attenuates laterally directed fields by a significant amount that cannot be reliably ascertained from the CT dataset. A common approach to planning directs five IMRT fields such that incidence through the metal hips is avoided. While this technique generally gives adequate PTV coverage, it may escalate the rectal dose if beams, which would otherwise be incident from a lateral direction, are angled toward a posterior direction in order to avoid the prosthesis. In this work, we propose and investigate a new technique which alleviates this problem by introducing asymmetric opposed fields that are edge-matched along a plane that is tangent to the metal prostheses. With this approach, a posterior oblique field is oriented closer to the lateral direction but does not irradiate the ipsilateral prosthesis. The portion of the target eclipsed by the prosthesis is irradiated by the opposed matched anterior oblique field which, again, avoids the corresponding ipsilateral prosthesis. While the proposed technique may improve rectal sparing and PTV coverage, the dose along the match plane is sensitive to intrafraction motion. In the worse case of intrafraction motion perpendicular to the plane occurring in the time interval between the deliveries of successive fields of the opposed matched pair, the induced error is typically about 5 cGy per mm of target motion for a 200 cGy fraction. To reduce the induced error, several approaches to broadening the penumbra at the match plane were investigated and compared to conventional IMRT plans for three patients. Phantom measurements were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches. Match-plane shifts of 4 mm in a single step, in two 2 mm steps, and in four 1 mm steps, were effective in reducing the worse case induced error to 2.8 cGy per mm. Imposing match-plane shifts precludes the use of intensity modulation for the opposed matched field pairs. Therefore, we favor an approach whereby the opposed matched fields overlap by 4 mm. Since both fields contribute fluence to the overlap region, the worse case induced error was observed to be typically within 2.9 cGy per mm.

The bone scan index (BSI) is a promising candidate, being a reproducible, quantitative expression of tumor burden seen on bone scintigraphy. Prior studies have shown the prognostic value of a baseline BSI. This study tested whether treatment-related changes in BSI are prognostic for survival and compared BSI to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as an outcome measure.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively examined serial bone scans from patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (CRMPC) enrolled in four clinical trials. We calculated BSI at baseline and at 3 and 6 months on treatment and performed univariate and bivariate analyses of PSA, BSI, and survival.  Results:   Eighty-eight patients were scanned, 81 of whom have died. In the univariate analysis, the log percent change in BSI from baseline to 3 and 6 months on treatment prognosticated for survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.44; P = .0089 and HR, 2.54; P < .001, respectively). A doubling in BSI resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in risk of death. Log percent change in PSA at 6 months on treatment was also associated with survival (HR, 1.298; P = .013). In the bivariate analysis, change in BSI while adjusting for PSA was prognostic at 3 and 6 months on treatment (HR, 2.368; P = .012 and HR, 2.226; P = .002, respectively), but while adjusting for BSI, PSA was not prognostic.  Conclusion:   These data furnish early evidence that on-treatment changes in BSI are a response indicator and support further exploration of bone scintigraphy as an imaging biomarker in CRMPC.""","""['Elizabeth R Dennis', 'Xiaoyu Jia', 'Irina S Mezheritskiy', 'Ryan D Stephenson', 'Heiko Schoder', 'Josef J Fox', 'Glenn Heller', 'Howard I Scher', 'Steven M Larson', 'Michael J Morris']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer: bone scan index--a new imaging biomarker?', 'Assessment of the bone scan index in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of tasquinimod in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).', 'Prediction of survival benefit using an automated bone scan index in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Bone Scan Index Is an Independent Predictor of Time to Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Study.', 'Bone Scan Index predicts outcome in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Measuring the unmeasurable: automated bone scan index as a quantitative endpoint in prostate cancer clinical trials.', 'Whole-body low-dose CT can be of value in prostate cancer decision-making: a retrospective study on 601 patients.', 'Skeleton Segmentation on Bone Scintigraphy for BSI Computation.', 'Spinal Instability as a Prognostic Factor in Patients With Spinal Metastasis of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Bone scan index (BSI) scoring by using bone scintigraphy and circulating tumor cells (CTCs): predictive factors for enzalutamide effectiveness in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.', 'Development of a Prognostic Model of Overall Survival for Metastatic Hormone-Naïve Prostate Cancer in Japanese Men.']"""

Methods:   PET/CT was performed in 49 patients (age range 58-87 years) with rising PSA (mean 4.13 ng/ml) who were divided in four groups according to PSA level: ≤1 ng/ml, 1 to ≤2 ng/ml, 2 to ≤4 ng/ml, and >4 ng/ml. PSAve and PSAdt were measured. PET and CT scans were interpreted separately and then together.  Results:   PET/CT diagnosed relapse in 33 of the 49 patients (67%). The detection rates were 20%, 55%, 80% and 87% in the PSA groups ≤1, 1 to ≤2, 2 to ≤4 and >4 ng/ml, respectively. PET/CT was positive in 7 of 18 patients (38.9%) with a PSA ≤2 ng/ml, and in 26 of 31 (83.9%) with a PSA >2 ng/ml. PET/CT was positive in 7 of 25 patients (84%) with PSAdt ≤6 months, and in 12 of 24 patients (50%) with PSAdt >6 months, and was positive in 26 of 30 patients (86%) with a PSAve >2 ng/ml per year, and in 7 of 19 patients (36.8%) with PSAve ≤2 ng/ml per year.

CT with the administration of intravenous contrast medium did not provide any further information.  Conclusion:   Detection rate of (18)F-choline imaging is closely related to PSA and PSA kinetics. In particular, (18)F-choline PET/CT is recommended in patients with PSA >2 ng/ml, PSAdt ≤6 months and PSAve >2 ng/ml per year.

Objective:   Describe a standardized NS grading system based on intraoperative visual cues.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 133 consecutive patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) by a single surgeon were evaluated. The surgeon intraoperatively graded the NS independently for either side as follows: 1=no NS; 2=<50% NS; 3=50% NS; 4=75% NS; 5= ≥ 95% NS.  Surgical procedure:   RARP; detailed description of a five-point NS grading system.  Measurements:   The area of residual nerve tissue on prostatectomy specimens was compared with the intraoperative NS score (NSS). The rate of positive surgical margins (PSMs) according to the NSS is also reported.  Results and limitations:   In all, 52.6% of operated sides (140 of 266 sides) had NSS 5, 30.1% (80 of 266) had NSS 4, 2.3% (6 of 266) had NSS 3, 13.2% (35 of 266) had NSS 2, and 1.9% (5 of 266) had NSS 1. The area of residual nerve tissue was significantly different among the different NSSs: median area (interquartile range) for NSS 5: 0.5 (0-2) mm(2); for NSS 4: 3 (0-8) mm(2); for NSS 3: 13 (7-23) mm(2); for NSS 2: 14 (8-24) mm(2); and for NSS 1: 57 (56-165) mm(2) (p<0.001). Overall, 9.02% of the patients (12 of 133 patients) had a PSM, with 8.3% (9 of 108) for pT2 and 12% (3 of 25) for pT3. Side-specific PSMs according to NSS were 3.6% (5 of 140) for NSS 5, 7.5% (6 of 80) for NSS 4, 16.7% (1 of 6) for NSS 3, 5.7% (2 of 35) for NSS 2, and 0% (0 of 5) for NSS 1. A limitation of our study is that the key anatomic landmarks are not recognizable in every case, and this technique might not be easy to perform during the early learning curve.

Biodegradable systems present potential advantages regarding safety benefit apart from the possibility to use higher molecular weight (Mw) carriers allowing PK optimization, by exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)-mediated tumor targeting. Within this context, we previously designed pH-responsive polyacetalic systems, tert-polymers, where a drug with the adequate diol-functionality was incorporated within the polymer mainchain. The synthetic, non-steroidal estrogen, diethylstilboestrol (DES) clinically used for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer was chosen as drug. In order to improve the properties of this tert-polymer, novel polyacetalic systems as block-co-polymers, with more defined structure have been obtained. This second generation polyacetals allowed higher drug capacity than the tert-polymer, a biphasic DES release profile at acidic pH and due to its controlled amphiphilic character readily formed micelle-like structures in solution. These features result in an enhancement of conjugate therapeutic value in selected prostate cancer cell models. Exhaustive physico-chemical characterization focusing on nanoconjugate solution behavior and using advanced techniques, such as, pulsed-gradient spin-echo NMR (PGSE-NMR) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), has been carried out in order to demonstrate this hypothesis. Clear evidence of significantly different conformation in solution has been obtained for both polyacetals.

Previously, finasteride (5αR2 inhibitor) treatment begun 3 weeks post-tumor implantation had no effect on Dunning R3327-H rat prostate tumor growth. We believe the tumor compensated for finasteride treatment by increasing tumor 5αR1 expression or activity. We hypothesize that finasteride treatment would not significantly alter tumor growth even if begun before tumor implantation, whereas dutasteride (5αR1 and 5αR2 inhibitor) treatment would decrease tumor growth regardless of whether treatment was initiated before or after tumor implantation.  Methodology/principal findings:   Sixty 8-week-old male nude mice were randomized to Control, Pre- and Post-Finasteride, and Pre- and Post-Dutasteride (83.3 mg drug/kg diet) diet groups. Pre- and post-groups began their treatment diets 1-2 weeks prior to or 3 weeks after subcutaneous injection of 1×10⁵ WPE1-NA22 human prostate cancer cells, respectively. Tumors were allowed to grow for 22 weeks; tumor areas, body weights, and food intakes were measured weekly. At study's conclusion, prostate and seminal vesicle weights were significantly decreased in all treatment groups versus the control; dutasteride intake significantly decreased seminal vesicle weights compared to finasteride intake. No differences were measured in final tumor areas or tumor weights between groups, likely due to poor tumor growth. In follow-up studies, proliferation of WPE1-NA22 prostate cancer cells and parent line RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells were unaltered by treatment with testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or mibolerone, suggesting that these cell lines are not androgen-sensitive.  Conclusion:   The lack of response of WPE1-NA22 prostate cancer cells to androgen treatment may explain the inadequate tumor growth observed.

It is expected that CLI will find many applications in biomedical research such as cancer detection, probe development, drug screening, and therapy monitoring. In this study, we explored the possibility of using CLI to monitor drug efficacy by comparisons against PET. To assess the performance of both modalities in therapy monitoring, 2 murine tumor models (large cell lung cancer cell line H460 and prostate cancer cell line PC3) were given bevacizumab versus vehicle treatments. Two common radiotracers, 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) and (18)F-FDG, were used to monitor bevacizumab treatment efficacy.  Methods:   One group of mice (n = 6) was implanted with H460 xenografts bilaterally in the shoulder region, divided into treatment and control groups (n = 3 each), injected with (18)F-FLT, and imaged with PET immediately followed by CLI. The other group of mice (n = 6) was implanted with PC3 xenografts in the same locations, divided into treatment and control groups (n = 3 each), injected with (18)F-FDG, and imaged by the same modalities. Bevacizumab treatment was performed by 2 injections of 20 mg/kg at days 0 and 2.  Results:   On (18)F-FLT scans, both CLI and PET revealed significantly decreased signals from H460 xenografts in treated mice from pretreatment to day 3. Moderately increased to unchanged signals were observed in untreated mice. On (18)F-FDG scans, both CLI and PET showed relatively unchanged signals from PC3 tumors in both treated and control groups. Quantifications of tumor signals of Cerenkov luminescence and PET images showed that the 2 modalities had excellent correlations (R(2) > 0.88 across all study groups).  Conclusion:   CLI and PET exhibit excellent correlations across different tumor xenografts and radiotracers.

Given recent studies demonstrating that autophagy is a resistance mechanism to multiple therapeutic agents in the setting of apoptotic inhibition, we hypothesized that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an anti-malarial drug that inhibits autophagy, will increase cytotoxicity of ABT-737.  Experimental design:   Cytotoxicity of ABT-737 and HCQ was assessed in vitro in PC-3 and LNCaP cells, and in vivo in a xenograft mouse model. The role of autophagy as a resistance mechanism was assessed by siRNA knockdown of the essential autophagy gene beclin1. ROS was measured by flow cytometry, and mitophagy assessed by the mCherry-Parkin reporter.  Results:   Induction of autophagy by ABT-737 was a mechanism of resistance in prostate cancer cell lines. Therapeutic inhibition of autophagy with HCQ increased cytotoxicity of ABT-737 both in vitro and in vivo.

Since steroid hormones play a central role in the development and progression of prostate cancer, we aimed to analyze in a matched nested case-control study the value of molecules involved in steroid signaling, to predict recurrence after radical prostatectomy, independently from standard prognostic tools.  Methods:   Among 1,200 patients treated by radical prostatectomy with negative margins with at least 4 years follow-up, 121 prostate cancers with biochemical relapse were matched after pathological reassessment with 121 cancers with identical clinicopathological features but without relapse. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays, using antibodies directed against molecules involved in androgen and estrogen signaling, including hormone receptors, enzymes (such as the five alpha reductases 1,2 and 3, aromatase, alpha-keto reductase 1C3 and squalene epoxidase), the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1), and the proliferation marker Ki67.  Results:   The median follow-up for patients without recurrence was 7 years. Both cell proliferation and BCAR1 expression were significantly associated with biochemical relapse, in univariate and multivariate analysis. In subgroup analysis, the sole predictive marker in patients with well-differentiated prostate cancer was BCAR1 (P = 0.004), whereas only proliferation (P = 0.001) was significantly associated with relapse in less-differentiated prostate cancer patients.  Conclusions:   BCAR1 is an independent predictor of recurrence after radical prostatectomy for ""low risk"" prostate cancer.

In the Goteborg study, the median mortality reduction in the screening group during 14 years of follow-up was 44%, according to an intention-to-screen analysis. Introducing PSA-based screening could lead to evident mortality reduction and the prevention of metastatic disease progression, which may decrease QOL. Furthermore, establishing an optimal screening system that includes more accurate detection methods, minimally invasive treatment and active surveillance strategy(which minimizes over detection, overtreatment, and loss of QOL due to treatment), would improve the clinical validity of PSA screening.

Methods:   A prospective two-centre study was established to assess men referred from the primary care based on the UK national guidelines.  Results:   The overall cancer detection rate was 43% (169 out of 397) with 15% (26 out of 169) of all cancers metastatic at presentation. Amongst 50-69-year-old men these rates were 34% (68 out of 200) and 15% (10 out of 68). Only 21% (25 out of 123) of men with local cancers had low-risk disease. In comparison to a historical cohort from 2001 (n=137) we found no overall differences in rates of metastatic disease, locally advanced tumours, or risk categories. Amongst 50-69-year-old men with local disease, however, we observed an increase in detection of low-risk cancers in a contemporary cohort (P=0.04). This was primarily because of the increased detection of low-stage organ-confined tumours in this group (P=0.02).  Conclusion:   Use of the UK prostate cancer guidelines detects a high proportion of clinically significant cancers.

Aim:   The aim of this article was to identify patients who may recover EF after retropubic BNSRP (BNSRRP) without PDE5.  Methods:   We included 293 patients treated with BNSRRP at a single center. Postoperative EF recovery was defined as an EF domain score of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) ≥22. No patient received any treatment for postoperative erectile dysfunction (ED). Kaplan-Meier curves assessed time to EF recovery according to patient age, preoperative EF, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models tested the association between predictors and EF recovery. Finally, the rate of EF recovery of untreated patients after BNSRP was compared with a subset of patients with similar preoperative characteristics but receiving PDE5.  Main outcome measure:   The main outcome measure of this article was the IIEF-EF domain score.  Results:   Overall, 105/293 (35.8%) reached an IIEF-EF ≥22 after a mean follow-up of 26.8 months. At multivariable analyses, age, preoperative IIEF-EF, and CCI achieved independent predictor status (all P≤0.04). Patients <55 years had a 72.4% EF recovery rate compared with 30% of patients >70 years (P<0.001). Similarly, preoperatively fully potent patients (IIEF-EF ≥26) had a 56.6% chance of recovering EF after surgery compared with 18% of patients with severe ED before surgery (P<0.001). The rate of EF recovery in untreated patients <55 years and with a pre-op IIEF-EF ≥22 was higher but did not differ significantly from comparable patients receiving PDE5 (P=0.11).  Conclusions:   Overall, the rate of EF postoperative recovery in patients left untreated after surgery is modest (35.8%). Although younger patients with a good preoperative EF may experience good EF recovery rates even without any treatment, use of PDE5 after surgery further improved their functional outcomes. Therefore, a therapy for ED should be offered to all patients treated with BNSRP.""","""['Andrea Gallina', 'Matteo Ferrari', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Umberto Capitanio', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Manuela Tutolo', 'Marco Bianchi', 'Antonino Saccà', 'Andrea Salonia', 'Patrizio Rigatti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Predicting erectile function recovery after bilateral nerve sparing radical prostatectomy: a proposal of a novel preoperative risk stratification.', 'Choosing the best candidates for penile rehabilitation after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Erectile Function Recovery After Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: Is Back to Baseline Status Enough for Patient Satisfaction?', 'Efficacy and safety of short- and long-term, regular and on-demand regimens of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in treating erectile dysfunction after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Efficacy and safety of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in treating erectile dysfunction after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Canadian consensus algorithm for erectile rehabilitation following prostate cancer treatment.', 'Sonic hedgehog regulation of cavernous nerve regeneration and neurite formation in aged pelvic plexus.', 'A prediction model relating the extent of intraoperative fascia preservation to erectile dysfunction after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Role of inhibiting LIM-kinase2 in improving erectile function through suppression of corporal fibrosis in a rat model of cavernous nerve injury.', 'Peptide amphiphile nanofiber hydrogel delivery of sonic hedgehog protein to the cavernous nerve to promote regeneration and prevent erectile dysfunction.']"""

It aims at integrating interaction data and experimental data to elucidate diseases and also raises new issues in drug discovery for cancer treatment. However, drug target discovery is still at a trial-and-error experimental stage and it is a challenging task to develop a prediction model that can systematically detect possible drug targets to deal with complex diseases.  Methods:   We integrate gene expression, disease genes and interaction networks to identify the effective drug targets which have a strong influence on disease genes using network flow approach. In the experiments, we adopt the microarray dataset containing 62 prostate cancer samples and 41 normal samples, 108 known prostate cancer genes and 322 approved drug targets treated in human extracted from DrugBank database to be candidate proteins as our test data. Using our method, we prioritize the candidate proteins and validate them to the known prostate cancer drug targets.  Results:   We successfully identify potential drug targets which are strongly related to the well known drugs for prostate cancer treatment and also discover more potential drug targets which raise the attention to biologists at present. We denote that it is hard to discover drug targets based only on differential expression changes due to the fact that those genes used to be drug targets may not always have significant expression changes. Comparing to previous methods that depend on the network topology attributes, they turn out that the genes having potential as drug targets are weakly correlated to critical points in a network. In comparison with previous methods, our results have highest mean average precision and also rank the position of the truly drug targets higher. It thereby verifies the effectiveness of our method.  Conclusions:   Our method does not know the real ideal routes in the disease network but it tries to find the feasible flow to give a strong influence to the disease genes through possible paths. We successfully formulate the identification of drug target prediction as a maximum flow problem on biological networks and discover potential drug targets in an accurate manner.""","""['Shih-Heng Yeh#', 'Hsiang-Yuan Yeh#', 'Von-Wun Soo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Clin Bioinforma""","""['SCNrank: spectral clustering for network-based ranking to reveal potential drug targets and its application in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Gene regulatory network inference: evaluation and application to ovarian cancer allows the prioritization of drug targets.', 'Integrating Biological Networks for Drug Target Prediction and Prioritization.', 'Aiming for zero blindness.', 'Drug Target Interplay: A Network-based Analysis of Human Diseases and the Drug Targets.', 'Network neighborhood operates as a drug repositioning method for cancer treatment.', 'A comprehensive review of artificial intelligence and network based approaches to drug repurposing in Covid-19.', 'Different responses to risperidone treatment in Schizophrenia: a multicenter genome-wide association and whole exome sequencing joint study.', 'JAK-STAT core cancer pathway: An integrative cancer interactome analysis.', 'A Maximum Flow-Based Approach to Prioritize Drugs for Drug Repurposing of Chronic Diseases.']"""

A total of 354 plasma samples from blood donors in the Reno/Tahoe area were screened for neutralization.  Results:   A total of 6.5% of donor samples gave moderate neutralization of XMRV, but not control pseudotypes. However, further testing by Western blot revealed no evidence of antibodies against MLVs in any of these samples. Furthermore, no evidence of infectious virus or viral nucleic acid was observed.  Conclusion:   A microneutralization assay was developed for detection of XMRV and can be applied in a high-throughput format for large-scale studies. Although a proportion of blood donors demonstrated the ability to block XMRV envelope-mediated infection, we found no evidence that this inhibition was mediated by specific antibodies elicited by exposure to XMRV or MLV. It is likely that this moderate neutralization is mediated through another, nonspecific mechanism.""","""['Yanchen Zhou', 'Imke Steffen', 'Leilani Montalvo', 'Tzong-Hae Lee', 'Reeve Zemel', 'William M Switzer', 'Shaohua Tang', 'Hongwei Jia', 'Walid Heneine', 'Valerie Winkelman', 'Chetankumar S Tailor', 'Yasuhiro Ikeda', 'Graham Simmons']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Transfusion""","""['Seroprevalence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in normal and retrovirus-infected blood donors.', 'No association of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus with prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome in Japan.', 'Absence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in blood donors in China.', 'Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus-Related Virus (XMRV) and the Safety of the Blood Supply.', 'Distribution of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) infection in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'Seroreactivity against Marburg or related filoviruses in West and Central Africa.', 'Serologic Prevalence of Ebola Virus in Equatorial Africa.', 'Serologic Markers for Ebolavirus Among Healthcare Workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.', 'Ebola Virus Neutralizing Antibodies Detectable in Survivors of theYambuku, Zaire Outbreak 40 Years after Infection.', 'Protease inhibitors targeting coronavirus and filovirus entry.']"""

However, cancer cells develop radioresistant phenotypes that decrease the efficacy of radiotherapy. Ionizing radiation (IR) induces the production of reactive oxygen species, which play an important role in apoptotic cell death. Therefore, radiation therapy combined with a sensitizer, which modulates cellular redox status, has the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy in a variety of human cancers. Here, we investigated the radiosensitizing effects of ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in rosemary and holy basil. IR-induced apoptosis in cancer cell lines such as DU145, CT26 and B16F10 was significantly enhanced by UA, as reflected by DNA fragmentation, cellular redox status, mitochondrial dysfunction and modulation of apoptotic marker proteins. Additionally, UA combined with IR was also effective for inhibiting tumorigenesis in B16F10 melanoma cells implanted into mice. Taken together, these results suggest that applying UA together with IR may be an effective combination modality for treating cancer.""","""['Su Jin Koh', 'Jean Kyoung Tak', 'Seon Tae Kim', 'Woo Suk Nam', 'Sung Youl Kim', 'Kwon Moo Park', 'Jeen-Woo Park']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Free Radic Res""","""['Alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists radiosensitize prostate cancer cells via apoptosis induction.', 'Ursolic acid regulates high glucose-induced apoptosis.', 'Ursolic acid induces PC-3 cell apoptosis via activation of JNK and inhibition of Akt pathways in vitro.', 'Synergistic effect of resveratrol and radiotherapy in control of cancers.', 'Current status of radiation sensitization by fluoropyrimidines.', 'Ursolic Acid against Prostate and Urogenital Cancers: A Review of In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.', 'Potential Role of Natural Products to Combat Radiotherapy and Their Future Perspectives.', 'Nutraceutical Compounds as Sensitizers for Cancer Treatment in Radiation Therapy.', 'Ursolic acid sensitizes radioresistant NSCLC cells expressing HIF-1α through reducing endogenous GSH and inhibiting HIF-1α.', 'New Insights toward Colorectal Cancer Chemotherapy Using Natural Bioactive Compounds.']"""

Spatial alignment of ex vivo histological sections to pre-operative in vivo MRI for prostate cancer (CaP) patients undergoing radical prostatectomy is a necessary first step in the discovery of quantitative multiprotocol MRI signatures for CaP. This may be done by spatially mapping delineated extent of disease on ex vivo histopathology onto pre-operative in vivo MRI via image registration. Apart from the challenges in spatially registering multi-modal data (histology and MRI) on account of (a) modality specific differences, (b) deformation due to the endorectal coil and tissue loss on histology, another complication is that the ex vivo histological sections, in the lab, are usually obtained as quadrants. This means they need to be reconstituted as a pseudo-whole mount histologic section (WMHS) prior to registration with MRI. An additional challenge is that most registration techniques rely on availability of the pre-segmented prostate capsule on T2w MRI. The novel contribution of this paper is that it leverages a spatially weighted mutual information (SWMI) scheme to automatically register and map CaP extent from WMHS onto pre-operative, multiprotocol MRI. The SWMI scheme obviates the need for pre-segmentation of the prostate capsule on MRI. Additionally, we leverage a program developed by our group, Histostitcher©, for interactive stitching of individual histology quadrants to digitally reconstruct the pseudo WMHS. Our registration methodology comprises the following main steps, (1) affine registration of T2w and DCE MRI, (2) affine registration of stitched WMHS to multiprotocol T2w and DCE MRI, and (3) multimodal image registration of WMHS to multiprotocol T2w and DCE MRI using SWMI. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated all aspects of our methodology in the multimodal registration of a total of 7 corresponding histology and MRI sections from 2 different patients.

These artifacts degrade MR image quality significantly, obfuscating anatomical and physiological detail and hence need to be corrected for to facilitate application of computerized analysis techniques such as segmentation, registration, and classification. Specifically, algorithms are required to correct for bias field (intensity inhomogeneity), intensity non-standardness (drift in tissue intensities across patient acquisitions), and Gaussian noise, an artifact that significantly affects and blurs tissue boundaries (resulting in poor gradients). While clearly one needs to correct for all these artifacts, the exact sequence in which all three operations need to be applied in order to maximize MR image quality has not been explored. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the interplay between distinct algorithms for bias field correction (BFC), intensity standardization (IS), and noise filtering (NF) to study the effect of these operations on image quality in the context of 3 Tesla T2-weighted (T2w) prostate MRI. 7 different sequences comprising combinations of BFC, IS, and NF were quantitatively evaluated in terms of the percent coefficient of variation (%CV), a statistic which attempts to quantify the intensity inhomogeneity within a region of interest (prostate). The different combinations were also independently evaluated in the context of a classifier scheme for detection of prostate cancer on high resolution in vivo T2w prostate MRI. A secondary contribution of this work is a novel evaluation measure for quantifying the level of intensity non-standardness, called difference of modes (DoM). Experimental evaluation of the different sequences of operations across 22 patient datasets revealed that the sequence of BFC, followed by NF, and IS provided the best image quality in terms of %CV as well as classifier accuracy. The DoM measure was able to accurately capture the level of intensity non-standardness present in the images resulting from the different sequences of operations.""","""['Daniel Palumbo', 'Brian Yee', ""Patrick O'Dea"", 'Shane Leedy', 'Satish Viswanath', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Interplay between intensity standardization and inhomogeneity correction in MR image processing.', 'SEMAC-VAT and MSVAT-SPACE sequence strategies for metal artifact reduction in 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Central gland and peripheral zone prostate tumors have significantly different quantitative imaging signatures on 3 Tesla endorectal, in vivo T2-weighted MR imagery.', 'A review of methods for correction of intensity inhomogeneity in MRI.', 'A review of attenuation correction techniques for tissue fluorescence.', 'Prostate Surface Distension and Tumor Texture Descriptors From Pre-Treatment MRI Are Associated With Biochemical Recurrence Following Radical Prostatectomy: Preliminary Findings.', 'Challenges in ensuring the generalizability of image quantitation methods for MRI.', 'Longitudinal brain tumor segmentation prediction in MRI using feature and label fusion.', 'Advanced Imaging Analysis in Prostate MRI: Building a Radiomic Signature to Predict Tumor Aggressiveness.', ""Impact of different scanners and acquisition parameters on robustness of MR radiomics features based on women's cervix.""]"""

Pain during the implantation procedure was assessed according to the Wong-Baker faces pain scale.  Results:   Of 234 patients, 32% had at least one new symptom after the procedure. The commonest new symptom following the procedure was urinary frequency affecting 16% of patients who had not been troubled by frequency beforehand.

Low dietary and circulating folate and polymorphic variation in this pathway are associated with increased risk of colorectal adenoma and cancer.  Methods:   We genotyped 882 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 82 one-carbon metabolism genes for 1,331 cases of advanced colorectal adenoma, identified by sigmoidoscopy at baseline, and 1,501 controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). We evaluated associations between one-carbon genes and adenoma risk in all subjects and stratified by folate intake. We applied the Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (ARTP) method to assess statistical significance at the gene and pathway levels.  Results:   Folate intake was inversely associated with advanced colorectal adenoma risk [odds ratio (OR) by quartile = 0.85, P = 1.9 × 10(-5)]. We found no statistically significant associations between one-carbon genes and adenoma risk in all subjects. As hypothesized, we observed a statistically significant pathway-level association (P = 0.038) in the lowest quartile of folate; no significant associations were found in higher quartiles.

However, the conditions under which Arresten is released from collagen IV in vivo or whether the protein functions in tumor suppressor pathways remain unknown. Here, we show that p53 induces the expression of α1 collagen IV and release of Arresten-containing fragments from the ECM. Comparison of the transcriptional activation of COL4A1 with other CDAF-containing genes revealed that COL4A1 is a major antiangiogenic gene induced by p53 in human adenocarinoma cells. p53 directly activated transcription of the COL4A1 gene by binding to an enhancer region 26 kbp downstream of its 3' end. p53 also stabilized the expression of full-length α1 collagen IV by upregulation of α(II) prolyl-hydroxylase and increased the release of Arresten in the ECM through a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-dependent mechanism. The resulting upregulation of α1 collagen IV and production of Arresten by the tumor cells significantly inhibited angiogenesis and limited tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we show that immunostaining of Arresten correlated with p53 status in human prostate cancer specimens.

Methods:   Between February 2004 and August 2010, patients with prostate cancer who underwent HIFU treatment were reviewed about oncologic outcomes and complications. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir plus 1.2 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate BCR- and disease progression-free survival according to risk stratification. Predictors for BCR and disease progression were identified using the Cox-proportional hazard method.  Results:   The overall BCR rate was 59.5%, and median time to BCR was 13.8 months. The 5-year BCR-free survival rates of the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 66.3, 40.2, and 21.0% (P = 0.001), respectively, and the 5-year disease progression-free survival rates were 73.5, 46.0, and 29.2%, respectively (P = 0.008). Multivariate analysis showed that risk stratification, PSA nadir, and time to PSA nadir were significant predictors of BCR and disease progression. In the first 3 months post-op, 11 patients (8.7%) had complications. There were no patients who required blood transfusions or who had wound problems, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or bowel dysfunction.  Conclusions:   HIFU treatment does not provide effective oncologic outcomes even in low risk patients with prostate cancer as well as in the intermediate or high risk groups. Therefore, patients selected to undergo HIFU treatment for prostate cancer must be very carefully chosen.

It is rare for this deletion to occur in primary prostate tumors, yet approximately 10% express decreased levels of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) mRNA.

However, because of their highly dynamic nature, they can be replaced irreversibly in buffers and biological medium, leading to poor colloidal stability. To overcome this, we report a simple and effective cross-linking methodology to transfer oleate-stabilized upconverting NaYF(4) core/shell nanoparticles (UCNPs) from hydrophobic to aqueous phase, with long-term dispersion stability in buffers and biological medium. Amphiphilic poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMAO) modified with and without poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was used to intercalate with the surface oleates, enabling the transfer of the UCNPs to water. The PMAO units on the phase transferred UCNPs were then successfully cross-linked using bis(hexamethylene)triamine (BHMT). The primary advantage of cross-linking of PMAO by BHMT is that it improves the stability of the UCNPs in water, physiological saline buffers, and biological growth media and in a wide range of pH values when compared to un-cross-linked PMAO. The cross-linked PMAO-BHMT coated UCNPs were found to be stable in water for more than 2 months and in physiological saline buffers for weeks, substantiating the effectiveness of cross-linking in providing high dispersion stability. The PMAO-BHMT cross-linked UCNPs were extensively characterized using various techniques providing supporting evidence for the cross-linking process. These UCNPs were found to be stable in serum supplemented growth medium (37 °C) for more than 2 days. Utilizing this, we demonstrate the uptake of cross-linked UCNPs by LNCaP cells (human prostate cancer cell line), showing their utility as biolabels.""","""['Guicheng Jiang', 'Jothirmayanantham Pichaandi', 'Noah J J Johnson', 'Robert D Burke', 'Frank C J M van Veggel']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Langmuir""","""['Optimisation of Amphiphilic-Polymer Coatings for Improved Chemical Stability of NaYF4-based Upconverting Nanoparticles.', 'Amphiphilic coatings for the protection of upconverting nanoparticles against dissolution in aqueous media.', 'Surface modification of upconverting NaYF4 nanoparticles with PEG-phosphate ligands for NIR (800 nm) biolabeling within the biological window.', 'Surface modification and characterization of photon-upconverting nanoparticles for bioanalytical applications.', 'Polymer-coated nanoparticles: a universal tool for biolabelling experiments.', 'Novel Fluorescent Probe Based on Rare-Earth Doped Upconversion Nanomaterials and Its Applications in Early Cancer Detection.', 'Engineered lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles for biosensing and bioimaging application.', 'The Use of Upconversion Nanoparticles in Prostate Cancer Photodynamic Therapy.', '808\xa0nm-activable core@multishell upconverting nanoparticles with enhanced stability for efficient photodynamic therapy.', 'Optically Robust and Biocompatible Mechanosensitive Upconverting Nanoparticles.']"""

This analysis focuses solely on the 400 participants who had suboptimal levels of MVPA at baseline (measured by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall) and who completed the 2-year study.  Results:   Median minutes of MVPA at baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-up in the tailored intervention arm were as follows: 0, 90, and 60 min/week, respectively. The corresponding values in the attention control group were 0, 30, and 30 min/week. Significant improvements in MVPA from baseline to 2-year follow-up were observed in both study arms (p < 0.01). While significant between-arm differences were observed at 1-year follow-up (p < 0.01), there was only the suggestion of a trend (p = 0.08) at 2-year follow-up.  Conclusions:   This study provides evidence that mailed-print exercise interventions result in significant and sustainable improvements in MVPA among newly diagnosed cancer survivors that are observed well after the intervention is complete. While tailored interventions, as compared to standardized materials, appear to produce superior improvements in MVPA initially, these differences diminish over time.""","""['Allison J Ottenbacher', 'R Sue Day', 'Wendell C Taylor', 'Shreela V Sharma', 'Richard Sloane', 'Denise C Snyder', 'Isaac M Lipkus', 'Lee W Jones', 'Wendy Demark-Wahnefried']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Effects of home-based diet and exercise on functional outcomes among older, overweight long-term cancer survivors: RENEW: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Main outcomes of the FRESH START trial: a sequentially tailored, diet and exercise mailed print intervention among breast and prostate cancer survivors.', 'Long-term dietary outcomes of the FRESH START intervention for breast and prostate cancer survivors.', 'Home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes for breast cancer survivors.', 'Exercise interventions on health-related quality of life for people with cancer during active treatment.', 'Brief Post-Surgical Stress Management Reduces Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines in Overweight and Obese Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Primary Treatment.', 'Digital tools to support the maintenance of physical activity in people with long-term conditions: A scoping review.', 'Dietary interventions for adult cancer survivors.', ""Implementing physical activity programs for patients with cancer in current practice: patients' experienced barriers and facilitators."", 'Diet and lifestyle considerations for patients with prostate cancer.']"""

By conjugating Qdots with small antibody fragments targeting membrane-bound proteins, such as GRP78, we demonstrate here that the Quantum dot- Anti-GRP78 scFv (Qdot-GRP78) retains its immunospecificity and its distribution can be monitored by visualization of multi-color fluorescence imaging both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover we demonstrate here for the first time that Qdot-GRP78 scFv bioconjugates can be efficiently internalized by cancer cells, thus upregulate phophosphate-AKT-ser473 and possess biological anti-tumour activity as shown by inhibition of breast cancer growth in a xenograft model.

The criteria for patient selection included prostate-specific antigen level below 4.0 ng/mL; negative involvement of the trigone and/or prostatic urethra; and no self-reported erectile dysfunction. The surgical procedure included laparoscopic prostate- and neurovascular bundles-sparing cystectomy with an ileal neobladder construction. Mean follow-up was 18 months.  Results:   All patients underwent laparoscopic resection without requiring a traditional open procedure. The mean operation time was 215 min with a mean volume of intraoperative hemorrhage of 190 mL. After removal of the urinary catheter, all patients had a daytime urinary continence; six had a short period of nighttime urinary incontinence. Most patients reported a strong desire for sexual activity and were able to complete sexual intercourse without auxiliary measures at 3 months postoperatively. Grade-3 complications developed in 2 patients graded by the classification of Clavien system. One patient was diagnosed with pelvic recurrence 16 months postoperatively.

Patients and methods:   A total of 385 patients with histologically proven prostate cancer (PCa) have been included in this retrospective study between 2004 and 2008. All patients underwent preoperative eMRI at 1.5 T before open RP. Staging results by eMRI were compared with the histopathological findings. The presence of positive surgical margins and extent of nerve-sparing procedure were evaluated. Subgroup analysis of low-risk group and intermediate to high-risk group based on D'Amico criteria was conducted.  Results:   In 294 (76.4%) patients, pathological stage was correctly predicted, 69 patients (17.9%) were understaged and 22 (5.7%) overstaged. Overall sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value for predicting extracapsular extension (ECE) were 41.5, 91.8, 78.0 and 69.0%, respectively. One hundred and fifty-two (48.4%) of the patients classified as stage cT2 by eMRI underwent bilateral NVB sparing, whereas 14 (19.7%) patients with reported ECE underwent bilateral NVB sparing (P < 0.01). Overall positive surgical margin rate was 14.8%. Sensitivity of predicting ECE and positive predictive value were lower in the low-risk group than in the intermediate and high-risk group.  Conclusions:   eMRI is effective in predicting extracapsular extension in an intermediate to high-risk group.

Oxidative stress (OS) is a key process in the development and progression of PC. Adiponectin, an adipocyte-specific hormone, circulates at relatively high levels in healthy humans, but at reduced levels in obese subjects. Moreover, case-control studies also document lower levels of serum adiponectin in PC patients compared with healthy individuals.  Methods:   Human 22Rv1 and DU-145 PC cell lines were examined for the generation of OS and detoxification of reactive oxygen species after treatment with adiponectin. Normality was confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and results were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance.  Results:   We demonstrate that adiponectin increased cellular anti-oxidative defense mechanisms and inhibited OS in a significant and dose-dependent manner. We show that adiponectin treatment decreased the generation of superoxide anion in both cell lines, whereas the transcript levels of NADPH oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4 increased. We also found indications of an overall anti-oxidative effect, as the total anti-oxidative potential, catalase activity and protein levels, and manganese superoxide dismutase protein levels increased significantly (P<0.05) in both cell lines after treatment with adiponectin.

Here, we propose a novel mechanism through which the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 regulates EMT in prostate cancer cells through cooperation with the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1. We found that forced expression of SIRT1 in non-transformed PZ-HPV-7 prostate epithelial cells disrupts the epithelial morphology concomitant with decreased expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers. In contrast, silencing SIRT1 in metastatic prostate tumor cells restores cell-cell adhesion and induces a shift toward an epithelial morphology concomitant with increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers. We also found that SIRT1 has a physiologically relevant role in endogenous EMT induced by EGF signaling in prostate cancer cells. We propose that the regulation of EMT by SIRT1 involves modulation of, and cooperation with, the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1. Specifically, we show that SIRT1 silencing reduces expression of ZEB1 and that SIRT1 is recruited to the E-cadherin proximal promoter by ZEB1 to deacetylate histone H3 and to reduce binding of RNA polymerase II, ultimately suppressing E-cadherin transcription. We thus identify a necessary role for ZEB1 in SIRT1-mediated EMT. Finally, we show that reduction of SIRT1 decreases prostate cancer cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo in immunodeficient mice, which is largely independent of any general effects of SIRT1 on prostate cancer growth and survival. We therefore identify SIRT1 as a positive regulator of EMT and metastatic growth of prostate cancer cells and our findings implicate overexpressed SIRT1 as a potential therapeutic target to reverse EMT and to prevent prostate cancer progression.""","""['V Byles', 'L Zhu', 'J D Lovaas', 'L K Chmilewski', 'J Wang', 'D V Faller', 'Y Dai']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Effect of SIRT1 Gene on Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Human Prostate Cancer PC-3 Cells.', 'Role of SIRT1 in regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in oral squamous cell carcinoma metastasis.', 'MPP8 and SIRT1 crosstalk in E-cadherin gene silencing and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Narrower insight to SIRT1 role in cancer: A potential therapeutic target to control epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic regulation of hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal cell states in cancer.', 'Synthetic Epigenetic Reprogramming of Mesenchymal to Epithelial States Using the CRISPR/dCas9 Platform in Triple Negative Breast Cancer.', 'The Interplay between Intracellular Iron Homeostasis and Neuroinflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases.', 'Cellular Transcriptomics of Carboplatin Resistance in a Metastatic Canine Osteosarcoma Cell Line.', 'SIRT6 drives sensitivity to ferroptosis in anaplastic thyroid cancer through NCOA4-dependent autophagy.']"""

We report trends in potential years of life lost during the same period.  Materials and methods:   Potential years of life lost were calculated to assess premature mortality trends for ureter, bladder, kidney and renal pelvis, penis, testis and prostate cancers. Calculations were based on SEER cancer mortality data. Potential years of life lost up to and including age 75 years were calculated by and across genders in 5-year increments between 1972 and 2006.  Results:   A total of 7,733,235 potential years of life were lost in men and women. In each gender the greatest potential loss was for kidney and renal pelvis cancer related mortality. In each gender no improvement in the potential loss due to ureteral and bladder cancer related mortality was observed during 3 decades. In males the greatest decrease in potential years of life lost was for testicular cancer, followed by prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   There has been an increasing trend in potential years of life lost related to urogenital cancer during the last 35 years for males and females. This trend is mainly due to an increase in kidney cancer.

GRP was demonstrated to stimulate the proliferation and invasiveness of androgen-independent prostate carcinoma. GRP mediates its action through the membrane-bound receptor, GRP receptor (GRPR), which is characterized by a high-affinity binding for both GRP and bombesin. In human prostate cancer tissue, GRPR mRNA was reported to be detectable in more than 90% but its immunolocalizaition has not been reported. Therefore, in this study we immunolocalized GRPR in 51 human prostate cancer cases and correlated the findings with several clinicopathological parameters in order to better understand the function and regulation of GRPR in human prostate cancer. GRPR was immnolocalized in carcinoma cells and their values were significantly associated with Gleason score and immunoreactivity of estrogen receptor βcx (ERβcx) that is one of splicing variants of ligand dependent transcription factor, ERβ, and considered to be prognostic factor of prostate cancer patients.

However, the relatively small number of feasible restriction enzyme sequences in their cloning sites can hinder successful generation of overexpression constructs if these sequences are also present in the target cDNA insert.  Results:   Utilizing ligation-independent cloning (LIC) technology, we have modified the highly efficient retroviral transduction vector, pBABE, to eliminate reliance on restriction enzymes for cloning. Instead, the modified plasmid, pBLIC, utilizes random 12/13-base overhangs generated by T4 DNA polymerase 3' exonuclease activity. PCR-based introduction of the complementary sequence into any cDNA of interest enables universal cloning into pBLIC. Here we describe creation of the pBLIC plasmid, and demonstrate successful cloning and protein overexpression from three different cDNAs, Bax, catalase, and p53 through transduction into the human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP or the human lung cancer line, H358.  Conclusions:   Our results show that pBLIC vector retains the high transduction efficiency of the original pBABE while eliminating the requirement for checking individual cDNA inserts for internal restriction sites. Thus it comprises an effective retroviral cloning system for laboratory-scale stable gene overexpression or for high-throughput applications such as creation of retroviral cDNA libraries.

Here we investigated the use of STK1 in health screening for early detection of pre-malignant and malignant diseases. The investigation was based on 35,365 participants in four independent health screening studies in China between 2005-2011. All participants were clinically examined. The concentration of STK1 was determined by a sensitive chemiluminescent dot blot ECL assay. The ROCvalue of the STK1 assay was 0.96. At a cut-off STK1 value of 2.0 pM, the likelihood (+) value was 236.5, and the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.78 and 0.99, respectively. The relative number of city-dwelling people with elevated STK1 values (≥2.0 pM) was 0.8% (198/26,484), while the corresponding value for the group of oil-field workers was 5.8% (514/8,355). The latter group expressed significantly higher frequency of refractory anaemia, fatty liver, and obesity, compared to the city dwellers, but no cases of breast hyperplasia or prostate hyperplasia. Furthermore, people working in oil drilling/oil transportation showed higher STK1 values and higher frequency of pre-malignancies and benign diseases than people working in the oil-field administration. In the STK1 elevated group of the city-dwelling people, a statistically significantly higher number of people were found to have malignancies, pre-malignancies of all types, moderate/severe type of hyperplasia of breast or prostate, or refractory anaemia, or to be at high risk for hepatitis B, compared to people with normal STK1 values (<2.0 pM). No malignancies were found in the normal STK1 group. In the elevated STK1 group 85.4% showed diseases linked to a higher risk for pre-/early cancerous progression, compared to 52.4% of those with normal STK1 values. Among participants with elevated STK1 values, 8.8% developed new malignancies or progress in their pre-malignancies within 5 to 72 months, compared to 0.2% among people with normal STK1 values. People who showed elevated STK1 values were at about three to five times higher risk to develop malignancies compared to a calculated risk based on a cancer incidence rate of 0.2-0.3%.

The reasons for this are poorly understood.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, 77,038 black and white males aged >65 years were identified with a first primary diagnosis of prostate cancer between 1995 and 2005, as well as 49,769 controls. The racial gap in mortality was decomposed to differential incidence and stage-specific prostate cancer mortality. The importance of various clinical and socioeconomic factors to each of these components was then examined.  Results:   The estimated mortality gap for prostate cancer-specific mortality was 1320 more cases per 100,000 males among black than white men. This gap was due to higher prostate cancer incidence among black males (76%) and higher stage-specific mortality once diagnosed (24%). Differences in prostate-specific antigen testing, comorbidities, and income explained 29% of the difference in metastatic cancer incidence but none of the racial gap for local/regional incidence. Conditional on diagnosis, tumor characteristics explained 50% of the racial gap, comorbidities an additional 4%, choice of treatment and physician 17%, and socioeconomic factors 15%. Overall, approximately 25% of the racial gap in mortality and 86% of the gap in mortality conditional on diagnosis could be explained.  Conclusions:   More frequent prostate-specific antigen testing for black and low-income males could potentially reduce the prostate cancer mortality gap through earlier diagnosis of tumors that otherwise may become metastatic.

We speculated that impaired regulation of PGP9.5 through epigenetic pathways is associated with the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.  Methods:   CpG methylation of the PGP9.5 gene was analyzed in cultured prostate cancer cell lines, 226 localized prostate cancer samples from radical prostatectomy cases, and 80 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues.  Results:   Following 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidune treatment, increased PGP9.5 mRNA transcript expression was found in the LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. With bisulfite DNA sequencing, partial methylation of the PGP9.5 promoter was shown in LNCaP whereas complete methylation was found in PC3 cells. After transfection of PGP9.5 siRNA, cell viability was significantly accelerated in LNCaP but not in PC3 cells as compared with control siRNA transfection. Promoter methylation of PGP9.5 was extremely low in only one of 80 BPH tissues, whereas it was found in 37 of 226 prostate cancer tissues. Expression of the mRNA transcript of PGP9.5 was significantly lower in methylation (+) than methylation (-) prostate cancer tissues. Multivariate analysis of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after an radical prostatectomy revealed pT category and PGP9.5 methylation as prognostically relevant. Further stratification with the pT category in addition to methylation status identified a stepwise reduction of BCR-free probability.  Conclusion:   This is the first clinical and comprehensive study of inactivation of the PGP9.5 gene via epigenetic pathways in primary prostate cancer.

Within the concentration range that was not cytotoxic, cordycepin time-dependently inhibited cell motility and invasiveness of LNCaP cells. The inhibitory effects of cordycepin on cell invasiveness were associated with tightening of tight junctions (TJs), which was demonstrated by an increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER).

Furthermore, cordycepin inhibited the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, and simultaneously increased levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2. These effects were related to inactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in LNCaP cells.

Cell survival pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, promote cell viability by impeding mitochondrial cytochrome c release and by inhibiting subsequent caspase activation. Here, we describe a mechanism for the inhibition of cytochrome c-induced caspase activation by MAPK signalling, identifying a novel mode of apoptotic regulation exerted through Apaf-1 phosphorylation by the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk). Recruitment of 14-3-3ɛ to phosphorylated Ser268 impedes the ability of cytochrome c to nucleate apoptosome formation and activate downstream caspases. High endogenous levels of Rsk in PC3 prostate cancer cells or Rsk activation in other cell types promoted 14-3-3ɛ binding to Apaf-1 and rendered the cells insensitive to cytochrome c, suggesting a potential role for Rsk signalling in apoptotic resistance of prostate cancers and other cancers with elevated Rsk activity. Collectively, these results identify a novel locus of apoptosomal regulation wherein MAPK signalling promotes Rsk-catalysed Apaf-1 phosphorylation and consequent binding of 14-3-3ɛ, resulting in decreased cellular responsiveness to cytochrome c.""","""['Jiyeon Kim', 'Amanda B Parrish', 'Manabu Kurokawa', 'Kenkyo Matsuura', 'Christopher D Freel', 'Joshua L Andersen', 'Carrie E Johnson', 'Sally Kornbluth']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""EMBO J""","""['Cytochrome c speeds up caspase cascade activation by blocking 14-3-3ε-dependent Apaf-1 inhibition.', 'Protein kinase A regulates caspase-9 activation by Apaf-1 downstream of cytochrome c.', 'Pro-apoptotic proteins released from the mitochondria regulate the protein composition and caspase-processing activity of the native Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosome complex.', 'Apaf-1: Regulation and function in cell death.', 'A molecular view on signal transduction by the apoptosome.', 'Caspase 3-specific cleavage of MEK1 suppresses ERK signaling and sensitizes cells to stress-induced apoptosis.', 'Fusion genes in gynecologic tumors: the occurrence, molecular mechanism and prospect for therapy.', 'Costunolide attenuates oxygen‑glucose deprivation/reperfusion‑induced mitochondrial‑mediated apoptosis in PC12 cells.', 'Reversal of homocysteine-induced neurotoxicity in rat hippocampal neurons by astaxanthin: evidences for mitochondrial dysfunction and signaling crosstalk.', 'The impact of phosphatases on proliferative and survival signaling in cancer.']"""

Management options for localized disease exist, yet an evidence-based criterion standard for treatment still has to emerge. Although 5-year survival rates approach 98%, all treatment options carry the possibility for significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. It is therefore recommended that patients be actively involved in the treatment decision process. We have developed an Internet/CD-ROM-based multimedia Prostate Interactive Educational System (PIES) to enhance patients' treatment decision making. PIES virtually mirrors a health center to provide patients with information about prostate cancer and its treatment through an intuitive interface, using videos, animations, graphics, and texts.  Objectives:   (1) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of the PIES intervention and to report preliminary outcomes of the program in a pilot trial among patients with a new prostate cancer diagnosis, and (2) to explore the potential impact of tailoring PIES treatment information to participants' information-seeking styles on study outcomes.  Methods:   Participants (n = 72) were patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer who had not made a treatment decision. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 experimental conditions: (1) control condition (providing information through standard National Cancer Institute brochures; 26%), and PIES (2) with tailoring (43%) and (3) without tailoring to a patient's information-seeking style (31%). Questionnaires were administrated before (t1) and immediately after the intervention (t2). Measurements include evaluation and acceptability of the PIES intervention, monitoring/blunting information-seeking style, psychological distress, and decision-related variables (eg, decisional confidence, feeling informed about prostate cancer and treatment, and treatment preference).  Results:   The PIES program was well accepted by patients and did not interfere with the clinical routine. About 79% of eligible patients (72/91) completed the pre- and post-PIES intervention assessments. Patients in the PIES groups compared with those in the control condition were significantly more likely to report higher levels of confidence in their treatment choices, higher levels of helpfulness of the information they received in making a treatment decision, and that the information they received was emotionally reassuring. Patients in the PIES groups compared with those in the control condition were significantly less likely to need more information about treatment options, were less anxious about their treatment choices, and thought the information they received was clear (P < .05). Tailoring PIES information to information-seeking style was not related to decision-making variables.  Conclusions:   This pilot study confirms that the implementation of PIES within a clinical practice is feasible and acceptable to patients with a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer. PIES improved key decision-making process variables and reduced the emotional impact of a difficult medical decision.""","""['Michael A Diefenbach', 'Nihal E Mohamed', 'Brian P Butz', 'Natan Bar-Chama', 'Richard Stock', 'Jamie Cesaretti', 'Waleed Hassan', 'David Samadi', 'Simon J Hall']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Med Internet Res""","""['Health literacy and shared decision making for prostate cancer patients with low socioeconomic status.', 'A Comprehensive 6-mo Prostate Cancer Patient Empowerment Program Decreases Psychological Distress Among Men Undergoing Curative Prostate Cancer Treatment: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Examining the impact of a multimedia intervention on treatment decision-making among newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients: results from a nationwide RCT.', 'Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions.', 'Current decision-making in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Digital Health Interventions for Adult Patients With Cancer Evaluated in Randomized Controlled Trials: Scoping Review.', 'Demographic and Psychosocial Characteristics Associated With Use of a Prostate Cancer Survivorship Website: Implications From a Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Differences in treatment choices between prostate cancer patients using a decision aid and patients receiving care as usual: results from a randomized controlled trial.', 'Head to head randomized trial of two decision aids for prostate cancer.', 'A Mobile Patient-Facing App for Tracking Patient-Reported Outcomes in Head and Neck Cancer Survivors: Single-Arm Feasibility Study.']"""

Molecules that are ligands for G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been implicated in ligand-independent androgen receptor (AR) activation. The purpose of this study was to examine whether CXCL12, the ligand for the GPCR, CXCR4, might mediate prostate cancer cell proliferation through AR-dependent mechanisms involving functional transactivation of the AR in the absence of androgen. The results of these studies showed that activation of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis promoted: The nuclear accumulation of both wild-type and mutant AR in several prostate epithelial cell lines; AR-dependent proliferative responses; nuclear accumulation of the AR co-regulator SRC-1 protein; SRC-1:AR protein:protein association; co-localization of AR and SRC-1 on the promoters of AR-regulated genes; AR- and SRC-1 dependent transcription of AR-regulated genes; AR-dependent secretion of the AR-regulated PSA protein; P13K-dependent phosphorylation of AR; MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of SRC-1, and both MAPK- and P13K-dependent secretion of the PSA protein, in the absence of androgen. Taken together, these studies identify CXCL12 as a novel, non-steroidal growth factor that promotes the growth of prostate epithelial cells through AR-dependent mechanisms in the absence of steroid hormones. These findings support the development of novel therapeutics targeting the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis as an ancillary to those targeting the androgen/AR axis to effectively treat castration resistant/recurrent prostate tumors.""","""['Sathish Kasina', 'Jill A Macoska']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Androgen Triggers the Pro-Migratory CXCL12/CXCR4 Axis in AR-Positive Breast Cancer Cell Lines: Underlying Mechanism and Possible Implications for the Use of Aromatase Inhibitors in Breast Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and chemokine receptors 4 and 7 form a signaling axis to regulate CXCL12-dependent cellular motility.', 'Induction of Kruppel-like factor 5 expression by androgens results in increased CXCR4-dependent migration of prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Experimental evidence of persistent androgen-receptor-dependency in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Expression profiling of mRNA and functional network analyses of genes regulated by human papilloma virus E6 and E7 proteins in HaCaT cells.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Androgen Receptor Activation in Glioblastoma Can Be Achieved by Ligand-Independent Signaling through EGFR-A Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'ING5 Inhibits Migration and Invasion of Esophageal Cancer Cells by Downregulating the IL-6/CXCL12 Signaling Pathway.']"""

We hypothesized that differential preoperative expectations might contribute to this finding. In the current study we compared expectations of patients undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy vs radical retropubic prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   A questionnaire on expectations regarding recovery was administered to 171 patients electing to undergo robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or radical retropubic prostatectomy from 2008 to 2010. We prospectively collected data on patient expectations before surgery. Differences between patients undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy vs radical retropubic prostatectomy were assessed with adjusted proportional odds models.  Results:   Patients who underwent robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (97) did not differ significantly from those treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy (74) in age, race, income, time between survey and surgery, and prostate specific antigen (p ≥0.4). Patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy had significantly higher clinical stage and Gleason grade disease (p ≤0.007). After adjusting for socioeconomic factors, clinical stage and grade on multivariate analysis, patients who underwent robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy expected a significantly shorter length of stay (OR 0.07, p <0.001) and earlier return to physical activity (OR 0.36, p = 0.005). The choice of robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (OR 0.41, p = 0.012), younger age (OR 0.49, p = 0.001) and higher preoperative International Index of Erectile Function-5-item version score (OR 0.60, p = 0.017) were independently associated with the expectation of earlier return of erections but not of continence on multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   The body of evidence surrounding robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy supports shorter hospitalization but there is no conclusive evidence that the robotic approach results in earlier return to physical activity or improved disease specific outcomes.

Using data from a prospective clinical trial we compared bone mineral density and fracture between African-American and Caucasian men receiving androgen deprivation therapy.  Materials and methods:   A total of 516 subjects were in the placebo group of a 2-year randomized placebo controlled fracture prevention trial, and were African-American (68) or Caucasian (448). We compared baseline characteristics, changes in bone mineral density and rates of new fractures between races.  Results:   Compared to Caucasian men, African-American men had higher baseline hip bone mineral density (mean ± SD 0.98 ± 0.15 vs 0.91 ± 0.15 gm/m(2), p = 0.001) and similar spine bone mineral density (1.09 ± 0.22 vs 1.11 ± 0.22, p = 0.51). There was no difference in prevalent vertebral fractures between African-American and Caucasian men (7.4% vs 15.0%, p = 0.13). The percentage change in hip bone mineral density at 2 years was similar between African-American and Caucasian men (mean ± SE -2.21% ± 0.59% vs -2.54% ± 0.26%, p = 0.65). Changes in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine were also similar between African-American and Caucasian men (-1.74% ± 0.69% vs -1.30% ± 0.33%, p = 0.64). No new vertebral fractures were reported in African-American men but 2 fractures were reported in Caucasian men.  Conclusions:   In a clinical trial African-American men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer have a greater hip bone mineral density and tended to have fewer prevalent vertebral fractures than Caucasian men.

Methods:   We used data from the Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry linked with administrative data and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data to identify men with local or regional prostate cancer diagnosed during 2001 to 2004. We used multinomial logistic and hierarchical regression models to examine the patient, tumor, and facility characteristics associated with treatment in the VHA and, among older patients, used propensity score methods to compare primary therapy between the VHA and fee-for-service Medicare.  Results:   The rates of radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy varied substantially across VHA facilities. Among the VHA patients, older age, black race/ethnicity, and greater comorbidity were associated with receiving neither radical prostatectomy nor radiotherapy. Facilities with more black patients with prostate cancer had lower rates of radical prostatectomy, and those with less availability of external beam radiotherapy had lower radiotherapy rates. The adjusted rates of radiotherapy (39.7% vs 52.0%) and radical prostatectomy (12.1% vs 15.8%) were lower and the rates of receiving neither treatment greater (48.2% vs 32.2%) in the VHA versus fee-for-service Medicare (P < .001).  Conclusions:   In the VHA, the treatment rates varied substantially across facilities, and black men received less aggressive prostate cancer treatment than white men, suggesting factors other than patient preferences influence the treatment decisions.

If MRSI is to be used in targeting prostate cancer and therapy assessment, the impact of gold seeds on MRSI must be investigated. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of gold seeds on the quality of MRSI data acquired in phantom experiments.  Methods and materials:   A cylindrical plastic phantom with a spherical cavity 10 centimeters in diameter wss filled with water solution containing choline, creatine, and citrate. A gold seed fiducial marker was put near the center of the phantom mounted on a plastic stem. Spectra were acquired at 1.5 Tesla by use of a clinical MRSI sequence. The ratios of choline + creatine to citrate (CC/Ci) were compared in the presence and absence of gold seeds. Spectra in the vicinity of the gold seed were analyzed.  Results:   The maximum coefficient of variation of CC/Ci induced by the gold seed was found to be 10% in phantom experiments at 1.5 T.  Conclusion:   MRSI can be used in prostate radiotherapy in the presence of gold seed markers. Gold seeds cause small effects (in the order of the standard deviation) on the ratio of the metabolite's CC/Ci in the phantom study done on a 1.5-T scanner. It is expected that gold seed markers will have similar negligible effect on spectra from prostate patients. The maximum of 10% of variation in CC/Ci found in the phantom study also sets a limit on the threshold accuracy of CC/Ci values for deciding whether the tissue characterized by a local spectrum is considered malignant and whether it is a candidate for local boost in radiotherapy dose.""","""['Murshed Hossain', 'Timo Schirmer', 'Theresa Richardson', 'Lili Chen', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'Chang Ming Ma']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['A phase and frequency alignment protocol for 1H MRSI data of the prostate.', 'Temporal B0 field variation effects on MRSI of the human prostate at 7 T and feasibility of correction using an internal field probe.', 'Three-dimensional H-1 MR spectroscopic imaging of the in situ human prostate with high (0.24-0.7-cm3) spatial resolution.', '1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the prostate.', 'Proton MR spectroscopy of the prostate.', 'A Comparative Study on the Direct and Pulsed Current Electrodeposition of Cobalt-Substituted Hydroxyapatite for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Application.', 'Qualitative evaluation of fiducial markers for radiotherapy imaging.']"""

Methods and materials:   A 57-year-old male nonsmoker was originally diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma Group IIB in October 1999. Treatment was completed at an outside local hospital and consisted of hormone suppression, pelvic external beam radiation, and transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy with loose iodine-125 seeds.  Results:   The treatment was unremarkable for any complications, and immediate postimplant evaluation did not reveal any loose seeds. The patient remained clinically without evidence of disease and was asymptomatic until an isolated episode of hematuria in December 2009. Radiographic evaluation noted an incidental right lower lobe lung mass with a 4-mm hyperdensity slightly off-center. Biopsy confirmed Stage IB limited-stage small-cell lung cancer, and he underwent thoracic radiation with concurrent systemic chemotherapy. The mass remained mildly avid on a positron emission tomographic scan after treatment, and he underwent surgical evaluation with final pathology demonstrating no residual tumor but a metal rod-like implant consistent with a migrated radioactive brachytherapy seed.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first case of a long-term adverse sequela seen in the location of a migrated brachytherapy seed.

Objective:   Identify predictors of attendance for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and prostate biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Literature searches and interviews with men undergoing PSA testing and prostate biopsy formed the basis of a self-report questionnaire designed to identify predictors of health behaviour, which was completed by men eligible for PSA invitation and prostate biopsy. Multitrait scaling analyses established the final questionnaire content. This revised instrument was distributed to a new cohort of men before PSA testing and biopsy invitations were received. Ethical committee approval was obtained from Trent Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (MREC/01/4/025-21/06/2001).  Measurements:   Predictors of health behaviour and attendance rates for PSA test or prostate biopsy were measured. Associations between questionnaire scores and health behaviour (PSA and prostate biopsy attendance) were examined using logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   The provisional 49-item health behaviour questionnaire was completed by 468 of 810 men (57.8%). Multitrait scaling refined the questionnaire to 26 items in six scales (A: health benefits, B: threats to health, C: barriers to testing, D: health intentions, E: external influences, F: current general health). A total of 1455 of 2657 men (54.8%) completed the revised instrument before invitations for PSA test or biopsy were received; 395 (43.4%) and 434 (91.6%) attended. Strong associations between men's health intentions (scale D) and PSA and biopsy attendance (odds ratio: 1.56 or 3.67, respectively; p<0.001) were observed with modest associations between the other five scales and attendance for PSA testing. Average questionnaire response rates represent the major limitation of this study.

Studies from the United States and Canada have recently reported increasing numbers of hospitalizations for infectious complications after PNB.  Objective:   Examine the risk of infectious complications and hospital admissions after PNB in a European screening trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   From 1993 to 2011, 10 474 PNBs were performed in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (Rotterdam section). Prophylaxis originally consisted of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Beginning in 2008, it was changed to ciprofloxacin.  Measurements:   Febrile complications and hospital admissions were assessed by questionnaires 2 wk after PNB. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for biopsy-related fever and hospital admission.  Results and limitations:   Fever and hospital admission were reported on 392 of 9241 questionnaires (4.2%) and 78 of 9198 questionnaires (0.8%), respectively. Although most fevers were managed on an outpatient basis, 81% of hospital admissions were for infection. Of the 56 available blood cultures, 34 were positive with Escherichia coli as the predominant organism. On multivariable analysis, prostate enlargement and diabetes were significantly associated with an increased risk of fever after PNB, whereas later year of biopsy was the only factor significantly associated with an increased risk of hospital admission.  Conclusions:   In a European screening trial, <5% PNBs resulted in febrile complications. Significant risk factors included diabetes and prostatic enlargement. Although most fevers were managed on an outpatient basis, infection remained the leading cause of hospital admission after PNB. Consistent with prior international reports, the frequency of hospital admissions after PNB significantly increased over time. Nevertheless, the absolute frequency of hospital admissions related to PNB was low and should not dissuade healthy men who would benefit from early prostate cancer diagnosis from undergoing biopsy when clinically indicated.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Suzanne van den Heuvel', 'Xiaoye Zhu', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Fritz H Schröder', 'Monique J Roobol']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['To biopsy or not to biopsy--thou shall think twice.', 'Re: Infectious complications and hospital admissions after prostate biopsy in a European randomized trial.', 'Increasing risk of infectious complications after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: time to reassess antimicrobial prophylaxis?', 'Complications of initial prostate biopsy in a European randomized screening trial.', 'Povidone Iodine Rectal Preparation at Time of Prostate Needle Biopsy is a Simple and Reproducible Means to Reduce Risk of Procedural Infection.', 'Antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'A systematic method introduced a common lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in the different stages of prostate cancer.', 'Protocol of a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing transperineal prostate biopsy to reduce infectiouscomplications.', 'Reliability of prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2.1 for excluding clinically significant prostate cancer using a 1.5 tesla scanner.', 'Cost Effectiveness of Rectal Culture-based Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Transrectal Prostate Biopsy: The Results from a Randomized, Nonblinded, Multicenter Trial.', 'Common errors, pitfalls, and management of complications of prostate biopsy : The most common diagnostic and procedural challenges of transrectal fusion prostate biopsy in the initial diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer.']"""

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in Western men and, for advanced disease, no curative agents are available. For men with high-risk localised disease there is debate about the best treatment approaches, with both radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy shown to improve outcomes. These approaches have started to be augmented as new techniques and therapies are developed. For instance, radiation therapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy has been shown to be more efficacious than radiation therapy alone, and there may also be a role for adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ultimately a multidisciplinary approach will most probably result in the best outcomes for patients. The use of androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer needs to be monitored carefully, given that it results in adverse alterations in several metabolic parameters and an increased risk of further coronary events in men with cardiovascular disease in some studies. Until recently there were limited options for the management of men with advanced prostate cancer, but new agents for use in the post-docetaxel setting have recently been approved. These are cabazitaxel and abiraterone acetate, which have both shown a significant survival benefit in patients who have progressed on docetaxel. Additional agents, for these patients and for patients at other stages of disease, are in the later stages of development. The development of new agents has been aided by a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance to current therapies and the recognition of new pathophysiological pathways. As the number of available therapeutic options increases, it will become increasingly important to tailor treatments to the individual patient. This may require the development of novel biomarkers or the use of existing or new predictive tools based on prognostic factors. To ensure optimal patient care, early and continuous involvement of the multidisciplinary team will be required.""","""['Joaquim Bellmunt', 'Gerhardt Attard', 'Amit Bahl', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Laurence Klotz', 'Deborah Kuban', 'Stéphane Oudard', 'William Watson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Practical aspects of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer management: patient case studies.', 'EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on Prostate Cancer.

It is felt that the introduction of widespread prostate-specific antigen testing is responsible for most patients with prostate cancer now being diagnosed with asymptomatic, clinically localised disease. Diagnosis at this stage is associated with significantly improved treatment outcomes and longer life expectancy. Although there is evidence that screening has reduced prostate cancer mortality, there is a risk of over-diagnosis and over-treatment of early state prostate cancers, including clinically insignificant and indolent cancers. Active surveillance and focal therapy have been advocated as potential management options for some patients. However, these approaches face several challenges. Biopsy sampling errors together with less than optimal imaging of tumours can lead to difficulties in selecting suitable low-risk patients for these options. To overcome these challenges, novel approaches to the staging and monitoring of patients with early prostate cancer are being developed. These include new imaging techniques, such as multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, and the development of new biomarkers and biopsy-based methods.

These cases were used to discuss the practical aspects of the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Particular emphasis was placed on audience participation with potential management options posed as interactive questions to the delegates. This paper summarises these case studies and the related discussion. Docetaxel is the standard first-line chemotherapeutic agent for patients with mCRPC and, until recently, second-line therapeutic options were limited. Results from the recently completed TROPIC trial showed a statistically and clinically significant improvement in overall survival with the microtubule inhibitor cabazitaxel compared with mitoxantrone. Cabazitaxel has been shown to be well tolerated and has been approved in Europe and the USA as second-line chemotherapy for mCRPC. Prognostic factors have a potential benefit in individualised patient management in mCRPC. Pretreatment prognostic factors, including PSA doubling time, pain, visceral metastases, anaemia and progression of osseous metastases, have been shown to predict survival outcomes and can be used to guide treatment strategies, including appropriate timing of chemotherapy. Multiple treatment options and significant heterogeneity among patients with advanced prostate cancer necessitate multidisciplinary team management in addition to patient education, as part of a patient-centred approach. The development of second-line chemotherapeutic agents together with the use of prognostic factors and a patient-centred multidisciplinary team approach provide encouraging new management prospects for patients with mCRPC.""","""['Amit Bahl', 'Joaquim Bellmunt', 'Stéphane Oudard']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Current and emerging treatment modalities for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Maximizing outcomes in genitourinary cancers across the treatment continuum.', 'Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: dawn of a new age of management.', 'Chemotherapy-based treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'TROPIC: Phase III trial of cabazitaxel for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   This descriptive, pattern of care study was carried out via an online questionnaire. The survey was sent to a total of 95 cancer care centres in Spain.  Results:   Seventy-three centres (76.8%) responded to the survey. More than half (57.5%) of responding centres offered brachytherapy (BT). A mean of 120 patients/centre were treated by BT in 2007. The most common localisations were the endometrium (29.6% of cases), prostate (29.6%), cervix uteri (14.6%), breast (12.6%), head and neck (3.6%) and vagina (2.5%). Other sites accounted for less than 2% of cases each. Most centres that offered BT (33/40 = 82.5%) were equipped with a dedicated BT operating room. The most commonly reported dosimetric method was CT dosimetry (31 of 40 centres = 77.5%), followed by plain film (30/40 = 75%), ultrasound (26/40 = 65%), MRI (8/40 = 20%), in vivo (7/40 = 17.5%) and PET-CT (5/40 = 12.5%) dosimetry.  Conclusion:   The three most common treatment sites (gynaecological, breast and prostate) remain unchanged from 2002, with prostate treatments showing large increase. Advanced dosimetric techniques (MRI, PET-CT and CT-dosimetry) continue to gain adherents. Some centres treat small numbers of patients, a finding that deserves more attention in terms of cost and quality of care. Although BT remains strong in Spain, it could be further strengthened by making modern dosimetric techniques and treatments more widely available.""","""['Ferran Guedea', 'José López-Torrecilla', 'Bradley Londres', 'Montse Ventura', 'Pedro Bilbao', 'Josep M Borràs']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Patterns of care for brachytherapy in Europe: updated results.', 'Brachytherapy in the United Kingdom and Spain: a subset analysis of a European pattern of care survey.', 'Overview of brachytherapy resources in Latin America: a patterns-of-care survey.', 'Place of modern imaging in brachytherapy planning.', 'Brachytherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer: A survey of UK provision of care and support.', 'A review of the clinical experience in pulsed dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Patterns of care of radiotherapy in México.', 'Promises and pitfalls of new technology in radiotherapy.']"""

CureVac's mRNA vaccines contain free and protamine-complexed mRNA. Such two-component mRNA vaccines support both antigen expression and immune stimulation. These self-adjuvanting RNA vaccines, administered intradermally without any additional adjuvant, induce a comprehensive balanced immune response, comprising antigen specific CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells. The balanced immune response results in a strong anti-tumor effect and complete protection against antigen positive tumor cells. This tumor inhibition elicited by mRNA vaccines is a result of the concerted action of different players. After just two intradermal vaccinations, we observe multiple changes at the tumor site, including the up-regulation of many genes connected to T and natural killer cell activation, as well as genes responsible for improved infiltration of immune cells into the tumor via chemotaxis. The two-component mRNA vaccines induce a very fast and boostable immune response. Therefore, the vaccination schedules can be adjusted to suit the clinical situation. Moreover, by combining the mRNA vaccines with therapies in clinical use (chemotherapy or anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy), an even more effective anti-tumor response can be elicited. The first clinical data obtained from two separate Phase I/IIa trials conducted in PCA (prostate cancer) and NSCLC (non-small cell lung carcinoma) patients have shown that the two-component mRNA vaccines are safe, well tolerated and highly immunogenic in humans.""","""['Mariola Fotin-Mleczek', 'Kai Zanzinger', 'Regina Heidenreich', 'Christina Lorenz', 'Andreas Thess', 'Katharina M Duchardt', 'Karl-Josef Kallen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Gene Med""","""['When transgenes shape immunity: cancer immune-gene therapy.', 'Messenger RNA-based vaccines with dual activity induce balanced TLR-7 dependent adaptive immune responses and provide antitumor activity.', 'In vivo effects of vaccination with six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate: a candidate antigen for treating prostate cancer.', 'Vaccination with an adenoviral vector encoding the tumor antigen directly linked to invariant chain induces potent CD4(+) T-cell-independent CD8(+) T-cell-mediated tumor control.', 'Advances in specific immunotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Cytotoxic immunotherapy strategies for cancer: mechanisms and clinical development.', 'Nanomaterials for mRNA-based therapeutics: Challenges and opportunities.', 'Optimised Non-Coding Regions of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine CV2CoV Improves Homologous and Heterologous Neutralising Antibody Responses.', 'mRNA as a Therapeutics: Understanding mRNA Vaccines.', 'mRNA-based therapeutics: powerful and versatile tools to combat diseases.', 'Delivery of mRNA for regulating functions of immune cells.']"""

Experimental design:   Prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, PC-3, LuCaP 23.1, and DU-145) were xenografted subcutaneously into immunodeficient pfp(-/-)/rag2(-/-) mice. Tumor growth and metastasis formation were quantified and as altered glycosylation patterns have been associated with metastasis formation in several other malignancies, prostate cancer cells were profiled by a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) glycosylation array and compared with normal human prostate cells. The activity of upregulated glycosyltransferases was analyzed by their sugar residues end products using lectin histochemistry on primary tumors and metastases in the animal experiments and on 2,085 clinical samples.  Results:   PC-3 cells produced the largest number of spontaneous lung metastases, followed by LNCaP and LuCaP 23.1, whereas DU-145 was nonmetastatic. qRT-PCR revealed an upregulation of β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-5b (Mgat5b) in all prostate cancer cell lines. Mgat5b products [β(1,6)-branched oligosaccharides] were predominantly detectable in metastatic xenografts as shown by increased binding of Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin (PHA-L). The percentage of prostate cancer patients who were PHA-L positive was 86.5. PHA-L intensity correlated with serum prostate-specific antigen and a cytoplasmic staining negatively affected disease-free survival.  Conclusion:   We show a novel xenograft mouse model for human prostate cancer respecting the complete metastatic cascade. Specific glycosylation patterns reveal Mgat5b products as relevant markers of both metastatic competence in mice and disease-free survival in patients.

Mycobacterium abscessus was cultured from the debridement specimens, and acid-fast-positive bacilli were identified histologically within the prostates. All 180 radical prostatectomy specimens from May 2007 to June 2009 were reviewed, and 7 additional cases with morphologies suspicious of M. abscessus granulomatous prostatitis (MAGP) were identified. The characteristic morphologic feature of MAGP was suppurative necrotizing granulomatous inflammation extensively (10% to 80% of the gland; mean, 39%) involving the prostate. The centers of MAGP were large areas of neutrophilic abscess and necrotic debris, which were surrounded by histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, scattered multinucleated giant cells, and eosinophils. In the adjacent areas, there was a lobular extension of mixed inflammatory infiltrates into dilated and ruptured ducts. Involvement of extraprostatic soft tissue and seminal vesicles/vas deferens was found in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. Acid-fast-positive bacilli were identified in 5 radical prostatectomies. Eleven patients had fresh tissue specimens stored at -150°C, and M. abscessus was cultured from 8 prostates. Random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction showed the same clone for all isolates. After prostatectomy, 8 patients experienced prolonged wound healing, with urethrorectal fistula formation in 1 patient and a pelvic abscess in another.

However, the functions of δ-catenin in epithelial cells and carcinomas remain elusive. We found that prostate cancer cells overexpressing δ-catenin show an increase in multi-layer growth in culture. In these cells, δ-catenin colocalizes with E-cadherin at the plasma membrane, and the E-cadherin processing is noticeably elevated. E-Cadherin processing induced by δ-catenin is serum-dependent and requires MMP- and PS-1/γ-secretase-mediated activities. A deletion mutant of δ-catenin that deprives the ability of δ-catenin to bind E-cadherin or to recruit PS-1 to E-cadherin totally abolishes the δ-catenin-induced E-cadherin processing and the multi-layer growth of the cells. In addition, prostate cancer cells overexpressing δ-catenin display an elevated total β-catenin level and increase its nuclear distribution, resulting in the activation of β-catenin/LEF-1-mediated transcription and their downstream target genes as well as androgen receptor-mediated transcription. Indeed, human prostate tumor xenograft in nude mice, which is derived from cells overexpressing δ-catenin, shows increased β-catenin nuclear localization and more rapid growth rates. Moreover, the metastatic xenograft tumor weights positively correlate with the level of 29kD E-cadherin fragment, and primary human prostate tumor tissues also show elevated levels of δ-catenin expression and the E-cadherin processing.

It has been demonstrated that BN analogues can be radiolabeled for potential diagnosis and treatment of GRPR-expressing malignancies. Previous studies have conjugated various chelators to the eight C-terminal amino acids of BN [BN(7-14)] for radiolabeling with 64Cu. Recently, (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) (NOTA) has been evaluated as the five-coordinate 64Cu complex, with results indicating GRPR-specific tumor uptake. This study aimed to conjugate S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-NOTA (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA) to BN(7-14) such that it could form a six-coordinate complex with 64Cu and to evaluate the resulting peptide.  Methods:   p-SCN-NOTA was conjugated to 8-aminooctanoic acid (Aoc)-BN(7-14) in solution to yield NOTA-Bn-SCN-Aoc-BN(7-14). The unlabeled peptide was evaluated in a cell binding assay using PC-3 prostate cancer cells and 125I-Tyr4-BN to determine the IC50 value. The peptide was radiolabeled with 64Cu and evaluated for internalization into PC-3 cells and for tumor uptake in mice bearing PC-3 xenografts using biodistribution and micro-positron emission tomography imaging studies.  Results:   The binding assay demonstrated that NOTA-Bn-SCN-Aoc-BN(7-14) bound with high affinity to GRPR with an IC50 of 1.4 nM. The radiolabeled peptide demonstrated time-dependent internalization into PC-3 cells. In vivo, the peptide demonstrated tumor-specific uptake and imaging that were comparable to those of previously reported 64Cu-labeled BN analogues.

We aimed to assess the reliability of detecting PCA from the expression of P-STAT3 in prostate tissue previously designated as a negative biopsy.  Methods:   Prostate tissues were obtained from the biopsies of 52 patients with localized PCA as well as from the biopsies of 80 patients free of PCA. Expression of P-STAT3 in these specimens was examined by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and used to distinguish tissue with PCA from tissue designated as benign during a biopsy procedure.  Results:   P-STAT3 staining intensities in all samples (initial negative biopsies, cancer positive cores and other negative cores from the same-batch biopsies) of PCA patients was significantly higher than that of benign patients (F = 23.664, P < 0.001). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve showed that the area under curve (AUC) for P-STAT3 staining was 0.785. When positive immuno-labeling of P-STAT3 in samples from initial biopsies was used as a marker for PCA, it showed relatively high sensitivity (80.8%) and specificity (76.3%).  Conclusions:   IHC of P-STAT3 could be utilized to detect PCA patients with initial negative biopsies. As a result, it can be a potential adjunctive tool for current PCA diagnostic programs. P-STAT3 can predict the onset of PCA up to 40 months earlier than currently used diagnostic approaches.""","""['G Han', 'J Y Yu', 'Y D Chen', 'X L Cao', 'J Zhu', 'W Wang', 'X X Wang', 'X Zhang', 'J Q Yan', 'J P Gao']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur J Surg Oncol""","""['Early prostate cancer antigen expression in predicting presence of prostate cancer in men with histologically negative biopsies.', 'Positive predictive value of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in initial core needle biopsies of prostate adenocarcinoma--a study with complete sampling of hemi-prostates with corresponding negative biopsy findings.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Activated STAT3 as a correlate of distant metastasis in prostate cancer: a secondary analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 86-10.', 'Tissue microarray analysis of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) and phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) in node-negative breast cancer shows nuclear localization is associated with a better prognosis.', 'Biomarkers in previous histologically negative prostate biopsies can be helpful in repeat biopsy decision-making processes.', 'Expression of tSTAT3, pSTAT3727 , and pSTAT3 705 in the epithelial cells of hormone-naïve prostate cancer.', 'STAT3 and STAT5A are potential therapeutic targets in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of STAT3 post-translational modifications (PTMs) in human prostate cancer with different Gleason Score.', 'Castration-resistant prostate cancer: potential targets and therapies.']"""

We studied our single-center experience of developing a LRP service and subsequent training of two additional surgeons by the initial surgeon. We assessed the learning curve of the three surgeons with regard to perioperative outcomes and oncologic results.  Patients and methods:   Three hundred consecutive patients underwent a LRP between January 2005 and April 2011. Patients were divided into three equal groups (1-100 group 1], 101-200 [group 2], and 201-300 [group 3]). Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, preoperative comorbidities, and indications for LRP were comparable for all three patient groups. Perioperative and oncologic outcomes were compared across all three groups to assess the impact of the learning curve for LRP. All surgical complications were classified using the Clavien-Dindo system (CDS).  Results:   The mean age was 61.9 years (range 46-74 y). There was a significant reduction in the mean operative time (P<0.05), mean blood loss (P<0.05), mean duration of hospital stay (P<0.05), and duration of catherization (P<0.05) between the three groups as the series progressed. The two most important factors predictive of positive surgical margins at LRP were the initial prostate-specific antigen level and tumor stage at diagnosis. The overall positive margin rate was 27.7%. For pT(2) tumors, the positive margin rate was 21%, while patients with pT(3) tumors had a positive margin of 44%. For pT(2) tumors, positive margin rates decreased with increasing experience (group 1, 27% vs group 2, 17% vs group 3, 19%). The incidence of major complications--ie, grade CDS score ≤ III--was 4.6% (14/300).  Conclusion:   LRP is a safe procedure with low morbidity. As surgeons progress through the learning curve, perioperative parameters and oncologic outcomes improve. Using a carefully mentored approach, LRP can be safely introduced as a new procedure without compromising patient outcomes.""","""['Nikhil Vasdev', 'Antoine Kass-Iliyya', 'Ameet Patel', 'Geoff Bedford', ""Anna O'Riordon"", 'Mark I Johnson', 'Garrett C Durkan', 'Naeem A Soomro']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Impact of a low-volume laparoscopic radical prostatectomy learning curve on perioperative outcomes: is it acceptable?', 'Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus open: comparison of the learning curve of a single surgeon.', 'Evaluating the learning curve of experienced laparoscopic surgeons in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal approach to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: an assessment of 156 cases.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: is it feasible and reasonable?', 'Learning curves in laparoscopic and robot-assisted prostate surgery: a systematic search and review.', 'Developing a robotic prostatectomy service and a robotic fellowship programme - defining the learning curve.', 'Analysis of the pentafecta learning curve for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of a learning curve model in kidney transplantation on functional outcome and surgical complications in a small volume centre: does size really matter?']"""

Methods and results:   A cohort of 59 CRPC patients was investigated for ERG rearrangements, PTEN deletions and androgen receptor (AR) amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. SPINK1 overexpression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. ERG rearrangements and PTEN deletions were detected in 22 of 53 (41.5%) and 35 of 55 (63.6%) of cases, with 15 of 22 (68.1%) of ERG rearrangements occurring through deletions. SPINK1 overexpression occurred in three of 51 (5.8%) of cases exclusively in non-ERG rearranged and AR amplification was detected in 12 of 49 (24.4%) of cases. Only PTEN deletions showed intrafocal heterogeneity occurring in nine of 35 (25.7%) of cases. PTEN deletions were significantly associated with each of ERG rearrangements occurring by deletions only (P = 0.001), AR amplification (P = 0.002) and SPINK1 overexpression (P = 0.002). None of the SPINK1 overexpressing tumours showed AR amplification (P = 0.005) and all occurred in PTEN deleted foci (P = 0.002).

Urinary incontinence is one of the major drawbacks of radical prostatectomy, regardless of the procedure used (i.e. open, laparoscopic or robotic-assisted). Several technical modifications have been described to improve postoperative continence, highlighting the role of puboprostatic ligaments and posterior reconstruction of the rhabdomyosphincter. The results obtained are inconsistent when applied to robotic surgery. The present multicentre randomized study shows that anterior suspension combined with posterior reconstruction is a safe and easy-to-perform technique for improving early continence after robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.  Objective:   To assess the impact on urinary continence of anterior retropubic suspension with posterior reconstruction during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).  Patients and methods:   In total, 72 patients who were due to undergo prostatectomy between July 2009 and July 2010 were prospectively randomized into two groups: group A underwent a standard RALP procedure and group B had anterior suspension and posterior reconstruction during RALP. The primary outcome measure was urinary continence, assessed using the University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index questionnaire at 15 days, and at 1, 3 and 6 months, after surgery. Other data recorded were operation duration, blood loss, length of hospital stay, duration of bladder catheterization, complications and positive margin rate.  Results:   The continence rates at 15 days, and at 1, 3 and 6 months, after surgery were 3.6%, 7.1%, 15.4% and 57.9%, respectively, in group A, and 5.9%, 26.5%, 45.2% and 65.4%, respectively, in group B. The continence rates differed statistically between groups at 1 and 3 months (P = 0.047 and P = 0.016, respectively). There was no significant difference between groups regarding complications (P = 0.8) or positive margin rate (P = 0.46).  Conclusion:   Anterior suspension associated with posterior reconstruction during RALP improved the early return of continence, without increasing complications.""","""['Xavier Hurtes', 'Morgan Rouprêt', 'Christophe Vaessen', 'Helder Pereira', ""Benjamin Faivre d'Arcier"", 'Luc Cormier', 'Franck Bruyère']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Commentary on ""anterior suspension combined with posterior reconstruction during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy improves early return of urinary continence: A prospective randomized multicentre trial.""

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The study compares the sexual function of men with low-risk prostate cancer who chose active surveillance (expectant management) with similar men who received radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy. The first group appeared to be sexually active more frequently and had less erectile dysfunction. The study was non-randomized. No other studies exist on the effect of active surveillance on sexual function vs other treatment methods.  Objective:   To compare sexual function of men with localized prostate cancer (PCa) on active surveillance (AS) with similar patients who received radical therapy.  Patients and methods:   Two groups of men with screening-detected localized PCa were compared. The first were men on AS within the prospective protocol-based Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance study. The second were men participating in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer study who had received radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT). • Questionnaires were completed at two different timepoints after diagnosis or treatment (6 and 12-18 months). These contained 10 items on sexual function, the mental and physical component summary from the Short-Form 12-item health survey, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale depression measure and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory general anxiety measure. • Sexual function was compared between groups, and determinants were analysed in multivariable analysis, adjusting for baseline differences.  Results:   A total of 65-68% of men on AS, 35-36% of those who underwent RP, 36-37% of those who underwent RT and 36% of men in the RP and RT groups combined (combined Tx) were sexually active. • A total of 20-30% of men in the AS group, 86-91% of men in the RP group, 56-60% of men in the RT group and 71-76% of men in the combined Tx group were sexually inactive as a result of erectile dysfunction. • A total of 44-51% of men in the AS group, 96% of men in the RP group, 73-76% of men in the RT group and 84-85% of men in the combined Tx group who were sexually active had problems getting or keeping an erection. • In multivariable analysis these differences were significant, except for AS vs RT.  Conclusions:   Men with localized PCa on AS were more often sexually active than similar men who received radical therapy, especially RP. If not sexually active, this was less often attributable to erectile dysfunction for those on AS. If sexually active, this was less often associated with problems getting or keeping an erection for those on AS. • The study was non-randomized; the latest advances in RP and RT might impact results.""","""['Roderick C N van den Bergh', 'Ida J Korfage', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Harry J de Koning', 'Ewout W Steyerberg', 'Marie-Louise Essink-Bot']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Can sexual bother after radical prostatectomy be predicted preoperatively?

Limited information is available on national and state assessments of health behaviors among cancer survivors. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), this report provides a descriptive state-level assessment of demographic characteristics and health behaviors among cancer survivors aged ≥18 years.  Reporting period covered:   2009  Description of system:   BRFSS is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged ≥18 years. BRFSS collects information on health risk behaviors and use of preventive health services related to leading causes of death and morbidity. In 2009, BRFSS added questions about previous cancer diagnoses to the core module. The 2009 BRFSS also included an optional cancer survivorship module that assessed cancer treatment history and health insurance coverage for cancer survivors. In 2009, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands administered the core cancer survivorship questions, and 10 states administered the optional supplemental cancer survivorship module. Five states added questions on mammography and Papanicolaou (Pap) test use, eight states included questions on colorectal screening, and five states included questions on prostate cancer screening.  Results:   An estimated 7.2% of the U.S. general population aged ≥18 years reported having received a previous cancer diagnosis (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer). A total of 78.8% of cancer survivors were aged ≥50 years, and 39.2% had received a diagnosis of cancer >10 years previously. A total of 57.8% reported receiving an influenza vaccination during the previous year, and 48.3% reported ever receiving a pneumococcal vaccination. At the time of the interview, 6.8% of cancer survivors had no health insurance, and 12% had been denied health insurance, life insurance, or both because of their cancer diagnosis. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease was higher among male cancer survivors (23.4%) than female cancer survivors (14.3%), as was the prevalence of diabetes (19.6% and 14.7%, respectively). Overall, approximately 15.1% of cancer survivors were current cigarette smokers, 27.5% were obese, and 31.5% had not engaged in any leisure-time physical activity during the past 30 days. Demographic characteristics and health behaviors among cancer survivors varied substantially by state.  Interpretation:   Health behaviors and preventive health care practices among cancer survivors vary by state and demographic characteristics. A large proportion of cancer survivors have comorbid conditions, currently smoke, do not participate in any leisure-time physical activity, and are obese. In addition, many are not receiving recommended preventive care, including cancer screening and influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations.  Public health action:   Health-care providers and patients should be aware of the importance of preventive care, smoking cessation, regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight for cancer survivors. The findings in this report can help public health practitioners, researchers, and comprehensive cancer control programs evaluate the effectiveness of program activities for cancer survivors, assess the needs of cancer survivors at the state level, and allocate appropriate resources to address those needs.""","""['J Michael Underwood', 'Julie S Townsend', 'Sherri L Stewart', 'Natasha Buchannan', 'Donatus U Ekwueme', 'Nikki A Hawkins', 'Jun Li', 'Brandy Peaker', 'Lori A Pollack', 'Thomas B Richards', 'Sun Hee Rim', 'Elizabeth A Rohan', 'Susan A Sabatino', 'Judith L Smith', 'Eric Tai', 'George-Ann Townsend', 'Arica White', 'Temeika L Fairley;Division of Cancer Prevention and Control', ' National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""MMWR Surveill Summ""","""['State-specific prevalence of selected chronic disease-related characteristics--Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2001.', 'Surveillance of certain health behaviors and conditions among states and selected local areas --- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, United States, 2009.', 'Surveillance for certain health behaviors among States and selected local areas - United States, 2010.', 'Health behaviors, medical care, and interventions to promote healthy living in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort.', 'Overview and Methods for the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System - United States, 2019.', 'Benefits of nature-based walking for breast cancer survivors.', 'Prevalence of health behaviors among cancer survivors in the United States.', 'Factors associated with successful smoking cessation in men with or without cardiovascular disease or cancer: Nationwide Korean population analysis.', 'Health behaviors, obesity, and marital status among cancer survivors: a MEPS study.', 'Do lifestyle factors influence risk of breast cancer recurrence in Korean women?: a cross-sectional survey.']"""

In this disease, aggressive disease phenotypes and hormone therapy failures result from resurgent activity of androgen receptor (AR) and the upregulation of coactivator protein p300 and pioneer factors (e.g., GATA2 and FOXA1). Thus, a major emphasis in the field is to identify mechanisms by which castrate-resistant AR activity and pioneer factor function can be combinatorially suppressed. Here we show that the turmeric spice isoflavone curcumin suppresses p300 and CBP occupancy at sites of AR function. Curcumin reduced the association of histone acetylation and pioneer factors, thereby suppressing AR residence and downstream target gene expression. Histone deacetylase inhibitors reversed the effects of curcumin on AR activity, further underscoring the impact of curcumin on altering the chromatin landscape. These functions precluded pioneer factor occupancy, leading ultimately to a suppression of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent AR residence on chromatin. Moreover, these functions were conserved even in cells with heightened pioneer factor activity, thus identifying a potential strategy to manage this subclass of tumors. Biological relevance was further identified using in vivo xenograft models mimicking disease progression. Curcumin cooperated in vivo with androgen deprivation as indicated by a reduction in tumor growth and delay to the onset of castrate-resistant disease. Together, our results show the combinatorial impact of targeting AR and histone modification in prostate cancer, thus setting the stage for further development of curcumin as a novel agent to target AR signaling.""","""['Supriya Shah', 'Shikha Prasad', 'Karen E Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Three-tiered role of the pioneer factor GATA2 in promoting androgen-dependent gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'Shaping Chromatin States in Prostate Cancer by Pioneer Transcription Factors.', 'CCAR1 promotes chromatin loading of androgen receptor (AR) transcription complex by stabilizing the association between AR and GATA2.', 'Androgen receptor transcriptionally regulates semaphorin 3C in a GATA2-dependent manner.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Targeting HR Repair as a Synthetic Lethal Approach to Increase DNA Damage Sensitivity by a RAD52 Inhibitor in BRCA2-Deficient Cancer Cells.', 'Biochemistry, Safety, Pharmacological Activities, and Clinical Applications of Turmeric: A Mechanistic Review.', 'Plant Bioactives and the Prevention of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Human Studies.', 'The role of GATA2 in lethal prostate cancer aggressiveness.']"""

We observed that loss of mitochondrial genome reversibly induced overexpression and activation of proto-oncogenic Ras, especially K-Ras 4A, responsible for the activation of AKT and ERK leading to advanced phenotype of prostate and breast cancer. Ras activation was induced by the overexpression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. Hypoxia is known to induce proteasomal degradation of HMGR. Well differentiated prostate and breast cancer cells with high mitochondrial DNA content consumed a large amount of oxygen and induced hypoxia. Loss of mitochondrial genome reduced oxygen consumption and increased in oxygen concentration in the cells. The hypoxic-to-normoxic shift led to the overexpression of HMGR through inhibiting proteasomal degradation. Therefore, reduction of mitochondrial genome content induced overexpression of HMGR through hypoxic to normoxic shift and subsequently the endogenous induction of the mevalonate pathway activated Ras that mediates advanced phenotype. Reduction of mitochondrial genome content was associated with the aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer in vitro cell line model and tissue specimens in vivo.

Interestingly, levels of SM22 are often reduced in tumour cell lines, while they are increased during senescence possibly indicating a role for SM22 in cell fate decisions via its interaction with actin. In this study we aimed to determine whether reducing levels of SM22 could actively contribute to a tumourigenic phenotype.  Results:   We demonstrate that in REF52 fibroblasts, decreased levels of SM22 disrupt normal actin organization leading to changes in the motile behaviour of cells. Interestingly, SM22 depletion also led to an increase in the capacity of cells to spontaneously form podosomes with a concomitant increase in the ability to invade Matrigel. In PC3 prostate epithelial cancer cells by contrast, where SM22 is undetectable, re-expression of SM22 reduced the ability to invade Matrigel. Furthermore SM22 depleted cells also had reduced levels of reactive oxygen species when under serum starvation stress.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that depletion of SM22 could contribute to tumourigenic properties of cells.

High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is a risk factor for prostate cancer (PCa), but only multifocality is an indication for early rebiopsy. Other risk factors for PCa development from HGPIN remain unknown. PCa is related to testosterone. Testosterone has been proven to be linked to PCa detection and poor prognosis PCa. This study shows that low free and bioavailable testosterone levels are associated with an increased risk of PCa in a rebiopsy after HGPIN diagnosis. Men with low testosterone levels and HGPIN could therefore be considered a high-risk cohort for developing PCa.  Objective:   To determine the relevance of the hormonal profile of patients with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and its relationship to prostate cancer (PCa) in rebiopsy.  Patients and methods:   We prospectively analysed 82 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of HGPIN without PCa in a prostate biopsy between September 2007 and December 2009. Of these 82 patients, 45 underwent rebiopsy and their hormonal profile was determined (testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG]) as part of our clinical protocol. Patient age, PSA level, prostate volume, PSA density, testosterone, free testosterone, bioavailable testosterone and SHBG were recorded prospectively. A comparative study between those patients with a positive rebiopsy and those with a negative rebiopsy was performed.  Results:   We found that free testosterone (P = 0.04), bioavailable testosterone (P = 0.04) and SHBG (P = 0.02) were significantly associated with a positive rebiopsy. Other variables such as age (P = 0.745), PSA level (P = 0.630), prostate volume (P = 0.690), PSA density (P = 0.950), testosterone (P = 0.981) and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia multifocality (P = 0.777) were not associated with the presence of adenocarcinoma in the rebiopsy.  Conclusions:   Patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate after a diagnosis of HGPIN have higher SHBG levels and lower calculated free testosterone levels than patients with a negative rebiopsy.

Positive surgical margins (PSMs) after radical prostatectomy are common, although their impact on the risk of disease recurrence is unknown. We examined the impact of PSMs on the risk of 'significant' biochemical recurrence stratified by their risk of occult metastatic disease. We find that only in intermediate-risk disease does the presence of a PSM have a significant impact on the risk of recurrence, and this represents a failure of technique. By contrast, for high- and low-risk disease, the risk of recurrence is driven by intrinsic tumour biology, and the presence of a PSM has little impact on outcome.  Objective:   To determine the impact of surgical margin status on the risk of significant biochemical recurrence (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] doubling time <3, <6 or <9 months) after prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with complete clinical and pathological data and detailed PSA follow-up were identified from two prospectively recorded databases. Patients were stratified according to their risk of occult systemic disease (low risk: PSA < 10 ng/dL, pT2 stage and Gleason score ≤6; intermediate risk: PSA 10-20 ng/dL, pT2 stage and/or Gleason score 7; high: PSA > 20 ng/dL or pT3-4 stage or Gleason score 8-10) and the impact of a positive surgical margin (PSM) within each stratum determined by univariable and multivariable analysis.  Results:   Of 1514 patients identified, 276 (18.2%), 761 (50.3%) and 477 (31.5%) were classified as having low-, intermediate- and high-risk disease respectively. A total of 370 (24.4%) patients had a PSM and with a median follow-up of 22.2 months, and 165 (7%) patients had a biochemical recurrence. Sufficient PSA data was available to calculate PSA doubling times in 151/165 patients (91.5%). The PSM rate rose significantly, from 11% in low-risk to 43% in high-risk disease (P < 0.001), with similar positive associations noted with tumour grade, stage and serum PSA (P < 0.001). Patients with low-risk disease had essentially identical risks of significant biochemical recurrence over the study period, regardless of surgical margin status. By contrast, in patients with both intermediate- and high-risk disease, a PSM was a strong predictor of significant biochemical recurrence on univariable analysis. On multivariable analysis, howver, PSM predicted significant disease recurrence in intermediate-risk disease only.

In cancer cells, this balance is shifted towards MMPs, promoting ECM degradation. Here, we show that EZH2 plays an active role in this process by repressing the expression of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in prostate cancer cells. The TIMP genes are derepressed by knockdown of EZH2 expression in human prostate cancer cells but repressed by overexpression of EZH2 in benign human prostate epithelial cells. EZH2 catalyzes H3K27 trimethylation and subsequent DNA methylation of the TIMP gene promoters. Overexpression of EZH2 confers an invasive phenotype on benign prostate epithelial cells; however, this phenotype is suppressed by cooverexpression of TIMP3. EZH2 knockdown markedly reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9, thereby decreasing the invasive activity of prostate cancer cells. These results suggest that the transcriptional repression of the TIMP genes by EZH2 may be a major mechanism to shift the MMPs/TIMPs balance in favor of MMP activity and thus to promote ECM degradation and subsequent invasion of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Yong Jae Shin', 'Jeong-Ho Kim']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Green tea-induced epigenetic reactivation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 suppresses prostate cancer progression through histone-modifying enzymes.', 'Polycomb protein EZH2 regulates tumor invasion via the transcriptional repression of the metastasis suppressor RKIP in breast and prostate cancer.', 'Alterations in enhancer of zeste homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 expression are associated with ex vivo and in vitro bone metastasis in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 in invasive pituitary adenomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control trials.', 'Aberrations of EZH2 in cancer.', 'Apelin Promotes Prostate Cancer Metastasis by Downregulating TIMP2 via Increases in miR-106a-5p Expression.', 'PRC2 loss drives MPNST metastasis and matrix remodeling.', 'The Effect of Encapsulated Apigenin Nanoparticles on HePG-2 Cells through Regulation of P53.', 'The Role and Mechanism of Lysine Methyltransferase and Arginine Methyltransferase in Kidney Diseases.', 'Mechanisms of Polycomb group protein function in cancer.']"""

Androgen deprivation therapy is initially effective in CaP treatment, but CaP recurs despite castrate levels of circulating androgen. Continued expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and its ligands has been linked to castration-recurrent CaP growth.  Principal finding:   In this report, the ligand-dependent dominant-negative ARΔ142-337 (ARΔTR) was expressed in castration-recurrent CWR-R1 cell and tumor models to elucidate the role of AR signaling. Expression of ARΔTR decreased CWR-R1 tumor growth in the presence and absence of exogenous testosterone (T) and improved survival in the presence of exogenous T. There was evidence for negative selection of ARΔTR transgene in T-treated mice. Mass spectrometry revealed castration-recurrent CaP dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels sufficient to activate AR and ARΔTR. In the absence of exogenous testosterone, CWR-R1-ARΔTR and control cells exhibited altered androgen profiles that implicated epithelial CaP cells as a source of intratumoral AR ligands.  Conclusion:   The study provides in vivo evidence that activation of AR signaling by intratumoral AR ligands is required for castration-recurrent CaP growth and that epithelial CaP cells produce sufficient active androgens for CaP recurrence during androgen deprivation therapy. Targeting intracrine T and DHT synthesis should provide a mechanism to inhibit AR and growth of castration-recurrent CaP.""","""['Mark A Titus', 'Brian Zeithaml', 'Boris Kantor', 'Xiangping Li', 'Karin Haack', 'Dominic T Moore', 'Elizabeth M Wilson', 'James L Mohler', 'Tal Kafri']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Androgen receptor stabilization in recurrent prostate cancer is associated with hypersensitivity to low androgen.', 'Maintenance of intratumoral androgens in metastatic prostate cancer: a mechanism for castration-resistant tumor growth.', 'Intracrine androgen biosynthesis in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Castration-recurrent prostate cancer is not androgen-independent.', 'Androgen receptor action in hormone-dependent and recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Mutation of androgen receptor N-terminal phosphorylation site Tyr-267 leads to inhibition of nuclear translocation and DNA binding.', 'Role of miRNA let-7 and its major targets in prostate cancer.', ""Negative regulation of the androgen receptor gene through a primate-specific androgen response element present in the 5' UTR."", 'High SPDEF may identify patients who will have a prolonged response to androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Insulin receptor isoform switching in intestinal stem cells, progenitors, differentiated lineages and tumors: evidence that IR-B limits proliferation.']"""

Median WTP varied from $109 for the imperfect arthritis test to $263 for the perfect prostate cancer test.

Our previous study showed that Livin might play an important role in the initiation of human PCa and that Livin-α might promote cell proliferation by regulating the G1-S cell cycle transition. However, whether Livin, as an IAP, can regulate the invasive ability of PCa cells remains unknown. In this study, we found that the expression of Livin was higher in metastatic PCa tissues than in nonmetastatic tissues and that the expression of Livin was downregulated/upregulated by small interfering RNA/vector, which could inhibit/promote PC-3/LNCaP cell invasion. This action was related to the impact of Livin on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and its downstream signaling pathway, including FN and CXCR4.

Methods and materials:   We identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database patients diagnosed from 1988 through 2002 with T1-T3N0M0 prostate adenocarcinoma of poorly differentiated grade and treated with BT, EBRT, or BT + EBRT. During this time frame, the database defined high grade as prostate cancers with Gleason score 8-10, or Gleason grade 4-5 if the score was not recorded. This corresponds to a cohort primarily with high-risk prostate cancer, although some cases where only Gleason grade was recorded may have included intermediate-risk cancer. We used multivariate models to examine patient and tumor characteristics associated with the likelihood of treatment with each radiation modality and the effect of radiation modality on PCSM.  Results:   There were 12,745 patients treated with EBRT (73.5%), BT (7.1%), or BT + EBRT (19.4%) included in the analysis. The median follow-up time for all patients was 6.4 years. The use of BT or BT + EBRT increased from 5.1% in 1988-1992 to 31.4% in 1998-2002. Significant predictors of use of BT or BT + EBRT were younger age, later year of diagnosis, urban residence, and earlier T-stage.

Methods and materials:   Prostates were contoured for 5 subjects' 3D TRUS images showing a maximum PAI of ≤1 cm and a prostate volume of <50 cc. Two planning studies were done. First, prostate contours were artificially enlarged to 45 to 80 cc in 5- to 10-cc increments for a single subject. Second, all subject prostate contours were enlarged to 60 cc. For each study, three types of plans were manually created for comparison: a parallel needle template (PT) plan, a parallel needle no-template (PNT) plan, and an oblique needle no-template (OBL) plan. Needle positions and angles were not discretized for nontemplate plans. European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology dose-volume histogram guidelines, iodine-125 (145-Gy prescription, 0.43 U), and needle angles of <15° were used. An OBL plan was delivered to a pubic arch containing a 60-cc prostate phantom that mimicked the anatomy of the subject with the greatest PAI (23% by volume).  Results:   In the increasing-prostate volume study, OBL plans were successful for prostates of ≤80 cc, and PT plans were successful for prostates of <65 cc. In paired, one-sided t tests for the 60-cc volume study, OBL plans showed dosimetric improvements for all organs compared to both of the parallel type plans (p < 0.05); PNT plans showed a benefit only in planning target volumes receiving more than 100 Gy compared to PT plans. A computed tomography scan of the phantom showed submillimeter seed placement accuracy in all directions.

Approximately 50% of patients on long-term follow-up relapse despite adjuvant XRT and the predominant site of failure remains local. Four consensus guidelines define postoperative clinical target volume (CTV) in prostate cancer. We explore the possibility that inadequate CTV coverage is an important cause of local failure. This study evaluates the utility of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in defining prostate bed CTV.  Methods and materials:   Twenty prostate cancer patients treated with postoperative XRT who also had preoperative staging MRI were included. The four guidelines were applied and the CTVs were expanded to create planning target volumes (PTVs). Preoperative MRIs were fused with postoperative planning CT scans. MRI-based prostate and gross visible tumors were contoured. Three-dimensional (3D) conformal four- and six-field XRT plans were developed and dose-volume histograms analyzed. Subtraction analysis was conducted to assess the adequacy of prostate/gross tumor coverage.  Results:   Gross tumor was visible in 18 cases. In all 20 cases, the consensus CTVs did not fully cover the MRI-defined prostate. On average, 35% of the prostate volume and 32% of the gross tumor volume were missed using six-field 3D treatment plans. The entire MRI-defined gross tumor volume was completely covered in only two cases (six-field plans). The expanded PTVs did not cover the entire prostate bed in 50% of cases. Prostate base and mid-zones were the predominant site of inadequate coverage.  Conclusions:   Current postoperative CTV guidelines do not adequately cover the prostate bed and/or gross tumor based on preoperative MRI imaging. Additionally, expanded PTVs do not fully cover the prostate bed in 50% of cases. Inadequate CTV definition is likely a major contributing factor for the high risk of relapse despite adjuvant XRT. Preoperative imaging may lead to more accurate CTV definition, which should result in further improvements in survival for patients with high-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Jennifer Croke', 'Shawn Malone', 'Nicolas Roustan Delatour', 'Eric Belanger', 'Leonard Avruch', 'Christopher Morash', 'Cathleen Kayser', 'Kathryn Underhill', 'Johanna Spaans']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a comparison of four consensus guidelines and dosimetric evaluation of 3D-CRT versus tomotherapy IMRT.', 'Proposal of a post-prostatectomy clinical target volume based on pre-operative MRI: volumetric and dosimetric comparison to the RTOG guidelines.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in postprostatectomy radiotherapy planning.', 'Choice of optimal margins in prostate conformal radiotherapy.', 'Development of RTOG consensus guidelines for the definition of the clinical target volume for postoperative conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'ESTRO\xa0ACROP guideline on prostate bed delineation for postoperative radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Local Recurrence After Surgery With MRI Imaging for Prostate Cancer in the Setting of Salvage Radiation Therapy.', 'Imaging assessment of local recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Detection of Local Recurrence with 3-Tesla MRI After Radical Prostatectomy: A Useful Method for Radiation Treatment Planning?', 'ACR Appropriateness Criteria® external beam radiation therapy treatment planning for clinically localized prostate cancer, part I of II.']"""

The results of these studies might have been confounded because patients might often take both medications. We examined their respective influence on PCa aggressiveness at initial diagnosis.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed 381 patients treated with either external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy for low-risk (n = 152), intermediate-risk (n = 142), or high-risk (n = 87) localized PCa. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate an association between these drug classes and prostate cancer aggressiveness. We tested whether the concomitant use of statins and ACs had a different effect than that of either AC or statin use alone.  Results:   Of the 381 patients, 172 (45.1%) were taking statins and 141 (37.0%) ACs; 105 patients (27.6%) used both. On univariate analysis, the statin and AC users were associated with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (p = .017) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group (p = .0022). On multivariate analysis, statin use was associated with a PSA level <10 ng/mL (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.8; p = .012) and a PSA level >20 ng/mL (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.83; p = .03). The use of ACs was associated with a PSA level >20 ng/mL (odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.59, p = .02).

Aim:   To evaluate Gleason score upgradation after radical prostatectomy with low biopsy score (≤ 6) and its correlation to pathological findings and outcome.  Settings and design:   This was a retrospective analysis of 257 cases of prostate cancer patients with initial b-GS ≤ 6, over a period of 14 years.  Materials and methods:   Data were divided into two groups according to (rp- GS) as 1) Group A (n=151; rp-GS ≤ 6 ) 2) and Group B(n=106; rp-GS ≥7). Both groups were compared in terms of the following: 1) preoperative variables e.g. age, PSA, transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) status, clinical T stage; 2) pathological features - rp GS, pathological stage (pT), capsular penetration, cut margin, seminal vesicle and lymph node status; 3) biochemical recurrence, overall and cancer specific mortality.  Statistical analysis used:   Student's t test and Chi-square test.  Results:   Group B had worse pathological features, except lymph node invasion, and they received significantly more adjuvant hormonal/local radiotherapy and had higher recurrence rate. However, the overall and cancer-specific mortality were similar in both the groups.  Conclusions:   b-GS upgradation after radical prostatectomy is frequent and correlates with adverse pathological features, higher use of adjuvant therapy and higher recurrence rate. In Group B, adjuvant therapy delays the biochemical or clinical relapse and controls mortality in short-term follow up.

Increase of both mRNA and protein level were shown for the first time only in the patients who underwent neoadjuvant ADT for 1-month. This transient increase of TGF-β expression after androgen ablation suggested cooperation of the pathways in prostate regression. Since no alteration was observed in the gene transcriptional activity, the molecular mechanism of this cooperation, probably act at the post-transcriptional level.

A 68-year-old man presents for management of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-recurrent prostate cancer. His PSA level had become undetectable after prostatectomy for a high-risk localized tumor but began to rise 8 months later. This later led to the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which he has received for the last 3.5 years. After initially falling in response to ADT, his PSA level again trended steadily upward and is now 13.2. Restaging with an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan and a bone scan reveals no evidence of metastases. Is this man likely to benefit from denosumab? Bone is the most common site of metastasis for advanced prostate cancer. Bone metastases can cause considerable morbidity in the form of pain, pathologic fractures, and even spinal cord compression. Two bone-targeted therapies (zoledronic acid and denosumab) have been shown to reduce the risk for skeletal events (SREs) among men with bone metastases and a rising PSA level despite a testosterone level <50 ng/dL (castration-resistant prostate cancer [CRPC]). Until recently, no therapy had been shown to reduce the risk for developing bone metastases for the first time. Denosumab 147 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial that enrolled 1,432 men with CRPC, no bone metastases, and at least one feature consistent with a high risk for the development of bone metastases (PSA ≥8 ng/mL or PSA doubling time ≤10 months). Participants were treated every 4 weeks with s.c. denosumab (120 mg) or placebo. The trial was positive because denosumab led to a 4.2-month significantly longer bone-metastasis-free survival time relative to placebo (median, 29.5 months versus 25.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.98; p = .028) [1]. The time to first bone metastasis and risk for symptomatic bone metastasis were also significantly better with denosumab treatment.

One, cold/menthol-sensitive TRPM8, is reportedly an important player in carcinogenesis in human prostate cancer, although its involvement in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains unclear. The present immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR results revealed intense TRPM8 expression in two SCC cell lines, HSC3 and HSC4, derived from the human tongue. Menthol, icilin, and a more specific TRPM8 agonist (WS-12) induced non-specific cation currents, with Ca2+ permeability being greater than that of Na+ or K+. The novel TRPM8 antagonist RQ-00203078 (RQ) profoundly reduced such agonist-induced cation currents. Intracellular Ca2+ imaging revealed that menthol induced both intracellular Ca2+ release and store-operated Ca2+ entry, with RQ inhibiting each effect. To assess the possible pathophysiological role of TRPM8 in oral SCC, we performed motility and invasion assays, and gelatin zymography. Menthol augmented the migration and invasion abilities of both HSC3 and HSC4 cells by potentiating MMP-9 activity. RQ suppressed all of these effects.

Results:   An area under ROC curve of 0.96 was obtained on the biopsy dataset and was validated by a ""leave-one-patient-out"" procedure. The proposed measure of cancer probability shows a positive correlation with Gleason score. The cancer colormaps created for the histopathology patients do display the dominant tumors.

As prostate cancer cells proliferate in response to androgen steroids, CYP17A1 inhibition is a new strategy to prevent androgen synthesis and treat lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, but drug development has been hampered by lack of information regarding the structure of CYP17A1. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of CYP17A1, which were obtained in the presence of either abiraterone, a first-in-class steroidal inhibitor recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for late-stage prostate cancer, or TOK-001, an inhibitor that is currently undergoing clinical trials. Both of these inhibitors bind the haem iron, forming a 60° angle above the haem plane and packing against the central I helix with the 3β-OH interacting with aspargine 202 in the F helix. Notably, this binding mode differs substantially from those that are predicted by homology models and from steroids in other cytochrome P450 enzymes with known structures, and some features of this binding mode are more similar to steroid receptors. Whereas the overall structure of CYP17A1 provides a rationale for understanding many mutations that are found in patients with steroidogenic diseases, the active site reveals multiple steric and hydrogen bonding features that will facilitate a better understanding of the enzyme's dual hydroxylase and lyase catalytic capabilities and assist in rational drug design. Specifically, structure-based design is expected to aid development of inhibitors that bind only CYP17A1 and solely inhibit its androgen-generating lyase activity to improve treatment of prostate and other hormone-responsive cancers.""","""['Natasha M DeVore', 'Emily E Scott']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Comparative study of the binding mode between cytochrome P450 17A1 and prostate cancer drugs in the absence of haem iron.', 'Structures of human steroidogenic cytochrome P450 17A1 with substrates.', 'Structural and Functional Evaluation of Clinically Relevant Inhibitors of Steroidogenic Cytochrome P450 17A1.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.', 'Androgen synthesis inhibitors in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'In-silico activity prediction and docking studies of some flavonol derivatives as anti-prostate cancer agents based on Monte Carlo optimization.', 'Diagnosis of 17-alpha hydroxylase deficiency performed late in life in a patient with a 46,XY karyotype.', 'Non-steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors: Discovery and Assessment.', 'Bortezomib Pharmacogenetic Biomarkers for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma: Review and Future Perspectives.', 'Recombinant Technologies Facilitate Drug Metabolism, Pharmacokinetics, and General Biomedical Research.']"""

We found that dietary treatment with PEITC significantly inhibited tumor platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1/CD31) expression, a marker of angiogenesis. By contrast, we did not find the inhibitory effects of PEITC on tumor growth to be associated with alteration of specific markers for apoptosis, cell proliferation or androgen receptor-mediated pathways.

Interestingly, PEITC significantly attenuated LNCaP cell plating efficiency that correlated with inhibition of integrin family proteins integrin β1, α2 and α6 mRNA expression.

Alternative splicing of the AR gene and synthesis of constitutively active COOH-terminally truncated AR variants lacking the AR ligand-binding domain has emerged as an important mechanism of ADT resistance in CRPCa. In a previous study, we demonstrated that altered AR splicing in CRPCa 22Rv1 cells was linked to a 35-kb intragenic tandem duplication of AR exon 3 and flanking sequences. In this study, we demonstrate that complex patterns of AR gene copy number imbalances occur in PCa cell lines, xenografts and clinical specimens. To investigate whether these copy number imbalances reflect AR gene rearrangements that could be linked to splicing disruptions, we carried out a detailed analysis of AR gene structure in the LuCaP 86.2 and CWR-R1 models of CRPCa. By deletion-spanning PCR, we discovered a 8579-bp deletion of AR exons 5, 6 and 7 in the LuCaP 86.2 xenograft, which provides a rational explanation for synthesis of the truncated AR v567es AR variant in this model. Similarly, targeted resequencing of the AR gene in CWR-R1 cells led to the discovery of a 48-kb deletion in AR intron 1. This intragenic deletion marked a specific CWR-R1 cell population with enhanced expression of the truncated AR-V7/AR3 variant, a high level of androgen-independent AR transcriptional activity and rapid androgen independent growth.

Androgen regulation of miR-32 and miR-148a was confirmed by androgen stimulation of the LNCaP cells followed by expression analyses. The AR-binding sites in proximity of these miRNAs were demonstrated with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). To identify target genes for the miRNAs, mRNA microarray analyses were performed with LNCaP cells transfected with pre-miR-32 and pre-miR-148a. Expression of BTG2 and PIK3IP1 was reduced in the cells transfected with pre-miR-32 and pre-miR-148a, respectively. Also, the protein expression was reduced according to western blot analysis. BTG2 and PIK3IP1 were confirmed to be targets by 3'UTR-luciferase assays. Finally, immunostainings showed a statistically significant (P<0.0001) reduction of BTG2 protein in CRPCs compared with untreated prostate cancer (PC). The lack of BTG2 staining was also associated (P<0.01) with a short progression-free time in patients who underwent prostatectomy.

Cyclin D1 level changes are partially controlled by GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation at threonine-286 (Thr286), which targets cyclin D1 for ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation. In our continuing studies on the mechanism of prostate cancer prevention by resveratrol, focusing on the role of its recently discovered target protein, quinone reductase 2 (NQO2), we generated NQO2 knockdown CWR22Rv1 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated gene silencing approach. We found that, compared with cells expressing NQO2 (shRNA08), NQO2 knockdown cells (shRNA25) displayed slower proliferation and G(1) phase cell accumulation. Immunoblot analyses revealed a significant decrease in phosphorylation of retinoblastoma Rb and cyclin D1 in shRNA25 compared with shRNA08. Moreover, shRNA25 cells showed a 37% decrease in chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity. An increase in AKT activity was also observed in shRNA25, supported by a ∼1.5-fold elevation in phosphorylation and ∼50% reduction/deactivation of GSK-3α/β at Ser21/9, which were accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at T286. NQO2 knockdown cells also showed attenuation of resveratrol-induced downregulation of cyclin D1.

ARN-509 was optimized for inhibition of AR transcriptional activity and prostate cancer cell proliferation, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efficacy. In contrast to bicalutamide, ARN-509 lacked significant agonist activity in preclinical models of CRPC. Moreover, ARN-509 lacked inducing activity for AR nuclear localization or DNA binding. In a clinically valid murine xenograft model of human CRPC, ARN-509 showed greater efficacy than MDV3100. Maximal therapeutic response in this model was achieved at 30 mg/kg/d of ARN-509, whereas the same response required 100 mg/kg/d of MDV3100 and higher steady-state plasma concentrations. Thus, ARN-509 exhibits characteristics predicting a higher therapeutic index with a greater potential to reach maximally efficacious doses in man than current AR antagonists.

It is imperative to decipher the molecular mechanisms of kidney tumor migration and invasion in order to develop effective therapies for patients with advanced cancer. Rap1, a small GTPase protein, has been implicated in cancer cell growth and invasion. Here, we profile migratory and invasive properties of commonly used renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines and correlate that with expression and function of the Rap inactivator Rap1GAP. We report that levels of Rap1GAP inversely correlate with invasion but not migration. We also report that forced over-expression of Rap1GAP decreases invasion of RCC cells but does not impact their rate of proliferation. Low expression levels of Rap1GAP in RCC cells are due, at least in part, to promoter hypermethylation. Rescued expression of Rap1GAP with a demethylating drug, decitabine (5-azadC), decreases the RCC SN12C cell invasion of collagen, fibronectin, and Matrigel matrices. RCC cell lines express distinct levels of cell adhesion proteins and the forced over-expression of Rap1GAP attenuated levels of both cadherins and integrins that are known to regulate the cancer cells invasion.

The system is capable of 1) registering the 3-dimensional location of each biopsy track in the 3-dimensional prostate volume data and 2) performing elastic image fusion of transrectal ultrasound with magnetic resonance imaging.  Materials and methods:   We used 3 CIRS-053 prostate phantoms containing 3 hypoechoic lesions to perform ultrasound guided biopsy and 3 CIRS-066 phantoms (Computerized Imaging Reference Systems, Norfolk, Virginia) containing 3 isoechoic but magnetic resonance imaging visible lesions to perform magnetic resonance fusion guided biopsy. Three targeted biopsies were done per lesion. Each biopsy tract was injected with gadolinium based magnetic resonance contrast mixed with india ink. Phantoms were then subjected to 1 mm slice magnetic resonance imaging and serial step sectioning to assess the accuracy of targeted biopsy.  Results:   A total of 27 ultrasound guided biopsies were targeted into 9 hypoechoic lesions. All 27 biopsies (100%) successfully hit the target lesion. For hypoechoic lesions mean ± SD procedural targeting error was 1.52 ± 0.78 mm and system registration error was 0.83 mm, resulting in an overall error of 2.35 mm.

AKR1C3 is upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) and castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that develops after androgen deprivation therapy. PCa and CRPC often depend on intratumoral androgen biosynthesis and upregulation of AKR1C3 could contribute to intracellular synthesis of AR ligands and stimulation of proliferation through AR signaling. To test this hypothesis, we developed an LNCaP prostate cancer cell line overexpressing AKR1C3 (LNCaP-AKR1C3) and compared its metabolic and proliferative responses to Δ(4)-Adione treatment with that of the parental, AKR1C3 negative LNCaP cells. In LNCaP and LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells, metabolism proceeded via 5α-reduction to form 5α-androstane-3,17-dione and then (epi)androsterone-3-glucuronide. LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells made significantly higher amounts of testosterone-17β-glucuronide. When 5α-reductase was inhibited by finasteride, the production of testosterone-17β-glucuronide was further elevated in LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells. When AKR1C3 activity was inhibited with indomethacin the production of testosterone-17β-glucuronide was significantly decreased. Δ(4)-Adione treatment stimulated cell proliferation in both cell lines. Finasteride inhibited LNCaP cell proliferation, consistent with 5α-androstane-3,17-dione acting as the major metabolite that stimulates growth by binding to the mutated AR. However, LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells were resistant to the growth inhibitory properties of finasteride, consistent with the diversion of Δ(4)-Adione metabolism from 5α-reduced androgens to increased formation of testosterone. Indomethacin did not result in differences in Δ(4)-Adione induced proliferation since this treatment led to the same metabolic profile in LNCaP and LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells. We conclude that AKR1C3 overexpression diverts androgen metabolism to testosterone that results in proliferation in androgen sensitive prostate cancer. This effect is seen despite high levels of uridine glucuronosyl transferases suggesting that AKR1C3 activity can surmount the effects of this elimination pathway. Treatment options in prostate cancer that target 5α-reductase where AKR1C3 co-exists may be less effective due to the diversion of Δ(4)-Adione to testosterone.""","""['Michael C Byrns', 'Rebekka Mindnich', 'Ling Duan', 'Trevor M Penning']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'Increased expression of type 2 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/type 5 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C3) and its relationship with androgen receptor in prostate carcinoma.', 'Development of potent and selective indomethacin analogues for the inhibition of AKR1C3 (Type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/prostaglandin F synthase) in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'The DHEA-sulfate depot following P450c17 inhibition supports the case for AKR1C3 inhibition in high risk localized and advanced castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Novel aldo-keto reductase 1C3 inhibitor affects androgen metabolism but not ovarian function in healthy women: a phase 1 study.', 'New Insights into Testosterone Biosynthesis: Novel Observations from HSD17B3 Deficient Mice.', 'Gene polymorphism-related differences in the outcomes of abiraterone for prostate cancer: a systematic overview.', 'A Mansonone Derivative Coupled with Monoclonal Antibody 4D5-Modified Chitosan Inhibit AKR1C3 to Treat Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Reversal of Apalutamide and Darolutamide Aldo-Keto Reductase 1C3-Mediated Resistance by a Small Molecule Inhibitor.']"""

Does prolonged hormonal treatment affect the conspicuity of tumor tissue on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-MRI) images? Is tumor delineation possible in patients using hormonal treatment? Can we identify specific imaging thresholds for tumor delineation in patients after prolonged androgen deprivation?  Materials and methods:   Ninety-six patients were included. Using multivariate linear regression analyses, we investigated if DWI and DCE-MRI parameter maps are different in patients receiving hormonal treatment for 0-3 or >3 months. Furthermore, logistic regression was performed to obtain specific imaging thresholds for tumor tissue for the two patient groups.  Results:   We found a significantly higher diffusion and lower perfusion of tumor tissue in the >3 months hormonal treatment group compared to the 0-3 group. This resulted in lower tumor conspicuity. Nevertheless, in 18/21 of the patients in the >3 months treatment group, a suspicious lesion could be defined based on the MR images. Based on logistic regression, different imaging thresholds should be set for tumor detection in the two treatment groups.  Conclusions:   Prolonged androgen deprivation decreases tumor conspicuity. Different imaging thresholds need to be set to delineate tumor in patients who have had prolonged hormonal treatment.""","""['Greetje Groenendaal', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Susanne R Pereboom', 'Davey Poelma-Tap', 'Johannes G Korporaal', 'Evelyn Monninkhof', 'Uulke A van der Heide']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Androgen deprivation-induced changes in prostate anatomy predict urinary morbidity after permanent interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy causes fewer side effects than three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy when used in combination with brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Lack of benefit from a short course of androgen deprivation for unfavorable prostate cancer patients treated with an accelerated hypofractionated regime.', 'A new model using number of needles and androgen deprivation to predict chronic urinary toxicity for high or low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Simultaneous MRI diffusion and perfusion imaging for tumor delineation in prostate cancer patients.', 'The clinical guiding value of a radiomics model for androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy on magnetic resonance imaging features in prostate cancer before radiotherapy.', 'Prostate cancer - Advantages and disadvantages of MR-guided RT.', 'Changes in prostate apparent diffusion coefficient values during radiotherapy after neoadjuvant hormones.', 'Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on apparent diffusion coefficient and T2w MRI for histogram and texture analysis with respect to focal radiotherapy of prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   The ABS formed a committee of brachytherapists and researchers experienced in the clinical practice of PPB to formulate updated guidelines for this technique. Sources of input for these guidelines included prior published guidelines, clinical trials, published literature, and experience of the committee. The recommendations of the committee were reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the ABS.  Results:   Patients with high probability of organ-confined disease or limited extraprostatic extension are considered appropriate candidates for PPB monotherapy. Low-risk patients may be treated with PPB alone without the need for supplemental external beam radiotherapy. High-risk patients should receive supplemental external beam radiotherapy if PPB is used. Intermediate-risk patients should be considered on an individual case basis. Intermediate-risk patients with favorable features may appropriately be treated with PPB monotherapy but results from confirmatory clinical trials are pending. Computed tomography-based postimplant dosimetry performed within 60 days of the implant is considered essential for maintenance of a satisfactory quality assurance program.

However, the efficacy could be affected by screening interval, age ranges of screening, attendance, and contamination of the control group in randomised controlled trials.  Objective:   Assess the impact of the above-mentioned factors on screening efficacy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Parameters pertaining to the natural history of PCa and sensitivity were estimated using data from the Finnish quadrennial screening program starting at 55 yr of age and terminating at 71 yr of age and comprising 80 458 men (32 000 in the screening arm and 48 458 in the control arm). We performed Markov decision analyses for different screening policies with a simulated 25-yr follow-up.  Intervention:   PSA screening.  Measurements:   The impact of different interscreening intervals and target age ranges on advanced PCa (stage III or worse) and PCa mortality was assessed.  Results and limitations:   With 65% attendance and 20% contamination, as in the Finnish trial, screening would result in an 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.1-13.3%) reduction in advanced cancers and a 7.3% (95% CI, 5.3-9.7%) reduction in PCa death, with corresponding absolute risk difference of 2.6% (95% CI, 1.9-3.5%) and 1.8% (95% CI, 1.4-2.2%), respectively. Numbers needed to screen were 385 to prevent one case of advanced PCa and 556 to prevent one PCa death at 25 yr. Those figures remained similar from 12 yr onwards. Reduction in advanced PCa increased to 40% with annual screening and to 24% with biennial screening. When the age at screening initiation was increased by 5 yr, the benefit was reduced by 9% with annual screening and by 3% with biennial screening.  Conclusions:   We predicted the impact of basic screening characteristics on the benefit of the program. The screening interval (1-4 yr) had a greater impact on mortality reduction than did the age at start of screening (55-65 yr).

The purpose of the current study is to investigate the role of new lncRNA, named PlncRNA-1, in prostate cancer (CaP) pathogenesis.  Materials and methods:   In this study, real-time q-PCR was used to demonstrate the expression of PlncRNA-1 in 16 pairs CaP tissues and matched normal tissues, 14 pairs CaP tissues and BPH tissues, 4 CaP cell lines, including LNCaP, LNCaP-AI, PC3, and C4-2, and 2 normal prostate epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 and PWR-1E. After PlncRNA-1 was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines, cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). After PlncRNA-1 and AR was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines, real-time q-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and AR.  Results:   We showed that expression PlncRNA-1, was significantly higher in CaP cells relative to normal prostate epithelial cells, as well as higher in human CaPs compared with normal tissues and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Silencing of PlncRNA-1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in CaP cell lines LNCaP and LNCaP-AI. Mechanistically, PlncRNA-1 suppression by siRNA resulted in a decrease of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA, protein and AR downstream target. Of note, blockade of AR signaling with siRNA also resulted in a suppression of PlncRNA-1 expression in CaP cell lines.

Materials and methods:   Between 2001 and 2004, 967 men undergoing radical prostatectomy underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Soft tissue and bony dimensions were retrospectively measured by 2 raters blinded to clinical and pathological data. Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy, who were preoperatively incontinent or had missing followup for continence were excluded from study, leaving 600 patients eligible for analysis. No pad use defined continent. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with continence recovery at 6 and 12 months. We evaluated whether the predictive accuracy of a base model was improved by adding independently significant magnetic resonance imaging variables.  Results:   Urethral length and urethral volume were significantly associated with the recovery of continence at 6 and 12 months. Larger inner and outer levator distances were significantly associated with a decreased probability of regaining continence at 6 or 12 months, but they did not reach statistical significance for other points. Addition of these 4 magnetic resonance imaging variables to a base model including age, clinical stage, prostate specific antigen and comorbidities marginally improved the discrimination (12-month AUC improved from 0.587 to 0.634).  Conclusions:   Membranous urethral length, urethral volume, and an anatomically close relation between the levator muscle and membranous urethra on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging are independent predictors of continence recovery after radical prostatectomy.

Data on 7,617 infertile men, each with at least 1 semen analysis and sperm DNA integrity assay, were obtained from an institutional database for comparison. Published data on fertile men were compared to data on those with brachytherapy for DNA fragmentation analysis.  Results:   All brachytherapy cases had normal serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone. Specific semen parameters, such as semen volume (p <0.0005), total sperm concentration (p <0.0004) and percent sperm motility (p <0.004), were significantly lower than normal reference values. As measured by the DNA fragmentation index, the mean sperm DNA fragmentation of 46.4% in brachytherapy cases was significantly higher than in the fertile group (13.3%, p <0.0003), the total infertile group (20.4%, p <0.0002) and the age matched infertile group 45 to 53 years old (27.9%, p <0.03).

Methods:   In this retrospective study at one hospital, the records of 152 patients with stage Ia to IIIa ER + breast cancer who received goserelin or chemotherapy were reviewed. Survival analysis was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients were interviewed to evaluate their quality of life using the European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30, version 4.0), and to obtain the utility value by the standard gamble (SG) and visual scale (VS) methods. Total medical cost was assessed from the (National Health Insurance) NHI payer's perspective.  Results:   Survival at 11 years was significantly better in the groserelin group (P < 0.0012). The lifetime lost was lower in the goserelin group (42 months vs. 66 months). The quality adjusted survival (QAS) of patients who received goserelin was longer (122.5 ± 6.3 vs. 112.2 ± 6.7 months).

Furthermore, it exerted antimicrobial toxicity, vascular effects, downregulation of chaperone induction and plasmid curing in bacterial cells. Here, this drug was found to possess cytotoxic activity against a panel of human cancer cell lines that do not overexpress P-gp, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging between 1.75±0.38 μM for GLC14 small cell lung cancer and 34.00±4.75 μM for PC-3 prostate cancer cells. HL-60 leukemia and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells exhibited cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death in response to SILA 421. Assessment of global gene expression of SILA 421-treated HL-60 cells was employed to identify cellular pathways affected by the compound and revealed disturbance of DNA replication, transcription and production of apparently misfolded proteins. Endoplasmatic reticulum stress and downregulation of cell cycle, cellular repair mechanisms and growth factor-related signaling cascades eventually resulted in induction of apoptosis in this cell line. In addition to the well established P-gp inhibitory effect of SILA compounds, reversal of resistance to taxanes, which had been reported for SILA 421 and the related molecule SILA 409, may be linked to downregulation of gene expression of kinesins. Interference with DNA replication and transcription seems to be the common denominator of antimicrobial activity and plasmid curing, as well as anticancer toxicity in human cell lines.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) leads to tumor involution and reduction of tumor burden. However, tumors eventually reemerge that have overcome the absence of gonadal androgens, termed castration resistant PCa (CRPC). Theories underlying the development of CRPC include androgen receptor (AR) mutation allowing for promiscuous activation by non-androgens, AR amplification and overexpression leading to hypersensitivity to low androgen levels, and/or tumoral uptake and conversion of adrenally derived androgens. More recently it has been proposed that prostate tumor cells synthesize their own androgens through de novo steroidogenesis, which involves the step-wise synthesis of androgens from cholesterol. Using the in vivo LNCaP PCa xenograft model, previous data from our group demonstrated that a hypercholesterolemia diet potentiates prostatic tumor growth via induction of angiogenesis. Using this same model we now demonstrate that circulating cholesterol levels are significantly associated with tumor size (R = 0.3957, p = 0.0049) and intratumoral levels of testosterone (R = 0.41, p = 0.0023) in LNCaP tumors grown in hormonally intact mice. We demonstrate tumoral expression of cholesterol uptake genes as well as the spectrum of steroidogenic enzymes necessary for androgen biosynthesis from cholesterol. Moreover, we show that circulating cholesterol levels are directly correlated with tumoral expression of CYP17A, the critical enzyme required for de novo synthesis of androgens from cholesterol (R = 0.4073, p = 0.025) Since hypercholesterolemia does not raise circulating androgen levels and the adrenal gland of the mouse synthesizes minimal androgens, this study provides evidence that hypercholesterolemia increases intratumoral de novo steroidogenesis. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that cholesterol-fueled intratumoral androgen synthesis may accelerate the growth of prostate tumors, and suggest that treatment of CRPC may be optimized by inclusion of cholesterol reduction therapies in conjunction with therapies targeting androgen synthesis and the AR.""","""['Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Keith R Solomon', 'Kristine Pelton', 'Michael R Freeman', 'R Bruce Montgomery']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Words of wisdom.

Androgenic hormones are generally believed to be causatively associated with prostate carcinogenesis, but human evidence, mostly epidemiological, for this is minimal. Circulating hormone levels are not associated with the risk of prostate cancer and neither are polymorphisms in various genes encoding the androgen metabolizing enzymes or androgen receptors. Evidence in support of the involvement of androgens in prostate cancer development is derived from clinical trials with 5α-reductase inhibitors, which reduced the risk by approximately 25%. Animal studies using rat models, however, provide clear evidence that testosterone can induce prostate cancer and can act as a strong tumor promoter in concert with genotoxic carcinogens. One such genotoxic factor may be 17β-estradiol, which is generated from testosterone by the aromatase enzyme. Estradiol can be converted to catecholestrogens, which through redox cycling, generate reactive metabolites that can adduct the DNA and potentially lead to mutations. Animal studies and limited human evidence suggest that estrogens can be involved in prostate carcinogenesis by such a genotoxic mechanism. However, how androgens exert their tumor-promoting effect is not clear. It is likely that hormonal and non-hormonal factors as well as genetic and non-genetic (environmental) factors interact in a highly complex and poorly understood manner to determine the risk of prostate cancer.""","""['Maarten C Bosland', 'Abeer M Mahmoud']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""J Carcinog""","""['The role of steroid hormones in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Sex steroids and prostate carcinogenesis: integrated, multifactorial working hypothesis.', 'Role of Estrogen in Androgen-Induced Prostate Carcinogenesis in NBL Rats.', 'Estrogen and prostate cancer: an eclipsed truth in an androgen-dominated scenario.', 'Hormonal and genotoxic estrogen-androgen carcinogenesis in the NBL rat prostate: A role for aromatase.', 'Molecular Similarities and Differences between Canine Prostate Cancer and Human Prostate Cancer Variants.', 'Effectiveness of anabolic steroids in improving outcomes for post-operative hip fracture patients: A randomized controlled trial.', 'Psychosocial Stress, Glucocorticoid Signaling, and Prostate Cancer Health Disparities in African American Men.', 'Urinary oestrogen steroidome as an indicator of the risk of localised prostate cancer progression.', 'Bisphenols Threaten Male Reproductive Health via Testicular Cells.']"""

In 22Rv1 cells, constitutively active STAT3 and ERK are targeted by sorafenib, contrasting with PC3 cells, in which these kinases are not active. Notably, overexpression of a constitutively active MEK construct in 22Rv1 cells stimulates the sustained phosphorylation of Bad and protects from sorafenib-induced cell death. In PC3 cells, Src and AKT are constitutively activated and targeted by sorafenib, leading to an increase in Bim protein levels. Overexpression of constitutively active AKT or knockdown of Bim protects PC3 cells from sorafenib-induced killing. In both PC3 and 22Rv1 cells, Mcl-1 depletion is required for the induction of cell death by sorafenib as transient overexpression of Mcl-1 is protective. Interestingly, co-culturing of primary cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with 22Rv1 or PC3 cells protected the cancer cells from sorafenib-induced cell death, and this protection was largely overcome by co-administration of the Bcl-2 antagonist, ABT737. In summary, the differential tyrosine kinase profile of prostate cancer cells defines the cytotoxic efficacy of sorafenib and this profile is modulated by CAFs to promote resistance.

The incidence nearly doubled in the last 10 years due to intensified use of PSA testing for early detection. To date, either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy is recommended for treatment of localized prostate cancer. Both strategies have similar survival chances (83-94%), but show different side effects. In view of the good prognosis implications for health-related quality of life (QoL) may play an important role in the therapy decision-making process and should be discussed with patients.  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer patients were asked twice about oncological health care and QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30, Version 2) as part of the OVIS study conducted in Schleswig-Holstein. The first questioning took place 16 months after the initial diagnosis and the second one at month 42. QoL was compared with German reference data. Logistic regression identified predictors for (a) low QoL at baseline (as indicated by global health status/QoL below the group median) and (b) clinically relevant detriments, defined as a difference of ≥10 points, in the chronological sequence.  Results:   Prostate cancer patients (n=1,345; median age at diagnosis 66 years) report a mean global QoL score that is higher than that of a healthy German reference sample (difference 6.3). In the temporal course, 56% of patients did not experience a clinically relevant change in QoL (<10 points difference). However, 20% reported a clinically relevant decrease and 24% a clinically relevant increase (≥ 10 points difference) regarding global health status/QoL. Higher age, lower social class, chemotherapy, undesired side effects and long-term complications as well as rehabilitative care predict low QoL at baseline, while progression of the disease and living in an urban surrounding as well as young age at diagnosis predict a decrease of QoL in the chronological sequence.  Conclusions:   Self-reported QoL of prostate cancer patients depends on various personal and medical factors. Physicians should be aware of these factors and include them in the discussion about the appropriate therapy method with their patients. In general, therapists and family members have problems describing the QoL of their patients and relatives. Assessing the QoL and QoL-influencing factors with a short questionnaire seems to be feasible and may be helpful in the therapy decision-making process.""","""['M Perl', 'A Waldmann', 'R Pritzkuleit', 'A Katalinic']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['The Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer in Everyday Practice in Germany.', ""Primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: evaluation of patients' quality of life."", 'The OVIS study: health related quality of life measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and -BR23 in German female patients with breast cancer from Schleswig-Holstein.', 'Prostate cancer treatment and quality of life.', 'Quality of life after low-dose rate-brachytherapy for prostate carcinoma - long-term results and literature review on QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 results in published brachytherapy series.', 'Income and health-related quality of life among prostate cancer patients over a one-year period after radical prostatectomy: a linear mixed model analysis.', 'Socioeconomic status and health-related quality of life among patients with prostate cancer 6\u2005months after radical prostatectomy: a longitudinal analysis.', 'Prostate cancer in routine healthcare: health-related quality of life after inpatient treatment.', 'Effect of perioperative complications and functional outcomes on health-related quality of life after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Objectives:   This research aimed to 1) assess patient-reported QoL and 2) identify clusters of cancer-related physical symptoms by cancer type among long-term breast, prostate, colorectal, and melanoma cancer survivors.  Methods:   A population-based cross-sectional sample of 863 adult cancer survivors five to six years post-diagnosis completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), assessing global QoL and frequency of presentation of cancer-related physical symptoms.  Results:   Long-term survivors reported higher levels of global QoL than 1) the general population (age-adjusted mean=79.4 vs. 71.1, small clinical difference) and 2) cancer patients early in the care trajectory (age-adjusted mean=77.1 vs. 61.3, moderate clinical difference). The majority (71%) did not report any cancer-related physical symptoms; 18% reported multiple (two or more) symptoms in the past month. Factor analysis found that cognitive functioning, fatigue, insomnia, pain, dyspnea, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting formed a cluster (α=0.48). No symptom clusters were identified that were specific to just one cancer type. However, individual symptoms (including diarrhea, pain, constipation, and insomnia) modestly discriminated between cancer types.  Conclusion:   Contrary to expectations, no symptom clusters specific to one type of cancer were identified and survivors reported few cancer-related symptoms and high QoL. These results convey a strong ""good news"" message, providing health professionals with a sound foundation for making encouraging predictions about their patients' long-term physical recovery after cancer.

We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for novel cofactors, and identified an interaction between the C-terminal domain of LCoR and the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), a putative tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Subsequent experiments revealed LCoR regulation of several KLF6 target genes notably p21(WAF1/CIP1) (CDKN1A) and to a lesser extent E-cadherin (CDH1), indicating that LCoR regulates gene transcription through multiple classes of transcription factors. In multiple cancer cells, LCoR and KLF6 bind together on the promoters of the genes encoding CDKN1A and CDH1. LCoR contributes to KLF6-mediated transcriptional repression in a promoter- and cell type-dependent manner. Its inhibition of reporter constructs driven by the CDKN1A and CDH1 promoters in PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells is sensitive to treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. Additionally, the LCoR cofactor CtBP1 bound the same promoters and augmented the LCoR-dependent repression in PC-3 cells. Consistent with their inferred roles in transcriptional repression, siRNA-mediated knockdown of KLF6, LCoR, or CtBP1 in PC-3 cells induced expression of CDKN1A and CDH1 and additional KLF6 target genes.

Methods:   In our 3 year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, undertaken at 65 academic medical centres or outpatient clinics in North America, we enrolled men aged 48-82 years who had low-volume, Gleason score 5-6 prostate cancer and had chosen to be followed up with active surveillance. We randomly allocated participants in a one-to-one ratio, stratified by site and in block sizes of four, to receive once-daily dutasteride 0·5 mg or matching placebo. Participants were followed up for 3 years, with 12-core prostate biopsy samples obtained after 18 months and 3 years. The primary endpoint was time to prostate cancer progression, defined as the number of days between the start of study treatment and the earlier of either pathological progression (in patients with ≥1 biopsy assessment after baseline) or therapeutic progression (start of medical therapy).

For comparison, the micelles were additionally cross-linked to study the effect of shell-cross-linking on the biological activity. The hydrodynamic diameter of cross-linked and un-cross-linked micelles was approximately 40 nm in both cases. While the cross-linked micelle was stable even in good solvents for both blocks, the un-cross-linked micelle was found to lose its integrity in cell growth media. Crosslinking had a major effect on the rate of drug release reducing it dramatically from 50% (uncrosslinked) to around 20% (crosslinked) over a 30 h incubation period. Both drug delivery systems were tested on human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU-145) and human ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR-3, A-2780). No toxic effects were measured with the unloaded micelle while the ABZ loaded un-cross-linked micelle lead to IC(50) values between 0.2 and 0.9 μM depending on the cell line. The IC(50) dropped to values between 0.006 and 0.06 μM, depending on cell line, once the micelles were stabilized by cross-linking. Three treatment cycles with ABZ for one day, followed by two days incubation in media using ABZ-loaded drug carriers led to complete cell death even at low concentrations in the case of the cross-linked micelle only. Cellular uptake has been studied using fluorescently labeled micelles and Nile red as model drug, showing cell uptake above the CMC but no micelle uptake below the CMC.

In part, they miss some of the information needed, e.g. for therapy decisions. To meet all requirements, it would be helpful to have a tool providing reminders of the necessary data and facilitating the transfer of these data into a pathology information system (PIS). Here, we describe a TNM-adapted toolset including a PIS-integrated structured template that contributes to improving pathology reports of prostatectomy specimens.  Methods and results:   All prostatectomy reports between January 2002 and August 2010 (n = 1049) were classified into descriptive reports (DRs) (n = 411), structured reports (SRs) arranged according to tumour spread, lymph node status, and surgical margin status (n = 333), and template-based synoptic reports (TBSRs) (n = 305). The report types were compared with regard to the content of 11 organ-specific essential data (ED) items crucial for exact TNM classification, therapy decisions, or prognostication. All 11 ED items were included in 2.7% of DRs, 43.5% of SRs and 97.2% of TBSRs, with a statistically highly significant difference (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   SRs, and particularly TBSRs, are advantageous as compared with DRs regarding the content of ED and the clarity of the data layout. The use of TBSRs leads to a reduction in failed data transfer and therefore to an increase in the quality of pathology reports.""","""['Konrad Aumann', 'Dominic Amann', 'Vera Gumpp', 'Dieter Hauschke', 'Gian Kayser', 'Annette M May', 'Ulrich Wetterauer', 'Martin Werner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""[""Radical prostatectomy specimens among Medicare patients in New York State: a review of pathologists' reports."", 'Structured reporting ensures complete content and quick detection of essential data in pathology reports of oncological breast resection specimens.', 'International society of urological pathology consensus conference on handling and staging of radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Interobserver variability between expert urologic pathologists for extraprostatic extension and surgical margin status in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Gleason grading of prostate cancer in needle biopsies or radical prostatectomy specimens: contemporary approach, current clinical significance and sources of pathology discrepancies.', 'Association of histological features with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma recurrences: a population-based study of 1502 patients in the Netherlands.', 'Automated Generation of Synoptic Reports from Narrative Pathology Reports in University Malaya Medical Centre Using Natural Language Processing.', 'Standardized structured reports for gastrointestinal tumors.', 'Histopathologic synoptic reporting of invasive melanoma: How reliable are the data?', 'Document standards for pathology reports in digital medicine.']"""

Methods:   Thirty-six patients with metastatic spine tumors treated surgically were retrospectivly reviewed from September 2005 to August 2010. There were 15 males and 21 females with an average age of 58 years old (ranged, 27 to 79 years). The site of origin of primary cancer included the breast, prostate, colon, lung, liver, esophagus, kidney, carcinoma, bladder, and 10 patients were with unidentified primary cancer. Five lesions were located in the cervical spine, 17 in the thoracic spine, 13 in the lumbar spine and 1 in the sacral vertebrae. Preoperative evaluation was conducted according to Tokuhashi system: total score 0 to 8 in 9 cases, 9 to 11 in 25 cases, 12 to 15 in 2 cases. The surgical procedures, including PVP, tumor resection and decompression, titanium nets implant, artificial vertebra replacement, bone cement stuffiness and inter fixation, were performed based on Tokuhashi score, location of lesions and neurological symptoms.  Results:   All the patients were followed up, and the during ranged from 2 months to 60 months with a mean time of 10.8 months. Pain relief was obtained in all patients after operation, and the VAS pain scores declined after operation. Among 14 patients suffering from spinal cord and nerve compromise, 12 patients improved 1 to 2 grades after surgery according to the Frankel grading system. According to the system of the ECOG performance status: 28 patients improved 1 to 2 grades in performance status after surgery. The postoperative survival rates at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years were 97.2%, 63.9%, 38.9% and 16.7% respectively. Six patines had bone cement leakage after PVP, and none resulted in severe complications.

However, its role in the regulation of PCa cell growth and survival has not been well characterized.  Methodology/principal findings:   Using experimental models that closely mimic clinical pathophysiology of PCa progression, we demonstrated that PDGF is a survival factor in PCa cells through upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). PDGF treatment induced rapid nuclear translocation of β-catenin, presumably mediated by c-Abl and p68 signaling. Intriguingly, PDGF promoted formation of a nuclear transcriptional complex consisting of β-catenin and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, and its binding to Mcl-1 promoter. Deletion of a putative hypoxia response element (HRE) within the Mcl-1 promoter attenuated PDGF effects on Mcl-1 expression. Blockade of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) signaling with a pharmacological inhibitor AG-17 abrogated PDGF induction of Mcl-1, and induced apoptosis in metastatic PCa cells.

Although LEDGF/p75 is emerging as a stress survival oncoprotein, there is scarce information on its expression in human tumors. The present study was performed to evaluate its expression in a comprehensive panel of human cancers.

To gain insights into mechanisms by which LEDGF/p75 protects cancer cells against stress, we initiated an analysis of its interactions with other transcription factors and the influence of these interactions on stress gene activation. We report here that both LEDGF/p75 and its short splice variant LEDGF/p52 interact with MeCP2, a methylation-associated transcriptional modulator, in vitro and in various human cancer cells. These interactions were established by several complementary approaches: transcription factor protein arrays, pull-down and AlphaScreen assays, coimmunoprecipitation, and nuclear colocalization by confocal microscopy. MeCP2 was found to interact with the N-terminal region shared by LEDGF/p75 and p52, particularly with the PWWP-CR1 domain. Like LEDGF/p75, MeCP2 bound to and transactivated the Hsp27 promoter (Hsp27pr). LEDGF/p75 modestly enhanced MeCP2-induced Hsp27pr transactivation in U2OS osteosarcoma cells, whereas this effect was more pronounced in PC3 prostate cancer cells. LEDGF/p52 repressed Hsp27pr activity in U2OS cells. Interestingly, siRNA-induced silencing of LEDGF/p75 in U2OS cells dramatically elevated MeCP2-mediated Hsp27pr transactivation, whereas this effect was less pronounced in PC3 cells depleted of LEDGF/p75. These results suggest that the LEDGF/p75-MeCP2 interaction differentially influences Hsp27pr activation depending on the cellular and molecular context.

We sought to integrate global genomic structural and expressional alterations in prostate cancer epithelium and stroma and their association with clinicopathologic features.  Experimental design:   We conducted a genome-wide LOH/allelic imbalance (AI) scan of DNA from epithelium and stroma of 116 prostate cancers. LOH/AI hot or cold spots were defined as the markers with significantly higher or lower LOH/AI frequencies compared with the average frequency for markers along the same chromosome. These data were then integrated with publicly available transcriptome data sets and our experimentally derived data. Immunohistochemistry on an independent series was used for validation.  Results:   Overall, we identified 43 LOH/AI hot/cold spots, 17 in epithelium and stroma (P < 0.001), 18 only in epithelium (P < 0.001), and eight only in stroma (P < 0.001). Hierarchical clustering of expression data supervised by genes within LOH/AI hot/cold spots in both epithelium and stroma accurately separated samples into normal epithelium, primary cancer, and metastatic cancer groups, which could not be achieved with data from only epithelium. Importantly, our experimental expression data of the genes within the LOH/AI hot/cold spots in stroma accurately clustered normal stroma from cancer stroma. We also identified 15 LOH/AI markers that were associated with Gleason score, which were validated functionally in each compartment by transcriptome data. Independent immunohistochemical validation of STIM2 within a stromal significant LOH marker (identified as associated with Gleason grade) confirmed its downregulation in the transition from moderate to high Gleason grade.

In this report, we extended our previous study and confirmed that Ser-81 phosphorylation increases during mitosis, coincident with CDK1 activation. We further showed blocking cell cycle at G(1) or S phase did not disrupt androgen-induced Ser-81 phosphorylation and AR-dependent transcription, consistent with a recent report that AR was phosphorylated at Ser-81 and activated by the transcriptional CDK9. To assess the function of Ser-81 phosphorylation in prostate cancer (PCa) cells expressing endogenous AR, we developed a ligand switch strategy using a ligand-binding domain mutation (W741C) that renders AR responsive to the antagonist bicalutamide. An S81A/W741C double mutant AR stably expressed in PCa cells failed to transactivate the endogenous AR-regulated PSA or TMPRSS2 genes. ChIP showed that the S81A mutation prevented ligand-induced AR recruitment to these genes, and cellular fractionation revealed that the S81A mutation globally abrogated chromatin binding. Conversely, the AR fraction rapidly recruited to chromatin after androgen stimulation was highly enriched for Ser-81 phosphorylation. Finally, inhibition of CDK1 and CDK9 decreased AR Ser-81 phosphorylation, chromatin binding, and transcriptional activity. These findings indicate that Ser-81 phosphorylation by CDK9 stabilizes AR chromatin binding for transcription and suggest that CDK1-mediated Ser-81 phosphorylation during mitosis provides a pool of Ser-81 phosphorylation AR that can be readily recruited to chromatin for gene reactivation and may enhance AR activity in PCa.""","""['Shaoyong Chen', 'Sarah Gulla', 'Changmeng Cai', 'Steven P Balk']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Androgen receptor phosphorylation and stabilization in prostate cancer by cyclin-dependent kinase 1.', 'Phosphorylation of the androgen receptor at Ser81 is co-sustained by CDK1 and CDK9 and leads to AR-mediated transactivation in prostate cancer.', 'CDK9 regulates AR promoter selectivity and cell growth through serine 81 phosphorylation.', 'Stress kinase signaling regulates androgen receptor phosphorylation, transcription, and localization.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Saracatinib synergizes with enzalutamide to downregulate AR activity in CRPC.', 'Targeting CDK9 with selective inhibitors or degraders in tumor therapy: an overview of recent developments.', 'Antagonistic effect of cyclin-dependent kinases and a calcium-dependent phosphatase on polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor toxic gain of function.', 'Targeting transcription cycles in cancer.', 'Steroid Receptors in Breast Cancer: Understanding of Molecular Function as a Basis for Effective Therapy Development.']"""

Increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leads to increases in the post-translational addition of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to various nuclear and cytosolic proteins. A number of these target proteins are implicated in cancer, and recently, O-GlcNAcylation was shown to play a role in breast cancer; however, O-GlcNAcylation in other cancers remains poorly defined. Here, we show that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is overexpressed in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate epithelium and that OGT protein and O-GlcNAc levels are elevated in prostate carcinoma cell lines. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation in PC3-ML cells was associated with reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and VEGF, resulting in inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis. OGT-mediated regulation of invasion and angiogenesis was dependent upon regulation of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1, a key regulator of invasion and angiogenesis, as reducing OGT expression led to increased FoxM1 protein degradation. Conversely, overexpression of a degradation-resistant FoxM1 mutant abrogated OGT RNAi-mediated effects on invasion, MMP levels, angiogenesis, and VEGF expression. Using a mouse model of metastasis, we found that reduction of OGT expression blocked bone metastasis. Altogether, these data suggest that as prostate cancer cells alter glucose and glutamine levels, O-GlcNAc modifications and OGT levels become elevated and are required for regulation of malignant properties, implicating OGT as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer.""","""['Thomas P Lynch', 'Christina M Ferrer', 'S RaElle Jackson', 'Kristina S Shahriari', 'Keith Vosseller', 'Mauricio J Reginato']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Nutrient sensor O-GlcNAc transferase regulates breast cancer tumorigenesis through targeting of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1.', 'O-GlcNAcylation regulates breast cancer metastasis via SIRT1 modulation of FOXM1 pathway.', 'mTOR/MYC Axis Regulates O-GlcNAc Transferase Expression and O-GlcNAcylation in Breast Cancer.', 'Intracellular protein O-GlcNAc modification integrates nutrient status with transcriptional and metabolic regulation.', 'Role of O-GlcNAcylation on cancer stem cells: Connecting nutrient sensing to cell plasticity.', 'Signaling pathways in cancer metabolism: mechanisms and therapeutic targets.', 'The Hexosamine Biosynthesis Pathway: Regulation and Function.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-secreted glucosamine alters the androgen biosynthesis program in prostate cancer via HSD3B1 upregulation.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Glycoproteomic Workflows for Cancer Biomarker Discovery.', 'Overview of Cancer Metabolism and Signaling Transduction.']"""

ATF2 regulates target gene expression by binding to the cyclic AMP-response element as a homodimer or a heterodimer with c-Jun. Cytoplasmic localization of ATF2 was observed in melanoma, brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer disease, prostate cancer specimens, and ionizing radiation-treated prostate cancer cells, suggesting that alteration of ATF2 subcellular localization may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We previously demonstrated that ATF2 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and it contains two nuclear localization signals in the basic region and one nuclear export signal (NES) in the leucine zipper domain (named LZ-NES). In the present study, we demonstrate that a hydrophobic stretch in the N terminus, (1)MKFKLHV(7), also functions as an NES (termed N-NES) in a chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent manner. Mutation of both N-NES and LZ-NES results in a predominant nuclear localization, whereas mutation of each individual NES only partially increases the nuclear localization. These results suggest that cytoplasmic localization of ATF2 requires function of at least one of the NESs. Further, mutation of N-NES enhances the transcriptional activity of ATF2, suggesting that the novel NES negatively regulates the transcriptional potential of ATF2. Thus, ATF2 subcellular localization is probably modulated by multiple mechanisms, and further understanding of the regulation of ATF2 subcellular localization under various pathological conditions will provide insight into the pathophysiological role of ATF2 in human diseases.""","""['Chih-Chao Hsu', 'Chang-Deng Hu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Mutual regulation of c-Jun and ATF2 by transcriptional activation and subcellular localization.', 'Inhibition of melanoma growth by small molecules that promote the mitochondrial localization of ATF2.', 'Using a Simple Cellular Assay to Map NES Motifs in Cancer-Related Proteins, Gain Insight into CRM1-Mediated NES Export, and Search for NES-Harboring Micropeptides.', 'The activating transcription factor 2: an influencer of cancer progression.', 'ATF2: a transcription factor that elicits oncogenic or tumor suppressor activities.', 'The two-faced role of ATF2 on cisplatin response in gastric cancer depends on p53 context.', 'Cholesterol Sulfotransferase SULT2B1b Modulates Sensitivity to Death Receptor Ligand TNFα in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'ATF2 promotes urothelial cancer outgrowth via cooperation with androgen receptor signaling.', 'ATF2, a paradigm of the multifaceted regulation of transcription factors in biology and disease.', 'Cholesterol Sulfonation Enzyme, SULT2B1b, Modulates AR and Cell Growth Properties in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We evaluated 157 tag SNPs in the 8q24 chromosomal region between 120.91 Mb and 128.78 Mb (including rs1562430, rs1447295, and rs6983267) in a case-control study of 344 PTC cases and 452 age and gender frequency-matched controls. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and compute P values of linear trend for PTC with genotypes of interest. To account for multiple comparisons, we applied the false discovery rate (FDR) method.  Results:   We did not find a significant association between rs1562430, rs1447295, or rs6983267 and PTC risk. We found that one SNP (rs4733616) was associated with PTC risk at P = .003, and 12 other SNPs were associated with PTC risk at P < .05. However, no SNPs remained significant after FDR correction.

Mice with enforced prostate-specific expression of one such receptor variant, AR-E231G, invariably develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia by 12 weeks and metastatic prostate cancer by 52 weeks. The aim of this study was to identify genes with altered expression in the prostates of AR-E231G mice at an early stage of disease that may act as drivers of AR-mediated tumorigenesis. The gene expression profile of AR-E231G prostate tissue from 12-week-old mice was compared to an equivalent profile from mice expressing the AR-T857A receptor variant (analogous to the AR-T877A variant in LNCaP cells), which do not develop prostate tumors. One hundred and thirty-two genes were differentially expressed in AR-E231G prostates. Classification of these genes revealed enrichment for cellular pathways known to be involved in prostate cancer, including cell cycle and lipid metabolism. Suppression of two genes upregulated in the AR-E231G model, ADM and CITED1, increased cell death and reduced proliferation of human prostate cancer cells. Many genes differentially expressed in AR-E231G prostates are also deregulated in human tumors. Three of these genes, ID4, NR2F1 and PTGDS, which were expressed at consistently lower levels in clinical prostate cancer compared to nonmalignant tissues, formed a signature that predicted biochemical relapse (hazard ratio 2.2, p = 0.038).

The aim of this study was to assess whether MR endorectal imaging of the prostate in a multi-reader ambulatory care setting may assist in patient selection for re-biopsy.  Materials and methods:   115 consecutive pts with persistent PSA elevation, negative Bx, DRE and TRUS were examined using T2w axial and coronal and T1w axial sequences for tumor diagnosis. MR images were prospectively read as tumor-suspicious or tumor-negative by the MR radiologist on duty. Additionally, a retrospective readout of a prostate MR expert and an abdominal imaging fellowship-trained radiologist was performed to evaluate the effect of the reader's experience on tumor detection. Imaging findings were compared to the results of the repeat Bx (61 pts) or the clinical course of at least two years.  Results:   For the prospective reading, the sensitivity of MRI was 83 %, the specificity was 69 %, the PPV was 33 % and the NPV was 96 %. ROC analysis revealed a significantly better performance of the prostate MR imaging expert compared to the abdominal imaging radiologist (area under ROC 0.88 vs. 0.66, p < 0.001). Based on the prospective reading, a pre-test probability for PCa of 17.4 % as in our study can be reduced to 5 % when obtaining a tumor-negative result in MRI.  Conclusion:   MR imaging in a multi-reader ambulatory care setting assists in patient selection for re-biopsy. Reducing the post-test probability for PCa to 5 % allows for further follow-up instead of re-biopsy in MR tumor-negative patients.

By calculating the integral difference in melt temperature between samples and a methylated control, and biasing PCR primers for unmethylated CpGs, the assay demonstrates enhanced sensitivity to detect changes in methylation in a cell line treated with low doses of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza). The L1 assay was confirmed to be a good marker of changes in DNA methylation of L1 elements at multiple regions across the genome when compared with total 5-methyl-cytosine content, measured by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). The assay design was also used to detect changes in methylation at other murine repeat elements (B1 and Intracisternal-A-particle Long-terminal Repeat elements). Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that L1 methylation changes were non-uniform across the CpGs within the L1-HRM target region, demonstrating that the L1 assay can detect small changes in CpG methylation among a large pool of heterogeneously methylated DNA templates. Application of the assay to various tissues from Balb/c and CBA mice, including previously unreported peripheral blood (PB), revealed a tissue hierarchy (from hypermethylated to hypomethylated) of PB > kidney > liver > prostate > spleen. CBA mice demonstrated overall greater methylation than Balb/c mice, and male mice demonstrated higher tissue methylation compared with female mice in both strains. Changes in DNA methylation have been reported to be an early and fundamental event in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including cancer. Mouse studies designed to identify modulators of DNA methylation, the critical doses, relevant time points and the tissues affected are limited by the low throughput nature and exorbitant cost of many DNA methylation assays.

Methods:   A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was administered in a random subsample (n=357, stratified by treatment) of a population-based sample (n=1381) of men, recurrence-free 3 years after diagnosis of LPC, and 65 age-matched controls (without prostate cancer). Survival gains needed to justify persistent problems were estimated by substituting side effect and survival parameters from the DCE into an equation for compensating variation (adapted from welfare economics).  Results:   Median (2.5, 97.5 centiles) survival benefits needed to justify severe erectile dysfunction and severe loss of libido were 4.0 (3.4, 4.6) and 5.0 (4.9, 5.2) months.

The solvent fractions (n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol) were obtained from a crude extract (80% methanol extract) of Dangyuja leaves. We first found that the chloroform fraction of Dangyuja leaves (DCF) was the most cytotoxic against DU145 cells. DCF inhibited constitutive STAT3 activation through blocking upstream Janus-like kinase 2 and c-Src. Consistent with STAT3 inactivation, DCF down-regulated the expression of STAT3 target genes, including bcl-2, bcl-xl, and cyclin D1; this correlated with the suppression of proliferation, the accumulation of cell cycle at the sub-G(1) phase, and the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, DCF exerted a relatively minor effect on the growth of human prostate noncancerous RWPE-1 cells.

For patients failing first-line docetaxel no standard has emerged.  Objectives:   The outcome in routine daily clinical practice of a cohort of unselected chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients treated with docetaxel plus methylprednisolone as first- and further-line treatment in a single institution was investigated.  Patients and methods:   Data from the medical records of patients treated with docetaxel plus methylprednisolone either in a three-weekly (75 mg/m(2)) (D3) or a three-of-four-weekly (35 mg/m(2))(D1) schedule as first- or further-line treatment were analysed with respect to clinical and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, time-on-treatment (TOT), treatment-free interval (TFI), overall survival time (OS) and toxicity and were compared to the results of the registration study TAX 327.  Results:   Out of 41 patients, 28 and 13 received first-line docetaxel according to the D3 and the D1 schedules respectively. An overall PSA response ≥50% was achieved in thirty patients (73%). In ten patients (24%) the PSA level was normalised. The median OS of the total population was 18.7 months. No significant differences were observed between the D3 and the D1 regimens with respect to PSA response, duration of PSA response, TOT, TFI and OS. Patients obtaining a normalisation of PSA level achieved a significantly superior OS, TOT and TFI compared to those without normalisation of PSA. Second-line treatment with docetaxel in nine patients induced a normalisation in PSA level in two (22%). The TOT and TFI from the start of second-line treatment, was significantly superior in docetaxel compared to non-docetaxel treated patients. Treatment with docetaxel was well-tolerated and only two patients were withdrawn for non-haematological toxicity during first- and further-line treatment. There were no differences in either subjective or objective side-effects between both treatment schedules.

Methods:   A multicenter randomized controlled trial compared 2 versions of a computerized patient decision aid: only structured information compared to the structured information plus values clarification exercises. Assessments were conducted during the decision aid visit; telephone follow-up interviews were conducted when patients made their decisions with their physician, 3 months after completing treatment, and >1 year later (per a mailing). Outcome measures included the Decisional Conflict Scale, the Preparation for Decision Making Scale, and the Decision Regret Scale.  Results:   A total of 156 patients participated, 75 provided information only and 81 provided information plus values clarification exercises. The groups did not differ significantly on any outcome evaluated at the decision aid visit; in both groups, decisional conflict decreased immediately after using the decision aid. Between-group differences emerged after the decision was actually made. The values clarification exercises group reported higher Preparation for Decision Making Scale scores at the decision follow-up and at the >1-year follow-up. Regret did not differ significantly between groups at the 3-month follow-up but was lower for the values clarification exercises group than for the information group at the >1-year follow-up.

Its mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, but previous studies show anti-angiogenic effects and strong interaction with the S100A9 protein.  Methods:   This study was performed to evaluate if tasquinimod inhibits prostate cancer metastasis, by using both orthotopic and intratibial xenograft models. Animals were treated with tasquinimod, and tumor growth characteristics as well as molecular markers for metastasis and angiogenesis were analyzed.  Results:   The results show that formation of lung and lymph node metastases from orthotopic castration resistant prostate tumors was inhibited by tasquinimod treatment. Importantly, establishment of tumors in the bone after intratibial implantation was suppressed by tasquinimod. In addition, establishment and growth of subcutaneous tumors were affected. Both in primary tumors and serum from treated mice an upregulation of thrombospondin 1 was observed. Further, downregulation of the hypoxia driven genes VEGF, CXCR4, and LOX was detected in the primary tasquinimod-treated tumors and decreased expression of chemotactic ligand SDF-1 was demonstrated in the lungs. Thus, these molecular changes could contribute to the anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic effects of tasquinimod.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, this study and clinical data show that tasquinimod interferes with the metastatic process, presumably by inhibition of tumor establishment. Therefore, tasquinimod is an interesting treatment option for patients with prostate cancer prone to metastasis.""","""['Karin Jennbacken', 'Karin Welén', 'Anders Olsson', 'Bengt Axelsson', 'Marie Törngren', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Tomas Leanderson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Tasquinimod inhibits prostate cancer growth in bone through alterations in the bone microenvironment.', 'The quinoline-3-carboxamide anti-angiogenic agent, tasquinimod, enhances the anti-prostate cancer efficacy of androgen ablation and taxotere without effecting serum PSA directly in human xenografts.', 'Tasquinimod (ABR-215050), a quinoline-3-carboxamide anti-angiogenic agent, modulates the expression of thrombospondin-1 in human prostate tumors.', 'From bevacizumab to tasquinimod: angiogenesis as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'A review of tasquinimod in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Neutrophils as potential therapeutic targets in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Role of RAGE and Its Ligands on Inflammatory Responses to Brain Tumors.', 'Design and Synthesis of New Quinoxaline Derivatives as Potential Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Targeting Hepatocellular Carcinoma: In Silico, In Vitro, and SAR Studies.', 'The S100 Protein Family as Players and Therapeutic Targets in Pulmonary Diseases.', 'High Monocyte Count and Expression of S100A9 and S100A12 in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Are Associated with Poor Outcome in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

At puberty, the intercristal diameter of girls enlarges rapidly under the influence of estrogen. We speculated that high maternal estrogen concentrations during pregnancy initiate hormonal cancers in their daughters. Here, we examine the association between the mothers' intercristal diameters and prostate cancer in their sons.  Methods:   Using the national cancer registry we identified 221 cases of prostate cancer among 6,975 men born during 1934-1944 in Helsinki, Finland. Four thousand four hundred and one of these men had their mother's bony pelvic measurements recorded: there were 149 cases among them.  Results:   Hazard ratios for prostate cancer rose as the mother's intercristal diameter increased; but this association was restricted to men who were born before 40 weeks of gestation. Among these men the hazard ratio was 1.27 (95% CI 1.09-1.48; P = 0.002). The hazard ratio was 2.2 (1.3-3.7; P < 0.001) in men whose mothers weighed more than 80 kg in late pregnancy compared with those whose mothers weighed 60 kg or less.  Conclusions:   These findings are consistent with a conceptual framework for the origins of hormonally dependent cancers that invokes exposure of embryonic tissue to maternal sex hormones followed by resetting of the fetal hypothalamic-gonadotropin axis in late gestation.

In a prior study we showed that BMS-777607, a novel selective small molecule Met kinase inhibitor, potently suppressed ligand-mediated functions in prostate cancer cells. Herein we evaluated the impact of this agent on the potential of the highly metastatic murine KHT sarcoma that carries constitutive activated c-Met. MET gene knockdown was found to reduce spontaneous cell scatter and motility, suggesting a c-Met-dependent disseminating ability in KHT cells. Furthermore, BMS-777607 treatment potently inhibited KHT cell scatter, motility and invasion at doses in the nanomolar range. In contrast, cell proliferation and clonogenicity were modestly affected by BMS-777607. At the molecular level, BMS-777607 potently blocked phosphorylation of c-Met and downstream pathways over the same dose range that impacted metastasis-associated cell functions. In vivo, daily treatment with BMS-777607 (25 mg/kg/day) over the course of the study significantly decreased the number of KHT lung tumor nodules (28.3 ± 14.9%, P < 0.001) without apparent systemic toxicity. While treatment for short intervals (day 1 or 4) clearly reduced the foci number, delaying the initiation of BMS-777607 treatment until 8 days after tumor cell injection failed to show any reduction, implying that impairment of the initiation phases of the secondary growth via c-Met targeting is required to constrain the formation of macroscopic metastases.

Thus, exercise, as a modifiable health behavior, has a strong potential for primary cancer prevention. Current recommendations call for at least 30-60 min of moderate to vigorous activity daily. Physical activity is also increasingly gaining importance in cancer treatment and is now considered to be feasible, safe, and even recommended in almost all stages of disease.

Methods and materials:   Twelve consecutive patients with anal cancer treated by combined chemoradiation by use of helical tomotherapy from March 2007 to November 2008 were selected. With patients immobilized and positioned in place, megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) scans were performed before each treatment and were automatically registered to planning CT scans. Patients were shifted per the registration data and treated. A total of 365 MVCT scans were analyzed. The primary site received a median dose of 55 Gy. To evaluate the potential dosimetric advantage(s) of IGRT, cases were replanned according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0529, with and without adding recommended setup variations from the current study.  Results:   Significant setup variations were observed throughout the course of RT. The standard deviations for systematic setup correction in the anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and superior-inferior (SI) directions and roll rotation were 1.1, 3.6, and 3.2 mm, and 0.3°, respectively. The average random setup variations were 3.8, 5.5, and 2.9 mm, and 0.5°, respectively. Without daily IGRT, margins of 4.9, 11.1, and 8.5 mm in the AP, lateral, and SI directions would have been needed to ensure that the planning target volume (PTV) received ≥95% of the prescribed dose. Conversely, daily IGRT required no extra margins on PTV and resulted in a significant reduction of V15 and V45 of intestine and V10 of pelvic bone marrow.

To address this need we previously developed, as a potential add-on device for existing linear accelerators, a novel telerobotic ultrasound system capable of real-time, soft-tissue imaging. Expanding on this capability, the aim of this work was to develop and characterize an image-based technique for real-time detection of prostate displacements.  Methods and materials:   Image processing techniques were implemented on spatially localized ultrasound images to generate two parameters representing prostate displacements in real time. In a phantom and five volunteers, soft-tissue targets were continuously imaged with a customized robotic manipulator while recording the two tissue displacement parameters (TDPs). Variations of the TDPs in the absence of tissue displacements were evaluated, as was the sensitivity of the TDPs to prostate translations and rotations. Robustness of the approach to probe force was also investigated.  Results:   With 95% confidence, the proposed method detected in vivo prostate displacements before they exceeded 2.3, 2.5, and 2.8 mm in anteroposterior, superoinferior, and mediolateral directions. Prostate pitch was detected before exceeding 4.7° at 95% confidence. Total system time lag averaged 173 ms, mostly limited by ultrasound acquisition rate. False positives (FPs) (FP) in the absence of displacements did not exceed 1.5 FP events per 10 min of continuous in vivo imaging time.  Conclusions:   The feasibility of using telerobotic ultrasound for real-time, soft-tissue-based monitoring of target displacements was confirmed in vivo. Such monitoring has the potential to detect small clinically relevant intrafractional variations of the prostate position during beam delivery.""","""['Jeffrey Schlosser', 'Kenneth Salisbury', 'Dimitre Hristov']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Telerobotic system concept for real-time soft-tissue imaging during radiotherapy beam delivery.', 'First clinical release of an online, adaptive, aperture-based image-guided radiotherapy strategy in intensity-modulated radiotherapy to correct for inter- and intrafractional rotations of the prostate.', 'Real-Time 3D Image Guidance Using a Standard LINAC: Measured Motion, Accuracy, and Precision of the First Prospective Clinical Trial of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring-Guided Gating for Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy: A ""Game Changer"" for Prostate Treatment?', 'The Use of Ultrasound Imaging in the External Beam Radiotherapy Workflow of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Real-time intrafraction motion monitoring in external beam radiotherapy.', 'Technical Note: Characterization of clinical linear accelerator triggering latency for motion management system development.', 'Feasibility study of ultrasound imaging for stereotactic body radiation therapy with active breathing coordinator in pancreatic cancer.', 'Robotic intrafractional US guidance for liver SABR: System design, beam avoidance, and clinical imaging.', 'Monte Carlo modeling of ultrasound probes for image guided radiotherapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   A Monte Carlo model of cellular radiation response was developed. This model incorporated damage from both direct radiation and intercellular communication including bystander signaling. The predictions of this model were compared to previously measured survival curves for a normal human fibroblast line (AGO1522) and prostate tumor cells (DU145) exposed to spatially modulated fields.  Results:   The model was found to be able to accurately reproduce cell survival both in populations which were directly exposed to radiation and those which were outside the primary treatment field. The model predicts that the bystander effect makes a significant contribution to cell killing even in uniformly irradiated cells. The bystander effect contribution varies strongly with dose, falling from a high of 80% at low doses to 25% and 50% at 4 Gy for AGO1522 and DU145 cells, respectively. This was verified using the inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor aminoguanidine to inhibit the bystander effect in cells exposed to different doses, which showed significantly larger reductions in cell killing at lower doses.  Conclusions:   The model presented in this work accurately reproduces cell survival following modulated radiation exposures, both in and out of the primary treatment field, by incorporating a bystander component. In addition, the model suggests that the bystander effect is responsible for a significant portion of cell killing in uniformly irradiated cells, 50% and 70% at doses of 2 Gy in AGO1522 and DU145 cells, respectively.

There is growing evidence that ADT negatively affects men's psychosocial well-being (e.g., causing sexual dysfunction, bodily feminization) and physical health (e.g., increasing the risk of osteoporosis and metabolic syndrome). Although strategies for managing the majority of side effects exist, it is not clear that patients are benefiting from this knowledge.  Methods:   Seventy-nine newly prescribed ADT patients and 54 of their partners were given a checklist of various common and uncommon ADT side effects. They were asked to indicate the drug side effects that they had heard of or anticipated.  Results:   Both patients and their partners were poorly informed about the side effects of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists used for ADT. More than 70% did not know that anemia, memory problems, loss of body hair, and depression can occur following treatment. Over 50% were unaware of significant potential side effects such as reduced muscle mass, osteoporosis, increased fracture risk, weight gain, genital shrinkage, and gynecomastia. Concurrently, more than 20% mistakenly anticipated dizziness and itching.  Conclusion:   The lack of awareness of ADT side effects may partially explain why ADT currently results in significant decreases in the quality of life of patients and their partners. Patients uninformed about side effects do not engage in behaviors to prevent or reduce the risk of adverse effects. Improved efforts to educate patients about treatment side effects and coping strategies may result in improved psychosocial and physical health for CaP patients undergoing ADT.""","""['Lauren M Walker', 'Susan Tran', 'Richard J Wassersug', 'Bejoy Thomas', 'John W Robinson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Contemporary use of hormonal therapy in prostate cancer: managing complications and addressing quality-of-life issues.', 'What do Canadian uro-oncologists believe patients should know about androgen deprivation therapy?', 'Androgen deprivation therapy: evidence-based management of side effects.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy and maintenance of intimacy: a randomized controlled pilot study of an educational intervention for patients and their partners.', 'Optimizing outcomes and quality of life in the hormonal treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Perceptions and recall of treatment for prostate cancer: A survey of two populations.', 'Implementing and Evaluating the Impact of BoneRx: A Healthy Bone Prescription for Men with Prostate Cancer Initiating Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'The Effect of an Information Support Program on Self-Efficacy of Prostate Cancer Patients during Hormonal Therapy.', 'Dietary interventions to improve body composition in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a solution for the growing problem?', 'An Educational Program to Help Patients Manage Androgen Deprivation Therapy Side Effects: Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Outcomes.']"""

To determine infectious complications at catheter removal following radical prostatectomy (RP), another setting in daily urological practice where fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is frequently used.  Materials and methods:   We prospectively examined urine culture results collected from 334 RP patients immediately prior to catheter removal. Patients received prophylactic antibiotics 1 day before, the day of, and for 5 days after catheter removal. Culture results were reviewed for bacterial species and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Patients with positive urine cultures resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic were switched to culture-specific antibiotic therapy and underwent follow-up culture. The frequency of urinary tract infection (UTI), complications, additional antibiotic therapy, and repeat urine cultures was determined within 60 days.  Results:   Of the 334 patients identified, 203 (61%) had cultures with no bacterial growth, and 48 (14%) had colony counts of <1,000 bacteria or Candida albicans and received no further antibiotics. The remaining 83 (25%) had positive culture results, of which 7% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Twenty-four bacterial species were identified, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%) Escherichia coli (4%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (3%) being the most frequent. Only two (0.6%) men developed clinical symptoms consistent with UTI (i.e., suprapubic pain, fever) prior to catheter removal, and no serious complications occurred.  Conclusions:   A substantial proportion of RP patients have positive urine cultures at the time of catheter removal, despite the administration of prophylactic fluoroquinolone antibiotics.

We sought to identify pathological factors predictive for site of local recurrence (LR) after external beam RT.  Methods and materials:   Prospective databases were reviewed to identify men with LR after RT from 1997 through 2009. Patients with biochemical failure and biopsy-confirmed Pca more than 2 years after RT were evaluated. Prediction for site of recurrence based on the following pretreatment factors was determined on independent and cluster-sextant basis: presence of malignancy, dominant vs. nondominant percentage core length (PCL) involvement, PCL ≥ or <40%, and Gleason score. Sites of dominant PCL were defined as sextants with peak PCL involvement minus 10%, and >5% for each patient.  Results:   Forty-one patients with low-intermediate risk Pca constituted the study cohort. Median time to biopsy after RT was 51 months (range, 24-145). Of 246 sextants, 74 were involved with tumor at baseline. When sextants are treated as independent observations the presence of malignancy (77% vs. 22%, p = 0.0001), dominant PCL (90% vs. 46%, p = 0.0001), and PCL ≥40% (89% vs. 68 %, p = 0.04) were found to be significant predictors for LR, although PCL ≥40% did not retain statistical significance if sextants were considered correlated.

Currently, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Because hypoxia causes resistance to radiotherapy, we wanted to test whether castration affects the degree of hypoxia in prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   In 14 patients with locally advanced prostate cancer, six to 12 prostatic needle core biopsy specimens were taken prior to castration therapy. Bilateral orchidectomy was performed in 7 patients, and 7 were treated with a GnRH-agonist (leuprorelin). After castrationm two to four prostatic core biopsy specimens were taken, and the level of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in cancer was determined by immunofluorescence.  Results:   Among biopsy specimens taken before castration, strong HIF-1α expression (mean intensity above 30) was shown in 5 patients, weak expression (mean intensity 10-30) in 3 patients, and background levels of HIF-1α (mean intensity 0-10) in 6 patients. Downregulation of HIF-1α expression after castration was observed in all 5 patients with strong HIF-1α precastration expression. HIF-1α expression was also reduced in 2 of 3 patients with weak HIF-1α precastration expression.

Measurements:   Individual medical histories were reconstructed using information on diagnoses coded in MFSU, dates of medical services and procedures, and Medicare enrollment and disenrollment.  Results:   The majority of diseases (e.g., prostate cancer, asthma, and diabetes mellitus) had a monotonic decline (or decline after a short period of increase) in incidence with age. A monotonic increase in incidence with age with a subsequent leveling off and decline was observed for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, ulcer, and Alzheimer's disease. An inverted U-shaped age pattern was detected for lung and colon carcinomas, Parkinson's disease, and renal failure. The results obtained from the NLTCS-M and SEER-M were in agreement (excluding an excess for circulatory diseases in the NLTCS-M). A sensitivity analysis proved the stability of the incidence rates evaluated.

With the use of bladeless, blunt-tipped entry trocars, some surgeons have argued that not all port sites need fascial closure. Several cases of port-site hernia, however, have been reported recently with the use of bladeless trocars. This study evaluated the incidence of port-site hernias after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) as we routinely closed the fascia of only the midline 12-mm port site.  Patients and methods:   From 2006 to 2009, 498 patients with localized prostate cancer underwent RARP. Bladeless dilating trocars were used in all of our patients. Routinely, six ports were used: two 12 mm, three 8 mm, and one 5 mm. Fascial closure was performed only for the midline supraumbilical 12-mm port site.  Results:   In 498 cases of RARP, there were two port-site hernias (0.4%, 2/498). Both cases occurred at the midline supraumbilical 12-mm camera port site. No hernia developed at nonmidline port sites, including the lateral 12-mm port site.  Conclusion:   Trocar site hernias after RARP are rare. When bladeless dilating trocars are used, routine closure of fascia of non-midline 12-mm or smaller port sites is not necessary. Splitting the muscle and fascia without cutting likely renders routine closure of fascia unnecessary for nonmidline ports that are ≤ 12 mm.""","""['Dong Il Kang', 'Seung Hyo Woo', 'Dong Hyeon Lee', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Re: incidence of port-site hernias after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with the fascial closure of only the midline 12-mm port site.', 'Incidence of port site hernias and/or dehiscence in robotic-assisted procedures in gynecologic oncology patients.', 'Port-site hernias occurring after the use of bladeless radially expanding trocars.', 'VersaStep trocar hernia rate in unclosed fascial defects in bariatric patients.', 'An Expanded Retrospective Review of Trocar Site Hernias in Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Patients.', '5-millimeter Trocar-site Hernias After Laparoscopy Requiring Surgical Repair.', ""Laparoscopic port site Richter's hernia after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy."", 'Incidence and Treatment of Incarcerated Trocar-Site Hernias After Robotic Surgery: Presentation of Three Cases.', 'Incidence of acute postoperative robotic port-site hernias: results from a high-volume multispecialty center.', 'Severe bowel incarceration in an eight-millimeter left-lateral trocar site after robot-assisted laparoscopic colposacropexy: A case report.', 'Complications in robotic urological surgeries and how to avoid them: A systematic review.']"""

Reliable detection of XMRV infection requires the application of multiple diagnostic methods, including detection of human antibodies to XMRV and detection of XMRV nucleic acid.

In this study, we found that the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, a well-established regulator of metabolic signaling, was induced after androgen stimulation of AR-expressing prostate cancer cells. PTP1B induction by androgen occurred at the mRNA and protein levels to increase PTP1B activity. High-resolution chromosome mapping revealed AR recruitment to two response elements within the first intron of the PTP1B encoding gene PTPN1, correlating with an AR-mediated increase in RNA polymerase II recruitment to the PTPN1 transcriptional start site. We found that PTPN1 and AR genes were coamplified in metastatic tumors and that PTPN1 amplification was associated with a subset of high-risk primary tumors. Functionally, PTP1B depletion delayed the growth of androgen-dependent human prostate tumors and impaired androgen-induced cell migration and invasion in vitro. However, PTP1B was also required for optimal cell migration of androgen-independent cells. Collectively, our results established the AR as a transcriptional regulator of PTPN1 transcription and implicated PTP1B in a tumor-promoting role in prostate cancer.

With competing risks, several modeling approaches are available to evaluate the relationship of covariates to cause-specific failures. We discuss the use and interpretation of commonly used competing risks regression models.  Experimental design:   For competing risks analysis, the influence of covariate can be evaluated in relation to cause-specific hazard or on the cumulative incidence of the failure types. We present simulation studies to illustrate how covariate effects differ between these approaches. We then show the implications of model choice in an example from a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) clinical trial for prostate cancer.  Results:   The simulation studies illustrate that, depending on the relationship of a covariate to both the failure type of principal interest and the competing failure type, different models can result in substantially different effects. For example, a covariate that has no direct influence on the hazard of a primary event can still be significantly associated with the cumulative probability of that event, if the covariate influences the hazard of a competing event. This is a logical consequence of a fundamental difference between the model formulations. The example from RTOG similarly shows differences in the influence of age and tumor grade depending on the endpoint and the model type used.

Methods:   We evaluated cell growth, survival and AR signaling parameters of PCa cells after exposure to tanshinones in in vitro models. We also tested the in vivo inhibitory efficacy of tanshinone IIA (TIIA) against LNCaP xenograft model in athymic nude mice.  Results:   For androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, a colony growth assay showed strong inhibitory potency following the order of TIIA≈cryptotanshinone>tanshinone I, being 10-30 folds higher than Casodex (racemic). TIIA inhibited growth of LNCaP cells more than several androgen-independent PCa cell lines. All 3 tested tanshinones were devoid of AR agonist activity under castrate condition. Mechanistically, tanshinones inhibited AR nuclear translocation within 2 h, decreased protein and mRNA abundance of AR and its target prostate-specific antigen within 12 h, and stimulated proteosomal degradation of AR. Oral administration of TIIA (25 mg/kg, once daily) retarded LNCaP xenograft growth and down-regulated tumor AR abundance in athymic nude mice.

The aim of this work is to investigate pre-treatment patient-specific per-field QCs performed with an on-board EPID at the gantry angle of 0° and at the treatment ones, and to asses if measurements executed at 0° are able to guarantee a correct treatment. Ten patients with prostate cancer were evaluated. Two ""verification"" plans were created for each patient in order to calculate the dose at the EPID surface: one with all fields positioned at 0° and one with all fields at the actual treatment angles. EPID's mechanical shifts due to gravity effects were always taken into account and corrected. 0 and no-0 plans were compared using a gamma-index method (3%, 3 mm). The gamma index was found dependent on gantry angles but the difference between 0 and no-0 samples was small (-0.3% mean value) and the criteria of acceptability of the gamma method was always satisfied for every field delivered at angles different from 0. Therefore patient-specific pre-treatment QCs should be done at treatments angles, but, if periodical quality assurance is performed on dynamic MLC for different gantry angles, this requirement was shown not strictly mandatory and pre-treatment IMRTQC can be reasonably executed at 0° angles too.""","""['Angelo Filippo Monti', 'Chiara Berlusconi', 'Stefania Gelosa']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Incorporation of gantry angle correction for 3D dose prediction in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Independent verification of gantry angle for pre-treatment VMAT QA using EPID.', 'Implementation of phantom-less IMRT delivery verification using Varian DynaLog files and R/V output.', 'Gantry angle-dependent correction of dose detection error due to panel position displacement in IMRT dose verification using EPIDs.', 'Quality assurance of volumetric modulated arc therapy using Elekta Synergy.']"""

Cows' milk contains phyto-oestrogens and the content varies according to the composition of the feed and the type and amount of legumes used. In this study we evaluated the proliferative effect of milk (whey) with different phyto-oestrogen content in human breast (MCF-7) and prostate cancer cells (PC-3). Milk was obtained from cows fed either a birdsfoot trefoil-timothy silage based ration (B1) or two different red clover silage based diets (R1 and R2) resulting in total phyto-oestrogen contents of 403, 1659 and 1434 ng/ml for the B1, R1 and R2 diets, respectively. Whey was produced from the milk and added to cell culture medium in concentrations up to 10% for MCF-7 cells and 5% for PC-3 cells. Cell proliferation was measured fluorometrically after 7 d for MCF-7 cells and 5 d for PC-3 cells. There was no significant difference in the proliferative effect of whey from the different dietary treatments at any of the whey concentrations tested. An anti-proliferative effect (P<0·01) of 5 and 10% whey was seen when tested in the presence of 10 pM oestradiol in the medium. This effect was independent of dietary treatment of cows. Whey induced a significant (P<0·01) proliferative response in PC-3 cells independent of dietary treatment. Purified equol in concentrations similar to equol concentrations in milk decreased PC-3 cell proliferation, and therefore the stimulatory effect of whey in PC-3 cells is believed to be mediated by other bioactives than equol. In conclusion, our results suggest that using whey in these proliferation assays, it was not possible to discriminate between milk with high or low levels of phyto-oestrogens.""","""['Tina S Nielsen', 'Annika Höjer', 'Anne-Maj Gustavsson', 'Jens Hansen-Møller', 'Stig Purup']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Dairy Res""","""['Effects of feeding dairy cows different legume-grass silages on milk phytoestrogen concentration.', ""Proliferative effect of whey from cows' milk obtained at two different stages of pregnancy measured in MCF-7 cells."", 'Effects of clover-grass silages and concentrate supplementation on the content of phytoestrogens in dairy cow milk.', 'Phyto-oestrogens, their mechanism of action: current evidence for a role in breast and prostate cancer.', 'Phyto-oestrogens and breast cancer chemoprevention.', 'Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Secondary Metabolites from Trifolium baccarinii Chiov.

The chemical compositions of the active extracts were also determined. In the present study, we set out to determine whether the anticancer effects of guava leaves are linked with their ability to suppress constitutive AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation pathways in human prostate cancer cells. We found that guava leaf hexane fraction (GHF) was the most potent inducer of cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in PC-3 cells. The molecular mechanism or mechanisms of GHF apoptotic potential were correlated with the suppression of AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and MAPK signaling pathways. This effect of GHF correlated with down-regulation of various proteins that mediate cell proliferation, cell survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Analysis of GHF by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry tentatively identified 60 compounds, including β-eudesmol (11.98%), α-copaene (7.97%), phytol (7.95%), α-patchoulene (3.76%), β-caryophyllene oxide (CPO) (3.63%), caryophylla-3(15),7(14)-dien-6-ol (2.68%), (E)-methyl isoeugenol (1.90%), α-terpineol (1.76%), and octadecane (1.23%). Besides GHF, CPO, but not phytol, also inhibited the AKT/mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.
