Autocrine-paracrine signalling pathways between prostate cancer epithelial cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts stimulate aberrant bone remodelling, and the activity of these three cell populations can be quantitatively measured using prostate-specific antigen (PSA), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and urine N-telopeptide (uNTx), respectively. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that serial measurements of BAP and uNTx during therapy would facilitate monitoring of disease activity and predict the overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic prostate cancer receiving therapy.  Methods:   Radionuclide bone scan, PSA, BAP, and uNTx data were retrospectively analysed from three clinical trials in patients with metastatic prostate cancer conducted at our institution. Qualitative changes in bone scans and quantitative changes in PSA, BAP, and uNTx concentrations during therapy were correlated with OS.  Results:   Baseline levels of BAP, but not PSA, were prognostic for OS in both androgen-dependent and castrate-resistant disease. A reduction in PSA, BAP, uNTx, or BAP/uNTx on therapy was predictive of improved OS in both patient groups. Conversely, an increase in PSA, or BAP on therapy was predictive of worse OS in both patient groups. Baseline number of lesions and response on bone scan during therapy were neither prognostic nor predictive of OS in either patient group.  Conclusion:   These observations support the concept that serial measurements of bone turnover metabolites during therapy function as clinically informative predictive biomarkers in patients with advanced prostate cancer and skeletal metastases. PSA measurements and bone scans remain essential to monitor the overall disease activity and determine the anatomic distribution of skeletal metastases.""","""['A Som', 'S-M Tu', 'J Liu', 'X Wang', 'W Qiao', 'C Logothetis', 'P G Corn']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of PSA, free PSA, PSMA, and total and bone alkaline phosphatase levels compared to bone scans in the management of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Bone scintigraphy as a new imaging biomarker: the relationship between bone scan index and bone metabolic markers in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Biochemical markers of bone turnover and clinical outcomes in men with prostate cancer.', 'Evolving role of bone biomarkers in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'N-telopeptide as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for bone metastasis in human cancers: A meta-analysis.', 'Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting the overall survival of prostate cancer patients: a large population-based cohort study.', 'Whole-Body 18F-Fluoride PET SUV Imaging to Monitor Response to Dasatinib Therapy in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases: Secondary Results from ACRIN 6687.', 'Impact of Extraskeletal Metastases on Skeletal-Related Events in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with Bone Metastases.', 'A National Multicenter Study on overall survival in elderly metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with Radium-223.']"""

Delivery accuracy in terms of machine performance was quantified by multileaf collimator (MLC) position errors and fluence delivery accuracy for patients receiving intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment. The relationship between machine performance and plan complexity, quantified by the modulation complexity score (MCS) was also investigated. Actual MLC positions and delivered fraction of monitor units (MU), recorded every 50 ms during IMRT delivery, were extracted from the DynaLog files. The planned MLC positions and fractional MU were taken from the record and verify system MLC control file. Planned and delivered beam data were compared to determine leaf position errors with and without the overshoot effect. Analysis was also performed on planned and actual fluence maps reconstructed from the MLC control file and delivered treatment log files respectively. This analysis was performed for all treatment fractions for 5 prostate, 5 prostate and pelvic node (PPN) and 5 head and neck (H&N) IMRT plans, totalling 82 IMRT fields in ∼5500 DynaLog files. The root mean square (RMS) leaf position errors without the overshoot effect were 0.09, 0.26, 0.19 mm for the prostate, PPN and H&N plans respectively, which increased to 0.30, 0.39 and 0.30 mm when the overshoot effect was considered. Average errors were not affected by the overshoot effect and were 0.05, 0.13 and 0.17 mm for prostate, PPN and H&N plans respectively. The percentage of pixels passing fluence map gamma analysis at 3%/3 mm was 99.94 ± 0.25%, which reduced to 91.62 ± 11.39% at 1%/1 mm criterion. Leaf position errors, but not gamma passing rate, were directly related to plan complexity as determined by the MCS. Site specific confidence intervals for average leaf position errors were set at -0.03-0.12 mm for prostate and -0.02-0.28 mm for more complex PPN and H&N plans. For all treatment sites confidence intervals for RMS errors with the overshoot was set at 0-0.50 mm and for the percentage of pixels passing a gamma analysis at 1%/1 mm a confidence interval of 68.83% was set also for all treatment sites. This work demonstrates the successful implementation of treatment log files to validate IMRT deliveries and how dynamic log files can diagnose delivery errors not possible with phantom based QC. Machine performance was found to be directly related to plan complexity but this is not the dominant determinant of delivery accuracy.""","""['C E Agnew', 'R B King', 'A R Hounsell', 'C K McGarry']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Evaluation of MLC leaf positioning accuracy for static and dynamic IMRT treatments using DAVID in vivo dosimetric system.', 'Correlation of phantom-based and log file patient-specific QA with complexity scores for VMAT.', 'A method to reconstruct and apply 3D primary fluence for treatment delivery verification.', 'Utilising the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training System to Support Undergraduate Teaching of IMRT, VMAT, DCAT Treatment Planning, and QA Concepts.', 'Direct aperture optimization as a means of reducing the complexity of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy plans.', 'Comparison of MLC positioning deviations using log files and establishment of specific assessment parameters for different accelerators with IMRT and VMAT.', 'Insensitivity of machine log files to MLC leaf backlash and effect of MLC backlash on clinical dynamic MLC motion: An experimental investigation.', 'An Investigation of Multileaf Collimator Performance Dependence on Gantry Angle Using Machine Log Files.', 'Evaluation of 4-Hz log files and secondary Monte Carlo dose calculation as patient-specific quality assurance for VMAT prostate plans.', 'Correlation of the gamma passing rates with the differences in the dose-volumetric parameters between the original VMAT plans and actual deliveries of the VMAT plans.']"""

Methods:   Demographic, clinical and pathological data of patients undergoing RP between 1993-2010 were reviewed and compared between African-American (AA) and non African-American (nAA) men. Further assessments of pathological tumor burden (estimated tumor volume, percent of cancer involvement, and estimated tumor volume/PSA ratios) were performed across Gleason score categories.  Results:   Of 4157 patients in the analysis, 604 (14.5%) were AA. Overall, AA patients were younger, had higher Gleason scores, PSA levels and incidence of palpable disease (all P < 0.001). Despite comparable prostate weights (39.4 vs. 39.6 g), AA men had higher percent cancer involvement and estimated tumor volume (all P < 0.001) but similar estimated tumor volume/PSA ratios ( P> 0.05). When stratified by Gleason scores, prostate weights were comparable; however, estimated tumor volume, percent cancer involvement and estimated tumor volume/PSA ratios were higher in AA men with low grade (≤ 6) prostate cancer (PCa), similar in intermediate grade (7-8) and lower in high grade (9-10) PCa compared to nAA men.  Conclusions:   In this large series, AA patients had higher disease burden (estimated tumor volume, percent cancer involvement, estimated tumor volume/PSA ratios) compared to nAA but this association was especially pronounced in low grade (Gleason ≤ 6) cancers.

However, available evidence on prostate cancer is conflicting. We therefore examined the association between Type 2 diabetes and risk of prostate cancer by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of all studies published regarding this subject.  Methods:   PubMed database and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for epidemiological studies (published between 1970 and 2011), investigating the relationship between Type 2 diabetes and prostate cancer. Pooled risk ratio (RR) was calculated using random-effects model. Subgroup, sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis were also done.  Results:   Forty-five studies (29 cohort and 16 case-control studies) involving 8.1 million participants and 132 331 prostate cancer cases detected a significant inverse association between Type 2 diabetes and risk of prostate cancer (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-0.92). For cohort studies alone, the RR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.80-0.94), and for case-control studies alone, the RR was 0.85 (95% CI 0.74-0.96). Sensitivity analysis done by excluding one outlier further strengthened our negative association (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.87). No evidence of publication bias was observed.

A comprehensive description of the burden of cancer mortality among Italian elderly (65-84 years of age) in the last four decades has not been carried out yet. Cancer mortality rates were used to describe time trends between 1970-2008.  Methods:   Mortality counts, provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics, were grouped according to data availability: in quinquennia from 1970-74 through 1995-99, and in 2000-03 and 2006-08 groups. Age-standardized rates (world population) were computed by calendar periods while annual percent changes (APCs) were computed for elderly and middle aged (35-64 years) people for the period 1995-2008.  Results:   The number of cancer deaths in elderly nearly doubled between 1970-74 (31,400 deaths/year in men, and 24,000 in women) and 2006-08 (63,000 deaths/year in men, and 42,000 in women). Overall cancer mortality rates peaked during the quinquennia 1985-89 and 1990-94 (about 1,500/100,000 in men and 680 in women) and declined thereafter. Throughout 1995-2008 cancer mortality rates decreased by -1.6%/year in men and -0.9%/year in women. These decreases were mainly driven by cancers of the stomach, bladder, prostate, and lung (APC = -3.3%, -2.7%, -2.5%, -2.2%, respectively) in men, and by cancers of the stomach, bladder, and breast (APC = -3.5%, -1.9%, -1.1%, respectively) in women. Conversely, increases in mortality rates between 1995 and 2008 were recorded for lung cancer (APC = +0.6%) in women, cutaneous melanoma (APC = +1.7%) in men, and pancreatic cancer (APC = +0.6% in men and +0.9% in women).  Conclusions:   Overall favorable trends in cancer mortality were observed among Italian elderly between 1995 and 2008. Early diagnosis, improved efficacy of anti-cancer treatments and management of comorbidities are the most likely explanations of these positive observations. However, enduring preventive interventions against the most common risk factor (e.g. cigarette smoking), early diagnosis, and access to care should be reconsidered and extended to match the reductions of cancer mortality recorded in the elderly with those in the middle aged.""","""['Ettore Bidoli', 'Lucia Fratino', 'Silvia Bruzzone', 'Marilena Pappagallo', 'Paolo De Paoli', 'Umberto Tirelli', 'Diego Serraino']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2009: Cancer trend (1998-2005).', 'Incidence and mortality trends for four major cancers in the elderly and middle-aged adults: an international comparison.', 'Common cancers in the elderly.', 'Time trends and geographic distribution of hepatocellular carcinoma in Brazil: An ecological study.', 'Objective assessment of tumor regression in post-neoadjuvant therapy resections for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: comparison of multiple tumor regression grading systems.', 'The lncRNA SLNCR Recruits the Androgen Receptor to EGR1-Bound Genes in Melanoma and Inhibits Expression of Tumor Suppressor p21.', 'The stem cell-specific intermediate filament nestin missense variation p.A1199P is associated with pancreatic cancer.', 'Accuracy of clinical diagnosis, mammography and ultrasonography in preoperative assessment of breast cancer.']"""

Of the studies that examine age, gender and marital status as predictors of a range of patient outcomes, none examines the interactions between these demographic variables. This study examined the typical trajectory of common practical and psychosocial problems endorsed over 12 months in a usual-care sample of cancer outpatients. Specifically, we examined whether marital status, sex, age, and their interactions predicted these trajectories. We did not actively triage or refer patients in this study in order to examine the natural course of problem reports.  Methods:   Patients completed baseline screening (N = 1196 of 1707 approached) and the sample included more men (N = 696) than women (N = 498), average age 61.1 years. The most common diagnoses were gastrointestinal (27.1%), prostate (19.2%), skin (11.1%) and gynecological (9.2%). Among other measures, patients completed a Common Problem Checklist and Psychosocial Resources Use questions at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months using paper and pencil surveys.  Results:   Results indicated that patients reported psychosocial problems more often than practical and both decreased significantly over time. Younger single patients reported more practical problems than those in committed relationships. Younger patients and women of all ages reported more psychosocial problems. Among a number of interesting interactions, for practical problems, single older patients improved more; whereas among married people, younger patients improved more. For psychosocial problems we found that older female patients improved more than younger females, but among males, it was younger patients who improved more. Young single men and women reported the most past-and future-use of services.  Conclusions:   Younger women are particularly vulnerable to experiencing practical and psychosocial problems when diagnosed with cancer, but being married protects these younger women. Marriage appeared to buffer reports of both practical and psychosocial problems, and led to less awareness and use of services. Unexpectedly, young men reported the highest use of psychosocial services.

Somatic mutations of DNMT3A gene, including recurrent mutations in its Arg-882, were recently reported in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), strongly suggesting its role in development of AML. To see whether DNMT3A mutation occurs in other malignancies as well, we analyzed DNMT3A in 916 cancer tissues from 401 hematologic malignancies (AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), multiple myelomas and lymphomas) and 515 carcinomas (lung, breast, prostate, colorectal and gastric carcinomas) using a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay. We identified DNMT3A mutations, especially the Arg-882 mutations, in adulthood AML (9.4%). In addition, we found DNMT3A mutations in pre-B-ALL and three lung cancers at lower frequencies. Allelic loss of DNMT3A was frequently observed in most cancer types analyzed, including lymphomas (48.1%), gastric cancers (23.5%) and lung cancers (18.3%) irrespective of DNMT3A mutation. Also, loss of DNMT3A expression was common in lung cancers (46.4%), and was associated with the allelic loss. Our data indicate that DNMT3A gene is mutated mainly in AML, but it occurs in other cancers, such as ALL and lung cancer, despite the lower incidences. Also, the data suggest that DNMT3A is altered in many cancer types by various ways, including somatic mutations, allelic loss and loss of expression that might play roles in tumorigenesis.""","""['Min S Kim', 'Yoo R Kim', 'Nam J Yoo', 'Sug H Lee']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""APMIS""","""['Incidence and prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations in Korean normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia patients.', 'Mutational analysis of tumour suppressor gene NF2 in common solid cancers and acute leukaemias.', 'DNMT3A mutations in Chinese childhood acute myeloid leukemia.', 'AML-Associated Mutations in DNA Methyltransferase DNMT3A.', 'Acute myeloid leukemia with DNMT3A mutations.', 'Epigenetic regulation in hematopoiesis and its implications in the targeted therapy of hematologic malignancies.', 'PAX5 and TDT-Negative B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with Unusual Genetic Mutations: A Case Report.', 'DNMT3A R882H mutation drives daunorubicin resistance in acute myeloid leukemia via regulating NRF2/NQO1 pathway.', 'Aberrant DNA methylation in multiple myeloma: A major obstacle or an opportunity?', 'Myelodysplasia Syndrome, Clonal Hematopoiesis and Cardiovascular Disease.']"""

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Prostate cancer has three known clinical risk factors: age, ethnicity and family history. Men's knowledge of prostate cancer is low. This study demonstrates that men rely on family and friends to learn about prostate cancer and help them interpret their risk. The findings suggest the need for tailored prostate cancer education, through social networks, to encourage risk-stratified PSA testing, which will lead to earlier diagnosis for those most at risk.  Objectives:   To determine men's perceptions of their risk of developing prostate cancer. To consider the implications for PSA testing based on individual risk perceptions.  Patients and methods:   The research adopted an embedded mixed-method design, using clinical records and a retrospective postal survey. Patients (N = 474) diagnosed with prostate cancer in a two-year period (2008-2009) in Greater Glasgow were identified from pathology records. In all, 458 men received a postal survey (16 deceased patients were excluded); 320 men responded (70%).  Results:   Analysis indicates that there is no association between known clinical risk factors and men's perceptions of their own risk. Older men did not display increased perceived risk. Men with a family history of prostate cancer (11%) had no increase in their own perception of risk. PSA tests are not requested by those who are at greater risk. The subsample of patients who had requested a test were no more likely to have a family history of prostate cancer. They were more likely, however, to perceive themselves to be at high risk, to have friends with prostate cancer, to be affluent and to have a low grade tumour.  Conclusions:   GPs need to balance men's risk perceptions in discussions about known clinical risk factors. Men's knowledge of prostate cancer stems largely from interpersonal sources (such as friends/family). Social networks may consequently offer an additional opportunity to increase awareness of risk-stratified testing.""","""['Liz Forbat', 'Morag Place', 'Daniel Kelly', 'Gill Hubbard', 'Kenny Boyd', 'Kate Howie', 'Hing Y Leung']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""[""Men's preferences and trade-offs for prostate cancer screening: a discrete choice experiment."", 'The influence of family history on cognitive heuristics, risk perceptions, and prostate cancer screening behavior.', ""Informed decision making and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer: a randomised controlled trial exploring the impact of a brief patient decision aid on men's knowledge, attitudes and intention to be tested."", 'Perceptions of prostate cancer in Black African and Black Caribbean men: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.', 'Patient-Provider Communication About Prostate Cancer Screening and Treatment: New Evidence From the Health Information National Trends Survey.', ""The role of interpersonal relationships in men's attendance in primary care: qualitative findings in a cohort of men with prostate cancer."", 'Cancer awareness among adolescents in Britain: a cross-sectional study.']"""

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Erectile dysfunction following radical prostatectomy (RP) is among the most common and dreaded adverse effects of the surgery. Multiple studies confirm the potential benefit of various drug classes to accelerate the return of erectile function (EF) after RP. There is pre-clinical evidence supporting the use of angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) for this purpose, although this has not been studied in humans. The present study shows that there may be a benefit in the recovery of EF post-RRP in patients taking a daily dose of irbesartan, an ARB, following RRP. In addition, the use of irbesartan may curb the loss of stretched penile length which occurs postoperatively. Further study in the form of prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are necessary to confirm these findings.  Objective:   • To evaluate retrospectively the potential benefit of administering irbesartan, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, to improve erectile function (EF) recovery after nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP).  Patients and methods:   • Before surgery potent patients who underwent nerve-sparing RRP between April and December 2009 elected to start daily oral irbesartan 300 mg on postoperative day 1 (n= 17). A contemporaneously clinically matched cohort consisting of patients who declined irbesartan use served as the control group (n= 12). • Postoperative 'on demand' use of erectile aids (phosphodiesterase type 5 [PDE5] inhibitors and intracavernous injections) was adopted. • Potency was monitored by the administration of International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) questionnaires before surgery and at early (3 months) and long-term (12 and 24 months) postoperative intervals. • Stretched penile length (SPL) was measured both immediately and 3 months after surgery.  Results:   • EF status was no different between groups at baseline (P > 0.05). • While the IIEF-5 scores at 24 months after surgery were statistically similar between the two groups (control = 15.2 ± 2.0, irbesartan = 14.1 ± 3.1, P = 0.77), at 12 months the IIEF-5 scores of the irbesartan group were significantly higher than those of the control group (14 ± 2.6 vs. 7.2 ± 1.6, P < 0.05). • The proportional loss of SPL after RRP was less in the irbesartan than in the control group at 3 months (-0.9 ± 1.5% vs -5.6 ± 1.5, P < 0.05).  Conclusion:   • Regular irbesartan use after nerve-sparing RRP in patients with normal preoperative erectile function could improve EF recovery after surgery and mitigate early loss of SPL.""","""['Robert L Segal', 'Trinity J Bivalacqua', 'Arthur L Burnett']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Effects of tadalafil treatment on erectile function recovery following bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a randomised placebo-controlled study (REACTT).', 'Comparison of efficacy and satisfaction profile, between penile prosthesis implantation and oral PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil therapy, in men with nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction.', 'Nightly vs on-demand sildenafil for penile rehabilitation after minimally invasive nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: results of a randomized double-blind trial with placebo.', 'Efficacy and safety of short- and long-term, regular and on-demand regimens of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in treating erectile dysfunction after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Erectile function recovery in men treated with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor administration after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a systematic review of placebo-controlled randomized trials with trial sequential analysis.', 'Focusing on sexual rehabilitation besides penile rehabilitation following radical prostatectomy is important.', 'Erection rehabilitation following prostatectomy--current strategies and future directions.', 'The Different Therapeutic Choices with ARBs.

We investigated the accuracy of pre-operative findings in defining insignificant disease and distinguishing between unilateral/unifocal and bilateral/multifocal PCa. One-hundred and sixty patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were included. Histology reports from the biopsies and matching prostatectomies were compared. Three definitions of insignificant cancer were used: InsigE: tumour volume ≤0.5 mL; InsigW: tumour volume ≤1.3 mL; InsigM: tumour ≤5% of total prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤10 ng/mL. In all definitions, Gleason score (GS) was ≤6 and the tumour was organ confined.

Inclusion of other clinical and biochemical parameters did not significantly increase the predictive value. However, the combination of GS ≤ 6, PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL and unifocal or unilateral cancer in biopsy cores resulted in a positive predictive value of 61.1%, 38.9% and 12.0%, respectively, for identifying InsigM, InsigW and InsigE in the prostate specimen. Conclusively, routine prostate biopsies cannot predict unifocal and unilateral PCa, and must be regarded insufficient to select patients for focal therapy.

Clinical studies have shown that the AGR2 protein is overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers, including carcinomas of the esophagus, pancreas, breast, prostate, and lung, making the protein as a potential cancer biomarker. However, the general biochemical functions of AGR2 in human cells remain undefined, and the signaling mechanisms that drive AGR2 to inhibit p53 are still not clearly illustrated. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop molecular probes specifically recognizing AGR2 for its detection and for the elucidation of AGR2-associated molecular mechanism.  Methodology/principal findings:   Through a bead-based and flow cytometry monitored SELEX technology, we have identified a group of DNA aptamers that can specifically bind to AGR2 with K(d) values in the nanomolar range after 14 rounds of selections. Aptamer C14B was chosen to further study, due to its high binding affinity and specificity. The optimized and shortened C14B1 has special G-rich characteristics, and the G-rich region of this binding motif was further characterized to reveal an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex by CD spectroscopy and UV spectroscopy. Our experiments confirmed that the stability of the G-quadruplex structure was strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ions and the formation of G-quadruplex structure was also important for the binding capacity of C14B1 to the target. Furthermore, we have designed a kind of allosteric molecule beacon (aMB) probe for selective and sensitive detection of AGR2.  Conclusion/significance:   In this work, we have developed new aptamer probes for specific recognition of the AGR2. Structural study have identified that the binding motif of aptamer is an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structure and its structure and binding affinity are strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ion. Furthermore, with our design of AGR2-aMB, AGR2 could be sensitively and selectively detected. This aptamer probe has great potential to serve as a useful tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and for fundamental research to elucidate the biochemical functions of AGR2.""","""['Jie Wu', 'Chi Wang', 'Xilan Li', 'Yanling Song', 'Wei Wang', 'Cong Li', 'Jia Hu', 'Zhi Zhu', 'Jiuxing Li', 'Weiyun Zhang', 'Zhongxian Lu', 'Chaoyong James Yang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Use of cell-SELEX to generate DNA aptamers as molecular probes of HPV-associated cervical cancer cells.', 'An improved SELEX technique for selection of DNA aptamers binding to M-type 11 of Streptococcus pyogenes.', 'A G-quadruplex aptamer inhibits the phosphatase activity of oncogenic protein Shp2 in vitro.', 'G-quadruplex-based aptamers against protein targets in therapy and diagnostics.', 'Development of RNA G-quadruplex (rG4)-targeting L-RNA aptamers by rG4-SELEX.', 'Aptamer-based rapid diagnosis for point-of-care application.', 'Advances in Aptamers-Based Applications in Breast Cancer: Drug Delivery, Therapeutics, and Diagnostics.', 'Aptasensors versus immunosensors-Which will prevail?', 'Porous Silicon-Based Aptasensors: Toward Cancer Protein Biomarker Detection.', 'Morlet Wavelet Filtering and Phase Analysis to Reduce the Limit of Detection for Thin Film Optical Biosensors.']"""

Therefore, it is puzzling why FOXO protein expression is downregulated in cancer cells. MicroRNAs, non-coding 20~22 nucleotide single-stranded RNAs, result in translational repression or degradation and gene silencing of their target genes, and significantly contribute to the regulation of gene expression. In the current study, we report that miR-370 expression was significantly upregulated in five prostate cancer cell lines, compared to normal prostatic epithelial (PrEC) cells. Ectopic expression of miR-370 induced proliferation and increased the anchorage-independent growth and colony formation ability of DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, while inhibition of miR-370 reduced proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and colony formation ability. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-370 promoted the entry of DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells into the G1/S cell cycle transition, which was associated with downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1), and upregulation of the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1 mRNA. Additionally, we demonstrated that miR-370 can downregulate expression of FOXO1 by directly targeting the FOXO1 3'-untranslated region.

Efforts to identify novel prostate specific tumor antigens will facilitate the development of effective cancer vaccines against prostate cancer. Prostate-specific G-protein coupled receptor (PSGR) is a novel antigen that has been shown to be specifically over-expressed in human prostate cancer tissues. In this study, we describe the identification of PSGR-derived peptide epitopes recognized by CD8(+) T cells in an HLA-A2 dependent manner.  Methodology/principal findings:   Twenty-one PSGR-derived peptides were predicted by an immuno-informatics approach based on the HLA-A2 binding motif. These peptides were examined for their ability to induce peptide-specific T cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from either HLA-A2(+) healthy donors or HLA-A2(+) prostate cancer patients. The recognition of HLA-A2 positive and PSGR expressing LNCaP cells was also tested. Among the 21 PSGR-derived peptides, three peptides, PSGR3, PSGR4 and PSGR14 frequently induced peptide-specific T cell responses in PBMCs from both healthy donors and prostate cancer patients. Importantly, these peptide-specific T cells recognized and killed LNCaP prostate cancer cells in an HLA class I-restricted manner.

In this test, voided urine is centrifuged to pellet cells and the purified RNA is amplified for hybridization to preselected probesets. Amplification of test cell line RNA appeared not to introduce significant bias, and the counts matched well with gene abundance levels as measured by DNA microarrays. For data analysis, the individual counts were compared to that of β2 microglobulin, a housekeeping gene. Urine samples of 5 pre-operative cases and 2 non-cancer were analyzed. Pathology information was then retrieved. Signals for a majority of the genes were low for non-cancer and low Gleason scores, and 6/6 known prostate cancer markers were positive in the cases. One case of Gleason 4+5 showed, in contrast, strong signals for all cancer-associated markers, including CD24. One non-cancer also showed signals for all 6 cancer markers, and this man might harbor an undiagnosed cancer.

We developed an objective Cluster-Correlation (CC) analysis to identify gene expression changes in various cell types that are associated with progression. In the Cluster step, samples were clustered (unsupervised) based on the expression values of each gene through a mixture model combined with a multiple linear regression model in which cell-type percent data were used for decomposition. In the Correlation step, a Chi-square test was used to select potential prognostic genes. With CC analysis, we identified 324 significantly expressed genes (68 tumor and 256 stroma cell expressed genes) which were strongly associated with the observed biochemical relapse status. Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) was then utilized to develop a seven-gene classifier. The Classifier has been validated using two independent Data Sets. The overall prediction accuracy and sensitivity is 71% and 76%, respectively. The inclusion of the Gleason sum to the seven-gene classifier raised the prediction accuracy and sensitivity to 83% and 76% respectively based on independent testing. These results indicated that our prognostic model that includes cell type adjustments and using Gleason score and the seven-gene signature has some utility for predicting outcomes for prostate cancer for individual patients at the time of prognosis.

Although prostate specific antigen (PSA) has high sensitivity (90%) at a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL, its low specificity leads to many false positive results and considerable overtreatment of patients and its performance at lower ranges is poor. Given the histopathological and molecular heterogeneity of prostate cancer, we propose that a panel of markers will be a better tool than a single marker. We tested a panel of markers composed of the anti-apoptotic protein FLIP and its transcriptional regulators Sp1 and Sp3 using prostate tissues from 64 patients with recurrent and non-recurrent cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy as primary treatment for prostate cancer and were followed with PSA measurements for at least 5 years. Immunohistochemical staining for Sp1, Sp3, and FLIP was performed on these tissues and scored based on the proportion and intensity of staining. The predictive value of the FLIP/Sp1/Sp3 signature for clinical outcome (recurrence vs. non-recurrence) was explored with logistic regression, and combinations of FLIP/Sp1/Sp3 and Gleason score were analyzed with a stepwise (backward and forward) logistic model. The discrimination of the markers was identified by sensitivity-specificity analysis and the diagnostic value of FLIP/Sp1/Sp3 was determined using area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operator characteristic curves. The AUCs for FLIP, Sp1, Sp3, and Gleason score for predicting PSA failure and non-failure were 0.71, 0.66, 0.68, and 0.76, respectively. However, this increased to 0.93 when combined.

The association between XPD gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility of prostate cancer (PCa) was inconsistent in previous studies.  Methodology/principal findings:   A meta-analysis based on 9 independent case-control studies involving 3165 PCa patients and 3539 healthy controls for XPD Gln751Lys SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and 2555 cases and 3182 controls for Asn312Asp SNP was performed to address this association. Meanwhile, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate this relationship. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA10.0. No significant association was found between XPD Gln751Lys SNP and PCa risk. On the other hand, in subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, associations were observed in Asian (eg. Asn vs. Asp: OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.16-1.55; Asn/Asn+Asn/Asp vs. Asp/Asp: OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 1.07-1.42) and African (eg.

Moreover, similar associations were detected in hospital-based controls studies; the frequency of Asn/Asn genotype in early stage of PCa men was poorly higher than those in advanced stage of PCa men (OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.00-2.11).  Conclusion/significance:   Our investigations demonstrate that XPD Asn312Asp SNP not the Gln751Lys SNP, might poorly increase PCa risk in Asians and Africans, moreover, this SNPs may associate with the tumor stage of PCa.

The latter form of cancer often metastasizes to bone, and we wanted to investigate whether the loss of ERβ1 and/or the expression of ERβ2 affect such signaling pathways in prostate cancer. Using PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines that stably express ERβ1 or ERβ2, we found that the ERβ variants differentially regulate genes known to affect tumor behavior. We found that ERβ1 repressed the expression of the bone metastasis regulator Runx2 in PC3 cells. By contrast, RUNX2 expression was up-regulated at the mRNA level by ERβ2 in PC3 cells, whereas Slug was up-regulated by ERβ2 in both PC3 and 22Rv1 cells. In addition, the expression of Twist1, a factor whose expression strongly correlates with high Gleason grade prostate carcinoma, was increased by ERβ2. In agreement with the increased Twist1 expression, we found increased expression of Dickkopf homolog 1; Dickkopf homolog 1 is a factor that has been shown to increase the RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin ratio and enhance osteoclastogenesis, indicating that the expression of ERβ2 can cause osteolytic cancer. Furthermore, we found that only ERβ1 inhibited proliferation, whereas ERβ2 increased proliferation. The expression of the proliferation markers Cyclin E, c-Myc, and p45(Skp2) was differentially affected by ERβ1 and ERβ2 expression. In addition, nuclear β-catenin protein and its mRNA levels were reduced by ERβ1 expression. In conclusion, we found that ERβ1 inhibited proliferation and factors known to be involved in bone metastasis, whereas ERβ2 increased proliferation and up-regulated factors involved in bone metastasis.

To explore whether ERG-induced EMT in PrECs was associated with therapeutically targetable transformation characteristics, we established stable populations of BPH-1, PNT1B and RWPE-1 immortalized human PrEC lines that constitutively express flag-tagged ERG3 (fERG). All fERG-expressing populations exhibited characteristics of in vitro and in vivo transformation. Microarray analysis revealed >2000 commonly dysregulated genes in the fERG-PrEC lines. Functional analysis revealed evidence that fERG cells underwent EMT and acquired invasive characteristics. The fERG-induced EMT transcript signature was exemplified by suppressed expression of E-cadherin and keratins 5, 8, 14 and 18; elevated expression of N-cadherin, N-cadherin 2 and vimentin, and of the EMT transcriptional regulators Snail, Zeb1 and Zeb2, and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF-1). In BPH-1 and RWPE-1-fERG cells, fERG expression is correlated with increased expression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and its downstream effectors Snail and LEF-1. Interfering RNA suppression of ERG decreased expression of ILK, Snail and LEF-1, whereas small interfering RNA suppression of ILK did not alter fERG expression. Interfering RNA suppression of ERG or ILK impaired fERG-PrEC Matrigel invasion. Treating fERG-BPH-1 cells with the small molecule ILK inhibitor, QLT-0267, resulted in dose-dependent suppression of Snail and LEF-1 expression, Matrigel invasion and reversion of anchorage-independent growth.

Oesophageal cancer patients often suffer from multi-origin tumours, and therefore, it is important to improve our understanding of the complex biology, which underpins microenvironmental interactions in this disease. Extensive evidence indicates that the interaction of tumours with their microenvironment may play a crucial role in tumour initiation and progression. In this study, we analysed DNA damage response (DDR), immune cell invasion and cancer progression in 47 patients with oesophageal cancer from three different regions (tumour tissue, tumour-proximal non-malignant tissue and distant non-malignant tissue). Accumulated DDR (positive staining for γH2AX and phospho-ATM) was evident within tumour tissue and significantly increased in non-malignant tissue surrounding the tumour cells although activation of p53 by phosphorylation at serine 15 was observed only in tumour tissue. The level of DDR detected in cancer microenvironment depended largely on the distance from the tumour, as stronger DDR was observed in tumour-proximal areas compared with that in tumour-distant tissue. Induction of DDR in non-malignant tissues correlated with increased invasion of lymphocytes and macrophages and with precancerous progression. Our results support that DDR is induced in oesophageal cancer surrounding non-malignant epithelial cells, via activation of an inflammatory process, which in turn contributes to the progression of precancerous lesions. These findings provide novel pathological evidence for inflammation and DDR in influencing non-metastatic progression of cancer in its microenvironment.""","""['Haiyan He', 'Dongping Tian', 'Jian Guo', 'Min Liu', 'Zhihui Chen', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Thomas Helleday', 'Min Su', 'Songmin Ying']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Correlation between cathepsin D expression and p53 protein nuclear accumulation in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Oesophageal Stem Cells and Cancer.', 'Prognostic features of the tumour microenvironment in oesophageal adenocarcinoma.', 'Association of tumour-associated macrophages with cancer cell EMT, invasion, and metastasis of Kazakh oesophageal squamous cell cancer.', 'The matrix environmental and cell mechanical properties regulate cell migration and contribute to the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.', 'Esophageal Squamous Cancer from 4NQO-Induced Mice Model: CNV Alterations.', 'DNA-Liposome Hybrid Carriers for Triggered Cargo Release.', 'Moderately differentiated esophageal squamous cell carcinoma has a poor prognosis after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.', ""Towards screening Barrett's oesophagus: current guidelines, imaging modalities and future developments."", 'Inflammation-induced DNA damage, mutations and cancer.']"""

Inflammatory cytokines such as CXCL1/GROα exert cancer-promoting activities by increasing tumor angiogenesis. However, whether CXCL1/GROα also plays a role in the progression of prostate cancer, particularly in highly invasive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), has not been investigated. We explored whether CXCL1/GROα enhances cell migration and invasion in PC-3 and DU145 CRPC. Induction of PC-3 and DU145 cancer progression by CXCL1/GROα is associated with increased AKT activation and IκB kinase α (IKKα) phosphorylation, resulting in nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activation. Activated NF-κB interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to form a gene-silencing complex, which represses the expression of fibulin-1D by decreasing the acetylation of histone H3 and H4 on the NF-κB-binding site of the fibulin-1D promoter. Blockade of AKT2 by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreases IKKα phosphorylation, NF-κB nuclear translocation and cell migration, indicating that AKT is required in CXCL1/GROα-mediated NF-κB activation and cell migration. In addition, NF-κB and HDAC1 shRNA decrease the effect of CXCL1/GROα on fibulin-1D downregulation, migration and invasion, suggesting that the NF-κB/HDAC1 complex is also involved in CXCL1/GROα-mediated cancer progression.

Relocalization of PTK6 in prostate cancers contributes to increased growth. Although not expressed in normal breast or ovary, PTK6 promotes anchorage-independent survival of breast and ovarian tumor cells. We identified several potential PTK6 substrates in the human SW620 colon cancer cell line using mass spectrometry, including FAK (focal adhesion kinase). We show that FAK is a direct substrate of PTK6 in vitro and in vivo. Expression of membrane-targeted active PTK6 (Palm-PTK6-YF) induces constitutive activation of FAK and cell morphology changes, which are independent of SRC family kinases in Src-/-, Yes-/-, Fyn-/- (SYF) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Palm-PTK6-YF expressing SYF cells are transformed and overcome contact inhibition, form colonies in transformation assays, proliferate in suspension and form tumors in a xenograft model. Expression of FAK and Palm-PTK6-YF in Fak-/- MEFs synergistically activates AKT and protects cells against anoikis. However, expression of Palm-PTK6-YF in Akt1/2-/- MEFs fails to protect cells from anoikis, indicating AKT is critical in PTK6 and FAK-mediated survival signaling. In a conditional Pten knockout murine prostate cancer model, we identify prostate epithelial cells with enhanced activation of endogenous PTK6 and FAK at the plasma membrane. Knockdown of PTK6 in the PC3 human prostate cancer cell line disrupts FAK and AKT activation and promotes anoikis, which can be rescued by exogenous expression of FAK.

According to the 'injury and regeneration' model for prostate carcinogenesis, injury caused by pathogens or pro-inflammatory cytotoxic agents would trigger proliferation of prostatic glandular cells, leading to the appearance of epithelial lesions named 'Proliferative Inflammatory Atrophy' (PIA). Inflammatory cells infiltrating the prostate would release genotoxic reactive oxygen species, leading atrophic cells to neoplastic progression. The hypothesis pointing to PIA as risk-lesion for prostate cancer has been extensively investigated at the cellular and molecular levels, but few morphological data are available linking PIA or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to inflammation or clinical prostatitis. We investigated at the morphological level 1367 prostate biopsies from 98 patients with a recent history of chronic prostatitis, and 32 patients with biopsies positive for carcinoma. Our results show that i) PIA is found more frequently in biopsy cores containing a severe or moderate inflammatory focus, compared to NON-PIA lesions (partial or cystic atrophy); ii) the PIA lesion post-atrophic hyperplasia is more frequently found in tissues showing mild or no inflammation; iii) the extent of PIA per patient correlates with the burden of moderate or severe inflammation, whereas NON-PIA lesions do not; iv) low-grade PIN is in over 90% of cases emerging from normal, non-atrophic glands and is more frequently found in biopsy cores with absent or mild inflammatory burden; v) the inverse relationship between the prevalence of low-grade PIN and the extent of PIA lesions per patient is described by a power law function, suggesting the low likelihood of the concomitant presence of these lesions in the same tissue; vi) NON-PIA lesions correlate inversely with neoplasia in patients with prostate cancer; vii) the total scores of the NIH-CPSI questionnaire correlate with both PIA and inflammation burdens at diagnosis of prostatitis but not after pharmacological intervention. These results point to a positive association between tissue inflammation, clinical prostatitis and the putative cancer risk-lesion PIA, but do not support a model whereby low-grade PIN would arise from PIA.""","""['A Vral', 'V Magri', 'E Montanari', 'G Gazzano', 'V Gourvas', 'E Marras', 'G Perletti']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Morphological transition of proliferative inflammatory atrophy to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer in human prostate.', 'Morphologic transitions between proliferative inflammatory atrophy and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Inflammatory atrophy on prostate needle biopsies: is there topographic relationship to cancer?', 'Preneoplastic prostate lesions: an opportunity for prostate cancer prevention.', 'Proliferative inflammatory atrophy: a background lesion of prostate cancer?', 'Inflammation and Prostate Cancer: Pathological Analysis from Pros-IT CNR 2.', 'Macrophages expedite cell proliferation of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia through their downstream target ERK.', 'Application of Anti-Inflammatory Agents in Prostate Cancer.', 'Advances in research on the interaction between inflammation and cancer.', 'Association between oral pathogens and prostate cancer: building the relationship.']"""

Several factors have been known to play role in transcriptional modification of genes. Among these DNA sequence variations present in the regulatory region and aberrant methylation of CpG Iceland in promoter region are the most important factors modifying transcriptional regulation of genes. DNA sequence variation interferes with assembling of regulatory protein TF (transcription factor) on the cis elements TFBS (transcription factor binding site). Presence of variations in regulatory region may alter the level of gene product via interaction of TF to TFBS (transcriptional modification). Promoter hypermethylation causes gene silencing and responsible for transcriptional dysregulation of gene. JAK-1, STAT-3, IL-6, MAPK and AR genes participate in signaling pathway and are tightly regulated. Overexpression of IL-6 and activated STAT3 may contribute to the development of prostate cancer and possibly other human cancers. Indeed, constitutively activated STAT3 have been found in a growing number of human tumors. In the present work, we have predicted 34 regulatory polymorphisms that lies in TFBS of 5 (JAK-1, STAT-3, IL-6, MAPK and AR) signaling genes and compare the methylation of CpG Iceland in promoter region of above motioned genes. On the basis of these predictions, it has been hypothesized that transcriptional modification of gene resulting from the DNA sequence variations in regulatory region or promoter hypermethylation increases the susceptibility to diseases such as cancer by alteration in the level of signaling genes product.

For prostate cancer, one of the most common cancers in men, levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) lack specificity and sensitivity for the determination of malignancy when they fall within a range of values termed the 'grey zone'.  Objective:   To examine the predictive value of sialic acid in prostate neoplasms.  Study design:   In our study of diagnostic accuracy we recruited 70 men complaining of urinary symptoms who presented in the urology department as outpatients or inpatients. All patients were checked with biopsy and pathology in order to relate benign and malignant lesions of the prostate to levels of sialic acid, a member of a family of acetylated products of neuraminic acid, which has so far proved to be a very sensitive and accurate marker of malignancy.  Results:   The sialic acid level was found to be elevated in patients with prostate cancer (mean 75.06±10.4 mg/dl) and reduced in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (mean 57.086±8.7 mg/dl) (p<0.01); it had a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 84% in diagnosing malignancy.

We aim to study the association of the residence in high temperature geothermal area with the risk of cancer.  Methods:   This is an observational cohort study where the population of a high-temperature geothermal area (35,707 person years) was compared with the population of a cold, non-geothermal area (571,509 person years). The cohort originates from the 1981 National Census. The follow up from 1981 to 2010 was based on record linkage by personal identifier with nation-wide death and cancer registries. Through the registries it was possible to ascertain emigration and vital status and to identify the cancer cases, 95% of which had histological verification. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated in Cox-model, adjusted for age, gender, education and housing.  Results:   Adjusted HR in the high-temperature geothermal area for all cancers was 1.22 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.42) as compared with the cold area. The HR for pancreatic cancer was 2.85 (95% CI 1.39 to 5.86), breast cancer 1.59 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.31), lymphoid and hematopoietic cancer 1.64 (95% CI 1.00 to 2.66), and non-Hodgkins lymphoma 3.25 (95% CI 1.73 to 6.07). The HR for basal cell carcinoma of the skin was 1.61 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.35). The HRs were increased for cancers of the nasal cavities, larynx, lung, prostate, thyroid gland and for soft tissue sarcoma; however the 95% CIs included unity.  Conclusions:   More precise information on chemical and physical exposures are needed to draw firm conclusions from the findings. The significant excess risk of breast cancer, and basal cell carcinoma of the skin, and the suggested excess risk of other radiation-sensitive cancers, calls for measurement of the content of the gas emissions and the hot water, which have been of concern in previous studies in volcanic areas. There are indications of an exposure-response relationship, as the risk was higher in comparison with the cold than with the warm reference area. Social status has been taken into account and data on reproductive factors and smoking habits show that these do not seem to explain the increased risk of cancers, however unknown confounding can not be excluded.""","""['Adalbjorg Kristbjornsdottir', 'Vilhjalmur Rafnsson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Environ Health""","""['Association of Cancer Incidence and Duration of Residence in Geothermal Heating Area in Iceland: An Extended Follow-Up.', 'Cancer incidence among population utilizing geothermal hot water: a census-based cohort study.', 'Cancer mortality and other causes of death in users of geothermal hot water.', 'The health of communities living in proximity of geothermal plants generating heat and electricity: A review.', 'Work-related cancer in the Nordic countries.', 'Low level exposure to hydrogen sulfide: a review of emissions, community exposure, health effects, and exposure guidelines.', 'Cancer Incidence in Volcanic Areas: A Systematic Review.', 'Residential radon exposure and cancer.', 'Health impact of natural gas emission at Cava dei Selci residential zone (metropolitan city of Rome, Italy).', 'Environmental/Occupational Exposure to Radon and Non-Pulmonary Neoplasm Risk: A Review of Epidemiologic Evidence.']"""

Therefore, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism of treatment failure of HDACIs in the present study. We found that HDACIs Trichostatin A (TSA) and Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) could induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, which was associated with changes in cellular morphology consistent with increased expression of transcription factors ZEB1, ZEB2 and Slug, and mesenchymal markers such as vimentin, N-cadherin and Fibronectin. CHIP assay showed acetylation of histone 3 on proximal promoters of selected genes, which was in part responsible for increased expression of EMT markers. Moreover, TSA treatment led to further increase in the expression of Sox2 and Nanog in PCa cells with EMT phenotype, which was associated with cancer stem-like cell (CSLC) characteristics consistent with increased cell motility. Our results suggest that HDACIs alone would lead to tumor aggressiveness, and thus strategies for reverting EMT-phenotype to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) phenotype or the reversal of CSLC characteristics prior to the use of HDACIs would be beneficial to realize the value of HDACIs for the treatment of solid tumors especially PCa.""","""['Dejuan Kong', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Bin Bao', 'Yiwei Li', 'Sanjeev Banerjee', 'Fazlul H Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by protein lysine acetylation.', 'Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer SW480 and prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition by upregulating Slug in lung cancer cells.', 'Trichostatin A promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell migration and EMT through BRD4/ERK1/2-dependent pathway.', 'Research advance on mechanism and application of HATs and HDACs in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of lung cancer.', 'HDAC inhibitors with potential to overcome drug resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by protein lysine acetylation.', 'Targeting histone deacetylase-3 blocked epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity and metastatic dissemination in gastric cancer.', 'Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide Augmented Malignant Transformation and Promoted the Stemness in Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.', 'Targeting the Metabolic Adaptation of Metastatic Cancer.']"""

We investigated the effects of activin, a factor involved in the regulation of PC growth and steroidogenic enzyme expression in other steroidogenic tissues, on intratumoral steroidogenesis in PC. Activin A effects and regulation of the activin-signaling pathway molecules were studied in the PC cell lines LNCaP, VCaP, and PC-3 and in 13 individual PC xenograft models. Also, expression levels of inhibin βA- and βB-subunits (INHBA and INHBB) and of the activin antagonist follistatin were quantitated in patient PC tissues. Activin A induced the expression and enzyme activity of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme AKR1C3 in LNCaP and VCaP cells. Inhibition of endogenous activin A action in the PC-3 cell line decreased AKR1C3 levels and consequently testosterone synthesis. In return, androgens suppressed INHBA expression in both VCaP cells and the PC xenograft models. The antiproliferative effects of activin A were opposed by physiological concentrations of androstenedione in LNCaP cells. In patient PC tissues, expression levels of INHBA were increased in CRPC samples and correlated with AKR1C3 levels. Moreover, a high ratio of activin subunits to follistatin was associated with a worse metastasis-free survival in patients. In conclusion, activin A is controlled by androgens in PC models and regulates local androgen production.

This could potentially be overcome by selective blockade of single HDAC family members. Here we report that HDAC11, the most recently identified zinc-dependent HDAC, is overexpressed in several carcinomas as compared to corresponding healthy tissues. HDAC11 depletion is sufficient to cause cell death and to inhibit metabolic activity in HCT-116 colon, PC-3 prostate, MCF-7 breast and SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cell lines. The antitumoral effect induced can be mimicked by enforced expression of a catalytically impaired HDAC11 variant, suggesting that inhibition of the enzymatic activity of HDAC11 by small molecules could trigger the desired phenotypic changes.

The mechanisms involved in TIMP3 transcriptional repression are not fully understood, but evidence suggests that promoter hypermethylation may not be the predominant epigenetic alteration in prostate cancer. To clarify this issue, we examined the contribution of both CpG site promoter methylation and histone modifications on TIMP3 downregulation. Using publicly available data sets, we confirmed that TIMP3 mRNA expression is decreased in prostate tumors relative to normal glands. Immunohistochemical analysis also showed decreased TIMP3 levels in high-grade primary tumors, but promoter hypermethylation was only detected in 6 of 28 (21%) high-grade specimens. Similarly, in prostate cancer cells, TIMP3 hypermethylation was only observed in DU145 cells. Treatment of DU145 cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) restored TIMP3 expression, and this was significantly amplified by co-treating the cells with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Alternatively, in cells that did not exhibit aberrant TIMP3 methylation (LNCaP and PC3), TIMP3 expression could be upregulated by the combination of histone methylation inhibitor 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) and TSA. This reversal of transcriptional repression was associated with decreased H3K27me3 and increased H3K9ac histone marks at the TIMP3 promoter, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Collectively, these results indicate that histone modifications can contribute to TIMP3 repression in the absence of promoter hypermethylation, and suggest that the combination of histone modifying agents could restore TIMP3 expression in prostate tumors harboring aberrant histone modifications at the TIMP3 promoter.""","""['Toshiaki Shinojima', 'Qiang Yu', 'Sharon K Huang', 'Michelle Li', 'Ryuichi Mizuno', 'Edison T Liu', 'Dave S B Hoon', 'Laurent Lessard']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['Epigenetic regulation of MDR1 gene through post-translational histone modifications in prostate cancer.', 'Promoter- and cell-specific epigenetic regulation of CD44, Cyclin D2, GLIPR1 and PTEN by methyl-CpG binding proteins and histone modifications.', 'Global and region-specific post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications of bisphenol A in human prostate cancer cells.', 'The promise and failures of epigenetic therapies for cancer treatment.', 'Epigenetic changes in colorectal cancer.', 'Impact of Clinicopathological Characteristics and Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3 Polymorphism Rs9619311 on Biochemical Recurrence in Taiwanese Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'The Role of the Metzincin Superfamily in Prostate Cancer Progression: A Systematic-Like Review.', 'Further understanding of epigenetic dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium in AMD.', 'MAb NJ001 inhibits lung adenocarcinoma invasiveness by directly regulating TIMP-3 promoter activity via FOXP1 binding sites.']"""

Additional studies with the lead chemotype (chemotype A) showed enhanced AR protein degradation, which was dependent on helix 12 in the AR ligand binding domain. Significantly, chemotype A compounds functioned as AR antagonists in vivo in normal male mice and suppressed AR activity and tumor cell proliferation in human CRPC xenografts.

CRPC remains dependent on androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which may include constitutive, ligand-independent action of naturally occurring AR splice variants. For example, the AR splice variant AR3 (also termed AR-V7) is expressed in CRPC and is linked to poor prognosis. Vav3, a Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is an AR coactivator that is up-regulated in human prostate cancer compared with benign tissue and in preclinical models of CRPC. Vav3 confers castration-resistant growth to androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells. Despite the importance of AR coactivators in promoting CRPC, the potential role of these regulatory proteins in modulating AR splice variant activity is unknown. We examined the contributions of Vav3 to AR activity in two CRPC cell lines that naturally express relatively high levels of Vav3 and AR3. Vav3 or AR3 knockdown greatly attenuated cell proliferation, soft agar growth, and ligand-independent AR activity. Vav3 potently enhanced the transcriptional activity of AR3 and another clinically relevant AR splice variant, ARv567es. Vav3 knockdown resulted in lowered nuclear AR3 levels, whereas total AR3 levels remained similar. Conversely, overexpression of Vav3 resulted in increased nuclear AR3. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that AR3 and Vav3 interact. These novel data demonstrating physical and functional interactions between Vav3, a unique AR coactivator, and an AR splice variant provide insights into the mechanisms by which Vav3 exploits and enhances AR signaling in the progression to CRPC.""","""['Stephanie O Peacock', 'Cale D Fahrenholtz', 'Kerry L Burnstein']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Targeting AR Variant-Coactivator Interactions to Exploit Prostate Cancer Vulnerabilities.', 'A novel nuclear role for the Vav3 nucleotide exchange factor in androgen receptor coactivation in prostate cancer.', 'Ligand-independent activation of androgen receptors by Rho GTPase signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) aberrations in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of novel enzalutamide-resistant cells: upregulation of testis-specific Y-encoded protein gene promotes the expression of androgen receptor splicing variant 7.', 'Therapies Targeted to Androgen Receptor Signaling Axis in Prostate Cancer: Progress, Challenges, and Hope.', 'Arginine vasopressin receptor 1a is a therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Current strategies for targeting the activity of androgen receptor variants.', 'Down-regulation of AR splice variants through XPO1 suppression contributes to the inhibition of prostate cancer progression.']"""

On other hand, androgen receptor (AR) is crucial in development of both androgen-dependent and independent prostatic malignancies. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of KLF8 in prostate cancer (PCa) and the relationship between KLF8 and AR.  Methods:   Eight human PCa cell lines, including androgen-dependent LNCap cells and androgen-independent 22Rv1 cells, as well as human PCa samples were studied. LNCap cells and 22Rv1 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding full-length wild-type KLF8 or KLF8 shRNA. The expression of KLF8 protein was detected using Western blotting or immunohistochemical staining. Cell proliferation in vitro was measured with MTT assay, and in vivo in a xenograft nude mouse model. Yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation and pull down assays were used to examine the binding of KLF8 to AR. Luciferase reporter gene assay was used to measure the transcriptional activity of the genes targeted by AR.  Results:   In 133 human PCa samples, KLF8 protein staining was observed in 92.65% (63/68) of high-grade PCa, 66.15% (43/65) of low-grade PCa, and 6.82% (3/44) of adjacent normal tissues. The expression of KLF8 was significantly associated with poorer overall survival. Overexpression of KLF8 enhanced the proliferation of both LNCap and 22Rv1 cells, while knockdown of endogenous KLF8 suppressed the proliferation. These manipulations exerted similar effects on the tumor volumes in the xenograft nude mouse model. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that KLF8 was a novel AR-interacting protein. With pull down assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that KLF8 bound directly to AR, and KLF8 enhanced AR target gene transcription.  Conclusion:   The results demonstrate that KLF8 is a novel AR transcriptional co-activator that is overexpressed in PCa and may play a role in progression of hormone-refractory PCa.""","""['Hong-jiang He', 'Xue-feng Gu', 'Wan-hai Xu', 'De-jun Yang', 'Xiao-min Wang', 'Yu Su']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Pharmacol Sin""","""['Tumor suppressor PAX6 functions as androgen receptor co-repressor to inhibit prostate cancer growth.', 'SIRT7 depletion inhibits cell proliferation and androgen-induced autophagy by suppressing the AR signaling in prostate cancer.', 'The tumor suppressor ING1b is a novel corepressor for the androgen receptor and induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Stromal androgen receptor in prostate development and cancer.', 'Androgen receptor signaling and mutations in prostate cancer.', 'Analyzing the Androgen Receptor Interactome in Prostate Cancer: Implications for Therapeutic Intervention.', 'KLF9 suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis via the AR pathway in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells.', 'Characterization of the prognostic values and response to immunotherapy/chemotherapy of Krüppel-like factors in prostate cancer.', 'KLF16 Affects the MYC Signature and Tumor Growth in Prostate Cancer.', 'Transcription factor KLF13 inhibits AKT activation and suppresses the growth of prostate carcinoma cells.']"""

The symptoms in Parkinson's including fatigue are thought to be related to α-synuclein overexpression. This study investigated genomic correlates of fatigue experienced by men with prostate cancer receiving external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).  Patients and methods:   Sixteen men with non-metastatic prostate cancer who were scheduled to receive EBRT were enrolled. Fatigue scores and blood were obtained at baseline (prior to EBRT, D0); one hour following initiation of EBRT (D1), day 7 (D7), day 14 (D14), midpoint (days 19-21, D21), completion (days 38-42, D42), and four weeks post-EBRT (days 68-72, D72). Gene expression profiling using microarray analysis was performed from peripheral blood and confirmatory qPCR and protein (ELISA) analyses verified the microarray results. Correlations between fatigue and gene/protein expressions were determined using a mixed model approach.  Results:   Microarray data showed significant, differential expression of 463 probesets following EBRT. SNCA had a 2.95-fold change at D21 from baseline. SNCA expression was confirmed by qPCR (p<0.001) and ELISA (p<0.001) over time during EBRT. Fatigue scores were significantly correlated with SNCA gene expression on D14 (r=0.55, p<0.05) and plasma α-synuclein concentrations on D42 of EBRT (r=0.54, p=0.04).  Conclusion:   Fatigue experienced during EBRT may be mediated by α-synuclein overexpression. Alpha-synuclein may serve as a useful biomarker to understand the mechanisms and pathways related to the development of fatigue in this population.""","""['L N Saligan', 'C P Hsiao', 'D Wang', 'X M Wang', 'L St John', 'A Kaushal', 'D Citrin', 'J J Barb', 'P J Munson', 'R A Dionne']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Brain Behav Immun""","""['Genomic Profile of Fatigued Men Receiving Localized Radiation Therapy.', 'The association of IFI27 expression and fatigue intensification during localized radiation therapy: implication of a para-inflammatory bystander response.', 'Altered Cd8+ T lymphocyte Response Triggered by Arginase 1: Implication for Fatigue Intensification during Localized Radiation Therapy in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Gene Expression, and Fatigue in Puerto Rican Men during Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: an Exploratory Study.', 'Differential expression of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics in fatigued prostate cancer men receiving external beam radiation therapy.', 'Investigation into Chronic Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation Effect on Gene Expression Profile of Human HUVECs Cells.', 'FASN multi-omic characterization reveals metabolic heterogeneity in pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Exploring Biologic Correlates of Cancer-Related Fatigue in Men With Prostate Cancer: Cell Damage Pathways and Oxidative Stress.', 'Precision health: A nursing perspective.', 'Relationships between expression of BCS1L, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and fatigue among patients with prostate cancer.']"""

We investigate whether the number of cores taken affects the concordance rate between microfocus of prostate cancer and the confirmation of a pathologically insignificant prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Data were analyzed from 233 patients with a single microfocus of prostate cancer at initial transrectal prostate biopsy (a single focus of Gleason 6 involving 5% or less of the core) subsequently treated with radical prostatectomy. The chi-square test, cubic spline analyses and logistic regression analyses were used to depict the relationship between the number of cores taken and the probability of confirming the presence of an indolent disease (pathologically confirmed insignificant prostate cancer defined as radical prostatectomy Gleason score 6 or less, tumor volume 0.5 ml or less and organ confined disease).  Results:   Overall 65 patients (27.9%) showed pathologically confirmed insignificant prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.

We evaluated patient and surgery related risk factors to determine whether acute urinary retention could be prevented. To our knowledge this has not previously been investigated for prostatectomy done by any technique.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed a single surgeon, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy database of patients treated between February 2008 and June 2011 for acute urinary retention after catheter removal, which was routinely performed 3 to 7 days postoperatively. We compared the characteristics of patients with and without acute urinary retention.  Results:   Of 1,026 patients 25 (2.4%) experienced acute urinary retention. There was no difference between patients with and without acute urinary retention in mean age, body mass index, blood loss or prostate size, and no difference in the frequency of bladder neck reconstruction or nerve sparing. The catheter was removed an average of 4.1 vs 5.7 days postoperatively in patients with vs without acute urinary retention. Of 25 patients with acute urinary retention 22 (88%) underwent catheter removal on postoperative day 3 or 4. Although only 3 of 381 patients (0.8%) had a leak on cystogram on postoperative day 3 or 4, the acute urinary retention rate when the catheter was removed on day 3 or 4 was 5.8% (22 of 381). This was several times higher than the rate in patients who retained the catheter for greater than 4 days (3 of 645 or 0.5%).  Conclusions:   Acute urinary retention develops infrequently after robotic prostatectomy. No patient related risk factors were identified beyond catheterization time. Although the catheter may be removed after 3 or 4 days with rare leaks, the acute urinary retention risk was much less when the catheter was left in place at least 5 days.""","""['Tariq A Khemees', 'Ryan Novak', 'Ronney Abaza']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Impact of tamsulosin on urinary retention following early catheter removal after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a prospective randomized controlled trial.', 'Is a cystogram necessary after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy?', 'Safety and outcome of early catheter removal after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Early catheter removal 3 days after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Transurethral catheter removal after bilateral orchiectomy for prostatic carcinoma associated with acute urinary retention.', 'Incidence and impact of acute urinary retention after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Ideal timing of indwelling catheter removal after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with a running barbed suture technique: a prospective analysis of 425 consecutive patients.', 'The risk of urinary retention following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and its impact on early continence outcomes.', 'Selective indication for check cystogram before catheter removal following robot assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Technical considerations in robotic nephrectomy with vena caval tumor thrombectomy.']"""

Objective:   We assessed risk of TED among men undergoing different types of urologic surgery.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using the Prostate Cancer Database Sweden (PCBaSe) Sweden, we identified all men (n=45 065) undergoing pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), radical prostatectomy (RP) with or without PLND, orchiectomy due to PCa, or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). We identified a comparison cohort from the population.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Main outcomes were deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) as primary diagnoses in the National Patient Register or Cause of Death Register (2002-2010). We calculated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.  Results and limitations:   All surgical procedures were associated with increased risk of TED; laparoscopic and open RP with a PLND were the most strongly associated with TED (HR for PE: 8.1 [95% CI, 2.9-23.0] and 7.8 [95% CI, 4.9-13], respectively). For surgery including a PLND, the risk increased during the second half of the first postoperative month. The HR for PE after TURP in men with PCa was 3.0 (95% CI, 1.8-5.1). Patients with a history of TED had a strongly increased risk of TED (HR for DVT: 4.5; 95% CI, 2.6-8.0). A limitation is lack of information on TED prophylaxis, but its use was standardized during the study period for RP and PLND. Other limitations are lack of information on extent of PLND and lifestyle factors.  Conclusions:   Surgeries for PCa, including TURP, are associated with hospitalization for TED. Patients with a history of TED and patients undergoing a PLND were at highest risk. The largest risk was observed from days 14 to 28 postoperatively. Thus, our results suggest that prophylactic measures may be beneficial during the first 4 wk in these patients.""","""['Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'Hans Garmo', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Anna Bill-Axelson', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Olof Akre', 'Pär Stattin', 'Jan Adolfsson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Multiple events of fractures and cardiovascular and thromboembolic disease following prostate cancer diagnosis: results from the population-based PCBaSe Sweden.', 'Multi-institutional study of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in prostate cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Risk of thromboembolic disease in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Incidence of thromboembolism after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)--a study on TED stocking prophylaxis and literature review.', 'Risk of venous thromboembolism in men with prostate cancer compared with men in the general population: a nationwide population-based cohort study in Sweden.', 'Population-based study of long-term anticoagulation for treatment and secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in men with prostate cancer in Sweden.', 'Influence of steep Trendelenburg position on postoperative complications: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Impact of ABO Blood Type on Developing Venous Thromboembolism in Cancer Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Perioperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in prostate cancer surgery.']"""

Methods and materials:   A 2-stage genome-wide association study was performed. Patients were split randomly into a stage I discovery cohort (132 cases, 103 controls) and a stage II replication cohort (128 cases, 102 controls). The discovery cohort was genotyped using Affymetrix 6.0 genome-wide arrays. The 940 top ranking SNPs selected from the discovery cohort were genotyped in the replication cohort using Illumina iSelect custom SNP arrays.  Results:   Twelve SNPs identified in the discovery cohort and validated in the replication cohort were associated with development of ED following radiation therapy (Fisher combined P values 2.1×10(-5) to 6.2×10(-4)). Notably, these 12 SNPs lie in or near genes involved in erectile function or other normal cellular functions (adhesion and signaling) rather than DNA damage repair. In a multivariable model including nongenetic risk factors, the odds ratios for these SNPs ranged from 1.6 to 5.6 in the pooled cohort. There was a striking relationship between the cumulative number of SNP risk alleles an individual possessed and ED status (Sommers' D P value=1.7×10(-29)). A 1-allele increase in cumulative SNP score increased the odds for developing ED by a factor of 2.2 (P value=2.1×10(-19)). The cumulative SNP score model had a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 75% for prediction of developing ED at the radiation therapy planning stage.  Conclusions:   This genome-wide association study identified a set of SNPs that are associated with development of ED following radiation therapy.

Methods and materials:   Tracking data recorded by Calypso EM transponders was analyzed for postprostatectomy patients that underwent step-and-shoot IMRT. Rigid target motion parameters during beam delivery were calculated from recorded transponder positions in 16 patients with rigid transponder geometry. The delivered doses to the clinical target volume (CTV) were estimated from the planned dose matrix and the target motion for the first 3, 5, 10, and all fractions. Treatment adequacy was determined by comparing the delivered minimum dose (Dmin) with the planned Dmin to the CTV. Treatments were considered adequate if the delivered CTV Dmin is at least 95% of the planned CTV Dmin.  Results:   Translational target motion was minimal for all 16 patients (mean: 0.02 cm; range: -0.12 cm to 0.07 cm). Rotational motion was patient-specific, and maximum pitch, yaw, and roll were 12.2, 4.1, and 10.5°, respectively. We observed inadequate treatments in 5 patients. In these treatments, we observed greater target rotations along with large distances between the CTV centroid and transponder centroid. The treatment adequacy from the initial 10 fractions successfully predicted the overall adequacy in 4 of 5 inadequate treatments and 10 of 11 adequate treatments.  Conclusion:   Target rotational motion could cause underdosage to partial volume of the postprostatectomy targets.

Twelve- and 18-month survival results were reported previously. Here we report 24-month overall survival (OS) and safety data from the period 12 to 24 months after the first injection of study medication.  Methods:   Patients with CRPC and bone pain were randomized 1:1 to receive 4 injections of radium-223 (50 kBq/kg [n = 33]) or placebo (n = 31) after external-beam radiotherapy; each injection was given every 4 weeks. Endpoints for this report were 24-month OS, long-term safety, and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurring in the 12- to 24-month period.  Results:   After 24 months, 10 (30%) patients were alive in the radium-223 group compared with 4 patients (13%) in the placebo group. Patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication had a median OS of 65 weeks in the radium-223 group vs. 46 weeks in the placebo group (log-rank P = .056). The hazard ratio (HR) for OS, adjusted for baseline covariates, was 0.476 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.258-0.877; Cox regression P = .017). The most frequent cause of death for both arms was disease progression. There were no reports of treatment-related AEs or long-term hematologic toxicity during the 12- to 24-month follow-up.  Conclusion:   Radium-223 had a highly favorable safety profile, with no evidence of second malignancies at 24-month follow-up.

The Personal Patient Profile-Prostate (P3P) is a computerized decision aid for men with LPC that focuses on personal preferences. We determined whether the P3P intervention improved the concordance of treatment choice with self-reported influential side-effects compared with a control group.  Methods:   English/Spanish-speaking men diagnosed with LPC (2007-2009) from four US cities were enrolled into a randomized trial and followed through 6-months via mailed or online questionnaire. Men were randomized to receive the P3P intervention or standard education plus links to reputable websites. We classified choice as concordant if men were concerned with (a) sexual function and chose external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, (b) bowel function and chose prostatectomy, (c) sex, bowel, and/or bladder function and chose active surveillance, or (d) not concerned with any side effect and chose any treatment. Using logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between the P3P intervention and concordance.  Results:   Of 448 men, most were <65 years, non-Hispanic white, had multiple physician consultations prior to enrollment, and chose a treatment discordant with concerns about potential side effects. There was no significant difference in concordance between the intervention (45%) and control (50%) group (OR = 0.82; 95%CI = 0.56, 1.2).  Conclusions:   The P3P intervention did not improve concordance between potential side effects and treatment choice. Information and/or physician consultation immediately after diagnosis was likely to influence decisions despite concerns about side effects.

The use of biomarkers to detect a cancer early, especially prostate cancer, is not a new idea and PSA has been proved to be the best biomarker for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Since the introduction and wide use of PSA various efforts have been made to find novel biomarkers in both serum and urine of individuals at high risk for prostate cancer. The best example of a biomarker detected in the urine after a vigorous digital rectal examination is PCA3, which is used mainly in the subgroup of patients with PSA 4-10 ng/mL whose prostate biopsy was repeatedly negative for prostate cancer in order to decide the performance or not of a new biopsy. Proteomics is a state of the art new biotechnology used to identify the proteome of a certain tissue meaning the whole group of proteins related to the anatomy and biochemistry of the tissue. Using proteomics can effectively and more specifically identify proteins that can be used as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Zinc α2-glycoprotein has been studied in the past as a protein related to cancer cachexia and it has been measured in both prostate tissue and serum in patients with prostate cancer. Zinc α2-glycoprotein has also been recently identified by proteomics in prostate tissue showing different values in patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. It is the first time that zinc α2-glycoprotein has been systematically measured and studied in an easily obtained biological fluid such as urine showing a very optimistic potential both as a novel solo biomarker and as an adjunct to PSA for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. PSA has revolutionized the way we approximate prostate cancer diagnosis. Even though PSA is still the best biomarker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer it constitutes an organ-specific and not a disease-specific biomarker and diagnostic dilemmas are often raised concerning the performance or not of a prostate biopsy. Thus novel biomarkers are required in order to improve the diagnostic ability of PSA. Increasingly in the literature it is stated that the future of prostate cancer diagnosis could be not a single biomarker but a band of different biomarkers that as a total could give the possibility of an individual having prostate cancer. By detecting and measuring zinc α2-glycoprotein in the urine we believe that interesting conclusions can be made: first that proteomics is the way to detect with accuracy proteins that could be proved to be valuable novel biomarkers; second that zinc α2-glycoprotein detected in the urine could be used both as a solo biomarker and as an adjunct to PSA for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Objective:   • To examine the potential utility as a novel biomarker in the urine of zinc α2-glygoprotein (ZAG) for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   • The urine of 127 consecutive candidates for a transrectal ultrasound prostatic biopsy with a mean age of 65.7 ± 8.7 years and mean PSA 9.1 ± 5.3 ng/mL was collected. • Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry for ZAG were performed. • Receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression models were used to estimate the predictive ability of ZAG and to determine the optimal sensitivity and specificity by using various cut-off values for the prediction of prostate cancer.  Results:   • In all, 42 patients had prostate cancer, 29 showed high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 56 were negative. • Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a significant predictive ability of ZAG for prostate cancer. The area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of prostate cancer was 0.68 (95% CI 0.59-0.78). • The combination of ZAG with PSA showed a significant improvement in the predictive ability (P= 0.010), with AUC equal to 0.75 (95% CI 0.66-0.85). Separate analysis in patients with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/mL (70.1%) showed that ZAG had a discriminative power with AUC equal to 0.68. • The optimal cut-off was 1.13 for ZAG, which corresponded to 6.88 times greater odds for prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   • Urine detected ZAG showed promising results in the prediction of prostate cancer. • Further validation is required to establish ZAG as a novel biomarker.""","""['Ioannis Katafigiotis', 'Stavros I Tyritzis', 'Konstantinos G Stravodimos', 'Christos Alamanis', 'Kitty Pavlakis', 'Antonia Vlahou', 'Manousos Makridakis', 'Amalia Katafigioti', 'Spiros D Garbis', 'Constantinos A Constantinides']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['In the search of novel urine biomarkers for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.

However, the effects of radiation therapy on telomere DNA of non-cancer tissue have not been thoroughly investigated. This study analyzed the telomere length of inpatients with cancer treated with radiation therapy to see whether the telomere lengths change in response to therapeutic radiation.  Materials and methods:   Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study. The patients had lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatoma, or rectal cancer. They received radiation therapy with a dose range of 15-74 Gy. The telomere lengths and telomere length distribution in peripheral leukocytes were analyzed by using a Southern blot-based method.  Results:   The telomere length and the telomere length distribution of the peripheral leukocytes did not change after radiation therapy. However, there was a significant proportional decrease in the short telomere fraction (< 4.4 kb) per day and per Gy.  Conclusions:   This observation suggested that the telomere length distribution of peripheral leukocytes could be affected by radiation therapy, and that the effect of radiation tends to appear in cells with short telomeres.

The popularity of molecular recognition in chemical sensing has resulted from the progress made in mastering weak interactions, which has enabled the design of synthetic receptors according to the analyte to be detected. However, the availability of a large pool of modular synthetic receptors so far has not had a significant impact on sensors used in the real world. This technological gap has emerged because of the difficulties in transferring the intrinsic molecular recognition properties of a given receptor from solution to interfaces and in finding high fidelity transduction modes for the recognition event. This Account focuses on the ways to overcome these two bottlenecks, and we recount our recent efforts to produce highly selective supramolecular sensors using phosphonate cavitands as receptors. Through two examples, we present an overview of the different operating strategies that are implemented depending on whether the interface is vapor-solid or liquid-solid. First we describe the selective detection of short chain aliphatic alcohols in the vapor phase. In this example, we solved a key issue common to all sensors for organic vapors: the dissection of the specific interaction (between cavitand and the alcohol) from ubiquitous nonspecific dispersion interactions (between the analytes and interferents in the solid layer). We removed responses resulting from the nonspecific interactions of the analytes with interferents by directly connecting the recognition event at the interface to the transduction mechanism (photoinduced charge transfer). The second example addresses the specific detection of sarcosine in urine. Recent research has suggested that sarcosine can serve as reliable biomarker of the aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Tetraphosphonate cavitands can complex N-methyl ammonium salts with impressive selectivity in solution, and we used this property as a starting point. The sensor implementation requires that we first graft the cavitand onto silicon and gold surfaces as monolayers. The exclusive recognition of sarcosine by these supramolecular sensors originates from their operation in aqueous environments, where synergistic multiple interactions with the phosphonate cavitand are possible only for N-methyl ammonium derivatives. We couple that selectivity with detection modes that probe the strength of the complexation either directly (microcantilever) or via exchange with molecules that have comparable affinity for the cavity (fluorescence dye displacement).""","""['Roberta Pinalli', 'Enrico Dalcanale']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acc Chem Res""","""['Fluorinated Tetraphosphonate Cavitands.', 'Investigation of the origin of selectivity in cavitand-based supramolecular sensors.', 'Chemoselective recognition with phosphonate cavitands: the ephedrine over pseudoephedrine case.', 'Molecular recognition at the gas-solid interface: a powerful tool for chemical sensing.', 'Supramolecular chemistry and chemical warfare agents: from fundamentals of recognition to catalysis and sensing.', 'Recognition and optical sensing of amines by a quartz-bound 7-chloro-4-quinolylazopillar5arene monolayer.', 'Acyclic Cucurbitnuril-Type Receptors: Aromatic Wall Extension Enhances Binding Affinity, Delivers Helical Chirality, and Enables Fluorescence Sensing.', 'Velcrand Functionalized Polyethylene.', 'Fluorinated Tetraphosphonate Cavitands.', 'Nitro-sonium complexation by the tetra-phospho-nate cavitand 5,11,17,23-tetra-methyl-6,10:12,16:18,22:24,4-tetra-kis-(phenyl-phospho-nato-κ2O,O)resorcin(4)arene.']"""

When designing inhibitors of the proteolytic activity of serine proteases, obtaining sufficient specificity is problematic, because the topology of the proteases' active sites are highly similar. In an effort to generate highly specific uPA inhibitors with new inhibitory modalities, we isolated uPA-binding RNA aptamers by screening a library of 35 nucleotides long 2'-fluoro-pyrimidine RNA molecules using a version of human pro-uPA lacking the epidermal growth factor-like and kringle domains as bait. One pro-uPA-binding aptamer sequence, referred to as upanap-126, proved to be highly specific for human uPA. Upanap-126 delayed the proteolytic conversion of human pro-uPA to active uPA, but did not inhibit plasminogen activation catalyzed by two-chain uPA. The aptamer also inhibited the binding of pro-uPA to uPAR and the binding of vitronectin to the preformed pro-uPA/uPAR complex, both in cell-free systems and on cell surfaces. Furthermore, upanap-126 inhibited human tumor cell invasion in vitro in the Matrigel assay and in vivo in the chick embryo assay of cell escape from microtumors. Finally, upanap-126 significantly reduced the levels of tumor cell intravasation and dissemination in the chick embryo model of spontaneous metastasis. Together, our findings show that usage of upanap-126 represents a novel multifunctional mechanistic modality for inhibition of uPA-dependent processes involved in tumor cell spread.""","""['Kenneth A Botkjaer', 'Elena I Deryugina', 'Daniel M Dupont', 'Henrik Gårdsvoll', 'Erin M Bekes', 'Cathrine K Thuesen', 'Zhuo Chen', 'Michael Ploug', 'James P Quigley', 'Peter A Andreasen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Serum-stable RNA aptamers to urokinase-type plasminogen activator blocking receptor binding.', 'RNA interference-directed knockdown of urokinase plasminogen activator and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor inhibits prostate cancer cell invasion, survival, and tumorigenicity in vivo.', 'Epidermal growth factor modulates prostate cancer cell invasiveness regulating urokinase-type plasminogen activator activity.

In the prostate, ASC are increased in cancer compared with prostatic nodular hyperplasia patients. Concordantly, adipsin gene (CFD) expression, which is known to be up-regulated in adipose stem cells, was overexpressed in PP adipose tissue, in the prostate of cancer patients and in prostate CD31(-)CD34(+)CD45(-)CD146(-) sorted cells.

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligand and receptor family have been implicated in the growth and spread of prostate cancer via activation of the blood vasculature and lymphatic systems. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine the expression pattern of VEGF ligands and receptors in the glandular epithelium, stroma, lymphatic vasculature and blood vessels in prostate cancer.  Methods:   The localization of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 was examined in cancerous and adjacent benign prostate tissue from 52 subjects representing various grades of prostate cancer.  Results:   Except for VEGFR-2, extensive staining was observed for all ligands and receptors in the prostate specimens. In epithelial cells, VEGF-A and VEGFR-1 expression was higher in tumor tissue compared to benign tissue. VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 expression was significantly higher in benign tissue compared to tumor in the stroma and the endothelium of lymphatic and blood vessels. In addition, the frequency of lymphatic vessels, but not blood vessels, was lower in tumor tissue compared with benign tissue.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that activation of VEGFR-1 by VEGF-A within the carcinoma, and activation of lymphatic endothelial cell VEGFR-3 by VEGF-D within the adjacent benign stroma may be important signaling mechanisms involved in the progression and subsequent metastatic spread of prostate cancer.

In immunohistochemistry, macrophages were markedly increased in prostatitis and malignant compared to normal tissues. PEDF was expressed at variable levels in the stroma and epithelium. PEDF mRNA was down-regulated in both prostate cancer and prostatitis compared to normal tissues. In correlation studies, macrophage density and PEDF expression were respectively positively and negatively associated with prostate size. Most importantly, PEDF expression positively correlated with macrophage density. Finally, PEDF stimulated the expression of iNOS, IL12, and TNFα; and inhibited IL10 and arginase 1 in mouse and human macrophages confirming a M1-type differentiation.

SIRT1 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase (class III HDAC) that has recently been shown to have implications in regulating cancer cell growth and apoptosis. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of SIRT1 in regulating MMP2 expression and tumor invasion in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The interfering RNAi was used to knockdown SIRT1 from prostate cancer cells. Immunoblots, RT-PCR, zymographic assays, co-immunoprecipitation, analysis and transwell assays were used to examine the effects of SIRT1 silencing on MMP2 expression and activity, on SIRT1 and MMP2 interaction, and on prostate cancer cell invasion. The immuno-histochemical assay was performed to study SIRT1 expression in prostate cancer tissues.  Results:   We show that SIRT1 associates and deacetylates MMP2 and SIRT1 regulates MMP2 expression by controlling MMP2 protein stability through the proteosomal pathway. Thus, we demonstrated a novel mechanism in that MMP2 expression can be regulated at the posttranslational level by SIRT1. Furthermore, we determined that SIRT1 inhibition reduced prostate cancer cell invasion and SIRT1 is highly expressed in advanced prostate cancer tissues.

However, how their expression is regulated in the tumors and whether they play a role in prostate development remains unclear.  Methods:   Prostate tissue from different developmental stages of mouse and human were examined by IHC, qRT-PCR and Western for expression of ANCCA, EZH2, and Ki-67. Animals were castrated and T-implanted for the expression response in normal prostate and tumors. siRNA knockdown and ChIP were performed for the mechanism of ANCCA regulation of EZH2.  Results:   In contrast to their very low level expression in adult prostate, ANCCA and EZH2 are strongly expressed in the epithelium and mesenchyme of mouse and human UGS. Their expression becomes more restricted to epithelial cells during later development and displays a second peak during puberty, which correlates with the proliferative status of the epithelium. Importantly, their expression in normal prostate and tumors is strongly suppressed by castration and markedly induced by testosterone replacement. While androgen suppresses EZH2 in CRPC cells, in LNCaP cells, physiological concentrations of androgen stimulate expression of PRC2 genes (EZH2, SUZ12, and EED), which is mediated by androgen-induced ANCCA and involves E2F and histone H3K4me3 methylase MLL1 complex.

No significant difference in serum insulin, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 levels was noted among all groups at pre-randomization or at sacrifice.  Conclusions:   A 20% carbohydrate diet slowed tumor growth versus a WD.

(44)Sc is a positron emitter with a half life of 3.92 h. Hence it could be used for PET imaging with ligands requiring longer observation time than in the case of (68)Ga.  Methods:   The binding affinity of (nat)Sc-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH(2) and (nat)Ga-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH(2) to GRP receptors was studied in competition to [(125)I-Tyr(4)]-Bombesin in the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. A preliminary biodistribution in normal rats was performed, while first microPET images were assessed in male Copenhagen rats bearing the androgen-independent Dunning R-3327-AT-1 prostate cancer tumor.  Results:   The affinity to GRP receptors in the PC-3 cell line was higher for (nat)Ga-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH(2) (IC(50)(nM)=0.85 ± 0.06) than that of (nat)Sc-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH(2) (IC(50) (nM)=6.49 ± 0.13). The internalization rate of (68)Ga labeled DOTA-BN[2-14]NH(2) was slower than that of (44)Sc, but their final internalization percents were comparable. (68)Ga-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH(2) was externalized faster than (44)Sc-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH(2). The biodistribution of (44)Sc-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH(2) and (68)Ga-DOTA-BN[2-14]NH(2) in normal rats revealed a higher uptake in target organs and tissues of the first one while both excreted mainly through urinary tract. In microPET images both tracers were accumulated in the tumor with similar uptake patterns.  Conclusions:   Despite the differences in the receptor affinity both the (68)Ga- and the (44)Sc-labeled DOTA-BN[2-14]NH(2) tracers showed comparable distribution and similar time constants of uptake and elimination. Moreover no differences in tumor accumulation (neither in the overall uptake nor in the dynamics) were observed from the microPet imaging.

For radiovirotherapy to be effective in humans, the radioiodine dose administered in the pre-clinical animal model should scale to the range of acceptable doses in humans.

This study investigates the signalling mechanism by which the omega-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) induces prostatic cellular migration to bone marrow stroma.  Methods:   Western blot analysis of the PC-3, PC3-GFP, DU 145 and LNCaP cells or their lipid raft (LR) components post AA stimulation was conducted in association with assays for adhesion and invasion through the bone marrow endothelial monolayers.  Results:   Arachidonic acid increased transendothelial migration of PC3-GFP cells (adhesion 37%±0.08, P=0.0124; transmigration 270%±0.145, P=0.0008). Akt, Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathways were induced by AA and integrally involved in transendothelial migration. LR were critical in AA uptake and induced Akt activity. Ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2), localised in LR, is expressed in DU 145 and PC-3 cells. Arachidonic acid induced a rapid increase of EphA2 Akt-dependent/ligand-independent activation, while knockdown of the EphrinA1 ligand decreased AA induced transendothelial migration, with an associated decrease in Src and FAK activity.

Regional differences in the underlying prevalence of PSA testing may alter the pre-test probability for high-risk disease, which can potentially interfere with the performance of selection criteria for AS. In a multicentre study from three different countries, we examine men who were initially suitable for AS according to the Toronto and Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) criteria, that underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) in regards to:1.the proportion of pathological reclassification(Gleason score ≥7, ≥pT3 disease),2.predictors of high-risk disease,3.create a predictive model to assist with selection of men suitable for AS.  Methods:   From three centres in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, data on men who underwent RP were retrospectively reviewed (n=2329). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of high-risk disease. A nomogram was generated by logistic regression analysis, and performance characterised by receiver operating characteristic curves.  Results:   For men suitable for AS according to the Toronto (n=800) and PRIAS (410) criteria, the rates for upgrading were 50.6, 42.7%, and upstaging 17.6, 12.4%, respectively. Significant predictors of high-risk disease were:•Toronto criteria: increasing age, cT2 disease, centre of diagnosis and number of positive cores.•PRIAS criteria: increasing PSA and cT2 disease.Cambridge had a high pT3a rate (26 vs 12%). To assist selection of men in the United Kingdom for AS, from the Cambridge data, we generated a nomogram predicting high-risk features in patients who meet the Toronto criteria (AUC of 0.72).  Conclusion:   The proportion of pathological reclassification in our cohort was higher than previously reported. Care must be used when applying the AS criteria generated from one population to another.

To detect bone metastasis and evaluate the efficacy of treatment, we usually use bone scintigraphy and check serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP). However, such evaluation is sometimes difficult due to flare phenomenon. A 61-year-old male was referred to our department with a suspected diagnosis of lung cancer. Following thorough examinations, he was diagnosed with primary lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, Stage IV) and found to have a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene at exon 21 (L858R). After initiating treatment with oral gefitinib, ALP increased and peaked at 3,592 U/L by 3 weeks and decreased thereafter. At 4 weeks following treatment initiation, bone scintigraphy revealed a marked increase in abnormal accumulation of (99m)Tc-polyphosphate, but the primary tumor and metastases in regions other than the bone were reduced. At 9 weeks after treatment initiation, abnormal accumulations was improved in bone scintigraphy, and computed tomography revealed osteoblastic changes consistent with the accumulated lesion observed by bone scintigraphy. After initiating cancer treatment for bone metastasis, it is not uncommon to observe transient asynchronous accumulation in bone scintigraphy or transient increases in ALP in patients who ultimately respond to the treatment. These changes are called flare phenomenon, and documented in patients with prostate cancer or breast cancer receiving treatment. When determining the efficacy of treatments that target carcinomas with bone metastases, it is important to note that flare phenomenon is often indistinguishable from disease progression indicators.""","""['Mikiko Hashisako', 'Kentarou Wakamatsu', 'Satoshi Ikegame', 'Hiroyuki Kumazoe', 'Nobuhiko Nagata', 'Akira Kajiki']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Tohoku J Exp Med""","""['A case of lung cancer with alkaline phosphatase flare phenomenon during gefitinib therapy.', 'The effect of bevacizumab for bone scintigraphy imaging: A case report.', 'EGFR mutation L747P led to gefitinib resistance and accelerated liver metastases in a Chinese patient with lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Efficacy of gefitinib in treatment of lung cancer patients with bone metastasis.', 'Treatment with erlotinib after gefitinib induced hepatotoxicity: literature review and case report.', 'Osteosclerotic change as a therapeutic response to gefitinib in symptomatic non-small cell lung cancer bone metastasis.', 'Bone Metastases from Gastric Cancer: What We Know and How to Deal with Them.', 'ALK-rearranged pulmonary adenocarcinoma in Thai Patients: From diagnosis to treatment efficacy.', 'False-positive diagnosis of disease progression by magnetic resonance imaging for response assessment in prostate cancer with bone metastases: A case report and review of the pitfalls of images in the literature.', 'Association of CD44 Gene Polymorphism with Survival of NSCLC and Risk of Bone Metastasis.']"""

The effects of concomitant use of NNS with antioxidant activity during radiation therapy for prostate cancer were investigated in terms of clinical tumor responsiveness, kinetics, and durability.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective investigation was done of 134 patients treated with curative intent for limited-stage prostate cancer by radiation therapy. Patients self-selected to receive NNS as part of their treatment and maintenance during an extended post-treatment interval of at least 2 years. The outcome measures were the following: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir; ≥24 months post-treatment PSA; time to reach nadir; and time to last follow-up were compared across +NNS and -NNS.  Results:   Sixty-nine (69) patients elected to receive NNS while 65 did not. Seventy-seven (77) (+NNS 39, -NNS 38) patients received hormone therapy while 57 (+NNS 30, -NNS 27) did not.

The risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer is increased for men carrying a pathogenic germline mutation in BRCA2. An earlier study by the Kathleen Cuningham Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer showed that BRCA2 mutation carriers displayed a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within their prostate cancer tissue in the majority of cases, thus implying that the prostate cancer in these men occurred as a result of LOH for BRCA2. High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) has been considered a precursor to prostate adenocarcinoma in some, but not all, cases of prostate adenocarcinoma. The study found that there was no LOH for BRCA2 in HGPIN. From this small cohort of BRCA2-positive men, we suggest HGPIN is not necessarily a precursor to their prostate cancer development. The presence of HGPIN in a TRUS biopsy in these men at risk of high risk disease is not an indication for prostatectomy.  Objectives:   • To determine if high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), which is considered a precursor to the development of prostate adenocarcinoma, displays the same genetic hallmarks as adenocarcinoma. • To identify, using molecular genetic techniques, if HGPIN is a precursor of tumour development and progression in men carrying a pathogenic germline mutation in BRCA2.  Patients and methods:   • Ten participants from the Kathleen Cuningham Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer cohort of high-risk breast cancer families were identified, with (i) a diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer and presence of HGPIN, (ii) a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation, and (iii) access to archival prostate tissue specimens. • Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the BRCA2 gene was examined using mutation-specific PCR and sequencing of DNA from laser microdissected HGPIN.

MRI has been shown to improve prostate cancer detection rates. Pinto et al. (J Urol 2011; 86: 1281-5) reported their outcomes on 101 patients with low, moderate or high suspicion lesions on multiparametric MRI that were subsequently targeted via an MRI/ultrasound fusion biopsy platform. The prostate cancer detection rates were 27%, 66% and 89% respectively. Sciarra et al. (Clin Cancer Res 2010; 16: 1875-83) performed a prospective trial in 180 patients with prior negative biopsy and persistent PSA elevation. Patients were randomized to either MRI targeted biopsy followed by random 12-core TRUS biopsy vs random TRUS guided biopsy alone. Prostate cancer detection in the MRI targeted group was 45.5% vs 24.4% in the random group. Although MRI has been shown to improve prostate cancer detection rates, there has not previously been any work looking at the ability of MRI to detect prostate cancer localized to the very distal apex of the prostate. This is an important topic in that it might lead clinicians to counsel their patients in treatment decisions if it is felt that a treatment might not treat this section of the prostate well, e.g. high intensity focused ultrasound therapy that might spare the distal apex.  Objective:   • To describe an undescribed 'very distal' apical prostate cancer on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) since apical prostate cancer can be difficult to detect in transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy and might therefore be missed in treatment decisions such as high intensity focused ultrasound or surgical therapy.  Patients and methods:   • From January 2011 to December 2012 a total of 210 consecutive patients underwent 3 T mpMRI with endorectal coil followed by our previously described MRI/ultrasound image fused and directed TRUS biopsies. • Patients also underwent 12-core TRUS sextant biopsies. • The inclusion criteria required at least one distal apical prostate lesion visualized on mpMRI and targeted for biopsy.  Results:   • A total of 38 men (median age 62 years, median PSA 7.68 ng/dL) were identified as having distal apical prostate cancer on mpMRI. • Thirteen patients (34%) had a prior diagnosis of cancer and were on active surveillance protocols while 25 (66%) did not. Of those patients, 21 (55%) had undergone a median of two prior negative biopsies. • Twenty-two patients (58%) were positive on biopsy for prostate cancer. On breakdown of patients who were positive, 17 (77%) were positive on TRUS random biopsies and 21 (95%) were positive on MRI targeted biopsies with the majority of patients having multifocal disease. • At the distal apical lesions of interest, 80% were positive on MRI targeted biopsy. In addition 33% of these patients were upgraded based on MRI targeted biopsy at the distal lesion.  Conclusions:   • Very distal apical prostate cancer can be accurately detected and sampled with mpMRI and subsequent MRI/ultrasound fusion biopsy. • This may aid clinicians and patients in decision making for therapeutic modalities.""","""['Jeffrey W Nix', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Anthony Hoang', 'Dmitry Volkin', 'Nitin Yerram', 'Celene Chua', 'W Marston Linehan', 'Bradford Wood', 'Peter Choyke', 'Peter A Pinto']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Very distal apical prostate tumours: identification on multiparametric MRI at 3 Tesla.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent MRI/ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy increase the detection of anteriorly located prostate cancers.', 'In patients with a previous negative prostate biopsy and a suspicious lesion on magnetic resonance imaging, is a 12-core biopsy still necessary in addition to a targeted biopsy?', 'Multiparametric MRI to improve detection of prostate cancer compared with transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy alone: the PROMIS study.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Landmarks in the evolution of prostate biopsy.', 'Evaluation of the frequency of incidental findings and their clinical significance in multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging examination.', 'Role of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging fusion biopsy in active surveillance of prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Relationship of prostate cancer topography and tumour conspicuity on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Radiomics and Prostate MRI: Current Role and Future Applications.']"""

This study has comprehensive comparisons of post-TURP complications between patients with and without AUR. Furthermore, it shows that AUR is associated with increased risk of complications after TURP.  Objective:   • To assess the association between a history of acute urinary retention (AUR) and complications after transurethral resection of prostate (TURP).  Patients and methods:   • We conducted a retrospective, national, population-based study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. • We included men > 50 years old, diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and divided these into two groups: an AUR(+) group--those with AUR who underwent TURP between 2002 and 2004; and an AUR(-) group--those without AUR who underwent TURP between those dates. • Prostate cancer, Parkinsonism and multiple sclerosis were exclusion criteria. • Postoperative complications, e.g. re-catheterization, haematuria or urinary tract infection (UTI), were compared using crude odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and Student's t-test. • A chi-squared test was used for potential confounding factors: preoperative UTI and anticoagulant use. • Univariate and multivariate analysis on medical expenses were conducted.  Results:   • The AUR(+) group contained 3305 men; the AUR(-) group contained 1062. • Re-catheterization (13.8%), septicaemia (1.1%) and shock (0.3%) were found only in the AUR(+) group. • The AUR(+) group had more UTIs (18.9% vs. 15.6%, OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.05-1.52), more lower urinary tract symptoms (22.8% vs. 16.9%, OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.21-1.73), fewer blood transfusions (3.2% vs. 1.5%, OR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.29-3.72) and higher medical expenses. • There were no significant differences in haematuria, lower urinary tract stricture, or re-surgical intervention of the prostate and second-line antibiotic use.  Conclusion:   • Patients in Taiwan with BPH with AUR who were treated by TURP were associated with a higher risk of complications, longer hospital stay and more comorbidities than those without AUR and a preoperative warning is warranted for these patients.""","""['Jeng-Sheng Chen', 'Chia-Hsien Chang', 'Wen-Horng Yang', 'Yea-Huei Kao']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Editorial comment: Acute urinary retention increases the risk of complications after transurethral resection of the prostate: a population-based study.', 'Re: acute urinary retention increases the risk of complications after transurethral resection of the prostate: a population-based study.', 'Urodynamic impact of acute urinary retention in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a 2-year follow-up after transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'Feasibility of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for recurrent/residual benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).', 'Long-term results of contact laser versus transurethral resection of the prostate in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia with small or moderately enlarged prostates.', ""Examining the 'gold standard': a comparative critical analysis of three consecutive decades of monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) outcomes."", 'Electrosurgical transurethral resection of the prostate and transurethral incision of the prostate (monopolar techniques).', 'Pharmacological and interventional treatment of benign prostatic obstruction: An evidence-based comparative review.', 'Prostate artery embolization for the treatment of urinary retention caused by large (>80\xa0\u200bmL) benign prostatic hyperplasia: Results of 21 patients.', 'Monopolar Transurethral Resection of Prostate for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Patients With and Without Preoperative Urinary Catheterization: A Prospective Comparative Study.', 'HoLEP for acute and non-neurogenic chronic urinary retention: how effective is it?', 'Serum interleukin 6 and acute urinary retention in elderly men with benign prostatic hyperplasia in China: a cross-sectional study.']"""

The history of radical prostatectomy was initially characterised by the problems in approaching this relatively difficulty accessible organ. In 1867, Theodor Billroth in Vienna performed the first partial prostatectomy via a perineal access. In 1904, Hugh Hampton Young and William Stewart Halsted at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore / USA carried out the first successful extracapsular perineal prostatectomy and opened up a new era. In Germany, Prof. Friedrich Voelcker in Halle in 1924 developed the so-called ischiorectal prostatectomy. But it was left to Terence Millin to publish in 1945 the first series of retropubic prostatectomies. In 1952, the sacroperineal approach according to Thiermann and the sacral prostatectomy according to were introduced. Finally, in 1991 another new era in prostate surgery started with the first laparoscopic prostatectomy. This development peaked in 2011 with the presentation of the laparoscopic DaVinci prostatectomy by Binder. Originally a stepchild of urological surgery that was to be avoided whenever possible due to the fear of serious complications, the prostate has progressed in the course of time to an obscure object of lust.

Additionally, the influence of individual-level characteristics, such as preference for daytime activity versus nighttime activity or chronotype, has not been considered.

In contrast, remodeling correlates with RAS, HIF-1α and NFκB activation. From the metabolic point of view, proliferation is associated with upregulation of glycolysis and serine/glycine metabolism, whereas remodeling is characterized by a downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation.

The androgen receptor (AR), a master regulator of the male phenotype and prostate cancer pathogenesis, acts primarily through ligand-activated transcription of target genes. Although several determinants of AR transcriptional specificity have been elucidated, our understanding of the interplay between chromatin accessibility and AR function remains incomplete.  Results:   We used deep sequencing to assess chromatin structure via DNase I hypersensitivity and mRNA abundance, and paired these datasets with three independent AR ChIP-seq datasets. Our analysis revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in chromatin accessibility that corresponded to both AR binding and an enrichment of motifs for potential collaborating factors, one of which was identified as SP1. These quantitative differences were significantly associated with AR-regulated mRNA transcription across the genome. Base-pair resolution of the DNase I cleavage profile revealed three distinct footprinting patterns associated with the AR-DNA interaction, suggesting multiple modes of AR interaction with the genome.  Conclusions:   In contrast with other DNA-binding factors, AR binding to the genome does not only target regions that are accessible to DNase I cleavage prior to hormone induction. AR binding is invariably associated with an increase in chromatin accessibility and, consequently, changes in gene expression. Furthermore, we present the first in vivo evidence that a significant fraction of AR binds only to half of the full AR DNA motif. These findings indicate a dynamic quantitative relationship between chromatin structure and AR-DNA binding that impacts AR transcriptional specificity.""","""['Alok K Tewari', 'Galip Gürkan Yardimci', 'Yoichiro Shibata', 'Nathan C Sheffield', 'Lingyun Song', 'Barry S Taylor', 'Stoyan G Georgiev', 'Gerhard A Coetzee', 'Uwe Ohler', 'Terrence S Furey', 'Gregory E Crawford', 'Phillip G Febbo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Genome Biol""","""['Androgen up-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in prostate cancer cells via an Sp1 binding site.', 'Regulation of androgen receptor-mediated transcription by RPB5 binding protein URI/RMP.', 'An AR-ERG transcriptional signature defined by long-range chromatin interactomes in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor enhancer usage and the chromatin regulatory landscape in human prostate cancers.', 'Sequencing the transcriptional network of androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Correction of transposase sequence bias in ATAC-seq data with rule ensemble modeling.', 'Transcriptional and Post-Transcriptional Regulations of Amyloid-β Precursor Protein (APP) mRNA.', 'The Prostate Cancer Androgen Receptor Cistrome in African American Men Associates with Upregulation of Lipid Metabolism and Immune Response.', 'Dynamic nucleosome landscape elicits a noncanonical GATA2 pioneer model.']"""

Regulation of androgen receptor (AR), through which androgens control the expression of genes involved in prostate cells proliferation, migration and death also involves its cross-talk with the other signaling pathways, transcription factors and coregulatory proteins, such as β-catenin. With the aim to determine their possible contribution in triggering the switch from AS to AI form, which occurs upon androgen deprivation therapy - AR, Akt and β-catenin expression were knocked-down with respective siRNAs. Treatment of LNCaP prostate cells with siRNA for AR significantly reduced their proliferation (45-70%), expression of nuclear β- catenin, cyclin-D1, cyclin-G1, c-Myc as well as activity of metalloproteinases (MMPs) -2,-7,-9 and cell migration. Surprisingly, after longer (over 72 hrs) silencing of AR in LNCaP cells, elevated levels of p-Akt were detected and enhanced proliferation as well as expression of nuclear β-catenin, cyclin-D1, c-Myc and activity of MMPs were observed.

However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment may limit the effectiveness of current immunotherapies. Antiangiogenic agents have the potential to modulate the tumor microenvironment and improve immunotherapy, but they often are used at high doses in the clinic to prune tumor vessels and paradoxically may compromise various therapies. Here, we demonstrate that targeting tumor vasculature with lower vascular-normalizing doses, but not high antivascular/antiangiogenic doses, of an anti-VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) antibody results in a more homogeneous distribution of functional tumor vessels. Furthermore, lower doses are superior to the high doses in polarizing tumor-associated macrophages from an immune inhibitory M2-like phenotype toward an immune stimulatory M1-like phenotype and in facilitating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell tumor infiltration. Based on this mechanism, scheduling lower-dose anti-VEGFR2 therapy with T-cell activation induced by a whole cancer cell vaccine therapy enhanced anticancer efficacy in a CD8(+) T-cell-dependent manner in both immune-tolerant and immunogenic murine breast cancer models. These findings indicate that vascular-normalizing lower doses of anti-VEGFR2 antibody can reprogram the tumor microenvironment away from immunosuppression toward potentiation of cancer vaccine therapies. Given that the combinations of high doses of bevacizumab with chemotherapy have not improved overall survival of breast cancer patients, our study suggests a strategy to use antiangiogenic agents in breast cancer more effectively with active immunotherapy and potentially other anticancer therapies.""","""['Yuhui Huang', 'Jianping Yuan', 'Elda Righi', 'Walid S Kamoun', 'Marek Ancukiewicz', 'Jean Nezivar', 'Michael Santosuosso', 'John D Martin', 'Margaret R Martin', 'Fabrizio Vianello', 'Pierre Leblanc', 'Lance L Munn', 'Peigen Huang', 'Dan G Duda', 'Dai Fukumura', 'Rakesh K Jain', 'Mark C Poznansky']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Vascular normalization as an emerging strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy.', '""γδT Cell-IL17A-Neutrophil"" Axis Drives Immunosuppression and Confers Breast Cancer Resistance to High-Dose Anti-VEGFR2 Therapy.', 'Targeting CXCR4-dependent immunosuppressive Ly6Clow monocytes improves antiangiogenic therapy in colorectal cancer.', 'Low-Dose Anti-Angiogenic Therapy Sensitizes Breast Cancer to PD-1 Blockade.', 'Vascular normalization and cancer immunotherapy.', 'Sintilimab plus bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and capecitabine as first-line therapy in RAS-mutant, microsatellite stable, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: an open-label, single-arm, phase II trial.', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: where are we and where are we going?', 'Reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment: exploiting angiogenesis and thrombosis to enhance immunotherapy.', 'Developing a dual VEGF/PDL1 inhibitor based on high-affinity scFv heterodimers as an anti-cancer therapeutic strategy.', 'Camrelizumab plus famitinib in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with PD-1 blockade: data from a multicohort phase 2 study.']"""

We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of lay patient navigators on time to resolution and completion of follow-up testing among patients with abnormal screening tests in a medically underserved patient population.  Methods:   Denver Health, the safety-net health care system serving Denver, is one of 10 performance sites participating in the Patient Navigation Research Program. Of 993 eligible subjects with abnormal screening tests randomized to navigation and no-navigation (control) arms and analyzed, 628 had abnormal breast screens (66 abnormal clinical breast examinations, 304 BIRADS 0, 200 BIRADS 3, 58 BIRADS 4 or 5) whereas 235 had abnormal colorectal and 130 had abnormal prostate screens.  Results:   Time to resolution was significantly shorter in the navigated group (stratified log rank test, P < 0.001). Patient navigation improved diagnostic resolution for patients presenting with mammographic BIRADS 3 (P = 0.0003) and BIRADS 0 (P = 0.09), but not BIRADS 4/5 or abnormal breast examinations. Navigation shortened the time for both colorectal (P = 0.0017) and prostate screening resolution (P = 0.06). Participant demographics included 72% minority, 49% with annual household income less than $10,000, and 36% uninsured.  Conclusions:   Patient navigation positively impacts time to resolution of abnormal screening tests for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers in a medically underserved population.

Methods:   A total of 665 patients diagnosed with PCa and 703 cancer-free controls were genotyped in this hospital-based case-control study, and 26 PCa tissue samples were evaluated for mRNA expression of CYR61 by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR.  Results:   Men carrying the G allele of rs3753793 (TG+GG) had significantly lower risk of PCa when compared with the TT genotype (odds ratio (OR) = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61-0.95).

Urine samples were collected before and after prostate biopsy, and BRM was collected from the biopsy needle. We used reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of fusion transcripts. Microfocal cancer (MFC) on biopsy was defined by a single core involved with ≤3 mm of cancer with Gleason score 3 + 3. We statistically assessed the association between RT-PCR and biopsy results.  Results:   Urine alone, BRM alone, and both samples were obtained in 4, 19, and 57 patients, respectively. Three patients were excluded because of insufficient material. In the remaining 77 patients, cancer was detected on biopsy in 42 (55%).

The authors conducted a broad evaluation of the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in innate immunity and inflammation pathways with lung cancer risk and conducted comparisons with a lung cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS).  Methods:   In total, 378 patients with lung cancer (cases) and a group of 450 controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were included. A proprietary oligonucleotide pool assay was used to genotype 1429 SNPs. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for each SNP, and P values for trend (P(trend) ) were calculated. For statistically significant SNPs (P(trend) < .05), the results were replicated with genotyped or imputed SNPs in the GWAS, and P values were adjusted for multiple testing.  Results:   In the PLCO analysis, a significant association was observed between lung cancer and 81 SNPs located in 44 genes (P(trend) < .05). Of these 81 SNPS, there was evidence for confirmation in the GWAS for 10 SNPs. However, after adjusting for multiple comparisons, the only SNP that retained a significant association with lung cancer in the replication phase was reference SNP rs4648127 (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer of B-cells 1 [NFKB1]) (multiple testing-adjusted P(trend) = .02). The cytosine-thymine (CT)/TT genotype of NFKB1 was associated with reduced odds of lung cancer in the PLCO study (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.86) and the in the GWAS (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.90).

Experimental approach:   The anti-cancer effects of MH were examined in prostate cancer and normal cells. The effects were validated in vivo using a mouse xenograft model.  Key results:   MH increased the expression of PPARγ in prostate PC-3 and LNCap cells. The pull-down assay and molecular docking study indicated that MH directly binds to PPARγ. MH also increased transcriptional activity of PPARγ but decreased NF-κB activity. MH inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer cells, an effect attenuated by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. MH induced apoptotic cell death and this was related to G(0) -G(1) phase cell cycle arrest. MH increased the expression of the cell cycle regulator p21, and apoptotic proteins, whereas it decreased phosphorylation of Rb and anti-apoptotic proteins. Transfection of PC3 cells with p21 siRNA or a p21 mutant plasmid on the cyclin D1/ cycline-dependent kinase 4 binding site abolished the effects of MH on cell growth, cell viability and related protein expression.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) showed a reduction in prostate cancer mortality of 21% for PSA-based screening at a median follow-up of 11 years. In the ERSPC, men are screened at 4-year intervals. A prostate biopsy is recommended for men with a PSA level ≥ 3.0 ng/mL. The study shows that the positive predictive value (PPV) of a prostate biopsy indicated by PSA-based screening remains equal throughout consecutive screening rounds in men without a previous biopsy. In men who have previously had a benign biopsy, the PPV drops considerably, but 20% of the cancers detected still show aggressive characteristics.  Objective:   • To assess the positive predictive value (PPV) of prostate biopsy, indicated by a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) threshold of ≥ 3.0 ng/mL, over time, in the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).  Patients and methods:   • In the Rotterdam section of the ERSPC, a total of 42,376 participants, aged 55-74 years, identified from population registries were randomly assigned to a screening or control arm. • For the ERSPC men undergo PSA screening at 4-year intervals. A total of three screening rounds were evaluated; therefore, only men aged 55-69 years at the first screening were eligible for the present study.  Results:   • PPVs for men without previous biopsy remained equal throughout the three subsequent screenings (25.5, 22.3 and 24.8% respectively). • Conversely, PPVs for men with a previous negative biopsy dropped significantly (12.0 and 15.2% at the second and third screening, respectively). • Additionally, in men with and without previous biopsy, the percentage of aggressive prostate cancers (clinical stage >T2b, Gleason score ≥ 7) decreased after the first round of screening from 44.4 to 23.8% in the second (P < 0.001) and 18.6% in the third round (P < 0.001). • Repeat biopsies accounted for 24.6% of all biopsies, but yielded only 8.6% of all aggressive cancers.  Conclusions:   • In consecutive screening rounds the PPV of PSA-based screening remains equal in previously unbiopsied men. • In men with a previous negative biopsy the PPV drops considerably, but 20% of cancers detected still show aggressive characteristics. • Individualized screening algorithms should incorporate previous biopsy status in the decision to perform a repeat biopsy with the aim of further reducing unnecessary biopsies.""","""['Leonard P Bokhorst', 'Xiaoye Zhu', 'Meelan Bul', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Fritz H Schröder', 'Monique J Roobol']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['No reason for immediate repeat sextant biopsy after negative initial sextant biopsy in men with PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or greater (ERSPC, Rotterdam).', 'Is it necessary to detect all prostate cancers in men with serum PSA levels <3.0 ng/ml?

Methods:   Using population-based cancer registry data for New South Wales Australia, we estimated conditional 5-year relative survival for 11 major cancers diagnosed 1972-2006 by time since diagnosis and age and stage at diagnosis.  Results:   193,182 cases were included, with the most common cancers being prostate (39,851), female breast (36,585) and colorectal (35,455). Five-year relative survival tended to increase with increasing years already survived and improvement was greatest for cancers with poor prognosis at diagnosis (lung or pancreas) and for those with advanced stage or older age at diagnosis. After surviving 10 years, conditional 5-year survival was over 95% for 6 localised, 6 regional, 3 distant and 3 unknown stage cancers. For the remaining patient groups, conditional 5-year survival ranged from 74% (for distant stage bladder cancer) to 94% (for 4 cancers at different stages), indicating that they continue to have excess mortality 10-15 years after diagnosis.  Conclusion:   These data provide important information for cancer patients, based on age and stage at diagnosis, as they continue on their cancer journey.

Emerging evidence suggests that chronic inflammation is a major risk factor for the development and metastatic progression of prostate cancer. We previously reported that the chemopreventive polyphenol curcumin inhibits the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and -2 leading to diminished formation of breast cancer metastases. In this study, we analyze the effects of curcumin on prostate carcinoma growth, apoptosis and metastasis. We show that curcumin inhibits translocation of NFκB to the nucleus through the inhibition of the IκB-kinase (IKKβ, leading to stabilization of the inhibitor of NFκB, IκBα, in PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells. Inhibition of NFκB activity reduces expression of CXCL1 and -2 and abolishes the autocrine/paracrine loop that links the two chemokines to NFκB. The combination of curcumin with the synthetic IKKβ inhibitor, SC-541, shows no additive or synergistic effects indicating that the two compounds share the target. Treatment of the cells with curcumin and siRNA-based knockdown of CXCL1 and -2 induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation and downregulate several important metastasis-promoting factors like COX2, SPARC and EFEMP. In an orthotopic mouse model of hematogenous metastasis, treatment with curcumin inhibits statistically significantly formation of lung metastases. In conclusion, chronic inflammation can induce a metastasis prone phenotype in prostate cancer cells by maintaining a positive proinflammatory and prometastatic feedback loop between NFκB and CXCL1/-2. Curcumin disrupts this feedback loop by the inhibition of NFκB signaling leading to reduced metastasis formation in vivo.""","""['Peter H Killian', 'Emanuel Kronski', 'Katharina M Michalik', 'Ottavia Barbieri', 'Simonetta Astigiano', 'Christian P Sommerhoff', 'Ulrich Pfeffer', 'Andreas G Nerlich', 'Beatrice E Bachmeier']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Curcumin downregulates the inflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and -2 in breast cancer cells via NFkappaB.', 'miR181b is induced by the chemopreventive polyphenol curcumin and inhibits breast cancer metastasis via down-regulation of the inflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and -2.', 'Progesterone and calcitriol attenuate inflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 in ovarian and endometrial cancer cells.', 'Curcumin inhibits proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis of different cancers through interaction with multiple cell signaling proteins.', 'Recent insights into NF-κB signalling pathways and the link between inflammation and prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Applications of Curcumin: Update.', 'Role of the Dietary Phytochemical Curcumin in Targeting Cancer Cell Signalling Pathways.', 'Involvement in Tumorigenesis and Clinical Significance of CXCL1 in Reproductive Cancers: Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Endometrial Cancer, Ovarian Cancer and Prostate Cancer.', 'Curcumin and chemokines: mechanism of action and therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases.', 'Impacts of turmeric and its principal bioactive curcumin on human health: Pharmaceutical, medicinal, and food applications: A comprehensive review.']"""

Thus, a challenge is identifying potentially lethal disease at diagnosis. Conflicting results have been reported when investigating the relationship between infiltration of lymphocytes and survival in prostate cancer. One of the mechanisms suggested is the recruitment of regulatory T cells (T(regs)), a subpopulation of T cells that have a role in promoting tumor growth. T(regs) counteract tumor rejection through suppressive functions on the anti-immune response but their prognostic significance is still unknown. We report here the results of a conducted case-control study nested in a cohort of men treated with transurethral resection of the prostate and diagnosed incidentally with prostate cancer. Cases are men who died of prostate cancer (n=261) and controls are men who survived >10 years after their diagnosis (n=474). Infiltration of both T(helper) and T(cytotoxic) cells was frequently observed and the majority of the T(regs) were CD4(+). T(helper) or T(cytotoxic) cells were not associated with lethal prostate cancer. However, we found a nearly twofold increased risk of lethal prostate cancer when comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of CD4(+) T(regs) cells (95% confidence interval: 1.3-2.9). Our conclusion is that men with greater numbers of CD4(+) T(regs) in their prostate tumor environment have an increased risk of dying of prostate cancer.

Increased expression and/or stability of AR is associated with sensitization of prostate cancer cells to low levels of androgens, leading to castration resistance. Hence, understanding the mechanisms regulating AR protein stability is clinically relevant and may lead to new approaches to prevent and/or treat prostate cancer. Using fluorescence microscopy, Western blot, and pulse chase assay, we showed that nuclear export signal (NES)(AR), a nuclear export signal in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of AR, can significantly enhance the degradation of fusion protein constructs in PC3 prostate cancer cells. The half-life of GFP-NES(AR) was less than 3 h, which was 10 times shorter than that of green fluorescent protein (GFP) control. Further analysis showed that NES(AR) can signal for polyubiquitination and that degradation of NES(AR)-containing fusion proteins can be blocked by proteasome inhibitor MG132. Ubiquitination of GFP-AR or GFP-LBD was suppressed in the presence of dihydrotestosterone, which is known to suppress NES(AR) while inducing nuclear localization signal 2 in AR or LBD, suggesting that the export activity of NES(AR) is required for NES(AR)-mediated polyubiquitination. Treatment with MG132 also induced aggresome formation of NES(AR)-containing fusion proteins in perinuclear regions of the transfected PC3 cells, indicating a role for NES(AR) in inducing unfolded protein responses.

A better understanding of the factors that regulate the progression of CaP is required to delineate risk. For example, aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is implicated in CaP progression. Here, we identify the serine protease inhibitor protease nexin 1 (PN1) as a negative regulator of Hh signaling in prostate. Using human CaP cell lines and a mouse xenograft model of CaP, we demonstrate that PN1 regulates Hh signaling by decreasing protein levels of the Hh ligand Sonic (SHH) and its downstream effectors. Furthermore, we show that SHH expression enhanced tumor growth while overexpression of PN1 inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice.

Materials and methods:   Patients underwent IMRT with curative intent for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after cryotherapy. Radiation was delivered to a minimum dose of 72 Gy (range, 72-81 Gy). Acute and late treatment-related gastrointestinal and genitourinary effects were scored according to Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. Prostate-specific antigen failure was defined by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology 2006 consensus definition.  Results:   Nine patients were treated from 2008 to 2010. The median follow-up was 31 months (range, 15-40 months). The mean preradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen was 4.3 ng/mL (range, 1.07-15.6 ng/mL). The median elapsed time between cryotherapy and IMRT was 20.5 months (range, 8.5-56.5 months). Biochemical control was achieved in 7 patients. Two patients developed distant metastases shortly after completion of radiotherapy. No patients experienced grade 3 or higher toxicities.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that high-dose IMRT after cryotherapy failure is well tolerated, without severe morbidity. The results also showed that IMRT can render a significant number of patients biochemically free of disease after initial cryotherapy. High-dose IMRT should be considered as a treatment option for these potentially salvageable cases.""","""['Mehee Choi', 'Choong R Kim', 'Arthur Y Hung']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Salvage hypofractionated radiotherapy for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the prostate after cryotherapy: initial experience.', 'Late toxicity after intensity-modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: an exploration of dose-volume histogram parameters to limit genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy as primary treatment for prostate cancer: acute toxicity in 114 patients.', 'Cryosurgery: is it an effective option for patients failing radiation?', 'Salvage Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy After Definitive Cryoablation.', 'Salvage image guided radiation therapy to the prostate after cryotherapy failure.']"""

However, the response is rather limited and not all of the patients benefit from this treatment. To uncover key mechanisms of docetaxel insensitivity in prostate cancer, we have established docetaxel-resistant sublines. In this study, we report that docetaxel-resistant cells underwent an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during the selection process, leading to diminished E-cadherin levels and up-regulation of mesenchymal markers. Screening for key regulators of an epithelial phenotype revealed a significantly reduced expression of microRNA (miR)-200c and miR-205 in docetaxel-resistant cells. Transfection of either microRNA (miRNA) resulted in re-expression of E-cadherin. Functional assays confirmed reduced adhesive and increased invasive and migratory abilities. Furthermore, we detected an increased subpopulation with stem cell-like properties in resistant cells. Tissue microarray analysis revealed a reduced E-cadherin expression in tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Low E-cadherin levels could be linked to tumor relapse. The present study uncovers epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as a hallmark of docetaxel resistance.

During the radiotherapy, the prostate is radiated by high-energy x rays from different directions. In order to maximize the dose to the cancer and minimize the dose to the surrounding healthy tissues (e.g., bladder and rectum), the prostate in the new treatment image needs to be accurately localized. Therefore, the effectiveness and efficiency of external beam radiotherapy highly depend on the accurate localization of the prostate. However, due to the low contrast of the prostate with its surrounding tissues (e.g., bladder), the unpredicted prostate motion, and the large appearance variations across different treatment days, it is challenging to segment the prostate in CT images. In this paper, the authors present a novel classification based segmentation method to address these problems.  Methods:   To segment the prostate, the proposed method first uses sparse representation based classification (SRC) to enhance the prostate in CT images by pixel-wise classification, in order to overcome the limitation of poor contrast of the prostate images. Then, based on the classification results, previous segmented prostates of the same patient are used as patient-specific atlases to align onto the current treatment image and the majority voting strategy is finally adopted to segment the prostate. In order to address the limitations of the traditional SRC in pixel-wise classification, especially for the purpose of segmentation, the authors extend SRC from the following four aspects: (1) A discriminant subdictionary learning method is proposed to learn a discriminant and compact representation of training samples for each class so that the discriminant power of SRC can be increased and also SRC can be applied to the large-scale pixel-wise classification. (2) The L1 regularized sparse coding is replaced by the elastic net in order to obtain a smooth and clear prostate boundary in the classification result. (3) Residue-based linear regression is incorporated to improve the classification performance and to extend SRC from hard classification to soft classification. (4) Iterative SRC is proposed by using context information to iteratively refine the classification results.  Results:   The proposed method has been comprehensively evaluated on a dataset consisting of 330 CT images from 24 patients. The effectiveness of the extended SRC has been validated by comparing it with the traditional SRC based on the proposed four extensions. The experimental results show that our extended SRC can obtain not only more accurate classification results but also smoother and clearer prostate boundary than the traditional SRC. Besides, the comparison with other five state-of-the-art prostate segmentation methods indicates that our method can achieve better performance than other methods under comparison.  Conclusions:   The authors have proposed a novel prostate segmentation method based on the sparse representation based classification, which can achieve considerably accurate segmentation results in CT prostate segmentation.""","""['Yaozong Gao', 'Shu Liao', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Prostate segmentation by sparse representation based classification.', 'Deformable segmentation of 3D MR prostate images via distributed discriminative dictionary and ensemble learning.', 'Learning image context for segmentation of the prostate in CT-guided radiotherapy.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Boundary Restored Network for Subpleural Pulmonary Lesion Segmentation on Ultrasound Images at Local and Global Scales.', 'Dental hard tissue morphological segmentation with sparse representation-based classifier.', 'Voxel Deconvolutional Networks for 3D Brain Image Labeling.', 'A NOVEL IMAGE-SPECIFIC TRANSFER APPROACH FOR PROSTATE SEGMENTATION IN MR IMAGES.', 'Learning Distance Transform for Boundary Detection and Deformable Segmentation in CT Prostate Images.']"""

The intensity-based deformable image registration (DIR) methods cannot create a correct spatial transformation if there is no correspondence between the template and the target images. The variation of rectal filling, gas, or feces, creates a non correspondence in image intensities that becomes a great obstacle for intensity-based DIR.  Methods:   In this study the authors have designed and implemented a semiautomatic method to create a rectum mask in pelvic computed tomography (CT) images. The method, that includes a DIR based on the demons algorithm, has been tested in 13 prostate cancer cases, each comprising of two CT scans, for a total of 26 CT scans.  Results:   The use of the manual segmentation in the planning image and the proposed rectum mask method (RMM) method in the daily image leads to an improvement in the DIR performance in pelvic CT images, obtaining a mean value of overlap volume index = 0.89, close to the values obtained using the manual segmentations in both images.

In this paper, the authors investigate whether RapidArc is more susceptible to delivery uncertainties than dynamic IMRT using fixed fields.  Methods:   Dosimetric effects of delivery uncertainties in dose rate, gantry angle, and MLC leaf positions were evaluated by incorporating these uncertainties into RapidArc and sliding window IMRT (SW IMRT) treatment plans for five head-and-neck and five prostate cases. Dose distributions and dose-volume histograms of original and modified plans were recalculated and compared using Gamma analysis and dose indices of planned treatment volumes (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR). Results of Gamma analyses using passing criteria ranging from 1%-1 mm up to 5%-3 mm were reported.  Results:   Systematic shifts in MLC leaf bank positions of SW-IMRT cases resulted in 2-4 times higher average percent differences than RapidArc cases. Uniformly distributed random variations of 2 mm for active MLC leaves had a negligible effect on all dose distributions. Sliding window cases were much more sensitive to systematic shifts in gantry angle. Dose rate variations during RapidArc must be much larger than typical machine tolerances to affect dose distributions significantly; dynamic IMRT is inherently not susceptible to such variations.  Conclusions:   RapidArc deliveries were found to be more tolerant to variations in gantry position and MLC leaf position than SW IMRT. This may be attributed to the fact that the average segmental field size or MLC leaf opening is much larger for RapidArc. Clinically acceptable treatments may be delivered successfully using RapidArc despite large fluctuations in dose rate and gantry position.""","""['Gregory T Betzel', 'Byong Yong Yi', 'Ying Niu', 'Cedric X Yu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Rotational IMRT techniques compared to fixed gantry IMRT and tomotherapy: multi-institutional planning study for head-and-neck cases.', 'RapidArc patient specific mechanical delivery accuracy under extreme mechanical limits using linac log files.', 'Evaluation of MLC leaf positioning accuracy for static and dynamic IMRT treatments using DAVID in vivo dosimetric system.', 'Poster - Thur Eve - 40: Dynamic arc sliding window tests for checking MLC gap consistency in rapid arc delivery.', 'IMRT and RapidArc commissioning of a TrueBeam linear accelerator using TG-119 protocol cases.', 'Insensitivity of machine log files to MLC leaf backlash and effect of MLC backlash on clinical dynamic MLC motion: An experimental investigation.', 'Assessment of Statistical Process Control Based DVH Action Levels for Systematic Multi-Leaf Collimator Errors in Cervical Cancer RapidArc Plans.', 'Identification of a potential source of error for 6FFF beams delivered on an AgilityTM multileaf collimator.', 'Trajectory log file sensitivity: A critical analysis using DVH and EPID.', 'Comparisons of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) quality assurance (QA) systems: sensitivity analysis to machine errors.']"""

Results:   Pretreatment and post-treatment radiographs indicated that the use of gas-release rectal balloons reduced prostate intrafraction motion along superior-inferior (SI) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions. Similar patient setup residual errors were exhibited for both types of balloons. Gas-release rectal balloons resulted in PTV margin reductions from 3.9 to 2.8 mm in the SI direction, 3.1 to 1.8 mm in the AP direction, and an increase from 1.9 to 2.1 mm in the left-right direction.  Conclusions:   Prostate intrafraction motion is an important uncertainty source in radiotherapy after image-guided patient setup with online corrections. Compared to non-gas-release rectal balloons, gas-release balloons can reduce prostate intrafraction motion in the SI and AP directions caused by gas buildup.""","""['Zhong Su', 'Tianyu Zhao', 'Zuofeng Li', 'Brad Hoppe', 'Randy Henderson', 'William Mendenhall', 'R Charles Nichols', 'Robert Marcus', 'Nancy Mendenhall']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A comparative study of prostate PTV margins for patients using hydrogel spacer or rectal balloon in proton therapy.', 'Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'Inter- and intrafraction uncertainty in prostate bed image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Clinical to planning target volume margins in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Organ motion and its management.', 'Dosimetric Uncertainties in Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion Simultaneous Boost Using Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy.', 'Consensus Statement on Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of intrafraction prostate motion on clinical target coverage in proton therapy: A simulation study of dosimetric differences in two delivery techniques.', 'Real-time prostate motion assessment: image-guidance and the temporal dependence of intra-fraction motion.']"""

Functional outcomes were evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite). Continence was defined as zero to one security pad per day. Oncological outcomes were evaluated based on positive surgical margin.  Results:   In the dorsal vein complex preserving technique for intrafascial nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group, the continence rate was 57%, 77% and 95% at 1, 3 and 12 months, respectively. The continence rate in the conventional intrafascial nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group was 37%, 63% and 90%, and in the non-nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group it was 23%, 57% and 82% at 1, 3, and 12 months, respectively.

Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities with regard to prostate cancer incidence have been reported in the United States of America (US); however, detailed information regarding health disparities in PR is scarce.  Methods:   Age-standardized rates for prostate cancer incidence and mortality were calculated based on the world standard population using data from the PR Central Cancer Registry and the National Cancer Institute SEER program. The age-specific relative risks were calculated using Poisson regression models. In addition, incidence and mortality rates in PR were compared by socioeconomic position (SEP) at the municipal level.  Results:   For the period from 1992 to 2004, the incidence and mortality trends of prostate cancer decreased in all racial/ethnic groups except for PR men and US Hispanics (USH). Non-Hispanic whites (NHW), non-Hispanic blacks (NHB), and USH had higher incidence of prostate cancer than did PR men; however, PR men aged 85+ yrs and USH aged 45-54 yrs/85+ yrs, respectively, had higher incidences than did NHW and USH. Nonetheless, men in PR had a higher mortality than did USH and NHW. PR men aged 55-64 years with the highest SEP had a 40% higher mortality of prostate cancer than did those with the lowest SEP.  Conclusion:   Areas of concern include the higher mortality of prostate cancer in PR as compared with the USH and NHW in the US.

Extensive pathway and network analysis allow for the discovery of highly significant pathways from a set of disease vs. healthy samples in the NGS and GWAS. Knowledge of activation of these processes will lead to elucidation of the complex biological pathways affected by drug treatment, to patient stratification studies of new and existing drug treatments, and to understanding the underlying anti-cancer drug effects. There are approximately 141 biological human pathway resources as of Jan 2012 according to the Pathguide database. However, most currently available resources do not contain disease, drug or organ specificity information such as disease-pathway, drug-pathway, and organ-pathway associations. Systematically integrating pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity together becomes increasingly crucial for understanding the interrelationships between signaling, metabolic and regulatory pathway, drug action, disease susceptibility, and organ specificity from high-throughput omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).  Results:   We designed the Integrated Pathway Analysis Database for Systematic Enrichment Analysis (IPAD, http://bioinfo.hsc.unt.edu/ipad), defining inter-association between pathway, disease, drug and organ specificity, based on six criteria: 1) comprehensive pathway coverage; 2) gene/protein to pathway/disease/drug/organ association; 3) inter-association between pathway, disease, drug, and organ; 4) multiple and quantitative measurement of enrichment and inter-association; 5) assessment of enrichment and inter-association analysis with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a ""gold standard"" constructed from reputable and reliable sources; and 6) cross-linking of multiple available data sources.IPAD is a comprehensive database covering about 22,498 genes, 25,469 proteins, 1956 pathways, 6704 diseases, 5615 drugs, and 52 organs integrated from databases including the BioCarta, KEGG, NCI-Nature curated, Reactome, CTD, PharmGKB, DrugBank, PharmGKB, and HOMER. The database has a web-based user interface that allows users to perform enrichment analysis from genes/proteins/molecules and inter-association analysis from a pathway, disease, drug, and organ.Moreover, the quality of the database was validated with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a ""gold standard"" constructed from reputable and reliable sources. Two case studies were also presented to demonstrate: 1) self-validation of enrichment analysis and inter-association analysis on brain-specific markers, and 2) identification of previously undiscovered components by the enrichment analysis from a prostate cancer study.  Conclusions:   IPAD is a new resource for analyzing, identifying, and validating pathway, disease, drug, organ specificity and their inter-associations. The statistical method we developed for enrichment and similarity measurement and the two criteria we described for setting the threshold parameters can be extended to other enrichment applications. Enriched pathways, diseases, drugs, organs and their inter-associations can be searched, displayed, and downloaded from our online user interface. The current IPAD database can help users address a wide range of biological pathway related, disease susceptibility related, drug target related and organ specificity related questions in human disease studies.""","""['Fan Zhang', 'Renee Drabier']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['HOMER: a human organ-specific molecular electronic repository.', 'HPD: an online integrated human pathway database enabling systems biology studies.', 'IIS--Integrated Interactome System: a web-based platform for the annotation, analysis and visualization of protein-metabolite-gene-drug interactions by integrating a variety of data sources and tools.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'An Experimental Approach to Genome Annotation: This report is based on a colloquium sponsored by the American Academy of Microbiology held July 19-20, 2004, in Washington, DC.', 'Rapid Evolution of Expression Levels in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Cruxome: a powerful tool for annotating, interpreting and reporting genetic variants.', 'Identification of novel alternative splicing biomarkers for breast cancer with LC/MS/MS and RNA-Seq.', 'Fucoxanthin may inhibit cervical cancer cell proliferation via downregulation of HIST1H3D.', 'Identification of long non-coding RNA-related and -coexpressed mRNA biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Six conferences (1962-1972) examined the puzzling neurotoxic and carcinogenic properties of a then-novel toxin [cycasin: methylazoxymethanol (MAM)-β-d-glucoside] in cycad plants used traditionally for food and medicine on Guam where a complex neurodegenerative disease plagued the indigenous population. Affected families showed combinations of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), parkinsonism (P), and/or a dementia (D) akin to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Modernization saw declining disease rates on Guam and remarkable changes in clinical phenotype (ALS was replaced by P-D and then by D) and in two genetically distinct ALS-PDC-affected populations (Kii-Japan, West Papua-Indonesia) that used cycad seed medicinally. MAM forms DNA lesions - repaired by O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) - that perturb mouse brain development and induce malignant tumors in peripheral organs. The brains of young adult MGMT-deficient mice given a single dose of MAM show DNA lesion-linked changes in cell-signaling pathways associated with miRNA-1, which is implicated in colon, liver, and prostate cancers, and in neurological disease, notably AD. MAM is metabolized to formaldehyde, a human carcinogen. Formaldehyde-responsive miRNAs predicted to modulate MAM-associated genes in the brains of MGMT-deficient mice include miR-17-5p and miR-18d, which regulate genes involved in tumor suppression, DNA repair, amyloid deposition, and neurotransmission. These findings marry cycad-associated ALS-PDC with colon, liver, and prostate cancer; they also add to evidence linking changes in microRNA status both to ALS, AD, and parkinsonism, and to cancer initiation and progression.""","""['Peter Spencer', 'Rebecca C Fry', 'Glen E Kisby']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Does the cycad genotoxin MAM implicated in Guam ALS-PDC induce disease-relevant changes in mouse brain that includes olfaction?', 'Parkinsonism and motor neuron disorders: Lessons from Western Pacific ALS/PDC.', 'Western Pacific ALS-PDC: Evidence implicating cycad genotoxins.', 'The cycad genotoxin MAM modulates brain cellular pathways involved in neurodegenerative disease and cancer in a DNA damage-linked manner.', 'Return of the cycad hypothesis - does the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism dementia complex (ALS/PDC) of Guam have new implications for global health?', 'Neuroprotective potential of biochanin-A and review of the molecular mechanisms involved.', 'Early-onset, conjugal, twin-discordant, and clusters of sporadic ALS: Pathway to discovery of etiology via lifetime exposome research.', 'Genotoxic Damage During Brain Development Presages Prototypical Neurodegenerative Disease.', 'MicroRNA and circRNA Expression Analysis in a Zbtb1 Gene Knockout Monoclonal EL4 Cell Line.', 'MicroRNAs Regulating Cytoskeleton Dynamics, Endocytosis, and Cell Motility-A Link Between Neurodegeneration and Cancer?']"""

Patients and methods:   Fourty-eight patients were recruited (median follow-up=41 months; range=12-84 months). Twenty-one received HypoARC after surgery and 27 at biochemical relapse. Radiotherapy was given with a 3D-conformal technique, delivering 2.7 Gy/day to the pelvis and 3.4 Gy to the peri-prostatic region for 14 fractions. A 15th fraction increased the total dose to the peri-prostatic area to 51 Gy (15×3.4 Gy) in 19 days. Amifostine was delivered before each radiotherapy fraction at an individualized (by tolerance) dose (0-1000 mg).  Results:   Amifostine was delivered subcutaneously at 1000 mg in 35/48 (72.9%) patients, while lower doses were tolerated by the remaining patients. Twenty-six (54.2%) patients accomplished therapy without delays, while acute toxicities enforced 1 to 2 week delays in 11/48 patients (22.9%). Grade 2 proctitis was noted in 18.7%, while substantial bleeding occurred in 8.3% of patients. Grade 1 dysurea was noted in 27.1%, while diarrhea grade 2 appeared in 10.4% of patients. High amifostine dose was linked to a significant reduction of proctitis (p=0.04). No severe late toxicities were noted. Within a median of 41 months, 7/48 (14.6%) patients exhibited post-radiotherpy biochemical failure (in four due to metastasis).

Patients and methods:   Records of the diagnosed (n=105) and operated (n=91) patients were retrospectively reviewed. Age, percentage of positive cores at-biopsy (P+), biopsy Gleason score (bGS), E(2), prolactin (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone (TT), free-testosterone (FT), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), pathology Gleason score (pGS), estimated tumor volume in relation to percentage of prostate volume (V+), overall prostate weight (Wi), clinical stage (cT), biopsy Gleason pattern (bGP) and pathology stage (pT), were the investigated variables. None of the patients had previously undergone hormonal manipulations. E(2) correlation and prediction by multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) was performed. At diagnosis, the log E(2)/log bGS ratio clustered the population into groups A (log E(2)/log bGS ≤ 2.25), B (2.25<log E(2)/log bGS ≤ 2.48) and C (2.48< log E(2)/log bGS ≤ 2.59). The operated population was clustered according to the log E(2)/log pGS ratio into groups A (log E(2)/log pGS ≤ 2.25), B (2.25< log E(2)/log pGS ≤ 2.48) and C (2.48< log E(2)/log pGS ≤ 2.59). Simple linear regression analysis of bGS and pGS predicting E(2) was computed; differences between the clusters were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and by contingency tables.  Results:   At diagnosis, E(2) was correlated to TT (r=0.32, p=0.0006) and FT (r=0.25, p=0.0009); moreover, E(2) was independently-predicted by TT (p=0.009) and bGS (p=0.04) on MLRA.

Results:   RPTPβ/ζ knockdown initiates EMT, promotes pleiotrophin-mediated migration and attachment through Syndecan-3 and induces in vivo metastasis.  Conclusion:   RPTPβ/ζ plays a suppressor-like role in prostate cancer metastasis.  Significance:   Boosting RPTPβ/ζ or attenuating Syndecan-3 signaling pathways may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies in treating prostate cancer metastasis. Pleiotrophin is a growth factor that induces carcinogenesis. Despite the fact that many published reports focused on the role of pleiotrophin and its receptors, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTPβ/ζ), and syndecan-3 during tumor development, no information is available regarding their function in tumor metastasis. To investigate the mechanism through which pleiotrophin regulates tumor metastasis, we used two different prostate carcinoma cell lines, DU145 and PC3, in which the expression of RPTPβ/ζ or syndecan-3 was down-regulated by the RNAi technology. The loss of RPTPβ/ζ expression initiated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased the ability of the cells to migrate and invade. Importantly, the loss of RPTPβ/ζ expression increased metastasis in nude mice in an experimental metastasis assay. We also demonstrate that RPTPβ/ζ counterbalanced the pleiotrophin-mediated syndecan-3 pathway. While the inhibition of syndecan-3 expression inhibited the pleiotrophin-mediated cell migration and attachment through the Src and Fak pathway, the inhibition of RPTPβ/ζ expression increased pleiotrophin-mediated migration and attachment through an interaction with Src and the subsequent activation of a signal transduction pathway involving Fak, Pten, and Erk1/2. Taken together, these results suggest that the loss of RPTPβ/ζ may contribute to the metastasis of prostate cancer cells by inducing EMT and promoting pleiotrophin activity through the syndecan-3 pathway.""","""['Zoi Diamantopoulou', 'Paraskevi Kitsou', 'Suzanne Menashi', 'Jose Courty', 'Panagiotis Katsoris']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['A Pleiotrophin C-terminus peptide induces anti-cancer effects through RPTPβ/ζ.', 'Fyn is a downstream target of the pleiotrophin/receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta-signaling pathway: regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn by pleiotrophin.', 'Pleiotrophin disrupts calcium-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion and initiates an epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Anaplastic lymphoma kinase: ""Ligand Independent Activation"" mediated by the PTN/RPTPβ/ζ signaling pathway.', 'Pleiotrophin and its receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta as regulators of angiogenesis and cancer.', 'Pleiotrophin and metabolic disorders: insights into its role in metabolism.', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Zeta 1 as a Potential Target in Cancer Therapy and Diagnosis.', 'Proteoglycans Determine the Dynamic Landscape of EMT and Cancer Cell Stemness.', 'Single-Cell Analysis Uncovers Osteoblast Factor Growth Differentiation Factor 10 as Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation Associated with Plaque Rupture in Human Carotid Artery Disease.', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases: Mechanisms in Cancer.']"""

Inhibitor of differentiation (Id) family of closely related proteins (Id1-Id4) are dominant negative regulators and basic helix loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors and in general promote proliferation, and inhibit differentiation. In the present study, we have investigated the role of Id1 and Id3 proteins in the growth inhibitory effects of TGFβ on prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The effect of TGF β on proliferation and Id1 and Id3 expression were investigated in PZ-HPV7, DU145, and PC3 cells. Id1 silencing through siRNA was also used in DU145 and PC3 cells to examine its role in anti-proliferative and migratory effects of TGFβ.  Results:   TGFβ increased expression of Id1 and Id3 in all cell lines followed by a later down regulation of Id1 in PZ-HPV7 expression and DU145 cells but not in PC3 cells. Id3 expression remained elevated in all three cell lines. This loss of Id1 protein correlated with an increase of CDKNI p21. Id1 knockdown in both DU145 and PC3 cells resulted in decreased proliferation. However, while TGFβ caused a further decrease in proliferation of DU145, but had no further effects in PC3 cells. Knockdown of Id1 or Id3 inhibited TGFβ1induced migration in PC3 cells.

The incidence of prostate cancer in African American men is more than twice as high as that of any other race. Despite the high prevalence of prostate cancer amongst African American men, this population has been under represented in genetic studies of prostate cancer. Although genomic copy number variations (CNVs) have been detected in prostate tumors, this is the first study describing germline CNVs in African American hereditary prostate cancer families.  Methods:   Ten high-risk African American families with three or more affected individuals and with an early age of onset were recruited. From these families, 37 individuals, including 23 affected males, and 14 unaffected males, were selected for CNV analysis. Array comparative genomic hybridization was used to characterize germline CNVs unique to African American men with hereditary prostate cancer.  Results:   Through common aberration analysis in affected family members; novel CNVs were identified at chromosomes 1p36.13 and 16q23.3. Differential analysis comparing affected and unaffected family members identified 9.4 kb duplication on chromosome 14q32.33 which segregate with prostate cancer patients in these high-risk families.  Conclusions:   The duplication at 14q32.33 encompasses IGHG3 gene which has been shown to have both significant gains in copy number as well as overexpression in prostate tumors in African Americans.

Therefore, we propose to study the effect of sex hormones in the regulation of STEAP1 expression in prostate cells in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   LNCaP prostate cells were incubated with fetal bovine serum (FBS), charcoal-stripped FBS (CS-FBS), 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 17β-estradiol (E2 ) for different periods of stimulation. In addition, adult male Wistar rats were castrated and treated with DHT and E2 . The levels of STEAP1 in response to treatments were analyzed by real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   The treatment of LNCaP cells with DHT or E2 induces a down-regulation of STEAP1 expression, while incubation with CS-FBS has the opposite effect. Experiments using inhibitors of androgen and estrogen receptor (AR and ER) showed that down-regulation of STEAP1 is AR-dependent, but ER-independent. However, the mediation of six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) expression by AR seems to be dependent of de novo protein synthesis. In vivo studies showed that castrated rats express higher levels of STEAP1 protein when compared to intact rats, an effect reversed by DHT or E2 replacement.

Given the identification of activating mutations in the FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) receptor tyrosine kinase in a subset of endometrial tumors, agents with activity against FGFRs are currently being tested in clinical trials for recurrent and progressive endometrial cancer. Here, we evaluated the effect of FGFR inhibition on the in vitro efficacy of chemotherapy in endometrial cancer cell lines.  Methods:   Human endometrial cancer cell lines with wild-type or activating FGFR2 mutations were used to determine any synergism with concurrent use of the pan-FGFR inhibitor, PD173074, and the chemotherapeutics, doxorubicin and paclitaxel, on cell proliferation and apoptosis.  Results:   FGFR2 mutation status did not alter sensitivity to either chemotherapeutic agent alone. The combination of PD173074 with paclitaxel or doxorubicin showed synergistic activity in the 3 FGFR2 mutant cell lines evaluated. In addition, although nonmutant cell lines were resistant to FGFR inhibition alone, the addition of PD173074 potentiated the cytostatic effect of paclitaxel and doxorubicin in a subset of FGFR2 wild-type endometrial cancer cell lines.

Methods:   miR-153 was identified to be overexpressed in prostate cancers. The probable biological function of miR-153 in cellular proliferation was then examined by diverse assays, such as MTT, colony formation and BrdUrd incorporation assay. Moreover, real-time PCR and western blotting analysis were applied to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism induced by miR-153. Luciferase assays were used to determined the FOXO1 transactivity and the direct regulation of PTEN-3'-UTR by miR-153.  Results:   High-throughput method identified miR-153 to be upregulated in prostate cancers, which is further confirmed by the upregulated expression in four paired prostate tumor/adjacent non-cancerous tissues from the same patients. Further studies revealed that overexpression of miR-153 promoted cell cycle transition and cell proliferation, while inhibition of miR-153 reduced this effect. Moreover, miR-153 overexpression in prostate cancer cells increased the G1/S transitional promoter, cyclin D1 expression, and decreased cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21(Cip1) expression.

ERβ is thought to regulate the cell cycle of prostate carcinoma cells by controlling the expression of cell cycle regulators including cyclin D1 (CCND1). This interaction is of particular interest as CCND1 has been implicated in the development of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We evaluated ERβ and CCND1 immunoreactivity in human prostate cancer (n = 112, surgical specimens), and correlated the findings with clinicopathological features of the patients. Subsequent in vitro experiments using PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells were also performed to examine whether estradiol (E2) could change the expression level of CCND1 mRNA.  Results:   CCND1 immunoreactivity was detected in 78/112 cases (70%), and was significantly correlated with incidence of perineural invasion and ERβ immunoreactivity (P < 0.05). Forty-eight hours incubation with E2 (10 nM) increased the expression level of CCND1 mRNA as well as c-jun (JUN) and c-fos (FOS) in PC-3 cells, and PHTPP (ERβ antagonist) suppressed E2 -induced expression of those mRNAs.

Though controversial, this recommendation reinforced the critical need to develop, validate, and determine the utility of other serum and/or urine transcript and protein markers as diagnostic markers for PCa. The studies described here were intended to determine whether inflammatory cytokines might augment serum PSA as a diagnostic marker for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Multiplex ELISA assays were performed to quantify CCL1, CCL2, CCL5, CCL8, CCL11, CCL17, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10, CXCL12, and IL-6 protein levels in the serum of 272 men demonstrating serum PSA values of <10 ng/ml and undergoing a 12 core diagnostic needle biopsy for detection of prostate cancer.

We analysed blood mRNA expression arrays to identify patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with poorer outcome.  Methods:   Whole blood was collected into PAXgene tubes from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and patients with prostate cancer selected for active surveillance. In stage I (derivation set), patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer were used as cases and patients under active surveillance were used as controls. These patients were recruited from The Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (Sutton, UK) and The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre (Glasgow, UK). In stage II (validation-set), patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer recruited from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, USA) were assessed. Whole-blood RNA was hybridised to Affymetrix U133plus2 microarrays. Expression profiles were analysed with Bayesian latent process decomposition (LPD) to identify RNA expression profiles associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer subgroups; these profiles were then confirmed by quantative reverse transcriptase (qRT) PCR studies and correlated with overall survival in both the test-set and validation-set.  Findings:   LPD analyses of the mRNA expression data divided the evaluable patients in stage I (n=94) into four groups. All patients in LPD1 (14 of 14) and most in LPD2 (17 of 18) had castration-resistant prostate cancer. Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and those under active surveillance comprised LPD3 (15 of 31 castration-resistant prostate cancer) and LDP4 (12 of 21 castration-resistant prostate cancer). Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer in the LPD1 subgroup had features associated with worse prognosis and poorer overall survival than patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer in other LPD subgroups (LPD1 overall survival 10·7 months [95% CI 4·1-17·2] vs non-LPD1 25·6 months [18·0-33·4]; p<0·0001). A nine-gene signature verified by qRT-PCR classified patients into this LPD1 subgroup with a very low percentage of misclassification (1·2%). The ten patients who were initially unclassifiable by the LPD analyses were subclassified by this signature. We confirmed the prognostic utility of this nine-gene signature in the validation castration-resistant prostate cancer cohort, where LPD1 membership was also associated with worse overall survival (LPD1 9·2 months [95% CI 2·1-16·4] vs non-LPD1 21·6 months [7·5-35·6]; p=0·001), and remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analyses for both cohorts.

The tumor was attached to the right dorsal aspect of the prostate with compression of the seminal vesicles and rectum. It was considered that the tumor had arisen from the prostate, although the patient's serum prostate-specific antigen level was low (0.436 ng/mL). The histological diagnosis by prostate needle biopsy was a spindle cell tumor. At cystoprostatectomy, the tumor was confirmed to be separated from the prostate by a fibrous band, and showed spindle cells with a fascicular growth pattern, but without necrotic areas. Mitotic figures were noted in 12 of 50 high-power fields. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for the KIT protein (CD117), CD34, Discovered on GIST-1 (DOG-1), and vimentin. In contrast, they were negative for desmin, α-smooth muscle actin, pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3), and S100 protein. The Ki-67 labeling index was 5%. The genetic analyses targeting the c-kit gene revealed a point mutation at codon 559 (GTT→GAT). The diagnosis of GIST was confirmed on the basis of the morphological features, immunoprofile, and results of the molecular analyses.

H11/HspB8 and ICP10PK are atypical protein kinases. They share multi-functional activity that encompasses signaling, unfolded protein response (UPR) and the regulation of life cycle potential. In melanocytes H11/HspB8 causes growth arrest. It is silenced in a high proportion of melanoma prostate cancer, Ewing's sarcoma and hematologic malignancies through aberrant DNA methylation. Its restored expression induces cell death and inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models, identifying H11/HspB8 as a tumor suppressor. This function involves the activation of multiple and distinct death pathways, all of which initiate with H11/HspB8-mediated phosphorylation of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). Both ICP10PK and H11/HspB8 were implicated in inflammatory processes that involve dendritic cells activation through Toll-like receptor-dependent pathways and may contribute to the onset of autoimmunity.

Emerging conflicting data and lack of reproducibility of results within the scientific community has now led to the association of XMRV with CFS being discounted. Indeed the case for an involvement with any human disease has been questioned with the suggestion that XMRV is a laboratory generated recombinant virus. The fact that not all published positive findings can be easily explained as contamination artefacts coupled with the observation that XMRV may have a sexually transmitted mode of infectivity and can be infectious for primates, where it preferential resides in cells of the reproductive tract, prompted us to look for evidence of XMRV in the cervical cells of a cohort of Kenyan women both with and without pre-existing HIV/HPV infections.  Results:   Using a highly sensitive and selective triplex PCR approach we analysed DNA from the liquid based cytology (LBC) cervical smears of 224 Kenyan women. There was no evidence of XMRV expression in any of the sample population irrespective of HPV and/or HIV status.  Conclusions:   The data presented show no indication of XMRV infection in any of the cervical samples screened in this study. Approximately 50% of the women were HIV positive but this did not influence the findings signifying that XMRV does not act as an opportunistic infection in this cohort nor is it related to HPV status.

We previously reported that a formulated DIM (BR-DIM; hereafter referred as B-DIM) with higher bioavailability was able to induce apoptosis and inhibit cell growth, angiogenesis, and invasion of prostate cancer cells. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) for the anti-cancer effects of B-DIM have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated whether AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a molecular target of B-DIM in human prostate cancer cells. Our results showed, for the first time, that B-DIM could activate the AMPK signaling pathway, associated with suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), down-regulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression, and induction of apoptosis in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells. B-DIM also activates AMPK and down-regulates AR in androgen-independent C4-2B prostate tumor xenografts in SCID mice.

To test this approach, we developed a mouse model of prostate cancer by generating clonal derivatives of the mouse RM-1 prostate cancer cell line expressing human PSMA (RM-1-PSMA cells).

Administering DCs infected ex vivo with CD40-targeted Ad5-huPSMA, as well as direct intraperitoneal injection of the vector, resulted in high levels of tumor-specific CTL responses against RM-1-PSMA cells pretreated with Ad5-IFNγ as target cells. CD40 targeting significantly improved the therapeutic antitumor efficacy of Ad5-huPSMA encoding PSMA when combined with Ad5-IFNγ in the RM-1-PSMA model. These results suggest that a CD-targeted adenovirus delivering PSMA may be effective clinically for prostate cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Briana Jill Williams', 'Shilpa Bhatia', 'Lisa K Adams', 'Susan Boling', 'Jennifer L Carroll', 'Xiao-Lin Li', 'Donna L Rogers', 'Nikolay Korokhov', 'Imre Kovesdi', 'Alexander V Pereboev', 'David T Curiel', 'J Michael Mathis']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Anti-prostate cancer effects of CTL cell induction in vitro by recombinant adenovirus mediated PSMA/4-1BBL dendritic cells: an immunotherapy study.', 'DNA fusion gene vaccines induce cytotoxic T-cell attack on naturally processed peptides of human prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Dual antigen target-based immunotherapy for prostate cancer eliminates the growth of established tumors in mice.', 'Dendritic cell gene therapy.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Prostate Microbiota and Prostate Cancer: A New Trend in Treatment.', 'Development of Spherical Nucleic Acids for Prostate Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Development of an adenovirus vector vaccine platform for targeting dendritic cells.', 'Epstein Barr virus Latent Membrane Protein-1 enhances dendritic cell therapy lymph node migration, activation, and IL-12 secretion.', 'Dendritic cell targeting vaccine for HPV-associated cancer.']"""

The replication-selective mutants AdΔΔ and dl922-947, defective in pRb-binding, have been demonstrated to synergise with the current standard of care, mitoxantrone and docetaxel, in prostate cancer models. While expression of the early viral E1A gene is essential for the enhanced cell killing, the specific E1A-regions required for the effects are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that replicating mutants deleted in small E1A-domains, binding pRb (dl1108), p300/CBP (dl1104) and p400/TRRAP or p21 (dl1102) sensitize human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU145, 22Rv1) to mitoxantrone and docetaxel. Through generation of non-replicating mutants, we demonstrate that the small E1A12S protein is sufficient to potently sensitize all prostate cancer cells to the drugs even in the absence of viral replication and the E1A transactivating domain, conserved region (CR) 3. Furthermore, the p300/CBP-binding domain in E1ACR1 is essential for drug-sensitisation in the absence (AdE1A1104) but not in the presence of the E1ACR3 (dl1104) domain. AdE1A1104 also failed to increase apoptosis and accumulation of cells in G2/M. All E1AΔCR2 mutants (AdE1A1108, dl922-947) and AdE1A1102 or dl1102 enhance cell killing to the same degree as wild type virus. In PC-3 xenografts in vivo the dl1102 mutant significantly prolongs time to tumor progression that is further enhanced in combination with docetaxel. Neither dl1102 nor dl1104 replicates in normal human epithelial cells (NHBE).

Androgen receptor (AR) is the main mediator of androgen activity in the prostate, through its ability to act as a transcription mediator. Here we performed a genome-wide analysis of human AR binding to promoters in the presence of an agonist or antagonist in an androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line. Many of the AR bound promoters are bound in all examined conditions while others are bound only in the presence of an agonist or antagonist. Several motifs are enriched in AR bound promoters, including the AR Response Element (ARE) half-site and recognition elements for the transcription factors OCT1 and SOX9. This suggests that these 3 factors could define a module of co-operating transcription factors in the prostate. Interestingly, AR bound promoters are preferentially located in AT rich genomic regions. Analysis of mRNA expression identified chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor 1 (COUP-TF1) as a direct AR target gene that is downregulated upon binding by the agonist liganded AR. COUP-TF1 immunostaining revealed nucleolar localization of COUP-TF1 in epithelium of human androgen dependent prostate cancer, but not in adjacent benign prostate epithelium. Stromal cells both in human and mouse prostate show nuclear COUP-TF1 staining. We further show that there is an inverse correlation between COUP-TF1 expression in prostate stromal cells and the rising levels of androgen with advancing puberty. This study extends the pool of recognized putative AR targets and identifies a negatively regulated target of AR - COUP-TF1 - which could possibly play a role in human prostate cancer.""","""['Ruth Perets', 'Tommy Kaplan', 'Ilan Stein', 'Guy Hidas', 'Shay Tayeb', 'Eti Avraham', 'Yinon Ben-Neriah', 'Itamar Simon', 'Eli Pikarsky']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II negatively regulates the transactivation of androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Integration of cap analysis of gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis on array reveals genome-wide androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'A hierarchical network of transcription factors governs androgen receptor-dependent prostate cancer growth.', 'Androgen receptor enhancer usage and the chromatin regulatory landscape in human prostate cancers.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Transcription in Prostate Cancer.', 'Enzalutamide-induced and PTH1R-mediated TGFBR2 degradation in osteoblasts confers resistance in prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Differential Regulation of Lacto-/Neolacto- Glycosphingolipid Biosynthesis Pathway Reveals Transcription Factors as Potential Candidates in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'The Roles of Embryonic Transcription Factor BRACHYURY in Tumorigenesis and Progression.', 'NR2F1 contributes to cancer cell dormancy, invasion and metastasis of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma by activating CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway.', 'The Role of Nuclear Receptors in Prostate Cancer.']"""

This phenomenon, called ""length bias"", will influence subsequent analyses such as Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. In the presence of length bias, Gene Ontology categories that include longer genes are more likely to be identified as enriched. These categories, however, are not necessarily biologically more relevant. We show that one can effectively adjust for length bias in Gene Ontology analysis by including transcript length as a covariate in a logistic regression model. The logistic regression model makes the statistical issue underlying length bias more transparent: transcript length becomes a confounding factor when it correlates with both the Gene Ontology membership and the significance of the differential expression test. The inclusion of the transcript length as a covariate allows one to investigate the direct correlation between the Gene Ontology membership and the significance of testing differential expression, conditional on the transcript length.

In prostate cancer, aggressive cases over-express Tip60 which functions as an androgen receptor co-activator via direct acetylation of lysine residues within the KLKK motif of the receptor hinge region. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterise a Tip60 acetylase inhibitor. High-throughput screening revealed an isothiazole that inhibited both Tip60 and p300 HAT activity. This substance (initially identified as 4-methyl-5-bromoisothiazole) and other isothiazoles were synthesised and assayed against Tip60. Although an authentic sample of 4-methyl-5-bromoisothiazole was inactive against Tip60, in an in vitro HAT assay, 1,2-bis(isothiazol-5-yl)disulfane (NU9056) was identified as a relatively potent inhibitor (IC(50) 2 µM). Cellular activity was confirmed by analysis of acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins in a prostate cancer cell line model. NU9056 treatment inhibited cellular proliferation in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines (50% growth inhibition, 8-27 µM) and induced apoptosis via activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Also, decreased androgen receptor, prostate specific antigen, p53 and p21 protein levels were demonstrated in response to treatment with NU9056. Furthermore, pre-treatment with NU9056 inhibited both ATM phosphorylation and Tip60 stabilization in response to ionising radiation.

Upper urinary tract tumours are well recognised in Lynch syndrome, but the association with prostate and bladder cancer is controversial. We determined the incidence and cumulative and relative risks of prostate and bladder cancer in a cohort of Lynch syndrome families. Male Lynch syndrome mutation carriers and their genetically untested male first degree relatives (FDR) were identified from the Manchester Regional Lynch syndrome database (n = 821). Time to the development of urological cancer was identified for each urological site (renal pelvis, ureter, bladder and prostate). Cumulative and relative risks were calculated, with results classified by mutation carrier status and specific causative genetic mutations. Eight prostate cancers were identified, only one occurring before the age of 60. Analysis of person-years at risk of prostate cancer by Lynch syndrome mutation carrier status suggests a correlation between MSH2 mutation carriers and a tenfold increased risk of prostate cancer (RR 10.41; 95 % CI 2.80, 26.65). No such association was found with bladder cancer (RR 1.88; 95 % CI 0.21, 6.79). The association of upper urinary tract tumours with MSH2 and MLH1 mutations was confirmed. We have carried out the largest study of male Lynch syndrome mutation carriers to establish the risks of urological malignancy. A tenfold increased risk of prostate cancer is supported in MSH2 with mutation carriers having roughly double the risk of prostate cancer to FDRs. A trial of PSA testing in MSH2 carriers from 40 to 50 years may be justifiable.""","""['P J Barrow', 'S Ingham', ""C O'Hara"", 'K Green', 'I McIntyre', 'F Lalloo', 'J Hill', 'D G Evans']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Fam Cancer""","""['Urinary Tract Cancer in Lynch Syndrome; Increased Risk in Carriers of MSH2 Mutations.', 'Risks of colorectal and other cancers after endometrial cancer for women with Lynch syndrome.', 'Risk of urothelial bladder cancer in Lynch syndrome is increased, in particular among MSH2 mutation carriers.', 'Lynch syndrome in urological practice: diagnosis, therapeutic strategies, and screening for upper tract urothelial carcinoma.', 'Gender-specific aspects of Lynch syndrome--an update.', 'Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: A Rare Malignancy with Distinct Immuno-Genomic Features in the Era of Precision-Based Therapies.', 'Gender-specific counselling of patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma and Lynch syndrome.', 'Nephrolithiasis-Associated Renal Cell Carcinoma in Patients Who Underwent Nephrectomy: A Single-Center Experience.', 'Relative Risk of Bladder and Kidney Cancer in Lynch Syndrome: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Genitourinary manifestations of Lynch syndrome in the urological practice.']"""

The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between erectile function and radiation dose to the penile bulb (PB) and other proximal penile structures in men receiving conformal radiotherapy (CRT) without hormonal therapy (HT) for prostate cancer, whose sexual function was known before treatment.  Patients and methods:   The study included 19 patients treated with 3D-CRT for localized prostate cancer at our department, who were self-reported to be potent before treatment, had not received HT, and had complete follow-up data available. Our evaluation was based on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were used to evaluate the dose to the PB. Statistical analysis was performed with an unconditional logistic regression model.  Results:   All patients reported change in potency after radiation. Eight patients (42%) remained potent but showed a decrease of 1 or 2 levels of potency, as defined by the IIEF-5 questionnaire (reduced potency group), while 11 patients (58%) reported a change of higher levels and revealed a severe erectile dysfunction after 2 years (impotence group). Multivariate analysis of morphological and dosimetric variables yielded significance for the mean dose (p = 0.05 with an odds ratio of 1.14 and 95% CI 1-1.30).

Patients and methods:   Ten patients with localized prostate carcinoma treated with external beams underwent image-guided radiotherapy. In total, 162 CBCT images were collected. Position of prostate and pubis symphysis (PS) with respect to the isocenter were measured off-line. Using the CBCT scans obtained in the first three fractions the average position of prostate in relation (AvPosPr) to PB was calculated. On each CBCT scan, the position of prostate with respect to AvPosPr was calculated and cumulative histogram of prostate displacement with respect to AvPosPr was prepared. Using this data, the adaptive protocol was prepared in which (1) based on the CBCT made in the first three fractions the AvPosPr to PS is obtained, (2) in all other fractions two orthogonal images are acquired and if for any direction set-up error exceeds 0.2 cm the patient's position is corrected, and (3) additionally, the patient's position is corrected if the AvPosPr exceeds 0.2 cm in any direction. To evaluate the adaptive protocol for 30 consecutive patients, the CBCT was also made in 10th and 21st fraction.  Results:   For the first 10 patients, the results revealed that the prostate was displaced in relation to AvPosPr >0.7 cm in the vertical and longitudinal directions only on 4 and 5 images of 162 CBCT images, respectively. For the lateral direction, this displacement was >0.3 cm in one case. For the group of 30 patients, displacement was never >0.7, and 0.3 cm for the vertical and lateral directions.

Patients and methods:   Pelvic IMRT to 45-50.4 Gy was applied in 39 cases either after previous surgery of involved lymph nodes (n = 18) or with a radiation boost to suspicious nodes (n = 21) with doses of 60-70 Gy, usually combined with androgen deprivation (n = 37). The prostate and seminal vesicles received 70-74 Gy. In cases of previous prostatectomy, prostatic fossa and remnants of seminal vesicles were given 66-70 Gy. Treatment-related acute and late toxicity was graded according to the RTOG criteria.  Results:   Acute radiation-related toxicity higher than grade 2 occurred in 2 patients (with the need for urinary catheter/subileus related to adhesions after surgery). Late toxicity was mild (grade 1-2) after a median follow-up of 70 months. Over 50% of the patients reported no late morbidity (grade 0). PSA control and cancer-specific survival reached 67% and 97% at over 5 years.

For this purpose, unpublished data of patients treated by radiation therapy in Hamburg in the late 1980s were analyzed. Relatively large volumes were exposed to comparatively high doses, thus leading to a high rate of treatment-related side effects.  Patients and methods:   A total of 180 consecutive patients received radiotherapy for prostate cancer. The median age was 66 years (range 41-88 years). The median of the maximum dose was 77.5 Gy (range 56.3-95 Gy) and overall treatment time was 51 days (range 28-128 days). Endpoints analyzed were late complications of grade 3 or higher, overall and disease-free survival, local tumor control, and distant metastases. Data analysis was actuarial and the log-rank test was used to compare the various subgroups.  Results:   After 2 years, 80.5 ± 3.2% of the patients were without any complications of grade 3 or higher, and after 5 years a constant level of 70.3 ± 4.0% was approached. When multiple lesions occurred per patient, the later events were disregarded. A total of 66 complications occurred in 42 patients. The percentage of patients being free from late complications, plotted as a function of time after start of radiation therapy, was adequately described by an exponential function and a constant fraction. Complications approached a constant level of 70.3% at a rate of 5.3% per month. This means that patients who will develop a complication do so at exponential kinetics and at a relatively high rate, whereas about 70% of the patients will never experience a late effect even over long observation periods. After subdividing the maximum dose into three equal dose groups of 55 patients each (< 73.3 Gy, 73.3-80 Gy, > 80 Gy), the constant fraction decreased from 85.7 to 72.8% and 52.2%, whereas the incidence rate was 4.3%, 7.7%, and 5.6% per month and, thus, almost independent of radiation dose.  Conclusion:   For a given group of patients, the rate of the incidence of late complications appears to be independent of radiation dose and (from analyzing data in the literature) independent of the grade of lesions, whereas the fraction of patients without late effects depends on both parameters.""","""['H Jung', 'H-P Beck-Bornholdt', 'V Svoboda', 'W Alberti', 'T Herrmann']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer : Morbidity of local-only or local-plus-pelvic radiotherapy.', 'Toxicity and outcome of pelvic IMRT for node-positive prostate cancer.', 'Lateral rectal shielding reduces late rectal morbidity following high dose three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: further evidence for a significant dose effect.', 'Effect of higher radiation dose on biochemical control after radical prostatectomy for PT3N0 prostate cancer.', 'Quantification of late complications after radiation therapy.', 'Dependence of the safe rectum dose on the CTV-PTV margin size and treatment technique.', 'Association of genetic variants in apoptosis genes FAS and FASL with radiation-induced late toxicity after prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Protocol-based image-guided salvage brachytherapy.

Subsequently this subgroup was compared to the overall patient cohort with regard to perioperative results, pathological tumor stage, functional outcomes after 12 months and the prostate cancer-specific mortality and biochemical recurrence free survival.  Results:   The following results reflect the comparison of the cohort of patients who were ≥75 years of age versus the overall cohort of patients. A statistical difference of the parameters analyzed was observed only for minor complications 15.5 % versus 11.4 % (p<0.05), neurovascular bundle (NVB) preservation 51.1 % versus 65.7 % (p<0.05) and potency after 12 months 39.6 % versus 66.2 % (p<0.001).

Consensus exists that men over the age of 75 years should not be screened for PCa; however, higher age as a single parameter should not exclude men from being diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated accordingly. It is well-known that overdiagnosis and overtreatment are frequent in this age group. Competing mortality risks of men older than 75 years may supersede the risk of dying from PCa several fold. Both the treating physician and the patient himself should therefore balance the possible risks and benefits of diagnosing and treating prostate cancer concerning the impact on quality of life. This is of special importance when taking into account that the complication rates of curative treatment modalities are higher in older patients than in younger men and that hormonal treatment might have negative effects especially in older men.Age, existing comorbidities, cognitive and physical status in combination with specific tumor parameters are useful tools for an individualized treatment.Therapy should be considered for healthy, active men aged 75 years or older who present with high-risk PCa and/or with a PSA doubling time <12 months.

Proper treatment maximizes benefit and limits exposure to unnecessary measures. This report describes findings of the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a short, clinic-based decision aid and presents an in-depth clinical profile of the participants.  Methods:   This descriptive study used a prospective, quantitative approach to obtain the feasibility and acceptability of a decision aid (DecisionKEYS for Balancing Choices) for use in clinical settings. It combined results of trials of patients with three different common malignancies. All groups used the same decision aid series. Participants included 80 patients with solid tumors (22 with newly diagnosed breast cancer, 19 with advanced prostate cancer, and 39 with advanced lung cancer) and their 80 supporters as well as their physicians and nurses, for a total of 160 participants and 10 health professionals.  Results:   The decision aid was highly acceptable to patient and supporter participants in all diagnostic groups. It was feasible for use in clinic settings; the overall value was rated highly. Of six physicians, all found the interactive format with the help of the nurse as feasible and acceptable. Nurses also rated the decision aid favorably.  Conclusions:   This intervention provides the opportunity to enhance decision making about cancer treatment and warrants further study including larger and more diverse groups. Strengths of the study included a theoretical grounding, feasibility testing of a practical clinic-based intervention, and summative evaluation of acceptability of the intervention by patient and supporter pairs. Further research also is needed to test the effectiveness of the decision aid in diverse clinical settings and to determine if this intervention can decrease overall costs.""","""['Patricia J Hollen', 'Richard J Gralla', 'Randy A Jones', 'Christopher Y Thomas', 'David R Brenin', 'Geoffrey R Weiss', 'Anneke T Schroen', 'Gina R Petroni']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['A Decision Aid for Patients With Minimally Suspicious Screening Mammograms: A Pilot Study.', 'A Study to Assess the Feasibility of Implementing a Web-Based Decision Aid for Birth after Cesarean to Increase Opportunities for Shared Decision Making in Ethnically Diverse Settings.', 'Launching a virtual decision lab: development and field-testing of a web-based patient decision support research platform.', 'Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions.', 'Interventions for improving the adoption of shared decision making by healthcare professionals.', 'Implementation of a Novel Patient Decision Aid for Women with Elevated Breast Cancer Risk Who Are Considering MRI Screening: A Pilot Study.', 'Cancer, Fertility and Me: Developing and Testing a Novel Fertility Preservation Patient Decision Aid to Support Women at Risk of Losing Their Fertility Because of Cancer Treatment.', 'Employing a mobile health decision aid to improve decision-making for patients with advanced prostate cancer and their decision partners/proxies: the CHAMPION randomized controlled trial study design.', 'A Prospective Pilot Study Evaluating Feasibility and Preliminary Effects of Breathe Easier: A Mindfulness-based Intervention for Survivors of Lung Cancer and Their Family Members (Dyads).', 'Do Patients Regret Having Received Systemic Treatment for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Prospective Evaluation.']"""

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of mannitol infusion after pneumoperitoneum initiation on cerebral oxygen balance and quality of postoperative recovery in patients undergoing prolonged retroperitoneal laparoscopy.  Methods:   Forty patients scheduled for retroperitoneal laparoscopic radical excision of prostatic carcinoma were randomly divided into two groups (n = 20, each) to receive either 0.5 g/kg of 20% mannitol 150 min after the initiation of pneumoperitoneum or an equal volume of 0.9% normal saline. After surgery, time to extubation and recovery time were recorded. The Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale was used to assess the quality of recovery. The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) was given to test cognitive function preoperatively and at 1, 2, and 3 h after extubation. Blood samples from the jugular bulb and the radial artery were collected for blood gas analysis before CO2 insufflation and at 10, 60, and 180 min after insufflation.  Results:   In the control group (without mannitol), the difference between arterial and venous oxygen content (CaO2-CvO2) before insufflation (6.21 ± 2.58 mL/dL) was significantly greater than it was 3 h after insufflation (2.63 ± 1.29 mL/dL; p < 0.05). Furthermore, 3 h after insufflation, the CaO2-CvO2 also was higher in the group that had been administered mannitol (5.93 ± 1.98 mL/dL) than it was in the control group at that time (p < 0.05). Lactic acid in both arterial and jugular venous blood of the control group at 3 h postinsufflation (2.39 ± 0.89 and 2.51 ± 0.72 mg/dL, respectively) had increased significantly from the preinsufflation values (1.18 ± 0.82 and 1.1 ± 0.85 mg/dL). In the group that received mannitol, the lactic acid levels 3 h postinsufflation were essentially the same as the preinsufflation values. The recovery and extubation times in those receiving mannitol (12.19 ± 2.12 and 20.14 ± 3.62 min, respectively) were significantly shorter than in the control group (21.25 ± 3.61 and 28.79 ± 4.73 min; p < 0.05). The OAAS scores of the mannitol group at the time of extubation and 10 min afterward was significantly higher than these scores in the control group (p < 0.05). One hour and 2 h after extubation, the cognitive function score of the mannitol group was significantly higher than for the control group (p < 0.05).

Results:   Higher risk for lack of sexual satisfaction was associated with poor spousal health, a history of diabetes, and fatigue symptoms. In addition, being of male gender, being satisfied with marital support, and having better spousal health reduced the risk of being unsatisfied sexually. Also, higher risk for being unable to maintain the sexual relationship was independently associated with a higher education level, poorer self-rated health, better spousal health, a history of diabetes, prostate cancer, fatigue, sexual pain, and a history of depression.

We tested the efficacy of this simple procedure and analyzed the factors affecting the incidence of inguinal hernia. Of the 298 patients who underwent open RRP for clinically localized prostate cancer between February 2005 and March 2011 at Saitama Cancer Center hospital, 186 patients received the simple prophylactic procedure of inguinal hernia. We evaluated the risk factors of inguinal hernia (age, time of operation, intraoperative bleeding, prophylactic procedure of inguinal hernia, previous history of abdominal surgery, previous history of inguinal hernia surgery, nerve sparing, lymph node dissection, body-mass-index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, and smoking) by univariate and multivariate analysis. Effects of the simple prophylactic procedure on incidence of inguinal hernia were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots.

The pad-free and safety-pad (1 pad a day) rates after surgery were calculated with Kaplan-Meyer method. All preoperative and postoperative factors were not significantly different between the two groups. Overall, 88% of the patients in the RRP group were pad-free with a mean follow-up of 54 months and 93% of the patients in the RALP group were pad-free with a mean follow up of 22.1 months. However, the pad-free rates at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery were 33, 58.6 and 75.8%, respectively, in the RRP group compared to 44, 72 and 89.5% in the RALP group, respectively (p = 0.0393). Similarly, 97% of the patients in the RRP group and 98% of the patients in the RALP group used a safety-pad during the observation period. The rates of safety-pad at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery were 52.7, 71.6 and 81%, respectively, in the RRP group compared to 78.9,92 and 94.7% in the RALP group, respectively (p = 0.002). In conclusion, while the follow-period is short and the number of patients is small, RALP may provide a better functional outcome after surgery in terms of early recovery of urinary incontinence than RRP.

Fusion of the oncogenic ERG gene with the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 gene promoter results in expression of fusion mRNAs in prostate cancer cells. The junction of theTMPRSS2- and ERG-derived portions of the fusion mRNA constitutes a cancer-specific target in cells containing the T/E fusion gene. Targeting the most common alternatively spliced fusion gene mRNA junctional isoforms in vivo using siRNAs in liposomal nanovectors may potentially be a novel, low-toxicity treatment for prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   We designed and optimized siRNAs targeting the two most common T/E fusion gene mRNA junctional isoforms (type III or type VI). Specificity of siRNAs was assessed by transient co-transfection in vitro. To test their ability to inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells expressing these fusion gene isoforms in vivo, specific siRNAs in liposomal nanovectors were used to treat mice bearing orthotopic or subcutaneous xenograft tumors expressing the targeted fusion isoforms.  Results:   The targeting siRNAs were both potent and highly specific in vitro. In vivo they significantly inhibited tumor growth. The degree of growth inhibition was variable and was correlated with the extent of fusion gene knockdown. The growth inhibition was associated with marked inhibition of angiogenesis and, to a lesser degree, proliferation and a marked increase in apoptosis of tumor cells. No toxicity was observed.

However, the significance of the localization and the function of ERRs in uterine endometrial cancer remain unclear. We aimed to measure the expression of ERRγ and determine its association with the ER-mediated pathway in human endometrial cancer.  Methods:   Proliferation, luciferase, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were performed in ERα-positive (Ishikawa) and ERα-negative (HEC1A) endometrial cancer cell lines. The association between ERRγ and ERα expressions was determined by immunohistochemical analysis in uterine endometrial cancer tissues.  Results:   Estrogen-induced estrogen response element transcriptional activity was repressed by ERRγ in ERα-positive cells but was stimulated by ERRγ in ERα-negative cells. The stable overexpression of ERRγ regulated the in vitro cell growth in the ERα-positive and ERα-negative endometrial cancer cell lines. A selective ERRγ agonist, DY131, inhibited the growth of the ERα-positive endometrial cancer cells but promoted that of the ERα-negative cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that ERRγ is expressed in the nuclei of human uterine endometrial cancer tissues. Estrogen-related receptor γ was not associated with pathological parameters such as the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and histological type. The uterine endometrial cancer tissues with ERRγ-positive/ERα-negative status may have a significantly poor prognosis.

In this report, we show evidence that TRAF2- and RIPK1-mediated MAPK8/JNK activation is required for TNFSF10-induced cytoprotective autophagy. TNFSF10 activated autophagy rapidly in cancer cell lines derived from lung, bladder and prostate tumors. Blocking autophagy with either pharmacological inhibitors or siRNAs targeting the key autophagy factors BECN1/Beclin 1 or ATG7 effectively increased TNFSF10-induced apoptotic cytotoxicity, substantiating a cytoprotective role for TNFSF10-induced autophagy. Blocking MAPK8 but not NFκB effectively blocked autophagy, suggesting that MAPK8 is the main pathway for TNFSF10-induced autophagy. In addition, blocking MAPK8 effectively inhibited degradation of BCL2L1/Bcl-xL and reduction of the autophagy-suppressing BCL2L1-BECN1complex. Knockdown of TRAF2 or RIPK1 effectively suppressed TNFSF10-induced MAPK8 activation and autophagy. Furthermore, suppressing autophagy inhibited expression of antiapoptosis factors BIRC2/cIAP1, BIRC3/cIAP2, XIAP and CFLAR/c-FLIP and increased the formation of TNFSF10-induced death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). These results reveal a critical role for the MAPK8 activation pathway through TRAF2 and RIPK1 for TNFSF10-induced autophagy that blunts apoptosis in cancer cells.

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of medical records from patients who had undergone extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon at our institution between September 2008 and April 2011 was carried out. For each case, the following parameters were recorded: age, body mass index, prostate weight, cross-section area of the Retzius space, and history of previous lower abdominal surgery, repeated prostate biopsy and neoadjuvant hormone therapy. The laparoscopic radical prostatectomy procedure was divided into seven surgical steps: (i) port insertion and lymph node dissection; (ii) endopelvic fascia incision; (iii) dorsal vein complex ligation; (iv) prostate dissection from bladder neck; (v) dissection of seminal vesicles and vas deferens; (vi) prostate dissection from rectum; and (vii) vesicourethral anastomosis. The overall operative time and the duration of each surgical step were retrieved. Potential predictors of prolonged total operative time and prolonged duration of a step were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   A total of 152 patients were analyzed. High body mass index (≥25.0 kg/m(2) ) and prostate weight were independent predictors of prolonged total operative time. High body mass index was an independent predictor of prolonged step 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Prostate weight was an independent predictor of prolonged step 2, 5 and 6. A history of previous lower abdominal surgery was a predictor of prolonged step 1.  Conclusions:   High body mass index and high prostate weight are independent predictors of prolonged total operative time in extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.

However prostate biopsy performed under sonographical control using HMRS imaging registered in DICOM format is not precise enough because the layers of HMRS prostate imaging do not respond to sonographical view of the prostate. The method (MRIUSG) was performed to increase the efficiency of prostate imaging. MRIUSG reconstructs the MR picture in the level appointed by the transrectal USG. MRIUSG is based on linear interpolation of pixels with the sonographical prostate imaging obtained in real time to localize the changes and to perform the targeted prostate biopsy.

All of them undergone, with positive result, transrectal HMRS examinaton. All of them had trans-rectal core biopsy targeted at atypical suspicious findings in HMRS. Biopsies were performed on patients randomly divided into two groups. Group I in which HMRS positive foci were localized by use of MRI image only. Group II in which HMRS positive foci were localized by use of method of MRI images reconstruction and then transfering them to TRUS image (MRIUSG). Our method of localizing and transferring HMRS images to ultrasonography by images increases prostate cancer detection 22.5%, increase praecancerosus lesions detection by 10.0%, increase inflamatory changes detection 7.5% and eliminates almost 40% of falsely negative results. The probability of detecting cancer using MRIUSG about 3 times higher than in the method without image reconstruction. Method of reconstruction of images obtained in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, adequately measured, with marked lesions, and their comparison on a single computer screen with USG images obtained in real-time with the aim of localizing lesions and performing prostate targeted core biopsy enabled the detection of a greater number of prostate lesions in relation to biopsies performed without image reconstruction.""","""['Wacław Lipczyński']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Przegl Lek""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Prostate cancer detection using an extended prostate biopsy schema in combination with additional targeted cores from suspicious images in conventional and functional endorectal magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate.', 'Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of prostate voxels identified as suspicious of malignancy on three-dimensional (1)H MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with abnormal digital rectal examination or raised prostate specific antigen level of 4-10 ng/ml.', 'MRI for troubleshooting detection of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and imaging tools in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer, a review.']"""

We examined patient tissue of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) along with carcinomas of breast, lung, kidney, prostate and ovary. For in vitro studies, five established PDA cell lines classified as less (CSC(low)) and highly aggressive CSC-like cells (CSC(high)) were examined by single and double immunofluorescence microscopy, wound-, transwell-, and time-lapse microscopy. HIF-1α and Slug, as well as HIF-2α and CD133 were co-expressed pointing to a putative co-existence of hypoxia, EMT and CSCs in vivo. CSC(high) cells exhibited high basal expression of the mesenchymal Vimentin protein but low or absent expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, with the opposite result in CSC(low) cells. Hypoxia triggered altering of cell morphology from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype, which was more pronounced in CSC(high) cells. Concomitantly, E-cadherin expression was reduced and expression of Vimentin, Slug, Twist2 and Zeb1 enhanced. While hypoxia caused migration in all cell lines, velocity along with the percentage of migrating, polarized and pseudopodia-forming cells was significantly higher in CSC(high) cells. These data indicate that hypoxia-induced EMT occurs in PDA and several other tumor entities.

In this study, underlying mechanisms of the virus-mediated metastases reduction were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that virus-treatment resulted in a drastically decrease of blood and lymph vessels, representing essential routes for PC-3 cell migration, in both tumors and metastases. Thus, GLV-1h68 drastically reduced essential routes for the metastatic spread of PC-3 cells. Furthermore, analysis of viral distribution in GLV-1h68-injected tumor-bearing mice by plaque assays, revealed significantly higher virus titers in metastases compared to solid tumors. To elucidate conditions potentially mediating the preferential viral colonization and eradication of metastases, microenvironmental components of uninfected tumors and metastases were compared by microscopic studies. These analyses revealed that PC-3 lymph node metastases showed increased vascular permeability, higher proliferation status of tumor cells as determined by BrdU- and Ki-67 assays and lesser necrosis of PC-3 cells than solid tumors. Moreover, an increased number of immune cells (MHCII(+)/CD68(+) macrophages, MHCII(+)/CD19(+) B lymphocytes) combined with an up-regulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in metastases in comparison to primary PC-3 tumors. We propose that these microenvironmental components mediated the metastatic tropism of GLV-1h68.

We have previously shown that the downregulation of Orai1 protein representing the major molecular component of endogenous SOCE in human prostate cancer cells, and constituting the principal source of Ca(2+) influx used by the cell to trigger apoptosis, contributes to the establishment of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype (Cell Death Dis. 2010 Sep 16;1:e75.). Here, we report for the first time that the decrease of SOCE during NED may be caused by alternative NED-induced mechanism involving cytoskeleton reorganisation. NED induced by androgen deprivation resulted in a decrease of SOCE due to cortical F-actin over-polymerization which inhibits thapsigargin-induced SOCE. The disruption of F-actin polymerization by Cytochalasin D in NED cells restored SOCE, while the induction of F-actin polymerization by jasplakinolide or calyculin A diminished SOCE without changing the expression of key SOCE players: Orai1, STIM1, and TRPC1.

However, available evidence on prostate cancer (PCa) is conflicting. We therefore examined the association between statin use and risk of PCa by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of all observational studies published regarding this subject.  Methods:   Literature search in PubMed database was undertaken through February 2012 looking for observational studies evaluating the association between statin use and risk of PCa. Before meta-analysis, the studies were evaluated for publication bias and heterogeneity. Pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird method). Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis were also performed.  Results:   A total of 27 (15 cohort and 12 case-control) studies contributed to the analysis. There was heterogeneity among the studies but no publication bias. Statin use significantly reduced the risk of both total PCa by 7% (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.99, p = 0.03) and clinically important advanced PCa by 20% (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.90, p<0.001). Long-term statin use did not significantly affect the risk of total PCa (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84-1.05, p = 0.31). Stratification by study design did not substantially influence the RR. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of results. Cumulative meta-analysis showed a change in trend of reporting risk from positive to negative in statin users between 1993 and 2011.  Conclusions:   Our meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of both total PCa and clinically important advanced PCa.

Inhibition of its function has therefore been an important strategy for inhibiting tumor cell growth in cancer therapy. Previous efforts to achieve this goal have used peptides that bind to GRP78/BiP conjugated to pro-drugs or cell-death-inducing sequences. Here, we describe a peptide that induces prostate tumor cell death without the need of any conjugating sequences. This peptide is a sequence derived from the cochaperone Bag-1. We have shown that this sequence interacts with and inhibits the refolding activity of GRP78/BiP. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that it modulates the unfolded protein response in ER stress resulting in PARP and caspase-4 cleavage. Prostate cancer cells stably expressing this peptide showed reduced growth and increased apoptosis in in vivo xenograft tumor models.

The simulated TRUS images reflect the volumetric tissue deformation and comprise validated appearance models for the needle and implanted seeds. Rendered haptic forces use validated models for needle shaft flexure and friction, tip cutting, and deflection due to bevel. This paper also presents additional new features that make the simulator complete, in the sense that all aspects of the brachytherapy procedure as practiced at many cancer centers are simulated, including simulations of seed unloading, fluoroscopy imaging, and transversal/sagittal TRUS plane switching. For real-time rendering, methods for fast TRUS-needle-seed image formation are presented. In addition, the simulator computes real-time dosimetry, allowing a trainee to immediately see the consequence of planning changes.

However, emerging fluoroquinolone resistance has led to increased frequency and morbidity due to post-TGB infections. Following TGB, 2.15%-3.6% of patients are readmitted with infective complications. We estimate readmissions result in 25,745-37,062 bed days at an annual cost of £ 7.7-11.1 million in England and Wales. Clearly, an increase in post-TGB infections with resistant organisms has a profound clinical and economic impact. We suggest alternative approaches to prophylaxis to reduce post-TGB infections. These include prophylaxis based on local antibiotic resistance surveillance and targeted prophylaxis based on antibiograms of coliforms detected in pre-biopsy rectal swabs. Other strategies include selective prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and the use of biomarkers like prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) to reduce the number of TGBs.

Objective:   The objective of this study was to describe relationships between mitochondria-related gene expression changes and self-reported fatigue in prostate cancer patients receiving external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).  Methods:   A prospective, exploratory, and repeated-measures design was used. Self-report questionnaires and peripheral whole-blood samples were collected from 15 patients at 7 time points. Baseline data were compared against 15 healthy controls. The Human Mitochondria RT Profiler PCR Array was used to identify differential regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function.  Results:   Compared with baseline, there were significant increases in fatigue scores (P = .02-.04) and changes in mitochondria-related gene expression (P = .001-.05) over time. Mean fatigue scores were 1.66 (SD, 1.66) at baseline, 3.06 (SD, 1.95) at EBRT midpoint, 2.98 (SD, 2.20) at EBRT completion, and 2.64 (SD, 2.56) at 30 days after EBRT. Over time, 11 genes related to mitochondrial function and structure were differentially expressed. Of these 11 genes, 3 (BCL2L1, FIS1, SLC25A37) were more than 2.5 fold up-regulated, and 8 (AIFM2, BCL2, IMMP2L, MIPEP, MSTO1, NEFL, SLC25A23, SLC25A4) were greater than 2-fold down-regulated.

High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is a pre-malignant lesion to prostate cancer and is associated with 20%-25% risk of prostate cancer in subsequent repeat biopsies. ERG is a highly prostate-cancer-specific marker. Expression of ERG is rare in isolated high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia diagnosed in prostate biopsy and is not associated with cancer risk in subsequent repeat biopsies.  Objectives:   • To evaluate how often ERG, a highly prostate-cancer-specific marker, is expressed in isolated high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) by immunohistochemistry. • To study whether a positive ERG immunostain in HGPIN correlates with prostate cancer (PCa) detection in subsequent repeat biopsies.  Patients and methods:   • Patients with initial HGPIN in biopsies and at least one follow-up prostate biopsy were included. • Biopsies with HGPIN were immunostained for ERG. • The ERG staining results were then correlated with the PCa risk in subsequent biopsies.  Results:   • The mean age of 94 patients was 63 years (range 48-78). A mean of 1.8 (range 1-5) repeat biopsy sessions were carried out at a mean interval of 27.4 months (range 1.5-140). The repeat biopsies showed PCa and non-cancer lesions (benign, HGPIN, atypical glands suspicious for cancer) in 36 patients (38%) and 58 patients (62%) respectively. • ERG immunostain was positive in five (5.3%) biopsies with HGPIN, in which PCa was found in two (40%) subsequent biopsies. Of 89 biopsies with negative ERG staining, PCa was found in 34 (38%) repeat biopsies. The cancer detection rate was not different between ERG positive and negative cases (P= 0.299).  Conclusions:   • This is the first study to investigate the ERG protein expression in prostate biopsy containing HGPIN only and its use to stratify the cancer risk associated with HGPIN. We found that ERG expression is distinctly uncommon in isolated HGPIN (5.3%). • Positive ERG expression is not associated with increased cancer detection in subsequent repeat biopsies.

The role of circulating cancer cells in metastogenesis is generally accepted. Two forms of these cells have been reported in a number of studies, cancer cell clusters (CCCs) and individual epithelial cancer cells. Clusters appear at higher frequencies in the blood. CCCs have been reported to be rich in vimentin and poor in E-cadherin expression The resulting epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a prerequisite for metastasis formation, occurs in CCCs. We have developed a new set of biomarkers, namely the antioxidant genes GPX1, SOD2 and TXNRD1, specific to cell trafficking in the blood. Firstly, the study shows that diagnosis of distant metastases is feasible by applying molecular phenotyping with a five gene test that has 94% sensitivity and 81% accuracy. Again SOD2 and GPX1 showed the highest sensitivities. Secondly, the study shows the efficacy of palliative chemotherapy in clearing the blood of CCCs overexpressing diagnostic genes. Clinically the overall lifespan ranged from 5 to 99 months under taxotere. We aimed to investigate the molecular reasons and found that MDR1 overexpression worsened survival by 31%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show the clinical impact of drug targeting and the counter-effect of drug resistance in CCCs on overall survival. The findings may, therefore, add a novel tool for clinicians in tailoring therapies individually.  Objectives:   • To find the molecular phenotype in circulating cancer cells from patients with prostate cancer (PCa) in order to predict distant metastases. • To determine genes affecting the study endpoints of overall survival and time to progression.  Patients and methods:   • Twenty-five urologists in several clinics participated in the study, with 51 patients with metastatic and 77 with non-metastatic PCa. • Molecular analysis was carried out in two forms of circulating cancer cells, cancer cell clusters (CCCs) and individual epithelial cancer cells (CECs). • Gene expression was studied using real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. • Cycle threshold values were normalized with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in cancer cells and mononucleated cells, yielding comparative specific expression values from the relative quantification method with the help of the standard curve method for each patient and each gene locus.  Results:   • Preclinical validation was performed using aggregated and non-aggregated SW480 cells showing the independence of CCCs and CECs. • Prediction of metastases was achieved with five genes showing the highest sensitivity, SOD2, GPX1, AR, cyclin B and bFGF. • The following results were obtained: 94% sensitivity, 65% specificity, 76% positive predictive value and 89% negative predictive value. The prevalence was 63%. Test accuracy was 81% with an odds ratio of 32 (P < 0.001). • Overall survival was worsened by preceding chemotherapies when leaving insufficient GPX1 clearance in blood. • Drug resistance genes were found to worsen the endpoints, among them MDR1 (P = 0.003; hazard ratio: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.09-1.58).  Conclusions:   • SOD2, GPX1 and AR represent a novel biomarker set for circulating cancer cells (clusters and scattered individual cells) in PCa. • The clinical usefulness of these biomarkers ranges from the prediction of clinical tumours to disease prognostication, therapy monitoring and therapy outcome prediction (hormonal therapies, chemotherapies). • The presence of CCCs and CECs after batch isolation allows the addition of genes for intensive studies, e.g. drug resistance.""","""['Michael Giesing', 'Gerhard Driesel', 'Dietmar Molitor', 'Bernhard Suchy']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Clinical utility of antioxidant gene expression levels in circulating cancer cell clusters for the detection of prostate cancer in patients with prostate-specific antigen levels of 4-10 ng/mL and disease prognostication after radical prostatectomy.', 'Immunomagnetic quantification of circulating tumor cells as a prognostic factor of androgen deprivation responsiveness in patients with hormone naive metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Association of circulating tumor cells with tumor-related methylated DNA in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Circulating tumour cells: insights into tumour heterogeneity.', 'Circulating tumor cells as therapy-related biomarkers in cancer patients.', 'Circulating tumour cells for early detection of clinically relevant cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells as a Marker of Disseminated Disease in Patients with Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'HCRP-1 regulates cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis via Src/ FAK signaling in human prostate cancer.', 'Research landscape of liquid biopsies in prostate cancer.', 'Influence of the HDAC Inhibitor Valproic Acid on the Growth and Proliferation of Temsirolimus-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro.']"""

While the frequencies and severity of late toxicities following prostate brachytherapy are well known, less has been published with regard to time to first onset. Several series with limited median follow-up have published time to onset. An extensive analysis of timing to late toxicity following brachytherapy for cervical cancer has also been published. This study is the largest of its kind with the longest median follow-up to capture very late events. It can provide a basis for physician and patient education about when late toxicities can reasonably be expected to occur. The study also shows that a significant amount of erectile dysfunction might be more age related than radiation induced.  Objectives:   • To assess the timing of first onset of late rectal bleeding, late haematuria and erectile dysfunction (ED) following brachytherapy with or without external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for prostate adenocarcinoma. • To identify treatment factors and patient characteristics that affect the time to first onset.  Patients and methods:   • In all, 2046 patients were definitively treated for prostate adenocarcinoma with a full (125) I or (103) Pd implant or a partial (103) Pd implant followed by EBRT with 6 years median follow-up (range 2-17 years). • Patients were selected for an event of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or greater rectal bleeding, ≥RTOG grade 2 haematuria, or a drop in the Mount Sinai Erectile Dysfunction Score from potent to impotent (excluding patients who received androgen deprivation therapy). • Life tables were generated to calculate actuarial incidence rates of toxicity. • Wilcoxon rank sum and Cox regression were utilized to identify treatment factors affecting time to onset.  Results:   • The incidence rate per 1000 patients for 0-2 years, 2-5 years and 5-10 years following radiation for rectal bleeding is 14.3, 15.9 and 6.5, respectively; for haematuria, 14.0, 8.2 and 1.3, respectively; and for ED, 82.4, 48.2 and 42.2, respectively. • Just 5% of rectal bleeding occurs after 5 years from radiation vs 18% of haematuria cases and 22% of ED. • On multivariate analysis, time to first onset of rectal bleeding was affected by the addition of EBRT only whereas the time to onset of haematuria was affected by the biological effective dose of the radiation and the addition of EBRT. • The only factor on multivariate analysis to affect time to onset of ED was the age of the patient at treatment, independent of radiation dose or technique.  Conclusions:   • Unique temporality to first onset of selected toxicities was observed in patients after radioactive implant for prostate adenocarcinoma with or without EBRT. • Clinicians and patients should be counselled when to expect late toxicities. • The only factor to affect time to onset of ED is the age of the patient, suggesting possible over-reporting of radiation-induced ED in the light of normal age-related events.""","""['Michael Buckstein', 'Sarah Kerns', 'Kevin Forysthe', 'Nelson N Stone', 'Richard G Stock']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Long-term potency preservation following brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Combined brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: reduced morbidity with an intraoperative brachytherapy planning technique and supplemental intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Functional outcomes and complications following radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'Prediction models for brachytherapy-induced rectal toxicity in patients with locally advanced pelvic cancers: a systematic review.', 'Does supplemental external beam radiation therapy impact urinary, bowel, and erectile function following permanent prostate brachytherapy?: results of two prospective randomized trials.', 'Long-Term Endoscopic Follow-Up of Patients with Chronic Radiation Proctopathy after Brachytherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Influence of body mass index and periprostatic fat on rectal dosimetry in permanent seed prostate brachytherapy.']"""

Our previous studies have shown that the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) induces apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells by a syndecan-1 (SDC-1)-dependent mechanism. Here, we examined the contribution of lipoxygenase (LOX)- and cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated DHA metabolism to this effect. Pan-LOX inhibitor (nordihydroguaiaretic acid), 15-LOX inhibitor (luteolin) or 15/12-LOX inhibitor (baicalein) blocked the induced effect of DHA on SDC-1 expression and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells, whereas 5-LOX inhibitor, AA861, was ineffective. Human prostate cancer cells lines (PC3, LNCaP and DU145 cells) expressed two 15-LOX isoforms, 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2, with higher 15-LOX-1 and lower 15-LOX-2 expressions compared with human epithelial prostate cells. Knockdown of 15-LOX-1 blocked the effect of DHA on SDC-1 expression and caspase-3 activity, whereas silencing 15-LOX-2, 5-LOX, COX-1, COX-2 or 12-LOX had no effect. Moreover, the ability of DHA to inhibit the activity of the PDK/Akt (T308) signaling pathway was abrogated by silencing 15-LOX-1. These findings demonstrate that 15-LOX-1-mediated metabolism of DHA is required for it to upregulate SDC-1 and trigger the signaling pathway that elicits apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Yunping Hu', 'Haiguo Sun', ""Joseph T O'Flaherty"", 'Iris J Edwards']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Syndecan-1-dependent suppression of PDK1/Akt/bad signaling by docosahexaenoic acid induces apoptosis in prostate cancer.', '15-lipoxygenase metabolites of docosahexaenoic acid inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival.', 'Omega-3 fatty acids induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells and mouse mammary tissue through syndecan-1 inhibition of the MEK-Erk pathway.', 'Fatty acid oxidation and signaling in apoptosis.', 'The two faces of the 15-lipoxygenase in atherosclerosis.', 'Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase type B: Regulation, function, and its role in pathophysiology.', 'Resolvin D1 and D2 inhibit tumour growth and inflammation via modulating macrophage polarization.', 'Stylosin and some of its synthetic derivatives induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells as 15-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitors.', '12-HETE facilitates cell survival by activating the integrin-linked kinase/NF-κB pathway in ovarian cancer.', 'Emerging role of 12/15-Lipoxygenase (ALOX15) in human pathologies.']"""

We have shown previously that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adduct levels in prostate cancer cases vary by cellular histology and that higher adduct levels are associated with biochemical recurrence. A nested case-control study was conducted in a historical cohort of 6692 men with histopathologically benign prostate specimens. PAH-DNA adduct levels were determined by immunohistochemistry in benign prostate specimens from 536 prostate cancer case-control pairs (59% White and 41% African American). We estimated the overall and race-stratified risk of subsequent prostate cancer associated with higher adduct levels. Prostate cancer risk for men with elevated adduct levels (defined as greater than control group median) was slightly increased [odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.98-1.67, P = 0.07].

However, Rad9 can act as a sequence-specific transcription factor, modulating expression of a number of genes. Importantly, Rad9 is up-regulated in prostate cancer cell lines and clinical specimens. Its expression correlates positively with advanced stage tumors and its down-regulation reduces tumor burden in mice. We show here that transient down-regulation of Rad9 by RNA interference reduces DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival in vitro. In addition, transient or stable down-regulation of Rad9 impairs migration and invasion of the cells. Moreover, stable reduction of Rad9 renders DU145 cell growth anchorage-dependent. It also decreases expression of integrin β1 protein and sensitizes DU145 and LNCaP cells to anoikis and impairs Akt activation. On the other hand, stable expression of Mrad9, the mouse homolog, in DU145/shRNA Rad9 cells restores migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth, integrin β1 expression, and anoikis resistance with a concomitant elevation of Akt activation. We thus demonstrate for the first time that Rad9 contributes to prostate tumorigenesis by increasing not only tumor proliferation and survival but also tumor migration and invasion, anoikis resistance, and anchorage-independent growth.""","""['Constantinos G Broustas', 'Aiping Zhu', 'Howard B Lieberman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['RAD9 enhances radioresistance of human prostate cancer cells through regulation of ITGB1 protein levels.', 'FOXP1 and NDRG1 act differentially as downstream effectors of RAD9-mediated prostate cancer cell functions.', 'Regulation of NEIL1 protein abundance by RAD9 is important for efficient base excision repair.', 'Contributions of Rad9 to tumorigenesis.', 'The role of RAD9 in tumorigenesis.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase: A novel vital oncogene or tumor suppressor gene in cancers.', 'Effect of AKT silence on malignant biological behavior of renal cell carcinoma cells.', 'HUS1 as a Potential Therapeutic Target in Urothelial Cancer.', 'Hypermethylation of RAD9A intron 2 in childhood cancer patients, leukemia and tumor cell lines suggest a role for oncogenic transformation.']"""

Such an effect would have considerable implications in terms of understanding tumor biology. To evaluate if long-term VKA treatment influences the risk of developing cancer, we performed a matched case-control analysis. We used data from four Danish nationwide registers. Cases were all Danish individuals with a first-time cancer diagnosis (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) between 2000 and 2009. For each case, eight controls, matched by birth year and gender, were selected from the source population by risk-set sampling. Long-term VKA use was defined as exposure to VKA for a period of 3 or more years. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (ORs) for cancer associated with long-term VKA exposure, adjusting for potential confounders. Prespecified subanalyses were performed for selected cancer sites, subgroups and measures of exposure. A total of 238,196 cases and 1,713,176 controls were included. The adjusted OR for cancer associated with long-term VKA exposure was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.95-1.02). Long-term VKA use was associated with increased ORs for alcohol- or obesity-related cancer sites, whereas we observed a decreased risk of prostate cancer (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78-0.95).

Guidelines recommend bone density testing before and during ADT to characterize fracture risk. The authors of the current report assessed bone density testing among men who received ADT for ≥ 1 year.  Methods:   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results/Medicare data were used to identify 28,960 men aged > 65 years with local/regional prostate cancer diagnosed from 2001 to 2007 who were followed through 2009 and who received ≥ 1 year of continuous ADT. Bone density testing was documented in the 18-month period beginning 6 months before ADT initiation. Logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with bone density testing.  Results:   Among men who received ≥ 1 year of ADT, 10.2% had a bone density assessment from 6 months before starting ADT through 1 year after. Bone density testing increased over time (14.5% of men who initiated ADT in 2007-2008 vs 6% of men who initiated ADT in 2001-2002; odds ratio for 2007-2008 vs 2001-2002, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.83-2.85). Less bone density testing was observed among men aged ≥ 85 years versus men ages 66 to 69 years (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.89), among black men versus white men (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.86), and among men in areas with lower educational attainment (P < .001). Men who visited a medical oncologist and/or a primary care provider in addition to a urologist had higher odds of testing than men who only consulted a urologist (P < .001).  Conclusions:   Few men who received ADT for prostate cancer underwent bone density testing, particularly older men, black men, and those living in areas with low educational attainment. Visiting a medical oncologist was associated with increased odds of testing. Interventions are needed to increase bone density testing among men who receive long-term ADT. Data on bone density testing for nonmilitary populations of prostate cancer survivors in the United States who have received long-term androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) have not been published. The current analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results/Medicare data suggests that few prostate cancer survivors who receive long-term ADT undergo bone density testing; and several key populations, including African Americans and older men, have considerably lower rates of bone density screening.""","""['Alicia K Morgans', 'Matthew R Smith', ""A James O'Malley"", 'Nancy L Keating']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Association of Bone Mineral Density Testing With Risk of Major Osteoporotic Fractures Among Older Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy to Treat Localized or Regional Prostate Cancer.', 'Patterns of bone mineral density testing in men receiving androgen deprivation for prostate cancer.', 'Fracture after androgen deprivation therapy among men with a high baseline risk of skeletal complications.', 'Osteoporosis in men with prostate carcinoma receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: recommendations for diagnosis and therapies.', 'Bone and metabolic health in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Implementing and Evaluating the Impact of BoneRx: A Healthy Bone Prescription for Men with Prostate Cancer Initiating Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Association of Bone Mineral Density Testing With Risk of Major Osteoporotic Fractures Among Older Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy to Treat Localized or Regional Prostate Cancer.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Follow-Up of Patients with Prostate Cancer with Bone Metastases Who Had Reduced Bone Density after Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Osteoclast inhibitor treatment among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The implications of baseline bone-health assessment at initiation of androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

According to the acceptance and exclusion criteria, 15 studies involved three polymorphisms (rs266729, rs2241766, rs1501299) of ADIPOQ were included. Summary odds ratio (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effect or fixed-effect models based on the heterogeneity of included studies. A total of 15 case-control studies related rs266729 (5,615 cases and 6,425 controls), rs2241766 (5,318 cases and 6,118 controls) and rs1501299 (3,751 cases and 5,104 controls) were included to analyze the ADIPOQ polymorphisms and cancer risk. For rs1501299, T allele was associated with decreased cancer risk. In addition, cancer type subgroup analysis revealed T allele was associated with decreased colorectal and prostate cancer risk.

Pomegranate juice (PJ) and three of its specific components have been shown to inhibit processes involved in prostate cancer metastasis. If this also proves to be true for breast cancer, these natural treatments will be promising agents against breast cancer that can serve as potentially effective and nontoxic alternatives or adjuncts to the use of conventional selective estrogen receptor modulators for breast cancer prevention and treatment. To test this possibility, we have used two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 cells (ER(-)) and MCF7 (ER(+)), and the non-neoplastic cell line MCF10A. We show that, in addition to inhibiting growth of the breast cancer cells, PJ or a combination of its components luteolin (L) + ellagic acid (E) + punicic acid (P) increase cancer cell adhesion and decrease cancer cell migration but do not affect normal cells. These treatments also inhibit chemotaxis of the cancer cells to SDF1α, a chemokine that attracts breast cancer cells to the bone. We hypothesized that PJ and L + E + P stimulate expression of genes that increase adhesion and inhibit genes that stimulate cell migration and inhibit chemotaxis to SDF1α. Using qPCR, we confirmed these proposed effects on gene expression and in addition we found that a gene important in epithelial-to-meshenchymal transitions is decreased. We also found that pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines are significantly reduced by these treatments, thereby having the potential to decrease inflammation and its impact on cancer progression. Discovery that PJ and L + E + P are inhibitory of metastatic processes in breast cancer cells in addition to prostate cancer cells indicate that they are potentially a very effective treatment to prevent cancer progression in general.""","""['Ana Rocha', 'Lei Wang', 'Manuel Penichet', 'Manuela Martins-Green']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pomegranate juice-induced anti-metastatic effect on prostate cancer cells.', 'Luteolin, ellagic acid and punicic acid are natural products that inhibit prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Luteolin exerts anti-tumor activity through the suppression of epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated pathway in MDA-MB-231 ER-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Pomegranate and breast cancer: possible mechanisms of prevention.', 'Ellagic acid, pomegranate and prostate cancer -- a mini review.', 'Pomegranate-specific natural compounds as onco-preventive and onco-therapeutic compounds: Comparison with conventional drugs acting on the same molecular mechanisms.', 'The Therapeutic Alliance between Pomegranate and Health Emphasizing on Anticancer Properties.', 'Pomegranate Pomace Extract with Antioxidant, Anticancer, Antimicrobial, and Antiviral Activity Enhances the Quality of Strawberry-Yogurt Smoothie.', 'Polyphenolic extract from Punica granatum peel causes cytoskeleton-related damage on Giardia lamblia trophozoites in vitro.', 'Possible Beneficial Effects of Fresh Pomegranate Juice in SARS-CoV-2 Infection Conditions.']"""

Recently, a rare, recurrent mutation (G84E) in HOXB13 was reported to be associated with prostate cancer risk. Confirmation and characterization of this finding is necessary to potentially translate this information to the clinic. To examine this finding in a large international sample of prostate cancer families, we genotyped this mutation and 14 other SNPs in or flanking HOXB13 in 2,443 prostate cancer families recruited by the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). At least one mutation carrier was found in 112 prostate cancer families (4.6 %), all of European descent. Within carrier families, the G84E mutation was more common in men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer (194 of 382, 51 %) than those without (42 of 137, 30 %), P = 9.9 × 10(-8) [odds ratio 4.42 (95 % confidence interval 2.56-7.64)]. A family-based association test found G84E to be significantly over-transmitted from parents to affected offspring (P = 6.5 × 10(-6)). Analysis of markers flanking the G84E mutation indicates that it resides in the same haplotype in 95 % of carriers, consistent with a founder effect. Clinical characteristics of cancers in mutation carriers included features of high-risk disease. These findings demonstrate that the HOXB13 G84E mutation is present in ~5 % of prostate cancer families, predominantly of European descent, and confirm its association with prostate cancer risk.

Material and methods:   A questionnaire was developed to investigate several topics related to prostate cancer biopsies and four different clinical situations were explored separately, depending on whether the urologist intended a curative or palliative treatment.  Results:   A total of 95 out of 282 (33 %) urologists responded to the questionnaire and returned anonymous responses. On average the participants had a professional career of 13 years (range 6 months to 38 years), 22 (23 %) urologists performed radical prostatectomy, 73 (77 %) were not surgically active, 55 (58 %) took 10-12 scores within the framework of the proposed first biopsy setting, 32 (34 %) took 6-8 scores and 6 (6 %) > 12 scores. Urologists with a professional career <15 years took significantly more biopsies. The primary and secondary Gleason patterns were required for only 36 (38 %) respondents to make treatment decisions. In prostate needle biopsies containing only a single focus of prostate cancer only 44 (48 %) of the respondents would request a Gleason score if not provided in the initial report. In addition to the Gleason score other information used by urologists to make treatment decisions included perineural invasion (60 %), periprostatic infiltration (57 %), extraprostatic spread (57 %) and the percentage of core involvement by cancer (13 %). Interestingly, in biopsies with multiple positive cores from separate locations 84 out of 95 urologists (88 %) used the highest Gleason grade to determine the treatment plan. The term atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) was uniformly considered sufficient to retake biopsies by 44 % (42/92) of urologists and only 53 % (49/92) of urologists performed rebiopsies in the case of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN).  Conclusion:   In this sample of 95 urologists there was high variability in the way clinicians used prostate needle biopsy pathology reports.

We examined the expression of ETS-1 using immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded prostate carcinoma tissue obtained by needle biopsy from 69 mostly advanced PCa patients. ETS-1 expression was compared with the clinicopathological characteristics of the 69 patients, including 25 who underwent ADT as a primary treatment. As a result, PCa patients with higher expression of ETS-1 were significantly more likely to be of high stage and high Gleason score (P<0.05). There was no significant association between ETS-1 expression and the initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. In the 25 patients treated by ADT, the staining score for ETS-1 was significantly associated with rapid development of castration-resistant disease within 24 months (P<0.05), whereas the Gleason score and PSA level were not. In conclusion, increased ETS-1 expression was associated with a higher stage, higher Gleason score and shorter time to castration-resistant progression.

Pearson's Chi square and McNemar tests at two degrees of freedom with level of significance set at 0.05 ( P <0.005) were used to determine the statistical significance.  Results:   The overall cancer detection rate of 10-core prostate biopsy was 48.8%. Of all positive biopsies, the sextant biopsy protocol detected 52 cancers (85.2%) while the lateral biopsy protocol detected 58 cases (95.1%).

Materials and methods:   A total of 182 men with a lesion suspicious for cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging underwent transperineal magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy using a cognitive registration technique, followed by systematic transperineal template guided prostate biopsy. The primary outcome was the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer. Clinical significance was defined using maximum cancer core length 4 mm or greater and/or Gleason grade 3 + 4 or greater (University College London definition 2). We secondarily evaluated other commonly used thresholds of clinically significant disease, including maximum cancer core length 6 mm or greater and/or Gleason grade 4 + 3 or greater, maximum cancer core length 3 mm or greater and/or Gleason grade 3 + 4 or greater, and maximum cancer core length 2 or greater mm and/or Gleason grade 3 + 4 or greater. Strategies were statistically compared with the McNemar test.  Results:   Mean ± SD patient age was 63.3 ± 7.2 years. Median prostate specific antigen was 6.7 ng/ml (IQR 4.7-10.0). Clinically significant cancer was detected by magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy and template guided prostate biopsy in 103 (57%) and 113 of the 182 men (62%) (p = 0.174), and clinically insignificant cancer was detected in 17 (9.3%) and 31 (17.0%), respectively (p = 0.024).  Conclusions:   Prostate biopsy targeted to suspicious lesions on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging has encouraging rates of detection of clinically significant cancer while also decreasing the detection rate of clinically insignificant cancer. This is achieved with fewer biopsy cores than for systematic template guided biopsy. Further prospective, multicenter, comparative trials of the performance of targeting strategies are needed to consider magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy an alternative to conventional systematic biopsy.""","""['Veeru Kasivisvanathan', 'Robert Dufour', 'Caroline M Moore', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Mohamed Abd-Alazeez', 'Susan C Charman', 'Alex Freeman', 'Clare Allen', 'Alex Kirkham', 'Jan van der Meulen', 'Mark Emberton']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Words of wisdom: re: transperineal magnetic resonance image targeted prostate biopsy versus transperineal template prostate biopsy in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Accuracy of Transperineal Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Visual Estimation and Image Fusion in Men Needing Repeat Biopsy in the PICTURE Trial.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Fusion Guided Targeted Biopsy Evaluated by Transperineal Template Saturation Prostate Biopsy for the Detection and Characterization of Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy to Transperineal Template Mapping Biopsies Stratified by Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score in the PROMIS Trial.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Optimization of initial prostate biopsy in clinical practice: sampling, labeling and specimen processing.', 'Combination of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transperineal template-guided mapping prostate biopsy to determine potential candidates for focal therapy.', 'Protocol of a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing transperineal prostate biopsy to reduce infectiouscomplications.', 'Clinical value of minimum apparent diffusion coefficient for prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zone.', 'Systematic or targeted fusion-guided biopsy.', 'Effect of Focal vs Extended Irreversible Electroporation for the Ablation of Localized Low- or Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer on Early Oncological Control: A Randomized Clinical Trial.']"""

Materials and methods:   The study included 3,077 men participating in the 2005-2006 or 2007-2008 cycles of the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) who were 40 years old or older and without a history of prostate cancer. Men were considered to have lower urinary tract symptoms if they reported nocturia, urinary hesitancy and/or incomplete bladder emptying. Bowel habits were characterized by frequency of bowel movements per week and stool consistency based on the Bristol Stool Form Scale. Weighted associations between bowel habits and lower urinary tract symptoms were determined using univariate and multivariate techniques, adjusting for age, race, body mass index, diabetes, alcohol intake, activity level and smoking.  Results:   The prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms was 37%, with 4% reporting all 3 symptoms. Reporting 3 or fewer bowel movements per week was associated with nocturia (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.21-2.30), incomplete bladder emptying (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.06-4.31) and urinary hesitancy (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.06-4.02). Reporting more than 10 bowel movements per week was associated with nocturia only (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01-1.55). Hard (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.31-2.37) and loose (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.55) stool consistency increased the odds of reporting nocturia.

Though IDO is physiologically important in maintaining tissue integrity, aberrant IDO expression represses T cell function and promotes regulatory T cells (Treg) in cancer. It additionally exacerbates Alzheimer, depression, Huntington and Parkinson diseases via quinolinic acid. Inhibition of IDO has thus been recently proposed as a strategy for treating cancer and neuronal disorders. In the present study, we have developed a cell-based assay to evaluate the suppressive effect of anti-inflammatory phytochemicals on the enzyme. When stimulated by INF-γ, profound high expressions of IDO-1 mRNA as well as the protein were detected in human neural stem cells (hNSC) and verified by real-time retro-transcribed PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The protein activity was measured by kynurenine concentration and the assay was validated by dose-responsive inhibition of IDO-1 antagonists including 1-methyltryptaphan, indomethacin and acetylsalicylic acid. Among the tested compounds, apigenin, baicalein, chrysin, and wogonin exhibit a potent repressive activity with IC(50s) comparable to that of indomethacin. The inhibition was further found to be independent of gene expression and protein translation because of the unaltered levels of mRNA and protein expression. Although curcumin displayed a potent inhibitory activity to the enzyme, it appeared to be cytotoxic to hNSCs. Morphological examination of hNSC revealed that baicalein and wogonin at the inhibitory concentrations induced neurite outgrowth. In conclusion, our data shows that certain phytochemicals with 2-phenyl-1-benzopyran-4-one backbone (flavones) attenuate significantly the IDO-1 protein activity without harming hNSCs. The inhibitory activity might have partially contributed to the anti-cancer and neuro-protective property of the compounds.""","""['S Chen', 'R Corteling', 'L Stevanato', 'J Sinden']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Synergistic antitumor effect with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibition and temozolomide in a murine glioma model.', 'Polyphenols inhibit indoleamine 3,5-dioxygenase-1 enzymatic activity--a role of immunomodulation in chemoprevention.', 'Effect of Kidney-replenishing herb on the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase of human syncytiotrophoblasts cultured in vitro and the balance of helper T-cell cytokines.', 'Biochemical properties of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase: from structure to optimized design of inhibitors.', 'Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2; a new enzyme in the kynurenine pathway.', 'Anti-inflammatory activities of Coleus forsteri (formerly Plectranthus forsteri) extracts on human macrophages and chemical characterization.', 'A novel pathologic marker, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, for the cholangiopathy of immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced immune mediated hepatotoxicity as adverse events and the prediction of additional ursodeoxycholic acid treatment.', 'Polyphenols: Chemoprevention and therapeutic potentials in hematological malignancies.', 'The effects of genotype on inflammatory response in hippocampal progenitor cells: A computational approach.', 'YIV-906 potentiated anti-PD1 action against hepatocellular carcinoma by enhancing adaptive and innate immunity in the tumor microenvironment.']"""

Less is known about the relative risks of repeat prostate biopsies, which are frequently performed in prostate cancer screening and in active surveillance programs. We determined whether repeat biopsies are associated with an increased risk of hospitalization compared to the initial biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare linked data from 1991 to 2007 we identified 13,883 men who underwent a single prostate biopsy and 3,640 who had multiple biopsies. The 30-day hospitalization rates were compared between these groups, and with a randomly selected control population of 134,977. ICD-9 codes were then used to examine the frequency of serious infectious and noninfectious urological complications as the primary diagnosis for hospital admissions.  Results:   Initial and repeat biopsies were associated with a significantly increased risk of hospitalization within a 30-day period compared to randomly selected controls (p <0.0001). However, the repeat biopsy session was not associated with a greater risk of infectious (OR 0.81, 95% 0.49-1.32, p = 0.39) or serious noninfectious urological complications (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.54-1.62, p = 0.82) compared to the initial biopsy.

In patients with positive surgical margins we recorded the location, number, positive margin linear length and highest Gleason grade at a positive margin. The Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test were used to determine differences in progression-free probability among positive margin features. The concordance index was used to discriminate the accuracy of grouping surgical margin status as negative/positive vs positive margin linear length/highest Gleason grade.  Results:   A total of 207 cases (10%) showed positive surgical margins, including 93 (45%) that were pT2+ and 114 (55%) that were pT3a. Patients with pT3a and positive margins had greater prostate specific antigen and tumor volume, and Gleason score 7 or greater than those with pT2+. A total of 45 patients with positive margins progressed. We then subcategorized positive margins. Of the patients 164 (79%) had 1 positive margin. Positive margin linear length was 1 mm or less, 1.1 to 3 and greater than 3 in 104 (50%), 55 (27%) and 48 cases (23%), respectively. Two-year progression-free probability was 95%, 91%, 83% and 47% in patients with negative margins and the 3 positive margin linear length groups, respectively (p <0.001).

The effect of RT on MFS (HR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53-0.92; p=0.010) was attenuated when controlling for metastasis and CM risk (HR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-1.00; p=0.049), and the effect of RT on overall survival (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.96; p=0.02) was no longer significant when controlling for metastasis and CM risk (HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60-1.06; p=0.12). Compared to the whole sample, the enriched subgroup had the same 10-year incidence of MFS (40%; 95% CI, 22-57%), but a higher incidence of metastasis (30% (95% CI, 15-47%) vs. 20% (95% CI, 15-26%)). A randomized trial in the subgroup would have achieved 80% power with 56% less patients (313 vs. 709, respectively).

Materials and methods:   A prospective, 3-arm study was performed that included 30 patients with localized PCa; 30 patients with metastatic PCa, and 30 healthy volunteers. A single 7.5-mL peripheral blood sample was taken. The CTCs were isolated using an immunomagnetic method based on the CellSearch system.

Results:   The median follow-up was 42.9 months (interquartile range 27.14-49.5). A significant positive correlation was demonstrated between the CTC level and all tumor burden markers (prostate-specific antigen and T, N, and M stage; P <.001), except for Gleason score (tau = 0.16). A cutoff of ≥ 4 CTCs/7.5 mL was chosen to distinguish patients with a poor prognosis. These patients had a significantly shorter median OS and PFS (24 vs 45 months and 7 vs 44 months, respectively; P <.001). As the CTC level increased, the OS and PFS decreased. The risk of mortality and progression for the patients with ≥ 4 CTCs was 4.1 (P = .029) and 8.5 (P <.001) times greater. Multivariate analyses indicated that a CTC of ≥4 was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio 5.9, P <.005).

Person years (PY) were computed from 30 days after transplant to cancer diagnosis, death, return to dialysis or to study closure. The number of observed DNCs was compared to that expected in the general population of Italy through standardised incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). To identify risk factors, incidence rate ratios (IRR) were computed. Three-hundred ninety five DNCs were diagnosed during 39.598PYs, with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), particularly non-Hodgkin' lymphoma (NHL), lung, kidney and prostate as the most common types. The overall IR was 9.98/1.000PY, with a 1.7-fold augmented SIR (95% CI: 1.6-1.9). SIRs were particularly elevated for KS (135), lip (9.4), kidney carcinoma (4.9), NHL (4.5) and mesothelioma (4.2). KT recipients born in Southern Italy were at reduced risk of kidney cancer and solid tumors, though at a higher KS risk, than those born in Northern Italy. Use of mTOR inhibitors (mTORi) exerted, for all cancers combined, a 46% significantly reduced risk (95% CI: 0.4-0.7).

In the era of personalized medicine, as the determination of individual characteristics of a given tumor becomes increasingly more important, stage is perhaps one of the best ways to individualize the management of a patient. In the United States, reporting of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control TNM stage of tumors has all but become a mandate, linked to accreditation of laboratories by College of American Pathologists (CAP), as well as the maintenance of cancer center designations of institutions awarded by the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer. Providing the stage is now also being considered one of the main ""quality indicators"" and is linked to reimbursement by insurers. Following suit, many laboratory information system programs have also now integrated CAP synoptic protocols into their software. These regulatory requirements and increasingly widespread usage of staging protocols have also brought to light the imperfections of the current staging protocols. Some are due to the inherent nature of the staging process, which attempts to segregate a continuum (which cancers are) into distinct clusters, which is not always possible. Additionally, although some of the parameters used in staging are evidence-based, many are arbitrary or based on assumptions or logistic progression models. Moreover, some parameters such as the spread of a tumor beyond an organ may seem valid at the theoretic level but are difficult to use in daily practice, for example, for organs without a well-defined capsule. The most problematic issue, however, is the fact that the pathologists are now being asked to incorporate into ""pathologic stage"" the information that they are not savvy about or cannot verify themselves, such as serum prostate-specific antigen levels or vocal cord paralysis. This current issue of Seminars in Diagnostic Pathology deals with the pitfalls in pathologic staging of common and challenging cancers. In this series of articles written by experts who deal with pathologic staging on daily basis, the authors highlight the problematic aspects of staging in routine practice, discuss the ways these can be dealt with, and also provide a platform for future discussions and improvements in tumor staging.""","""['N Volkan Adsay', 'Olca Basturk', 'Burcu Saka']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Semin Diagn Pathol""","""['Pathologic staging of pancreatic, ampullary, biliary, and gallbladder cancers: pitfalls and practical limitations of the current AJCC/UICC TNM staging system and opportunities for improvement.', 'Recommendations for the reporting of pleural mesothelioma.', 'The National Cancer Data Base report on completeness of American Joint Committee on Cancer staging in United States cancer facilities.

Two notable examples are the multi-cancer susceptibility regions, 8q24.2 and 11q13.3.

Across the two regions, which contain 37 miRNAs genes, we explored genetic variants by surveying public databases and conducting targeted resequencing. Specifically, we investigated one common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within miR-1206 on 8q24.2 and two SNPs within miR-612 on 11q13.3. Though these variants are not correlated with known GWAS signals, we conjectured that they might be important for function of corresponding miRNAs.

The two SNPs within miR-612 significantly affected expression of mature miR-612 in a cell-type specific manner; enhancement in prostate cancer cell lines, reduction in colon cancer cells, and no effect in breast cancer cell lines. The SNP within miR-1206 also affected expression of mature miR-1206, but not in a cell-type specific manner.

Results from the large-scale Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) showed that antioxidants failed to prevent, and in some cases promoted, prostate cancer formation in men without a history of the disease. One possible explanation for these alarming results is the notion that the effects of antioxidant treatment on the prostate are modified by specific, intrinsic genetic risk factors, causing some men to respond negatively to antioxidant treatment. Loss of expression of the homeobox transcription factor NKX3.1 in the prostate is frequently associated with human prostate cancer. Nkx3.1 mutant mice display prostatic hyperplasia and dysplasia and are used as a model of the early stages of prostate cancer initiation. While the mechanisms by which Nkx3.1 loss promotes prostate tumorigenicity are not completely understood, published data have suggested that elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with Nkx3.1 loss may be a causative factor. Here we have tested this hypothesis by treating Nkx3.1 mutant mice with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 13 weeks post-weaning. Surprisingly, while NAC treatment decreased ROS levels in Nkx3.1 mutant mouse prostates, it failed to reduce prostatic epithelial hyperplasia/dysplasia. Rather, NAC treatment increased epithelial cell proliferation and promoted the expression of a pro-proliferative gene signature. These results show that ROS do not promote proliferation in the Nkx3.1-null prostate, but instead inhibit proliferation, suggesting that antioxidant treatment may encourage prostate epithelial cell proliferation early in prostate tumorigenesis. Our findings provide new insight that may help explain the increased prostate cancer risk observed with vitamin E treatment in the SELECT trial and emphasize the need for preclinical studies using accurate models of cancer.""","""['Erin E Martinez', 'Philip D Anderson', 'Monica Logan', 'Sarki A Abdulkadir']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A functional variant in NKX3.1 associated with prostate cancer risk in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT).', 'Roles for Nkx3.1 in prostate development and cancer.', 'Loss of glutathione peroxidase 3 induces ROS and contributes to prostatic hyperplasia in Nkx3.1 knockout mice.', 'Mechanisms of prostate tumorigenesis: roles for transcription factors Nkx3.1 and Egr1.', 'Integrating differentiation and cancer: the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene in prostate organogenesis and carcinogenesis.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Point Mutation in Nkx3.1 Prolongs Protein Half-Life and Reverses Effects Nkx3.1 Allelic Loss.', 'Organoids Increase the Predictive Value of in vitro Cancer Chemoprevention Studies for in vivo Outcome.', 'Organoids model distinct Vitamin E effects at different stages of prostate cancer evolution.', 'NQO1 suppresses NF-κB-p300 interaction to regulate inflammatory mediators associated with prostate tumorigenesis.', 'A functional variant in NKX3.1 associated with prostate cancer risk in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT).']"""

Wedelolactone (WDL), a medicinal plant-derived natural compound, is known to inhibit 5-Lox activity in neutrophils. However, its effect on apoptosis in prostate cancer cells has not been addressed. Thus, we tested the effects of WDL on human prostate cancer cells in vitro. We observed that WDL kills both androgen-sensitive as well as androgen-independent prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner by dramatically inducing apoptosis. We also found that WDL-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is dependent on c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (c-JNK) and caspase-3. Interestingly, WDL triggers apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via downregulation of protein kinase Cε (PKCε), but without inhibition of Akt. WDL does not affect the viability of normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) at doses that kill prostate cancer cells, and WDL-induced apoptosis is effectively prevented by 5-oxoETE, a metabolite of 5-Lox (but not by 15-oxoETE, a metabolite of 15-Lox), suggesting that the apoptosis-inducing effect of WDL in prostate cancer cells is mediated via inhibition of 5-Lox activity.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis not responding to conventional management. This article reviews experiences with HBO for radiogenic cystitis after prostate cancer.  Methods:   All patients treated for hemorrhagic cystitis with HBO between 2006 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The HBO procedure was performed for 130 min/day at 1.4 atmospheres overpressure. Patient demographics, type of radiotherapy, onset and severity of hematuria and time between first hemorrhagic episode and beginning of HBO were evaluated. The effect of HBO was defined as complete or partial (lower RTOG/EORTC grade) resolution of hematuria.  Results:   A total of 10 patients with radiogenic cystitis and a median age of 76 years were treated with a median of 30 HBO treatment sessions. Patients received primary, adjuvant, salvage and high dose rate (HDR) radiotherapy (60-78 Gy). First episodes of hematuria occurred after a median of 41 months following completion of radiotherapy and HBO was performed 11 months after the first episode of hematuria. After a median 35-month follow-up 80% experienced complete resolution, one patient suffered a one-off new hematuria and in one patient a salvage cystectomy was necessary. No adverse effects were documented.

In this study, we demonstrated that ETV1 is capable of binding to the matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) gene promoter both in vitro and in vivo. ETV1 stimulated the activity of the MMP-7 promoter, which was suppressed upon mutation of two ETV1 binding sites located within 200 base pairs upstream of the MMP-7 transcription start site. ETV1 overexpression in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells induced endogenous MMP-7 gene transcription, whereas ETV1 downregulation had the opposite effect. While MMP-7 overexpression did not influence LNCaP cell proliferation, it increased cell migration, which may be important during later stages of tumorigenesis. Finally, MMP-7 mRNA was significantly overexpressed in human prostate tumors compared to normal tissue.

In the present study, BML-275 was investigated for its antitumor effect(s) in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. BML-275 inhibited the cell proliferation of 4 human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2, Panc-1, Colo-357 and AsPC-1). In addition, BML-275 significantly increased the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by induction of DNA damage signaling and apoptosis. Furthermore, BML-275 induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. The inhibition of ROS generation by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) significantly prevented the induction of DNA damage and apoptosis, but failed to prevent the induction of G2/M arrest by BML-275. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of AMPKα increased the generation of intracellular ROS, DNA damage signaling and apoptosis without cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. These findings suggest that BML-275 exerts its antitumor effects by inducing ROS generation, DNA damage and apoptosis via inhibition of the AMPK pathway and by inducing G2/M arrest via a pathway independent of AMPK, implicating its potential application as an antitumor agent for pancreatic cancer.""","""['Hong-Quan Duong', 'Jae Seok Hwang', 'Hee Jeong Kim', 'Yeon-Sun Seong', 'Insoo Bae']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Diallyl trisulfide induces apoptosis and mitotic arrest in AGS human gastric carcinoma cells through reactive oxygen species-mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase.', 'AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms underlying in vitro antiglioma action of compound C.', 'Ovatodiolide isolated from Anisomeles indica induces cell cycle G2/M arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-dependent ATM/ATR signaling pathways.', 'The Complex Roles of DNA Repair Pathways, Inhibitors, Hyperthermia, and Contact Inhibition in Cell Cycle Halts.', 'Selective targeting of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint to improve the therapeutic index of radiotherapy.', 'Role of hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment and targeted therapy.', 'CDC20 May Serve as a Potential Biomarker-Based Risk Score System in Predicting the Prognosis of Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'CYP26A1 Is a Novel Cancer Biomarker of Pancreatic Carcinoma: Evidence from Integration Analysis and In Vitro Experiments.', 'Neuroprotective effect of cajaninstilbene acid against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion damages by activating AMPK/Nrf2 pathway.', 'Doxycycline potentiates the anti-proliferation effects of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells.']"""

In this study, we showed that valproic acid (VPA) induced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and formation of LC3 puncta, the typical markers of autophagy, in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. However, these markers were undetectable in DU145 cells upon autophagic stimulation, indicating a defect of autophagy in this cell line. Among several critical autophagy-related proteins, ATG5 and ATG12-ATG5 conjugates, which are essential for autophagy induction, were absent in DU145 cells. No canonical transcripts for full-length ATG5 but only two alternatively spliced ATG5 transcripts were identified in DU145 cells. These alternative transcripts lack one or two exons, leading to premature termination of ATG5 translation. Transfection of the wild-type ATG5 gene into DU145 cells rescued the production of ATG5 and ATG12-ATG5 conjugates, resulting in formation of LC3-II conjugates and LC3 puncta. Moreover, the levels of the SQSTM1 protein, which should be degradable as an autophagy adaptor, were much higher in DU145 than in LNCaP and PC-3 cells, but were significantly decreased after ATG5 restoration in DU145 cells. However, expression of wild-type ATG5 in DU145 or knockdown of ATG5 in LNCaP and PC-3 cells did not change the inhibitory effects of VPA on these cells.

Methods:   In 125 patients treated with castration or maximal androgen blockage for at least 12 months, metabolic indicators were analyzed.  Results:   Totally, 13.5% patients in castration group and 30.1% patients in maximal androgen blockage group were diagnosed metabolic syndrome 12 months after the beginning of treatments (χ(2) = 4.739, P = 0.029).

In maximal androgen blockage group, increased triglyceride and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were significant at the month 4, increased fasting plasma glucose and blood pressure were significant at the month 8. Total testosterone and free testosterone in maximal androgen blockage group were significantly lower than castration group at all visits, which were proved to show positive or negative correlations with metabolic indications. Severity of metabolic complications in maximal androgen blockage group was generally more serious than people received castration, with significantly statistical difference or not.

We aimed to assess whether androgenetic alopecia at ages 20 and 40 years are associated with risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   At a follow-up of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, men were asked to assess their hair pattern at ages 20 and 40 years relative to eight categories in showcards. Cases were men notified to the Victorian Cancer Registry with prostate cancer diagnosed between cohort enrollment (1990-1994) and follow-up attendance (2003-2009). Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate age-varying HRs and predicted cumulative probabilities of prostate cancer by androgenetic alopecia categories.  Results:   Of 9,448 men that attended follow-up and provided data on androgenetic alopecia, we identified 476 prostate cancer cases during a median follow-up of 11 years four months. Cumulative probability of prostate cancer was greater at all ages up to 76 years, for men with vertex versus no androgenetic alopecia at age of 40 years. At age of 76 years, the estimated probabilities converged to 0.15. Vertex androgenetic alopecia at 40 years was also associated with younger age of diagnosis for prostate cancer cases.  Conclusions:   Vertex androgenetic alopecia at age of 40 years might be a marker of increased risk of early-onset prostate cancer.

Here, we identified that miR-23b is a methylation-silenced tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. We showed that miR-23b expression is controlled by promoter methylation and has great promise as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer. High levels of miR-23b expression are positively correlated with higher overall and recurrence-free survival in patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, we elucidated the tumor suppressor role of miR-23b using in vitro and in vivo models. We showed that proto-oncogene Src kinase and Akt are direct targets of miR-23b. Increased expression of miR-23b inhibited proliferation, colony formation, migration/invasion, and triggered G(0)-G(1) cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer. Overexpression of miR-23b inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) causing a decline in mesenchymal markers Vimentin and Snail and increasing the epithelial marker, E-cadherin. Depletion of Src by RNA interference conferred similar functional effects as that of miR-23b reconstitution. miR-23b expression caused a dramatic decrease in tumor growth in nude mice and attenuated Src expression in excised tumors compared with a control miR. These findings suggest that miR-23b is a methylation-silenced tumor suppressor that may be a useful biomarker in prostate cancer.

These properties can be very advantageous for MRSI. In particular, signals that generally overlap at lower fields, such as choline, polyamines and creatine, can be resolved at 7 T. However, higher magnetic field strengths suffer from strong radiofrequency (RF) field nonuniformities. These nonuniformities become even stronger when using surface transceivers, such as an endorectal coil for prostate imaging. In order to obtain uniform excitations for accurate MRSI measurements, adiabatic sequences are therefore recommended. Conventional adiabatic MRS sequences (i.e. localization by adiabatic selective refocusing, LASER) have relatively long TEs, especially when optimized to measure the strongly coupled spins of citrate in the prostate. The semi-LASER (sLASER) sequence has a significantly shorter TE, although it does not provide adiabatic excitation. Therefore, we propose an adiabatic sLASER sequence that either has a composite adiabatic slice-selective excitation (cLASER) or a non-slice-selective adiabatic excitation (nsLASER), allowing for shorter TEs, whilst maintaining the adiabatic spin excitation.

Exclusion of the slice selection can be considered once the field of view extends beyond the transmit field of the RF coil.

Ultrasound elastography objectively measures tissue elasticity, and previous studies have described it as a high sensitivity and specificity technique for the detection of malignant thyroid nodules in high-risk populations. The aim was to assess the accuracy of elastography in a population with low risk of malignancy.  Design and patients:   128 consecutive patients with nodular goiter were recruited. Elastography and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration were performed. When malignancy was suspected by citology, surgery was recommended. Thyroid nodules were classified by elastography according the criteria described by Ueno, and an alternative classification. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and odds ratio were calculated.  Results:   Most patients were female, aged 56.1 year, with single nodule (52.0%) or multinodular goiter (45.6%), and a few thyroiditis (2.4%). The majority of nodules were mostly elastic. Fine-needle aspiration found 86% of benign nodules, 9.3% of indeterminate, and 4.7% possibly malignant. After surgery, 3 malignant nodules were confirmed, all of them being papillary carcinomas. All the malignant nodules were mostly elastic, as well as 75% of indeterminate nodules. Low values of sensitivity and specificity were found for elastic nodules being benign and hard nodules malignant.  Conclusion:   In a low-risk population for thyroid cancer, elastography lacks accuracy for the diagnosis of malignant nodules.""","""['A Vidal-Casariego', 'L López-González', 'A Jiménez-Pérez', 'M D Ballesteros-Pomar', 'G Kyriakos', 'A Urioste-Fondo', 'R Álvarez-San Martín', 'I Cano-Rodríguez', 'J M Jiménez-García de la Marina']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes""","""['Routine ultrasound-guided aspiration cytology for evaluation of palpable thyroid nodules in an endemic area: is it justified?', 'Low Elasticity of Thyroid Nodules on Ultrasound Elastography Is Correlated with Malignancy, Degree of Fibrosis, and High Expression of Galectin-3 and Fibronectin-1.', 'Pretransplant Thyroid Findings in Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease.', 'Role of ultrasonography in thyroid disease.', 'Qualitative elastography can replace thyroid nodule fine-needle aspiration in patients with soft thyroid nodules.

However, due to lack of specific stem cell surface markers, CSCs are very difficult to be separated from some cancer cells, which becomes the key barrier of functional studies of CSCs. The sorting method by side population cells (SP) lays a solid foundation for in-depth and comprehensive study of CSCs. To identify the existence of SP in prostate cancer cell lines, we applied flow cytometry sorting by SP to cultures of prostate cancer cell lines (TSU, LnCap, and PC-3), and the cancer stem-like characteristics of SP were verified through experiments in vitro and in vivo. The proportion of SP in TSU cells was calculated to be 1.60%±0.40% [Formula: see text], and that in PC-3 and LnCap cells was calculated to be 0.80%±0.05% and 0.60%±0.20%, respectively. The colony formation assay demonstrated that the colony formation rate of SP to non-SP sorted from TSU via flow cytometry was 0.495±0.038 to 0.177±0.029 in 500 cells, 0.505±0.026 to 0.169±0.024 in 250 cells, and 0.088±0.016 to 0.043±0.012 in 125 cells respectively. In the in vivo experiments, tumors were observed in all the mice on the 10th day after injecting 50 000 cells subcutaneously in SP group, whereas when 5×10(6) cells were injected in non-SP group, tumors were developed in only 4 out of 8 mice until the 3rd week before the end of the experiment. Our results revealed that prostate cancer cells contain a small subset of cells, called SP, possessing much greater capacity of colony formation and tumorigenic potential than non-SP. These suggest that SP in prostate cancer cells may play a key role in the self-renewal and proliferation, and have the characteristics of cancer stem-like cells. Dissecting these features will provide a new understanding of the function of prostate CSCs in tumorigenicity and transformation.""","""['Yatong Chen', 'Jiahui Zhao', 'Yong Luo', 'Yongxing Wang', 'Nengbao Wei', 'Yongguang Jiang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci""","""['Downregulated expression of miRNA-149 promotes apoptosis in side population cells sorted from the TSU prostate cancer cell line.', 'Sorting and identification of cancer stem cells in human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Side population cells separated from A549 lung cancer cell line possess cancer stem cell-like properties and inhibition of autophagy potentiates the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin.', 'Side population cells as prototype of chemoresistant, tumor-initiating cells.', 'Isolation, identification, and characterization of cancer stem cells: A review.', 'Integrating Pharmacogenomics Data-Driven Computational Drug Prediction with Single-Cell RNAseq to Demonstrate the Efficacy of a NAMPT Inhibitor against Aggressive, Taxane-Resistant, and Stem-like Cells in Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'NRP1-positive lung cancer cells possess tumor-initiating properties.', 'Characterization of prostate cancer cell progression in zebrafish xenograft model.', 'Isolation of side population cells from endometrial cancer cells using a violet laser diode.']"""

Methods:   We examined the effect of hypoxia on RUNX2 expression and the role of RUNX2 in the regulation of Bcl-2 and apoptosis resistance in prostate cancer.  Results:   Hypoxia increased RUNX2 expression in vitro, and bicalutamide-treated LNCaP tumours in mice (previously shown to have increased tumour hypoxia) exhibited increased RUNX2 expression. In addition, RUNX2-overexpressing LNCaP cells showed increased cell viability, following bicalutamide and docetaxel treatment, which was inhibited by RUNX2 siRNA; a range of assays demonstrated that this was due to resistance to apoptosis. RUNX2 expression was associated with increased Bcl-2 levels, and regulation of Bcl-2 by RUNX2 was confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) binding and reporter assays. Moreover, a Q-PCR array identified other apoptosis-associated genes upregulated in the RUNX2-overexpressing LNCaP cells.

They have low side effects and toxicity and presumably modulate the factors that are critical for cell proliferation, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis. The present study investigates the effects of some medicinal plant extracts from generally recognized as safe plants that may be useful in the prevention and treatment of cancer.  Methods:   Clonogenic assays using logarithmically-growing cells were performed to test the effect. The cytotoxic effects of Curcuma longa and Zingiber officinale were studied using sulforhodamine B assay, tetrazolium dye assay, colony morphology and microscopic analysis.  Results:   Out of the 13 lyophilized plant-derived extracts evaluated for growth-inhibitory effects on the PC-3M prostate cancer cell line, two extracts derived from C. longa and Z. officinale showed significant inhibitory effects on colony-forming ability. The individual and augmentative effects of these two extracts were tested for their narrow range effective lower concentration on PC-3M in clonogenic assays. At relatively lower concentrations, C. longa showed significant inhibition of colony formation in clonogenic assays; whereas at same concentrations Z. officinale showed only moderate inhibitory effects. However, when both the agents were tested together at the same concentrations, the combined effects were much more significant than their individual ones. On normal prostate epithelial cells both C. longa and Z. officinale had similar effects but at a lower magnitude. These observations were confirmed by several cytotoxicity assays involving the morphological appearance of the colonies, microscopic observations, per cent inhibition in comparison to control by sulforhodamine B and tetrazolium dye assay.

Current prostate-specific-antigen testing and digital rectal examination screening provide ambiguous results leading to both under-and over-treatment. Accurate, consistent diagnosis is crucial to risk-stratify patients and facilitate clinical decision making as to treatment versus active surveillance. Diagnosis is currently achieved by needle biopsy, a painful procedure. Thus, there is a clinical need for a minimally-invasive test to determine prostate cancer aggressiveness. A blood sample to predict Gleason score, which is known to reflect aggressiveness of the cancer, could serve as such a test.  Materials and methods:   Blood mRNA was isolated from North American and Malaysian prostate cancer patients/controls. Microarray analysis was conducted utilizing the Affymetrix U133 plus 2·0 platform. Expression profiles from 255 patients/controls generated 85 candidate biomarkers. Following quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, ten disease-associated biomarkers remained for paired statistical analysis and normalization.  Results:   Microarray analysis was conducted to identify 85 genes differentially expressed between aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥8) and controls. Expression of these genes was qRT-PCR verified. Statistical analysis yielded a final seven-gene panel evaluated as six gene-ratio duplexes. This molecular signature predicted as aggressive (ie, Gleason score ≥8) 55% of G6 samples, 49% of G7(3+4), 79% of G7(4+3) and 83% of G8-10, while rejecting 98% of controls.  Conclusion:   In this study, we have developed a novel, blood-based biomarker panel which can be used as the basis of a simple blood test to identify men with aggressive prostate cancer and thereby reduce the overdiagnosis and overtreatment that currently results from diagnosis using PSA alone. We discuss possible clinical uses of the panel to identify men more likely to benefit from biopsy and immediate therapy versus those more suited to an ""active surveillance"" strategy.""","""['Men Long Liong', 'Chun Ren Lim', 'Hengxuan Yang', 'Samuel Chao', 'Chin Wei Bong', 'Wing Seng Leong', 'Prashanta Kumar Das', 'Chit Sin Loh', 'Ban Eng Lau', 'Choon Geok Yu', 'Edie Jian Jiek Ooi', 'Robert K Nam', 'Paul D Allen', 'Graeme S Steele', 'Karl Wassmann', 'Jerome P Richie', 'Choong Chin Liew']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Use of two gene panels for prostate cancer diagnosis and patient risk stratification.', 'Urinary microRNA-based signature improves accuracy of detection of clinically relevant prostate cancer within the prostate-specific antigen grey zone.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'Blood-based and urinary prostate cancer biomarkers: a review and comparison of novel biomarkers for detection and treatment decisions.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: How to Do It Right.', 'Immune-related gene expression signatures in colorectal cancer.', 'Blood-Derived Biomarkers of Diagnosis, Prognosis and Therapy Response in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Peripheral blood transcriptome identifies high-risk benign and malignant breast lesions.', 'The Contributions of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer Initiation and Metastasis.', 'Gene expression signature for detection of gastric cancer in peripheral blood.']"""

Pursuant to our previous finding that upregulation of β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) expression represents a cellular response in cancer cells to ERMAs, including CG-12 and 2-deoxyglucose, we demonstrated that this β-TrCP accumulation resulted from decreased Skp2 expression. Evidence indicates that Skp2 targets β-TrCP for degradation via the cyclin-dependent kinase 2-facilitated recognition of the proline-directed phosphorylation motif (412)SP. This Skp2 downregulation was attributable to Sirt1-dependent suppression of COP9 signalosome (Csn)5 expression in response to CG-12, leading to increased cullin 1 neddylation in the Skp1-cullin1-F-box protein complex and consequent Skp2 destabilization. Moreover, we determined that Skp2 and β-TrCP are mutually regulated, providing a feedback mechanism that amplifies the suppressive effect of ERMAs on Skp2. Specifically, cellular accumulation of β-TrCP reduced the expression of Sp1, a β-TrCP substrate, which, in turn, reduced Skp2 gene expression. This Skp2-β-TrCP-Sp1 feedback loop represents a novel crosstalk mechanism between these two important F-box proteins in cancer cells with aberrant Skp2 expression under energy restriction, which provides a proof-of-concept that the oncogenic Csn5/Skp2 signaling axis represents a ""druggable"" target for this novel ERMA.""","""['Shuo Wei', 'Po-Chen Chu', 'Hsiao-Ching Chuang', 'Wen-Chun Hung', 'Samuel K Kulp', 'Ching-Shih Chen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The COP9 signalosome regulates Skp2 levels and proliferation of human cells.', 'A novel mechanism by which thiazolidinediones facilitate the proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 in cancer cells.', 'Thiazolidinediones modulate the expression of beta-catenin and other cell-cycle regulatory proteins by targeting the F-box proteins of Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein E3 ubiquitin ligase independently of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.', 'The characteristics and roles of β-TrCP1/2 in carcinogenesis.', 'Roles of COP9 signalosome in cancer.', 'All-Trans Retinoic Acid Promotes a Tumor Suppressive OTUD6B-β-TrCP-SNAIL Axis in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Enhances Immunotherapy.', 'Downregulation of SHIP2 by Hepatitis B Virus X Promotes the Metastasis and Chemoresistance of Hepatocellular Carcinoma through SKP2.', 'A patent review of the ubiquitin ligase system: 2015-2018.', 'Ribosomal protein S27-like regulates autophagy via the β-TrCP-DEPTOR-mTORC1 axis.', 'The SCFFBXO46 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates degradation of the tumor suppressor FBXO31 and thereby prevents premature cellular senescence.']"""

Cell membrane protein markers, CD49f, CD133 and CD44, have been shown to identify putative prostate stem cells, but a lack of consensus exists with regards to the most efficient marker(s) for stem-like cell identification. This study aimed to determine whether previously reported markers had equal capacity to select monolayer and spheroid colony-forming cells (CFCs), which were used as surrogate readouts of stem-like cells, and to characterize the expression of CD49f, CD44 and CD133 by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry.In benign prostate cells, CD49f+, CD44+, and CD133+ cells represented 5.6±3.1%, 28.2±4.1% and 0.10±0.06% of total cells. Both monolayer- and spheroid-CFCs existed at a frequency of approximately 0.5% of total cells. CD49f+, CD44+, and CD133+ subpopulations differed significantly in their ability to select benign CFCs. The highest recovery of CFCs was achieved by CD49f+ selection (98%), whereas CD44+ or CD133+ selection led to poor CFC-recovery (17% and 3%, respectively). For the first time, we show highly efficient recovery of CFCs from advanced prostate cancer by CD49f+, but not by CD44+ or CD133+ selection. Furthermore, CD133 expression (AC133 clone) could not be detected in benign prostate cells by either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry.

Here, we used cell-based small molecule screening to identify CGK062 as an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. CGK062 promoted protein kinase Cα (PKCα)-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/Ser37, marking it for proteasomal degradation. This reduced intracellular β-catenin levels and consequently antagonized β-catenin response transcription (CRT). Pharmacological inhibition or depletion of PKCα abrogated CGK062-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin. In addition, CGK062 repressed the expression of the genes encoding cyclin D1, c-myc, and axin-2, β-catenin target genes, and thus inhibited the growth of CRT-positive cancer cells. Furthermore, treatment of nude mice bearing PC3 xenograft tumors with CGK062 at doses of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg (i.p.) significantly suppressed tumor growth.

Because of the variety of health problems and high prevalence of comorbidity, primary care physicians (PCPs) seem obvious candidates to take care of these patients, and insight into primary health care (PHC) use of cancer survivors is needed. We aimed to find determinants for PHC use in cancer survivors.  Methods:   Using data from the Netherlands Information Network of Primary Care, we determined the volume of PHC use in 1,256 adult patients with breast cancer, 503 patients with prostate cancer, and 487 patients with colorectal cancer 2 to 5 years after diagnosis and compared this with age- and sex-matched controls without cancer from the same practice. We also examined whether age, comorbidity, and time since diagnosis were related to PHC use.  Results:   The mean annual number of primary care contacts was increased compared with control patients by 24% in patients with breast cancer (P<.001) and by 33% in patients with prostate cancer (P<.001). This difference remained constant between 2 and 5 years after diagnosis. In patients with colon cancer, the difference with controls tended to decrease with age (12% per 10 years; P=.005).  Conclusion:   PHC use is significantly increased 2 to 5 years after diagnosis of cancer, especially in younger patients without a chronic disease. Given the expected increase in cancer survivors, PCPs should prepare themselves for this increasing amount of aftercare.

However, suitable models for the analysis of real experimental data are either absent, or fail to provide a simple analysis tool in which experimental data can be analyzed quickly and reliably. The Hertz model has been widely used to study AFM data on living cells, however it makes assumptions that are untrue for cells, namely that cells behave as linear elastic bodies. This article presents and evaluates an alternative nonlinear Hertz model, which allows the Young's modulus to vary according to a second order polynomial function of indentation depth. Evaluation of the model revealed that prostate cancer cells (PC3) responded more uniformly to force compared to the normal PNT2 cells. Also, more energy (J) was needed to deform the normal prostate cells compared to the prostate cancer cells.

However the biological function of Trop2 in tissue maintenance and tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Trop2 is a regulator of self-renewal, proliferation, and transformation. Trop2 controls these processes through a mechanism of regulated intramembrane proteolysis that leads to cleavage of Trop2, creating two products: the extracellular domain and the intracellular domain. The intracellular domain of Trop2 is released from the membrane and accumulates in the nucleus. Heightened expression of the Trop2 intracellular domain promotes stem/progenitor self-renewal through signaling via β-catenin and is sufficient to initiate precursor lesions to prostate cancer in vivo. Importantly, we demonstrate that loss of β-catenin or Trop2 loss-of-function cleavage mutants abrogates Trop2-driven self-renewal and hyperplasia in the prostate. These findings suggest that heightened expression of Trop2 is selected for in epithelial cancers to enhance the stem-like properties of self-renewal and proliferation.

The Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRPR) offers a promising target for staging and monitoring of PC since it is overexpressed in PC and not in normal prostatic tissue. To improve receptor-mediated imaging we investigated the impact of various experimental conditions on pharmacokinetics using the Indium-111 labelled bombesin (BN) analogue AMBA. Besides frequently used androgen-resistant PC-3 also the clinically more relevant androgen sensitive VCaP celline was used as human PC xenograft in nude mice.  Methods:   Non-purified [111In]AMBA was compared with HPLC-purified [111In]AMBA. Effect of specific activity was studied administering 0.1MBq [111In]AMBA supplemented with different amounts of AMBA (1-3000pmol). GRPR was saturated with Tyr4-BN 1 and 4h prior to injection of [111In]AMBA.  Results:   GRPR-positive tissue showed a significant 2 to 3-fold increase in absolute uptake after HPLC-purification while keeping a stable tumor-to-pancreas ratio. Lowering specific activity resulted in decline in uptake to 43% in tumor, 49% in kidney and 92% in pancreas between 10 and 3000 pmol. Tumor-to-pancreas ratio improved six-fold from 0.1±0 after 10 pmol up to 0.6±0.2 after 3000 pmol (P<0.01). When saturating GRPR 4h prior to [111In]AMBA injection tumor-to-pancreas ratio improved from 0.10±0.3 to 0.22±0.2 (P<0.01) and tumor-to-kidney ratio increased from 0.92±0.16 to 3.45±0.5 (P<0.01).  Conclusion:   Besides specific peptide characteristics also the experimental conditions, such as HPLC-purification, variations in specific activity and saturation of the GRPR prior to [111In]AMBA administration essentially affect radiopeptide pharmacokinetics. Experimental conditions therefore need to be carefully selected in order to compose ideal standardised protocols for optimal targeting.""","""['R P J Schroeder', 'E De Blois', 'C M A De Ridder', 'W M Van Weerden', 'W A P Breeman', 'M de Jong']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Q J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-based targeting using bombesin analogues is superior to metabolism-based targeting using choline for in vivo imaging of human prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Preclinical evaluation of a novel ¹¹¹In-labeled bombesin homodimer for improved imaging of GRPR-positive prostate cancer.', 'Androgen-regulated gastrin-releasing peptide receptor expression in androgen-dependent human prostate tumor xenografts.', 'Peptide receptor imaging of prostate cancer with radiolabelled bombesin analogues.', 'Bombesin-Targeted PET of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prospects of Targeting the Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor and Somatostatin Receptor 2 for Nuclear Imaging and Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'Increased physical activity severely induces osteoarthritic changes in knee joints with papain induced sulfate-glycosaminoglycan depleted cartilage.']"""

So far no effect on prostate cancer specific survival has been proven by 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on adjuvant radiotherapy. At present the optimal timing of radiotherapy is not defined. Identifying the site of recurrence is difficult at low PSA levels. [11C]choline PET-CT studies in biochemical recurrent prostate cancer after prostatectomy show a higher frequency of (false) negative cases compared to restaging after EBRT. It is uncertain if this reflects low volume of disease and/or low grade as biopsies fail to prove recurrent cancer in 50% of cases. We followed the clinical course of men with recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy and investigated treatment and survival. PET-CT data were correlated with clinical data, PSA kinetics and disease specific and overall survival. We also studied relative survival comparing an age matched group from the Central Dutch Statistical Office (CBS).  Methods:   Sixty-four patients underwent [11C]choline PET-CT on PSA relapse. All patients were initially treated with radical prostatectomy and reached PSA nadir of <0.1 ng/mL. Recurrent disease was defined as PSA increase <0.2 ng/mL after nadir. Patients were either treated with watchful waiting, salvage radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy based on individual assessments by the treating urologists. Statistic: χ2, log-rank and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used to compare the [11C] choline PET/CT groups.  Results:   The 64 patients had median PSA of 1.4 ng/mL. Median follow-up period of patients was 50 (6-124) months. Ten patients died during the course of follow-up of which 5 due to metastasized disease. No significant differences were seen in age, time to recurrence, total PSA at recurrence and PET-CT results. Patients with abnormal PET had higher PSAVel (median 3.09 ng/mL/yr versus 10.17, P=0.002) and shorter PSADT (med 4.83 months vs. 0.53, P=0.016). Median time to treatment was significantly lower in the PET-CT negative group. Age of patients at death from the whole group did not differ from the age of death in an age matched group. Disease specific survival was significantly higher in the PET-CT negative group (P=0.05).  Conclusion:   [11C]choline PET-CT showed that a negative PET/CT correlated with a higher disease specific survival and a lower treatment rate in men with a biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Overall survival of the total group was equal to the age matched cohort emphasizing the limited effect of a biochemical recurrent prostate cancer on overall survival. The optimum timing (adjuvant or early salvage) must be answered in running trials before adjuvant RT is used as standard of care.""","""['A J Breeuwsma', 'M Rybalov', 'A M Leliveld', 'J Pruim', 'I J de Jong']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Q J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Early biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy: which prostate cancer patients may benefit from a restaging 11C-Choline PET/CT scan before salvage radiation therapy?', 'Influence of trigger PSA and PSA kinetics on 11C-Choline PET/CT detection rate in patients with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen velocity versus prostate-specific antigen doubling time for prediction of 11C choline PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Recent studies have shown that downregulation of the microRNA miR-124 occurs in several types of human cancer, suggesting a tumor suppressive function of miR-124. Until now, however, it has been unclear whether miR-124 is associated with CaP. In the present study, we completed a series of experiments to understand the functional role of miR-124 in CaP. We detected the expression level of miR-124 in clinical CaP tissues, evaluated the influence of miR-124 on the growth of CaP cells and investigated the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of miR-124. We found that (i) miR-124 directly targets the androgen receptor (AR) and subsequently induces an upregulation of p53; (ii) miR-124 is significantly downregulated in malignant prostatic cells compared to benign cells, and DNA methylation causes the reduced expression of miR-124; and (iii) miR-124 can inhibit the growth of CaP cells in vitro and in vivo. Data from this study revealed that loss of miR-124 expression is a common event in CaP, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of CaP. Our studies also suggest that miR-124 is a potential tumor suppressive gene in CaP, and restoration of miR-124 expression may represent a novel strategy for CaP therapy.""","""['X-B Shi', 'L Xue', 'A-H Ma', 'C G Tepper', 'R Gandour-Edwards', 'H-J Kung', 'R W deVere White']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Regulation and methylation of tumor suppressor miR-124 by androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Novel tumor suppressor microRNA at frequently deleted chromosomal region 8p21 regulates epidermal growth factor receptor in prostate cancer.', 'TCF7 is suppressed by the androgen receptor via microRNA-1-mediated downregulation and is involved in the development of resistance to androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs and prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and miR-206 regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma as a Metabolic Disease: An Update on Main Pathways, Potential Biomarkers, and Therapeutic Targets.', 'Identification of Epigenetic Interactions between miRNA and Gene Expression as Potential Prognostic Markers in Bladder Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor in breast cancer: The ""5W"" questions.', 'Association of Androgenic Regulation and MicroRNAs in Acinar Adenocarcinoma of Prostate.', 'Bioengineered miR-124-3p prodrug selectively alters the proteome of human carcinoma cells to control multiple cellular components and lung metastasis in\xa0vivo.']"""

Livin mRNA and protein expression were investigated by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Hairpin RT-PCR was performed to analyse suspected miRNAs. Livin 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) wild type and mutant dual-luciferase reporter vectors were constructed. The miRNAs targeting Livin were predicted by the online software - TargetScan and miRBase, and then validated by dual luciferase reporter gene assay. We found that post-transcriptional inhibition of Livin occurred in DU145 cells, assumedly due to the miRNA pathway. Among 6 candidate miRNAs, miR-198 expression was identified to be negatively correlated with Livin expression level in some prostate cancer cell lines.

We examined how the increased volume is being distributed and what hospital characteristics are associated with increasing volume.  Materials and methods:   We identified all men age 40 to less than 80 years who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer from 2000 to 2008 in the NIS (Nationwide Inpatient Sample) (586,429). Ownership of a surgical robot was determined using the 2007 AHA (American Hospital Association) Annual Survey. The association between hospital radical prostatectomy volume and hospital characteristics, including ownership of a robot, was explored using multivariate linear regression.  Results:   From 2000 to 2008 there was a 74% increase in the number of radical prostatectomies performed (p = 0.05) along with a 19% decrease in the number of hospitals performing radical prostatectomy (p <0.001), resulting in an increase in annual hospital radical prostatectomy volume (p = 0.009). Several hospital variables were associated with greater radical prostatectomy volume including teaching status, urban location, large bed size and ownership of a robot in 2007. On multivariate analysis the year, teaching status, large bed size, urban location and presence of a robot were associated with higher hospital radical prostatectomy volume.  Conclusions:   Use of radical prostatectomy increased significantly between 2000 and 2008, most notably after 2005. The increase in radical prostatectomy resulted in centralization to select hospitals, particularly those in the top radical prostatectomy volume quartile and those investing in robotic technology.

Microvessel density was calculated using CD31 immunostaining.

Aperio analysis in group II additionally showed significantly higher values in normal tissue for vessel lumen (P < .001), whereas vessel perimeter, wall thickness, vessel compactness, and shape were not significantly different (P > .05). Aperio comparison of low- versus high-grade prostate cancer demonstrated that only mean vessel count was increased in high-grade tumors (P = .047); no other automated parameter in either group showed significant association with Gleason scores. Irrespective of methodology, microvessel density was not increased in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate. The bias of using vascular hot spots that possibly contributed to previous contradictory results has been mitigated by automated microvessel density quantitation here.

In order to improve the predictivity of preclinical experiments, more realistic animal models are needed, for example, tumors xenografted directly on the prostate gland of rodents.  Purpose:   To characterize the in-vivo metabolism of healthy rat prostate and of an orthotopic human prostate cancer model using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).  Material and methods:   The highly metastatic and hormone-independent PC3-MM2 human prostate cancer model was implanted into the ventral prostate lobe of three Nude rats. Healthy Nude (n = 6) and Sprague-Dawley (n = 6) rats were also studied for interspecies comparison of normal prostate metabolism. Magnetic resonance imaging and short echo-time (TE 11.2 ms) single voxel PRESS spectroscopy were performed on dorsal (DP) and ventral (VP) prostate as well as tumor at 4.7 T. The metabolic content and volume of dorsal and ventral lobes were characterized as a function of species and age.  Results:   Slightly lower total creatine (tCr)/water (11.3 ± 2.6 vs. 15.3 ± 3.0, NS), but significantly higher Inositol (Ins)/water (18.9 ± 1.9 vs. 6.6 ± 3.3, P < 0.003) and total choline (tCho)/water (15.0 ± 2.1 vs. 5.6 ± 1.1, P < 0.00007) were observed within healthy DP lobes with respect to VP lobes. No significant variation in metabolic content was seen in healthy DP and VP lobes of Nude rats as a function of age, and no species dependence was observed in their metabolic content. For the orthotopic PC3-MM2 tumor, implanted in VP, the tCr/water ratio was significantly lower (3.1 ± 0.9) than neighboring DP (12.8 ± 1.8, P < 0.00003) and healthy VP (15.3 ± 3.0, P < 0.00006). For Ins, the metabolite ratio in PC3-MM2 was close to that of healthy VP (4.3 ± 2.8 vs. 6.6 ± 3.3, p = NS), but much lower than in neighboring DP (19.1 ± 1.3, P < 0.00005). A similar trend was also observed for tCho, where metabolite ratios in PC3-MM2, healthy VP and neighboring DP were 3.5 ± 0.9, 5.6 ± 1.1, and 15.9 ± 0.8, respectively.  Conclusion:   The in-vivo MRS study of healthy prostate and orthotopic prostate cancer is feasible in rats.

This study aims to explore the relationship of subjective and objective anorectal function with quality of life (QoL) and their relative impact in patients irradiated for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Patients underwent anal manometry, rectal barostat measurement, and completed validated questionnaires, at least 1 year after prostate radiotherapy (range 1-7 years). QoL was measured by the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale (FIQL) and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Bowel domain (EPICB)-bother subscale. Severity of symptoms was rated by the EPICB function subscale.  Results:   Anorectal function was evaluated in 85 men. Sixty-three percent suffered from one or more anorectal symptoms. Correlations of individual symptoms ranged from r = 0.23 to r = 0.53 with FIQL domains and from r = 0.36 to r = 0.73 with EPICB bother scores. They were strongest for fecal incontinence and urgency. Correlations of anal sphincter pressures, rectal capacity, and sensory thresholds ranged from r = 0.00 to r = 0.42 with FIQL domains and from r = 0.15 to r = 0.31 with EPICB bother scores. Anal resting pressure correlated most strongly. Standardized regression coefficients for QoL outcomes were largest for incontinence, urgency, and anal resting pressure. Regression models with subjective parameters explained a larger amount (range 26-92 %) of variation in QoL outcome than objective parameters (range 10-22 %).  Conclusions:   Fecal incontinence and rectal urgency are the symptoms with the largest influence on QoL. Impaired anal resting pressure is the objective function parameter with the largest influence.

We calculated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to estimate the global burden of cancer in 2008.  Methods:   We used population-based data, mostly from cancer registries, for incidence, mortality, life expectancy, disease duration, and age at onset and death, alongside proportions of patients who were treated and living with sequelae or regarded as cured, to calculate years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). We used YLLs and YLDs to derive DALYs for 27 sites of cancers in 184 countries in 12 world regions. Estimates were grouped into four categories based on a country's human development index (HDI). We applied zero discounting and uniform age weighting, and age-standardised rates to enable cross-country and regional comparisons.  Findings:   Worldwide, an estimated 169·3 million years of healthy life were lost because of cancer in 2008. Colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers were the main contributors to total DALYs in most world regions and caused 18-50% of the total cancer burden. We estimated an additional burden of 25% from infection-related cancers (liver, stomach, and cervical) in sub-Saharan Africa, and 27% in eastern Asia. We noted substantial global differences in the cancer profile of DALYs by country and region; however, YLLs were the most important component of DALYs in all countries and for all cancers, and contributed to more than 90% of the total burden. Nonetheless, low-resource settings had consistently higher YLLs (as a proportion of total DALYs) than did high-resource settings.  Interpretation:   Age-adjusted DALYs lost from cancer are substantial, irrespective of world region. The consistently larger proportions of YLLs in low HDI than in high HDI countries indicate substantial inequalities in prognosis after diagnosis, related to degree of human development. Therefore, radical improvement in cancer care is needed in low-resource countries.

TP53 mutation status is known as a core determinant of survival in breast cancer. The pathways disrupted in association with TP53 mutation status in tumours are not well characterised.  Method:   In this study, we stratify breast cancers based on their TP53 mutation status and identify the set of dysregulated tumorigenic pathways and corresponding candidate driver genes using breast cancer gene expression profiles. Expressions of these genes were evaluated for their effect on patient survival first in univariate models, followed by multivariate models with TP53 status as a covariate.  Results:   The most strongly differentially enriched pathways between breast cancers stratified by TP53 mutation status include in addition to TP53 signalling, several known cancer pathways involved in renal, prostate, pancreatic, colorectal, lung and other cancers, and signalling pathways such as calcium signalling, MAPK, ERBB and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathways. We found that mutant TP53 in conjunction with active estrogen receptor (ER) signalling significantly influence survival. We also found that upregulation of VEGFA mRNA levels in association with active ER signalling is a significant marker for poor survival, even in the presence of wild-type TP53.  Conclusion:   Mutation status of TP53 in breast cancer involves wide ranging derangement of several pathways. Among the candidate genes of the significantly deranged pathways, we identified VEGFA expression as an important marker of survival even when controlled by TP53 mutation status. Interestingly, independent of the TP53 mutation status, the survival effect of VEGFA was found significant in patients with active ER signalling (ER/PgR+), but not in those with ER/PgR- status. Therefore, we propose more studies to focus on the role of complex interplay between TP53, ER and VEGF signalling from therapeutic and prognostic context in breast cancer.""","""['H Joshi', 'G Bhanot', 'A-L Børresen-Dale', 'V Kristensen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Combined vascular endothelial growth factor and TP53 status predicts poor response to tamoxifen therapy in estrogen receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.', 'Mutated TP53 is a marker of increased VEGF expression: analysis of 7,525 pan-cancer tissues.', 'Mutant p53 accumulation in human breast cancer is not an intrinsic property or dependent on structural or functional disruption but is regulated by exogenous stress and receptor status.', 'p53 in breast cancer subtypes and new insights into response to chemotherapy.', 'Should mutant TP53 be targeted for cancer therapy?', 'Clinical characteristics and outcomes of phase I cancer patients with CCNE1 amplification: MD Anderson experiences.', 'Sample-Specific Perturbation of Gene Interactions Identifies Pancreatic Cancer Subtypes.', 'Sample-specific perturbation of gene interactions identifies breast cancer subtypes.', 'TP53 Mutation Analysis in Gastric Cancer and Clinical Outcomes of Patients with Metastatic Disease Treated with Ramucirumab/Paclitaxel or Standard Chemotherapy.', 'Phase I studies of vorinostat with ixazomib or pazopanib imply a role of antiangiogenesis-based therapy for TP53 mutant malignancies.']"""

Some previous studies have linked the usage of COX-2 inhibiting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with a decreased prostate cancer risk. We estimated the association between cumulative COX-2 inhibition by NSAID usage and prostate cancer risk at population level. All new prostate cancer cases in Finland during 1995-2002 and matched controls (24,657 case-control pairs) were identified from national registries. Detailed information on medication purchases was obtained from a national prescription database. A total cumulative COX-2 inhibition value was calculated based on total cumulative mg amount of each NSAID drug and the drug-specific COX-1/COX-2 inhibition ratio. Prostate cancer risk was analysed with propensity score-matched conditional logistic regression model. In total, 53.8% of the cases and 46.5% of the controls had any prescription-use of NSAIDs, while 8.1% and 7.9%, respectively, had used aspirin. Compared to the non-users, any NSAID use was associated with an elevated overall prostate cancer risk (46.4% versus 53.6%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 1.4) and risk of advanced cancer (11.8% versus 14.1%; OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5, 1.8). The risk remained elevated despite the amount of cumulative COX-2 inhibition. In a separate analysis, the risk increase was similar for each NSAID with the exception of aspirin, which was associated with a decreased overall prostate cancer risk (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84, 0.96) in a dose-dependent fashion. NSAID use is associated with an increased prostate cancer risk at the population level regardless of the COX-2 inhibition. This may be explained by systematic differences between prescription NSAID users and non-users. In contrast, aspirin use is associated with a decreased overall prostate cancer risk. Further studies on aspirin and prostate cancer will be needed.""","""['Thea Veitonmäki', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Anssi Auvinen', 'Teemu J Murtola']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['A large cohort study of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prostate cancer incidence.', 'Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prostate cancer survival in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Cancer Death in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Aspirin, ibuprofen, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in cancer prevention: a critical review of non-selective COX-2 blockade (review).', 'A comparison of the cost-effectiveness of five strategies for the prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal toxicity: a systematic review with economic modelling.', 'Anesthesia and Oncology: Friend or Foe?', 'Risks of solid cancers in elderly persons with osteoarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.', 'Effect of ASA on pituitary adenomas: is it a matter of survivin?', 'The Biological Significance and Regulatory Mechanism of c-Myc Binding Protein 1 (MBP-1).', 'Intake of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

Findings from a UK Survey to evaluate the impact of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines on the management of prostate cancer""","""Aims:   Although the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical guideline 58 (CG58) for prostate cancer management was expected to have a positive effect, several recommendations raised concern among UK physicians. We conducted a survey of UK oncologists in 2008 and a second, similar survey in 2010 to assess views on these recommendations and to evaluate the change in opinion over time.  Materials and methods:   Two semi-structured questionnaires were issued by the British Uro-oncology Group to society members in September 2008 and October 2010.  Results:   In 2008, 61 UK oncologists completed the survey; 60% agreed that CG58 would make a positive contribution towards improving patient care. There was strong opposition towards active surveillance as the first-line treatment for men with low-risk localised prostate cancer (49% disagreement); implementing 5 yearly flexible sigmoidoscopy post-prostate radiotherapy (51% disagreement); offering follow-up outside of the hospital (e.g. by general practitioners in primary care) for men with a stable prostate-specific antigen for ≥2 years (44% disagreement); and recommendations against docetaxel retreatment (47% disagreement) or bisphosphonate use (58% disagreement). In 2010, 77 UK oncologists completed the survey. The results were largely consistent with 2008, although several recommendations, particularly for localised disease, seem to have promoted a change in clinical practice, suggesting that they are facilitating a standardised approach. Compared with 2008, the 2010 results indicate a shift in favour of active surveillance (80% agreement) and primary care follow-up (59% agreement), but increasing opposition for docetaxel retreatment (57% disagreement). Opinions remained divided for flexible sigmoidoscopy and bisphosphonates.  Conclusions:   Despite initial concerns, the CG58 seems to have had a positive impact on prostate cancer management in the UK, with adherence likely facilitating a standardised approach. However, with new data emerging, these findings underscore the need to regularly update guidelines.

Thus, we applied information theory on classification and regression tree (CART) analysis for decision making predicting the probability of a biopsy result at various PSA concentrations.  Methods:   From 2007 to 2009, prostate biopsies were performed in 664 referred patients in a tertiary hospital. We created 2 CART models based on the information theory: one for moderate uncertainty (PSA concentration: 2.5-10 ng/ml) and the other for high uncertainty (PSA concentration: 10-25 ng/ml).  Results:   The CART model for moderate uncertainty (n=321) had 3 splits based on PSA density (PSAD), hypoechoic nodules, and age and the other CART for high uncertainty (n=160) had 2 splits based on prostate volume and percent-free PSA. In this validation set, the patients (14.3% and 14.0% for moderate and high uncertainty groups, respectively) could avoid unnecessary biopsies without false-negative results.  Conclusions:   Using these CART models based on uncertainty information of PSA, the overall reduction in unnecessary prostate biopsies was 14.0-14.3% and CART models were simplified. Using uncertainty of laboratory results from information theoretic approach can provide additional information for decision analysis such as CART.""","""['Sang-Hyun Hwang', 'Tina Pyo', 'Heung-Bum Oh', 'Hyun Jun Park', 'Kwan-Jeh Lee']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Chim Acta""","""['The value of percent free prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen density of the whole prostate and of the transition zone in Turkish men.', 'Improved detection of prostate cancer using classification and regression tree analysis.', 'Classification and regression tree analysis for the prediction of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy.', 'Predictive modeling for the presence of prostate carcinoma using clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound parameters in patients with prostate specific antigen levels < or = 10 ng/mL.', 'Optimal predictors of prostate cancer on repeat prostate biopsy: a prospective study of 1,051 men.']"""

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a well known implication of radical prostatectomy (RP). Despite the search for technical improvement in the surgical procedure (e.g. nerve-sparing surgery, robot-assisted RP), many patients still suffer from an inability to achieve a satisfactory erection after surgery. In the last 20 years a great effort has been made to re-establish good sexual function in these patients. Many different approaches have been used, such as intracavernous prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, vacuum devices and penile prostheses. Although many studies have addressed the main questions about efficacy of different approaches to ED, there is a lack of data about adherence to therapy and the main reasons why patients drop out of these treatment programmes. In the present study, a cohort of men treated with RP underwent a postoperative rehabilitation protocol with PGE1 intracavernous injections. During the follow-up period, we were able to assess a real-life practice pattern of adherence and dropout, evaluating the main causes of therapy discontinuation. This could be of help in the counselling of these patients during the path towards erection recovery.  Objectives:   • To assess the rate of compliance in the first 6 months of a rehabilitation protocol that includes intracavernous alprostadil administration in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy. • To determine the reasons for and timings of dropout from the protocol by the patients and their subsequent outcomes.  Patients and methods:   • All patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2009 were considered for a protocol of postoperative intracavernous sexual rehabilitation and were administered entry questionnaires to evaluate their preoperative sexual activity. • Four weeks after surgery, the patients were invited to return for a first visit, where the aim of the protocol and possible risks and benefits were explained. For those who agreed to attend, subsequent visits to include assisted self-administration of increasing doses of intracavernous alprostadil and a period of autonomous homely self-administration were planned. • Patients were followed up at 3-month intervals, where data on functional outcomes, patient satisfaction, and the number of patients who dropped out and their reasons, were recorded by means of appropriate questionnaires. • Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test or a chi-squared test, where appropriate.  Results:   • Of 430 patients, 157 (36.5%) refused to undergo the protocol of rehabilitation and 18.6% of the patients who began the protocol dropped out over the first 6 months. • Reasons for refusal were: patient's lack of sexual interest (51.6%); lack of interest by the partner (30.2%); and presence of transitory incontinence (26.7%). • Reasons for dropout were: disappointment with treatment efficacy (64.7%); injection pain (45%); and difficulties with or fear of performing the injection by themselves or by the partner (35.2%). No patient claimed the cost of the drug to be a cause for dropout.  Conclusions:   • The protocol we used, involving intracavernous alprostadil injection, proved to be a safe and efficient way of achieving sexual rehabilitation in patients who have undergone RP. Nevertheless, high patient motivation and adherence to the protocol were required. • Factors influencing patients refusal and early-to-medium time dropout were both patient- and partner-related. Appropriate information, counselling and support of the couple before the beginning and at all stages of the rehabilitation play a fundamental role in reducing the dropout rate. • The situation regarding those patients who still need adjuvant therapy after surgery is less clear and further research on this is required.""","""['Massimo Polito', ""Gianluca d'Anzeo"", 'Alessandro Conti', 'Giovanni Muzzonigro']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Optimal strategy for penile rehabilitation after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy based on preoperative erectile function.', 'Predicting participation in and successful outcome of a penile rehabilitation programme using a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor with a vacuum erection device after radical prostatectomy.', 'Evaluation of erectile function after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in a single center.', 'Penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy: what the evidence really says.', 'Current status of penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy.', 'The Role of Prostaglandin E1 as a Pain Mediator through Facilitation of Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channel 2 via the EP2 Receptor in Trigeminal Ganglion Neurons of Mice.', ""Men's beliefs about treatment for erectile dysfunction-what influences treatment use?

This common clinical problem is diagnosed by history, including the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire, and physical examination by digital rectal examination (DRE). Initial management for BPH includes lifestyle modification, and smooth muscle relaxant alpha blocker therapy. Alpha blockers usually take effect quickly within 3-5 days, and have minimal side effects. Current commonly used alpha blockers include the selective alpha blockers tamsulosin (Flomax), alfusosin (Xatral), and silodosin (Rapaflo). For patients with larger prostates, the 5-alpha reductase inhibitor class (finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart)) work effectively to shrink prostate stroma resulting in improved voiding. The 5-ARI class of drugs, in addition to reducing prostate size, also reduce the need for future BPH-related surgery, and reduce the risk of future urinary retention. Drugs from the phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor class may now be considered for treating BPH. Once daily 5 mg tadalafil has been shown to improve BPH-related symptoms and is currently approved to treat patients with BPH. Referral to a urologist can be considered for patients with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA), especially while on 5-ARI, failure of urinary symptom control despite maximal medical therapy, suspicion of prostate cancer, hematuria, recurrent urinary infections, urinary retention, or renal failure.

Rat aortic ring assay showed that quercetin at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited microvessel sprouting and exhibited a significant inhibition in the proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells, which are key events in the process of angiogenesis. Most importantly, quercetin treatment inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM) and matrigel plug assay. Western blot analysis showed that quercetin suppressed VEGF induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream protein kinases AKT, mTOR, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase in HUVECs. Quercetin (20 mg/kg/d) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors in prostate xenograft mouse model, indicating that quercetin inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis. Furthermore, quercetin reduced the cell viability and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, which were correlated with the downregulation of AKT, mTOR and P70S6K expressions.

We evaluated the toxicity and biodistribution of C4 in rats with the goal of simulating the systemic effects of potential leakage from C4 MRI markers within the prostate.  Methods and materials:   9-μL doses (equivalent to leakage from 120 markers in a human) of control solution (0.9% sodium chloride), 1% (proposed for clinical use), and 10% C4 solution were injected into the prostates of male Sprague-Dawley rats via laparotomy. Organ toxicity and cobalt disposition in plasma, tissues, feces, and urine were evaluated.  Results:   No C4-related morbidity or mortality was observed in the biodistribution arm (60 rats). Biodistribution was measurable after 10% C4 injection: cobalt was cleared rapidly from periprostatic tissue; mean concentrations in prostate were 163 μg/g and 268 μg/g at 5 and 30 minutes but were undetectable by 60 minutes. Expected dual renal-hepatic elimination was observed, with percentages of injected dose recovered in tissues of 39.0 ± 5.6% (liver), >11.8 ± 6.5% (prostate), and >5.3 ± 0.9% (kidney), with low plasma concentrations detected up to 1 hour (1.40 μg/mL at 5-60 minutes). Excretion in urine was 13.1 ± 4.6%, with 3.1 ± 0.54% recovered in feces by 24 hours. In the toxicity arm, 3 animals died in the control group and 1 each in the 1% and 10% groups from surgical or anesthesia-related complications; all others survived to scheduled termination at 14 days. No C4-related adverse clinical signs or organ toxicity were observed.  Conclusion:   C4-related toxicity was not observed at exposures at least 10-fold the exposure proposed for use in humans. These data demonstrating lack of systemic toxicity with dual routes of elimination in the event of in situ rupture suggest that C4 warrants further investigation as an MRI marker for prostate brachytherapy.""","""['Steven J Frank', 'Mary J Johansen', 'Karen S Martirosyan', 'Mihai Gagea', 'Carolyn S Van Pelt', 'Agatha Borne', 'Yudith Carmazzi', 'Timothy Madden']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Toxicity Evaluation of a Novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging Marker, CoCl2-N-Acetylcysteine, in Rats.', 'MRI characterization of cobalt dichloride-N-acetyl cysteine (C4) contrast agent marker for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Anisotropy characterization of I-125 seed with attached encapsulated cobalt chloride complex contrast agent markers for MRI-based prostate brachytherapy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers for MRI-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy: novel marker-flange for cervical cancer and marker catheters for prostate cancer.', 'A comprehensive review of prostate cancer brachytherapy: defining an optimal technique.', 'Fully Balanced SSFP Without an Endorectal Coil for Postimplant QA of MRI-Assisted Radiosurgery (MARS) of Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Study.', 'The Effect of Electrode Topography on the Magnetic Properties and MRI Application of Electrochemically-Deposited, Synthesized, Cobalt-Substituted Hydroxyapatite.', 'Toxicity Evaluation of a Novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging Marker, CoCl2-N-Acetylcysteine, in Rats.', 'Reactive Oxygen Species Generation in Human Cells by a Novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent.', 'Permanent prostate brachytherapy postimplant magnetic resonance imaging dosimetry using positive contrast magnetic resonance imaging markers.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the impact of NS approaches on perioperative, pathologic, and functional outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   Five hundred one potent (Sexual Health Inventory for Men [SHIM] score >21) men underwent bilateral full NS and were followed up for a minimum of 1 yr. After propensity score matching, 344 patients were selected and were then categorized into two groups.  Surgical procedure:   RARP with antegrade NS (n=172) or RARP with retrograde NS (n=172).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Functional outcomes were assessed using validated questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied.  Results and limitations:   Positive margin rates were similar (11.1% vs 6.9%; p=0.192), and no correlation with the NS approach was found on regression analysis. At 3, 6, and 9 mo, the potency rate was significantly higher in the retrograde approach (65% vs 80.8% and 72.1% vs 90.1% and 85.3% vs 92.9%, respectively). The multivariable model indicated that the NS approach was an independent predictor for potency recovery at 3, 6, and 9 mo, along with age, gland size, and hyperlipidemia. After adjusting for these predictors, the hazard ratio (HR) for the retrograde relative to the antegrade approach was 2.462 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.482-4.089; p=0.001) at 3, 4.024 (95% CI, 2.171-7.457; p<0.001) at 6, and 2.145 (95% CI, 1.019-4.514; p=0.044) at 9 mo. Regarding continence, the recovery rates at each time point and the mean time to regaining it were similar, and the method of NS had no effect on multivariable analysis. The absence of randomization is a major limitation of this study.

During multistep carcinogenesis, cytodifferentiation of malignant/premalignant cells into more mature or normal-like cells, has become an attractive modality of treatment and promises to be a less toxic and a more specific targeting strategy than conventional chemotherapy. In this study we investigated the capacity of a polyphenol, ellagic acid (EA), to induce differentiation of two prostate cancer cell lines: LnCap and DU145.  Methods:   NED markers, Chromogranin A (CgA) and p75NGFR levels were evaluated by immunocytochemistry. DNA methyltransferase- 1 (DNMT-1) and phospho-Rb (p-Rb) expression were evaluated by western blotting. Akt activation was evaluated by ELISA. Finally the ability of EA to induce DNA damage in cancer cells was examined using the COMET assay.  Results:   Treatment with EA significantly reduced CgA levels and increased p75NGFR expression. Moreover p-Rb, DNMT-1 levels and Akt activation/phosphorylation were decreased. EA treatment induced, in a dose-dependent manner, a marked increase in DNA damage, both in LnCap and DU145 cell lines.  Conclusions:   The results of this study demonstrate that EA treatment represents a new approach and highly effective strategy in reducing carcinogenesis. Therefore, EA may be considered in a promising new class of cancer therapeutic agent, with both antiproliferative and pro-differentiation properties.""","""['Luca Vanella', 'Ignazio Barbagallo', 'Rosaria Acquaviva', 'Claudia Di Giacomo', 'Venera Cardile', 'Nader G Abraham', 'Valeria Sorrenti']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Des""","""['Impact of Cellular Genetic Make-up on Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines Response to Ellagic Acid: Implications of Small Interfering RNA.', 'Ellagic acid, a component of pomegranate fruit juice, suppresses androgen-dependent prostate carcinogenesis via induction of apoptosis.', 'Evaluating the effects of ellagic acid on pSTAT3, pAKT, and pERK1/2 signaling pathways in prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'Ellagic acid inhibits proliferation and induced apoptosis via the Akt signaling pathway in HCT-15 colon adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Serotonin activates MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Effects of Mangiferin on LPS-Induced Inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 Viral Adsorption in Human Lung Cells.', 'Molecular interaction studies on ellagic acid for its anticancer potential targeting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3.', 'The polyphenol/saponin-rich Rhus tripartita extract has an apoptotic effect on THP-1 cells through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Milk thistle seed cold press oil attenuates markers of the metabolic syndrome in a mouse model of dietary-induced obesity.', 'Chemical composition of cold-pressed blackberry seed flour extract and its potential health-beneficial properties.']"""

Further understanding of how obesity and diabetes affect the PSA concentration may improve our ability to detect clinically relevant prostate tumors. This study examined the relationships among serum PSA level, obesity, and diabetes in apparently healthy Japanese males. We analyzed the baseline data from 2,172 Japanese males (age, 56.8 +/- 6.1 years [mean +/- SD]) who participated in the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. Diabetes was defined as the presence of both a hemoglobin A1c (JDS) of > or = 6.1% and a fasting plasma glucose level of > or = 126 mg/dL, or a positive medical history. After adjusting for age, the PSA levels were elevated among males with a higher normal BMI (ranging from 23.0 to 24.9) and lowered among men with a BMI of > or = 25.0. In the stratified analysis, these significant differences in BMI categories were absent among diabetics. The mean PSA levels were significantly lower in diabetics than in non-diabetics among subjects aged 60 and over.

The principles of thematic analysis and template approach were used in this study. The survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Results:   Trust was a major theme that emerged from the semistructured interviews. The men listed trust in the health care provider as the primary reason for choosing a collaborative or active role in the decision-making process. Within the theme of trust, 4 subthemes emerged: expertise, information sharing, active listening, and relationship length. Thirty-five out of the 40 men interviewed preferred an active or collaborative role in the decision-making process; only 5 preferred passive decision making.  Conclusions:   Trust emerged as an important factor that influenced role preference for African American men when making health care decisions in the context of the patient-provider relationship.

Results:   Fatal outcome and/or disease progression occurred in 29 out of 126 patients (23%). High risk patients were significantly more frequent in the TAB+RT group (p=0.04). Mortality rate was not different in both groups indicating that better results of treatment were achieved in patients treated with TAB+RT. Metabolic syndrome appeared in 51.6% of TAB patients and in 51.1 of TAB+RT patients, and was significantly more frequent at the end of the follow-up than at the beginning of the treatment (p=0.003 in TAB and p=0.01 in TAB+RT group). Urinary symptoms were more frequent than digestive symptoms in both groups. The quality of life was slightly improved after the beginning of therapy to be followed by the tendency of gradual decrease.  Conclusion:   Both modalities of treatment were efficient.

Here, we describe the use of oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h109 encoding GLAF-1 for canine cancer therapy. In this study we analyzed the virus-mediated delivery and production of scAb GLAF-1 and the oncolytic and immunological effects of the GLV-1h109 vaccinia virus strain against canine soft tissue sarcoma and canine prostate carcinoma in xenograft models. Cell culture data demonstrated that the GLV-1h109 virus efficiently infect, replicate in and destroy both tested canine cancer cell lines. In addition, successful expression of GLAF-1 was demonstrated in virus-infected canine cancer cells and the antibody specifically recognized canine VEGF. In two different xenograft models, the systemic administration of the GLV-1h109 virus was found to be safe and led to anti-tumor and immunological effects resulting in the significant reduction of tumor growth in comparison to untreated control mice. Furthermore, tumor-specific virus infection led to a continued production of functional scAb GLAF-1, resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis. Overall, the GLV-1h109-mediated cancer therapy and production of immunotherapeutic anti-VEGF scAb may open the way for combination therapy concept i.e. vaccinia virus mediated oncolysis and intratumoral production of therapeutic drugs in canine cancer patients.""","""['Sandeep S Patil', 'Ivaylo Gentschev', 'Marion Adelfinger', 'Ulrike Donat', 'Michael Hess', 'Stephanie Weibel', 'Ingo Nolte', 'Alexa Frentzen', 'Aladar A Szalay']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Preclinical Testing Oncolytic Vaccinia Virus Strain GLV-5b451 Expressing an Anti-VEGF Single-Chain Antibody for Canine Cancer Therapy.', 'Evaluation of a new recombinant oncolytic vaccinia virus strain GLV-5b451 for feline mammary carcinoma therapy.', 'Anti-VEGF single-chain antibody GLAF-1 encoded by oncolytic vaccinia virus significantly enhances antitumor therapy.', 'Progress in gene therapy using oncolytic vaccinia virus as vectors.', 'Oncolytic virotherapy in veterinary medicine: current status and future prospects for canine patients.', 'Tumor-associated macrophages: Prognostic and therapeutic targets for cancer in humans and dogs.', 'Design Strategies and Precautions for Using Vaccinia Virus in Tumor Virotherapy.', 'Viro-antibody therapy: engineering oncolytic viruses for genetic delivery of diverse antibody-based biotherapeutics.', 'Beyond cancer cells: Targeting the tumor microenvironment with gene therapy and armed oncolytic virus.', 'Biodistribution Analysis of Oncolytic Adenoviruses in Canine Patient Necropsy Samples Treated with Cellular Virotherapy.']"""

Small membrane-bound vesicles called exosomes, secreted from the endosomal membrane compartment, contain RNA and protein that they readily transport via exosome internalization into recipient cells. Recent progress has shown that tumor-derived exosomes play multiple roles in tumor growth and metastasis and may produce these functions via immune escape, tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Furthermore, exosome analysis may provide novel biomarkers to diagnose or monitor PCa treatment.  Methods:   Exosomes were purified from the plasma and serum from 39 PCa patients, 20 BPH patients, 8 prostate cancer recurrent and 16 healthy controls using ultracentrifugation and their quantities and qualities were quantified and visualized from both the plasma and the purified exosomes using ELISA and Western blotting, respectively.  Results:   Survivin was significantly increased in the tumor-derived samples, compared to those from BPH and controls with virtually no difference in the quantity of Survivin detected in exosomes collected from newly diagnosed patients exhibiting low (six) or high (nine) Gleason scores. Exosome Survivin levels were also higher in patients that had relapsed on chemotherapy compared to controls.  Conclusions:   These studies demonstrate that Survivin exists in plasma exosomes from both normal, BPH and PCa subjects. The relative amounts of exosomal Survivin in PCa plasma was significantly higher than in those with pre-inflammatory BPH and control plasma. This differential expression of exosomal Survivin was seen with both newly diagnosed and advanced PCa subjects with high or low-grade cancers. Analysis of plasma exosomal Survivin levels may offer a convenient tool for diagnosing or monitoring PCa and may, as it is elevated in low as well as high Gleason scored samples, be used for early detection.""","""['Salma Khan', 'Jessica M S Jutzy', 'Malyn May A Valenzuela', 'David Turay', 'Jonathan R Aspe', 'Arjun Ashok', 'Saied Mirshahidi', 'Dan Mercola', 'Michael B Lilly', 'Nathan R Wall']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Tumor-Derived Exosomal Long Noncoding RNAs as Promising Diagnostic Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Increased PSA expression on prostate cancer exosomes in in\xa0vitro condition and in cancer patients.', 'Correlation of serum β2-microglobulin levels with prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, clinical stage, tumor metastasis and therapy efficacy in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection and Prognosis: From Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) to Exosomal Biomarkers.', 'Circulating microRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer: Current status and future perspectives.', 'Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) in Tumor Diagnosis and Therapy.', 'Exosomes: a potential diagnostic and treatment modality in the quest for counteracting cancer.', 'Quantitative Proteomics for the Identification of Differentially Expressed Proteins in the Extracellular Vesicles of Cervical Cancer Cells.', 'Exosome-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Review of the Literature, Prospectives, and Hopes for Clinical Application.', 'Progress of Endogenous and Exogenous Nanoparticles for Cancer Therapy and Diagnostics.']"""

Although absent from most normal adult tissues, DLX4 is widely expressed in leukemia, lung, breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. However the molecular targets, mechanisms and pathways that mediate the role of DLX4 in tumor metastasis are poorly understood. In this study, we found that DLX4 induces cancer cells to undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through TWIST. Overexpression of DLX4 increased expression of TWIST expression in cancer cell lines, resulting in increased migratory and invasive capacity. Likewise, knocking down expression of DLX4 decreased TWIST expression and the migration ability of cancer cell lines. DLX4 bound to regulatory regions of the TWIST gene. Both western blotting and immunohistochemistry staining showed that the expression of DLX4 and TWIST are correlated in most of breast tumors. Taken together, these data from both cell models and tumor tissues demonstrate that DLX4 not only upregulates TWIST expression but also induces EMT and tumor metastasis. Altogether, we propose a new pathway in which DLX4 drives expression of TWIST to promote EMT, cancer migration, invasion and metastasis.""","""['Lianmei Zhang', 'Manman Yang', 'Lin Gan', 'Tao He', 'Xiuli Xiao', 'M David Stewart', 'Xiaoyan Liu', 'Luquan Yang', 'Tiandan Zhang', 'Yongxiang Zhao', 'Junjiang Fu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""['STAT3 cooperates with Twist to mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Thymoquinone inhibits cancer metastasis by downregulating TWIST1 expression to reduce epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'Hypoxia induces TWIST-activated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in\xa0vitro and in nude mice.', 'AKT-ions with a TWIST between EMT and MET.', 'A new paradigm for mechanobiological mechanisms in tumor metastasis.', 'Identification and validation of DLX4 as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Effect of DPP4/CD26 expression on SARS‑CoV‑2 susceptibility, immune response, adenosine (derivatives m62A and CD) regulations on patients with cancer and healthy individuals.', 'The regulation of ISG20 expression on SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients and healthy individuals.', 'The speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) inhibits breast cancer malignancy by destabilizing TWIST1.', 'Comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of lncRNA-mediated ceRNA network for uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.']"""

Cabazitaxel showed linear pharmacokinetics and a terminal elimination half-life comparable with that of docetaxel, findings which support dosing as a single infusion in three-week treatment cycles. Dose-ranging studies recommended doses of 20 or 25 mg/m(2) every three weeks. Antitumor activity was shown in patients with advanced cancer and chemotherapy failure (including taxane failure). Other early studies investigated the efficacy of cabazitaxel in pretreated metastatic breast cancer, either as a single agent or in combination with capecitabine.

The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to provide risk estimates for these less common cancers in proven carriers of pathogenic mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6.  Patients and methods:   Data were pooled from the German and Dutch national Lynch syndrome registries. Seven different cancer types were analyzed: stomach, small bowel, urinary bladder, other urothelial, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. Age-, sex- and MMR gene-specific cumulative risks (CRs) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Sex-specific incidence rates were compared with general population incidence rates by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of sex and mutated gene on cancer risk.  Results:   The cohort comprised 2,118 MMR gene mutation carriers (MLH1, n = 806; MSH2, n = 1,004; MSH6, n = 308). All cancers were significantly more frequent than in the general population. The highest risks were found for male small bowel cancer (SIR, 251; 95% CI, 177 to 346; CR at 70 years, 12.0; 95% CI, 5.7 to 18.2). Breast cancer showed an SIR of 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.4) and a CR of 14.4 (95% CI, 9.5 to 19.3).

Few epidemiologic studies have examined the relationship between cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), another major neurodegenerative disease. This study addresses that gap.  Methods:   Using data from 16 population-based cancer registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute and death certificates, we followed 2.7 million cancer survivors who were diagnosed between 1973 and 2007, and who survived at least 1 year following cancer diagnosis. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of observed to expected ALS deaths in cancer survivors was calculated.  Results:   A total of 1,216 ALS deaths were reported among 1 year survivors of cancer over 16.6 million person-years of follow-up. ALS mortality was not significantly associated with the incidence of total cancers [SMR = 1.00 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.95-1.06)].

Conclusions:   Cancer at certain sites may be related to risk of ALS death. Possible biologic factors linking ALS to these cancers are discussed.

Moreover, correlations between SENP1 protein expression, clinicopathologic features, and prognosis were statistically analyzed.  Results:   Three CaP cells, DU145, PC-3, and LNCaP had overexpression of SENP1 mRNA and protein, while the nontransformed immortalized prostate cell RWPE-1 had relatively weak SENP1 expression.

Black men have a higher incidence and mortality from PCa than Caucasians. We hypothesized that despite ADT, strength training (ST) would increase muscle power and size, thereby improving body composition, physical function, fatigue levels, and QoL in older black men with PCa.  Methods:   Muscle mass, power, strength, endurance, physical function, fatigue perception, and QoL were measured in 17 black men with PCa on ADT before and after 12 weeks of ST. Within-group differences were determined using t tests and regression models.  Results:   ST significantly increased total body muscle mass (2.7%), thigh muscle volume (6.4%), power (17%), and strength (28%). There were significant increases in functional performance (20%), muscle endurance (110%), and QoL scores (7%) and decreases in fatigue perception (38%). Improved muscle function was associated with higher functional performance (R (2) = 0.54) and lower fatigue perception (R (2) = 0.37), and both were associated with improved QoL (R (2) = 0.45), whereas fatigue perception tended to be associated with muscle endurance (R (2) = 0.37).  Conclusions:   ST elicits muscle hypertrophy even in the absence of testosterone and is effective in counteracting the adverse functional consequences of ADT in older black men with PCa. These improvements are associated with reduced fatigue perception, enhanced physical performance, and improved QoL. Thus, ST may be a safe and well-tolerated therapy to prevent the loss of muscle mass, strength, and power commonly observed during ADT.""","""['Erik D Hanson', 'Andrew K Sheaff', 'Suchi Sood', 'Lei Ma', 'Jack D Francis', 'Andrew P Goldberg', 'Ben F Hurley']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci""","""['Muscle function, physical performance and body composition changes in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Can supervised exercise prevent treatment toxicity in patients with prostate cancer initiating androgen-deprivation therapy: a randomised controlled trial.', 'Long-term effects of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Does Use of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in Men with Prostate Cancer Increase the Risk of Sarcopenia?', 'The role of exercise in the management of adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a rapid review.', 'Feasibility of home-based exercise training during adjuvant treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (EXACT).', 'Home-based exercise improves quality of life in breast and prostate cancer survivors: A meta-analysis.', 'Prognostic Impact of Sarcopenia in Patients with Advanced Prostate Carcinoma: A Systematic Review.', 'A Randomized Trial of the Effects of Dietary n3-PUFAs on Skeletal Muscle Function and Acute Exercise Response in Healthy Older Adults.', 'UPDATE - Canadian Urological Association guideline on androgen deprivation therapy: Adverse events and management strategies.']"""

We reviewed retrospectively the case records of 41 patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer from 2005 to 2010 at our institution. All abnormal symptoms were developed during the 30 days after the operation. Complications were noted as well as their severity according to the Clavien grading system. No conversion to open surgery was necessary in all cases. The median postoperative hospital stay was 10 days (range 9-16). The median duration of bladder catheterization was 8 days (range 7-35). There was no case of multiple-organ dysfunction or death. Minor complications constituted 82.6% of all complications. The incidence of severe complications was 17.4%. LRP displayed some advantages over open surgery in the perioperative period. Our complication rates were significantly higher than those indicated in the series previously reported.

Increased tumor levels of CRM-1 have been correlated with poor prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer, making it a therapeutic target. Selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) bind to CRM-1 to irreversibly inhibit its ability to export proteins; we investigated a new class of SINEs in pancreatic cancer cells.  Methods:   We studied the effects of SINE analogs in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines and nontransformed human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells using proliferation, apoptosis, immunoblot, co-immunoprecipitation, small inhibitor RNA, and fluorescence microscopy analyses. The effects of the SINEs also were investigated in mice with subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors.  Results:   SINEs (KPT-185, KPT-127, KPT-205, and KPT-227) inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells, but did not affect human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. The nuclei of cells incubated with KPT-185 accumulated tumor-suppressor proteins (p27, FOXO, p73, and prostate apoptosis response-4 [PAR-4]) and inhibited interactions between CRM-1 and these proteins. Mutations in the region of CRM-1 that bind to SINEs (Cys-528), or small inhibitor RNA knockdown of PAR-4, prevented the ability of KPT-185 to block proliferation and induce apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. Oral administration of KPT-330 to mice reduced growth of subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft tumors without major toxicity. Analysis of tumor remnants showed that KPT-330 disrupted the interaction between CRM-1 and PAR-4, activated PAR-4 signaling, and reduced proliferation of tumor cells.  Conclusions:   We identified SINEs that inhibit CRM-1 and promote nuclear accumulation of tumor-suppressor proteins in pancreatic cancer cells.

However, to our knowledge it is unknown how accurately the freehand, transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy cores are placed in the prostate and how the geometric distribution of biopsy cores may affect the prostate cancer detection rate.  Materials and methods:   To determine the geometric distribution of cores, we developed a biopsy simulation system with pelvic mock-ups and an optical tracking system. Mock-ups were biopsied in a freehand manner by 5 urologists and by our transrectal ultrasound robot, which can support and move the transrectal ultrasound probe. We compared 1) targeting errors, 2) the accuracy and precision of repeat biopsies, and 3) the estimated significant prostate cancer (0.5 cm(3) or greater) detection rate using a probability based model.  Results:   Urologists biopsied cores in clustered patterns and under sampled a significant portion of the prostate. The robot closely followed the predefined biopsy schema. The mean targeting error of the urologists and the robot was 9.0 and 1.0 mm, respectively. Robotic assistance significantly decreased repeat biopsy errors with improved accuracy and precision. The mean significant prostate cancer detection rate of the urologists and the robot was 36% and 43%, respectively (p <0.0001).  Conclusions:   Systematic biopsy with freehand transrectal ultrasound guidance does not closely follow the sextant schema and may result in suboptimal sampling and cancer detection. Repeat freehand biopsy of the same target is challenging. Robotic assistance with optimized biopsy schemas can potentially improve targeting, precision and accuracy.

Another variant, AR-V1, interferes with AR-V7 activity. We investigated whether AR-V7 or V1 expression would predict biochemical recurrence in men at indeterminate (about 50%) risk for progression following radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   AR-V7 and V1 transcripts in a mixed grade cohort of 53 men in whom cancer contained 30% to 70% Gleason grade 4/5 and in a grade 3 only cohort of 52 were measured using a branched chain DNA assay. Spearman rank correlations of the transcripts, and histomorphological and clinical variables were determined. AR-V7 and V1 levels were assessed as determinants of recurrence in the mixed grade cohort by logistic regression and survival analysis. The impact of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion on prognosis was also evaluated.  Results:   Neither AR-V7 nor V1 levels in grade 3 or 4/5 cancer in the mixed grade cohort were associated with recurrence or time to recurrence. However, AR-V7 and V1 inversely correlated with serum prostate specific antigen and positively correlated with age. The AR-V1 level in grade 3 cancer in the grade 3 only cohort was higher than in grade 3 or grade 4/5 components of mixed grade cancer. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was not associated with AR-V7, AR-V1 or recurrence but it was associated with the percent of grade 4/5 cancer.

We investigated whether the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan) and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (LC Laboratories, Woburn, Massachusetts) would synergistically cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   LNCaP, PC-3 and DU 145 cells (ATCC™) were treated with vorinostat and/or bortezomib. Cell viability and induction of apoptosis were assessed. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in a murine subcutaneous tumor model using PC-3 cells. The influence of androgen receptor expression on bortezomib efficacy was examined using RNA interference. Changes in the expression of ubiquitinated proteins, cell cycle associated proteins and acetylated histone were evaluated.  Results:   Androgen receptor expression seemed to decrease bortezomib activity. PC-3 and DU 145 cells were more susceptible to bortezomib than LNCaP cells and the silencing of androgen receptor expression in LNCaP cells enhanced bortezomib activity. Vorinostat and bortezomib synergistically induced apoptosis, inhibited prostate cancer cell growth and suppressed tumor growth in a murine xenograft model. The combination decreased cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression, and increased p21 expression. The combination synergistically caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and histone acetylation. This histone acetylation was a consequence of the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins.

Moreover, low ghrelin levels observed in obese people may be implicated in cancer development and progression. The aim of this study was to examine the direct effects of both forms of ghrelin (acylated and unacylated) and ghrelin receptor type 1a antagonist (D-Lys-GHRP-6) on the growth of murine colon cancer MC38 and human prostate cancer DU145 cell lines in vitro.  Methods:   The cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of rat or human acylated ghrelin (rG, hG), human unacylated ghrelin (hUAG), D-Lys-GHRP-6 (GHS-RA) applied either alone or jointly. The cell line growth was assessed by the colorimetric Mosmann method.  Results:   hUAG (10(-6), 10(-7) and 10(-10) M) inhibited MC38 cancer cell growth and, at some concentrations (10(-8), 10(-9), 10(-10) M), enhanced the antineoplastic effect of GHS-RA(10(-4) M). In turn, GHS-RA evoked a biphasic effect on MC38 cancer growth: inhibitory at 10(-4) M and stimulatory at 10(-5) and 10(-6) M. Moreover, GHS-RA at the highest examined concentration (10(-4) M) enhanced the cytostatic effect of FU. Human acylated and unacylated ghrelin and GHS-RA inhibited DU145 cancer growth with moderate and different potencies. A dose-response effect was observed for the inhibitory action of hG together with the synergistic effect of hUAG and GHS-RA.  Conclusion:   The obtained results indicate an involvement of the ghrelin axis in the growth regulation of colon and prostate cancers and may suggest new therapeutic options for these neoplasms.""","""['Hanna Lawnicka', 'Gabriela Mełeń-Mucha', 'Ewelina Motylewska', 'Sławomir Mucha', 'Henryk Stępień']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Pharmacol Rep""","""['D-Lys(3)-GHRP-6 antagonizes the effect of unacylated but not of acylated ghrelin on the growth of HECa10 murine endothelial cells.', 'Acylated and unacylated ghrelin protect MC3T3-E1 cells against tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced oxidative injury: pharmacological characterization of ghrelin receptor and possible epigenetic involvement.', 'Ghrelin and its unacylated isoform stimulate the growth of adrenocortical tumor cells via an anti-apoptotic pathway.', 'Ghrelin and prostate cancer.', 'Ghrelin and growth hormone secretagogues (GHS): modulation of growth hormone secretion and therapeutic applications.', 'Enteroendocrine Cells Protect the Stem Cell Niche by Regulating Crypt Metabolism in Response to Nutrients.', 'Role of the Ghrelin System in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Diverse and Complementary Effects of Ghrelin and Obestatin.', 'Ghrelin and Cancer: Examining the Roles of the Ghrelin Axis in Tumor Growth and Progression.', 'Ghrelin and its role in gastrointestinal tract tumors (Review).']"""

These relationships were investigated in the non-malignant RWPE-1 cells that were 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) responsive (RWPE-1) and malignant cell lines that were 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) partially responsive (RWPE-2) and resistant (PC-3). These studies revealed that selective attenuation and repression of VDR transcriptional responses in the cancer cell lines reflected their loss of antiproliferative sensitivity. This was evident in VDR target genes including VDR, CDKN1A (encodes p21( (waf1/cip1) )) and GADD45A; NCOR1 knockdown alleviated this malignant transrepression. ChIP assays in RWPE-1 and PC-3 cells revealed that transrepression of CDKN1A was associated with increased NCOR1 enrichment in response to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. These findings supported the concept that retained and increased NCOR1 binding, associated with loss of H3K9ac and increased H3K9me2, may act as a beacon for the initiation and recruitment of DNA methylation. Overexpressed histone methyltransferases (KMTs) were detectable in a wide panel of prostate cancer cell lines compared with RWPE-1 and suggested that generation of H3K9me2 states would be favored. Cotreatment of cells with the KMT inhibitor, chaetocin, increased 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated induction of CDKN1A expression supporting a role for this event to disrupt CDKN1A regulation. Parallel surveys in PC-3 cells of CpG methylation around the VDR binding regions on CDKN1A revealed altered basal and VDR-regulated DNA methylation patterns that overlapped with VDR-induced recruitment of NCOR1 and gene transrepression. Taken together, these findings suggest that sustained corepressor interactions with nuclear-resident transcription factors may inappropriately transform transient-repressive histone states into more stable and repressive DNA methylation events.""","""['Craig L Doig', 'Prashant K Singh', 'Vineet K Dhiman', 'James L Thorne', 'Sebastiano Battaglia', 'Michelle Sobolewski', 'Orla Maguire', ""Laura P O'Neill"", 'Bryan M Turner', 'Christopher J McCabe', 'Dominic J Smiraglia', 'Moray J Campbell']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Elevated NCOR1 disrupts PPARalpha/gamma signaling in prostate cancer and forms a targetable epigenetic lesion.', 'Epigenetic distortion to VDR transcriptional regulation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Epigenetic control of a VDR-governed feed-forward loop that regulates p21(waf1/cip1) expression and function in non-malignant prostate cells.', 'DNA methylation-related vitamin D receptor insensitivity in breast cancer.', 'Epigenetic corruption of VDR signalling in malignancy.', 'Advances in Antimicrobial Peptide Discovery via Machine Learning and Delivery via Nanotechnology.', 'Relevance of Vitamin D and Its Deficiency for the Ovarian Follicle and the Oocyte: An Update.', 'Nuclear Receptors and Lipid Sensing.', 'Nuclear Receptor Coregulators in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.', '1α,25(OH)2D3 reverses exhaustion and enhances antitumor immunity of human cytotoxic T cells.']"""

We have explored the potential of a novel cytokine, interleukin-27 (IL-27), for inhibiting this malignant crosstalk, and have examined the effect of autocrine IL-27 on prostate cancer cell gene expression, as well as the effect of paracrine IL-27 on gene expression in bone and T cells. In prostate tumor cells, IL-27 upregulated genes related to its signaling pathway while downregulating malignancy-related receptors and cytokine genes involved in gp130 signaling, as well as several protease genes. In both undifferentiated and differentiated osteoblasts, IL-27 modulated upregulation of genes related to its own signaling pathway as well as pro-osteogenic genes. In osteoclasts, IL-27 downregulated several genes typically involved in malignancy and also downregulated osteoclastogenesis-related genes. Furthermore, an osteogenesis-focused real-time PCR array revealed a more extensive profile of pro-osteogenic gene changes in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In T-lymphocyte cells, IL-27 upregulated several activation-related genes and also genes related to the IL-27 signaling pathway and downregulated several genes that could modulate osteoclastogenesis.

Methods:   The ""FDG-PET cancer screening program"" included both FDG-PET and positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) with or without other combined screening tests that were performed for cancer screening in asymptomatic subjects. A total of 155,456 subjects who underwent the FDG-PET cancer screening program during 2006-2009 were analyzed.  Results:   Of the 155,456 subjects, positive findings suggesting possible cancer were noted in 16,955 (10.9 %).

Objective:   The aim of this study was to compare the changes in QoL over time of prostate cancer patients who were treated with open RP (ORP) or laparoscopic RP (LRP) procedures.  Methods:   A longitudinal study design was used. A convenient sample of 67 prostate cancer patients was recruited after RP (ORP = 34, LRP = 33). QoL scores were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after RP using the University of California, Los Angeles, Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI).  Results:   With respect to the PCI mean score between the ORP and LRP groups, there were significant differences in overall PCI and urinary function at time 1 (1 month after RP). However, a mixed-design analysis of covariance on the overall PCI of the 2 groups over time indicated that, after controlling for nerve sparing, there were significant differences in the main effects for group and time, but no interaction effect.  Conclusion:   Results indicated that all patients' QoL scores improved over time. Laparoscopic RP patients' overall scores were better than ORP patients' scores, but this may be due to unmeasured preoperative differences in this nonrandom sample, and thus, these findings cannot be attributed to treatment differences alone.

Methods:   We investigated associations of circulating IGFs and IGFBPs with PSA measures using multilevel models, in 909 men (recruited between 1999 and 2009) with PSA-detected clinically localized prostate cancer undergoing active monitoring in the United Kingdom. Each man had an average of 14 measurements of PSA during a mean of 4-year follow-up.  Results:   IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were not associated with baseline PSA. There was weak evidence that IGF-I at diagnosis was positively associated with a rapid post-diagnosis PSADT (≤4 years vs. >4 years): OR 1.34 (95 % CI 0.98, 1.81) per SD increase in IGF-I. IGFBP-2 increased by 2.1 % (95 % CI 1.4, 2.8) per year between 50 and 70 years, with no association between serial IGFBP-2 levels and PSADT. There was no evidence that serum IGF-II, IGFBP-2, or IGFBP-3, or post-diagnosis IGFBP-2, were associated with PSA kinetics in men with PSA-detected localized prostate cancer.

Moreover, induction of GRP78 by a variety of anti-cancer drugs, including histone deacetylase inhibitors, confers chemoresistance to cancer, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. Thus, therapies aimed at decreasing GRP78 levels, which results in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and resensitization of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs may hold promise for cancer treatment. Despite advances in our understanding of GRP78 actions, little is known about endogenous inhibitors controlling its expression. As endogenous regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in modulating gene expression; therefore, we sought to identify miRNA(s) that target GRP78, under the hypothesis that these miRNAs may serve as therapeutic agents. Here, we report that three miRNAs (miR-30d, miR-181a, miR-199a-5p) predicted to target GRP78 are down-regulated in prostate, colon and bladder tumors, and human cancer cell lines. We show that in C42B prostate cancer cells, these miRNAs down-regulate GRP78 and induce apoptosis by directly targeting its 3' untranslated region. Importantly, we demonstrate that the three miRNAs act cooperatively to decrease GRP78 levels, suggesting that multiple miRNAs may be required to efficiently control the expression of some genes. In addition, delivery of multiple miRNAs by either transient transfection or lentivirus transduction increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, in C42B, HCT116 and HL-60 cells. Together, our results indicate that the delivery of co-transcribed miRNAs can efficiently suppress GRP78 levels and GRP78-mediated chemoresistance, and suggest that this strategy holds therapeutic potential.""","""['S-F Su', 'Y-W Chang', 'C Andreu-Vieyra', 'J Y Fang', 'Z Yang', 'B Han', 'A S Lee', 'G Liang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['The deoxycholic acid targets miRNA-dependent CAC1 gene expression in multidrug resistance of human colorectal cancer.', 'miR-199a-5p and miR-495 target GRP78 within UPR pathway of lung cancer.', 'microRNA-199a-5p protects hepatocytes from bile acid-induced sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'miR-30d-5p: A Non-Coding RNA With Potential Diagnostic, Prognostic and Therapeutic Applications.', 'MicroRNAs and drug resistance in prostate cancers.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tocotrienol-Mediated Anticancer Properties: A Systematic Review of the Involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Unfolded Protein Response.', 'MicroRNAs in Age-Related Proteostasis and Stress Responses.', 'LINP1 represses unfolded protein response by directly inhibiting eIF2α phosphorylation to promote cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.', 'MiR-181a-5p inhibits uveal melanoma development by targeting GNAQ and AKT3.', 'miR-145-5p: A Potential Biomarker in Predicting Gleason Upgrading of Prostate Biopsy Samples Scored 3+3=6.']"""

In KT, the type of cancer with the highest incidence was posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD, 1.58%), followed by lung (1.12%), prostate (0.82%), and kidney (0.79%) cancers; in LT, PTLD (2.44%), lung and bronchial (2.18%), primary hepatic (0.91%), and prostate (0.88%) cancers; in HT, lung and bronchial (3.24%) and prostate (3.07%) cancers, and PTLD (2.24%); and in LuT, lung and bronchial cancers (5.94%), PTLD (5.72%), and colorectal cancer (1.38%). PTLD, Kaposi sarcoma, and lung and bronchial cancers were increased in all SOTs, when compared with an older (55- to 59-year-old) population.  Conclusions:   Cancer incidence is different among solid organ transplantations, and ratios may be higher than those in the 55- to 59-year-old population.""","""['Marcelo Santos Sampaio', 'Yong W Cho', 'Yasir Qazi', 'Suphamai Bunnapradist', 'Ian V Hutchinson', 'Tariq Shah']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Transplantation""","""['De novo malignancies after kidney and liver transplantations: experience on 582 consecutive cases.', 'Incidence of post-transplant malignancy among 674 solid-organ-transplant recipients at a single center.', 'Pretransplantation seronegative Epstein-Barr virus status is the primary risk factor for posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder in adult heart, lung, and other solid organ transplantations.', 'Burden of de novo malignancy in the liver transplant recipient.', 'Posttransplant solid organ malignancies in lung transplant recipients: a single-center experience and review of the literature.', 'Incidence and Prognosis of Colorectal Cancer After Heart Transplantation: Data From the Spanish Post-Heart Transplant Tumor Registry.', 'Current status of liver transplantation for non-B non-C liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Characteristics and Outcome of Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorders After Solid Organ Transplantation: A Single Center Experience of 196 Patients Over 30 Years.', 'Effects of solid organ transplantation on the risk of developing thyroid cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder Following Cardiac Transplantation.']"""

The height and refractive index of adhesive cells were determined using PLM and the height of PC-3 cells were apparently lower than those of PRECs, while there was no difference in refractive indices between PC-3 cells and PRECs.

Patients and methods:   MRI in Primary Prostate cancer after Exposure to Dutasteride (MAPPED) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, supported by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Men with prostate cancer suitable for active surveillance (low-intermediate risk prostate cancer on biopsy), and a visible lesion on T2-weighted MRI of at least 0.2 cc, were eligible for consideration. Forty-two men were randomised to 6 months of daily dutasteride 0.5mg or placebo. Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans were performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The percentage changes in cancer volume over time will be compared between the dutasteride and placebo groups. Planned analyses will examine the association between tumour volume and characteristics (perfusion and contrast washout) as seen on mpMRI, HistoScan ultrasound and biopsy histopathology in both groups.  Discussion:   MAPPED is the first randomised controlled trial to use mpMRI to look at the effect of dutasteride on the volume of prostate cancer. If dutasteride is shown to reduce the volume of prostate cancer, it might be considered as an adjunct for men on active surveillance. Analysis of the placebo arm will allow us to comment on the short-term natural variability of the MR appearance in men who are not receiving any treatment.

Methods:   A prospective assessment of outcomes in 300 consecutive patients that underwent a RARP performed by a single surgeon. Patients were grouped according to D'Amico risk criteria: Group I consisted of 'low-risk' cases (n = 64), Group II consisted of 'intermediate-risk' cases (n = 88), and Group III consisted of 'high-risk' cases (n = 148). Patients were evaluated for perioperative complications and the trifecta outcome.  Results:   The operation time, blood loss, post-operative stay, duration of urethral catheterization, and perioperative complication rate were similar among all groups. The incidence of bilateral neurovascular bundle (NVB) preservation was significantly decreased with the increasing risk of cases (P < 0.001). The continence rates at the 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups did not differ significantly between groups. The potency rates at the 12-month follow-up were not significantly different. The positive surgical margin and positive lymph node metastasis rate increased with the increasing risk of cases (P < 0.001). The biochemical recurrence rate (BCR, PSA >0.2 ng/mL) was 3.1, 11.36, and 19.59% in Groups I, II and III, respectively (P = 0.004). The trifecta outcome for RARP with bilateral NVB preservation showed no significant differences among groups.

Materials and methods:   After treating PC3 and DU-145 cells with simvastatin, cell viability and apoptosis were determined using tetrazolium salt based colorimetric assay and annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining assay, respectively. To determine whether simvastatin affects the nuclear factor-κB pathway, we assessed IκBα and phosphorylated IκBα expression, and p65 and phosphorylated p65 subcellular localization by Western blot analysis. Also, changes in nuclear factor-κB transcriptional activity were assessed using a luciferase reporter assay.  Results:   After treating PC3 and DU-145 cells with 0, 20 or 40 μM simvastatin for 24, 48 or 72 hours, the proportion of viable cells decreased and the proportion of apoptotic cells increased in a dose and time dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed that simvastatin inhibited IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. It also demonstrated that simvastatin increased p65 protein levels in cytoplasmic fractions and decreased phosphorylated p65 protein levels in nuclear fractions but did not change p65 protein levels in cytoplasm. Luciferase reporter assay showed that simvastatin dose dependently reduced nuclear factor-κB activity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot revealed that simvastatin inhibited nuclear factor-κB regulated cIAP-1 and 2, cFLIP-S and XIAP expression in dose and time dependent fashion.  Conclusions:   Simvastatin inhibited castrate resistant prostate cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis. These effects were probably mediated by the inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p50/p65 dimer in the nuclear factor-κB pathway.""","""['Yong Hyun Park', 'Su Yeon Seo', 'Eunhye Lee', 'Ja Hyeon Ku', 'Hyeon Hoe Kim', 'Cheol Kwak']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Suppression of constitutive and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation and induction of apoptosis by apigenin in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells: correlation with down-regulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes.', 'Simvastatin in combination with bergamottin potentiates TNF-induced apoptosis through modulation of NF-κB signalling pathway in human chronic myelogenous leukaemia.', 'Curcumin 1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-6-heptadine-3,5-dione; C21H20O6 sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand/Apo2L-induced apoptosis by suppressing nuclear factor-kappaB via inhibition of the prosurvival Akt signaling pathway.', 'Simvastatin potentiates TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis through the down-regulation of NF-kappaB-dependent antiapoptotic gene products: role of IkappaBalpha kinase and TGF-beta-activated kinase-1.', 'A dietary anthocyanidin delphinidin induces apoptosis of human prostate cancer PC3 cells in vitro and in vivo: involvement of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling.', 'Simvastatin Induces Apoptosis And Suppresses Hepatocellular Carcinoma Induced In Rats.', 'Targeting Inflammatory Signaling in Prostate Cancer Castration Resistance.', 'The Role of Polymorphisms in Genes of PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway on Prostate.', 'Statins influence epithelial expression of the anti-microbial peptide LL-37/hCAP-18 independently of the mevalonate pathway.', 'Pravastatin alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced placental TLR4 over-activation and promotes uterine arteriole remodeling without impairing rat fetal development.']"""

We explored the role of extranodal extension, size of the largest metastatic lymph node and the largest metastasis, and lymph node density as predictors of biochemical recurrence.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed pathological material from 261 patients with node positive prostate cancer. We examined the predictive value when adding the additional pathology findings to a base model including extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, radical prostatectomy Gleason score, prostate specific antigen and number of positive lymph nodes using the Cox proportional hazards regression and Harrell concordance index.  Results:   The median number of lymph nodes removed was 14 (IQR 9, 20) and the median number of positive lymph nodes was 1 (IQR 1, 2). At a median followup of 4.6 years (IQR 3.2, 6.0) 155 of 261 patients experienced biochemical recurrence. The mean 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 39% (95% CI 33-46). Median diameter of the largest metastatic lymph node was 9 mm (IQR 5, 16). On Cox regression radical prostatectomy specimen Gleason score (greater than 7 vs 7 or less), number of positive lymph nodes (3 or greater vs 1 or 2), seminal vesicle invasion and prostate specific antigen were associated with significantly increased risks of biochemical recurrence. On subset analysis metastasis size significantly improved model discrimination (base model Harrell concordance index 0.700 vs 0.655, p = 0.032).

While recent studies suggest an advantage for perioperative complication rates, they fail to account for the volume-outcome relationship. We compared perioperative outcomes after robot-assisted and open radical prostatectomy, while considering the impact of this established relationship.  Materials and methods:   Using the NIS (Nationwide Inpatient Sample), we abstracted data on patients treated with radical prostatectomy in 2009. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done to compare the rates of blood transfusion, intraoperative and postoperative complications, prolonged length of stay, increased hospital charges and mortality between robot-assisted and open radical prostatectomy overall and across volume quartiles.  Results:   An estimated 77,616 men underwent radical prostatectomy, including a robot-assisted and an open procedure in 63.9% and 36.1%, respectively. Low volume centers averaged 26.2 robot-assisted and 5.2 open cases, while very high volume centers averaged 578.8 robot-assisted and 150.2 open cases. Overall, patients treated with the robot-assisted procedure experienced a lower rate of adverse outcomes than those treated with the open procedure for all measured categories. Across equivalent volume quartiles robot-assisted radical prostatectomy outcomes were generally favorable. However, the open procedure at high volume centers resulted in a lower postoperative complication rate (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46-0.75), elevated hospital charges (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64-0.87) and a comparable blood transfusion rate (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.93-2.02) relative to the robot-assisted procedure at low volume centers.  Conclusions:   Regionalization has occurred to a greater extent for robot-assisted than for open radical prostatectomy with an associated benefit in overall outcomes. Nonetheless, low volume institutions experienced inferior outcomes relative to the highest volume centers irrespective of approach.

Methods:   This randomised, phase 3, controlled trial recruited patients aged 75 years or younger with untreated cT0-3 prostate cancer (WHO performance status 0 or 1) from 37 institutions across Europe. Eligible patients were randomly assigned centrally (1:1) to postoperative irradiation (60 Gy of conventional irradiation to the surgical bed for 6 weeks) or to a wait-and-see policy until biochemical progression (increase in prostate-specific antigen >0·2 μg/L confirmed twice at least 2 weeks apart). We analysed the primary endpoint, biochemical progression-free survival, by intention to treat (two-sided test for difference at α=0.05, adjusted for one interim analysis) and did exploratory analyses of heterogeneity of effect. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00002511.  Findings:   1005 patients were randomly assigned to a wait-and-see policy (n=503) or postoperative irradiation (n=502) and were followed up for a median of 10·6 years (range 2 months to 16·6 years). Postoperative irradiation significantly improved biochemical progression-free survival compared with the wait-and-see policy (198 [39·4%] of 502 patients in postoperative irradiation group vs 311 [61·8%] of 503 patients in wait-and-see group had biochemical or clinical progression or died; HR 0·49 [95% CI 0·41-0·59]; p<0·0001). Late adverse effects (any type of any grade) were more frequent in the postoperative irradiation group than in the wait-and-see group (10 year cumulative incidence 70·8% [66·6-75·0] vs 59·7% [55·3-64·1]; p=0.001).  Interpretation:   Results at median follow-up of 10·6 years show that conventional postoperative irradiation significantly improves biochemical progression-free survival and local control compared with a wait-and-see policy, supporting results at 5 year follow-up; however, improvements in clinical progression-free survival were not maintained. Exploratory analyses suggest that postoperative irradiation might improve clinical progression-free survival in patients younger than 70 years and in those with positive surgical margins, but could have a detrimental effect in patients aged 70 years or older.

However, extended PBx, a common diagnostic procedure, has a limited predictive ability for lobes without significant cancer.  Objective:   To identify prostate lobes without significant cancer using extended PBx combined with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which has the potential to provide pathophysiologic information on pretreatment assessment.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a prebiopsy DWI study between 2007 and 2012 that included 270 prostate lobes in 135 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for clinically localized PCa.  Intervention:   Participants underwent DWI and 14-core PBx; those with PBx-proven PCa and who were treated with RP were analyzed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Imaging and pathology were assessed in each side. Based on RP pathology, lobes were classified into lobes with no cancer (LNC), lobes with indolent cancer (LIC), and lobes with significant cancer (LSC). Predictive performance of DWI, PBx, and their combination in identifying lobes without significant cancer was examined.  Results and limitations:   LNC, LIC, and LSC were identified in 23 (8.5%), 64 (23.7%), and 183 sides (67.8%), respectively. The negative predictive values (NPV) of DWI, PBx, and their combination were 22.1%, 27.8%, and 43.5%, respectively, for lobes with any cancer (ie, either LIC or LSC), and 68.4%, 72.2%, and 95.7%, respectively, for LSC. The NPV of PBx for LSC was improved by the addition of DWI findings (p=0.001), with no adverse influence on the positive predictive value. Limitations included a possible selection bias under which the decision to perform PBx might be affected by DWI findings.  Conclusions:   The combination of DWI and extended PBx efficiently predicts lobes without significant cancer.

Within 15 yr of diagnosis, most deaths among men with prostate cancer (PCa) can be attributed to other competing causes. However, data from studies with extended follow-up are insufficient to determine appropriate treatment for men with localized disease.  Objective:   To investigate the long-term natural history of untreated, early-stage PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a population-based, prospective-cohort study using a consecutive sample of 223 patients with untreated, localized PCa from a regionally well-defined catchment area in central Sweden. All subjects were initially managed with observation. Androgen deprivation therapy was administered when symptomatic tumor progression occurred.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Based on >30 yr of follow-up, the main outcome measures were: progression-free, cause-specific, and overall survival, and rates of progression and mortality per 1000 person-years.  Results and limitations:   After 32 yr of follow-up, all but 3 (1%) of the 223 men had died. We observed 90 (41.4%) local progression events and 41 (18.4%) cases of progression to distant metastasis. In total, 38 (17%) men died of PCa. Cause-specific survival decreased between 15 and 20 yr, but stabilized with further follow-up. All nine men with Gleason grade 8-10 disease died within the first 10 yr of follow-up, five (55%) from PCa. Survival for men with well-differentiated, nonpalpable tumors declined slowly through 20 yr, and more rapidly between 20 and 25 yr (from 75.2% [95% confidence interval, 48.4-89.3] to 25% [95% confidence interval, 22.0-72.5]). It is unclear whether these data are relevant for tumors detected by elevated prostate-specific antigen levels.

The ability of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion biopsy to detect these occult prostate lesions may make it an effective tool in this challenging scenario.  Materials and methods:   Between March 2007 and November 2011 all men underwent prostate 3 T endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging. All concerning lesions were targeted with magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion biopsy. In addition, all patients underwent standard 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsy. Men with 1 or more negative systematic prostate biopsies were included in our cohort.  Results:   Of the 195 men with previous negative biopsies, 73 (37%) were found to have cancer using the magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion biopsy combined with 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsy. High grade cancer (Gleason score 8+) was discovered in 21 men (11%), all of whom had disease detected with magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion biopsy. However, standard transrectal ultrasound biopsy missed 12 of these high grade cancers (55%). Pathological upgrading occurred in 28 men (38.9%) as a result of magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion targeting vs standard transrectal ultrasound biopsy. The diagnostic yield of combined magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion platform was unrelated to the number of previous negative biopsies and persisted despite increasing the number of previous biopsy sessions. On multivariate analysis only prostate specific antigen density and magnetic resonance imaging suspicion level remained significant predictors of cancer.

Although approximately 10% of prostate cancers originate in the transition zone, the benefit of transition zone biopsies may be limited. We evaluated the usefulness of transition zone biopsy in patients with prostate cancer enrolled in active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   Patients on active surveillance followed at our institution between 1993 and 2011 were identified in the urological oncology database. All surveillance biopsies were stratified by transition and peripheral zone pathology results. The usefulness of transition zone biopsy was assessed by whether transition zone specific cancer characteristics, eg volume and grade, changed disease management recommendations.  Results:   A single surgeon performed a total of 244 prostate biopsies in 92 men. Each patient underwent initial positive prostate biopsy and at least 1 active surveillance prostate biopsy. Mean age was 69 years. A mean of 2.7 biopsies were done per patient. Nine patients (10%) had positive transition zone cores on initial positive prostate biopsy, of whom 3 had transition zone unique cancers. One of these patients showed transition zone disease progression on active surveillance prostate biopsy, which led to up staging and exclusion from active surveillance. A total of 16 patients (17%) had positive transition zone cores on active surveillance prostate biopsy, of whom 13 had a negative transition zone on initial positive prostate biopsy. Transition and peripheral zone Gleason scores were identical in 9 of these patients and the transition zone score was lower in 4. Thus, transition zone pathology did not result in up staging or disease management alterations in any patient with new transition zone pathology.  Conclusions:   Up staging due to transition zone specific pathology is exceedingly rare.

By default, nodal recurrence of prostate cancer is treated with palliative antihormonal therapy, which causes serious side effects and invariably leads to the development of hormone refractory disease.  Materials and methods:   A total of 47 patients with nodal recurrence of prostate cancer based on evidence of (11)C-choline/(18)F-choline ((18)F-fluorethylcholine) positron emission tomography-computerized tomography underwent primary (2 of 52), secondary (45 of 52), tertiary (4 of 52) and quaternary (1 of 52) salvage lymph node dissection with histological confirmation. Of 52 salvage lymph node dissections 27 were followed by radiotherapy. Biochemical response was defined as a prostate specific antigen less than 0.2 ng/ml after salvage therapy. The Kaplan-Meier method, binary logistic regression and Cox regression were used to analyze survival as well as predictors of biochemical response and clinical progression.  Results:   Mean prostate specific antigen at salvage lymph node dissection was 11.1 ng/ml. A mean of 23.3 lymph nodes were removed per salvage lymph node dissection. Median followup was 35.5 months. Of 52 salvage lymph node dissections 24 resulted in complete biochemical response followed by 1-year biochemical recurrence-free survival of 71.8%. Gleason 6 or less (OR 7.58, p = 0.026), Gleason 7a/b (OR 5.91, p = 0.042) and N0 status at primary therapy (OR 8.01, p = 0.011) were identified as independent predictors of biochemical response. Gleason 8-10 (HR 3.5, p = 0.039) as a preoperative variable, retroperitoneal positive lymph nodes (HR 3.76, p = 0.021) and incomplete biochemical response (HR 4.0, p = 0.031) were identified as postoperative predictors of clinical progression. Clinical progression-free survival was 25.6% and cancer specific survival was 77.7% at 5 years.  Conclusions:   Based on (11)C/(18)F-choline positron emission tomography-computerized tomography as a diagnostic tool, salvage lymph node dissection is feasible for the treatment of nodal recurrence of prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Between 1999 and 2007 a total of 1,656 patients with prostate cancer underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy at the Charité Berlin. There were 322 patients excluded from analysis for a variety of reasons. The final 1,334 patients had prostate specific antigen, free prostate specific antigen, prostate volume and complete pathological analysis available.  Results:   Median followup was 60.3 months (range 0.2 to 135). Median age (63 years, range 43 to 75) did not differ between the 1,092 patients without and the 242 with biochemical recurrence (p = 0.956), but prostate volume, prostate specific antigen and percent free prostate specific antigen differed significantly (p <0.0001). While prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density increased significantly in patients with Gleason less than 7, 7 and greater than 7 tumors, percent free prostate specific antigen decreased significantly (p <0.0001). Prostate specific antigen, percent free prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density differed significantly between pT2 and pT3 tumors, and between patients with vs without positive surgical margins. On univariate analysis Gleason sum, pathological stage, positive surgical margin, total prostate specific antigen, percent free prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density were predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified Gleason sum, pathological stage, positive surgical margin and prostate specific antigen density as independent predictors of biochemical recurrence-free survival, while percent free prostate specific antigen and total prostate specific antigen failed to be significant.  Conclusions:   Few models for prostate cancer prognosis include prostate specific antigen density. There is substantial value in prostate specific antigen density but not in percent free prostate specific antigen for improving prostate cancer prognosis and biochemical recurrence prediction.""","""['Jonas Busch', 'Kristin Hamborg', 'Hellmuth-Alexander Meyer', 'John Buckendahl', 'Ahmed Magheli', 'Michael Lein', 'Klaus Jung', 'Kurt Miller', 'Carsten Stephan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Percent of cores positive for cancer is a better preoperative predictor of cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy than prostate specific antigen.', 'Length of positive surgical margin after radical prostatectomy as a predictor of biochemical recurrence.', 'Preoperative serum prostate specific antigen does not reflect biochemical failure rates after radical prostatectomy in men with large volume cancers.', 'Comparison of preoperative prostate specific antigen density and prostate specific antigen for predicting recurrence after radical prostatectomy: results from the search data base.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Specific Antigen Density and PI-RADSv2 score help identify Apical Prostate Cancer.', 'The Impact of Gleason Grade 3 as a Predictive Factor for Biochemical Recurrence after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study in Japan (The MSUG94 Group).', 'Clinical stage provides useful prognostic information even after pathological stage is known for prostate cancer in the PSA era.', 'Performance characteristics of prostate-specific antigen density and biopsy primary Gleason score to predict biochemical failure in patients with intermediate prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy.', 'Diagnostic value of MRI-based PSA density in predicting transperineal sector-guided prostate biopsy outcomes.']"""

We examined long-term weight gain by age group in men on androgen deprivation therapy for up to 36 months.  Materials and methods:   Three cohorts matched by age and education were recruited in this prospective study, including men in whom continuous androgen deprivation therapy was initiated, controls with prostate cancer and healthy controls. All patients with prostate cancer had nonmetastatic disease. We performed age stratified (less than 65 vs 65 years or greater) comparisons. Univariate and multivariable associations with weight change with time were evaluated using linear regression.  Results:   We included 257 men with a mean age of 69.1 years. At baseline the cohorts were similar in age, education, body mass index, weight and comorbidity. Androgen deprivation therapy was associated with weight gain from baseline at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months compared to controls with prostate cancer and healthy controls (p = 0.006, 0.015, 0.028, 0.003, 0.014 and 0.0004, respectively). The proportion of men who gained weight was higher among androgen deprivation therapy users than controls with prostate cancer and healthy controls at most time points. Age stratified analyses showed that younger patients (age less than 65 years) on androgen deprivation therapy had significantly greater weight gain with time than older patients (4.7 vs 1.4 kg, p = 0.005). However, age did not appear to affect weight change with time in men not on androgen deprivation therapy (p = 0.37).

Microarray analysis revealed 99 genes showing statistically significant differences among tumors with Gleason scores of 6, 7, and ≥8. In addition, mRNA expression of 29 selected genes was analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR with microfluidic cards in an extended series of 30 prostate tumors. Of the 29 genes, 18 (62%) were independently confirmed in the extended series by quantitative RT-PCR: 14 were up-regulated and 4 were down-regulated in tumors with a higher Gleason score. Twelve of these genes were differentially expressed in tumors with a Gleason score of 6 to 7 versus ≥8. Finally, IHC validation of the protein levels of two genes from the 12-gene signature (SEC14L1 and TCEB1) showed strong protein expression levels of both genes, which were statistically associated with a high combined Gleason score, advanced stage, and prostate-specific antigen progression.

There is incomplete knowledge of PSA testing patterns.  Objective:   Determine the prevalence of PSA testing and explore patterns of PSA retesting in Stockholm County, Sweden.  Design, setting, and participants:   A population-based study was performed. Through registry linkages, we collected population information, data on PSA tests, pathology reports, and clinical information. The study population comprised males living in Stockholm County in 2011 (n=1034129), of which 229 872 had a PSA test during the period 2003-2011.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We determined limited-duration-point prevalence of PSA testing and performed survival analysis on PSA retesting for men aged 40-89 yr.  Results and limitations:   The number of PSA tests increased from 54239 in 2003 to 124613 in 2011. During the 9-yr study period, 46%, 68%, and 77% of men without a prior prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and aged 50-59 yr, 60-69 yr, and 70-79 yr, respectively, had a PSA test. During 2010 and 2011, 25%, 40%, and 46% of men aged 50-59 yr, 60-69 yr, and 70-79 yr, respectively, had a PSA test. The prevalence of PSA testing increased from 2003 to 2011. The probability of retesting was PSA and age dependent, with a 26-mo cumulative incidence of 0.337 (95% confidence interval, 0.333-0.341) if the first PSA value was <1 ng/ml. The main limitations were (1) that PSA data prior to 2003 were not available and (2) that the study cohort was restricted to men who were alive in 2011.  Conclusions:   Although screening for PCa is not recommended in Sweden, PSA testing in Stockholm County was high across ages ranging from 40 to 89 yr and increased during the period 2003-2011. The probability of PSA retesting was high, regardless of the original PSA level.

In each era, there were significant differences in progression-free, metastasis-free and cancer specific survival by D'Amico risk groups. In multivariable models considering prostatectomy features, pathological stage and grade were significantly associated with the risk of metastatic progression and disease specific mortality.  Conclusions:   Excellent prostate cancer specific survival was demonstrated up to 30 years after surgery. Clinical risk categories and pathological tumor features were significant predictors of long-term disease specific outcomes, supporting their ongoing use in risk stratification and management decisions.

Materials and methods:   Of 953 consecutive patients presenting for followup after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy 703 (74%) completed validated measures of health related quality of life and treatment decisional regret. Baseline functional measures were assessed with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men and International Prostate Symptom Score. Questionnaires were administered a median of 11.1 months (IQR 4.6-26.1) after surgery. Clinicopathological, perioperative and functional outcomes were analyzed with univariable and multivariable models to examine associations with patient decisional regret.  Results:   Of the patients 88% did not regret the decision to undergo robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. Baseline health related quality of life, specifically baseline incontinence and superior erectile function, independently predicted increased postoperative decisional regret. In addition, older age, postoperative incontinence measured by pad use, postoperative erectile dysfunction and longer time from surgery were independent predictors of increased decisional regret. Preoperative cancer risk, and histopathological and short-term biochemical outcomes were unrelated to decisional regret.  Conclusions:   Decisional regret following robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy is independently predicted by age, baseline urinary and erectile function, perioperative outcomes, and postoperative urinary and erectile function.

The DDC gene encodes L-DOPA decarboxylase, an enzyme catalyzing the decarboxylation of L-DOPA to dopamine. We have recently shown that DDC mRNA is a significant predictor of patients' prognosis in colorectal adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer. The aim of the current study was to analyze the DDC mRNA expression in HNSCC patients.  Methods:   53 malignant tumors were resected from the larynx, pharynx, tongue, buccal mucosa, parotid glands, and nasal cavity, as well as from 34 adjacent non-cancerous tissues of HNSCC patients, and were homogenized. Total RNA was isolated and converted into first-strand cDNA. An ultrasensitive real-time PCR method based on the SYBR Green chemistry was used for DDC mRNA quantification in head and neck tissue specimens. Relative quantification was performed using the comparative Ct (2-ddCt) method.  Results:   DDC mRNA levels were lower in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the larynx and tongue than in adjacent non-cancerous tissue specimens. Furthermore, low DDC mRNA expression was noticed in laryngeal and tongue tumors of advanced TNM stage or bigger size, compared to early-stage or smaller tumors, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed between SCCs resected from pharynx, buccal mucosa, or nasal cavity, and their normal counterparts.

Material and methods:   Between January and December 2010, 57 RPE specimens were prospectively evaluated with regard to histological signs of chronic inflammation. This RPE group was compared to specimens of 82 men undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or transvesical enucleation (TVE) of a benign prostate (BPH group). To characterize inflammatory changes, inflammatory ""hot spots"" were defined according to the histological criteria of Irani et al. (J Urol 1997;157:1301-3). Total prostate-specific antigen (PSA), cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, International Prostate Symptom Score and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated preoperatively and were correlated to the histological findings.  Results:   Chronic inflammation was verified in 43.86% of the RPE group, compared to 70.74% of the BPH group (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis found a significant correlation between older patients and the inflammation score (p < 0.03) and prostate volume (p < 0.03). There was no difference in the PSA values between the inflammation and non-inflammation groups: mean PSA was 5.7 vs 6.1 ng/ml in the RPE group (p < 0.89), and 2.8 vs 2.9 ng/ml in the BPH group (p < 0.94). Gleason score distribution (5-9) and tumour stage (TNM) were similar in the inflammation and non-inflammation groups (p < 0.99, p < 0.21).  Conclusions:   No significant correlation between chronic prostatic inflammation and carcinoma of the prostate was detected.

The precise role that anti-DNA antibodies play in SLE pathophysiology remains to be elucidated, and potential applications of lupus autoantibodies in cancer therapy have not previously been explored. We report the unexpected finding that a cell-penetrating lupus autoantibody, 3E10, has potential as a targeted therapy for DNA repair-deficient malignancies. We find that 3E10 preferentially binds DNA single-strand tails, inhibits key steps in DNA single-strand and double-strand break repair, and sensitizes cultured tumor cells and human tumor xenografts to DNA-damaging therapy, including doxorubicin and radiation. Moreover, we demonstrate that 3E10 alone is synthetically lethal to BRCA2-deficient human cancer cells and selectively sensitizes such cells to low-dose doxorubicin. Our results establish an approach to cancer therapy that we expect will be particularly applicable to BRCA2-related malignancies such as breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. In addition, our findings raise the possibility that lupus autoantibodies may be partly responsible for the intrinsic deficiencies in DNA repair and the unexpectedly low rates of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers observed in SLE patients.

We achieved clinically relevant expansions of up to 18,485-fold total GDTc, with 18,849-fold expansion of the Vδ1 GDTc subset over 21 days.

GDTc cytotoxicity against PC-3M prostate cancer, U87 glioblastoma and EM-2 leukemia cells was confirmed. Both expanded Vδ1 and Vδ2 GDTc were cytotoxic to PC-3M in a T cell antigen receptor- and CD18-dependent manner. We are the first to label GDTc with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles for cellular MRI. Using protamine sulfate and magnetofection, we achieved up to 40 % labeling with clinically approved Feraheme (Ferumoxytol), as determined by enumeration of Perls' Prussian blue-stained cytospins. Electron microscopy at 2,800× magnification verified the presence of internalized clusters of iron oxide; however, high iron uptake correlated negatively with cell viability.

Multiplex and integrated methods that simultaneously measure multiple analytes and generate integrated information about these analytes from a single measurement are desirable because these methods help conserve precious samples. We developed a magnetic bead-based system for multiplex and integrated glycoprotein quantification by immunoassays and glycan detection by lectin immunosorbent assays (LISAs).  Methods:   Magnetic beads coupled with antibodies were used for capturing proteins of interest. Biotinylated antibodies in combination with streptavidin-labeled phycoerythrin were used for protein quantification. In the LISAs, biotinylated detection antibodies were replaced by biotinylated lectins for glycan detection.  Results:   Using tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidase 1 (TIMP-1), tissue plasminogen activator, membrane metallo-endopeptidase, and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) as models, we found that the multiplex integrated system was comparable to single immunoassays in protein quantification and LISAs in glycan detection. The merits of this system were demonstrated when applied to well-annotated prostate cancer tissues for validation of biomarkers in aggressive prostate cancer. Because of the system's multiplex ability, we used only 300 ng of tissue protein for the integrated detection of glycans in these proteins. Fucosylated TIMP-1 and DPP-4 offered improved performance over the proteins in distinguishing aggressive and nonaggressive prostate cancer.

Recent advances in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) have increased the interest in finding a reliable cell survival model, which will be accurate at high doses, as well. Different models have been proposed for improving descriptions of high dose survival responses, such as the Universal Survival Curve (USC), the Kavanagh-Newman (KN) and several generalizations of the LQ model, e.g. the Linear-Quadratic-Linear (LQL) model and the Pade Linear Quadratic (PLQ) model. The purpose of the present study is to compare a number of models in order to find the best option(s) which could successfully be used as a fractionation correction method in SRT. In this work, six independent experimental data sets were used: CHOAA8 (Chinese hamster fibroblast), H460 (non-small cell lung cancer, NSLC), NCI-H841 (small cell lung cancer, SCLC), CP3 and DU145 (human prostate carcinoma cell lines) and U1690 (SCLC). By detailed comparisons with these measurements, the performance of nine different radiobiological models was examined for the entire dose range, including high doses beyond the shoulder of the survival curves. Using the computed and measured cell surviving fractions, comparison of the goodness-of-fit for all the models was performed by means of the reduced χ (2)-test with a 95% confidence interval. The obtained results indicate that models with dose-independent final slopes and extrapolation numbers generally represent better choices for SRT. This is especially important at high doses where the final slope and extrapolation numbers are presently found to play a major role. The PLQ, USC and LQL models have the least number of shortcomings at all doses. The extrapolation numbers and final slopes of these models do not depend on dose. Their asymptotes for the cell surviving fractions are exponentials at low as well as high doses, and this is in agreement with the behaviour of the corresponding experimental data. This is an important improvement over the LQ model which predicts a Gaussian at high doses. Overall and for the highlighted reasons, it was concluded that the PLQ, USC and LQL models are theoretically well-founded. They could prove useful compared to the other proposed radiobiological models in clinical applications for obtaining uniformly accurate cell surviving fractions encountered in stereotactic high-dose radiotherapy as well as at medium and low doses.""","""['B Andisheh', 'M Edgren', 'Dž Belkić', 'P Mavroidis', 'A Brahme', 'B K Lind']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Universal survival curve and single fraction equivalent dose: useful tools in understanding potency of ablative radiotherapy.', 'Fitting the linear-quadratic model to detailed data sets for different dose ranges.', 'Compatibility of the linear-quadratic formalism and biologically effective dose concept to high-dose-per-fraction irradiation in a murine tumor.', 'Radiosensitivity of human cell lines to small doses.

Having two copies of UGT2B17 was associated with higher AAG levels in controls among Whites (p=0.02), but not Blacks (p=0.82).

QSOX1 participates in the folding and stability of proteins and thus could regulate the biological activity of its substrates in the secretory pathway and/or outside the cell. The involvement of QSOX1 in oncogenesis has been studied primarily in terms of its differential expression in systemic studies. QSOX1 is overexpressed in prostate cancers and in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In contrast, QSOX1 gene expression is repressed in endothelial tumors. In the present study, we investigated the role of QSOX1 in breast cancer.  Methods:   We analyzed QSOX1 mRNA expression in a cohort of 217 invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast. Moreover, we investigated QSOX1's potential role in regulating tumor growth and metastasis using cellular models in which we overexpressed or extinguished QSOX1 and xenograft experiments.  Results:   We showed that the QSOX1 expression level is inversely correlated to the aggressiveness of breast tumors. Our results show that QSOX1 leads to a decrease in cell proliferation, clonogenic capacities and promotes adhesion to the extracellular matrix. QSOX1 also reduces the invasive potential of cells by reducing cell migration and decreases the activity of the matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-2, involved in these mechanisms. Moreover, in vivo experiments show that QSOX1 drastically reduces the tumor development.

C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1), a transcriptional corepressor that regulates the expression of tumor suppressors and genes involved in cell death, is known to play a role in multiple cancers. In this study, we observed the overexpression and mislocalization of CtBP1 in metastatic prostate cancer and demonstrated the functional significance of CtBP1 in prostate cancer progression. Transient and stable knockdown of CtBP1 in prostate cancer cells inhibited their proliferation and invasion. Expression profiling studies of prostate cancer cell lines revealed that multiple tumor suppressor genes are repressed by CtBP1.

Materials and methods:   Seventeen patients enrolled on a prospective clinical trial where MRI was acquired every 2 weeks throughout eight weeks of image-guided prostate IMRT (78 Gy/39 fractions). ADC and T2 quantification used entire prostate, central gland, benign peripheral zone, and tumor-dense regions-of-interest, and mean values were evaluated for common response trends.  Results:   Overall, the RT responses were greater than volunteer measurement repeatability, and week 6 appeared to be an optimum time-point for early detection. RT effects on the entire prostate were best detected using ADC (5-7% by week 2, P < 0.0125), effects on peripheral zone were best detected using T2 (19% reduction at week 6; P = 0.004) and effects on tumors were best detected using ADC (14% elevation at week 6; P = 0.004).

Primary cell culture provides a model system that allows a broader spectrum of cell types from a greater number of patients to be studied, in the absence of artificially induced genetic mutations. Nevertheless, primary prostate epithelial cell culture can be technically challenging, even for laboratories experienced in immortalized cell culture. Therefore, we provide methods to isolate and culture primary epithelial cells directly from human prostate tissue. Initially, we describe the isolation of bulk epithelial cells from benign or tumor tissues. These cells have a predominantly basal/intermediate phenotype and co-express cytokeratin 8/18 and high molecular weight cytokeratins. Since prostatic stem cells play a major role in disease progression and are considered to be a therapeutic target, we also describe a prospective approach to specifically isolate prostatic basal cells that include both stem and transit-amplifying basal populations, which can be studied independently or subsequently differentiated to supply luminal cells. This approach allows the study of stem cells for the development of new therapeutics for prostate cancer.""","""['Birunthi Niranjan', 'Mitchell G Lawrence', 'Melissa M Papargiris', 'Michelle G Richards', 'Shirin Hussain', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'John Pedersen', 'Renea A Taylor', 'Gail P Risbridger']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Primary prostate cancer cultures are models for androgen-independent transit amplifying cells.', 'A novel neoplastic primary tumor-derived human prostate epithelial cell line.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Telomerase-immortalized non-malignant human prostate epithelial cells retain the properties of multipotent stem cells.', 'Primary cell cultures as models of prostate cancer development.', 'Sustained postconfluent culture of human mammary epithelial cells enriches\xa0for luminal and c-Kit+ subtypes.', 'Expanding the prostate cancer cell line repertoire with ACRJ-PC28, an AR-negative neuroendocrine cell line derived from an African-Caribbean patient.', 'Decellularized In Vitro Capillaries for Studies of Metastatic Tendency and Selection of Treatment.', 'Engineering Prostate Cancer from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells-New Opportunities to Develop Preclinical Tools in Prostate and Prostate Cancer Studies.', 'Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis identifies a putative epithelial stem cell population in human primary prostate cells in monolayer and organoid culture conditions.']"""

The expression and kinase activity of Aurora-A are up-regulated in multiple malignancies. Aurora-A is a key regulator of mitosis that localizes to the centrosome from the G2 phase through mitotic exit and regulates mitotic spindle formation as well as centrosome separation. Overexpression of Aurora-A in multiple malignancies has been linked to higher tumor grade and poor prognosis through mechanisms that remain to be defined. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we identified the protein nuclear mitotic apparatus (NuMA) as a robust substrate of Aurora-A kinase. Using a small molecule Aurora-A inhibitor in conjunction with a reverse in-gel kinase assay (RIKA), we demonstrate that NuMA becomes hypo-phosphorylated in vivo upon Aurora-A inhibition. Using an alanine substitution strategy, we identified multiple Aurora-A phospho-acceptor sites in the C-terminal tail of NuMA. Functional analyses demonstrate that mutation of three of these phospho-acceptor sites significantly diminished cell proliferation. In addition, alanine mutation at these sites significantly increased the rate of apoptosis. Using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that the NuMA T1804A mutant mis-localizes to the cytoplasm in interphase nuclei in a punctate pattern.

The authors designed a model to estimate the results of various doses of radiotherapy (RT) combined with various durations of ADT.  Methods:   From 1989 to 2007, 3215 men consecutively received definitive EDRT with or without ADT. In total, 2012 patients had complete records available for creating the nomogram. The duration of ADT varied for patients who received no RT (n = 1562), ≤6 months of RT (n = 145), from >6 months to <24 months of RT (n = 140), and ≥24 months of RT (n = 165) with a median follow-up of 65.7 months, 66.2 months, 60.1 months, and 63 months, respectively. The model included the following covariates: palpation T-category, biopsy Gleason score, the percentage of tumor cells with a Gleason pattern of 4 or 5, the percentage of tumor tissue, initial pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, ADT duration, and RT dose. Two nomograms, for outcomes with and without ADT, were created from a single competing-risks model. Biochemical failure was defined as a rise in serum PSA of 2 ng/mL over the post-treatment PSA nadir.  Results:   According to the results from analyzing representative intermediate-risk to high-risk patient parameters, the gains from increasing the RT dose from 70 Gray (Gy) to 80 Gy were far less than the gains from adding ≥3 months of ADT.  Conclusions:   The nomograms provided unique patient-specific estimates of the effects of various doses and durations of RT and ADT. The results indicated that adding ADT to treatment for intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer is far more beneficial than a modest RT dose escalation.""","""['Radka Stoyanova', 'Niraj H Pahlajani', 'Brian L Egleston', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'David Y T Chen', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Alan Pollack']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Dose escalation for prostate cancer radiotherapy: predictors of long-term biochemical tumor control and distant metastases-free survival outcomes.', 'Three linked nomograms for predicting biochemical failure in prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Prognostic value of biochemical response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation before external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review of the literature.', 'Optimizing androgen deprivation therapy with radiation therapy for aggressive localized and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Longitudinal Changes and Predictive Value of Multiparametric MRI Features for Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with MRI-Guided Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose (LEAD) Boost Radiotherapy.', 'Effects of dose-escalated radiotherapy in combination with long-term androgen deprivation on prostate cancer.', 'Clinical outcome and toxicity evaluation of simultaneous integrated boost pelvic IMRT/VMAT at different dose levels combined with androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Salvage Therapy Options for Local Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Primary Radiotherapy: a Literature Review.', 'Prospective Validation of Diagnostic Tumor Biomarkers in Men Treated With Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

The number of patients with BMs was constant: 241 patients in P1 and 249 in P2. The greatest changes in frequency between P1 and P2 involved colorectal cancer (+75.9 %), renal cancer (+141.9 %), and PC (+238.7 %). The total number of patients with BMs from PC was nine: two in P1 (0.8 %) and seven in P2 (2.8 %). All but two of these patients developed BMs after becoming castration-resistant. Median BM-free survival was 36 months, whereas median BM survival was 8 weeks.

RKIP has been assigned multiple functions and is associated with an increasing number of diseases through its involvement with signal transduction pathways. We previously demonstrated that RKIP is highly expressed in human normal prostate epithelial cells and plays a pivotal role during prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Whether RKIP is subject to endocrine regulation has not been reported.  Methods:   The effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on RKIP expression in normal prostate epithelial cells was determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. Report assay was performed to determine whether the regulation of RKIP by androgens is at the transcriptional level. The binding of androgen receptor (AR) to the RKIP promoter was determined by EMSA and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. To determine whether RKIP was regulated by androgen in vivo, we examined RKIP expression level in response to castration in 6-8 week old C57BL/6 male mice.  Results:   Here we report that DHT positively regulates the transcription of RKIP in the normal prostate epithelial cells. The anti-androgen bicalutamide blocked androgen-mediated regulation of RKIP, which indicates that this regulation is mediated through AR. Transfection of the cells with a RKIP promoter-driven luciferase reporter vector showed that DHT increased RKIP promoter activity in parallel with changes in expression. EMSA demonstrates that AR binds to a putative ARE in the RKIP promoter, which was further validated by ChIP assay. Importantly, these data are further supported by our in vivo experiment where castrated mice had less RKIP expression in their prostate glands than sham-operated mice.

Transcriptional activity of AR involves chromatin recruitment of co-activators, including the p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). Distinct miRNA expression profiles have been identified in PCa cells during the development and progression of the disease. Whether miRNAs regulate PCAF expression in PCa cells to regulate AR transcriptional activity is still unclear.  Methods:   Expression of PCAF was investigated in several PCa cell lines by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. The effects of PCAF expression on AR-regulated transcriptional activity and cell growth in PCa cells were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation, reporter gene construct analysis, and MTS assay. Targeting of PCAF by miR-17-5p was evaluated using the luciferase reporter assay.  Results:   PCAF was upregulated in several PCa cell lines. Upregulation of PCAF promoted AR transcriptional activation and cell growth in cultured PCa cells. Expression of PCAF in PCa cells was associated with the downregulation of miR-17-5p. Targeting of the 3'-untranslated region of PCAF mRNA by miR-17-5p caused translational suppression and RNA degradation, and, consequently, modulation of AR transcriptional activity in PCa cells.  Conclusions:   PCAF is upregulated in cultured PCa cells, and upregulation of PCAF is associated with the downregulation of miR-17-5p.

Results:   Using the modified Gleason grading, a high upgrading rate from the biopsy to RP specimens (GS 6-7) and in even 30% a non-organ-confined growth pattern (pT3) of GS 6 carcinoma in RP was found. When considering glandular fusion and the incorporation of the state of nucleoli within the Gleason grading, the agreement of score 6 between biopsy and RP specimens as well as the prediction of a pT2a tumor increased from about 80 to 90%.

It is frequently downregulated, both at the mRNA and protein level, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the mechanisms leading to this reduction are obscure. We sequenced the whole RKIP gene in three human HCC cell lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2, and Hep3B), and in five clinical HCC samples, but could not find any gene variant that might account for their low RKIP levels. We also examined whether gene methylation may be responsible for the altered RKIP expression. No methylation of the RKIP gene was found in the tumor samples, while among the cell lines only Hep3B showed methylation of the gene, which was reduced by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA). The same treatment caused upregulation of RKIP at the mRNA, but not at the protein level, indicating that gene methylation is not a principal mechanism of the decrease in RKIP in the Hep3B cells. Furthermore, different elements consistently suggested that RKIP may be a target repressed by miR-224, a miRNA that is frequently and specifically upregulated in HCC, but our results excluded that this occurs, at least in the HCC cell lines. Factors like Snail, EZH2, and HDAC, have been implicated in the RKIP downregulation present in breast and prostate tumors, though some of our results from the cell lines do not support that they play such a role in HCC; however, this aspect is worthy of further study. However, recent results of ours and others suggest a significant involvement of proteosomal degradation and of its pharmacological inhibition. In conclusion, the causes of RKIP downregulation in HCC remain incompletely understood. However, we think that the present observations will be useful to generate further research, with the ultimate possible goal of devising specific approaches to restore the relevant antitumor function of the factor.""","""['Paola Poma', 'Manuela Labbozzetta', 'Nicoletta Vivona', 'Rossana Porcasi', ""Natale D'Alessandro"", 'Monica Notarbartolo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""OMICS""","""['The biological complexity of RKIP signaling in human cancers.', 'Potential Therapeutic Applications of MDA-9/Syntenin-NF-κB-RKIP Loop in Human Liver Carcinoma.', 'Loss of Raf kinase inhibitor protein promotes cell proliferation and migration of human hepatoma cells.', 'Promoter hypermethylation of DNA damage response genes in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Overexpression of RKIP and its cross-talk with several regulatory gene products in multiple myeloma.', 'RKIP Pleiotropic Activities in Cancer and Inflammatory Diseases: Role in Immunity.', 'Targeting Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein Regulation and Function.', 'Epigenetic changes and nuclear factor-κB activation, but not microRNA-224, downregulate Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein in triple-negative breast cancer SUM 159 cells.', 'The biological complexity of RKIP signaling in human cancers.', 'Promoter methylation of Raf kinase inhibitory protein: A significant prognostic indicator for patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.']"""

Although its use is not widespread. International scoring system for evaluation of symptoms of the prostate is common in Poland (IPSS). Responses to the questionnaire are the basis of IPSS scale. Quality of life form (QoL) is in addition to the scale of IPSS. It defines subjective assessment of patient well-being in case of symptoms of lower urinary tract at the same level as at the time of the study. 5-point questionnaire IIEF-5 has been used in Poland since 1999 to assess men's sexual life. The aim of the study is to compare the assessment of disuric disorders measured using the International Prostate System Score (IPSS) and Quality of Life scale versus scale of men's sexual self-esteem IIEF-5 in men at the age of 50-70. The study included 1746 randomly selected residents of the district Cracow-Downtown, at the age of 50-70. Medical interview was carried out (including complaints of lower urinary tract symptoms (IPSS), quality of life (QoL) and sexual dysfunction (IIEF-5); physical examination with assessment of individual systems with particular emphasis on genitourinary system, physical examination of the prostate (DRE), PSA level in total and free fractions, a biopsy of the prostate under ultrasound control if necessary. For the analysis qualified 1746 men. The men were divided into groups called groups of disease: a suspicion of prostate cancer, can not rule out prostate cancer, prostate cancer confirmed, probable benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), no lesions. The largest was the group with probable benign prostatic hyperplasia 64.89% of the total respondents, followed by a group of men without lesions, 26.29%, a group of probable prostate cancer was 6.41% of the respondents, a group with whom you can not rule out prostate cancer was 1.89%, the smallest was the group with confirmed prostate cancer, 0.52% of all male respondents. The age groups were: 498 respondents aged 50-54 years and 391 aged 55-59, 397 aged 60-64 and 460 aged 65-70. Mean age was 59.24 years. Ppicked up data were processed and analized by STATA- 5,0. Differences between groups relative to answers for the questions of scales: IPSS, QoL and IIEEF5 questionnaire were analized by Mann-Whitney, Kruskal- Wallis, Scheffe's and chi2 tests. Homogeneity of the IPSS were analised by a Cronbach coefficient test. Accordance of each questions of the scale to whole scale were analised by correlation and line regression tests. Based on the analysis of the total scale score by IPSS and QoL scale and quality of life questionnaire IIEF-5 showed that in the process of aging in the population more frequently in older than in younger men, there are complaints from the urinary tract and deteriorating quality of life of self-esteem and quality of life of sexual self-esteem. After analyzing the result of scale: IPSS, QoL, and IIEF-5 in the disease groups, it was found that the total score of IPSS differentiates men in the group with probable benign prostatic hyperplasia, from a group of men without lesions and men with suspected prostate cancer. Statistically significant reduction in quality of life (QoL) in patients with confirmed prostate cancer and in the group with probable benign prostatic hyperplasia compared with men without lesions. The highest self-esteem sex life (IIEF-5) was found in men without lesions and the lowest in the group with known prostate cancer. The scale of quality of life (QoL) was significantly positively correlated with the results of IPSS scale, as well as with each of its questions. Deterioration in the quality of life occurred as a crescendo pain of lower respiratory tract. With the increase in the incidence and severity of each symptom on a scale IPSS worsening of self-esteem was examined using a scale IIEF-5. U of men with the deterioration of the quality of life measured by the scale of QoL, worsening their sexual self-esteem scale IIEF-5. In the process of aging are growing complaints from the lower urinary tract, self-esteem deteriorates the quality of life, including sexual life, which is especially marked in men with enlarged prostate. The scale of quality of life (QoL) is significantly positively correlated with the results of IPSS scale. With the increase in the incidence and severity of symptoms on a scale IPSS had decreased self-test using the IIEF-5 scale.

A putative mechanism allowing prostate cancer (PCa) cells to grow under low levels of androgens, is the expression of constitutively active, C-terminally truncated AR lacking the AR-ligand binding domain (LBD). Due to the absence of a LBD, these receptors, termed ARΔLBD, are unable to respond to any form of anti-hormonal therapies. In this study we demonstrate that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib inhibits AR as well as ARΔLBD-signalling in CRPCa cells. This inhibition was paralleled by proteasomal degradation of the AR- and ARΔLBD-molecules.

The distribution of the NQO1 codon 187 SNP did not differ significantly between prostate cancer patients and the control group (p = 0.242). There was also no association between the allelic variants and stage or Gleason score of the tumors. The NQO1 P187S SNP was not significantly associated with an increased prostate cancer risk in our cohorts. The SNP has also no influence on histopathological characteristics of the tumors. A combined analysis of all available data from published European studies also showed no significant differences in the genotype distribution between controls and prostate cancer patients.

Patients and methods:   This population-based cohort study used data on 29,825 patients diagnosed with five common cancers-lung (34.2%), colorectal (19.9%), female breast (21.6%), prostate (19.1%), and head and neck (5.2%)-in the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database (GPRD) who died between 2000 and 2008. Opioid prescription rates in the last 3 months of life were described. Characteristics associated with opioid prescribing were investigated by using generalized estimation equation models.  Results:   In the last 3 months of life, 43.6% (95% CI, 43.0% to 44.2%) of patients received at least one prescription of opioids: morphine (33.4%; 95% CI, 32.8% to 33.9%), diamorphine (11.6%; 95% CI, 11.2% to 11.9%), and fentanyl family (10.2%; 95% CI, 9.8% to 10.5%). Over time, prescription rates increased for opioids predominant during specific time periods, especially oxycodone. Older patients (age > 60 years) had significantly lower chances of receiving opioids than their younger (age < 50 years) peers (prevalence ratio [PR] range, 0.14 to 0.78), even adjusted for comorbidity. Women were slightly more likely than men to receive any type of opioid (PR,1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.11). Morphine and diamorphine (PR range, 1.14 to 1.56) were more commonly prescribed for lung and colorectal cancers and fentanyl family for head and neck cancers (PR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.62) compared with for prostate cancers.  Conclusion:   Morphine and diamorphine remain the stronghold for treating cancer pain in the United Kingdom. Opioid prescription rates are increasing over time.

Methods:   One thousand three hundred fifty patients (response = 51%) completed questions on socio-demographic and illness-related variables, the Dutch version of the DT and Problem List, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Receiver operating characteristics analyses were performed to determine cancer specific cutoff scores. Univariate and multivariate effects of socio-demographic and illness-related variables (including cancer type) on distress were examined.  Results:   Prostate cancer patients reported significantly lower DT scores (M = 2.5 ± 2.5) and the cutoff score was lower (≥ 4) than in patients with most other cancer types (M varied between 3.4 and 5.1; cutoff ≥ 5). Multivariate analyses (F = 10.86, p < .001, R(2) = 0.08) showed an independent significant effect of four variables on distress: intensive treatment (β = .10, any (combination of) treatment but surgery only and 'wait and see'); a non-prostate cancer type (β = -.17); the interaction between gender and age (β = -.12, highest distress in younger women as compared with older women and younger and older men); and the interaction between cancer type and treatment intensity (β = .08, lowest scores in prostate cancer patients receiving non-intensive treatment as compared with their counterparts).

Research approach:   A constructivist grounded theory approach was used to analyze and build a descriptive framework from semistructured interviews.  Setting:   A university-affiliated urban hospital in southern California.  Participants:   30 Latinos treated for prostate cancer, who had at least one first-degree male relative (FDMR), and who lived near the medical center.  Methodologic approach:   Semistructured interviews with bilingual Latinos were conducted in participants' homes in the language they preferred. Individual and collaborative analyses of translated transcripts were guided by constructivist grounded theory.  Findings:   Analysis uncovered an overarching process of purposeful interacting. Components of the process included occasionally overlapping spheres of communication, which were connected to purposes and content. Balanced in and influenced by the spheres were cross-cutting processes of respectful silence and selective disclosure.  Conclusions:   Men communicated different content about their prostate cancer to people representing different reference groups. Respectful silence and selective disclosure could be viewed as men's enactment of social interaction-using and choosing words based on the symbolic meaning the men perceived would have their intended meaning for the people in each of the spheres.

Methods:   A total of 656 patients complaining of lower urinary tract symptoms who attended our urology outpatient department were enrolled. The standard assessment for lower urinary tract symptoms was applied, including serum total and free PSA determinations and transabdominal prostate volume measurement. Patients with a history of transurethral surgery, prostate cancer, and conditions other than benign prostatic hyperplasia that could affect the PSA levels were excluded. A linear regression model was used to estimate the prostate volume. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate the ability of serum PSA and free PSA to estimate threshold prostate volumes and to select the optimal serum PSA and free PSA cutoff values.  Results:   The linear regression model included age (P < .000), total PSA (P < .006), and free PSA (P < .000) as independent predictors of prostate volume. Consequently, an easy to use equation was developed to estimate the prostate volume. Free PSA performed better than total PSA at predicting the prostate volume. An area under the curve of 0.668 ± 0.022 at predicting prostate volume >40 cm(3) with total PSA increased to 0.721 ± 0.021 with free PSA. Moreover, free PSA with a cutpoint of 0.495 ng/mL correctly estimated a prostate volume of >40 and <40 cm(3) in 71% and 66% of the cases, respectively.

Methods:   Patients electing active surveillance of their low grade, low volume prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen <20 ng/mL, <cT2 disease who underwent confirmatory rebiopsy were included. Biopsy progression was defined as >2 core involvement or Gleason 7 disease on subsequent biopsies. Prostate-specific antigen, total number of cores on initial and rebiopsy, the presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and prostate-specific antigen density, when available, were assessed as predictors of biopsy progression.  Results:   Sixty patients were included. Median time to rebiopsy was 2 months. Nineteen patients (31.7%) had findings that excluded them from active surveillance. Despite rebiopsy findings, 7 patients elected for active surveillance, all of which eventually underwent treatment for continued biopsy progression. Of the 41 patients eligible for active surveillance after rebiopsy, 8% elected treatment, 74% remained on active surveillance, and 13% experienced biopsy progression. No cancer on rebiopsy was associated with a reduced risk of progression to treatment on active surveillance (odds ratio 0.14, P = .011). A microfocus of Gleason 4 pattern (odds ratio 16.0, P = .04) and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (odds ratio 7.29, P = .03) on initial biopsy were independent predictors of immediate rebiopsy progression.

Materials and methods:   From 4 clinical sites, we selected a cohort of 304 men who had been followed up for 17.6 years after prostatectomy for clinical recurrence. We assessed the prognostic value of a PSA slope cutpoint of 2.0 pg/mL/mo against established risk factors to identify men at low risk of clinical recurrence using uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses.  Results:   The univariate hazard ratio of a PSA slope >2.0 pg/mL/mo was 18.3 (95% confidence interval 10.6-31.8) compared with a slope ≤ 2.0 pg/mL/mo (P <.0001).

This study was undertaken to illustrate the safety and initial results of pure LESS-RP with conventional available instruments.  Methods:   A prospective clinical database was established in September 2010 to assess the outcome following the introduction of LESS-RP at our institution. By June 2012, six procedures had been performed. The mean patient age was 74.7 (74.0 - 76.0) years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.8 (19.5 - 32.2) kg/m(2). The LESS-RP was preformed through an extra-peritoneal approach using single port access with QudaPort, 0° lens 5 mm flexible tip video-laparoscope and available conventional laparoscopic instruments. Parameters assessed were operative time, estimated blood loss, intra-operative complications, drainage time, postoperative pain score (visual analogue pain scale (VAPS), 0 - 10), pathological results, and postoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Results:   LESS-RP was completed for all six cases without additional trocar placement or conversion to standard laparoscopic or open radical prostatectomy. The mean operative times were 252.5 (190.0 - 305.0) minutes, estimated blood loss was 300 (100 - 500 ml). There was no documentable intraoperative complication. The mean wound-drainage time was 5.2 (2.0 - 7.0) days, and the first postoperative day VAPS was 0.8 (0 - 3.0). Final pathological staging was pT2aN0M0 in four cases and pT2cN0M0 in two cases. Surgical margins were negative for all cases. The one-month post-operative PSA was less than 0.02 ng/ml in each case. All patients were continent without pad usage at 1 year postoperatively.

However, the role of ADAM9 in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is not clear. This study aimed to explore the different expressions on protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) level of ADAM9 between hormonal sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) and CRPC tissue, and find the correlation with prognosis.  Methods:   Clinicopathologic characteristics of 106 HSPC and 76 CRPC cases were collected. The ADAM9 expressions were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. ADAM9 mRNA of 32 additional cases (16 HSPC and 16 CRPC patients) were analyzed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The prediction values of variables for overall survival (OS) of CRPC patients were analyzed using Cox regression.  Results:   ADAM9 protein expression was significantly downregulated in CRPC compared with HSPC tissue (31.6% vs. 81.1%, P < 0.001). The relativity transcription level of ADAM9 mRNA was 0.45 for CRPC tissue and 1.0 for HSPC tissue (P = 0.002). In the CRPC group, patients with low ADAM9 protein expression were significantly associated with shorter OS than patients with high expression (38.6 months vs. 57.8 months, hazard rate (HR) = 2.638, P = 0.023).

There is still a difference between clinical staging and the post-operative final pathologic staging; hence, an excellent tool for accurately predicting the pathologic stages of prostate cancer is needed urgently in clinical practice. The Partin tables are the most popular and widely used tool for predicting the pathologic stages of prostate cancer because of its high accuracy and ease of implementation. The aim of this study was to externally validate the accuracy of the three versions of the Partin tables in predicting the post-operative pathologic stages in Chinese patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the data from 203 patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomies between June 2000 and May 2012. The accuracies of the three versions of the Partin tables in predicting the post-operative pathologic stages in Chinese patients with prostate cancer were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results:   Using the 1997, 2001, and 2007 Partin tables for predicting the current cases, the AUC of organ confinement (OC) was 0.877, 0.788, and 0.726; the AUC of extracapsular extension (ECE) was 0.525, 0.615, and 0.608; the AUC of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) was 0.875, 0.649, and 0.820; and the AUC of pelvic lymph node invasion (LNI) was 0.808, 0.758, and 0.735 respectively.  Conclusions:   The accuracies of the three versions of Partin tables in predicting OC, SVI, and LNI were good, especially the 2001 Partin table for SVI. In contrast, the accuracy of the three versions of the Partin tables in predicting ECE was fair.

Observations from living cells have shown that AR translocates to the nucleus upon ligand binding, where it forms typical 'nuclear foci' that are considered as sites of gene transcription. Recently, we reported the ligand-mediated association of AR with mitotic chromatin and suggested its role in 'transcription memory', proposing a 'biopit model'. In the present study, we show that each of the AR domains is obligatory for its association with mitotic chromatin and also that full-length AR is necessary for efficient association. In addition, deletion or point mutations in bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) revealed impaired localization, 'nuclear foci' formation and abolished AR binding with mitotic chromatin. Interestingly, well-characterized AR-NLS mutants associated with the manifestation of pathological conditions (prostate cancer and androgen-insensitivity syndrome) exhibited differential behaviour on mitotic chromatin and also impaired receptor localization and 'nuclear foci' formation. Finally, we report that, in addition to its functions in nuclear import, DNA binding, acetylation, N/C-termini interactions and transactivation, the AR-NLS region also functions as 'mitotic chromatin binding-determining region' and has a novel role in the regulation of the AR association with mitotic chromatin.""","""['Sanjay Kumar', 'Rakesh K Tyagi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['Five novel androgen receptor gene mutations associated with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.', 'Impaired helix 12 dynamics due to proline 892 substitutions in the androgen receptor are associated with complete androgen insensitivity.', 'Evidence that lack of ligand-binding domain correlates with nuclear distribution of unliganded human androgen receptor and loss of transactivation activity.', 'The androgen receptor: unlocking the secrets of its unique transactivation domain.', 'Androgen receptor mutants that affect normal growth and development.', 'Crosstalk between KIF15 and AR in castrate-resistant prostate cancers.', 'Low amounts of heavy water increase the phase separation propensity of a fragment of the androgen receptor activation domain.', 'Nuclear localization signal region in nuclear receptor PXR governs the receptor association with mitotic chromatin.']"""

Among the major events in this progression cascade are enhanced cell migration and loss of adhesion. Moreover, elevated levels of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) found within the tumor microenvironment are hallmarks of progression of this cancer. To understand the role of nitrosative stress in prostate cancer progression, we investigated the effects of NO and iNOS on prostate cancer cell migration and adhesion. Our results indicate that ectopic expression of iNOS in prostate cancer cells increased the extent of cell migration, which could be blocked by selective ITGα6 blocking antibody or iNOS inhibitors. Furthermore, iNOS was found to cause S-nitrosylation of ITGα6 at Cys86 in prostate cancer cells. By comparing the activities of wild-type ITGα6 and a Cys86 mutant, we showed that treatment of prostate cancer cells with NO increased the level of ITGα6 heterodimerization with ITGβ1 but not with ITGβ4. Finally, S-nitrosylation of ITGα6 weakened its binding to laminin-β1 and weakened the adhesion of prostate cancer cells to laminin-1.

PrLZ might enhance AR transactivation via a change of AR conformation that leads to promotion of AR nuclear translocation and suppression of AR degradation via modulating the proteasome pathway, which resulted in increased prostate-specific antigen expression and promoted PCa growth at the castration-resistant stage. Clinical PCa sample survey from same-patient paired specimens found increased PrLZ expression in castration-resistant PCa following the classical androgen deprivation therapy. Targeting the AR-PrLZ complex via ASC-J9® or PrLZ-siRNA resulted in suppression of PCa growth in various human PCa cells and in vivo mouse PCa models.

Different combination of TCP parameters (TD50 and γ50 in the Poisson-like model), were considered for DILs and the prostate outside DILs (CTV) for 7 intermediate/high-risk prostate patients. The aim was to maximize TCP while constraining NTCPs below 5% for all organs at risk. TCP values were highly depending on the parameters used and ranged between 38.4% and 99.9%; the optimized median physical doses were in the range 94-116 Gy and 69-77 Gy for DIL and CTV respectively. TCP values were correlated with the overlap PTV-rectum and the minimum distance between rectum and DIL. In conclusion, biological optimization for selective dose escalation is feasible and suggests prescribed dose around 90-120 Gy to the DILs. The obtained result is critically depending on the assumptions concerning the higher radioresistence in the DILs. In case of very resistant clonogens into the DIL, it may be difficult to maximize TCP to acceptable levels without violating NTCP constraints.""","""['R Azzeroni', 'A Maggio', 'C Fiorino', 'P Mangili', 'C Cozzarini', 'F De Cobelli', 'N G Di Muzio', 'R Calandrino']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Prostate stereotactic ablative radiation therapy using volumetric modulated arc therapy to dominant intraprostatic lesions.', 'Inverse planning for HDR prostate brachytherapy used to boost dominant intraprostatic lesions defined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging.', 'A planning study of focal dose escalations to multiparametric MRI-defined dominant intraprostatic lesions in prostate proton radiation therapy.', 'Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to dominant intra-prostatic lesions during extreme hypofractionation for prostate cancer: the impact of rectal spacers.', 'Multiparametric MRI-guided dose boost to dominant intraprostatic lesions in CT-based High-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Radiotherapy planning in a prostate cancer phantom model with intraprostatic dominant lesions using stereotactic body radiotherapy with volumetric modulated arcs and a simultaneous integrated boost.', 'Evaluation of Dose-Painting in the Dominant Intraprostatic Lesions by Radiobiological Parameters using 68Ga- PSMA PET/CT.', 'Voxel-level biological optimisation of prostate IMRT using patient-specific tumour location and clonogen density derived from mpMRI.', 'Correlation between urinary dose and delayed radiation cystitis after 78\xa0Gy intensity-modulated radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer: A 10-year follow-up study of genitourinary toxicity in clinical practice.', 'An integrated strategy of biological and physical constraints in biological optimization for cervical carcinoma.']"""

We also evaluated late recurrence, defined as recurrence after 10-year followup.  Materials and methods:   A total of 3,546 consecutive hormone naïve men were treated with a (125)I prostate implant (retropubic and later transperineal), followed by external beam irradiation, from 1984 to 2000. Recurrence was defined as a prostate specific antigen increase of greater than 0.20 ng/ml or a prostate specific antigen nadir of greater than 0.20 ng/ml. Median followup was 11 years (range 3 months to 26 years).  Results:   In all men 10, 15, 20 and 25-year disease-free survival rates were 75%, 73%, 73% and 73%, respectively. Longest time to recurrence was at the 15.5-year followup. In 313 men with recurrence who were treated 16 to 25 years ago 5% of recurrences were late. In men implanted by the transperineal method since 1995 the 15-year disease-free survival rate was 79%.  Conclusions:   With this irradiation program cancer control, defined using the recurrence definition for radical prostatectomy, was durable with no further recurrence between 15.5 and 25 years of followup. This study also suggests that at least 15 years of followup are necessary to fully evaluate any prostate cancer treatment. Furthermore, if prostate specific antigen is less than 0.20 ng/ml 15 years after treatment, later recurrence should be unlikely.""","""['Frank A Critz', 'James B Benton', 'Philip Shrake', 'Mark L Merlin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Biochemical (prostate specific antigen) recurrence probability following radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Surgery versus implant for early prostate cancer: results from a single institution, 1992-2005.', 'Simultaneous radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 125I prostate implant followed by external-beam radiation.', 'Permanent seed brachytherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a case report and review of the literature.', 'Brachytherapy versus radical prostatectomy.', 'Oncological and urinary outcomes following low-dose-rate brachytherapy with a median follow-up of 11.8\u2009years.', 'Direct comparison of low-dose-rate brachytherapy versus radical prostatectomy using the surgical definition of biochemical recurrence for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Overall survival and prognostic factors prostate cancer in Kurdistan Province-Iran: a population-based study (2011-2018).', 'Bladder surface dose modeling in prostate cancer radiotherapy: An analysis of motion-induced variations and the cumulative dose across the treatment.', 'Does radiotherapy increase the risk of colorectal cancer among prostate cancer patients?

Materials and methods:   The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant original articles published up to August 2012. Characteristics of Included studies were recorded. Methodological quality was assessed by using the quality assessment of diagnostic studies tool. Pooled weighted estimates of diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) were calculated. A summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve was constructed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). Publication bias analysis was also performed.  Results:   Sixteen studies (2624 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Various contrast agents and imaging modes were applied. The independent random-effects summary showed a variation in diagnostic values. The summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and DOR were 0.70, 0.74, and 9.09, respectively. The weighted positive and negative LR were 2.81 and 0.35, with statistically significant between-study heterogeneity (P < .001). Sensitivity was better in positive patient studies than positive biopsy cores ones (0.78 vs. 0.64). SROC plot displayed value for AUC (0.82). Begg's test (P = .822) and Egger's test (P = .198) did not show evidence of publication bias.  Conclusion:   CEUS is a promising tool in the detection of PCa, but it cannot completely replace systematic biopsy under the present circumstances.

Methods and materials:   We reviewed the charts of all patients diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer and treated with a combination of long-term ADT (median, 24 months) and dose-escalated (median, 75.6 Gy) RT between 1990 and 2007. The associations among patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics with biochemical response to neoadjuvant ADT and their effects on failure-free survival (FFS), time to distant metastasis (TDM), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall survival (OS) were examined.  Results:   A total of 196 patients met criteria for inclusion. Median follow-up time for patients alive at last contact was 7.0 years (range, 0.5-18.1 years). Multivariate analysis identified the pre-RT PSA concentration (<0.5 vs ≥0.5 ng/mL) as a significant independent predictor of FFS (P=.021), TDM (P=.009), PCSM (P=.039), and OS (P=.037). On multivariate analysis, pretreatment PSA (iPSA) and African-American race were significantly associated with failure to achieve a pre-RT PSA of <0.5 ng/mL.  Conclusions:   For high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with long-term ADT and dose-escalated RT, a pre-RT PSA level≥0.5 ng/mL after neoadjuvant ADT predicts for worse survival measures. Both elevated iPSA and African-American race are associated with increased risk of having a pre-RT PSA level≥0.5 ng/mL.

Materials and methods:   We evaluated prospectively the penile length of 105 patients with localized prostate cancer treated by open RP. Participants using therapy for penile rehabilitation were excluded from statistical analysis. Measurements of the stretched penis were taken preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months postoperatively. The International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) questionnaire was used to evaluate erectile function. The penile anthropometric measure used was the stretched length of the flaccid penis, from the pubopenile skin angle to the end of the glans, after the prepubic fat was depressed under maximum manual traction.  Results:   The mean stretched penile length 3 months after RP decreased an average of 1 cm from baseline (P <.001). This mean difference persisted until 24 months. At 36 months, the penile length differed 0.6 cm. At 48 months (-0.3 cm) and 60 months (+0.4 cm), the mean differences in penile length before and after RP were not significant (P = .080 and P = .065, respectively). Erectile function was a predictor for early return of penile length.  Conclusion:   Nearly 1 cm of penile shortening after RP may be expected up to 12 months. However, a trend toward recovery of penile length occurs after 24 months of follow-up and is completely re-established after 48 months. The preserved erectile function after RP is a predictor for penile length recovery.""","""['Juliana Souza Vasconcelos', 'Rui Teófilo Figueiredo', 'Fabio Luis Branco Nascimento', 'Ronaldo Damião', 'Eloisio Alexsandro da Silva']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Re: the natural history of penile length after radical prostatectomy: a long-term prospective study.', 'A pilot study on the early use of the vacuum erection device after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Preserved postoperative penile size correlates well with maintained erectile function after bilateral nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'New insights into the pathogenesis of penile shortening after radical prostatectomy and the role of postoperative sexual function.', 'Strategies to promote recovery of cavernous nerve function after radical prostatectomy.', 'Tadalafil rehabilitation therapy for erectile dysfunction following prostatectomy.', 'Vacuum erection device for erectile function rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy: which is the correct schedule?

Background:   their efficiency and short terms outcomes are similar.  Patients and methods:   In an observational retrospective and monocentric study, 86 consecutive patients with benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were enrolled in two non randomized groups. TURP was performed in 44 cases and TURis-PVP in 42 cases. Patients with prostate cancer, urethral stenosis or bladder neck stenosis were not included. Hospital costs with a 3-month follow-up were measured using the database and hospital cost accounting system of the Medical Information Department.  Results:   Patients from both series had similar preoperative characteristics concerning the age, ASA score, urologic history, and antithrombosis treatments. Catheterization period, complications and rehospitalisation rates were similar. With TURis-PVP, prostatic volume was larger (60±24mL vs. 42±16mL; P<0.05), hospital stay was shorter (4.0±2.8days vs. 4.4±2.1days; P<0.05), single-used materials costs were higher (332±64€ vs. 40±18€; P<0.05). The costs of the first hospitalization were 3721±843€ with TURis-PVP and were 3712±880€ with TURP (P=0.14). Global costs with a 3-month follow-up were 3867±1104€ with TURis-PVP and were 4074±1624€ with TURP (P=0.53).

The median dose of radiation and the median duration of AD were 70Gy and 37months respectively. Biochemical recurrence (BF), as primary outcome was defined according to the PHOENIX criteria (nadir PSA+2ng/mL). Multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictive factors of BF.

Moreover, several groups have reported the importance of estrogen induced gene regulation in esophageal cancer (EC). This suggests that there could be a potential for estrogen therapy for EC. The efficient design of estrogen therapies requires as complete as possible list of genes responsive to estrogen. Our study develops a systems biology methodology using esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) as a model to identify estrogen responsive genes. These genes, on the other hand, could be affected by estrogen therapy in ESCC.  Results:   Based on different sources of information we identified 418 genes implicated in ESCC. Putative estrogen responsive elements (EREs) mapped to the promoter region of the ESCC genes were used to initially identify candidate estrogen responsive genes. EREs mapped to the promoter sequence of 30.62% (128/418) of ESCC genes of which 43.75% (56/128) are known to be estrogen responsive, while 56.25% (72/128) are new candidate estrogen responsive genes. EREs did not map to 290 ESCC genes. Of these 290 genes, 50.34% (146/290) are known to be estrogen responsive. By analyzing transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the promoters of the 202 (56+146) known estrogen responsive ESCC genes under study, we found that their regulatory potential may be characterized by 44 significantly over-represented co-localized TFBSs (cTFBSs). We were able to map these cTFBSs to promoters of 32 of the 72 new candidate estrogen responsive ESCC genes, thereby increasing confidence that these 32 ESCC genes are responsive to estrogen since their promoters contain both: a/mapped EREs, and b/at least four cTFBSs characteristic of ESCC genes that are responsive to estrogen. Recent publications confirm that 47% (15/32) of these 32 predicted genes are indeed responsive to estrogen.  Conclusion:   To the best of our knowledge our study is the first to use a cancer disease model as the framework to identify hormone responsive genes. Although we used ESCC as the disease model and estrogen as the hormone, the methodology can be extended analogously to other diseases as the model and other hormones. We believe that our results provide useful information for those interested in genes responsive to hormones and in the design of hormone-based therapies.""","""['Magbubah Essack', 'Cameron Ross MacPherson', 'Sebastian Schmeier', 'Vladimir B Bajic']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Syst Biol""","""['Identification of estrogen-responsive genes using a genome-wide analysis of promoter elements for transcription factor binding sites.', 'Low SOX17 expression is a prognostic factor and drives transcriptional dysregulation and esophageal cancer progression.', 'Identification of GPX3 epigenetically silenced by CpG methylation in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Abnormal Localization and Tumor Suppressor Function of Epithelial Tissue-Specific Transcription Factor ESE3 in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Genomic characterization of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: Insights from next-generation sequencing.']"""

The AIM of our study was to determine the frequency of PCa found on repeat prostate biopsy and the factors leading to higher possibility of cancer positive histological result.  Patients and methods:   We studied retrospectively 113 patients (82 from University Clinic, Jena, Germany and 31 from Department of Urology, Plovdiv, Bulgaria) with initial negative biopsy for cancer who underwent repeat biopsies. The patients were examined between January 1999 and May 2010. The target group included patients with Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level lower than 12.5 ng/ml and without suspicious finding on digital rectal examination (DRE). Different biopsy schemes were used in the initial and the following biopsies, depending on patient age and total prostate volume.  Results:   Overall PCa detection rate was 22.1% (25 of 113). The repeat biopsy found PCa in 15.9% (18 of 113). In patients with 3 biopsies the PCa detection rate was considerably lower--only 8.6% (3 of 35). PCa was found in only 1 patient of 18 (5.5%) who underwent four or more biopsies. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was performed in 15 patients with at least two previously negative biopsies. The pathohistological examination of the resected tissue showed PCa in 3 of the patients (20%).  Conclusion:   The interval between biopsies is not a significant predictive factor for positive prostate biopsy. The chance for detecting PCa after the second negative transrectal biopsy procedure is low. Therefore, TURP can be used as an alternative procedure to harvest adequate tissue material for pathologic examination, especially in patients with obstructive voiding symptoms.""","""['Ivan V Bakardzhiev', 'Ivan D Dechev', 'Thilo Wenig', 'Nonka G Mateva', 'Mladena M Mladenova']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Folia Med (Plovdiv)""","""['Detection of prostate cancer by TURP or open surgery in patients with previously negative transrectal prostate biopsies.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Can Power Doppler enhanced transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy improve prostate cancer detection on first and repeat prostate biopsy?', 'A comparative performance analysis of total prostate-specific antigen, percentage free prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific antigen velocity and urinary prostate cancer gene 3 in the first, second and third repeat prostate biopsy.', 'Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP): Is a repeat biopsy necessary ASAP?
